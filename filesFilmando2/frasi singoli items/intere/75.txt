I:8860;1;He sees the enemy approaching in the dark.
I:8860;2;These soldiers enjoy their free time.
I:8860;3;Barnes has the respect of the soldiers.
I:8860;4;They see Elias on the ground, pursued by the enemy.
I:8860;5;It is quiet in the morning.
I:8860;6;Stone won an award for directing this film.
I:8860;7;While some war films date themselves in a matter of years, Platoon is still a gritty, sad, and amazing piece of filming.
I:8860;8;He is opposed by Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe, outstanding), the hippie anti.
I:8860;9;In the middle is the entire platoon, taking sides, with a civil war brewing inside the unit.
I:8860;10;A heartbreaking study in the madness of war, it stands with Apocalypse Now as the greatest anti.
I:8860;11;war movies, and ranks with All Quiet on the Western Front as the most powerful anti.
I:8860;12;Great captivating story taking one through a Taylor's development from first arrival (armed with a strong sense of duty from his father's/grandfather's military service) all the way through to the end of his tour in Vietnam.
I:8860;13;nevertheless it is a verry good movie
I:8860;14;Having seen this movie a long time ago, the replay shows the intense actions of all the actors.
I:8860;15;The movie is a bit of Hollywood, but It does show some realism.
I:8860;16;Combat movies always incorporate some of Hollywood, but Platoon is a great show.
I:8860;17;Platoon is, in my opinion, the definitive movie about the Viet Nam War.
I:8860;18;It is powerful, insightful, and unforgettable.
I:8860;19;The movie captures and displays insights into the minds and wills of men who fought there.
I:8860;20;There is friendship and animosity, support and deceit, hope and hopelessness.
I:8860;21;Underlying it all, though, is a intense desire among the men to survive to return home.
I:8860;22;the movie contains solid performances throughout.
I:8860;23;I would recommended it to my friends.
I:8860;24;Its a great movie but the disc skips and its brand new You can only watch the first five minutes and then it starts to skip
I:8860;25;this is one of the best vietnam movies around ranking high with full metal jacket.
I:8860;26;Cast of top name actors, love it!
I:8860;27;Loads of action and great characters.
I:8860;28;"Platoon is an amazing film, however, considering that the previously released version contained all sorts of special edition goodies and this version contains none
I:8860;29;My cousin was in Vietnam and he described the place to me and it definitely sounds like the movie.
I:8860;30;I also have friends who have said this was a very accurate film.
I:8860;31;Oliver Stone's main objective in writing and directing this film was to show people what it really was like in Vietnam.
I:8860;32;great actors, a great script, and a great director, Platoon is a great film, that was the big winner at the 1986 Academy Awards Ceremony.
I:8860;33;One of the greatest war movies ever made.
I:8860;34;i'm glad i bought it on here, i can watch it any time.
I:8860;35;Being a true Apocalypse Now fan, I saw it mearly as a way for Charlie Sheen to capitalize on his dad's success.
I:8860;36;we choose to obtain knowledge from a film that uses the power of image,sound and dramatic manipulation to present a distorted view of the Vietnam War hoping to advance a political viewpoint.
I:8860;37;special effects and the technical advisement of Dale Dye(Saving Private Ryan,Band of Brothers and many more)made this movie very realistic in the way combat was depicted and actors were made to look as if they were humping the boonies.
I:8860;38;about 90% of all of those who ever served in S. e Asia have come and go before that.
I:8860;39;people,try to learn something new,too!The best way to honor those who faced Communist totalitarism in the jungles of S. e. Asia is to get the facts.
I:8860;40;I have a family member who is a Vietnam veteran, so a movie like this one is easily his favorite.
I:8860;41;I think it is the best war movie of Vietnam that has been made.
I:8860;42;If you like war movies, I recommend adding this to your collection.
I:8860;43;I liked this movie a lot it shows the dirty side of war and how these young men gave up soo much for our nation
I:8860;44;The 1.85:1 transfer is presented in excellent stark detail retaining all the color palette of the original film.
I:8860;45;This movie brings it all home.
I:8860;46;One of the best Vietnam movies ever!
I:8860;47;This is one of the best war movies I have ever seen.
I:8860;48;I just wonder who the intelligent one was that made this dicision.
I:8860;49;still a great movie cant say enough.
I:8860;50;as most of you already know, Platoon is a great movie depicting a very honest and brutal look at the Vietname War.
I:8860;51;The acting by Dafoe, Berenger, and Sheen is probably the best of their careers.
I:8860;52;The directing by Stone is a high point as well for him.
I:8860;53;The movie is as intense as they come.
I:8860;54;View the village scene and you'll see why.
I:8860;55;the special features are good complements to the movie.
I:8860;56;The commentary by Stone and Capt. Dye is fitting and informative.
I:8860;57;The documentary as well provides some great insight, and it doesn't ramble on about unimportant facts.
I:8860;58;Overall, it's a pretty decent set of bonuses.
I:8860;59;And this film captures all sides of it, on both a visceral level, as well as a philosophical one.
I:8860;60;From the bloodthirsty sergeant, to the honest and true idealist soldier, to the everyman trying to sort it all out and survive .
I:8860;61;For love of country, we can all view this film to understand what they went through.
I:8860;62;My thoughts and prayers are with all the soldiers.
I:8860;63;I bought the special edition a few years back.
I:8860;64;My favorite Oliver Stone movie by far.
I:8860;65;This is a great movie that won Best Picture in 1987 and was acclaimed by both the public and the critic.
I:8860;66;"Oliver Stone directs his first movie about Vietnam (the second was ""Born on the Fourth of July"", another great movie) telling his own experience about going to war."
I:8860;67;The whole cast is excellent, specially Dafoe, who in my opinion nails his character.
I:8860;68;There is also a commentary by Stone and a captain in there.
I:8860;69;But let's be smart, let's just ignore the government.
I:8860;70;They always get their way.
I:8860;71;Let's be smart and close all ROTC programs from schools.
I:8860;72;do the job, we'll see how many would go.
I:8860;73;A masterpiece that is just not that, but also makes us think, and educates us.
I:8860;74;One of the best War Movies of all.
I:8860;75;time features realistic and powerful battle sequences, great performances and inspired direction.
I:8860;76;Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe give their best performances, and Sgt. Barnes and Elias clash of personalities is among the best psychological battles ever put to film.
I:8860;77;Also worth mentioning is Charlie Sheen who is great as Chris, a college drop.
I:8860;78;Powerful film, one of the greats.
I:8860;79;Extras: spot Oliver Stone in a cameo, and a young Johnny Depp.
I:8860;80;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 10!
I:8860;81;The movie goes well until we get silly parts in it.
I:8860;82;But a good movie for the most part.
I:8860;83;One of the hand full of Vietnam movies that rate as essential and of historic value for the emotions of the time.
I:8860;84;Platoon is a classic that I have only watched once years ago.
I:8860;85;Still a fantastic movie, though.
I:8860;86;i like the hooker part before the guys gets his camera stolen.
I:8860;87;Charlie Sheen as Chris is the newcomer, a rich idealist of sorts, who as a new recruit comes to hate Berenger and his craziness.
I:8860;88;But it's still among the better movies dealing with Nam.
I:8860;89;I found the movie a good example of human nature.
I:8860;90;Also, the acting was good.
I:8860;91;I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the Vietnam War.
I:8860;92;Film about Vietnam is refreshing after 3 Rambo and Chuck Norris films.
I:8860;93;soundtrack is excellent as well.
I:8860;94;Terribly slow start, very good movie overall!
I:8860;95;It puts a whole new look on life.
I:8860;96;My favorite war film of the 1980's and also of all time, was Oliver Stone's Platoon.
I:8860;97;the conflict between Tom Berenger and William Dafoes characters stands as the heart of the film and was a true reflection of the real world issues of the Vietnam conflict.
I:8860;98;It was Berenger's performance that drove the film into a realistic portrayal of the effect war has on man, The world of cinema is where we all go to escape and be entertained.
I:8860;99;Oliver Stone's Platoon, was one of those films that went beyond the world of entertainment.
I:8860;100;The film had a lasting effect on those of us that grew up during the Vietnam era.
I:8860;101;Hopefully, it has also had an effect on those born past that era.
I:8860;102;had never been more clearly and realistically stated in any film before Platoon.
I:8860;103;Strikingly realistic depiction of the Viet Nam war.
I:8860;104;Young Willam DaFoe is awesome, and Charlie Sheen, although not among my favorites does an excellent job in this role.
I:8860;105;This is a great movie and considering I spent 14 years in the military it hits close to home.
I:8860;106;Qucik shipper and fair priced look forward to futre business.
I:8860;107;Platoon is unquestionably one of the most powerful movies I've seen within the last twenty years.
I:8860;108;Though I was too young to remember the horror that was the Vietnam War, this movie captures the emotion and tragedy of what was a dark era in our nation's history.
I:8860;109;Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe all put in strong performances.
I:8860;110;(Sheen, in particular, is excellent as the young private who is baptized into the ways of war.)
I:8860;111;In a sense, this is Lord of the Flies set in 1967 Vietnam.
I:8860;112;One of my all time favorites.
I:8860;113;This is certainly one of the best movies ever made.
I:8860;114;Color and scene shots are creative and stunning.
I:8860;115;Thanks to an entire winning cast of believable characters and commanding performance by Charlie Sheen.
I:8860;116;It is an original production, flawless, timeless, without peer or jury.
I:8860;117;An old classic that is still great.
I:8860;118;Great movie, very realistic and thought provoking, excellent acting by Sheen and the rest of the cast.
I:8860;119;I highly recommend it if you like war films.
I:8860;120;Platoon is one of the best war films ever, eventually receiving four Academy Awards, including Best Picture.
I:8860;121;He is young and full of promise, including a college education, but he gives all that away to serve his country.
I:8860;122;As mentioned earlier, the film won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Directing, Film Editing and Sound, and it also stars Forest Whitaker, Keith David, Kevin Dillon, Johnny Depp, and others.
I:8860;123;This video, Platoon, apply portrays how and why so many of our brave men and women came home with such devastating memories of the war.
I:8860;124;And it is still happening today in Afghanistan.
I:8860;125;Oliver Stone directed this powerful film about the Viet Nam War.
I:8860;126;I saw the Viet Nam memorial in Washington, D. c., and it is very moving, and a fitting monument to that war.
I:8860;127;A monumental clash of the titans ensues, a battle between good and evil.
I:8860;128;Lock and load!The cast also includes future Oscar winner Forest Whitaker, Johnny Depp, Francesco Quinn, Kevin Dillon, John C. McGinley, and Mark Moses.
I:8860;129;He is a very shocking character who seems completely without a moral compass.
I:8860;130;and, according to Tom Berenger, this caused Oliver Stone to laugh hysterically once during filming.
I:8860;131;charlie Sheen is of course the son of actor Martin Sheen, who also appeared in an epic film about Viet Nam, Apocalypse Now.
I:8860;132;Platoon was an early success, winning the Oscar for best picture, and best director for Oliver Stone.
I:8860;133;Platoon also did well at the box office.
I:8860;134;martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ (Director's Cut) [Import, All.
I:8860;135;sgt. Elias: I love this place at night.
I:8860;136;Very real war within one self and within one's own element that is defined in this film while battling a very real enemy on the opposite side.
I:8860;137;For me, Platoon is one of the best war flicks ever .
I:8860;138;"and certainly the best of the ""'Nam"" genre."
I:8860;139;not a good time for America, and the movie captures that well.
I:8860;140;It's ddnt work when I got it at all.
I:8860;141;Hopefully the return and reshipping is worth the wait.
I:8860;142;Platoon is after my opinion one of the best movies made about the Vietnam War ever.
I:8860;143;Oliver Stone let us see the war through the eyes of a young recruit Chris(Sheen), and his struggle to keep his sanity and his morality intact in this brutal war, that threatens to steal both things from him.
I:8860;144;the movie is shocking and I believe(without having any first hand experience) it gives you a good idea what it is really like being at war.
I:8860;145;This seems to be a very personal movie for Stone, and the message is still an important one today.
I:8860;146;My father, a Vietnam veteran and staff sergeant in the U. s. Air Force said it best, This was a real accurate depiction of Vietnam.
I:8860;147;charlie Sheen does a remarkable job as the new recruit in the Army Platoon.
I:8860;148;Willem Dafoe also did a remarkable job as Sergeant Elias, a compassionate officer who is sick of war.
I:8860;149;And Tom Berenger delivered a very convincing performance as Sergeant Barnes, a hard.
I:8860;150;like Martin Sheen did in another classic depiction of Vietnam, one Apocalypse Now, Charlie does an excellent job of narrating the film, adding an extra dimension to it.
I:8860;151;If you are a student of history, you will love Platoon.
I:8860;152;Great Movie in the 20th Anniversary Collectors Edition.
I:8860;153;There's not a lot of quiet reflection throughout the film but you can tell they're being affected by it, including the well.
I:8860;154;it's funny that Platoon ended up winning Best Picture and Director even though to me JFK is the perfect Oliver Stone film.
I:8860;155;Regardless it's nice to have another film about the Vietnam experience.
I:8860;156;I'd recommend the Special Edition and didn't actually find out about the third until I after I bought this one.
I:8860;157;This track is filled with fascinating personal insights and is essential listening for any fan of the movie.
I:8860;158;This is a great track that is technical but also accessible and really makes you appreciate the amount of work that went into this movie.
I:8860;159;Snapshot in Time: 1967.1968 gives a historical perspective to the time period the film takes place in and puts things into perspective by exploring the origins of the conflict and how the U. s. got involved.
I:8860;160;Some highlights include a bit about how they created the village in the movie from scratch and did such a good job that locals moved in with no prompting!
I:8860;161;These guys tell some fascinating stories that are in turn juxtaposed with Stone talking about his own experiences.
I:8860;162;"included from the previous edition is ""Tour of the Inferno,"" an excellent, in."
I:8860;163;depth retrospective documentary that brought back a lot of the film's cast who talk about their experiences making the film.
I:8860;164;This is a fantastic doc that manages not to repeat too much of what was said in the two commentary tracks.
I:8860;165;It was tough but also taught them valuable lessons that helped them survive and bonded them with their fellow recruits.
I:8860;166;Platoon is one of my favorite movies dealing with war.
I:8860;167;I am a war buff and an actual portrayl of war is something that i like to see in a good war movie.
I:8860;168;I liked it alot, and if your a realy war historian, or just an action fan, you will enjoy this movie right along side Saving Private Ryan.
I:8860;169;One of the best of its time.
I:8860;170;Intense battle scenes and very realistic war sequences.
I:8860;171;I highly recommend it even though it is a bit disturbing.
I:8860;172;very very enjoyable flick, mainly because it reminded me of FMJ(full metal jacket) and the humor was pretty good too.
I:8860;173;ray player was brand new.
I:8860;174;great movie plot etc, shows the other side of what full metal didnt show, only movie to say my hometown brandon MS
I:8860;175;Both Depp and Stone have brief appearences, all us Depp fans who wanted more.
I:8860;176;well, just be glad he had his cameo, for it was wonderful.
I:8860;177;Some have said that this occurence did not really happen in real life, but I have no way of knowing the truth, and wether it was fiction or not, it still enhanced the story that Oliver told.
I:8860;178;gritty, gory, hardcore and realistic, Platoon is not for the weak hearted just looking for an entertaining movie.
I:8860;179;Defoe is great and so is Forest Whittaker.
I:8860;180;Oliver Stone's brilliant 1986 film on the grunt's war in Vietnam had a lot to work with: a controversial subject well placed for dramatic effect, brilliant acting from his three leads (Dafoe, Berenger, and, yes, even Sheen), some stunning visual images (more on this in a moment), and the superb employment of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings.
I:8860;181;residual and persistent hope in the face of the overwhelming horror of the film.
I:8860;182;platoon is Oliver Stone at his best.
I:8860;183;All with good reason and well earned.
I:8860;184;This was a very good movie.
I:8860;185;It has a good story line and excellent characters.
I:8860;186;Some were good men and women who followed their orders and served with honor and dignity.
I:8860;187;the interesting thing to see about this movie are all the stars who were no more than bit part actors when this movie was originally filmed.
I:8860;188;its a good story, but just that.
I:8860;189;This never happened and Stone, a combat veteran, invented some of this stuff from his experiences and added a lot of fantasy stuff that makes the story sound better.
I:8860;190;What made that film so dangerous was that it was so well crafted that people believed it.
I:8860;191;This film was great catharsis for them.
I:8860;192;The emphasis in this film was on the soldiers and it's important for today's audience to appreciate the sacrifices of these men then and now.
I:8860;193;Though I am too young to have served in Viet Nam, I can still easily identify with many aspects of this gripping and seemingly realistic portrayal of jungle guerilla warfare, probably because as a youngster I observed the behavior and listened intently to veterans who had returned from that country, even as late as 1975.
I:8860;194;Being a former Marine and understanding the fighter's metality, I suppose the greatest impact of this film for me comes from living the events through those who actually were there.
I:8860;195;there are plenty of great reviews of this film.
I:8860;196;It is a great movie about the Vietnam war.
I:8860;197;the fact that I got the Blu.
I:8860;198;This movie is of my generation.
I:8860;199;wahts more great acting good story platoon was and is a great movie to watch!!!
I:8860;200;This is no doubt, the best war movie I ever seen.
I:8860;201;Tom Berenger does a supurb job of acting.
I:8860;202;It was based on the first hand experience of director Oliver Stone.
I:8860;203;The film won the 1988 Oscar for Best Picture and is enrichened by an excellent musical score.
I:8860;204;Platoon is a dramatic movie that truly portrays what life was like in Vietnam and the hell that the men went through daily.
I:8860;205;I would recommend it to anyone seeking a great Vietnam War film.
I:8860;206;It started out with a feisty grandmother, shouting at the soldiers in Vietnamese.
I:8860;207;the actors did an excellent job portraying what it was like to fight in a war they didn't understand.
I:8860;208;The rest of the cast gives fine support while the script by Stone, partially from personal experience, is full of authentic dialogue and veracious detail.
I:8860;209;The clash between our civilized nature and our baser instincts is well presented.
I:8860;210;I do believe that Platoon was more of a throwback to World War II movies in the sense that it focused on the dynamics of the soldiers immersed in actual battles with the enemy.
I:8860;211;This is an outstanding look at the horrors of the Vietnam War.
I:8860;212;The classic good vs. evil struggle between Willem Dafoe's Elias and Tom Berenger's Sgt. Barnes is legendary.
I:8860;213;Charlie Sheen exhibits perhaps his best work with a very human, realistic performance as the guy who actually volunteered to carry a machine gun in the Mekong Delta, totally unaware of the hell he was about to enter.
I:8860;214;its tough to watch parts of the movie, but it is really a great film.
I:8860;215;Keith David, and Forest Whitaker deliver excellent performances as black soldiers struggling with their enemies in the jungle and in their own company.
I:8860;216;the film has a terrific soundtrack that compliments the direction of Stone who was at his peak during the making of the film.
I:8860;217;Platoon is one of the best (if not THE best) films of the 1980's.
I:8860;218;It has a very Good Documentary on the making of the Movie.
I:8860;219;Enjoyed the action and charactors, gives you a feeling of what some of our uniformed service men went through, my brothers.
I:8860;220;bought this for my boyfriend, one of his favorite movies, he just didnt have it in blue ray.
I:8860;221;Gritty acting, realistic action scenes, powerful message.
I:8860;222;PLATOON tells a powerful story that moves beyond the horror and gore of the Vietnam War, a story that ultimately depicts the demise and disintegration of a dysfunctional combat unit.
I:8860;223;"Barnes is cold, calculating, brutal, intolerant
I:8860;224;The film's climatic ending is powerful, spellbinding.
I:8860;225;PLATOON hits you between the eyes with its depictions of warfare and human conflict, again and again.
I:8860;226;I believe this film portrays a realistic look into the gritty experiences of the Grunts on the Ground.
I:8860;227;One of the greatest war films of all time, Platoon's only weakness is Charlie Sheen's lead performance, and his bad voice.
I:8860;228;And director Oliver Stone's excesses become virtues in this film, the machismo of his dialogue a perfect partner to this boys.
I:8860;229;an unforgettable film and a standard in the war.
I:8860;230;Masochists, this is for you.
I:8860;231;I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again.
I:8860;232;Oliver Stone presents an accurate portrayal of the diificulties that American troops faced in fighting an insurgency.
I:8860;233;A big chunk of the audience also seemed to be from Schofield Barracks.
I:8860;234;"They cheered wildly at some parts, like whenever a charcter refered to ""grunts"" or killing VC."
I:8860;235;It's entertaining and well acted, but is very much more of a work of fiction than I at first realised.
I:8860;236;He was Oliver Stone's company commander in Vietnam.
I:8860;237;His book paints a much more honorable picture of the unit and is much closer to my peace.
I:8860;238;This is the best Vietnam War film ever made.
I:8860;239;The action is great, the acting is superb and the story tells a terrific tale.
I:8860;240;its obvious why this movie won the best picture Oscar in 1986.
I:8860;241;It would win again almost any other year since then as well.
I:8860;242;A timeless classic which everyone should see.
I:8860;243;Platoon is certainly one of the greatest films about war ever made.
I:8860;244;It shares a similar trait with the best war films .
I:8860;245;it is more of a morality play than a straight.
I:8860;246;If you like Platoon, you will enjoy Paths of Glory or Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket.
I:8860;247;Charlie Sheen plays the lead role as a new recruit in what is his finest role.
I:8860;248;That's all I'll say about the film .
I:8860;249;This is actually a re.
I:8860;250;There are subtitles, and a trailer, but that is it.
I:8860;251;Platoon is a moving and compelling film which provides the viewer with a feel of the hardships and epic struggles that troops had to endure in the Vietnam War.
I:8860;252;"This, in my view, is what makes ""Platoon"" particularly great by not glamorising war but as a mature and balanced critique of the horrors of war."
I:8860;253;the film is a story of a small platoon of men doing their best to survive during the Vietnam War.
I:8860;254;this is a fantastic, if brutal movie about the livers of soldiers who fought the war in the jungles of Vietnam.
I:8860;255;this is recommended viewing for anyone who wants to have a feel of what war entails and a perspective of what troops had to endure in Vietnam.
I:8860;256;Mainly it is a visual film that explores the harsh realities of war.
I:8860;257;"oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" is widely regarded as the most realistic film interpretation of the Vietnam War."
I:8860;258;Although you would usually credit actors for incredible acting jobs, you also need to give Stone partial credit for that as well.
I:8860;259;time favorite film regarding the Vietnam war.
I:8860;260;Platoon, directed by Oliver Stone, is also effective.
I:8860;261;The entire cast (including Berenger, Sheen, Dafoe, Whitaker, and David) is excellent.
I:8860;262;"The music is great: the extensive use of Samuel Barber's ""Adagio for Strings"" gives the film a nice touch."
I:8860;263;platoon is certainly an amazing war film, and it's up there with Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now.
I:8860;264;And that something is Innocence.
I:8860;265;"The haunting imagery of death and pain in the film is magnified by Stone's decision to famously use Samuel Barber's masterpiece ""Adagio For Strings"" as this movie's musical calling card."
I:8860;266;PLATOON justifiably won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director for Stone, making him a bankable, if often controversial, Hollywood powerbroker from here on in.
I:8860;267;PLATOON is HIS story, and it is one of the most powerful films ever made in Hollywood history.
I:8860;268;We absolutely love this movie.
I:8860;269;My wife and I watch it together, and I watch it over and over.
I:8860;270;Much better than the one on TV.
I:8860;271;the best thing about this film is it shows what many people didnt talk about in the war,such as how people really didnt get along with their platoon and how some really raped the village girls.
I:8860;272;this is a great movie.
I:8860;273;The Vietnam War was perhaps one of the most intriguing outcomes of this conflicted era.
I:8860;274;As strong and realistic as this tale is, perhaps no other film is as psychological and nerve.
I:8860;275;"licking"" scoundrels who will give unconditional support to their superior officers in exchange of personal benefits."
I:8860;276;Elias is an authentic crusader who has been in country long enough .
I:8860;277;which pretty much builds his reputation on being feared.
I:8860;278;Platoon is arguably one of the most authentic and visceral movies to depict the tragedies and misfortunes of an entire generation of Americans living during the cold.
I:8860;279;MGM has redeployed Platoon, Oliver Stone's Vietnam War classic, as a Special Edition release that marches in lock.
I:8860;280;shined on previous video reissues, and the transfer here shows off the improvements to great effect.
I:8860;281;Nighttime jungle scenes creep onto the screen with dramatic contrast while daytime scenes startle with vibrant greens.
I:8860;282;has been followed by a host of Vietnam War films, but it remains in the upper tier because of its strong young cast, terse storytelling and attention to detail of the Army grunt's day.
I:8860;283;the film developed slowly into an unforgettable tale of war, loyalty, trust and friendship.
I:8860;284;It really got to the heart of human reason and values and made you ask what would I have done?
I:8860;285;Great film and great acting.
I:8860;286;Both Martin and Charlie Sheen didn't get awards or nominations for their respective roles although both the supporting actors did give excellent performances.
I:8860;287;The two sergeants also show the two types of leaders that grunts face: the one that commands respect by fear and the other that commands respect by charisma and a genuine concern for his men.
I:8860;288;I would love to see a restored Blu.
I:8860;289;excellent movie and about as realistic a jungle warfare movie as you're ever gonna see makes this highly recommended.
I:8860;290;Reviews are a far from certain method of being sure that you will choose a film that you really will enjoy.
I:8860;291;Although Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Apocolypse Now and Hamburger Hill all provide their own unique perspective of the Vietnam war, they do I feel share at atmospheric content that manages to transfix your eyes to the screen throughout.
I:8860;292;Each stimulates your imagination and takes your mind over for a couple of hours, transporting you to the hot, humid jungles of Vietnam and its bitter conflict.
I:8860;293;I would also say in the case of Platoon, that fans of Oliver Stone's other works will almost certainly find that this offering will be to their liking.
I:8860;294;My best friend, Randy, served two tours of duty in Vietnam in the late 1960s, and because of these reports he was hesitant to see the film.
I:8860;295;once we get past the film's reputation and actually look at it, what we have is an extremely well.
I:8860;296;like figure, both symbolically fighting for the soul of young and impressionable Sheen.
I:8860;297;There are shockers, of course, but the film achieves its effect less from graphic violence than from suspense, and here it is extremely successful.
I:8860;298;white nature of the story is simplistic almost to the point of annoyance, a truly fine cast carries the film off extremely well.
I:8860;299;Dafoe, however, is astonishingly good, and although very one note Berenger is a powerful metaphor for evil.
I:8860;300;"The supporting cast includes exceptional performances from the likes of Forest Whitaker, Kevin Dillon (particularly effective as the loathesome ""Bunny""), and even a very young Johnny Depp."
I:8860;301;But what the film does do, it does extremely well.
I:8860;302;"rack movie was ""Platoon,"" a highly acclaimed film by Oliver Stone."
I:8860;303;The movie was excellent and seemed ultra realistic.
I:8860;304;well, the movie was just exceptionally well done.
I:8860;305;Of course it got Academy Awards, and deserved them.
I:8860;306;The acting was superb and you actually felt that you were a functioning part of that dreadful little group of men.
I:8860;307;great war movies come and go.
I:8860;308;this movie is a mind set, about the reality of war.
I:8860;309;great cast sheen inoccent, berenger liffer,defoe very moving.
I:8860;310;This was a heroic act, regardless of strategic and tactical blunders on the field.
I:8860;311;The action was amazing and charlie sheen did a great job.
I:8860;312;I esspecially liked the music for it was very movie.
I:8860;313;I can' even put into words how good this movie is.
I:8860;314;An outstanding film with a realistic first.
I:8860;315;platoon is THE Vietnam war movie and is head and shoulders above all the others.
I:8860;316;It's an amazingly realistic look at a very frightening moment in our recent past.
I:8860;317;Platoon is horrific, exciting, entertaining and unforgetable.
I:8860;318;At it's new price., it's a must.
I:8860;319;platoon, Private Ryan, (and soon) The Patriot.
I:8860;320;Charlie Sheehan is a rich kid who actually volunteered to go to Vietnam.
I:8860;321;His performance is admirable and makes you wonder what happened to his career.
I:8860;322;Good imagery, good score, and good supporting cast members make this a five star movie that was very deserving of the 86 academy award for best picture.
I:8860;323;The best vietnam movie I've ever seen.
I:8860;324;I love all the characters and I also love the soundtrack which was performed by georges delerue and I play it again and again.
I:8860;325;And it has a differet perspective from other vietnam movies ever made.
I:8860;326;Everytime I watch this movie I feel the instincts of the people who played in this movie.
I:8860;327;All the actors and director oliver stone is great.
I:8860;328;This is the most realistic Vietnam movie.
I:8860;329;jaundiced eye, at last the film can be seen and discussed critically.
I:8860;330;And that is what this viewer is remembering.
I:8860;331;I bought Platoon for a friend who was of that era.
I:8860;332;"So from my friend named Anitra:""Well because it is one of the most sincere and a true outlooks on Nam ,I can't complain because they swore,killed or some used drugs,that was Nam."
I:8860;333;i am just THANKFUL that Oliver Stone had the therapy vision to make this movie.
I:8860;334;I was blessed with many beautiful little sons and daughters to love and support who are now adults and amazing.
I:8860;335;thank you again Oliver Stone for a dedication to SO MANY who lost their lives,limbs,mind and so much more over there,plus THEIR YOUTH.
I:8860;336;Very powerful and action filled.
I:8860;337;will watch this movie over and over
I:8860;338;William Dafoe was spot on!
I:8860;339;Few movies today can really grab and hold your attention like this movie did.
I:8860;340;Completely consumes your attention and you will continue to watch and be interested until it's over.
I:8860;341;Of those 4 movies, I also find this one to be the most emotional.
I:8860;342;Willem Dafoe is excellent as usal in another powerful role.
I:8860;343;This time, this realistic movie shows americans when they weren't fighting.
I:8860;344;There is so much more to this movie than many realize.
I:8860;345;That is the value of Platoon.
I:8860;346;This movie is one of the best Vietnam war movie that I have ever seen.
I:8860;347;It is ranked right up there with 84 Charlie MoPic.
I:8860;348;I also love the music played throughout the movie.
I:8860;349;For anyone who is interested in war movies this is by far one of the best ever created.
I:8860;350;Superb acting and raw humanity draw the viewer into this movie.
I:8860;351;The characters are complex, believable and only portrayed as realistically heroic.
I:8860;352;The music plays well into the emotional action on the screen.
I:8860;353;This was a good film.
I:8860;354;It shows the hypocrisy and immorality of the Vietnam war.
I:8860;355;that honor certainly goes to Salvador for a gripping story and a performance of a lifetime by James Woods.
I:8860;356;When I first saw Platoon in the theatres in 1986, I remember looking around at one point during the film and seeing every face riveted to the screen.
I:8860;357;Watch it and chew on it awhile.
I:8860;358;Probably one of the most intense sequences Stone has filmed, with screaming women and children and a bunch of angry soldiers.
I:8860;359;Elias is the more compassionate one, mentoring Taylor and helping him become a better soldier.
I:8860;360;That's what makes him really work as an antagonist and Berenger gives one of his best performances in the role.
I:8860;361;rounded character, still a fierce soldier despite his humanism.
I:8860;362;i received the movie in mexico city om time
I:8860;363;Oliver Stone is one of the best directors around and this film is one of the reasons why.
I:8860;364;This film is pure moviemaking, it is executed almost flawlessly by a great director, a strong cast, and a strong story.
I:8860;365;Regarded by many as the best Vietnam War movie of them, the first half of the film is absolutely riveting as Oliver Stone's platoon descends upon a remote village which eerily recalls the My Lai massacre.
I:8860;366;It is such a visceral movie.
I:8860;367;This is probably Oliver Stone's best effort.
I:8860;368;Platoon is a gritty portrayal of a young man's introduction to war and Vietnam.
I:8860;369;This is definitely not an uplifting flag.
I:8860;370;Very real, and surreal at times, Platoon unveils the tragedy, destruction and dehumanization of war.
I:8860;371;Just bubbling below the surface of over the top territory, Berenger and Dafoe unleashe fierce performances.
I:8860;372;Though Stone does showcase the terrible truths of war, he also portrays the camaraderie and bonds of the men trying to keep each other alive.
I:8860;373;This is a very dark and gritty depiction of the Viet Nam war.
I:8860;374;I still think Apocalypse Now was the best.
I:8860;375;Ryan was an epic World War II film, where there was a clear definition of morality.
I:8860;376;There was no triumph at the end of the film.
I:8860;377;It's a good movie to watch, but not the end.
I:8860;378;What I enjoyed most about Platoon is it tells the story how Vietnam (probably) was.
I:8860;379;Already know it was a good movie.
I:8860;380;This was the best deal I could find.
I:8860;381;This was a requested gift.
I:8860;382;Oliver Stone (Born on the Fourth of July, JFK) takes what he seen in Vietnam and implies it into a two hour, gritty, guts and glory type film.
I:8860;383;The realism of the battle scenes and the effects it has upon the soldiers seems to be some of the best to date.
I:8860;384;To say the least Defoe, Berenger and Sheen throw down their best performances of their careers.
I:8860;385;The additional cast is absolutely tremendous.
I:8860;386;Loosing his grip at some points in the film Chris is helped along by his two partying buddies Rahh (Francesco Quinn) and King (Keith David).
I:8860;387;Dont miss out on this exceptional work of art!
I:8860;388;Great narrating, story, and unbelievable acts of war.
I:8860;389;thanks to all the real Vietnam veterans!!!
I:8860;390;the video is great in my opinion.
I:8860;391;the track sounds good, the background sound is pretty good.
I:8860;392;Even with the sound issues, it's fine to listen to, just something you have to deal with.
I:8860;393;ray to anyone who wants to see a great movie and probably the second best war movie ever, behind Apocalypse Now.
I:8860;394;To all, I extend a big thank you from someone from the younger generation.
I:8860;395;The movie is great love it but thats it.
I:8860;396;Director Oliver Stone has assembled an all.
I:8860;397;star cast for this fine film about the life of an Army platoon in the Vietnam war.
I:8860;398;Half of the men side with Barnes and his gung.
I:8860;399;ho attitude, while the rest side with Elias and his compassionate style.
I:8860;400;the fighting in the movie is very realistic and graphic, while the army life in general is accurately portrayed.
I:8860;401;The fire fight at the end of the movie between the Americans and the V. c. is especially well.
I:8860;402;i've seen this movie several times, and I enjoy it each time I see it.
I:8860;403;The acting is excellent, and the realism is first.
I:8860;404;Berenger and Dafoe were both nominated for Academy Awards for their fine performances, while the movie itself won for Best Picture.
I:8860;405;"Watch and feel the power of Platoon
I:8860;406;It has always been a favorite of mine and now my son can enjoy it too.
I:8860;407;"Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" is an explosive tour de force which deals not only with the conflict in Vietnam but also tackles the fundamental issues of good and evil, the effect the 1960's counterculture had on not only civilians living in the US but soldiers abroad, and what it means to retain even a grain of morality in situations which may quite literally kill the average man at any time."
I:8860;408;is the one who utilizes this, showing compassion to his crazed troops, even getting them high to calm them down.
I:8860;409;With his mutilated face, huge arms, hunting knife and green bandana, he fuels the animalistic impulses for immediate revenge and retaliation in the platoon to the point where they become capable of almost anything.
I:8860;410;Perhaps his only value is that he understands the psychology of the NKVD very well.
I:8860;411;This is an absolute masterpiece from an uneven director.
I:8860;412;I have always appreciated all the American vets from all the wars we fought in with respect up to that time!
I:8860;413;I never thought that Oliver Stone had been a good director until I watched this.
I:8860;414;Charlie Sheen's best performance to date.
I:8860;415;William Dafoe's and Tom Berenger's best film as well.
I:8860;416;A down right effective film about a war we don't like to think or talk about but must never forget!
I:8860;417;It's a classic movie to watch!
I:8860;418;Awesome movie to watch, couldn't complain.
I:8860;419;In summary, one is definitely not entertained by this film.
I:8860;420;Perhaps, it's our animal instincts that keep drawing us back to it, sadly.
I:8860;421;This movie was written and directed by Oliver Stone and it is based on his first hand experiences from being in the infantry in Vietnam.
I:8860;422;Oliver Stone is just a superstar director and since this was based on his real life experience you can sense his anguish that he experienced in the war.
I:8860;423;i won't ruin the movie by giving away the storyline but it is one of the best war movies ever made and it was the Academy Award winner for Best picture, Best Director, Best Sound and Best Film Editing.
I:8860;424;Its violent scenes and graphic depictions of guerrilla warfare will linger on your mind long after the film is over.
I:8860;425;i strongly recommend it as being very realistic and depicting the horrors of war.
I:8860;426;But this film is a fictional account of the director's (Oliver Stone) first.
I:8860;427;This is one of those films that simply presents itself for us to watch and think about.
I:8860;428;Great movie that gives you a small insight into a part of American history.
I:8860;429;A very good film and gotta love instant streaming.
I:8860;430;Possibly the greatest war film ever made, and most definetly the best film of the 1980's.
I:8860;431;Stone does a great job directing this classic.
I:8860;432;I also thought Platoon contained some admirable acting (Sheen, Dafoe, Berenger, David), and combat scenes.
I:8860;433;I'd be very surprised if Stone ever makes another movie nearly as good.
I:8860;434;Picture and sound are excellent and offer the best experience of Oliver Stone's Vietnam memoir yet.
I:8860;435;picture: Very good transfer captures Robert Richardson's beautiful but gritty cinematography perfectly.
I:8860;436;The picture is always sharp and never has the badly.
I:8860;437;I'm not sure if the transfer is new from the previous release, but it looks great.
I:8860;438;The real gem here is the feature commentary from Cpt.
I:8860;439;Dye's perspective on the film, both as a vet and a member of the crew, is really fascinating.
I:8860;440;The good people at MGM have really outdone themselves this time.
I:8860;441;The performances of Willem Defoe, and Tom Berenger are breathtaking.
I:8860;442;I think this is a great movie.
I:8860;443;However I disagree with him that this is not a good movie, I thought it was very entertaining and emotional, and I like all of the characters in it (Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger did two great jobs of acting).
I:8860;444;This movie is one of my favorites.
I:8860;445;probably the best Viet Nam War movie ever made along with Full Metal Jacket.
I:8860;446;As others here have noted, the depiction of the experience of grunts in Vietnam is very compelling.
I:8860;447;He brings a special light to his role as the good sargent .
I:8860;448;for a film based on Vietnam that does reward multiple viewings, I recommend the Deer Hunter.
I:8860;449;The video is acceptable, but not as spectacular as I had come to expect from the remastering of such classics as Scarface.
I:8860;450;I'm a huge fan of war movies, especially vietnam era ones.
I:8860;451;Probably because I've been in war and I like to see it depicted on film.
I:8860;452;This movie does a wonderful job of showing what the vietnam war was like through one particular army platoon.
I:8860;453;Now I read several reviews that discredited this movie becuase it didn't depict the various men serving in vietnam in a good military manner and I will say that Stone does highlight the drugs and insubordination alot but that stuff did go, a good bit from what I've read and heard from vets.
I:8860;454;No matter what people might say, I still think this is an awesome movie and a must see for ANYONE.
I:8860;455;This is my absolute favorite movie of all movies.
I:8860;456;"Besides the engaging story, the ""yin and yang"" of the sergeants as representations of the private's conscience, and the honesty ."
I:8860;457;it is truly a work of art for one reason.
I:8860;458;at that point, I knew that Oliver Stone and his movie had nailed it.
I:8860;459;This comes out on top for me due to the sharp visuals (witness them going out on patrol during a thunderstorm) a nigh on perfect musical score and Tom Berenger's unforgettable performance as the brutal Sgt. Barnes who really believes in what he's doing.
I:8860;460;talking John C. McGinley as Sgt. O'Neill and Kevin Dillon as the physco soldier 'Bunny' also give memorable performances.
I:8860;461;Takes you inside a grunt's first few months in an infantry unit in Vietnam.
I:8860;462;I am proud to own this movie and I respect it as the movie does respect Vietnam, with all its horrors and cruelties.
I:8860;463;And that's what this film is .
I:8860;464;Platoon is a very sinister view of the true heart of darkness soldiers had to confront in Vietnam.
I:8860;465;This movie gives no answers, which is good, but all the questions, which is even better.
I:8860;466;the script, the actors, the colors are pretty good.
I:8860;467;bought for my husband and he really like it .
I:8860;468;Platoon is an excellent movie, especially if you want to see more of what Vietnam was like and one that dosen't prey so heavily on the psychology of the grunts.
I:8860;469;I bought this movie for my partner, it is his favorite movie and the original was gnarled by the VCR.
I:8860;470;I do have numerous friends who were.
I:8860;471;I fairly exceptional non epic war movie about a young recruit infantryman with a squad of fellow soldiers in Vietnam battling the enemy, drugs and their one beliefs as to what is right and just and whay is inhumane.
I:8860;472;Deserving of the Best film Oscar, the film remains a reat commercial success.
I:8860;473;It has some great actors like Willim Defoe and Tom Beringer not to mention Charlie Sheen.
I:8860;474;Very well done and I can't get enough of war movies especially one about the war I was in .
I:8860;475;It is very well rounded.
I:8860;476;It has action, drama, comedy,and suspense.
I:8860;477;It's more of an exploration of a soldiers emotions than it is a movie about fighting battles.
I:8860;478;The cast is incredible and the cinematography is also excellent.
I:8860;479;Everyone can probably find something to love about Platoon.
I:8860;480;a must see and definitely a see it again.
I:8860;481;If you enjoyed Saving Private Ryan, or Full Metal Jacket, you will love this very dramatic story.
I:8860;482;Director Oliver Stone, a VietNam veteran himself has an extremely shocking view of the Modern War.
I:8860;483;Charlie Sheen delivers one of his best performances, and Tom Berenger leaves me wanting more.
I:8860;484;If you are a collector of War movies, this one should most certainly be in your collection.
I:8860;485;This movie was great, easily charlie sheen's best.
I:8860;486;Easily one of the top five movies of the 1980's.
I:8860;487;Other notable performances were by Kevin Dillon who played Bunny.
I:8860;488;I liked this movie because it was more than just battles, it took you inside the minds of the people who were living through a war that they did not understand and were not sure what they were supposed to do.
I:8860;489;I've only given 5 stars to a handful of films, but Platoon deserves it.
I:8860;490;Made on a budget of only 6 million, Stone manages to lead his platoon of actors through an ensemble performance that would capture oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Editing, and Sound, plus nominations for Best Supporting Actor for Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger.
I:8860;491;Other unknown or rising stars (including Johny Depp, John C. McGinley, Kevin Dillon, Mark Moses) were excellent as well.
I:8860;492;this is the best music/visual combo in film, although some of Apocalypse, Now is close.
I:8860;493;and certainly it is an honest evaluation of an unreal situation by a young kid who really has seen it all.
I:8860;494;star movie, there are two insightful commentaries (Stone, and technical adviser Dale Dye), and good behind.
I:8860;495;It was the perfect Christmas gift for my dad.
I:8860;496;then watch and love this movie.
I:8860;497;It is an examination of good vs. evil within the ranks of your platoon, an examination of a soldier's journey through life in war, and the hell that was the Vietnam War.
I:8860;498;this is director Oliver Stone's first venture in Vietnam territory.
I:8860;499;charlie Sheen has the difficult task of bringing us, the audience, into his world of death, dope, bullets, and a fraternity he never wanted to belong to.
I:8860;500;"sergeant Barnes

I:8860;506;"Oliver Stone
I:8860;507;This film is both moving and haunting.
I:8860;508;I'll even admit, this film also inspired me to make my future Oscar.
I:8860;509;winning film, PRISONER OF WAR!
I:8860;510;This a one of the best War movies about Vetnam.
I:8860;511;Oliver Stone is at his best.
I:8860;512;this was a good film.
I:8860;513;This film delves into the mind of the grunt, and it is a trip.
I:8860;514;Excellent classic Vietnam Conflict Movie.
I:8860;515;It's good to have my own copy of this movie.
I:8860;516;That along with his addiction to pot and other drugs, make him the more free spirited character of the film.
I:8860;517;this brilliantly made film is the pit of Stone's acheivements.
I:8860;518;It won the Oscar for Best Picture of the Year in 1987, as well as the Oscar for the Best Director.
I:8860;519;It's an extrordanary film that definatly is the best depiction of war that I have ever seen.
I:8860;520;I don't know how normal it is for a woman who wears bows on her shoes to have watched a movie as many times as I have Platoon, but since its premier it has remained one of my favorites.
I:8860;521;the attention to detail, despite some criticism from other reviewers is remarkable.
I:8860;522;Is all here: the forest, the village and its people, guys jerking off in full view, misdirected friendly fire, the underground tunnels of the Viet Cong, and in one stunning sequence, as the men get ready to walk out into the field at dusk after they get the order to lock and load, a black man raising his voice in an almost spiritual rendition of O Susanna.
I:8860;523;what impressed me, and it is rare in American cinema, was to finally see black men portrayed as regular people .
I:8860;524;the wonderful Keith David as the uneducated but incredibly wise and generous King, who, delineating the chasm between black and white, rich and poor, tells the narrator, 'Who ever said we counted for anything?
I:8860;525;berenger and Dafoe give outstanding performances as does Keith Davidand I think the then young Charlie Sheen was a wonderful choice for Chris.
I:8860;526;And if you are impressed at all with Dafoe, watch Stone's Born on the 4th of July where Dafoe gives one of his greatest performances as the embittered and disabled veteran, Charlie from Chicago.
I:8860;527;This 1986 Academy Award winning film is based on writer/director Oliver Stone's experiences in Vietnam.
I:8860;528;Here, all the pent up emotion is unleashed on the innocent villagers.
I:8860;529;this is a great film and it makes most the other war films I've seen pale by comparison.
I:8860;530;I give it my highest recommendation.
I:8860;531;the film brought me right into reality of what its like for the soldiers fearing for their lives and the civilians who happen to get in their way.
I:8860;532;Such it has always been.
I:8860;533;And such it will always be.
I:8860;534;This movie has the actors and the story if you like east movies this is simply the best!!
I:8860;535;It's amazing to watch Apocalypse Now and Platoon back to back, to see views of the Vietnam War separated by about a decade.
I:8860;536;In Platoon, well worthy of its #83 in the AFI Top 100 listing, Charlie Sheen is a volunteer who goes into the Vietnam War with high ethics.
I:8860;537;Charlie is pitted between two veterans .
I:8860;538;absolutely a must watch movie, and one to revisit as you go on through life.
I:8860;539;Each viewing, at each stage, brings you fresh insight into the challenges faced.
I:8860;540;male, in the AFI top 100.
I:8860;541;As I own this disc, I will review it here.
I:8860;542;This new color palette, which more heavily favors blues and greens, really suits the jungle sequences well.
I:8860;543;but the real reason to upgraded is the utterly incredible DTS track.
I:8860;544;"This one has a very aggressive surround track, which really puts you right in the middle of the war!The two new featurettes, ""One War, Many Stories"" and ""Preparation For The Nam"" are good, but don't add a lot to what is already in the great ""Tour of the Inferno"" documentary and two existing audio commentaries."
I:8860;545;But more lines and filler shots.
I:8860;546;The narration is actually very good compared to FMJ, and the acting is spot on.
I:8860;547;I'd give it a five if it were a half hour longer.
I:8860;548;This movie is a standout from all other war movies because it puts together the most intellectual and heartfelt aspects of that war or any war into one movie.
I:8860;549;Oliver Stone's powerful masterpiece is one of the most realistic portrays of war ever filmed and its mostly because oliver stone was in vietnum and he knows what it is like.
I:8860;550;"two redeeming qualities: the ""do the village"" scene is quite good, simply because its the only well."
I:8860;551;executed psychological examination of the soldiers and it more even.
I:8860;552;"handedly portrays the Vietnamese
I:8860;553;Any vets out there, I thank you.
I:8860;554;They're intelligent, honest, and original.
I:8860;555;Real life and real people are about shades of grey.
I:8860;556;what a real film about vietnam would show is ordinary people doing a tough job day after day and doing the best they could.
I:8860;557;about the only thing this film got right were the uniforms.
I:8860;558;This Better Than Full Metal Jacket Movie Stars Charlie Sheen and Tom Berenger.
I:8860;559;The heart of the film is it's story and characters.
I:8860;560;Charlie Sheen gives his best film performance as new recruit Chris Taylor, a rich kid who passes on his opportunity to go to college instead of Vietnam because he doesn't think that only the poor kids should have to fight.
I:8860;561;Willem Dafoe is Sgt Elias, who smokes dope back at camp, but in the field is quick on his feet, witty and wise, and compassionate to his fellow man.
I:8860;562;Barnes, and the soldiers loyal to him, want to take their revenge on the whole village.
I:8860;563;headed and believe that many of these peasants had nothing to do with it.
I:8860;564;the film ends with a virtuoso sequence in which the Platoon entrenches themselves in the face of a vastly larger advancing North Vietnamese force.
I:8860;565;oliver Stone's movie takes place among the common soldiers and all of the politics of the Vietnam War occur somewhere else.
I:8860;566;I have family members in the military and I have friends who served in Vietnam.
I:8860;567;Their reports about the struggle in the jungle is accurate based on what I've sen in the movie and vice versa.
I:8860;568;This movie is very raw and very realistic.
I:8860;569;PLATOON is a Viet Nam movie that is an outstanding film.
I:8860;570;The movie brings the war home to the viewer and the viewer gets the feeling that they are they.
I:8860;571;This is a classic movie that the viewer will want to watch over and over again.
I:8860;572;it is realistic and shows how our boys are good but with bad undertones
I:8860;573;and heartbreaking this should be required viewing for anyone in their junior year of high school.
I:8860;574;platoon is an outstanding movie.
I:8860;575;It delivers great should have won oscar award performances from Dafoe and Berenger, but Sheen did an amazing job to.
I:8860;576;this film will always keep you at the each of your seat and wanting more.
I:8860;577;I also recommend Born On The Fourth of July, another Oliver Stone film.
I:8860;578;Platoon is a very powerful film and in my opinion Oliver Stone is an outstanding director.
I:8860;579;Platoon captures the heart of the Vietnam war.
I:8860;580;It shows you a side of war most movies dont it shows you the dark side.
I:8860;581;Sure we can disagree over some of the details but I think it is an excellent retrospective of the times and the war.
I:8860;582;This movie is one of my favorites!
I:8860;583;The movie is sensational and the acting is superior!
I:8860;584;Oliver Stone made these actors go through a two week basic training regiment so they not only look the part, they FEEL the part as well.
I:8860;585;Oliver Stone's magnum opus should be required viewing for all political hawks and 18.24 year.
I:8860;586;"if you love this film it's imperative that you get the ""Special Edition""."
I:8860;587;it's well worth the few bucks extra.
I:8860;588;A good movie, sending was great, I have to complain about, everything was perfect.
I:8860;589;in my opinion is the most realistic and insightful film done on Vietnam War.
I:8860;590;"His hard growing up: as a man and as a soldier
I:8860;591;photography by Robert Richardson ( a usual Stone's collaborator) is very good.
I:8860;592;a word for the final battle: superlative realism and great action cinematography.
I:8860;593;a film recommended for everyone that wants to have a sight of what war really is and a realistic, if controversial, account of Vietnam War.
I:8860;594;This is a very fine piece of 'war critic' movie.
I:8860;595;It is one of the best until Private Ryan.
I:8860;596;Otherwise if you want to breathe the atmosphere of Vietnam this is an excellent choice.
I:8860;597;This film won 4 Oscars deservedly.
I:8860;598;It is by far the best Stone movie.
I:8860;599;Stone gives his message against War in Vietnam, but without forgetting one essential point: you must give a message, but the mesage must be included in a good script !
I:8860;600;Dafoe is fantastic, Berenger is in practically his only great part in his career.
I:8860;601;A couple of memorable looking scenes and some shock value plot points got this film splashed on the cover of every magazine and on to the Academy awards.
I:8860;602;Full Metal Jacket came out roughly the same time and is the far better movie.
I:8860;603;Intense portrayal of the Vietnam War from the vantage of an enlisted soldier.
I:8860;604;It's a very gritty drama about the waning morality and the alteration of values and the psychological toll the war played on those there and how they evolved to cope.
I:8860;605;"A daring, emotionally charged, and powerful war movie that breaks down all the rules and boundaries, ""Platoon"" is a film like no other."
I:8860;606;inspired by his involvement in the Vietnam War, writer and director Oliver Stone paints an honest and brutal movie about the terrible war.
I:8860;607;Tom Berenger, William Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, and many other famous names star in this fantastic and heart.
I:8860;608;breaking film, and give those like me who have never seen war a horrifying picture.
I:8860;609;oliver Stone executes the movie with so much authenticity and care.
I:8860;610;I believe that he was very honest in his own portrayal of what he saw and experienced.
I:8860;611;I think he did a spectacular job of orchestrating it all.
I:8860;612;the actors were great too.
I:8860;613;William Dafoe is brilliant in his role, as usual.
I:8860;614;And Charlie Sheen did a outstanding job as the nave and emotionally.
I:8860;615;Everybody was great in their roles, is what it all comes down to.
I:8860;616;There are cool special features such as commentaries, an outstanding documentary, the theatrical trailer and TV spots, and a photo gallery.
I:8860;617;All of them really do enrich the movie and I'm glad they were included.
I:8860;618;"a while back I said that I thought ""Black Hawk Down"" was the best war movie I had ever seen."
I:8860;619;"I now think that ""Platoon"" is by far the best war movie I have ever seen, and I have a feeling it will be the best war movie that I ever will see."
I:8860;620;It's going to be hard to top it, no doubt about it.
I:8860;621;Platoon is one of those movies I think everyone should see at some point in their lives.
I:8860;622;It's an important, emotional, powerful, and gripping film.
I:8860;623;The special edition of Platoon is special for a couple of reasons.
I:8860;624;Oliver Stone gives you that autobiographical insight into where he was at not only during the making of the film, but when he lived the film.
I:8860;625;While the film isn't gospel it gives you a look into the evolution of a human being into an animalistic automaton.
I:8860;626;There is a line King uses as he's leaving before the climactic battle.
I:8860;627;This film tells hard, but honest truths.
I:8860;628;I think Platoon is the greatest movie of all times.
I:8860;629;Makes you think about what's really important in life.
I:8860;630;Most people would rather not have death lingering over their heads but there is a reason that 91% of people enjoyed it (on rotten tomatoes) and that's because it's a good film.
I:8860;631;Anybody should see this movie, I have watched it once a year since I was ten and I still am moved every time.
I:8860;632;we watched it and lived it and this is very much like it.
I:8860;633;Before my tour in Afghanistan this movie was just a cool war flick with good acting and intense action.
I:8860;634;This is one of the great war movies of all time.
I:8860;635;Seeing it again on Blu ray is all the more special.
I:8860;636;Oliver Stone is a very good Director.
I:8860;637;His early movies like Platoon and Wall Street were great.
I:8860;638;Here in Platoon though it's just great story telling.
I:8860;639;He offers poignant observations about the war in the form of letters he writes to his family.
I:8860;640;Through his eyes we realize that Vietnam is a deadly and surreal world.
I:8860;641;Later he will come across the more likable and compassionate Sgt. Elias(Willem Dafoe).
I:8860;642;Also worth mentioning is a brief but brilliant role played by Dale Dye.
I:8860;643;Director Stone was wise to actually give him a part.
I:8860;644;In a small but noteworthy performance he plays Captain Harris .
I:8860;645;there is a social dynamic that is noticeable.
I:8860;646;Private Taylor's platoon is full of interesting and diverse individuals shaped by the turbulent times.
I:8860;647;Platoon has many memorable and intense battle sequences and I would put the film in the top 10, possibly top 5 war movies of all time.
I:8860;648;"Oliver Stone's ""Platoon,"" shocked a nation eager for an honest war film."
I:8860;649;A film in which veterans of the Vietnam War, found it too much to bear, got up in the middle of the film at theaters across the nation, and left.
I:8860;650;The second of the three truly captivating Vietnam films released between 79.87 (Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now are the others, both done by unique directors) In addition, this film put Stone on the map, and intriguingly enough put another Sheen in the jungle.
I:8860;651;the story, for those who do not know, takes place around Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), a new, well.
I:8860;652;This is certainly an action packed movie, showing the conflict between enemies and US soldiers.
I:8860;653;Transaction was flawless, product is exceptional.
I:8860;654;This is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past.
I:8860;655;Keith David plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this is definitely his best role.
I:8860;656;Overall this is my favorite movie of all time.
I:8860;657;i just have the old special edition, not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very nice.
I:8860;658;It is a great making of.
I:8860;659;I'll tell you right now that when it comes to war movies, Oliver Stone doesn't joke around.
I:8860;660;Out of all the movies i've seen of his, W., JFK, Born on the Fourth of July, this one is the best, and overall the darkest as well.
I:8860;661;The acting is successful, although no oscar winning performances were given out.
I:8860;662;Great acting, intense music score by The Era, and great set direction.
I:8860;663;Detailed and shown dramatically, ever moment of this movie is intense.
I:8860;664;"It portrays soldiers as ""baby killers"" and pot heads."
I:8860;665;It is very much so the popular stereo type for depicting soldiers including our men and women serving in uniform, as monsters with no regard for human life.
I:8860;666;That they are emotionless, trigger happy, non.
I:8860;667;I hope one day people can see the truth that soldiers are humans.
I:8860;668;IF you wanna see movies that are accurate and truthful I recommend Band of Brothers, Hamburger Hill, Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam.
I:8860;669;Ranks as one of the most interesting and thought provoking war movies of all time.
I:8860;670;I loved this movie for a number of reasons.
I:8860;671;One, i'm a big Sheen fan.
I:8860;672;Stone, i think this was great.
I:8860;673;While the film doesn't quite have the impact it did back in the 80's , it still holds up very well.
I:8860;674;It is still one of the best war films and it leaves you thinking in silence as the credits role.
I:8860;675;the transfer looks very good on the special edition and the extras are interesting, but it would be nice to see an unedited version someday, with all of Depp's footage put back into the film.
I:8860;676;Bored out of my mind.
I:8860;677;Possibly the most authentic Hollywood film to ever display the horrors of the Vietnam war, Oliver Stone's Platoon is a haunting, violent masterpiece that never lets go of the viewer from beginning to end.
I:8860;678;The ensemble cast (which includes Keith David, Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, John C. McGinley, Kevin Dillon, Tony Todd, and Stone himself) is more than memorable, and there are plenty of scenes that are both haunting and unforgettable.
I:8860;679;This movie tells us that there is nothing beautiful or even remotely positive about about fighting in a war, soldiers are just doing their part for their country, they are fighting for the freedom of the United States.
I:8860;680;i would highly recommend this movie to, well everyone.
I:8860;681;I hope that you all watch this movie and understand the themes being told here.
I:8860;682;Oliver Stone developed a good sense of the war in his limited time frame of this picture as he shows how soldiers can become enemies to each other as quickly as they were friends to begin.
I:8860;683;Overall, this picture is one heck of a movie no matter what anyone states and I ask you to please see it for yourselves before your quick to judge on what people state about it.
I:8860;684;Definitely, a movie that deserves recognition for good acting and a good dialogue which most movies now a days lack one or the other.
I:8860;685;Platoon is O. stone's symbolic and sensual insight into the human soul and psyche .
I:8860;686;much deeper and realistic than Freudian, Jungian or religious ones.
I:8860;687;But through Tom Berenger's brilliant acting, mind the expression in his eyes when he sees his guys killed .
I:8860;688;In fact, the two have much in common, both being strong.
I:8860;689;inch scar on my body and I can tell much about the way it changes your life and views.
I:8860;690;"I pressed OK to indicate YES, and received the ""Prohibited"" symbol."
I:8860;691;It's frozen, in other words.
I:8860;692;Although Oliver Stone's critical reflections in Platoon are unique and moving, they are more symbolic renditions of the conflict.
I:8860;693;The movie seeks to show the various physical and idelogical struggles that moved and shaped the American public during the Vietnam War.
I:8860;694;The character played by DeFoe has a liking for Sheen's as he sees the same man in him when he first joined the war.
I:8860;695;the conflict between Barnes and Elias seems to reflect the deeper social divisions at home.
I:8860;696;"Elias is the conscience and voice of wisdom in the film
I:8860;697;"overall a touching movie more focused on symbolism and imagery than other films such as Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket 
I:8860;698;I think the acting is superb and very realistic (according to people that I know who were in Vietnam).
I:8860;699;their are a handful of Vietnam era war movies which I have seen, This one ,is one of the best.
I:8860;700;In the first minutes of the movie I knew it was 'real' .
I:8860;701;And everything after that reinforced my initial impression.
I:8860;702;Fear, anger, survival instinct, love of your brother .
I:8860;703;All of that is true, and the positive and negative do not cancel one another .
I:8860;704;That is how it always has been and always will be.
I:8860;705;this movie shows both sides .
I:8860;706;platoon is the best movie I have seen about the Vietnam war .
I:8860;707;It is another fictional account that is 'true' .
I:8860;708;I enjoy this movie like a comedy ,that scene where their getting high still makes me smile,william dafoe rocked here and in spiderman
I:8860;709;anyways this movie, like all really good Vietnam films, really took some time to take in.
I:8860;710;this is one hell of an engaging film, full of everything you could find in a divided war.
I:8860;711;Everything to make an interesting movie, well, here you have it.
I:8860;712;By the middle ATLEAST you will create some emotion towards this, as it is nearly as real as it comes.
I:8860;713;from the first scenes of the bodies of fallen soldiers, past the heart.
I:8860;714;racing night ambush, through Elias' majestic.
I:8860;715;charlie Sheen was perfect in this movie.
I:8860;716;middle Chris who battles for proper glory but only finds that war isn't all about glory, it's about staying alive and making it back home.
I:8860;717;Great movie and great steaming!
I:8860;718;A classic I love the actor Berenger, the duel with Willem Dafoe is intenseOliver Stone has created a master pieceThank you
I:8860;719;"The tag line for the movie is, ""the only casualty of war is innocence,"" and the film makes good on this tag line."
I:8860;720;if you have a strong stomach and a desire to learn about the brutality of war, I think this film is for you.
I:8860;721;Regardless, it has earned its place among the best movies of all time for its brutal, realistic portrayal of The Vietnam War.
I:8860;722;Platoon definately stands out as one of the most beautiful and finest war movies ever made.
I:8860;723;Willem Dafoe (in his best screen performance) portrays Sgt. Elias, a skilled veteran who no longer believes in the war, but continues to do so.
I:8860;724;this may be the best film about Vietnam ever, but it's hard to tell.
I:8860;725;Platoon is told from the point of view of the narrator, a 'fresh.
I:8860;726;Taylor was actually in college, and lived in a well.
I:8860;727;Elias is a compassionate, yet highly skilled, leader who truly cares about his men while Barnes is a dark, iron.
I:8860;728;That, alone, makes this a standout film.
I:8860;729;The movie is a classic.
I:8860;730;A good war movie must also send a message and this movie did it.
I:8860;731;Like at the final words in the movie: the enemy is within us.
I:8860;732;Excellent, others must see, gives a real account of what War was like in Nam !
I:8860;733;the top of the line actors put the viewer in the actual combat of the war in viet nam.
I:8860;734;worth your while to watch it.
I:8860;735;realalistic a great movie that covers the trails of our men that fought for our country and gave there lives
I:8860;736;The comentary by Oliver Stone and his advisor give great perspective into the movie and the Vietnam war.
I:8860;737;A great film about Vietnam.
I:8860;738;Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger, and Charlie Sheen gave incredible performances.
I:8860;739;A great depiction about life in vietnam and the impact it had on the characters of the movie.
I:8860;740;Platoon is the definitive movie about the American GI combat experience during the Vietnam War.
I:8860;741;"some critics prefer the greater realism and believability of ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""Hamburger Hill"", both of which were released soon after 1986."
I:8860;742;"But ""Platoon"" is the original, must."
I:8860;743;In my opinion, it's Oliver Stone's best picture.
I:8860;744;The acting, the storyline, the music, the realism, its all there.
I:8860;745;This movie is based on Mr Stone's first hand Vietnam war experience and is shot from a soldier's point of view.
I:8860;746;this movie is up there with Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter
I:8860;747;Platoon is Writer/Director Oliver Stone's highly autobiographical exploration of the Vietnam War.
I:8860;748;the film is a landmark in America coming to terms with this controversial war.
I:8860;749;the low budget nature of the film helps to give it an even greater sense of realism.
I:8860;750;"It has a gritty authenticity and Stone certainly succeeds in making us understand what it was like to be a ""grunt"" down in the mud."
I:8860;751;Platoon is beautifully shot and the battle sequences are brilliantly staged.
I:8860;752;altogether this is an extraordinary achievement by Stone.
I:8860;753;the technical adviser on the film who also has a small but crucial part as a commanding officer .
I:8860;754;This is the best war film ever.
I:8860;755;Platoon is more ralistic and entertaining and Apocalyspse Now is on for to long.
I:8860;756;Oliver Stone's Platoon is one of the best and most powerful of all war pictures.
I:8860;757;It is the best movie ever made about the Vietnam war.
I:8860;758;Stone's film is gritty, frighteningly realistic and incredibly powerful.
I:8860;759;The screenplay is brilliant and doesn't fall into the trap that other war films fall into, where the violence turns into a fun experience and fighting seems cool.
I:8860;760;The cinematography by Robert Richardson (JFK, Natural Born Killers) is rich and gritty, giving more feeling to already great material.
I:8860;761;The characters are believable and convincing.
I:8860;762;It's great work because Stone himself went to Vietnam, so he has a better idea of what happened than Francis Ford Coppola when he made Apocalypse Now (which is also a great movie).
I:8860;763;Platoon is mesmerizing, powerful, effective, disturbing and even philosophical.
I:8860;764;It is one of Stone's greatest works.
I:8860;765;He ignites the screen with passion.
I:8860;766;The music is incredibly moving.
I:8860;767;No other director has made better films about Vietnam than Stone, who's Born On The Fourth Of July and Heaven And Earth followed Platoon, and opened our eyes to greater clarity.
I:8860;768;Platoon vibrates with realism and energy.
I:8860;769;A very special motion picture.
I:8860;770;Oliver Stone Portrayed it perfect.
I:8860;771;Platoon is Oliver Stone's semi.
I:8860;772;He is influenced by two of the Platoon's sergeants.
I:8860;773;Platoon is a haunting, brilliant masterpiece.
I:8860;774;Mr. Stone won his second Oscar and first Best Director award and the film was named Best Picture.
I:8860;775;"white cast (a good few with strong ""hick"" accents) for Sgt. Bob's half is a bit heavy."
I:8860;776;handed, but the point is still solid.
I:8860;777;this is also probably a really good film to watch just to cast light on a lot of what happens in Stone's other films.
I:8860;778;"Ultimately this is the only Stone film I've seen so far that I've felt comfortable calling a ""Stone film"" because of his strong and specific approach to it."
I:8860;779;Platoon is an film written and directed by Oliver Stone.
I:8860;780;A very intense movie, everything is well done from the acting, cinematography, and camera work.
I:8860;781;"the acting is what probably makes ""Platoon"" such a riveting story."
I:8860;782;Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger as the two sergeants are so good in their roles but Charlie Sheen is who shines in his role as Chris Taylor.
I:8860;783;Keith David as King was also very good as Taylor's almost only friend.
I:8860;784;i actually give this movie 3 and 1/2 stars but put 4 stars.
I:8860;785;The reason is mostly because it's rated R. Because I'm 15 years old, I probably don't know much about Vietnam or war but the movie was a bit too violent and the language is very strong.
I:8860;786;Yet I found the acting done exceptionally well done.
I:8860;787;This is the best movie about Vietnam ever.
I:8860;788;well acted with a memorable score.
I:8860;789;along with a decent cast.
I:8860;790;More truth than fiction in the characters.
I:8860;791;When I saw this in the theater, I found myself screaming at the screen.
I:8860;792;On one hand this movie it is a masterful, creative work of art.
I:8860;793;a beautifully filmed, superbly acted, and skillfully directed film.
I:8860;794;It is signeed by Oliver Stone, a Veteran with the 25th Inf.
I:8860;795;the picture is probably the best feature.
I:8860;796;It, for the most part is very clean, crisp and clear.
I:8860;797;In fact, Hamburger Hill has said to have had the most realistic Vietnam sounds effects ever.
I:8860;798;the extras on this disc though are pretty good.
I:8860;799;"The ""Tour of the Inferno"" documentary was very interesting and really dove deep into Oliver Stone's vision and experiences while filming the picture in the Phillipines during the Ferdinand coup in 1985."
I:8860;800;the movie in itself, was a great movie for its time, but I think it may have been surpassed with newer films.
I:8860;801;"having said that this ""coming of age"" story about a volunteer grunt on his first tour is inspiring, moving and memorable in its exploration of two poles."
I:8860;802;charlie sheen was never better (except maybe wall street) and tom berenger and willem dafoe also give two of their best performances.
I:8860;803;The movie had a good story line with the good actors and portrayed atrocities that happened in the Vietnam War.
I:8860;804;This is one of my mom's favorite movies.
I:8860;805;In some of his better work, mainly The Doors and Natural Born Killers, Oliver Stone uses a lot of effort to show the effect that the plot is having on the rest of the world.
I:8860;806;In The Doors, we see footage of Vietnam because it was transpiring at the same time.
I:8860;807;Oliver Stone does better work in the 90's.
I:8860;808;And if it is this verite that compels the film, it the acting that keeps it focused.
I:8860;809;The supporting cast is tight and the three main players (Sheen, Berenger and Dafoe) are outstanding.
I:8860;810;Stone really inspired these men and brought out indelible performances.
I:8860;811;the intensity of this work is severe.
I:8860;812;It is commensurate with a good horror film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, but in this case the horror is all too real.
I:8860;813;That scene has affected me like few scenes ever have, and it always takes me a few minutes to recover from it.
I:8860;814;It is one of the most powerful film moments I have ever seen.
I:8860;815;And Stone's choice of `Aidiago For Strings' for the background music was very perceptive.
I:8860;816;Some were a proper Olive Drab, others, bright green.
I:8860;817;Arguably the best war movie ever made, Oliver Stone's foray into the jungles of the Phillipines produced a classic.
I:8860;818;the commentary by Dale Dye is much more informative and tells a bit more of what was done to make the kids behave as a rifle company.
I:8860;819;This documentary can stand on its own and is better than most of the behind the scenes documentaries.
I:8860;820;May rank right up there with Hearts of Darkness and gives us insight into Oliver Stone and his resolve.
I:8860;821;(Stone)walks that fine line between genius and explosion of the mind.
I:8860;822;The documentary alone is worth the price of admission.
I:8860;823;I'll start this critique off by declaring that I love this movie.
I:8860;824;There are so many great things to say about this movie, and as far as I am concerned, not too many negatives that I can think of.
I:8860;825;For starters, Platoon is a strong number one as my favorite Vietnam war film of all time.
I:8860;826;Its message was simple, yet powerful.
I:8860;827;For a story so emotionally impactful, how can it also be so entertaining?
I:8860;828;And I give all the credit to the incredible cast of young guys that made up the infantry unit that the film centers around.
I:8860;829;I'm pretty sure it was not as fantastic when it first came out because half of those guys had not yet made names for themselves and become the enormous stars that they are today, especially a fresh faced Johnny Depp.
I:8860;830;But I was still pleasantly surprised to see so many great actors, and even in their youth they cranked out some high caliber, phenomenal performances.
I:8860;831;charlie Sheen was a perfect choice as our impressionable lead, Chris.
I:8860;832;Another one of my favorites was Keith David as King.
I:8860;833;And another fantastic performance that is officially an addition to my list of Favorite Movie Villains was Tom Berenger as Sgt. Barnes.
I:8860;834;I felt like Platoon filled that gap perfectly.
I:8860;835;Platoon is just an all around excellent war film, in my opinion.
I:8860;836;Still, this is a classic, and it definitely deserved every award it received.
I:8860;837;platoon is a classic, and I'm sure whoever I'm lucky enough to have reading my late review has already seen it and is aware of how great the film is.
I:8860;838;What's more important here it the transfer.
I:8860;839;It's sharper than ever, detailed, and the colors are very well represented.
I:8860;840;It's decent, and gets the job done.
I:8860;841;The extras round out a very good Blu.
I:8860;842;ray package with a nice variety of features.
I:8860;843;Hollywood has always had very diverse angles when it comes to making movies about the Vietnam war.
I:8860;844;"Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" remains the greatest, the most realistic and haunting depiction ever."
I:8860;845;The heart of the impact of the movie lies in the fact that Stone served in Vietnam, can't shake it and used his brilliance as an artist to depict his experiences and the experiences of many, in one of the greatest war films ever made.
I:8860;846;Platoon is real and alive, taking us deep into the jungles and never ceases to show us the realities of what happened, ultimately evoking the feelings of many veterans who came back either shattered or changed forever by a senseless war.
I:8860;847;The photography by Robert Richardson is gritty but yet also rich when capturing the vast jungle landscapes.
I:8860;848;Charlie Sheen gives probably his best performance here and sometimes we can easily relate to him.
I:8860;849;"Platoon also stands as a very influential film and if you look closely at it's style and pacing, you realize films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" are the descendants of ""Platoon,"" those two other movies have a lot to owe to this one."
I:8860;850;This is a magnificent tribute to those who fought and a searing document for the new generations watching the movie, a lesson about where we should not tread and the power of trying to survive and how life goes on.
I:8860;851;A powerful masterpiece, timeless and epic.
I:8860;852;Such talent telling a story in this war.
I:8860;853;A young Berrenger, Dafoe, Sheen and even a cameo by Stone.
I:8860;854;It gives a vivid picture of Vietnam in 1967.
I:8860;855;"Great movie""Platoon"",a good study of war."
I:8860;856;we see a young man who never saw death or war in his own eyes until now in his life, but sees death, in eyes of others.
I:8860;857;"one of the best war film I have ever seen in my lifetime,best true war film to see is ""All Quiet On The Western Front""."
I:8860;858;Oliver Stones harrowing and convincingly brutal Vietnam war film won best picture for it's startling reality.
I:8860;859;his two commanding officers Elias and Barnes played by Willan Defoe who won best supporting actor and Tom Berringer.
I:8860;860;alias who has lost faith in the war but not in his men or morality , Barnes who the war has gotten to him so much that he is an unfeeling souless monster he is the perfect exampleof the tragedy of Vietnam for Stone to do this is brillant and real.
I:8860;861;Charlie Sheen is Chris, a rich college boy who dropped out of college in the late 1960's to volunteer for combat duty in Vietnam.
I:8860;862;and his noble thoughts are dashed.
I:8860;863;"movies, excepting truly powerful films which weren't really out to tell the story of the war (Like ""Coming Home"" and ""The Deer Hunter"")."
I:8860;864;this is my favorite movie and has been since I seen it.
I:8860;865;I love the movie Platoon.
I:8860;866;It is probably my favorite Vietnam War.
I:8860;867;"in fact it was probably added when they released the ""special addition"""
I:8860;868;Platoon is an excellent movie.
I:8860;869;Stone put out all he could to create this wonderful masterpiece.
I:8860;870;If you like war movies, this is hands down an undeniably great movie.
I:8860;871;from beginning to end you will be so enveloped in the movie, i promise you wont know what is going on around you.
I:8860;872;this has worked its way into my top 10 Movies of all time.
I:8860;873;thanks for sending this in time for holidays .
I:8860;874;I own this already and am now sending it as gifts.
I:8860;875;The movie arrived promptly and in perfect condition.
I:8860;876;Platoon is a powerful and thought evoking American war film that depicts the brutality and horror of the Vietnam War.
I:8860;877;In this film, Sergeant Barnes, who is a brutal and embittered, and Sergeant Elias, who is compassionate towards his men, are rivals.
I:8860;878;This film was realistic in a sense that it portrayed the dehumanizing consequences of war.
I:8860;879;"In ""Platoon"", the emotions and conditions in which soldiers were faced with were portrayed so that they were both realistic and believable."
I:8860;880;"in ""Platoon"", the cinematography was average and nothing extraordinary."
I:8860;881;Nevertheless, Stone managed to portray the emotions and conditions both powerfully and effectively.
I:8860;882;The performances of actors Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe were great and well suited for their roles.
I:8860;883;"setting aside the poor audio and the sensationalized depictions of the war, ""Platoon"" is a riveting and thought provoking film that raises awareness and relevant questions regarding the atrocious aspects of war as well as the psychological effects the Vietnam War had on soldiers."
I:8860;884;Strong visceral filmmaking from fearless director Stone, who based the film on his own GI experiences.
I:8860;885;"Highly acclaimed
I:8860;886;Its very realistic, its the second most realistic war movie ever (saving private ryan is the first of course).
I:8860;887;Its got good performances from the three main characters dafoe, berenger, and sheen.
I:8860;888;Its sad and funny at times, very dramatic when dafoe gets shot.
I:8860;889;"it's my opinion that a film should never consciously try to emotionally influence an audience
I:8860;890;Now, I love Oliver Stone just as much as the next guy, but right from the opening titles I couldn't help but feel that this was Stone's attempt at tugging every string in the audience's collective heart.
I:8860;891;The music is beautiful but the way it's used gives the film's emotion no room to grow.
I:8860;892;One minute he's doing fine.
I:8860;893;As I said, the music is first rate.
I:8860;894;And Willem Defoe is perfectly on target (sorry for the pun).
I:8860;895;all in all, I wanted to enjoy this film.
I:8860;896;rated HamBurger Hill and brilliant Full Metal Jacket.
I:8860;897;It just makes it that all the more real.
I:8860;898;So much so that I've had to give it a rest over the last few years.
I:8860;899;why is it so good?Perhaps because it is the most realistic (certainly Vietnam) war movie ever made.
I:8860;900;there are quite a few scenes in this film, such as when the Charlie Sheen character wakes up in the middle of the night (in the jungle), that are wonderfully done.
I:8860;901;This piece of music alone adds an extra dimension to the scenes it is used in.
I:8860;902;A very haunting and sad piece of music.
I:8860;903;the ending of the film is perhaps the only weak point, but it is a minor quibble about a very powerful and moving film.
I:8860;904;also, likening the experience of viewing Platoon to Star Wars is an incredible insult.
I:8860;905;Oliver Stone had been there and he got it right on the fighting.
I:8860;906;In return he gets the Oscar for directing and his film gets best picture along the way
I:8860;907;This is probably one of the best Vietnam movies out there.
I:8860;908;It has a moving soundtrack, great cinematography and you find yourself engrossed and involved when watching the development of one naive recruit as he becomes hardened by the war and his experiences.
I:8860;909;A brilliant film, that should be watched by all.
I:8860;910;this movie is my favorite movie of all time its awesome and enhancing it for BLU RAY was the best, but when i went to pre order it i wasn't happy to see that it said it was by Charlie Sheen instead of Oliver Stone.
I:8860;911;"Better yet, watch it and don't talk to anyone for a few days
I:8860;912;For those of us who only knew of the Vietnam War from A little High School History , Television , and A few Books ,this Movie showed A new , eye opening story about this Cvil War , that we got invovled in , and lost A lot of great people in .
I:8860;913;type war crime by the very nature of his view of our illegitimate role in Vietnam.
I:8860;914;Stone infuses the story with humanity and heroes.
I:8860;915;chris is a hero and a survivor.
I:8860;916;A final battle also shows something that rarely, if ever, happened.
I:8860;917;In actuality, they won all the battles against the NVA.
I:8860;918;He also discredits a lot of his buddies who fought with him.
I:8860;919;type war crime by the very nature of his view of our illegitimate role in Vietnam.
I:8860;920;Stone infuses the story with humanity and heroes.
I:8860;921;chris is a hero and a survivor.
I:8860;922;A final battle also shows something that rarely, if ever, happened.
I:8860;923;In actuality, they won all the battles against the NVA.
I:8860;924;He also discredits a lot of his buddies who fought with him.
I:8860;925;This is a mature critique of the stark and horrifying realities of armed conflict.
I:8860;926;It is also a bold production that forever changed how Hollywood would make war films in the future.
I:8860;927;Watching his characters deteriorate into savagery because of the chaos that surrounds them is a sobering viewing experience.
I:8860;928;Stone also adds a unique dimension to the film by emphasizing how the Vietnam experience turned American soldiers against each other.
I:8860;929;of documentary was great to watch, and Dale Dye's audio commentary alone is worth the price of admission.
I:8860;930;Platoon recreates a series of realistic, lingering images of Vietnam.
I:8860;931;The images evoke emotions that are raw and bleeding.
I:8860;932;If you were there, you know, and the images will haunt you.
I:8860;933;In that sense, Stone succeeds brilliantly.
I:8860;934;acted.Yet for all the compelling elements of the story.
I:8860;935;it is the images that linger.
I:8860;936;Intense battle scenes and very realistic war sequences.
I:8860;937;I highly recommend it even though it is a bit disturbing.
I:8860;938;Berenger and the scar face was good acting.
I:8860;939;And Sheen did a good job as new recruit grunt.
I:8860;940;This was Oliver Stone's career highpoint and it is a technically proficient movie.
I:8860;941;It is most importantly an effective political statement.
I:8860;942;this movie is the best movie that have been moved me very much even now.
I:8860;943;but the great points of this movie is not the prominent reapperance of the war only, that is, what was mixed human drama to this movie.
I:8860;944;In addition to them, by being included human dramas, the movie became a great movie.
I:8860;945;He says this movie is one of the best representations of how it was over their.
I:8860;946;This is one of those movies you can watch over and over again.
I:8860;947;This is a must see movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I:8860;948;Alot of my friends saw this movie and alot of my relatives who were in the war kept telling me to see it.
I:8860;949;I find a reat appeal to them.
I:8860;950;Platoon a movie written by a man who lived through vietnam.
I:8860;951;This movie is a must for everyone so we may learn from the experience and it not happen again.
I:8860;952;A Movie well worth the Academy Awards it got and all the praise from movie goers and Veterans alike
I:8860;953;Actually, a must have for anyone who enjoys a good picture.
I:8860;954;"All star cast, great story, truly moving in an emotional sense (watch the Bunker Scene, with Smokey Robinson's ""Tracks of My Tears"")."
I:8860;955;Platoon was brilliantly acted and directed, taking in several awards in 1986 including Best Picture.
I:8860;956;Charlie Sheen gives an outstanding performance as a young Vietnam soldier who not only battles the enemy, but the fear within himself.
I:8860;957;Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger do an excellent job of portraying sergeants who are in conflict.
I:8860;958;What makes this film so great is the realism brought out within the movie.
I:8860;959;Oliver Stone (writer and director), really does a great job of showing the effects the war had on the soldiers.
I:8860;960;Platoon is a drama that gives you an experience of the horror that was Vietnam.
I:8860;961;The excellent writing and superb acting makes this film hard to forget.
I:8860;962;I recommend this film to everybody, even if you don't find interest in war.
I:8860;963;On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 9.
I:8860;964;This film is rated R for strong language and violence.
I:8860;965;A 1986 depiction of the American forces in Vietnam, Oliver Stone's Platoon gives incredible insight into the lunacy caused from war with its emotional and harsh representation of American soldiers slipping into darkness during their tour of duty through Vietnam.
I:8860;966;this classic Vietnam portrayal won four Academy Awards including Best Picture and Director.
I:8860;967;Not for family viewing, Platoon is a classic illustration of the madness brought on by combat, and is for all who want to learn of the Vietnam experience.
I:8860;968;Excellent depiction of what it was like in Vietnam.
I:8860;969;Oliver Stone's own war experience inspired the movie and gave it life.
I:8860;970;i would also recommend Full.
I:8860;971;metal Jacket, We Were Soldiers, and Apocalypse Now!
I:8860;972;"Platoon, a film about a privates tour of duty in Vietnam
I:8860;973;The lines are drawn in a confrontation that will tear the team apart.
I:8860;974;The visuals are both stunning and effective, accurately showing the dense dark jungles of Southeast asia.
I:8860;975;The music is common and powerful which adds to the overall emotional effect.
I:8860;976;Those couple of scenes taken alone could be considered great.
I:8860;977;the music and the visuals compliment each other perfectly.
I:8860;978;but the rest of the movie has little to see.
I:8860;979;In the end credits it said that the film was dedicated to Vietnam veterans.
I:8860;980;I loved the film and so did my boyfriend.
I:8860;981;Platoon remains the best movie ever made about the U. s. involvement in the Vietnam war.
I:8860;982;This is not for the faint of heart but it is still an excellent movie.
I:8860;983;These two are the best performances in the whole movie.
I:8860;984;Also the Adagio for Strings is the perfect music for this movie that helps to show the horror of the war and also the loss of innocence in the soldiers.
I:8860;985;This movie is well worth the price and should not be missed.
I:8860;986;One of the greatest war movies ever made, not just Vietnam!
I:8860;987;The Platoon Documentary showcases interviews with the satrs of the picture, and also Oliver Stone.
I:8860;988;a fantastic addition, and a filmmaker's and film student's best friend!
I:8860;989;We get to see and hear this brilliant filmmaker (Stone) talk about his movie!
I:8860;990;PLATOON is one of the greatest and most moving war films you will ever see.
I:8860;991;It made writer/director Oliver Stone a legend, and remains his greatest film, in my opinion.
I:8860;992;The film, which took in four Academy Awards including Best Picture , is frighteningly realistic, partly due to the fact that it is based on Stone's first.
I:8860;993;"Stone's directing is awesome
I:8860;994;Sheen is great, and the theme, Adagio for Strings , is so perfect for the film you'll never forget it.
I:8860;995;There are few films which can make the horrors of war as depicted in Oliver Stone's masterpiece.
I:8860;996;It's emotional, and manages to maintain it's touching credibility throughout, even with the blockbuster battle at the end.
I:8860;997;Tom Berenger as the twisted CO is superb, and in my opinion his best role.
I:8860;998;And of course Sheen, matching his father for being in a Vietnam film (Apocalypse Now) and does a great job.
I:8860;999;Straight forward but executed to perfection.
I:8860;1000;It simply hits hard, and with a fantastic score (mostly Barber's Adagio For Strings, or Agmus Dei) that really emphasizes the emotions.
I:8860;1001;the best and most realistic war film I have seen, above Apocalypse Now.
I:8860;1002;Willem Dafoe's performance is a tour de force.
I:8860;1003;It's a riveting, compelling movie.
I:8860;1004;The battle sequences are very gritty, graphic, and realistic.
I:8860;1005;despite the negative outlook upon life, the military, and the Vietnam War, PLATOON is probably Oliver Stone's best movie to date.
I:8860;1006;Stone's direction of the film is brilliant from the two.
I:8860;1007;week boot camp the actors endured before principal filming, to the fine details such as the color of the wrapping paper on the cigarettes, to filming in sequence, to recognizing the talent of Johnny Depp, Stone illustrated in PLATOON was that he was a great director and one to be reckoned with.
I:8860;1008;PLATOON won the 1986 Oscar for Best Picture, Stone won the Best Director Oscar, and also received a nomination for Best Original Screenplay.
I:8860;1009;i was surprised and found that I enjoyed PLATOON, though there were several parts of the film that I found myself aghast.
I:8860;1010;Despite this, there are many positive things within the movie.
I:8860;1011;It relies on fully realized and highly watchable characters and what they do in the environment that they are in to tell the story.
I:8860;1012;It's one of the best war films for this reason.
I:8860;1013;Tour of the Inferno the making of documentary is exceptional and is one of the more enjoyable ones I have seen.
I:8860;1014;Not only do you see Sheen, Stone Berenger, but you also get to see Johnny Depp and Forrest Whitaker as well.
I:8860;1015;All of them a great when telling thier stories about the making of the film.
I:8860;1016;The audio commentary by Stone is also a standout.
I:8860;1017;the movie is great, the features are valid and the price is right.
I:8860;1018;This is the best war movie ever.
I:8860;1019;It is better then Saving Private Ryan .
I:8860;1020;The entire film is a piece of cinematic art.
I:8860;1021;If you love war movies, and you collect them, you MUST OWN THIS!
I:8860;1022;Oliver Stone's Platoon transcends the romanticization that so often infuses our thinking about war with a painfully honest portrayal of its dehumanizing effects.
I:8860;1023;taylor becomes aware that he is fighting not only an external enemy, but an inner one as well.
I:8860;1024;Platoon sheds light on the conditions that breed atrocity and the devastating psychological effects of war upon soldiers.
I:8860;1025;"It is not an antiwar film, nor one with a political agenda
I:8860;1026;This film is essentially very good for most people.
I:8860;1027;If you want to experience the real feeling among the battlefield, the Platoon will absolutely not be a good choice.
I:8860;1028;Try Saving Private Ryan !
I:8860;1029;It won best picture for the year and caused many copycat movies that were never as good.
I:8860;1030;This movie is generally a love it or hate kind of thing.
I:8860;1031;acted, particularly by Tom Berenger, whom the viewer comes to despise.
I:8860;1032;It's also interesting to see a young Jonny Depp in a very small role.
I:8860;1033;This is arguably Charlie Sheen's best performance, but that may not be saying much.
I:8860;1034;But this has to be quite possibly the most realistic war film ever made.
I:8860;1035;The reason is probably because director Oliver Stone was a service man in Vietnam.
I:8860;1036;Platoon won academy awards for Best director (Oliver Stone), Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture.
I:8860;1037;Without a doubt, Platoon is one of the greatest war films ever made.
I:8860;1038;"I was a history major, and I still maintain an interest in the subject, and I find Oliver Stone's depiction of war to be far more realistic than that of, say, Steven Spielberg in ""Saving Private Ryan."""
I:8860;1039;For most of them, it's just about survival.
I:8860;1040;The battle scenes aren't as graphically violent as in more recent movies, but they do a good job of capturing the fear and confusion that war can create.
I:8860;1041;More importantly, the story is filled with sharply.
I:8860;1042;drawn characters and moral ambiguity.
I:8860;1043;As a Vietnam combat veteran I found Stone's portrayal of day.
I:8860;1044;Platoon is one of the best Vietnam action dramas ever produced.
I:8860;1045;"Platoon is masterful moviemaking in practically every way and towers over most other Vietnam war flicks, with the sole exception of ""Apocalypse Now"" (the original version)."
I:8860;1046;What works best is the ensemble cast and the numerous memorable characters who all smack of real life .
I:8860;1047;The idea that any filmmaker can effectively bring to life a dozen or more characters like this in a 2.
I:8860;1048;hour film is uncanny to say the least.
I:8860;1049;This is a potent scene spotlighting a band of American warriors, from very diverse racial/ethnic/socio.
I:8860;1050;After the Barnes/Elias fight at the village Barnes is informed by Captain Harris that there will be a full investigation.
I:8860;1051;The scene is filmmaking of the highest order.
I:8860;1052;"He boldly confronts all six with a fascinating rant (""I am reality"") and challenges them to kill him."
I:8860;1053;by contrast, Elias is the compassionate, loving and righteous Christ.
I:8860;1054;bunny (Kevin Dillon) is an interesting character.
I:8860;1055;But, again, he somehow maintains an amiable charm, unlike Tex who comes across wholly venomous.
I:8860;1056;war on the grounds that war films by their nature make war seem fun in an adventurous way.
I:8860;1057;Well, aside from skillfully showing the hard day.
I:8860;1058;the ending shows that Barnes and Elias are figurative of flesh and spirit, the conflicting forces within us all.
I:8860;1059;There are times since I've felt like a child, born of those two fathers.
I:8860;1060;This movie is over 10 years old, but still good.
I:8860;1061;i recommend this movie if u like war movies.
I:8860;1062;There's a lot of bad language (similar to SPR) but it's still good.
I:8860;1063;His screenplay of Platoon took 11 years to become a film, and became what is not only one of the best movies about war, but also a great achievement that compares powerfully with the most impressive movies in cinematic history.
I:8860;1064;The viewers, along with Chris, discover that the Vietnam War is a land with an ever.
I:8860;1065;platoon, like all of Stone's films, is nearly flawless in its making.
I:8860;1066;The cinematography, by the great Robert Richardson, is frankly remarkable.
I:8860;1067;Richardson's work with Platoon is brilliant and captures the violence and threatening feel of war.
I:8860;1068;"In addition, one of the most special aspects of the film is the tremendously haunting and emotionally powerful use of Samuel Barber's ""Adagio for Strings,"" which was arranged and conducted by Georges Delerue (who also provides the original music for the film)."
I:8860;1069;Every performance is delivered with strength and inspiring drama.
I:8860;1070;Sheen, as the disillusioned Chris, is simply amazing and does not render his character as being too solemn or innocent.
I:8860;1071;like Sergeant Elias (who Stone considered having a Native American Indian portray), is convincing and charismatic.
I:8860;1072;Berenger's performance is overshadowing and haunting as the exact opposite of Sergeant Elias, and makes the character of Barnes one of the most memorable villains in cinema.
I:8860;1073;It is an important movie that depicts the horrible nature of war with ardor, and will be remembered and as a classic and an accomplishment that surpasses other movies in its field.
I:8860;1074;This 1986 film won Best Picture, as well as Best Director for Oliver Stone, who also wrote this based on his experiences in the Vietnam War.
I:8860;1075;As the film carries on we slowly see him, as well as his fellow members in the platoon become deadly killing machines.
I:8860;1076;the script, and direction are very well done.
I:8860;1077;In the battlefield, it shows audiences a real battle life.
I:8860;1078;"This movie is very compelling
I:8860;1079;Again, welcome to the world of war!
