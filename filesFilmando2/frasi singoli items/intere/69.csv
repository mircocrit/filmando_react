1;"I have heard for years ""it's the only X rated movie to win best picture!"""
2;I love all types of film, so I'm not being judgemental about it being a drama.
3;The acting perfomances really are great, but that is about it.
4;Like I said good acting, even though Dustin Hoffman does almost the same shtick years later in Rain Man.
5;It's just amazing to me that this movie won best picture.
6;But I also can't see any reason Gladiator won best picture as well.
7;I've been particularly impressed with how fast I received this item.
8;But still a fine character study and a brilliant performance by Dustin Hoffman as Ratso.
9;It's fun to see the seventies captured so accurately if you were actually alive to see them the first time around.
10;the film opens with many close.
11;ups of John Voight's sunny face and blue skies as he heads to New York for (he believes and hopes) a bright future while experiencing images and sounds of exceedingly dark memories.
12;right at the start the viewer is put at unease by hearing what sounds like an older woman moaning with pleasure but then we see it's little boy Joe Buck giving his grandma a back massage after which she gives him a kiss on the cheek.
13;In my opinion this is accomplished by both actor's ability to capture the combination of never standing a chance to win with the lovely wisdom of caring and compassion which leads to their losing streaks.
14;a glimmer in an eye, the move of a brow in response to a questions.
15;that's really acting!I think the late 60's culture was also well done, especially the party toward the end.
16;the other thing about this film's excellence is the dark humor.
17;I frequently laughed at and with the two friends.
18;The acting is amazing in this film precisely because its not the showy .
19;Real people that most of us would just look away from if we saw them on the street.
20;I think maybe they just added it to make it more shocking, more like other films of that period who emphasized physical rather than emotional violence and to make Joe and Ratso's escape more urgent or cause the viewer to pull away from Joe's character to make the end less devestating.
21;these characters were so obviously created with love by the people who made them.
22;and you get a sense that every character you see in the film has a past.
23;I've always wondered about her story).
24;The scenes of interaction between the two main characters especially are incredibly subtle and naturalistic.
25;And the little moments of offbeat humor.
26;never cease to charm me.
27;by the way if you have never read the book you really should.
28;Midnight Cowboy is a good film but not perfect.
29;The best thing about Midnight Cowboy is the acting, Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are electric.
30;Complicated and gritty film but one to see, enjoy!
31;The Amazon review for this movie is right on the dot.
32;town hustler who traps himself in a big city.
33;The human rat reaches the end ofthe line.
34;Its as if the very possiblity of success triggersoff a new round of moral and physical decay.
35;out message film and the message is that workis wrong, being a bum is noble, your problems are not yourown fault ever, drugs are the solution to everything,that the life of a street prostitute is an exciting adventurefull of colorful characters and that its all those ordinaryworking people in the city that look you funny who are hatefuland messed up.

37;And when Ronald Reagan waselected, they were transformed from happy street people intothe suffering homeless.
38;america films, thenmoved on to anti.
39;Even though it has lost a good deal of its original impact, this movie has visually striking scenes and powerful images.
40;the song Everybody Is Talking is very good, and it is a great musical background to the gray streets of New York City.
41;The director John Schlesinger never was known for finesse and subtlety, and this movie proves that he was a risky director.
42;known thanks to his portrayal of Joe Buck, and Dustin Hoffman portrayed a lovable loser with his usual skills.
43;Midnight Cowboy is a very dark film, but intelligent and influential at the same time.
44;Perhaps some elements have lost their original impact, but still this is a powerful movie.
45;This is a timeless classic.
46;I recommend this on Blu ray.
47;in Midnight Cowboy we get a very solid sense of the convergence of those two sets of social interactions.
48;Work, in real life, is the curse of this segment of society.
49;"This film, moreover, despite my ""high sociology"" screed above is worth seeing for the outstanding performances of these two actors early on in their careers."
50;One of the best movies out there.
51;Dustin Hoffman once again proves what a fantastic actor he is.
52;"then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, called ""Ratso"" by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time."
53;You think of him as a scoundrel, but a lovable one (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian) and surprisingly he and Joe become friends, and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such.
54;, and the acting is so believable, you'd never believe Joe Buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor Jon Voight, and Ratso Rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved Dustin Hoffman.
55;It's not the first time they've worked together in lead roles, but the chemistry is so thick and intense.
56;all in all, great movie.
57;"And the soundtrack pretty much consists just of ""Everybody's Talking'"" played all throughout the movie at appropriate times."
58;An odd move, but a great one, as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly.
59;To say that I have never seen `Midnight Cowboy' until this past weekend is rather embarrassing since, well, it is highly considered to be one of the greatest films of all time.
60;Joe moves from Texas to New York, planning on becoming a hustler to make a living.
61;the performances by the two stars is nearly otherworldly, especially Dustin Hoffman, who chews up every scene.
62;Voight is a perfect compliment here, serving up a more subdued and `observational' character.
63;While I would never jump the gun and label either of them `gay', I must say that the film likes to tote the line so.
64;In the end, there is a love between these two men that transcends the boundaries of sexuality, and for that I am truly grateful.
65;This is one for the ages.
66;A completely heartfelt piece of work, amazing performances.
67;This movie is a classic,and in all my movie watching,I had never seen it.
68;The acting was superb and was far ahead of it's timein the subject matter!
69;Iam happy i saw it.
70;The opening sequences illustrate what a wild.
71;Hoffman's Rizzo is a stirringly accurate portrayal of the kind of urban cretins that lurk in many of the allies and coffee shops along the boulevard of broken dreams that is Manhattan.
72;what evolves along with their burgeoning friendship and mutual dependencies is a beautifully travelogue.
73;Rizzo helps learn the lessons of survival on the mean street, and educates Joe well enough for them to finally make an ironic escape that provides an emotional and provocative coda in the closing sequences.
74;"this is a wonderful film, one that never deserved an ""X"" rating since the only thing pornographic about it is the way it portrays people treating other people, and in that sense it is obscene indeed."
75;This is a film that will make you squirm a bit on the couch as the totality of its director's vision plays out, but one you will be glad you sat to experience in its long (over two hours) length.
76;"Most of us avid film fans were shocked when neither Voight nor Hoffman won the Oscar for their performance, which went to John Wayne for ""True Grit"" in an emotional tribute to the Duke's long and illustrious career."
77;This is an edifying and entertaining way to spend a wonderful Saturday evening.
78;And that music, Brings back alot of memories.
79;It was wonderful then and still is.
80;day, but i just thought it was OK.
81;The movie was nominated for 5 Oscars, and won 3, including Best Picture, Best Director (John Schlesinger, who did not attend the ceremony) and Best Writing.
82;The best, to me, was Dustin Hoffman's role, that reminded me a little bit of his role in the movie Rain Man (even though that movie was done later).
83;The movie is, overall, very depressive in its mood.
84;The movie, though, is still very provocative, and tries to touch on some issues that are very well the same nowadays: the isolation of the human being and its survival in the urban environment, and the searching for money as the only one worth value in life.
85;i would hardly recommend this movie to the general public.
86;It was in perfect shape and arrived in a timely manner.
87;I had forgotten how wonderful and poignant this film is.
88;"Describing Hoffman as using a ""stupid acting trick"" shows Mr. Emerson's disdain towards the acting profession and ridicules what is a powerful performance by Hoffman."
89;I strongly recommend the novel by James Leo Herlihy.
90;It is a powerful novel and really is a story about loneliness.
91;The movie is faithful to the novel which is why it's just as powerful.
92;It's probably true that the movie's ending would not be approved today by a major hollywood production company but that's one of the reasons why Midnight Cowboy is so good.
93;And Mr. Emerson, do yourself a favor.
94;joe's Mama has already assured him, his ruddy good looks will sell like hotcakes in Manhattan, that there are love.
95;league management, a service Ratzo will rectify for a fee!
96;reminded how two heavyweight actors, Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, squared.
97;off in a method acting mano a mano and achieved complimentary career peak performances.
98;"to this day, ""Midnight Cowboy"", is the only X. rated film ever, to win an Academy Award for best picture!"
99;Midnight Cowboy is definetly one of the finest films of all time.
100;Deserved winner of the Best Picture Oscar in 1969 it is still the only X rated film to have done so, today it would probably by PG.
101;This film contains the best performance that both Hoffman and Voight ever did.
102;It is truly one of the best and most bizarre love storys ever captured on celluloid.
103;One of the songs in the film Everybody's Talking was a hit while the main theme is extremely haunting and plays on your days after viewing.
104;imaginatively, directed, it is well.
105;acted, especially by Jon Voight, given the material.
106;It is memorable: at least I remember seeing it when it was first released.
107;show once, making fun of the music.
108;my wife and I really enjoyed it!
109;In fact nobody has managed to make anything like his works, they stand.
110;All the absolutely brilliant supporting roles .
111;are brought to life with lightening vividness.
112;They are all are superb performances and are overshadowed by the gargantuan realizations of the two stars.
113;the real star though is Schlesinger.
114;there, got it of my chest.
115;This is one of those movies that we see over and over again because they speak to us in some way.
116;This movie is worth a watch.
117;This movie sends a strong message about the cold, ruthless world we live in.
118;this movie can be fascinating at times, but is a serious movie.
119;Great acting by the stars and Jon was Angela Jolie's father.
120;If a film presents a story with no redeeming qualities is that film worth watching?
121;Timeless issues that confront humanitywith a great sound track.
122;Until American Beauty, this was the last dark film to win the Best Picture Oscar.
123;This was John Schlesinger's last great film (he's been reduced to tripe like Eye for an Eye in recent years) and a perfect way to round out the decade of the 1960s.
124;This is A movie classic although dated by 2013 standards.
125;Acting well done and, of course, the music background is memorable
126;The night of the Oscars for 1969 was quite memorable .
127;the first and only time an X. rated film, largely due to non.
128;explicit scenes involving homosexuality, won best picture.
129;in addition to the superb performances of the two leads, there is a marvelous supporting cast: John McGiver, Barnard Hughes, Brenda Vaccaro among them.
130;John Schlesinger won an Oscar for his direction.
131;ray release got passed me and shows a great improvement in picture and sound.
132;One of the most memorable scenes is the dream sequence of Cowboy Joe just after arriving at Ratso's living quarters, resembling a rat hole, in a condemned building.
133;The dream sequence is in black and white with skillfully created electronic sounds and is both frightening and mesmerizing.
134;the film shows us, in a most disturbing way, New York City at its most decadent and, after more than four decades since its release, maintains its power.
135;"Just observe magazines like ""Graphis,"" ""Aperture,"" ""Flash Art,"" and you will see that it occupies a perennial universe of its own regardless of the larger cultural changes in traditional society."
136;"Midnight Cowboy is an absolute masterpiece managing to lace the darkness and alienation of its world with wonderful humor
I:8444;137;It is a classic, for sure!
I:8444;138;The acting is superb and I love the music!
I:8444;139;It's a very moving story!
I:8444;140;This movie is in my top ten of all times.
I:8444;141;It may still be my favorite Dustin Hoffman performance, though that's pretty hard to determine, since there have been so many memorable performances from this American icon (Little Big Man, Tootsie, Papillon, The Graduate.
I:8444;142;The closing scene is one of the most powerful and moving shots in cinema.
I:8444;143;And the performances from Voigt, Hoffman, and the supporting cast are incredible.
I:8444;144;Disturbing and hurtful in many places but strangely uplifting, Midnight Cowboy will stay with you.
I:8444;145;An absolutely outstanding performance from both actors.
I:8444;146;The plot is very original and has stood the test of time.
I:8444;147;Though not my favorite movie(that nod goes to 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD)this is thee most flawless movie I have ever seen.
I:8444;148;music beginning,middleand end of the film all sewn into one masterpiece of celluloid hasNO FLAWS!!!
I:8444;149;True the flash backs of Joe Bucks youth can be quiteconfusing but I felt it is meant to be.
I:8444;150;Whats true and what is not?Why I feel this film is so great is because of Joe Buck.
I:8444;151;So we follow Joe Buck to the Big Apple wherehe will be a successful $tud.
I:8444;152;I really felt forJon Voight's character he finally finds a friend just to have thatalso taken from him at the end.
I:8444;153;The directingwith the 60's visuals flashbacks black and white sequences and fadesin and outs were the best I have ever seen put to celluloid.
I:8444;154;However if you are one who truly loves allkinds of film than please watch MIDNIGHT COWBOY for it is the bestmovie I have ever seen.
I:8444;155;This is one the of the best and saddest of all time.
I:8444;156;With many classic 60's scenes, and plenty of character development, this film has it all.
I:8444;157;The best acting you could get!
I:8444;158;Emotionally draining and very sad, but a great movie.
I:8444;159;Midnight Cowboy (the name was then contemporaneous slang for a male prostitute) is one of those solid, well.
I:8444;160;made films, from the 1960s that's best recalled than watched.
I:8444;161;It's a good, occasionally very good film.
I:8444;162;It is a good, solid film, and an emotionally enjoyable one, even if what it says about humanity is rather plain.
I:8444;163;Even better than the lead duo is the supporting cast of Sylvia Miles.
I:8444;164;The film won three Oscars.
I:8444;165;for Best Screenplay, Best Picture, and Best Director, but only the last is really justifiable.
I:8444;166;color of Ratso's fantasies, the psychedelic sequences at an Andy Warhol Factory Party"
167;The timeless classic from 1969 is the tale of a good.
168;"Holding onto the notion that in New York live rich women who will ""pay to get it"" the innocent Buck's idealistic vision soon runs face."
169;deficient life together, surviving day by day squatting in a condemned building.
170;realism of this movie is stunning to witness, and if it at times transports us to an outmoded New York of forty years past, then this is countered by the fact that its goings.
171;time of the movie do we see any human warmth and real caring pass from one person to another.
172;the film, though, is simply marvelous.
173;Yet, true to the tone of real life and this celebration of the lightless side of it, dawning tragedy compels Buck to make a choice, stay and seize a shot at success as a gigolo, or be lured off by his loyalties and a sense of doing that which is best for a friend.
174;a great motion picture, no doubt, but one that takes a deep emotional toll on anyone who watches it.
175;It delivers some of the most stunning performances ever.
176;It has been, and remains, one my top five movies.
177;Others have been bumped from the list as new movies come along, but this one is anchored as a great.
178;This film was deeply moving from my perspective because it was so well produced.
179;The subtleties and nuances are what truly distinguished the film.
180;Another nuance is the love.
181;hate relationship our two protagonists share with one another.
182;The ending of the film is quite tender, depicting how caring and gentle and loving Joe is in nurturing Ratso during his debilitating illness on their bus trip to Florida.
183;The film indicates a transformation, an expansion, a growth for both characters, as they come to realize that their lives are much more than about parochial and narrow self interests.
184;this film won several academy awards (1969) and, in my opinion, deserves its classic moniker.
185;Both Hoffman and Voight turned in excellent and dynamic and exceptionally convincing performances, and I would say this film showed them at their best acting potential.
186;I have added this one to my small collection and expect to enjoy it for years.
187;Despite the cuts for content it still had the power to move me.
188;To be honest it moved me to tears which is not something one easily admits to.
189;Voight is utterly charming as the aw.
190;This part introduced Voight to film audiences in a big way.
191;nonetheless, voight does a good acting job at least.
192;"while the movie does feature some interesting ""innovative"" cut."
193;This is such a good movie.
194;I bought it because it's a classic, and holds up today like a new release.
195;What do you think?Of course Dustin Hoffman is pure gold here, helping me forget his most recent Focker's series.
196;It was just something I never questioned, talked about, read, etc. but I can now say I love this movie.
197;I believe it is one of those movies where it is in the eye of the beholder as they say.
198;I'm so glad I finally watched it and it will probably be one of those I watch more than once.
199;Midnight Cowboy is one of my most beloved movies ever and it could possibly be my favorite movie of all time.
200;"dustin Hoffman creates here a character as memorable as Don Corleone with his signature bum leg,greasy hair,nasel voice, and his unforgettable dialogue ""Hey."
201;it's incredibly moving how they survive thru the poverty and how Ratzo dreams to move to Miami where he believes the sun and coconut can restore his decaying body.
202;i won't tell you anymore but i promise you that you will be moved by this film.
203;it's a film of indestructable power that remains with you for the rest of your life.
204;"the perfectly chosen soundtrack provides the ideal soundscape for every scene from Nillsens ""Everbody's Talkin"" to the final haunting harmonica dominated instrumental."
205;so take a walk on the wild side and pick up this Midnight Cowboy and prepare to have your heart shattered and your mind haunted by its timeless imagery.
206;I grew up with this movie, somehow I ended up in NYC myself in the early 70's.
207;it is one of the best movies Dustin Hoffman ever made as well as Jon voight.
208;"When Joe meets Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo, he finds his perfect foil, and a teacher who can show him the code of the streets."
209;the person whose words and life provide the brutal honesty, but also true friendship love, Joe has always needed.
210;But Joe's fortunes take a turn for the better, at least enough for the two to realize a version of their dreams.
211;it is a film of extraordinary performances, the chemistry between Voight and Hoffman a marvel that we seldom witness anymore.
212;If the director Schlesinger's images and pacing have not completely survived the transition from the late 60's, the actors more than compensate, ensuring this film its status as an influential, one of a kind feat of storytelling and characterization, and an angry but loving sociopolitical statement.
213;I saw this movie when it was first released and it made a lasting impression on me.
214;Seeing it a second time this many years later .
215;This is my favorite movie of all time and I truly believe it to be the best film ever made.
216;it touches on the human condition of love and the need for some sort of companionship in a lonley world like no other motion picture.
217;Great storyline, super directing and acting, and a terrific sound track, combine to give viewers, a memorable experience in this Academy award winning movie.
218;Directed by John Schlesinger and written by Waldo Salt, the movie seems to be a product of its time, the late 1960's when American films were especially expressionistic, but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period.
219;"The film's cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain""."
220;The two become dependent on one another, and Rizzo begins to manage Joe.
221;in his first major role, Jon Voight is ideally cast as he brings out Joe's paper.
222;As Rizzo, Dustin Hoffman successfully upends his clean, post.
223;The honesty of their portrayals is complemented by Schlesinger's film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the Times Square district at the time.
224;There are three terrific featurettes on the second disc .
225;Great movie, but if you play it on a large home theatre screen, it gets a little smudgy.
226;This is one of the greatest motion pictures of all.
227;The direction is spectacular, the music is fantastic, the performances are perfect.
228;Dustin Hoffman gives one of the most inspiring performances of his career.
229;This movie brings the viewer to the places that people like to ignore.
230;What it ultimately shows is that there is humanity and empathy to be found in even the most jaded of individuals.
231;Saw this when I was in high school and have always wanted to own it.
232;Dustin Hoffman's performance as Ratso Rizzo was outstanding!!!
233;He Should have won an Oscar for this role.
234;Both actors have powerful performances and Nillson's Everybodys Talking is a nice added touch to the soundtrack.
235;"a Space Odyssey"", ""The Graduate"" all great films that address social and other issues aka films of great depth that transcend the ages."
236;This film is sometimes funny, certainly shocking but for me very moving and touching.
237;"i thought both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman were excellent in their roles and the film just like in ""Easy Rider"" unabashedly shows the life of the underbelly of New York City at the time warts and all just as that film tried to do the same for the Hippy movement of the time in California."
238;I especially liked the New York Underground party scene that gives us a glimpse of what Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground were singing about in their classic 1967 album.
239;a very good film and one of my personal favourites although you should wait for the Blu.
240;Two of our finest actors in one film!
241;I would recommend it to a friend.
242;Try it you will like it.
243;This is one of the most effective, touching movies I have ever seen and I listen to the soundtrack several times a week, sometimes more, and it always puts me in that mood.
244;Its an indescribable mood that you can only understand if you've seen the movie.
245;See it more than once, too, because it gets better with time.
246;I prefer you give it a try and see by yourself.
247;It's certainly one of the movies I've been watching and watching again and again years to years.
248;i'm in my early twenties and would, according to present standards, qualify as an adult, but certainly I haven't myself been in the gutter yet, nor been to the pawn shop, nor etc., etc. nevertheless, I consider this a very strong film.
249;jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are terrific here.
250;but the movie received the Best Picture Award and Schlesinger walked away with the Award for Best Director.
251;A great admirer of Schlesinger, I watched the movie again recently for the first time since its initial release.
252;who picks up Joe and feels he deserves the beating Joe gives him, after he calls his mother on the telephone.
253;finally, Ratzo and Joe's bus ride into the warm and balmy Miami to get away from the cold New York winter moved me as much today as it did when I first saw the movie.
254;"well, Dustin is amazing as the uncommitmed street man, the locations in NYC look like a hell's preview
I:8444;255;a well made fable about the dream and reality"
256;an extraordinary film who won the Academy Award and threw the gladiator actoral sand to Jon Voight.
257;unforgettable and even recognized soundtrack even now.
258;undoubtly the masterpiece of John Schlessinger and one of the most solid gems of the american cinema in any age.
259;This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.
260;The actors have done a remarkable job in playing their roles and the movie itself is very entartaining.
261;And Jon, you done good too, but looking back from here it was 'early.
262;Dustin and Jon should had won the Academy Award for Best Actor.
263;Poignant and will stay with you long after the film is over.
264;Well deserved Best Film Oscar.
265;And if you aint man enough to do it for yourself, I'd be happy to ablidge.
266;Joe is tall and energetic, which is perhaps how Rizo would like to be.
267;The flashback/dream/fantasy sequences are appropriate to indicate the connection of the two leads.
268;Rizo has fantasies of finding his way to heaven( Florida ), he wants to be popular, warm, and most of all, to be called Rico.
269;mEMORABLE SCENES: I loved the scene where Joe was flirting with that passerby chick and he watches her go into her home.
270;For the briefest of moments, he has a vison that he goes inside with her.
271;This scene shows what outcasts the two main characters are, in a subtle way.
272;It is an American classic.
273;A masterpiece of a movie that I am just now appreciating,really for the first time.
274;And yet, there is something wonderful in finding friendship even in the worst places.
275;"winner of the Academy Award for best picture of 1969, it certainly is a worthy mainstream film that also be considered as one of the best ""art"" films of all time as well."
276;The postcards included are the best movie PR postcards, ever!Harry Nilsson, Rest in Peace!
277;Midnight Cowboy is a classic film directed by John Schlesinger.
278;Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are excellent.
279;This film is a classic and a cult film.
280;A young Dustin Hoffman cuts out a part that is so brilliant and so moving that the film will remain in our minds no matter how long ago we have seen it.
281;To the point that Rico, the main character, is living on a dream, the dream to go to Florida.
282;His situation is so dramatic that his friend Joe will, thanks to violent stealing in a sexual situation that will prevent the victim from speaking, realize his dream and take him to Florida.
283;It's pretty clear that all the two characters really have that's any good is their friendship, and by the end of the film, it's unlikely that you'll ever view the misfits of society quite the same way.
284;The sequences in which they spend a New York winter in a condemned and empty apartment building are unforgettable, as is the bus ride to Florida.
285;Highly recommended for viewers interested in sorting out some of the meaning in life.
286;What saves the film and makes it worthwhile 40 years later are chiefly the solid and detailed performances of Jon Voight as laughable New York hustler Joe Buck and Dustin Hoffman as street.
287;They make their own odd couple, and while sex is never even implied, the emotional bond of men in a relationship that transcends mere friendship is there.
288;This film captures the themes of loneliness and poverty better than any film.
289;John Voight (Joe Buck) and Dustin Hoffman (Ratzo) give stellar performances, bringing life to two characters that could have been spoiled if other actors had assumed their roles.
290;This film is not just a great story, but also a great criticism of the state of poverty in the richest country in the world.
291;I like Midnight Cowboy, I think it's one of Hoffman and Voight's best performances and the story is good and the directing is excellent.
292;It definitely is a classic piece of film history.
293;I love Dustin Hoffman in this on every level.
294;the amazing courage he had to do this after The Graduate.
295;and then to do such an amazing job.
296;such a gifted and talented actor.
297;Worth watching every night :)
298;Nice film very enjoyable and 2 great actors of all time .
299;I think this movie is so good that there should be a sixth star reserved just for it and the rare movies that are in the same category as this one.
300;This movie is apart of a couple of more movies that are really the start of what I call modern movie making.
301;They were so cutting edge even by today's standard really and they also jumpstarted what I consider the best decade of movies, the 70's.
302;Really, really good movie though and I would say anyone that isn't easily offended should watch it.
303;I guess if you are high this is a great movie.
304;1969 called and it wants its Best Picture award back.
305;1969 was an excellent year for films.
306;why is it then that this is the film that won the Academy Awards for best picture,director and screenplay of that year?
307;This is a story that tugged at our heartstrings, and made us up sit up and take notice of the world around us.
308;He finds himself in need of a friend.
309;Ratso takes Joe under his wing, and together they try to survive on one get rich quick scheme after another.
310;Their friendship moved us then and it will move you now.
311;The actors are phenominal in their performances.
312;Hoffman fresh off his success in The Graduate shows us way back then how versitile he is, and Voight the newcomer proved his dramatic skills early on.
313;The director John Schlesinger (Far From the Maddning Crowd) gives us a very realistic view of life on the streets.
314;The soundtrack is wonderful with the great song Everybody's Talkin .
315;What I find most interesting is the vast divergence between those who love and those who hate this film.
316;hero's redemption in spite of his own failings, as much as it is a statement about an urban socialite landscape that uses and disposes of our anti.
317;One of Hoffman's landmark performances, and Voight was never better.
318;One of those rare instances where a film not made for a mainstream audience became a commercial success.
319;When it was released at the end of the 60's, movies were enjoying a new freedom in language and subject matter with the creation of the MPAA rating (then only in its 2nd year).
320;But what director Schlesinger brought to the table was a whole new way of telling a story.
321;Propelled, make that glided, by Nilsonn's Everybody's Talkin' in one of the most perfect meldings of song and cinema, makes you aware your in the hands of a master storyteller.
322;eyed, but totally believable, innocence and Hoffman's cynically encrusted exterior, they bring indellible life to two men who are really brothers under the skin.
323;Repeated viewings will make you wonder just who is better.
324;Some great NY actors, whose faces were well known to audiences back then, do some of their best work here also.
325;And kudos to John Barry's sparse, but unforgettable score.
326;The great composer gives a large chunk of the film's music to some budding songwriters.
327;The film still stands as one of the most emotionally powerful films about friendship, love and the survival of the human soul.
328;Just a great story about two mismatched guys living semi.
329;homeless in New York and their odd, sometimes fun, sometimes sad, adventures.
330;"Two years after ""The Graduate,"" Hoffmann transformed himself into an ailing derelict in director Schlesinger's dark, intense ""Midnight Cowboy."""
331;"A story of friendship born of desperation in Manhattan's grimy underbelly, ""Cowboy"" was at the vanguard of a new kind of Hollywood movie in the late '60s."
332;"Despite an initial ""X"" rating, the film won Oscars for best picture, director, and screenplay, and both Hoffman and newcomer Voight were nominated for their gutsy, raw performances."
333;Hoffman's Rizzo is particularly astounding.
334;friendship can be found in the most unlikely of places.
335;memorable performances from voight and hoffman, it's truly amazing to watch their chemistry together.
336;tragic, heartbreaking and emotionally exhausting, one of the best movies from the later part of the twentieth century, and with a beautiful soundtrack.
337;A timeless setting, the focus in this film is of seedy New York life.
338;garde party, ripe with possibilities, but Ratso just wants the free food.
339;Joe's true loyalty shows, but in his quest to help his friend, rage born of disillusionment is unleashed on a gay man, an act of desperation to ensure Ratso's survival.
340;A touching emotional film that you will never forget, I highly recommend this timeless movie to everyone.
341;The best part was when Dolly Parton and the girls tried to kill their boss with the rat poison.
342;Yea this movie was just alright as well.
343;I will say it's unique.
344;Excrutiatingly disgusting, yet unbelieveably interesting.
345;A good bit of documentary reporting, showing the life in New York as it is for the very poor and young.
346;John Voight gives one of the most moving, true.
347;life performances in movie history.
348;Such innocence and undaunted purity of a young, un.
349;jaded spirit always looking on the bright.
350;A sad ending and a worthy movie of re.
351;watching again and again (timeless, utterly timeless).
352;They saved each other and I like to think good things came to him in Miami as he deserved more than anyone.
353;Joe Buck is one the kindest, dear hearted, considerate, thoughtful and true characters ever to grace our screens.
354;This one pierces the heart.
355;Dustin Hoffman's is most goddam beautiful.
356;one of the most stirring movies of all times.
357;Coming across Midnight Cowboy surprised me, as I've seen most of the classics and infamous films from all era's, colored or not, etc.
358;Having watched this for the first time, all I can say is wow .
359;Not only is the subject matter truly unique, the direction by John Schlesinger is amazing (cinematography, casting, slick editing, the atmosphere of the crazy, dirty, slum life of New York City in the 60's).
360;john Voight is amazing in this film, as if Hoffman, both amazing actors of their generations and still going strong.
361;This might be the best perormance I've seen Voight do, and Hoffman it's right up there with all his greats.
362;smart polio survivor that walks with a limp and has full use in one leg.
363;sure, it was the first X rated film to win a Best Picture Oscar, but just remembering it as Best Picture is good enough for me.
364;I believe you should be 18 or so to see this, unless you are a mature teen.
365;But a film that covers sexuality and friendship and all sorts of other things (like sexual humilation, rape, incest, prostitution) and many touchy matters that people were afraid to discuss or make films about until this gem of a film.
366;the acting is amazing, the story is one of a kind, the characters and atmosphere created by the director keep you immersed in the film from the amazing opening shot to the ending credits.
367;I feel this film has truly stood the test of time, and is one of those rare gems that don't seem to age.
368;Anyone that loves unique films or especially film students, put this classic on your watch soon list and see how unique this film still is.
369;Midnight Cowboy winner of the 1969 Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay.
370;I had seen this movie before and remember liking it and feeling slightly haunted by it.
371;this movie is amazing, incredible, indelible, and easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.
372;this movie easily ranks up in my top 20 and maybe even in my top 10.
373;having sex with rich woman and then collecting when the fun's over.
374;Joe and Ratso over the course of the film become close friends, which brings me to some thoughts.
375;film buffs love it and hopefully my review will grant you some inscentive to try and watch it.
376;Its astute commentary by producers, directors, and the actors themselves not only offers insight into the history of the times and the decisions that created the film but also offers a profound insight into the nature of the characters leading in turn to their behaviors.
377;Saw this when it came out years ago, and it was just as good the second time, great acting on both parts.
378;The main purpose of an Amazon review, certainly of as well.
379;known a title as this, is to discuss the product at hand .
380;namely the video and audio remastering, the bonus disc and special features here .
381;He manages to convey the human and symathetic qulities that very few actors could get across on screen.
382;It is a heartbreaking moment that symbolizes the need both characters possess for each other.
383;it is an important cinematic achievement.
384;It's a sad but very worthy film, which left me feeling somewhat wiser.
385;I would particularly recommend it to those who came of age in the late sixties.
386;"I also like ""Old Man Willow"" by Elephant's Memory."
387;"Immediately, I noticed that both gave great performances
I:8444;388;MIDNIGHT COWBOY will always be a classic due to the superb acting by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman.
I:8444;389;Top notch performances also by Sylvia Miles, Brenda Vaccaro, Barnard Hughes and splendid direction by John Schlesinger and a legendary song 'Everybodys Talkin' by Harry Nilsson.
I:8444;390;Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.
I:8444;391;The film is structured along familiar genre lines, basically it's a rape.
I:8444;392;As Annie, she has a more naturalistic role, clearly inspired by the then.
I:8444;393;when you consider how affected Hoffnan and Voight both became in their acting, the freshness and lightness of their performances here is a wonder.
I:8444;394;The plot in the movie was very good and very original compared to movies that are made today.
I:8444;395;The acting was superb by both Hoffman and Voight, the direction of the movie is a little dated, but most people will enjoy the movie.
I:8444;396;Saw this movie when it first came out.
I:8444;397;Truly great cinema and great acting.
I:8444;398;both the actors give brave honest performances but Dustin Hoffman's performance esclipes Voights in every way, Voights performance was amazing in it's own way but I truly feel that Hoffman shines in one of the greatest performances in motion picture history.
I:8444;399;His timing is spot on and his walk and accent truly make you believe that Dustin is Ratso in real life.
I:8444;400;the editing is another stand out achievement and full credit must go to the director and screenwriter for attemping such risking subject matter and pulling it off with a brilliant motion picture that doesn't glorify waht we need to know.
I:8444;401;I give it a big thumbs down.
I:8444;402;Watched it once, will never watch it again probably.
I:8444;403;Midingt Cowboy was released in 1969, and luckily I got to see it at the theatre.
I:8444;404;a great film, shows the roughness of live and the great ways friendship can surprise you.
I:8444;405;love dustin hoffman in this film, in my opinion his best role ever.
I:8444;406;they strike up an unusual friendship.
I:8444;407;funny and sad, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
I:8444;408;Yes, you read that right.
I:8444;409;Now with me being a total moviephile, that's a big achievement for a film.
I:8444;410;It's tragic, poignant, sometimes funny (like the strange things you hear on Joe's radio, or see on the picket signs of protesters, for example, one sign said, """"Liberate freedom!"""""""
411;The friendship that grows between Ratso and Joe is.
412;All of the characters are so fully.
413;"It starts out with the hopeful ""Everybody's Talkin'"", which is about new experiences and having high hopes for the future (like ""finally moving on to where I want to be in life!"")"
414;The songs are all great.
415;plus the direction was cool.
416;This movie was so sincere, it was like an open door.
417;That's what makes it great.
418;I know it by heart.
419;You can tell a good film when the minds eye of the director is poured through the lens whilst simultaniously absorbing the age and culture he is filming.
420;There are some truely classic dialogue moments, people are shown in all their glory and self loathing, a brutally honest look at what happens when you chase your dreams into a big city without a backup plan.
421;I never tire of this timeless classic.
422;Excellent movie in excellent condition
423;Oscar win = Best picture and Director that is all great but it deserved more.
424;It is by far the best film of the 60s and there is overwhelming evidence to support this.1) The acting talent is outstanding, Jon Voight pulls out one of the best performances ever, he deserved to win Best Actor for his role as Joe Buck a stud from the ol' west who decides to go to New York to sell himself to all those women up there.
425;This film is a classic and no others can compete .
426;I don't care what anyone else says.3) Oh and by the way the soundtrack is fantastic too.
427;If you ever wondered where Dustin Hoffman got the walk for Rainman, watch this and then you will know.
428;British director John Schlessinger, in his first American film, captured the gritty sordidness of New York City, as it was in those days, with all its contrasts and inconsistencies.
429;jon Voight is cast as Joe Buck, a young man from Texas who comes to New York with the dream of becoming a male prostitute.
430;wise hustler who first cons the young Texan and later befriends him.
431;Joe Bucks' story is told with flashbacks and surreal fantasy sequences, which seem unfocussed at times, but give us an understanding of who he is.
432;the film is full of memorable characters .
433;There's a memorable soundtrack too .
434;And then there's the memorable conclusion which takes place on a bus headed for Florida.
435;But it says something about human nature and human connection.
436;And it pictures a way of life that might not be pleasant but is a reality.
437;When we think about X ratings we often think about wild sexual scenes involving busty blondes and handsome studs in elegant settings.
438;voight did have his dreams of mansions and beautiful women.
439;He thought the money would shower on him and that he'd live a life of luxury.
440;it's certainly not an upbeat, cheery movie, but it is a look at an area of life that few other movies tackle.
441;He had a girl he loved .
442;The pieces come in fragments, and it makes you wonder just how he got to the place he is now.
443;well worth watching to give a view into what New York City means to many people who can't seem to get a hand.
444;hold on a decent life.
445;A good movie to watch.
446;Excellant acting and a very strong story that you would enjoy till the last minute.
447;One of the all time best adult classics.
448;A perverted buddy movie with Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight at their best.
449;I reacted to it in a very personal way, and it's been on my mind all day.
450;perfect, Schlesinger's direction is daring, snappy, unique, Waldo Salt's screenplay is full of wit and compassion, and the fabulous music really sets the tone.
451;He made it as a reflection of the time and place.
452;(This is common in Schlesinger's work .
453;he has a remarkable eye for detail.)
454;quoted classic of cultural significance (which it is as well) but because it'll genuinely make you laugh and cry, and later, think.
455;This has been one of my classic favorite movies for years.
456;This movie is gritty, real, sad, funny, and deep.
457;Over the years I seldom ever heard the mention of Midnight Cowboy in discussions among theater goers.
458;I oftened rated the performances of both Dustin Hoffman and the then new.
459;comer John Voight as the best acting performances ever to be seen.
460;Not to take anything away from Wayne, but in my opinion, this was Hoffmans best ever performance.
461;The awarding of the film as the Best Picture easily substantiates my views.
462;I heartedly recommend it to serious theater goers.
463;It's heartening to read so many glowing reviews from younger viewers who weren't around when this landmark film appeared on the scene in 1969.
464;The humanity at the core of this film has been rarely matched, and what's great is that the film remains a hip time capsule.
465;Layered with Elephants Memory's astonishing Old Man Willow in an overlapping, edited form to simulate psychedelic distortions and time shifts, the party sequence pretty much visualizes the herky.
466;ness interpolated with fluid moments of slo.
467;"i can't add much to the praise that precedes my own regards Hoffman and Voight
I:8444;468;Brenda Vaccarro is also great as a proto.
I:8444;469;a gorgeous chick, ya lug! )
I:8444;470;add to all this Waldo Salt's transformation of Herlihy's novel into a prismatic cinematic work, some deft editing, and the musical score and supervision by John Barry that marries pop tunes to his haunting score.
I:8444;471;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:8444;472;This movie crushed the typical American Dream ideal people believed in back then.
I:8444;473;I thought the acting was exceptional.
I:8444;474;The gritty reality of the settings was honest and brutal.
I:8444;475;One of several miraculous films directed by the late John Schlesinger, MIDNIGHT COWBOY has a power that is undiminished more than thirty years after it was made.
I:8444;476;produced films that is aimed exclusively at an intelligent, adult audience.
I:8444;477;It's a beautifully made film in every way, using some techniques developed by the French New Wave: jump cuts, simultaneity of past and present, cinema.
I:8444;478;waldo Salt's screenplay (based on the novel by sorely underrated James Leo Herlihy) is a brilliant look at the bonding of two seemingly incompatible personalities.
I:8444;479;On a broader scale, this is a study of the human need to be connected.
I:8444;480;Yet it avoids any sentimentality and remains emotionally committed throughout.
I:8444;481;The two main characters can be seen as somewhat symbolic: Joe (Voight) represents an American masculine ideal that does not exist.
I:8444;482;He himself knows this, as the flashbacks reveal with their images of emasculation.
I:8444;483;Joe's unflagging optimism allows Ratso to face his own fantasies.
I:8444;484;In the end, all these men have is each other.
I:8444;485;The film's original trailer is included.
I:8444;486;unforgetable pathos in the awesome depth of the truth that Voight and Hoffman invest in their brave portrayals .
I:8444;487;the film brilliantly captures a New York City pre.
I:8444;488;i liked it better in a lot of ways before.
I:8444;489;After all, it was made in the sixties and does reflect those times.
I:8444;490;I want to see movies in which hip, good.
I:8444;491;This movie is intriguing and teaches lessons about life.
I:8444;492;Voight and Hoffman are fantastic in their roles
I:8444;493;I would certainly rank the movie as one of the best in the last century in the league of The Godfather trilogy, The Omen part 1, Z, The Dear Hunter, Melody Fair, The Scent of A Woman and In The Name Of The Father.
I:8444;494;If you are doing well in life, you should also watch it.
I:8444;495;It will make you more human.
I:8444;496;i want to watch it again.
I:8444;497;I did like this movie becuase it is a """"could be so real"""" movie."""
498;It is about a man moving to the big city from the small town wanting to be a sexual hustler.
499;"I do recommend this movie to anyone that likes a ""close to real life"" kind of story."
500;Joe is more comical than successful as a stud.
501;The ladies of New York see him for what he is and unmercifully take advantage.
502;Their reconciliation is a tender study of two misfits who must survive in a blighted landscape that viewers over 40 remember well from their misspent youth.
503;They are now eager to help one another, Ratzo to schedule Joe's increasingly successful stud service, and Joe to keep Ratzo healthy enough to one day leave for Florida.
504;An old movie with a timeless theme of greed and self.
505;destruction coupled with the redemptive power of selfless friendship.
506;powerful performances by the lead characters.
507;I cannot explain for the life of me why this simple tale about simple characters lives in my mind as one of the best films of all time.
508;Maybe it's just the song, but something about Midnight Cowboy transforms a would.
509;I normally try to down play reasons for liking a film that have to do with message but, in the case of Midnight Cowboy, the film is great because it shows how even the deepest loneliness can be conquered.
510;thoughts to me, here they came together for one of the great extended moments in film history.
511;Thank goodness for the smattering of eleven.year.
512;year love affair with this film, one of the most poignant, heartfelt and endearing stories of male bonding ever.
513;I felt the need to order it because it is very wholesome and sad.
514;The title song sounded great.
515;I think the movie is great.
516;I have viewed it several time over the years.
517;I worked at the Ramada Inn coffee shop where the Producer, Director, Jon Voight, and Ruth White, and members of the production crew stayed ,during the filming of the part in Texas.
518;Little did I know at that time that he would become a great movie actor.
519;"John Schlesinger directed the film to such acclaim that it won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay in 1969 despite its ""X"" MPAA rating."
520;The story is found in Joe Buck's emotional arch over the course of the film.
521;Jon Voight does a fine job of conveying Joe's cockiness along with his gradual discovery of his own naivet and perhaps lack of intelligence.
522;Brenda Vaccaro is interesting in a supporting role as one of Joe's ladies.
523;Dubbing is available in French.
524;Joe Buck's Oz is achieving fame, fortune, and attention through his super good looks, which he believes will land him in dozens of penthouses with lots of rich old women.
525;Midnight Cowboy is remembered, as other films that share this distinction are, for winning the Oscar for Best Picture (accomplished this feat in 1969).
526;personally, I feel the grit is more about the story itself.
527;in a sense, you see the depth of humanity, and how people work to survive through it all, but in overtly unrealistic situations.
528;In my humble opinion, that is what this story is about.
529;In fact, I actually thought Hoffman did a terrific job, but then again I am a self.
530;proclaimed fan (for the most part.)
531;Yet it won the Oscar for a reason, and hopefully the modern viewer can at least sit down and watch the film, although they may come to my agreement that this film is alright.
532;Thanks so much, it made her very happy.
533;Few films with this type of style age this well.
534;Midnight Cowboy despite having a very dated construction, it still one of the most interesting and sad films ever made.
535;it had been many years since I had seen this and I will admit, I liked it better now than when I first saw it in the 70's, but some confusing flashback sequences and dated situations keep this film from being perfect.
536;The two stars chemistry and the films undeniable raw and uncompromising story are something that stay with the viewer long after the credits role.
537;All day I reflected on this movie it totally blew my mind.
538;Dustin Hoffman is extremely talented.
539;My biggest question is what is going on in the minds of the great actors and directors.
540;jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman turn in excellent performances, helping to convey an intense naivete but also a great human warmth.
541;For those who are interested the widescreen version is matted, so the full screen version offers more screen information.
542;A crook and a good.
543;"heart country boy who means no harm
I:8444;544;This story line is as relevant as it is today.
I:8444;545;Overall, it is a good movie, funny, and touching.
I:8444;546;I found myself looking for something to watch one night and ran across this movie.
I:8444;547;from the point of view of a film historian, this is an incredible work of cinematic art and a most important document depicting the rotten side of NYC circa 1969.
I:8444;548;this film ranks with """"Taxi Driver"""" as the most brutally honest film with NYC as the backdrop."""
549;A very powerful and gutsy choice for best picture and very deserving as well.
550;In 1970 I still livening in Argentina, my country, when I enjoyed this wonderfull movie.
551;I've been watching John Voight on Ray Donovan and he does such a good job that I was curious to see his acting ability when he was younger.
552;And of course Dustin Hoffman is fabulous.
553;my favorite movie ever made.
554;Great movie about a cowboy who comes to NYC and becomes Friends With a homeless man.
555;I cant tell you much without spoiling it.
556;The movie shows lifes harder side and has great performances by dustin hoffman and jon voight.
557;Disturbingly honest portrayal of compassion and survival in the rat infested metropolis we call New York.
558;Unlikely alliants encourage each other to chase their dreams while helping one another to survive the never ending symptomology of poverty and hopelessness.
559;Constantly assaulting the viewers emotions, the screenplay is mined with moments of shear magic, real love, and undeniable humanity.
560;Touching, full of life, and ultimately devastating.
561;Few adolescents and young adults will appreciate the power of this film.
562;Because most of us have been there.
563;Midnight Cowboy is an incredibly insightful montage of our dreams and desires that will likely realize never.
564;For years this was my favorite film of all time, and it may still be.
565;Voight and Hoffman give the best performances of their careers, IMHO.
566;This is the most savage yet poetic portrayal of post.50's Americana I've ever seen, and for me it is timeless.
567;"Every scene is masterfully played, shot, and edited
I:8444;568;The last scene is almost too powerful, and I'm destined to always watch it bleary.
I:8444;569;eyed, heartbroken, and profoundly moved.
I:8444;570;John Barry provided a wonderful score.
I:8444;571;Still, what a great flick.
I:8444;572;A very disturbing and interesting movie, then and now.
I:8444;573;His dream is to get established as a male """"escort"""", in the euphemistic sense, for wealthy women."""
574;His mentor is the streetwise, homeless, Ratso Rizzo, played beautifully by Dustin Hoffman.
575;He also seems smarter than a person who believes a change of climate will cure his worsening physical condition.
576;"an incongruous but effective scene involves one last encounter with a ""client"", a middle."
577;(It's a very affecting scene .
578;sylvia Miles and John MacGiver are memorable, also.
579;1969's Midnight Cowboy helped usher in a new era in filmmaking.
580;Ratso is played by Dustin Hoffman who fulfilled the promise he showed in The Graduate with a gritty, gutsy performance.
581;The film is filled with what was at the time shocking sexual commentary and scenes that today are commonplace in films and even appear on television.
582;The film received an X rating and became the only X. rated film to win the Best Picture Oscar.
583;Mr. Schlesinger won for Best Director and Waldo Salt won for Best Adapted Screenplay.
584;Midnight Cowboy is no longer shocking by today's standards, but it is still a powerful and moving film and captures what the feeling of the New York underworld must have been like in the late sixties.
585;There is a nice friendship that forms but overall, not what I like to watch.
586;The script is superb and the director and cast do it full justice.
587;A work of cinematic art must do two things: show something new in a new way, and use all the elements of the medium to their fullest possible advantage.
588;Screenplay by Waldo Salt portrays the growing friendship between two, emotionally and economically struggling human beings.
589;the plot and character development progress via the use of expertly and sensitively filmed and edited, deftly placed, carefully scripted and brilliantly acted flashbacks as well as crisp, provocative dialog, complemented by stirring and character.
590;midnight Cowboy is an incredibly beautiful and complex work of cinematic art.
591;Highly recommended for people over the age of sixteen who have begun their own intensive thinking processes about society, what it means to be human in a near.
592;If in fact it had been produced now rather than in 1969 it very well may have been considered an art house film.
593;So we understand that what inspires him is rather odd and unusual.
594;He eventually catches the eye of a street smart scam artist Played by Dustin Hoffman.
595;This film is an excellent character study, and Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight deliver ground breaking performances.
596;This film is surreal, and edgy, and at the same time unusually compelling.
597;Everytime I watch it,it brings back my images of that time of my life.
598;i would recommend it for anyone that loves crazy post modern films.
599;One of the great travesties in movie history is that Dustin Hoffman didn't win the Oscar for best actor for his incredible performance in this picture.
600;Voigt delivers a fine performance as well as the lead actor/title character, but Dustin's acting is so deep, nuanced and rich that I always just shake my head whenever I watch his Ratso Rizzo.
601;He uses a spot on New York accent, affects a very convincing cripple's walk, displays manual dexterity cooking and shining shoes.
602;When you seem him sweating profusely w/ the fear in his eyes that he's dying, you absolutely believe it.
603;An interesting story but I would rather spend time on other things.
604;He decided in his optimism to make a run to New York to become a hustler for rich women.
605;He's in for a surprise as the only people into his cowboy schtick is the homosexual underground.
606;in and of themselves, the actions of these two towards everyone they meet is despicable, but fits well with how the people treat each other in general in the city.
607;this culminates in the end, as Joe beats a man and takes his money to get bus fare so himself and a terminally ill Rico can go to Florida.
608;It was absolutely fascinating and frightening, with first rate actors and no happy ending.
609;it has been about 25 years since I last saw this, so this viewing was really fresh for me.
610;But somehow, they find friendship, even tenderness, and even a few laughs while navigating the most horrible lives.
611;"Then there are Buck's ""clients"", most lowlives themselves without love."
612;You feel empathy for all of these characters.
613;of course, I loved the portrayal of NYC, where I lived 15 years after the film.
614;And there is a lot of humor and irony in the film.
615;recommended, one of the best films I have ever seen.
616;For so many in a city such as New York or Miami, it will always midnight.
617;I just love this Movie, but Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight do an excellent areoutstanding in the roles of the wannabee Male Prostitute and Dustin Hoffmandid an excellent job of being his sidekick.
618;John Schlesinger's film adaptation of James Leo Herlihy's 1965 novel is a work of creative genius, sublimely crafted, rich, profound, and deeply moving.
619;Thought I would also see it again since I hadn't watched for over 30 years.
620;I found new meaning in the story, it touched me in a way it hadn't the first time.
621;Excellent storyline, direction, and acting.
622;One of the best movies that came out of hollywood.
623;The video and sound are excellent.
624;There were a few scenes we weren't thrilled with, but overall we enjoyed the movie.
625;Fast forward nearly forty years, and I can only say the movie has aged like a fine wine.
626;"Yeah, ""that scene"" is still a little controversial, but the acting, photography, and sound track put this movie on my top."
627;ten list of best movies.
628;"The ""behind the scenes"" disc is outstanding and made me appreciate even more the logistics involved in making this such a great picture."
629;I viewed this movie many years ago and thought it would be fun to see it again in light of todays attitudes and liberal thinking.
630;It is indeed a jewel and profoundly moving at its resolution.
631;As far as which of the two lead actors shone the brightest, I would have to say it was some of each ones best work to date.
632;I enjoyed it watching it again.
633;Midnight Cowboy is an Oscar.
634;winning movie that stays with you long after viewing.
635;It has a timeless message about urban life, searching for dreams and the reality of living.
636;the movie is very very strong and affecting.
637;The best is to see the whole movie without the editing for television, so that one can follow the story of Joe's life back in the country.
638;The end of this film is amazing and I challenge anyone to stop himself from be moved at the closing scene.
639;Coupled with the haunting musical theme, Hoffmann makes a presentation not soon to be forgotten.
640;it was bold daring and depicted life as it was.
641;given his past life that is a incredible accomplishment and plays off ratso rizzos seaming dark fragile persona like a great melody of life.
642;The content was edgy and the story was great.
643;I love a movie that makes me think about life.
644;"Filmed in 1969, this story of two young men seeking fame and ending up on the streets rings true
I:8444;645;This film raised a big stink when it was first released but it's hard to justify winning Best Picture Oscar compared to the competition (other than being daring at the time).
I:8444;646;Interesting slices of NYC in late 60's but the rather well.
I:8444;647;in front of Tiffany's is a little over the top.
I:8444;648;I saw it for the first time this week and it is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:8444;649;The acting is touching, simple and varied.
I:8444;650;The story and direction are sure and relaxed and do not show age.
I:8444;651;to me, the best years of American cinema are the late sixties and seventies.
I:8444;652;Ending with one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking endings ever filmed, Midnight Cowboy is on of the world's most unforgettable contemporary classics.
I:8444;653;though Dustin Hoffman's performance is alarmingly similar (if only in terms of the voice) to his later performance in Rainman, it is one which deserved, entirely, it's Oscar Nomination.
I:8444;654;The hope is so moving that one finds it impossible not to be inspired to the point where you feel to the point of tears.
I:8444;655;His rugged honesty and hope are what break him in the urban jungle of New York City.
I:8444;656;one of Voight's lines ( I'll tell you where you can put your dishes.
I:8444;657;And if you won't I'd be happy to oblige, I truly would! )
I:8444;658;backed with Harry Nilssen's Oscar winning version of Everybody's Talkin' is pure magic.
I:8444;659;take a hint and watch this beautiful film and don't be put off by the earlier X rating because this movie captures a beauty not seen since then until the magnificent 1999 film American Beauty.
I:8444;660;And by the way, John Barry's overwhelming score (especially Midnight Cowboy ) is worth quite a listen as well.
I:8444;661;I watched this movie unedited 10 years ago for the first time and I was impressed.
I:8444;662;, it's the performances of Voight and Hoffman that won my admiration.
I:8444;663;Midnight Cowboy was the first and only X rated movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.
I:8444;664;I understand this though"
665;It demonstrates that childhood experiences shape the adult personality.
666;I moved to New York after my divorce hoping to find a real man.
667;A man with strong legs, and a hard back.
668;102.7 was Joe Buck's favorite station.
669;Help them with his strong legs, and his hard back.
670;Joe Buck packed his stuff and got on the Greyhound.
671;Ratso was good at both.
672;Overwhelmed by the banquet of nothingness they bought to the table, finally they learn of each others true dreams.
673;honored stamp of Mickey Mouse.
674;psychologist Herbert Maslow considered love to be a basic need, yet he also believed love was a necessary component of the self, the actualization of all a man can be.
675;"One is a simple man who holds idealistic beliefs toward life
I:8444;676;One fashions himself a cowboy, the other has honed himself into a survivalist.
I:8444;677;Midnight Cowboy was a notable film at the time of its release.
I:8444;678;It portrayed an America that had few happy endings for its citizens and one that acknowledged the existence of sexual abuse within its borders.
I:8444;679;It cynically dissected the cherished myth that a strong commitment to one's individualism would bring happiness and fulfillment.
I:8444;680;It was another of that general era showing spoiled young Americans rebelling against good jobs, secure futures, a sane society, morality, decorum, and wrecking a safe society.
I:8444;681;It shows them indulging in sex and drugs.
I:8444;682;I read up on the background and found out that this movie was one of the first to get a rating X in a mainstream theatre and the first to get academy award attention with such a rating.
I:8444;683;The flash backs helped you see that Voight's character came from a non.
I:8444;684;I saw this movie in 1970 and loved it.
I:8444;685;I wanted to see if it still had the same impact, and it is still a great movie.
I:8444;686;Dustin Hoffman is really a wonderful actor.
I:8444;687;I love Dustin Hoffman performace , not only is a very good looking actor he is an exelent actor"
688;"The chemistry between Voight and Hoffman is impeccable and ""Midnight Cowboy"" has gone on to be a cinematic classic."
689;The movie won three Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director for John Schlesinger, and Best Screenplay.
690;This beautiful 2 disc set features the film in breathtaking widescreen format cleaned from its original print.
691;"As a bonus there is an informative audio commentary by Jerome Hellman and a great featurette called ""After Midnight: Reflecting On The Classic 35 Years Later""."
692;"Siskel and Ebert give the film ""Two Thumbs Up!"
693;Joe Buck(John Voight) is a young overconfident Texan who knows he can please the ladies, and decides to go to N.Y. and be a hustler servicing ladies.
694;If I can say anything, the fella gets my vote for his confidence and bravery.
695;"Even though the film alludes to flashbacks that he was abused sexually by his grandmother, we can see what makes up the package of Joe Buck.Yet we don't get that with Rizzo
I:8444;696;I will be honest, for it's time, you'll see the grittiness of the big city and holding on to a dream even though the dream's not for you.
I:8444;697;The movie is a classic!
I:8444;698;A interesting and contriversal take from 1969.
I:8444;699;I love that it was edgy for its time, the main appeal of the movie.
I:8444;700;Just as good as when I first saw it over 40 years ago.
I:8444;701;The chemistry between the too is incredible.
I:8444;702;I must add though that they are in NJ, and I'm on Long Island.
I:8444;703;the shipping package was about the best packing I've ever received when ordering on the internet.
I:8444;704;This movie is superb, and a terrific critique of the underbelly of American society (and western society in general).
I:8444;705;aspects of the story line serves as a kind of entry point into various scenes which explore the relevant social issues.
I:8444;706;the geography and the movement in the movie are also symbolic: the west symbolises one type of life"
707;going job, and Ratso will be healed of his illness.
708;(Clever symbolism in his name.
709;"'Ratso' symbolises the scrounging scavening life he lives
I:8444;710;heroes'), the movie makes a profound statement about the squalid, seedy life of city society, and the characters trapped within it.
I:8444;711;The result is that the twists and turns of it are unpredictable, and therefore much more intersting.
I:8444;712;what is left is just a solid character drama with two superb actors in a time capsule.
I:8444;713;Voigt and Hoffman really are excellent actors.
I:8444;714;a great movie from a film history (and American history) perspective, but if you are looking for gripping, contemporary entertainment.
I:8444;715;Still, it is a classic and anyone interested in their film literacy should make a point of seeing it.
I:8444;716;This is a fabulous movie, even though it's been around a while!
I:8444;717;This was a really great movie by all who were in it.
I:8444;718;John Schesinger's classic drama won a Best Picture Academy Award and giving the award to this drama is about the most daring thing the Academy ever did.
I:8444;719;Digital artifacts are minimal and the condition of the print is surprisingly good.
I:8444;720;The audio likewise sounds extremely good with a new Dolby Digital 5.1 mix made from the original mono master soundtrack.
I:8444;721;schlesinger's film is still surprisingly powerful and the performances of the film are terrific.
I:8444;722;While original producer Jerome Hellman provides some interesting comments about the making of the film and his memory is quite good but the film would have benefited from someone on the creative side say Hoffman or Voight since both director Schlesinger and screenwriter Waldo Salt are dead.
I:8444;723;The half hour """"After Midnight: Relfecting on the Classic 35 years Later"""" is a marvelous documentary pulling together everything from footage of Voight auditioning with director Schlesinger to stories about the difficulty in getting the film made and all the hoops that producer, director, screenwriter and actors had to jump through."""
724;Because of the counter culture atmosphere at the time the film succeeded where earlier it might not have.
725;We also get a decent photo gallery with shots from the time and trailers for a variety of other MGM Special Editions.
726;"Oh and I can't forget that the set, like ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" features postcards with original images from the film."
727;"a terrific package from MGM, ""Midnight Cowboy"" looks marvelous here and blows away the previously available single disc edition with solid extras including an outstanding documentary on the making of the movie."
728;Also we get some collectable postcards, two solid featurettes on the film, a photo gallery and a solid commentary track from producer Jerome Hellman.
729;"This movie is rated # 36 in Newsweek magazine's ""Best 100 movies of the last Century""."
730;John Voight's character reminds me of guys I have known .
731;guys who think they are hot stuff, who have a lot to learn.
732;This is a terrific movie.
733;and a terrific time capsule, perfectly capturing the urban flavor that existed on the cusp of the 60s and 70s.
734;and the wonderful cinematic style of the era we seemed to lose long ago: the score, those perspective shots, the montage moments (the radio orange juice commercial is SOOO evocative of the period!)
735;The earlier film featured two dynamic young stars on the rise.
736;"voight and Hoffman make a perfect team, their varying types of energy and styles feeding off of each other in a drama in the way that Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon played off one another brilliantly in the comedy ""The Odd Couple."""
737;His first effort ends hilariously with Sylvia Miles, who earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for one highly memorable scene, bursting into tears after he has sex with her in her Park Avenue apartment and announces his intention of collecting money.
738;"She calls herself a ""sexy looking chick"" and, in her tearful resentment over being asked to pay Voight, finally extracts $20 from the down at the heels Texan before he leaves."
739;Hoffman is a real hustler, the New York kind who is street smart in contrast to the nave country boy Voight.
740;In one scene Voight has sex with a frightened young man in a theater.
741;The Midnight Cowboy copped Oscars in three major categories, Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writer, the last award going to former blacklisted scenarist Waldo Salt, who adapted James Leo Herlihy's novel to the screen.
742;He leaves cigarettes in front of a picture of Jesus as an offering.
743;he's strikingly handsome and exceptionally well.
744;But Ratso has something Joe needs .
745;He also seems to take some pleasure in helping Joe (rather than just taking advantage of him).
746;serving motivation for adding such elements to the story.
747;It's a novel about a man learning what the real values in life are.
748;Joe Buck grows to have a sincere, heartfelt concern for another person, and finds .
749;that this concern is what gives meaning to existance.
750;(As the novel tells us, he does his best thinking in front of a mirror.)
751;we see this distortion in several ways, starting with Dustin Hoffman's miscasting.
752;Under the dirty makeup, he's boyishly cute .
753;and the audience knows this.
754;when added to his comic overplaying of the role .
755;although the novel is narrated by the omniscient author, Joe Buck is the protagonist, and we see the events primarily through Joe's eyes.
756;"Anyone who reads the novel knows that ""Midnight Cowboy"" is about something deeper and more signficant than sexual attraction, explicit or implicit, between men."
757;another way the flm distorts the novel's meaning is its altering of Joe and Ratso's reasons for moving to Florida.
758;"although a terrible adaptation of an exceptional novel, ""Midnight Cowboy"" is, in fairness, a good film."
759;Midnight Cowboy is so earnestly .
760;"gritty and ""significant"" that I find much of it embarrassing to watch."
761;there is one moment that almost redeems the film, when Ratso tells Joe that he can't walk any more.
762;In delivering those two words, much as a child crying to his mother, Dustin Hoffman captures a profound fear of dying, of having his existance wiped out, better than I have seen any other actor reveal it.
763;serving treatment of a truly great novel.
764;Read it and see what you think.
765;(All 14 Amazon reviewers give it 5 stars, and most remark on its superiority to the film.)
766;Joe is like most Americans .
767;Hey, John, we got it the first time.
768;And that's what the novel is about .
769;it is telling that Joe is a prostitute .
770;It was so realistic, it frightened me.
771;Although it was filmed in 1969, it is still one of the most shocking and realistic films of all time.
772;Dustin Hoffman is equally as impressive with his role of Rizzo, a sleazy cripple who, oddly enough forms a friendship with the hustler Joe Buck.
773;This film is one easily one of the ten greatest films of all.
774;It is still a very good movie with great performances by both Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight.
775;Good movie for adult viewers.
776;Winner of best picture in 1969, this was the first film of its subject matter which, originally rated X, reached the hearts and minds of millions.
777;I recommend this to anybody who enjoys following the impulsive reality of the inexperienced individual who endeavours into unknown lands.
778;The unpredictability of the film will leave you with a gulp in your throat as well as with a new appreciation for legendary acting.
779;Schlesinger, in my opinion, tried and succeeded in fusing both worlds and created not only a snapshot of a time and place, but a whole sensibility.
780;But with a story as powerful as this, all gripes about the visual style of the film can easily be forgiven.
781;Comedies have probably faired best, because humor is timeless and what was funny 70 years ago will most certainly be funny today.
782;But let's take a quick look at the horror films of Universal Studios golden age.
783;Midnight Cowboy is, simply put, an excellent film, beautifully acted and expertly rendered.
784;"If you are able to get past some of the ""dated"" aspects of the movie, you'll be rewarded with an honest if gritty exploration of the price we pay for our individuality and the true nature of friendship."
785;it is touching and you really ccare for the chacters.
786;it has held up the test of time very well.
787;voight is also good too.
788;over the use to refer to intelligent adult flims like this one.
789;i thnk this is the best movie of the late 6os
790;This was one of the first movies to combine American and European styles in one film and by doing became a more important film technically than given credit for.
791;That it still is absorbing proves its worth.
792;This film was Best Picture at the Oscars.
793;He is befriended by a con man, and they soon become good friends.
794;The film has a good story, but a lot is not explained.
795;I feel this film is overrated.
796;Anyone who likes stories of friendship will like this.
