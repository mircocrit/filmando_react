1;Just watched this movie today and I'm 49 years old!
2;It's surprisingly funny and just a really enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon.
3;Kurt Russell is always a standout in whatever he does.
4;This is a perfectly executed movie.
5;It was a fun movie with good characters and enough plot to keep the movie entertaining for kids and adults alike
6;In one way, you are probably right, it is a kid's movie mainly in the fact that your kids will definetly enjoy it.
7;the plot is a simple hero coming.
8;"What makes it interesting is that our protagonist is a third generation ""hero,"" but not only that, he's the son of the two most celebrated heroes."
9;"Add into the mix the fact that he has not shown any ""hero"" powers, and you got a nice combination for this action."
10;all and all, I recommend this film for your kids, and even for yourself, if you were ever into comic books and the like.
11;I am always looking for nice movies for our family to enjoy together, something my husband and I can like as well as our daughters, 8 and 5.
12;I read the reviews for this movie and it sounded great.
13;Basically not a good movie for anyone.
14;this is one of the best family.
15;friendly action/comedies I've seen in a long time, and certainly the best live.
16;Sky High has a clever script, an excellent cast of grown.
17;charismatic) ensemble of young actors and actresses.
18;highly recommended and appropriate for all ages.
19;Thank you for providing a great video.
20;This is a good movie to watch with the kids as it is enjoyable for the adults as well, making it a good choice for family movie night.
21;Kurt Russell is great is the cocky dad who wants and expects his son to be a great super hero as well.
22;Most adults will enjoy all of the super hero jokes.
23;, sure to be a future star), Russell, and cameos by Bruce Cambell and Wonder Woman herself Linda Carter).
24;And they cling to Will because of who his mother and father are (the two strongest superheroes of all time).
25;will's willingness to stick with his true friends will be tested as other forces and higher classmen shmooze for his attentionAnd what's a superhero without a super.
26;______________________________________________________________________________SKY HIGH is fun, cheeky, and clean family film viewing.
27;there are also some great cameo appearances by super actresses and former superheroes.
28;this IS a fun film, no doubt about it.
29;The relationships (be it father/son or girlfriend/boyfriend) are executed well and get the viewer into these superkids' lives in a pretty intimate way.
30;The CGI is decent (not great, but good).
31;muscled costumes are pretty funny, too.
32;I'm 51 and my wife is 39 and we enjoyed this fine family entertainment very much.
33;An excellent job of casting all around, kids and adults both.
34;A good fast pace and just the right length at 99 minutes.
35;Simple values are the lesson here which are usually the best for this sort of fare.
36;Plenty of wit and other than a very funny Kids in the Hall line during the Save the Citizen competition there are no mean jokes in harmless but very cute, charming and always amusing flick.
37;Really quite perfect entertainment for all age groups.
38;there's a lot of 80's music covers which fits in the typical 80's high school plot of nerds vs the super cliques.
39;It the execution and wit that carries it, though.
40;Really, the acting is all quite fine and direction is sharp.
41;Predictablity really doesn't hurt the enjoyment, it's just a fun ride.
42;Let's see if they can keep it up.
43;I usually run from movies with a teenage cast but this movie is just plain wonderful.
44;The cast is great, the story is great and the characters adorable.
45;This year's class features some of the best, brightest and most powerfully gifted super.
46;But when an evil villain threatens his family, friends and the very sanctity of Sky High, Will must use his newfound superpowers to save the day and prove himself a Hero worthy of the family tradition.
47;sky High and Mr and Mrs. Smith were released on the same day and I enjoyed Sky High much more.
48;This movie is great for the whole family.
49;It has action, comedy, romance, what more can you ask for?
50;This is great family entertainment to be enjoyed by all.
51;So release the superhero within and let the fun begin!
52;'Sky High' features a great ensemble cast consisting of both knowns and lesser knowns.
53;Kurt Russell gives a wonderful tongue.
54;michael Angarano follows up his supporting role in 'Lords of Dogtown' with a strong performance in the lead role in 'Sky High.'
55;This is quite simply my favorite super hero movie of them all!
56;The plot is simple, but features a couple of interesting twists.
57;The cast is as diverse as the characters themselves.
58;It's humorous and serious all at the same time, and the relationships between the characters are realistically portrayed, despite their sundry powers need to save the world (or at least the world of their high school!)
59;"grab some popcorn and hit ""play""."
60;This is the kind of movie that is just plain fun!
61;But if you want a good family movie to watch and spend time together, this is it.
62;I'm sorry to tear down a family film but nobody over the age of 12 will have a good time.
63;This was such a fun movie.
64;This was just a good and clean movie that you can just enjoy!
65;I always liked this movie, and was glad to get it.
66;It is as fun to watch as it ever was.
67;not our favorite movie, though the kids seemed to like it.
68;All in all an okay movie to watch once.
69;Yes, it's campy, but so much fun!
70;It's over the top fun with a message or two tucked in.
71;We had a good time watching it with our tween daughter.
72;Kurt Russell did quirky well.
73;That is the premise for 2005's `Sky High', the live action family comedy from The Wonderful World of Disney.
74;will Stronghold is the son of the greatest Super Hero couple on the planet, the most anticipated new student at the secret super hero academy.
75;If that weren't enough, Will also has to contend with living up to his father's reputation, falling in love, and meeting his very own arch enemy.
76;What follows is an out of the ordinary mix of standard high school angst and comic book fantasy.
77;Dave Foley (New Radio) steals nearly every seen he is in as the long suffering side kick, er, Hero Support `All American Boy' to Kurt Russell's `Commander'.
78;most kid's under twelve will probably love this movie (my seven year old did), any kids older than that will probably find it a little too nice and cheerful.
79;As far as good clean family fun, you really can't beat it.
80;generation and raising kids who'll become the third.
81;the incredibly strong Commander (Kurt Russell), whose father was also a hero, and Jetstream (Kelly Preston), who has the gift of flight.
82;All of which makes it not only a fun and funny adventure but a story that will speak to youngsters.
83;perhaps more subtly than the usual teen angst.
84;After a lifetime of being a punching bag for my schools I put together a few convenient opportunities and made a run for the top of my school's popularity charts.
85;To my amazement (and most everybody else's) I was wildly successful, if only for one year.
86;And this is despite the fact that today, at my advanced age, I know that the price of coolness is originality and freedom and basically your soul.
87;I hated the person I was back then but I loved being him.
88;That time in my life was so intoxicating I may never get over it.
89;This being a Disney movie we all know that along they way Will will recognize the errors of his ways and return to his roots, but along the way director Mike Mitchell delivers a very clever, very relevant look at modern high schools.
90;I really liked the way the film attacked the self.
91;"One of the best scenes involves Will's dad complimenting him on actually hanging out with sidekicks, all the while condescending to them (""They've really lowered the bar at that school since my day."")"
92;My family generally enjoyed the theme and the movie, though.
93;I'd recommend it to those who enjoyed the Incredibles, as it is more family.
94;This movie was unexpectedly good.
95;i expected it to be silly fluffy fun but was surprised how much I liked it.
96;Sky High is the story of Will Stronghold, son of two legendary superheroes, The Commander and Jetstream.
97;"the daily ins and outs of a world where superheroes exist and are taken for granted add a great deal of fun and humor to the movie (I especially loved the traffic update: ""Evil struck the morning commute in the form of a giant robot downtown."
98;it's in the life lessons about being proud of who you are and your abilities (even if it's only being able to turn into a guinea pig or a puddle of goo) and that everyone has something to contribute.
99;Typical kid movie fare but done in a more than usually imaginative and fun way.
100;There were plenty of laugh out loud funny moments in the storyline, including some fun pokes at the superhero genre (Dave Foley was priceless as the former kid sidekick turned teacher, who yearns to get back in the game.)
101;The kid actors do a decent job in the movie but the real pleasure for this older viewer were the smaller adult roles with some fun familiar faces.
102;i would definitely recommend this for kids, say about age 8.9 and up, and it's a family friendly movie that won't have adults clawing their eyes out or crying for insulin afterward.
103;but the scene where the villians are struggling with infant car seats is a classic!
104;I am very satisfied with the product.
105;odds are you'll love it.
106;My wife LOVES this movie.
107;"We love the values the movie shows
108;This year's freshman class includes future defender of the world Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano).
109;There's a cultural divide between heroes and sidekicks, and some of those with the greatest powers use their special skills to bully others.
110;When his power finally manifests itself, he moves over to the hero class .
111;but I must say it is exceedingly entertaining, as well.
112;This is a film that kids will love, teens will be able to identify with, and most adults will find very entertaining.
113;The laughs are plentiful, the special effects are right on the money, and the emotional aspects of this coming of age story play extremely well.
114;I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish.
115;It is, in a word, super.
116;A very entertaining movie for Teens, and adults that can appreciate the tongue.
117;This comedy had everyone in our family laughing most of the way through it.
118;Kids loved it because all the 'stars' of this movie had super powers.
119;So it made for dazzling (if not cheezy) extra effects.
120;My seven year old loved this movie.
121;For adults it was good, but you can predict the plot throughout.
122;but for a family flick it's really good.
123;ASky High is a pretty good movie it's full of great action and great actors like, kurt russle.
124;this is a really good movie.
125;if you're into superheros you'll love this movie.
126;i recommend it to everyone
127;Some action, intrugue, and humor.
128;Good acting and a good storyline that keeps you involved to the end.
129;Highly recommended for just about anyone.
130;good family moviegood storygood lesson for kids to take away fromfunny too, effects are good too.
131;fi great but worth it
132;Everyone in the family will enjoy this movie, even if they are not into the Super Hero genre!
133;I am a fan of profound films, you know """"meaty"""" ones, with jarring plots, and humanistic stories."""
134;The PQ was great, and the story was engaging, as it reminded me of all of the challenges of HS.
135;"I love Superman and generally enjoy the ""superhero"" genre."
136;This was a fun spin, with cool characters, and of course, many interlaced Disney messages, and I'd highly recommend this, for a fun night of Blu.
137;Great movie for the whole family to enjoy.
138;We have watched it together and know we will watch it again, over and over.
139;And especially this movie because it was just so simple and good.
140;Of course it didn't knock out spiderman or kick batman on his butt but hey it was still a great movie.
141;Though I really urge you to give this one a try, I thought it was excellent.
142;There are a lot of a stories within the super.
143;hero genre about the teen who suddenly comes into their power (the classic example being Spider.
144;That's because, if properly handled, it's a potent idea with huge potential for both angst and humor.
145;will Stronghold is the son of the world's two greatest super.
146;With a father who's the strongest man on Earth and a mother who can fly at supersonic speeds, great things are expected of Will Stronghold as he lives up to their super.
147;will manages to hide this fact until his first day at Sky High, a super.
148;"There kids are immediately sorted into two groups, which are very much the ""haves"" and ""have nots"": those with impressive super."
149;will finds himself very much one of the outs, his friends a boy whose only super.
150;power is he can glow .
151;dimly, a girl shapeshifter whose only alternate shape is a guinea pig, another boy whose power is melting into a puddle of oil, and Will's best friend since first grade, Layla, who actually has a really cool super.
152;for all that this is a Disney comedy, it's rarely laugh.
153;Russell has had such success as a dramatic actor, a lot of people forget he made his mark in Disney comedies, and he's actually a fine comedian with a flair for over.
154;His scenes with Will are not only funny but genuinely touching.
155;Steve Stronghold is not only the world's most powerful man, he just may be the world's best dad.
156;Okay, it comes apart a bit at the end.
157;Still, Sky High is well worth watching.
158;It's the freshest Disney comedy in years.
159;"It is always a struggle to find a movie at the video store for ""family movie night"" that both of my elementary school daughters will enjoy and I will, if not enjoy, be able to tolerate."
160;"When my younger daughter chose ""Sky High,"" I was not terribly optimistic, but Disney actually did a pretty good job making it sort of fun for this GenXer."
161;"disney used a lot of great tricks to transcend the generational gap in ""Sky High."""
162;For GenY, some of the costumes, acting, and special effects were very much reminiscent of the wildly popular, live.
163;For Gen X, a wonderful little trick that I had not seen before, although I have to imagine it has already been employed, is the use of classic, coming.
164;For both Baby Boomers and some early GenXers, the casting of Kurt Russell is sort of an interesting bookend to Russell's Disney career.
165;This is the kind of movie that made Disney what Disney was.
166;"If we see more ""Sky High's,"" Disney will very soon once again become the entertainment powerhouse it used to be."
167;My family really enjoyed this movie.
168;A clever and entertaining story line with suspense and humor where the underdogs truly come out on top and a group of unlikely friends bond together and even enemies find acceptance.
169;I am so glad I found this movie.
170;It's just a honest plain good fun type of movie.
171;It's a feel good movie!
172;Fun as he goes about business.
173;We loved the movie Sky high.
174;it is a Great movie for kids.
175;It was a great movie!!!!
176;Good family flick or just a kid flick
177;This is a great movie!
178;I didn't expect much, but I was really impressed.
179;age themes, this movie is perfect for you.
180;Always loved comic books and here's a live action one!
181;Great cast and humorous story.
182;I hate PG movies now but this is actually funny movie that Adults will not want to miss.
183;just the occasional and natural high school boy/girl kiss.
184;i love everything about it!
185;its kind of a kids movie but im wayyyy older and still love it!
186;The special effects are excellent, the script is smart and the action is not boring!
187;Everything about this movie is fun in the best degree, there isn't anything wrong with the movie.
188;This is a serious movie, but that makes it even more special and great!
189;Overall, if you want a fun movie for all ages, get this!
190;Adults and kids will love it!!!
191;better just do yourself a favor and grab a magazine/book/kindle/something .
192;a nice twist to the story.
193;You see the humor here.
194;Actually he is a *very* attractive young man, who plays a complex character well.
195;Check out his genuine smile on the extra features of the disc .
196;"he is definitely ""top model"" material."
197;the story has a good pace, interesting characters, and unlike made.
198;giving us entertainment with a clear line between Good versus Evil.
199;They show us the virtues we admire .
200;This is one of the better movies I've seen.
201;It is very family oriented, and also a good fun time.
202;It satisfies that inner hero within yourself.
203;But it is sufficient to say that there is one and you will enjoy it.
204;The acting is very good, and you will care about the characters by the end of this film.
205;this movie is also very creative.
206;Anybody that has ever read a comic book, or rooted for the underdog, will enjoy this movie.
207;even though this is a children friendly movie, this movie also has enough for adults.
208;It is witty, and well written.
209;i can easily recommend this movie to all viewers.
210;and I don't think anyone would care to read it, so I'll keep silent on the details).
211;watch for a cameo by Lynda Carter (best.
212;"Newcomer Michael Angarano, Danielle Panabaker, the lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead and the rest of the cast, which includes Dave Foley (voice of Flick in Disney/Pixar's smash hit ""A Bug's Life"") and Cloris Leachman (""Young Frankenstein"") turn in impressive performances."
213;I love superhero movies and this one is funny and tasteful.
214;It's a great movie for children and young adults.
215;This is a movie that you can see over and over again with good down to earth comedy and is good for the whole family.
216;"I've got love for any film that'll showcase Spandau Ballet, and SKY HIGH is pretty generous in showcasing one of my childhood anthems, ""True."""
217;Besides, SKY HIGH is worth many repeat viewings.
218;As I recall, this offering from Walt Disney Pictures demonstrated strong legs at the box office.
219;Will Stronghold is the third generation child of a family of superheroes.
220;who also happen to be the world's greatest caped crusaders, the invincible Commander and Jetstream, mistress of super.
221;tech learning establishment ideal for molding tomorrow's super.
222;swings around and Will arrives at the moment he'd been dreading, exhibiting his lack of powers.
223;Mr. Boy is terrifically played by Dave Foley.
224;up model, and this lends an immediate appeal and a realness to his role.
225;There's a guy who glows (a hilarious Nicholas Braun).
226;The only one with serious powers is Will's best friend, Layla, who can manipulate plant life.
227;Except that Layla, deeming the hero.
228;I love the scenes in the Hero Support class.
229;Thru character development and a solid script, the story allows you to get to know these lovable underdogs.
230;Another strength of the film is that the cast .
231;consisting of teens and established actors .
232;And she is still gorgeous.
233;It makes you realize that Kurt Russell grew up in front of our eyes.
234;A featurette which takes you behind the scenes with the cast and crew (00:15:18).
235;She wanted to add it to her movie collection!
236;I thought the movie was done very well.
237;but I was surprised and actually entertained by this kid's movie.
238;The kids will love it, the older ones might.
239;My kids 9 and 11 really enjoyed this movie.
240;My family liked this movie very much.
241;It is not a movie that is too deep but it is fun to watch and it is nice and clean.
242;A fun family film that the whole family will enjoy.
243;I like family films that are good for adults as much as kids and this is one of them.
244;The story is a good combination of the Incredables and Harry Potter.
245;The story is fun but at times it drags on and has some corney moments but it's a disney family film so who cares.
246;The visuals are good and the direction is also good.
247;Overall the film was fun for the whole family and I would like to see some sequals becouse it would be fun to see more adventures from Sky High.
248;I accidentally stumbled onto this on a Disney channel, and laughed myself silly through it.
249;i'm still surprised at all the actors they got for this.
250;I really enjoyed the scenes I didn't get to see before.
251;The ensemble cast worked together great.
252;Great special effects, as well.
253;The kids were really brave to try some of it!
254;Some of whom have gone on to quite a few adult juicy roles, showing they had, and still have, plenty of acting chops.
255;this is a movie I definitely recommend for plain good fun!
256;"so it was refreshing to see Disney hit a homerun this time with ""Sky High""."
257;"the last few years we have seen a large amount of super hero movies, from Spider man to the Incredibles, and while they all use the time honored tradition of super powers these new ones tap into an element I would call the ""humaness of the supers""."
258;please pick this movie up!
259;my kids love it, I love it and even my wife tolerates it.
260;Get it, watch it, and enjoy.
261;As a comic book fan I am fairly critical of movies based on the topic of super.
262;This one was very fun to watch and poked fun of every super clich you can think of.
263;If you are a comic book fan particularly of DC Comics you'll really get a lot of the more subtle jibes.
264;Keep in mind that this is a film for all ages and in the classic Disney style.
265;There is no crude humor and no scathing satire but it is still funny and great for the whole family.
266;Great family movie teaching values of friendship and trust.
267;It's actually a witty, smart and entertaining picture.
268;great movie for the kids, but fun for the whole family.
269;I grew up on the Silver Age Comics (60s) of the heroes with high ideals and teams.
270;It is a great clean movie that mom and dad can sit down and watch with the kids without embarrassment!
271;very good from start to finish loved everybody in the movie and fire boy was reallly hot
272;Love this movie and it was so hard to find a good copy.
273;The movie itself is silly but fun a movie that make you feel good when you need a pick me up.
274;If you love comic books, Kids in the Hall, or Super Troopers.you must watch this movie.
275;minute cameos in Spiderman 1 and 2!
276;p. p. s. Almost as good as The Incredibles and that's a bold statement.
277;My kids and I both enjoyed this film.
278;You can read the other reviews for the story which is rather clever.
279;I saw this movie in theaters with high hopes, and I wasn't dissapointed.
280;I loved the storyline and all of the characters.
281;This is one of the greatest Disney creations ever.
282;what I didn't expect was to be entertained, and even surprised at the interesting twist.
283;"But for wholesome fun and that ""enjoyability"" factor, it scored better."
284;this is a perfect movie for its intended audience .
285;This is a very good movie!
286;Kurt Russell was in some Disney superhero movies in the late 70's and this is a kind of a modern version of one of them!
287;The story is overall good and yes it is somewhat predictable, yet I was drawn in by some of the characters and to their lives.
288;I felt some of their struggle.Yet at the same time this movie does not try to be serious at all and that is the fun of it!Very funny and engaging and wholesome family fun!
289;Good kids movie would be better with the extras looks great in blue.
290;ray is good to see Kurt Russel do comedy
291;I loved this movie, and even better in blue ray.
292;it's a good fantasy movie, and has a timeless appeal.
293;Kurt Russell is good as the super hero dad.
294;I'm a fan, so it makes perfect sense to me.
295;anyone who likes fantasy and super heros w/a dash of villiany will love this movie.
296;Plus the ending makes you like it too!
297;My 10 year old gives it 3 stars, my 7 year old gives it 4.
298;Personally, I liked the music (they remade a lot of music that was popular when I was a teenager), and it was pretty funny here and there.
299;it is the first day of high school at SKY HIGH for freshman Will Stronghold, son of superhero power couple The Commander and Jetstream.
300;Will he be able to save his family and the world?
301;SKY HIGH is cute, sweet, and perfect for families.
302;Just plain, good, clean fun.
303;I, personally, found myself grinning throughout most of this film, enjoying the sheer cuteness of it.
304;the entire cast does a nice, campy, over the top job of it (hey, they ARE superheroes and super villains, after all), but I especially enjoyed the appearances of Lynda Carter, Cloris Leachman, and Bruce Campbell.
305;The story is typical Disney, with a happy ending and good messages.
306;SKY HIGH teaches kids to be true to themselves, true to their friends, and true to what they believe, all wrapped up in a live action comic book.
307;SKY HIGH is an easy, breezy, light.
308;hearted summer flick, perfect for the entire family.
309;I love this movie and so do my kids.
310;I recommend this movie to kids of all ages.
311;Has great casting for adults too.
312;This is a great movie for kids and adults.
313;So I love this movie and I never thought I would admit that.
314;So I order it and it came in a few days, problem was that the packaging was damaged as was the case.
315;A very interesting concept that could have been reduced to a silly kids film.
316;cape, Superman in Smallville and the Harry Potter franchise entering into the high school years, not to mention the success of Prof. Xaiver's school of mutants.
317;"So naturally the time was right for a film that is part ""Breakfast Club"" and part ""Fantastic Four."""
318;Will Stronghold, the protagonist teen, and the son of two of Earth's greatest heroes (played terrifically by Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston) has a lot to live.
319;"Adding to his natural teen anxieties Will is surrounded by ""gifted"" teens and intense teachers including Bruce Campbell, Lynda Carter, and Cloris Leachman."
320;Effects are important in the superhero genre, even the super.
321;the visuals are just the right balance of comic book realism, some key moments being the transformation of the mild.
322;"mannered school bus into the supersonic Sky High Bus and the ""Save the Citizen"" homage to the X. men's Danger Room is great fun."
323;"the soundtrack is the perfect clue to the `80's high school spoof with tunes you might misremember hearing in ""Sixteen Candles"" but, it definitely adds the right flavor."
324;"family fun for the whole family, but may disappoint hardcore comic fans in it pedestrian handling of the material, especially on the heels of similarly themed projects like ""The Incredibles."""
325;"Meanwhile, they'll continue saving the world and Will will continue his ""hero support"" classes."
326;This movie was funny, entertaining, and full of adventuresome moments.
327;If you liked the Incredibles, I'm sure you'll like this one.
328;This movie is great entertainment for kids, expecially on long car trips and plane rides.
329;Great for kids and there imagination.
330;fortunately for Will, the prettiest and most popular girl in school, Gwen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), takes a shine to him.
331;"Because of this ""in"" with the In Crowd, Will's confidence soars, and he soon begins to develop Super Strength and the ability to fly."
332;The Prom becomes a revenge fest, in which Will and Warren, backed by the Sidekicks, on one side, and Gwen (aka Major Pain) engage in a titanic battle between Good and Evil.
333;angst elements of a Teen Movie (including the obligatory housewrecking party), with one.
334;The result is light and entertaining, and rarely misses a beat.
335;kurt Russell is wonderfully goofy as Dad Stronghold, both battling evil and sneaking Will down into the Secret Sanctum for a game of pinball.
336;danielle Pannabaker is the great surprise in SKY HIGH.
337;When she finally uses her powers, they are entirely in character for her and yet unusual, a true expression of Female Power at its best.
338;sTAR effort, SKY HIGH is good family fun fare.
339;The whole family enjoyed this from the 6 year old to the 14 year old.
340;A real hit for movie night.
341;It was new and looked great in the packaging.
342;When we played it, it showed beautifully with no scratches or skips.
343;That way the kids get to keep things real.
344;This is a scene we have seen before being played by kids with superpowers (she controls flora, he plays with fire), but it is played with a refreshing honesty and makes it clear these are real kids and not just cartoon superheroes.
345;"But just as the lines are drawn between ""us"" and ""them,"" Will's powers kick in and he switches sides."
346;All of those minor superpowers enjoyed by Will's sidekick friends are going to be the powers needed at the right time and the right place.
347;The screenplay was written by Paul Hernandez, Robert Schooley and Mark McCorkle, and whoever wrote the last line of the film go the final punch line right.
348;This is really a cute movie, which is certainly not a bad thing in this case.
349;It was good, clean humor (with some kissing that grossed out my older kid!)
350;The movie has an interesting premise: a school for super heroes and their sidekicks.
351;The story kept my interest all the way through.
352;the Bonus features showing how some of the stunts were done by the actors themselves was a great peak behind the scenes.
353;Though i find the movie tacky and expectable, both my kids 9, and 5, found it fun and fascinating.
354;"So if they like it, I like it 
355;This is definitely one of my favorite super hero movies.
356;It's fun and it's just visually appealing.
357;I thought the story was pretty well written, considering it's a movie geared towards a younger crowd.
358;The acting was pretty good as well.
359;This is a great film.
360;oscars great, but a truly fun film for all ages.
361;The film's casting was excellent, the characters were well done and acted, and the story was cute.
362;I laughed, I smiled, I just enjoyed this film from the first frame to the last.
363;In fact, I *still* feel good when I think of it.
364;That's right, it's not just for kids, because I'm 50 and I loved it.
365;I loved Kurt Russell in the computer wore tennis shoes and he is great in this movie as Commander.
366;Great little flick that our kids and us really enjoyed.
367;Kurt Russell is perfect for this role, and it's just a fun filled movie with just the right amount of silliness.
368;If your kids are between 6 and 12, they're sure to like this and it's perfect for a weekend night of movies with the family.
369;Both my seven year old daughter and I (her 40 year old mother) loved this movie.
370;i am a huge Buffy fan.
371;Also have always read comic books and enjoyed the Xmen movies immensely.
372;An Sf fan through and true.
373;this movie had the right balance of angst and lightheartedness to appeal to a very wide age range, and yet .
374;the actors in this movie did a fine job, and I hope to see them in the *Sequel*.
375;Its one of her favorite movies.
376;Having no powers at all, Will ends up in the Sidekick course, as does his best friend, a very pretty girl with an amzing power which she refuses to demonstrate because she despises the superhero/sidekick division.
377;this is a film that everyone should enjoy.
378;Kids will love the exciting story and spectacular special effects, and there is plenty of humour that will appeal to adults.
379;It started showing on TV like 2 months ago and I found out Bruce Campbell was in it so I decided to watch but it turned out to actually be a good movie.
380;Yeah there are cheesy parts but overall it's funny and has good action.
381;My Grandson and I watch it at least once a month .
382;I'm sure they will share it with many friends.
383;this was one of the best movies that i saw all year!
384;Will Will develop any powers to help cope with these problems?This movie is supposed to be mindless fun for the young and young at heart, and it succeeds mightily.
385;All the actors do a great job, especially the mostly unknown teen cast.
386;The adults in the film have fun with their rolls.
387;Everyone's trying to do a good job but have fun at the same time, and that spirit draws you into the film.
388;I especially enjoyed Lynda Carter's brief appearances as the school principal, and she gets the best line out of the entire movie.
389;The special effects are decent and help draw you into the film.
390;The wide screen picture and full surround sound are great.
391;Extras include a music video (Bowling for Soup with """"I Melt with You""""), bloopers, behind the scenes, stunts, and an alternate opening."""
392;Of these, the only one really worth watching is the alternate opening.
393;It's fun and helps fill in a couple plot points from the movie better.
394;this is the perfect movie to watch with the family or after a long week when you just want to relax.
395;"Not one of Kurt Russell's ""best"", but a fun one."
396;I bought this movie on a whime because i had an amazon giftcard and I was feeling nostalgic.
397;This movie was even better than I remembered from watching it as a kid!
398;This is my 13 year old daughter's favorite movie to watch over.
399;This is from a girl who also is very into Grown up shows like 'How I met your mother', so its nice that she still likes movies like this.
400;the idea of a high.
401;school for superheroes is a cool one.
402;sidekick dichotomy is also interesting, and makes for some interesting conflicts.
403;This movie is more like a comic.
404;book, instead of the more serious and realistic note that the X. men movies took on, but that's what I liked about this movie.
405;The ending is a bit of a surprise but is also fun to watch, with a few revelations along the way.
406;Overall a fun and light super.
407;I'm a teacher and this is a fun, family movie that I can show the kids on field trips (on the bus traveling).
408;Said it was his new favorite movie.
409;Great price, fast shipping, works great.
410;This movie was a cool family flick.
411;It really was a cool movie.
412;I am a fan of superhero movies!
413;This was a good one.
414;Kurt Russell seemed a bit wooden to me, but the other adults did a great job, and really seemed to be enjoying themselves.
415;my wife and daughter loved this movie too.
416;Our daughter is four, now, and was scared during some of the more intense moments.
417;so, all in all a really enjoyable movie.
418;I hope to see a sequel.
419;"Steve (""The Commander"") has super."
420;"strength and Josie (""Jetstream"") can fly."
421;A hero has a real superpower, whereas a sidekick may have a power, but not something powerful.
422;with good special effects, good acting, an interesting story and good direction (under Mike Mitchell), the family.
423;"friendly ""Sky High"" is a very entertaining film for young and old alike."
424;deserved 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.
425;Our little guy loves this movie.
426;This is a great movie!!
427;(The right people will know why that was funny.)
428;His very special power is that he is speedy fast and zooms around the house and outside.
429;Of course, once there young Will (nicely played by Michael Angarano) meets up with the typical high school bullies and a seductive temptress played by Mary Elizabeth Winsted.
430;It's all innocuous fun and in its own way, fairly entertaining, with some nice 80s songs to boot.
431;It was cute, but not stupid like I thought it would be.
432;I had fun watching this movie.
433;This is one of my favorite movies.
434;What I like the most about the movie besides its obvious spoofing of other superhero movies is the music.
435;Not only did they have great 80's music in this movie, but they used it in such a way that it actually helped tell the story.
436;"Playing ""Voices Carry"" in the background was the perfect touch."
437;yes, it is far fetched, but it is clean, funny, and didn't any of you ever dream about becoming a super hero.
438;My kids and I like to watch it.
439;Adults will enjoy this movie as well.
440;the super hero side is really an interesting twist.
441;They could've made the same movie with the young star trying to live up to his Dad's legacy in football, but instead they took the approach of having a young man who's father is a great super hero.
442;Add in a fun plot and you have a movie that the whole family can enjoy.
443;the young actors/actresses do fine, but Kurt Russell really shines in his role.
444;He was perfectly cast, as was Kelly Preston as the superhero.
445;the movie's theme is basically that we're all important and we should respect all of our peers.
446;This was a fun movie with a nice message.
447;But this film succeeds admirably.
448;equal parts teen film and superhero movie, it's surprising how well the two genres mesh here.
449;There's a creativity at work that builds a seamless combination that has all the story elements of each that work together to create a terrific, fun film.
450;the writing, acting, and special effects are all top notch.
451;There's even some nice superhero action thrown in.
452;overall, a very entertaining movie.
453;it is a good family movie.
454;I like it and also good for the kids.
455;always looking for movies I will want to watch too.
456;It's good to see Kurt Russell back in a Disney movie again.
457;"The usual ""high school"" high jinks occur in this family friendly comedy with some new interesting twist."
458;"Lynda Carter has a small amusing role at ""Sky High""."
459;I give this one 4 stars for it's sheer fun.
460;We saw this while visiting Denver and it turned out to be the perfect film for the adults as well as the 13 and 8 year olds.
461;Lots of laughter and silliness.
462;It felt fresh and still had a nice feel aside from all the super hero antics.
463;The storyline was decent enough.
464;And a bit more imagination as far as special powers could have been used.
465;But I liked the characters.
466;Kurt Russell is the best.
467;Kelly Preston is also very good in it.
468;This movie is predictable but my young son likes it.
469;This story is about super hero kids with special powers.
470;It has some fun special effects and a positive message for young children.
471;It is a safe movie for children and has some cute moments.
472;This is a fun family movie.
473;It's great on rainy days or in the car on the road.
474;This is an enjoyable and clean movie for the whole family to watch.
475;We loved it and is one of our favorite movies.
476;We give it 2 thumbs up.
477;We've seen this several times, good family movie with some fun action.
478;It's a cute movie that I'd watch again.
479;This is a fun kid flick that is at the top of the pile of overacted Disney fair.
480;The themes are well presented, and the characters engaging.
481;My siblings and I have quoted lines from this for years.
482;If you are a kid or can overlook some cheesiness, this movie is a blast.
483;A Dizzy movie I liked that sort of combines the high school cliquestype movie with comic book superheros.
484;This is a great funny movie!
485;It's fine for what it is.
486;The acting was a little cheesy, but It had our whole family laughing, and even some of them hooting with the action.
487;It also is a favorite of mine.
488;old who appreciates a good, clean movie.
489;This movie has great characters, a fun story and nothing to feel bad about showing to kids, with the exception of some super.
490;It is well done overall and leaves a feeling of pleased satisfaction.
491;friendly way to pass the time.
492;Bruce C and Kurt R. it's a good movie for family.
493;Would've preferred there to be more of a battle sequence within the city, but it worked out quite well all in all.
494;I love all the hero and the stars in the movie.
495;My kids really like the movie.
496;This is my 2 1/2 year old boy's favorite movie (and I don't find it really annoying either).
497;It's pretty fun and Disney so there's nothing too scary or adult for him.
498;Great family movies can be hard to find.
499;Sky High has a rare combination of humor, action, and plot.
500;Sky High also addressed issues around family, the struggles that a teen will face in high school.
501;Any one looking for a great family film this is the one.
502;Sky High is light, fun, and depicts morals and values (once again something many films are seriously lacking).
503;"Sky High is fun for all ages
504;I highly recommend this movie.
505;Sky High is one of the most pleasant surprises of recent years, a comedy/adventure that's funny, solid with the action scenes, and thoroughly charming.
506;A superhero movie that fits far more snugly into the comedy genre than most but that, thank Heaven, doesn't sink into a stupid parody, it's a nice change of pace from the more serious superhero films like the X. men trilogy or """"Batman Begins"""" (which, of course."""
507;view character is Will (Michael Angarano), the son of the world's two greatest superheroes, The Commander and Jetstream (Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston).
508;The two are part of a clique that forms in the early going, and the student body quietly dreads the upcoming tryouts that determine who gets assigned to which camp .
509;Add to this a growing plot thread of some kind of secret threat menacing the school, and you're all set up for a great ride of a movie.
510;I agree with the reviewer who said that real.
511;life high school should be this much fun.
512;the movie has fun with a lot of classic superhero themes without mocking them, and isn't too goofy that the action sequences become pointless.
513;"great fun
514;all ages will love this move.
515;it is fun, adventurous, funny, and family friendly.
516;old son and found it to be entertaining and gripping throughout.
517;If it doesn't worry you, you'll likely enjoy this storyline which includes both some predictable and unpredictable twists.
518;This film is terrific for what it is: a spoof of comic books and comic book films (particularly the goofier ones like the Batman TV series of the 1970s).
519;The film pokes fun at the genre and at itself.
520;the performances are, for the most part, great.
521;Kurt Russell, the films only big.
522;budget star, seems to be having a terrific time hamming it up as The Commander.
523;The kids all do a fine job, as well.
524;some have said this film is """"The Incredibles"""" meets """"Harry Potter"""", and that's fair, but I found """"Sky High"""" to be much wittier and more entertaining than those films ."""
525;Product was brand new, shipped quickly, and works great.
526;It was given as a gift and my daughters loved the movie!
527;Great dialog aside, it felt way too small!
528;If you're going to do a SUPER hero show, have a Super hero setting with people doing Super heroic stuff in a Super realistic shot.
529;I bought it for the story and dialog.
530;My daughter and I both love this movie.
531;the son of the world's greatest superheroes(and married couple) The Commander and Jetstream.
532;a genuinely entertaining superhero pastiche that is actually one of the best superhero films of the decade.
533;Imaginative and with a firm understanding of what it is that makes superheroes fun and inspiring, the picture is filled with great performances and truly thrilling action sequences.
534;Kirk Russell is very good.
535;If you happen to like that, then maybe you'll enjoy the movie.
536;As good as MIB for taking a genre and making it lightly farcical yet serious enough to genuinely care about all of the characters.
537;This is a very family friendly movie, and my kids watch it over and over.
538;Sky High (2005) is a fun film that explores a world where superheroes and superpowers are a part of everyday life, and the children of superheroes attend a special high school suspended high above the Earth.
539;His father Steve Stronghold (Kurt Russell) is The Commander, a being with super strength.
540;solid entertainment for the whole family, Sky High explores life in a most unusual high school, and nicely develops the evolving relationships between Will, Gwen, Warren, and Layla.
541;The appearance of his powers brings many changes for the dorky Will, and not all of them are positive.
542;This sets the stage for a tremendous battle at homecoming, where it takes the combined superpowers of all the young teens, to defeat an unexpected and deadly threat.
543;The special effects which are solid throughout, rocket to a new heights in the finale.
544;will is a goofball, makes lots of mistakes, and isn't exactly ideal hero material, but he does the right thing, and steps up when it counts.
545;Mary Elizabeth Winstead seems too mature to play a high school student, but the beautiful and athletic actress is such a joy to watch.
546;Dressed mostly in a rubber suit, Kurt Russell is also very entertaining, seeming to revel in overplaying his role.
547;The film's soundtrack, made up of 80's pop tunes, is an interesting oddity.
548;My son Owen loves this out of all his movies.
549;It has a really good family feel to it.
550;He loves all the action.
551;Very good for family movie night.
552;"like beauty (always blonde)
553;Now, subvert these rules and add to them the formula of super heroes and super heroines, and what do you get?
554;True, `Sky High' provides some amusing moments, but the story of an underdog who becomes a super.
555;spirited Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell), and he goes to the sidekick class.
556;some comic fans might enjoy watching the film, spotting references to the genre.
557;This is a fun, if not stellar, coming.
558;age movie that will appeal to the whole family.
559;The premise is clever"
560;"Themes such as the ""first girl friend,"" ""hanging with the cool crowd,"" and ""pleasing dad"" are intelligently handled."
561;It is also neat to see this sort of movie focus on a male character, and the problems he encounters.
562;the violence here is so comic bookish that it helps keep the laughs and the characters moving.
563;kurt Russell does an exceptional job playing the slightly oblivious father.
564;Kelley Preston is the absolutely drop.
565;The rest of the cast and characters are fun, although perhaps a bit stereotypical.
566;This was especially true for Layla (played by Danielle Panabaker), the alternate love interest who is a plant.
567;loving vegan who won't fight unless directly assaulted.
568;over all, I recommend this movie for benign laughs and a good time.
569;lately a new angle has become prominent in superhero films, that of the superfamilies.
570;success of Pixar's THE INCREDIBLES, I'm not sure, but movies about superfamilies are the latest fad.
571;Disney knows a good thing when they see it and cashed in on the fad early with SKY HIGH.
572;sKY HIGH is basically the story about a boy growing up and going to high school and learning to come to grips with the man he is becoming.
573;Will gets to attend a special high school, Sky High.
574;It's the place that all superhero kids go to train and develop their skills and powers.
575;Will's dad hopes that Will has super.
576;strength like himself while his mom would like to see him fly like herself, but is happy for him no matter what.
577;That is a good thing because Will doesn't have any powers and ends up getting tracked into the side kick regiment of the school.
578;The film has an impressive cast of supporting actors, including Lynda Carter (she once played Wonder Woman) as Principal Powers and Bruce Campbell as Coach Boomer.
579;That's something rare in a major motion picture (though Disney does a better job of that than any other studio in the business).
580;The main actor's youth added some realism and grounded the film, despite it's farfetched and imaginative story.
581;I knew it was a Disney film and I was expecting it to be a cheap knock.
582;I laughed quite a bit and surprisingly found myself enjoying the film.
583;My son really likes this movie and we got it for a great price.
584;We received it in the mail pretty quickly as well.
585;My kids and I love this movie.
586;The family is filled with virtue and fun.
587;Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston do a great job, and the kids are good without being too sarcastic and sassy.
588;It is so refreshing to see a movie like Sky High, a movie that is pure fun to watch for the whole family.
589;I just finished watching this movie, and I thought it was fantastic.
590;The storyline, albeit cliche, was well done, and the fine acting made it enjoyable to watch.
591;Kurt Russell is hysterical as the Superhero father.
592;The reason I gave this movie high marks is because it had mass appeal.
593;You could watch it as an adult and just be throroughly entertained by it from start to finish.
594;It is definitely a movie you could watch over and over again.
595;Great movie for the kids, I even liked watching it.
596;This was a fun movie to watch over and over.
597;This movie combines good vs evil, light and darkness, young and old with action.
598;The result is an enjoyable flick I watch over and over, at least once a year.
599;Kids and adults enjoy this movie together.
600;Sure it may come across as a glorified Disney TV movie but what elevates the film above that are the performances of the cast.
601;"Will (Michael Angarano) is the son of the greatest superhero the world has ever known
602;as usual Buena Vista provides an exceptional crisp transfer.
603;The sound is equally super with remarkably crisp and clear dialogue.
604;The surround speakers are nicely used putting you in the middle of the action.
605;while it appears that this film might have some mild mannered extras, most of them are pretty good overall.
