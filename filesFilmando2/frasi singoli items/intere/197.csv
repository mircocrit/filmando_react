id;spiegazione
1;After hearing and reading many good things about this movie, I decided that I had to watch it.
2;Hoosiers was a wonderful movie that inspired me.
3;This basketball team just hired a new coach, and his name is Norman Dale.
4;He had punched a player of his.
5;This first game provides a very memorable moment.
6;this movie is an inspirational classic.
7;He decides to come back though at a pivotal moment in the movie, when Dale's career is in jeopardy.
8;The rest of the movie show's how one team's heart and determination brought out the best of them.
9;It's an amazing story, and this sports movie is the greatest one I've ever.
10;see classic for all basketball fans.
11;without question, this family friendly story of hope and redemption proved that a movie can have a happy ending and still contain a good story enshrouded in talent.
12;There is a director's cut, which, among many other things, explains that the movie was filemd on a low budget with not so many perfect autumn days, etc. there is also full length footage of the actual team the story is based on, as well as a description of the real story of the team.
13;One of the greatest basketball movies of all time.
14;Will make you want to go and play after you watch movie.
15;and it's worth checking out.
16;Hoosiers wins the hearts of most viewers .
17;with its beautifully filmed opening scenes of Coach Norman Dale driving through rural Indiana early on an autumn morning.
18;Coach Dale and we realize that this almost austere landscape nurtures a passion for basketball.
19;of course, Hoosiers is first of all a great sports story, rightly called by many the greatest sports movie ever made.
20;One must concede that in this respect, Hoosiers follows the shopworn Hollywood formula: we follow a team through a single season as individuals forge themselves into a cohesive unit by hard work and discipline.
21;Hoosiers follows this formula, but the cinematography of the games' action, the musical score, and our desire to see these appealing underdogs prevail all sweep us along no matter how well traveled the journey.
22;it is mainly the stories of the adults, however, that provide the richness of this motion picture and keep us returning to it.
23;But even as the town drunk, Shooter has two admirable qualities: He knows basketball, and he knows, but does not tell, Coach Dale's secret.
24;the.year honors, but it is good enough.
25;"winning shot
26;The ground has been laid for father and son to forge a new and successful life together.
27;She tells the Coach that when she grew up in Hickory, her brother and the other boys who excelled at basketball were the stars.
28;She and the other girls lived in their shadows.
29;Instead, keeping the promise he had made to Myra, he tells the students that the players that stand before them are their basketball team.
30;In the world of Hoosiers Coach's good deed is rewarded, and Ollie, a most unlikely prospect, gets to savor the glory of a sports hero.
31;That theme is also familiar in movie classics such as Shane.
32;part of this development for the Coach, and for Myra and Shooter as well, is becoming able to talk honestly about personal feelings previously kept private.
33;The breakthrough comes when he tells her about the event that led to his being barred from coaching.
34;Shooter and his son make a comparable journey.
35;His son responds that he loves his father.
36;In the team's second game, the Coach is on the verge of striking a player on the other team.
37;At that pivotal moment, help arrives in the form of a knockout punch to the opposing player delivered by one of Coach's own players, Ray.
38;Both Ray and Coach are ejected, but as they leave the court together, they agree that Ray """"got him a good one."""
39;"Later Jimmy uses his talent by announcing to the town meeting that has just voted to fire the Coach, ""I play, Coach stays."
40;This statement is the first of only two times that Jimmy speaks in the movie.
41;one thing Coach Dale is absolutely certain about in the beginning: that he knows how to win at basketball.
42;The Coach accepts the team's play, and they deliver.
43;the championship game holds another surprise.
44;goliath triumph of the small.
45;Their victory brings a million.
46;The triumph of her team .
47;has vanquished the sense of inferiority within her and many other small.
48;beyond that, the stories of the adults in Hoosiers offer a comparison between life and sports that is refreshingly more thoughtful than usual where even our everyday speech contains countless sports clich s stressing that life is like a game.
49;Hoosiers does stress that in life, as well as sports, hard work, discipline, and good judgment are rewarded in the end.
50;There is a winner and a loser and when contest is over, it is clear to all who won and who lost.
51;The lives of Hoosiers' main characters demonstrate that life thankfully affords many opportunities to prosper and one's own success does not mean that someone else must fail.
52;Is that true for life, as well?
53;Yet who could disagree that we are all born with varied talents and abilities, and by pushing ourselves with differing degrees of discipline and dedication over a lifetime, we wind up with very unequal levels of skill and achievement.
54;the greatest sports movie ever made .
55;also celebrates the triumph of the individual in a world that often seems dominated by the collective sameness of the many.
56;What can I say about the best sports movie ever.
57;Anyhow, this is a great movie.
58;HOOSIERS is one of a handful of movies that make a statement about who we are and what makes our country great.
59;Individually they will remain destined to this fate for eternity.
60;As a group they can rise beyond all hope and make a statement from which their lives will become enriched from what they are able to accomplish given that initial spark and making the commitment to give it their all.
61;Composer Jerry Goldsmith must have seen greatness at the core of this film because he gave us one of the most inspiring scores ever composed for a film.
62;All the actors give us so much more than we have ever seen as well.
63;Each one contributed their best piece to the pie and that is what our country is truly all about.
64;One of the best sports movies ever made.
65;The sound in 5.1 is well distributed and rounded.
66;It sounds clear and awesome.
67;The image is just as good.
68;Well this is one of the best sport movies ever is just perfect.
69;Hackman delivers a perfect performance, truly belivable, as well as most of the cast.
70;The movie is based on a true story wich makes it twice as good.
71;a very good movie to remeber the importance of discipline and how team work can make ordinary people have extraordinary results.
72;The dramatic affect of character and team development is outstanding and enjoyable entertainment.
73;Would be a great film to show a group of young individuals.
74;warming movie with a great moral.
75;Hoosiers is a wonderful movie about a small high school in Indiana who's basketball team beats the odds and goes to the State Finals.
76;It is a wonderful Cinderella story that warms your heart.
77;He teaches them to respect his authority as coach and teaches the town to respect an outsider.
78;dennis Hopper gives an unforgettable performance as the town drunk and the father of one of the players.
79;It is an unforgettable tale that is backed by a wonderful musical score.
80;I recommend this movie to all basketball fans.
81;What a feel good movie!
82;My kids loved it asking to watch it again and again!
83;In fact, aside from `Friday Night Lights' I have yet to be truly impressed with a sports movie really.
84;What sets the film apart though are the wonderfully fleshed out characters that add weight and depth to the film.
85;It flows the same as most sports films do, but this film has heart whereas most sports movies do not.
86;The brilliant performances also aid in this regard, adding layers of emotional attachment to the people involved and causing the audience to invest themselves fully into the film.
87;The problem is that the town of Hickory is a very emotionally invested town, each and every individual taking a special interest in the basketball team, and so the insertion of new blood sends the town in a frenzy.
88;the film, like almost every other sports themed drama, makes a point to be an inspirational and moving film about overcoming obstacles to attain greatness, and in that respect it works much grander than most other films thanks to the wonderful performances by the cast.
89;Gene Hackman (one of our greatest working actors) is a joy as Norman Dale, giving his character so much warmth and undeniable charm.
90;He is the outcast, he is the rebel but he is so comfortable and charismatic that you want to rally beside him every step of the way.
91;She does a beautiful job of fleshing out her characters real drive and motivations.
92;the real star here is Dennis Hopper, who thankfully earned an Oscar nomination for his performance.
93;He isn't lazy with his portrayal but really works at building layers around this man.
94;This movie really has heart and soul, and it really raises the bar for all other sports related dramas to try and reach.
95;I love this movie and I have for years.
96;Remember watching it with my dad when growing up and we both still love it.
97;Great story with low points to appreciate the high points.
98;You feel for the coach and his assistant and the team then you gain a love for the story when their struggles come to a great high.
99;this is another movie that is great to watch when there is nothing on t. v. very inspirational, and the story is taken from true facts.
100;A clean movie that combines a reverence for prayer and athletics is a good movie.
101;This has both, it is a great movie.
102;There can be no doubt that this is one of the finest, well.
103;The casting is perfect and the direction flawless.
104;Hoosiers is set in a town in Indiana which is famous for its love of basketball.
105;In fact, it might take two viewings to really get the subtle nuances this movie delivers.
106;The soundtrack is beautiful as well.
107;This is one of those movies that delivers a special gift.
108;I have enjoyed this film in 1986 and always remember it like one of the best movies of all times.
109;You must have see it!
110;My kind of feel good movie.
111;Great movie and would recommend it to anyone.
112;One of the best sports movies i have ever seen.
113;One of the best sports films.
114;Hoosiers has a classic plot, good acting, and good basketball.
115;If you haven't seen it this one is a must.
116;Seen it before but wanted for my collection and even got a couple for gifts.
117;This is the best all time sports movie ever!!
118;If you grew up in Indiana and especially small town Indiana this has to rate as one of best Movies of all time.
119;Great movie to watch with the family or ball team.
120;Some mild cursing but a touching inspirational story based on true events that's sure to get everyone on the team fired up and ready to give it their all.
121;I enjoyed this movie because, even though I dislike most sports movies and can't stand to watch actual sports, it had wonderful subplots of romance and redemption.
122;Hoosiers is a feel good family film that always delivers emotionally.
123;and I never tire of watching it again and feeling those same emotions I felt as a 13.
124;year old cousin Drew wanted to review the film, and it was so great to see that nearly 25 years later, the film is still finding its audience.
125;I've followed all of Hackman's movies ever since Hoosiers and he remains to this day one of my favorite actors.
126;His role as Coach Norman Dale has an enormous range of emotions and detailed character traits, from subtle to violent.
127;Coach Dale cares deeply about the sport of basketball, his team, the players, his family, his friends, and all of the people he comes across in his life.
128;for those who would argue that Rudy (1993) is the best sports movie of all time, you're in luck, because director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo crafted both of these inspiring sports films.
129;Hoosiers is about basketball, the importance of working as a team, and redemption, i. e. second chances like Coach Dale receives.
130;Rudy is about football and the importance of the individual drive to succeed at something through hard work and perseverance.
131;Both movies are at the top of the sports movie genre.
132;But I think Hoosiers is where Anspaugh and Pizzo originated their magic touch for inspiration through sport and where they present the best movie package.
133;Hoosiers is definitely an 80s indie film.
134;You can see that the production budget was meager, but Anspaugh does a lot with very little to craft a classic film.
135;And I understand the mindset of the people.
136;He butts heads with many of the local townspeople as he builds his cinderella team from raw unrefined local talent.
137;Along the way, Coach Dale wins over one person at a time, starting with one of the most highly regarded school teachers, played by Barbara Hershey, who is also his love interest.
138;He simply knows what needs to be done to win.
139;It's a movie that dreams big and makes you dream big, even though its packaged in a very humble way.
140;Both look fine and sound fine on TV when you watch them and escape into the story.
141;But under scrutiny, one can see that the film needs some love to bring its glory to our new HiDef digital standards.
142;It's my favorite sports movie of all time and it will always have a special place in my heart.
143;It touched me as a young man at a time when hope and dreams were needed.
144;I have never seen a sports movie as good as this one and I have never seen Dennis Hopper in anything that I really liked before.
145;But his performance in this movie is Oscar worthy.
146;It is entertaining, heartwarming and full of great old school basketball.
147;A must see for all basketball and movie fans.
148;Hoosiers is the finest film about determination,loyalty and anything else ever done in film pertaining to sports.
149;Hackman and the whole cast gives it heart and soul.
150;One of the greatest sports movies ever!
151;Overall great story of basketball and love story.
152;love Gene and chemistry between the various characters in challenging situations.
153;we will watch piloting message stories an day over other offerings!
154;long Indiana resident, it's required that I love this movie.
155;life greatest basketball Cinderella story of all time!
156;It's one of the best feel.
157;The picture plays to our simplest emotions, and when it's over we cheer like crazy.
158;I also wanted to share some of my family history.
159;It was such a fantastic miracle that our team won and this movie captures it perfectly.
160;Received it quickly and its a good family movie.
161;This is a top film, a modern day David and Goliath tale with a number of enthralling subplots and twists.
162;It doesn't matter if you don't like sports or basketball, this film gives so much more.
163;It's all top draw .
164;cast, screenplay, production, recreation of the 50s era Hoosiers leaves you feeling good and thoroughly entertained.
165;I remember the emotions for the games.
166;Based on a true high school basketball Cinderella story that occurred in 1954 in Indiana, Hoosiers is a must.
167;see film about a team of young men who are forced to adjust to a brand.
168;Hackman survives and ultimately takes his team to the state finals and the championship game.
169;hoosiers features some great music and a heartwarming story line that will keep viewers rooting for the underdog team, Hackman's Hickory Hucksters, all the way to the end of the film.
170;The movie works on just about every level, with great drama and chemistry between the characters.
171;And the scenes on the basketball court keep the action moving at a fast pace, with an excellent score (Hoosiers was nominated for the Oscar for best music) that keeps you in suspense, even though you already know the outcome of the movie.
172;"But the main theme of the film is basketball, and I think it would have been best if this ""love"" scene had been eliminated."
173;as far as sports movies go, Hoosiers ranks among my favorites of all.
174;"It's an excellent representation of the American dream: Hackman getting a new start in life and success following his ban from college coaching
175;Hoosiers is one of those rare treats in modern cinema that works at most every level and holds your interest throughout, even when you know very well what is going to happen.
176;It's great sports entertainment, and a must.
177;see motion picture for fans of the game of basketball.
178;This movie is a great story that has the added positive advantage of being true.
179;They had to change some of the names, of towns and people, ect. but it is really great.
180;Hackman does a great job and works with a great cast.
181;A lot of the people behind the camera are Indiana folks or know the story really well.
182;It is such a great story that cannot happen any longer because Indiana changed the rules of championship play.
183;The cinematography is wonderful and everything is filmed on location.
184;This is a strong 5.
185;It is one of those stories true success!You don't have to be a sports enthusiasts to enjoy it.
186;Good history of what Basketball was, and still is, in Indiana!
187;Makesgood family movie nite, that leads to great conversation!
188;My husband loved this movie and especially the extra sceens.
189;He's a big high school basketball fan, and this was a great story.
190;He is a man with a past, although it is not as dark as it initially appears.
191;Hopper plays Shooter, the town drunk whose son is on the seven man team.
192;Despite his sodden brain, Shooter has a superb understanding of the game and Hackman selects him to be his assistant coach.
193;A wonderful and personal movie with Gene Hackman reminding us what he can do with a nice little script.
194;you see Hackman isnt acting at all.
195;Hackman is one of those rare gifted actors who can transmit and emotion with his face and no dialogue at all.
196;in this film Hackman produces a wide range of elements, Pathos, anger, resolve, patience et all.
197;For sure its a feel good movie in the last reel.
198;but how you get there is top drawer.
199;Now here is some of the best Gene Hackman acting ever performed.
200;What a challenge in this tale, what lovely small town turmoil and eventually ultimate victory.
201;I have personally experienced much of this story in my own life and find it touches my soul!Hoosiers
202;And once the team starts listening, they start winning.
203;an inspiring film about teamwork, optimism, and giving people a second chance, this is a movie the entire family will enjoy.
204;Its on par with Robert Redford's """"The Natural"""" and """"Rudy"""" with Sean Astin."""
205;I've actually met a couple of the players from that team, one of whom plays a referee in the final game of this film.
206;To me there is no better image in the entire film than that.
207;The message is that you can reach the unreachable.
208;Oh, yeah, and Gene Hackman and Dennis Hopper do a good job.
209;Thanks to those who do this.
210;Some scenes were very good, while others were grainy.
211;the movie itself was pretty good.
212;I love this movie and recommend everyone watch it at least once!
213;This movie is such a good story.
214;So good for about any person, but especially motivational for athletes.
215;As a basketball coach Norman Dale is spot on.
216;It is also one of the most enjoyable and heart warming films I've ever seen.
217;I feel odd reviewing this film.
218;The thing's been out forever and is well established as a classic.
219;So I'll just list some of my favorite parts.
220;It was a good idea.
221;Coach was still impressed with the size of the arena.
222;Decades ago kids who loved basketball and sports watched this on a continuous loop on cassette videos.
223;What makes this one of the most popular sports films of all time isn't just the sport, it's because it's such a human.
224;interest film, such a wonderful story of giving people second chances in life.
225;life David beat Goliath story and you have an appealing film.
226;He makes a very believable high school basketball coach who is tough.
227;the story of an extremely tiny school defying the odds and becoming a state champion in dramatic form was so inspiring that this film has played thousands of times for 20 years now by high school coaches to their kids for motivation.
228;but the key to the story is the coach getting a second chance in life to do what he loves and does best and he, in turn, giving others a second chance such as the alcoholic here played by Dennis Hopper.
229;By the way, the ACTUAL game that was played, which also is on this two.
230;an unsung hero of this movie is the cinematography.
231;Man, this is beautifully filmed and the rural Midwest has never looked so pretty and appealing.
232;Either way, it paints a beautiful picture of this part of the United States.
233;It also paints a fond remembrance of the early 1950s.
234;goodness feel of what it's like to be part of a basketball in this area during that time,Basketball meant an awful lot .
235;If you are sports fan in particularly, this movie will bring a tear or two to your eyes.
236;Not just a great sports movie.
237;It is a great drama.
238;Of course, Gene Hackman makes this movie, but he has a great supporting cast.
239;Worth viewing if you haven't seen it.
240;One of my all time favorites.
241;to me, Hoosiers is a beautiful, nostalgic and inspiring film.
242;Gene Hackman is utterly believable as the outsider who arrives to coach the team, at first shunned and ultimately accepted by the town, but as other reviews have pointed out, the greatest performance in the movie is that of Dennis Hopper as Shooter, the town drunk and former basketball hero, redeemed when given a chance by Coach Dale.
243;Great movie to show youth, showing how community is important in success.
244;Need more of these role models in our lives
245;I truly believe that this was one of Gene Hackman's best acting performances.
246;A great movie about people, leadership, and how we as humans do not like change.
247;a good movie for the heart.
248;the authenticity comes through in the characters, despite all the programmed searching for redemption built into almost everyone we meet: the attractive spinster, the town drunk living off booze and memories of glory days, the kids on the team, the town itself.
249;But it's Gene Hackman's new.
250;town basketball coach who comes across the most authentically.
251;"Brilliantly, the script sets all that up for this coup de grace: ""Gentlemen,"" Hackman finally says, ""It's been nice chatting with you all."
252;"Good night,"" and he walks out the door."
253;the basketball action itself will be of antiquarian interest to basketball fans.
254;The game burned into your imagination even more deeply as a result.
255;Great acting and an even better storyline told on the big screen.
256;Unbelievable, it keeps getting better each and every time I see it.
257;This is my favorite Gene Hackman film.
258;The musical score is one of the best of its generation .
259;wife, who has no interests in sports whatsoever, still asks to borrow the movie from time to time because the movie is that good.
260;town U. s. a. underdog story better than Hoosiers.
261;Gene Hackman played a great leader.
262;This is what I wanted, and what Amazon implies.
263;sided disc has both the standard 4:3 format, which is fine, but the 16:9 format is a rip.
264;I'm sure many of you have seen movies with both aspect ratios on a double.
265;sided disc and with the widescreen format properly filling all of a 16:9 screen, so it's not a technical issue.
266;There is also another idiosyncrasy.
267;This is a wonderful movie, and I used it for a historical movie about basketball and how things have changed over the years.
268;Our world can use a lot more of these family type movies .
269;Inspiring movie as it shows that you can succeed with a lot of hard work and dedication.
270;He really liked it and nothing inappropriate for his age as I can remember.
271;majestic shots of a car traveling the rural midwest on a crisp autumn morning.
272;hOOSIERS serves notice to the viewer that he or she is in for a wonderful movie experience.
273;Set in a tiny Indiana town half a century ago, HOOSIERS captures the look and feel of rural Americana, of a hardworking people with a single commonality: their love for basketball.
274;The pure innocence of this film, innocence long lost over the subsequent decades, is magical.
275;Yet Dennis Hopper gives the best performance as Wilbur Shooter Flatch.
276;"Shooter, a former great player himself and father of one of the boys on Coach Dale's team, is the town drunk
277;the feeling and depth that Hopper gives this role.
278;director David Anspaugh gives us a sensational feel good movie, augmented by Jerry Goldsmith's powerful musical score.
279;HOOSIERS tells a beautiful story, so magical in its depiction you'll be cheering from your chair.
280;It captures the flavor of my home state of Indiana, coupled with a story based on fact.
281;One of my all time favorite films, and the one that got me into LOVING Gene Hackman.
282;And excellent adventure of an ex College basketball coach filling in the shoes of a small town high school basketball coach.
283;With simply amazing acting from Hackman, who made this role into his own.
284;hackman carries the movie, with help from an excellent Supporting Cast.
285;Beautifully played by both actors.
286;i would recommend this movie to any Hackman fans, or basketball fans.
287;A touching film that doesn't dissapoint.
288;he loves the movie and yes he was a football player and now is a football coach.
289;it's a pleasure to watch hackman in anything and although this film was about 20 minutes too long, it was still a pleasure
290;Compelling story with a great cast.
291;The dialogue fits the characters, the times, and the local of the story.
292;If you want an uplifting story fit for the entire family, and you enjoy the game of basketball, then this is a film for you.
293;It has subtitles in French.
294;If ever a movie had potential for little vignettes it is this one!How about a little tribute to the real story that inspired it .
295;Hoosiers is a heartwarming, inspirational film based on the true story of an Indiana high school basketball team that made it all the way to the state finals.
296;headed, disciplined coach somewhat in the Bobby Knight mould.
297;Barbara Hershey is great as the schoolteacher who gives Hackman the cold shoulder, while secretly admiring him inside and falling for him in the end.
298;Jimmy Chitwood is superb as the laconic basketball prodigy.
299;Except there's a part in the movie where Barbara Hershey says something like, """"part of small town life is that folks' private affairs stay pretty much their own."""""""
300;"I think it's one of the best sports films of all time, along with ""Breaking Away,"" another Indiana film that was filmed at Indiana University in Bloomington, down south, and ""Rudy,"" about Notre Dame football."
301;"Hoosiers is a classically American tale
302;Heart warming and funny and serious.
303;I enjoyed this movie, but it appeared to show it's age.
304;On the same genre, I prefer """"Miracle"""" or """"Rudy""""."""
305;It's a GREAT story of kids growing up, when they were allowed to be kids, but still had their own struggles.
306;It's a nice family movie without everybody wanting to or killing each other.
307;The heart and soul of basketball is breed in Southern Indiana.
308;I think this has to be one of the best basketball movies ever made.
309;Hackman, Hershey and Hopper all turn in excellent performances.
310;It's so good that you find yourself rooting for coach and the Hoosiers to go all the way and win it all.
311;Watch this movie if you like underdog stories about reconciliation and overcoming adversity, combined with great acting and filmmaking.
312;Gene Hackman is always a good bet, but he's joined by Barbara Hershey and Dennis Hopper, who make a great cast.
313;The coach has to overcome the skepticism of the team's fans as he gets his squad to adopt a new style of play that is ultimately successful.
314;The cinematography is outstanding, with striking scenes of old gyms and of the Midwestern countryside.
315;Even though you know from the beginning how the story will end, the film manages to remain compelling throughout.
316;Hoosiers is beloved by basketball fans, maybe even a bit more so by those of us who played small.
317;It is justly acclaimed as one of the best sports movies ever.
318;This is a classic, you'll watch it time and again.
319;Hackman is excellent and the players are inspiring.
320;Needed the collector's edition of the greatest basketball film all time and one of the greatest movies ever made that everyone needs to see.
321;I think this is one of the best movies of all time.
322;i was extremely happy when it was released for Blu.
323;Being such an avid sports fan myself, I had heard a lot about the movie but had never had the chance to see it.
324;This movie is a top notch, five star rating in my book.
325;The main theme present throughout the movie is redemption.
326;Watching Coach Norman transform and establish himself in Hickory will inspire just about anyone.
327;the combination of all the cast members a part of the film is magnificent.
328;The two were a great team for this movie because they both grew up in the Midwest and understood the importance basketball had on small towns like this one.
329;It was nice as a viewer to see these actors come across as the real high school athletes that they are, rather than actors in Hollywood.
330;Hackman's performance brought a dynamic personality and important energy to the movie.
331;It is hard to imagine anyone else playing this role as Hackman delivered a performance that seemed to balance the competitiveness during the games and the sadness during the softer scenes perfectly.
332;This movie is a must watch to all!
333;One of Hackman's and Hooper's very best films and an underdog story at its finest.
334;Takes me away every time I watch it.
335;Whatever it may have lacked in amenities, it made up for it with a really intense environment.
336;I can state, without hesitation, that some of the most intense basketball games of my life took place in that little building.
337;It was a really wonderful movie.
338;They may have had only 67 boys in the high school, but they took their basketball seriously, as did the entire town.
339;It may have been small, but it was intense, that's for certain!
340;He felt the need to wipe the slate clean as far as the previous setup was concerned and do things he felt were correct.
341;From that humble beginning, he built the season into one in which they won their division state championship.
342;The story was exceptionally well put together.
343;The acting was superb, right across the board.
344;town Great Plains environment in the early 50s.
345;The movie totally captured the looks and feel of small.
346;Kudos to whoever put this thing together.
347;I'm surprised that the film didn't capture the Academy Award for Best Picture.
348;I guess it got a couple nominations, but, man, this was a really well done and intense movie.
349;"It's been 25 years since the movie ""Hoosiers"" came out and they still have yet to create a sports movie its equal, in this person's opinion."
350;Gene Hackman, Barbara Hershey and Dennis Hopper all turn in splendid performances.
351;The storyline plays out with the small school winning the state championship, seemingly against all odds.
352;time favorite sports movie and it's really not even close.
353;This is an inspiring and heart.
354;And yet, he is able to push his boys to the state tournament.
355;"Sheb Wooley is a ""good ole boy"" principal who is very encouraging toward his long."
356;This movie is one I've seen many times, and every time I have I've almost choked up at such a wonderful movie.
357;Best sports movie of all time.
358;I found myself standing and cheering for the Huskers.
359;good story line, plot and can be enjoyed by the whole family.
360;I don't even like the game.
361;Great performances, photography and a brilliantly emotionally charged score composed by Jerry Goldsmith contribute to the success of this film.
362;movie' and that is exactly what it is.
363;When the opening credits played I just knew this was going to be a great film.
364;Jerry Goldsmith's music behind the credits showing Gene Hackman traveling across the back roads of mid America is pure Americana.
365;And the final shot of the team photograph on the wall of the empty and silent gymnasium with Hackman's echoing words put a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye.
366;I suppose there is something endearing to me about our land and the chance for the seemingly unimportant individual to stand together with others against insurmountable odds and accomplish a noble feat or aspiration in one fleeting moment of glory.
367;That is the greatness to be found in the collective spirit of our nation.
368;Watch it and you may come away that much richer in spirit.
369;It was an excellent movie and I hope inspirational for our budding basketball player.
370;I'm a Hoosier by birth and I love this movie.
371;It is a story of a middle.
372;Gene Hackman does a great job as the coach with Dennis Hopper as a supporting actor.
373;highly recommended for any one who played high school basketball.
374;The acting is okay, and the music is good.
375;What is so exciting about a school winning a state championship?

377;create an exciting competative context in which human struggle and courage can be viewed.
378;The boys on this basketball team don't have many lines, but they really do become important to the viewer because we ache for their success so badly and when it comes, we feel the sweetness of human achievement.
379;correct message as part of the drama, which in my opinion makes it a more watchable movie.
380;In addition, the price is very reasonable!
381;I am feeling mighty sentimental today, just the right mood to be in when talking about HOOSIERS, my favorite basketball movie right up until WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP came along.
382;Gene Hackman has one of his most ferocious and best ever roles in the highly volatile former college basketball coach Normal Dale.
383;mad Hickory in 1951 and right away shifts the status quo with his ornery ways (some say, big city ways).
384;everything works with this movie, everything.
385;The story is warm and humorous.
386;The acting is marvelous from Hackman on down.
387;breathes life and even this mythical aura into Jimmy Chitwood, the boy with few words and the supremely sweet shot.
388;HOOSIERS is a shot of nostalgia, and because it evokes a more innocent era, it could get away with the sentimental stuff.
389;It's cliched now, but those shots of the town faithfully traveling on the road with the team, that was really good.
390;In the best tradition of classic feel.
391;good movies, you realize that your strings are being pulled.
392;One of the great all time classic feel good sports movies.
393;This film is a winner.
394;David Anspaugh made the best film of basket in all the story of the american cinema.
395;a script extremely simple but fullfilled with conviction, well written with unforgettable shots in the battle field.
396;gene Haxkman gives one of his most famous performances as the chief of the team.
397;Hershey as always makes the perfect balance for Hackman showing his inner interpretative force.
398;"It's a life lesson
399;if you think carefully , this film is very close in what its epic actitude concerns with Seabiscuit, that pearl of David Ross , nominated recently as best movie by the Academy.
400;I love this movie because: It's a true story + it has the underlying message that EVERYONE deserves a second chance to show who they truly are!
401;Pure entertainment and all about basketball in Indiana.
402;It's as good as everyone says .
403;interesting, well acted and written, and meaningful.
404;Let's be honest here, Hoosiers is the best basketball ever made.
405;It's the classic tale of a small team overcoming great odds to win it all.
406;What makes this story so compelling is that it's based upon a true story.
407;Filmed in a perfect representation of midwestern America, the blue.
408;The coach and team overcome great odds, Jimmy Chitwood helps to save coach Dale's job by swaying the town hall vote, Shooter (Dennis Hopper) is given a chance at redemption .
409;to himself, his family, and his town .
410;the team is embraced by the town, and Jimmy leads them to a state championship.
411;It's an incredible tale with great action, compelling characters, and a happy ending.
412;thanks a lot to the little guys who just could not stand the fact that the bigger schools won most of the time, but every now and then that one Hickory Huskers type team came along and pulled the upset, Cinderella story, etc.
413;This movie is simply the best.
414;The story, the soundtrack, the acting.
415;A must see for all sports movie fans, and fans of good movies in general!
416;Awesome illustration about the role of sports vs various other priorities.
417;Hoosiers is very solidly in my Top 10 movies list.
418;If you're a Hoosiers fan, the collector's edition is a must.
419;but as super as it was to see the deleted scenes for the first time, the """"Hoosiers History: The Truth Behind the Legend"""" may be the best feature of the collector's edition."""
420;It's a mesmerizing behind the scenes look at how the movie came to be, intermixed with the real story of the Milan, Indiana team winning the Indiana state basketball championship in 1954.
421;"There's a great discussion with David Anspaugh (director), Angelo Pizzo (writer), and Carter DeHaven (producer), with movie characters like Maris Valanis (""Jimmy Chitwood"") and the real people like Bobby Plump, who made the winning shot."
422;And you can see film footage of the actual winning shot in 1954.
423;It remains my favorite of all time.
424;It is a great lesson on hard work and focus, coupled with a second chance for someone.
425;I have seen this movie many, many times and I still cheer when Jimmy hits that last shot and the little school of Hickory wins the state title.
426;i see the price of the blu.
427;Hoosiers is, in my opinion, quite possibly the best sports.
428;Gene Hackman and Dennis Hopper give great performances as a coach down to his last chance and an alcoholic looking for something to turn his life around respectively.
429;What's amazing though is even if you do know how the movie's going to end, you can't help but get caught up in the magical trip of the basketball team from the small little high school of Hickory.
430;It's amazing how many coaches in all sports show this movie to their teams in order to get them pumped up for a big game.
431;I have been a huge fan of this move ever since it came out in the late 80s.
432;They were into it the whole time, laughing and cheering in all the right places .
433;it was a real treat to be able to share this gem with the next generation of aspiring athletes, and throughout our run to the finals, the players would mention a scene from the movie.
434;just an inspiring film that I would recommend to everyone that loves sports!
435;gene Hackman probably did his finest performance in this show as did Dennis Hopper.
436;a great basketball story that will just make you feel good.
437;i highly recommend this to everyone.
438;Was always curious about the team the film is about.
439;How wonderful an edition came out with the entire Championship Game in glorious black and white as well as tons of commentary and insight.
440;What a great movie this is.
441;Good Basketball, drama and ultimately triumph.
442;A movie that shows a team or character that beats the odds and comes out a winner is always great to see.
443;They do a great job.
444;That is nice to see as well, since I know alot of small farming communities do rely on the local church for their needs.
445;but all in all this is a great sports movie.
446;It would seem hard to believe that such a small school can become a champion in sports, but that is what makes it great!
447;anyways this is a HIGHLY recommended movie!
448;First, the movie is the best basketball movie ever.
449;The special feature documentary is great.
450;The deleted scenes are great.
451;AND the actual game the movie was based on is included with Bobby Plump hitting the game winner for the Milan Indians.
452;Love this movie, but I don't know why.
453;Hoosiers is destined to be a classic.
454;From the opening scenes of the beautiful Indiana countryside to the hollowed halls of Hinkle Fieldhouse at Butler University where the state finals were filmed, this movie is a winner!
455;state game in the Jasper gym) and i must say it was a treat watching Mr. Anspaugh, Hackman, Hershey, the ballplayers and entire cast perform.
456;The film has fantastic music, beautiful color and a wonderful cast.
457;Deeply felt, tense and exciting on and off.
458;court, this movie benefits from yet another bravura Hackman performance, as a man who must confront his demons and marshal his strengths to redeem himself.
459;Another standout is Dennis Hopper in an Oscar.
460;nominated turn as Shooter, a former player who loves the game, but who's also the town drunk, until Norman jolts him back to help the team.
461;great movie for the whole family (though best for older children).
462;this is your classic David vs. Goliath tale based on a true story that's at the core of Indiana basketball mythology .
463;the magic year back in the early 1950s (can't remember the exact season) in which tiny Milan (pronounced MILE.
464;These are my people and my places and the filmmakers got it exactly right.
465;as far as the characters go, Hackman did a credible job, but the real star of this film is Dennis Hopper.
466;The stereo imaging really makes the picture come alive.
467;oh well, it beats watching the NBA.
468;One of the greatest sports movies of all time.
469;My 7 year old son loved it!
470;A true classic for one and all.
471;Gene Hackman is superb and the scenery is amazing.
472;This is simply a well made movie that is a classic in my book
473;Jimmy is the best player that people have seen in years.
474;Eventually the team starts to get it, but the town has had it with his approach.
475;Just as you think the door is closing, things turn around and Dale gets to continue to lead his team with the best player and finally, the full contingent of players he needs.
476;the story has a lot of elements to it, persistence, a clear desire of everyone to be a winner, difference of opinion on how to get there, compassion and even a little love story to broaden the appeal of the movie.
477;Gene Hackman is, as always, spot on with his role as Coach Dale!
478;Would highly recommend this and I would say it's pretty safe for families as well.
479;Some mature themes including alcohol abuse but definitely presented and dealt with well in the film.
480;This movie is a great sports movie, hands down.
481;But importantly, it also demonstrates solid character throughout.
482;no matter what, he helped the people that needed to be helped.
483;It brings to life the humanities and shows how important sports is philosophically and societally.
484;I was raised in Anderson, IN and believe me when I tell you that this movie accurately captures the mania of small town ball that still exists.
485;It is a great American film about the quintessential American myth.
486;While there is precious little historical evidence that the little guy rarely ever really wins in this nation in the real world, we would all like to believe that it is true.
487;Team play, selflessness, generosity and courage will carry the day.
488;A team of American kids wins Olympic Gold in Hockey while going up against the imperious Russian team along the way.
489;A team of misfits stumble into a Superbowl win.
490;A small town school can rise up and become the greatest power in Basketball in a Basketball crazed state such as Indiana.
491;While the facts, the characters, the years and the reasons are all changed to protect the integrity of the Myth being told, the results are true.
492;And when this movie finishes taking you on it's wonderful ride, you will be glad you watched this little gem.
493;The film has a wonderful and nostalgic take on American small town life.
494;This overall affection that the film makers have for their characters and the locale of the movie is then combined with an achingly beautiful color pallette, a real ear for the dialogue of the place and time, and a cast of America's finest actors and actresses.
495;I believe that you will watch and treasure this movie many times over in the coming years, and you will never feel ashamed to admit that it is one of your favorite cinema pleasures.
496;Beyond the triumph of this small town Indiana team are the personal triumphs of the characters.
497;The setting has a comfortable feel to it.
498;That comfort that we all perceive existed in the 1950's.
499;What a great old movie.
500;Characters with character, lots of life lessons, a study in motivation, and it has you on your feet cheering.
501;I'm not a sports fan and this is a basketball movie, but it was excellent non the less.
502;Really happy with teh movie and enjoyed watching it with my 8yr old son last night.
503;So happy to find it on Amazon.
504;Touching story, great movie based on a true story about a basketball team.
505;Great motivational movie that you will enjoy.
506;Dennis Hopper brings all his skills to this supporting role as the town drunk.
507;Great work!There are so many wonderful reviews I really have little more to add.
508;The sports and basketball are just the metaphors.
509;Hoosiers gives it all back to us in one improbable, albeit true, story.
510;Gets me every time, and keeps me to the end.
511;is realistic and on point.
512;"Many fans will still follow the team bus (usually also followed by a ""fan bus"" or two filled with students so they have easy access to the game and can go along with their friends) and many of the gyms are ""cracker boxes"" as they are known with walls or bleachers leaving barely enough room for a big."
513;But these gyms are real Hoosier gyms: they are hot, tight, and filled to the rafters with plenty of fans standing on the floor left open at the ends of each bleacher section to see as much of the game as one can from these obstructed.
514;As a fan however you made as much noise as you could regardless of whether it ended up hurting or helping your team.
515;but this film captures more than the feel of those long.
516;past years: it captures the human complexities of many characters and does not just present cardboard Hollywood cutouts of characters we've seen time and time again .
517;especially of the head coach, Norman Dale (as always perfectly brought to silver.
518;on perfect job), who we find out through the course of the movie is a former, national championship.
519;winning collegiate coach who was banned from college and from at least one state from coaching after punching one of his own players during a game.
520;The player was the best player he ever had, willfull, hard.
521;You can see his heart breaking as he talks about it as Hackman brings so much power and honesty to the role which, a born.
522;"Hopper portrays ""Shooter"", a local basketball hero from many years past and now the town drunk whose son also plays on the team."
523;Shooter succeeds and the buildup from the character who is struck to silence by the situation initially to seeing he can do it and confidently calling the final play to win the game.
524;It is quite a wonderful scene and is a real high.
525;Yes, Hopper certainly deserved the many nominations he received for his work in the film.
526;The casting for the film was so well done and the recreation of 1950s Indiana on film is dead.
527;piece films of any period do as capable a job as this one in recapturing and presenting the past in an accurate manner.
528;This is one of Hackman's finest films in a long, long line of excellent roles.
529;He is truly one of the finest American actors ever produced and unfortunately is equally ignored by the Academy or its poorer cousin, the Golden Globes.
530;Hackman always brings such depth to his roles and his skill as an actor in finding the key parts of a character are not surpassed by any other actor in my humble opinion.
531;bred Hoosiers out there who might be relocated somewhere, this is a fine film that will bring many emotions to the surface as you travel along with the little Hickory team as they try and win the finest title in all of sports (imho lol).
532;A love story of basketball from back in the day when Gene Hackman was voted People Magazine's sexiest man alive.
533;executed, it's a lot of fun.
534;Hoosiers moves along at a pretty good clip, and has the rousing finish you came for.
535;But overall, this is a fun movie to watch.
536;This is truly an inspirational film that you should watch before participating in a sports event.
537;Overall this movie is perfect.
538;As most boys who grew up in Indiana, this Cinderella tale was a familiar one to me .
539;last year, in preparation of attending the NCAA Women's Final Four in Indianapolis with my 11.

545;this is a rare film in that it somehow captures that special time, that place, that joy.
546;a beautiful moment in time captured in a truly beautiful film.
547;ray transfer is just awful for such a great film.
548;A movie I almost wish I loved less.
549;And the bottom line is it is very effective and affecting film.
550;gene Hackman and Dennis Hopper are great, and the film is full of lots of nice touches of time, place, and character.
551;intentioned schmaltz really, really works.
552;One of my favorite movies .
553;My honey loved this movie an when he goes on the truck for 2 weeks he would watch it so many times thank you great delivery :.)
554;Finally, I looked it up and watched and it is a very good movies.
555;Gene Hackman is wonderful and the story is inspiring.
556;It will transport you to a simpler time in life.
557;as a high school teacher, its amazing how much norman dale impacts me every day.
558;I gave this as a gift and they loved it!Highly recommend this product if you're looking for a great movie.
559;Hoosiers is a wonderful movie about a old basketball coach who applies for a coaching job at Hickory Indiana High School.
560;supposedly one of the best basketball players that ever played in Indiana.
561;The coach leads the team to the state championship.
562;which they do successfully win.
563;He is finally accepted by the people of Hickory as a wonderful basketball coach.
564;My husband, having both played and coached basketball, enjoys watching this movie now as much as he did when it was first released.
565;Gene Hackman is a gifted actor and does a wonderful job at portraying a coach.
566;I love hoop films, so I jumped at the opportunity to watch this one, having heard that it is a great film.
567;this is a superlative film, beautifully directed by David Anspaugh, about a great basketball coach whose initial coaching career was derailed by his Achilles heel.
568;It is a story about the effect that one can have on the lives of others.
569;It is a story about hope.
570;It is a story about community.
571;It is a story about overcoming all odds.
572;He wants to make it a team of which all can be proud.
573;His hardline approach meets some initial resistance that causes his best player to leave the team, but even he eventually returns to the fold.
574;Cooler heads prevail, and he is given his chance to be all he can be.
575;While what he does with the team is remarkable, it is his interaction with others in the town that is even more so.
576;Along the way, Coach Dale even manages to give the town a basketball team of which it can be proud.
577;He and the team put the town on the map.
578;Dennis Hopper gives a truly remarkable performance as the drunk who finds his way out of the bottle long enough to take stock of himself.
579;respect and repair his relationship with his son, he responds in a way he had never thought possible.
580;Hopper gives a performance of a lifetime, infusing his character with just the right amount of pathos, vulnerability, and hope.
581;His is truly a bravura performance.
582;Barbara Hershey, as always, gives an excellent performance, impressing upon the viewer the internal conflicts with which her character is struggling.
583;The rest of the supporting cast contribute with fine performances, as well.
584;this is a great film on many levels and one that is well worth having in one's personal collection.
585;terrific sports type true stories for the whole family to enjoy.
586;Just good wholesome family kind of movies that are inspirational.
587;This is an awesome movie that we watched with our family.
588;Timeless classic every kid should watch!
589;But it was worth it because Hoosiers is a really good film.
590;Gene Hackman is the new coach in town.
591;at first the men in the town all hate Hackman, but as the team starts to win, he wins them over.
592;"this is a ""feel good"" film."
593;I enjoyed the film and thought the performances were great.
594;school style makes a change from some of the other modern sports films going around, and it's definitely worth a Sunday afternoon viewing.
595;There's no amazing sports filming in this movie, but as I said the plot is decent and it is family friendly.
596;If you love stories about underdogs, you'll love this one too!To be fair, I'm from Indiana and Indiana basketball is what you grow up with, but the story is a great one for young and old alike!
597;Gotta love this one if you're a Hoosier or any other basketball fan.
598;He loves these small, but well.
599;crafted films that speak to the best in the human spirit ( and basketball!)
600;, so it was a perfect match.
601;This is an uplifting movie based on a true story of how a small Indiana town developed a winning basketball team to become State Champions in 1954.
602;the theme is somewhat blase but the movie brings out the best in people and has that feeling of authenticity.
603;He shows grit and tenacity as the town is suspicious of outsiders, especially older ones seeking a new chance.
604;as coach he is bold and tenacious showing leadership and fairness.
605;I found all the games exciting.
606;the characters show human sides, and the story is motivating.
607;Hoosiers is a timeless, classic movie.
608;I loved it when it first premiered, now my 10 year old loves it too.
609;This is a classic sports movie with a great moral for people of all ages.
610;hackman and Hershey are grand as the coach and teacher who opposes him.
611;He wins the team, the town, and the teacher.
612;from the opening scene where a 1950's car(can't remember the make) comes at dawn on empty roads to the sleepy town of Hickory to the closing moment when a small boy is seen shooting baskets in an old gym and we hear Hackman say, I love you guys I was captivated.
613;It's 1951 and the boys are coming out to warm up.
614;My heart skips a beat.
615;A classic in any home and especially with a 7'2 grandson 'into' basketballand playing in college now.
616;Great story and appropriate for families.

622;Gene Hackman is terrific in this movie, and it is a great show for today's youth.
623;America is such an awesome place to live.
624;One of the great things about America is the American Dream.
625;Hoosiers is a masterpiece tale of an American Dream.
626;They went all the way from that little home town to win the state championship in one of the greatest basketball states in the union.
627;This is there awesome tail in one of the most powerful movies you will ever see.
628;gene Hackman is great as Coach Dale.
629;Hackman is one of the greatest living actors.
630;He's a powerful presence on screen.
631;This is one of the greatest roles he ever played and I really thought he should have been Oscar nominated for it.
632;dennis Hopper is great as the town drunk.
633;He was one of my favorite characters in the movie.
634;all the guys who played boys on the team were great.
635;I liked the guy who played Jimmy a lot.
636;He's believable as the country boy sharpshooter and he helps make the movie.
637;I have the VHS of Hoosiers and on the cover you see him on the shoulders of his teammates with his hands in the air.
638;I also like the kid who played Hoopers son in the film.
639;He does a good job with his character.
640;hoosiers is a powerful film.
641;It's a great cast and the basketball is great in the film.
642;It's one of the best movies you will ever see and this is a film that everybody should see.
643;I cried in the movie.
644;It's that good and I'm not afraid to admit that.
645;The David vs. Goliath underdog storyline really works.
646;This is a great film.
647;Normally I don't like sports movies because I don't like sports in general, but this is actually a pretty good movie, even for non.
648;sports fans, thanks to its story and acting.
649;This is a good basketball movie and if you are a basketball fan, you definitely should see it.
650;Also, it is a good movie to show teams.
651;It shows team unity and the results that can happen when you trust your team and coach.
652;Even if you are not a basketball fan and just like good movies, this is a good movie to watch.
653;HOOSIERS is one of the best sports movies made.
654;Gene Hackman delivers a solid, understated performance as the coach who uses strict disciplinary measures to whip his small team into shape, and try and win over the interfering townsfolk as well.
655;The vastly underappreciated Barbara Hershey shines as the schoolmarm who doesn't have a great love for basketball, but who finds herself in the coach's corner.
656;Dennis Hopper, in one of his best roles, deservedly received an Oscar nomination for supporting actor in his portrait of a former coach who is now the alcoholic father of one of Hackman's players.
657;"Hopper is brilliant in capturing the anguish and the insecurity as Hackman's ""assistant."""
658;A cast of unknown youths are marvelous as the players and it is our empathy and compassion for these boys that makes HOOSIERS such a winning film.
659;A fine score by Jerry Goldsmith adds more kudos for this remarkably entertaining film.
660;Fantastic story, great acting, multidimensional.
661;But I did love the hoops.
662;Excellent acting, especially by the main characters, but also by the supporting actors.
663;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
664;I have seen this movie several times and enjoy it more each time.
665;Indiana basketball is the greatest, and all stories about it are always exciting.
666;I couldn't remember the name of this film, just that I had seen it along time ago and had loved it.
667;When I finally remembered what it was called I was happy to find that I could watch it on Amazon.
668;This is a terrific film, inspiring in many ways and the acting stands the test of time.
669;Maybe there will be a director's cut on day with more authentic.
670;good basketball movies of all time.
671;It is perfect for a night with the kids at home.
672;Thanks to Amazon, I was able to watch a digital of the movie last night.
673;I curled up with a sandwich and snarled when the town turned against Coach and then laughed and cheered when the boys won game after game.

682;I very much enjoyed the movie.
683;He showed how to retain his self respect and helped another person gain a self worth attitude.
684;of course Gene Hackman is such a pro that most of his movied I have seen have been great.
685;Very pleased with this supplier.
686;The movie came in before the scheduled time and in great condition.
687;I wanted to give this as a Valentine's gift.
688;Thanks to the vendor, I was able to give someone a very special day.
689;One of the best movies ever and the casting was excellent.
690;Great story and a real tribute to Indiana basketball.
691;This is such an inspirational and heart felt film!
692;It is a great sports movie, but so much more.
693;The 2 disc set is very nice with an excellent transfer and interesting extras.
694;The winning shot in the movie was based on Bobby Plump's last second shot to win the 1954 Indiana State Basketball Championship.
695;some elements of the film do match closely with those of Milan's real story.
696;Both Hickory and Milan won the state finals by two points: Hickory won 42.40, and Milan won 32.30.

706;I really liked the fact this was filmed in my home state of Indiana.
707;This is a wonderful classic movie.
708;They dont make movies like this anymore It is exciting with a feel good ending.
709;See all my reviewsGREAT SPORTS MOVIE!
710;Retro Phoebe is enthralled during opening scenes as she witnesses first one, then many classic automobiles cruising Indiana backroads.
711;The action is set in the early 1950s and sets and costuming are very good and authentic.
712;Norm builds up a sense of pride in them and cooperation.
713;Shooter is a basketball expert and father of one of the team members.
714;"Norm encourages him to clean himself up and be his ""right hand man."""
715;Dennis Hopper plays this role in one of his most brilliant performances on screen.
716;Somehow they are able to make it to state.
717;This reviewer is taking note of the tenseness of her own body, the tightening of muscles as she views the scenes of exciting basketball.
718;This is a wonderful movie about perserverance and the role of NORM is played to perfection by Mr. Hackman.
719;In the end we see how Norm has such a kind heart not only for his team members but in helping the town see the error of their ways in judging others, including Shooter.
720;A marvelous movie, I might say.
721;Hoosiers is a great, feel good movie that champions the fact that if you work hard and believe in yourself, anything is possible.
722;He is a mysterious stranger, with a dark past.
723;But he knows how to coach basketball and he gets the boys to believe in themselves.
724;Dennis Hopper scored a major comeback triumph in his career (he got a Best Supporting Actor nomination for the role) as the alcoholic assistant coach who is also the father of one of the boys on the team.
725;The movie is full of cliches, but the kids and Mr. Hackman are so good, you can forgive them for it.
726;The speech that Mr. Hackman gives before the big game will send chills up your spine everytime you hear it.
727;Hoosiers is a real winner.
728;I have always liked this movie.
729;She loved it as much as I do.
730;Will watch again some day.

736;This is the greatest uplifting movie and the music is wonderful.
737;see and Gene Hackman is probably my favorite actor.
738;This was a great movie and one that we can all learn from.
739;Like the good old days as portrayed in this story.
740;Good old fashion movie about basketball and what it means.
741;Watch a Indiana team find it's spark and carry out some great team play.
742;It is great to see the little guy win!
743;No cussing, no violence, nothing over the top yet a great movie.
744;A true story beautifully acted.
745;It took me right back to the 1950's Midwest where basketball is more than a game.
746;A chance to David to conquer Goliath.
747;Hoosiers is an excellent movie based, as they say, on a true story.
748;Someone got the excellent idea to make a movie about it and decided to take the time and do it right.
749;Doing it right meant getting an outstanding screenplay, excellent direction, terrific acting, as well as top.
750;That's good because even the person who saw the movie without hearing how it turned out could probably guess that we weren't going through all of this just to see our team lose at the buzzer.
751;The thrill of victory is there but it is balanced with an appealing sense of comaradarie that assures us that this team would have lost with class had that been its' fate.
752;The one in a million long shot is exciting but it's only this exciting because the odds really are for real.
753;Hoosiers lets us feel the joy a whole state felt some 50 years ago.
754;muncie state championship game was priceless.
755;The interviews added to the enjoyment of the movie.
756;A great movie with Hackman in particular playing a great part where despite the odds, the good guy wins.
757;Suitable for any age, with special meaning for basketball fans.
758;Some good action shots, but the story (based on fact) is what really gets you.
759;Hoosiers could be the greatest sports movie ever that's not named Raging Bull.
760;Hackman does a great job selling Norman Dale as the disgraced college coach who moves to the middle of nowhere to escape his past.
761;His coaching techniques and the basketball styles of the players are period appropriate and the ending, though predicatble, is still immensely enjoyable.
762;The charactors are all so loveable.
763;I recommend that anyone watch this movie.
764;Bought this for my summer basketball camp last year and all the kids loved it.
765;The movie accurately captures the intensity and community involvement and excitement that was small town Indiana basketball.
766;One interesting aspect is that one of the referees in the game was actually Ray Craft who was a leading member of the Milan team and later an IHSAA executive.
767;If you enjoy a feel.
768;good sports story showing the game in its purest form you will love it.
769;Classic of classic sports stories with human interest galore!
770;The streaming on Amazon movies was great.
771;This is exactly what I was looking for and this item is something that fulfills my needs for what I want.
772;It was okay, the classic sports story where triumph is born from desperation.

774;In reel life: The team that wins the championship is Hickory High.
775;In real life: The team that won the championship is Milan High.
776;In reel life: Hickory wins the title in 1952.

780;"Yes, this is a ""feel good"" film among several (e. g. Rudy on which Anspaugh and Pizzo also collaborated later) which have been immensely popular."
781;"FYI, here are a few brief passages from the official Web site of Milan, Indiana:""Milan, Indiana, a quiet rural town in the southeastern part of the state, was the scene of one of the greatest basketball stories in history."
782;the rise of the 1954 Milan basketball team actually started the preceding year.
783;The core of the 1953 team also returned.
784;Although their accomplishments seem to have grown to almost mythical proportions as the story of the greatest underdog in sports' history throughout the years, there was a real team who lived a dream that came to life.
785;Both the film's story and the Milan team's season affirm the same values which now seem so rare 50 years after Bobby Gene Plump's winning shot.
786;This is a great movie for anyone who loves Basketball.
787;Great lessons for life in this book.
788;good story about high school basketball and their coach with a background story.
789;It is purely coincidental that the backdrop for this movie happens to be high school basketball or sports of any kind: This is a genuinely great movie, leaving the audience feeling good about themselves and willing to search for a second chance at success in life, no matter how great the failure.
790;with the movie on video, you now have a second chance to watch and enjoy this great movie!
791;It is worth the redemption price!
792;Hoosiers is not just my favorite sports movie, it is my favorite movie of all time.
793;The best part is, we do.
794;Those who succeeded in Hoosiers accepted their second chance and made something of it.
795;If you are interested in seeing a story that shows what the small schools can do with the hard work and a goal in mind then you should view this film.
796;I found it to be a great lesson in that money and size do not mean great success.
797;This is the best sprots that I have ever seen.
798;The movie makers were very smart to use actual basketball players .
799;the athletic action was superb.
800;This movie is the greatest heart warming piece of Americana I have ever seen!I highly recommend this movie for the family!
801;The speech at the end is the best part.
802;this movie is for basketball lovers.
803;I do not know much about basketball but this is a very good family movie which shows that second chances, team work and self.
804;discipline are essential in order to win.
805;It is a real classic with a good story for all ages.
806;This film captures life in small town America during the 1950's and the excitement of Hoosier Hysteria !
807;The fact that this is based on a true story makes it even more special!
808;It's my favorite sports film of all time!
809;I loved the movie and in Blu.
810;ray is even more intense.
811;Great extras mirrored with an awesome picture!Very nice!
812;Great all around story and acting.
813;I watch it a couple times a year.
814;It's a simple but unforgettable movie with a great musical score, fine acting, and a perfect ending.
815;If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it.
816;He loves to watch Hoosiers and I also like it.
817;Love this movie and could watch it all day.
818;As a basketball coach, I really enjoy the promise of the little guy winning a state championship.
819;I think that she most certainly is an important part of the plot.
820;i think that this film was very tastefully made, with a good, somewhat appropriately stylized approach to the subject matter.
821;All professional athletes and coaches should have to watch this movie.
822;It is about the triumph of a team that works together exhaustively to achieve an unachieveable goal.
823;Gene Hackman soars in his most likeable role.
824;Barbara Hershey is quietly effective as the coach's love interest and the whole cast functions as a complete unit, much like the team does.
825;And more than that it is about second chances.
826;Shooter (Hopper) gets a second chance with his son when he quits drinking, and the town gets a second chance at glory through the success of its basketball team.
827;Themes are classic and remain timely.
828;Excellent acting, well scripted, endures for all generations.
829;After many viewings the film retains a sense of wonder.
830;That is a rare thing.
831;"one of my favorite sports films
832;I remember going to the theatre when it first came out and falling in love with it.
833;I think it's strength is that the townsfolk do not like the new coach and I understood why, and yet he did his job to the best of his ability.
834;3 and 3/4 stars rounded up to 4.
835;This movie makes me proud to be a Hoosier!!!
836;This movie is fun to watch cause it's fun to recognize some of the schools that they played.
837;This movie shows the rest of the country and the world just how CRAZY we are about basketball.
838;going to the games was so much fun.
839;One year, the girls won the sectional and we cancelled the last two periods of class to have a dance and watch the game in the cafeteria.
840;i recommend it to anyone!!!
841;Simply one of the best sports films out there, hands down.
842;If you're a fan of sports films, this is a must see.
843;Great movie for the price.
844;My kids watched it and loved the movie.
845;Hoosiers is a warm, affecting film that follows the genre of many sports movies: a losing team, a new coach, personality clashes, a darkest hour, and the gallant pursuit of triumph.
846;Hoosiers is distinguished, however, by it's is acute attention to detail and superb character development.
847;The strong, silent coach shows compassion when he enlists the help of Dennis Hopper as Shooter, the alcoholic father of a team member.
848;The coach involves the man with his son, his team, and the community in a noble effort to encourage him to seek treatment for his addiction.
849;Hoosiers is a powerful film that leaves a catch in the throat and a glow in the heart.
850;Fine acting and fine script.
851;OK So maybe you know how this film is gonna pan out but so what It's BRILL The acting is solid ,believable, and understated (Hopper walking on the court sober ,suited and nervous is both funny and touching ,especial in the reaction from his son)But what moves the film up a gear is the soundtrack to the basketball games .
852;A Must See if you are a sports fan (or not !)
853;Just a good humble story about an unlikely team who gets to do the impossible through hard work, second chances and social challenges that come from introducing change that is hard for the society of the time (early 1950's) to accept.
854;I love rooting for the underdog.
855;Hoosiers is one of the best films every made, sports, drama, love story or whatever genre you want to categorize it under.
856;It's about father and sons, mothers and daughters, second chances in life, overcoming adversity, forgiveness and a team who comes together to achieve the ultimate goal of winning a state championship.
857;Gene Hackman is incredible as Coach Norman Dale and Dennis Hopper is genius as shooter.
858;I don't know who won the best supporting actor award in 1986 but it must have been one of the all time great performances to beat out Dennis Hopper in his role as the town drunk and basketball guru.
859;The scene in the locker room prior to the State Championship is unforgettable and inspirational.
860;I have seen this movie many times and I still enjoy it like I was watching the film for the first time.
861;In fact every time I watch this film, I take something new from it that I can apply and use in everyday life.
862;The score is second to none and from the opening scene of Coach Dale driving through the farmland of Indiana the music grabs hold of you and sets the tone for the rest of the film.
863;I would recommend this film to all people and not just basketball fans.
864;while combating his own team (initially) and the townsfolks (initially) he lays down the law, my way or the highway and builds the team into an outstanding group of players and young men.
865;gene Hackman shines as the new coach and Dennis Hopper does a great job as the formally drunken assistant coach.
866;The movie is about reaching your dreams, about having morals, a strong constitution, working together, personal transitions, family, friends and community.
867;it's an outstanding movie that should be required viewing for everyone, even if you don't like basketball or sports.
868;Since it is a period movie, the cinematographers did an excellent job of preserving the atmosphere of that era.
869;I remember well the convoys we used to have going to various basketball games and the camradarie that went with it.
870;The bigger the game, the longer the convoy.
871;They captured that well in the movie.
872;other than the nostalgic feelings I get from the movie, I think they did an excellent job of choosing the cast.
873;The cast did a very believable job.
874;I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes David and Goliath type movies and period movies.
875;I love the flavor of Indiana more than anything.
876;Being deaf helps with these things!
877;We played them every year, and believe it or not the movie is very accurate in portraying the town life and Indiana's love of basketball.
878;One of the few movies that I can watch year after year.
879;they loved it and were inspired.
880;You can take all the glitz and glamour that you want.
881;When you are done watching this film, you will remember Gene Hackman's amazing performance, playing every bit the coach, you will remember the stirring story of a father restoring a relationship with an estranged son, but so much more than that, you will remember the heartstrings that this film seems to pluck at whenever it chooses.
882;If you haven't, pick it up right now.
883;You will find that once you have see it and own it, Hoosiers will become one of the most often played movies in your collection.
884;You've probably heard this movie name dropped when best sports movies all.
885;I'm here to reinforce that statement!
886;Gene Hackman is in rare form as the outcasted basketball coach who is given a second chance to coach a small town basketball team in the middle of hoops.
887;town fans who sell out the gym not only at home, but on the road!
888;The scenes of rich farmland with hoops nailed to each and every barn add flavor to the background.
889;The movie shows that fundamentals and discipline are the keys to success.
890;The small town story resembles that of Larry Bird's rise to fame as a Boston Celtic, and this is a movie you will want to watch many more times.
891;I remembered this movie so well from my childhood and looked forward to watching it with my 11 year old son.
892;He enjoyed it very much, but perhaps not as much as me.
893;The acting is amazing, the basketball footage is great and the soundtrack is spot on!
894;This is a magical film from the start.
895;Gene Hackman was the best fit for the role as the coach.
896;He likes discipline and is honest and knows how to show people how to do things.
897;The movie has some of the most dramatic shots and the games that the Hoosiers played were exciting.
898;He does this so the drunk assistant can try to win the game by himself.
899;What a great idea for a scene in the movie.
900;That was a huge shot.
901;Being a fan of basketball and playing it I really got inspiration from it.
902;Very entertaining movie, but the special features including the real story upon which the movie was based would not play.
903;One of Gene Hackman's best performances ever bad that is saying something.
904;One of the most inspirational movies out there not just in sports but in life.
905;This is just a wonderful film, whether you're a fan of basketball or not.
906;If you like the game and know its history, you'll love this movie even more.
907;The movie is still as uplifting as ever and Gene Hackman's performance is, as always, amazing.
908;Even though I've heard a few fellow Hoosiers gripe about the film not being more true to the actual facts, to me, it's one of the top three or four movies I've ever seen, and captures perfectly the atmosphere of our state, circa 1950s.
909;The screenplay captures the Hoosier way of talking well, too.
910;the kids who portray the Huskers are the best basketball players I've ever seen acting in a movie.
911;They've actually """"played the game"""" before ."""
912;It fits the theme so well .
913;"As the camera shows the photo of the state championship Huskers, Dale can be heard repeating what he said in the locker room before the big game: ""I love you guys."
914;Gets you excited about basketball.
915;I bought this for my wife as a gift.
916;She has been a fan of this since she was a kid.
917;She loved the extras the 2nd disc has on it.
918;star movie to a two.
919;star story that's enhanced some by the wonderful old gyms .
920;Then you add a star for the great soundtrack.
921;Still, being a classic it does have its moments and thus the okay rating.
922;All I can say is, thank goodness it was made when it was!
923;Again, thank goodness this movie was made when it was, which allows it to be watched as the timeless classic that it is.
