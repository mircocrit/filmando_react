I:9836;1;Marty Felman is The Best!
I:9836;2;It is possibly the greatest film parody ever made and pays beautiful homage to the original Frankenstein movies, filmed in black and white and using the equipment from the original movie.
I:9836;3;The word 'funny' barely describes how err 'funny?'
I:9836;4;Each line perfectly placed and timed to a level of perfection rarely seen in a comedies these days.
I:9836;5;Then a few years later, after some beers on the town with some friends, I saw it again over a Bank Holiday weekend, in fact we laughed through it 3 times.
I:9836;6;Their interactions appear to speak of years of close comedic practice, but it's really the material, direction and acting that gives this seamless impression, and that's not to belittle the excellent interactions of the cast as a whole.
I:9836;7;many prefer the excellent Blazing Saddles (also a top fav), but for me it has to be Young Frankenstein.
I:9836;8;I remember seeing this movie advertised at a drive in movie theater when I was a kid.
I:9836;9;funny how family priorities can shift.
I:9836;10;this is a gloriously affectionate swipe at the classic Universal horrors of the 30's(it even uses some original lab equipment.)
I:9836;11;Gene Wilder is on top form as the eponymous baron.
I:9836;12;the whole cast is a joy in fact,with everyone giving their all in a movie they so obviously enjoyed making.
I:9836;13;My dad has always been a big movie fan, so I had a lot of exposure starting at a young age.
I:9836;14;Without any special effects or action at all really, this movie is so rawly funny that it can keep anyone laughing the whole time.
I:9836;15;If you are looking for a solid movie that will keep all ages laughing through the whole movie, look no further.
I:9836;16;This is withoutadoubt (one word) one of the funniest movies you could watch.
I:9836;17;The movie itself is only partially old, but its black and white filming gives a great classic feeling.
I:9836;18;Well, I suppose my point is that this movie is a class A comedy, that even the pickiest of people love.
I:9836;19;The dude is a stone!
I:9836;20;Watch it for liquid rendering laughs.
I:9836;21;Very funny and original gags.
I:9836;22;Great Cast to watch in action.
I:9836;23;Best Director Mel Brooks for making this picture.
I:9836;24;Great price, great condition, great movie.
I:9836;25;It's a pretty silly movie for a middle aged guy, but when I was young I thought young frankenstein was pretty great!
I:9836;26;i viewed this film for the first time this past weekend after purchasing it.
I:9836;27;if this is any example of Mel Brook's greatest comical acheivement then his brand of humor is assinine at best.
I:9836;28;Loved how it arrived just in time to give it as a Valentine's gift to my boyfriend who has been talking about it for months.
I:9836;29;Really, really good and funny movie.
I:9836;30;Excellent story, actors, director and is in black and white.
I:9836;31;Writer\Director Mel Brooks created what many feel is one of the funniest movies ever made.
I:9836;32;Gene Wilder and himself wrote a screenplay that is filled with many memeorable lines that to this day still remain funny.
I:9836;33;That's the sign of any good movie, whether it's a comedy or drama.
I:9836;34;If, after 20 or 25 years a movie can still make you laugh and still seem fresh, it truly is a classic.
I:9836;35;It really goes to show one what kind of comedy genius Mel Brooks is!
I:9836;36;This is a movie everyone can watch and have a smile put on their face and almost die of laughter.
I:9836;37;It's a perfect movie to start your collection of Brooks films with and also a perfect example on what a comedy is suppose to be like.
I:9836;38;Released in 1974, Young Frankenstein is irrefutably one of the funniest movies ever made.
I:9836;39;Devotees are quick to recreate favorite scenes and certain lines from the film have insinuated themselves into popular culture.
I:9836;40;viewed in this context, Young Frankenstein is one of those incredibly rare examples of a project where everything goes right.
I:9836;41;The best place to begin is with the chemistry between Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder.
I:9836;42;Wilder, a far more refined and nuanced artist, is his perfect foil, they balance each other ideally.
I:9836;43;Next is the supporting cast.
I:9836;44;Great comic actors are less common than hen's teeth, but Brooks managed to assemble a veritable Who's Who.
I:9836;45;Teri Garr, in addition to bringing sex to the picture, has superb comic timing.
I:9836;46;Madeline Kahn is as gifted a comedienne as you might ever find, and her flamboyance is irresistible.
I:9836;47;Marty Feldman is more than just another pretty face with a moving hump, he delivers.
I:9836;48;rise to the occasion and become funny by virtue of their context.
I:9836;49;By making the film an homage to the great monster pictures of early Hollywood, (note the decision to shoot in black and white), Brooks and Wilder created something that is more than just a broad farce, at times it is actually touching.
I:9836;50;This is as good a comedy script as you are likely to find anywhere, one.
I:9836;51;top dialogue, Young Frankenstein is practicality a masters class in comic acting .
I:9836;52;these performers are obviously enjoying themselves.
I:9836;53;As much as I love this movie, I'm going to have to give this Blu.
I:9836;54;Before you jump to the conclusion that I'm clueless on the issue, let me tell you I'm well acquainted with the fact that grain is a feature of the medium itself, and that Blu.
I:9836;55;ray will reveal more of this grain than what we're used to.
I:9836;56;image feature similar to that found in common photo software was applied.
I:9836;57;Take note that among the reviews here, mine is the first one written after having actually seen THIS edition.
I:9836;58;In my oppinion, this is one of Mel Brooks best movies and one of the best comedies EVER!
I:9836;59;This movie is a great one from childhood for me.
I:9836;60;Frankenstein classic, but with silly humor.
I:9836;61;Great one to add to the collection.
I:9836;62;Outtakes, Mexican interviews(gene, Marty, and Cloris), trailers, loads of photos, TV spots, but best of all, is Mel's commentary!
I:9836;63;This is without a doubt an American comedy classic.
I:9836;64;This movie is full of memorable scenes that will just make you laugh every time you think about them.
I:9836;65;Also, the cast for this movie is excellent.
I:9836;66;I highly recommend this film to everyone
I:9836;67;The cast couldn't be better, and it's a classic that should be in everyone's must see movie lists.
I:9836;68;There are so many good scenes and quotable lines from this movie.
I:9836;69;It's got an amazing cast and iconic director.
I:9836;70;Just watch it and you'll understand.
I:9836;71;ray, but I got with it anyway.
I:9836;72;It works, and has no nice extras.
I:9836;73;This is one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen.
I:9836;74;Mel Brooks did a great job!
I:9836;75;This is one of those rare comedies that holds up to multiple viewings.
I:9836;76;This is the best Gene Wilder Film.
I:9836;77;Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder coproducing is the recipe for a great time.
I:9836;78;Quite honestly one of the greatest comedies ever filmed, `Young Frankenstein' is a marvel of cinema and a treasure for every film library.
I:9836;79;"The film sports some hilarious performances, iconic at that, not to mention a tightly woven script with jokes that actually land
I:9836;80;It's rare for me to find a comedy that covers every base.
I:9836;81;As much as I enjoy a good comedy I often refer to dramatic films when speaking of `the best of film' but I would be a liar if I said that `Young Frankenstein' isn't one of the greatest `movies' ever made, let alone comedies.
I:9836;82;gene Wilder was one hilarious actor.
I:9836;83;He truly shines here, it's no wonder he considered this his favorite of all the films he made.
I:9836;84;His performance is comedic genius.
I:9836;85;The way he always manages to steal the limelight in the scene, becoming the focal point of our attention due to his marvelous comedic timing.
I:9836;86;"Teri Garr is also right on point and effortlessly captivating, but she can't hold a candle to Cloris Leachman or Madeline Kahn who are both uproarious here
I:9836;87;He makes him human, yes, but more importantly he makes him funny.
I:9836;88;That whole `Puttin on the Ritz' scene (arguably the best scene in the film) is precisely the reason why this film is a `must see.
I:9836;89;mel Brooks was known for his comedies, many of which are considered classics and are adored by many.
I:9836;90;In my humble opinion, this is his finest film.
I:9836;91;It gets everything right, and that is a rare treat indeed.
I:9836;92;there are plenty of spoofs out there today, films that take something classic and tear it to shreds in an effort to elicit some laughs.
I:9836;93;`Young Frankenstein' is the film that they should all aspire to be because it is the one film that actually manages to deliver a unique and memorable experience without tarnishing the good name of the original.
I:9836;94;Yes, `Young Frankenstein' draws all of its humor from cracking fun at Mary Shelley's classic, but this film manages to become its own film, separate from its inspiration and thus earning its very own place in our hearts.
I:9836;95;This is right at the top of that very short list.
I:9836;96;I've been wanting to add this one to my funny movie collection and am satisfied with it.
I:9836;97;YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is a superb comedy, a masterpiece of motion picture parody and the very best work of all involved.
I:9836;98;the zany cowboy spoof, BLAZING SADDLES is Mel Brooks' and Gene Wilder's other comedic masterpiece.
I:9836;99;"Gene Wilder/Peter Boyle/Marty Feldman/Cloris Leachman/Teri Garr/Kenneth Mars/Madeline Kahn/Gene Hackman""YOUNG FRANK"" TRIVIA:This is Gene Wilder's personal favorite."
I:9836;100;the skulls found under the castle were real.
I:9836;101;Great clean movie, not that there isn't adult humor, it's just above most kids' heads.
I:9836;102;Just watched this again for the umpteenth time and found myself still laughing at a classic comedy with some of the most memorable lines in any comedy.
I:9836;103;It's been over 30 years and this gem is as good as when it was released.
I:9836;104;One of those rare lightning.
I:9836;105;strikes wherein everything worked wonderfully and the casting created a perfect ensemble.
I:9836;106;Hands down the best movie parody Mel Brooks ever made as well as the best looking and most completely consistent in design as well as style.
I:9836;107;"Abbie Normal""He vas my BOYFRIEND!"
I:9836;108;You take the blonde, I'll take the one in the turban.
I:9836;109;O sweet mystery of life at last I've found you!
I:9836;110;Cloris Leachman simply perfect in a small but indelible role.
I:9836;111;Ken Mars' Inspector is a personal favorite of mine (I have loved his thick German accent since The Producers, and he and Mel get in some jokes here about how some viewers of that film couldn't always understand what his Franz Liebkin was saying).
I:9836;112;That is the nature of comedy.
I:9836;113;Well that is true here as well, but it is one of the most consistently funny films from beginning to end you'll ever see.
I:9836;114;Their return policy is the best.
I:9836;115;Shipped fast, description of item was perfect, everything wrapped and new.
I:9836;116;And its a great movie too :) Thank you!
I:9836;117;Young Frankenstein is Mel Brooks' funniest film, and one of the ten best comedies of all time.
I:9836;118;With an hysterical script and brilliant cast, every scene is laugh.
I:9836;119;loud funny as cast and crew send.
I:9836;120;my teenage daughters saw this for the first time a few nights ago and they found it every bit as funny as we did around 40 years ago.
I:9836;121;Mel Brooks is a genius.
I:9836;122;Perfect story, perfect cast, what more can I say.
I:9836;123;Mel Brooks has worked on a lot of films.
I:9836;124;He has many films that are in many people's top comedy list but Young Frankenstein is not only a great comedy film but a great film.
I:9836;125;You know a film is great when people use it as a standard.
I:9836;126;there is a funny story to how I saw this film for the first time.
I:9836;127;He said, its a really good horror film.
I:9836;128;And good lord what a film!
I:9836;129;rays it has a wonderful picture.
I:9836;130;anyway, enough of my gushing, enjoy!
I:9836;131;Great acting in a great horror movie spoof.
I:9836;132;Early appearance of Gene Hackman and great performances by Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman and of course Gene Wilder.
I:9836;133;This was a great movie.
I:9836;134;so I'll just keep to the basics.
I:9836;135;But 'Young Frankenstein' is by far, his best.
I:9836;136;to tell you the truth, I think Marty Feldman is the heart of the movie!
I:9836;137;The film is shot in black and white, and it has a good score.
I:9836;138;It's packed with special features, like a nice long 'the making of' featurette, outtakes, and deleted scenes.
I:9836;139;I am very happy and look forward to shopping on Amazon.
I:9836;140;the actors, the sets, the dialogue .
I:9836;141;He would never again reach these great comedic heights ever again in his career.
I:9836;142;This movie, although released in the mid 70's, is filmed in great black and white.
I:9836;143;It was a great touch that added the mystique of the film.
I:9836;144;The cast and performances are inspiring.
I:9836;145;A young Teri Garr is mighty catching in her finely tuned comedic performance.
I:9836;146;She is one of our finer female comedians.
I:9836;147;A great actor who gives a knee slapping performance as the monster.
I:9836;148;"The dance sequence to the song ""Putting On The Ritz"" still makes me laugh just thinking about it."
I:9836;149;Each one is a winner.
I:9836;150;I am sure that Mel Brooks played the major role in directing this movie, helping to secure from the actors the very best performances, as well as adding certain more crude enhancements to the script.
I:9836;151;it is Wilder's contribution, as an actor, that also makes this movie: his superb facial expressions, his ironic, exaggerated, sarcastic performace is the essence of the movie's denial.
I:9836;152;(On the other hand, if Brooks is responsible for those fantastic close.
I:9836;153;"There are many who love Blazing Saddles
I:9836;154;When the parody of a classic becomes a classic itself you know it has to be good.
I:9836;155;"To truly appreciate all of the setups one should really see the original ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein"" starring Boris Karloff."
I:9836;156;Gene Wilder and Madlin Con are the best.
I:9836;157;ray release is amazing, over 1 hour of special features plus the movieall on 1 blu.
I:9836;158;Young Frankenstein is miles ahead of all but one of Brooks's films.
I:9836;159;It's absolutely hilarious even if its not the superlative, Blazing Saddles.
I:9836;160;Feldman is the creator of quite a few laughs and I had no idea that Terri Garr was that attractive when she was younger.
I:9836;161;Kahn is a riot and Boyle does fine work.
I:9836;162;Brooks gives the narrative some cute little twists such as transpires with the little girl by the well.
I:9836;163;Without giving anything away, let me say that the ending is excellent and tough to predict.
I:9836;164;ray version has many extras that will keep you entertained for hours.
I:9836;165;this is proof that some life changing movies need to be in Black and white.
I:9836;166;The son of a famous dabbler in the mysteries of life gets intrigued in the craft himself finding it necessary to exchange attributes with his creation.
I:9836;167;Funny, funny, funny and clever.
I:9836;168;Also better understands the meaning of sweet mystery of life .
I:9836;169;This was always a favorite of my hubbys and now he frequently plays it for laughs.
I:9836;170;our son has it als on his iphone: thanks
I:9836;171;The movie itself is absolutely amazing if you're into the Mel Brooks kind of movies.
I:9836;172;Awesome movie, if you're a comdey fan you'll love this movie.
I:9836;173;Movie has always had a great resolution since it was filmed in B and W but the sharp image from Blu.
I:9836;174;The lines are classic and you are hammered with one joke on top of the other.
I:9836;175;This is Marty Feldman's best role which steals away your attention of the story several times.
I:9836;176;The chemistry of the actors is so like situation comedy but strong.
I:9836;177;"If you like this you will love ""Blazing Saddles"" also by Mel Brooks."
I:9836;178;The best spoof of an old monster movie I've ever seen.
I:9836;179;If there were to be a whole new genre created around spoofs of monster films this should be the model.
I:9836;180;He has high production values e. g.
I:9836;181;Mr. Brooks will spend good sums of money on the props, sets, and talent.
I:9836;182;he will be remembered as one the best comedy directors in history.
I:9836;183;The movie of course was outstanding.
I:9836;184;"but the added Extras and Specials and Additions really made it ""come alive!"""
I:9836;185;The Special Edition is DEFINITELY worth it!Oh.
I:9836;186;Mel Brooks at his nuttiest best.
I:9836;187;Gene Wilder is the best Baron F yet!!
I:9836;188;Gene Hackman is great too.
I:9836;189;Well worth checking out if you have never seen it or if you need to remind yourself of it.
I:9836;190;Has been a favorite since I first saw it.
I:9836;191;This is very very funny movie.
I:9836;192;It was written by Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks and shot in black and white which works VERY well.
I:9836;193;Yes, it's in black and white.
I:9836;194;It is a spoof on the original movies but it may just be Mel Brooks best work.
I:9836;195;Brooks (and Gene Wilder) rewrote the monster tragedy and turned it into a comic triumph.
I:9836;196;One of my favorite movies of all time!
I:9836;197;Zaney, irreverant, laugh out loud humor.
I:9836;198;they're followed by a spot light!)
I:9836;199;I love it when Marty Feldman bursts into song.
I:9836;200;it's timeless and a hell of a lot better than what Hollywood is putting out these days!
I:9836;201;When I saw Young Frankenstein for the first time, I laughed so hard through the movie that I forgot to eat my popcorn.
I:9836;202;My grandson, age 9, just got hooked too.
I:9836;203;I either enjoy it or I don't.
I:9836;204;marty Feldman is hilarious, there is some corny humor, to be sure, but it's highly enjoyable.
I:9836;205;This is one of our favorite movies.
I:9836;206;As stated in the description, there are the extra scenes, bloopers,production photo, and more.
I:9836;207;If you're a fan of the movie, go for it.
I:9836;208;This movie is the FUNNIEST spoof of all time!
I:9836;209;Get it, you'll love it.
I:9836;210;We need more good comedy that is clever and witty.
I:9836;211;Covert Affairs is well written, there is a storyline and it is engaging, well done!
I:9836;212;why can't fox put out a decent copy of this movie.
I:9836;213;This is probably Mel Brook's finest work, though some might vote for Blazing Saddles or the Producers.
I:9836;214;In a tribute to the old horror movies of yore, Brooks puts together the perfect cast to carry it out.
I:9836;215;The great thing about the cast is the fact that they all are in total flow with the movie and with each other.
I:9836;216;This is still one of the movies that sets the standard for comedy.
I:9836;217;subtle humor makes this a movie to watch over and over again.
I:9836;218;This is one of the best movies ever made.
I:9836;219;if you like Mel, you willl love this one.
I:9836;220;I absolutely loved this movie.
I:9836;221;He was perfect for the witty lab assistant who has a hump that changes sides.
I:9836;222;Gene Wilder was also a very fresh, yet believable, Frankenstein and has been able to carry on the great tradition of Frankenstein and of spoofs.
I:9836;223;I watched this movie primarily for the humor, but now I also have a much greater appreciation for the Frankenstein movies as well.
I:9836;224;This is probably Mel Brooks' best movie of all time.
I:9836;225;Mel Brooks proves that a comedy can be sweet without losing any of the humour in the process.
I:9836;226;ray, and I have to say that the transfer is about as good as this film will ever look.
I:9836;227;Be thankful you are getting a very nice anamorphic transfer after all these years.
I:9836;228;The sound is good, but not great, and the new stuff is great.
I:9836;229;A great spoof on movies about Mary Shelley's novel, Frankenstein.
I:9836;230;This is one of the best movies to watch.
I:9836;231;And at Halloween it is particularly appropriate.
I:9836;232;Any fan of older classic horror movies will find this all the more funny.
I:9836;233;A great spoof of several horror movies but especially the classic Frankenstein movies.
I:9836;234;The sets, sound, music, and lighting do a fantastic job of recreating the brooding black and white images of the original.
I:9836;235;Mel Brooks does a great job of keeping this three ring circus of comedians on the focus of the movie.
I:9836;236;mel Brooks fans will defintely love it.
I:9836;237;The fact that the movie is black and white was done on purpose and actually adds to the illusion of being like the original.
I:9836;238;The price is a bargain and this is one of Mel Brooks greatest works.
I:9836;239;His commentary, accessed through language, not extras, is illuminating.
I:9836;240;The making of documentary is great as well.
I:9836;241;In The Bride of Frankenstein, the most touching scene is the one where the blind hermit befriends the Monster.
I:9836;242;Anyone who finds this scene touching will crack their sides at the scene in this movie where Peter Boyle's monster has the misfortune to encounter Gene Hackman's soup spilling, cigar.
I:9836;243;The atmosphere of the original is lovingly recreated and the charcters and script also reveal an extremely detailed knowledge.
I:9836;244;gene Wilder is perfect as the manic Doctor, Peter Boyle impressive as the monster, but perhaps the two funniest performances are by Marty Feldmann, whose physiognomy perfectly combines horror and comedy, and Kenneth Mars as the heel.
I:9836;245;i recommend watching the original Frankenstein movies before this, as this will greatly enhance your enjoyment.
I:9836;246;Will enjoy it for many more years.
I:9836;247;This is one of many comedies from the hilarious mind of Mel Brooks.
I:9836;248;I always loved this movie and thought it made the perfect gift (especially at this time of year) for a movie.
I:9836;249;What makes this movie a classic is that, 35 years later, people can still recall the most hilarious moments and lines in the movie, even if they haven't viewed it in years.
I:9836;250;A real strength is that something funny is going on in almost every frame of the movie, even if it is just something visible or going on the background.
I:9836;251;I know I've seen it well over one and a half dozen times, would never NEED to watch it again, yet put it on once a year or so just for the heck of it, or to view it with a friend who's never seen it before!
I:9836;252;It always makes me laugh (often before the joke happens)!
I:9836;253;Thank goodness they did cut those scenes, though!
I:9836;254;This film is on every top.
I:9836;255;The acting, the pacing, the cinematography are all flawless.
I:9836;256;This movie is a work of comic perfection.
I:9836;257;The scene with Peter Boyle and the old blind guy (Gene Hackman) is the best!
I:9836;258;Terrifically funny as I remember it.
I:9836;259;Mel Brooks at his comedic best!
I:9836;260;A brilliant cast in a wonderfully funny movie.
I:9836;261;This movie is such a classic spoof on horror flicks!
I:9836;262;Each brings their own outrageous twist to their characters.
I:9836;263;Great movie overall, but poor conversion.
I:9836;264;Although it's always a matter of opinion, I will come out and say that I think Young Frankenstein is the best film in the Mel Brooks film library.
I:9836;265;With a perfect cast, crisp jokes, and spot.
I:9836;266;on directing, it's a complete package that mixes satire and fresh humor.
I:9836;267;"Helping him out is Igor (pronounced ""eye."
I:9836;268;The first half of the film is familiar territory, largely following along the lines of the original film.
I:9836;269;When the monster shwos up, though, things get really good.
I:9836;270;while the rest of the cast is excellent, Peter Boyle's performance as the monster really shines.
I:9836;271;The film gains its own identity once he shows up, culminating in a terrific and classic bit where Dr. Frankenstein demonstrates the monster's ability to learn through a musical number.
I:9836;272;Explaining how these bizarre events turn out would be a disservice to the film, but rest assured that it is hilarious from start to finish.
I:9836;273;overall, Young Frankenstein is a terrific movie, whether you're a fan of satire or just straight comedy.
I:9836;274;The cast is terrific in their performances, the humor is side.
I:9836;275;splitting even today, and it stands as one of Mel Brooks's finest achievements.
I:9836;276;I have loved this show forever and never see it on TV.
I:9836;277;I had just seen Young Frankenstein the play performed at a famous local playhouse.
I:9836;278;Great movie, but i think i preferred the play better.
I:9836;279;Still a classic movie with the paring of Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks.
I:9836;280;And his commentary was amazing, though a little sad, as so many amazing people in this movie have passed.
I:9836;281;the movie, parodying all the Universal Frankenstein films but mostly Bride and Son of Frankenstein, is one of the funniest horror parodies ever made.
I:9836;282;Gene Wilder is wonderful as Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (or Frahnk.
I:9836;283;This is probably Mel Brooks best movie.
I:9836;284;Full of wonderful actors and acting this is a classic.
I:9836;285;this movie is absolutely hysiterical and have watched it over the years several times.
I:9836;286;always puts me in a great mood :)
I:9836;287;After reading the wonderful reviews for this movie and having seen such brilliant Brooks' spoofs as SPACEBALLS, BLAZING SADDLES, and HISTORY OF THE WORLD, I was expecting to be laughing almost constantly.
I:9836;288;the acting, though, was brilliant.
I:9836;289;The interaction between these three main characters were what made the movie entertaining.
I:9836;290;The supporting cast was brilliant, too.
I:9836;291;I got the impression, though, that these were the characters that provided a lot of the jokes that seemed to be missing.
I:9836;292;on another note, I thought the use of black and white film was very effective in setting the mood and getting the viewer into the right frame of mind.
I:9836;293;Young Frankenstein is, by far, my favorite comedy.
I:9836;294;If you like a good comedy and want a good laugh , this is the picture to see.
I:9836;295;Looked good, movie content is hilarious.
I:9836;296;Blu ray looked good, it's a little scary seeing Gene Wilder in black and white close up with that kind of clarity on my 51 inch plasma.
I:9836;297;I've seen this movie before and it didn't look like that so they did a good job.
I:9836;298;Some people say it's not real wide screen but I was happy enough with it.
I:9836;299;This is an absolutely mind.
I:9836;300;blowing, hilarious piece of work.
I:9836;301;Gene Wilder is excellent as the young Dr. Frankenstein.
I:9836;302;I likedeveryone else, and Peter Boyle (who is Frank on Everybody Loves Raymond) was very funny.
I:9836;303;Teri Garr was good, especially when we first see her 'rolling in the hay.'
I:9836;304;I received the movie in 3 days without asking for any special delivery schedule.
I:9836;305;This is the picture that I remember her best for!
I:9836;306;While kids can watch this it's really an adult movie!
I:9836;307;but it is freaking funny!
I:9836;308;My friends and i all love to watch it!
I:9836;309;I laugh every time I see this movie.
I:9836;310;WARNING: This film may lead to incontinence due to hysterical laughter!Mel Brooks' 1974 film, Young Frankenstein is arguably the funniest film ever made.
I:9836;311;This film is a superbly crafted parody of theUniversal Frankensteinfilms.
I:9836;312;the story begins with young Doctor Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced Fronkensteen) discovering that he has inherited his great.
I:9836;313;the gags in the film are hilarious (I won't ruin them for any of you yet to see the film).
I:9836;314;The satire is heightened by the brilliance of the set design, and by the black and white cinematography, which perfectly captures the look of classic horror films.
I:9836;315;"as often as Young Frankenstein is referred to as being ""the greatest comedy ever"", it's odd that it never received any awards for its talented cast and crew."
I:9836;316;There are few works of comedic genius out there today, for which I am grateful to Mel Brooks for giving us this loony masterpiece to watch again and again.
I:9836;317;One of Brooks' three best films (with The Producers and Blazing Saddles), this one is best seen having done a little research.
I:9836;318;five years later, this film still provides a ton of laughs.
I:9836;319;It's always great fun to watch.
I:9836;320;it's always good to see the late Marty Feldman, too.
I:9836;321;His face was hysterical and perfect for this film.
I:9836;322;In fact, he, along with the camera.
I:9836;323;work, really make this film one to watch and enjoy multiple times.
I:9836;324;Add in the great talents of Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Gene Hackman, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, etc., and you have a memorable movie with a lot of memorable scenes.
I:9836;325;Kudos, also, for Mel Brooks having the good sense to film this in black.
I:9836;326;"It may have been his best film, although ""Blazing Saddles"" would give it a run for its money."
I:9836;327;"Still, this has to be considered one of the best ""comedy classics"" ever."
I:9836;328;Young Frankenstein is certainly a classic film, and I feel somewhat bad about giving it only 3 stars.
I:9836;329;especially Igor, but also the monster and others.
I:9836;330;homage (almost equal parts each) of the various Golden.
I:9836;331;"Young Dr. Frankenstein (""It's pronounced Fronk."
I:9836;332;"He arrives in Transylvania and finds Igor (""It's pronounced Eye."
I:9836;333;He resolves to build his own monster to prove that with a good brain it would give a good monster.
I:9836;334;This does lead to the two greatest set.
I:9836;335;loud funny even on repeated viewings, and it all depends on the performance of Peter Boyle as the monster.
I:9836;336;In fact, Boyle's and Teri Garr's (as the ditzy lab assistant) performances are the best in the film.
I:9836;337;Mel Brook's audio commentary is surprisingly interesting and informative.
I:9836;338;It's especially good to hear him admit his mistakes (he wanted to cut the 'Putting on the Ritz' scene) and other inside information.
I:9836;339;The audio and video are very crisp and clean, probably better than the original run film prints!
I:9836;340;This film is just so terrific, a true classic.
I:9836;341;up provide one of the best kind of films you'd get during the 70s.
I:9836;342;If you enjoy comedy, then you shall undoubtfully enjoy Young Frankenstein, fellows.
I:9836;343;An instant classic that needed to be upgraded.
I:9836;344;It brings back great memories of my father.
I:9836;345;loved this movie each time we watched it.
I:9836;346;great memories with a great classic comedy
I:9836;347;This film is one of my all.
I:9836;348;time favorite Mel Brooks movies.
I:9836;349;It has been called one of the ten funniest movies ever made, and I am not about to argue that.
I:9836;350;Everything about this film works.
I:9836;351;One thing in the film's favor: the decision to film in glorious black and white, as in the glory days of Hollywood horror films, which this movie paid direct homage to.
I:9836;352;The cast was spot on, and you could only imagine the crack.
I:9836;353;Peter Boyle was wonderful as the Monster, and Gene Wilder was a true genius as Fiedrich Frankenstein.
I:9836;354;Teri Garr, in an early appearance, is great as Inga, the lab assisant.
I:9836;355;Marty Feldman lends his maniacal eyes to Igor, giving a rousing performance in the process.
I:9836;356;"She will forever be remembered for her rendition of ""Love at Last I've Found You""."
I:9836;357;Overall, one can tell this film was a true labor of love.
I:9836;358;The contrast is wonderful, the sound is sharp, and the film just glows.
I:9836;359;If Mel Brooks rather crude humor isn't your forte, this film is closer to mainstream than normal for him.
I:9836;360;As a result, he gave us a true cinema classic, and we thank him for it.
I:9836;361;The widescreen edition, although set at only 1.85, is a big improvement over the laserdisc or tape.
I:9836;362;This is simply the best Mel Brooks film.
I:9836;363;"This is a film with so many classic comedy scenes, you'll be committing the lines to memory and singing ""Sweet Mystery of Life"" the next time you are fully satisfied by a relationship (just try not to laugh in your partners face)."
I:9836;364;This film is definitely one of the greatest comedies of all time!It is basically a parody of the Frankenstein movies of the 1930's and 40's as well as the monster movie genre in general.
I:9836;365;The jokes are extremely funny and the movie is full of so many classic scenes and lines that I couldn't mention all of them in this review.
I:9836;366;Peter Boyle portrays the monster and is very funny.
I:9836;367;the film also features Madeline Kahn in her traditional Mel Brooks appearance as Fredrick's girlfriend Elizabeth.
I:9836;368;Gene Hackman also has a small cameo role.
I:9836;369;as for bonus features, the most interesting ones are a making.
I:9836;370;overall, this is a timeless comedy classic that I very highly recommend.
I:9836;371;The fabulous Saturday Night Live crew do it again!
I:9836;372;I recommend this movie to everyone who loves Mel Brooks unique sense of humor.
I:9836;373;released version also includes some great scenes that were cut from the original version as well as a few bloopers.
I:9836;374;My whole family loves this show!
I:9836;375;One of the funniest movies ever made.
I:9836;376;Hard to believe it's been 40 or so years since it was released.
I:9836;377;Unlike most comedies, Young Frankenstein gets better and better with age.
I:9836;378;The cast, crew, sets, score .
I:9836;379;This is a must have for anyone's library!
I:9836;380;There are lines in this movie that you know by heart!
I:9836;381;Mel Brooks, being the comic genious that he is, really outdoes himself on this gem.
I:9836;382;It's quirky, silly, and laugh.
I:9836;383;There's an art to making a film that has what you know is obvious humor coming, and it's still slap.your.
I:9836;384;"Funny, oh so funny, oh and one more thing: ""PUT ze candool BACK!"""
I:9836;385;Some great lines in this classic comedy film.
I:9836;386;This movie is so funny if you never see it you will be missing out on so much.
I:9836;387;It is also a great price.
I:9836;388;Another great flick for the collection on hand.
I:9836;389;This is a classic mel brooks movie and the extras on the blu.
I:9836;390;ray are worth the cost.
I:9836;391;Great movie and great cast!
I:9836;392;It came on time and play's great.
I:9836;393;this may just be the funniest movie of all time.
I:9836;394;This movie is a classic and I am pleased that I could add it to my collection.
I:9836;395;I will watch it 100 times again.
I:9836;396;YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.
I:9836;397;"Suffice it to say that this film, spawned from a real love of the ""Frankenstein"" films of the 1930s, manages to satirize the originals with perfect grace, all the while creating a movie that is strangely touching in its own right."
I:9836;398;the film itself is gorgeous.
I:9836;399;"It was a great decision to do so, too: the black and white film lends the movie a ""haunted"" feel that transports the audience back to the shadows and gloom of the 1930s originals."
I:9836;400;As strange as it sounds, particularly when compared to modern parodies, this film manages to tell a touching story.
I:9836;401;There is a real human element to this film, despite all of its (hilarious) off.
I:9836;402;I particularly enjoyed watching the documentary of how this wonderful film came to the big screen.
I:9836;403;It was obviously a labor of love and it shows.
I:9836;404;if you enjoy Mel Brooks's films, the original Frankenstein films, or simply a great and timeless comedy, you honestly cannot go wrong with YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.
I:9836;405;It holds up after thirty years and will continue to do so for many to come.
I:9836;406;This is the funniest old movie that has ever been made, as far as I'm concerned.
I:9836;407;Seeing the media's reaction to his invention and seeing the Dr. interact with Frankenstein is as funny as anything you'll see.
I:9836;408;The idea of this movie is nothing shy of brilliant as well as everything else about it.
I:9836;409;This is by far one of the best movies of all time.
I:9836;410;It has great film work, and is hilarious!
I:9836;411;Unfortunatley the young doctor is up against a brilliant foe.
I:9836;412;Frederick leaves his lovely fiance Elizabeth, played by the marvelous Madeline Kahn, to inherit his grandfather's estate.
I:9836;413;There he meets interesting charecters, Inga, his laboratory assitant, Igor his faithful servant, and Frau Blujer.
I:9836;414;Watch the movie and you will fall in love with each of these charecters.Young Frankenstein was one of the early movies for a host of brilliant actors.
I:9836;415;i thought that this movie was funny when i frist saw it when i was about 18 teen and it still is love it
I:9836;416;This is Mel Brooks at his equal best with Blazing Saddles and proves his reputation as one of the all.
I:9836;417;Gene Wilder is perfect as the young Frankenstein and is surrounded by a super cast that helps bring this (and the monster) to life.
I:9836;418;My daughter (age=12) loves this movie.
I:9836;419;I (age=50) love this movie.
I:9836;420;Mel Brooks is a terrific director.
I:9836;421;This is a movie to watch again and again to see the homages paid to other great flicks.
I:9836;422;The I'll take the one in the turban is pure Marx Brothers.
I:9836;423;"Many of these omitted scenes had hysterical moments, including the end of Dr. Frankenstein's message in the ""reading of the will"" scene."
I:9836;424;Some of the material in the Mexican interviews is very good as well, particularly the Marty Feldman interview.
I:9836;425;surely, and the best cast.
I:9836;426;Of the various film parodies that director Mel Brooks concocted this ranks at the very top.
I:9836;427;He's got all of the elements in place: a terrific cast, great black.
I:9836;428;white photography, great production values.
I:9836;429;The film is chock full of great set pieces and double entendres(when I first saw this as a child I didn't get most of them).
I:9836;430;The ensemble cast is one of the best ever assembled for a comedy.
I:9836;431;Teri Garr is voluptuous and funny as his assistant Inga.
I:9836;432;Peter Boyle is monstrously funny as the Monster.
I:9836;433;"If you want to demonstrate to a younger viewer that a film can be funny and a little naughty and not smutty then you can show them ""Young Frankenstein""."
I:9836;434;Mel Brooks is awesome he is a comic genius.
I:9836;435;this movie was funny and i love that they kept thetraditional black in white for respect of the old Frankenstein movies.
I:9836;436;it worked for the movie and did it justice.
I:9836;437;A relative of the original Dr. Frankenstein becomes heir to his ancestor's work in this hilarious spoof of the classic horror film.
I:9836;438;The cast is excellent and the choice to shoot in black and white was inspired.
I:9836;439;Ah, but Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks, like Dr. Frankenstein, have deftly grafted inspired lunacy to a touching and solid story and given their creation life.
I:9836;440;Wordplay, slapstick, innuedno, sight gags and cinema's most memorable musical scene combine in a hilarious brew.
I:9836;441;Yet it is the original core, the story of the deformed oucast and the creator who ultimately redeem each other, that keeps it all from simply being vaudeville.
I:9836;442;Peter and Gene are fabulous at being silly and sincere simultaneously.
I:9836;443;The trailers and production stills are nice, standard fare.
I:9836;444;The making of documentary interviews several of the key figures and does a good job of exposing what exactly it took to make the film.
I:9836;445;It was really neat to hear not only what Mel had in mind for the various scenes, but his unabashed adulation at the creative talent he had to work with.
I:9836;446;He even talks about the fellow who plays Inspector Kemp's chauffeur!All in all, a wonderful movie with a good helping of juicy extras.
I:9836;447;From the opening camera pan, to the singing at the end, all in the glorious black and white that lets you fill in your own color, this is a wonderful movie.
I:9836;448;"want to know where ""Walk this Way!"""
I:9836;449;included in the stellar cast are the bug.
I:9836;450;booted local constable, and last.
I:9836;451;It was pretty funny when, during a town meeting, one of the citizens mentions that they have gone through this sort of thing nine times before.
I:9836;452;Talk about shell shock!Other great scenes include Abby Normal, Elizabeth's 'violation' (her woof is a hoot), the vaudeville dancing, and the dungeon dialogue between Wilder and Boyle.
I:9836;453;one of the funniest comedies ever to grace the silver screen.
I:9836;454;So many funny lines in this Mel Brooks spoof, I laugh every timea watch this classic.
I:9836;455;This is one of Mel Brook's best.
I:9836;456;A great cast and is a staple in our household for Halloween.
I:9836;457;It can be watched many times and still make you laugh.
I:9836;458;The audio and video are wonderfully restored.
I:9836;459;The audio commentary and making of documentary are excellent.
I:9836;460;And the outtakes are fun, albeit few.
I:9836;461;If you want a good campy and funny film when you have some down time then here you go!
I:9836;462;I just love Gene Hackman in one of his few comedic roles as the blindman.
I:9836;463;I think this is a really good comedy movie.
I:9836;464;The extra features are a hoot though.
I:9836;465;I recived the movie the next day.
I:9836;466;The movie and service was great, I was so impressed with the service that I ordered 2 more movies for friends.
I:9836;467;Hands down, one of the best movies ever made.
I:9836;468;Mel Brooks is truly a gifted man when it comes to great ideas for spoofs.
I:9836;469;This movie is an all time classic.
I:9836;470;I love comedies, they are my favorite genre.
I:9836;471;This is one of my favorites along with Blazing Saddles.
I:9836;472;My husband and I will often randomly quote from these movies.
I:9836;473;Mel Brooks is a genius.
I:9836;474;There are so many instantly recognizable one.
I:9836;475;This is the film that made me love Marty as well.
I:9836;476;Maybe it's just TOO sharp.
I:9836;477;There are plenty of reviews that will explain the plot.
I:9836;478;There is no way to convey the viewing experience and why this movie is so good.
I:9836;479;It will be well worth your investment in time and money.
I:9836;480;This truly is a classic to have in your movie collection.
I:9836;481;actually was quite upset that I waited over 20 years to watch this, and given how difficult it is to construct an homage comedy I was very impressed how easily I heartily laughed out loud appreciating the comedic genius of Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder.
I:9836;482;many would debate the Putting on the Ritz routine as too out there but I found the scene most entertaining and a crowning achievement for our dear sweet crowd loving monster.
I:9836;483;quotable, memorable, brilliant, and most joyous, can highly recommend this for another 20 years minimum!
I:9836;484;This film has more quotable funny lines than most Marx Brothers movies .
I:9836;485;", ""He's going to be very popular"", ""Woof!"""
I:9836;486;", ""Nice grouping"", ""He will curse the day he was born a Frankenstein ."
I:9836;487;", ""Walk this way, this way this way"" You get the picture."
I:9836;488;All of the players give lifetime achievement performances .
I:9836;489;"Marty Feldman was perfect as Igor (""It's pronounced eye."
I:9836;490;"Every scene with the late Ms. kahn is inspired (""Oh sweet mystery of life at last I've found you."")"
I:9836;491;This is Brooks' funniest film and probably the best comedy ever made, bar none.
I:9836;492;No matter how often I watch this movie, it always makes me laugh and is one of the best comedies made.
I:9836;493;I think it is Mel Brook's best work.
I:9836;494;It is hard to pick which part I enjoy the most with all the classic lines .
I:9836;495;Hackman and Boyle together, just a hilarious scene.
I:9836;496;Always a classic comedy mainstay.
I:9836;497;After all these years I still love the cornball comedy.
I:9836;498;And Nice Knockers is my favorite joke, along with the other subtle jokes and wordplay they use.
I:9836;499;Oh. . . i think I love him.
I:9836;500;My fondness for each and every performance (especially Madeline Kahn's and Marty Feldman's) is powerful, magical, pure.
I:9836;501;We keep several for vacations and this is one of our favorites.
I:9836;502;Forgot how funny it is and everyone love watching it.
I:9836;503;Great movie, Wilder at his best.
I:9836;504;Funny stuff that will go over the kid's heads, but you will need to cut alot toward the end.
I:9836;505;We got the movie in our mail in just a couple of days.
I:9836;506;this movie has all the ingredients of a great comedy.
I:9836;507;this had to have been the greatest comedy ever made,because if it wasnt, it wouldnt have a 5.
I:9836;508;A few months ago I had the pleasure of seeing a friend snort his drink through his nose in laughter because of this movie.
I:9836;509;"We were in a party and an acquaintance introduced his new girlfriend and I said under my breath ""What knockers!"""
I:9836;510;Obviously my friend is also a fan of this movie.
I:9836;511;if you have not seen it I envy the laughter that awaits you.
I:9836;512;This masterwork is just one of those serendipitous circumstances when all the elements work beautifully and in just the right amounts.
I:9836;513;white cinematography by Gerald Hirschfeld and the authentic.
I:9836;514;They have written a king's ransom in funny lines that have since become part of comedy film lore.
I:9836;515;"steen"" to escape his ""cuckoo"" bloodline), Wilder balances his trademark wide."
I:9836;516;eyed innocence with the character's monomaniacal drive with perfect aplomb.
I:9836;517;Kenneth Mars has a funny turn as the police inspector, looking very much like a direct cousin of his Fhrer.
I:9836;518;Deglamorized to the point of being heroic, Cloris Leachman is wonderfully over.
I:9836;519;of documentary, which is informative, entertaining and includes even more outtakes.
I:9836;520;There are also a couple of oddly amusing Mexican TV interviews with Feldman, Wilder and Leachman.
I:9836;521;This is a true comedy classic well worth owning and watching over and over again.
I:9836;522;There are so many great things to say about this film.
I:9836;523;all of the performers absolutely nailed their roles.
I:9836;524;"This is a Spoof of the classic ""Frankensteins Monster""."
I:9836;525;"The ""Parade of the Actors"" is wonderfully zany!!"
I:9836;526;great for Halloween when you would rather laugh than cringe.
I:9836;527;I was pleasantly surprized at what I got.
I:9836;528;The use of b/w filming was genius .
I:9836;529;While some of the scenes and innuendoes are not for children, teens and adults will delight in the play on words and hysterical visuals.
I:9836;530;This is an incredibly funny movie!
I:9836;531;I recommend this to anyone with a love of funny horror!
I:9836;532;Peter Boyle and Gene Wilder are hilarious!
I:9836;533;i laughed so hard I thought my head was going to burst!!
I:9836;534;Gene and Peter danced their way into movie history in the funniest scene ever put on film(IMHO)I thank Mel for this precious film every time I watch it.

I:9836;538;It is without a doubt one of the funniest movies ever made.
I:9836;539;Somehow, even the cheesiest humor shown in this movie is funny.
I:9836;540;This movie is a classic.
I:9836;541;I bought it for my daughter to see.
I:9836;542;It is a spoof on the old Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein movies and I love it.
I:9836;543;Many of the scenes make me laugh.
I:9836;544;It also has a great cast and spectacular staging.
I:9836;545;It so funny you will find your self watching over and over again.
I:9836;546;i just love that it was shot in Black and White.
I:9836;547;This movie will keep you in stitches.
I:9836;548;Great stars and a very funny storyline.
I:9836;549;Young Frankenstein is definitely a comic classic.
I:9836;550;"It has hilarious dialogue, lovely visual gags, and social satire (that's obviously found in the original ""Frankenstein"")."
I:9836;551;But this is funny social satire!
I:9836;552;Gene Wilder is brilliant as the young Frankenstein (pronounced Frahn.
I:9836;553;"Teri Garr is attractive as Inga (""Roll in ze hay!"")"
I:9836;554;, while the late Peter Boyle is fantastic as the Frahn.
I:9836;555;This is right near the best movie I've ever seen.
I:9836;556;i liked this film a lot.
I:9836;557;there were a lot of memorable lines to besure.
I:9836;558;but tome,this movie works more as a monster movie.
I:9836;559;gene Wilder is in great form here,asis Teri Gar.
I:9836;560;marti Feldman is a riot.
I:9836;561;peter Boyle is also great.
I:9836;562;andCloris Leachman puts in another brilliant performance.
I:9836;563;of the first four Mel Brooks films i have justseen,this is the best one.
I:9836;564;Even the title music is funny
I:9836;565;All the actors really put it together for an all out laugh out loud comedy.
I:9836;566;A lot of comedy gets dated.
I:9836;567;So funny I almost wet my linens.
I:9836;568;This has to be one of the top ten funny, silly, laugh out loud movies of all times.
I:9836;569;I'm sure I'll watch it again and again and again.
I:9836;570;Unlike many spoofs that have aged, this film is still quite clever, the jokes original and well.
I:9836;571;There are so many witty lines and memorable scenes.
I:9836;572;the cast really makes this film tick.
I:9836;573;Gene Wilder is such a perfect fit for the grandson of the late Dr. Frankenstein.
I:9836;574;Wilder has such a knack for knowing how to hit the right note for comedic effect.
I:9836;575;"brainer
I:9836;576;Terri Garr is wonderful as the sexy blonde assistant Inga, Madeline Kahn perfectly performs the role of Wilder's fianc e, and Peter Boyle embodies the giant.
I:9836;577;There is also a funny cameo from Gene Hackman as the blind hermit who encounters the monster, a classic scene worth viewing repeatedly.
I:9836;578;the extras are quite impressive as well.
I:9836;579;Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein takes a deeper look at the ideas behind the satire.
I:9836;580;It explores Wilder's inspiration to create this film, his collaboration with Mel Brooks, the script, and a look at the casting and roles and the vision for the film.
I:9836;581;a superb comedy that has stood the test of time, and is a tribute to the Frankenstein story, Young Frankenstein never gets old.
I:9836;582;Any fans of Mary Shelley's classic or the Universal classics should check this one out.
I:9836;583;This is by far one of the funniest movies of all time.
I:9836;584;"It's a funny thing about comedy
I:9836;585;I remember as a kid when I first watched this film that I laughed until I cried.
I:9836;586;still, this was enjoyable and if you actually go back and watch all the original Frankenstein movies from the very good first two to the much less so others, you'll appreciate this spoof a whole lot more.
I:9836;587;one of the first great spoofs and certainly funny when it first came out and when I first watched it but now to be fair like most comedies, it has lost much of its hilarity but it is still amusing and very enjoyable if you are also a fan of the old Frankenstein movies.
I:9836;588;One of my favorite Mel Brooks movies.
I:9836;589;He is definitely the king of comedy.
I:9836;590;He chose just the right cast.
I:9836;591;This is definitely one of the best comedies of all time, I can't help but laugh every time that I watch this great film.
I:9836;592;Mel Brooks definitely comes through again with this hilarious parody of Frankenstein.
I:9836;593;The script is funny and the look of the film looks like it was made in the 1930s.
I:9836;594;This film has definitely proven itself over the years and is just as fresh as the day it first was released.
I:9836;595;If you never see another Mel Brooks movie in your life, I highly recommend this.
I:9836;596;If you have never seen it, well then you'll be glad you bought it.
I:9836;597;Nice to have the extras too with this and I enjoyed watching the short documentary.
I:9836;598;It's got a good reputation, but I didn't know what to expect really.
I:9836;599;The townsfolk riot, the monster learns to dance, and a couple of love triangles develop.
I:9836;600;i think this film works best as a tribute to old horror films with comedic elements rather than a straight up comedy.
I:9836;601;It's got great sets (some from the original Frankenstein film), great lighting, and those long periods of silence and minimal score that older films have.
I:9836;602;I haven't seen as many of the old horror films as I would like to, but I have seen enough to think this makes a good stylistic tribute.
I:9836;603;"Funny things definitely do happen (like the monster singing ""Putting on the Ritz"", the police chief's strange, mechanical movements, etc), but if you treat the film like some forgotten horror flick with some unexpected quirks it works a lot better, I think."
I:9836;604;The uncoventional comments and such come off a lot stronger this way, and perhaps this was the intention.
I:9836;605;They're all pretty interesting to watch.
I:9836;606;worth a look for fans of Mel Brooks, and for lovers of the old time horror films.
I:9836;607;Fine comedy actors having a great time retelling a ageless horror story with twisted humor.
I:9836;608;Love the story and the setting.
I:9836;609;One of the funniest movies.
I:9836;610;Base on The Bride of Frankenstein , my whole family can quote lines from the movie.
I:9836;611;This is one of my most enjoyable films I own.
I:9836;612;It has you see andfeel Frankenstein with love.
I:9836;613;Being an almost 18 year old kid i oppose to such comments, at heart this is an excellent film truly one of Mel Brooks finest works.
I:9836;614;This is what new comedy films need to restore.
I:9836;615;"Unbelievably funny
I:9836;616;A Classic comedy for all ages.
I:9836;617;A very young and beautiful Teri Garr doesn't hurt, either!
I:9836;618;"While many people say ""Blazing saddles"" is Mel Brook's best film, My heart belongs to Young Frankenstein."
I:9836;619;Indeed this may be one of the best comedies set to film EVER.
I:9836;620;Setting off to claim the estate he gets swept up in the realization of what his ancestor did and indeed it might be.
I:9836;621;possible!In anyone else's hands this would be a Lovecraftian horror but in the hands of Brooks what follows is a masterful parody of the entire genre of horror films, monster films and even some on social consciousness.
I:9836;622;this is a completely zany film that, because of how it was shot, ages very, very well.
I:9836;623;Mel Brooks is one of those comedic people you love.
I:9836;624;But I think everyone can appreciate his contribution to the genre.
I:9836;625;I find this particular film, when quoted randomly at parties, in public, with perfect strangers, still gets me the highest fives, the biggest laughs, and the most nostalgic nods from fans of every walk of life.
I:9836;626;Because it's genius and classic.
I:9836;627;If you want comedy, look no further then Mel Brooks and his film Young Frankenstein is one of the best places to start.
I:9836;628;They are all great and insightful.
I:9836;629;That's the best advice anyone could say about this film.
I:9836;630;Just go and enjoy this one of a kind perfection.
I:9836;631;Hilarious performances by every cast member and a great screenplay.
I:9836;632;This is one of the funniest Mel Brooks films ever, exceeded in my opinion only by The Producers.
I:9836;633;Gene Wilder considers Young Frankenstein his best role ever.
I:9836;634;liners, slapstick and even sexual jokes are a hysterical today as they were 30 years ago.
I:9836;635;Each of them at the top of their game delivering comedic gems ranging from the subversive to the coarse.
I:9836;636;brooks is at the top of his game here, too .
I:9836;637;deftly combining the performances, the writing.
I:9836;638;ups) to create a brilliant and funny masterpiece.
I:9836;639;Regardless of whatever else they may have done in life, Gene Wilder, Teri Garr, Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Kenneth Mars and Cloris Leachman have forever been immortalized by that crazy genius Mel Brooks in this, the funniest and cleverest comedy ever made.
I:9836;640;There have been some exceptional comedies produced over the years, but this one has got the perfect combination of ingredients to make it the best ever.
I:9836;641;I can practically guarantee that you will never look upon any of these performers in the same light after you've seen them in this gem!
I:9836;642;This is truly a monumental comedy, containing some of the funniest scenes ever filmed and the most memorable and quotable one.
I:9836;643;liners and zingers ever uttered.
I:9836;644;You will absolutely have to watch it a number of times to be able to catch everything that happens during the course of this fine film.
I:9836;645;subtle references to past movies and performers, the over.
I:9836;646;top performances themselves, the perfectly timed sound and musical effects, and the overall feeling produced by the use of black.
I:9836;647;white film, all combine to make this a most memorable viewing experience.
I:9836;648;Turn out the lights, unplug the phone, and watch this beauty with someone who has a good sense of humor and loves a great comedy, and you'll see for yourself just what a classic it is!
I:9836;649;This is an extremely funny movie.
I:9836;650;A perfectly cast Peter Boyle and Ken Mars two actors who never got very much use in Hollywood.
I:9836;651;When I first saw this movie, I couldn't help but laugh.
I:9836;652;Brooks proved his critics wrong and it became an instant success at the box office throughout the world.
I:9836;653;thirty years to the day have passed since the making of Young Frankenstein which still remains an all time classic with the zany characters of Wilder, Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, Teri Garr, Cloris Leachman with her role as Frau Blcher (whinny!)
I:9836;654;A great movie for you Brooks fans.
I:9836;655;For the time this was made this was a spoof of a good movie.
I:9836;656;The jokes could have been better but still a good watch.
I:9836;657;She has a few funny lines, but she is a much better actress than this movie shows.
I:9836;658;One thing that Mel Brooks has done well is to hire good music resources.
I:9836;659;"The theme of ""Young Frankenstein"" is clever and fits the ""fake"" and the ""real"" setting well."
I:9836;660;It's mysterious and still faintly derisive.
I:9836;661;"(""High Anxiety"" is another movie with great scoring.)"
I:9836;662;My favorite Mel Brooks' film.
I:9836;663;I gave it to a 15 year old who also loves it.
I:9836;664;I think it's a good idea to acquaint a younger generation with the classics from the past.
I:9836;665;In fact I have watched it numerous times.
I:9836;666;It is a hilarious play on an old story and highly recommended for young adults and us old codgers.
I:9836;667;time funniest movies ever made (one of many by Mel Brooks that are on that list) and a delight from beginning to end.
I:9836;668;I loved seeing some of the deleted scenes and the actors chosen for their roles were perfect.
I:9836;669;"Marty Feldman alone accounted for quite a few of the laughs, really making the role of ""Eye."
I:9836;670;Mel Brooks at his best in this crazy rendition of the Frankenstein story.
I:9836;671;There's a laugh around every corner.
I:9836;672;The casting was suberb as well.
I:9836;673;One of the best movies ever made that pays homage to the horror film genre of Universal Pictures.
I:9836;674;Now, this film, Young Frankenstein is of the genius writing by Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks.
I:9836;675;This fine film is a spoof of the Frankenstein films.
I:9836;676;It is a comedy, you may laugh at it all that you want to.
I:9836;677;It was made for laughter.
I:9836;678;The film was also nominated for Best Sound.
I:9836;679;1974 was a tough year for Oscar.
I:9836;680;So many wonderful films were shown.
I:9836;681;minute documentary Making Frankensense of Young Frankenstein .
I:9836;682;This movie is 36 years old but Mel Brooks' shamelessly absurd sense of humor holds up very well.
I:9836;683;This is absolutely one of the funniest pictures ever made!
I:9836;684;This , in my opinion is the best Mel Brooks movie.
I:9836;685;It's amazing to me that a movie can be so faithful to the original movies and yet be so funny.
I:9836;686;Young Frankenstein had everything that the original had, yet was laugh.
I:9836;687;"Gene Wilder does an excellent job
I:9836;688;From taffeta to Froedrick to Schwanshtuke to BOYFRIEND, Young Frankenstein literally foams with wit, witticisms, and wily quotes, and I maintain it's more quotes than even Casablanca or Citizen Kane combined.
I:9836;689;"As I sit here and listen to the opening theme from Mel Brook's ""Young Frankenstein"", the strings stir my soul and remind me why I love this movie so much."
I:9836;690;"being an absolute ""Frankenstein"" fan (Mary Shelley's classic is my all."
I:9836;691;Wilder's 'take' on this science fiction classic (penned by a nineteen.year.
I:9836;692;shows his sincerity and love for Shelley's timeless story of man's neverending yet sometime tragic desire to emulate his creator.
I:9836;693;"The characters rendered in ""Young Frankenstein"" serve a two."
I:9836;694;it's our nature as imperfect beings to do so.
I:9836;695;The second purpose, simply enough, is to make us laugh at those mistakes.
I:9836;696;The character Frederick's realization of this culminates at the end of the film, as all is well.
I:9836;697;the entire cast of this film brought so much talent to the telling of this story that I'm sometimes amazed that they even finished the film without having laughed themselves to death.
I:9836;698;Fortunately, this comedy masterpiece was put into the capable hands of Mel Brooks, and we're all better off because of it.
I:9836;699;those of us who love this film know full well the merit of its' attraction and comedic genius.
I:9836;700;Young Frankenstein is truly one CAN'T MISS and MUST HAVE films you will ever see.
I:9836;701;no matter how many times I watch this move it always puts a smile on my face.
I:9836;702;This is a classic, the great Mel Brooks directs a great cast in a side splitting, hilarious horror spoof.
I:9836;703;Its a superbly acted, and wonderfully directed film.
I:9836;704;This great Blu Ray of Young Frankenstein is a must of you're a Mel Brooks fan,yes it's grainy but that's the way it was filmed!
I:9836;705;Classic comedy at it's very finest!!!
I:9836;706;This may just be the funniest movie of all time.
I:9836;707;is doing their absolutely finest work ever.
I:9836;708;and to Peter Boyle, for his very poignant and funny depiction of the Monster.
I:9836;709;but standing above all of the end in terms of sheer brilliance is Madeline Kahn, giving what must be the funniest female performace ever on film as Frankenstein's fiancee and the monster's eventual bride.
I:9836;710;"Unlike everyone else in the film, she's not really parodying anyone other than herself
I:9836;711;It is the funniest five seconds in the entire film.
I:9836;712;and in a film this hilarious that's saying a lot.
I:9836;713;This is one of my favorite movies by Gene Wilder and one of the few that is directed by Mel Brooks where he doesn't make a cameo appearance.
I:9836;714;I would highly recommend this to people of all ages who need a good laugh
I:9836;715;Nobody does it better. . . nope not ever.
I:9836;716;Nothing beats the breakfast scene when they discuss the monsters dimensions.
I:9836;717;He will have an enormous. . . It goes without saying.
I:9836;718;One suggestion, watch the two Frankenstein movies mentioned above before seeing this one.
I:9836;719;I think this is Mel Brooks' best movie.
I:9836;720;It was an instant classic.
I:9836;721;Some of the documentary portions are as funny as the movie!
I:9836;722;One of the funniest movies ever made.
I:9836;723;My dad let me watch it when I was younger and I've loved it ever since.
I:9836;724;It also has a great transfer.
I:9836;725;It is absolute brilliance, pure comedy gold, and arguably the funniest movie ever made.
I:9836;726;Obviously crafted with a lot of love, the black and white cinematography is gorgeous, the writing is pitch perfect, and the cast is amazing.
I:9836;727;One of the crown jewels of American comedy.
I:9836;728;My girlfriend shares my comedic enjoyment, and she had lent out her copy of this flick and never got it back, so I replaced it .
I:9836;729;Wanted this film in my collection and finally got it with the added bonus of the OUTTAKES.
I:9836;730;I love when it is evident that the actors are having just as much fun making the film as I did watching it.
I:9836;731;Worth having in your film library as one of the all time great comedies.
I:9836;732;Hilarious yet emotional, dark yet brilliantly funny.
I:9836;733;crisp and in all it's widescreen glory, it's truely not to be missed.
I:9836;734;The comic timing in this piece is spot on and there are subtle laughs throughout ( Don't worry my dear, it's just a rat.
I:9836;735;This film delivers an unwavering barrage of humor featuring work from some of the greatest comedic minds of the film age.
I:9836;736;Mel Brooks is known for his funny movies,and Young Frankenstein may be his funniest of them all.Young Frankenstein stars Gene Wilder as Dr. frankenstein,Marty Feldman as Igor,Teri Garr as Inga,and Peter Boyle as the monster.
I:9836;737;fredrick then becomes overcome with his great.
I:9836;738;this Movie is very funny watch for all the spoofs of the original Frankenstein movies,and books.
I:9836;739;the fake accents are hilarious and Gene Hackman is perfect in his role.
I:9836;740;this film is for everyone who likes to laugh alot.
I:9836;741;This just might be the funniest movie ever made.
I:9836;742;Brook's, Wilder's and the entire crew's efforts created scene after scene of flawless timing, great characterizations, and 'classic' comedy.
I:9836;743;it's great fun that can be watched and enjoyed over and over again.
I:9836;744;Mel Brooks has always been a favorite and his movies are pure comedic gold.
I:9836;745;very clear, sound perfect, very enjoyable after having seen it manyyears ago.
I:9836;746;accurate mailing dates as well.
I:9836;747;Definately won't disappoint fans of comedy.
I:9836;748;Cloris Leachman and Marty Feldman are excellent in the film complimenting the comedic genious of Gene Wilder.
I:9836;749;pure laughs all the way.
I:9836;750;terri Garr is also very funny in the picture.
I:9836;751;Gene Hackman has an amazing role as the blind hermit, making this film as good as any comedy I've ever seen in his segment.
I:9836;752;He's hilarious here in this movie.
I:9836;753;Marty Feldman could do anything he wanted to in the comedy genre and be entertaining, and this movie bears that out perfectly where Marty plays the part of Igor.
I:9836;754;Teri Garr has some moments in the film to make young boys successfully get through puberty, and Madeline Kahn is excellent for her portrayal of an annoying conceited nincompoop woman engaged to Gene Wilder's character .
I:9836;755;which really surprised me since he has important roles out in front for most of his movies.
I:9836;756;I thought attention to detail was good for the sets, and was pleasantly surprised by the casting.
I:9836;757;Very entertaining and funny film.
I:9836;758;I recommend it without a doubt.
I:9836;759;One of the best comdies ever.
I:9836;760;Ah yes i love this movie it is great, It was nice seeing it in blu.
I:9836;761;I am happy to have it on blu.
I:9836;762;it has become a family classic and we actually quote some of the one.
I:9836;763;people think we are a bit loony sometimes, but it is total fun.
I:9836;764;This is one of the few films that has enough laughs to fill about 10films.
I:9836;765;gene wilder and Marty Feldman are fantastic.
I:9836;766;i can view this filmover and over,and still laugh all the way through.
I:9836;767;I have seen all of Mel Brooks' films, and I consider Young Frankenstein to be his finest work.
I:9836;768;Young Frankenstein is a great parody for three reasons.
I:9836;769;The first, every actor in the cast are at their hysterical best.
I:9836;770;Along with Tootsie, Airplane, and There's Something About Mary, Young Frankenstein is one of the funniest comedies in cinematic history.
I:9836;771;Thanks Amazon for the in.
I:9836;772;One of the most consistently hilarious films on record, the Brooks/ Wilder team creates a loving authenticity with actual Universal Studios props and use of black and white photography.
I:9836;773;Just as hilarious the tenth time around.
I:9836;774;I love this movie and it was a great deal.
I:9836;775;So much funny jokes in one movie.
I:9836;776;The scariest comedy of all time!
I:9836;777;When a tagline pokes fun at itself, you know you're in for a real treat.
I:9836;778;Such is the case with Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, one of the greatest of all comedies and one of the only modern day films able to convince me from the start that I really was watching an old 30s film, and not a film made in 1974.
I:9836;779;mel Brooks and Gene Wilder are both fans of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and so when they collaborated to write the screenplay for Young Frankenstein, I can only assume that it was a fun experience for both of them.
I:9836;780;They reworked the story of Frankenstein and his monster into a smart, occasionally hilarious, always enjoyable, classic comedy that helped put Brooks on the map after The Producers ( Blazing Saddles also helped quite a bit).
I:9836;781;out continuation of Baron von Frankenstein's legacy, with an added pinch of slapstick comedy thrown in for good measure.
I:9836;782;Frederick is a successful neurosurgeon, eager to put his past behind him.
I:9836;783;The comedy works, the style works, everything about it works.
I:9836;784;Everything in it is classic Mel Brooks comedy.
I:9836;785;screen fights during filming are pretty well known.
I:9836;786;assured, mean, forthright character .
I:9836;787;location in the original Frankenstein set, the film partly works because of its respect for the old horror films.
I:9836;788;They compliment them and poke fun with them .
I:9836;789;Part of the greatness of this film is the manner in which it is filmed.
I:9836;790;Now, it is true that some of Mel Brooks movies are funnier than others and this is his funniest movie with Blazing Saddles being a very close second.
I:9836;791;"the scene I loved the most is when ""the monster"" visits the blind man."
I:9836;792;Oh my, God, Peter Boyle's expressions are positively priceless.
I:9836;793;Good God!I also love the parts with Madeline Khan and Kenneth Mars.
I:9836;794;I love the whole movie!
I:9836;795;I think what makes this movie absolutely brilliant was Brooks decision to film it in black and white and use a lot of the same techniques that James Wale used to create the original Frankenstein.
I:9836;796;Now they have a behind the scenes look at every movie ever made.
I:9836;797;yeah, get this incredible movie.
I:9836;798;It just might be the funniest movie of all time.
I:9836;799;It's also tender in places.
I:9836;800;Mel Brooks was never this good again.
I:9836;801;This parody of the Frankenstein series has some very hilarious sequences that include Dr. frankenstein making people think his name is Fronkensteen or where he shreiks It's Alive!
I:9836;802;I've loved this movie since the first time that I saw it.
I:9836;803;Gene Wilder has always been one of my favorite actors.
I:9836;804;My favorite scene in the movie is when Gene and the Monster dance to Putting on the Ritz.
I:9836;805;This movie always makes me laugh and feel better about the world.
I:9836;806;Always loved this movie since the time I first saw it years ago!I was excited to finally have it on Blu ray.
I:9836;807;this movie is a classic!
I:9836;808;"Favorite movie of ALL time
I:9836;809;"Inspired beyond words, ""Young Frankenstein"" ranks with ""Blazzing Saddles"" and ""The Producers"" as Mel Brooks' finest contributions to film."
I:9836;810;And, we must be grateful for his mettle, his moxie and unparalleled genius as he romps his way through the classic Monster tale of all time.
I:9836;811;Marty Feldman is indelible and unforgettable as Igor, the irreplaceable Madeline Kahn won an Oscar Nomination, and the film served as comedic landmarks for the lieks of Terri Garr ( Tootsie) and the legendary Gene Hackman.
I:9836;812;splittingly funny, and others lighthearted and tender in the way only Brooks and Wilder could possibly pull off.
I:9836;813;YOung Frankenstien is perhaps his best Brooks character if for no other reason than he is equally looped out and bizarre, part Willy Wonka, part nerdy gunslinger.
I:9836;814;He's hilarious and gentle here, in a movie that will tug your heart even while you're coughing it up laughing!!!
I:9836;815;A movie that I think will be funny still for years to come.
I:9836;816;ray looks and sounds absolutely astonishing as well.
I:9836;817;roll, roll, roll in ze hay!
I:9836;818;This is a funny movie.
I:9836;819;I gave it as a gift a long time ago and the recipient loved it.
I:9836;820;Still talks about it so I know it was a hit.
I:9836;821;unique to this Brooks move: it's in black and white.
I:9836;822;rating his films, I put Young Frankenstein behind The Producers, on a par with Blazing Saddles, and ahead of Silent Movie.
I:9836;823;Perhaps this makes Mel Brooks a yenta with an education and a sense of humor.
I:9836;824;Another classic and a top notch Mel Brooks hit.
I:9836;825;A movie/spoof for the ages.
I:9836;826;If you need a well acted and genuinely clever comedy, this is it.
I:9836;827;This is simply the funniest movie ever!
I:9836;828;Audio/visuals still effective (and just musing, but is it right to expect the film to look better than in '74?)
I:9836;829;Great classic movie with many lines that can be quoted over and over a must have for folks into movies
I:9836;830;Such a marvelously funny movie with a splendid cast.
I:9836;831;Gene Wilder is wonderful, as always and, indeed, I can't say enough about the enjoyment I get from this movie.
I:9836;832;This is Mel Brooks best movie ever!
I:9836;833;but it gets funnier every time!
I:9836;834;This is one of the best comedies of all time.
I:9836;835;It's the kind of movie that you put on to show a specific scene to a friend and wind up watching the rest of the movie, constantly saying this is a great scene .
I:9836;836;Mel Brooks does a great commentary.
I:9836;837;It's always a roll in ze hay to watch this hilarious movie.
I:9836;838;Check out the old Universal horror flicks to get the full cultural resonance, or just enjoy a couple hours of sublime silliness.
I:9836;839;Lines from Young Frankenstein are appropriately amusing in almost every social situation, too, so study up kids!
I:9836;840;"I can promise that you will be asking your friends and co. workers, ""Have you seen Young Frankenstein?"""
I:9836;841;", which will result in instant laughter and an afternoon of ""quoting"" the flick with its inummerable ""good ones""."
I:9836;842;THE best comedy of the 20th century without a doubt!
I:9836;843;I remembered him saying he liked the movie.
I:9836;844;OK this film is a total classic.
I:9836;845;"It ranks up there with ""Ghjostbusters"" and ""reposessed,"" not to mention ""Saturday the 14"" as classic parody film."
I:9836;846;there is a fine line between laughture and terror, and this film cuts across all boundaries!
I:9836;847;If you think that's funny, you'll love this.
I:9836;848;I loved this film when Dad took us kids to see it in the 70's when first released and watching it still gives me endless chuckles today!
I:9836;849;Young Frankenstein is not only Mel Brooks' best film, but the entire cast's best performances are captured in this pic as well.
I:9836;850;And a great FAMILY FILM to boot (although I'm sure that was not Mr. Brooks' intention).
I:9836;851;it's the perfect combination of a 'scary movie' and a 'funny movie' combined.
I:9836;852;He loves pretending to be the Monster singing Puttin' On the Ritz!
I:9836;853;Really a close call with Blazing Saddles as Brooks' best but I'll have to give this one the edge since it is so endlessly enjoyable.
I:9836;854;If you haven't seen this one you are definitely in for a treat!
I:9836;855;I saw this opening with a friend who was a Universal horror movie buff and an NBC film editor.
I:9836;856;Although the plot was conceived by Gene Wilder it was modified and directed by Mel Brooks and may have been his best movie.
I:9836;857;it almost made me wet my pants several times and was hilariously funny from start to finish.
I:9836;858;It also went to Broadway in the form of a musical comedy, which I never saw.
I:9836;859;The video is sharp and clear with excellent contrast!
I:9836;860;The movie is a great way to have one's funny bone tickled.
I:9836;861;We both love this movie.
I:9836;862;It is an old classic!
I:9836;863;Brillant and every moment funny, Brooks best directed movie and stunning performances from every actor.
I:9836;864;wilder was in his prime.
I:9836;865;very funny, all time great movie out there.
I:9836;866;such a classic, great actors, great comedy, great funny lines.
I:9836;867;This is the best satire of the horror film ever made.
I:9836;868;The makers of this film did a good job trying to make lots.
I:9836;869;Later, he keeps on searching around the castle and one of the rooms was WHERE he did it.
I:9836;870;Easily one of the funniest films I have ever seen, a must own.
I:9836;871;This movie is an old classic.
I:9836;872;Gene Wilder and his cronies are absolutely hilarious in this take on the Frankenstein story.
I:9836;873;If you enjoy comedy, especially old.
I:9836;874;fashioned, 3 Stooges type of comedy.
I:9836;875;My grandchildren always want to watch this when they come over.
I:9836;876;I love this film, which is without a doubt one of the ten funniest films ever created (and offhand, the other nine don't come to mind).
I:9836;877;YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is both an homage and a comic send.
I:9836;878;robber and necromancer nonpareil, is an amusing echo of Colin Clive's ghoulish journey from dedicated Scientist to Mad Doctor, in which the humor of this movie becomes the honorarium paid to the earlier film.YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is as funny today as it was in 1974 when it was released.
I:9836;879;A staple of the cable channels, it is incredible that a film seen so often can stay so fresh, but YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN has everyone involved contributing their finest skills at the peak of their powers.
I:9836;880;"This scene inspired Aerosmith to write their classic rock hit, appropriately entitled, ""Walk This Way."")"
I:9836;881;I thought you wanted to.
I:9836;882;wilder and Boyle's unforgettable white.
I:9836;883;Note if you will, the slight question in her tone at the end of her lines, as though asking if this is okay.
I:9836;884;I always end up howling with laughter at this moment, even though I've seen this picture at least 100 times.
I:9836;885;The entire film is crafted with moments like this, a jeweled net of pure comic genius.
I:9836;886;filmed in atmospheric black and white and borrowing the original lab equipment from James Whale's equally ageless now 77 year old film for dramatic effect, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN has unquestionably earned its place both as a classic comedy and as a classic in the monster movie canon on it's own merits.
I:9836;887;There are few other films made by anyone at any time, which have struck such pure comic notes.
I:9836;888;I love love love this movie.
I:9836;889;I grew up watching it with my family so when I saw that this was available on blu ray I just had to have it.
I:9836;890;it was in perfect condition in its original packaging and case.
I:9836;891;A must see for all of you Mel Brooks fans.
I:9836;892;This movie is a classic.
I:9836;893;If you like Mel Brooks movies you'll LOVE this film.
I:9836;894;It truly is one you can watch over and over again.
I:9836;895;Cloris Leachman is perfect in her role.
I:9836;896;Young Frankenstein is a classic.
I:9836;897;Crisp, clear, with excellent contrast.
I:9836;898;The extra content is icing on the cake.
I:9836;899;There is a wonderful 36 minute documentary on the making of the movie.
I:9836;900;There are several trailers and some interviews with the stars.
I:9836;901;And there are numerous bloopers.
I:9836;902;Commentary from Mel Brooks would likely be as funny as the movie itself.
I:9836;903;And this special edition is a wonderful way to celebrate an all.
I:9836;904;First of all, this is my all time favorite movie.
I:9836;905;The movie is funny, and the bonus features on the disk are a real bonus.
I:9836;906;It was so funny I almost peed in my pants.
I:9836;907;This is hilarious and an entertaining take on Frankenstein.
I:9836;908;Enjoy it in good fun.
I:9836;909;This has got to be one of the funniest movies ever made with a lot of great comedy talent all together.
I:9836;910;a must have for anyone who loves great comedy!
I:9836;911;The video was in perfect condition and they were quick to deliver it.
I:9836;912;A comic masterpiece that has an air of the original.
I:9836;913;A great watch for any age and great for those that have never seen it before to get acquainted with Mel's older films.
I:9836;914;People might find other Mel Brooks films to be funnier, pointing to The Producers and Blazzing Saddles, but I still think that Young Frankenstein is far and away his best film ever.
I:9836;915;, Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth ( Ah, sweet mystery of life at last you've found me! )
I:9836;916;I even like the film score by John Morris that sets the right tone from start to finish, including the haunting theme that lures the monster back to the castle where he was born (with a nice French horn part for Igor).
I:9836;917;but what I really think makes this film work is that there are several scenes that are played absolutely straight, such as when Frederick reclaims his family name and the Monster is tormented in the jail cell.
I:9836;918;Yes, this is a comedy, but it has a strong affection for the films it is spoofing, Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein, that comes through in several excellent homages.
I:9836;919;This was one of me and my dad's favorite movies to watch and laugh at together when I was a kid.
I:9836;920;I have a love/hate relationship with this comedy.
I:9836;921;On the other hand, there are so many funny moments and great lines.
I:9836;922;It is one of the best satires of all time.
I:9836;923;This classic 1974 Mel Brooks comedy will one again have you in stitches .
I:9836;924;along with The Monster, played here by Peter Boyle .
I:9836;925;this time in full high def.
I:9836;926;Fortunately the transfer from film to digital was well done: both the image and audio are very good.
I:9836;927;Great movie for watching at home with the family and friends.
I:9836;928;Very funny in a campy sorta way.
I:9836;929;This is one of my favorite movies and always will be.
I:9836;930;This is one of my son's (adult) favorite movies.
I:9836;931;Definitely worth adding to video collection.Young Frankenstein (Special Edition)
I:9836;932;This was a Christmas gift for our son.
I:9836;933;He loves Mel Brooks movies and is trying to collect them all.
I:9836;934;I met my husband and we quoted lines from this movie and I knew I had found my soulmate.
I:9836;935;He was a true fan as I was.
I:9836;936;'Young Frankenstein' erm sorry that's Fronkensteen is in my opinion the best comedy that Mel Brooks directed.
I:9836;937;Young Frankenstein is a cult classic that deserves a wider following.
I:9836;938;He meets the lovely Inga, who is to be his lab assistant (Teri Garr), and the outrageous Igor (Marty Feldman) who gives many of the laughs in the film.
I:9836;939;The townspeople revolt, with disastrous and funny consequences.
I:9836;940;I asked my husband just to give YF a chance, and he laughed so hard, and is still quoting lines from the movie today.
I:9836;941;"I thought ""Blazing Saddles"" was funny, but ""Young Frankenstein"" was even funnier."
I:9836;942;inga (nicely played by the beautiful Teri Garr) is Frederick's ditzy blonde laboratory assistant.
I:9836;943;the humor in this movie is multi.
I:9836;944;The scene with the revolving bookcase remains one of my favorite scenes.
I:9836;945;there are plenty of one.
I:9836;946;liners to keep the pace moving.
I:9836;947;You take the blonde and I'll take the one in the turban.
I:9836;948;"this movie pays homage to ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Bride of Frankenstein."""
I:9836;949;My favorite material was the making.
I:9836;950;The variety of trailers included gave potential viewers a good preview of the movie.
I:9836;951;Young Frankenstein is a movie that has managed to retain its humor for decades.
I:9836;952;The jokes are generally timeless, and most of them are set up well enough to be funny.
I:9836;953;The result is one of the best movies that Mel Brooks ever directed, and one of the best movies in which these actors appeared.
I:9836;954;This movie is a must.
I:9836;955;have for fans of comedy and for fans of classic horror films.
I:9836;956;I bought this movie for my grandson.
I:9836;957;it's obvious that everyone has warm feelings about the film, and the recollections are sharp and insightful.
I:9836;958;"So make ""Son of Frankenstein"" ALSO required viewing prior to seeing ""Young Frankenstein."
I:9836;959;This film was made with such love by all concerned, and it shows.
I:9836;960;Yes, it can be occasionally crass, and go for obvious cheap laughs (albeit MUCH less so than any movie Mel has made before or since), but what one ultimately takes away from this movie is the incredible amount of care everyone took with the project.
I:9836;961;the awesome score by John Morris helps a lot!)
I:9836;962;"I wish there was a color version of this movie
I:9836;963;Absolutely hilarious, from start to finish, with stellar performances by all.
I:9836;964;The film is a parody of the original novel Frankenstein, and uses props created for the original 1931 film.
I:9836;965;It isn't as funny as Blazing Saddles but it is an enjoyable movie with a number of laughs.
I:9836;966;I see something new in it each time I watch it.
I:9836;967;Some may not like this movie because it was filmed in black and white but that's what makes it so good.
I:9836;968;One of the funniest movies ever made.
I:9836;969;My husband and I laugh hysterically each time we watch it.
I:9836;970;Love this movie, happy to find it available to replace my VHS.
I:9836;971;Good vibes is what I look for in any thing I am a partaker of.
I:9836;972;"This movie has good vibes and it's funny as s*** or farts is more appropriate 
I:9836;973;This movie is soooo funny, and a classic movie on top of that.
I:9836;974;For those of you that love comedy, yet want to keep it real without cussing, and no class .
I:9836;975;It's always a bit dangerous when a medium uses itself as its subject.
I:9836;976;Ever since burlesque, there's the gorgeous, barely dressed creature as part of the comedy.
I:9836;977;In this case, it's Terry Garr who is both achingly beautiful and approachable.
I:9836;978;if you are a lover of horror films who also has a sense of humor, this is probably one of the best movies ever made.
I:9836;979;But even if you don't love horror, this is a good flick because the lessons of comedy are followed.
I:9836;980;I really likes this movie from just seeing it on tv and now that I have it I am just so satisfied with it.
I:9836;981;I would recomend it to anyone who has seen Willy wonka and the chocolate factory becasue Gene Wilder is amazing in this film.
I:9836;982;Anyone who wants a comedy and a classic this is your movie!!!
I:9836;983;On the one hand, this is a movie that should be widely available in every format.
I:9836;984;These same reviewers give high marks to some great films on Blu.
I:9836;985;yet another distortion of the ratings system.
I:9836;986;"(Of course, one could treat movie releases as mere ""products,"" and spend time commenting on how well the hinges work, or how well the packaging is made, or how true the ""blacks"" happen to be."
I:9836;987;And so, to get to the point, this is Mel Brooks' shining moment, a film that is a brilliantly funny homage to the classic horror films of the thirties.
I:9836;988;Some might complain about the corn content, but it works, and the performances by a stellar cast .
I:9836;989;For more, I defer to Count Orlok '22's spot on review above.
I:9836;990;As far as Mel Brooks films goes, this is one of his best, maybe only surpassed by Blazing Saddles .
I:9836;991;Friedrich, now living in the U. s., travels to his now.
I:9836;992;From then on, it's pure comedy.
I:9836;993;The film is an absolute must.
I:9836;994;and it was almost like watching the movie that first, glorious time.
I:9836;995;uh I mean Fronk in shteenJohnny Depp is a brilliant actor, no doubt.
I:9836;996;proof of Wilder's enormous talent.
I:9836;997;it was great to see such a cast of legends in their earlier years.
I:9836;998;Not always, but it made me laugh and I can say that I had a good time.
I:9836;999;It's is good parodia of the original tape.
I:9836;1000;The movie is here and worth lots more than I paid for it.
I:9836;1001;What a great cult classic film!
I:9836;1002;It's a part of our Halloween family tradition.
I:9836;1003;I loved this movie the first time I saw it and I loved it now(20 years later).
I:9836;1004;it will have you in stitches,very funny and clever.
I:9836;1005;One of the most sophisticated comedy movies ever produced.
I:9836;1006;Almost every line of script is memorable.
I:9836;1007;Great acting and a great cast.
I:9836;1008;Parts are funny, and parts are just okay.
I:9836;1009;An isolated score track, a commentary track as well as the original soundtrack and a new hopped.
I:9836;1010;The picture and the sound are PERFECT!
I:9836;1011;This is as good as this baby will ever look.
I:9836;1012;Yes, I did make a yummy sound!
I:9836;1013;This is one of the great Mel Brook classics.
I:9836;1014;The great acting and super puns keep me in stitches and the inclusion of the operetta song from Herbert's Naughty Marietta is hilariously appropriate!
I:9836;1015;Mel Brooks created just the right chemistry for this slapstick gem.
I:9836;1016;The cast, script and cinematography were perfectly combined to create a quotable, and hilarious, work of art.
I:9836;1017;Highly recommended for Halloween or any time you want a belly laugh.
I:9836;1018;Taking the first too Frankenstein flick and spoofing all the scenes into a great comedy.
I:9836;1019;Another great movie with all the right people in it!
I:9836;1020;Great plot, with not a dull moment.
I:9836;1021;Amazing how the writers could find something funny about every subject in the movie!
I:9836;1022;the comic antics from all of the characters always cracks me up.
I:9836;1023;I usually love Mel Brooks movies and I'm a huge fan of Get Smart from TV .
I:9836;1024;Either way I didn't really enjoy this like I wanted to.
I:9836;1025;I'm still keeping it though .
I:9836;1026;Well, actually, this isnt a horror movie.
I:9836;1027;Hasnt everyone pronounced the name as Eee.
I:9836;1028;"Riding with Inga, a delicious cookie that I would love to dunk in my ""Varm Ovaltine"",who is part ""looking for a role in the hay"" and part ""Dr Frankenstein's lab assistant""."
I:9836;1029;"Her job is to ""raise"" the good Doctor."
I:9836;1030;Okay, sounds good to me.
I:9836;1031;igor has a hump on his shoulder!
I:9836;1032;the scene where the young girl, a Teeter Totter enthusiast, demands that the Monster gets on the Teeter, or Totter, with her, and suddenly acquires some impressive frequent flyer miles, is hilarious.
I:9836;1033;the entire movie is a warm, inviting, campfire of comedic genuis, which horror.
I:9836;1034;comedy transgenre'd people will have a riot watching.
I:9836;1035;well, I've got to go now.
I:9836;1036;"So please call me ""Abbey""."
I:9836;1037;found it on Amazon!This movie is fantastic, with a who's who of movies.
I:9836;1038;so I really did not get all the references I'm sure Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder made in their brilliant screenplay to those films of cinematic history.
I:9836;1039;"liners, and performances (for the cast is entirely flawless
I:9836;1040;From the breathtaking cinematography to the Oscar.
I:9836;1041;it's a genuine monster film!
I:9836;1042;Oh sweet mystery of life at last I've found you!!
I:9836;1043;Mel Brooks is a genius.
I:9836;1044;the director's commentary by Mel Brooks is a nice added bonus.
I:9836;1045;Enjoyed this movie this time as much as when it first came out.
I:9836;1046;My teenagers kids weren't busting a gut so much, but enjoyed watching the older folks laugh it up.
I:9836;1047;until his ancestor's last will testament arrives.
I:9836;1048;This movie is SO funny and hilariously over.
I:9836;1049;"whelming 
I:9836;1050;I bought this movie at a great price!
I:9836;1051;$5 and it was well worth it!
I:9836;1052;The picture is reat and just as i remember it!
I:9836;1053;It is so clever and funny.
I:9836;1054;If you like funny movies and happy endings, get this movie!
I:9836;1055;Truley one of the funniest movies ever made!
I:9836;1056;This is Mel Brooks at his very best along with a superb cast.
I:9836;1057;This movie has made millions of people laugh, (hysterically!)
I:9836;1058;"One of the funniest scenes is when the Creature rapes Elizabeth, but she's so overcome by his ""size"" she bursts out singing ""Oh sweet mystery of life at last I've found you!"""
I:9836;1059;That scene is one of the funniest ever filmed, and highly worth metioning!
I:9836;1060;It is sure to put a smile on your face and have you quoting the characters lines for years to come.
I:9836;1061;God bless you all, and may you all rest in peace.
I:9836;1062;You take the blonde and I'll take the one in the turban!
I:9836;1063;Deserves more than five stars.
I:9836;1064;century horror films that the story inspired.
I:9836;1065;"that is, until he discovers his grandfather's secret diary and decides that he too can create life!Filmed entirely in black and white, ""Young Frankenstein"" is a classic comedic film that continues to entertain both old and young alike."
I:9836;1066;With a combination of wonderful acting, hilarious accents (especially those used by Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr and Kenneth Mars) and the exquisitely written plot and dialog, it is unlikely that anyone watching this film will be able to do so with a straight face.
I:9836;1067;"Overall, I rate ""Young Frankenstein"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and very highly recommend it."
I:9836;1068;This was my favorite Brooks movie next to Blazing Saddles and it is definitely in the Top 10 of my favorite all time comedies
I:9836;1069;of course, Mel Brookss young Frankenstien is a classic and is very very funny.
I:9836;1070;Gene Wilder is great and so is Martin Feldman as Igor, but its that damn Gene Hackman cameo as the blindman which is the funniest sceen in the movie.
I:9836;1071;Nicely shot in black and white.
I:9836;1072;Anyway, its a great Mel Brooks film next to Blazing Saddles and SpaceBalls.
I:9836;1073;Thirty years later, Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder's YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN remains a classic comedy, filmed with such loving affection for the classic it spoofed.
I:9836;1074;So much of the humor is played so straight, it becomes even funnier.
I:9836;1075;But take the film's classic black and white photography and cinematography which evokes the pure essence of the original films.
I:9836;1076;Gene Wilder is perfect as the heir to the Frankenstein legacy, and his comic timing has never been better.
I:9836;1077;Marty Feldman is pure magic in his role as Eyegor, the bug.
I:9836;1078;eyed assistant who is lecherous, witty and morose all at the same time.

I:9836;1081;"Cloris Leachman is great, but I wish she had more screen time
I:9836;1082;And of course the late Madeline Kahn also brutally underused, is magnificent as Elizabeth, whose roll in the hay with the Monster is tremendous.
I:9836;1083;but one cannot help but admit YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is one of the funniest films Brooks ever made and one of the best American comedies of our time.
I:9836;1084;One of the true classics in comedy and one of Mel Brooks best.
I:9836;1085;Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein is a remarkable film: it is a spoof of a beloved classic (the original film version of Frankenstein ) which is now a beloved classic in its own right.
I:9836;1086;Young Frankenstein takes up the family tradition with outrageously funny results.
I:9836;1087;several elements combine to make YF one of cinema's all.
I:9836;1088;time great comedies: witty dialogue, deliciously eccentric characters, hilarious sight gags ( Put.
I:9836;1089;back ), and one of the best comic ensembles ever assembled on film.
I:9836;1090;On top of that, the production design, costumes, and make.
I:9836;1091;up brilliantly evoke the classic Hollywood monster movie vibe.
I:9836;1092;And there's a great humorous song.
I:9836;1093;dance sequence for the doctor and his creation.
I:9836;1094;as funny as it is, YF is also a deeply compassionate and humanistic film.
I:9836;1095;Brooks treats his zany collection of characters with genuine affection.
I:9836;1096;Young Frankenstein ultimately has a kind.
I:9836;1097;heartedness to match both its intelligence and wit.
I:9836;1098;The movie was played strictly for laughs and it has a lot of them.
I:9836;1099;"gor"") ever changing hump on his back."
I:9836;1100;On scene it is on the left side and on another scene the right side.
I:9836;1101;Also when ever anyone says the name Frau Blcher or just Blcher, the horses goes wild.
I:9836;1102;"In one scene
I:9836;1103;A lawyer for the Frankenstein family is sent to the United States to tell Dr. Frederick Frankenstein that he has inherited his Great.
I:9836;1104;He finally make his way back to the castle where Dr. Frankenstein shows him love and compasion.
I:9836;1105;Despite the minor goofs, this is Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder at their finest.
I:9836;1106;One of Mel Brooks' most fully formed and aesthetically realized films, the comedy YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is a clever amalgamation of classic gothic horror and bawdy burlesque humor.
I:9836;1107;makes the movie as much a loving tribute to those films as a parody of them.
I:9836;1108;The script is outrageously witty yet well.
I:9836;1109;structured and literate, and Brooks' direction is more stylish and restrained than usual, enabling him to extract uniformly excellent performances from his all.
I:9836;1110;Though he at first plans to dispose of the property, discovery of his grandfather's notebooks stirs the ol' genes and leads him to reconsider.
I:9836;1111;Soon the temptation of forbidden knowledge proves too strong to resist, and Frederick.
I:9836;1112;eyed Marty Feldman), and his housekeeper Frau Blcher (a delightfully over.
I:9836;1113;under Brooks' direction, Wilder, Garr, Feldman, and Leachman make an outstanding and outrageously funny comedy ensemble.
I:9836;1114;And Peter Boyle's portrayal of the monster arguably rivals that of Karloff himself.
I:9836;1115;But an equal amount credit for YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN's success should go to the excellent supporting cast.
I:9836;1116;white cinematography, when combined with Dale Hennesy's production design and Robert De Vestel's set decoration, exquisitely recreates that classic gothic ambiance of the original films, and the haunting music from John Morris provides a perfect underscore to YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN's plot, characters, and imagery.
I:9836;1117;up created by Ed Butterworth and William Tuttle that is a breathtakingly skillful and recognizable takeoff on the original.
I:9836;1118;In many ways, Brooks and his crew deliver a film that, though a comedy, aesthetically and stylistically fits right in with Universal's 1930s horror lineup.
I:9836;1119;anamorphic widescreen version of the film, the picture is fairly crisp and reveals lots of detail not clearly visible in the previous VHS releases.
I:9836;1120;The disc also has lots of entertaining extras, including a sometimes humorous feature commentary with Brooks, outrageously funny trailers and TV and radio spots, interesting and revealing deleted scenes, and more.
I:9836;1121;This is one of Mel Brooks' better movies.
I:9836;1122;Peter Boyle as the monster and Madaline Kahn and Terry Garr as the love intersts are a great cast.
I:9836;1123;Stands good with no pryor knowledge but even better with a back round in classic horror movies.
I:9836;1124;Absolutely, hands down, one of the funniest movies of all time.
I:9836;1125;I love watching it again, and again, and again.
I:9836;1126;Even tho it is regarded as one of the best Mel movies.
I:9836;1127;it has it's moments and it did look very well done with stage, props, sets ect. and did look like a classic comedy basedon a classic thriller.
I:9836;1128;But it didnt have the comedy I hoped for.
I:9836;1129;the bonus features arnt much.
I:9836;1130;I watched it with my son when I got it.
I:9836;1131;Funny all the way thru.
I:9836;1132;This is a classic, no doubt.
I:9836;1133;It is hilarious and will keep you in stitches for most of the movie.
I:9836;1134;My Grand daughter loves this movie.
I:9836;1135;we watch it and do imitations of all the characters in the movie.
I:9836;1136;"Hilarious movie
I:9836;1137;Great comedy to add to a blu.
I:9836;1138;Gene Wilder is phenomenal in this.
I:9836;1139;it's the scariest comedy ever made.
I:9836;1140;It's packed with comedy and memorable quotes.
I:9836;1141;Here's another film where all performer's did a fantastic job.
I:9836;1142;Great script, the sets were great, the music was something else and being shot in black and white paid homage to the old Universal Horror movies.
I:9836;1143;this is the month for me to once again watch some of those great old movies that have, over the years, become staunch favorites.
I:9836;1144;"This week it was one of my favorite comedies of all time: ""Young Frankenstein."""
I:9836;1145;This is a film widely recognized as one of the funniest comedies ever produced in Hollywood.
I:9836;1146;In addition, it's also a brilliantly conceived, hilarious parody of the best and worst of all those old Frankenstein movies produced by Hollywood.
I:9836;1147;but with a wickedly funny, satirical twist.
I:9836;1148;the film is a 1 hour, 45 minute.
I:9836;1149;long series of well timed jokes .
I:9836;1150;many of them subtle, and others very broad in nature, all brought together to perfection by an ensemble cast that delivers their lines to perfection.
I:9836;1151;It's obvious that the cast had a lot of fun making this movie.
I:9836;1152;And when the cast has fun.
I:9836;1153;well, the audience is in for a real treat!!
I:9836;1154;you take the blonde and I'll take the one in the toiban!!
I:9836;1155;"If you've never seen Young Frankenstein"", it bears close watching the first time you see it."
I:9836;1156;That's because, in addition to the broad and sometimes coarse jokes, there are a lot of very subtle gags throughout the film as well.
I:9836;1157;"since its release in 1974, ""Young Frankenstein"" has become a classic."
I:9836;1158;"Folks, if you're one of those few people who haven't done so yet, you just gotta see ""Young Frankenstein"" to appreciate the wonderful humor interspersed throughout!!"
I:9836;1159;If you are a fan of Mel Brooks comedies then you will really enjoy what I consider to be his best!
I:9836;1160;it is a palpable hit!
I:9836;1161;But it is the characters brought to life by a superb cast that makes this movie a MUST for any Mel Brooks collection.
I:9836;1162;And the coffee part with the little old man is hilarious!
I:9836;1163;Good family comedy, but watch out for the more adult parts.
I:9836;1164;*hint* hint* Have fun with it!
I:9836;1165;"Hence, the title of their famous hit, ""Walk This Way""."
I:9836;1166;frankenstein was never meant to be funny, but somehow a genius like Mel Brooks turned it into a classic comedy.
I:9836;1167;Here we take the fabled tale of Dr Frankenstein creating his monster and making it a hilarious madcap adventure.
I:9836;1168;While Terri Garr would go on to play far smarter characters in her career, she was at her buxom airheaded best.
I:9836;1169;She was at her all time funniest as the vain and self centered fiancee of Gene Wilder, then to have her inner sex kitten come out thanks to Peter Boyle's monster's enormous stranstooker.
I:9836;1170;The special features are hilarious, as you hear the obvious love and affetion the crew had for this movie.
I:9836;1171;Young Frankenstein is one of the funniest movies ever made!
I:9836;1172;The features are fantastic including the production photographs, documentary, and the trailers and TV spots.
I:9836;1173;Mel Brooks won the Oscar for his first film, The Producers.
I:9836;1174;He followed this up with two moderately successful films.
I:9836;1175;this is the ultimate sequel to the classic Frankenstein film (even better than Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein.)
I:9836;1176;This leads to a great musical number (Puttin' on the Ritz).
I:9836;1177;What a perfect time for Frederick's fianc , Elizabeth (Madeline Kahn), to arrive!
I:9836;1178;And in the most intense sex scene, they make mad passionate love (six or seven times).
I:9836;1179;frederick comes up with a final solution, to transfer some his knowledge to the monster.
I:9836;1180;This is a satire and next to farce, great satire is almost impossible to make and they did it!Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks made their film debuts in The Producers and respectively, received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination and Best Original Screenplay Oscar.
I:9836;1181;It was extremely well packaged, plenty of attention to details, and it even contained a note thanking me for ordering.
I:9836;1182;i saw it on a flight from overseas to New York and felt there were some scenes that were so hilarious.
I:9836;1183;Mel Brooks delivers classic gags and laughs throughout the movie.
I:9836;1184;This movie always makes me laugh and it is good for the whole family!
I:9836;1185;It's a fun movie to see.
I:9836;1186;The grandson of Dr. Frankenstein inherits thecastle of his famous relative and goes to live there.
I:9836;1187;He is also assisted by a good looking young lady.
I:9836;1188;If you looking for an entertaining movie this is a goodchoice.
I:9836;1189;Brooks and his team of writers were at their top and really delivered the belly laughs.
I:9836;1190;This is for people that like to laugh together and understand the characters of science fiction genre.
I:9836;1191;This may just be the funniest movie of all time.
I:9836;1192;Scratch that, this is the funniest movie of all time.
I:9836;1193;"Set as a spoof of the horror film ""Frankenstein"" This film takes a completely comedic turn."
I:9836;1194;Peter Boyle as the monster is perfect.
I:9836;1195;"The cast from ""Blazing Saddles"" shows up to do quite possibly their finest work ever, I highly suggest you buckle yourself to your seat or you will fall out of your chair in hysterics during the ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" bit."
I:9836;1196;when you are down and out, young frankenstein will take you away from it and into the world of Mel Brooks.
I:9836;1197;silly, wacky, tasteless, oh yes!
I:9836;1198;The American Film Institute's 100 Years, 100 Laughs claims that this is the 13th funniest movie ever made.
I:9836;1199;The story is a great one that had the potential to be hilarious.
I:9836;1200;Young Frankstein is a classic spoof.
I:9836;1201;Mel brooks and Gene Wilder takes a horror classic and turns into a witty and sharp comedy.
I:9836;1202;strring some of the great comedians.
I:9836;1203;not to mention a great cameo by gene hackman.
I:9836;1204;This is a must for just a laugh and just to see a great comedians and a great comic director.
I:9836;1205;Young Frankenstein is delightfully funny with very understated humor.
I:9836;1206;demand so I definitely had to pick this up for my movie collection.
I:9836;1207;Many years ago this was a big hit.
I:9836;1208;and still is today with my Gtrandbabies.
I:9836;1209;they love old time movies.
I:9836;1210;This movie is a classic.
I:9836;1211;It is so much more than a simple parody of the original Frankenstein story.
I:9836;1212;A classic Mel Brooks' film.
I:9836;1213;Funny, subtle comedy lines along with visual comedy.
I:9836;1214;The actors are incredible comedians.
I:9836;1215;if you saw this as a kid, watch it as an adult.
I:9836;1216;This has to be one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
I:9836;1217;It's got more consistent laughs than any other movie.
I:9836;1218;I own a fairly decent VHS cut of this film, and of course it is in full screen.
I:9836;1219;Adding to my humor collection and this is a most include.
I:9836;1220;Gene Wilder is hilarious as are the other stars.
I:9836;1221;What a deliciously funny parody of the Frankenstein movies, it left me in stitches.
I:9836;1222;What a incredible imagination and sense of humor Mel Brooks has, he really outdid himself with this movie.
I:9836;1223;Peter Boyle really surprised me with his performance as the monster, his performance was very believable and perfect in every way.
I:9836;1224;Gene Wilder as the young doctor Frederick Frankenstein was hilarious, charming, witty and original, he fit the part so well.
I:9836;1225;It has a lot of adult humor in it, so I would not really recommend it to younger children, but other than that this great blend of humor, comedy and romance is one to be treasured and watched again and again for years to come.
I:9836;1226;Another great thing about this movie is that they used the original Frankenstein set, I loved that.
I:9836;1227;another great thing about the movie is that it had so many memorable lines such as:Inga: Hello, would you like to have a roll in the hay?
I:9836;1228;It's fun, roll, roll, roll in ze hay.
I:9836;1229;frederick: Elevate meInga: What, now right here?Frederick: Yes raise the platformInga: Oh za platform, ja yes!

I:9836;1235;It was a favorite of my husband and myself and will be a favorite of theirs also I am sure.
I:9836;1236;Surely one of Gene Wilder's funniest movie along with so many other great actors.
I:9836;1237;Mel Brooks is without question one of the great comedy masters of all time, and Young Frankenstein has him true to his incredible form.
I:9836;1238;One of the top ten must see comedy films of all time
I:9836;1239;It doesn't matter how many times I see this movie, there's always something new I seem to catch and start laughing all over again.

I:9836;1242;Madeleine Kahn (Cahn) was outstandingly funny.
I:9836;1243;hearted take on the Frankenstein movies, which movies quickly and has the added benefit of actually creating likable characters, so even if you're not captivated by every joke and pratfall you'll at least be in the presence of some enjoyable types.3/4
I:9836;1244;"The actors do an excellent job of delivering the great ""slap."
I:9836;1245;"stick"" comedy throughout the film."
I:9836;1246;The entire movie is also delivered in black and white to give it that old horror film feeling, and takes place mostly in the castle of Dr. Frankenstein.

I:9836;1248;A great, entertaining trip to Transylvania awaits you!
I:9836;1249;I love this movie, and am so glad I ordered.

I:9836;1251;"My personal favorite jokes are the ""Walk this way"" part and when his hump keeps switching sides on his back."
I:9836;1252;The deleted scenes and commentary are a little weak, but overall, this movie is absolutely hilarious for the entire family.
I:9836;1253;Fun movie for the Halloween season.
I:9836;1254;I bought this movie after reading reveiws on ebay and also reading reveiws elsewhere claming it was one of the funniest movies ever.
I:9836;1255;Itmay be funny to Frankenstein fans, but being born it the 80's, I have never seen a classic frankenstein movie.
I:9836;1256;I've loved this movie ever since it came out.
I:9836;1257;mel Brooks is a comedic genius.
I:9836;1258;just thinking of this movie brings a huge chuckle.
I:9836;1259;except that it is the high water mark of Mel's career.
I:9836;1260;There are so many hilarious parts of this movie which is a parody of a parody (if you laugh at bits of Bride of Frankenstein the way I do), and it a classic for the number of great performances for some of the funny people to ever cross the silver screen, and are no longer with us.
I:9836;1261;It is fun to watch the documentary.
I:9836;1262;ray edition I've ever seen: coarse and grainy.
I:9836;1263;You can actually see the pixels dance around on any solid background.
I:9836;1264;stellar cast and outstanding performances as only Mel Brooks could have written and directed.
I:9836;1265;grab some popcorn and laugh!
I:9836;1266;First up is a new set of interviews with Mel and the crew giving more tidbits about the making of the movie.
I:9836;1267;He even pops into frame a few times.
I:9836;1268;I suggest you watch the movie twice: once to concentrate on the movie and another time to concentrate on Mel's comments.
I:9836;1269;One of the greatest films ever.
I:9836;1270;Better than Blazing Saddles in my book.
I:9836;1271;Some of the funniest scenes in the history of film are in this movie.
I:9836;1272;When Igor says, Walk This Way, he means it.
I:9836;1273;It's just one great scene after another.
I:9836;1274;I have seen this movie so many times I can recite pieces of the script.
I:9836;1275;liners and play on words that will keep you laughing and snickering all through the movie.
I:9836;1276;Everyone is excellent in the movie.
I:9836;1277;This is trully a classic.
I:9836;1278;Mel Brooks is a genius!
I:9836;1279;It is great to see a true american comedy in its entirety, without all of those annoying commercials.
I:9836;1280;This is a classic fun movie.
I:9836;1281;Great humor that you will need to view many times to catch all the great puns.
I:9836;1282;The script is genius, the actors all do their parts exactly as they should and comedy ensues.
I:9836;1283;The movie, a marvelous spoof, is well known to most.
I:9836;1284;Apart from the film itself, perfectly transposed to the digital medium, are many extras: included on the disc are interviews with some of the cast, a 36 minute documentary of the making of the film, and an audio commentary by director funny Mel Brooks.
I:9836;1285;The film was simultaneously an homage and a spoof.
I:9836;1286;can I give you a shine?
I:9836;1287;"Then there's the Putting On The Ritz"" number with the monster!I'm telling you, you give any jewish comedian named Mel a platform to work from, and I GUARANTEE you at least ONE comic classic!"
I:9836;1288;"The black and white cinematography is first rate and this film has been called ""."
I:9836;1289;"one of the most beautifully photographed comedies ever made!"""
I:9836;1290;so enjoy this movie, for it's the last of its kind from a director that used to DEFINE truly screwball comedies!
I:9836;1291;and is the face that launched 898 laughs.
I:9836;1292;Like Igor she adds far more to the humor than the role requires.
I:9836;1293;at its base this is a loving satire of the great black and white monster movies and especially the early Frankenstein movies.
I:9836;1294;The included Making of Young Frankenstein states that the main inspiration was Bride of Frankenstein.
I:9836;1295;What also comes through is a respect for the original intent of the Mary Shelly book.
I:9836;1296;( I love quoting from this flick).
I:9836;1297;as much as I have enjoyed watching, and re.
I:9836;1298;So an advantage of owning is you can fast forward.
I:9836;1299;in case you missed it: This is a funny movie.
I:9836;1300;Its worth many replays even if you find parts you want to skip.
I:9836;1301;If you like satire at it's best, you'll love this movie.
I:9836;1302;One of Mel Blanc's finest works.
I:9836;1303;Both the editorial and the customer reviews are so thorough that one can only list one's personal favorite scenes.
I:9836;1304;First of all, I found it very funny that Dr Frederick Frankenstein takes the TRAIN to Transylvania.
I:9836;1305;"The scene at the Bucharest Academy of Science where Frederick demonstrates the talents of the ""monster"" is a highlight among highlights, especially when the two of them start to tap dance and sing ""Putting on the Ritz."""
I:9836;1306;Finally, Frederick's wicked smile when after the wedding ceremony, Inga asks him what he received in return for giving the monster some of his precious brain fluid.
I:9836;1307;I suppose it becomes more funny if you do know the classics, but this one can stand on its own feet very well.
I:9836;1308;I reckon this must be the most hilarious movie ever made and it never fails to reward the viewer.
I:9836;1309;If you like mel brooks movies, you'll definitely enjoy this classic that is filmed in black and white.
I:9836;1310;This old relic is a hoot to watch.
I:9836;1311;Great cast and a funny movie.
I:9836;1312;Young Frankenstein is a little scary and funny.
I:9836;1313;One of the best Gene Wilder movies made that I have seen.
I:9836;1314;no matter how many times you see it, it is still so funny!
I:9836;1315;Mel Brooks gives us the greatest spoof/homage of a classic ever.
I:9836;1316;Pick it up and enjoy the laughs.
I:9836;1317;I have loved this movie since I first saw it and I still do.
I:9836;1318;If you like Mel Brooks you will like this movie.
I:9836;1319;One of my favorite gifts for over.50 folks.
I:9836;1320;Certainly one of the funniest movies of all time, if, that is, you are a fan of old movies and double entendre.
I:9836;1321;Everybody has seen it, but everybody is ready to watch for the 10th time and everybody has their favorite line.
I:9836;1322;the fact that most of it was shot in b&w. a must own for fan's of mel brook's movies!
I:9836;1323;And I'm still in love with it.
I:9836;1324;Every single joke and sight gag hits the bullseye, and each and every performance is memorable (made bittersweet by the passing of Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn and Peter Boyle over the years).
I:9836;1325;There are so many great comedy bits crammed into this movie that it's almost futile to make a list here, so I'll spare you the reading.
I:9836;1326;Guess I would have been in high school at the time and I remember liking it a lot more then than I did this time around.
I:9836;1327;Mel Brook's funniest movie, and one of the best comedies of all time.
I:9836;1328;Highly quotable, often hysterical, Mel at his genius best.
I:9836;1329;one of the all time classics.
I:9836;1330;It was great to watch and have the memories come flooding back!
I:9836;1331;There are just so many humour highlights in this movie.
I:9836;1332;I will keep this in my Classics library.
I:9836;1333;I share it with everyone who hasn't seen it.
I:9836;1334;She let me, and let me tell you something: it's not the kind of movie that would make most people BURST out laughing right away .
I:9836;1335;it's more of that subltle type humor.
I:9836;1336;If you tune into that, boy is it hilarious!
I:9836;1337;Though there's some 'adult humor' I could definitely do without, overall the movie tickles me.
I:9836;1338;A classic movie for a classic price!
I:9836;1339;I bought this to share with a pre.
I:9836;1340;Then one day he is notified that he has inherited his great.
I:9836;1341;FRANKENSTEIN!On his own, Mel Brooks is usually good, even great, but when he teams up with Gene Wilder it becomes something extra.
I:9836;1342;But the directness with which Brooks approaches this material, combined with Wilders understated performance makes this their all.
I:9836;1343;They co. wrote the screenplay, and with their differing perspectives of comedy they managed to capture the best of both worlds and strike a balance that works to perfection here.
I:9836;1344;Brooks hits you over the head and gets right in your face with a gag, but Wilder steps aside, grabs it by the tail and hits the pause button (so.
I:9836;1345;The screenplay is clever and includes all of the elements that successfully evoke the essence of the old B W horror films that are such a part of cinematic lore today.
I:9836;1346;What they give you with this film is the Frankenstein story with contemporary sensibilities, while presenting a cast of characters that take it over the top.
I:9836;1347;just before he delivers a line.
I:9836;1348;that can make even a mediocre line hilarious.
I:9836;1349;His subtle approach and staid countenance play this material perfectly, and complimented by Brooks straight ahead direction it allows the humor to flow naturally and freely and never fails to get the right kind of laugh at just the right time.
I:9836;1350;The way they capture the sense of the original Frankenstein (and the many sequels) is uncanny, from the overall look of the film to the reactions by everyone at the mere mention of the monster, to the throng of anxious villagers led by the unfaltering and inarticulate Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars).
I:9836;1351;besides Wilder, who is clearly the star of the show, the supporting performances turned in by this superlative ensemble cast are absolutely impeccable, beginning with Peter Boyle as the monster.
I:9836;1352;Boyle has the gait and the growl down pat, but also conveys so much with his expressions and introspective comportment.
I:9836;1353;eyed portrayal of the little hunchback who refuses to acknowledge his hump (mainly because he doesnt realize he actually has one) is hilarious.
I:9836;1354;Teri Garr is a joy to behold as Inga, Fredericks lab assistant, and Cloris Leachman practically steals the show as Frau Blucher (and dont say her name within earshot of the horses).
I:9836;1355;Mars also creates a memorable character by putting a mumble and a wooden arm to especially riotous use, and last but not least is the wonderful Madeline Kahn as Elizabeth, Fredericks intended who ultimately finds something grand to sing about.
I:9836;1356;And without question, Young Frankenstein delivers on a level to which few films of this nature can even aspire.
I:9836;1357;and with a definitive performance by Gene Wilder, this parody takes a place among the all time greats in the history of the cinema.
I:9836;1358;Its funny stuff that gets funnier every time you see it, and thats the true magic of the movies.
I:9836;1359;You will laugh all thru this movie.
I:9836;1360;Patton, The Professionals, Casino Royale are just a few of the really strong transfers to BR.
I:9836;1361;And if you can adjust the color 'feel' of your movies ( cool,normal,warm ) make the setting 'cool'.
I:9836;1362;The best part is movies like YF really benefit from the Blu.
I:9836;1363;ray transfer process because detail is improved ( apart from the grain problem, of course ) but the sound .
I:9836;1364;is much clearer and now adds to the experience in a much more profound way.
I:9836;1365;ray truly is the medium of the future for viewing great movies.
I:9836;1366;ray version has a cleaner sound track and slightly enhanced video resolution.
I:9836;1367;In every pastor, priest or rabbi is one great sermon, in every writer one great book, in every film maker one truly great film.
I:9836;1368;Young Frankenstein is Mel Brooks' finest work, with flawless writing, direction and acting from all involved.
I:9836;1369;Guaranteed laughs from the master of comedy!
I:9836;1370;Can I give you a shine?
I:9836;1371;This film is best enjoyed with a room full of friends or family.
I:9836;1372;Invite everyone over and share the good lines as you enjoy the movie together!
I:9836;1373;A timeless classic that belongs in every video library.
I:9836;1374;I enjoyed the movie every time I watch it.
I:9836;1375;A great cast of actors.
I:9836;1376;You will laugh your head off!!
I:9836;1377;possibly the most hilarious movie of all time.
I:9836;1378;Outstanding performances by a highly talented group of comics.
I:9836;1379;"Mel Brooks and his team of writers keep doing it over and over
I:9836;1380;The scene with Gene Hackman and Peter Boyle is an extraordinary piece of work
I:9836;1381;Another great Mel Brooks movie.
I:9836;1382;Lots of schtick and subtle jokes, but plenty of good writing and good comedy.
I:9836;1383;He pokes fun at the old horror movies while paying homage to the great ones at the same time.
I:9836;1384;great movie to watch for halloween , gene wilder was great .
I:9836;1385;very good price for movie.
I:9836;1386;This movie is quite good, every bit as good as when I first saw it.
I:9836;1387;Either way, still a good movie with great actors.
I:9836;1388;I love this classic scary/funny movie.
I:9836;1389;It would be fun to show during a Halloween party, especially, for guests who may wish to take a break and just have some good laughs!
I:9836;1390;This movie is fun for nearly all ages, except the very young.
I:9836;1391;Young Frankenstein is superb all the way around.
I:9836;1392;(It probably helps that I had a recent re.
I:9836;1393;The rest of the movie is half homage to James Whale's original and half screwball comedy.
I:9836;1394;"the real strength of this movie is the cast
I:9836;1395;best form of darned close to it here.
I:9836;1396;"All are actors with impeccable comic timing (yes, even Gene Hackman), and it often seems as if Brooks just said ""okay, do whatever it is you were planning to do, then put it way over the top."""
I:9836;1397;"The result is in no way a sophisticated comedy
I:9836;1398;liners and great sight gags.
I:9836;1399;revoiting song and dance act.
I:9836;1400;This was a great Mel Brooks / Gene Wilder film.
I:9836;1401;Great spoof on the old Frankenstein movies .
I:9836;1402;they were spot on to do it in black and white.
I:9836;1403;I think this and Blazing Saddles were his two best films.
I:9836;1404;it is pretty funny but not as great as the other two.
I:9836;1405;the movie is a comedy classic.
I:9836;1406;the performers were all class a actors number 1 in their fields of comedy.
I:9836;1407;i highly recommend this classic.
I:9836;1408;YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN could well be the finest comic parody of a serious film ever made.
I:9836;1409;"Of course, being Mel Brooks, he made more than his fair share of additions to the script, including many of the jokes, such as the famous Gene Wilder line ""What great knockers!"""
I:9836;1410;the film is such a successful collaboration that the film represents the career highpoint or close to it for several of the principals in the film.
I:9836;1411;Although BLAZING SADDLES has to go down as Brooks's career peak since he wrote, directed, and acted in it, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is his next greatest film.
I:9836;1412;Though we know the late, great Peter Boyle for other roles (such as his great Emmy.
I:9836;1413;"winning performance on THE X. fILES' episode ""Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose""), this had to be his finest hour."
I:9836;1414;Teri Garr is one of my favorite actresses, but this is always been her best role in my opinion (it is also the role that changed her from primarily a TV guest actress to a movie actress).
I:9836;1415;Though Cloris Leachman has had an amazingly diverse and varied career, this is easily one of her most memorable roles.
I:9836;1416;His presence is welcome all the same.
I:9836;1417;In short, it is a film that made everyone in the project look very good indeed.
I:9836;1418;One additional actor I would like to mention is Richard Haydn, a great veteran Hollywood character actor.
I:9836;1419;What is remarkable is that they work as well today as they did in 1974 when the film first came out.
I:9836;1420;The film has as many truly funny moments as any you could hope to see.
I:9836;1421;But the jokes can obscure what a slick production it is.
I:9836;1422;Most people know that they used much of the equipment used in the original James Whale films, but even when they using completely original items the film does a masterful job of imitating the look of the old Universal projects.
I:9836;1423;in short, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is almost certainly assured of permanent status as a great comedy classic.
I:9836;1424;I would love to see a definitive edition, with greatly expanded extras, better commentaries, interviews with the surviving cast members, and perhaps a documentary or two.
I:9836;1425;But even if this is the best we will ever get, this is definitely one of the classic comic films.
I:9836;1426;Seeing it and The Producers (1968) again recently, I was reminded of the fact that Brooks' best comedies are those in which he does not appear.
I:9836;1427;The ensemble cast of Brooks regulars (Boyle, Kahn, Leachman, Mars, and Wilder) are all outstanding, joined by Marty Feldman, Terri Garr, and a surprisingly effective Gene Hackman as the Blind Hermit.
I:9836;1428;In only a few other films has Hackman's gift for comedy been utilized.
I:9836;1429;the flow of the narrative as is sometimes the case in his other comedies.
I:9836;1430;Although it may be difficult to believe, there is great dignity in this film which never serves as a target for ridicule.
I:9836;1431;such as it is helps to advance the plot.
I:9836;1432;for these and other reasons, this is my favorite Brooks comedy.
I:9836;1433;This movie holds a 98% Fresh onRotten Tomatoes, thus it is a cult classic.
I:9836;1434;I *highly* recommend you get this film and watch it, you willnot be sorry if you get this Movie!
I:9836;1435;This is by far the best Mel Brooks feature ever made.
I:9836;1436;I grew a deep appreciation for Marty Feldman after seeing this movie the first time when I was a kid!
I:9836;1437;As for this one, what more can be said of genius.
I:9836;1438;While my wife's favorite Mel Brooks film is `Spaceballs,' I'll stick with this one!
I:9836;1439;Here is a funny twist to an old story written back in the1850's by Mary Shelly.
I:9836;1440;This is a real classic, and it stands on its own, although it pairs up nicely with Bride of Frankenstein on a stormy night.
I:9836;1441;This HAS to be a classic.
I:9836;1442;yes, even better than Airplane , and quite possibly the funniest film of all time, period.
I:9836;1443;splittingly funny and infinitely quotable, this is film is absolutely priceless.
I:9836;1444;Filmed in black and white, the movie is filled with atmosphere, fantastic one.
I:9836;1445;be able to look at Peter Boyle the same way again after seeing his portrayal of the monster (especially after viewing Puttin' on the Ritz ).
I:9836;1446;The fantastic script, by both Brooks and star Gene ( it's pronounced Fronkensteen ) Wilder, was nominated for an Oscar, and so fantastic are the lines that you will find yourself using them in every.
I:9836;1447;day life (I have and still do).
I:9836;1448;This movie will make you giggle, chuckle and laugh out loud.
I:9836;1449;It's the blueprint for all parody films ever made and it's still the very best.
I:9836;1450;I love the tip of the cap to The Bride of Frankenstein near the end of the film and especially love Kenneth Mars' portrayal of the heavily accented town Constable ( Footschteps, footschteps, footschteps! )
I:9836;1451;And Bluecher in German means glue .
I:9836;1452;This movie is a classic and should be enjoyed for years.
I:9836;1453;fore me it`s a series of chuckle moments thrue the whole movie, with big funny moments here and there.
I:9836;1454;this is a comedy that`s allmost perfect in every way and I recomend this to ennyone that`s seen a Mel Brooks movie and liked it.
I:9836;1455;A classic in the Mel Brooks genre.
I:9836;1456;I have several of his movies and enjoy them all.
I:9836;1457;This movie is as funny as The Producers (1968), also by Mel Brooks .
I:9836;1458;and that makes it hilarious.
I:9836;1459;We received it in great condition
I:9836;1460;This is pure comedy and satire.
I:9836;1461;You need to pay attention, the double entendre' and sly humor are well worth the effort
I:9836;1462;actually, the Mel Brooks commentary is great.
I:9836;1463;It's interesting to listen to him as a director, and not a zany comedian.
I:9836;1464;It gives an insight into this aspect of his personality, and is worth listening to.
I:9836;1465;the outtakes are somewhat amusing.
I:9836;1466;I guess it's nice to have .
I:9836;1467;the movie is a classic, however.
I:9836;1468;And worth owning and watching multiple times.
I:9836;1469;I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the spoof genre of movies (most of Mel Brooks films are spoofs).
I:9836;1470;One of the funniest films in the history of the world (another one), the Blu.
I:9836;1471;For fans of Horror and Comedy no other movie pays more homage to both genres.
I:9836;1472;Mel Brooks hilarious spoof of Frankenstein is undoubtedly one of the funniest films ever made.
I:9836;1473;With everything from sight gags to overt sexual innuendo (both Brooks trademarks) this comedy will have you gasping for breath.
I:9836;1474;I know this is one of my favorite comedies, as well as one of my favorite movies.
I:9836;1475;A slightly weird movie, but I highly recommend this to anybody who likes a good laugh.
I:9836;1476;Peter Boyle as the monster, with Teri Gere and Madeline Kahn all put in stellar performances.
I:9836;1477;"Less well known charecter ""Inspector Kemp"" adds to the hilarious dialogue."
I:9836;1478;A true classic I've always loved.
I:9836;1479;It brings many hours of family entertainment and is watch frequently and really loved
I:9836;1480;this has to be one of the funniest scenes in cinema history .
I:9836;1481;it makes me cry with laughter every time i see it.
I:9836;1482;that mel brooks is so clever.young frankenstein is a wonderful movie: funny, smart, and subtle (yes, subtle .
I:9836;1483;absolutely deserving of all the kudos it has received, this is a masterpiece.
I:9836;1484;This is one of the funniest movies of all time.
I:9836;1485;A classic to watch on Halloween for a satirical view of the old Halloween classics.
I:9836;1486;One of Mel Brooks' best efforts, beautifully remastered on Blu.
I:9836;1487;Looks and sounds great, with a few really good extras included.
I:9836;1488;i hope you make it in time!
I:9836;1489;"Non stop gags
I:9836;1490;"This is so funny it can make you sick from laughing
I:9836;1491;Feldman, Wilder and Cloris Leachman are wonderful in this, and it was shot, appropriately, in black and white.
I:9836;1492;"up all over his face
I:9836;1493;the sets were fantastic, and it was a thrill to be allowed to see them all.
I:9836;1494;Great stuff and a very funny movie.
I:9836;1495;Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks are comic geniuses each with a better understanding of timing than a tap dancer.
I:9836;1496;When on vacation and it's time to wind down prior to falling asleep, this is a great movie to through in and have a bunch of adult laughs.
I:9836;1497;Gene Wilder is the perfect fit for his role in this movie.
I:9836;1498;It's funny and very well put together.
I:9836;1499;I really enjoy this movie.
I:9836;1500;It is very funny and not scary at all.
I:9836;1501;This is a timeless movie that will make anyone laugh and repeat some classic lines from the movie.
I:9836;1502;Mel Brooks at his best, when he directed this film.
I:9836;1503;Very, very funny, and a wonderful cast!
I:9836;1504;see around Halloween, to get you in the mood.
I:9836;1505;and brew, its a recipe for a perfect Halloween.
I:9836;1506;Mel Brooks masterpiece and the greatest parody of all times.
I:9836;1507;Although 'Blazing Saddles' is better remembered and 'The Producers' more critically acclaimed (Mel Brooks won an Oscar for the screenplay), Young Frankenstein is the best and the funniest film he has ever made.
I:9836;1508;Its a wonderful comedic homage to the original James Whale films made back in the 1930's.
I:9836;1509;The original sets were recreated, in the same location, and the film is shot in black and white which brings back happy memories of Bride of Frankenstein (itself a black comedy).
I:9836;1510;Effortlessly funny, and here right from his opening scene, at a teaching Hospital he's brilliant.
I:9836;1511;Wilder does it with brilliant comic timing.
I:9836;1512;The rest of the cast are nearly as good with Cloris Leachman and Peter Boyle both giving marvellous performances.
I:9836;1513;gene Wilder also gets writing credits with Brooks as well and between them they produced a great script with a stream a great one.
I:9836;1514;Its both informative and funny.
I:9836;1515;Overall this is a superb disc and a film that should be in everybodies collection.
I:9836;1516;In my opinion, this is the best of the Mel Brooks movies.
I:9836;1517;It strikes just the right balance between funny enough and too silly.
I:9836;1518;Young Frankenstein tilts toward funny and away from silly.
I:9836;1519;Mel Brooks movies also contain a generous helping of Jewish (or Yiddish) humor, so if you aren't from some place with a Jewish/Yiddish history, again, much of the humor will be lost on you.
I:9836;1520;This movie was seen by many of the Baby Boomer generation while they were growing up, and so it contains a lot of pop culture references for Boomers.
I:9836;1521;to summarize, a funny movie and a source of pop culture references.
I:9836;1522;Igor, bring the bags You take the blonde, and I'll bring the one in the turban!
I:9836;1523;One of Mel Brook's best and most quoted films.
I:9836;1524;I once had the VHS it broke so I got this.
I:9836;1525;It's still fun to watch.
I:9836;1526;Everyone knows the story of Frankenstein, but this one adds a comic twist.
I:9836;1527;From stealing the bodies, to meeting the local town constable, to stealing the brain.
I:9836;1528;Ha!Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman are great!This is a good one to just have around.
I:9836;1529;You can take it out and show it to people and everyone starts laughing and smiling.
I:9836;1530;This is one of the best comedies ever made.
I:9836;1531;And they added a lot of really impressive extras.
I:9836;1532;He's on the audio track.
I:9836;1533;He steals every scene he's in.
I:9836;1534;The rest of the cast is very funny, including Cloris Leachman's deadpan delivery and Kenneth Mars twisting his fake arm around.
I:9836;1535;There are even a few poignant moments that work surprisingly well, like the monster's speech about the gift of life.
I:9836;1536;the best thing about it is the way Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder combine acting silly and playing it straight .
I:9836;1537;Like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, authenticity somehow makes the whole movie even funnier.
I:9836;1538;I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
I:9836;1539;If you've seen it, you'll want this special edition.
I:9836;1540;If you haven't, you're in for a treat.
I:9836;1541;I bought this because I love this movie and think it is very funny.
I:9836;1542;the condition was great, as it was brand new.
I:9836;1543;Perfect silly genius and not too long.
I:9836;1544;This is a classic comedy that I've watched over and over through the years.
I:9836;1545;They're characterizations are so hilarious.
I:9836;1546;If you're looking for a first rate comedy, this one is worth your time.
I:9836;1547;"+++++This is director Mel Brooks' hilarious tribute to Mary Shelley's classic novel entitled ""Frankenstein"" (first published 1818) and pokes fun at just about every Frankenstein movie ever made (especially the original 1931 classic)."
I:9836;1548;The documentary is very good with some very funny outtakes.
I:9836;1549;There are also some excellent deleted scenes too.
I:9836;1550;A whole series of scenes that made Gene Wilder's and Terry Garr's 'intellectual discussions' a running gag that definitely should have been left in, they are hilarious.
I:9836;1551;The documentary has more and you get the feeling that a whole film could be made from just the outtakes.
I:9836;1552;The commentary by Brooks in very good, he adds bits about the scenes, actors and other trivia that is enlightening.
I:9836;1553;By far the funniest of Mel Brooks' movies.
I:9836;1554;And you'll see some quirky things.
I:9836;1555;There is some slapstick, but it is the wit that carries this one.
I:9836;1556;Kenneth Mars is the true unsung hero here.
I:9836;1557;I break out laughing everytime i watch the town meeting scene in which we are introduced to him.
I:9836;1558;Peter Boyle is hilarious without having to say a word though out most of the movie, check out his eye movements.
I:9836;1559;Love this movie, its a classic.
I:9836;1560;Now that I have it I havent even touched it, its still in the box.
I:9836;1561;great movie to have to initiate those who havent seen mel brooks.
I:9836;1562;YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is Mel Brooks' indisputable masterpiece .
I:9836;1563;exquisitely mounted, perfectly cast, flawless in nearly every detail, a pure delight from beginning to end.
I:9836;1564;Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein is not only a loving tribute to James Whale's original Frankenstein films, but a wildly entertaining spoof that still generates laughs years after its original release.
I:9836;1565;This is Brooks in his prime and that is indeed a wonderful sight to behold.
I:9836;1566;Soon, the monster is roaming the countryside and finding itself in one hilarious situation after another until Frederick catches up with him and promptly puts his tap.
I:9836;1567;dancing talents to good use.
I:9836;1568;Wilder and Boyle are pitch perfect as the doctor and his creation and the supporting cast of Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, Terri Garr, Cloris Leachman, and Gene Hackman all shine.
I:9836;1569;with the help of some of the original props .
I:9836;1570;One of the funniest movies of all time.
I:9836;1571;This ia a true classic.
I:9836;1572;Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder are a great comedic team !
I:9836;1573;I have watched this movie over the years dozens of times and laugh with tears each time.
I:9836;1574;It is just a masterpiece of fun and they must have had so many out takes with all the silliness.
I:9836;1575;what a great cast of actors, thank yo Mel Brooks for such a masterpiece!
I:9836;1576;This has got to make you laugh.
I:9836;1577;Great lines for a fun evening of entertainment.
I:9836;1578;we also like this movie its a classic and fun for the whole family to watch.
I:9836;1579;I have seen this movie about ten years ago, still I think this is the best clasical comedy I've ever seen.
I:9836;1580;This film will not bored you even you see it again and again.
I:9836;1581;Since I saw this film , I'm beeing the great fans of Mel Brook.
I:9836;1582;i have loved this movie since it has come out in the movies and it is a cherished treasure which i am so happy to own
I:9836;1583;I love this movie, yes, it's cheesy!
I:9836;1584;mel Brooks movies are hilarious!
I:9836;1585;Young Frankenstein captures all the hilarious, and at times irreverant comedy that Mel Brooks is so well.
I:9836;1586;A hilarious comedy (with a few extra laughs if you understand German), this will easily become one of your very favorites.
I:9836;1587;The finest of Gene Wilder and the best of Mel Brooks, Young Frankenstein is a must.
I:9836;1588;This is a super hilarious movie.
I:9836;1589;The actors are great in their roles and it puts such a funny twist on the original movie
I:9836;1590;It is a great spoof of the orginial monster movies of the 40s/50s.
I:9836;1591;A descent into madness is more like a wild romp in the woods.
I:9836;1592;I recommend this movie if you need a laugh.
I:9836;1593;It is great Halloween season movie.
I:9836;1594;It's a good movie, what else is there to say.
I:9836;1595;Gene Wilder is exceptional as the heir to the Frankenstein legacy (see The Producers and Blazing Saddles for other perfect performances).
I:9836;1596;This was really the best film Mel Brooks directed (again, you have to see Producers and Blazing Saddles) until he did History of the World Part One (you know there was no Part Two).
I:9836;1597;Gene Hackman has a cameo role that will absolutely slay you (`I was going to make espresso!')
I:9836;1598;This movie is a great spoof on the horror/Frankenstein films.
I:9836;1599;Kenneth Mars is hilarious as the suspicious town authority.
I:9836;1600;And Teri Garr does the perfect brainless yet easy lab assitant.
I:9836;1601;This film was shot in balck and white to pay hommage to the horror genre it spoofs.
I:9836;1602;Any film after this, attempting to make The Monster funny, will always be held against Young Frankenstein.
I:9836;1603;This movie is of course, a venerable classic and is most certainly my personal favorite.
I:9836;1604;"Some shots are very clear however, which leads me to believe the source material is capable of producing a very clear and crisp version
I:9836;1605;Mel Brooks has done some very funny and halarious movies but Young Frankenstien has to be one of the all time best.
I:9836;1606;Young Frankenstien is a True All.
I:9836;1607;Brooks' films are all so outrageously funny it's hard to rate them in order.
I:9836;1608;wilder is wonderful, Garr is Great, Kahn is Kooky, Feldman is Fabulous and Peter Boyle gives the performance of his career as the Monster.
I:9836;1609;Even though my favorite Gene Wilder movie is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, his performance in this film is much, much funnier.
I:9836;1610;the Putting on the Ritz perfomance is pretty good too.
I:9836;1611;In science we must learn to accept our successes as well as our failures, with quiet dignity and grace.
I:9836;1612;Also, I like Mel Brooks, Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman and Teri Garr so this movie is one of my favorites.
I:9836;1613;It was definitely worth it.
I:9836;1614;The other reviews have summarized this film's qualities quite well, so I won't repeat them.
I:9836;1615;I've watched it so many times that I know the entire script by heart, and I still laugh every time I see it.
I:9836;1616;I recommend this film unconditionally.
I:9836;1617;This is probably Mel Brooks best movie.
I:9836;1618;This movie is purely hysterical.
I:9836;1619;If you read Mary Shelley's novel, see the Boris Karloff versions of Frankenstein and the Bride of Frankenstein, you will see the real genius behind the lunacy in Young Frankenstein.
I:9836;1620;I love this movie for the fact of it's antiquity feel and to watch it on Holloween,when it's the best time to watch movies like these.
I:9836;1621;Great if you like watching 3/4 of a movie.
I:9836;1622;If you're a fan of classic horror, this is a good one to have.
I:9836;1623;It's so quotable and yet still hilarious!
I:9836;1624;This is a Mel Brooks gem.
I:9836;1625;I must say I find myself constantly drawn to comedy .
I:9836;1626;especially these days of oppression from our own government!
I:9836;1627;I find solace in humor .
I:9836;1628;Gene Wilder delivers one of his most moving roles as the mad doctor.
I:9836;1629;The other actors and actresses do a fantastic job.
I:9836;1630;the score to this is brilliant!
I:9836;1631;The way they used black and white as an artistic decision is moving .
I:9836;1632;I think Mel Brooks says it in the commentary, but the is one of the things that makes this work and it simply wouldn't be the same without it!Bravissimo!
I:9836;1633;One of the best films of the 20th Century!!!
I:9836;1634;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
I:9836;1635;It's so silly and makes me laugh no matter how many times I see it.
I:9836;1636;I love a good Amazon sale.
I:9836;1637;Young Frankenstein is easily one of the funniest films ever made.
I:9836;1638;From a career that includes some of the best comedies ever made, this is the film for which Mel Brooks will be most fondly remembered.
I:9836;1639;It spoofs Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein perfectly.
I:9836;1640;It is so funny that I garantee you'll wet your pants.
I:9836;1641;If you love this movie,you'll enjoy this Blu.
I:9836;1642;glad to see this classic on Blu.
I:9836;1643;If you have not seen this movie, you are depriving yourself of one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:9836;1644;The newest member of the Frankenstein family goes home and makes a sort.
I:9836;1645;But love conquers all, along with a blood transfusion, and the creature does become a man.
I:9836;1646;This outline leaves out the details because, well, the details are what make this film into one of the best movies ever made.
I:9836;1647;Do I recommend this move?
I:9836;1648;This movie is rich with visual puns and images that spoof the classic silent films.
I:9836;1649;Riddled with verbal puns and risque innuendos, it is a riot.
I:9836;1650;you start to laugh at the beginning and are still laughting when it is over and you will watch it again and again.
I:9836;1651;This is, in my opinion, the best Mel Brooks movie he has made.
I:9836;1652;I know many consider Blazing Saddles better, and it is good, however, I consider Young Frankenstein to be the better of the two and probably his best movie ever!
I:9836;1653;I enjoyed this movie but it could have been better.
I:9836;1654;Also it was a bit slow at times but other than that, it is still a funny film and deserves good recognition.
I:9836;1655;If you like films such as this one or even spoofs of the old horror classics, then watch this movie as it will be good entertainment for about 106 minutes.
I:9836;1656;Yes, it's in black and white and many years old, but this is a classically hilarious comedy.
I:9836;1657;If you love word jokes and visual puns, as I do, it is also wonderful.
I:9836;1658;"In his ultimate genius bungling, he comes back with a brain from ""Abby somebody"", which leads to problems with the perfect monster, as one can imagine it would."
I:9836;1659;the movie a wacky, fun lunatic take on a classic.
I:9836;1660;and see it again if they have!
I:9836;1661;this is defintely one of the funnies movies of all time and by far mel brooks' best!
I:9836;1662;I saw Young Frankenstein a long time ago, and thought it was really funny.
I:9836;1663;After having seen these classics, I can truly appreciate all of the jokes in Young Frankenstein, as well as see what a totally LOVING tribute this movie of Mel's is to the first three Frankenstein classics.
I:9836;1664;"dink which I just discovered tonight regards Madeline Kahn's singing of ""Oh sweet mystery of life at last I've found you."""
I:9836;1665;It becames crystal clear what a brilliant film Young F. is.
I:9836;1666;"And, for shear Mel Brooks wackiness that has nothing to do with any of the three Frankenstein movies, you've gotta love the ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" scene."
I:9836;1667;Young F. has got to be Mel Brooks at the top of his game!
I:9836;1668;It was as described and worked great.
I:9836;1669;This is my favorite comedy movie and maybe my favorite movie all around!!
I:9836;1670;It's well acted, interesting, and down right funny!!
I:9836;1671;I HIGHLY recommend this movie.
I:9836;1672;Watched this as a teen and just rewatched it with my 15 y/o son who has my sense of humor.
I:9836;1673;One of the funny movies that does not rely on graphics or extreme violence.
I:9836;1674;This is a really funny film.
I:9836;1675;this is a great movie for the whole family.
I:9836;1676;great laughs will come from this great film.
I:9836;1677;This is a great movie.
I:9836;1678;And this is one of his funniest movies!
I:9836;1679;I loved loved loved this movie!
I:9836;1680;It was hilarious beyond belief.
I:9836;1681;Maybe not suitable for all ages with it's innuendoes but it is so so so funny.
I:9836;1682;This movie is a classic!
I:9836;1683;Great writing, incredible cast, wonderful acting.
I:9836;1684;but this one is like having a private screening of the movie with Brooks himself.
I:9836;1685;I call this a comedy not a horror movie, but it is a tribute to the old horror flicks of the forties and fifties.
I:9836;1686;This is always on any list of top 50 comedy movies of all time.
I:9836;1687;lighting, transitions, editing reflect the old movies, but they are expertly done.
I:9836;1688;The acting is great .
I:9836;1689;This movie is a great classic comedy.
I:9836;1690;I think it is one of the best spoofs of all time!
I:9836;1691;This is one of the funniest comedies of all times.
I:9836;1692;Every time I watch it I laugh even harder as I have discovered more funny scenes.
I:9836;1693;Mel Brooks' tribute to the Frankenstein movies of the 40s is done with such love, such skill, and such side.
I:9836;1694;floor hilarity, that it has rightfully become a comedy classic.
I:9836;1695;grandfather's nefarious footsteps, to the nurse, a naif with enormous.
I:9836;1696;The cast is beyond superb.
I:9836;1697;, and a very young, beautiful, and buxom Teri Garr plays the nurse.
I:9836;1698;assistant to the good doctor.
I:9836;1699;Then there is the marvelous Madeline Kahn, who gave a bravura performance as the doctor's fiancee.
I:9836;1700;The late comedienne's burst into operatic ecstasy during her rape by the monster is simply inspired, and is one of the comedic high points of the entire film.
I:9836;1701;"All of Kahn's considerable talents came into play during this movie
I:9836;1702;"View it alone, view it with a group of friends (all of whom will have their favorite ""movie moments""), view it with your children."
I:9836;1703;But by all means, do view it!
I:9836;1704;I will recommend your company to my friends.
I:9836;1705;It is excellent from beginning to end.
I:9836;1706;It is funny and it has an excellent story.
I:9836;1707;qkWithout question, Young Frankenstein is the VERY funniest movie EVER made.
I:9836;1708;i burst into laughter just thinking about it.
I:9836;1709;It's Mel Brooks' finest (okay, maybe a tie with Blazing Saddles), as well as Gene Wilder's, Marty Feldman's, Peter Boyle's, Madeline Kahn's, Cloris Leachman's, and perhaps even Gene Hackman's.
I:9836;1710;The actors in it are pitch perfect in their comedic timing and the dialogue is wickedly funny.
I:9836;1711;But thank god Amazon had it.
I:9836;1712;ray transfers, as they're generally excellent.
I:9836;1713;This one has me wondering.
I:9836;1714;that's what the scenes in the supplemental material look like!
I:9836;1715;They do not have a color cast, and they have the beautiful gradation of a classic film.
I:9836;1716;"i feel about ""Young Frankenstein"" much as I feel about ""Superman II""."
I:9836;1717;TV cuts often omit it, because it offends some people.
I:9836;1718;"most people consider ""Young Frankenstein"" a classic."
I:9836;1719;The one thing that is unquestionably classic is Madeline Kahn's performance.
I:9836;1720;It goes beyond perfection, if such a thing were possible.
I:9836;1721;"South Park and ""The Venture Bros."" are much better at it, mostly because they go for the jugular."
I:9836;1722;I consider Young Frankenstein to be another great classic.
I:9836;1723;i still get a bellly laugh at scenes, and, love the music in there.
I:9836;1724;Truly a classic at some of comedie's best.
I:9836;1725;this is definitely A two thumbs up movie, it's A classic and should be part of any video collection I promise you won't be dissaponted
I:9836;1726;many great actors and actresses in this classic.
I:9836;1727;continues to of enjoyable laughters at this interpretation of Frankenstein.
I:9836;1728;wonderful directing, script, and acting.
I:9836;1729;should be very special to the 55+.
I:9836;1730;Young Frankenstein is the best.
I:9836;1731;Just full of hilarious situations and one.
I:9836;1732;Young Frankenstein is the most consistently funny and inspired of Mel Brooks's comedies.
I:9836;1733;The cast have a riot with a great script.
I:9836;1734;Look out for Gene Hackman's irresistibly funny cameo, too.
I:9836;1735;the expressionistic shades and eerie tones of Gerald Hirschfield's lighting and photography capture perfectly the mood of the Universal series, and Wilder and Brooks's screenplay draws wittily from every aspect of the original films.
I:9836;1736;this edition comes with a documentary and Mel Brooks commentary that will only enhance your appreciation of the film.
I:9836;1737;He travels to Transalvania and meets up with his assistant, Igor.
I:9836;1738;They did a good job with the re.
