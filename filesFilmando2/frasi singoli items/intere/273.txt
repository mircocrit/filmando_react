I:13534;1;It's all pretty watchable, nonetheless.
I:13534;2;Woody Allen's 'Match Point' makes all the right moves.
I:13534;3;tennis champion, Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rys Meyers), reflects that it is better to be lucky than it is to be good.
I:13534;4;'Match Point' is always absorbing and presents its story in a unique way that all but guarantees it will please the audience.
I:13534;5;Awkwardly, the two consummate their longings, and from there complications naturally develop because of his two love interests.
I:13534;6;He loves his fiance, Chloe, but has a passionate desire for Nola.
I:13534;7;Chloe's family provides the trappings of wealth Chris also desires, and it seems all but likely that Tom, his future brother.
I:13534;8;Chloe is obsessed with having children and their ability to conceive creates great tension.
I:13534;9;guard and without proper prevention.
I:13534;10;To elaborate would spoil the fun, and, indeed, there is much to love about the development of this fine movie.
I:13534;11;'Match Point' has all the greatness of genuine acting and masterful direction.
I:13534;12;The details are effective and the relationships unfold in an intriguing fashion.
I:13534;13;There is a subjective comparison to make: Some of the movie reminds one of 'Closer,' but 'Match Point' is so unique that any comparisons to another movie are unfair.
I:13534;14;'Match Point' is a superb creation that scores points for expert form and execution.
I:13534;15;I watched it with a group of friends and we had a good laugh at the unrealistic dialogue that seems to come from Jane Austen's time.
I:13534;16;It's possible he was floundering with the terrible script, but some of the other actors managed well enough.
I:13534;17;What a tangled web of secrets and lies that we weave, at least one would think so after watching this beautifully acted movie.
I:13534;18;"relying on several crucial characters, some great London locations and precise storytelling, without a shot or line of dialogue wasted, Allen has created a perfect chamber piece, an intense and elegant look at sexual infidelity, and the price one ultimately pays for having deceptively good or even bad luck
I:13534;19;how much is one willing to give up one's exclusive lifestyle for love?
I:13534;20;After a friendly practice session, Tom discovers that Chris is an opera lover and is invited to share an evening out with his rich family.
I:13534;21;The lovely and sweet Chloe makes it known that she's rather enamored of Chris and they soon embark on a romantic relationship.
I:13534;22;powered job and also continue in his duties to the Hewett family.
I:13534;23;He cares for his wife and enjoys the lifestyle the family affords him, but Chloe is constantly on at him to get her pregnant, yet he really does love Nola.
I:13534;24;what makes Match Point so great is Allen's tightly focused direction.
I:13534;25;The dialogue is sharp and witty, the story is very well laid out and planned, and builds very slowly, keeping the viewer guessing, so one never really knows where the story is heading.
I:13534;26;kudos should also go to Allen that he can imbue such finely wrought performances out his sexy ensemble of young actors.
I:13534;27;scarlet Johansson gives a fiercely sexy, dynamic, and feverishly sensual performance as Nola.
I:13534;28;Provocative, saucy, edgy, and vulnerable, she's a mass of conflicting emotions.
I:13534;29;emily Mortimer is also terrific Chloe.
I:13534;30;"Chloe is obviously a product of her class
I:13534;31;natured, and kindly but also a bit snottish.
I:13534;32;She's pleased to fall in love with a man not of her class and thinks herself blessed by his ostensible affection.
I:13534;33;meyers who is a revelation as Chris.
I:13534;34;As the loving son in.
I:13534;35;He's the working class outsider who will resort to any lengths to fit in, but his persistently good nature holds a passive aggressive streak that is ultimately deceptive.
I:13534;36;match Point is suffused with a glow of bittersweet romance and ruefulness among the elite, English upper class, and Allen has more than nailed their grandiloquence and aristocratic pretensions.
I:13534;37;Maybe that explains why Allen's work as writer and director seems here to be more engaged and energetic than it has in years.
I:13534;38;Yes, it's a return to pretty.
I:13534;39;she is a marvel to behold and to listen to, with the dusky voice .
I:13534;40;It didn't fit this film, and the plot overruled the excellent characterization which Woody had accomplished to that point.
I:13534;41;And there are the outsiders, beautiful but penniless, equally self.
I:13534;42;Matchpoint was recommended by an esteemed gentleman with such enthusiasm over a film I haven't heard in years.
I:13534;43;I really loved this movie.
I:13534;44;I thought the acting was done very well, Jonathan and Scarlett had a chemistry that worked for this.
I:13534;45;The plot of the story moved at a good pace, though some things I would have left out, and the ending was something I did not expect at all.
I:13534;46;In fact the ending for me was the best part about the whole thing.
I:13534;47;I was pleasantly surprised and I still think about it.
I:13534;48;definitely a movie to watch.
I:13534;49;I, in complete contradiction to the American public, have actually found that I have enjoyed Allen's recent efforts.
I:13534;50;I've enjoyed all of Allen's films to various degrees.
I:13534;51;"I did after all pay to see a ""Woody Allen picture""."
I:13534;52;To my surprise Allen showcases a great ability at being able to create suspense.
I:13534;53;And I mean he does it really well.
I:13534;54;For a Woody Allen film there was certainly a lot of buzz floating around the picture.
I:13534;55;And I want your experience to be the same as mine.
I:13534;56;To discover the plot secrets right there in the theater was amazing.
I:13534;57;The two instantly hit it off and become good friends, they both even share a love of opera.
I:13534;58;Chloe also takes an instant liking to Chris and soon things get complicated and my description of the movie will have to stop there.
I:13534;59;Hopefully both ladies will receive Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress.
I:13534;60;It also helps she is given more screen time so we have more opportunities to care about her character.
I:13534;61;"now is ""Match Point"" really Allen's best film in a decade as some critics are saying?"
I:13534;62;"For the rest of us though ""Match Point"" is one of Allen's bravest films to date and one of 2005's best films."
I:13534;63;line: Woody Allen's most complex, daring films in years.
I:13534;64;One of the year's best.
I:13534;65;The acting is good, Chris, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, projects the requisite moral emptiness and cowardice.
I:13534;66;Chloe is played by the enchanting Emily Mortimer, (unforgettable in Dear Frankie).
I:13534;67;She is so unequivocally kind and good that watching Chris abuse her is especially painful and, in an odd and gloomy way, somehow inevitable.
I:13534;68;life film full of fine observation and good under.
I:13534;69;stated acting and direction that is spot.
I:13534;70;Allen is to be congratulated on a very fine piece of work.
I:13534;71;Some reviewers have commented that the middle of the film is somewhat slow, but personally I found the entire thing to be perfectly paced and judged, each element setting up the next in careful succession.
I:13534;72;"And the ending redeems the slight ""play with the audience's expectations"" lapse, so that one comes away feeling satisfied to have watched a grown."
I:13534;73;All the right ingredients of a great movie.
I:13534;74;good plot, good acting, great direction and oh so English!
I:13534;75;The movie was okay and the storyline was good, with good meaning and philosophy.
I:13534;76;But if you have a taste for a well written, well cast, well dressed ensemble you'll be in for a treat!
I:13534;77;Incredibly moving, disturbing and nailbiting I loved this movie and of course woody allen still has what it takes to make an incredible movie.
I:13534;78;Woody has done it again.
I:13534;79;Meaning that he has once more copied himself.
I:13534;80;All the moral issues depicted in this movie were already in Crimes and Misdemeanors (CM), which truly is one of his best movies and was also much deeper and much better acted.
I:13534;81;This movie is just CM in London, without its moral depth, its great script and its great actors.
I:13534;82;Pretty good acting on all sides.
I:13534;83;The last 10 minutes made the whole thing worth it.
I:13534;84;Great ending, good tie in to the beginning.
I:13534;85;It's sexy and tense, expertly paced and tightly scripted.
I:13534;86;The film flows so evenly and keeps your interest throughout, and actually is able to catch the viewer off guard in the final act of the film by expertly crafting a script that disguises itself very well.
I:13534;87;The chemistry between the entire cast is rock solid as well, from Jonathon Rhys Meyers to the every scrumptious Scarlett Johansson, and adds layer upon layer to the understanding and ultimate climax of the film.
I:13534;88;He has a beautiful apartment, a beautiful wife and a well paying job, and then walks in Nola Rice, fianc e to Chloe's brother Tom.
I:13534;89;Nola is sexy, she's confident and she's everything Chris has ever wanted in a woman, but she's taken, and so is he.
I:13534;90;She's convinced that Chris loves her and not his wife and is determined to have Chris all to herself.
I:13534;91;The film takes a twist I personally didn't see coming and leaves you somewhat breathless in its raw delivery.
I:13534;92;the acting here is superb.
I:13534;93;Scarlett Johansson is a scene stealer as the delicious Nola Rice.
I:13534;94;She's very aware of her sexuality and uses it as a weapon against Chris but more importantly against the audience.
I:13534;95;Johansson was the perfect choice for the other woman because it's very believable that any man would be drawn to her regardless of the life they are leading.
I:13534;96;Jonathon Rhys Meyers is also excellent in this film.
I:13534;97;His performance is very detailed.
I:13534;98;Emily Mortimer is also fantastic, albeit very sorely underused.
I:13534;99;Woody Allen also directs this masterpiece so evenly.
I:13534;100;His script is tight, his editing is fantastic and the finished product is one to watch again and again.
I:13534;101;And have I mentioned that London, being the backdrop, is effortlessly captivating and a perfect mood setter!If a well paced and thought provoking thriller is what you're looking for then `Match Point' may just be the film you need to see.
I:13534;102;It'll keep you at the edge of your seat throughout and is sure to please anyone in your company.
I:13534;103;It's edgy, it's sexy and it's intense.
I:13534;104;The film is PG.13 at best.
I:13534;105;`Match Point' delivers scene after scene and remains one of my favorite films of 2005, one of the most surprising, the most entertaining and the most rewatchable films in recent years.
I:13534;106;The story flows slowly, but is thoroughly engrossing.
I:13534;107;the rich mother is a baiting harpy .
I:13534;108;Brian Cox is great, as usual, as the benevolent patriarch.
I:13534;109;and, despite a genuine charm and appeal, you never fully understand the main character's sincerity and motivation .
I:13534;110;you may be surprised by its thoughtfulness.
I:13534;111;As they make FAR TOO obvious, the movie is a modern interpretation/manipulation/rewrite of Crime and Punishment (great book!)
I:13534;112;not just in how it affects our 'success', but also how it affects our moral make.
I:13534;113;I'm not religious and the book is, but I loved it!)
I:13534;114;I have never seen Annie Hall or Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex (But Was Afraid To Ask), but I hear that they are amazing.
I:13534;115;You see, Wilton firmly believes in luck, and the opening narration, involving a tennis ball hitting the net, is a very powerful theme throughout the film.
I:13534;116;Soon, Chloe and Chris start a relationship, and Chris starts to experience how the upper class lives.
I:13534;117;Chloe's family like Chris a lot, and Alec comments on his pride that Chris was able to rise up the social ladder on his own merits throughout life.
I:13534;118;She is a bit of a seductress, and she knows it.
I:13534;119;What follows is an interesting look at affairs, and the things Chris will do to keep both women.
I:13534;120;He goes to great lengths in order to rekindle their affair.
I:13534;121;He has a beautiful apartment overlooking the Thames, as well as every luxury he could wish for.
I:13534;122;the movie is very darkly comedic, and all the little nuances work very well.
I:13534;123;Even when things get very dark towards the end, the humor is still present.
I:13534;124;The cast does a great job in all of their roles, convincingly portraying the emotions people go through in the situations that they run in to.
I:13534;125;furthermore, the soundtrack is both appropriate and distinctive.
I:13534;126;this film is a great way to start off 2006, and should be a must.
I:13534;127;"Let's review: it's obvious from that quick scene that the romance with Chris is a recurring topic
I:13534;128;If it were not for the opening monologue on luck, the cleverly planted clue in the movie's most tense moments, and the jaw.
I:13534;129;jonathan Rhys Meyers is the perfect lead, dark and brooding, and very believable as Chris Wilton, the Irish tennis player who ingratiates himself into an upper crust English family.
I:13534;130;Likewise, Emily Mortimer hits all the right notes to come across as the family's sweet and pampered daughter Chloe who is instantly attracted to him and opens up a life of wealth and privilege he has only dreamed about.
I:13534;131;"Although Chris finds Chloe ""sweet"" it is Nola, as portrayed by a sultry and seductive Scarlett Johansson, that arouses his passions."
I:13534;132;Of course, passion wins out and overcomes reason, morals, and good judgment.
I:13534;133;rhys Meyers gives the perfect angst.
I:13534;134;Because the characters are portrayed so perfectly by all the actors, the viewer cannot help but be drawn to them and caught up in their sordid story.
I:13534;135;Saw the movie twice to really enjoy both the acting and the story.
I:13534;136;I feel so strongly about this movie I had to review it.
I:13534;137;I love both main actors, and have loved them in everything they're been in.
I:13534;138;I love Woody Allen movies .
I:13534;139;An excellent study into the souls of people and what makes them tick.
I:13534;140;The acting is superb .
I:13534;141;everyone turns out great performances.
I:13534;142;"I have just watched it for the second time
I:13534;143;"Not a ""feel good"" movie
I:13534;144;I highly recommend this movie.
I:13534;145;Interesting look at human drives and passions.
I:13534;146;Where's the clever dialog, the deep character studies and the intriguing plots and subplots that are hallmarks of his better work?
I:13534;147;The dialog is so written, as in, it seems as if the actors are reading written lines.
I:13534;148;The story centers on a young man who is a tennis instructor for the rich and then he marries into a very nice (much too nice) rich family.
I:13534;149;'Crimes and Misdemeaners' is one of the best films of all time.
I:13534;150;It moved so slowly I almost turned it off a couple of times.
I:13534;151;humans by nature, have aspirations to lift themselves and their lifestyles above what they grew up in.
I:13534;152;His style is content being the subtext to the story.
I:13534;153;meyers steals the show with his beautifully understated performance.
I:13534;154;The zealousness to rise in life couples with a deep sense of vulnerabilty to make the character of Chris Wilton truly memorable.
I:13534;155;same is true for Scarlett Johnansson.
I:13534;156;Very few actresses these days are as talented as Miss Johansson.
I:13534;157;I think the plot, actors and the whole film just terrific.
I:13534;158;It is the longest film that he has ever made.
I:13534;159;For longtime fans, this may be a welcome change.
I:13534;160;There are two other things about MATCH POINT that are worth noting:1.
I:13534;161;At the 90 minute mark, the film turns into a thriller.
I:13534;162;Woody Allen has delivered a good one this time, predictable to a degree but with a surprise twist at the end.
I:13534;163;It's the story of a love.
I:13534;164;The movie had some enjoyable moments.
I:13534;165;I've enjoyed her work so far.
I:13534;166;The fact that Woody Allen made this movie made it even more enticing.
I:13534;167;Every time the rich family was on screen they doted around doing what rich people do, wearing rich people clothes, but without personality or depth.
I:13534;168;The length of the film was way too long, thanks to the intricate dialouge and run on scenes.
I:13534;169;Oh well let's watch it any.
I:13534;170;All I can say is WOW.
I:13534;171;Suprise ending, I normally can't stand Woody Allen, but this is very good movie.
I:13534;172;marvelously eerie but satisfying!The cast is extraordinary, especially Rhys Meyers,.
I:13534;173;and the plot takes you for a wonderful ride.
I:13534;174;It reminded me of 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' but in that movie we had a likable Woody Allen character to root for.
I:13534;175;"In the end it was just a big ""so what"" for me."
I:13534;176;`Match Point', written and directed by Woody Allen, is like a long drink of cool water for devoted Woody Allen fans, as it is easily his best movie since `Crimes and Misdemeanors', to which it has many similarities.
I:13534;177;And yet, someone familiar with Allen's complete body of work will be able to see glimpses of his recurring themes lightly sprinkled here and there throughout the movie.
I:13534;178;It is the main theme in all his best movies such as `Annie Hall', `Hannah and Her Sisters', `Crimes and Misdemeanors', `Manhattan', and `Husbands and Wives.
I:13534;179;several of Allen's minor themes also pop up here and there, such as scenes taking place in and at the entrance to theaters and scenes taking place while there is action on the screen or stage in the background.
I:13534;180;Classic opera also forms the musical backdrop to all the action.
I:13534;181;I also have to believe that Allen has a special affinity to tennis, as the game and the tennis court appears at an important point in Allen's most important earlier movie, `Annie Hall'.
I:13534;182;unlike virtually every other Allen movie I have seen (and I have seen every one!)
I:13534;183;Even Allen's own nebbish character in many of his movies is generally a successful comedian, writer, or even detective (`Curse of the Jade Scorpion').
I:13534;184;law Chris is played as a genuinely talented up and comer, who fulfills his promise when given a convenient mid.
I:13534;185;And, Chris' wealthy inlaws, played by Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton are played straight as an arrow, being totally devoted to the happiness of their daughter and her husband.
I:13534;186;As this story takes center stage, it is much better developed here, and Johansson does at least as well as the older Angelica Houston does in `Crimes.'
I:13534;187;But, it all works, and works well.
I:13534;188;While it may not be as strong a performance (given the absence of a lead such as Bill Murray) as in `Lost in Translation', Johansson's performance is worth the price of admission and all other actors carry their roles very, very well.
I:13534;189;and, London fills in for Allen at least as well as his favorite scenes from New York.
I:13534;190;goers have been stunned by the transformation of Woody Allen as a director because of this film, and there's no doubt that this is a step in the right direction.
I:13534;191;He's planted firmly behind the camera as director, and this is a very good thing (but not a great one).
I:13534;192;He meets up with a nice, wealthy young man named Tom and is quickly introduced to his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer).
I:13534;193;Although this is a giant leap in the right direction for Mr. Allen, it still held a narcoleptic pace.
I:13534;194;I liked the mood of the movie from the get go.
I:13534;195;This movie has a pretty serious tone throughout.
I:13534;196;It has passion and suspense which I always love.
I:13534;197;But you know, I liked this movie anyway.
I:13534;198;I can't even explain why I liked it.
I:13534;199;I enjoy existentialism, so by the end of this film I was really intrigued.
I:13534;200;"I love this movie
I:13534;201;"It's a great thriller
I:13534;202;"And then with the ring at the end they tie that all together
I:13534;203;This is a really fascinating thriller with great characters and I highly recommend it.
I:13534;204;Film Noir at it's best, quite an unexpected ending.
I:13534;205;this is a really good movie.
I:13534;206;it shows how luck is a very important part of ur life.
I:13534;207;but i dont agree with some people, even though it was a great movie that u shouldn't miss, it still wasnt as good and touching and original as brokeback mountain
I:13534;208;Woody Allen inspires passionate discussion, mind.
I:13534;209;"well, I have seen a few Woody Allen films, enjoyed many of them, and have largely forgotten most since ""The Purple Rose of Cairo."""
I:13534;210;But I enjoyed this film a lot.
I:13534;211;Among other things, I think it is well.
I:13534;212;acted, and has a lot of techniques that remind me of the Woody Allen films I enjoyed so much.
I:13534;213;Like when Chris, the protagonist, encounters someone he knows on the street and starts talking to them .
I:13534;214;The few opera librettos that I have seen are really very simple as stories, and don't demand a lot of thinking on the part of the listeners/viewers.
I:13534;215;The film revolves around the role of chance, or luck, in certain key events of life, and .
I:13534;216;I think it's an interesting point.
I:13534;217;That alone makes the film worth seeing.
I:13534;218;And I found Nola, the character played by Scarlet Johanssen, to be a little hard to believe.
I:13534;219;She morphs from a self.
I:13534;220;confident flirt at the beginning to a desperate victim at the end, without any clear line of development, although the ping.
I:13534;221;Funny, Yogi, but I don't remember if a fat lady sings at the end or not.
I:13534;222;Oh well, that's the way the cookie crumbles.
I:13534;223;can be enjoyed over and over because of their overpowering sense of style.
I:13534;224;"Perhaps the greatest sin of the ""average"" thriller is, despite the redemption it offers in the end, it can make murder appear ""glamorous"" or at least clothe the crimes in a stylish cinematic technique."
I:13534;225;The focus for everyone is on Chris' impossibly contradicted state of mind.
I:13534;226;the viewer is denied the satisfaction of resolution and the relief of justice served.
I:13534;227;"The penetrating depth and truthfulness was unlike any other ""thriller"", if one can even call this film a thriller."
I:13534;228;so Woody Allen has made a REALLY original movie here, which takes some rather unique turns within the suspense genre that I really haven't seen before.
I:13534;229;It is indeed Hitchcock, minus the lighthearted Hitchcock humor.
I:13534;230;It is the kind of story people go to church for.
I:13534;231;This is one of Woody Allen's best films.
I:13534;232;It is serious and very sensual without being pornographic.
I:13534;233;It is suspenseful and rivets you until the very end.
I:13534;234;He just took a break from the good struff.
I:13534;235;His last great film, Sweet and Lowdown was amazing too.
I:13534;236;I like how the protagonist gets away with it and all the talk of luck and fate.
I:13534;237;I also like how what you think will do him in actually saves him.
I:13534;238;now there are plaenty of good things about this film too.
I:13534;239;The acting for one is notable especially Jonathan Rhys.
I:13534;240;I also think the writing and directing was done very well.
I:13534;241;The characters are well developed throughout the story, and my attention was pretty well kept.
I:13534;242;My recommendation?If you love twisted relationships see:CloserThe DreamersIf you love tragic/dramatic relationships see:The Virgin SuicidesThe NotebookBrokeback MountainRomeo and Juliet (of course)
I:13534;243;the step further is his exploration of random chance and luck in one's life.
I:13534;244;myers (from THE TUDORS tv series) as a handsome, charming and cultivated man who sets out to marry a very wealthy bride.
I:13534;245;he is an excellent tennis player and that is his way of meeting the family and worming his way into it.
I:13534;246;his target woman has a brother and this brother has a fiance played by scarlett johanssen.
I:13534;247;i really liked it but it is definitely a change of pace for Allen except for his musings about the factor of luck in living our lives.
I:13534;248;the character of Chris Walton, played beautifully by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, is certainly typical of Highsmith.
I:13534;249;He is the handsome but talented man of humble beginnings who seeks the finer things in life and will actually reach the point where he will kill to maintain his lifestyle.
I:13534;250;He is coldly calculating with many social skills and a bright intellect.
I:13534;251;Yet he is driven by passion and obsession for his brother.
I:13534;252;the film does a good job of demonstrating how hot passions may come and go and are rarely the basis for sound decision making.
I:13534;253;He is sophisticated evil residing in a man of grace and beauty.
I:13534;254;the plot is well constructed and logical yet never reveals too much.
I:13534;255;i really enjoyed this film and the acting was really well done.
I:13534;256;This movie proved to me there is a mature, talented soul hidden inside Allen and it really knows what goes on in the world.
I:13534;257;Premise is simple: Uneducated tennis pro makes friends with rich guy, attracts rich guy's sister, gets taken under wing by rich guy's father, gets hots for rich guy's fiance, and spends most of movie worrying what to do about it.
I:13534;258;It'll get good, really good.
I:13534;259;This is actually far more entertaining than watching comedic or neurotic interactions which never seem to resolve to anyone's satisfaction.
I:13534;260;I found the film highly plausible and very realistic.
I:13534;261;And his leading actress, Scarlet Johanson,is very convincing as a gold digger, down.
I:13534;262;"Damn good contemporary drama, the way it might just happen in many ""higher Circles."""
I:13534;263;Kudos to the principle and supporting cast for a fine mystery thriller.
I:13534;264;It is set in London rather than New York, it has an opera soundtrack rather than jazz and, most significantly, it is a dramatic thriller without even a hint of comedy.
I:13534;265;But Chris' lust for Nola overwhelms him and they, since Nola was recently dropped by Tom, begin a passionate affair.
I:13534;266;the storyline managed to hold my attention but was far from captivating or original.
I:13534;267;"But he is still a long way from the ""glory days"" of his best work."
I:13534;268;Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johannson smolder on the screen with such amazing chemistry.
I:13534;269;All the acting is superb.
I:13534;270;I particularly loved the posh English personalities so well done.
I:13534;271;All in all I highly recommend this movie.
I:13534;272;The acting was superb, with lots of subtleties for the psychologically minded.
I:13534;273;It's probably one I will watch again.
I:13534;274;I was surprised at how intense and dramatic this Woody Allen film was.
I:13534;275;The story line was suspenseful and kept me guessing to the very last minute.
I:13534;276;This movie will definately make you wonder about Love, Lust and Life.
I:13534;277;Scarlett Johansson, who is a beautiful woman, was so not convincing in this movie.
I:13534;278;Match Point is an appealing movie.
I:13534;279;third, Scarlett Johansson as Nora is a natural beauty who captures every scene in a seemingly effortless and unpretentious way.
I:13534;280;the ending is definitely a European one, a fingerprint of Woody Allen.
I:13534;281;where the film does pick up though is how Chris deals with his problem which is quite gritty and raw.
I:13534;282;But it does present a good anti.
I:13534;283;is there much good in this film?
I:13534;284;johansson's performance is right on the mark, a sultry and beautiful femme fatale, whose sexual magnetism pulls the now married Chris Wilton into a lurid and obsessive affair.
I:13534;285;The scenes between Johansson and Meyers are performed extremely well as one can at times fill the heat come off the screen.
I:13534;286;woody Allen's screenplay, well, particularly the dialogue, is absolutely shining with wit and depth.
I:13534;287;In fact it is the dialogue the carries the film along.
I:13534;288;as a Woody Allen fan for many years, I've followed his career through its ups and downs, and Match Point clearly demonstrates that the old master continues to have what it takes to create a great film.
I:13534;289;Great film by Woody shot among the aristocratic English set.
I:13534;290;This helped make Scarlett a star.
I:13534;291;Chris Rhys Meyers is great as the guy torn between security and lust.
I:13534;292;Emily Mortimer (producer role on The Newsroom) is also very good as the doting wife.
I:13534;293;The film takes several unexpected turns.
I:13534;294;"Director Woody Allen in a departure from his usual New York City based Bergmanesque style existential films, ""Match Point"" proves to be an intriguing film based on a tangled and convoluted series of relationships."
I:13534;295;He is offered an important position in the the elder Hewitt's firm, more than securing his future.
I:13534;296;Brother Tom is courting American aspiring actress Nola Rice played by an alluring Scarlett Johansson.
I:13534;297;rhys Meyers eventually marries his girlfriend Chloe and due to her family's influence and support lives a privileged existence.
I:13534;298;allen typically masterful in his portrayal of relationships, be they normal or aberrant, weaves a convoluted plot that contains a number of surprising sequellae that create ample opportunity for post viewing discussion.
I:13534;299;The critical buzz about Woody Allen's latest film, Match Point, is that it's his best since (fill in the blank), and, to a degree, that's true.
I:13534;300;That said, in a sense, this film is also sort of a `Best Of' Woody Allen film, which reuses many of the best scenes and motifs of his best work.
I:13534;301;The editing of the film is very crisp, and at only about two hours, the film feels far longer and richer, in the best sense.
I:13534;302;The English countryside is also beautifully filmed by Allen newcomer Remi Adefarasin.
I:13534;303;who in the movie grew up poor) who marries into a very wealth family and get set up with a cozy in the family company.
I:13534;304;the movie is about how he balances the two relationship and the surprising conclusion to it all.
I:13534;305;And it is suprising and unpredictable.
I:13534;306;I found this to be very enjoyable as many movies today lack any sort of point or story.
I:13534;307;woody Allen fans and those who love Oscar nominated movies I'm sure will love this drama.
I:13534;308;Nominally a story of a young man who by sheer luck is drawn into a life of wealth and love between two women.
I:13534;309;One becomes his wife from whose family affords him a wealthy lifestyle and a lucrative career.
I:13534;310;He's love for her is real and it is a comforting Eros that has all the marks being built for a lifetime.
I:13534;311;As his mistress puts pressure on him to leave his wealth and wife for her, he struggles with how to live with the best of both worlds.
I:13534;312;"It is here that the story's ""message"" comes through."
I:13534;313;A man as well read as Allen surely knows this variety of nihilism can be found in the ancient Greeks.
I:13534;314;Most of nihilism's acolytes have the good sense to make their hobbyhorse entertaining and fun.
I:13534;315;"There are musicians who believe their tune making is more artistic and ""musical"" if they avoid all the attractive ""hooks""."
I:13534;316;like, mirthless narrative is a mark of thoughtful seriousness.
I:13534;317;Have seen this movie at least 5 times and it remains one of my favorites.
I:13534;318;dark, twisted, stylish, and the ending is the best of all.
I:13534;319;Great cast especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers who is so amazing as always.
I:13534;320;And thruout the movie is the haunting opera score.
I:13534;321;Jonathan Rhys Meyers is terrific.
I:13534;322;His performance as the power.
I:13534;323;thirst kitchen boy was unforgettable.
I:13534;324;This film is worth watching.
I:13534;325;A stylish, amoral head trip of a movie that early.
I:13534;326;(I think this film gives its writer's opinion, and does so in a very interesting fashion.)
I:13534;327;What begins amid manners and mores as an exploration of relationships and social climbing (and luck) enters its final act as something else entirely: a psychological drama of intensely suspenseful proportions.
I:13534;328;And that critic was precisely right.
I:13534;329;gripping ending, and was pleasantly surprised by this entire movie.
I:13534;330;It's among the best films I've seen in at least a year or two.
I:13534;331;crafted, with a rewarding focus on setting.
I:13534;332;'Match Point', after much debate, is the film I would personally name as best of 2005.
I:13534;333;The reason being is that it's refreshing.
I:13534;334;It's smart and intoxicating, and while nothing really new it's original in it's own unoriginality.
I:13534;335;Chloe falls in love with Chris quickly, and Chloe's family does as well, falling for his charm and giving him a high position in the family business so he can support their daughter.
I:13534;336;"Some of his first words to her are ""has anyone ever told you you have very sensual lips?"""
I:13534;337;Nola, confident in her affect on the opposite sex, plays with him almost, leading him on by a string as he desires her more and more.
I:13534;338;He's comfortable with his life, his easy life, and he doesn't want to destroy that.
I:13534;339;Anyways, I recommend this film HIGHLY, and by the way, I just wanted to make clear that this film did not deserve the R rating for theres not one cuss word uttered in the entire film, no violence, and the sexuality is breif PG.13 status.
I:13534;340;Watching this movie was one of the most morally soiling cinematic experiences of my life.
I:13534;341;And the movie manipulates us to root for him as he does all of this.
I:13534;342;a twist of lime that is.
I:13534;343;I have seen this movie about 5 times and it still holds up.
I:13534;344;A wonderful combination of drama and thriller.
I:13534;345;"This is Woody's best since ""Crimes and Misdemeanors."""
I:13534;346;Here again he creates of revealing thriller, a parable, with a heavy, but never heavy.
I:13534;347;"As in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" Woody is fascinated by the possibility that crime pays and pays big."
I:13534;348;There is real chemistry on the set, a nice, sustained sexual tension created that builds persuasively toward the inevitable climax.
I:13534;349;Beautifully filmed and acted, this is Woody's best in years.
I:13534;350;If you are a fan of Woody Allen's movies you love this one as it is a great suspenseful murder mystery!
I:13534;351;I loved the story and the cast especially Jonathan R myers he was excellent.
I:13534;352;It kept my interest the entire time.
I:13534;353;I loved the movie, it made me feel as if I was right there in every scene.
I:13534;354;There are so many twists and turns in this movie.
I:13534;355;But it kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:13534;356;There was a surprise ending.
I:13534;357;Woody Allen likes his movies to be on the edge.
I:13534;358;Even Johanssen delivers a nice performance in this film.
I:13534;359;Though the plot moves every slowly, the ending makes it all worth the wait.
I:13534;360;This has one of the neatest bits of stage business you are likely to ever see in a movie.
I:13534;361;"Poker players say that because there is a significant element of chance involved in any given hand
I:13534;362;He is handsome, charming, smart, and a very good tennis player who is candid about not quite being good enough against the very best.
I:13534;363;well, how lucky can you get?
I:13534;364;She is sitting pretty however because if she marries Tom she will be set for life.
I:13534;365;i could go on, but the plot is so delicious that I don't want to spoil it for you.
I:13534;366;"It's a variation on the venerable theme of rake's progress, employing in an interesting way the old adage, ""The man who marries for money earns it."""
I:13534;367;see this for Woody Allen, who is just as smooth with this upscale noir/Hitchcockian thriller as he is with his renowned comedic and satirical efforts.

I:13534;369;I can see some traces of the best Hitchcock in this movie.
I:13534;370;Also, it is fantastic to see how he has cared about landscapes in the town and at the village.
I:13534;371;Scarlett and Jonathan are incredible.
I:13534;372;Personally, I like his films, but this is what makes him a great director.
I:13534;373;"Saving distances is like when Spielberg is capable of making ""Jaws"" and ""Jurassic Park"" and, in the other hand, he can make ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Color Purple""."
I:13534;374;"allen, so, has been able to do ""Bananas"", ""Annie Hall"" and now ""Match Point""."
I:13534;375;I had seen this movie in the theater when it first came out and really liked it.
I:13534;376;Since I received it from Amazon I have watched it at least 3 times and loaned it out as well.
I:13534;377;It is an excellent movie.
I:13534;378;I had since ordered and received Vicky christina Barcelona which also stars Scarlett Johanssan and it is also very good.
I:13534;379;"None of the characters create any real emotional connection with the audience
I:13534;380;But this turns out to be the genius of the work.
I:13534;381;The music, the scenery and the setting are so beautiful and engaging that they, too, contribute to this effect.
I:13534;382;"the tennis ""match point"" theme, and the idea that life is as much about luck as anything else, should have been drawn on a bit more, especially toward the end of the film."
I:13534;383;As it is, the suspense comes on rather suddenly about three quarters of the way through the film.
I:13534;384;Very original and non Hollywood.
I:13534;385;But finally Allen has returned to the game with a subtle but perfectly done thriller which allows him to reinvent himself and discover new terrain like a brand new filmmaker.
I:13534;386;match Point offers a simple but powerful message that luck plays a huge part in everyday life which to a major extent is true.
I:13534;387;From there Chris and Chloe start to date and Chris a small and unwealthy man gets introduced to high society life.
I:13534;388;He's offered a high stakes job, a personal driver, etc, just to bring happiness into the life of Chloe.
I:13534;389;chris is perfectly content until he meets the beautiful Nola played by Scarlett Johansson.
I:13534;390;Match Point is about luck but also about choices made in life for personal enjoyment.
I:13534;391;Is it better to be rich and not completely satisfied or poor and happy?
I:13534;392;the film is very similar to Woody's 1989 masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanors and it takes similar turns.
I:13534;393;I won't tell you what he chooses but I will tell you the dilemma leads Allen to his most satisfying, tense, engaging film in over a decade.
I:13534;394;it's great to see Allen take such a simple premise used several times and put all his trademark qualities into it mixed with a discovery of new terrain.
I:13534;395;Match Point is an engaging, entertaining film that gives you a taste of the high life and shows you what it can lead a man to.
I:13534;396;10.10 for this excellent film by the great Woody Allen.
I:13534;397;Though the change of location from Allen's usual Manhattan initially sounds refreshing, Allen makes a bit of a rod for his own back here.
I:13534;398;Perhaps it is good commentary, but at best if it was it would be one layer to an otherwise mostly flawed film.
I:13534;399;And it would also be an element that escaped most reviewers when the film came out.
I:13534;400;but the film is quite exciting, once you get past the first half hour.
I:13534;401;The last half hour is a particular shock, and completely unexpected.
I:13534;402;In terms of an amoral character doing what he beleives is 'neccesary', The Talented Mr Ripley is a far better film.
I:13534;403;Match Point is a thrilling drama that intertwines relationships and temptations.
I:13534;404;He takes a tennis instructor's job at a high society tennis country club in Great Britain.
I:13534;405;There family is well off and open their arms to Chris even though he is an American.
I:13534;406;I really enjoyed how the actors portrayed their character's tension and dialog.
I:13534;407;Director Woody Allen did a good job keeping the film paced and consistent.
I:13534;408;Under the direction of Woody Allen, Johansson's performance is spot.
I:13534;409;She portrays the fianc of a socialite in a setting that is sophisticated, classy, and elegant.
I:13534;410;The dialogue is smart, witty and progresses along quickly IMO.
I:13534;411;"Another of Allen's better productions ""Midnight in Paris"" I would recommend as well."
I:13534;412;Great story and could be a bit surprising if you have not followed many of his roles.
I:13534;413;a good movie all round.
I:13534;414;This is one of Woody Allen's best movies.
I:13534;415;It's got so many clever twists that it is difficult to describe to someone without giving the movie away.
I:13534;416;meyers and Scarlett Johanson in the leads, Woody Allen has managed to create something I've never seen before .
I:13534;417;a sexy Woody Allen film.
I:13534;418;"Intelligent, engrossing and watchable, ""Match Point"" is also a somber, thoughtful film about luck, ambition, class and attraction."
I:13534;419;Stories of love triangles with tennis imagery would not normally seem to go together too well, but Allen does draw the audience into this story.
I:13534;420;Fans of her work will enjoy this film.
I:13534;421;She's a diversified actress who proves she can go in any direction necessary to give a good portrayal.
I:13534;422;this movie is highly recommended for all persons who enjoy soap.
I:13534;423;Having seen just about everything Woody Allen has done, I was impressed that he was able to shift the scene from New York to London.
I:13534;424;I have only seen her in a couple of things, including Ghost World in which I thought she did a good job.
I:13534;425;I'm sure she mentioned something about her work in the diary, which lead the police to Chris in the first place.
I:13534;426;I thought this movie was going to be more of a passionate love story.
I:13534;427;if Chris marries Chloe, he will be set for life, since Chloe's father is willing to groom him for a job in his successful business empire.
I:13534;428;"the first half of ""Match Point"" is brilliant."
I:13534;429;Meyers is mesmerizing as a self.
I:13534;430;Johannson is at her most alluring as Nola, an insecure and penniless American whose sole asset is her gorgeous appearance.
I:13534;431;She is desperate to break into acting, but senses that she will never be good enough to succeed.
I:13534;432;Brian Cox is wonderful as Alec Hewett, Chloe's kind.
I:13534;433;hearted father who takes Chris under his wing, hoping that this young man will make his daughter happy.
I:13534;434;Allen suggests that we may live in a world where justice is an unattainable ideal.
I:13534;435;Our fate may be determined as much by chance as it is by our actions or our virtues.
I:13534;436;Match Point is beautifully shot, tightly edited, and briskly paced.
I:13534;437;I cannot reveal or even hint at the surprise ending, but the agonizing suspense in this film is at times reminiscent of a Hitchcock thriller.
I:13534;438;Oh Woody, you should be ashamed of yourself.
I:13534;439;This film has a couple of things going for it:1.
I:13534;440;"Strong cast, very telegenic leads in Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, and Emily Mortimer
I:13534;441;Beautiful operatic score, a departure from Allen's usual jazzy scores .
I:13534;442;very easy on the ears!
I:13534;443;Luckily the last 1/4 of the film does become at least a LITTLE creative.3.
I:13534;444;There are elements that will remind long.
I:13534;445;a consistent theme throughout for Chris .
I:13534;446;How they all intertwine is what makes up most of the action, and the story works like an ever.
I:13534;447;Even though it plays out like a smart thriller, Allen brings a decidedly fatalistic tone that introduces greater issues of fate, retribution and justice.
I:13534;448;level issues together in a way that makes the conclusion resonate with unpredictable force.
I:13534;449;It's a smartly rendered performance that teeters toward the predictable only toward the very end.
I:13534;450;Their scenes together are surprisingly carnal for an Allen film.
I:13534;451;like script as he makes shrewd observations about the power of luck and our profound inability to control our destinies in making one's way toward a desired life.
I:13534;452;"In a manner that recalls Gordon Willis's work in Allen's ""Interiors"", Remi Adefarasin lends an immaculately cool sheen to the cinematography, and the upscale world among the London social elite is captured almost too adroitly with Jim Clay`s manicured production design and Caroline Smith's tasteful set decorations."
I:13534;453;infused soundtrack, Allen uses old opera recordings of Caruso singing Bizet, Donizetti, Rossini and especially Verdi as a smartly evocative background.
I:13534;454;This is strong work from the film auteur side of Allen well worth viewing.
I:13534;455;He meets Tom Hewitt, a wealthy young man whose common love of opera opens up a world of riches and high class mingling for the middle class Chris.
I:13534;456;top sexy Scarlett Johanssen), he finds himself torn between his passion for the wealthy and proper Chloe and the pure lustful desire for Nola.
I:13534;457;For a movie pegged as a drama, it is unbearably suspenseful and thought provoking.
I:13534;458;This film unfolds like a play, with the actors engaging in long dialogue and exquisitely portraying their characters.
I:13534;459;this movie was so excellent that I recommend it to everyone.
I:13534;460;Watch this movie and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
I:13534;461;I'm not an Allen fan but I'm a huge fan of Jonathan Rhys.
I:13534;462;Both movies are good however, A Place In The Sun is excellent.
I:13534;463;I just love this movie.
I:13534;464;It's catchy and sexy and full of suspense.
I:13534;465;Great movie but scary to think that love can lead you to murder.
I:13534;466;This movie was wonderfully acted, to the point of asking yourself, if this could happen for real!
I:13534;467;Three of my favorites, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johanssen, and Emily Mortimer, what more can you ask for.
I:13534;468;Excellent, yummily sexy, and well worth watching.
I:13534;469;i was pleasantly surprised with the pacing of the movie.
I:13534;470;I enjoyed the sweeping views of London from the loft, and the lushness of the Queen's Tennis Club where the main character, Chris Wilton (ably played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a tennis instructor.
I:13534;471;I enjoy many of Ms. Johansson's films, but this was NOT a favorite of mine.
I:13534;472;star effort based on Emily Mortimer's character, JRM for some fine seductive moments (an easy business for someone as fantastic looking as he is), and cinematography.
I:13534;473;In MATCH POINT, though, our protaganist cleverly and luckily gets away with it.
I:13534;474;"on the part of luck, I have to give Allen credit for the old lady's wedding ring sequence
I:13534;475;That was, indeed, a clever twist.
I:13534;476;The two shared an incredible chemistry that has never been duplicated.
I:13534;477;Great acting by Scarlett Johansson she always seems so true like a real person not like all the fakes out there that can't act she really has talent and it shows in this movie.
I:13534;478;"In ""Match Point,"" Woody Allen serves up a quiet, yet powerful, morality tale."
I:13534;479;Directed without flair and with little music, the story pulls us along by the strength of its intrigue.
I:13534;480;when a tennis pro begins dating a woman with British class and money, he sees a life of ease and luxury ahead.
I:13534;481;And yet, he is drawn to the wild and unpredictable side of an aspiring American actress who is also dating a wealthy Brit.
I:13534;482;Irony and justice play their hands alongside tragedy.
I:13534;483;"told with great restraint, ""Match Point"" never glorifies the characters' poor decisions."
I:13534;484;Through wonderful acting and sublime direction, this movie makes its point and lets us mull the consequences.
I:13534;485;I very much enjoyed the devilish plot, teeming with scandal and suspense, but the conclusion just didn't sit well with me.
I:13534;486;Aside from the ending, I very much enjoyed the movie.
I:13534;487;I do recomend this movie to those who love a good scandalous drama, but be aware the ending is still very scandalous, however unsatisfying it may be.
I:13534;488;This film can best be described as Interiors II.
I:13534;489;Scarlet Johansson on the other hand may have just been good enough to get one but even she was not great enough to win.
I:13534;490;The story is interesting and the unrealistic ending works because it was artistically crafted, rather than just happening because the writer ran out of ideas.
I:13534;491;Rating wise, I am a little bit surprised that this film got a R rating.
I:13534;492;In my opinion, this film is a domestic drama.
I:13534;493;Well one thing is for sure, this is Woody Allen's best film in AGES.
I:13534;494;layered, with more complex characterizations and containing the irony and wit of which Match Point is totally devoid.
I:13534;495;Woody Allen is probably one of the most literate filmmakers of any period in film history, yet Match Point adds nothing to enhance his catalogue of work.
I:13534;496;"The movie is worth seeing
I:13534;497;good movie, it keeps the entertainment and suspense during the whole presentation.
I:13534;498;the end was kind of a surprise finale
I:13534;499;This story is superbly staged and performed.
I:13534;500;This is precisely what makes this movie and script a timeless classic that will be played in the next generation for what it reveals about all of us.
I:13534;501;a visual image that accurately portrays, reveals, and identifies the particular fashions and social mores of a given culture in history.
I:13534;502;This is much more than cinema.
I:13534;503;(I rounded it up to 4 stars.)
I:13534;504;This is the nature of comedy.
I:13534;505;overall, I prefer the Crimes and Misdemeanors script, and what I recommend most about Match Point are the acting and lighting.
I:13534;506;I enjoyed the human interactions and found I connected well with Allen's view on upper.
I:13534;507;"Nola's comment ""It's such an inbred family"" summed it up well."
I:13534;508;In fact, I was really enjoying the film, for the first half at least.
I:13534;509;I think that aspect of the story is intriguing.
I:13534;510;I was left confused, slightly let down, and also amused that such a good beginning to a film ended so mechanically.
I:13534;511;Still, I enjoyed the overall apsect of it, and I am quite the Scarlet Johanson fan, so on that note I enjoyed it.
I:13534;512;in the best possible sense.
I:13534;513;crafted and entertaining films that used to be released not only by Hollywood but also by London.
I:13534;514;"The scenario is informed by movies such as ""Room at the Top"" with its social."
I:13534;515;hero on the one hand and those ironic British mysteries in which crime pays.
I:13534;516;Allen's plot and characterizations have also been crafted with an intricacy and psychological insight that would do Agatha Christie proud.
I:13534;517;Allen recycled one of his own earlier masterpieces, used only a drama part of it and created a good.
I:13534;518;"What is fascinating, the earlier masterpiece that I've mentioned above is twenty minutes shorter than ""Match Point"" but it had said so much more with such power that Allen himself was not able to recreate."
I:13534;519;"I enjoyed his silly ""Scoop"" and his dramedic ""Melinda and Melinda"" much better than his almost universally proclaimed as masterpiece ""Match Point""."
I:13534;520;I said once and I am repeating that Allen makes good, very good and excellent films.
I:13534;521;"There have been many great dramas but ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is beyond great, it is unique."
I:13534;522;one last note: more than once I've seen the same scene in the movies lately .
I:13534;523;gives you a very good idea what to expect by the end.
I:13534;524;Crimes and Misdemeanors is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:13534;525;the only engaging, credible character is the brother.
I:13534;526;She's American and comes from an undistinguished family.
I:13534;527;and thriller's need sharp, intelligent law enforcement officers.
I:13534;528;If you love steamy suspense movies, this is the one.
I:13534;529;This is one of my top favorite Woody Allen films.
I:13534;530;Woody Allen is always at his finest when he stays away from self.
I:13534;531;parody: the man can write and direct brilliantly and create solid gems of cultural/society examinations with the best of them!
I:13534;532;From the opening credits, to the keenly meaningful voice.
I:13534;533;Match Point is an intelligent, burnished, glowing little masterpiece of movie making, a thriller that keeps the viewer bound until the surprise ending.
I:13534;534;chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, groomed and handsome and magnetic in his first role as a non.
I:13534;535;Chris' good looks and manners win the family's affection and he is melded into the fabric of wealth through his attention to Chloe and his movement into the father's business.
I:13534;536;"it also captures the tension of the film in mixing tight shots with panoramas isolating the characters in motion of betrayal
I:13534;537;But the brilliance of this ensemble is Allen's keenly sensitive eye and timing and pacing of a suspense thriller that always has as its base a fine dollop of social comment and lusty romance.
I:13534;538;The cast is impeccable, from the consistently superb smaller roles to the tour de force acting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, and Emily Mortimer.
I:13534;539;This is clearly one of the finest works of Woody Allen's long career and hopefully he will continue along this vein.
I:13534;540;I have enjoyed many many Woody Allen films from his earliest comedies on thru his later dramas.
I:13534;541;To be sure, there are some great moments in the film.
I:13534;542;They are adult in the best sense of that word.
I:13534;543;Existentialists are, on the whole, if you actually read them, a rather responsible lot.
I:13534;544;Very smart at times, very glossy but with no real moral center at all.
I:13534;545;Woody Allen's new film debuts at Cannes.
I:13534;546;It is said to be a return to form.
I:13534;547;It is being nominated for numerous awards.
I:13534;548;"My second reaction, how can you take the strong backbone subplot of (Allen's) ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", and use it as the singular thrust of a new film?"
I:13534;549;That film left an incredible impression on me and you musn't tamper with it.
I:13534;550;the pretty lipped lead, Jonathan Rhys.
I:13534;551;meyers, is pretty impressive, and Scarlett Johansson, so vital, genuine, and sexual here, proves herself in all sorts of ways.
I:13534;552;From the wonderfully adept handling of the soundtrack and the unhurried, mostly natural pace of the editing to the carefully selected locations and restrained art direction .
I:13534;553;Match Point shows its purpose in every measure.
I:13534;554;There are few better combinations of art and comment capable of being so completely entertaining as well.
I:13534;555;Woody Allen again proves that he is amongst the most versatile film makers in movie history.
I:13534;556;this movie had an excellent pace, and was very well acted.
I:13534;557;Johannsen is a gorgeous woman that came into her own in this film.
I:13534;558;this was a very entertaining movie, with an excellent theme.
I:13534;559;Match Point is one of a kind.
I:13534;560;Scarlett Johansson shines in her role as Nola Rice,and her lips are more beautiful than ever.
I:13534;561;Until the last scene was over, a likable kind of a suspense/curiosity surrounds the storyline.
I:13534;562;I loved the scene where the actor cries while traveling in a taxi.
I:13534;563;Scarlett Johansson, Direction, Easy to like dark humor, the logic and masterfully induced irony, the characters are very very well dressed and you like looking at people who're looking goodThe Bad .
I:13534;564;This is a terrific movie.
I:13534;565;Wonderful scenes shot in London along the Thames riverbank and around town in general.
I:13534;566;Country house weekend is totally believable and authentic as are all of the characters.
I:13534;567;Crimes and Misdemeanors was a much better movie and one of his best.
I:13534;568;All the elements that Hitchcock was known for .
I:13534;569;creating suspense with his camera work and music, creating wonderful chemistry between his actors, and the humor, were lacking in Match Point.
I:13534;570;This doesn't diminish Allen's work but only makes it more interesting.
I:13534;571;in Match Point a young working class man (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) meets rich socialite (Emily Mortimer) and gets a job working in her father's business.
I:13534;572;This is probably one of Woody Allen's best efforts.
I:13534;573;The themes, the script, and the acting are all top notch.
I:13534;574;One of my favorite films now, I was very impressed.
I:13534;575;Beautifully acted by Rhys Meyers and Scarlet Johanson, it holds your interest.
I:13534;576;and you hold your breath.
I:13534;577;A sophisticated and chilling tale.
I:13534;578;I have been a silent witness about the progressive process of Woody Allen's creative maturity.
I:13534;579;"Woody has recurred to emblematic metaphors (such the brilliant ""Mighty Aphrodite"", to acidic plots such Deconstructing Harry or self."
I:13534;580;"biographic approaches in ""Celebrity"") Allen has made a journey inside the human soul, its fears and anguishes."
I:13534;581;"And I must recognize this emblematic and opened tribute to Dostoievsky with ""Crime and punishment"" was revitalized and modernized with mesmerizing results."
I:13534;582;chris Walton is a mysterious newcomer, who thanks to his kind manners and magnetic presence has reached the peak in the social status.
I:13534;583;All of us ignore his origins, but we are aware about his ambition, his love for power, the delights the good life in pursuit of achieve the coveted status, but without renounce to his hidden passion: the verboten fruit.
I:13534;584;As a matter of fact, he loves to be placed in the best of both worlds.
I:13534;585;To maintain his status and enjoy this risky love affair.
I:13534;586;One of the three best films of 2005 all over the world.
I:13534;587;facing reality as it is, this handsome tennis player, who has accepted his vanishing.
I:13534;588;yet this is an astute social climber, he is well mannered and can adapt to the circunstances.
I:13534;589;and indeed he mingles with the Hewetts, an aristocratic family who also share his love of opera.
I:13534;590;In the best way the movie deals with the story of a social climber and in one line his future brother in law uses clearly the word hustler, a hustler who plays by chance.
I:13534;591;(Wait to see who wins).
I:13534;592;full of many literary, artistic, sports (the metaphor of the net is so good) and musical references very well crafted by Woody Allen (a connosieur), the movie also includes its victims (whose names I don't tell) clues are given to you.
I:13534;593;a superb performance by Jonathan Rhys.
I:13534;594;She had become both the public and a Woody Allen's favorite.
I:13534;595;Sexy and so pretty but tragic: remminissences of Marilyn Monroe?
I:13534;596;Being a great fan of Woody Allen, I have most of his films, not only the classic ones, but also his newer films.
I:13534;597;Match Point expresses the maturity and a sense of zen in the career of a master director.
I:13534;598;It is a film which flows effortlessly from the beginning to the end, where the background (London) becomes a perfect setting for the plot (much like a Hitchcock film).
I:13534;599;Actually, the film resembles a Hitchcock film in many ways, from the suspense that builds gradually towards the end, the constant expectation that any minute Chris's relationship will be revealed, to Allen's excellent use of music throughout the film.
I:13534;600;although the plot is one of the most well known and repeated cliches in film making, it is astonishing how Woody Allen has presented it with such freshness.
I:13534;601;The scenes where the family gathers to discuss family matters and party scenes .
I:13534;602;which are always Allen's favorite.
I:13534;603;contribute to the overall cohesiveness of the film.
I:13534;604;i see Match Point as a brilliant work of art accomplished during the later stages in the life of a true master director, Woody Allen.
I:13534;605;There are great reviews about the movie and the characters already, so I'll skip that part.
I:13534;606;this is one of those movies that make you think after watching it.
I:13534;607;awesome movie, but more important is the way he presents this topic.
I:13534;608;He is so sultry and he and Scarlett Johansson carry this movie with their chemistry.
I:13534;609;First of all i must say that as many of you, i think the film is worth the watch only because of Scarlett Johansson, she is a very good actress.
I:13534;610;i really liked the first hour and a half, but then.
I:13534;611;you jump into the world of Chris, the luckiest irish in the UK.
I:13534;612;without those details i think it is a very good film, so many fine details, common of Woody Allen.
I:13534;613;the Best Moment, The Flirting between Meyer's and Johansson when he attempt to teach her how to play ping pon.
I:13534;614;I am not a Woody Allen fan but I was really surprised at how good this film was.
I:13534;615;It had a slow start but picked up fast and then it hooks you in and it wont let you go.
I:13534;616;The film is suspensfull and erotic at times.
I:13534;617;The ending is great and will have you talking about it for days.
I:13534;618;The acting is great and the direction is great all to make this film a must see.
I:13534;619;and though I do see the similarities in tone and feel.
I:13534;620;the end has a magnificent quote from the man by the main character).
I:13534;621;The film does a good job at foreshadowing events to come by interspersing little hints throughout the film.
I:13534;622;Many people will dislike this film, but I think that if one looks at it like one looks at an opera (which is a key aspect of the film) or tragic literature, then it will become a familiar yet unique experience.
I:13534;623;The films that are worth five stars are ones that you can take away from constantly throughout your entire life.
I:13534;624;It is a lot like good literature.
I:13534;625;Matchpoint is a suspenseful story involving a love triangle and a Greek tragedy that opens up in the middle of the fifth set.
I:13534;626;The actors are generally exceptional.
I:13534;627;"Beautiful Scarlett oozes sexual energy and tension though she plays the ""ugly American""."
I:13534;628;The irony is heavy in this drama and the darker side of human nature pleasantly laid open to the grandstands.
I:13534;629;"the most exciting part of a tennis match is the tiebreaker
I:13534;630;"Woody manages to maintain that ""tiebreaker"" level of intensity throughout this film."
I:13534;631;See it for her, but for not much else.
I:13534;632;This is one movie you can watch over and over.
I:13534;633;The acting is superb, story line quite compelling.
I:13534;634;Light a fire, open some wine and enjoy!
I:13534;635;actress involved with Chloe's brother, and the fireworks begin.
I:13534;636;intense, brilliant drama written by Woody Allen that kept me on the edge of my seat!
I:13534;637;I have really liked Woody Allen films .
I:13534;638;But this is a heavy handed revisiting of 'Crimes and Misdemeaners', still one of his very best.
I:13534;639;If the story appeals to you by all means see Crimes and Mis.
I:13534;640;A much better, more subtle, more troubling, more rewarding film.
I:13534;641;Mr. Allen is back in true form with this off the wall British potboiler about wealth, privilege and how a man can become a monster.
I:13534;642;He chooses to do great evil rather then face his own demons, great evil being to do irreparable harm to people who have done nothing to him and do not, by any means, deserve there fate.
I:13534;643;There is a macabre fascination with watching this film a second or third time, we can see the tragic tale unfolding, the scratchy opera soundtrack lets us know that tragedy is coming (and I don't know an opera from a pop tart).
I:13534;644;This is a quiet, well.
I:13534;645;made shocker, which I can watch, over and over again and see new things.
I:13534;646;the bright spots of this film are the London scenery and the touching performance of Emily Mortimer, who played Wilton's wife.
I:13534;647;Of course the cast and setting make this a very stylish film, but Meyers became more impressive the second time around.
I:13534;648;Allen's philosophy about the luck of life rings very true here.
I:13534;649;Scarlett was exceedingly sexy, I've never seen her look so tempting.
I:13534;650;makes me think of an Oscar win for its brilliant, and structured script.
I:13534;651;I've never known Woody to be so precisely brilliant.
I:13534;652;Many critics have viewed this work as proof of the fading director's resurrection.
I:13534;653;I view it as a piece of solid storytelling from a great director.
I:13534;654;His films contain ironic humor and great dialog that you cannot help but admire this 70.
I:13534;655;Allen expands his views, and the result is one working combination of new locations charm and variety.
I:13534;656;"That fact made ""Match Point"" even more likable."
I:13534;657;Match Point is a story about love, passion and coincidence.
I:13534;658;New heat is more interesting than his life with his wife Chloe (doll.
I:13534;659;The passion becomes so powerful and overwhelming that it will have a huge impact on what will happen next.
I:13534;660;Ball is definitely back at this old saxophonist's court!
I:13534;661;What a work of art!
I:13534;662;There exists an erroneous notion among the majority of the aesthetic audience that great artists will inevitably produce great works.
I:13534;663;"The House of Mirth and ""The Age of Innocence"" stand out almost like flukes in the career of Edith Wharton
I:13534;664;This rich and complex moral tale is woven in the fine, subtle threads of a great novel.
I:13534;665;"It explicates its themes in frank but poetic observations: the fall of a tennis ball caught in the net becomes the very notion of chance
I:13534;666;Allen is in full form here, writing characters whose tastes and actions say much more about them than they'd ever say about themselves, and guiding actors to inject into each character an inner life, displayed in fleeting glances and tilts of the head.
I:13534;667;"Like a great novel, ""Match Point"" contains not a word misplaced
I:13534;668;Match Point is a similarly illustrative tale: this one is meant to demostrate that life is governed by chance.
I:13534;669;"the work in Allen's ouvre whose theme ""Match Point"" most clearly echoes."
I:13534;670;Match Point is a Dreiserian melodrama composed with the musical clarity of top.
I:13534;671;Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Chris, has an incredible sensuousness in his face and demeanor, and uses it to convey his character's crass materialism vividly.
I:13534;672;Johansson makes Nola, a character simultaneously aware of, and willing to use, her impact on men and yet still quite reserved about doing so, believable.
I:13534;673;Emily Mortimer, as Chris's girlfriend and later wife Chloe, is both vivacious and kind, both sweet and needy.
I:13534;674;She is the film's most easily empathizable character, but one no less difficult to grasp than Chris or Nola, and Mortimer does a fantastic job.
I:13534;675;And, as is usual with an Allen film, the cinematography is superb and the staging very natural.
I:13534;676;Altogether, Allen and his cast and crew create a world that is both lived.
I:13534;677;Match Point is both intellectually engaging and tremendously entertaining, like the work of Fitzgerald or Dostoevsky.
I:13534;678;It is realism in its purest, most rewarding form.
I:13534;679;"woody Allen has submitted his masterpiece in ""Match Point."""
I:13534;680;It recalls themes long embedded in his work, but synthesizes them into an altogether realistic and altogether original film.
I:13534;681;Let us now lay any remaining doubt of Allen's genius to rest.
I:13534;682;Match Point is proof that Woody Allen is an artist of the highest order.
I:13534;683;Woody Allen at his finest and rarest form.
I:13534;684;It may be a bit too talkative for some, but if you get deep into this movie and give it your full attention, you will see one of the best thrillers ever made.
I:13534;685;I still watch all his films in the theater, but with each passing year I seem to be more and more alone, and I can't say I blame the viewing public.
I:13534;686;Perfectly cast and beautifully acted, this film's London location is one of its strongest assists.
I:13534;687;what makes this film special is Allen's masterful direction.
I:13534;688;The dialogue is crisp and the story is superbly plotted.
I:13534;689;scarlett Johansson gives what may be her best performance.
I:13534;690;Ferociously sexy yet subtly coy, she dominates every scene in which she appears.
I:13534;691;"Woody Allen in his long sojourn to London found a new genre for him, the suspense lust thriller, when he wrote and directed the superb film ""Match Point"" (2005) He also developed there the thriller ""Cassandra's Dream"" with Colin Farrell."
I:13534;692;With brilliant photography and gorgeous scenes of London he depicts the life of a tennis semi.
I:13534;693;pro Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a handsome devil with sensual lips, who volleys himself into a life of wealth married to Chloe, the daughter of a moneyed family presided over by father Brian Cox in a thankless role.
I:13534;694;chris is introduced into the family by a young man, Tom, something of a cad and a wastrel, to whom he's giving tennis lessons.
I:13534;695;The wealthy scion has a stunning girlfriend, Nola, (again with sensuous lips) a would.
I:13534;696;What is newly rich Chris going to do?
I:13534;697;He and Nola are two of a kind, both schemers and opportunists.
I:13534;698;most of the movie is taken up with the smoldering passions of Chris and Nola and his devious tricks to find time with his mistress.
I:13534;699;Suspense, Hitchcockian, keeps building in the film.
I:13534;700;The soundtrack has arias from famous operas, often old scratchy ones, that provide a brilliant backdrop to the action and maneuvering of Chris.
I:13534;701;The ending is full of twists and turns and some really clever bits.
I:13534;702;Luck plays an important role in Chris's life.
I:13534;703;With this movie Woody Allen opened up new territory and gave us a fine motion picture.
I:13534;704;A really well made movie with an unconventional spin on luck and morality.
I:13534;705;Scarlett is seductive as always and the whole thing is well scripted, well acted, well filmed .
I:13534;706;this time done without his trademark humor and woody in an acting role.
I:13534;707;great movie, and great performances, but best not to consider the moral implications.
I:13534;708;Also his language for the British has a strong american flavor.
I:13534;709;Because in this flick, all the main characters were opera buffs.
I:13534;710;And I thought it was clever.
I:13534;711;Along with other things, Allen has a genius for picking his soundtracks.
I:13534;712;I thought it was brilliantly directed with all the actors doing tremendous jobs with in this case until the plot started moving not much to do a tremendous job with.
I:13534;713;I highly recommend it with the admonition, don't give up.
I:13534;714;"I liked ""Mighty Aphrodite"" but that was because of Mira Sorvino and ""Sweet and Lowdown"" was good, but had a lot of faults."
I:13534;715;The movie takes a few minutes to achieve it's balance and once it does, it's pure entertainment.
I:13534;716;It's smart, it's got style, great acting, and a good script.
I:13534;717;"The dialouge is also very good and I don't know if I'd consider the film ""noir"" as it's been called by a few people."
I:13534;718;Rhys Meyers, in a really good performance, plays Chris.
I:13534;719;Chloe is sweet and loving and will bring Tom success and fortune.
I:13534;720;Nola is sensuous, gorgeous, and exciting.
I:13534;721;After about an hour into this movie, I thought I had it pegged.
I:13534;722;The movie has some great scenes, the first scene in the bar with Chris and Nola is really good.
I:13534;723;The dialouge here is just spectacular.
I:13534;724;"The scene with the ring is well filmed and I love the ending, although it's not ""one of the best endings in recent years"" or anything."
I:13534;725;I also want to bring up Johansson's performance.
I:13534;726;She's a great actress, but takes a lot of roles where she doesn't really get to show us how good she is (The Island for example).
I:13534;727;So this is a nice change of pace for her.
I:13534;728;It comes close once or twice, but that's it.
I:13534;729;But, anyway, this is probably one of Allen's best films and it's certainly a triumph after a series of movies which have tanked both commerically and critically.
I:13534;730;I love surprise endings and if you do too, this is the movie for you!
I:13534;731;All the actors did a fantastic job and this is one of Woody Allen's best.
I:13534;732;He plays his role perfectly as if the part was made specifically for him.
I:13534;733;I love all of the movies John participates in.
I:13534;734;He just electrifies the screen.
I:13534;735;This film is simply great!
I:13534;736;And Scarlett Johansson is excellent as the extreme BITCH!
I:13534;737;Very well done and the London setting and photography is very impressive.
I:13534;738;One of his pupils is Tom Hewlett, the playboy son of a wealthy family.
I:13534;739;The two hit it off (they both share a love of opera).
I:13534;740;It seems that Chris is about to find himself in an exceedingly comfortable lifestyle.
I:13534;741;the movie is stylish without a doubt.

I:13534;744;this is a sleeper of a movie in that it is a rich character study one which would have served the audiance better had the rolls been reversed and the wonderful Matthew Goode had the lead roll as Chris Wilton.

I:13534;746;He describes the game of tennis as luck, that once in a while the ball will hit the net.
I:13534;747;Woddy Allen sets up a dilemma for our main character that raises the question between love and lust, and luck and fate.
I:13534;748;The brilliant aspect of the film, is that there is no score.
I:13534;749;Allen uses opera to structure the scenes, since it is the one thing that ties Chris to the family.
I:13534;750;The opera changes in tone and emotion as the scene does, so it works to perfection.
I:13534;751;The film is interesting, you may find yourself debating about what happens in the end, but you realize it all ties in with what this movie is about.
I:13534;752;The film plot is something that you'd expect from Hitchcock, and it is a savory one at that.
I:13534;753;The movie is entertaining and thought provoking even if it doesn't seem plausible at times.
I:13534;754;He does a fantatsic job with what Woody Allen gives him.
I:13534;755;Scarlett Johansson is perfectly cast as the temptress, and she even gives her somewhat commercial character a human side as well.
I:13534;756;Great acting, even though the dialogue is stilted at times.
I:13534;757;bOTTOM LINE: The film will lead you one way only to make a sharp left and take you where you wouldn't expect.
I:13534;758;The film is intelligent and an interesting watch, but it really doesn't boast any technical highlights.
I:13534;759;and the result is a riveting movie, buoyed by the strong performances of every actor in this movie (Scarlett Johansson, Johnathan Rhys.

I:13534;762;"He is by now married to Chloe and the marriage comes with an arranged job, a cushy new lifestyle and plenty of other quite appealing benefits, especially for a man without ""prospects"", someone used to working hard to get by."
I:13534;763;It is both amusing and horrifying and it makes for one very good film.
I:13534;764;It is the best Woody Allen film I've seen in years.
I:13534;765;Somehow it all comes together in this film and it all seems to work.
I:13534;766;i was riveted by watching the chemistry between Chris and Nola and I wondered how far he'd go for his passions and how much he'd risk for her.
I:13534;767;There were moments of true surprise.
I:13534;768;The cast is pretty good but something about it just spoke to me and it said I really don't want to even attempt to watch this movie.
I:13534;769;I would actually recommend this movie because what Meyers does at the end is shocking and it makes this film worth sitting through.
I:13534;770;written film moves quickly through its main character's rise and fall in a distinctly American story of success and the soul.
I:13534;771;this is a sharp, challenging entertainment for the discerning viewer, whether a fan of Allen's earlier work or not.
I:13534;772;Chris, a professional tennis player who recently moved to London, befriends rich boy Tom and marries his sister.
I:13534;773;Its so unfair that he becomes the winner in the end, but hey, maybe the movie wants us to believe that life is actually unfair.
I:13534;774;After several decades of shooting intriguing comedies, dramas, and mutations of the two, Woody Allen has eventually reached the point where he again reinvents himself.
I:13534;775;His newest film, Match Point, might be one of his very best, as it definitely is his best within the last decade.

I:13534;777;Nonetheless, he has repeatedly displayed his intellect in regards to athletics and sports in a thoughtfully intelligent manner.
I:13534;778;It is an intriguing notion that luck often has decisive power of a situation such as it can determine the outcome of a tennis game.
I:13534;779;Wilton, once born into Irish poverty, has now been fortunate to make ends meet through tennis while many of the people in his working environment have the privilege to enjoy the birthright of wealth and social status.
I:13534;780;He befriends the rich Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) by becoming his coaching tennis partner, and eventually Wilton finds himself invited to an opera.
I:13534;781;It leaves him with a deep personal predicament, as he must confront his own greed and lust, which he begins to rationalize in his own favor.
I:13534;782;The film also has a slight tone of Robert Bresson with its unique minimalist approach, which augments the minute actions and incidents within the story.
I:13534;783;Allen never says what is right or wrong through the film, he simply lets the camera capture the truth.
I:13534;784;It is both refreshing and horrid, as the minimalism enhances the offensive nature of the story and compels the audience to ponder the morality of Wilton's situation.
I:13534;785;The film also provides an interesting perspective of how luck ambiguously affects people's lives, as Allen exhaustively presents an emotional drama that intentionally keeps its distance to the audience in order for the viewer to dwell on the concepts presented.
I:13534;786;There he meets a wealthy family, befriends the son and romances the daughter.
I:13534;787;"good story
I:13534;788;The movie changed completely and I loved it.
I:13534;789;This Woody Allen film has been rightly compared with Hitchcock's work.
I:13534;790;"Indeed, Chris is quite similar to Ray Milland's character inDial M for Murder
I:13534;791;While both Meyers and Johansson underplay their parts and have little chemistry together, the story is so good that I thoroughly enjoyed it.
I:13534;792;"The movie is expertly directed and has a strong British supporting cast
I:13534;793;Like most Woody Allen films MATCH POINT is confessional and semi.
I:13534;794;Johanssen is the Golden Woman, a tempestuous, beautiful dream.
I:13534;795;His final choice is explosive and shocking, and leaves everyone's life ineradicably altered.
I:13534;796;one year old actress carries this demanding and mature role very well.
I:13534;797;The actng was a little bit corny but I enjoyed the movie.
I:13534;798;It did have a good story line and enjoyed Miss Johansson's performance.
I:13534;799;Woody Allen's directing and screenplay (Oscar.
I:13534;800;nominated screenplay and has won 3 oscars, thus far) are awesome.
I:13534;801;One of the finest films in recent history.
I:13534;802;Jonathan Rhys Meyers' and Scarlett Johansson's performances are excellent.
I:13534;803;The opera music that is used in the background is excellent.
I:13534;804;"The cinematography by Remi Adefarasin (he, ironic did the cinematography to ""In Good Company"" (2004) which also stars Johansson and nominated for an Oscar for her work on ""Elizabeth"" (1998) is excellent."
I:13534;805;The film editing by Alisa Lepselter (who has film edited Allen's films for the last 7 years) is excellent.
I:13534;806;The production design by Jim Clay is excellent.
I:13534;807;The set decoration by Caroline Smith is excellent.
I:13534;808;The costume design by Jill Taylor is excellent.

I:13534;811;the film takes the first hour to set the scene, but I can set it for you in one sentence: social climber meets a rich boy with a elligable sister and a hot fiancee.

I:13534;814;I did find it intense when the hero's luck is running out, and the final twist is unexpected, but after an hour and a half of this snooze.
I:13534;815;This is one of my favorites.
I:13534;816;The casting was great, as well as, the entertaining story plot.
I:13534;817;"The ""irish"" guy sounded like he was born and bred in Surrey."
I:13534;818;This is a scathing portrait of love, yearning, and adultery.
I:13534;819;A heartbreaking portrait of sincerity versus deceit.
I:13534;820;i am far from a Woody Allen fan, but this is his crowning achievement.
I:13534;821;ups, the architecture of London are all superb.
I:13534;822;He illustrates the importance of luck by showing a tennis ball striking the tape at the top of the net.
I:13534;823;When Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), discovers she likes Chris he is invited to the family home.
I:13534;824;Match Point is one of those movies where it takes a while for you to discover what it is about, even with the help given by the opening shot and narration.
I:13534;825;Match Point certainly leaves things wide open as to what he will do next, especially now that he has once again caught our attention.
I:13534;826;"allen understands the principle that the way to create the most suspense is to let the audience in on the ""secret"" (Doris Day waiting for the cymbal player in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"") so that the fun comes with waiting to see how things play out."

I:13534;829;the last half hour or so, when the plot unfolds with this annoying opera aria on the sound track (it adds to the agita, but you may want to reach for your mute button and turn on the English subtitles), ranks with the best stuff Allen's ever done (and we haven't seen much of his best lately), and he even tacks on one of those tongue.
I:13534;830;"cheek ""feel good"" endings Hitchcock opted for (""Vertigo,"" ""Psycho,"" and those monologues at the end of his tv shows)."
I:13534;831;The acting and settings are fantastic.
I:13534;832;She's so amazing I don't even care that she's worked with Woody Allen.
I:13534;833;But I've been entertained by every movie she's done.
I:13534;834;She does that well, LOL!She's a true joy to watch.
I:13534;835;I was drawn into the story, and even (somewhat) sympathetic to the dilemma of the main character.
I:13534;836;Match Point is a great film.
I:13534;837;It is a step above and beyond most films released these days.
I:13534;838;the film, at it's heart, is about the meaning of life.
I:13534;839;Match Point takes the stance that unpredictable luck is one of the biggest factors in life.
I:13534;840;If it goes forward, you win the point.
I:13534;841;Therefore the game has a clear set of rules.
I:13534;842;The movie had an interesting story line, with some twists and turns I didn't expect.
I:13534;843;,I bought it to return it to him!
I:13534;844;It is a great movie!
I:13534;845;But days later you find yourself still thinking of it and appreciating it more and more.
I:13534;846;I loved the London scenery.
I:13534;847;I loved the music, and the moments throughout the movie that had me on the edge of my seat.
I:13534;848;The love scenes between Rhys.
I:13534;849;And I even loved the fact that there wasn't a single likeable person in the entire film.
I:13534;850;I found this movie to be very compelling.
I:13534;851;I'm a big opera fan, so I loved the soundtrack.
I:13534;852;allen's writing about a world where he's an outsider and it shows.
I:13534;853;type Allen loves and knows all too well, and she brings out the best in him as a writer and director.
I:13534;854;Woody Allen's cities are aesthetically and culturally beautiful environments for the rich.
I:13534;855;it is beyond love, death or life itself .
I:13534;856;it is the story of how can you kill a girl because you are loving her more than yourself.
I:13534;857;it is a new turn for woody as awriter and a new style to direct with.
I:13534;858;it ain,t perfect but it is very good thanks for the acting .
I:13534;859;a great plot to set in a romantic movie.
I:13534;860;"the best date movie in 2005 after ""the 40 year old virgin""!"
I:13534;861;You will see some very nice shots of London in this film.
I:13534;862;So the movie does stir emotions in you as you watch it, the feeling of tension.
I:13534;863;chris marries sweet and loving Chloe, played by Emily Mortimer, in order to acquire a life of wealth and success.
I:13534;864;He is so filled with obsession and ambition that you can feel the tension coming off the screen.
I:13534;865;the secondary characters play their parts a whole lot better.
I:13534;866;What IS good about this, is that the dialogue is impeccable.
I:13534;867;Not groundbreaking, mind you, but certainly a cut above the rest, to be sure.
I:13534;868;His great beauty apart, this was a hollow performance.
I:13534;869;woody Allen is a great writer and film.
I:13534;870;maker, but I think that 'Scoop' that came after this was definitely a far superior film.
I:13534;871;England has never looked this inviting.
I:13534;872;Just when you think you have pegged Woody Allen to a certain type of film, he surprises everyone with a film like this.
I:13534;873;Working at a video story, I found some of the conversations that I heard right around Match Point's theatrical release interesting.
I:13534;874;Then, Nola reenters the picture, and her flame with Chris ignites again.
I:13534;875;When Nola becomes pregnant, the real suspense begins.
I:13534;876;"What is Chris to do?Woody Allen crafts an ending that is the perfect example of how to use a ""twist ending"" that is so often misused by filmmakers and writers."
I:13534;877;The film is so well written, so well put together, and so well acted.
I:13534;878;Meyers is the perfect person for this role, and he almost reminds me of a cleaner, well.
I:13534;879;Hopefully he can follow this one up with something equally as good, if not better.
I:13534;880;Match Point is emotionally, physically, and psychologically tense from beginning to end, always one step ahead of the viewer.
I:13534;881;Match Point is one of 2005's best films, and a triumph for Woody Allen.
I:13534;882;The acting is uniformly excellent, the sets and panoramic views are magnificent and really show off the best of modern London, the pace works well, and the drama gradually sucks you in.
I:13534;883;over about the fact that in tennis sometimes the ball catches in the top of the net.
I:13534;884;chris is quickly seduced both by Chloe and by the life of wealth and comfort which her family offers.

I:13534;886;"emily Mortimer is in great danger of getting typecast as the nice girl who falls badly for a man who lets her down, but perhaps this is because, as in ""Sleeping Dictionary"" and ""Young Adam,"" she plays this roles very well."
I:13534;887;besides Rhys Meyers, Johanssen, and Mortimer, the rest of the cast are excellent, including James Nesbitt as a police detective.
I:13534;888;the biggest issue which many people, especially those who know London well, will have with the film is the credibility of the conclusion.
I:13534;889;overall this was a clever and stylish film.
I:13534;890;endearing beginning suddenly started paying off, I felt myself being drug in yanked by the lapels almost growing more and more engrossed and captivated by the story and the characters with each passing second.
I:13534;891;, but somehow it's all so very poetic .
I:13534;892;Masterful writing, a beautiful setting, and a perfectly fitting soundtrack make this a must see!
I:13534;893;*Blue Jasmine is still probably my favorite Woody Allen film, but this now makes a very close second!
I:13534;894;My heart bleeds for these characters.
I:13534;895;And with that, farewell, or dasvidaniya, whichever you prefer.
I:13534;896;fINAL NOTE: People are afraid to face how great a part of selecting a film is dependent on luck.
I:13534;897;With a little luck, it goes forward, and you win.
I:13534;898;woody Allen is a genius.
I:13534;899;He has made both a film and a fine piece of kindling.
I:13534;900;Seriously though, this is his longest film to date, and it is good fortune I'm getting this one out the way.
I:13534;901;"i'm off to watch ""Drive"", a good movie."
I:13534;902;fINAL NOTE: If you like the film, good for you.
I:13534;903;With great casting, solid performances, and interesting characters I was somehow unsure how I left the theater feeling somewhat cheated.
I:13534;904;"Because of Woody Allen's success with ""Match Point"" at the Cannes Film Festival, I had high hopes of Allen returning to his former glory."
I:13534;905;"As it is though, ""Match Point"" creates a new category of Allen misstep: the quasi."
I:13534;906;"allen's serious films like ""Interiors,"" ""Another Woman"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" to name a few are some of his best work."
I:13534;907;"But ""Match Point,"" set in England and starring a gorgeous Scarlett Johansson as Nola and a strange, distant, demonic Jonathan Rhys."
I:13534;908;In the process, Allen somehow transforms the usually warm and glowing Johansson into a shrew.
I:13534;909;Match Point is beautifully shot and the friction between the dyed in the wool New Yorker Allen's attitude and the Stiff Upper Lip very British Cast creates an interesting, even electric milieu.
I:13534;910;One of his students is a wealthy man about his age, who takes an immediate liking to Chris, especially when he finds Chris is fond of opera.
I:13534;911;He invites Chris to the opera to share his family's box.

I:13534;913;Chris seems to be real happy and since Cloe's family likes Chris too, Cloe's father offers Chris a high level job in one of his companies.
I:13534;914;i liked this movie from start to finish.
I:13534;915;It is well acted and directed and it shows that no matter how much somebody gets they still want more.
I:13534;916;She has a brother named Tom Hewett played by the great Matthew Goode (Imagaine Me and You, Chasing Liberty) who is engaged to his fiancee Nola Rice played by the gorgeous Scarlett Johansson who is an American Actress.
I:13534;917;The two find themselves in a heated love story that takes elements of 2004's Closer, the gritty dark persona of human life in Unfaithful, and the ridiculous and moronic elite of any Oscar Wilde play.
I:13534;918;The story starts with the introduction of pretty boy Chris Wilton .
I:13534;919;a successful tennis pro that comes to teach London's wealthy residents.
I:13534;920;In a seemingly happy and surreal attempt at a marriage, the white road is offset by an affair Chris decides to attempt with Nola (Johansson) .
I:13534;921;allen takes the simple, standard love affair of Match Point and strikes it repeatedly with twists both on an emotional platform and on the usual thrill ride that is offered at most of film's carnivals.
I:13534;922;For the first time in ages, Allen dives deep into the characters and reveals an almost neo.
I:13534;923;everything works here, and the film bites both the heart and the lips.
I:13534;924;It's tense, bewildering, and all at once exciting to the point where the viewer is as unsure of what will happen next as the characters are with their own choices.
I:13534;925;Great developments in the themes of guilt and conscience are presented, and while the love story may have some smiling, the conclusion, and rather dark underbelly of the film, will have others dwindling.
I:13534;926;match Point is without a doubt one of the finest films of its genre and one of the first.
I:13534;927;"There is something here both recognizable and new

I:13534;930;But then Chris meets meets Nola, the girlfriend of his potentially future brother.
I:13534;931;For men, sexual attraction is very high on their list if not at the top.
I:13534;932;Think about it: Chris is attractive, already a successful tennis player, could make a decent living as a tennis pro and is sharp enough to do any number of things.
I:13534;933;Still, this is just a fun quibble.
I:13534;934;MATCH POINT is a good film and I'm glad to see Woody Allen back making good films once again.
I:13534;935;I thought it was the best Woody film ever.
I:13534;936;All my intellectual friends go on and on about WA films.
I:13534;937;and WA added some great twists to the movie.

I:13534;940;"It makes one think deeply about the characters' motivations, and about the interactions between their ""ideals"", their needs, their perceptions of the practicalities of their lives, and their survival instincts."
I:13534;941;"but more important, without giving away too much of the plot, is how interesting the way Woody Allen drives the underlying theme, of how much randomness (or ""luck"" if you prefer) there is in life, to an ""unconventional"" end."

I:13534;949;Nola, an aspiring actress also from the wrong side of the tracks, is sexy and enticing in a way Chloe could never aspire to be, and Chris soons finds himself obsessed with Nola even as he still courts Chloe.
I:13534;950;"The film could have been tightened a little, particularly toward the middle, but ""Match Point"" still ranks as the most intelligent and thought."
I:13534;951;"There is very little humor, however, in ""Match Point,"" and the ending is so corrosively cynical that some viewers may have trouble digesting it."
I:13534;952;Scarlett Johansson may well be the most interesting young actress in movies today, as well as the sexiest, and Rhys.
I:13534;953;meyers oozes reptilian charm as Chris.

I:13534;956;Chloe's heart is set on marrying Chris .
I:13534;957;For Chris, it's the chance of a lifetime.
I:13534;958;"Match Point recalls writer/director Woody Allen's earlier and greater film ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", but with attractive young stars and a focus on the role luck plays in its characters' fates."
I:13534;959;But the cast is talented and attractive.
I:13534;960;Match Point isn't a great film, but it's enjoyable.

I:13534;966;Nola and Chris will have one encounter, but she disappears once Tom and her split.

I:13534;968;He murderes Nola, makes it look like a burglary, and, strangely enough, gets away with it even though he's questioned by the police with a telltale diary.

I:13534;973;I think its an excellent movie regardless if you're a WA fan or not.
I:13534;974;This movie was pretty good.
I:13534;975;Thus begins Woody Allen's newest and one of his most brilliant movies Match Point.
I:13534;976;Reminiscent of the truly brilliant Crimes and Misdemeanors, Match Point is one of Allen's finest films in the last five years in my opinion.
I:13534;977;But all of his rehearsing is put to the test when he meets a polished young man who brings him to his family home and his sister is smitten with him.
I:13534;978;And now the stage is set for a movie experience fraught with tension as all the while the viewer knows that Allen will provide us not only with a great movie experience but a chance to question our very own morals and the question of luck.
I:13534;979;I wondered as I thought about this movie if the movie might have taken place elsewhere but came to the conclusion that the story lent itself to the English of wealth that England was the perfect place for this film.
I:13534;980;but most of all it was the performances which really made me feel as if these people weren't actors but I had a front row seat into their lives with a pair of good binoculars.
I:13534;981;Ms. Johansson at such a young age captured the essence of the brash Nola and played her with an edge hardly seen today.
I:13534;982;meyers, who recently won a Golden Globe award for his portrayal of Elvis, depicted Chris Wilton with an equal amount of poise and sophistication almost as if he indeed was this character.
I:13534;983;But Match Point most assuredly revived my love for the serious side of Mr. Allen's work.
I:13534;984;Best of all this film has left wanting to see Crimes and Misdemeanors and pondering the moral and ethical questions both movies raise.
I:13534;985;I highly recommend this movie to all.
I:13534;986;She is this aggressive woman who shows a zest for life.
I:13534;987;I have seen this movie before, and think that the characters, and the plot line bring me into an interesting world of society, some which I enjoy, and some, of which I find boring(but interesting).
I:13534;988;thank you for your prompt and courteous service.
I:13534;989;The acting is excellent and we catch a glimpse of British upper society that is not very becoming.
I:13534;990;The Bottom Line:One of the best movies Allen has ever made, Match Point is a fascinating character piece that changes almost imperceptibly into a first.
I:13534;991;"rate thriller
I:13534;992;"Scarlett johansson's got some nice ones 
I:13534;993;This is all fine and dandy, but he already basically the same plot line with Crimes and Misdemeanors.
I:13534;994;the performances and acting are great overall, with Jonathan Rhys and Billy Cox taking the lead.
I:13534;995;Crime and Punishment is a work of great spiritual and psychological detail.
I:13534;996;Moreover, the main character has a much greater moral dilemma to deal with.
I:13534;997;i suppose this kind of movie is considered sophisticated in this day and age, where people don't read or understand literature.
I:13534;998;It only scratches the bare surface of the great Russian novels, and in the end does them a great injustice.
I:13534;999;Match Point is one of those movies.
I:13534;1000;"The ""high class"" backdrop, tennis parallels and allure of Johansson at the center or a romantic tangle all pointed to an intriguing ride."
I:13534;1001;Suspenceful, and definately kept my attention.
I:13534;1002;Scarlett Johansson was fantastic in her role.
I:13534;1003;Jonathan Meyers was also great, and it was the first time I had seen him in anything.
I:13534;1004;Allen's latest film is superb.
I:13534;1005;but a wonderful film none the less.
I:13534;1006;"the film does tend to go on a bit, before the ""murder mystery"" happens, but good performances and a taught story line keep one's interest during this film."
I:13534;1007;no car chases, etc. but a wonderful character study from beginning to end.
I:13534;1008;including a look at how humanity has to live with the choices that they make.
I:13534;1009;The title, I thought, was perfect for the film.
I:13534;1010;I liked that a lot.
I:13534;1011;Charming, British and yet gangly and awkward.
I:13534;1012;Though as I recall, the good things I had heard from my sister.
I:13534;1013;It is probably best noted from her performance in In Good Company, but it surfaced again here.
I:13534;1014;I love subtle references like this, even when, like this one, I have not read the book.
I:13534;1015;i wish I could give Mr. Allen more credit in my thoughts on his work.
I:13534;1016;So many people talk about what the man is able to do and it must be entirely over my head.
I:13534;1017;It also includes a quote that refers to Match Point as one of the most erotic movies in years.
I:13534;1018;Want to watch a great complex film that leaves thoughts bouncing around inside your head?
I:13534;1019;for the first three quarters it is a very interesting tale about the journey of an exTennis pro, turned coach looking for more meaning from life.
I:13534;1020;One is a young woman (Emily Mortimer) from an extremely wealthy and influential family, who is homely and highly available.
I:13534;1021;The other is an extremely sexy out of work actress, Nola Rice (Scarlet Johansson).
I:13534;1022;there is only so much story you can tell on the subject of adultery, and the movie covers it all in an extremely interesting manner.
I:13534;1023;it was just a fantasy, I swear.
I:13534;1024;I thought it was extremely good, and would recommend it to anyone.
I:13534;1025;what just because he finally made another even watchable film.
I:13534;1026;driven scenes in favor of a more plot.
I:13534;1027;if anything, the commercial and critical success of Match Point will hopefully encourage Woody Allen to pursue a disciplined approach to his storytelling in the future.
I:13534;1028;class film, about very universal concepts.
I:13534;1029;occupation with neurosis and synthesizes all into a screenplay that combines all the quirky idiosyncrasies common to rich intellectuals and makes them very believable and full of pathos.
I:13534;1030;This time, I felt genuine emotion for just about everyone (smile).
I:13534;1031;what I loved most about this movie is summarized by the tennis game theory of match point.
I:13534;1032;esteem, joy, and inner peace.
I:13534;1033;such a tragic thought, but a form of justice.
I:13534;1034;It's a solid clue that the movie you just saw was some sort of a masterpiece.
I:13534;1035;As a fan of Allen's movies, I took that as quite a recommendation.
I:13534;1036;"As the movies unfolds and the characters develop, we find ourselves getting involved with the ""hero""."
I:13534;1037;When things do happen quickly, everything we've learned comes into play and we are rewarded for our attentiveness.
I:13534;1038;Match Point is a movie for those who want to be drawn into a dramatic look at the casualties of our passions.
I:13534;1039;"It reminded me of Allen's ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" but even better."
I:13534;1040;This really was a fascinating and engaging flim!
I:13534;1041;It is true is like A Place in the Sun, with a twist, but that didn't detract from it for me.
I:13534;1042;the movie's tension builds slowly toward the conclusion, even getting uncomfortable at times in a darkly comedic manner.
I:13534;1043;There are enough misdirections and surprising twists that my wife and I made several involuntary exclamations, often cracking up afterwards.
I:13534;1044;The movie held our attention right to the end, not out of any sense of greatness, more out of a manipulated sense of morbid curiousity.
I:13534;1045;We chose instead to cast it to our friends and family, telling them to watch it then pass it along, encouraging the recipients to do the same.
I:13534;1046;Match Point is definitely worth watching once.
I:13534;1047;The film is a change from the humor and the landscape that moviegoers have grown accustomed to .
I:13534;1048;This time it is the English landscape with a bit of London haze.
I:13534;1049;Indeed, Match Point possesses elements of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller, and a little bit romantic entanglement that one would see on a daytime soap opera.
I:13534;1050;However, the most interesting part of the film is the core theme of wealth and prestige, and the cultural aesthetics that go along with it .
I:13534;1051;the game of tennis and a rich taste for the arts.
I:13534;1052;rounded good guy who is supportive of his friends.
I:13534;1053;woody Allen produces a meticulous film that ends with a clean finish.
I:13534;1054;The screenplay and the production are excellent, and Allen probably takes from literary master Dostoevsky in shaping the character of Chris.
I:13534;1055;The sound track is impeccable.
I:13534;1056;Instead of old jazz or pop standards that usual covet the background music of a Woody Allen film, one distinguishable vintage operatic piece as well as others accompanies intense moments in the film.
I:13534;1057;overall, the film is recommended for those who like a little suspense in a movie.
I:13534;1058;The film is a little lengthy, but the enticing plotline will make up for the time.
I:13534;1059;out scene in the rain, watched it again, now have a new appreciation of this film, much better than my memory of it from 2006.
I:13534;1060;Scarlett was sizzling in this film, I loved it.
I:13534;1061;.4 IMHO, Worth a 2nd look.
I:13534;1062;This film has a great international supporting cast lead by Brian Cox and Emily Mortimer.
I:13534;1063;Woody gives you a great feeling of London, this is always a plus in his films.
I:13534;1064;It wasn't boring, and I found the plot engaging enough.
I:13534;1065;If Woody Allen is morally depraved enough to glorify unpunished murderers, let him, but as far as this viewer is concerned his loyal fans of his can have him.
I:13534;1066;"However with ""Match Point"" good ol' Woody seems to be making his way to a successful comeback as the beloved writer and director he has always been."
I:13534;1067;Match Point is a delicate and elegant thriller that has kept me tied to my chair expectantly for its ultimate resolution.
I:13534;1068;The movie has a particular style, very much a. la Hitchcock but still faithful to Allen's own genius.
I:13534;1069;Consistent with Allen's work in NYC, the city of London plays a starring role in the movie and is funny to see how an American director ends up making such a beutiful portrait of a city not quite praised by its own children.
I:13534;1070;meyers delivers an impressive performance as the ambitious and young American tennis promise who relocates to London in search of success and ends up marrying the daughter of a wealthy entrepeneur.
I:13534;1071;The film has a beautiful photography, a superb script and casting, an encompassing an consistent rhythm both in direction as well as in the plot's evolution.
I:13534;1072;"And finally, a spectacular music with stunningly beautiful opera pieces like ""Una furtiva lacrima"" from L'elisir d'amore by Gaetano Donizetti, and other masterpieces from Il Trovatore, La Traviata, Rigoletto, Macbeth."
I:13534;1073;I just loved this movie and it is definitely good to have Woody back.
I:13534;1074;Woody's often made films as an homage to his favorite directors.
I:13534;1075;One, maybe two were enough to keep a Hitchcock plot interesting.
I:13534;1076;"I thought ""Match Point"" was a routine thriller, with some fine performances (especially Emily Mortimer), but I'm not compelled to watch it again."
I:13534;1077;But a great story, great music and certainly an intense film.
I:13534;1078;For 90 minutes one keeps hoping that a twist of plot, a stunningly revealed detail, or a leap forward in portraiture will propel the film out of first gear.
I:13534;1079;The world knows Woody Allen can be a clever conversationalist, but in this film only a few of Penelope Wilton's lines are truly amusing.
I:13534;1080;enough to positively delight in confronting rejection.
I:13534;1081;"Much has been written about him as an ""acquired taste"" and, certainly after 20 years of wrestling with acquiring it, one can see that the self."
I:13534;1082;"As a Brit, but lover of all things New Yorker, I really wanted this to be a clever take on English manners
I:13534;1083;brit leads supported by some surprisingly distinguished Brit actors who should have had the professional maturity to recognise a tin.
I:13534;1084;The only (though considerable) redeeming feature is Scarlet Johanssen, whose performance uniquely rises above the confines of a headachingly.
I:13534;1085;Save your money and treat your eyeballs to a decent piece of entertainment .
I:13534;1086;"like, perhaps, ""Howl's Moving Castle"", which is altogether more satisfying and (alarmingly enough) more credible."
I:13534;1087;For the sake of her career I hope she is not misled by any further specious offers of big.
I:13534;1088;she is capable of so much better than this and in any case already has triple.
I:13534;1089;pleeeease stick to what you do best and give us more footnotes on New York life.
I:13534;1090;So maybe it's a fair analogy.
I:13534;1091;He's usually derivative and self.
I:13534;1092;Scarlett Johansson is yummy in the Glenn Close role, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers makes a pretty good Jude Law, although the rise of his character Chris from tennis teacher to business magnate is underexplained.
I:13534;1093;She's earnest and bewildered in just the right combination, and stands out as an actor in this cast.
I:13534;1094;"but it is flat, humorless, and has no intriguing or sympathetic characters
I:13534;1095;Any type of romantic film, be it comedy or tragedy, must capture, at least, the attention of the audience by making the characters interesting.
I:13534;1096;Usually we feel sympathy for the lovers and wish them well.
I:13534;1097;The brother of Chris' wife, Chloe, made the best decision of his life when he dumped her.
I:13534;1098;Perhaps the interesting ending saves the film but still I have some reservations.
I:13534;1099;certainly a film that keeps your attention.
I:13534;1100;And to top it all off, he gets away with everything!!
I:13534;1101;Sorry folks who think this is a good movie, but its not!
I:13534;1102;There he meets Tom's sister Chloe Hewett Wilton (the always excellent Emily Mortimer) and she's immediately smitten.
I:13534;1103;this being a co. production with BBC films and a love letter to London the cast is full of amazing UK actors in roles of varying sizes.
I:13534;1104;where it goes might be hard for some people to watch, but it's an amazing film, well.
I:13534;1105;written, acted, directed and far from the standard Woody Allen film in every way.
I:13534;1106;I am a connoisseur of Woody Allen films and this is the best one yet!
I:13534;1107;Scarlett Johansson is really believable and Woody plays the well.
I:13534;1108;and that includes its dazzling stars and brilliant director/writer, there's one thing I can't get past.
I:13534;1109;"and ""Match Point"" is certainly vastly superior to the hackneyed ""Wimbledon""."
I:13534;1110;Great movie , I was surprised by the ending and I was even more was surprised that it was directed by Woody Allen
I:13534;1111;"In ""Match Point,"" Woody Allen, caught in one of his more ""serious"" moods, takes a simple tale about marital infidelity and turns it into something complex and fascinating."
I:13534;1112;But if you can go with the flow, you will be delighted by all the little ironies Allen throws at us in the final stages of the story, which help to underline the filmmaker's thesis that, for all the efforts we make to control our lives, The Fickle Finger of Fate .
I:13534;1113;always has the final word.
I:13534;1114;allen has written dialogue that is incisive, intelligent and literate, and the performances he's drawn from the likes of Rhys.
I:13534;1115;meyers, Goode, Emily Mortimer, Scarlett Johannson and Penelope Wilton are superb down to the tiniest detail.
I:13534;1116;Allen keeps his camera tightly focused on his characters, rarely pulling away from them much beyond a middle distance, keeping us firmly locked in the near.
I:13534;1117;Here is a movie that demands patience at the beginning but that really sneaks up on you the longer you watch it.
I:13534;1118;"guided by the hands of a master, ""Match Point"" is one of Allen's finest films in years."
I:13534;1119;I totally agree with Nichols of L. a. MATCH POINT was the best picture of 2005.
I:13534;1120;"In this newest venture he packages it as ""it is better to be lucky than good."""
I:13534;1121;Story is interesting and held my attention, but I was shocked in the end.
I:13534;1122;Crimes and Misdemeanors is brilliant, and eliminates the need for this movie altogether.2) The plot, and character motivations, display too many holes in order to arrive at the punchline.
I:13534;1123;I'm a tennis player, and I'm in this love triangle.
I:13534;1124;But it would be much more interesting to do away with the one I really love.
I:13534;1125;"The guilt thing is a blast!"""
I:13534;1126;I'm a beautiful woman, and this guy is madly in love with me.
I:13534;1127;The entire movie audience is pulling for me.
I:13534;1128;What makes the movie somewhat sickening is the realism of the murders.
I:13534;1129;nonetheless, the movie is well crafted.
I:13534;1130;The dialogue seems real, and that's a Woodie Allen strength that few can match.
I:13534;1131;While I thought the writing (especially for Johansson's character) could have been stronger, Johnathan Rhys Meyers was amazing and believable.
I:13534;1132;His power and diversity as an actor is always impressive.
I:13534;1133;"It's a bit like ""A Place in the Sun"", with a twist here and there."
I:13534;1134;Luck trumps all in Match Point, the brilliantly dark latest film by director Woody Allen.
I:13534;1135;for Match Point, Allen leaves his comfort zone of neurotic comedy and New York City to explore the dramatic possibilities of grey, upper class London.
I:13534;1136;The result: a story with a twist unlike any Allen has told before.
I:13534;1137;Meyers acts with such menace that it will thoroughly shock fans of Bend It Like Beckham, in which Meyers plays the amazingly perfect heartthrob coach of a women's soccer team.
I:13534;1138;chris reads Dostoevsky and plays his hand to its greatest advantage, wooing a sweet rich girl, Chloe (Emily Mortimer).
I:13534;1139;The provocative and attractive nature of the actors enhances the passion between Wilton and Rice, and the chemistry between Meyers and Johansson is undeniable.
I:13534;1140;Most comes in the form of subtle cracks at the excessive nature of the upper class lifestyle.
I:13534;1141;Nineteenth century opera on scratchy early twentieth century recordings provides a fitting score and gives the film a classically old but treasured vibe.
I:13534;1142;And Match Point is a classic in its own right, proving that even well into his prime, Woody Allen still has some luck in him yet.
I:13534;1143;This is one of the great dark movies by Woody Allen where the handsome but unprincipled hero gets away with murder.
I:13534;1144;with Matchpoint, it seems that Allen has decided to take a deep breath and delve back into the dark side.
I:13534;1145;Instead of Angelica Huston, now Allen gives us the biggest gun of all, the incomparably gorgeous Scarlett Johansson.
I:13534;1146;This movie came in great condition In good speed.
I:13534;1147;We love this movie so in all it was a great experience using this seller.
I:13534;1148;On one hand, I enjoyed the characters and the acting was good.
I:13534;1149;They marry and Meyers gets a cushy job working for his father.
I:13534;1150;The movie was good enough to get me to care about Meyers.
I:13534;1151;Could you give up the taste of privilege for something as meaningless as love!
I:13534;1152;of course the rich don't have to believe in luck, their money provides them with plenty of, all the luck they need.
I:13534;1153;if you want to see a sexy film see Allen's Match Point.
I:13534;1154;Scarlett Johansson wows as a struggling actor, the whole cast gives a magnificent performance.
I:13534;1155;Woody Allen gives an honest look at the way life can leave a bad taste in your mouth or an ache in your heart.
I:13534;1156;Once again, Woody proves he is one of the best directors and screenplay writers in the history of cinema.
I:13534;1157;The academy award nominations speak for themselves, and Woody has once again found a gem of an actress in Scarlett Johansson.
I:13534;1158;"in other respects, ""Match Point"" explores what is a near."
I:13534;1159;pondering what I will do to protect the life I have built.
I:13534;1160;That Allen may explore this idea in a rather unconventional way just makes it all the more entertaining.
I:13534;1161;"reliance and ""wanting to make a contribution,"" Chris is also the kind of guy who reads ""Crime and Punishment"" with the Cambridge Companion by his side to help him through the tough parts."
I:13534;1162;Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), is attractive, intelligent, and spoiled rotten.
I:13534;1163;As an aside, it is amazing what a little make.
I:13534;1164;up and costume work can do, 'cause Chloe is a bit frumpy, while the dazzling Ms. Mortimer can also be radiant .
I:13534;1165;"see her brief role as ""Perfect Girl"" in ""Notting Hill."""
I:13534;1166;allen injects a wicked dagger into this tranquil scene in the form of Nola (the superbly.
I:13534;1167;Because it's Scarlett, every man in the audience is tempted along with Chris.
I:13534;1168;"Match Point opens with Chris reading the line, ""I'd rather be lucky than good."""
I:13534;1169;It is to Allen's credit that the audience will go back and forth .
I:13534;1170;on whether Chris's luck will hold or break.
I:13534;1171;"while hardly an amazing movie, ""Match Point"" is a lot of dark fun."
I:13534;1172;Watch it for some black humor and some unsettling moments, and to go green with envy that you were not born wealthy and English.
I:13534;1173;I'm inclined to see the story as more than a morality tale because of that clue.
I:13534;1174;As others have noted, one of the most intriguing things about this movie is the presence of hints throughout, so it would not surprise me to find out that the plot is a comment on particular real contemporary events.
I:13534;1175;beyond that, there is no question the film is very good.
I:13534;1176;At one point Jonathan Rhys Meyers, whose acting is top.
I:13534;1177;notch here, delivers a line that brought a chuckle that was certainly not intended.
I:13534;1178;Still this is a good film, and it increases my respect for Woody Allen.
I:13534;1179;jRM projected a model of the aggressive power manager.
I:13534;1180;I love opera, but Woody has done his best in this film to turn people off of it.
I:13534;1181;talented actresses like Johanssen can rise to the top.
I:13534;1182;the movie basically kept you on the edge of your seat throughout.
I:13534;1183;The acting was excellent and the storyline was one that youwouldn't figure out the ending too early.
I:13534;1184;Match Point is an extremely slick, taught and accomplished thriller.
I:13534;1185;Luck, the key theme of the movie, then plays its first part.
I:13534;1186;Tom, entranced by the world of aristocratic priviledge the Hewett's inhabit begins a relationship with the sweet, good girl Chloe, yet at the same time finds himself obsessed with Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), Tom's American, struggling actress fiancee.
I:13534;1187;both Chris and Nola share similarities in that they are outsiders, trying to break into the Hewett's traditionalist, English upper class world view (and Allen, the Jewish New Yorker, portrays this world with superb accuracy, right down to the fine nuances of the class system .
I:13534;1188;such as the food you order, and conversational patterns at the dinner table).
I:13534;1189;dating Chloe, marrying her, and finding a lucrative job in his father in law's company, with opportunity for career development.
I:13534;1190;she returns to Britain and bumps into Chris while he is visiting the Tate Modern with his wife .
I:13534;1191;another instance of luck, and Chris rekindles the affair, with greater lust and passion.
I:13534;1192;the sweet, good natured, and well bred Chloe (Emily Mortimer .
I:13534;1193;the path Chris resolves on, in the spirit of Dostoyevsky (note that in a key scene at the start of the novel he reads Crime and Punishment with an accompanying guide to the novel) is a Russian denoument full of dark nights of the soul, existentialist torment and deep issues of morality.
I:13534;1194;The plot twists at the end are cleverly worked out, I won't reveal the tantalising conclusion, but be assured that the image at the start of the movie of a tennis ball slapping into the net chord and hovering tantalisingly in the air, the viewer uncertain which side of the net it will fall on, is a key image reprised later in the film.
I:13534;1195;and more generally, how does Match Point, a rare departure from his native side of the Atlantic, compare with the rest of Allen's work.
I:13534;1196;It is clever, well written and slickly plotted.
I:13534;1197;The acting is generally first rate.
I:13534;1198;This film reflects this well, since not one of the characters has so much of a trace as a sense of humour.
I:13534;1199;Ah, well, it all fits into place somehow.
I:13534;1200;Today movies are filled with super.
I:13534;1201;heroes who are brave, witty, rich, selfless, handsome, possess super.
I:13534;1202;human ability, loving, caring, warm.
I:13534;1203;There are countless movies with these heroes.
I:13534;1204;These movies are popular because we want to be these heroes.
I:13534;1205;Not one of such heroes can possibly exit in real world in which we work and live everyday.
I:13534;1206;this movie is so terrific because it shows so much the truth of human nature and the world around us.
I:13534;1207;but maybe it is a good thing that many reviewers believe in good human nature and the ability to shape one's own future which is never affected by luck or chance.
I:13534;1208;A new rendition of an older theme used by Woody Allen.
I:13534;1209;This modern day version has an interesting sitting and characters to add something extra to the plot.
I:13534;1210;Love, lust, mystery, rags to riches, everyone is handsome and beautiful!
I:13534;1211;A very clever movie, great cast and dialogue.
I:13534;1212;hero, Chris, a former tennis pro and now an instructor.
I:13534;1213;He is a working class cad who sleeps around with his brother.
I:13534;1214;Amid a backdrop of strikingly original and fresh London locales, Chris keeps having sexual encounters with Chloe (whose smoking in the film's first half is a major irritation for me), while his loving wife suspects nothing.
I:13534;1215;Woody ventures into the darkest and most chilling material he has ever created.
I:13534;1216;MATCH POINT becomes ironic and enthralling.
I:13534;1217;This is Woody Allen's longest film at 124 minutes, but one of his very finest.
I:13534;1218;It is flawless and dead serious adult filmmaking.
I:13534;1219;It all makes for great coffee house or bedroom conversation after seeing this magnificent movie in a theater or on home video.
I:13534;1220;Very enjoyable film, with superb performances by the cast.
I:13534;1221;This movie offers you great writing and smart plot.
I:13534;1222;The movie wisely portraits human natures, desires, behaviors, passions, and it was developed into love/drama/black comedy/thriller masterpiece.
I:13534;1223;That's the type of Woody Allen movie I like and feels natural.
I:13534;1224;I very much enjoyed Scoop, in which Scarlett Johansson stars with him in.
I:13534;1225;I wish I could ellaborate on that, but that really is pretty much the whole plot, spelled out for you.
I:13534;1226;jonathan Rhys Meyers does an OK job and Scarlett is pretty much what you expect.
I:13534;1227;Description: Jerk kills beautiful woman and their unborn baby to continue living in a great appartment.
I:13534;1228;Otherwise, certainly the best thing Woody Allen has come up with in at least ten years.
I:13534;1229;This movie, despite the minority of poor reviews, is captivating.
I:13534;1230;So, without giving away the parts of the movie that makes it fun to watch a movie, I would definitely recommend this.
I:13534;1231;watch some of Allen's movies after seeing this one.
I:13534;1232;The movie is sprinkled with analogies to tennis which are good, but that's not good enough to give it more than 3 stars.
I:13534;1233;There, he meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), the son of a rich businessman and they strike up a friendship.
I:13534;1234;"Tom learns of Chris' love for opera and offers him an extra ticket for the next show allowing Chris to meet the entire Hewett family
I:13534;1235;Chris and Chloe are soon married and move into a fantastic loft on the South Bank.
I:13534;1236;I remember clearly the first time I saw the trailer and the reaction when it was revealed as a Woody Allen film.
I:13534;1237;In short, it surprised everyone.
I:13534;1238;Could he have made another great film?
I:13534;1239;Match Point is a very good film, easily Allen's best in a decade.
I:13534;1240;one of the biggest surprises is that Allen would set a film anywhere other than his beloved New York.
I:13534;1241;But the London setting works well for Allen's writing and directing style.
I:13534;1242;"His writing is a little unnatural at times
I:13534;1243;In his last great films, this worked because the people who spoke these lines were wealthy, educated and it was believable.
I:13534;1244;He also balanced these storylines with the comedic antics of his character.
I:13534;1245;another positive change Allen has begun to make is that he is casting other actors as leads in his films.
I:13534;1246;"Will Farrell, Kenneth Branagh, John Cusack and others have essentially played the ""Woody Allen"" role in some of his recent offerings."
I:13534;1247;He has created something almost entirely new, challenging his skills and abilities.
I:13534;1248;the biggest and best change in the new film is that Allen doesn't subject us to another interpretation of his character running around with an actress (or two) twenty to thirty years his junior.
I:13534;1249;We are spared endless scenes of these actresses claiming what a great lover Allen's character is.
I:13534;1250;As the film begins, we realize we are in the hands of an accomplished filmmaker.
I:13534;1251;emily Mortimer brings a quiet vulnerability to the role of Chloe.
I:13534;1252;She adds just the right level of love and support to spoiled rich girl, making her character interesting and believable.
I:13534;1253;The contrast between Johannson and the British actors is really quite noticeable.
I:13534;1254;She is much better in her scenes with Tom, as his fianc e, sharing alcohol and food, flirting a bit, putting on an act.
I:13534;1255;"these two points aside, ""Match Point"" represents a return to form for a master filmmaker."
I:13534;1256;As the story unfolds, and we realize the events will be told in a series of tableaus, leaving out the unnecessary bits, we realize we are in the hands of a master.
I:13534;1257;Sit back, enjoy and let Allen tell his story.
I:13534;1258;Yet it is also a well acted and well developed film that would be reminiscent for some of films such as ANNIE HALL.
I:13534;1259;In order to know for sure, a person has to see it to decide and it's certainly worth seeing.
I:13534;1260;the film tells the story of Chris Wilton, and Irish born tennis player who realizes there's only so far his game will take him, so he takes a job as a tennis pro hoping to make a connection with London's upper class.
I:13534;1261;His charm and ability ensure this will happen.
I:13534;1262;He meets a client Tom Hewett, the son of a powerful business leader.
I:13534;1263;laws, and has a passionate affair with Nola, Tom's fianc then later ex.
I:13534;1264;Much of the film focuses on the ways in which Wilton goes to great lengths to cover up his affair.
I:13534;1265;the actors fit their roles well.
I:13534;1266;Chris Wilton is played masterfully by Irish born Jonathan Rhys Meyers.
I:13534;1267;Scarlet Johansson plays the American actress Nola, likewise gives a phenomenal performance.
I:13534;1268;The long and the short of it is, chances are you'll enjoy this film whether you like Woody Allen or not.
I:13534;1269;This one will make you dream of London.
I:13534;1270;The cities are always the top stars in Woody Allen films.You can read what the movie is about from the other reviewers.
I:13534;1271;I'm just going to tell you that it is a good movie with an unexpected twist towards the end.
I:13534;1272;it's a very good movie.
I:13534;1273;It isn't your typical WA film and that will surprise you but you will still be satisfied.
I:13534;1274;First Off, LOVED THE FILM, By Far The BEST Film Woody Allen has every made and I actually dont like Woody Allen Movies!
I:13534;1275;I just saw this (finally), and I was amazed.
I:13534;1276;If I were to name the filmmaker *least* likely to give us an intelligent tribute to Dostoyevsky.
I:13534;1277;But he manages to do just that, in spades.
I:13534;1278;What a brilliant, dark vision!
I:13534;1279;meyers is a perfect contemporary version of the Highsmith/Rendell/etc.
I:13534;1280;Woody Allen finally left New York City, perhaps for good, and comes back with this `serious' work.
I:13534;1281;uses and gives sly twists to the familiar rules of thrillers and melodramas so cleverly that Chris's story becomes a study of our life in general seen from a delightfully cynical point of view.
I:13534;1282;natured girl and daughter of a rich president of some big company, and Nora (Scarlett Johansson), American girl who wants to be an actress.
I:13534;1283;`Match Point' is about infidelity or ambition, but at the same time it is about chance, or luck, and the role it plays in our life.
I:13534;1284;Allen intentionally employs various kind of clich seen in noirs or thrillers to emphasize this point, which is ultimately summarized with the neat conclusion at the last five minutes of the film.
I:13534;1285;frankly I don't agree with Allen's view on life, but its cynicism is certainly fascinating.
I:13534;1286;Allen's London is, quite understandably, that of outsiders, seen from the viewpoint of a tourist, and the film's postcard beauty, people living there might say, does not really represent the city.
I:13534;1287;the film also has some shrewd references to opera, painting, and literature.
I:13534;1288;An American in England is a familiar theme in novels, and one Dostoevsky novel plays a significant role in the plot twist.
I:13534;1289;"But you don't have to know these things at all
I:13534;1290;There are no quirkily funny dialogues, but still `Match Point' is a compelling drama with one or two interesting commentaries about life.
I:13534;1291;Instead, for a very strong, punch.
I:13534;1292;"But in ""Closer,"" Law's character's inner conflicts are much more externalized, giving us a sense of the whys and wherefores of his actions."
I:13534;1293;Out of the Allen canon, 90% of the films revolve around romantic love.
I:13534;1294;decades to make a huge profit.
I:13534;1295;Chris is smitten with Nola and she is attracted to him as well, but it is with Chloe that Chris begins a relationship.
I:13534;1296;She's the key to his future.
I:13534;1297;She's an American and an actress, two things that the wealthy old family just can't seem to abide with.
I:13534;1298;Chloe's father soon offers Chris a job with the family company and Chris' social star is on the rise.
I:13534;1299;Although he treats Chloe affectionately, it is with Nola that Chris seeks his true pleasure.
I:13534;1300;The two begin a heated, passionate affair.
I:13534;1301;setting, and between good and evil.
I:13534;1302;It's a modern morality tale that we can all learn from.
I:13534;1303;This is a must see film for fans of Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson.
I:13534;1304;It's also a great film to watch if you're in the mood for a serious, intriguing drama with a strong, moral message.
I:13534;1305;Still, Woody has made a film that's watchable.
I:13534;1306;He was smart to film in Britain.
I:13534;1307;"Woody is so out of touch with real American life (few minorities
I:13534;1308;The truth is, he's an old.
I:13534;1309;fogey, and the people who love him can't admit he's behind the times.
I:13534;1310;We see once again Allen's interest in human relations.
I:13534;1311;Scarlett Johansson is beautiful, but her role as the seductress turned stalker is uneven.
I:13534;1312;Allen did not get enough from her and I believe she still has much more to give.
I:13534;1313;"how shall I say ""splendid""."
I:13534;1314;[Hint: Its real name is Metropolitan Police Service, and it has nothing to do with Scotland.]
I:13534;1315;Beautiful Nola who is Tom's fianc e (and Tom is Chris's student) and Tom's sister Chloe.
I:13534;1316;With Chole, he has financial stability and true love.
I:13534;1317;"Nola is from the ""slums"" of Boulder, Colorado (I live in the Denver metro area and knows it's a rich area)."
I:13534;1318;Woody Allen attempts a Hitchcock style and it almost works.
I:13534;1319;Solid performances and a good story with both intelligence and a twist.
I:13534;1320;social climbers attempting to marry into a rich English family.
I:13534;1321;When she returns to London Chris reignites their passion, which can only lead to tragedy.
I:13534;1322;making based simply on good writing and cinematic storytelling.
I:13534;1323;"For those who do, however, ""Match Point"" is quite rewarding, unpredictable and original."
I:13534;1324;underpinning the drama is the theme of luck.
I:13534;1325;It's amazing how good writing and storytelling can create a 'Wow' reaction much more so than the most elaborate overkill action sequence with all its requisite cgi and explosions.
I:13534;1326;Case in point: the 'rain scene' is potent.
I:13534;1327;"Needless to say, ""Match Point"" is a must for Scarlett Johansson fans."
I:13534;1328;"Match Point is smarter and more subtle than that
I:13534;1329;Match Point has outstanding acting, a surprise ending, beautifully filmed scenes of London and an outstanding soundtrack featuring old recordings by Enrico Caruso.
I:13534;1330;It may not be the equal of his masterpiece Manhattan, but is in the ballpark and is better than most of his recent films.
I:13534;1331;Even if you think he hasn't made a good film since 1979, Match Point is worth a view.
I:13534;1332;In 2008 he made Vicky Christina Barcelona, which has an excellent cast and beautiful views of Gaudi's Barcelona.
I:13534;1333;see my review from March 13.
I:13534;1334;When Nola gets the call from him about good news, you want something good to happen to her.
I:13534;1335;pros:Acting and locations were good though, and Scarlett is beautiful as always.
I:13534;1336;I enjoyed the acting (especially Scarlett Johanssen) and the scenery.
I:13534;1337;The plot was engaging and intense.
