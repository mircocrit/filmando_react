I:10014;1;Firefly fans will love this movie.
I:10014;2;Even if you have never watched the series, this movie is a great story.
I:10014;3;All worthwile, and some of the best entertainment of its kind in the verse.
I:10014;4;A really good choice for Star Trek fans, a must for Firefly fans.
I:10014;5;If you're a firefly buff, you have to see this!
I:10014;6;I won't be a spoiler, but I will say I loved it!
I:10014;7;Extremely well written, acted and directed, this was what I had been waiting to see for a long time in the realm of Sci.
I:10014;8;everyone who still wants to see how great moviemaking can be, should watch this at least once in their life.
I:10014;9;and then gorged myself on the delightful mix of science fiction and western memes, dark humor, subtle social commentary and comic=book violence of the 14 available episodes in a weekend.
I:10014;10;But but treat yourself to the series first.
I:10014;11;And the do this with fun doses of action and crisp, clever dialog.
I:10014;12;Sure be great if there was more to see in this series.
I:10014;13;This was a pretty damn good ending to an overlooked series.
I:10014;14;It captured the essence of adventure so well and the chemistry between the cast was just perfect.
I:10014;15;This movie takes everything from the series and expands upon its awesomeness even more.
I:10014;16;Everyone should see this movie!
I:10014;17;It is a great Sci fi series.
I:10014;18;Would have had a great time watching the show.
I:10014;19;A dramatic finish to the prematurely euthanized series Firefly.
I:10014;20;Has all of your favorite characters, some of which are dropped in some pretty heart.
I:10014;21;It's not as satisfying as another season would have been, but it's a good bundle of entertainment in its own right.
I:10014;22;It ties so much of the series up and really is like a continuation of the show.
I:10014;23;Browncoats the world over got a nice little gift when Serenity's Collector's Edition hit stores.
I:10014;24;Fantastic new cover art and inventive presentation make this little beauty pretty before you even open the box!
I:10014;25;Joss, Summer, Adam, Ron, and Nathan are fantastic as they go through the entire movie and reminisce 4 years back into their chance to keep flying.
I:10014;26;Cheers to you guys, we got our Big Damn Movie!
I:10014;27;The series is funnier + more entertaining.
I:10014;28;it is a great action movie however.
I:10014;29;star reviews and I read some of the 5.
I:10014;30;witted and sharp as it was on the series.
I:10014;31;I think if you go into this with an open mind, you will enjoy it for what it is.
I:10014;32;a good selection of deleted scenes.
I:10014;33;If you can get work, you take it.
I:10014;34;But Serenity is written so that you can just hop into the story without knowing the TV series.
I:10014;35;With smart and not so smart dialog, the two.
I:10014;36;This is a great Sci Fi movie.
I:10014;37;One of the all time best movies ever.
I:10014;38;Joss Whedon is an excellent writer and director.
I:10014;39;What really puts this movie above the rest is the number of times you can watch it, this is one of the few movies you can watch over and over again and be satisfied.
I:10014;40;there are a lot of characters in the film, but Mr. Whedon combined them all rather well.
I:10014;41;It is a film with a great plot and excellent storytelling.
I:10014;42;the comedy is by far my favorite from this movie.
I:10014;43;I was laughing out loud quite a few times in the theatre.
I:10014;44;This movie was incredible and one of the best movies in recent years.
I:10014;45;a good movie with a good plot.
I:10014;46;maybe its not for everyone but everyone I know except one person loves the movie and has seen it multiple times.
I:10014;47;this movie brings back the magic that was once there.
I:10014;48;Those that truly appreciate it do so for the fact that it is fun to watch, moving to listen to and gets the heart rate going no matter how many times you see it.
I:10014;49;This is classic mythos in modern form once again.
I:10014;50;Great way to watch the movie.
I:10014;51;fi film that captured the magic, romance, humor, and adventure as well as Star Wars.
I:10014;52;joss Whedon is a genius.
I:10014;53;"He ""gets"" life, and he ""gets"" the pathos required to make a character truly lovable."
I:10014;54;This is a movie for intelligent, mature, movie lovers.
I:10014;55;Support this type of creative and artistic direction.
I:10014;56;Just a great movie with great dialouge, effects, story and most importantly heart.
I:10014;57;Just watch it, that's all I can say, it's an amazing experience.
I:10014;58;"The only way I can think of to describe Serenity would be a ""laid back"" movie that was well aware of its core audience, and well aware of ways to exploit its own genre, in a positive way."
I:10014;59;big government screed, the movie presents the Alliance as an all powerful, corrupted, invasive government that tries to control every aspect of the life in the new solar system.
I:10014;60;So the alliance sends its best assassin after the girl, and the whole crew of the Serenity.
I:10014;61;The assassin, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, is one of the best villains I have seen in a movie in quite a long time.
I:10014;62;A lot of that is thanks to his acting, but also thanks to the writing of Joss Whedon.
I:10014;63;The writing in this movie is amazing.
I:10014;64;Whedon does an amazing job of giving each character their own distinct personality.
I:10014;65;Each Serenity crew member adds something, and by the end of the movie, you are really rooting for the crew as a family.
I:10014;66;The dialogue is interesting, not overdone, and extremely funny in some parts.
I:10014;67;Technically, the movie is also very well.
I:10014;68;The special effects are pretty dang cool.
I:10014;69;"The one real ""battle"" scene in the movie provides some amazing visuals, with the Serenity spinning out of control down through the atmosphere in the middle of a huge battle between the Alliance and the Reavers."
I:10014;70;In the least, I think that Joss Whedon is an amazingly talented up.
I:10014;71;I can't wait for his next movie, I hope some studio will give him the opportunity to really create another vision of his like he did with this film.
I:10014;72;I stumbled on this movie by chance and have been telling everyone about how good it is.
I:10014;73;fi fan, absolutely loved this movie.
I:10014;74;The story is great and the characters are fun.
I:10014;75;ray will have you visually impressed and your surround sound will by constantly busy.
I:10014;76;trekkies and furries and whatnot.
I:10014;77;I liked FIREFLY: liked it a lot.
I:10014;78;The poster is in Cyrillic and has some metal clad chick with an axe.
I:10014;79;fi X File style features.
I:10014;80;this movie is for you.
I:10014;81;this movie is for you.
I:10014;82;this movie is for you.
I:10014;83;this movie is for you.
I:10014;84;this movie is for you.
I:10014;85;if you like good looking at good looking women/men.
I:10014;86;this movie is for you.
I:10014;87;if you like good movies.
I:10014;88;this movie is for you.
I:10014;89;I bought this for x. mas and I loved watching it
I:10014;90;(Although I'm super happy about the cast commentary.
I:10014;91;the River Tam sessions are particularly interesting.
I:10014;92;It was one of the best movies of 2005 in my opinion .
I:10014;93;"hopefully ""The Powers That Be"" will green."
I:10014;94;Go ahead be Wowed, see Serenity.
I:10014;95;I went to see it the day it came out not knowing what to expect.
I:10014;96;But it was enjoyable and I really cared about the characters.
I:10014;97;And it is better having seen the series, but the movie got me into the series.
I:10014;98;Just kick back, have no expectations and you will enjoy this movie.
I:10014;99;Also I found the trailers after I saw the movie.
I:10014;100;The Firefly TV series was one of the best and died a very untimely death.
I:10014;101;And of course Serenity is a truly great movie that stands by itself even if you've never seen the series.
I:10014;102;But it will make you want to see the series.
I:10014;103;Grab it, turn the sound up, push play and enjoy!
I:10014;104;There are character connections and emotional moments that you may not develop an understanding about without watching the series first.
I:10014;105;Serenity is a conclusionary film in the sense that its purpose is to finally answer those questions that were left on the table at the end of the television series.
I:10014;106;With that said, Serenity is the BEST conclusionary film ever!
I:10014;107;The true conclusion to Whedon's science fiction epic is finally told with the budget it deserved.
I:10014;108;While I do believe that Whedon could have successfully done this perhaps seven seasons later, due to the final termination of the first season, he did the best that he could.
I:10014;109;i am an enormous, yet new, fan of this series.
I:10014;110;Whedon has amazingly transformed the bond between these characters, the tension, the excitement, the passion, and given them their feature debut.
I:10014;111;honchos of this crew, give more than 100% in their efforts for Whedon's dream.
I:10014;112;The actors were completely immersed in their roles, giving us the same spunk, pizzazz, and charm from the original series.
I:10014;113;Watching Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, and Summer Glau reprise their characters was like revisiting your favorite book on a beautiful spring day at the beach.
I:10014;114;one of the aspects that I love about this film is that Whedon honestly does answer all of those burning questions that are in the back of your mind.
I:10014;115;He does this by keeping so many of the same elements in the film that we grew to love in the television series.
I:10014;116;fi than the television series), and the bond between the crew (a element that you do not see in most television film adaptations) are all points that made the series great.
I:10014;117;Whedon has taken these and crafted one of the best films this year.
I:10014;118;He remembers the humanity of the characters, the humbleness of Mal, and the fire that is in each of their eyes.
I:10014;119;It is about having faith (but not always about God), it is about honesty, and it is about courage and dedication.
I:10014;120;I thought out of all of the characters, even River, he was the most complex.
I:10014;121;While he is hardly in this film, he continues to force us to ponder on what is truly in his past.
I:10014;122;overall, this movie was fantastic.
I:10014;123;It carries everything a sci.
I:10014;124;Whedon proves that he has the power to control his characters and develop honest stories that keep simple themes and devoted morals.
I:10014;125;It is what I loved about the TV series, and it is what completed this film for me.
I:10014;126;I listened to the commentary with Joss and the cast (very funny) and watched all the extras.
I:10014;127;You can usually predict that first big drop, because of the build.
I:10014;128;i am of the opinion that a good movie is like a roller coaster.
I:10014;129;There may be a predictable first drop, but the rest should be unexpected and thrilling, like a great Six Flags ride.
I:10014;130;Of course, it's even better when you can't even predict that first drop.
I:10014;131;And that's what Serenity delivers.
I:10014;132;Capt. Reynolds, played beautifully by Nathan Fillion, owns a ship called Serenity, named after the location of the Independent's final defeat.
I:10014;133;For Reynolds, Serenity is freedom.
I:10014;134;The ship allows him to take jobs (both legal and illegal) and stay as far from the strong arm of the Alliance as he possibly can.
I:10014;135;Wash, played by Alan Tudyk (28 Days, A Knight's Tale, Dodgeball, Into the West, and Spamalot on Broadway) is the perfect everyman character who is always ready with a well.
I:10014;136;She is everyone's friend and brings out a very brotherly protection instinct in Reynolds.
I:10014;137;Together, this crew makes up a kind of family for Reynolds, and he is fiercely protective of this family.
I:10014;138;Simon, a young and accomplished doctor, took River out of an Alliance facility, and they will stop at nothing to get her back.
I:10014;139;In their travels, they come across the real.
I:10014;140;winning writer/director Joss Whedon and hailed by critics, the show was cancelled after the network aired the second episode first and the first episode last, pre.
I:10014;141;Universal Pictures stepped up to the plate and greenlit the movie, and Whedon was able to get the entire original cast to return for the feature film.
I:10014;142;Whedon and the cast have even talked about making the film into a trilogy in the future, depending on how well the first film does.
I:10014;143;One important thing to note is that you do not have to know anything about the series before seeing the movie.
I:10014;144;An absolutely stunning opening sequence serves to refresh old viewers and to bring new viewers up to speed in a very elegant and interesting way.
I:10014;145;serenity is a blend of all genres: action, sci.
I:10014;146;fi, adventure, western, comedy, romance, and foreign (the characters speak a little Chinese as part of the blend of Chinese and English.
I:10014;147;fi and adventure elements are prominent, the most promient feature is the humor.
I:10014;148;Whedon is a master of witty dialogue and the intelligent quips that go back and forth between characters is delightful.
I:10014;149;Character is a focus in this film, and that, in addition to the big explosions and cool space battles, is what makes the film work as well as it does.
I:10014;150;And a more believable story.
I:10014;151;Summer Glau's River is psychotic and scared, vulnerable but extremely powerful.
I:10014;152;in the grand tradition of great Sci.
I:10014;153;fi, Serenity has fantastic special effects, spectacular space battles, beautiful scenery and complex, satisfying plots.
I:10014;154;It will engage every emotion and keep you guessing until the last second, just like a good roller coaster does.
I:10014;155;for those who have never seen Firefly, Serenity offers an action.
I:10014;156;fi movie with an interesting concept.
I:10014;157;It's fast tempo easily draws watchers in, and will make them instant fans.
I:10014;158;I personally saw the TV show first, but either way I believe Serenity is an open movie for all to enjoy.
I:10014;159;serenity is one of the many great works by Joss Whedon.
I:10014;160;It is ranked one of the 10 best Sci.
I:10014;161;the movie is a lot of fun, with sharp dialog and pretty good acting (especially the assassin played by Chiwetel Ejiofor), but like Star Wars, there's really not much to it beyond surface flash.
I:10014;162;But it actually works pretty good in a fast.
I:10014;163;As a movie that was made because of the uproar of fans, Joss Whedon did an amazing job pulling together all the elements of the tv show, trying to tie up some of the loose ends, and making a great run of it.
I:10014;164;Granted, by watching the series first, you're a little more drawn in by it, but even on it's own, it's an amazing movie.
I:10014;165;If you want something a little more intellectually stimulating than Star Wars, this is the film for you!
I:10014;166;"If you're part of the new generation of ""Television is actually good"", then you can take it."
I:10014;167;It was pretty good for a series turned to movie.
I:10014;168;Now, I'm not sure why I liked the movie so much.
I:10014;169;I do know that the people I went to see the movie with, who had never watched the series, liked the movie as well.
I:10014;170;"I was like, ""yeah, we know this already, let's move on""."
I:10014;171;after the movie I asked, how was it that it blended science fiction, drama, romance and comedy so well together?
I:10014;172;This time, the movie was actually better than the previews, an achievement in itself.
I:10014;173;I think this may be the last we see of anything Serenity for a long time on the screen, and that may be a good thing.
I:10014;174;Serenity ideal in the hearts of those who deem it a legend.
I:10014;175;One of the unusual things about Serenity (and Firefly) was the depth of characterization right from the start.
I:10014;176;I bought this as a gift for a Sci.
I:10014;177;packed at the same time with beloved characters from the Firefly series.
I:10014;178;Nathan Fillion is an amazing actor along with a very superior cast.
I:10014;179;making at it's finest, and one of the best (if not THE best) movies I've ever seen.
I:10014;180;If you like brilliant dialog, a great story, and acting beyond compare, you'll love this movie.
I:10014;181;I laughed, I cried, I gasped, and I cheered.
I:10014;182;fi movie I've seen in years that actually makes you care about the characters.
I:10014;183;So many things good here:One of the TRULY great films and hardly anyone even knows about it.
I:10014;184;My highest recommendation for this edition or the original.
I:10014;185;For this edition:1) A package so much better than the original release.2) Bonus material above and beyond the original release.
I:10014;186;still worth getting if you have the original release .
I:10014;187;Just as good as the series.
I:10014;188;This is Best Action Adventure film of the Decade.
I:10014;189;A nonstop thrill ride from start to finish.
I:10014;190;fi or just a great story, Check Out Serenity (Collector's Edition) and while your at it pick up Firefly: The Complete Series to see where it all began.
I:10014;191;Great movie for anyone who has seen the Firefly series or not.
I:10014;192;"The introduction sequence from ""Serenity"" manages to cover so much background from ""Firefly"" in about five minutes ."
I:10014;193;What we're witnessing here is a brush of a master at work.
I:10014;194;wireless, grounded, physical, and much better choregraphed than fighting in Whedon's previous TV work.
I:10014;195;both with their flaws and the funny banter .
I:10014;196;serenity as a film succeeds in the way that most space.
I:10014;197;Serenity and Firefly revels in the characterizations and plays on the differences to make the whole better and stronger.
I:10014;198;dialog is fast and witty.
I:10014;199;effects are on par with the best of the best ( and probably done for a fraction of the cost of others) and Whedon's writing and directing make this a personal film with a strong libertarian streak throughout.
I:10014;200;the Firefly/Serenity universe is probably realistic for the time imagined .
I:10014;201;"serenity is easily on par with the new Battlestar Galactica which according to Wired magazine is the ""best show on television""."
I:10014;202;lets all hope that the success of this film will revive the series or at the very least lead to second movie.
I:10014;203;This film is just pure fun.
I:10014;204;It has the incredible trademark Joss dialogue, great action scenes, masterful cinematography and a really timely score.
I:10014;205;It also has very cool FX (Loni Peristere and the Zoic team truly outdid themselves) and incredible acting.
I:10014;206;From the newbies, I specially enjoyed Chiwetel's performance and can only hope for some sort of continuation to this wonderful saga.
I:10014;207;fiction film that takes place mostly in space.
I:10014;208;This movie is an exciting tale of a captain, his crew, and a young seemingly.
I:10014;209;later member of Mal's crew and a source for most of the humor in the film.
I:10014;210;There is every type of romance, the budding love between the ship's mechanic and Simon, the mature love between Mal's first mate and the ship's pilot, and the estranged love of Mal and Inara, a teacher in a girl's house.
I:10014;211;The film is filled with action.
I:10014;212;There are numerous battle scenes with many enemies.
I:10014;213;This movie has many funny parts, mostly due to Jayne's snide comments such as the one made during the climactic battle scene.
I:10014;214;There are truly, very few negatives to this film.
I:10014;215;fi flick the storyline is fantastic and intriguing.
I:10014;216;The actors are mostly unknowns, but they play their parts spectacularly.
I:10014;217;The special effects were even fairly well done for when the movie was made.
I:10014;218;this is an excellent movie for Sci.
I:10014;219;fiction space movies but I enjoyed this movie immensely.
I:10014;220;I recommend this movie for those who enjoy films like Star Wars and Star Trek.
I:10014;221;This movie is ONLY for fans of Firefly.
I:10014;222;I absolutely love, love, LOVE this movie!
I:10014;223;Brings a bit of closure to the quick demise of the TV show and gives us an opportunity to see the Serenity flying through the stars again!
I:10014;224;But again, this is fan service for fans of Firefly.
I:10014;225;I love the rough and tumble nature of the crew and their missions and lifestyle.
I:10014;226;I just loved that series.
I:10014;227;YES, absolutely, though with a few twists.
I:10014;228;The series brief 11 episodes had something like 450 minutes with which to carefully, slowly, gradually unfold these characters and story lines .
I:10014;229;I think they did a great job of that.
I:10014;230;And I really enjoyed the movie.
I:10014;231;And if the gangbuster movie results win them a chance to give new birth to the TV show .
I:10014;232;well, then they will have succeeded in achieving what I think was their and their fans dream of dreams.
I:10014;233;Did they do a great job that I felt totally able to enjoy?
I:10014;234;And the friend who went with me to the movie had only seen 2 of the 11 series episodes and he also enjoyed it .
I:10014;235;fi movies this movie is one of the best.
I:10014;236;Good Sci Fi premise but.
I:10014;237;One of the best series mixing Western kitch with a rich Sci.
I:10014;238;Good acting, great characters, witty dialog and action.
I:10014;239;This is one of the best series I've seen in a long time.
I:10014;240;The writing is classic Whedon.
I:10014;241;the characters are memorable, they actually develop over the course of the show, there are some great lines and the set design is great.
I:10014;242;Fellow Browncoats disagree on whether or not to resign to never getting a Firefly reboot, but I feel this at least gives something very substantial to love in the wake of Fox's sudden but inevitable betrayal.
I:10014;243;and are a highly charged fan.
I:10014;244;to give the film credit, the special effects were stunning.
I:10014;245;I loved the introduction to the worlds, and the beautiful alien landscape designs.
I:10014;246;The soundtrack was absolutely brilliant also, and was one of the few things that was quite perfect.
I:10014;247;"Some of the ideas highlighted in the movie also had merit
I:10014;248;I also liked how Chinese and English were merged in the film.
I:10014;249;one that had far more flair, orginality and character development.
I:10014;250;The beautiful, curvy woman on the front of the Serenity cover was truly put their to be eye candy, because River's eyes never become blue.
I:10014;251;Mal then takes River back to the Serenity and no one except Kaylee is really happy to see them.
I:10014;252;With his name behind the movie the people at Universal could guarantee to tap into his legions of fans.
I:10014;253;In a few years time everyone will remember Star Wars and Lord of The Rings.
I:10014;254;kindled, love love love them all especially nathan fillion
I:10014;255;I loved the show so when they made the movie I was excited.
I:10014;256;If you like the show then you'll love the movie.
I:10014;257;The rest of the cast is stellar, as is the script.
I:10014;258;Serenity is gritty, witty, intelligent sci.
I:10014;259;It is simple and entretained.
I:10014;260;Bought as a gift for some one who has been wanting for a long time!They love it!
I:10014;261;Sums up all of the original Firefly story line, greatly enjoyed this movie, would highly recomend it to any one that enjoys firefly.
I:10014;262;It was an okay film.
I:10014;263;It had a couple of good set.
I:10014;264;they make enough references to the show for good continuity.
I:10014;265;The CGI and acting are great, as you might expect from the Firefly crew.
I:10014;266;It's a great little cowboy space adventure!
I:10014;267;i've always thought the movie Serenity was made to give the fans of this really wonderful series juts one more taste.
I:10014;268;A great movie for anyone who likes movies, Serenity has action, adventure, comedy, and some superb writing and acting going for it.
I:10014;269;The action sequences are intense, tight, and have to be seen on the big screen .
I:10014;270;Excellent writing, well acted, and great picture.
I:10014;271;I bought this just to expose friends to the Movie (& TV program), and everyone has liked it so far.
I:10014;272;The cast has strong chemistry, the storyline is beyond compelling, and the outcome is breathtaking.
I:10014;273;There's rumored to be a two.
I:10014;274;And honestly, you need to see this movie.
I:10014;275;fi movie lover, this has interesting characters, and creative and plot that keeps you guessing.
I:10014;276;The aesthetic and artistic value is just about nil.
I:10014;277;This is 3rd rate sci.
I:10014;278;Also you may not be as invested in the characters as much and Serenity is definitely about the characters.
I:10014;279;Overall the movie is good on it's own but I encourage people to view the series first.
I:10014;280;then the movie is great!
I:10014;281;Director Whedon does a brilliant job of tying up loose ends by explaining the central mystery of Firefly and even developing the characters more.
I:10014;282;He also leaves room for a continuation of the series, by advancing key relationships to points that would allow a new storyline, including making room for new characters.
I:10014;283;I can't be more specific w/o including spoilers, but really, this movie's great strength is the amount of material it covers.
I:10014;284;The Firefly saga gets wrapped up neatly and satisfyingly and Serenity works well as a a stand.
I:10014;285;Good special effects, good dialog, good acting.
I:10014;286;firefly fans, this is the best sci.
I:10014;287;It moves faster, is funnier, has more realistic characters, and more interesting relationships than the Star Wars prequels.
I:10014;288;fi, Serenity will be pure joy.
I:10014;289;If you like Westerns, it'll be good.
I:10014;290;gongrats to the whole Firefly team.
I:10014;291;Devoid of bug eyed monsters and pseudo mystic waffle, this is a story about believable people in a futuristic setting, even non Sci Fi buffs can enjoy it.
I:10014;292;This movie is one of the best sci fi movies I've ever seen.
I:10014;293;The story and characters are so compelling that I found myself wanting more and more.
I:10014;294;but also to show support for this masterpiece.
I:10014;295;Great followup to the tv series firefly but just like the series leaves you wanting more time with the characters.
I:10014;296;Loved the film and hope there are more or a revival of the series ala Family Guy on Fox.
I:10014;297;I love, love, love this movie!!!
I:10014;298;I have been looking for it, I was happy to find it on Amazon.
I:10014;299;The film Serenity finishes off the story beautifully and left it open for another series to pick up where it leaves off, although that seems unlikely now.
I:10014;300;The film is well made and each of the cast provides an excellent performance.
I:10014;301;Although the film works in its own right I would suggest watching and enjoying the series first.
I:10014;302;I was glad to be able to have closure to the TV series Firefly!
I:10014;303;Joss Whedon scores a touch down with me once again.
I:10014;304;All I have to hear is his name associated with a project, and I get right on board with having to see it!
I:10014;305;fi series and movie has touched me the way this one has.
I:10014;306;The film continued to emphasize this and one really cool thing was the belief, faith and love that really came to be a foundation of the story and the lives of these people.
I:10014;307;The writing was powerful, the casting superb, and I was caught up in the sheer passion that Joss and his crew obviously felt for this calling.
I:10014;308;i'll be watching it again soon, and I do not think I'll be changing my mind about it at all!
I:10014;309;Serenity was an amazing movie.
I:10014;310;I love the show Firefly, therefore the movie continuation filled my need for more.
I:10014;311;So glad they got to make this movie!
I:10014;312;ray movie to be very good like the Firefly series.
I:10014;313;Still great to add to any collection
I:10014;314;I love Nathan F. and would like to see more of his work.
I:10014;315;Great movie, great characters, it's a mystery to me why the series and movie didn't do better.
I:10014;316;one of the best movies of the year, without a doubt.
I:10014;317;I knew that anyone could come in and enjoy this movie.
I:10014;318;Every emotion gets relayed during this film.
I:10014;319;i feel it's a MUST SEE film for sure!!
I:10014;320;Endearing characters, great story plot lines.
I:10014;321;Expositon and dialoge delivered and executed beautifully.
I:10014;322;This is an example of how Fox ruins spectacularly great things by doing things 'their way.'
I:10014;323;The special effects were cool and the characters believable.
I:10014;324;d. Excellent companion to the Firefly series.
I:10014;325;but if you can get past these aspects, this was, in my opinion, possibly the most entertaining movie I have ever seen.
I:10014;326;The characters are dynamic and the plot is riviting and well paced.
I:10014;327;I had seen the movie earlier this year and had wanted to share it with a friend.
I:10014;328;*fantastic* actors, *amazing* writers, and complimentary (and not distracting) special effects.
I:10014;329;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:10014;330;I only recently started watching Firefly, and I love the universe and the characters.
I:10014;331;The movie was brilliant though.
I:10014;332;Anyone who loves Firefly, will love this movie.
I:10014;333;Watched this for the first time on my new plasma TV and enjoyed it thoroughly.
I:10014;334;This movie was a lot of fun to watch and looked fantastic in high.
I:10014;335;"Serenity however rates a ""great"" on my personal scale."
I:10014;336;Although it builds on the same characters that were in the show, you should still be able to catch on if you've never seen it.
I:10014;337;the story is inventive, interesting, and captivating.
I:10014;338;elevated to feature film status.
I:10014;339;"What they got was Serenity a truly excellent and underrated movie that stood very well on its own to new fans and ""Browncoats"" alike."
I:10014;340;The writing, acting and cinematography are all first rate and with the addition of a bunch of great extras this is an excellent package for any fans of great Sci.
I:10014;341;fi, or those who just like to watch really good movies!
I:10014;342;I wanted to be entertained as he has done for me over the last 7 years at least.
I:10014;343;He exceeded my expections and I was thrilled to be entertained with Serenity's action, off the wall comments, heroism, and suspense.
I:10014;344;I congratulate all involved with Serenity's production.
I:10014;345;I eagerly anticipated the movie and hooked all of my friends on Firefly.
I:10014;346;i heartily recommend this movie to anyone who loves sci.
I:10014;347;Love this movie and thoroughly pleased there will be two more movies made.
I:10014;348;I do wish they could continue the series as well.
I:10014;349;one of the best sci fi movies I have ever seen.
I:10014;350;Even my friends who have never seen the television show loved this movie.
I:10014;351;best movie I have seen this year.
I:10014;352;but the visualisations were great .
I:10014;353;This is by far the best movie I have seen in years.
I:10014;354;Watched it twice in a row.
I:10014;355;It draws you in and gets you hooked.
I:10014;356;This show and movie are really that good.
I:10014;357;It also carried a deep message.
I:10014;358;it was a nice closure to the Firefly TV franchise.
I:10014;359;my veteran watcher loved the extras.
I:10014;360;It flows perfectly, follows continuity, and keeps a great balance between action, humor, and drama.
I:10014;361;hand men, Shepherd Book, and such.
I:10014;362;I believe it is released in a trade paperback now, so you should read it.
I:10014;363;It helps flesh out this beauty of a film.
I:10014;364;both movie and series are incredible works, suspenseful, lots of twists, action, deep themes embedded.
I:10014;365;but a friend tipped me off that it was a good show and I saw it, even though sci.
I:10014;366;But it was a very entertaining film.
I:10014;367;The story line was intriguing and kept you guessing.
I:10014;368;The acting was pretty good (some better than others) but overall a very decent job.
I:10014;369;fi film with a western feel to it.
I:10014;370;It didn't bust and Joss is already scheduled to write and direct two more movies in the next two years (Including the highly anticipated Wonder Woman)The movie is great.
I:10014;371;It has the perfect combination of Whedon humor, action, story, drama, thrills, and character development.
I:10014;372;shutdown popularity, and the release of the film, I hope that head has rolled.
I:10014;373;"the film ""Serenity"" is excellent."
I:10014;374;"be prepared for shocks and surprises, more so if you're a fan of the series, and be prepared for a quirky ""not your usual run of the mill sci."
I:10014;375;the budget, while not as high as you might think, was used with exceptional effect, with the special effects putting some of the huge.
I:10014;376;I remember when amazon listed the special features for movies.
I:10014;377;class ship, through detailed schematics and in.
I:10014;378;depth videos, during scenes set inside Serenity.
I:10014;379;Review:Joss Whedon did a fantastic job of making a movie that not only the fans will love, but people new to the series/movie as well.
I:10014;380;It keeps you hooked untill it's over.
I:10014;381;Seriously recommended for fans of Firefly and newcomers alike.
I:10014;382;The actors use technology and dialogue that describes an unknowable background of having always been aware of thier world, as we are of ours.
I:10014;383;For example, they refer to a camera as a capture.
I:10014;384;it was a terrific and moving production, and I can attest that this opinion is not relegated only to die.
I:10014;385;I rarely watch broadcast TV, so the series was unknown to me prior to the buzz surrounding this excellent film.
I:10014;386;But I am now a big fan of this crew's interplay.
I:10014;387;Crisp picture and solid packaging.
I:10014;388;If you're a fan you want this movie.
I:10014;389;The cast give an awesome performance again but only to loose out to non effective translation of the TV show's storytelling and mood onto the big screen.
I:10014;390;it is still good to see the story of 'Firely' come to some conclusion.
I:10014;391;The final versions are a real tribute to the power of judicious editing.
I:10014;392;It is fun, lighthearted, not overly violent or strange so it is kid friendly, and Whedon's wit still shines here and there.
I:10014;393;Wild west themes also played heavily into the original Star Wars series.
I:10014;394;"whedon is well renowned in Buffy and Angel for making interesting bad guys, or big bads
I:10014;395;this movie I give four stars for my dedication to whedon and appreciation for what he has done.
I:10014;396;Great movie based on a great series and you can't beat the price for this good a sci.
I:10014;397;As satisfying as watching Firefly.
I:10014;398;I will watch it a million times.
I:10014;399;If you love Firefly you will love Serenity.
I:10014;400;I thought the bonus features were entertaining as well.
I:10014;401;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
I:10014;402;Great movie and a great follow up of the series.
I:10014;403;Part of it, I'm sure, was the marketing campaign by the studio.
I:10014;404;It would make a great companion piece to Battlestar Galactica.
I:10014;405;There are many more stories to be told in this universe.
I:10014;406;by the way, looking at the deleted scenes and the outtakes, there is great extended edition of this film contained within.
I:10014;407;This one is something special.
I:10014;408;Still, this movie is one of those genre.
I:10014;409;paced quirky films that appeal to many types of people on many types of levels.
I:10014;410;notch special effects, the sci.
I:10014;411;fi buffs get a good taste of a possible future.
I:10014;412;It's 500 years in the future, and yes, there are still no aliens!
I:10014;413;western fans can really appreciate the witty banter, gun.
I:10014;414;slingin' action, and quite impressive fight choreography.
I:10014;415;"there's enough romance to entertain the ladies
I:10014;416;notch, if not well known, and bring a fresh look into a new world.
I:10014;417;This is the kind of movie that the Star Wars prequals should have been.
I:10014;418;Fun, well acted, not overshadowed by video game like special effects, and did I mention fun?It's good to know that there are some folks out there that still know how to tell a good story and tell it well.
I:10014;419;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but, after all, I do like sci.
I:10014;420;it is positively motivating and uplifting.
I:10014;421;The characters are a nice mix of genre stock and unique individuals, but because the genres are mixed (western and sci.
I:10014;422;shot scene is amazing, actually, and the action never lets up.
I:10014;423;It's a taut, tense, interesting movie, with a complex stories that flows because the script and director don't pander.
I:10014;424;But, this film was very well done.
I:10014;425;"if you've never seen ""Firefly"" (which was the case for me), the movie catches you up to speed fairly well in the first few minutes."
I:10014;426;and enjoyed it and there are some good scenes, and I am not usually a sci.
I:10014;427;the acting is well, for the film.
I:10014;428;Because the entire case of the television show is brought back for the movie, they've developed a great rapport and a style that shows they genuinely care about each other as actors and characters.
I:10014;429;This leads to all kind of great moments in which the characters interact almost as family, which is the whole point of the story, that this family is on the run and will do anything for each other.
I:10014;430;The plot very oddly, was very similar to Resident Evil: Apocalypse which was also a great film.
I:10014;431;Overall This movie deserves a 4/5 and was very nice.
I:10014;432;If you did like this film I highly recommend: Resident Evil: Apocalypse
I:10014;433;This movie not only gave a brief backstory for anyone watching who has not seen the Firefly TV series and gives some background, but it also gives us a great look at the same characters in a feature length motion picture that was done just as well as the TV series.
I:10014;434;i loved the series fire fly and this is just as good, if not better.
I:10014;435;looks great on blu ray
I:10014;436;Joss brings you through true sadness and joy, shock and happiness in this brilliant flick.
I:10014;437;Its just great movie funny and also intense don't know why it didn't make it.
I:10014;438;Wow does it look like ass.
I:10014;439;i do have to point out how much I loved the movie, though.
I:10014;440;It put a rather nice cap on the TV series, while still allowing space for possible future endeavors.
I:10014;441;Serenity is one of the best movies that I have seen this year.
I:10014;442;Well.1) As a huge fan of the Firefly series, I enjoyed immensely the relevance to the plot line and inclusion of main characters.2) Okay, I admit it.
I:10014;443;River (played superbly by young actress Summer Glau) is extremely good.
I:10014;444;looking and a great actress.
I:10014;445;Whedon did an excellent job on the two series, but outdoes himself a million times over writing and directing Serenity.5) The plot rocks.
I:10014;446;6) The Reavers (cannibalistic bounty hunters) were cool, but I loved seeing the crew kick their asses the one time they meet face to face.
I:10014;447;all in all, Serenity has something for everyone.
I:10014;448;It has romance, action, and some funny parts.
I:10014;449;If I could give it more than five stars, rest assured I would.
I:10014;450;"This film is Joss Whedon's crowning work
I:10014;451;You see, it's not just the stories that made Firefly a great show, it was also the amazing cast.
I:10014;452;People genuinely cared for the characters, and being able to see them again was, as I said, a dream come true.
I:10014;453;everything about this movie, in my opinion, goes well above and beyond any expectations I may have had prior to seeing it.
I:10014;454;As usual, Joss Whedon delivers his trademark witty dialogue and (more importantly) an amazing plot.
I:10014;455;A good amount of our questions from the series are not only answered, but answered superbly.
I:10014;456;I never would have guessed at what really happened, and yet it makes sense and is truly a revelation.
I:10014;457;The original cast obviously have great chemistry together, and it is clear that they are all happy to be back.
I:10014;458;Meanwhile, newcomers like Ejiofor and David Krumholtz give very solid performances as well (although Krumholtz's Mr. Universe is a bit of a silly character).
I:10014;459;for a film that was only made for about $40 million, the special effects look great.
I:10014;460;The ending battle is one of my favorite space battles in movie history, and yes, I have seen the original Star Wars trilogy.
I:10014;461;all in all, this is an amazing film.
I:10014;462;disc super special edition sometime down the line.
I:10014;463;While I'd love one, I'd prefer for them to release it now.
I:10014;464;hearted fun that illustrates the joy and love that the creators and actors had for this project.
I:10014;465;This is a great set for the avid Firefly/Serenity fan.
I:10014;466;The movie was a very good and worthy conclusion and will always be in the hearts and minds of the fans.
I:10014;467;The shortlived but phenomenal series about the raggedy band of misfits on the edge of space will always live on as the story that was bright and shiny and died before it could wither away like many of the other stories on television.
I:10014;468;Because we all aim to misbehave!
I:10014;469;The story is excellent and I enjoyed, but it's not suit for kids.
I:10014;470;But I really enjoyed that girl with all those powers.
I:10014;471;And the places she has to go to find the answer.
I:10014;472;If you can get over the fights and blood, watch it.
I:10014;473;Every bit as good as the series, and one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:10014;474;A really good closure to the Firefly universe.
I:10014;475;This movie has it all, great script, amazing action scenes and pretty cool special effects.
I:10014;476;Whish they have more time to develop some of the characters, nevertheless this is a great Sci.
I:10014;477;fi movie and the Blue Ray makes this movie looks even more spectacular.
I:10014;478;The characters are well developed and interesting.
I:10014;479;There is plenty of action.
I:10014;480;The special effects are wonderful.
I:10014;481;"I haven't enjoyed a movie this much since the original ""Star Wars""."
I:10014;482;It does give you extra insite into both the characters and the storyline.
I:10014;483;i loved, loved, loved it!
I:10014;484;"While darker than the series, ""Serenity"" still retained most of what I loved about ""Firefly""."
I:10014;485;The cast, characters, the story and the style were as welcome as old friends.
I:10014;486;"Heists, Reavers, government assassins and conspiracies, and the ""truth about River"" (alas, it appears we will never know the tantalizing truth about another mysterious character)
I:10014;487;The length of the film prohibited the quieter kind of individual moments between characters that I found appealing and gave them clich .
I:10014;488;As with many of my favorite shows, books, or movies, at the end I had the feeling that the story could not have been done better any other way.
I:10014;489;"Whedon and Co. are Storytellers
I:10014;490;I'll miss those irreplaceable characters and what they added to the mix (One has always reminded me of someone very special in my real life).
I:10014;491;A story in the best science fiction tradition.
I:10014;492;Fascinating story and characters that make you care and want to know more.
I:10014;493;but the movie will be the door to a wonderful series that had way too short a lifespan on TV.
I:10014;494;For fans, it's the same wonderful series but glitz up by hollywood.
I:10014;495;The doc is bigger, Kaylee smaller, Jayne is smaller and Zoeys hair bigger.
I:10014;496;Great for stay in and watch all day occasion.
I:10014;497;Great gift to my husband!
I:10014;498;The series was short but sweet!
I:10014;499;I got hooked on this series after it was cancelled.
I:10014;500;A fascinating mixture of space, cowboy, pirate movie, comedy, and drama, with brilliant writing and enjoyable actors, it's sort of like the story of what Han Solo might have been before Star Wars.
I:10014;501;Those of us who are on the side of the underdog and the dissenter can appreciate that.
I:10014;502;Firefly, the show, was cancelled after one season, but its loyal fans, who call themselves 'Browncoats' (after the Independents who fought against the Alliance) kept the hope alive.
I:10014;503;"Joss Whedon fought tooth and nail and finally got ""Serenity"", the movie, made."
I:10014;504;The plot is engaging, the characters fascinating, the visuals and the world ruggedly beautiful.
I:10014;505;a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience!
I:10014;506;I've since seen the show and the movie several times, and have joined the ranks of the Browncoats.
I:10014;507;It's about time that Mr. Whedon actually got to direct a movie he wrote, and it was obviously in the best of hands.
I:10014;508;Whedonesque writing and directing at its usual best.
I:10014;509;So thanks very much to everyone involved for bringing out our synchronicity.
I:10014;510;It is a great big swashbuckling, fast,non.
I:10014;511;stop action,sweet,funny, poignant,exciting, original, brilliant movie that just picks you up and sweeps you along and finally drops you back in your seat in the end, all sweaty and wrung out.
I:10014;512;"Give yourself a little recovery time and then it's, ""Let's watch it again!"""
I:10014;513;Whatever you want to classify it as, I will classify it as REALLY GOOD!
I:10014;514;Captain Mal Reynolds commands the Serenity and her crew.
I:10014;515;While being chased through space by hordes of Reavers and a deadly government assassin, the crew of Serenity learn a secret that the universe must know!This movie is based on the failed TV show Firefly, and is a hit that works as a complete stand alone!
I:10014;516;The action and special effects are STAR TREK worthy!
I:10014;517;It deserves a sequel!NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Another Universal Studios triumph!
I:10014;518;The picture soars and the audio rocks!
I:10014;519;All the great special features are carried over!
I:10014;520;Must see for Sci Fi fans.
I:10014;521;everything was more professional and polished than shows on the air for many years.
I:10014;522;An incredibly compelling mystery was set up and we were denied its resolution.
I:10014;523;This major motion picture offers the perfect resolution to one of the main mysteries explored by the series and at the same time stands alone as a fantastic science fiction movie.
I:10014;524;The special effects are well done.
I:10014;525;The innuendo is done extremely well.
I:10014;526;There are many scenes in which the subtle humor is very funny.
I:10014;527;I have enjoyed this movie very much.
I:10014;528;serenity is my third favorite movie, behind Jaws and The Producers .
I:10014;529;Some of the best dialogue I've ever heard, and some of the plot twists were awesome.
I:10014;530;Absolutely loved it, and I'm still holding out hope for more Firefly in the future.
I:10014;531;Great movie for anyone who loved Firefly, or Sci.
I:10014;532;Do yourself a favor , go see this movie.
I:10014;533;Then I came back to the movie just as this worthy special edition was released.
I:10014;534;If you have an appreciation for good storytelling, you'll be truly hooked on both the television show and the film.
I:10014;535;The crazy thing is that this statement is also true the other way around.
I:10014;536;serenity is a stupendous film full of characters with real conflict, real human value.
I:10014;537;This film is an amazing balancing act in plot, humor, and daring tragedy.
I:10014;538;It's worth it many times over.
I:10014;539;It has everything, action, comedy, drama and when you hear about the story behind this film being made, you have even more drama.
I:10014;540;fi movie I have seen, its actually believable and you get totally immersed in the Serenity verse.
I:10014;541;i recommend this to anyone who loves action, comedy and of course Sci.
I:10014;542;If you enjoyed the series Firefly, you will LOVE this movie.
I:10014;543;It is a great extension of the series.
I:10014;544;"I wish there was more for us to view, but this is as good a ""wrap"" as you could ask for!"
I:10014;545;Worth the price of admission!!
I:10014;546;Great effects, story and characters drive this TV franchise to the big screen.
I:10014;547;This is just such a great movie.
I:10014;548;I really enjoyed the series Firefly .
I:10014;549;They take care of each other and form a family of sorts.
I:10014;550;Nathan Fillion is one of my favorite actors.
I:10014;551;There is action and quite a bit of it in this movie.
I:10014;552;If you enjoy science fiction/fantasy this is a great movie to watch.
I:10014;553;It has action and the setting is a lot of fun and only adds to the movie.
I:10014;554;Would recommend this for any fan with a BR player.
I:10014;555;This is an amazing movie based on an even better show!
I:10014;556;Each of the actors is cast perfectly, particularly Chiwetel Ejifor as the Operative and Summer Glau as River.
I:10014;557;The humor is great, the action and special effects entertaining and the characters are facinating.
I:10014;558;The story of criminals fighting against the perfect society and seeking to make the truth known never gets old.
I:10014;559;It is well worth seeing even if you are not a fan of the genre.
I:10014;560;The result is simply a great film.
I:10014;561;In fact Serenity is certainly superior to a number of the movies in both of those venerable series.
I:10014;562;the special effects are inconsistent but always acceptable and sometimes outstanding.
I:10014;563;The movie has great comical moments as well as creepy ones.
I:10014;564;The cast does an outstanding job and the cinematography is interesting to say the least.
I:10014;565;"If you did not like `Firefly' give `Serenity' a shot
I:10014;566;hopefully the surprise success of `Serenity' will allow them to do a sequel.
I:10014;567;This is a terrific movie that came out after the seriesFirefly: The Complete Series [Blu.
I:10014;568;Star Trek is true Sci.
I:10014;569;bending, brilliantly witty, moving, exciting, involving and funny trip successfully melds sci.
I:10014;570;It took me right back to that thrill of the exotic and romantic that was first seen on screen in the bar scene in the very first Star Wars, and has hardly ever been equalled in any movie since.
I:10014;571;"(I know that's saying a lot
I:10014;572;I'm a Firefly fan and love it.
I:10014;573;Fantastic movie, classic Firefly humor/pacing.
I:10014;574;After 14 episodes I finally got to see River kill, well, everyone.
I:10014;575;If you watched Firefly, it's a must.
I:10014;576;I loved the few episodes I saw on TV.
I:10014;577;I started watching the TV shows because Alan Tudyk was in it, and I loved him in everything I had ever seen him in.
I:10014;578;Watched it twice, within a few days.
I:10014;579;I love everything about this.
I:10014;580;I loved it, and these characters are so alive.
I:10014;581;I watched the show Firefly before I bought this movie and I think it helped me with the movie because I understood what everything was in the movie, but I thought that the movie was fantastic, just as good as the show.
I:10014;582;Serenity is an outstanding science fiction movie.
I:10014;583;The characters are unique and interesting, their story compelling.
I:10014;584;Unlike many stories where the villain is either a psycho or worse a poorly written idiot, this antagonist is fresh and fun.
I:10014;585;He knows what he's doing.
I:10014;586;But he also believes that he works for a higher purpose.
I:10014;587;It is the character chemistry and beautiful space landscapes that makes this movie so good.
I:10014;588;It is also very good, and you will gain a new understanding of the characters from the series.
I:10014;589;I luv it since I was a big fan of the Firefly series.
I:10014;590;It's even more tragic that, due to the recent ineptitude of writers for both the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises, the vast majority of the moviegoing public will never even consider seeing what I believe is superlative cinematic storytelling in Serenity, writer/creator Joss Whedon's latest and best effort to date.
I:10014;591;for those of you who have seen last season's cancelled series Firefly (there's a sad tale in there all its own), this film is a splendid wrap.
I:10014;592;aw heck, here's all you need to know about Serenity: a plot that involves lots of action, eye candy (in the form of great SFX, cinematography and good.
I:10014;593;"looking actors), and classic human drama
I:10014;594;This movie is the final installment of the captivating series Firefly by Joss Whedon.
I:10014;595;If not, then welcome to the end of a great story.
I:10014;596;The show and the movie have characters that are easy to love and hate.
I:10014;597;I could see my friends in the characters of the show and that always makes for more entertainment.
I:10014;598;If you're a fan of the Firefly show upon which this film is based or not, you will enjoy this movie.
I:10014;599;packed and humorous, without being silly and trite.
I:10014;600;The characters are interesting and the new un.
I:10014;601;polished view of the space travel of our future is refreshing.
I:10014;602;It's what we love about the old Star Wars films, wihtout copying their formula.
I:10014;603;The main characters, specifically Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) are quite likeable, even without the backstory.
I:10014;604;In fact, what I liked best about the film (and the series) are the characters.
I:10014;605;You'll love it if you love good movies.
I:10014;606;one of my boyfriends favorite movies.
I:10014;607;he was very happy to get it.
I:10014;608;The movie looks great on Blu ray.
I:10014;609;So good that I decided to get the Steelbook version and give this to a friend.
I:10014;610;Fortunately they made a movie and omg it was epic.
I:10014;611;Absolutely entertaining and well written I have this whole movie memorized.
I:10014;612;For me, Serenity was one of the most anticipated movies of 2005.
I:10014;613;Like millions of others, I was immediately drawn into Joss Whedon's show that included characters with realistic emotions, thick and overlapping plots and a great sense of humor, all of which are rarely seen in sci.
I:10014;614;With that being said Fox (as they have done so many times before, latest victim: Arrested Development) prematurely canceled a great series.
I:10014;615;Witty dialogue, well developed, 3.
I:10014;616;d characters, a great story, adventure, and cursing in Chinese.
I:10014;617;Joss Brings back Firefly with the movie Serenity.
I:10014;618;This movie will be a great addition to ANY collection.
I:10014;619;This is a very very good flick, that ties everything from the series, 'Firefly' together.
I:10014;620;It truly is better then the series, and the series was great!This is one of those few Sci.
I:10014;621;fi fantasy flicks that is so much fun to watch, that you wish there was no ending.
I:10014;622;I was a big fan of the Firefly series.
I:10014;623;Serenity is a fun, action packed, science fiction adventure.
I:10014;624;Some of the lines still make me laugh after watching them about twenty times.
I:10014;625;This is a must see for any science fiction fan!
I:10014;626;The amazing thing about this film is that it cost ~$40?
I:10014;627;I might add that I'm a bit jaded when it comes to watching movies these days, so when I like a film, it had to have done something incredibly well.
I:10014;628;Surprisingly we were in a good size theater and there were only six other people there to watch it.
I:10014;629;Hopefully the news of this movie will spread via word of mouth and the theaters will fill up some more.
I:10014;630;gotta say, this was a very good movie.
I:10014;631;fi blockbusters from earlier in the summer that were disappointing, this one really delivers on both effects and story line.
I:10014;632;If you like a good story, lots of action, good character interaction, clever scripting, go see it.
I:10014;633;Its definitly worth the price of admission.
I:10014;634;the discs were both flawless and in top.
I:10014;635;It was truly a pleasure ordering this product.
I:10014;636;This is a solid movie that caps the Firefly project nicely.
I:10014;637;It is rare that movie versions of canceled shows turn out OK, but this one is great.
I:10014;638;It does a good job of telling the story of the Firefly show that was unceremoniously canceled.
I:10014;639;It is also watchable without first watching the series, but seriously: watch the series too.
I:10014;640;Exploring space with a group of people looking for new frontiers and with some good old capitalistic savvy.
I:10014;641;Great adventure, wonderful dialogue anda interesting concept of the universe.
I:10014;642;It's definitely one of a kind.
I:10014;643;Love, love, love this movie and wish it was still on.
I:10014;644;But still a great movie to watch and better with friends.
I:10014;645;This is a great movie with fantastic special effects and a pretty entertaining story.
I:10014;646;This was a great transfer to the big screen.
I:10014;647;Just like all the other fans I would love to see this series resurrected.
I:10014;648;Once the gorram networks get their claws back in the series they will try their best to mold it to their fashion.
I:10014;649;I think the show Firefly is fantastic if a bit overrated.
I:10014;650;I think that everyone involved did a remarkable job in making this both a respectable extension of the television show and an entertaining standalone action movie.
I:10014;651;the dialogue is fresh and believable, the acting is inspired, the characters are as fans will tell you memorable, and the effects are awesome.
I:10014;652;Let's face it though, Joss Whedon's hallmark is coming up with a clever idea, memorable characters and letting the characters and dialog move the show.
I:10014;653;Well at least he was smart enough to know his one weakness and steal from one of the greatest sci.
I:10014;654;Well, at any rate, it's probably the best most original sci.
I:10014;655;fi movie we'll see for some time.
I:10014;656;i'm just a regular gal, okay, a regular middle.
I:10014;657;let yourself drift into that willing suspension of disbelief state of mind that true movie lovers embrace, and join the 'verse that Joss Whedon dreamed up to share with us.
I:10014;658;Serenity was a fabulous television series with complete and full characterizations and usually interesting plots.
I:10014;659;This movie was created by the force of fandom, and while it may not stand up to the best episode of the one.year series, it allows fans to revisit their favorite characters (although it would have been nice to have spent more time with Preacher ).
I:10014;660;Fans will love it, and those who have not seen the series need not be knowledgeable to enjoy the movie.
I:10014;661;I saw some things that reminded me of Star Wars, some of Star Trek, and some of . . . well, other science fiction stories more generally.
I:10014;662;"But that's OK
I:10014;663;at one level, this is a swashbuckling heroes adventure story.
I:10014;664;Lots of technology for the nerds.
I:10014;665;And some rather spacey spiritual stuff, too.
I:10014;666;There's even a touch of romance.
I:10014;667;The fact is, it's got me hoping for a sequel.
I:10014;668;like central government that behaves as if it is benevolent, and may even believe itself to be.
I:10014;669;They don't just eat people, they prefer to eat them while they are still alive.
I:10014;670;there's also a Haven planet, run by a gentle sort called the Shepherd, and there's a mysterious planet that the authorities have gone to great lengths to keep secret.
I:10014;671;Yes, there are lots and lots of threads to this plot.
I:10014;672;The movie tied everything up very nicely.
I:10014;673;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:10014;674;I love the mix of the sci.
I:10014;675;Plus the actors bring their characters to life with humor and passion.
I:10014;676;I give it 5 stars and highly recommend it.
I:10014;677;The crew and the beloved bucket of bolts they call home, return on the big screen this time.
I:10014;678;It is free to be razor sharp, witty and simply enjoyable.
I:10014;679;Joss Whedon manages a near perfect balance between serious action sequences and humor.
I:10014;680;I really recomend this movie.
I:10014;681;It's an excelent movie, not just for the visual effects but because it's a very well told story.
I:10014;682;Every character is well developed in the story and the suspense mixed with a very clever sense of humor keeps you sitting without blinking.
I:10014;683;It's a great movie for us, the lovers of sci.
I:10014;684;This is the best sci.
I:10014;685;This is the best Sci.
I:10014;686;A crackin' good story, great dialog, and excellent special effects.
I:10014;687;and one of the best movies, period, that I've seen in 2005.
I:10014;688;I always enjoy watching it these the whole way through and it never gets old.
I:10014;689;The cast is just a great team.
I:10014;690;'Serenity' is great fun and a triumph in that it re.
I:10014;691;Whoever it is works very hard grooming the others.
I:10014;692;I will start by confessing to be a huge fan of the series where I think Whedon had done a phenomenal job on the character development.
I:10014;693;You really know and care about these people so I will admit to the movie being more enjoyable to fans of the series.
I:10014;694;I do think the movie holds it's own as a separate entity however.
I:10014;695;this movie has superb effects, a great plot, plausible characters and excellent production values.
I:10014;696;This is an excellent movie, that paints the backdrop for Firefly, and explains what really is going on.
I:10014;697;It is our most favorite sci.
I:10014;698;If you aren't familiar with Firefly the series, please give this film a shot.
I:10014;699;The characters are real people, script is witty, and this is a film about loyalty and compassion.
I:10014;700;The storyline is great and you will find yourself caring about these folks long before the end of the movie.
I:10014;701;The series was wonderful in that Joss Whedon way, and the movie will make you long for the next installment.
I:10014;702;Serenity is a tale that I fully recommend to everyone who is intrigued with adventure, loyalty, action and romance.
I:10014;703;The movie exhibits grace, realism, some romance but also a sense for the search of truth and the human element of compassion for others.
I:10014;704;"Each of the individual actors plays his or her part extremely well, and you can clearly sense that they really want to act their part and want to be in that make believe fantasy world
I:10014;705;This element of compassion is a very strong theme in the movie and is the guiding principle from the beginning to the end.
I:10014;706;Even the slightly worn out idea of saving the universe from the manipulation of a degraded empire, still does it extremely well in this beautifully made movie.
I:10014;707;This is one of, if not the best sci.
I:10014;708;The film will be most enjoyable for those who have seen the series, but it's still fun for those who haven't.
I:10014;709;it also has a stronger narrative through.
I:10014;710;(The dialogue has more of a future.
I:10014;711;archaic feel which adds a great deal of realism to the proceedings.)
I:10014;712;Bring on the next sequel!Strongly recommended for fans of Firefly and anyone who loved Han Solo back when he shot first.
I:10014;713;i thought that the death of one of the characters was done particularly for an 'ouch' effect, they're easily the most likable of the bunch and i think it's a real cop.
I:10014;714;At the time, I thought it was a good stand.
I:10014;715;The first time around I wasn't familiar with the characters, but after having seen the series this movie is an amazing summary to a now legendary short.
I:10014;716;I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a movie as fully as I enjoyed Serenity.
I:10014;717;The characters are memorable, and I truly felt for them, something that I seldom find in films recently.
I:10014;718;truly, the film has everything.
I:10014;719;Humour, action, sadness, some kick.
I:10014;720;ass over the top fight sequences, and a whole lot of swearing in Chinese.
I:10014;721;fi, Western, drama, comedy, action.
I:10014;722;adventure, space opera, whatever you want to call it, this film is all heart.
I:10014;723;"An unusually large cast of ""main characters"" is quickly and adeptly introduced to you, each of which is endearing in their own peculiar way."
I:10014;724;A doctor with endless devotion to his sister, a mechanic with an unstoppable sunny disposition, a quirky and somewhat goofy pilot, a caring and wise religious man, a mildly dimwitted yet powerful mercenary, the doctor's tortured and talented young sister, an unfailingly loyal first mate, a stunning and adoring companion, and the rugged realist who captains them all in their attempts to carve out a life for themselves on the edge of civilization.
I:10014;725;the companion is actually a prostitute, and yet somehow she is the only character with any real social status and respectability in society.
I:10014;726;In the amazing world that has been created here, it just seems normal.
I:10014;727;"that being said, so interested in every aspect of the ""verse"" due to brilliant and witty dialogue sprinkled over a deep and involving plot, I could have easily sat for another two hours if they had chosen to dig deeper into this world."
I:10014;728;The world Mr. Whedon has created is teeming with depth and completeness that draws you in quickly, and seems tangible from the first scene.
I:10014;729;there is a heartfelt sincerity and love that is exuding from the experience of this film, and I consider myself lucky to have caught it at the end of its run in the theatres.
I:10014;730;full theatre, the audience actually stood up and applauded this film when it finished.
I:10014;731;this film is all heart.
I:10014;732;Initially, I really liked Serenity.
I:10014;733;"fi movie"", but I was impressed with the visual impact of the film, it had some really good lines, and has a plot that holds together at least as well as any other recent sci."
I:10014;734;It's hard to find good science fiction movies with character and plot.
I:10014;735;This has both and I will watch it again.
I:10014;736;fi Movie and an amazing conclusion to a phenomenal series.
I:10014;737;If you were a fan of the series, you will definitely love Serenity.
I:10014;738;This presentation has every space, cowboy, militaries, and clich in the book.
I:10014;739;Sexy women and bare feet.
I:10014;740;When you see what they were, trying to accomplish the next time through the presentation will be more enjoyable.
I:10014;741;ray treatment is impressive but I never saw the original to compare.
I:10014;742;basic story is about the lives of the crew and visitors on the spaceship Serenity as they are pursued by the authorities for knowledge they may possess that can disrupt the perfect society.
I:10014;743;The characters are very complex, and there's so much behind what appears on the surface to be only an action flick.
I:10014;744;They hit you over the head with their thrall.
I:10014;745;i really enjoyed the story.
I:10014;746;I enjoyed the ambiance of the ship Serenity and it's multiple meaning.
I:10014;747;I really loved the fact that in the movie, none of that was changed.
I:10014;748;One of the best things I can and will say is we want to see it again and we will add it to our video library.
I:10014;749;has it occurred to you that if there is a revival, they were the only two not to commit and could you see them played by any other actor.
I:10014;750;That might sound crazy, but it works so well.
I:10014;751;switching between English and Chinese is perfect and adds character to this great movie.
I:10014;752;Cursing without cursing (like in Battlestar Galatica) is a nice touch.
I:10014;753;She's a true WMD .
I:10014;754;the captain of Serenity has the perfect blend of toughness, honor, and heart.
I:10014;755;Watch the series first if you can, but either way you'll enjoy this over and over.
I:10014;756;the special features and out takes make this worth the price of admission.
I:10014;757;i laughed so hard at Nathan Fillion.
I:10014;758;If laughter's the best medicine, the cast and crew of Firefly are the healthiest people on the planet.
I:10014;759;still a great movie by the way.
I:10014;760;serenity does a good job of projecting people into the future in a believable future.
I:10014;761;Personally, I though this was a wonderful touch to the movie.
I:10014;762;I thought the speech patterns were quite believable.
I:10014;763;serenity does a good job of showing the problem with a future government, the Alliance.
I:10014;764;the effects on the big screen are a lot better than what was done in the TV show of the movie.
I:10014;765;serenity is a fun movie.
I:10014;766;But this movie is a solid grade B+.
I:10014;767;It was quite good and informative.
I:10014;768;if you liked Firefly then you'll really like this movie.
I:10014;769;"That is why I liked this movie
I:10014;770;The movie makes a good addition to your video library.
I:10014;771;And if you saw the series, this will be a great treat, not to be missed.
I:10014;772;The characters you love and their relationships definitely abide .
I:10014;773;I am a huge fan of Firefly and Serenity.
I:10014;774;I saw this and the price was great.
I:10014;775;It arrived in great condition and I plan to watch it many times.
I:10014;776;I'm a fan of Firefly, so I'm biased, but I took a friend along to see Serenity who hadnever seen the series and she loved the movie.
I:10014;777;Lots of action and sly humour everything the series had and more.
I:10014;778;i loved it and can't wait for the next movie, bring it on!
I:10014;779;Don't get me wrong, I loved the series, and was upset when it got cancelled.
I:10014;780;i equate this movie to a modern day Star Wars.
I:10014;781;It has the edgie feel that Star Wars had when it first came out.
I:10014;782;fi movies to make the viewer comfortable, yet original enough to keep the viewer engaged.
I:10014;783;i love this movie, and I think any true sci.
I:10014;784;fi fan will as well.
I:10014;785;But Serenity (and Firefly as well, obviously) does something that most sci.
I:10014;786;it focuses on the characters, their day to day struggles and the things that motivate them.
I:10014;787;Such is the same with the good ship Serenity.
I:10014;788;We've felt the ache as a loved one turned and left.
I:10014;789;So do the characters, and so, even if they are kicking ass, or running in a cowardly fashion, or whatever.
I:10014;790;They are endearing because many of their plights are similar to our own.
I:10014;791;but what it comes down to is good storytelling.
I:10014;792;The music is lilting, lovely, heartbreaking, heroic, haunting, exuberant, fearless.
I:10014;793;Serenity is a movie for everyone.
I:10014;794;Great movie with a little something for everyone.
I:10014;795;Love the humor and Nathan Fillion goes a great job with this role.
I:10014;796;"The Firefly series was truly great
I:10014;797;This movie takes care of that.
I:10014;798;This one was amazingly good.
I:10014;799;I enjoyed it so much that I immediately watched it again with commentary by Joss Whedon.
I:10014;800;Glau's fight sequences were astounding and surprising considering that her character spent most of the series in a catatonic state.
I:10014;801;There are also some surprises that will shock fans of the series.
I:10014;802;finally I was very impressed with the cinematography and lighting.
I:10014;803;I highly recommend the Whedon commentary to gain an even greater appreciation of some of the intricacies of this very fine film.
I:10014;804;There's an abrupt and shocking moment, a fight scene that is a beautiful ballet, and of course the crew of Serenity.
I:10014;805;This is more of a commentary than actual review, and encompasses both the Firefly TV show and Serenity, since they both involve the same characters and subject material:If you didn't have the privilege or pleasure of seeing this amazing series (Firefly) in its short.
I:10014;806;One of my favorite things about any of Joss Whedon's projects, from Buffy, to Angel, and finally Firefly, is that a great deal of time and care is lavished upon fleshing out and exploring the characters that fill the worlds he creates.
I:10014;807;In the final season of Angel, we were shown facets of Angel's personality, past and character we hadn't seen before, and that made him all the more real, likeable and interesting.
I:10014;808;The same is true for Firefly.
I:10014;809;Obviously, there were secrets and details we never learned, such as how a Shepherd would know so much about guns and combat as he does, and where the Reavers came from, but through the magic of the silver screen, Whedon's vision can once again come to life and reveal the rest of the secrets.
I:10014;810;with the movie SERENITY, Whedon was able to bring his characters out of deep freeze and revive their world once again.
I:10014;811;The movie takes place maybe a year after the last episode of the TV series, and we know finally learn more about the characters, River most importantly, and the Reavers.
I:10014;812;4, 5, 6) greatest strength was its focus on the characters and their interactions, especially Empire Strikes Back.
I:10014;813;That's why Firefly and Serenity are amazing, and that is why you should watch them.
I:10014;814;I dislike when a good potential series gets pulled and leaves you hanging, knowing full well there are story and plot lines galore.
I:10014;815;Just plain fun to close out the series.
I:10014;816;This movie is hilarious as well as thrilling.
I:10014;817;I was not prepared (due to the slight humor of the characters) for the ending, which was as amazing as any movie with the best actors, directors and such of today.
I:10014;818;This is such a great movie.
I:10014;819;I love how they concluded the series.
I:10014;820;It's a great ending to a fabulous series.
I:10014;821;The story had something for everyone, scares, screams, laughter and intrigue.
I:10014;822;In some cases you were laughing one second and gasping a second later.
I:10014;823;"River, a teenage girl, was falsely lured away from her family to attend a school for ""gifted"" children."
I:10014;824;But it was a cover for the government to use children with psychic abilities, enhance those natural gifts and use them for their own purposes.
I:10014;825;every character in this movie is interesting and fun to watch.
I:10014;826;Joss Whedon does an excellent job of introducing the characters in the beginning of the movie and getting on with a roller coaster of a story.
I:10014;827;i highly recommend this movie.
I:10014;828;Star Wars was a great franchise and really introduced the world to fantastic big screen adventures and Star Trek took a beloved TV show to the big screen and it was a joy to see but Serenity is the best of both these worlds and manages to be that big screen sci.
I:10014;829;fi adventure that is richly character driven and a blast to experience.
I:10014;830;The film is a strange mixture of Star Wars action / adventure and Blade Runner suspense.
I:10014;831;"He has strong loyalties to his crew and to those who help him in his shadowy half legal / half bandit role as an old fashioned highwayman of the 'verse (contraction for ""universe"")."
I:10014;832;"the heavy, an Alliance ""Operative"" has the determination of an unturned Terminator, who is a lot smarter and more wily than the humanoid androids (and smarter than the replicants of ""Blade Runner"", although the final fight between Reynolds and The Operative is vaguely reminiscent of the fight between Deckard and Roy Batty."
I:10014;833;"the plot resolves two of the biggest questions arising out of the world of the ""Firefly"" series."
I:10014;834;The opening of the story proper (after a flashback on River's rescue) shows part of why she is so valuable.
I:10014;835;She saves the crew's bacon more than once by using that ability.
I:10014;836;The space ship design would probably work in space, but it's ability to land from and take off to space, and fly in the atmosphere, seems quite improbable.
I:10014;837;the cast is strong, and it is great to see Ron Glass (of Barney Miller fame) in a role.
I:10014;838;The most interesting is the triangle between Malcolm the captain, Zoe, his second in command, and her husband, Wash, the pilot.
I:10014;839;there are two of the most unusual fight scenes you will ever see.
I:10014;840;I've watched this movie more time than I can count and I still love watching it over again.
I:10014;841;I'll do a full day Firefly marathon and end with Serenity sometimes.
I:10014;842;and a great ending to the Firefly series.
I:10014;843;great scenario, wonderfull acting by Nathan Fillion and co., lots of action and plenty of that special flavor of humor that made Firefly so enjoyable.
I:10014;844;while Serenity is great by itself, I recommend watching it after Firefly for maximum effect.
I:10014;845;It's very rewarding to see River fulfill her unexploited potential from the series and everything else makes much more sense this way.
I:10014;846;If you simply want to be entertained and are a sci.
I:10014;847;Unexpected plot twists and great characters made this wrap.
I:10014;848;As both a huge Firefly fan and a Nathan Fillian fan back to The Adventures of Briscoe County Jr, I had to have this movie on the best available format.
I:10014;849;Picture is spectacular, and the sound does not disappoint.
I:10014;850;The real wow moments occur when watching the extras.
I:10014;851;This disc includes Visual Commentary by cast and crew, Picture in Picture features including interviews, rehearsals, and behind the scenes stuff you can enjoy while watching the film, a digital tour of the Firefly (very cool), and other stuff.
I:10014;852;A great value considering all the extra stuff that's included.
I:10014;853;A fitting end to a great series.
I:10014;854;Having said that, I firmly believe you needn't ever have seen the TV series to enjoy this movie.
I:10014;855;The first is that it will only appeal to fans of the TV series.
I:10014;856;The cast still clicks like a well.
I:10014;857;Each has multiple aspects and layers that helps us believe that they're real people rather than archetypes.
I:10014;858;Even many of the classics (e. g. 2001) are emotionally sterile.
I:10014;859;While the crew of Serenity might never be the sort of folks I'd seek out to hang around with, they are people I could respect and understand .
I:10014;860;This is one of the best movies of all time!!
I:10014;861;I own it already but i'll be sure and pick this up.
I:10014;862;I really want a sequel!
I:10014;863;Plus it has new special feautres so thats cool as well.
I:10014;864;I always liked the FireFly series and this was a great finally to the series.
I:10014;865;The actors are mainly those from the original series with a couple additions that fit right in.
I:10014;866;the movie gets quite intense in a few areas and does keep you very much interested.
I:10014;867;I didn't want to pause it to take a break but did to kick a few people out of the house so I could watch in peace and continue to enjoy a well.
I:10014;868;All in all it was a great movie that put a lot of information and action into a 2.
I:10014;869;My daughter told me about it, I loved it.
I:10014;870;I liked all the adventures that the crewhave.
I:10014;871;I like the comic relief then it gets back to being serious.
I:10014;872;A really good adventure movie.
I:10014;873;I loved this movie almost as much as the series.
I:10014;874;"It's visually interesting without the special effects being overdone
I:10014;875;"paced and entertaining
I:10014;876;"Reminiscent of the first Star Wars, it shows a ""realistic"" future and ""flawed"" heros rather than the idealistic future and bigger."
I:10014;877;fiction or fantasy, you should steer clear of this gem, as you will never give it a proper chance.
I:10014;878;fiction, fantasy and/or adventure movie.
I:10014;879;This movie was done perfectly from start to finishMake a movieMake one season of the show (Firefly) on TV building up to the movieAir the movie in theatersAnd stopNo sequels, no specials, nothingI watch the show now and then (I don't want to get tired of it) and enjoy it every timeUnique story line and interesting charactersTen stars!
I:10014;880;Everything is perfect: the unique concept, the acting, even the design of the ship.
I:10014;881;Everyone involved in the production cared so much about their project, they bring you in and carry you along.
I:10014;882;explain to me why they took away this incredible series.
I:10014;883;the whole Basque nation, Nixon and McCarthy?
I:10014;884;I also bought the entire series.
I:10014;885;Thanks so much, Amazon!Bought this over a month ago.
I:10014;886;Recommend you do the same!
I:10014;887;I know a guy that professes to enjoy action and science fiction movies and then will confess I have never seen Alien or Aliens.
I:10014;888;up to the incredibly imaginative series Firefly for about the price of a Whopper with cheese!
I:10014;889;I will instead share a passage from the all knowing oracle Wikipedia .
I:10014;890;Serenity has won the following awards:* Film of the year awards from Film 2005 and FilmFocus.
I:10014;891;fi, Best Story and Best Trailer awards and runner up to Batman Begins for the Overall Best Movie.
I:10014;892;* 2006 Viewers Choice Spacey Award for favorite movie.
I:10014;893;* Voted as the Best Film of 2006 by the writers for the website Box Office Prophets and it came 12th Best film of 2006 in the website's readers poll.
I:10014;894;up: Nathan Fillion* Best Actress/Movie Runner.
I:10014;895;up: Summer Glau* SFX magazine's best sci.
I:10014;896;This movie is a worthy continuation (and conclusion) of the TV series.
I:10014;897;Smart, funny, action packed, and with a great story too.
I:10014;898;But to love it you have to have seen and loved the series.
I:10014;899;What a great story, I will see anything written or directed by Joss Whedon.
I:10014;900;I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters without knowledge that it was a movie made from a tv series, and loved it instantly.
I:10014;901;I would highly recommend seeing both.
I:10014;902;After seeing Firefly my love for this movie grew so much more.
I:10014;903;I can't say that it is one of the year's best but I can say that it deserves a chance.
I:10014;904;this film is a great ride.
I:10014;905;"The film is funny
I:10014;906;Serenity is better than most of the Star Trek movies, certainly the last 6, and I'm a trekky.
I:10014;907;This movie is a smart, witty, exciting sci.
I:10014;908;Oh: and the zombies are created by drugs the powers.
I:10014;909;well, the western music in the series intro and ending, is good.
I:10014;910;technically, the special effects and scenery are worth watching once.
I:10014;911;So some genius decides to make it into a feature length film with a huge budget and guess what.
I:10014;912;Just a short background, my girlfriend who normally does not like scifi movies loved this.
I:10014;913;"The movie itself is as she described "" cute and fun to watch, wish I saw it in the cinema first ""."
I:10014;914;spirited adventuring styles of Buck Rogers and Luke Skywalker.
I:10014;915;and in 2005, we got Serenity, and a reminder of what made movies like Star Wars a joy in the first place.
I:10014;916;"His compatriots (some of whom qualify as friends) consist of a brilliant and lovestruck mechanic, Kaylee
I:10014;917;and yet, these characters, troubled though they are at times, are what makes this tale so incredible, and despite its tragedy, so uplifting and joyous.
I:10014;918;paced action, witty banter, and real, full characters that provide such a great emotional anchor that you geniunely care about the entire world (or worlds) they live in.
I:10014;919;fashioned shootouts, it is the way the characters resonate with the audience that really makes it feel magical.
I:10014;920;with surprisingly skillfull camera work for a first.
I:10014;921;time movie director (thanks to help from technical veterans of movies like Mystic River), as well as more than a little help from David Newman's brilliant score, Serenity soars to new heights of the kind of emotion and entertainment that science fiction can offer.
I:10014;922;Joss Whedon went beyond contemporary standards when he wrote and directed this masterpiece of science fiction.
I:10014;923;The power is of course dimmed by not watching it in a theatre, but the beauty is still preserved is this widescreen edition.
I:10014;924;I recommend watching it, eventually, with the director commentary.
I:10014;925;It brings another dimension to the production.
I:10014;926;I loved the series, but the movie wasn't as good.
I:10014;927;The people I loved in the series seemed more self absorbed.
I:10014;928;Both the show and the movie are basically a space western with the same great characters (this movie takes place after the show).
I:10014;929;The show is better but this movie is great!
I:10014;930;it's so great to see the entire cast together.
I:10014;931;They all play off each other and each have their own interesting dynamics.
I:10014;932;Plain and simple, this is a wonderfully enjoyable sci.
I:10014;933;It has everything you could ask for, intelligent plot, strong chemistry between cast members, excellent special effects, great fight sequences with that blithe little dynamo River (Summer Glau) and lots of cannibalistic zombie.
I:10014;934;Add to the mix the very sexy Inara (Morena Baccarin) and you've got a big hit on your hands.
I:10014;935;the cast also includes: Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite (my personal favorite), Sean Maher, Chiwetel Ejiofor and David Krumholtz as Mr. Universe.
I:10014;936;all and all great fun to be had in front of the T. v. set.
I:10014;937;So get your popcorn and soft drink and you're good to go!
I:10014;938;The series was as compelling as this movie.
I:10014;939;great followup to the Firefly series that wraps things up nicely and answers many outstanding questions.
I:10014;940;I thought this was without a doubt the best Sci.
I:10014;941;if you have not seen the Firefly series and are a Sci Fi fan, you will enjoy this movie.
I:10014;942;If you are already aquainted with the Firefly 'verse, you will probably love this movie.
I:10014;943;The special features are also above average, especially the audio commentary by Joss Whedon.
I:10014;944;Be sure to look for the easter egg because inside is a delicious Fruity Oaty Bar!Remember, you cannot stop the signal!
I:10014;945;This was a wonderful action packed Sci.
I:10014;946;fi film that I enjoyed in 2005 in the theater and enjoyed just as much again.
I:10014;947;The characters are well developed and the story is entertaining and engaging.
I:10014;948;i highly recommend this movie and the series.
I:10014;949;that said I absolutely loved this film.
I:10014;950;story, visuals, acting, directing, score.you name it.
I:10014;951;if you're looking for a sci fi movie that is fresh and unique give this one a spin.
I:10014;952;This is one incredible movie.
I:10014;953;The action here is incredible, and unlike several of the Star Trek movies, the characters don't deviate from their series personnas.
I:10014;954;The emotional impact of several scenes is so intense it was hard to stay seated (a crash landing sequence can almost give you motion sickness).
I:10014;955;This brings a satisfying end to the storyline the original series had started.
I:10014;956;the ending the show deserved.
I:10014;957;Heroes will shine, and some will fall, but Serenity will live on.
I:10014;958;now bring the show back!
I:10014;959;Firefly was a show that I am proud to call my favorite television show of all time despite the fact that only fourteen episodes exist.
I:10014;960;The show is my favorite because of the ideas behind it, a sci.
I:10014;961;fi western filled with clever dialouge, lovable characters and episodes with plots that were highly original.
I:10014;962;fi in the movie is perfect, it focuses on the shadowy high tech government of the Allaince so it all feels in place.
I:10014;963;wise in the picture were the Reavers, who never really appeared on the show.
I:10014;964;Anyway, the movie is great and it is a sci.
I:10014;965;fi movie for the ages.
I:10014;966;"If you enjoyed ""Firefly"" the series, you'll love this movie."
I:10014;967;It successfully picks up most of the plot strings where the series finale dropped them.
I:10014;968;The actors fall effortlessly back into their roles.
I:10014;969;Nathan Fillion deserves special praise.
I:10014;970;If anything, he's made Mal even more the perfect tragic hero than he was in the series.
I:10014;971;Firefly was a show that I knew I loved within seconds of starting the first episode.
I:10014;972;I am so glad that Joss Whedon was able to bring back the beloved characters from Firefly in this fantastic movie.
I:10014;973;If you liked firefly you will like the movie.
I:10014;974;great story line, actors, chemistry.
I:10014;975;Serenity should herald a return of the series and franchise movies for decades.
I:10014;976;If you loved the first Star Wars movie because of a half.
I:10014;977;miscreant with a sarcastic sense of humor about everything including himself, who loved his bag.
I:10014;978;you'll be proud to call yourself a Browncoat like the rest of us.
I:10014;979;They did a great job on this special edition from the box to the commentary with the cast members.
I:10014;980;The commentary is a lot of fun, and it is clear that the actors really enjoyed playing these roles.
I:10014;981;We enjoyed this in the theatre and now at home.
I:10014;982;We hope to see a second movie!
I:10014;983;This movie beats Star Wars by light years.
I:10014;984;i don't understand how the original show failed to make it, but I am glad to have discovered it, and it was right to bring closure to the series with this Serenity Movie.
I:10014;985;Great characters, witty dialog, action, laughs.
I:10014;986;Love the interplay between the actors.
I:10014;987;I would recommend to anybody .
I:10014;988;He peopled this world with an interesting group of misfits who somehow became a family by Episode 14.
I:10014;989;whedon keeps the film running smoothly for its entire run time and the film looks more epic than the TV show ever could.
I:10014;990;As a side note the cinematography of Jack Green looks fantastic even though I enjoyed the work of David Boyd on the television show a little more with its rougher edged look.
I:10014;991;The music is now by David Newman and ids much more thematic than that of Greg Edmonson.
I:10014;992;this may be one that appeals more to fans of the original series but the film stands on its own quite well.
I:10014;993;By all means see it.
I:10014;994;This is the best film of 2005.
I:10014;995;If you like good movies, you'll like this.
I:10014;996;The Serenity characters/universe has to continue.
I:10014;997;Joss, when your done with Wonder Woman, please make more Serenity movies.
I:10014;998;"Joss said it well, both through his characters and personally, ""We did the impossible, that makes us mighty."
I:10014;999;serenity came about because Joss, the cast and crew, and the fans would not let such a special story die.
I:10014;1000;The character was well written and well performed.
I:10014;1001;the hero, Captain Mal Reynolds, had to learn a lesson.
I:10014;1002;the Firefly/Serenity story is one of individual struggle, freedom, and life.
I:10014;1003;"Favorite quote at the end of the last scene: ""What a whiner!"""
I:10014;1004;This movie was absolutely perfect!
I:10014;1005;What a great movie and a very good cast.
I:10014;1006;The nice part is that I get to watch the series now.
I:10014;1007;There's no question that that kind of stuff can cause an adrenaline rush, and be entertaining.
I:10014;1008;Then when you see the outside of the ship while it is taking off you see it going through an amazing number of spins and loops.
I:10014;1009;Makes for a fun mental image.
I:10014;1010;I loved this movie, definitely watch the Firefly series before you watch this, some of the more impactful parts won't mean as much if you don't.
I:10014;1011;i just want to thank him for giving us an ending to a fantastic show .
I:10014;1012;that is the sign of a true storyteller, I hope that he never stops.
I:10014;1013;Though the movie was two hours long, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it, never losing interest.
I:10014;1014;It's a rare movie that can make you laugh, while keeping you tense, and show you loyalty and love at it's best along with absolute despair and the worst of human nature.
I:10014;1015;It's intelligent, emotional, charming and thought.
I:10014;1016;provoking and the leading man, Nathan Fillion is wonderful to watch.
I:10014;1017;Even that hair on Shepard kinda has it's appeal.
I:10014;1018;If you liked Star Trek, if you liked Dune, if you liked the Fifth Element, LOTR, Independence Day.
I:10014;1019;Joss Whedon creates a masterpiece in Serenity.
I:10014;1020;And you can't help but care about the crew of Serenity.
I:10014;1021;They are the underdogs in the story and they are so likable you can't help but root for them.
I:10014;1022;the movie does well to explain where main thread of the story comes from, but to really appreciate it you need to see the original series 'FireFly'.
I:10014;1023;the movie has a lot of drama, action, humor.
I:10014;1024;But the real reason to appreciate it is that the characters have a sense of what is right.
I:10014;1025;"And they are willing to give up everything
I:10014;1026;It just lets you know that the editors did their job.
I:10014;1027;So glad I got this move along with the Firefly series!
I:10014;1028;Excellent follow up to the series.
I:10014;1029;I had missed the characters and loved seeing them again.
I:10014;1030;Also liked that they were able to tie up some loose ends.
I:10014;1031;First, it was brilliantly cast, the writing was amazing and extremely original.
I:10014;1032;I especially thought it was profound the way they wrote in an assassin with a hearing problem, who else does this????
I:10014;1033;When I heard about Serenity I was both happy and sad since my hopes that a move response would bring the show or at least another movie back.
I:10014;1034;well the Movie by far was above my expectations.
I:10014;1035;But, again, well written and if indeed this is the last of this great creation, Joss did a hell of a job making his lasting mark.
I:10014;1036;I hope with the response, however, that the open ending he did leave is able to be realized and we see a continuation of this amazing creation.
I:10014;1037;thank you Joss for keeping this alive!
I:10014;1038;Perhaps it is because I never watched the series or perhaps it is because I also have good taste.
I:10014;1039;so please people, stop giving this movie four and five stars.
I:10014;1040;With all the action and visual splendor that the movie entices viewers with, the true essence of the film lies with its characters.
I:10014;1041;The world that Whedon beautifully illustrates is one that speaks of truth and companionship.
I:10014;1042;esqe world, in the end, its the people that are around us that make what we fight for everyday worthwhile.
I:10014;1043;As a sci fi fan I enjoyed this film and in Hi Def it was even better.
I:10014;1044;joss Whedon has a nack for telling a story and making you care for the characters.
I:10014;1045;the film is rich with wit, humor and adventure.
I:10014;1046;Serenity is a brilliant film.
I:10014;1047;Moving, funny, and just the right amount of action, it's a genuinely powerful sci.
I:10014;1048;The fact is, despite having one of the most human stories I've seen, Firefly holds a universe that takes some getting used to.
I:10014;1049;See the series, then the movie.
I:10014;1050;fi as a rule, you will love it.
I:10014;1051;Thank goodness Joss Wheadon was able to do this movie to wrap.
I:10014;1052;up a really great TV series!!!!
I:10014;1053;This movie is a must.
I:10014;1054;see for all Firefly fans, and for anyone who just loves a great action flick.
I:10014;1055;Serenity did a great job of continuing the story of our BDHs, and the collector's edition has a lot of great extras that make it even better.
I:10014;1056;I loved it so much I sent a copy to my son!
I:10014;1057;Every time I watched it I loved it more and more.
I:10014;1058;The cast is great, the story is great!
I:10014;1059;I really hope that in the near future Joss Whedon (a genius) will find a backer that wants to bring back Firefly.
I:10014;1060;It has the fans, it has the demand.
I:10014;1061;America (and most of the world) has a romance with the ones who lose, the underdogs, the fighters of lost causes with a true merit of their own.
I:10014;1062;written, with inteligent (but somewhat naive) plots and very decent visual effects.
I:10014;1063;names show, as for most of the actors, this was their really big break.
I:10014;1064;Firefly has a huge fan.
I:10014;1065;base that rivals that one of Star Trek and Star Wars.
I:10014;1066;Raw, new material for the browncoats around the world.
I:10014;1067;Good acting, an intelligent script (in some poetic ways, above average for a Sci.
I:10014;1068;Such as Firefly, it deserved better.
I:10014;1069;You'll get an excellent story, packed with action and stunning visuals.
I:10014;1070;Nuture the browncoat inside you.
I:10014;1071;Getting movies here is the best thing, in fact I have a list I'm creating in my wish list .
I:10014;1072;It's a good watch for both avid Firefly fans and newcomers alike.
I:10014;1073;He did a great job.
I:10014;1074;This film can stand alone from the series, but is a good resolution of the story.
I:10014;1075;I know many other people have said it, but it's worth repeating.
I:10014;1076;This is well worth watching.
I:10014;1077;I loved the t. v. series so I bought the movie.
I:10014;1078;especially the audio commentary with Joss and a few castmembers is a real treat.
I:10014;1079;This movie is, in a word, fantastic.
I:10014;1080;It proves the power of what a fandom can do when the love for a series is strong enough.
I:10014;1081;Serenity keeps all the heart, all the dazzle, all the strength of the Firefly series, while adding the sort of sparkle that a feature film needs.
I:10014;1082;"Browncoats and newcomers alike can enjoy this
I:10014;1083;the story itself is wildly entertaining.
I:10014;1084;For all it's set five hundred years in the future, it's still just people, it's still all the fancies and foibles of life.
I:10014;1085;"He creates a true ""space western"" with the sort of energy and liveliness not seen since the original Star Wars trilogy ."
I:10014;1086;and he does it with better dialogue, and less focus on flashy special effects.
I:10014;1087;"Each character is engaging
I:10014;1088;The dialogue is very natural, and unexpected.
I:10014;1089;But most of all, the movie makes you feel.
I:10014;1090;the special features, incidentally, are also delightful.
I:10014;1091;The deleted scenes are treasures, and Whedon's commentary on them is fascinating, and all of the featurettes showing Whedon and the cast and crew are so heartfelt and so entertaining.
I:10014;1092;Definitely worth watching, just as Whedon's commentary is worth listening to.
I:10014;1093;After a quite confusing beginning (I had not seen the firefly series), I eventually got into this movie and really enjoyed it.
I:10014;1094;fi is hard to come by: the scince has to be plausible, the fiction has to be fascinating and it has to somehow make sense as a possible future or alternative reality.
I:10014;1095;"So much science fiction falls short in one fo these three categories, but ""Serenity"" succeeds on all levels."
I:10014;1096;The cosmology is credible, the story is gripping and the carachters are very enjoyable.
I:10014;1097;If there is a sequel I will be first in the queue to see it.
I:10014;1098;Nathan Fillion, as always, is wonderful.
I:10014;1099;This was a Christmas gift for my daughter.
I:10014;1100;She said it was one of the best gift she got.
I:10014;1101;I liked Firefly , and it was a sort of an extension of it.
I:10014;1102;I enjoyed it all,except the pilot dying.
I:10014;1103;That's how great this movie is.
I:10014;1104;Characters are believable and all actors are superb in playing them.
I:10014;1105;Many twists to the movie leaving you on the edge of your seat and one particular one leaving your mouth.
I:10014;1106;open from disbelief!This is a movie that can be highly enjoyed by non.
I:10014;1107;This is enjoyable even for first.
I:10014;1108;The characters have been developed since the Firefly shows.
I:10014;1109;For Nathan Fillion fans (yes, I confess that I join those ranks), he is great in this movie .
I:10014;1110;I especially enjoyed the development of the River character.
I:10014;1111;it is worth the wait.
I:10014;1112;finally a intelligent movie from a canceled series , you do not see much air time from some of the major stars but still worth the look.
I:10014;1113;Big yahoo is finally get to see Summer Glau do her best performance, she takes on the Reavers single handed and the bar fight with Summer also known as character River Tam is way beyond the wall nice to see Simon and Kaylee finally come together This is for the person who does not fit in the box or follow the main stream.
I:10014;1114;I watched every episode of the Firefly seasons and enjoyed each one.
I:10014;1115;The core actors move with the ample story from TV to the movies in seamless characters and plot.
I:10014;1116;I am transported into their world and find the experience refreshing whether spending an evening at home, or from the road as a break from the workday.
I:10014;1117;I got this as a gift for my daughter.
I:10014;1118;If you liked Firefly then you will love this if you don't have it.
I:10014;1119;Great addition to anyone's film library.
I:10014;1120;This is an awesome movie, great story, River is awesome, love what they did with the reavers.
I:10014;1121;Needless to say he kept bragging about how we're going to see the movie the day it opens, etc.
I:10014;1122;"I kept thinking ""oh great"" another Star Wars kind of movie."
I:10014;1123;But in the end, I thought it was excellent.
I:10014;1124;Excellent movie bringing insight and excitement to the Firefly series .
I:10014;1125;combines action, humor, and ethics in a wild sci.
I:10014;1126;If you're not into Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, or any of that stuff, you will probably still enjoy this flick.
I:10014;1127;The themes and people will grab you and provide that good old.
I:10014;1128;They are, in short, fantastic.
I:10014;1129;They fit with each other, and play off each other, SO well you just literally fall in love with all of them.
I:10014;1130;"I harken their chemistry to the original Star Wars cast's
I:10014;1131;Whedon does it well, and it shows.
I:10014;1132;Plenty of memorable quotes, plenty of fun lines that have you chuckling in even the most dire of scenes, it's just excellent, I think.3).
I:10014;1133;The universe Whedon has created is, at least, creative .
I:10014;1134;The merging of cultures and customs is very interesting, and believable, and the whole Han Solo meets Wild Wild West in China is really unique and likeable.4).
I:10014;1135;The action and special effects are quite good.
I:10014;1136;and a lil bit o' #1), it's very entertaining.
I:10014;1137;"good, or ""rich"" at least."
I:10014;1138;"That's right
I:10014;1139;and Serenity is quite a good film.
I:10014;1140;And, hopefully, you will enjoy it, and with luck, you'll come out having seen a film that you, dare I say, love.
I:10014;1141;"personally, I didn't ""love"" it, but still, it gets a solid 4.5/5 from me."
I:10014;1142;Of course I loved this movie and cry every time at the end.
I:10014;1143;out the best space opera ever made.
I:10014;1144;All of the elements fit together perfectly .
I:10014;1145;action, suspense, humor, romance, comeraderie.
I:10014;1146;"Each character becomes real and I was completely immersed in their ""verse"" from the opening titles to the closing credits."
I:10014;1147;I highly recommend viewing the complete series before watching the movie.
I:10014;1148;Although the film stands on its own, the background of the TV show really completes the picture for you, making the highs higher and the lows lower.
I:10014;1149;this flick really delivers on all the hype.
I:10014;1150;This was a great film.
I:10014;1151;It is much more creative and much more a think piece than the trailer would indicate.
I:10014;1152;recovery Operations for the Apollo Project, courtesy of North American Aviation, who also brought you the Mitchell B.52!
I:10014;1153;I was hooked from the opening sequence, and decided by the time the movie was over that I had to own it.
I:10014;1154;"It is not a typical CGI, special effects laden movie, this is a rarity in Hollywood these days
I:10014;1155;A deadly game of cat and mouse between the wily Captain Reynolds and the dangerous Operative ensues, and soon many innocent lives hang in the balance.
I:10014;1156;As the antihero, Captain Reynolds (played wonderfully by Nathan Fillion) seldom does anything you expect him to do, but always manages to make things interesting.
I:10014;1157;fi fan, this is one you will want to check out.
I:10014;1158;"My wife, my 19 year old daughter, and my 7 year old son all loved this movie
I:10014;1159;the subject line gives away my entire review: I love this movie.
I:10014;1160;The tale of just how this movie came to be is a gripping rollercoaster tale in itself, but the tales within are where the magic really happens.
I:10014;1161;and that's one of the charms of this movie .
I:10014;1162;fi takes us places that are so magnificent that you want to pause the movie and just take in the sights.
I:10014;1163;From behind the scenes to stars quite literally singing the praises of their on.
I:10014;1164;screen personas, this is a worthy addition to the collection of those who like a good yarn that rings true.
I:10014;1165;This moving fills in gaps.
I:10014;1166;This film deserves A+ status from me and I would only hope they make another one!
I:10014;1167;This is a movie that gets better with each watching.
I:10014;1168;I loved Firefly and this film was a fitting, big.
I:10014;1169;thanks to Joss Whedon, thanks to the spectacular cast .
I:10014;1170;sparkling performances across the board .
I:10014;1171;and thanks to Universal for taking a chance.
I:10014;1172;now, can we please have our sequel?
I:10014;1173;It is the feature film that was made to tie.
I:10014;1174;The movie delivers on every level.
I:10014;1175;It is a great story and includes all of the original main characters.
I:10014;1176;Great action and a satisfying conclusion to the series.
I:10014;1177;favorite TV show of all time.
I:10014;1178;It was the best movie experience I've had since Fifth Element.
I:10014;1179;the characters are the best ever witnessed.
I:10014;1180;The dialogue is so gripping and so quick.
I:10014;1181;n. clever that you will love each and every line.
I:10014;1182;The chemistry between the crew members and the script is perfection.
I:10014;1183;A MUST own for any movie fan, of any genre.
I:10014;1184;and if anyone's curious, Browncoat all the way!
I:10014;1185;Epic conclusion to a staggering achievement in tv.
I:10014;1186;A truely wonderful film with great action, thrills, laughs, cries, scares, and the wittiest dialogue around.
I:10014;1187;enjoy, take the kids, and tell your friends.
I:10014;1188;This was a Christmas present for one of our dear friends we told about this movie.
I:10014;1189;"Was more than pleasantly surprised, bought the TV series ""Firefly"" as a result."
I:10014;1190;"well, this is your lucky day, my friend
I:10014;1191;"Joss Whedon has brought you an early Christmas present called ""Serenity."""
I:10014;1192;"That last was a special kind of show
I:10014;1193;Word spread, mostly fan to fan.
I:10014;1194;You see, they loved the show and it's characters and the folks who gave them life so much that they were willing to do the promotion Fox wouldn't spring for.
I:10014;1195;the plot: Five hundred years in the future, Earth has become uninhabitable, and the human race has moved on to a new solar system made up of dozens of terraformed planets.
I:10014;1196;There is a bloody civil war between the government of the inner core of planets, known as the Alliance, and a rag.
I:10014;1197;The Alliance, of course, prevails.
I:10014;1198;well, we're still not quite sure.
I:10014;1199;But an excellent script and a cast that have to rely on talent rather than name recognition make this movie so much more than the sum of it's parts.
I:10014;1200;You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer, you'll tell your friends and drag 'em to the theatre and wait in line three days for the sequel.
I:10014;1201;The amazing thing about Serenity is how seamlessly Joss Whedon manages to move from the television series to the movie.
I:10014;1202;In a few quick minutes, all the background needed to enjoy the movieis revealed.
I:10014;1203;The combination of old west and space opera fits smoothly and the adventure is off and running before you know it.
I:10014;1204;the movie has everything you need in a science fiction action adventure.
I:10014;1205;It has some terrific action sequences, character development that benefits from the actors knowing each other and their characters for an entire TV season, and some insight into the human situation as well.
I:10014;1206;If you're a newcomer, this is the sci.
I:10014;1207;The cast was each perfectly cast, with the strong lead of the captain.
I:10014;1208;Just absolutely the perfect formula.
I:10014;1209;Awesome movie and great wrap up to a brilliant show.
I:10014;1210;Great, memorable characters that are tons of fun.
I:10014;1211;Fun plot lines, great action.
I:10014;1212;Somehow crosses western and sci.
I:10014;1213;I'd vent my grief about it's early demise, but there's plenty of other fans that are taking care of that.
I:10014;1214;Serenity is billed as a stand.
I:10014;1215;The movie has the same interesting characters, wonderful universe, and mix of tragedy and humor that appealed to television audiences.
I:10014;1216;I will warn you that this is a conclusion .
I:10014;1217;and therefore has a sense of finality and change to it.
I:10014;1218;overall, this film is an excellent sendoff to a series that was canceled before its time.
I:10014;1219;I am a big fan of Science Fiction which stretches the imagination.
I:10014;1220;I highly recommend this movie.
I:10014;1221;The actors are really talented and I can't wait to see them in other things.
I:10014;1222;Nathan Fillion, in particular, is so expressive and easy on the eyes as well.
I:10014;1223;You really need to see the series before viewing this movie.
I:10014;1224;Though not perfect, it is a decent ending to the saga that was Firefly.
I:10014;1225;This is a great Sci.
I:10014;1226;I bet star wars are best ever then serenity.
I:10014;1227;Loved the show and loved the movie.
I:10014;1228;great movie, Joss should be directing Star Wars.
I:10014;1229;IMO this concludes the series quite well.
I:10014;1230;I enjoyed Serenity very much.
I:10014;1231;It wrapped the series up very nicely.
I:10014;1232;Best movie I've seen in a very long time!
I:10014;1233;as the series, keep watching, you'll constantly see something you didn't catch the first.
I:10014;1234;keep on sending the Serenity signal !
I:10014;1235;Lots of action, kind of strange.
I:10014;1236;I really wanted to watch the movie.
I:10014;1237;The lovable diverse interesting cast of firefly are no longer so.
I:10014;1238;Serenity stands on its own as a tremendously enjoyable action movie, but falling desperately in love with the characters and the ship made the experience of the watching the film deeply moving.
I:10014;1239;It's funny, it's exciting, it's scary, it's heartbreaking, and above all, a really good time.
I:10014;1240;I have to agree with OSC, it is quite possibly one of the finest Sci Fi films that I have ever seen.
I:10014;1241;this is a film with multiple layers.
I:10014;1242;the action is intense and the fight scenes fantastic.
I:10014;1243;The first minutes of the film are some of the best backstory filling that I've ever seen done.
I:10014;1244;After I was used to the cadence of their lingo, I found it charming.
I:10014;1245;A great ending to a great show.
I:10014;1246;If you watched the show you must finish the adventure.
I:10014;1247;Yes, it's true you don't need to watch the TV show to enjoy the Serenity movie.
I:10014;1248;It's clear a lot of effort and love went into a project that by all rights never should have happened.
I:10014;1249;With it's intelligent writing and great cast, just like Firefly deserved a full run, this movie deserves to be a mega.
I:10014;1250;Great companion for fans of the series.
I:10014;1251;This is an awesome special edition.
I:10014;1252;Firefly was one of the greatest tv shows ever and this movie follows suit perfectly.
I:10014;1253;I think they did a good job.
I:10014;1254;I really enjoyed the film.
I:10014;1255;Serenity was a great movie, just as Firefly was an awesome show.
I:10014;1256;This is an amazing movie, one of the best science fiction movies of quite some time.
I:10014;1257;there are some inside and character jokes in the movie that you just won't get if you have not seen the series, but the movie is still amazing and you will really enjoy it.
I:10014;1258;the inside humour and character jokes are simply icing on one beautiful cake.
I:10014;1259;It was a nice way to wrap up the episodes that were produced for the series, while allowing for future possibilites with the universe.
I:10014;1260;I would still like to see a follow.
I:10014;1261;He is amazing and the show should have gone on.
I:10014;1262;Even if you never saw a Firefly episode you'll still love the movie if you are a sci.
I:10014;1263;Anyway, my brother is obsessed with this movie, so I got this special edition, and I was pleasantly surprised.
I:10014;1264;This is worth it, but I wish they would have told us before we got the first edition!
I:10014;1265;Big fan of the series (Firefly) and huge fan of this movie.
I:10014;1266;alone movie for all to enjoy.
I:10014;1267;I enjoyed the captain's wit, and the whole experience of the crew, much better then any of the new Star Wars movies for me.
I:10014;1268;That speaks volume about how great the show is without seeing it.
I:10014;1269;This movie has a great storyline, characters, actors, potential.
I:10014;1270;A great compliment along with the tv show.
I:10014;1271;lived, they gotta give in eventually and release more content!
I:10014;1272;This is by far the best sci fi I've seen in quite a while.
I:10014;1273;Great storyline, and both myself and my wife feel that the movie does a good job of banishing the 'pretty boy' main characters so often seen in cinema now.
I:10014;1274;Yes its all great to have the bad guys costing around 10,000+ dollars a piece for costume and wardrobe in a sci.
I:10014;1275;thanks for reading, this film is a must see for sci.
I:10014;1276;Serenity is obviously loved by those who are meant to see it.
I:10014;1277;I think it's good science fiction, just not great science fiction.
I:10014;1278;I think the last third of the film is a blast.
I:10014;1279;The story is good, though not without problems, and the acting is good.
I:10014;1280;The special effects are fantastic.
I:10014;1281;fiction like Minority Report or Blade Runner, but it will satisfy any genre fans for sure.
I:10014;1282;Serenity is an excellent example of a movie done the right way.
I:10014;1283;An imaginative idea, a well written script with a mix of action, emotion and humor and a good cast to carry it all off.
I:10014;1284;serenity is exciting, funny and beautiful to look at.
I:10014;1285;It takes little time for the movie to draw you into its world and have you care about the crew and what happens to them.
I:10014;1286;The special effects are excellent and the fight scene between River and the Reavers is worth the price of admission alone.
I:10014;1287;Serenity is a great movie that I knew nothing about before I saw it.
I:10014;1288;I remembered watching this movie and saying to myself wow this movie is great how was this not a bigger hit.
I:10014;1289;The movie features Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, and Adam Baldwin.
I:10014;1290;The movie has a great cast and writing is also great, which is to be expected from a Joss Whedon movie.
I:10014;1291;The visual effect are first class and the movie in my opinion is great from beginning to end.
I:10014;1292;Once you see this movie will be a big fan and it will make you want to watch all of Joss's other projects.
I:10014;1293;i enjoyed this movie and I would definitely recommend it.
I:10014;1294;thank you for reading my review.
I:10014;1295;You've heard all the rave reviews, and based on the box office returns you still ignored this brilliant film.
I:10014;1296;It is enjoyable for anyone regardless of whether you have seen an episode of the tv series.
I:10014;1297;I have an official lobby poster from the movie hanging in my house.
I:10014;1298;fi movies, yeah, studio marketing, boo.
I:10014;1299;This is a fun entertaining movie.
I:10014;1300;Even people who aren't too terribly interested in science fiction will enjoy this movie.
I:10014;1301;All in all, a great flick!
I:10014;1302;Serenity is a fitting and awesome conclusion to this story.
I:10014;1303;As for the Western aspect of the movie, well in the show they didn't just come out and say it but there is a good reason why it has a western feel to it with a touch of Chinese heritage.
I:10014;1304;So much so that Joss Whedon felt he had grounds to finish the series in a full length feature film and he did.
I:10014;1305;The Alliance is the major power in Firefly, from what I understand the Allaince is comprised of what were the remnants of the Earth's western powers(United States/Great Britain) and China.
I:10014;1306;Inara, who plays the companion is a great example of this and is almost always wearing a gown that has a Chinese or oriental style to it.
I:10014;1307;What happens when our beliefs collapse and we are shown we are wrong?In the end, the primary adversary to the crew, a nameless Alliance assassin shows that he has as much nobility and courage of spirit as anyone else, and when confronted with the nature of his own beliefs, makes a surprising turn.
I:10014;1308;Joss Whedon has created a masterpiece with Serenity/Firefly.
I:10014;1309;The movie is better than the series.
I:10014;1310;The movie has the perfect balance of action, drama, comedy, and special effects.
I:10014;1311;one great thing about the movie is how you care for the crew.
I:10014;1312;Throughout the movie you care for the characters.
I:10014;1313;It was a great addition to the Firefly story and I really hope someday that Joss Whedon comes to his senses and makes a second one.
I:10014;1314;I definitely recommend this to any fan of sci.
I:10014;1315;Anyone who enjoys science fiction will enjoy the movie.
I:10014;1316;sharp and detailed throughout, nearly 3.
I:10014;1317;I am a huge Firefly fan, but you don't have to be to enjoy this movie.
I:10014;1318;it's not a comedy, but there are funny moments.
I:10014;1319;Plenty of action for the action fans, but good plot for the story lovers.You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to see it again
I:10014;1320;I've decided that Serenity is the perfect movie.
I:10014;1321;It is hilarious, action packed, emotional and the special effects are amazing.
I:10014;1322;This movie has something for everyone.
I:10014;1323;"fi"" genre, you will love this movie I guarantee."
I:10014;1324;The characters are unique, quirky and memorable, especially Mal, who is striking (not to mention gorgeous).
I:10014;1325;The character of River is fascinating as well, graceful yet deadly.
I:10014;1326;It is an awesome movie!
I:10014;1327;This is a really great Sci fi movie and series.
I:10014;1328;If you are a true Sci fi fan, this is a great movie.
I:10014;1329;This was a very cool show maybe more like a western than a space opera but pleasant, funny had a very likable cast that meshed well.
I:10014;1330;The Serenity Movie does a pretty good job of tying up the television show, has some interesting twists allows the River character to show her chops.
I:10014;1331;I could go on and touch on the good plot points but why spoil it.
I:10014;1332;ah tour de force but it's compact, personal, the players work well together.
I:10014;1333;The story idea has some very original ideas in it.
I:10014;1334;I've watched this several times well worth a look
I:10014;1335;I will watch it many more times.
I:10014;1336;Great story and good action for a Sci.
I:10014;1337;the first Star Wars trilogy left such a mark on cinema because it had funny moments as well as drama and action.
I:10014;1338;"Lately though the recent trilogy has a feeling of ""talk talk talk, action, talk talk talk and by the way look at our awesome effects""."
I:10014;1339;done as it contains many funny dialogue, moments of character and even some well.
I:10014;1340;designed action sequences including an early chase scene in the valley.
I:10014;1341;Then we have the commentary with him alone who manages to be witty and funny and quite informative at the same time.
I:10014;1342;if you're into Firefly, you'll love it.
I:10014;1343;And like me into general sci.
I:10014;1344;fi you''ll probably love it too.
I:10014;1345;"Can't believe what passes for a ""great"" movies these days."
I:10014;1346;This movie is the perfect closure to one of the best prematurely canceled tv series ever made.
I:10014;1347;But I recommend watching the series first, as the movie will be much more fulfilling that way.
I:10014;1348;This film makes it all worthwhile.
I:10014;1349;I'm not a movie lover, but Serenity is special.
I:10014;1350;"holic and really do love his ability to create completely realistic characters and I must say, Firefly didn't dissapoint
I:10014;1351;Serenity was a spectacular movie that complimented the series wonderfully.
I:10014;1352;Those of you who liked The Fifth Element will definately enjoy this film.
I:10014;1353;Now, one guy mentioned that if you watched the series, you'll have a bit more of an understanding to the film and he's right.
I:10014;1354;Joss Whedon did an incredible job for pleasing fans of the show along with newbies.
I:10014;1355;This is one of those really rare movies that when I finished watching it, I played it once more.
I:10014;1356;"I was surprised that ""western speak"" worked so well, but kudos to Whedon and his actors for pulling it off."
I:10014;1357;I loved this movie and wish Whedon would bring the crew back soon in another film.
I:10014;1358;Serenity is a continuation of the show Firefly, and serves as an its ending.
I:10014;1359;Better even than Revenge of the Sith, I have to say.
I:10014;1360;"It was truly amazing
I:10014;1361;I wasn't sure if the series could handle a movie, and I usually don't trust movies to be as good as the thing they're based on, but this one was absolutely incredible.
I:10014;1362;Joss Whedon did an excellent job translating his series into a movie.
I:10014;1363;It was so good, I simultaneously want them to make a sequel and dont want them to make a sequel.
I:10014;1364;As a movie taken on it's own merits, it is a supremely well cast, written and acted ride.
I:10014;1365;It is obviously a labor of Love that reaches out to the viewer and if you have the sci.
I:10014;1366;fi bug, pulls you in and engages you on a whole range of levels.
I:10014;1367;there's something happening here, and now you're part of it.
I:10014;1368;Love Nathan Fillion and it's definitely a cult following movie.
I:10014;1369;Good finally to the series.
I:10014;1370;time favorite movies, even with the twist with a beloved character.
I:10014;1371;a unique voice with just the right touch of humor.
I:10014;1372;And if you love action, this is the one for you.
I:10014;1373;This item came in perfect condition.
I:10014;1374;This movie is awesome in its own right, but if you look at it from an anthropological perspective it's even better.
I:10014;1375;It says a lot about human nature, where all the monsters are human, even the ones that don't look it, and no one is completely 'good' or 'pure.'
I:10014;1376;i this movie twice in the theatre and it was even better the second time I saw it.
I:10014;1377;It's fun if you don't want to think deeply about it, and it's deep if you do.
I:10014;1378;The movie is great: is has witty dialogue, great characters, and a quick plot wonderfully interwoven with Western and scifi themes.
I:10014;1379;"just because ""Joss did it so it's gotta be good, right?"""
I:10014;1380;Well, the show was amazing, and the movie is incredible.
I:10014;1381;It's got all the elements, romance, danger, horror, drama, comedy.
I:10014;1382;great dialogue, characters you fall in love with, and twisty plot lines.
I:10014;1383;This was a great movie, wish there was more.
I:10014;1384;Would recommend it to anyone who loves science fiction and/or westerns.
I:10014;1385;But now I've seen Serenity and it is much like the early Star Wars.
I:10014;1386;A little short on special effects but long on characters, excitement, realistic dialog and even laughs.
I:10014;1387;A bit like real life, actually.
I:10014;1388;i wonder what George Lucas makes of Serenity since it is so, so much better than anything he has done in the last 20 years.
I:10014;1389;Now, lets get onto the movie review.
I:10014;1390;lived, but fantastic tv show, Firefly.
I:10014;1391;He was looking to create a post American civil war type of story, moving the setting into futuristic space.
I:10014;1392;as a stand alone Science Fiction action movie, with good dialog, story, and action.
I:10014;1393;It is unfair to compare them head to head, but in a lot of ways this is just as good, and often better.
I:10014;1394;just good fun with good friends.
I:10014;1395;Got the series after seeing the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it also.
I:10014;1396;"I watched the complete season of ""Firefly"" and was very impressed, so much so that I'll even try watching ""Buffy""."
I:10014;1397;"Then some main characters die, so how does that allow for a ""Firefly series 2""."
I:10014;1398;The box is gorgeous btw.
I:10014;1399;the reviews were consistently fantastic.
I:10014;1400;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as well as the series.
I:10014;1401;"A few years ago I stumbled onto a TV show called ""Firefly""."
I:10014;1402;what a great story they weave!
I:10014;1403;Very cleverly written with humor and just the right touch of Sci.
I:10014;1404;fi and even a hint of romance.
I:10014;1405;Really, I'm only here to lend support for such a great story and cast.
I:10014;1406;i'm so glad I found it again.
I:10014;1407;anyway, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
I:10014;1408;And, I hope even more that we haven't heard the end of this great story.
I:10014;1409;An absolute must for any Firefly fan!
I:10014;1410;This is a movie I enjoyed a lot more than I expected I would.
I:10014;1411;The characters even refer to their spaceship as a boat.
I:10014;1412;the broad range of characters from the half.
I:10014;1413;Nathan Fillion as the boat's captain does the hero's job quite well while Summer Glau fill's the River role with all the insanity and power the role demands.
I:10014;1414;the payoff of the movie is pretty good, if not particularly subtle.
I:10014;1415;It is what it is, and that is pretty fun.
I:10014;1416;plus this movie stands alone as a bit of entertainment.
I:10014;1417;I loved the TV series, and this film was a fitting cinematic production for it.
I:10014;1418;it retained the intimacy, humor and, of course, the action of the show.
I:10014;1419;Beautifully done and a joy to watch, whether you've seen the series or not.
I:10014;1420;one of the shortest lived TV shows but best.
I:10014;1421;loved and more fanfare than any other show at this time.
I:10014;1422;watchable than almost any show that I know of.
I:10014;1423;Watch Firefly series first and enjoy it further.
I:10014;1424;The collector's edition has some wonderful extra on it that make it a great asset to anybody addicted to firefly.
I:10014;1425;i personally view this as a very well done fan fiction, so it doesn't taint the amazingness that is Firefly.
I:10014;1426;anyway, I received this movie really fast and for a fair price.
I:10014;1427;The subtitles are unusually good, and most of the (generous) extra stuff is subtitled as well, which is highly unusual.
I:10014;1428;That should tell you all you need to know about the movie.
I:10014;1429;This movie, this world is one you will want to enter again and again, and it will hurt when you realize you've seen it all.
I:10014;1430;That's how good this movie is.
I:10014;1431;That's how good the show is.
I:10014;1432;The characters are gritty and real.
I:10014;1433;Unlike many movies these days, the script is real to!
I:10014;1434;Serenity is that rare combination of an action packed movie with a brain.
I:10014;1435;It has Joss Whedon's trademark humor and whip snap jumps from laughter to tears to gasps and edge of the seat exhileration.
I:10014;1436;It does what science fiction does at its best, takes modern issues and ideas and put them in a new context.
I:10014;1437;Truth, belief, freedom, all with a delicious candy coating of space battles and gun fights.
I:10014;1438;This movie is a fantastic glimpse of what the original series could have become had it been given the proper time and PR.
I:10014;1439;And it is true that to enjoy this movie there is no need for knowledge of the series.
I:10014;1440;Firefly was, in short, an amazing cancelled TV series.
I:10014;1441;You had this cast of characters that was downright superb.
I:10014;1442;Wash, Zoe's husband, is the pilot, goofy, wise.
I:10014;1443;cracking, and adoring his wife.
I:10014;1444;a big deal for a full.
I:10014;1445;fledged series, much, much bigger for a series canceled before finishing its first season.
I:10014;1446;"THEN I rewatched ""Serenity"", and found that it makes much more sense."
I:10014;1447;to see the entire cast back is a joy.
I:10014;1448;And to finally learn what happened to River, what she knew, was great.
I:10014;1449;But I have quite a few reservations about the movie as a whole.
I:10014;1450;"Where is his wry humor, glinted at in the beginning with the words ""This is the captain."
I:10014;1451;"He readily brings along River on a job, when in ""Firefly"" he would never have done that, not after the strange things she did."
I:10014;1452;And his fights with Simon, how he treated Simon and River.
I:10014;1453;Lots of Star Wars.y space battles, fist fights, shoot.
I:10014;1454;"I almost felt that they were included, to ""show off"" the film, to draw as many into the seats, wow them, and get them to come back for more."
I:10014;1455;"The gasping breath of ""Firefly"", the movie ""Serenity""."
I:10014;1456;"It's okay to watch, particularly if you have seen ""Firefly""."
I:10014;1457;This is an awesome movie.
I:10014;1458;ray and watched it from start to finish in a day or two.
I:10014;1459;Great story and great actors!
I:10014;1460;It was funny in parts, obviously made for less than Revenge of the Sith, had great characters, and left you wanting more.
I:10014;1461;Just a perfect Science Fiction film from start to finish.
I:10014;1462;As far as the Blu Ray disc, it's amazing that this was an early blu ray adopter and will hang with the newest blu rays out as far as the audio is concerned, just awesome!Perfect film and perfect blu ray!
I:10014;1463;This was a good continuation for the Firefly saga.
I:10014;1464;Perhaps this is due to the fact that Fox prematurely cancelled the Firefly series, inspiring Joss Whedon and his team to write an epic tale that captures the characters we grew to love in the series.
I:10014;1465;Major drivers of the stories are shown, additionally illuminating why River was so important to the Alliance, and the danger her knowledge poses to their power, as well as some of the mysteries of the universe .
I:10014;1466;Great unsung series and wonderful sci.
I:10014;1467;Thought provoking, great action, intelligent script with real people (not super/people).
I:10014;1468;Love the plotline and effects.
I:10014;1469;A great rogue family on a wonderful no.
I:10014;1470;feels good to visit and revisit them.
I:10014;1471;The writers did the best possible job with the movie after its predecessor got cancelled.
I:10014;1472;It was fun, filled with action and adventure .
I:10014;1473;The best part was the character development during the course of the series.
I:10014;1474;Whedon really did a great job of presenting believable characters.
I:10014;1475;The only thing that could be considered unique here is the stunning visual effects, costuming, and set design.
I:10014;1476;The movie is very pretty to look at.
I:10014;1477;I especially enjoyed how the movie opened up the Firefly universe a bit more and filled in some more details.
I:10014;1478;While i'm sure this was a great move on the part of the developers, it took away some of what I liked most about the series.
I:10014;1479;Serenity takes you into a western.
I:10014;1480;fi world that is so imaginative and not revolving around aliens at all!
I:10014;1481;For those of you who haven't seen the show, you will still enjoy it for some great action, intersting story, great characters and some really funny lines.
I:10014;1482;If you have the chance to see the show, or even a few episodes before you see the movie, the better.
I:10014;1483;The way to story unfolds is very nice and very well paced.
I:10014;1484;Many scenes will have you at the edge of your seat due to great writing and storytelling by Joss Whedon.
I:10014;1485;stop laugh riot, but the humor is used at the exat right times.
I:10014;1486;After the series of Star Wars prequels that just barely satisfied us Star Wars fans, Serenity comes around and gives you actual characters that you care for.
I:10014;1487;The film will no doubt be a cult classic, but hopefully if enough normal people who haven't seen the series go, we just might have a franchise.
I:10014;1488;YOu should hopefully be able to pick out something that you will like.
I:10014;1489;The crew of Serenity return in a performance that quickly draws you into a story of a crew that is more family than a collection of strangers.
I:10014;1490;Space isn't always clean, happy with perfect machines that never fail.
I:10014;1491;I believe space will follow this vision more than any Trek or Saga you will find.
I:10014;1492;Sit back and enjoy a wonderful adventure.
I:10014;1493;most of family seen the movie on the big screen.
I:10014;1494;Serenity is a great return of a story and a powerful cast with a very special magic.
I:10014;1495;I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an adventure that doesn't always go as planned.
I:10014;1496;I hope you enjoy this as much as we do.
I:10014;1497;i want to thank you all for allowing Serenity to return for a special big screen adventure.
I:10014;1498;I will hope many returns of the Serenity crew.
I:10014;1499;Produt and service both rate 5 stars
I:10014;1500;Good price and exceptional delivery process.
I:10014;1501;It was a good price and the delivery exceeded the estimate.
I:10014;1502;A must see for all sci fi fans !
I:10014;1503;Somebody finally got it right!Extraordinarily entertaining!
I:10014;1504;Easily one of my favorite movies of all time!MOST DEFINITELY WORTH $17.99 .
I:10014;1505;fi movies that I absolutely loved the first time I saw it.
I:10014;1506;Serenity, however, grabbed my attention right off the bat, for one simple reason: its smooth blend of action and comedy into one tight, well.
I:10014;1507;"river Tam (Summer Glau) is a troubled teenage girl
I:10014;1508;But what makes a good sci.
I:10014;1509;Director Joss Whedon manages to keep the film tight and taught, while the superb cast keeps it all human.
I:10014;1510;The outcome is this: a science fiction flick that is dark, funny, and delectible.
I:10014;1511;"Whether you were a fan of the series, or are like me and knew nothing about it, you will enjoy this movie
I:10014;1512;An excellent conclusion to a tv series that was cancelled too soon.
I:10014;1513;west themes and very good character development.
I:10014;1514;I consider Serenity to be one of my favorite movies if not my top favorite.
I:10014;1515;a terrific conclusion to the series.
I:10014;1516;Definitely wraps the whole story up, without contradicting the plot lines from the show.
I:10014;1517;Naturally, I now plan on watching the Firefly episodes in the near future, but there is a very real chance I will say something in this review that will be deemed rather stupid by loyal fans .
I:10014;1518;I must say I always enjoy watching a woman stomp mudholes in wave after wave of bad guys .
I:10014;1519;given the hated Alliance's determined effort to find and eliminate her, he knows it must be a real threat to their position and power.
I:10014;1520;serenity is a remarkable movie .
I:10014;1521;The very story itself represents a unique take on science fiction (although I can't say I saw a lot of Firefly's vaunted Western tie.
I:10014;1522;in in the movie), one built on fascinating characters as much as futuristic technology and marvelous (and they are marvelous, by the way) shoot.
I:10014;1523;"ingenious Joss Whedon likes to diverge from common wisdom and prove all the ""it will never work"" critics wrong, and part of that involves some pretty unexpected fates for his characters here in this big."
I:10014;1524;pleaser of a feature film.
I:10014;1525;Serenity is a great movie and the ultimate vindication for Joss Whedon and his hand.
I:10014;1526;The show deserved better, and Serenity proves Mr. Universe right .
I:10014;1527;I had high expectations for the movie and it met them.
I:10014;1528;Fantastic movie that I believe worked on every level.
I:10014;1529;Just a great movie for fans of the show Firefly.
I:10014;1530;You do not have to have seen the show to enjoy the movie, but having that as background will increase comprehension and entertainment levels.
I:10014;1531;The writing is crisp and sharp.
I:10014;1532;The cast is very much at home with their characters.
I:10014;1533;The plot sizzles along nicely, never dragging at all.
I:10014;1534;A whole lot of fun here to enjoy.
I:10014;1535;But due to the overwhelming demand of the fans and the cast and crew's love of the show, Firefly was reincarnated on the big screen.
I:10014;1536;Sure, it's a step up from the TV show, but the acting stays superb throughout.
I:10014;1537;I want more of it!
I:10014;1538;The characters are lovable, the dialog is brilliant, and the rest just works.
I:10014;1539;Joss Whedon's vision is unique, and beautiful.
I:10014;1540;Serenity and Firefly are part western, part sci.
I:10014;1541;see if you enjoy either genre.
I:10014;1542;ONe of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:10014;1543;Keeps you on the edge of your seat even if you'd seen it before.
I:10014;1544;fi, my mind was wide open.
I:10014;1545;A modern day cowboys and Indians flick geared towards the mentality a 15.
I:10014;1546;old boy with way too much time on his hands!In the world of Serenity the stakes are high because the guys in the black hats are gonna eat ya alive, quite literally, if they catch ya!
I:10014;1547;Received in good order, at an acceptable cost and in good time after my order .
I:10014;1548;I recommend for anyone who likes science fiction and likes to see the underdogs fight the good fight.
I:10014;1549;The mix of mandarin and updated english words is very interesting to those with geeky tendancies.
I:10014;1550;Serenity's extra features (a lot of them) require that connection.
I:10014;1551;The anomalies I have found with a Blu.
I:10014;1552;Universal did a great job on this film.
I:10014;1553;Serenity is probably my favorite sci.
I:10014;1554;fi film since Aliens, and a much closer franchise in feel to the original Star Wars then anything since The Empire Strikes Back.
I:10014;1555;Those who love Firefly/Serenity wax poetic about it to a nauseating degree, and I fall into this myself often times, so I will just say that if you have never seen the film or the series, both are worth your time.
I:10014;1556;It is definitely a superior disc, but how much you notice will definitely depend on your set up.
I:10014;1557;While it's not anywhere close to being one of the top looking discs out there, it is the best.
I:10014;1558;version of this amazing movie you are going to find.
I:10014;1559;It's funny, touching, weird and silly.
I:10014;1560;Just let your head go and watch the fun.
I:10014;1561;I own Angel, Buffy, and the FireFly series.
I:10014;1562;A space cowboy adventure with laughs, chills, and thrills galore.
I:10014;1563;obviously a terrific film, even if you're not a big fan of the TV series that spawned it.
I:10014;1564;With each job he is faced with the prospect of doing what he needs to do to survive .
I:10014;1565;and doing what he feels is the right thing to do despite himself.
I:10014;1566;the supporting cast provides a wonderful set of personalities who are amazing together.
I:10014;1567;The writing and actors are so well blended you can just sit back and believe they have been working together as a team on this freighter for a long time.
I:10014;1568;I thought it was a really good send up of a really great series, would recommend it to and fan of Fire Fly,
I:10014;1569;I just saw this movie last night and I got to say WOW what a thrill ride man was this movie ever good I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.
I:10014;1570;super congrats to Joss and everyone involved.
I:10014;1571;lived but well written and acted series that I enjoyed as much as Farscape.
I:10014;1572;The characters are believable, displaying their flaws as well as their strengths.
I:10014;1573;line is a nice twist of genres that gives a new take on the space theme.
I:10014;1574;Serenity is a nice conclusion to the story.
I:10014;1575;I cheered with the crowd.
I:10014;1576;I was on the edge of my seat.
I:10014;1577;This time courtesy of Serenity's brilliant cast of characters, plot twists that sprayed loose change from my pockets, pulse.
I:10014;1578;evoking wit, and just enough heart, soul, and camaraderie to inspire even the faithless.
I:10014;1579;In a slightly more comprehensive nutshell, the movie Serenity is the sweeping finale to Josh Whedon's amazing space/western epic: Firefly.
I:10014;1580;packed into this stunning finale.
I:10014;1581;That said, Firefly/Serenity is, bar none, my favorite science fiction series of all time.
I:10014;1582;Amid this chaos add a ship full of brigands who harbour two fugatives on the run from the alliance, one of whom may be the most powerful weapon known to man.
I:10014;1583;it should be run of the mill space fantasy but Whedon's strengths as a writer and first time big screen director hone this movie into a rewarding experience for the viewer.
I:10014;1584;The dialogue effortlessly flits from wiscracking humour to social commentary.
I:10014;1585;This series had incredible promise.
I:10014;1586;Joss Whedon is my master now!!
I:10014;1587;Definitely worth owning if you're a devout Firefly fan.
I:10014;1588;This was Just a great movie with some of the quirkiest characters exhibitling loyalty to a captain and a space ship.
I:10014;1589;but OMG, the sharpness, the clarity, leaves one speechless.
I:10014;1590;I cant rate this high enough.
I:10014;1591;"But if you get the movie you should also get the show ""Firefly"" because it mores the movie much more fun and easy to understand"
I:10014;1592;I think it was a good, solid movie.
I:10014;1593;Whedon and crew did a good job of wrapping up a major and involved storyline in a short space of time.
I:10014;1594;The story wraps up a pretty major arc (one of several) that was building in the first season of the show.
I:10014;1595;In it I can see what would have been a tremendous story, in which characters I love are drawn through a torturous gauntlet that tests and shapes all of them, makes them all indispensible.
I:10014;1596;This space western does such a good job of character building it's no wonder it was so popular.
I:10014;1597;The bad characters drive the action perfectly and with malicious intent and the good characters deal with the adversity brilliantly.
I:10014;1598;Conceptually, most SF builds on what came before it.
I:10014;1599;Perhaps it has to do with the fact that when all the pieces come together just right, originally takes a back seat to synergy and perfect execution.
I:10014;1600;fascinating, complex, fully developed and above all, entertaining.
I:10014;1601;Good characters are the basis of good drama.
I:10014;1602;"So much ""crud"" on television today, and this gem, this jewel, this extremely intelligent Space Opera has been passed over!"
I:10014;1603;Yes, there are special features to be seen after the last episode, and I am grateful.
I:10014;1604;What's missing from Serenity is genuine vision and seriousness.
I:10014;1605;genre scifi/western/horror/comedy from Joss Whedon that is brilliant in every aspect of the film.
I:10014;1606;"The action is fast and intense (Summer Glau does some incredible work), the jokes are funny but advance the characters and the film, the moral ambiguity is realistic but just adds to the sense of people doing the best they can to take the ""high ground"" in a difficult situation, the grittily realistic special effects mix in so well with the story you almost don't notice they are special effects."
I:10014;1607;There's something in here for everyone.
I:10014;1608;"Serenity is a movie for fans of the late, great TV series, ""Firefly."""
I:10014;1609;It has everything a sci.
I:10014;1610;a good story, great characters (including three gorgeous women), lots of action, cool looking spaceships, and delightful humor.
I:10014;1611;treat youself to a fun movie, you won't be sorry!
I:10014;1612;"Serenity, the movie version of the television show ""Firefly,"" which was canceled after just one briefly wonderful season, is scifi at its best."
I:10014;1613;Both the series and the movie are unsung heroes in that they are something new to the genre, with an experienced cast that demonstrated chemistry from day one of the series' launch in 2003.
I:10014;1614;the movie is quite intelligent, with excellent depth for many of the characters, while still supplying the kind of action and excitement that keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of the movie.
I:10014;1615;The villain in the story is fascinating as well, one who is both complementary to Mal and a counterpoint.
I:10014;1616;the last minutes of the film have a powerful message both in terms of the story as well as for the world around us.
I:10014;1617;this is one of the best scifi movies to hit the big screen in at least the last 10 years.
I:10014;1618;Still, this is a fun, fast.
I:10014;1619;paced movie, and if you're a Firefly fan, you definitely ought to see it.
I:10014;1620;Serenity can stand on its own as a great sci.
I:10014;1621;fi film, but in the context of the series is even better.
I:10014;1622;It's basically the best and final episode of a short but great series.
I:10014;1623;it has summer glau in it.
I:10014;1624;Movie played good and came unscratched.
I:10014;1625;Although I liked the tv version firefly' better than this story, it was still good.
I:10014;1626;A great movie based on the short lived sci.
I:10014;1627;Well worth your time viewing!!
I:10014;1628;A just worthy film for the whole family
I:10014;1629;Serenity helps to bring the storyline into something like closure, although they probably could've made a half.
I:10014;1630;Serenity is a great movie!
I:10014;1631;Each of the TV episodes builds a base of understanding that is important to really enjoy the movie.
I:10014;1632;It's a combination of science fiction (better than Star Trek) and the old west.
I:10014;1633;That's a strange combination, but it works for me.
I:10014;1634;Nathan is amazing as always!
I:10014;1635;This was just a very fun movie to watch.
I:10014;1636;lived TV series, you will still enjoy this film.
I:10014;1637;Each is very entertaining and regretably couldn't be given time on screen that they deserved.
I:10014;1638;This was the perfect movie to follow the short lived Firefly series.
I:10014;1639;fi nerd and loved the movie.
I:10014;1640;A good story that should have been developed better.
I:10014;1641;First five minutes are among the best.
I:10014;1642;Great companion to the first season.
I:10014;1643;Be prepared to laugh and to cry.
I:10014;1644;Just finished watching the Firefly shows and loved having some closure with the Serenity movie.
I:10014;1645;Good flick must watch if you loved Firefly.
I:10014;1646;This movie is well written, well acted, well portrayed!!!!!!!!
I:10014;1647;It's funny, it's sad, it's a wonderful experience!
I:10014;1648;I hope and pray that the show will return after this!
I:10014;1649;Serenity is an Action Packed Film that satisfies that hunger for Sci.
I:10014;1650;It has enjoyable elements for every crowd in it.
I:10014;1651;If you have seen this movie and enjoyed it, be sure to see the fourteen episodes of Firefly, the tv show this was based on.
I:10014;1652;If you have seen Firefly and liked it, then you will like this movie as well.
I:10014;1653;By far this is one of the best action movies of this genre that I have seen!
I:10014;1654;It reminds me of a cross between Indiana Jones and Star wars!
I:10014;1655;The acting, the special effects and stories was excellent.
I:10014;1656;Joss Whedon has a wonderful imagination.
I:10014;1657;This film will entertain fans of the Firefly series and those who have never seen the original.
I:10014;1658;great plot and story telling, acting, photograpy, special fx, sound and music.
I:10014;1659;I loved the series, and loved the movie.
I:10014;1660;This is about the most interesting science fiction concept that I have found on TV or movies.
I:10014;1661;I recommend it to anyone who loves speculative fiction.
I:10014;1662;I really enjoy the Serenity and Firefly movie and shows.
I:10014;1663;I am pleased to be able to play Serenity in my blue.
I:10014;1664;if you never watched Firefly, this is a great stand alone move also!
I:10014;1665;Think wild wild west in space.
I:10014;1666;the special features are so much fun!
I:10014;1667;Joss Whedon is a brilliant story teller and this movie proves it.
I:10014;1668;The characters, the action, the dialogue, they're all great.
I:10014;1669;Loved the movie and the series.
I:10014;1670;This show has just the right mix of geek, sex, sci.
I:10014;1671;fi, comedy, kooky, action, gore and intrigue.
I:10014;1672;the cast interaction is perfect.
I:10014;1673;i highly recommend that anyone who likes to escape, watch the series (Firefly) and then the movie
I:10014;1674;If you've seen the show that this movie is based on, then it's worth getting.
I:10014;1675;This was another great deal!
I:10014;1676;The packaging was good and I had no delivery issues at all.
I:10014;1677;The price was also really good.
I:10014;1678;"an excellent movie, loved by all fans of firefly
I:10014;1679;"Serenity, by itself, is a very good movie, but the real value comes from immersing yourself in the ""Firefly"" universe."
I:10014;1680;This was a great intro to the franchise.
I:10014;1681;"Time and time again you see successful tv series episodes that deal with simple plots that develop characters (this was especially successful with the best Next Generations episodes)and then you see the show move to the big screen and, inevitablly, the plot has to involve ""big"" issues: saving the universe, saving humanity from an evil policital force, uncovering and then telling the Truth to the masses, blah blah blah."
I:10014;1682;It's just a fact that people who work on the small screen have a very hard time moving their concepts to the big screen and this movie is a prime example of that problem.
I:10014;1683;Also, this movie had humor.
I:10014;1684;Though certainly not a revolution for the genre, Serenity was still an excellent movie that kept me entertained and enthralled throughout.
I:10014;1685;It's probably the best series ever cancelled.
I:10014;1686;The movie picks up a bit after the series ends, but it also goes back to before the series started to help wrap up a lot of what the series never had a chance to.
I:10014;1687;The storyline is epic, as is proper for a major motion picture, and the fight scenes are awesome.
I:10014;1688;They also preserved the humor and playfulness of the series.
I:10014;1689;It was a great way to give the fans closure.
I:10014;1690;This is much too narrow of a category for this wonderful film!
I:10014;1691;It's also an incredible drama, a comedy, an action.
I:10014;1692;adventure (ala Indiana Jones), a Western, a samurai movie, and a humanitarian one as well.
I:10014;1693;and I keep seeing new things and nuances.
I:10014;1694;It is an intelligent, fresh approach to space science fiction, a genre that was full of stereotypes, faulty physics and improbable aliens.
I:10014;1695;Whedon's vision of the future feels true and relevant.
I:10014;1696;so bravo, Joss Whedon, for some really great work!
I:10014;1697;It's the first time I've been in a movie theatre and everyone stood up and clapped at the end of the movie!
I:10014;1698;Following the series of Firefly, Serenity continues the story line for a few more steps.
I:10014;1699;mostly through common word usage that is more and more endearing with subsequent viewing.
I:10014;1700;The characters are complex, focused, solid and believable from the way they are unchanging in their demeanor in all situations.
I:10014;1701;The climax builds to the end revealing some things while setting the stage for the story to continue.
I:10014;1702;Best Damn Movie ever made from a TV show!We Browncoats WON!
I:10014;1703;Personally, I love watching extended scenes, deleted scenes, and outtakes.
I:10014;1704;detailed Serenity information, including comparisons between the TV show and the movie versions of the ship .
I:10014;1705;very cool how real Josh Whedon and team made both come to life.
I:10014;1706;This movie is great on it's own, but if you watched the TV series Firefly, you can get some closure.
I:10014;1707;Fast moving with lots of action.
I:10014;1708;Good acting, camera work, props, color and graphics.
I:10014;1709;Well worth viewing if you are a SciFi fan.
I:10014;1710;I just bought it for my son for Christmas, too.
I:10014;1711;The movie was so good also!
I:10014;1712;A great show with characters I loved to get to know!
I:10014;1713;The movie stands well on its own (although you have to listen very carefully to the dialog to get what's going on if you did not watch the series) but it's even more fun if you watch Firefly first.
I:10014;1714;It could have actually been a great movie, but for some reason the director/writers just blew it.
I:10014;1715;A great movie from a really thoughtful TV series.
I:10014;1716;Fillion is excellent in a Harrison Ford role of every.
I:10014;1717;man pulled to do his best.
I:10014;1718;Building off of the Firefly series, Serenity is a continuation of the story of Captain Mal and crew.
I:10014;1719;It's one of my favorite sci.
I:10014;1720;fi with western elements and very action.y.
I:10014;1721;Very simply, Serenity is an outstanding Sci Fi film with a great storyline and laced throughout with wry and gritty humour.
I:10014;1722;Characterisation is very good, indeed, and melds superbly with the aforementioned storyline and humour.
I:10014;1723;Basically the characterisation depicts real people and this makes the difference.
I:10014;1724;Captain Mal Reynolds (played well by a wry Nathan Fillion).
I:10014;1725;Superbly played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, he is a glacially calm, reflective, and totally ruthless individual, determined to catch River and Simon by any means possible.
I:10014;1726;serenity is a brilliant film from start to finish and will keep the viewer wholly engrossed.
I:10014;1727;I was surprised and delighted with how good it actually was, and went back for a repeat viewing at the cinema.
I:10014;1728;This was a good movie, especially for Firefly fans, we only got 13 episodes so this was a well received addition.
I:10014;1729;The plot fit right in with the show but could be held on its own.
I:10014;1730;Wanted to watch all at once.
I:10014;1731;I think I may have liked it as much as Star Wars.
I:10014;1732;I kinda watched this twice, and it was kinda totally worth it.
I:10014;1733;The film looks good, the actors are all in fine form, the fight choreography is spectacular, and that good old Joss Whedon sense of humor is right there, weird and wonderful as it ever was.
I:10014;1734;I wish all pop culture could be this intelligent and this much fun.Yay, Joss.
I:10014;1735;Keep up the good work.
I:10014;1736;It was a great tribute to the show.
I:10014;1737;Of course, Serenity combines all my favorite movie genres: sci.
I:10014;1738;A terrific romp with a very satisfying ending!
I:10014;1739;I love the way this movie turns traditional sci.
I:10014;1740;down by breaking cliches left and right, while still being exciting and, most of all, making you care about the characters.
I:10014;1741;Probably the best part is the humor.
I:10014;1742;I can't remember the last time I saw real, genuine humor in a sci.
I:10014;1743;Serenity's humor is based in the characters, so it rings true.
I:10014;1744;A movie to make you excited about movies again.
I:10014;1745;There is also a visual tip of the hat to a famous Star Wars fight scene between Luke and Darth Vadar, but still a fun ride and a treat to any fan of the series.
I:10014;1746;Anyhow, Serenity if the tie off and does a great job bring the series to a conclusion.
I:10014;1747;Perhaps (as others have suggested) they will bring back Firefly as a computer game using the original actors for voice work.
I:10014;1748;Witty dialogue and an intricate plot make it the kind of movie that not only sci.
I:10014;1749;Pop some popcorn and enjoy!
I:10014;1750;This is one of the best Sci.
I:10014;1751;I highly recommend you check it out.
I:10014;1752;Joss Whedon had a huge loyal fan base for Buffy: he abandoned his fans at the end, giving us about a year and a half of ruination of what had been a really good story.
I:10014;1753;Oh, please, Mr. Cowboy, save us from the nanny state.
I:10014;1754;This movie has great originality and creativity.
I:10014;1755;From a series that was good and should have made it.
I:10014;1756;This belongs in every sci fi product lovers collection, and is well worth your money.
I:10014;1757;We have enjoyed Joss Wheedon's work as a television director and writer for some years now (Buffy, Angel and Firefly on TV).
I:10014;1758;He likes to poke fun at many things in an intelligent way and this movie is no exception.
I:10014;1759;I found it to be a very good movie at the time.
I:10014;1760;I recently got round to watching the series Firefly and with a better understanding of the background and characters it made the movie even better on my second viewing.
I:10014;1761;Surround effects such as explosions, flight scenes were quite good however.
I:10014;1762;This is the best way to watch, and Serenity was the perfect closure to a show that ended way too soon.
I:10014;1763;I'll admit it right up front: I'm a Firefly/Serenity geek.
I:10014;1764;"I've never developed such a deep connection with any other entertainment franchise with the possible exceptions of ""The Lord Of the Rings"" ."
I:10014;1765;the books, mainly, though the movies were great too .
I:10014;1766;so what is it about this fictional world that draws me in so?
I:10014;1767;i think the real reason is that this is science fiction done right.
I:10014;1768;headed alien monsters or supernatural forces.
I:10014;1769;technically, this film is beautiful, with just enough SFX to tell the story without having the effects become the story.
I:10014;1770;spinning thrill ride, but it's not what the movie is about.
I:10014;1771;"One side effect is that ""Serenity"" holds up well to multiple viewings, as you catch the nuances that might have flown past too quickly on the first pass."
I:10014;1772;On the upside, the fast pacing means this film is action packed.
I:10014;1773;There are more twists and turns in its first nine minutes than most movies give you in their entire running length.
I:10014;1774;"even so, ""Serenity"" takes enough time to show you the lighter side of these characters."
I:10014;1775;There are a lot of laughs here, including a few really big ones.
I:10014;1776;That's a sign of gifted writing.
I:10014;1777;though it's never rubbed in your face, the movie also carries a timely political message, demonstrating how evil may result from the best of intentions.
I:10014;1778;This is a real sleeper!
I:10014;1779;I can identify with the entire emsemble cast.
I:10014;1780;what *is* unique is that such interest has been generated and maintained after only a single season, and continues to grow today.
I:10014;1781;wide and every one of us continues to hope that new episodes will be made.
I:10014;1782;serenity, the name of a spaceship, is about a rag.
I:10014;1783;fi action at a very high level, with wonderful writing and directing from the masterful Joss Whedon.
I:10014;1784;(He is responsible for three of the best television series of the last ten years.)
I:10014;1785;Whether you've seen the series, or not, this is an excellent movie you're sure to enjoy.
I:10014;1786;i came away from this thinking it was one of the most entertaining movies I had seen all year, and my wife, who is not a sci.
I:10014;1787;the world it takes place is the future earth.
I:10014;1788;The writers have evolved language and culture along believable lines so it looks like a familiar yet foreign world to us.
I:10014;1789;I really appreciate that sort of attention to detail (something you'll never find in Star Trek).
I:10014;1790;the movie is not going to win any awards, but it is extremely entertaining with believable characters and an engaging story.
I:10014;1791;A successful TV series gets its niche viewers established and then a movie deal is struck.
I:10014;1792;serenity stands by itself as a great movie.
I:10014;1793;Humor and action is still utilized along with modern day innuendos which give this movie some repeat viewing.
I:10014;1794;Exciting, mysterious, and containing action sequences that rival the video game movies that plague the screen today, without losing the familial chemistry of the cast nor the humor that was such a large part of the Firefly television series.
I:10014;1795;Still a favorite after ten years.
I:10014;1796;ray is becoming so affordable, and Serenity was one of my first notices for br movies.
I:10014;1797;The lovely story that completed the wrongly.
I:10014;1798;hanging Firefly series is a masterpiece in Sci Fi.
I:10014;1799;The original premise was such a kick, and the movie continues, but also gets pretty serious sci.
I:10014;1800;The movie differs a bit from the series, however, it still has the same action and great plot!
I:10014;1801;Serenity, including the companion (no pun intended) Firefly series, is pure art.
I:10014;1802;From the incredible story set 500 years in the future, to the 9 strong characters and their mingled development, to the visuals and absolutely beautiful music, you will not be disappointed.
I:10014;1803;You'll also enjoy the 10th character, Serenity herself .
I:10014;1804;the lovable space ship that will make you feel quite at home 500 years in the future.
I:10014;1805;Fresh new sci fi story.
I:10014;1806;Good believable story, with interesting characters, good effects and some characters to care about.
I:10014;1807;I enjoy movies better with the extras.
I:10014;1808;i have always enjoyed the series and the talented cast of charactors.
I:10014;1809;this story line is wonderful.
I:10014;1810;the best acting was from the always talented, adam baldwin.
I:10014;1811;the blu ray picture is the best i've viewed on my old tv.
I:10014;1812;He is happy with it and that's all that matters.

I:10014;1814;I Love this movie there are so many things happening in it that replay value is high.
I:10014;1815;The story is well thought out the acting is top notch.
I:10014;1816;With every thing this movie has to offer what sold me is the dialog and dynamics between the actors.
I:10014;1817;If you were a fan of the short lived television show Firefly chances are you will enjoy the movie Serenity.
I:10014;1818;the movie features the original cast from the television series in an intergalactic mission.
I:10014;1819;Popular character actor Ron Glass (Barney Miller), has a small role in the film as a shepard that the crew seeks guidance from.
I:10014;1820;Actor Chiwetel Ejiofor steals the show with his amazing role as an assasin out to kill River Tam.
I:10014;1821;He is so believable in his role that when his character experiences a change of heart it's unbelievable.
I:10014;1822;the bottom line is that if you watched the television series Firefly you will enjoy this film 10 times more than a casual film viewer.
I:10014;1823;It's an enjoyable film, even though the ending is a little far fetched and anti.
I:10014;1824;It's a very engaging film.
I:10014;1825;The characters are real, not cardboard, the action is fast the special effects are seamless and the story continues the amazing work of Josh Wheaton in the FireFly series (He also created Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel).
I:10014;1826;while the movie stands on it's own, I reccommend viewing the series first.
I:10014;1827;Serenity makes a fine cap to the series.
I:10014;1828;If you like the series Fire Fly you will love the movie!
I:10014;1829;ray deliver a far greater dynamic range, but the center channel dialogue is much clearer than I have ever heard it, including in any theater.
I:10014;1830;The directionality and clarity of the surround effects are simply awesome, putting this disc in the demonstration.
I:10014;1831;The picture is also the most vibrant I have seen it: vivid color saturation, and accurate reproduction of the visuals I remember from the theater, not to mention it being the first time I have ever experienced the computer.
I:10014;1832;"fi film that, like the original Day the Earth Stood Still, assays a rarified level of artistry and social commentary
I:10014;1833;The differences are worth it.
I:10014;1834;Simply delighted to discover an unknown, well crafted Sci.
I:10014;1835;My compliments to the special.
I:10014;1836;To great satisfaction, River's quiet, disconcerning persona is finally unleashed toward the movie's end.
I:10014;1837;genuinely sorry to see such a good cast and concept come and go as it has.
I:10014;1838;I must admit I had seen the movie already, but I forgot what a great sci.
I:10014;1839;Great movie, wish there was another one to follow.
I:10014;1840;filled dialogue and interesting characters.
I:10014;1841;Serenity also has a very good villain for you villain connoisseurs out there.
I:10014;1842;only after watching the series, I can really appreciate how well this movie ties into the series.
I:10014;1843;Serenity sets up the characters so you won't be lost going into it, but I would at least try to find and watch the two hour pilot to Firefly since that really sets up the characters and the story well so you will understand and appreciate the movie more.
I:10014;1844;On it's own Serenity is a great film but put into context with Firefly it really gets better.
I:10014;1845;It has a great story and some really great twists that you won't expect.
I:10014;1846;Overall Serenity is a great ending to one of the best tv series of all time.
I:10014;1847;Jose Whedon did a great job with Firefly and Serenity.
I:10014;1848;Love the series, and this movie.
I:10014;1849;All of the series questions are answered fully, and yet one is still left with the feeling of wanting more.
I:10014;1850;First, I loved the movie.
I:10014;1851;fi fan(Star Wars to Star Trek to Dune to you name it and I probably loved it) and I found that this movie was awesome.
I:10014;1852;Visually stunning, well acted, and a cracking story are still second to Joss Whedon's lightning dialogue.
I:10014;1853;read the other raves and you will have me agreeing with them 9 out of 10.
I:10014;1854;fi film, it is as good and better than any I have seen lately: Potter 4 (4.
I:10014;1855;Even better than Batman Begins which I really enjoyed.
I:10014;1856;Better than Fantastic Four (yeah, I hear you chuckling too.)
I:10014;1857;Special effects came second place to the true story telling.
I:10014;1858;And for pure content we give them a 5.
I:10014;1859;And you will have been intertained for well over 20 hours.
I:10014;1860;The Firefly series and Serenity Movie really showed me what good sci.
I:10014;1861;This is a show that deserves to be brought back!
I:10014;1862;Wow what to say about this movie?
I:10014;1863;I thought it was fun.
I:10014;1864;I'm also an unabashed Joss Whedon fan.

I:10014;1873;Great movie that built on and closed out a perfect TV series.
I:10014;1874;Great adaptation to the big screen of one of the finest TV series.
I:10014;1875;Well written, directed and acted.
I:10014;1876;If you're a fan of science fiction and action movies, this one should be at the top of your wish.
I:10014;1877;It is quite an original and fresh sci fi adventure movie, basically a hybrid action and science fiction film.
I:10014;1878;In this future, governments are as corrupt as they are today, only with a great deal more technology and means to suppress truth.
I:10014;1879;Above all else, SERENITY is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
I:10014;1880;It is, I believe, sure to become a cult classic in the years to come.
I:10014;1881;I got hooked on the series (Firefly) before I saw the movie.
I:10014;1882;I knew I had to have it.
I:10014;1883;I recommend this movie to all SciFi fans.
I:10014;1884;It is that perfect cherry on top of one of the most brillant worlds ever created in not only Sci.
I:10014;1885;The FX are awsmoe, the music is sweet, the characters are at their best, and lost of juicy secrets are revealed.
I:10014;1886;The bonus features are great too, they really make you feel like as a viewer who loves this world you are a part of something really extraordinary.
I:10014;1887;The movie was good if you are a fan of the show
I:10014;1888;By way of testimonial though I actually watched Serenity first and liked it enough that I then watched the whole Firefly series so that should be an indication of how good it is I hope.
I:10014;1889;firefly was an amazing series that wove, cool concepts, giant glactic govenment, rebles, smugglers, awesome characters, interesting mysteries, violence and peace all together to come up with probably one of the most original sci.
I:10014;1890;It leaves other open though, such as what the Sheppard's real back ground is.
I:10014;1891;while the movie itself and the final outcome may not have been the most original, its still wrapped around an excellent cast and concept that, if you've seen the series, you care about.
I:10014;1892;If you haven't seen the series it may peak you interest enough that you'll want to as in my case.
I:10014;1893;We're also treated to some new characters, one really cool, the other, not so much.
I:10014;1894;The combination of good story and solid acting makes this movie very enjoyable.
I:10014;1895;This one belongs in my collection.
I:10014;1896;Great for adults and kids.
I:10014;1897;"Movie arrived quickly
I:10014;1898;This movie, and the series, are all about the characters.
I:10014;1899;One of the more excellent films I have ever seen.

I:10014;1904;To you, Captain Tightpants, and to your brilliant, dangerous crew, I vow my allegiance.
I:10014;1905;The movie didn't exactly follow the series, but it was a very enjoyable tie in.
I:10014;1906;If you liked Firefly, you will enjoy this movie.
I:10014;1907;Whedon knows what he's about, he's ironic, he's smart and in Serenity he shows himself a capable director.
I:10014;1908;serenity is very breezy, tongue in cheek, full of humor, sharp as a knife dialogue and even dramatic at the appropriate places.
I:10014;1909;In it's own way, this film is more satisfying than Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.
I:10014;1910;fi movie, just don't expect anything on the caliber of Blade Runner and you'll have a pleasant experience.
I:10014;1911;This is a great movie for Firefly fans and is still pretty good for those who don't know and love the crew the way the Browncoats do!
I:10014;1912;The complex characters and interesting dialog that made the series great are expertly recreated in the movie thanks to Joss Whedon's focus on the acting over special effects.
I:10014;1913;While Mal and River are the main characters in the film the others do get a chance to shine, although I would have liked to see more of the lovely Inara.

I:10014;1915;This movie was worth seeing and hopefully will lead to another movie or maybe a return of the series, although that will be hard to accomplish all things considered.
I:10014;1916;For those who love adventure with a GREAT cast.
I:10014;1917;Firefly was a great series.
I:10014;1918;Thank goodness we weren't left dangling in mid air as we were by the X. files series.
I:10014;1919;the boxed set extras contain useful and entertaining extra content that Firefly fans would appreciate.
I:10014;1920;Anyone who loved Firefly and loved Serenity, even if you've already bought it, get this two.
I:10014;1921;well, this is just during the first 15 minutes of the movie.

I:10014;1923;alone film, it was great.
I:10014;1924;Luckily, Joss was able to get a motion picture done for the fans, Serenity.
I:10014;1925;no, it's not Star Wars but Serenity is rated as one of the best modern day sci.
I:10014;1926;The battle / fight scenes are great, the special effects are excellent, and the story keeps you hanging on thoughout the film.
I:10014;1927;"every year ""Can't Stop The Serenity"" shows this movies in theatres across the US for charity benefits."
I:10014;1928;But Serenity wraps most of it up considering they had a limited amount of time.

I:10014;1931;This movie has a great cast, a great plot, great humor and great action.
I:10014;1932;both people who watched the TV show and those who have never heard of Serenity before should be able to enjoy this movie.

I:10014;1935;They will sayor do anything to get you see this movie.
I:10014;1936;Serenity is based on the series Firefly and is a great stand alone story as well as a good introduction to the series it's based on.
I:10014;1937;If you've never seen Firefly, this movie stands as a fine intro and it stands on its own as a good story in its own right.
I:10014;1938;Even in the short time a movie has to offer itself you have a feeling of history with these characters and you want to know more.
I:10014;1939;There should be more films for us to sit in the dark munching popcorn that are like this one!
I:10014;1940;I got this movie before I knew of the series.

I:10014;1943;but lots of fun, innuendo that hit the spot and a very moving, rousing conclusion.

I:10014;1945;As far as I can tell, the crew of the Serenity .

I:10014;1951;but I can live with that when everything else is so good.
I:10014;1952;Even the soundtrack was perfect.
I:10014;1953;Not John Williams, but it was perfect.
I:10014;1954;plus I found and bought two dandy brown coats for myself.
I:10014;1955;My understanding is the Americans and the Chinese resolved their differences to get to space together, and I have to admit that is how a bilingual 'biculture' is born.
I:10014;1956;these guys also read/write in Chinese as well as English, eat Chinese food and drink tea.
I:10014;1957;All these things really make a stand.
I:10014;1958;alone film, yet despite that I understand SERENITY won critical acclaim as the best film adapted from a TV series.
I:10014;1959;If you got fed up with Galactica as fast as I did, check this out and see how it SHOULD be done!
I:10014;1960;I bought this movie without seeing it because I'm not one to dislike many movies .
I:10014;1961;River's personality takes a while to develop, and Jayne evolves as well during the 13 weeks, but mostly, you are in love with each unique character right away.
I:10014;1962;Great continuation of a TV series cancelled before it's time.
I:10014;1963;Great job transitioning the audience who didn't see the TV series.
I:10014;1964;The battle scene at the end was first class.
I:10014;1965;I love the world of Firefly/Serenity and saw the movie on opening night with great joy.
I:10014;1966;I really enjoyed the movie and liked the resolution of the questions the series left hanging.
I:10014;1967;When I opened it I honestly thought I'd been ripped off somehow.
I:10014;1968;Alright, I'm coming from the viewpoint of a browncoat here, but regardless: this movie really was a masterpiece.
I:10014;1969;The special effects were amazing, the acting is superb, the plot line is effective, and I really feel that justice was done to the series.
I:10014;1970;We all know it's a good movie, and they're entitled to their distorted.
I:10014;1971;fi movie, but the story just pulls you in.
I:10014;1972;fi, a little romantic tension , of course, Nathan Fillion, who is hot and good supporting case, well.
I:10014;1973;The firefly series, in my opinion, is some of the best television i've seen.
I:10014;1974;A movie could never cover all this ground, but it did a pretty good job with the time it had.
I:10014;1975;Great movie that goes right along with the series but be sure to watch the complete series before watching the movie if you haven't seen it yet!
I:10014;1976;After watching the series I enjoyed watching the movie.
I:10014;1977;The actors were all excellent in their roles.
I:10014;1978;I continue to hope against hope that we will see one more Serenity film to get the closure all of us browncoats are dying for.
I:10014;1979;After 2 episodes I was completely hooked.
I:10014;1980;This was such an incredible show.
I:10014;1981;i have to say, it's as great if not better!It stands on it's own and is incredible both in terms of characters, story line and action.
I:10014;1982;It was the perfect SciFi movie.
I:10014;1983;At the end of the day he is the great continuous link to every stage of filmmaking .
I:10014;1984;writing, directing, art direction and editing as well as where the buck finally stops with the producer.
I:10014;1985;The normally wonderful characters are not showcased so much as swamped by the sound and fury of what was designed to be a blockbuster motion picture event.
I:10014;1986;I know what he is capable of .
I:10014;1987;The cast consistently shone through and beyond the special effects and the series enjoyed a deft and refreshing art direction, marrying the cultures of east and west under the overarching theme of pioneering a new life as independent entities.
I:10014;1988;on the plus side, the editing is superb .
I:10014;1989;From scene to scene, the lighting design is inspired and enhances the story in subtle but definitive ways, fluently describing the language of visual emotion.

I:10014;1991;ness and it is a pure joy to watch her move.
I:10014;1992;She fights with the effortless grace of a person with their soul on fire.
I:10014;1993;Adam Baldwin is once again simply splendid as Jayne Cobb, casting sardonic asides with the simple conviction of the devoutly cynical.
I:10014;1994;It is a very nice speech for all that.
I:10014;1995;This is also a sadness since the strength and charm and beauty of the series was structured in a way to both showcase and dovetail the quirks, passions, flaws and desires of each character, and all in a way that made the whole much greater than the sum of its parts.
I:10014;1996;at the end of the film, after all the kicking, fighting, fleeing and imaginative bi.
I:10014;1997;Because when a great story is told, a viewer invests something of themselves in that story and they deserve to come away with a sense that this investment was worth.
I:10014;1998;In the film it seems to completely transcend the typical film set to become a place which lives and breathes in its own right.
I:10014;1999;And worth living for in order to journey on.
I:10014;2000;If you see Serenity, see it for the ship.
I:10014;2001;It really is the ideal home and a truly fitting character to name the film after.
I:10014;2002;Entertaining to say the least.

I:10014;2012;included is a special easter.
I:10014;2013;egg, and the joss whedon introduction that was played at the early viewings across the nation.
I:10014;2014;Well, it should be noted that Summer's bar fight is one of the best fight scenes in the history of movies.
I:10014;2015;A great science fiction film that will join Firefly in cult status.
I:10014;2016;A good portion of the movie features fight scenes between the crew and Reavers that go on way too long.
I:10014;2017;River was such an interesting character that I'd really hoped for something more exciting from her character.
I:10014;2018;The ensemble that worked so well on TV often became the Nathan Fillion show on the big screen.
I:10014;2019;The production values, special effects, and acting are all much better than anything seen in the TV show.
I:10014;2020;There's a gem of an interesting philosophical idea when the Firefly crew uncovers the mystery, but it's thrown out there in a heavy.
I:10014;2021;In fact, it does explore several subtle philosophical themes about government control over society and the many aspects of faith.
I:10014;2022;overall: 3.5, rounded down to 3 stars.
I:10014;2023;This was a great movie.
I:10014;2024;The movie has great dialogue and character development and breaks away from traditional sci.
I:10014;2025;Even if you think you won't like it, you will!
I:10014;2026;The new packaging and extra bonus features are very tasty frosting for the cake known as Serenity.
I:10014;2027;This was another surprise gift for the wife that came in on time, in excellent condition and of course a great movie to watch!
I:10014;2028;Great movie based on a great TV show.
I:10014;2029;One of the best movies around, but too unknown.
I:10014;2030;Joss Whedon did a great job taking you on a roller coaster ride.
I:10014;2031;For those of us who have enjoyed Firefly, we left the series yearning for a few key answers.
I:10014;2032;The special features are incredible, including a few 'sessions' as River experienced at the hand of the Alliance.
I:10014;2033;fans watching the film for the first time, watch it with subtitles on.
I:10014;2034;That way you can catch the lightning.
I:10014;2035;That alone tells you everything you need to know about the background.
I:10014;2036;ray, to do so with expedience.
I:10014;2037;Serenity picks up a little bit after where Firefly was left off, and this movie is very enjoyable.
I:10014;2038;The pace is great, the action is impressive, and the various storylines intertwine beautifully.
I:10014;2039;The special features offer a lot of extra information, where even more comedy ensues.
I:10014;2040;Joss proves once again that he has the golden touch.
I:10014;2041;fi epic and action that is exciting without being unnecessary (Another lesson for Mr. Lucas).
I:10014;2042;It has a great storyline and lots of action.
I:10014;2043;If you enjoyed the TV series Firefly, you'll enjoy this.
I:10014;2044;after watching the film with no back ground about the series or the characters, I have to say I loved the movie.
I:10014;2045;this is a great story altogether.
I:10014;2046;Good luck, I know you will enjoy this!!!
I:10014;2047;Serenity is an unexpected thrill ride.
I:10014;2048;fi, survival horror, thriller, action, romance, drama, and definitely comedy.

I:10014;2056;The plot's been told enough times here, but suffice it to say that imagination runs high and the characters each have their own distinct personalities and purposes.

I:10014;2064;It stands alone as a great addition to any movie collection or a wonderful addition to anyone who already ownes the series.
I:10014;2065;it's definately a good movie.
I:10014;2066;I loved the tv show and the movie is a nice closure or a series that should have been longer
I:10014;2067;Joss Whedon has a knack for evoking emotional responses and shocking turns in this creative space opera.

I:10014;2075;Even the special features bring the story to life.
I:10014;2076;but they are worth it.
I:10014;2077;I introduced my wife to Firefly, and she loved it, but wouldn't talk to me for a couple hours after Serenity because now it will change how she remembers it.

I:10014;2081;We had very high expectations for this movie and it did not disappoint.
I:10014;2082;The story was great, the acting was great, and the visual affects were spectacular.
I:10014;2083;If I could give this movie more than 5 stars, I would!
I:10014;2084;If you liked Firefly, then Serenity will be a familiar and pleasant experience for you.

I:10014;2086;All the glory of Serenity with the awesomeness of a new cast commentary, new key art and a bunch of sweet new featurettes!
I:10014;2087;I own both the original and this edition of the Serenity movie!
I:10014;2088;I had a great time playing with all the new extras.
I:10014;2089;The cast commentary is especially fun.
I:10014;2090;Hit enter, and you'll get to watch a short clip about the Fruity Oaty Bar commercial (what River was watching before she went all fight happy the first time).
I:10014;2091;Serenity is the movie spin.
I:10014;2092;Her crew will take on any job, as long as it pays.

I:10014;2094;Serenity and her crew are in for one helluva ride!Serenity has what makes any film great, real characters, great action, laugh out loud humour, thrilling heroics, and an ending that, well, you just have to see!
I:10014;2095;I hope you took notes George.
I:10014;2096;joss Whedon's gift of storytelling is at its best here.

I:10014;2105;I loved Firefly and I loved this movie.
I:10014;2106;Great acting, superb writing, great directing, enough special effects for any sci.
I:10014;2107;You don't really need the TV series for this movie, but it's good to know the characters and the 'verse that started it all.
I:10014;2108;For those of you who haven't seen the TV series, please do.
I:10014;2109;The movie becomes more rich because you better understand the characters and their relationships to one another.
I:10014;2110;But Serenity definitely stands well on it's own.
I:10014;2111;Great storytelling, and a cast that gels very well together.
I:10014;2112;fi fan to enjoy this movie since the writing is so good.
I:10014;2113;And there's plenty of action to keep you entertained.
I:10014;2114;Looks pretty good so far.
I:10014;2115;loved the characters, stories, everything.
I:10014;2116;The film was great in tying up all the loose ends and can definitly stand on its own as a film.
I:10014;2117;An engaging believable storyline, an amazing cast of very talented actors, and writers that just rocked.
I:10014;2118;And you can fully engage with each and every one of them on a personal level.
I:10014;2119;A combination of fantastic writing and fabulous actors really brings us into this world.
I:10014;2120;this is, by far, better than Buffy or Angel.
I:10014;2121;And I totally adored both of those series.
I:10014;2122;But it is its own movie.
I:10014;2123;It helps to fully understand the characters and their motivations.
I:10014;2124;Truly a tale for our time.
I:10014;2125;This was a great movie.
I:10014;2126;Super actions scenes, great dialogue.
I:10014;2127;Mal is Mal, Jane is Jane, Kaley's herself, the writing and directing was true and funny and as smart as ever.
I:10014;2128;"The villain was superbly villanous, and a ""believer"" in his own cause."
I:10014;2129;Superb twists in Mal's strategies.
I:10014;2130;And Shepherd's mystery is still a mystery.
I:10014;2131;I've also corrupted a few friends with it.
I:10014;2132;especially with the crew's regard to River, .
I:10014;2133;The mix of dark, humor , and ingeneous plot twists is still there from the original series, and I do appreciate that, but if I were to watch it again, I'd stop right after Mal rescues Inara, and picture the rest of it myself.
I:10014;2134;gritty, then this is the movie for you.
I:10014;2135;A movie and a story for people who love adventure, love to be given things to think about and do not want to be spoon fed.
I:10014;2136;Amazing visuals, amazing characters and just an all around amazing film.
I:10014;2137;One of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:10014;2138;I love it and so does my 10 year old and my 14 year old.
I:10014;2139;Funny, Sad, Exciting, Brilliant etc.
I:10014;2140;I also love cast commentaries, which the original edition didn't have (I do wish they'd gotten more or all of the main cast on the commentary though .
I:10014;2141;I bought the original Serenity, and it became my favorite movie of all time, spawned by the great series Firefly.
I:10014;2142;I find it hard to believe that this intelligent, well written show with great actors could be canceled after one season.
I:10014;2143;"The image from my Toshiba A2 fed into a 720p Panasonic front projector with a widescreen 96"" diagonal image is spectacular."
I:10014;2144;This movie has a special place on my bookshelf.
I:10014;2145;But this is by far one of the best movies of 2005.
I:10014;2146;I give director/writer Joss Whedon full credit, he made me a fan with the witty dialogue, energetic special effects, and creative storyline.
I:10014;2147;This movie is most definitely made for the fans of the TV series.
I:10014;2148;It's entertaining, action packed, retains the charm of the TV series and gives decent closure for fans.
I:10014;2149;If you liked the TV series, you'll most likely enjoy this.
I:10014;2150;It doesn't tie up all lose ends, but it does address quite a few while sticking with the winning combination of character.
I:10014;2151;driven storylines, memorable characters and dialog, Western gritty ruggedness, space opera grandeur and gorgeous visuals that won over so many Browncoats (Firefly fans).
I:10014;2152;I love the characters of Firefly and was elated when this movie came out.
I:10014;2153;This movie continues with the story of the crew of Serenity.
I:10014;2154;Joss Whedon has continued with his wonderful character development.
I:10014;2155;if you want to know why so many people love this movie/show look no further than the fine cast and creator.
I:10014;2156;It is the people that make this film work.
I:10014;2157;the film is wonderful, the show is wonderful.
I:10014;2158;It's the best work I've seen of Joss Whedon.
I:10014;2159;yet: it's funny, it's smart, and it's heart.
I:10014;2160;For those who haven't seen the series Firefly, don't worry, meeting the crew of Serenity and caring about them is easy.
I:10014;2161;Serenity is a great film born of an even greater TV series.
I:10014;2162;You definitely do not have to see the series to love the movie, also you do not have to be a sci.
I:10014;2163;fi and she laughed, cried, and sat on the edge of her seat .
I:10014;2164;I would recomend this movie to anyone that enjoys witty conversation, action, drama, and believes in love.
I:10014;2165;Great movie for fans of Firefly.
I:10014;2166;Bought it new, and lo and behold, it was new.
I:10014;2167;IKt was a very entertaining show, with great characters.
I:10014;2168;Serenity was a well done extension of the series.
I:10014;2169;this movie includes many genres and does it well.
I:10014;2170;This movie was definitely worth the wait and I can only hope that we are lucky enough to get more of this wonderful story no matter what form it comes in.
I:10014;2171;Then I recommend getting Firefly box set.
I:10014;2172;The first thing that catches you is the originality of this story .
I:10014;2173;The whole story with its engaging cast of characters and their chemistry together ensnares the watcher to dive in and join them.
I:10014;2174;I have watched the entire series so seeing the movie was nice.
I:10014;2175;Good charactes + lots of action!
I:10014;2176;fiction movie, but it also has very positive individualist themes .
I:10014;2177;how evil Utopianism and the suppression of human nature is, how belief in false values is evil and how one must take a stance for good values, and the value of benevolence.
I:10014;2178;also, I really liked the language that they used in the movie.
I:10014;2179;Typically Westerns are very individualistic, so I thought that fit very well in the movie.
I:10014;2180;Given the large budget and resources available for Serenity, I expected it to be a genuinely good movie and a fitting conclusion to the fantastic firefly series.
I:10014;2181;I really liked the series and the movie ending the series was very good.
I:10014;2182;As a fan of the show I am incredibly happy that they released this movie to somewhat tie up the loose ends that the show never got to.
I:10014;2183;The space battle towards the end is epic and the feel of the movie comes off just like you were watching an episode of Firefly.
I:10014;2184;A must see for any fan!
I:10014;2185;"jabber to get to this:IMHO, ""Serenity"" was a VERY GOOD, refreshing, 4."
I:10014;2186;"star movie on the Amazon scale and an ""A."" on the Yahoo scale."
I:10014;2187;"How utterly refreshing to see fictional characters behave the way ""real"" people do.2."
I:10014;2188;That everyone spoke, well, mostly sweared, in Chinese.
I:10014;2189;"The merging of Eatern and Western cultures made this fictional future/universe as intriguing as ""Blade Runner"".3."
I:10014;2190;written, witty, and perfectly timed.
I:10014;2191;dialog, perfectly executed by a top.
I:10014;2192;Damn refreshing to see genuine actors enjoying and appreciating their craft instead of a bunch of cause.
I:10014;2193;And the ship just looked cool, especially in the opening and ending sequences.5.
I:10014;2194;"The Parliament's ""Operative"", another refreshing character."
I:10014;2195;This guy was calm, calculating, and truly believed that he was working for the greater good and the end justified his means.
I:10014;2196;He definitely was NOT the greedy/power.
I:10014;2197;He was likeable enough, but just seemed like a plot.
I:10014;2198;and the gorgeous love interest of Captain Mal.

I:10014;2200;She was there, and she had an interesting back.
I:10014;2201;I was really pleased that they put the spot.
I:10014;2202;The cast was superb, each actor seemed born for their part, the script was fantastic, and the story was absolutely inspiring.
I:10014;2203;The story was warm, funny, and heartbreaking, and there was an amazing amount of depth present in this film.
I:10014;2204;Joss Whedon's genius was on high display in Serenity.
I:10014;2205;The film is also highly accessible.
I:10014;2206;fi fan to appreciate it.
I:10014;2207;"I brought two of my gal pals to see the movie and both hate science fiction, but both were thoroughly impressed and praised it as a ""really good movie."""
I:10014;2208;80+% of critics also enjoyed it, which is rare praise for a science fiction film.
I:10014;2209;the movie is a spin.
I:10014;2210;I loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer, however, so I thought I'd give Joss Whedon's new series a chance.
I:10014;2211;every time I saw Serenity in the theater, the audiences laughed, gasped, and applauded.
I:10014;2212;The story is engaging, easy to understand, and even easier to appreciate.
I:10014;2213;Joss Whedon's mastery over the English language translates into a colorful (in a good way) script, and the pace at which the movie unfolds is perfection.
I:10014;2214;This is a human story, despite it being a sci.
I:10014;2215;Joss Whedon's focus has always been on people, and his characters are rich, warm, and three.
I:10014;2216;fiction has its characters exist to revolve around their fantastic worlds and ideas.
I:10014;2217;It's a story about the characters, and everything revolves around the main characters.
I:10014;2218;Mal is the perfect anti.
I:10014;2219;as fascinating as Mal (who is played by the funny and dashing Nathan Fillion) is, it's River who steals the show.
I:10014;2220;River is a gifted teenage girl that was once part of a government experiment.
I:10014;2221;River is played by the beautiful Summer Glau, who brings extraordinary grace to the character.
I:10014;2222;It was a treat to see Summer Glau's fight scenes, since she's a classically trained ballet dancer.
I:10014;2223;I'm sure it was intentional, since the character was described as loving dance, but all the fight scenes flowed like a dance.
I:10014;2224;The film is action packed and the plot is emotionally driven.
I:10014;2225;This film is a fine example of the perfection that results in a marriage between good action and fine storytelling.
I:10014;2226;I have always only encouraged and suggested, but this film deserves it.
I:10014;2227;It's the best film of 2005.
I:10014;2228;That's really all I have to say.
I:10014;2229;liners than you can shake a stick at, but that's Whedon's style (at least I realize now that it is after watching the first few episodes of Firefly).
I:10014;2230;i know I'll be stoned for saying this, but I honestly believe that Serenity is a better movie than any of the 6 Star Wars films.
I:10014;2231;Granted, Star Wars has a certain appeal to it because of the cultural significance and the circularity of the movies, but Whedon's storytelling makes George Lucas look like junior high play.
I:10014;2232;It was fabulous for old fans of the series, and also great fun for those that were new to the story.
I:10014;2233;It was by turns, funny, exciting, and shocking.
I:10014;2234;This film has heart on a scale that I rarely see.
I:10014;2235;There is just enough SFX to make you believe the environment might just exist, and the cinematography is wonderful.
I:10014;2236;fi at all give this one a shot.
I:10014;2237;Effectively a Western in space, Serenity is a thoroughly entertaining, smartly written, beautifully acted, rip.
I:10014;2238;"adventure movie, that will appeal to both Firefly fans and newcomers alike."""

I:10014;2241;I bought the movie not knowing anything about the Firefly TV series or what to expect.
I:10014;2242;To my surprise, Serenity proved to be one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.
I:10014;2243;Serenity is one of the best science fiction adventures on film.
I:10014;2244;Additional features are telling of the depth of feeling the actors had for this film.
I:10014;2245;The movie is a solid 3/5 stars for people who have never seen the TV show, but a 2/5 stars for people who like the the show.
I:10014;2246;The story is truly and simply amazing.
I:10014;2247;the special effects and look of this movie are grade A and look fantastic.
I:10014;2248;There are many scenes that are really just breathtaking.
I:10014;2249;The movie also has a lot of action, but it also has a very deep storyline that keeps it from ever being dull.
I:10014;2250;There are both surprises and revelations in this movie that will keep you talking for long time.
I:10014;2251;I definitely recommend this movie, even to those who have never seen the TV series.
I:10014;2252;It will make you a fan for sure.
I:10014;2253;the plot really focuses on River, exploring her past and the things that can 'set her off' so to speak.
I:10014;2254;A tad more violent than it needed to be, but this was a great continuation of the Firefly story.
I:10014;2255;It answered many questions from the series and made the movie even more enjoyable.
I:10014;2256;but you're so busy enjoying the story and numerous surprises that you'll only realise it much later after the movie.
I:10014;2257;Having seen the full series and movie now I hope they find a way to continue the story.
I:10014;2258;The series translated to the big screen quite well.
I:10014;2259;lots of action, good acting, nice FX, poignancy.
I:10014;2260;I for one knew I was in for the time of my life.
I:10014;2261;it made me literally cry it was so good.
I:10014;2262;now I'm sure plenty of folk here have told you what this is about and how gorram good it is.
I:10014;2263;The movie is a great standalone film as well as an addition to the series.
I:10014;2264;Serenity it is a great film because of its unique acting, Wild West.
I:10014;2265;Here the viewer meets the first two members of the crew, River Tam, a genetically superior girl, and her brother Simon, the crews doctor.
I:10014;2266;After their daring escape the viewer finds the rest of the crew on their Firefly class transport ship named the Serenity.
I:10014;2267;fiction adventure can easily be compared to the Star Wars franchise and can easily be adored by those who love Star Wars.
I:10014;2268;It is original but is similar enough for Star Wars fans to delve into.
I:10014;2269;fiction fans or fans of the series Firefly, this is a must see.
I:10014;2270;Serenity brings great graphics, fun characters, an interesting perspective of the future, and makes one think about the moral decisions you make.
I:10014;2271;The thing that makes this movie more mesmerizing and electrifying than the TV series is the incredible performance by Summer Glau.
I:10014;2272;She completely and absolutelydominated every scene she was in with a presence and intensity that brought you to that reality.
I:10014;2273;One of my favorite movies.
I:10014;2274;very well written and cast.
I:10014;2275;Just the right amount of humor and craziness.
I:10014;2276;i would have loved to be witness to the filming of the series and the movie.
I:10014;2277;If you enjoy the tv show, you'll love it.
I:10014;2278;This was a great movie that shows sometimes the little guys win when they are in the right.
I:10014;2279;There were a lot of funny, quotable lines in the movie.
I:10014;2280;As always, Summer Glau delivered an awesome performance.
I:10014;2281;now I'd call myself a pretty big fan of science fiction, and pretty easy to please in terms of being entertained, definitely.
I:10014;2282;Suffice to say, this is probably my favorite film from last year, and definitely my favorite so. called 'space opera' of all.
I:10014;2283;This is one of those films that has got it all: Good action, interesting, dynamic and most of all, very likable characters, emotional resonance, lotsa extremely funny dialogue and last but not least, zombies.
I:10014;2284;Nathan Fillion's Mal Reynolds is a classic character.
I:10014;2285;hero who is actually somewhat idealistic at heart archetype, but this is probably my favorite sort of hero, and he plays it as well as anyone ever has.
I:10014;2286;Chiwetel Elijofor is also especially good as the villainous Operative.
I:10014;2287;killer, but he gives the role a bit more depth then it usually has.
I:10014;2288;The film also deserves credit for just allowing a somewhat novel take on the genre.
I:10014;2289;i have to say that I really enjoy this universe.
I:10014;2290;It is very well considered and fleshed out with all manner and form of humanity having diverged into pockets of life that are quite apart from one another, as I imagine it would be in a future of colonised Milky Way galaxy.
I:10014;2291;Very good show based on the television series Serenity.
I:10014;2292;Good look for science fiction fans.
I:10014;2293;The special effects are great, as is the story line.
I:10014;2294;One of the best science fiction films ever made.
I:10014;2295;This is one of the best movies that I've bought.
I:10014;2296;If you like that, you will love this movie.
I:10014;2297;Summer Glau is excellent in this movie.
I:10014;2298;The movie is good and can be enjoyed without having seen the season of Firefly, but of course it's even better if you have!
I:10014;2299;Amazing special effects add impact to an already great story.
I:10014;2300;River Tam provides a better character in Serenity than in the series.
I:10014;2301;If you enjoyed the series at all, this was a great way to conclude it for the fans of the show.
I:10014;2302;Very good and exciting movie!
I:10014;2303;I loved it to the end.
I:10014;2304;A lot of action and a little bit of the unknown element.
I:10014;2305;I was very happy to add this to my collection along with the complete series.
I:10014;2306;What Firefly did was create a great ensemble cast that play their roles so perfectly, I still marvel at it every time I watch an episode.
I:10014;2307;'Serenity extends the story and fills in some of the past.
I:10014;2308;The effects are well done (it's not Lord of the Rings, but they're good and consistent with the series).
I:10014;2309;But it's the cast and their relationships that make this movie (and series) so special.
I:10014;2310;the way the cast chemistry worked).
I:10014;2311;mal (the captain) is perfect as the ex.
I:10014;2312;at the end of the day, that's what made this film/series so special.
I:10014;2313;The characters are genuine and easy to care about.
I:10014;2314;There is just that chemistry that's present in any good series/film between the cast.
I:10014;2315;Every episode provided good action and comic relief.
I:10014;2316;I would rate Firefly/Serenity in the top 20 because it's just such a good ride.
I:10014;2317;fi movie that is the way sci.
I:10014;2318;so it is almost like it is two movies, on one hand it is a satisfying completion to a wonderful series that many people loved, (even those who like me missed it until after the movie), and on the other hand this is a very good allegory of a story about big government, and even a look at the dangers of psycho.
I:10014;2319;in any case this is a visually stunning film, very well written, very well acted, with completely believable special effects.
I:10014;2320;if you want an excellent sci.
I:10014;2321;fi movie this is it, but do yourself a favor and watch the series first.
I:10014;2322;I was surprised by the depth of the characters and the really fun, quick witted dialog.
I:10014;2323;This is a really good movie.
I:10014;2324;We loved the Firefly series, and were anxious to see the ending to the show.
I:10014;2325;The writing and acting were great as was the series, but this movie did have a lot darker theme to it.
I:10014;2326;We still enjoyed it, and it did finalize everything, but I preferred the lighter side of the series.
I:10014;2327;Characters you love and can relate to, a deep, engaging story, plot twists, thrills and chills, humor at all the right places.
I:10014;2328;This is the best movie that's been made in the last 10 years.
I:10014;2329;"What I like about the show was its realistic future technology and its realistic science fiction antagonist ""us""."
I:10014;2330;The film is a continuation of this very good show and would be a very good science ficton movie as a stand alone film.
I:10014;2331;The show was well written and acted.
I:10014;2332;Hopefully, fans of Firefly got some closure to a great show.
I:10014;2333;I enjoyed the movie, tho, I wish the series could have continued.
I:10014;2334;length production puts a final, graceful exclamation mark at the end of the Firefly series.
I:10014;2335;Many of your favorite characters from the TV show are here, and lots of questions answered and loose ends tied up.
I:10014;2336;ray edition of the film is really that clear and crisp.
I:10014;2337;The story is involving, and the characters, in spite of being far removed from our world, are strong and believable.
I:10014;2338;And there is a LOT of action!
I:10014;2339;You'll be impressed while you're being entertained.
I:10014;2340;five hundred years from now the earth is used up and humanity takes to the stars.
I:10014;2341;"Some of these planets are ""rich and flush with the new technology
I:10014;2342;You see River is a prodigy and the Alliance has conducted experiments on her in an effort to enhance her abilities which has the side effect of leaving her psychotic.
I:10014;2343;Ejifor's performance is one the best in the film and his is most memorable villain.
I:10014;2344;i thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
I:10014;2345;Though the special effects are good they are in no way in the class of Star Wars.
I:10014;2346;The story is well told and plotted and Wheedon suffuses the whole with moments of whit and humor.
I:10014;2347;Some of the best comic moments are reserved for engineer Kaylee Frye, played by the incredibly gorgeous Jewell Staite, and tough guy Jayne Cobb, played by the always reliable Adam Baldwin.
I:10014;2348;Unlike some of the failed Star Trek movies, Wheedon does an excellent job of utilizing his entire cast in a way that never seems contrived.
I:10014;2349;Each character is given their own unique moment in the film.
I:10014;2350;This leads to some surprising moments, including the deaths of two major characters.
I:10014;2351;It picks up and embellishes on the original episodes and provides a satisfying conclusion should this be the end of the line.
I:10014;2352;"I certainly hope it is not and I have read that the entire cast has signed on for a sequel should ""Serenity"" prove sufficiently successful at the box office."
I:10014;2353;if you have never watched the show before the movie provides enough backstory for you to jump right in and enjoy.
I:10014;2354;"So please do all of us ""Firefly"" fans a favor see ""Serenity"" so that there might be a future for this great story and these great characters."
I:10014;2355;Great follow up to the ending of the series.
I:10014;2356;The cast of characters were great.
I:10014;2357;I've seen this movie twice, with friends who were Firefly fans and with total newcomers to the story.
I:10014;2358;"Every one of them has come away saying ""what a great movie""."
I:10014;2359;The reason is not complicated, it's just that with all the big budget effects and action sequences that are part of the standard package these days, we've forgotten how satisfying a movie can be when it has an ensemble of characters we care about and a story which is well written and well acted.
I:10014;2360;"Serenity does have the ""fun factor"" of a rollicking sci."
I:10014;2361;fi adventure yarn, the sort of feel Star Wars used to have, but it also has a depth that leaves you well satisfied and keen to go right back in and see it all again.
I:10014;2362;I will be the first one on line for a movie ticket.
I:10014;2363;It's got this cover which swings open like a book.
I:10014;2364;the movie, it really goes without saying, is wonderful.
I:10014;2365;The special features were pretty good, especially the commentary track.
I:10014;2366;white images, there is a surprising amount of additional detail you can see on them on your TV rather than your computer screen.
I:10014;2367;It really adds something to these mini.
I:10014;2368;It was spliced together with other, new, footage, and some of the re.
I:10014;2369;Hard core fans, or people who don't have a copy of Serenity yet, will want to get this.
I:10014;2370;And if you're the type who is holding out for a sequel, like I am, it's also worthwhile to pick up.
I:10014;2371;This was a great movie and a great series.
I:10014;2372;Plenty of action, acting was excellent as always.
I:10014;2373;Loved the series, but didn't think this was a noteworthy end.
I:10014;2374;this is an interesting film.
I:10014;2375;The cinematography is good, the direction is good.
I:10014;2376;It's ambitious, and that much alone makes it worth recommending.
I:10014;2377;It's a really good effort.
I:10014;2378;The captain of the Serenity is very, very good in his role.
I:10014;2379;kind of an Angelina Jolie f. me.
I:10014;2380;It may not be perfect, but it's one of the few good science fiction movies produced in the past twenty.
I:10014;2381;It's a gasp of air after the claustrophobic/stale Star Wars.
I:10014;2382;it's a very good SF movie.
I:10014;2383;I mean, I can always sell it on ebay.
I:10014;2384;good special effects and martial arts action, but I guess I really enjoyed it because of the story and characters.
I:10014;2385;it has some of the Han Solo and STV Tom Paris witty dialogue.
I:10014;2386;Imaginative, good moral, a thriller.
I:10014;2387;the movie has a good story, good acting, and the right amount of action.
I:10014;2388;I was really happy that it came swiftly/promptly in the mail.
I:10014;2389;This is a great conclusion to the series.
I:10014;2390;It's far darker and action oriented than the show, and there's less hokey/charming character development and interaction, but it does an amazing job wrapping up the loose ends of the series.
I:10014;2391;I just got back from the first showing in my area on opening day.
I:10014;2392;I am proud to report that Serenity is a pretty good movie .
I:10014;2393;not great, just pretty good.
I:10014;2394;The story is very tightly told and has many very clever plot points.
I:10014;2395;The humor, of course, is very much Joss Whedon's uniquely brilliant brand, but as with Firefly, it's not abundant.
I:10014;2396;If you haven't watched the entire firefly series, I recommend watching it first.
I:10014;2397;Anybody who rates this as an excellent movie.
I:10014;2398;well lets just say it doesn't take much to amuse them.
I:10014;2399;I love a good sci fi, action/adventure.
I:10014;2400;If you want real good sci fi watch the Star Wars Saga's.
I:10014;2401;My wife is a big Firefly fan.
I:10014;2402;As a present, I took her to see the special exclusive pre.
I:10014;2403;What sticks with you is the epic story line, the powerful character archetypes, the feeling of continuity between the characters.
I:10014;2404;by far the most underrated movie of the last decade.
I:10014;2405;There was a distinct western flavor to this movie.
I:10014;2406;I very much enjoyed this movie.
I:10014;2407;IMDB has this flick as one of the highest ranking films ever!
I:10014;2408;I was barely able to finish it.
I:10014;2409;But the rest of the crew knew each other.
I:10014;2410;Was the film just a retelling of the story, meant to stand apart from the series?All that said, this is a very smart, way above average sci fi film with outstanding effects.
I:10014;2411;I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.
I:10014;2412;intriguing, inovative and personal, makes you wish you were there.
I:10014;2413;I wasn't a big fan of the series, but this movie was fantastic.
I:10014;2414;Great characters, good story, cool bad guys, tons of action, and some of the best dialogue I've heard in a while.
I:10014;2415;This is a true Sci.
I:10014;2416;fi film, better than episodes 1, 2, and 3 of the Star Wars movies.
I:10014;2417;This movie is great as a stand.
I:10014;2418;Serenity is, in essence, a 2nd and final season of Firefly condensed into a movie.
I:10014;2419;like humans who attack, maul, and eat anyone they come across, is a theme throughout the show, ending with an eye.
I:10014;2420;The characters in this movie are fun and interesting, with a natural chemistry that is what made Firefly so popular.
I:10014;2421;Touches of romance stand shoulder to shoulder with tough guys and high.
I:10014;2422;The writers for the show came up with fresh and spunky dialog that is laugh.
I:10014;2423;loud funny or quirky and sarcastic.
I:10014;2424;fantasy, with romance next to almost wild.
I:10014;2425;It's all the good stuff rolled into one movie.
I:10014;2426;summary: excellent entertainment for adults, with the freedom from real.
I:10014;2427;life worries present in most dramas, since everything in this story is fantasy.
I:10014;2428;It was a great end.
I:10014;2429;to one of the best series (sci.
I:10014;2430;one of my favorite ensemble casts of all time!
I:10014;2431;I had the distinct pleasure of seeing this movie with an audience loaded with people who have never watched the Fox TV show Firefly (when it was on Fox or now that is on Sci.
I:10014;2432;after the movie ended and the applause faded, Whedon won over another group of people to his camp.
I:10014;2433;They saw what I saw: A nearly perfect movie from beginning to end .
I:10014;2434;"great screenplay, great acting
I:10014;2435;To top it off, Serenity has a decent budget, the movie.
I:10014;2436;great!One of the best films out this year.
I:10014;2437;Serenity answers all of those questions, and more.
I:10014;2438;"I recieved The entire Firefly series as a gift, and I was not satisfied until I added ""Serenity"" to it."
I:10014;2439;so this is my chance to finally see the movie, I've waited for sooooo long!
I:10014;2440;Really well developed characters, great dialogue, great story, great acting.
I:10014;2441;Joss Whedon writes some of the best female characters around.
I:10014;2442;An excellent recap and final episode of what should have been a 'long running' series.
I:10014;2443;Thank you Joss for a wonderful (and too short) ride.
I:10014;2444;regardless, it was worth the proverbial price of admission to snatch up the series and Serenity for my own.
I:10014;2445;We found a new solar system, dozens of planets and hundreds of moons.
I:10014;2446;Each one terraformed, a process taking decades, to support human life.
I:10014;2447;Then, sure enough, you see the speaker, a teacher standing in front of her young charges.
I:10014;2448;And now, everyone can enjoy the comfort and enlightenment of true civilization.
I:10014;2449;One of the students is the young River Tam.
I:10014;2450;First the disembodied voice, which turns into the teacher, which turns into a memory of the now 17 year.
I:10014;2451;So here's us, on the raggedy edge.
I:10014;2452;"The themes of Serenity"" are universal, sometimes troubling."
I:10014;2453;The humor is great and frequently campy.
I:10014;2454;The Captain looks at him: Define interesting.
I:10014;2455;Now, we have both for home viewing, and I strongly recommend watching the TV series first, if possible.
I:10014;2456;The movie does stand alone and gives you sufficient background.
I:10014;2457;But the experience will be richer if you have seen the TV series first.

I:10014;2459;Watch the movie with picture.
I:10014;2460;Interviews, rehearsal footage and behind.
I:10014;2461;watching the movie with Whedon's commentary.
I:10014;2462;In casting Chiwetel Ejidfor, we found the perfect person because he brings such depth and soulfulness and regret to everything he does.
I:10014;2463;For example, there are two universal languages used, English and Chinese.
I:10014;2464;"it's also interesting how he ""chose"" his hero: ""I just wanted to tell a story about people who are living in space, but not living in grandeur."
I:10014;2465;And the hero's background: There's very little American fiction about the people who won the [Civil] war, about the North.
I:10014;2466;"Commentators include Whedon and most of the ""Firefly"" cast."
I:10014;2467;The most memorable moment was the San Diego ComicCon, after the show's cancellation and before the movie was finished.
I:10014;2468;The perfect example of the Space Cowboy movie!
I:10014;2469;I loved knowing what happened to my beloved Firefly voyagers!
I:10014;2470;lived TV series, is very well done.
I:10014;2471;A fine addition to any science fiction buff's collection.
I:10014;2472;I had seen it once at that time and had thought it was indeed very good and that it was certainly better than any of the Star Wars prequels.
I:10014;2473;So I went to see it a couple more times.
I:10014;2474;This movie is so detailed and nuanced that it can only truly be appreciated after multiple viewings.
I:10014;2475;You can watch it over and over and not only not get tired of it, but come to appreciate it more and more each time you see it.
I:10014;2476;Also, keep an eye on Summer Glau's performance as River Tam .
I:10014;2477;probably won't get an Oscar nomination, but she certainly deserves one.
I:10014;2478;My gf and I watched the Firefly series and really loved the characters.
I:10014;2479;It took me a bit to warm up to new actors like Nathan Fillion and Morena Baccarin but they aquitted themselves nicely.
I:10014;2480;You don't have to watch the Firefly series but it certainly helps.
I:10014;2481;chiwetal Ejiofor is a nice newcomer here and plays a nice villian.
I:10014;2482;I like to see the range this actor has.
I:10014;2483;"I saw the movie before I even knew there was a TV series it was based on
I:10014;2484;"What a tragedy it was cancelled
I:10014;2485;While it is a shame that Firefly only made it through one season, this movie does a good job of using the same cast and jumping to a decent conclusion for the series.
I:10014;2486;If you are a fan of the Firefly series or Stargate type flicks you will probably enjoy this movie as well.5 Stars.
I:10014;2487;human aliens, ONLY fancy, hi.
I:10014;2488;Josh Whedan has created an interesting and practical universe and future for mankind, where people still use six shooters and shotguns because they are (probably) cheap and cost effective.
I:10014;2489;The lighting in the movie was fantastic and deserved a nod from one of the snotty Hollywood awards programs.
I:10014;2490;"i'd never heard of any of the cast, but they did a fine job, especially the guy who played ""Mal"", this guy is going to be big someday."
I:10014;2491;The dialog was some of the best I've ever heard.
I:10014;2492;The whole movie was an interesting mix of funny and serious.
I:10014;2493;Funny scenes could turn on a dime and suddenly be dramatic, and vice.
I:10014;2494;"This may also turn off mainstream viewers, who tend to want their movies to be strictly comedies, dramas, actions, etc. overall, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Serenity""."
I:10014;2495;Most of what I love about it has already been said:1) Absolutely fantastic characters that grow on you.2) Incredibly talented cast.3) Top.
I:10014;2496;notch writing.4) Hilarious, witty dialog.5) A unique vision of the future, without all of the tiresome SciFi cliches.6) Great story and script with a perfect mix of action, drama, and wit.7) Incredible camerawork(a la BSG) that draws you into the film.8) Good FX (despite what the online BDI's say), especially considering this was NOT a big budget film.
I:10014;2497;"and this was all BEFORE I experienced the series ""Firefly""!"
I:10014;2498;watched Serenity with a whole new appreciation for the movie and the Firefly universe.
I:10014;2499;It's about the crew, their bond with each other, and their daily struggle to survive.
I:10014;2500;i wholeheartedly recommend both Serenity and Firefly and sincerely hope there is an enlightened network out there somewhere(SciFi Channel, WAKE THE HELL UP!)
I:10014;2501;that will put this incredible series back on the air.
I:10014;2502;"(BTW, I also recommend the Serenity comic book/graphic novel and the book ""Finding Serenity"", both available on Amazon."
I:10014;2503;line takes place after the end of the series and leads into the movie.
I:10014;2504;The book is a great collection of essays written about Firefly and the 'Verse.)
I:10014;2505;This is the greatest of all the space operas.
I:10014;2506;Great cast in a miraculous triumph of a movie based on the Firefly series which was the most wonderful series I have ever seen.
I:10014;2507;And it is so funny at times that I keep wondering why oh why did Star Wars take such a serious take on space operas?
I:10014;2508;Not only does it now have great definition but it also has heaps of extra features about the Serenity/Firefly verse.
I:10014;2509;Anyone who loved firefly will like this movie.
I:10014;2510;We heard about the movie Serenity, got super excited.
I:10014;2511;Also, we felt like the movie was a great wrap up of the show since the show had not been able to continue.
I:10014;2512;If you love Firefly this is a must watch!
I:10014;2513;This is a wonderful movie.
I:10014;2514;Its a great follow up to a great tv series, and we can only hope for more to come.
I:10014;2515;What matters is what's inside, and what's inside is an amazing, fun, thought.
I:10014;2516;This intrigued me, so I read a lot of the Amazon reviews for `Firefly'.
I:10014;2517;After seeing that even though quite a few people gave it 0.1 stars, it still came out on top of 550+ reviews with an astounding 5 stars, so I ordered it as well.
I:10014;2518;The special effects of the series, as well as the movie, might not be up to par with Star Wars, but that combined with the perfect cast members, are what make it all the more realistic and believable.
I:10014;2519;In my opinion, they are both most excellent.
I:10014;2520;Love it, great movie if you love the Firefly series this is a must have!
I:10014;2521;Makes a great a gift for your Firefly loving family/friends as well.
I:10014;2522;Loved the TV show .
I:10014;2523;Characters are a blast and the cast is great.
I:10014;2524;Above all it is a compelling story that has a cast that genuinely gels, it's evident that these people care about each other.
I:10014;2525;"i felt the same excitement in this film that I felt as a small girl seeing ""Star Wars"" for the first time ."
I:10014;2526;I love Firefly and Serenity.
I:10014;2527;This collector's edition has so much more than just the movie.
I:10014;2528;I'm an avid fan so it was great to have a conclusion to the Firefly TV show.
I:10014;2529;Lots of great actors who are now doing their own thing.
I:10014;2530;The old cast came back and did a great job!
I:10014;2531;I really loved the movie.
I:10014;2532;star rating in, so I'll keep this short and sweet.
I:10014;2533;Watch both Firefly and Serenity and enjoy every single delightful moment.
I:10014;2534;Afterwards, you will be proud to call yourself a Browncoat.
I:10014;2535;This is a fantastic movie .
I:10014;2536;though this movie stands wonderfully alone it is even more enjoyable when one has seen theFirefly .
I:10014;2537;The Complete Seriesepisodes (basically the prequil to the movie) because one has a fuller and deeper understanding of and connection with the characters.
I:10014;2538;"One of the best science fiction films in recent memory, based on the failed TV show ""Firefly""."
I:10014;2539;"Great characters and dialogue that is never seen in SF films for ""today's sophisticated audience""."
I:10014;2540;If they ever make a sequel (man I hope they do) I will be there the day it opensAfter seeing the movie I picked up the series and it was great.
I:10014;2541;it had fantastic dialogue, great visuals, and gorgeous music.
I:10014;2542;And most important (at least for me), it was surprising.
I:10014;2543;He does the unexpected and it just rocks.
I:10014;2544;I was clutching my seat, gasping in shock along with everyone else in the theater.
I:10014;2545;And when it was over, they audience applauded, in a movie theater.
I:10014;2546;What does that tell you?Also, even as a woman I can say this without jealousy, but Gina Torres is gorgeous in this film.
I:10014;2547;i loved this movie, nuff said
I:10014;2548;The decision on this movie is simple.
I:10014;2549;If you are a fan of the Firefly TV series, you must see this movie.
I:10014;2550;The Firefly series and its conclusion movie Serenity are a wonderful combination of the action.
I:10014;2551;fi/space and western genres .
I:10014;2552;all presented with witty conversations, wonderful characters, and hilarious situations that have viewers literally laughing out loud again and again.
I:10014;2553;to better understand this recommendation, pick a favorite TV series with funny characters.
I:10014;2554;For illustration, I'll pick Everybody Loves Raymond.
I:10014;2555;rate movie, it's the funny characters playing it out that would make this hypothetical movie tremendously entertaining.
I:10014;2556;the Serenity movie is similar to the example above.
I:10014;2557;Serenity was one of the most enjoyable science fiction movie aired recently.
I:10014;2558;"The camera navigation is very fine grained and fortunately not ""shaky""."
I:10014;2559;The illumination effects of the scenes are very aesthetic, too.
I:10014;2560;"The space battles are thrilling and artistic
I:10014;2561;So the CGI is excellent, of course this is a subjective opinion.
I:10014;2562;The cast was excellent, but the storyline sometimes seems to be too dramatic.
I:10014;2563;I personally very liked River's character.
I:10014;2564;The fighting sequences were awesome with the subtle choreography.
I:10014;2565;This movie is worth watching not just for the Firefly fans, but for anyone who like science fiction.
I:10014;2566;Altogether Serenity was one of the best science fiction experiences for me recently.
I:10014;2567;This was a great series (Firefly) followed by a great movie.
I:10014;2568;It has a great story, the graphics are very believable and professionaly done.
I:10014;2569;The actors portray characters that are so humanly flawed, yet loyal and endearing.
I:10014;2570;We loved it so much we bought the complete Firefly series (the prequel to this) and Serenity the movie.
I:10014;2571;Tragically the effort is a last breath for all the under.
I:10014;2572;I have become a huge fan .
I:10014;2573;the director's depictions of the new space frontier is vivid and realistic with no aliens and other outlandish tales.
I:10014;2574;the mistery behind the reefers of course is revealed in the movie and I hope to see another series or movie out soon!
I:10014;2575;Simply put one of the best movies of 2005.
I:10014;2576;"This movie has everything that was lacking from the last 3 ""Star Wars"" movies: good plot, interesting 3 dimensional characters, witty dialogue."
I:10014;2577;"it may not be to everyone's tastes, but if you value substance over style, character driven movies vs. action driven movies, and witty dialogue
I:10014;2578;This is an excellent movie.
I:10014;2579;"For those who aren't familiar with ""Firefly"" TV series this is based on (one of the best Sci Fi series, by the way) don't worry."
I:10014;2580;lots of satisfying action, comic relief and good acting.
I:10014;2581;One of my favorite movies to watch over and over.
I:10014;2582;But I bet you will want to after seeing this film.2.
I:10014;2583;This movie gives more detail and answers some questions that are floating around in the series.
I:10014;2584;The movie is well done and the characters continue their banter, sexual tensions, and rogue behaviors, drawing a strong conclusion in the end, as to what happens to a world when the Government tries to control everything and create a 'perfect world'.
I:10014;2585;The casting was genius and the mix of old and future made you feel like it was really possible for our own future to be similar.
I:10014;2586;Great plot, and each time I watch it, I find a little something new.
I:10014;2587;The story/script was better than average (comedy right on) and the acting quite good at times, but there are plenty of amaturish acting moments as well (TV caliber acting).
I:10014;2588;Perfect ending to an incredible series (Firefly).
I:10014;2589;The show builds up to something, then never delivers.
I:10014;2590;greatest ending to one of the greatest Sci.
I:10014;2591;Serenity the movie provides something of a winding up, a resolution, to one of the underlying themes of the series, but still leaves fans wanting, in more ways than one.
I:10014;2592;It is also one of the few series that translated well to the big screen.
I:10014;2593;And thank you, thank you thank you!
I:10014;2594;I loved it and wished more Firefly seasons had been done.
I:10014;2595;It's simply one of the best written TV shows in the last 10 years.
I:10014;2596;There are also soundtracks for both Firefly and Serenity that are thoroughly enjoyable to listen to.
I:10014;2597;i will admit i am a fan of the series, so it makes sense that i loved this movie.
I:10014;2598;enough to go watch it three times already, and i will go see it a few more.
I:10014;2599;all ages, all races, everyone had a great movie expereince.
I:10014;2600;and that is what makes a great movie.
I:10014;2601;when people who have seen it tell friends who will then go see it and tell more friends, etc. so.
I:10014;2602;This is one of the modern classic space western/sci.
I:10014;2603;Watching Firefly and Serenity are must.
I:10014;2604;The movie is really good too and you should do yourself a favor and check it out.
I:10014;2605;It brought back memories of Blade Runner, the Japanese anime Cowboy Bebop, and the EA game Privateer.
I:10014;2606;If you enjoyed any one of these titles, you would probably enjoy this movie as well.
I:10014;2607;Even for people who are not familiar with them, this is great story with a high level human realism (as far as scifi goes).
I:10014;2608;"audio is impressive too, somebody can say ""perfect"" and I'll agree."
I:10014;2609;This is the epic ending to a series that should be revived.
I:10014;2610;I never did see the show Firefly before I saw the movie but I am so very pleased with what I was introduced to.
I:10014;2611;Joss does a great job in creating a 'Verse that is believeable and plausible, yet enjoyable and entertaining at the same time.
I:10014;2612;"You'll root for the crew of the Serenity as they ""fly true"" through all the Alliance has to dish them."
I:10014;2613;Besides this movie having an incredible cast and story, it also has one of the best transfers to blu ray that you can find.
I:10014;2614;This ranks right up there with Star Wars as a favorite sci.
I:10014;2615;The story moves quickly and the characters come to life right before your eyes.
I:10014;2616;I'm blown away at how cool this movie is and how good it looks.
I:10014;2617;i found the extras on the disc great.
I:10014;2618;You can definitely see that Serenity is an act of passion and love.
I:10014;2619;Joss Whedon has made something masterful.
I:10014;2620;This movie is fantastic, best sci.
I:10014;2621;fi movie I've seen in ages.
I:10014;2622;Firefly the Series has been one of our favorites.
I:10014;2623;And Serenity links perfectly into it.
I:10014;2624;The movie includes all the main characters, which we have come to love, even Shepard and Inara.
I:10014;2625;fi fans and all will love this movie.
I:10014;2626;Space, adventure, same amazing characters, action galore!
I:10014;2627;this is a great sci.
I:10014;2628;There are witty lines all through the movie and you do not wait for it to end.
I:10014;2629;It is good that the series is canceled because it is an insult to SciFi genre.
I:10014;2630;muppet Show is more intelligent and fun.
I:10014;2631;It was delivered on time with Express delivery service.
I:10014;2632;Don't make the mistake of thinking Serenity is as good as Firefly, because it isn't.
I:10014;2633;The sometimes magical interaction among those involved gets tarnished, somehow.
I:10014;2634;Maybe it's the sense of betrayal that causes the dynamic to shift, ever so slightly.
I:10014;2635;If Firefly transcended itself to art, then Serenity is it's perfect foil.
I:10014;2636;This movie was an amazing medley of sci.
I:10014;2637;The director put together an amazing storyline, put together with great visual effects, and brilliantly brought out the characters.
I:10014;2638;This movie will keep you up long past your bed time, and will entertain your entire family, again and again.
I:10014;2639;Beautiful case and some interesting extras.
I:10014;2640;This movie has many fun twists and turns, great action in space and on the ground.
I:10014;2641;The visuals are spectacular as well.
I:10014;2642;we can wish the show would come back, but they quit while they were ahead and blew our minds with a fabulous finale.
I:10014;2643;hOT AS A WHOREHOUSE ON NICKEL NIGHT: Terrific dialogue rendered in a wickedly engaging lexical mixture of American West / Mandarin / semi.
I:10014;2644;actually drive the plot rather than the innocuously interchangeable folk we see in today's tv/film.
I:10014;2645;`Serenity' is a rodeo ride of adrenal action, bucking emotional intensity, jolting plot.
I:10014;2646;Did I mention absolutely perfect casting?
I:10014;2647;a most excellent Christmas gift for the deserving.)
I:10014;2648;Thanks for the inspiration Joss!
I:10014;2649;I don't consider myself a SciFi fanatic but this show is great.
I:10014;2650;"The series should be on Tv again
I:10014;2651;This is a fantastic movie that should not be missed.
I:10014;2652;All of the acting is superb.
I:10014;2653;The characters are great, and the plot is quite catching.
I:10014;2654;And if you're like me, this movie will convert you into a fan.
I:10014;2655;this film is probably the best I have seen since Lord of the Rings, and I've a feeling that it will be the best I see for many years.
I:10014;2656;The dialogue between characters is sometimes unsophisticated, but always amusing.
I:10014;2657;The villains are frightening and the heroes are the most entertaining set of rogues since The Matrix.
I:10014;2658;The underlying theme of freedom is one I identify with very strongly, and despite the film's setting of outer space, the crew of the good ship Serenity is a distinctly.
I:10014;2659;explored concept to be sure, but Serenity does it with a perfectly conceived balance of poise and guts.
I:10014;2660;Simply put, this film has given me hope for the soul of American entertainment.
I:10014;2661;One of the best science fiction movies ever made.
I:10014;2662;Even if you didn't see the TV series the movie holds together very well, the characters are memorable, and the story line is intriguing.
I:10014;2663;It takes place in the future, on undiscovered worlds and it takes place in space, any of which qualify it as science fiction.
I:10014;2664;This however is intelligent science fiction with great character development so those who have been mired in the putrid swamp where a great deal of science fiction rests, may not recognize good science fiction.
I:10014;2665;Since the time of Star Wars, or maybe even before, we have seen and enjoyed the western set in outer space or through science fiction.
I:10014;2666;And we've seen the darker side of the myth of the clich riddled western hero bring home the best picture Oscar for Unforgiven.
I:10014;2667;Serenity is a nice addition to this new style of western hero.
I:10014;2668;Something got to give, and not everyone is happy with the choice.
I:10014;2669;i saw the film before I saw the series, and enjoyed it thoroughly.
I:10014;2670;But the character development that's added in the series makes the movie great.
I:10014;2671;i simply can't recommend it enough, and I hope to see Nathan Fillion in many more movies to come.
I:10014;2672;This movie is a classic.
I:10014;2673;Cut down in its prime, Firefly was one of the best sci fi shows on the air.
I:10014;2674;It is, however, a good, fun space western that stands on its own with the sparkling dialogue you have come to expect from Whedon, and the solid performances you have come to expect from the crew.
I:10014;2675;I enjoyed every minute of the movie.
I:10014;2676;The character development is top notch.
I:10014;2677;You fall in love with the characters, they are humanized, brought alive.
I:10014;2678;Naturally it didn't have the budget of Serenity but I found the same emotions and enjoyment.
I:10014;2679;joss Whedon's world of Firefly/Serenity is wonderfully constructed.
I:10014;2680;Lots of action and River is one of a kind.
I:10014;2681;The Cast is funny, the movie is one of the best action films
I:10014;2682;But you can still watch this movie without doing so, I watched this movie before seeing the entire series, but it is better for fans of the show.
I:10014;2683;This editon contains lots of extras fans of the show will love.
I:10014;2684;I can't write as eloquently as others about this movie, but I will say I thoroughly enjoyed my two hours at the theatre watching it.
I:10014;2685;I loved Star Trek, enjoyed Star Wars, but this series surpasses both of them for me.
I:10014;2686;The lives of the characters are just so much more realistic, and yes, there is plenty of action to go along with the story.
I:10014;2687;I wish the best for Joss, he is a creative genius, and I really hope that this isn't the final screen time for the Serenity crew.
I:10014;2688;I feel privileged that I was able to find Serenity.
I:10014;2689;I was one of those gorram people that did not expect much but now I stand happily corrected.
I:10014;2690;Its a series with a 8 grade in imdb and a B+ in yahoo movies and #5 on rotten tomatoes 50 best tv inspired movies.
I:10014;2691;You wont just be entertained but you will feel like you found a new bunch of friends.
I:10014;2692;If you liked the series and movie please recommend it to all your friends.
I:10014;2693;Lets make a sequel possible.
I:10014;2694;Great sequel to the Firefly series and hope there will be more!
I:10014;2695;Yes, but seeing the series first makes the movie even better.
I:10014;2696;Firefly takes place prior to Serenity, and sets up the entire premise for the movie.
I:10014;2697;Thank god for Serenity, giving an already amazing story closure, along with beautiful special effects, all the original cast of Firefly, definately pick this one up, but only after you pick up the Firefly series!!!!
I:10014;2698;This movie is a great movie, of course you do have to see the series Firefly to really understand the movie's storyline but if you don't its okay the movie tells you what you need to know
I:10014;2699;Overall, this movie is good, but not great.
I:10014;2700;The first two episodes were incredibly well done.
I:10014;2701;if you liked the series, the movie is worth a watch.
I:10014;2702;serenity, on the other hand is everything that Firefly should have been.
I:10014;2703;The movie did more things right than the series.
I:10014;2704;It told the audience just enough to understand and follow it.
I:10014;2705;It did not waste time with being clever and told a compelling story.
I:10014;2706;The science fiction audience is a lot smarter than Whedon gave us credit for and would have accepted a lot with the just go with it explanation.
I:10014;2707;what's even more infuriating is that Whedon's squandered a chance to make Firefly good by doing what he did with Buffy and Angel.
I:10014;2708;That's the difference between good writers and Whedon.
I:10014;2709;This is a great movie!!
I:10014;2710;Firefly fans will already have this movie and it is a great follow up to give us all one more taste of Serenity and its crew.
I:10014;2711;Funny, I don't remember the Mule/Reaver skiff chase scene being 1/8th as loud as the pod race in Star Wars Episode 1 .
I:10014;2712;I believe that the strength of the first three Star Wars movies is in the characters .
I:10014;2713;adventure movie without a believeable, three.
I:10014;2714;Serenity does deliver on this.
I:10014;2715;"The ""making of"" material is very interesting and provides some insights into how one can make a good movie on a small budget."
I:10014;2716;Most of the time he describes how craft of movie.
I:10014;2717;making is done through detailed planning and how sometimes it's just plain dumb, quirky luck.
I:10014;2718;so we'll just keep re.
I:10014;2719;So all that being said, I liked it since it was a chance to see old friends (maybe one last time).
I:10014;2720;I'm not going to go deep into plot points or how great the story is, how truly involving and exciting the action sequences are, how sublime the performances are, how masterful the dialogue is.
I:10014;2721;He has done more to make me cry man.
I:10014;2722;tears than any other genre creator has ever done.
I:10014;2723;That being said, you can watch this movie and still get a kick out of it without watching the television show, but I would recommend watching the first season if you've got a lot of time on your hands.
I:10014;2724;star show that got cancelled well before its prime.
I:10014;2725;And it did quite well (better than anybody expected) at the box office which goes to show that the series should have had a few more years in it.
I:10014;2726;It was nice to see Firefly upgraded with a more decent budget for the special effects.
I:10014;2727;Only the greatest movie ever created, in or out of the science fiction genre.
I:10014;2728;Phenomenal casting, music, and story.
I:10014;2729;up to arguably the best television show in existence.
I:10014;2730;I just wanted to say how excellent this movie is.
I:10014;2731;HIGHLY recommend this blueray version.
I:10014;2732;I read that the fans resurrected the show and then I saw the movie and I knew what that means.
I:10014;2733;I loved the series, but since it was cancelled, it ends abruptly.
I:10014;2734;The movie wraps things up nicely.
I:10014;2735;The movie goes into more depth on a few things and brings the story to a close.
I:10014;2736;My first thought on leaving the theater last night was, man I have to see that again!
I:10014;2737;Kaylee gets the two best lines of the movie, River kicks butt, and there is plenty of action.
I:10014;2738;The item shipped quickly and it had nice packaging and the special features are all interesting if you like delving into the background of movies.
I:10014;2739;The dialogue is smart and snappy.
I:10014;2740;The plot is involving, the characters endearing.
I:10014;2741;I really liked the series (Firefly).
I:10014;2742;Thanks for finally bringing the Big Damn Movie to this format!
I:10014;2743;This movie is arguably Joss Whedon's best work.
I:10014;2744;The characters are great and the drama and humour are mixed with a skill that Hollywood usually cannot manage.
I:10014;2745;Joss gives us tough guys and mercenaries and rebel geniuses and space battles and air battles and brawls and assassins and hackers and love and tragedy and humour and rebellion lost causes and lots more.
I:10014;2746;"represented on most ""best films of the decade"" lists."
I:10014;2747;Not if you think great film is always high art.
I:10014;2748;it tells an exciting and interesting story, it builds suspense, it makes you care about the characters, it leaves you drained and satisfied at the end.
I:10014;2749;If Serenity isn't Great Art, it is superlative entertainment.
I:10014;2750;It is, however, witty, brisk, and effective.
I:10014;2751;The acting isn't brilliant, but the actors enjoy what they're doing and imbue their characters with believable humanity in over.
I:10014;2752;The story is the point, and the story is a very, very good one.
I:10014;2753;And it's told very, very well.
I:10014;2754;It's a testament to the creative skill of the director and writer that we know that and are kept at the edges of our seats anyway.
I:10014;2755;This is space opera as it should be, sci fi at its very best.
I:10014;2756;It's a great way to spend a rainy afternoon.
I:10014;2757;If you don't like sci fi but you like a good story, take a gamble .
I:10014;2758;there's a good chance you'll like this movie.
I:10014;2759;A good story transcends genre, and this is a good story.
I:10014;2760;Saw the movie before I saw the series, but by far, loved the movie more.
I:10014;2761;I haven't gotten to see any of the extras but I'll bet they are just as great as the movie.
I:10014;2762;One of my all time favorite movies from one of my all time favorite shows!
I:10014;2763;I ordered it this time for a fathers day present.
I:10014;2764;This movie is so much fun to watch.
I:10014;2765;I will now enjoy it in high definition for years to come.
I:10014;2766;Fun with Adventure and excitement To!
I:10014;2767;I liked it alot, it kept moving, had some action, and a human side as well, and didn't rely on technobabble.
I:10014;2768;The actors were great, and the script was a plus.
I:10014;2769;Fantastic movie that followed a wonderful sci.
I:10014;2770;as others have said, 'Serenity' transcends genre and is an emotional, visual and operatic treat.
I:10014;2771;A rare and unique gem in sci.
I:10014;2772;Collector's edition has a nice enclosure, some great extras and scenes, including some interviews.
I:10014;2773;Overall, a fun movie with great characters that you will watch again and again.
I:10014;2774;ray is top notch and leaps off the screen.
I:10014;2775;Great fun popcorn flick, even if you are not familiar with the series.
I:10014;2776;"fu"" (term coined in a critic's review) is great to watch."
I:10014;2777;It has humor and action and poignancy, and will have you rooting for the little guys going up against the big bad corp.
I:10014;2778;I LOVE the serenity crew and hope to see more stories in the future (even if they are on tv).
I:10014;2779;It was however visually interesting.
I:10014;2780;What a perfect ending, and comeuppance, for a great show that ended before it's time.
I:10014;2781;A great follow up to the series.
I:10014;2782;part of the strength of the series) and even the spaceship Firefly is finally smashed to pieces.
I:10014;2783;Watch the entire series of Firefly (only 14 eps) first to be able to enjoy it the most.
I:10014;2784;It pulled together the only season of Firefly which is one the best shows I've ever watched!
I:10014;2785;There's an amazing shot in the beginning that steadycams through the guts of the ship and introduces you to almost the entire crew and the layout of the ship.
I:10014;2786;A must see if you're a fan of Firefly, but it is also a stand.
I:10014;2787;The characters are so real, and flawed, and heroic, and sometimes just plain funny.
I:10014;2788;Some scenes take my breath away.
I:10014;2789;"We love the series ""Firefly"" and loved ""Serenity"" as well!"
I:10014;2790;"I am a late comer to the firefly fan group, but having watched the movie and season one which is the first and last season of the show
I:10014;2791;"The depth of the characters and back stories was exceptional and the ""moral"" of the story, if you will, rivaled the star trek series."
I:10014;2792;That should make you a fan as well.
I:10014;2793;"After falling in love with the FIREFLY series and cast, I was thrilled to discover a ""sequel"" movie."
I:10014;2794;It was like a delicious and deserved reward for fans who hated to see the series gone.
I:10014;2795;It's a good edition to anybody's FIREFLY collection.
I:10014;2796;A really great movie that should have been a better tv series had it not been hobbled from the beginning,
I:10014;2797;Firefly was a great show (hate it was cancelled) and this is a great movie!
I:10014;2798;Jose Whedon is a master story teller.
I:10014;2799;This is a brilliant film that blends genres together in a masterful and often surprising fashion.
I:10014;2800;I enjoyed this film more than any sci.
I:10014;2801;but this is definitely one of the few.
I:10014;2802;This is a follow up movie to the short lived, but deeply loved television series Firefly.
I:10014;2803;Odd mix of characters, and style, but this movie is great.
I:10014;2804;this film is well done and as witty and clever as the original show.
I:10014;2805;All your favorite characters are present and it wraps the story up very nicely.
I:10014;2806;***This Review Has NO Spoilers***I love the series and I went on opening night to see this.
I:10014;2807;The whole time I was thinking this is one of the most perfect films I've ever seen.
I:10014;2808;Oh yeah, if you are a fan of the series and if you know the characters, trust me.you will cry your eyes out.
I:10014;2809;fi movies, but that she loved it!
I:10014;2810;This really is one of the best movies of 2005, and almost every critic in the country loved it (including my wife).
I:10014;2811;It has a great plot, really solid acting from a fine ensemble cast, and the special effects were well done.
I:10014;2812;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:10014;2813;The movie is excellent, well worth getting.
I:10014;2814;The new edition has new commentary and some additional special features that a hardcore fan will appreciate.
I:10014;2815;track, but funny enough I loved every second of this film to bits.
I:10014;2816;fiction movies this is your cup of tea or if you don't, give it a watch I think you could find it to be surprisingly good.
I:10014;2817;the future is worth fighting for.
I:10014;2818;I loved the TV series too.
I:10014;2819;This movie single handedly got me hooked on the entire Firefly/Serenity universe.
I:10014;2820;Serenity does an excellent job as a stand alone film, there is no need to see the series first or have any background info before going into the movie.
I:10014;2821;You will get all the info you need to enjoy the film in the first few minutes of the movie.
I:10014;2822;I would rate this movie as one of my favorites!
I:10014;2823;Joss Whedon is the Avenger of effective storytelling.
I:10014;2824;"serenity is like a Firefly in the dark
I:10014;2825;"I watched the first half an hour and thought to myself what a bad straight from UPN (or WB, whatever network ""Firefly"" was on) but thankfully it got a lot better once the action really started."
I:10014;2826;"While the dialogue throughout ""Serenity"" was cheesy and comedic (Captain Malcolm Reynolds reminded me of the captain prince hero from Mel Brooks' ""Space Balls""), the action was great and the storyline was compelling."
I:10014;2827;Well, I'm happy to report that not only do you not need to have seen the series to follow this, but you're going to have a real good time watching this.
I:10014;2828;It is really done well, strong action and acting with some perfectly timed comedic touches.
I:10014;2829;I'm sure she had some training and a stunt double, but even if that means she only performed half of the stunts, it's still pretty impressive.
I:10014;2830;He too is very solid, both charming and intense when need be.
I:10014;2831;Another fine performance comes from Chiwetel Ejiofor, he plays the main bad guy from The Alliance, a group that wants the powerfull River all to themselves, but can't seem to catch up with Reynolds and his crew who River and her brother are flying with.
I:10014;2832;the rest of Reynolds crew are all very good, including Adam Baldwin, who plays Jayne, and some of his back.
I:10014;2833;forth with Reynolds is priceless.
I:10014;2834;Also, the movie looks great, no grain, great sound, outstanding sets and locations, and the battle scenes between the spaceships does rival some of the best Star Wars endings.
I:10014;2835;fi's anymore, but it was real refreshing to not only see one, but a good one at that.
I:10014;2836;while I was sad there were no more seasons of Firefly, I thought Serenity did a great job of explaining who the characters were, what had already happened to them, and why.
I:10014;2837;The ending was very good, except for one character's death that I still don't know why they chose to do it that way!
I:10014;2838;anyway, if you're a firefly fan, you will enjoy.
I:10014;2839;This movie is an exceptional extension of the television series Firefly.
I:10014;2840;Seriously, I absolutely love this film.
I:10014;2841;Watching the film actually intrigued me enough so I ended up purchasing the series.
I:10014;2842;I know I watched it backwards, but I still loved it all together.
I:10014;2843;The whole series was a great ride!
I:10014;2844;Loved it, absolutely loved it.
I:10014;2845;And you will also laugh out loud and enjoy this fast paced and visionary tale.
I:10014;2846;Now please , please, please make more movies with the crew.
I:10014;2847;Anyone that watched and enjoyed the Firefly series will Love this movie.
I:10014;2848;It was such a good epilogue movie to the series.
I:10014;2849;It's really too bad that the series had to come to an end, but this movie provides closure for the dedicated fans!
I:10014;2850;"I have to admit that I was never a huge fan of ""Firefly"", but enjoyed the series enough to be excited to see the movie."
I:10014;2851;I watched it with a small group of people and even the ones that had never heard of the TV series enjoyed the movie.
I:10014;2852;The writing was excellent, the actors brought reality to the movie, and I finished it thinking that I needed to go back and watch the TV series over again.
I:10014;2853;Because of this movie I found Firefly.
I:10014;2854;If you liked Firefly, you'll like this movie.
I:10014;2855;This movie is worth watching repeatedly.
I:10014;2856;This movie was worth every penny.
I:10014;2857;It brings depth to the movie to know the motivations of the characters.
I:10014;2858;Outstanding graphics, excellent plot, well defined and diverse characters, and brilliant acting.
I:10014;2859;I love Science fiction,but for the most part only in book form.
I:10014;2860;i believe i can count on one hand the Sci.
I:10014;2861;fi movies I like let alone love.
I:10014;2862;then came Firefly ,I loved it and looked forward to Friday nights while it was on TV.
I:10014;2863;serenity didn't disappoint, it is a great film.
I:10014;2864;it is succeeds completely in every way it attempts to work.
I:10014;2865;Great FX and CGI but only to support terrific performances and dialog not to make the viewer say wow.
I:10014;2866;the viewers do often say wow but because of the script and real ideas not because of eye candy CGI.
I:10014;2867;this is great story telling.
I:10014;2868;this is great film making.
I:10014;2869;encapsulated is an amazing deconstruction of the members of the crew of the Firefly class Ship Serenity.
I:10014;2870;This was a great introduction for me, as I would only later discover that there was an entire series before the events of this movie.
I:10014;2871;The movie is the show, drawn out and with the bells and whistles of holywood magic, but it is the show and these are the characters.
I:10014;2872;It's got humor, it's got space ships, it's got government conspiracies and it's got cowboys and robbers.
I:10014;2873;This movie is a testament to the passionate efforts of the Firefly fanbase.
I:10014;2874;Serenity is a show full of good action, good dialogue, and even good laughs.
I:10014;2875;This movie ended up being one of the best reviewed films of 2005.
I:10014;2876;Watch it and find out why.
I:10014;2877;If you're a fan of the Firefly series, you'll love the movie.
I:10014;2878;Joss Whedon actually improves upon the classic series with better special effects, deeper character development, great action scenes and a top notch science fiction plot.
I:10014;2879;It looks every bit as good, if not better than it did on the big screen.
I:10014;2880;"Putting all that aside though
I:10014;2881;, and good old mature humor.
I:10014;2882;load of big names to be good.
I:10014;2883;on Hollywood messages to be good.
I:10014;2884;what a move needs to be good is what Serenity has to offer.
I:10014;2885;Greats actors and actresses that work well together off screen and on screen.
I:10014;2886;One deep and constant message instead of several messages thrown together.
I:10014;2887;And the desire to make you seek humanity where ever you can find it.
I:10014;2888;"the ""please, God, not another car chase!"
I:10014;2889;I was in the mood for a bit of good SF.
I:10014;2890;I got more than I ever could hope for.
I:10014;2891;The action is great, and the characters are wonderful.
I:10014;2892;After now seeing some of the series, I see that the movie pulls many of the characters in directions fans might not have expected, but it also adds depth to these characters.
I:10014;2893;"Either taken on its own, or in its place in the Firefly ""verse"", this movie is well worth a watch."
I:10014;2894;i set out to watch this movie for an hour or two of entertainment.
I:10014;2895;Serenity is an awesome movie.
I:10014;2896;Firefly is a wonderful character driven sci.
I:10014;2897;fi series and the movie captures the characters beautifully.
I:10014;2898;I guarantee if you watch Firefly and Serenity, you'll be a browncoat for life!
I:10014;2899;wraps up the series nicely.
I:10014;2900;Highly recommend the series and this fantastic movie.
I:10014;2901;Mal is a good man with his own unique code.
I:10014;2902;this is a great film.
I:10014;2903;This is an awesome version!
I:10014;2904;I love the TV show Firefly.
I:10014;2905;It was such a unique take on humanity's future with the combination of space travel, intermixed with the morals of the Old West.
I:10014;2906;it seems to me that science fiction fans (and I am one of them) are very loyal and aware of the history of the characters and the rules of the environment (see Light Sabers in Star Wars).
I:10014;2907;The movie is brilliant, the series was brilliant, and I would give anything for a sequel.
I:10014;2908;Loved the TV Show and the Movie.
I:10014;2909;Excellent character development, back story exploration, and good visual effects.
I:10014;2910;Serenity has the right balance between humor, action, suspense, and villainy!
I:10014;2911;Great movie and a wonderful ending to the Firefly series.
I:10014;2912;day Star Wars is an Injustice to that masterpiece.
I:10014;2913;aside from all of that, there WERE some genuinely entertaining moments throughout the film.
I:10014;2914;Surprisingly funny moments came out of left field on occasion which made the experience much better than it would have otherwise.
I:10014;2915;On the whole, I guess for those who are better acquianted with the movie and how it came to be, this is probably wonderful, and I can see many really enjoying it .
I:10014;2916;As I read the review, I grew more and more excited about seeing the movie.
I:10014;2917;It's rare that new Sci Fi movies have anything close to that winning combination: Serenity is one that does.
I:10014;2918;"in a day and age were most Sci Fi and action movies rely too heaviliy on special effects and CGI ""eye candy,"" Serenity has a great blend of comedy, action, and a very solid and well acted story line that make it a pleasure to watch repeatedly."
I:10014;2919;Of course, because the principles were together for nearly two years, it lends to the solid performances in the movie: All of the characters are very well developed.
I:10014;2920;If you see Serenity, you'll want to get hold of the Firefly series: It's great stuff.
I:10014;2921;I just have to say, biased though it may be, that this is an amazing movie, one of the best I've ever seen.
I:10014;2922;If you see this movie before you see the series, as I did, it doesn't ruin the experience, but it definitely leaves you wanting to know more of the story behind the characters.
I:10014;2923;If you don't get what's going on right away, keep watching and stop questioning.
I:10014;2924;this is an epic sci.
I:10014;2925;fi blockbuster that never got the attention it deserves.
I:10014;2926;If you haven't, part of the fun lies in learning about what motivates them, and their individual idiosyncrasies.
I:10014;2927;Also, the opposition is properly fearsome, and if you stick with the movie and listen to the dialog, very realistically motivated.
I:10014;2928;the action scenes in Serenity are some of the best, and some of the most tightly choerographed that I've ever seen.
I:10014;2929;The fighting styles of the two main protagonists (Mal and River) are completely unique, and both are extremely engaging.
I:10014;2930;Further, the one major space combat scene is particularly engaging.
I:10014;2931;I don't recommend that you do it the way I did.
I:10014;2932;I don't know how much of the series I missed, but I enjoyed the witty mix of genres of Western and Sci Fi adventure.
I:10014;2933;This movie is one of the best movies developed from a TV series I have ever seen.
I:10014;2934;The movie can be enjoyed without seeing the series, but the film does a great job of explaining the background of the series and tying up plot lines.
I:10014;2935;The relationships of the crew members is funny and touching.
I:10014;2936;Some of the captain's conversations about leadership and what it takes to be a ship captain waxes poetic, but in a very good way.
I:10014;2937;The movie is not perfect, but it is the most entertaining Sci Fi movie to come out in several years.
I:10014;2938;The movie did a nice job of both staying true to the concepts of the television series while also extending the story line and filling in some explanations about Summer and about the Reavers.
I:10014;2939;He loved the story, the humor, and the visuals, and I enjoyed all of that once more.
I:10014;2940;It really is a very entertaining movie, with great characters.
I:10014;2941;I still get thrills from watching Summer Glau's amazing martial arts dances, and from some of great dialog in the movie.
I:10014;2942;if you've seen the movie only once, watch it again.
I:10014;2943;"the creator of the popular television show, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" ."
I:10014;2944;"universal Pictures has decided to gamble on ""Serenity"", a feature film version of the show directed by its creator."
I:10014;2945;Mr. Whedon insisted on retaining all of the cast members, and from what I've heard from fans, the film fits well in the program's narrative continuity.
I:10014;2946;Much like her doppleganger Buffy, she has extrodinary fighting abilites, but it's her psychic powers that interest The Alliance the most .
I:10014;2947;make their living by pulling small heists here and there, Butch.
I:10014;2948;He mainly sees River as a sort of living Fuzzbuster, potentially able to warn them of danger.
I:10014;2949;While the dialogue is snappy, the abundance of one.
I:10014;2950;Perhaps due to their premature cancellation, the performers haven't yet developed the vivid personality contrasts that can make an ensemble so much fun.
I:10014;2951;The action sequences are a bit choppy, but they are brisk and have a nice sense of scale to them without being overwheming.
I:10014;2952;It's good B. movie pulp, with nice pacing and a welcome willingness to put its characters at risk.
I:10014;2953;When it counts the most, the film draws you in and makes you care.
I:10014;2954;"overall, I enjoyed my stay in ""Serenity's"" universe."
I:10014;2955;I watched part of the movie on HBO and got hooked.
I:10014;2956;I love the characters, the plot and the writing.
I:10014;2957;Its great sci fi fiction, produced and directed very well into a tv series and now a movie.
I:10014;2958;The extras on the collectors addition are interesting to view.
I:10014;2959;"Please however don't let her opinion stop you as she still thinks that boring Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan movie ""You've got Mail"" is great cinema."
I:10014;2960;I loved the TV show.
I:10014;2961;It was another awesome Joss Whedon tale, combining elements of the Wild West, The Civil War, and Space Travel.
I:10014;2962;It's the best kept secret in the 'Verse.
I:10014;2963;Serenity is a movie that uses genres as a foundation upon which to build a story about real people, who just happen to be vagabonds on a rusty old spaceship.
I:10014;2964;i've long been a fan of both Star Wars and Star Trek, but Serenity is better than either.
I:10014;2965;The crews squabble a lot, but ultimately pull together for the common good.
I:10014;2966;Star Trek has science fiction, and interesting characters.
I:10014;2967;Star Wars has this plus a nice background mythology and some realistic grittiness.
I:10014;2968;Serenity includes all of the above, plus humor, more grittiness, sex, theft, and really nasty bad guys.
I:10014;2969;The result is a realistic universe that people in this messed up world can relate to.
I:10014;2970;But stay with the language, because it's so worth listening to!
I:10014;2971;A popular phrase in screen.
I:10014;2972;I first remember seeing this concept in The Bourne Identity.
I:10014;2973;Serenity does an even better job because it has an even more interesting motivation for violence, and it juggles multiple action characters.
I:10014;2974;If you've read anything about the history of Serenity you already know that River has some amazing skills.
I:10014;2975;She is also a very attractive young woman.
I:10014;2976;In this case, River's character is so incredibly fascinating that you can't help but focus on her character.
I:10014;2977;She is complex, she invokes sympathy, and she has more dimensions than the average human, let alone movie character.
I:10014;2978;"The shots of planets were extremely beautiful
I:10014;2979;The filmmakers made an excellent decision when they decided to leave most of the disturbing imagery to the audience's imagination.
I:10014;2980;on the other hand, there was another kind of mood change that I liked a lot.
I:10014;2981;Being a mentally unstable psychic, River expresses a lot of her personality inside her own head.
I:10014;2982;In the medium of film, it is easy to go inside someone's head, and Serenity does a marvelous job of it.
I:10014;2983;In Serenity it was always crystal clear to me, and the revelations brought by these psychic journeys helped connect the audience to River and her huge part in the story.
I:10014;2984;serenity is an excellent movie.
I:10014;2985;fiction fan at all, or if you just like great story.
I:10014;2986;telling, you will like it.
I:10014;2987;When I watched Serenity, I had never seen Firefly, but I still loved the movie!
I:10014;2988;i never saw the series but the movie is right in line with classic scifi of the fifties.
I:10014;2989;It is revealed here that she is the product of conditioning, it seems on the world Miranda.
I:10014;2990;So far so good, and for most of the movie, this internal logic is followed.
I:10014;2991;Brought down the movie for me, which otherwise was very good indeed.
I:10014;2992;I loved Joss Whedon from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and thought that Firefly was a wonderful, original show!
I:10014;2993;The writing was top notch!
I:10014;2994;"I was so happy when I found out that they were going to put Firefly on the ""big screen""."
I:10014;2995;It was a great movie and explained so much!
I:10014;2996;I would love a sequel as well!!
I:10014;2997;Part serialized western and part sci.
I:10014;2998;fi adventure and featuring the sharp and witty dialogue that Whedon's fans come to expect.
I:10014;2999;After several successful seasons of producing Buffy and Angel, both very successful shows, you would think the Execs at FOX would give Whedon the creative license to do the show the way he thought it should be done.
I:10014;3000;Alas, the businessmen thought they knew how to create complex entertaining stories and characters more than anyone else.
I:10014;3001;In other words, a balanced character study.
I:10014;3002;But it was critically hailed as a great movie and anyone who saw it seemed to like it as well.
I:10014;3003;It's a great scene, a testament to Joss' Whedon's writing ability to fit fourteen episodes of story into just a few minutes.
I:10014;3004;Taking place 500 years in the future, it centers on River Tam, a brilliant young girl who was manipulated by the government for covert purposes.
I:10014;3005;It's so efficient and so well done, you can't believe you're entertained at the same time.
I:10014;3006;fi adventure that goes, and goes fast.
I:10014;3007;The actors love their characters and to top that off, the dialogue is excellent.
I:10014;3008;With such a balanced crew and cast of characters you get a sense that this is a group of people who may not always like each other, but know they have to work together for something greater.
I:10014;3009;the movie ends in surprising ways, Whedon's way of saying, `Maybe there will be a sequel, maybe there won't.'
I:10014;3010;Serenity is one that really improves with multiple views.
I:10014;3011;THis is my husband's favorite movie of all time.
I:10014;3012;If you haven't seen the series, watch it first so you can fully appreciate the movie.
I:10014;3013;Sad that they didn't continue the series, but a great way to wrap it up if they must.
I:10014;3014;"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie ""wind."
I:10014;3015;Sorry it had to end!
I:10014;3016;Wow, like, what an amazing science fiction masterpiece, huh?
I:10014;3017;Serenity is packed with action and adventure.
I:10014;3018;The background is kind of a cross between Star Trek and Tombstone!!
I:10014;3019;I like Kailee and Wash they are my favorite characters by far.
I:10014;3020;Fun movie that keeps you wanting more!
I:10014;3021;The cover art is, frankly, rather unwelcoming, and it has no big stars to reassure you that there will be *something* that you'll certainly enjoy.
I:10014;3022;This is amazing just on a dramatic level.
I:10014;3023;The acting is powerful, and it has layer upon layer of meaning and emotion as one rewatches.
I:10014;3024;The arc of Malcolm Reynold's character is a beautiful one, from anti.
I:10014;3025;hero to hero, unwillingly, brought by belief and faith in the people he flies with.
I:10014;3026;This is a movie about trust, love and loyalty, a movie whose depth of emotion takes your breath away.
I:10014;3027;There were great special effects and amusing jokes.
I:10014;3028;Serenity is simply a masterpiece and unique!
I:10014;3029;fi, it's more action and definitely a comedy as well!
I:10014;3030;I must admit the story does bog a little over the course of the film, and some of the best characters are killed at the end, but in a film like this you focus on what makes the film so special.
I:10014;3031;And the script was just astounding, that was enough to give this film such a high rating, and is the reason why it is loved so much.
I:10014;3032;The fight scenes and things like that in the film are terrific as well, who would have thought that a film adapted from a TV Series could become so popular, and that a TV director could do such a good job.
I:10014;3033;the cast that was pick for this film done very well, Fillion as Mal was believable as the captain.
I:10014;3034;Other members of the cast like Maher and Torres are great as well!
I:10014;3035;"Whedon is the star of the day
I:10014;3036;This is a highly recommendable film and you must view.
I:10014;3037;This is a great continuation/ending of the TV show .
I:10014;3038;The same cast is back and it's great to see them all together again!
I:10014;3039;The chemistry is still there!
I:10014;3040;"Just head over to the ""Firefly"" Amazon page and see for yourself the great reviews it has on it."
I:10014;3041;I was somewhat hesitant b/c of the great reviews but they are all well deserved (if you are a Sci.
I:10014;3042;If you haven't seen Serenity, Firefly gives you a brief background and history of the crews of Serenity.
I:10014;3043;Serenity has a great plot, good acting and great special effects.
I:10014;3044;Well at least my favorite.
I:10014;3045;The firefly tv series is a excellent addition to continue this movie.
I:10014;3046;Not as good as the show, although if you've loved the show then you should really get the graphic novel.
I:10014;3047;"Brilliant movie, continuing the fantastic Joss Whedon ""Firefly"" series."
I:10014;3048;ray, and the features .
I:10014;3049;picture visual commentary, which is amazing and I'd love to see on other discs .
I:10014;3050;even though i never watched the TV series Firefly, this was still a great movie to watch.
I:10014;3051;First, this is a great film that I've been a big fan of for years.
I:10014;3052;I loved it so much, in fact, that it inspired me to finally check out Firefly, from which it is derived.
I:10014;3053;lol What a great movie!
I:10014;3054;ray experience is even better.
I:10014;3055;I really love the soundtrack during the last ~5 minutes of the film, and it sounded AWESOME on my 5.1 setup.
I:10014;3056;Just like my firefly review, i loved this.
I:10014;3057;This cast was so electric.
I:10014;3058;i heard about this from the Big Bang Theory, thanks to the writers for that tidbit and the hilarious script of that show.
I:10014;3059;it's hard to explain but you will get it when you see it, it's good enough and a must see for real Firefly fans.
I:10014;3060;the Reevers were one of the best things about the show, and getting into their story should have been great.
I:10014;3061;The move from small screen to big screen was done well.
I:10014;3062;Joss Whedon is part of an incredibly talented and creative team.
I:10014;3063;I got this for my Dad for Christmas, got it at a good price and he loves it!
I:10014;3064;I'm so glad I got it!
I:10014;3065;I have always loved the works by Joss Whedon but my favorite all time show was Firefly.
I:10014;3066;Even years later I am still in love with the show as strong as I ever was.
I:10014;3067;My fiance and i borrowed the whole series from a friend, got hooked, and had to see the movie!
I:10014;3068;"Thank you FOX for making sure that so few people knew the wonders of ""Firefly,"" and thank you Joss Whedon and ""Firefly"" fans that made ""Serenity"" come into being."
I:10014;3069;This is a good stand alone science fiction/action movie.
I:10014;3070;"but watch ""Firefly"" beforehand and this film is so much more of a joy to watch."
I:10014;3071;this amazingly beautiful story unfolds with well developed and interesting characters.
I:10014;3072;Joss Whedon is simply the master of creating a unique universe of characters and situations you identify with and yet have never experienced.
I:10014;3073;i became an instant fan of the movie, the comic series and the TV show.
I:10014;3074;Fox never realizes when they have a great show.
I:10014;3075;if you liked the show, I would definitely recommend seeing this movie.
I:10014;3076;It's rare that fans get any type of closure in instances where a show is cancelled mid.
I:10014;3077;Quick delivery and good packaging.
I:10014;3078;Disc is in excellent condition.
I:10014;3079;I got the package on time.
I:10014;3080;This was quite entertaining and they had to make this movie to close the series ends.
I:10014;3081;The acting, the interactions, and the story are amazing.
I:10014;3082;I love commentaries and these are great but all I really care about in this particular case is the movie.
I:10014;3083;it's possibly the best gift I could have received for Yule.
I:10014;3084;The Complete Serieson sale along with Serenity so I picked up both and enjoy them, and my roommates like it, too.
I:10014;3085;I'm a relatively new fan.
I:10014;3086;firefly/Serenity is truly a remarkable project.
I:10014;3087;It is a very smart series.
I:10014;3088;political world affairs and our desire to truly be free as a human race.
I:10014;3089;SOmetimes an author or a creator has a certain responsibility to the characters, the universe, and stories around them that they have created.
I:10014;3090;Firefly/Serenity's universe is just to rich, too great, and too special to be left alone.
I:10014;3091;There is so much more to be done and to be said.
I:10014;3092;This is truly the greatest Sci.
I:10014;3093;fi series/film I have ever had the honor to see and experience.
I:10014;3094;now, don't get me wrong: i love a good fight in any format, when there is some motivation behind it that is worthwhile.
I:10014;3095;This is about humans and how fraile and strong and stupid and brave we are.2.
I:10014;3096;Joss wrote it, it must be good.4.
I:10014;3097;man is real and he is us.
I:10014;3098;they will seepe into your brain and your heart and your very being.
I:10014;3099;And you will love everyone of them, even as you are sitting there cursing their names.
I:10014;3100;This is the expanded edition of the movie based on what might be the best sci.
I:10014;3101;They really did create something special in the series and in this movie.
I:10014;3102;This is a great movie, though you will only fully understand it if you've watche the television series.
I:10014;3103;even with the problems the series had, it was quite enjoyable and kept you entertained from start to finish.
I:10014;3104;The movie is a great wrap.
I:10014;3105;The two really do go hand in hand.
I:10014;3106;This is the movie + special features and upcoming BD Live stuff.
I:10014;3107;Accessing the special features in.
I:10014;3108;movie is great and a part of the format so owning this title on BD is a worthy upgrade for those BrownCoats out there!If you are watching this title for your first time, the BD version is a must if you have the choice.
I:10014;3109;Story often takes a hit when special effects are involved.
I:10014;3110;This is a well structured story with likable characters.
I:10014;3111;Like the original Star Trek, there is a chemistry with the performers that keeps the viewer engaged.
I:10014;3112;The steel case is a lovely touch, not worth double dipping.
I:10014;3113;This movie will live forever as a cult favorite .
I:10014;3114;it has all the elements of action, humor and emotionsbalanced with the effects and actors blending seamlesslyas heros and villans twist the plot at every turnin George Lucas's Star Wars fashion.
I:10014;3115;i will watch this one again and again with the feelingof seeing it for the first time.
I:10014;3116;One of the most amazing films I've seen this year, if not ever.
I:10014;3117;Excellent acting, the story keeps you in the film from start to finish.
I:10014;3118;This is one of those movies that you become part of and completely lose yourself in it.
I:10014;3119;fi and a good action story.
I:10014;3120;It was alot darker than the tv series, but it was good in its own way.
I:10014;3121;"I had not a chance to see the ""Firefly"" television series, but I did enjoy Joss Whedon's interpretation of the X. men comic series and so I thought I'd give this movie a try."
I:10014;3122;"I like Whedon's use of dialogue to build and relieve tension in X. men, and he maintains his ear for good witty dialogue in ""Serenity."""
I:10014;3123;He also does an excellent job of developing what are essentially comic book characters, and making us care about them and so that when this movie reaches its climax our muscles tense up as we root for our heroes to make it against overwhelming odds.
I:10014;3124;After watching the magnificent Sci.
I:10014;3125;"fi series, I wondered if there would be some ""spinoffs"" of the masterpiece, finally I found Serenity, with all the crews back in the film, with even better performance."
I:10014;3126;maybe It's the best farewell to the crew, to the director, to Serenity.
I:10014;3127;I figured it was just a one.
I:10014;3128;improved CGI and general look of the film as compared to the TV series.
I:10014;3129;It felt like it was 4 years worth of series action/reveals jam packed into one film.
I:10014;3130;It was far darker than the series, without the witty reparte that made the series so phenomenal.
I:10014;3131;i loved it, every episode was wonderful.
I:10014;3132;it answers a lot of questions.
I:10014;3133;fi movie I'd rate it as good, not great .
I:10014;3134;Goof film, good acting, good directing!
I:10014;3135;This was a good way to take the Firefly series and partially wrap it up.
I:10014;3136;Family Guy is back on FOX and Firefly creator Joss Whedon brought his vision back to life on the big screen.
I:10014;3137;It's great fun, with smart dialogue and a nice science fiction/western combination.
I:10014;3138;Whedon does a fine job bringing all that to the big screen.
I:10014;3139;The guy can deliver witty lines well but when he has to show off the character's dark self.
I:10014;3140;cenered side he's even better.
I:10014;3141;Adam Baldwin (My Bodyguard, Full Metal Jacket, Angel's last season) is equally good as the unpredictable Jayne.
I:10014;3142;"gina Torres ""who Whedon also used as a powerful villian in Angel season 4"" is great just like she was in the show."
I:10014;3143;She'd follow him anywhere, especially since her husband's the pilot of Serenity.
I:10014;3144;The sexy Summer Glau almost steals the show as River.
I:10014;3145;That was the plot in the show too but it also works in the movie since we never got to learn much about her before the show was canceled.
I:10014;3146;Which helps keep the viewers at the edge of their seats.
I:10014;3147;Also hopefully Joss has a Angel movie planned for us fans who are still mad at WB for canceling it.
I:10014;3148;i know some smart people who love this movie and the tv series.
I:10014;3149;This is an incredible film that takes off where the ill.
I:10014;3150;Many questions are answered from the series.
I:10014;3151;The characters were well developed and fresh.
I:10014;3152;It was one of the best sci.
I:10014;3153;While the offspring of a canceled television show, this movie still remains an entertaining ride for those of us who didn't keep track of it on TV.
I:10014;3154;If you like scifi or action movies, this is an excellent choice.
I:10014;3155;Unique, superbly produced and acted, Serenity is a hugely satisfying follow.
I:10014;3156;I never saw the series before I viewed the film, but like millions of other Serenity fans, I consider this film and the series the finest SF I have ever seen.
I:10014;3157;In every respect, this film is a joy to watch.
I:10014;3158;A must have collection of a wonderful series, cut short after only one season.
I:10014;3159;Great scifi, against a clever backdrop of mid 20th century American TV westerns
I:10014;3160;In short, if you are a fan of the Firefly series, you will love this movie.
I:10014;3161;If you were not a fan or haven't seen it, you will probably still enjoy this movie, even though it helps to know more background on the characters at times.
I:10014;3162;if you love Firefly the series, you must own this movie.
I:10014;3163;The graphics are great and the sound is supurb.
I:10014;3164;I really hope that one day (not too far off) they will bring back the series.
I:10014;3165;Serenity had, at least the best writing, characters, and dialogue of any movie of 2005.
I:10014;3166;And with Joss Whedon's writing, you get humour when totally unexpected.
I:10014;3167;i watched this movie with people who've never seen the series and didn't know anything about it and they loved it as well.
I:10014;3168;The series fills you in on the characters and you can't help but fall in love with them.
I:10014;3169;Firefly is a beautifully written, beautifully produced and even more skillfully delivered story.
I:10014;3170;The themes can be traced back to the most basic human conflicts while at the same time delivering an environment which has never been seen on television or film.
I:10014;3171;It's just another space western is the first instinct but at closer review the audience will realize that the characters spring into life as a fully developed family dealing with social and personal conflicts in each episode.
I:10014;3172;The writing creates a universe where it is a daily chores to fly through space and dock with exotic planets.
I:10014;3173;"At the same time the captain deals with marauding ""space raiders"" and a powerful and controlling central government he must also balance the needs of his crew while they deal with love and jealousy."
I:10014;3174;fi fan and a should see for any student of literature.
I:10014;3175;We have watched it many times, and enjoy just as much as the first time.
I:10014;3176;What makes this movie great is that the characters and the universe are so rich.
I:10014;3177;While you definitely don't have to watch the TV series first, in my opinion, it adds to the experience.
I:10014;3178;She knows a secret that could weaken if not bring down the Alliance which has a firm hold on the central planets.
I:10014;3179;The chemistry between the crew clicks back into gear and all of the great characters make an appearance.
I:10014;3180;There is a lot of action and it is a great story.
I:10014;3181;I think Joss Whedon did some of his best work on this movie.
I:10014;3182;This is truly an exceptional movie following an exceptional show.
I:10014;3183;I truly hope that Joss Whedon somehow finds a way to continue with this project.
I:10014;3184;I love this series's, well written characters, great script and great acting.
I:10014;3185;The TV show is even better!
I:10014;3186;My husband is a HUGE fan of Firefly and the movie Serenity.
I:10014;3187;"He is one of the ""browncoats""."
I:10014;3188;Loved the movie, and he definitely hopes they come out with a new one and continue the story unlike the series that was cancelled.
I:10014;3189;This movie is just as good.
I:10014;3190;I now get the hype and, yes, it's still incredible eight years later.
I:10014;3191;Watch the 14 TV episodes first then Serenity which is a great wrap up of the series.
I:10014;3192;This movie is wonderful, and is really for those who saw the episodes.
I:10014;3193;I was completely satisfied with it after having seen all the TV episodes.
I:10014;3194;Best movie you've never heard of.
I:10014;3195;Sequel to the best TV show (Firefly)you've never heard of.
I:10014;3196;Yes, you'll like (love) it no matter what your age.
I:10014;3197;Yes, your SO, or spouse, will like it.
I:10014;3198;After watching the series I had to have the movie and bought it on Blu.
I:10014;3199;A very nice surprise even if I did come to the party 5 years late.
I:10014;3200;building is detailed and well done.
I:10014;3201;Lots of memorable scenes and lines.
I:10014;3202;when they reopen, it is one of the great still shots of any movie.
I:10014;3203;It certainly is a top ten SF movie.
I:10014;3204;If you're a SF fan, you'll enjoy it.
I:10014;3205;The best way to enjoy this movie is to watch Firefly first and then the movie.
I:10014;3206;I loved every second of this movie.
I:10014;3207;I loved the series so much that I had to watch the movie.
I:10014;3208;follows along with the series, sums everything up, from the series, and delivers action packed adventure most si.
I:10014;3209;It really made use of our sound system.
I:10014;3210;the picture was awesome, there was so much detail to take in, breath taking.
I:10014;3211;Really as good as watching it in the theater, and as enjoyable.
I:10014;3212;If you were a Firefly fan you'll be pleased to see the same characters in the movie.
I:10014;3213;Lots of action and a decent story line you'll not be bored.
I:10014;3214;and it continues to deliver.
I:10014;3215;This is an awesome Rag Tag adventure group, in a great movie.
I:10014;3216;Great ending to the series.
I:10014;3217;Really enjoyed this movie !
I:10014;3218;great action and story line.
I:10014;3219;A fine old fashioned sci.
I:10014;3220;i never saw the show firefly, which i am ashamed to admit, but i found this movie to be absolutely amazing.
I:10014;3221;i have watched it multiple times, and each time i notice something that i didn't notice before.
I:10014;3222;Even the villain of the film, the Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor)believes that what he is doing is for the greater good, and Malcom learns he has more in common with him than he'd like.
I:10014;3223;the cast members give likeable to great performances, particularly Fillion as Reynolds and Glau as River.
I:10014;3224;All in all, it is as satisfying a conclusion that we will ever get to the Firefly universe.
I:10014;3225;This is a great Sci.
I:10014;3226;"the Wild West in outer space
I:10014;3227;uLTRA plotline, with torturous mind.
I:10014;3228;Truthteller Alex Jones of Infowars radio reported he enjoyed this movie, perhaps because he has interviewed so many real characters who lived that portion of Serenity's plot.
I:10014;3229;I originally saw this movie in theater and the audience response was amazing.
I:10014;3230;People clearly loved this movie.
I:10014;3231;Besides the love of those first three star wars movies I have never experienced such love and energy for a movie.
I:10014;3232;This was a great series that got no support.
I:10014;3233;But you can enjoy it again by ordering the set of the only partial season of episodes.
I:10014;3234;There are definitely some surprises in the plot.
I:10014;3235;as to the theatrical value of the movie, tastes vary but it followed along the lines of the TV series (Firefly) so if you enjoy that you will probably enjoy the movie .
I:10014;3236;I'll probably watch again and have the digital copy on my tablet in case I'm on a trip and need a good diversion.
I:10014;3237;instead, this turned out to be one of the most pleasant surprises in a while.
I:10014;3238;They managed to convey the essentials of the characters and plot very early on, and the humor was fully enjoyable.
I:10014;3239;best of all was the INTELLIGENCE of the characters.
I:10014;3240;This was such a refreshing change .
I:10014;3241;everyone in the movie was smart, and surprises to the characters were surprises to the viewer as well.
I:10014;3242;I'll be sure to look for more from the creators in the future.
I:10014;3243;Good movie, seemed to be new as indicated at time of sale, shipping time was quick.
I:10014;3244;Shootouts and fistfights, all the ingrediants for a good action movie, plus a good story.
I:10014;3245;Watch an enjoy for this is probably the last time we will get to view this reality.
I:10014;3246;Every Firefly fan should own this movie.
I:10014;3247;I watch it at least once a year.
I:10014;3248;I loved the firefly series.
I:10014;3249;We loved the series Firefly with Nathan Fillion and Summer Glau.
I:10014;3250;This movie ties everything together very well and without making you guess what's happened to the crew.
I:10014;3251;It's an outstanding movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction!
I:10014;3252;One great thing about the show was that most of the episodes were nicely self.
I:10014;3253;I've read some of the other reviews both positive and negative on here.
I:10014;3254;Serenity is more than just a sci.
I:10014;3255;The characters have depth and while the movie is only two hours compared to the Firefly series where the characters had more time to be revealed it still does a fine job.
I:10014;3256;The action sequences are fast moving and the plot is strong.
I:10014;3257;the movie is extremely good and well worth watching.
I:10014;3258;if you are looking for a good movie that will stay with you longer than the butter on your fingers from your microwave popcorn, check out Serenity.
I:10014;3259;Serenity is the best part.
I:10014;3260;I loved the movie i love new features on this 2 disc edition i really loved the cast commentary and the few new extended scenes.
I:10014;3261;"So many times (Surface and those other 2 weak SciFi shows last year or so) they just end the series and the actors go off to other shows, so this was a nice change of pace
I:10014;3262;"I fell in love with the expertly drawn characters and snappy dialogue of ""Firefly"" when it belately appeared on the SciFi Cable channel."
I:10014;3263;offs with my kids .
I:10014;3264;Every show was smart, thought.
I:10014;3265;provoking, and better the second time around.
I:10014;3266;The attention to detail in both the set and the character performances surpassed anything in its genre.
I:10014;3267;"Captain Reynold's unabashed love for his ship, wonderfully revealed in ""Out of Gas,"" made the closing scene in ""Serenity,"" the movie, particularly satisfying and memorable."
I:10014;3268;"for those who crave smart science fiction, both ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" are rich treasures to mine time and again."
I:10014;3269;"But for the time and budget he did have, Whedon did an admirable job that well rewarded his ""Firefly"" fans."
I:10014;3270;since the movie lacked time for the clever nuances of character and humor that richly graced the series, I fear the wonderful character of Kaylee may have came off to the uninitiated as little more than a bitter whiner.
I:10014;3271;Not only did he destroy one of the most interesting couples relationships ever portrayed on screen, he deprived future stories of Wash's folksie warmth .
I:10014;3272;"And Ron Glass's ""Shepherd Book"" certainly deserved a longer shelf life."
I:10014;3273;one that reflects the same attention to detail as the first, that fills in the timeline between the last show and the movie.
I:10014;3274;"That being said, I watched Serenity"" twice the weekend it opened and again the following weekend."
I:10014;3275;Wish it had done better at the box office.
I:10014;3276;Watch the series, then see the film.
I:10014;3277;It's got something for everyone, except little kids.
I:10014;3278;Serenity is one of the most enjoyable genre movies I've seen in a while: exciting, original, funny (very, VERY funny), yet very believable and HUMAN.
I:10014;3279;A great action movie that did not forget it was about people.
I:10014;3280;I'm a fan of Firefly and Serenity, both.
I:10014;3281;Serinity has shown the public what die hard Joss Whedon fans have known for years: the man is a genius when it comes to characterization, story, and outright excitement.
I:10014;3282;He sets the bar higher for all of us writers.
I:10014;3283;He has shown how truly outstanding movies and television can be.
I:10014;3284;Returning to these very three dimensional characters was of course exciting.
I:10014;3285;One thing that truly impressed me was how the movie was written to be easily understood by newcomers to the verse, and to offer so much to existing fans.
I:10014;3286;the best movie ever made.
I:10014;3287;the writing is stellar and the acting sublime, the directing is top.
I:10014;3288;notch (naturally) and the plot pure genius.
I:10014;3289;they are entirely original, entirely new.
I:10014;3290;The many plot twists are novel, and will catch you off your guard.
I:10014;3291;Even the action sequences are original .
I:10014;3292;most of all, however, Serenity is pure fun from start to finish.
I:10014;3293;Rather, it is a moviegoer's movie, like a fun old western with actual (amazing) plot and dynamic, round characters.
I:10014;3294;"Thank god for ""Serenity,"" because it nicely wraps up most of the questions that were left hanging when the series that spawned it, ""Firefly,"" was abruptly canceled."
I:10014;3295;"In an extremely tight storyline, the ""Firefly"" story wraps up nicely, and the loose ends left are either intentionally left that way for effect or are relatively minor."
I:10014;3296;"that is also the greatest weakness of ""Serenity"" ."
I:10014;3297;"The main villain, who wields a sword (anachronistic but cool), seems kind of tossed in at the last minute, and though he fleshes out nicely at the end, I can't shake the feeling that he was somehow fake (and strikingly similar to the villain from the final episode of ""Firefly"")."
I:10014;3298;You'll find great action sequences, an intriguing plot, a cast who obviously loves their characters, and wonderfully original dialogue (I'm looking at *you* George Lucas).
I:10014;3299;Serenity is one of those movies that transcends the genre, like The Matrix.
I:10014;3300;fi, you'll find something to love in Serenity.
I:10014;3301;What I'm saying is that the show is incredible (although give it until about episode 8.
I:10014;3302;True love will set in.
I:10014;3303;It has one of the most compelling villians I've seen in a sci.
I:10014;3304;The cast is largely unknown, and I think that helps the movie because you don't have any preconceived notions about the actors.
I:10014;3305;The world is an original mash.
I:10014;3306;up of American and Chinese culture, with a bit of the wild west thrown in for good measure.
I:10014;3307;fi standards, is filled with little detailed touches of brilliance you haven't seen in a sci.
I:10014;3308;I love the dialogue in this movie.
I:10014;3309;It's witty and natural and funny as hell.
I:10014;3310;We're always happy to have another Browncoat.
I:10014;3311;The movie is very good, just like the TV show Firefly.
I:10014;3312;"I still recommend it, though
I:10014;3313;I love the series, so Serenity was a must for me.
I:10014;3314;It's in my top five!
I:10014;3315;Packaging was good too and it arrived on time!
I:10014;3316;You will enjoy it more that way.
I:10014;3317;the story line is about a spaceship full of interesting characters squeaking past the law, trying to live free and do the right thing whenever possible.
I:10014;3318;one would think the blend would simply not work, but it does work, and it works unbelievably well.
I:10014;3319;The characters draw you in instantly, and hold your attention through the entire series and movie, leaving you wanting more.
I:10014;3320;the recent movie about Hughes is also great.)
I:10014;3321;It will make you laugh and cry, be happy and angry, leaving you feel very much a part of the lives of the characters.
I:10014;3322;I am also going to keep an eye out for the actors in other projects, as they are all great as well.
I:10014;3323;This movie really ought to be packaged together with the series, and I would love to see a boxed set with both, and some new featurettes.
I:10014;3324;The extras included with the movie and the Firefly series are also interesting and leave you wanting more.
I:10014;3325;It basically wraps the show up and is very well done.
I:10014;3326;For a fraction of the budget Joss Whedon has created a thoughtful and engaging space cowboy saga, I have not seen a film this suprising and fun in years and strongly urge anyone with a thirst for good science fiction to give this a try.
I:10014;3327;"Joss Whedon's ""Serenity"" is a wonderfully entertaining science fiction adventure that will fly by as you're watching it."
I:10014;3328;Like all great SF movies, the action and special effects serve the story and the characters, not the other way around.
I:10014;3329;There are terrific chases, space battles, and confrontations, as well as all kinds of other surprises.
I:10014;3330;those surprises, by the way, include some very clever revelations about the mysteries introduced in the short.
I:10014;3331;there's a painless and even clever re.
I:10014;3332;But be warned, that added impact won't always be of the happy variety, as Mr. Whedon believes that in order to generate genuine tension in a danger.
I:10014;3333;That's all I'll say on that score.
I:10014;3334;"Well, I'll also say this: As well as directing the movie, ""Serenity"" was also written by Joss Whedon, so you know you'll be getting some funny stuff here, too."
I:10014;3335;The world of firefly/serenity is unique and wonderful !!!
I:10014;3336;I took a chance without knowing much but the preview, and I loved it,Great storyline, funny and crazy dialogue I laughed.
I:10014;3337;This was the conclusion for the series and it was really good!
I:10014;3338;It was exciting and kept you on the edge of your seat!
I:10014;3339;This movie got me hooked on the show Firefly.
I:10014;3340;Many will have seen the show already, but its a really well done movie, lots of action, fun space, sci.
I:10014;3341;If you're into that, you'll dig the movie.
I:10014;3342;Even if your a not a fan of science fiction you will love this movie.
I:10014;3343;It is the movie based on my favorite television show of all time.
I:10014;3344;Bought this for my girlfriend she loves this show.
I:10014;3345;It arrived suprisingly fast and she loves it.
I:10014;3346;i enjoy watching it alot.
I:10014;3347;they've played the noble villains enough times, true.
I:10014;3348;They've rescued each other time and time again, out of love and loyalty.
I:10014;3349;this movie throws them in the center of something too big for themselves, but in that center they find a cause so worth fighting for, they willingly put themselves and their loved ones on the line for it.
I:10014;3350;It's for that bravery, that selflessness, that they all transcend into heroes.
I:10014;3351;Of course, such a journey is bittersweet.
I:10014;3352;First of all, I must start by explaining that I absolutely love the Firefly TV series.
I:10014;3353;The series is a truly creative concept with a cast and crew that feel as human as we are.
I:10014;3354;strong and seems to care a lot less about his crew.
I:10014;3355;Yes, if only to see that one last journey with the crew of Serenity, but do so with a forgiving eye.
I:10014;3356;Serenity is what going to the movies, in the classic sense, is all about.
I:10014;3357;It's a popcorn flick with brains and you can't ask for much more than that.
I:10014;3358;The classic and strong storytelling elements devolved into an empty shell of its former self.
I:10014;3359;adventure, humor, tragedy, heroics, and conflict.
I:10014;3360;Translation: Interesting characters who drag you, the viewer, through a lot of great stuff with some shocking surprises.
I:10014;3361;give this movie a chance, pay to see it, and tell your friends.
I:10014;3362;Great job closing out the series.
I:10014;3363;Serenity answers many of the questions that have plagued fans since the show met its untimely end, and provides a hopeful and energizing send.
I:10014;3364;off to a wonderful group of characters.
I:10014;3365;Otherwise, the packaging is pretty cool, and the extra features are highly entertaining to watch after the fact.
I:10014;3366;collector's edition and I my preference is this version.
I:10014;3367;If you like space ships and awesomeness, you'll have a blast.
I:10014;3368;The action is fresh and exciting.
I:10014;3369;The twists are genuinely shocking.
I:10014;3370;liners will actually make you laugh!
I:10014;3371;In Serenity, the characters are charming and cool, but also behave like real people, which is so so rare in a blow.
I:10014;3372;"They called it ""The Year's Best Underrated Movie."""
I:10014;3373;I know that's high praise, but there it is.
I:10014;3374;I didn't expect to love Serenity, but I absolutely did.
I:10014;3375;I love this group of actors and the whole premise of this story.
I:10014;3376;Fantastic movie on the heels of a great (unfortunately short) series . . . one or more surprises for me.
I:10014;3377;Firefly could have gone on for many more hilarious, heartwarming, and action.
I:10014;3378;So when I found out about this movie, my heart sang.
I:10014;3379;This is an incredible film.
I:10014;3380;You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll need an antacid.
I:10014;3381;I highly recommend watching the Firefly series before enjoying this movie.
I:10014;3382;Very action packed and a great spin off of firefly.
I:10014;3383;Great story line and good acting.
I:10014;3384;Great movie to add to any collection.
I:10014;3385;I was impressed with the show.
I:10014;3386;This movie wether familiar with the series or not was a spectacular end to what could have been an even better story.
I:10014;3387;This was a great movie.
I:10014;3388;I saw the movie on the big screen and was impressed by its' originality, characters (like real people with flaws and unique senses of humor), special effects .
I:10014;3389;This is possibly the best sci.
I:10014;3390;I know that the above statement is a rather bold claim, and one that's been made many times over.
I:10014;3391;Then I heard that they were making a movie based on the T. v. show, and it got me interested enough to give the show a try through Netflix.
I:10014;3392;Let me tell you now: Firefly is the best television show I've ever seen.
I:10014;3393;The writing is darn near perfect, as is the acting.
I:10014;3394;The storytelling is just so well done, and Joss carried that over and stepped it up a notch with Serenity.
I:10014;3395;In my opinion, he accomplished that goal.
I:10014;3396;Lets put it this way: As huge a Star Wars fan (and comic nerd for that matter) as I am, Serenity is the best movie I've seen all year.
I:10014;3397;This film gives us what we, as fans, really want.
I:10014;3398;It also is a really good film.
I:10014;3399;and they loved it as well!Own This Movie.
I:10014;3400;Serenity is a fast moving, interesting movie incorporating the characters of the series Firefly .
I:10014;3401;This movie answers all the questions from the series in a believable and entertaining manner.
I:10014;3402;Some of the best writing and dialogue I've seen in a Sci.
I:10014;3403;having said all of that, Serenity is fabulous!
I:10014;3404;It really is a shame that Fox has cancelled another great series because this really is a great world Joss Whedon has created, and with his talent, the show was only to get better.
I:10014;3405;(Note: I'm also a huge fan of Whedon's work in comics.
I:10014;3406;He deserves props for his work on Astonishing X. men which earned him an Eisner award this year, which is proof of his excellent story telling.)
I:10014;3407;Judged on its own merits, Serenity is a pretty.
I:10014;3408;it was just a good, exciting story with good characters, exciting fight scenes, and snappy dialogue
I:10014;3409;Watching the series first WILL increase your enjoyment of Serenity.
I:10014;3410;I didn't really go to this movie with an open mind, but it was fantastic.
I:10014;3411;The movie was engaging from the first moments.
I:10014;3412;This movie has a great story, acting, and cast.
I:10014;3413;I'm sure there'd be much more subtext to many parts of the film but it stands fairly well on its own.
I:10014;3414;"handed compliment by saying, ""Even though I knew virtually nobody from the movie ."
I:10014;3415;"This mindset (""Even though they weren't overused famous people, they did alright"") is at the heart of why good movies rarely get made and also why you see the same 15 actors in every major studio release."
I:10014;3416;The story in this movie is so original, and yet something we can all relate to.
I:10014;3417;"A body of people, who for ""our own good"" create a society, where as long as we think and act as one, everyone will be fine."
I:10014;3418;By far my favorite sci fi story, period.
I:10014;3419;fi, part action/adventure, part western, part comedy, part romance/drama, part zombie.
I:10014;3420;anyways, my point is, it's a blend of genres.
I:10014;3421;Great flick and nice way to complete the FireFly series.
I:10014;3422;I simply love the series Firefly and the movie Serenity.
I:10014;3423;I still cling to hope that I will be able to watch new adventures of Capt. Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and the rest of Serenity's crew on TV.
I:10014;3424;A continuation to the Firefly series, this movie closes out the show and has a lot of gusto in doing so.
I:10014;3425;Very well made without the swearin', cursin', or Godlessness of most Sci.
I:10014;3426;to which I respond, look at how far technology has come in the past 50 years, and it's accelerating exponentially.
I:10014;3427;I felt the necessary things to know were explained well enough and at appropriate times.
I:10014;3428;In short, Serenity is a great movie .
I:10014;3429;It's a purely wonderful movie if you love the TV series, and still excellent science fiction/action/Western even if you haven't seen Firefly on TV.
I:10014;3430;I was captured in it by the first 5 minutes and it was like that they whole way through.
I:10014;3431;I love this movie so much.
I:10014;3432;I do recommend that you watch the show but if you don't them you can still understand the movie.
I:10014;3433;lived series (Firefly), but the inner workings brought to life by cast and crew are just as fantastic.
I:10014;3434;and Serenity has that, but what puts it in a higher class is its soul.
I:10014;3435;This was the perfect way to end Firefly and say goodbye to the characters that you've grown to love.
I:10014;3436;Same actors as the TV series,Writers did a great job with the storyline.
I:10014;3437;Has a lot of action scenes.
I:10014;3438;A television show which is hugely popular but still is cancelled, a fandom which is overwhelmingly proud and will not let go of its dream, a movie which follows so wonderfully and carefully (thanks to its creator) within its origins.
I:10014;3439;this movie ls a miracle, we know that.
I:10014;3440;It's also a fine example, the best I know of, of a movie produced when the writer/director has the imput to realize his/her vision.
I:10014;3441;This is a Damn Good Scifi Movie!!!
I:10014;3442;I was riveted every second the first time I watched it, and still after having watched it half a dozen times I keep discovering new details each time I watch it again.
I:10014;3443;I have a liking for a good story and this one fits the bill.
I:10014;3444;I've never seen the television series Firefly everyone is talking about, but, I found this movie to be very interesting.
I:10014;3445;"There is a galactic alliance and the government is training human children to be the ""perfect weapon"" using brainwashing and mind control."
I:10014;3446;it really is a good movie.
I:10014;3447;More accurately I've read every page of reviews here and carefully read each and every one with on or two stars.
I:10014;3448;(It is actually about people, nine of them to be exact.)
I:10014;3449;If you don't believe me then try, watch the movie, find the category you think fits best for each character, then watch it again with that in mind.
I:10014;3450;someone complained that he didn't know whether to think of one character as funny or tough, they were trying too hard to pigeonhole the character, real people are both funny and tough.
I:10014;3451;She said that's the highest complement you can give, maybe she's right, maybe she's wrong, but it is important.
I:10014;3452;Look at how much people care about this movie, the people didn't magically do that on their own, it is because the movie is that good.
I:10014;3453;There's a reason that fans come from all ages in between, that fans are not limited by their politics or nationalities, that fans are not even limited by genre.
I:10014;3454;"people who say, ""I love sci."
I:10014;3455;Like all governments it also has it's secrets.
I:10014;3456;the girl is rescued by her brother and the movie continues finally moving into the present tense as a government operative reviews footage of the escape.
I:10014;3457;In my mind this was a refreshing change, while I have no problem with the ships in most sci.
I:10014;3458;If I were to try to write a short description of any one of them it would turn out longer than everything I have written so far, the amount that you can pick up from an expression lasting only a couple of frames is incredible.
I:10014;3459;I hope you do, I really think everyone should get a chance to see something this good.
I:10014;3460;fi, you should love this.
I:10014;3461;Serenity is the movie spin.
I:10014;3462;Taking place shortly after the series, Serenity offers all the great things that made the series what it was.
I:10014;3463;"When it comes to ""Space Westerns"", this is the best one ever!"
I:10014;3464;Serenity (and the Firefly series) require a little suspension of disbelief, but are solidly grounded in excellent storytelling, subtle humor, and fun settings.
I:10014;3465;My friend is in love with this movie, and she wants sequals made.
I:10014;3466;This was the single greatest movie of 2005, I would like to say of all time but I haven't seen enough movies to justify it and I'm still very loyal to High Noon.
I:10014;3467;Go ahead with that finger swirl, maybe it'll uncover the part of your brain that affects your taste so that you'll be able to judge things better.
I:10014;3468;I believe I speak for Browncoats everywhere when I say, to you and to other people with your opinions(I hope for the sake of all humanity that there are very few like you): Just keep your mouth shut for the next few years so that those of us who actually have good taste can put it to good use watching more and equally spectacular installments of the Fireflyverse that will hopefully be created and released soon.
I:10014;3469;I'm not going to go into too much detail because I could go on for hours and I don't think anyone would really want to read it, plus you shouldn't really believe every review you read because it's just some random person's opinion, but it was truly magnificent.
I:10014;3470;"This movie was beautiful, the best I've seen in years
I:10014;3471;My advice: watch this movie.
I:10014;3472;My family had seen this movie at a cousin's house and have laughed about it ever since.
I:10014;3473;so either Joss learned his lessons or the great actors of the Avengers stepped in to help make that movie a success.)
I:10014;3474;If you just have to watch this movie, then enjoy the comedy of it as a sci fi spoof.
I:10014;3475;I really loved this TV series, and like most people was upset when it was canceled.
I:10014;3476;I'm not into these kinds of films at all, but this was excellent.
I:10014;3477;If you are a Firefly fan, you will certainly love Serenity, This movie has all the action and humor of the series and it serves as a great follow up to the (saldy) unfinished series.
I:10014;3478;The story clears up some plot elements that are left unanswered in the TV chapters and it gives a better insight in some characters.
I:10014;3479;Still, this movie is fantastic and the only reason you wouldn't want to see it is if you haven't seen Firefly yet.
I:10014;3480;"inducing technical details I could care less about, and the the rest of it is ""I love this shot, and this piece of music, and this actor and that actor"" on and on and on."
I:10014;3481;"I am a huge fan of his work, and my general motto is that ""Anything you can do, Joss Whedon can do better."""
I:10014;3482;"I think he's done better things than ""Firefly"" and this movie, but I respect and admire his passion for this work."
I:10014;3483;This movie is proof that passion .
I:10014;3484;And I think that's great news.
I:10014;3485;"I certainly hope that if nothing else, all the people who like ""Firefly"" who weren't Whedon fans before will jump on the bus and help make all his future projects more successful."
I:10014;3486;And that's really too bad because Joss Whedon is very capable of greatness.
I:10014;3487;Excellent movie wrapping up an excellent series that was canceled prematurely.
I:10014;3488;philes, the Firefly series is a must see, and Serenity offers a poignant and satisfying ending to the narratives.
I:10014;3489;I was surprised with how well this movie wrapped up all of the loose ends in the TV series.
I:10014;3490;It makes a great gift alongside the Firefly: Complete Series blu.
I:10014;3491;This film is far, far better than I'd expected and a wonderful example of what scifi can be.
I:10014;3492;If George Lucas had an opportunity to see this before he made the Star Wars series, those movies might actually be watchable.
I:10014;3493;He might have seen what characterization, decent writing, compelling characters and heart and soul can do for a movie.
I:10014;3494;There is more excitement and humanity in 20 minutes of Serenity than in any three of the bloated and annoying products of Lucas's imagination.
I:10014;3495;Serenity is the best movie ever.
I:10014;3496;Joss Whedon and the cast are perfect.
I:10014;3497;The movie looked interesting enough from the trailers, and I didn't want to miss anything due to not watching the show.
I:10014;3498;firefly watching friend, and I enjoyed it.
I:10014;3499;Best of all, my friend declared it awesome and was able to understand it without ever having to watch Firefly.
I:10014;3500;How does Joss Whedon do that?Serenity is an amazing film.
I:10014;3501;Anyone who's seen the trailer can see plenty of firepower, but you'd have to see the movie to see there's much more to it.
I:10014;3502;river is obviously the most interesting, but everyone else brings their own dimension to the film.
I:10014;3503;soldier, his first mate Zoe, the pilot Wash (also Zoe's husband), River and Simon, the fugitives from the government, Kaylee, the ship's mechanic, and Jayne, the mercenary.
I:10014;3504;Mal is a Han Solo figure, Jayne is tough, and Kaylee is always happy.
I:10014;3505;, but here it does, and it's a rare blend.
I:10014;3506;any more about the plot I'd likely spoil, but Serenity is one of the best movies I've seen.
I:10014;3507;It's a shame it didn't do as well as it could have, but it's still an amazing film that's definitely worth your time.
I:10014;3508;Joss Whedon knows how to create a great story, and the actors are perfect.
I:10014;3509;I highly recommend this sci.
I:10014;3510;The campy series had a sense of humor to it.
I:10014;3511;It could have been so much more fun.
I:10014;3512;The movie does a great job in tying up loose ends.
I:10014;3513;Found that over all very entertaining and all the usual suspects and dramas of good verses not so good!
I:10014;3514;Over all enjoyed the acting, the sets designs and the writing and production what a great value and good for all ages!
I:10014;3515;I absolutely loved the Firefly series and the movie was wonderful since the series only made it for one season.
I:10014;3516;I am happy to be able to own it to watch whenever.
I:10014;3517;Serenity is a brilliant movie.
I:10014;3518;I believe it is enjoyable no matter what you know (or don't know) going into it, but getting to spend fourteen episodes learning about nine crew members each with brilliant history and dialog makes seeing them in a great film a wonderful experience.
I:10014;3519;This movie had all the infectious humor of the TV series along with the same great visual effects, solid narrative and brilliant dialog.
I:10014;3520;I'm confident you will enjoy them as much as I have.
I:10014;3521;She gets away from a facility that contains many secrets and she is being chased by an assassin from the Government in order to wipe out all her memories and take the crew who saved her with him.
I:10014;3522;"this movie was really full packed of adrenaline, mystery, evil assassin following the crew, crazed monster like outsiders who were like scary savaged beasts
I:10014;3523;Watching her fight was like being mesmerized by a dancer, it was simply stunning as it reminded me of Kill Bill.
I:10014;3524;i'm sure you'll love this movie as much as we did.
I:10014;3525;I have always loved the series Firefly and this movie Serenity.
I:10014;3526;I always wanted both and now I have them.
I:10014;3527;So glad to own one of my favorite movies!
I:10014;3528;My view on that:FANTASTICWhen I saw Sernity, the Reavers, battles and humour were brilliant.
I:10014;3529;The loss of two brilliant characters .
I:10014;3530;An unexpected ending filled with blood, suspense at every bend, I strongly recommend this for everyone, even if you din't like the series, you'll love the movie.
I:10014;3531;This movie is a must see for any Firefly fan.
I:10014;3532;i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend after watching the Firefly series and he loved it.
I:10014;3533;I'm a late bloomer to the whole Firefly/Serenity franchise but when I discovered it, I loved it.
I:10014;3534;The movie is great for those people who have seen the Firefly series and want more, but it also could be a standalone movie.
I:10014;3535;The characters are realistic in this futuristic world, and yet likeable.
I:10014;3536;There are times when I laugh one moment and then gasp in horror in the next.
I:10014;3537;It was well worth viewing for that reason.
I:10014;3538;A dazzling completion to a wonderful Sci.
I:10014;3539;Strong performances turned in by all actors.
I:10014;3540;"A ""must see"" for Joss Whedon fans all the way across the board!"
I:10014;3541;"As a ""Firefly"" junkie (I even knitted a Jayne Hat) I enjoyed this version of ""Serenity"" very much."
I:10014;3542;The best selling point was the extras on disc 2.
I:10014;3543;If you enjoyed the series, the movie will satisfy some of your questions and give you a taste of what could have been.
I:10014;3544;In life this reviewer is a real straight shooter, I'm blunt and I'll tell it how it is from my point of view.
I:10014;3545;very few are in it for the love of the craft.
I:10014;3546;even the chinese slang that was so easy to botch, it's reflected on the screen.
I:10014;3547;And that's why we love Joss.
I:10014;3548;Because he knows how to radiate it from the words on up to the music.
I:10014;3549;It makes his star, Nathan Fillion nerdy in love with the music.
I:10014;3550;"The reason movies like ""Star Wars"" do so well is because their made for the masses."
I:10014;3551;With that said even the untrained eye could spot several first time out mistakes.
I:10014;3552;It's just a good movie.
I:10014;3553;It's not the best ever, but it's the best out this year.
I:10014;3554;thank you for your time.
I:10014;3555;Serenity is the movie sequel to the television show Firefly, and it does a wonderful job of giving closure to those of us who miss the show.
I:10014;3556;Serenity was well worth the wait.
I:10014;3557;Joss Whedon and the whole team did a fab job on bringing our band of misfits to the big screen in a big way.
I:10014;3558;The humor, excitement, story and action combined with the evolution of the characters we know and love from the show WORKED.
I:10014;3559;THANK YOU so much for the really good bonus footage.
I:10014;3560;I love the outtakes and deleted scenes.
I:10014;3561;Firefly would make a great 4th hour of programming on Sci.
I:10014;3562;whedon's strengths are his ability to create great characters (and make you care about them almost instantly), his terrific way with dialogue, his wit, and a penchant for moments of angst that just make you wanna cry.
I:10014;3563;"fi film of 2005 (miles better than ""Revenge of the Sith""), but one of the best among any genre, period."
I:10014;3564;What I liked about it was that it was as described.
I:10014;3565;i'd recommend it to anyone who likes scifi action and humor.
I:10014;3566;it's true there's too many characters for movie format, but Joss did the best he could to dilineate them all clearly.
I:10014;3567;definitely worthy of the series and worthy of a sequel.
I:10014;3568;oR I've got an idea.
I:10014;3569;A fun, action film that makes you care about the characters.
I:10014;3570;Enough creativity and humor to set it apart.
I:10014;3571;It's a great sequel that answers most, if not all questions, the wrongly cancelled tv show left us with.
I:10014;3572;All I have to say is.
I:10014;3573;The movie provides some closure to the series, with both happy and sad moments, but also gives details you were never able to find in Firefly.
I:10014;3574;despite being in direct connection with the Firefly series, Serenity can still be enjoyed without having previously viewed any Firefly episodes.
I:10014;3575;It is a great SciFi movie with an interesting plot and a good amount of action.
I:10014;3576;I'll be honest, when Firefly came out I had no clue what it was.
I:10014;3577;From then, I was hooked by the great case and original plot lines.
I:10014;3578;Still, I pressed on and watched the end of this epic saga.
I:10014;3579;the movie itself does a much better job of outlining the characters than the first few episodes of the show ever did.
I:10014;3580;still, this was a great movie that I will probably watch at least once or twice more.
I:10014;3581;I found the movie incredible!
I:10014;3582;My love of this movie then sparked my interest in Firefly.
I:10014;3583;So I watched the series and of course loved it.
I:10014;3584;i then rewatched Serenity and found it to be even better now that I knew more about the characters.
I:10014;3585;This is definitely a movie that deserved more attention than it got.
I:10014;3586;Fi type movies much, but this was serioulsy good, action, comedy, drama, great plot.
I:10014;3587;It is a wonderful treat for those of us who watched Firefly.
I:10014;3588;But the great thing is that you don't have to have seen Firefly to enjoy Serenity.
I:10014;3589;I highly recommend that you watch this movie.
I:10014;3590;but I wanted to see more of the supporting characters)!
I:10014;3591;The movie is ten times better when watched in proper order.
I:10014;3592;The real winner with the Blu Ray is the DTS.
I:10014;3593;If there's one thing I'm happy about Blu.
I:10014;3594;Joss Whedon is one of the best (and under appriciated) minds in Hollywood.
I:10014;3595;Not only is this movie intelligent, it will make you laugh and cry and think and it will blow your mind.
I:10014;3596;I would've never thought you can make an exellent film about space cowboys but here it is and it is wonderful.
I:10014;3597;Love the story and characters!
I:10014;3598;Loved how they brought the story to a close.
I:10014;3599;This has it all: intriguing mystery, fighting action, and romantic tension.
I:10014;3600;When the movie came out (I recommend watching the whole series first because it makes the movie that much more spectacular when the surprises and twists come), I was very impressed.
I:10014;3601;I hope Firefly returns to television!
I:10014;3602;Serenity is a very well rounded, and exciting sci.
I:10014;3603;I was very happy to find out that you really didn't have to see the TV series to understand the film.
I:10014;3604;I am now watching the series, and I am enjoying it very much as well.
I:10014;3605;I watched Gunsmoke when I was a kid, and loved it!
I:10014;3606;The entire cast works very well together, even for already being on an unfortunately short.
I:10014;3607;This is a very good film, just give it a chance, and you shouldn't be disappointed.
I:10014;3608;"As it turns out, River, though she has been highly traumatized by the Alliance through special ""schooling"" they had her in, has some extrodinary gifts, including being a psychic and having astonishing fighting skills."
I:10014;3609;as I said, the movie does have quite a lot of action.
I:10014;3610;Other characters are equally colorful.
I:10014;3611;The story worked pretty well.
I:10014;3612;With Joss Whelen's sense of humor.
I:10014;3613;All the men in the family loved it.
I:10014;3614;Now that I have finally watched the TC series and gone back to watch the movie I am very impressed with the movie.
I:10014;3615;the movie stays true to the series and neatly wraps up the numerous loose ends the series had.
I:10014;3616;still this was a very satisfying end, to an otherwise open.
I:10014;3617;it is a great movie, that takes risks few other Science Fiction francises have dared to take.
I:10014;3618;what you need to accept to enjoy:Guns with bullets are more reliable and cheaper for the common folk than laser guns.
I:10014;3619;"in the future there are still nine words that should terrify you: ""I'm from the government and I'm here to help."
I:10014;3620;Accept those aspects of the future 'verse and it all makes sense.
I:10014;3621;off that such an incredible series deserved.
I:10014;3622;with any luck, by my giving this 5 Stars, you'll follow my example, give it a try, and eventually find yourself adding your support to the continuation of the series.
I:10014;3623;ray product that you'd expect from anywhere.
I:10014;3624;That said, the film was mind blowing!
I:10014;3625;characters all are great and real.
I:10014;3626;I first started watching Firefly and got hooked.
I:10014;3627;Engrossing film, a little rushed but great effects, story, and acting.
I:10014;3628;Last comment: it served as great fix, with no star wars or lord of the rings in the future.
I:10014;3629;I was very please with this movie.
I:10014;3630;Though it does stand on its own.
I:10014;3631;Summer Glau is pretty amazing in this movie.
I:10014;3632;Serenity is a great little movie.
I:10014;3633;Not The Best Movie Ever Made, as some would say, but a fun experience.
I:10014;3634;field, tight action, good acting, and a pretty cast, then you will enjoy this movie.
I:10014;3635;I give it five stars for all the fun I had.
I:10014;3636;It's a real romp, though it does get nice and dark towards the end.
I:10014;3637;"ignore the zealots from both sides
I:10014;3638;I think most people will enjoy it.
I:10014;3639;time favorite movies that (unfortunately) concludes one of my all.
I:10014;3640;Movie may have been better in the theater, but has a good story line of survival in the future.
I:10014;3641;"Action revolves around a girl and her ""special powers""."
I:10014;3642;This movie is what got me turned on to the whole firefly series in the first place and the movie and the series one of the best things I have ever seen
I:10014;3643;A great release of a great movie.
I:10014;3644;the movie itself is a great sci.
I:10014;3645;This is the perfect blend of great sci.
I:10014;3646;fi storytelling, genre diversity and action in a single feature film.
I:10014;3647;while the movie is based off the Firefly TV series, the director and writing staff did a great job in making it easily accessible to those who have not seen the series.
I:10014;3648;"It's rare that a film so anticipated by its fanbase actually lives up to their expectations
I:10014;3649;the special features are definitely worth picking up this volume for.
I:10014;3650;The behind the scenes features and interviews are great and do not get boring.
I:10014;3651;fi Inside feature does repeat some elements seen in other special features, but it also provides plenty of material not seen in the other features to make it worth watching.
I:10014;3652;all in all this is a great, if not late, release of a highly underrated film.
I:10014;3653;It's a great movie, based on a great series, that everyone should give a chance whether they're sci.
I:10014;3654;this is a great movie.
I:10014;3655;It has good acing, special effects, and tons of action.
I:10014;3656;There is also plenty of drama and adventure in Serenity.
I:10014;3657;fi fan, you definitely need to see this movie.
I:10014;3658;excellent movie, great price on sale, and good special features.
I:10014;3659;Fox, in it's infinite wisdom, always seems to cancel their best shows, this is one of them.
I:10014;3660;"We also are introduced to the main Villain of the film, ""The Operative."""
I:10014;3661;"lead by Captain ""Mal"" Reynolds, has a job waiting for them."
I:10014;3662;"this all comes together in an enormous space battle between the Alliance and a group of mutants called ""Reavers."""
I:10014;3663;fiction movie has to have a space battle, but this one was very smartly thought out.
I:10014;3664;the music was composed by David Newman, and he did a magnificent job.
I:10014;3665;It definitely added to the story, as most excellent film scores are designed to do.
I:10014;3666;It has suspense, warmth, action, adventure, terror, and all of it rolled up into a two.
I:10014;3667;Serenity stands above all that: it brings you into the story, does its level best to get you emotionally attached to the characters, so you feel what they feel, and care about them.
I:10014;3668;That is the function of a well.
I:10014;3669;written film: to get you involved with the characters.
I:10014;3670;A film (or television show) like this comes only once in a great while, and it deserves every accolade it can garner.
I:10014;3671;fans alike will be able to enjoy this film.
I:10014;3672;connect with their favorite characters and the non.
I:10014;3673;fans can enjoy a great science.
I:10014;3674;Also, they could have waited to put this out, and made it a real good release.
I:10014;3675;This movie does an excellent job at following up with loose ends left by the series.
I:10014;3676;To its credit, this sequence also gives us Chiwetel Ejiofor, an inspired young British actor who adds a strong note to this story.
I:10014;3677;Though only fourteen episodes were shot, it's so full of promise and energy that fans of smart stories can't help but be drawn in.
I:10014;3678;That very promise, unsullied by the need for pat answers, has made the unfinished series a classic.
I:10014;3679;This effort at just those pat answers, well, sullies the series.
I:10014;3680;"A Must for ""Firefly"", ""Serenity"" fans!"
I:10014;3681;Over an our of extra bonus features.
I:10014;3682;Also, I should mention, all the bonus features on the single disc are on this set as well.
I:10014;3683;If you're firefly fan, you'll love Serenity!Nice to have it forever, and I hope is around that long.
I:10014;3684;For those of you who are not aware, Serenity is a film that serves as the conclusion to Joss Whedon's sci.
I:10014;3685;Firefly was a phenomenal show that ended well before its time.
I:10014;3686;The CGI was also stepped up from the series, making the action sequences that much more entertaining.
I:10014;3687;Serenity is an amazing film that I would recommend to anyone looking for an excellent way to spend a couple hours.
I:10014;3688;"The basic plot is simple enough: the ""Alliance"" is after the young girl named ""River."""
I:10014;3689;"That's a good thing, but I felt as if the girl and her brother had only recently joined the crew of the ""Serenity."""
I:10014;3690;the acting is very good in this flick.
I:10014;3691;"Adam Baldwin is great as ""Jayne."""
I:10014;3692;I've always felt that deep inside that guy is a superstar waiting to crawl out.
I:10014;3693;The crew is fleshed out with solid acting from Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Summer Glau and the beautiful Jewel Staite.
I:10014;3694;"Other characters included the humorous ""Mr. Universe"" and ""Shepherd,"" a sort of ""Gandalf"" of the galaxy kind."
I:10014;3695;the special effects were very good considering this flick had a rather thin budget to work with compared to other films in the sci.
I:10014;3696;The majority of the digitally animated sequences blended quite nicely with the live.
I:10014;3697;the banter between characters was nice to see on the screen.
I:10014;3698;"All of them had witty exchanges that made me laugh, much like writer and director, Joss Whedon's other TV hits, ""Buffy"" and ""Angel."
I:10014;3699;"for fans of the TV series, I'm sure that ""Serenity"" is a dream."
I:10014;3700;true, but for general film fans, this movie's a bit middle.
I:10014;3701;If you enjoy any series cranked out by SciFi channel, this film is for you.
I:10014;3702;If you are a Joss Whedon, this is a must see movie.
I:10014;3703;As usual, the dialog is amazing.
I:10014;3704;It was good bought for my daughter she a big fan.
I:10014;3705;She enjoyed it, the movie answered questions not addressed by the series.
I:10014;3706;This has got to go down as a classic.
I:10014;3707;the Mandarin language mixed with gun slinging astronauts is just brilliant.
I:10014;3708;The characters are well written and portrayed.
I:10014;3709;I love the Angel series!!
I:10014;3710;Luv this movie great gift idea and the service was great.
I:10014;3711;Luv this movie great gift idea and the service was great.
I:10014;3712;This movie is really cool and a really good perspective of the future.
I:10014;3713;It is full of action and really good sci.
I:10014;3714;This is a great movie for both of those who watched or did not watch the series.
I:10014;3715;The depth of understanding the storyline is deeper with me as well.
I:10014;3716;the movie has great action scenes and tons of humor.
I:10014;3717;and it's nice to finally know what happened with River's story.
I:10014;3718;Whedon wants to be the star, the icon, the visionary.
I:10014;3719;which is, needless to say, also ironic since Spielberg and Lucas were also ripping off the truly great directors and writers in film history.
I:10014;3720;and for all theirfaults, (and they have many) Spielberg and Lucas have talent and vision.
I:10014;3721;I'm glad I did, both movie and TV series are compellingly original and outstanding entertainment.
I:10014;3722;Between the fantastic characters and their onscreen chemistry, the background and plot, and the always fabulous Joss Whedon genius, this show is one that truly did not get the chance it deserved.
I:10014;3723;I can only hope that one day a miracle will occur, and we will either get a movie sequel or a revival of this incredible series.
I:10014;3724;ray so although its an older film the image is very sharp.
I:10014;3725;The story itself is a bit of a convoluted mess but still a fun ride.
I:10014;3726;I love the movie and it is action packed.
I:10014;3727;I love the series Firefly and the movie is great.
I:10014;3728;It is a great carry on from the Firefly show.
I:10014;3729;Serenity has wit, action, and intelligent dialog.
I:10014;3730;the level of sassy, blunt, crass dialog was just fantastic.
I:10014;3731;The plot was strong, and the execution was done well.
I:10014;3732;Joss Whedon's directorial path was masterful, and the actors brought their roles to life.
I:10014;3733;I have seen it three times, and I will go to see it again when it opens on Friday.
I:10014;3734;I am a huge fan of Star Trek .
I:10014;3735;That being said, the Firefly series and the movie Serenity are excellent and represents some of the best science fiction of the 21st century.
I:10014;3736;it is important to note that this movie is based off of the firefly series, and, while an excellent movie on its own right, is best to watch the series first.
I:10014;3737;as it stands both the show and movie are excellent and thoroughly entertaining.
I:10014;3738;up Whedon has done with the wild.
I:10014;3739;fi is one of the greatest things to come to TV and the big screen.
I:10014;3740;Through Firefly and Serenity one gets to see unique characters, deep and poignant stories, excellent music accompaniment, and creative writing all inter.
I:10014;3741;Sit down and let this spectacle take you away as you feel for the characters, the situation, and everything else in this great movie.
I:10014;3742;They made us part of that family.
I:10014;3743;make the Firefly into a phoenix!
I:10014;3744;If you don't you will be missing out on one of the best shows ever made.
I:10014;3745;sharp writing and plot developments.
I:10014;3746;stands up beautifully to repeated viewings.
I:10014;3747;I love the Serenity series, I bought a set for my Brown Coat son too.
I:10014;3748;Haven't checked out the special features yet but knowing Joss I am sure they are good.
I:10014;3749;One of the best science fiction in recent history!
I:10014;3750;Joss Whedon's directing and screenplay is excellent!
I:10014;3751;The cast led by Nathan Fillion is excellent!
I:10014;3752;The music by David Newman is excellent!
I:10014;3753;The cinematography by Jack N. Green (who also has done the cinematography to many of Clint Eastwood's films) is excellent!
I:10014;3754;"The film editing by Lisa Lassek (who also was one of the editors of the tv show ""Firefly"", which the movie is based on) is excellent."
I:10014;3755;"The casting by Anya Colloff and Amy McIntyre Britt (who also did the casting to ""Firefly"") is excellent."
I:10014;3756;"The production design by Barry Chusid (who also did the production design to ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004) and ""Daredevil"" (2003) is excellent!"
I:10014;3757;"The set decoration by Larry Dias (who also did the set decoration to ""The Village"" (2004) and the upcoming ""Lady In The Water"" (2006) is excellent!"
I:10014;3758;"The costume design by Ruth E. Carter (who also did the costume design to ""Four Brothers"" (2005) is excellent!"
I:10014;3759;fiction film that has been done in recent history!
I:10014;3760;budgeted too, at a very decent and small budget of $40 million!
I:10014;3761;running series during the extras, which sparked my interest and my future passion in the show.
I:10014;3762;She was pretty irked that there was only one season and one movie for us to watch.
I:10014;3763;That's what I did, and I still knew who the characters were and what their backgrounds were.
I:10014;3764;You can still enjoy 'Serenity' if you haven't watched 'Firefly,' but you may enjoy it more if you watch the show first (plus, 'Firefly' is brilliant).
I:10014;3765;'Serenity' offers an action packed thrill ride through government conspiracies while highlighting a small woman kicking booty!
I:10014;3766;"a plot that's far superior to many in this field
I:10014;3767;"a message via an ethical/political issue to ponder
I:10014;3768;and smoothly blended in humor/drama/romance.
I:10014;3769;add to this wonderful writing, amazing acting, and great special effects (especially for the tight budget they were working with).
I:10014;3770;Nathan Fillion and Summer Glau shine in portraying both torment and triumph (I focus on them because the film does .
I:10014;3771;'Firefly' shows that the entire cast is talented).
I:10014;3772;Even if you don't typically like sf, you should enjoy this film.
I:10014;3773;Love the series, love the movie!
I:10014;3774;Joss Whedon is truly a media genius.
I:10014;3775;He showed that first in Buffy and Angel, and though I haven't watched Firefly, Serenity is truly spectacular.
I:10014;3776;The movie is written so that if you are not familiar with the series then you'll still be able to understand and enjoy it.
I:10014;3777;Though at times it gets a little tough to follow, its relatively easily to comprehend and understand.
I:10014;3778;If you enjoy science fiction like Star Trek or Star Wars, then you'll enjoy this movie.
I:10014;3779;It has everything, intellegent characters, humor, insite, whores, Chinese.
I:10014;3780;a couple months back I found that the series was on Amazon Prime.
I:10014;3781;I watched it and then rewatched the movie, and whaddaya know, with the character backstories in place the movie was gripping and emotionally charged.
I:10014;3782;i rate the movie lower than five because I really don't think it stands on its own very well, but greater than three because it is an excellent capstone to the saga.
I:10014;3783;A friend of mine in Australia bought the series for me.
I:10014;3784;He told me in detail what happened with the show.
I:10014;3785;The pulling of this show has to be one of the biggest blunders in network history !
I:10014;3786;The realism and the humor are brilliant.
I:10014;3787;It is so very rare when every part of a movie is good.
I:10014;3788;The more people know about it, the more will get hooked and perhaps our influence can sway Universal to do another movie before the cast is old and grey.
I:10014;3789;That would be smart if they actually do it.
I:10014;3790;Firefly/Serenity beats Star Trek hands down, my condolences to Gene Roddenbury, but this is better.
I:10014;3791;This show is worth it.
I:10014;3792;This is intelligent entertainment at it's best !
I:10014;3793;If your a fan of scifi, you'll love this movie and the series (Firefly).
I:10014;3794;Even with it's relatively small budget, this movie look and sounds great.
I:10014;3795;The cast is perfect the their roles.
I:10014;3796;I'd never seen the series but didn't need to in order to enjoy this movie.
I:10014;3797;This one was fun and original.
I:10014;3798;I have a soft spot for westerns as they're the real action movies I grew up with.
I:10014;3799;This movie had great dialogue and good and sometimes strong acting.
I:10014;3800;Well made, and excellent acting.
I:10014;3801;A joy to watch with an immersive story line.
I:10014;3802;"I found it to be a fantastic journey with a more realistic outlook on our possible future through the lives of the crew of ""Serenity""."
I:10014;3803;"The story line is excellent, the cast is outstanding, the special effects are perfectly ""simple"", and the plot wasn't predictable."
I:10014;3804;Granted this is a sci.
I:10014;3805;fi movie, and a fun one at that, but as a fan of the show it just left me wanting more.
I:10014;3806;It does a great job of tying together the firefly series.
I:10014;3807;amazon went above and beyond with customer satisfaction.
I:10014;3808;I got my movie, which is one of my favorites, and eventually did get the original USPO mailed order, which I returned as instructed.
I:10014;3809;Serenity is a great film.
I:10014;3810;"paced, it has memorable dialogue (""I don't want to explode!"")"
I:10014;3811;It balances drama and fast.
I:10014;3812;paced action with dialogue that had the audience bursting out with laughter when I saw it last night in the theater.
I:10014;3813;a story arc that actually was going somewhere .
I:10014;3814;Serenity is the product of fan loyalty and a tireless director's efforts and .
I:10014;3815;The movie is every bit as good, which is pretty damned gratifying.
I:10014;3816;Serenity is everything the fans loved about the series: atmosphere, character, story development.
I:10014;3817;It's part of what makes this an amazing two.
I:10014;3818;i won't give away anything in the film, but I recommend this film.
I:10014;3819;This is a great story.
I:10014;3820;You will enjoy the hell out of yourselves.
I:10014;3821;Serenity is the climactic, epic ending to the Firefly series.
I:10014;3822;but this special collector's edition is a treat in itself.
I:10014;3823;Joss Whedon has done a great job at creating a western feel movie set in the future.
I:10014;3824;His attention to detail in the film is excellent.
I:10014;3825;if you were a fan of the TV show, Firefly, this movie will certainly increase your love for the ship and its faithful crew.
I:10014;3826;Don't get me wrong, the movie stands on its own, but has a much more emotional impact if you're familiar with the series.
I:10014;3827;Firefly is arguable one of the greatest series ever, and now Serenity takes its place as one of the finest films ever made in my opinion (and Joss didn't need 150 million to do it).
I:10014;3828;Once you become familiar with these characters and the 'verse they live in, they will become like family.
I:10014;3829;I love the series, and love the film.
I:10014;3830;There are four additional items, and I haven't found a single easter egg.
I:10014;3831;Serenity is one of the best movies ever made.
I:10014;3832;It was a long long time coming to Germany, but I was finally able to see Serenity.
I:10014;3833;It was worth the wait.
I:10014;3834;I love sharp witty bantering and this film delivers.
I:10014;3835;The characters are well developed and the actors seem to really enjoy their parts.
I:10014;3836;Lots of action and great special effects, but it is the characters you care about.
I:10014;3837;For fans of Firefly it was amazing to see those characters we love on the big screen!
I:10014;3838;For those who haven't been initiated into the Firefly 'verse it is still an awsome example of a sci.
I:10014;3839;Plenty of action and fights, strange creatures and intrigue, complex characters, superb acting, gorgeous sets, a little love and a lot of heart, and determination and strength.
I:10014;3840;This one will keep you at the edge of your seat till the last and then you can't wait to see it over and over.
I:10014;3841;serenity is a marvelous piece of writing, and the cast is fantastic.
I:10014;3842;this is a great fit for someone who likes westerns as this has a cowboy feel to it.
I:10014;3843;It's also a great fit to the true science fiction lovers.
I:10014;3844;The scenery has a hint of Dune due to the desert setting only.
I:10014;3845;There is a moment near the end with a surprise as big as Darth Vader's, Luke.
I:10014;3846;loved it love the action the witty comments the whole movie.
I:10014;3847;The video is beautiful, nice clean visuals and great color balance, audio is excellent as well.
I:10014;3848;The cast commentary is fun to listen to and there are wonderful insights into the making of the film.
I:10014;3849;if you bought the 2005 release, this is one of those times where the double dip is worth the price.
I:10014;3850;It is not only a fantastic show in its own right, but it makes a highly satisfying wrap.
I:10014;3851;The special effects truly complement the story line yet don't steal the show as they do in many sci.
I:10014;3852;Everything from the costumes, sets, props, and effects blend together seamlessly to make this future verse believable.
I:10014;3853;igniting the Firefly is the best segment of the extra stuff.
I:10014;3854;Be that as it may, the movie is well written, brilliantly acted, and thoroughly enjoyable.
I:10014;3855;I truly hope they make a sequal.
I:10014;3856;If you liked the TV series Firefly, you will love this movie!
I:10014;3857;It answered so many questions from the series and wrapped it up well.
I:10014;3858;I loved the series and I loved this movie.
I:10014;3859;When I saw the movie the first time on opening night, I was stunned and thrilled.
I:10014;3860;It exceeded my expectations, both as a fan and a movie.
I:10014;3861;Qualifiers aside, it was the most entertained I remember being in a theatre .
I:10014;3862;a lot of the other reviews have covered the good points of the film.
I:10014;3863;iterate one: the main strength of this film is the characters.
I:10014;3864;As an avid reader of everything from comic books to literature, I can state without hesitation that I believe Malcolm Reynolds is one of the best fictional characters ever created.
I:10014;3865;I had seen every episode in the series, most more than once, prior to seeing the movie and I was surprised by every plot twist.
I:10014;3866;Nothing pleases all, but most of the folk who saw this movie enjoyed it (even newbies).
I:10014;3867;It's weird, it works, and it's wonderful.
I:10014;3868;Surprising twists in the action and ending.
I:10014;3869;This is one of my favorite movies and Nathan Fillion is outstanding!
I:10014;3870;TO anyone that loves scifi this is a must.
I:10014;3871;We watch because in our minds this is the the life that we want to live.
I:10014;3872;Senerity is a great example of that.
I:10014;3873;This is a movie that reminds one the old western movies with gunslingers, bandits and love lost and found.
I:10014;3874;This is a great movie and with the blu.
I:10014;3875;This is a movie that reminds one the old western movies with gunslingers, bandits and love lost and found.
I:10014;3876;This is a great movie and with the blu.
I:10014;3877;I loved this movie and am satisfied that the movie tied up loose ends.
I:10014;3878;Lots of great action sequences and sideways humor.
I:10014;3879;scenes featurettes, and a new commentary track that allows even more insight into the film and the series.
I:10014;3880;i love the show, and I LOVE this movie, so I am a bit biased.
I:10014;3881;I liked how the movie started and that's about it.
I:10014;3882;The movie was good, but the disc was scratched in a few places.
I:10014;3883;"The series, ""Firefly"" got me hooked and this movie is an incredible ride of action, drama, and fun."
I:10014;3884;"I was thrilled that the story continues in ""Serenity""."
I:10014;3885;The characters are the same that you pulled for and loved in the series.
I:10014;3886;for those who have never seen the series (you need to), you can still enjoy the movie.
I:10014;3887;"Joss Whedan is a gifted storyteller.you will make the crew of ""Serenity"" your friends and you will not want the movie to end."
I:10014;3888;It gives you a thrill all the way through.
I:10014;3889;the movie will keep you on the edge of your seats yet it will also make you laugh and cry.
I:10014;3890;I love science fiction, action movies and this is definitely one.
I:10014;3891;but is also has a heart.
I:10014;3892;The writing is fantastic and the chemistry between all of the characters is so comfortable that you really care about everyone of them.
I:10014;3893;Funny, exciting, just plain fun to watch.
I:10014;3894;Even if you aren't a big Science Fiction fan you will love this movie.
I:10014;3895;"Whedon knows this might be his only bite of the cinematic apple for his creations, so fans will see this being more like the series finales of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel."""
I:10014;3896;River is both a psychic and a living weapon, and it turns out that it is the former that is of the biggest concern to the Alliance because she knows something she should not know.
I:10014;3897;Besides, he has an ace, or at least a wild card, up his sleeve with River.
I:10014;3898;So the character arc of the captain is certainly a familiar one.
I:10014;3899;But one of Whedon's chief attributes is that he likes to play with established conventions.
I:10014;3900;So it is nice to play with expectations and Whedon does so, to provide not only humor but some pathos as well (Whedon likes to make you laugh and then give you a reason to suddenly stop laughing).
I:10014;3901;I am perfectly willing to grant that such insider knowledge is worth at least a half.
I:10014;3902;But when River takes her turn we get to see what she is doing and enjoy her whirling ballet of death and one of the joys here is watching Glau turn off the crazy little girl routine and show exactly what the Alliance has created.
I:10014;3903;but it has a true beginning, middle, and end.
I:10014;3904;It isn't an epic film, it isn't a trendsetter, it is simply a very well done story that has humor, plot, humanity, and some nice puzzles.
I:10014;3905;If you enjoyed the Firefly series, this movie is a must.
I:10014;3906;if you are watching the movie without watching the Firefly series, the series is a must.
I:10014;3907;loved the series and the movie!!
I:10014;3908;So you can imagine my excitement when I discovered that they were making a movie.
I:10014;3909;I really liked the movie.
I:10014;3910;if you want to be entertained, watch the movie and all of the out.
I:10014;3911;takes and commentary that comes with it.
I:10014;3912;(big damn movie) was created.
I:10014;3913;ray addition is full of extras,such as picture in picturewith part of the cast reviewing the movie while it's being playedon screen.
I:10014;3914;I'm glad that the series' creator got a chance to wrap up a number of loose ends here.
I:10014;3915;The movie carries on with the wry, exiting, occasionally laugh.
I:10014;3916;loud style that made the series a must.
I:10014;3917;Loved the Firefly sieries, loved the movie would share this with all my friends.
I:10014;3918;"picks, ""Serenity"" is a great film."
I:10014;3919;The action scenes are suspenseful but fun, the one.
I:10014;3920;liners are as witty and hilarious as ever, and a newly.
I:10014;3921;(He's the sly ninja to Mal's noble cowboy, but I digress.)
I:10014;3922;"I think ""Serenity"" is probably a pretty good stand."
I:10014;3923;"alone film, but I'd certainly have to recommend watching ""Firefly"" first."
I:10014;3924;outer space, interesting characters, hot action scenes.
I:10014;3925;I LOVED it because it was so much more than that.
I:10014;3926;We were just so surprised at the depth of characters, the smart wit and chemistry of the crew and an actual plot .
I:10014;3927;rare in a lot of space/action movies.
I:10014;3928;The effects were great, and it was so much more than your average sci.
I:10014;3929;And the best part for me was .
I:10014;3930;the 'Verse Joss Whedon and the crew have created is something special.
I:10014;3931;In this movie we continue the adventures of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his on.
I:10014;3932;There was plenty of action, humor, fun and excitement.
I:10014;3933;It was also easy for newcomers to not only follow, but enjoy.
I:10014;3934;Creator/Writer/Director Joss Whedon though has succeeded on this issue very well.
I:10014;3935;He has done amazing work on tv shows Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel.
I:10014;3936;For example, one of the main themes in Serenity is that you should believe no matter what.
I:10014;3937;well I am used to Joss addressing a theme and then taking it further.
I:10014;3938;depth in the Season 5 Premiere of Angel.
I:10014;3939;I remember great emotional moments in Buffy and Angel where Buffy killed Angel, Buffy died for the second time and Fred died.
I:10014;3940;I had anticipated this movie for over a year.
I:10014;3941;This is a movie for the viewers, for the fans.
I:10014;3942;Yes, Joss was effective in making a film that could be understood and enjoyed by a first.
I:10014;3943;Everybody was rewarded, with something original, with heart, and good story.
I:10014;3944;the film itself is just good storytelling.
I:10014;3945;heroes with adamantium claws, or the hamfisted epic concerning the rather rapid downfall of a mystical night that kills younglings.
I:10014;3946;Joss took the best aspects of drama, including comedy.
I:10014;3947;What I came away with was a wanting to see more, and an understanding of characters I loved.
I:10014;3948;Joss can tell a story, that speaks to the visceral core of human nature, and he does so with the subtlety that comes from years of evolving the craft.
I:10014;3949;Okay, kidding aside, this is one of the best sci.
I:10014;3950;"those who knew and loved ""Firefly"" will find this movie delightful, and those who didn't see Firefly will find themselves entering a rich new world with ""Serenity."""
I:10014;3951;Special features are great too!
I:10014;3952;One of the best I have seen, unfortunately they cancelled the series too soon.
I:10014;3953;Just as the show starts to really flow, and the story line start to take off.
I:10014;3954;i hope they bring it back, but you know they won't.
I:10014;3955;The Firefly series and Serenity are excellent examples of how good sci.
I:10014;3956;You will throughly enjoy the release!
I:10014;3957;And you have to puck up the Firefly box set!
I:10014;3958;A great end to the tv series.
I:10014;3959;and it filled in a lot!
I:10014;3960;So glad I got it!
I:10014;3961;Serenity is the miracle movie of 2005.
I:10014;3962;everything necessary for me to enjoy a movie.
I:10014;3963;the sequence where we are introduced to the crew of Serenity is brilliant, and it just gets better.
I:10014;3964;And for those of you who haven't already, you should check out the score, its pretty fantastic and well put together.
I:10014;3965;I very much enjoyed the movie, however I feel robbed of the development of the story that the television series gives.
I:10014;3966;All I can say is you can't stop the signal!
I:10014;3967;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
I:10014;3968;Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought.
I:10014;3969;Firefly and Serenity are awesome!
I:10014;3970;written, smart, funny and action.
I:10014;3971;The story is interesting and the characters make it real and clever (thanks to incredible casting!)
I:10014;3972;In Serenity, you see the over.
I:10014;3973;powerful effects of the righteous law.
I:10014;3974;land, known as The Alliance.
I:10014;3975;fi, since when has there been good dialog in sci.
I:10014;3976;go back and watch the original Star Wars.
I:10014;3977;And a heck of a lot better than some of those $20 million a movie actors.
I:10014;3978;If you enjoy Firefly, Serenity is a must.
I:10014;3979;It concludes the single aired season of the show beautifully, and incorporates the same style as the TV version.
I:10014;3980;finally, I liked the message that when government goes too far in trying to make everyone feel good, unintended consequences result.
I:10014;3981;"This film is a great wrap up to the series ""Firefly""."
I:10014;3982;Absolutely love the movie and this collector's edition.
I:10014;3983;Can't help but love the collector's edition case as well.
I:10014;3984;The creation of this movie was totally fan driven.
I:10014;3985;What a shame that tv producers did not see the charm in this shoot em up, sci fi original with such wonderful characters.
I:10014;3986;The movie is excellent also
I:10014;3987;This movie is good and the extras are nice but i still would have liked if it contained a digital version of the map of serenity valley that was available as in the other collectors edition.
I:10014;3988;I haveseen and can see this film many, many times.
I:10014;3989;I loved every minute of this film.
I:10014;3990;The movie gave me all of the answers to all of my questions and it ended great!
I:10014;3991;Just adding my voice to the legion of Firefly/Serenity fans who have already commented, since fan support is what got the movie made in the first place.
I:10014;3992;of course we will give Serenity a good review, but most of the professional critics really liked this film, particularly in comparison with the aging Star Wars franchise.
I:10014;3993;fashioned storytelling with fully developed characters you can care about.
I:10014;3994;I only just got into Firefly a few months ago, and I think this film is a great tie.
I:10014;3995;I love this movie and the series Firefly.
I:10014;3996;an amazing way to wrap up one of my favorite TV shows.
I:10014;3997;Let me start by saying that I was very excited to see this movie.
I:10014;3998;I was in high spirits when I went to see it in theatres, and I am very easily entertained by movies in general.
I:10014;3999;fi mixed with western elements sounds intriguing.
I:10014;4000;For probably the first time in years, my attention actually drifted in the theater.
I:10014;4001;I don't know if it's more a problem with the acting or the script, but I'm pretty sure it's a combination of both.
I:10014;4002;this is a great wrap up of the TV series Firefly.
I:10014;4003;I don't know if the movie will make much sense if you haven't seen the shows, so I recommend seeing the shows first.
I:10014;4004;I actually like the tv shows a little better than the movie, but the movie is good too.
I:10014;4005;It was definitely the right decision.
I:10014;4006;fi, which I truly enjoyed.
I:10014;4007;there were some good surprises thrown at us, things I never saw coming, and one that actually brought a tear to my eye, even when I really hadn't cared much about the characters in the series.
I:10014;4008;The action is good, there's plenty of suspense and you really aren't sure, even in the end, if they're going to win or not.
I:10014;4009;this movie does a pretty good job of wrapping up the series while still giving just a hint of leeway for a sequel, or even a second chance at another series.
I:10014;4010;up to the series and with the ending that had us surprised!!
I:10014;4011;Great storyline and great actors!!
I:10014;4012;the special effects were nice, but the best thing about Whedon's effects from the show.
I:10014;4013;this movie gets 4 stars from me because it's a basically good, entertaining movie.
I:10014;4014;The movie itself was a good way to end an unfortunately shortlived series and was suspenseful and revealing about several of the characters.
I:10014;4015;If you just have to know what happens to the Firefly crew this is the movie to watch.
I:10014;4016;humorous fan outcry is the reason Joss Whedon directed Marvel's Avengers.
I:10014;4017;The film is a fun high stakes sci.
I:10014;4018;fi adventure balancing a moderately large cast of leads with the task of fan.
I:10014;4019;enjoy the film and watch the Series Firefly!
I:10014;4020;This was a fun movie, but a bit too like a western for me.
I:10014;4021;It was fun and the dialogue was snappy and alive.
I:10014;4022;There wasn't a dull moment in the film and the characters were involving and interesting.
I:10014;4023;Nathan Fillion was great .
I:10014;4024;"those who liked the Joss Wheedon ""Firefly"" series will love this."
I:10014;4025;It is much, much better.
I:10014;4026;I have watched it x 3 already and will undoubtedly see it many more times before I'm done.
I:10014;4027;Quick Shipment, arrived in great condition.
I:10014;4028;Excellent product for the price.
I:10014;4029;Great adaptation of a TV series that was never given a chance to blossom.
I:10014;4030;The rest of the shows lived up to the high expectations that the pilot set.
I:10014;4031;Great storylines, pithy dialogue, no pandering to pre.
I:10014;4032;good ending where everyone survives.
I:10014;4033;"I thought it was incredible that not only did he choose to ""off"" a few of the major characters, bu that he did it in a believable way."
I:10014;4034;I think his decision to tie that answer into the great chase plot that went on with the assassin after them from start to finish shows what a great touch Whedon has with a story.
I:10014;4035;Sorry big money entertainment industry.
I:10014;4036;Exciting and suspenseful, you ill love this movie.
I:10014;4037;Original, witty, good characters and story!
I:10014;4038;I will keep this short because quite frankly this this move speaks for it's self.
I:10014;4039;This special edition comes with a bunch of extras that make it even more worthwhile.
I:10014;4040;"created by Joss Whedon the incredible mind that brought the world ""Buffy the Vampire slayer"", ""Angel"", ""Dollhouse"" and the highly underrated ""Firefly"" which led to the creation of this amazing film."
I:10014;4041;an amazing, creative, imaginative work of art.
I:10014;4042;It is a science fiction, action, horror, martial arts, comedy western.
I:10014;4043;loved characters of the Firefly television show.
I:10014;4044;the acting is marvelous, the story telling compelling and, in my opinion, the storyline gives a very timely cautionary tale for us today.
I:10014;4045;snuggle up with a loved one, grab your popcorn and drink, and curl up on the couch for a great date.
I:10014;4046;I wanted the extra behind the scenes and the commentary the comes along with the Blu.
I:10014;4047;I enjoyed watching this, and it does make a good addition to the series which was canceled far before its time.
I:10014;4048;It gives fans the much needed and deserving wrap up of the series.
I:10014;4049;Great addition to any Firefly fan's collection.
I:10014;4050;I have the complete series and this movie is a great cap.
I:10014;4051;And, on the big screen they pulled out all the stops.
I:10014;4052;firefly was one of the best TV shows in this generation.
I:10014;4053;If you never saw the TV show, and you like space or action movies, you'll really enjoy this screen adaptation of the show.
I:10014;4054;and you can stop it and watch bits over again!
I:10014;4055;This way you really get attached to the characters and get a real good background to why they act the way they do.
I:10014;4056;I love the way they interact with each other and react to sticky situations, great actors and script writer.
I:10014;4057;It makes for one intense movie!
I:10014;4058;Either way, I really recommend this movie, definitely one of my favorites!
I:10014;4059;It's a good ride with all the original cast and the emotional and action elements of the series.
I:10014;4060;Definitely worth watching whether or not you are a fan of the original series.
I:10014;4061;Really nice conclusion to the TV series.
I:10014;4062;Hopefully a sequel is made so all of us SCI.
I:10014;4063;I can only say I will be watching this cinema extravaganza again at least a large number of times.
I:10014;4064;It was amazing and the storyline was so full of twists and turns I can't begin to believe I have seen it thoroughly enough to put it away.
I:10014;4065;This movie offers closure to those who loved Firefly.
I:10014;4066;It may not be what we asked for, but it is definitely much, much better than nothing.
I:10014;4067;The movie did the legend justice and we can probably ask no more than that.
I:10014;4068;It was a good Movie, but really just a character of the TV show.
I:10014;4069;Joss is the best writer of our time.
I:10014;4070;Firefly is the Star Trek of our generation.
I:10014;4071;I also loved all the Star Trek series AND of course, 'StarWars'.
I:10014;4072;SERENITY is another outstanding addition to that genre.
I:10014;4073;You have characters that you care very much for, a lot of action, the requisite Sci Fi monsters, space scenes with a lot of futuristic gismos and that beloved touch of romance.
I:10014;4074;This movie was so good that when it was over, I felt as if I had only been watching it for ten minutes.
I:10014;4075;In fact, I had to watch all the extras, both with and without Joss' commentary!I have always thought of Joss Whedon as a creative genius.
I:10014;4076;The shows were all so cleverly written and highly addicting!
I:10014;4077;Besides having snappy storylines and wonderful, fleshed out personalities, Joss has something else in his stories: Clearly defined 'good' and 'evil' characters.
I:10014;4078;And, the theme is always good over evil.
I:10014;4079;Fortunately the good guys won in this film and I hope they will have many more battles to conquer.
I:10014;4080;I for one will be watching.
I:10014;4081;I can't remember when I've enjoyed a series as much as this.
I:10014;4082;I am so surprised that this show got cut because it has all the right stuff.
I:10014;4083;action, adventure, comedy, love etc.
I:10014;4084;"I bought the Series and then a friend told me about the ""Serenity"" movie."
I:10014;4085;I take friends and family to charity showings of 'Serenity' every year and converts of them.
I:10014;4086;See it after viewing all the TV episodes otherwise it spoils the surprise.
I:10014;4087;It was a Christmas gift for a 16 year old boy who is a geek.
I:10014;4088;Of course he loved it.
I:10014;4089;com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.
I:10014;4090;Flowed with a sort of rhythm the way it's crafted.
I:10014;4091;The cultural fusion was fun and interesting.
I:10014;4092;This is a good time.
I:10014;4093;free, but still gives you an idea of how good it is.
I:10014;4094;One of the greatest sci.
I:10014;4095;An epic adventure that should have been told in much greater length.
I:10014;4096;I can watch this film over and over .
I:10014;4097;simply a joy to watch.
I:10014;4098;"the acting is great all around, but especially the ""operative"" Chiwetel Ejiofor (a world."
I:10014;4099;class actor, best known forAmerican Gangsterand another terrific yet underrated sci.
I:10014;4100;the script is great .
I:10014;4101;It's witty, and the special effects are great.
I:10014;4102;Another friend pointed out the similarity between this plot and the Fluoride added to our water supply .
I:10014;4103;The Firefly series was great, too, but actually the movie had a bit more depth, and develops River's character a bit better.
I:10014;4104;it is a bit formulaic in parts, but it departs enough from the mainstream to make it a breath of fresh air.
I:10014;4105;However since it was cancelled, Serenity does a good job of bringing the series to a true ending.
I:10014;4106;It is as good as the series.
I:10014;4107;Firefly was one of the best shows on television that was canceled due to the corporate suits that know little about good art.
I:10014;4108;The series and the movie Serenity are a joy to watch, great acting, directing,writing, and producing.
I:10014;4109;fi fan this is what I crave, a solid story and deeply developed characters.
I:10014;4110;The characters manage to get a laugh without being corney.
I:10014;4111;serenity can hold it's own with ANY Sci.
I:10014;4112;Although I enjoyed the action sequences and special effects of the movie, which were spectacular, the movie's strengths just about end there.
I:10014;4113;two things that were well done were the planetscapes at the beginning of the movie, which are beautiful.
I:10014;4114;Whedon admits he was influenced by Star Wars, and you can see some of that influence here.
I:10014;4115;The movie soundtrack is good and really adds atmosphere to the movie.
I:10014;4116;The earth is pretty much the same as it always was.
I:10014;4117;Still, the fight scenes with the agent, and especially the one at the end between him and Captain Malcolm, are very well done and choreographed, and I say that as a long time martial arts instructor who has occasionally trained movie actors who specialize in martial arts roles.
I:10014;4118;the cast is diverse enough and talented enough so that they could have been standouts if they'd had strong enough material to work with.
I:10014;4119;I give the movie three stars for all the action and special effects, which were great, especially, as Whedon says, the movie was made on a relatively modest budget.
I:10014;4120;i did like the concept of the U. s. and China merging to create a great superpower, though.
I:10014;4121;i give the director some credit also for making a movie that does a lot to fill in the backstory for his previous Firefly series.
I:10014;4122;And actually, the fact that the movie was made at all after the original series was cancelled is a great tribute to Whedon.
I:10014;4123;time favorite movies and I can watch it over and over.
I:10014;4124;I love having it on Blu.
I:10014;4125;Great story, characters, performances, effects, script, direction!!!!
I:10014;4126;I went into it without even knowing about Firefly and I loved it.
I:10014;4127;i had never seen Firefly before this movie, but the movie makers had that in mind and clearly aimed to please both those who had seen the series and those who did not as well as fill in the series's backstory.
I:10014;4128;the cast was great and the characters had great 'chemistry.'
I:10014;4129;My personal favorite character is River.
I:10014;4130;The Alliance Operative (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) is one of the best villains cinema has seen in years.
I:10014;4131;the film's emotional impact is unusually strong, not only for a sci.
I:10014;4132;These emotional extremes add a lot of depth to the movie.
I:10014;4133;the special effects are top.
I:10014;4134;The space battle at the end is breif but very memorable.

I:10014;4142;It's still a great movie, but you want to check out the show, first.
I:10014;4143;liked the movie a lot and is a must see if you love the series.
I:10014;4144;Probably my favorite TV series ever.
I:10014;4145;This is the closing movie for one of the best Sci.
I:10014;4146;The creator, Joss Whedon is a genius.
I:10014;4147;The real fans must watch the series (Complete) before seeing this movie to truly appreciate both.
I:10014;4148;A great mixture of wit and emotions!
I:10014;4149;the future world of 'Serenity' is that good.
I:10014;4150;fi action story that has the sort of character hooks that makes you feel you know the protagonists and want to live in their tramp spaceship with them.
I:10014;4151;In 'Serenity', Whedon shows how mature he has become .
I:10014;4152;ups, whether in the delightfully mordant humour or the breathtaking action sequences.
I:10014;4153;the final revelations are utterly worthy of the suspense that builds through the film .
I:10014;4154;The crescendo of risk and violence is also of that satisfying sort where characters have to make ever greater sacrifices to do the right thing, a real heroism that is the antithesis of the glib heroics of a Han Solo.
I:10014;4155;Serenity will be an instant 'cult classic' but it deserves a far broader audience.
I:10014;4156;See this film for its screen craft and its respect for the viewers' intelligence: it might be subtitled `for evil to triumph it is only necessary for good men to do nothing'.
I:10014;4157;This is a movie from a director who knows that life and love are bitter sweet, now or 500 hundred years in the future.
I:10014;4158;"And in many ways, its better than ""Dune""."
I:10014;4159;"fi movies, and to be honest, I thought ""Firefly"" at best was a good idea that wasn't given enough time to develop."
I:10014;4160;"Needless to say, ""Serenity"" came and blew everyone away."
I:10014;4161;Serenity will always be a very unique and rare film, because its a spectacular combination of special effects, interesting time/space ideas, and a story arc that happily concludes a cancelled TV Series.
I:10014;4162;"but more than a year after release, ""Serenity"" continues to bring in new fans and win over more people to the science fiction genre."
I:10014;4163;If you liked Joss Whedon's Firefly you will love this movie.
I:10014;4164;It has everything a Browncoat needs, funny lines, great storyline and awesome action.
I:10014;4165;ray fan, this is for you!
I:10014;4166;fi does a great dis.
I:10014;4167;These characters are so well written, acted and directed that we feel an almost instant bond with them.
I:10014;4168;One of the best and most even ensemble pieces ever.
I:10014;4169;SOMEBODY should take note and bring this back.
I:10014;4170;He has a solid grasp of sci.
I:10014;4171;While an action adventure, it is also a romance, a drama, comedy, just everything all together in one great show or movie.
I:10014;4172;It was funny and exciting and had some great plot twists.
I:10014;4173;this movie is hilarious, with its very witty writing and a cast to match, it is more than entertaining, the captain for one is an eyeful and the story is sooo good i cannot believe there wasnt a sequel, well we can keep hoping!!!
I:10014;4174;The action is quite exciting and I felt very tense waiting to see how things would turn out in the end.
I:10014;4175;Some sad bits, but very good film.
I:10014;4176;I thought this was one of the best Sci.
I:10014;4177;line was was funny, action.
I:10014;4178;The characters felt like real people.
I:10014;4179;The performances were so nuanced that at first I thought that this movie was based on a book.
I:10014;4180;I started looking for the book and found the Firefly TV Series (which I also enjoyed and am very mad that the best TV show I never saw got cancelled.)
I:10014;4181;This movie is full entertaining from the begining to the end and it's very smart.
I:10014;4182;The movie was just as great as the series.
I:10014;4183;Even if you had never seen the series, the movie was great by itself but if you had followed the series.
I:10014;4184;it help complete the illusion.
I:10014;4185;one of the best parts was having the original cast back as it made the continuation of the story line more completeA must see for anyone but especially sci.
I:10014;4186;I would defiantly recommend this movie to anyone who likes SiFi, or Nathan Fillion.
I:10014;4187;The movie was exceptionaly good.
I:10014;4188;ray steel box release, I can only rate it one star.
I:10014;4189;So with what I have at hand I will be generious and rate this steel box at 2 stars.
I:10014;4190;Serenity stands alone as an amazing film.
I:10014;4191;This movie has a heart, which is what nearly all science fiction films lack nowadays (faux.
I:10014;4192;subtle nod to Star Wars 1,2 &3).
I:10014;4193;The characters are honest, true, and human.
I:10014;4194;The threats are real, the danger is intense, and nobody is safe.
I:10014;4195;I have seen it 6 times and each time I am on the edge of my seat, wringing my hands in anticipation.
I:10014;4196;This is a fantastic movie, and while I does not need to be watched in conjunction with Firefly, it is even better after doing so.
I:10014;4197;i'll admit I was a casual fan at best of the show, watching about two thirds of the episodes.
I:10014;4198;Ironically, I really got into it after the cancellation news came out.
I:10014;4199;With the stakes raised, Malcolm makes it his mission to find the truth about River.
I:10014;4200;Fortunately, the movie does a good job of reminding us about this particular science fiction universe before jumping into the new action.
I:10014;4201;Action scenes in the beginning are followed by new information that ultimate leads us to a conclusion I didn't expect.
I:10014;4202;The actors do a good job through all of this, making us care about the outcome.
I:10014;4203;the show had a couple trademarks, both of which are present in the film.
I:10014;4204;This allows for some beautiful scenery as the ship is flying over landscapes and through horses.
I:10014;4205;Additionally, the characters had a very deadpan sense of humor that carries over well to the big screen.
I:10014;4206;While it will appeal mainly to those who have seen FIREFLY, those not familiar with the TV show can enjoy it, too.
I:10014;4207;While there are places the franchise could go from here, I am quite satisfied to let it rest in peace.
I:10014;4208;All the characters are loveable.
I:10014;4209;This film offers substance, humor, drama, visual treasures and musical spleandor.
I:10014;4210;The only way to do this film, and series justice is to bring it back to cable as another series with the same cast, and writer/producer!
I:10014;4211;Great show I wish they made more!
I:10014;4212;The ensemble was terrific and the best part of every episode was learning more about a crew of folks, each one of which had a great story to tell.

I:10014;4214;sci fi flick I've seen in many moons.
I:10014;4215;"And they really are ""our"" crew, almost from the start."
I:10014;4216;"and the ""bad guy"" in this film is equally complex and wonderful."
I:10014;4217;"Like Eric Hoffer's ""true believer,"" he's relentless and passionate in his pursuit of Serenity and her cargo."
I:10014;4218;obviously, I loved this film and don't want to give away too much.
I:10014;4219;well acted, well written, great effects.
I:10014;4220;fi movies in recent years, it is one of the best all round movies I have ever seen.
I:10014;4221;What makes this movie so good is everyone will like it.

I:10014;4223;rate acting, and great special effects.
I:10014;4224;The movie industry puts out way too few really good sci.
I:10014;4225;The shear number of horror movies dwarfs the handful of good sci.
I:10014;4226;I keep my fingers crossed that some brave, brilliant producer/director team will come along one of these years and dazzle us with a new magnificent journey beyond the stars that shakes us to the core, disturbs our sense of reality, and trivializes our silly politics, religion and self.
I:10014;4227;We need a new breed of writers and directors who will raise the bar and present the viewing public with an experience to make us cry, laugh, think and learn something new.
I:10014;4228;A wonderous vision of the future started in the all too short run of the TV series Firefly continues in the big screen version of it, Serenity.
I:10014;4229;The story is a paean about how the unlikeliest people can become heroes and how the right of individuals to live free if an absolute.
I:10014;4230;fi Movie!I can recommend this one very, very much!One of the best Sci.
I:10014;4231;"fi Movies, I have ever seen!The series ""Firefly"" is as good."

I:10014;4233;I think science fiction is one of the few genres that take advantage of this new technology.
I:10014;4234;ray release because I think you'll be impressed.
I:10014;4235;It's one of the best Science Fiction movies of all time and wraps up the cliffhanger plot that left fans hanging when the Firefly television series was canceled.
I:10014;4236;This movie is the by far one of the best sci.
I:10014;4237;In my opinion, this was an exceptional movie.
I:10014;4238;It was full of action and adventure, yet it focused on the human factors of the characters more than it did on the setting and plot (as did the FireFly series).
I:10014;4239;If this is the type of movie you enjoy, I highly recommend it.
I:10014;4240;It is a movie both men and women can enjoy.
I:10014;4241;Much has been said of it in more lengthy reviews, so I'll keep my review to this.
I:10014;4242;I would recommend this movie to any sci.
I:10014;4243;Great TV series and a great movie.
I:10014;4244;It is still the best scifi movie of 2005.
I:10014;4245;Sure Star Wars looked great, but that was about it.
I:10014;4246;The movie was well written, acted and produced.
I:10014;4247;Joss Whedon shows that he is a more than capable movie writer and director.
I:10014;4248;The sound and picture look great.
I:10014;4249;The deleted scenes are fantastic.
I:10014;4250;It shows just how much fun the cast had making this movie.
I:10014;4251;Truly a labor in love.
I:10014;4252;SERENITY is a awesome movie!
I:10014;4253;The special effects are really fantastic!
I:10014;4254;Captain Malcolm Reynolds, so aptly and brilliantly played by Nathan Fillion, protects her and her brother, Simon.
I:10014;4255;The movie was a gem.
I:10014;4256;featuring intelligent dialogue and wonderfully developed characters, Serenity manages to make an interesting and fresh foray into a genre that has been victimized by mediocrity on so many occasions.
I:10014;4257;Truly, Serenity proves that a great movie is first and foremost about the writing.
I:10014;4258;a great script, wonderful acting, and outstanding direction make Serenity one the best sci.
I:10014;4259;Firefly was such a great show in every respect.
I:10014;4260;The actors were superb and the storyline was awesome.
I:10014;4261;You really liked the characters.

I:10014;4265;"I hope you see the see the series ""FireFly"" first, but even if you don't, this is a remarkable movie."
I:10014;4266;we start with our two most obviously mysterious crew members, Doctor and River Tam.
I:10014;4267;The mystery lies in what has been done to her, and what has she become?There are a few Ice Floats in here, but suspend your disbelief, because it is worth it.
I:10014;4268;They are a family, they bicker, they laugh at each other, get on one another's nerves, but unite when and one of them is truly endangered.
I:10014;4269;the magic created here is behind the scenes, but will draw you in.
I:10014;4270;i stake my reputation on rating this movie above five stars, please feel free to write me if you disagee.
I:10014;4271;thank you for reading my opinions, please read the review for the story line.
I:10014;4272;Amazing movie, has all the feel of the series.

I:10014;4285;I'll come right out and admit my bias.

I:10014;4290;But as an action movie, it's quite brilliant.
I:10014;4291;As a comedy, it's sharp and playful.
I:10014;4292;As a drama, it's touching and occasionally rises to the level of real tragedy.
I:10014;4293;This film, while asking for far more of a suspension of disbelief than most of its genre brethren, makes up for it by providing a rollercoaster ride of an experience, thrusting you into its backstory and then its main story so quickly that you barely have time to breathe.
I:10014;4294;People not disposed to wait for the payoff will quickly grow bored, but for the patient viewer, this film eventually pays back ten times what it asks from you.
I:10014;4295;The film is good, with great moments.
I:10014;4296;That it manages to do this, even to a partial extent, is frankly amazing.
I:10014;4297;And he takes advantage of top.
I:10014;4298;This film is a must.
I:10014;4299;It is intelligent, well written, and leaves you wanting more.
I:10014;4300;if you have not seen the Firefly TV series that this movie was based I highly recommend that you check it out as well.
I:10014;4301;He did it first with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the titular character played by a valley.
I:10014;4302;"western,'his prematurely canceled show ""Firefly,"" Whedon shows he's able to keep the spirit of the show alive on the big screen, developing a plot that raises the stakes considerably (quieting fears of longtime fans that it would just be a two."
I:10014;4303;it matters only in a general sense that this film takes place in the outer reaches of space in the future, save its creation of a setting that allows a singular focus on the players involved.
I:10014;4304;But there is also plenty of dialogue, and plenty of moments shared between just a few characters that will elicit laughter (my theater roared at a few particularly clever moments) and tears (for spoilers sake those won't be mentioned here).
I:10014;4305;While the words are Whedon's, the people he chose to bring these words to life also make the characters the force they are in the film.
I:10014;4306;For a movie like this, those who haven't seen the show will enjoy the show with a fresh look.
I:10014;4307;There is a great deal of backstory between the characters, and while this is made as clear as it can be in the two or so hours that the silver screen shines, it can't compete with 14 episodes (3 unaired) of television to set that up.
I:10014;4308;You can tell that there's a history there when the movie pops up, but the characters are well.
I:10014;4309;developed within the confines of the film.
I:10014;4310;My wife, who'd never seen the show, laughed at all the right places, and cried with me at all the right places.
I:10014;4311;my final grade is high.
I:10014;4312;But go see the movie.
I:10014;4313;Glad I ran across both.
I:10014;4314;Movies are great but you get a lot more out of a TV series.
I:10014;4315;Serenity is an awesome movie.
I:10014;4316;If you want an amazingly timeless movie, this is it.
I:10014;4317;While you don't have to watch the series to understand the basics of the movie I would highly recommend it.
I:10014;4318;take the time to watch the series, then watch this movie.
I:10014;4319;Absolutely the most underrated movie of the year.
I:10014;4320;a wonderfully refreshing change to the ho.
I:10014;4321;its superb allways be one best tv shows around.
I:10014;4322;"I would not consider myself a ""fan"" of the TV series ""Firefly"" (I saw several epsiodes when Fox first aired the show, and enjoyed it, but haven't seen the entire season), but I do enjoy Joss Wheadon's style, so I figured that I would enjoy ""Serenity""."
I:10014;4323;Fun special effects and great space combat.
I:10014;4324;A good time and well worth checking out.
I:10014;4325;oh and I loved FIREFLY and SERENITY, I just want more of the movie!
I:10014;4326;Whether you're familiar with the TV show or not, this is a great movie.
I:10014;4327;some of the best characters, great chemistry between them, and fantastic storytelling in a space western that flies from comic to deadly in a blink.
I:10014;4328;because Firefly was never taken down the story lines that Joss Whedon obviously started laying the groundwork for in Season 1, Whedon uses Serenity to fill in the backstory and move forward with one of the more enigmatic characters, River.
I:10014;4329;Her brother, Simon, has risked everything he has to save River and keep her hidden from the Alliance.
I:10014;4330;The final showdown between the Operative/Alliance, the crew of Serenity, and a dangerous third party is spectacular.
I:10014;4331;if you havent' seen Firefly, I recommend picking it up first to get some backstories for the crew.
I:10014;4332;I can't explain it, but it works.
I:10014;4333;The dialogue is humorous, especially from Captain Malcolm Reynolds, despite the serious nature of the show.
I:10014;4334;The writing is superb and I can only wish that the fan support again grows to the level where Joss Whedon makes another series or movie.
I:10014;4335;Watching the extras will make you grin and laugh, because with an amazing show/movie like this one, you know the characters.
I:10014;4336;Good movies don't do that, just the best.
I:10014;4337;If you're a Firefly or Serenity fan this is a must own.
I:10014;4338;The extra footage is great the comentary by Joss Whedon is wonderful and sheds some light on certain aspects of the film.
I:10014;4339;All in all a great addition to you Firefly collection.
I:10014;4340;I loved the storyline of this movie.
I:10014;4341;from pretty much everyone in the film.
I:10014;4342;I bought it as a gift for my husband, a sci.
I:10014;4343;All I can say is that this movie was absolutly amazing!
I:10014;4344;The movie has great characters, wonderful special effects and neatly wraps up the Firefly story line.
I:10014;4345;fi such as Buffy, StarTrek, Stargate and the like, you are in for a great surprise.
I:10014;4346;Although this is a spin off from a TV show, this film absolutely kicks ass.
I:10014;4347;It is the freshest, most exciting and memorable sci.
I:10014;4348;I'd say that apart from the cracking effects, design, score, acting and costume, the most remarkable element is absolutely the script.
I:10014;4349;Dialogue that really breathes life into the lovable characters and malice into the baddies.
I:10014;4350;It has a truly dynamic and surprising plot that is always credible, always surprising and nothing is ever resolved by recalibrating the disconbobulator.
I:10014;4351;Aside from the tension, Serenity has good pacing, solid action, great balance of humorous and deadly serious dialogue, great characters, and even a few moments you know are just to give you a thrill and you love it because you crave those old.
I:10014;4352;So much is packed into Serenity.
I:10014;4353;maker put it all in Serenity, and I'm grateful I got to see all of these things, even if it was something of a tight fit.
I:10014;4354;If that is the case, this is the right movie for you.
I:10014;4355;"The casting is the same, as is the story, but there is a big difference between this film and the series: ""Serenity"" has a great ending that brings a sense of closure, without taking away the possibility of a sequel."
I:10014;4356;This film is really great, but the series rocks too!This sci.
I:10014;4357;fi Western has a great plot, lots of action, and quite a few oneliners that will make you laugh.
I:10014;4358;Is it a surprise that I heartily recommend it?Belen Alcat
I:10014;4359;I love the characters and the story line is definitely not your standard fare.
I:10014;4360;But, unlike most of the Trek movies (or, indeed, The X. files movie) both Serenity and Khan actually feel like.
I:10014;4361;Although, it must also be said that it does so, successfully, more often than not.
I:10014;4362;I personally believe that Serenity was a really good movie.
I:10014;4363;"I had my gripes about firefly (hated the whole glorified Whore/""Companion"" idea) but I really got into the characters themselves."
I:10014;4364;"Because Serenity is a ""Great"" 'continuation' of the series and a ""Good"" stand."
I:10014;4365;after seeing the Firefly series, I still think this is a pretty good movie.
I:10014;4366;So if you are a firefly fan, definately pick it up.
I:10014;4367;it's still worth a look.
I:10014;4368;fi with comedy, drama, great plot, super special effects etcBonus stuff was great Well worth the price
I:10014;4369;"If you liked the series ""Firefly,"" you'll love the movie, ""Serenity."""
I:10014;4370;lived, but immensely popular series.
I:10014;4371;i highly recommend it to all sacience.
I:10014;4372;It's a very well done combination of both.
I:10014;4373;I went with my kids to this movie and it was great.
I:10014;4374;The Western flavor and quick witted dialog were a huge treat I wasn't expecting.
I:10014;4375;I love the Science Fiction genre and have come to expect very low brow efforts.
I:10014;4376;a note for you to consider.
I:10014;4377;"Click the ""see all my reviews"" and see what else they review."
I:10014;4378;I am a fan of Star Wars since the beginning when I stood in line to see it in 1977.
I:10014;4379;Maybe I should make up accounts for them so I can add stars.
I:10014;4380;FIrefly was one of the best Sci.
I:10014;4381;It was original and creative and filled with nothing less then I would expect from Joss Whedon.
I:10014;4382;dialogue is always clever, biting and cheeky.
I:10014;4383;"For fans of the prematurely cancelled ""Firefly"" series, Joss Whedon's ""Serenity"" will be an early Christmas present, full of delightful touches, references to the series, and hints about answers we have longed looked for."
I:10014;4384;"unlike many television shows transferred to the big screen, however, ""Serenity"" is a movie that can stand on its own merit as a solid space opera, enjoyable for everyone, not just ""Firefly"" geeks."
I:10014;4385;It also proves that a good movie doesn't require star.
I:10014;4386;is possibly the most original I've encountered in movies of this kind, an amalgam of Westerns, science fiction, and classic fantasy, sprinkled liberally with Chinese culture.
I:10014;4387;But despite this seemingly non sequitur mix, Whedon manages to blend it all into a cohesive, engaging whole.
I:10014;4388;and how it does engage!
I:10014;4389;The film opens with a lesson on the colonization of other worlds .
I:10014;4390;and how the Alliance (a powerful and hyper.
I:10014;4391;"She is precocious, sensitive, brilliant
I:10014;4392;And this proves true as we are jolted from the bright white summer classroom to an unfriendly blue.
I:10014;4393;"Doctors have taken her natural intelligence and grace and made her a weapon, a deeply empathetic psychic with extraordinary gifts as a ""Reader"" and an assassin's knack for martial arts combat."
I:10014;4394;Serenity's crew are a strange mix: warrior woman Zoe, geeky pilot Wash, gentle and sweet mechanic Kaylee, and Jayne, a blunt, man's man type who loves his guns but has his tender moments too.
I:10014;4395;Leading this ragtag crew is Captain Mal Reynolds, a man of great determination, who we sense is at heart a good man, but not without flaws.
I:10014;4396;Most of the characters are drawn in broad strokes .
I:10014;4397;"but they engage our emotions in a surprisingly deep way
I:10014;4398;"layered and complex
I:10014;4399;Keeping River from the Alliance Operative and trying to discover the truth about what horrific knowledge is eating at her brain provides the framework for the action, of which there is a great deal, forming a sort of highly.
I:10014;4400;engrossing space chase that Lucas only dreams of.
I:10014;4401;They were once human, we are told, but having gone to the furthest reaches of space despaired and forgot themselves, cutting on their own flesh and cannibalizing others.
I:10014;4402;The truth, as we learn, is more simple and more harrowing.
I:10014;4403;it is touches like these that make Whedon's world simultaneously so familiar and so foreign, and ultimately so fascinating to watch.
I:10014;4404;Serenity succeeds not only as a space adventure, full of strange sights and stirring battles, but as a character.
I:10014;4405;driven story that grabs us, pulls us in, and forces us to care about its people.
I:10014;4406;It delivers on both counts with a gripping, homespun immediacy unlike anything else I've seen.
I:10014;4407;a warning for devoted Browncoats: there are moments that will make you laugh, moments that will shock you, and moments that you will deny until the end.
I:10014;4408;I also haven't laughed this much at the movies this year.
I:10014;4409;Serenity has joy and sorrow, humor and pain, loss and sacrifice and gain.
I:10014;4410;Whedon has succeeded in crafting an elegant, gripping story that fully captures our imaginations and our hearts.
I:10014;4411;I loved the Firefly series and wish it had never been cancelled.
I:10014;4412;The cast has great chemistry.
I:10014;4413;"I loved the show and the movie so now watching the deleted scenes and getting the background information (which were amazing, BTW) I just have to say this: ""Joss push for a sequel!"""
I:10014;4414;I know that this will never happen, but I can dream.
I:10014;4415;anyone who even liked the show has to get this version of the movie!
I:10014;4416;This product was delivered in a timely manner and was a Christmas gift and delivered when promised.
I:10014;4417;True to the original concept.
I:10014;4418;It stays true to the show and the twists and turns you go on are amazing.
I:10014;4419;It has a great story, great acting, cool special effects, neato camera angles (especially the first shot of inside the spaceship Serenity.
I:10014;4420;it is a continuous shot throughout the entire ship.)
I:10014;4421;Give them out as presents to everyone you know!
I:10014;4422;Exciting action, love story and good guy bad guy story line.
I:10014;4423;The characters are well developed, the acting is superb.
I:10014;4424;I even went ahead and bought the Firefly series for an incredible price as well.
I:10014;4425;I really liked this series, I don't understand why this series was canceled, I thought it was very popular, at least it was with my kinds of people.
I:10014;4426;I recommend this movie because of bond this crew has for one another, and the action scenes are fun to watch as well.
I:10014;4427;I highly recommend this movie.
I:10014;4428;This is great movie helps fill the void of Firefly.
I:10014;4429;I can only add, that, I enjoyed it as much as the series for TV.
I:10014;4430;I recommend watching the TV episodes first, naturally, because that's the order in which I enjoyed Joss Whedon's pot pouri of fascinating characters (Serenity's crew).
I:10014;4431;He did this very successfully, in my opinion.
I:10014;4432;So much of it is unique that it is a fresh experience, even for jaded sci.
I:10014;4433;Saw Serenity and loved the movie.
I:10014;4434;Saw the series, loved that too.
I:10014;4435;and, well, you get the picture.
I:10014;4436;"serenity is a great scifi story with lots of unexpected twists and turns that keeps the mind not only asking ""what's next?"""
I:10014;4437;It's an intriguing mystery with fascinating characters and mind.
I:10014;4438;The special features are great for fans.
I:10014;4439;This is an incredible movie.
I:10014;4440;Besides, Firefly is probably the best space action.
I:10014;4441;comedy available and you won't be wasting your time.
I:10014;4442;This movie is visually stunning and the perfect complement to the series.
I:10014;4443;This is a great movie to watch on Blu.
I:10014;4444;Just got it in the mail and popped it into my BD player and wow!!
I:10014;4445;It has a lot of extras and I like the organization of everything .
I:10014;4446;"so smooth and clear and easy to use, how you can ""play all"" of a lot of the extra features."
I:10014;4447;Also if you leave it playing in your BD player after the movie is over, after a few minutes, it goes silent and has a nice Universal Icon rotating against a nice quiet background.
I:10014;4448;I totally enjoyed the movie like new.
I:10014;4449;Great ripping scifi fantasy yarn.
I:10014;4450;Great characters and great story telling.
I:10014;4451;Just the right amounts of action, comedy, thrills, horror, drama, romance and violence.
I:10014;4452;Also, unlike one idiot said earlier, the viewing of the TV series is completely unneccesary to enjoy this A grade movie.
I:10014;4453;What an original story, great relatively unknown cast, good effects, and engaging dialogue.
I:10014;4454;for the price, it's a great movie to add to your collection.
I:10014;4455;Great as a group movie or to watch by yourself late at night.
I:10014;4456;"with superb special effects, great cinematography, a gripping plot and very engaging characters, ""Serenity"" was a superb piece of science fiction and higly deserving of a 5 out of 5 star rating."
I:10014;4457;A great follow up .
I:10014;4458;Finally someone (Universal)has backed a guy with some serious talent.
I:10014;4459;He had to appeal to a hearty fan following, and bring in people who were new to the product.
I:10014;4460;"from the fan side of things, not only are you battling their desire to see more of their beloved ""Firefly."""
I:10014;4461;But you are also at odds with the anticipation of the new episode.
I:10014;4462;Ultimately though, from the fan perspective, I believe the movie is a roaring success.
I:10014;4463;Rarely do we see the mischief.
I:10014;4464;Credit Whedon and Nathan Fillion for taking that kind of a chance with their leading man.
I:10014;4465;One of the great elements of the series was the occasional Wash wisecrack.
I:10014;4466;Her one big moment comes off more like her one big half.
I:10014;4467;The big, out for himself, lug has some fun lines.
I:10014;4468;And he seems uncharacteristically heroic in the action scenes.
I:10014;4469;The rest of the time, he's Jayne.
I:10014;4470;The good doc gets more to do than some of his shipmates.
I:10014;4471;Summer Glau acquits herself fairly well in the action sequences.
I:10014;4472;She's a dancer, and Whedon took full advantage of that with the fight choreography.
I:10014;4473;Morena Baccarin looks great on screen.
I:10014;4474;Gets a couple of nice little scenes with Mal.
I:10014;4475;The vast majority of the film plays out very well.
I:10014;4476;"If people let go of the ""failed TV series"" thing, they should have a good two hours."
I:10014;4477;Serenity is a great follow up to the best Sci.
I:10014;4478;One of the best movies.
I:10014;4479;I love the series Firefly so much.
I:10014;4480;This is a great franchise.
I:10014;4481;One of the best sci fi movies.
I:10014;4482;the story line / script and charachters will defintely be timeless, in terms of value.
I:10014;4483;The visuals were stunning and colors rich and with depth.
I:10014;4484;This movie continues the amazing and dynamic Firefly story, which has still not achieved the greatness it deserves.
I:10014;4485;interesting characters of the Serenity crew in a stunning and seat.
I:10014;4486;serenity is an amazing, must.
I:10014;4487;fi experience what will leave your mouth open and create chills up your spine.
I:10014;4488;This is a great movie and it is in good condition too.
I:10014;4489;i could talk about the universe, or the characters, but what makes Serenity so fantastic is good old movie craftsmanship.
I:10014;4490;i liked the concept: cowboys in space.
I:10014;4491;the cast is richly used, no small feat when there's so many: Zoe (Gina Torres) and her pilot.
I:10014;4492;river is the primary focus of the film.
I:10014;4493;She is an escaped test subject and a super weapon in her own right, but it's the knowledge locked in her head that is so dangerous to the oppressive Alliance.
I:10014;4494;so cool he could be straight from Equilibrium, and that's saying something.
I:10014;4495;The Operative believes in old style honor and the value of a dream.
I:10014;4496;serenity is Whedon's masterpiece, but make no mistake: it's because the director knows his medium and knows it well.
I:10014;4497;It's in this tightly produced film, rather than the series, that the cast and Whedon finally gel to make the best damn science fiction film in recent years.
I:10014;4498;Notice how highly rated this movie is across the internet?
I:10014;4499;Endearing characters and some of the best.
I:10014;4500;Certainly worth at least a trilogy!
I:10014;4501;I would really like to see more from this interesting 'verse.
I:10014;4502;Serenity manages to do a fine job, those new to the Firefly saga quickly learn the essential backstory while hardcore fans are still entertained during the formative part of the film.
I:10014;4503;formed and interesting characters created by Whedon, the cast really makes them appealing and identifiable.
I:10014;4504;You feel like you actually known these people and you understand their actions and emotions.
I:10014;4505;Loved the series and the movie was a fitting ending.
I:10014;4506;The greatest show no one watched is also a worth watching a few times in blu.
I:10014;4507;Loved the movie on many levels.
I:10014;4508;The dialog was unique and witty that invites you to listen, really listen to what is and how it is being said.
I:10014;4509;I really enjoyed River's feet and the attention to show grace under pressure.
I:10014;4510;Joss captured the elegance and beauty of River's wanting to interact with the outside world on her terms.
I:10014;4511;The movie is labor of love and the baby is beautiful.
I:10014;4512;this is a great spinoff from firefly the series.
I:10014;4513;I took a friend to see it who had never seen firefly, now they want to see the series.
I:10014;4514;hope this is to become a franchise, we need more great scfi
I:10014;4515;Each one more endearing than the other, I laughed, got all stressed out and cried.
I:10014;4516;Totally the finest SciFi ever made.
I:10014;4517;(Fire Fly) if you enjoyed the movie you will love the series.
I:10014;4518;that said, it is still a good closure on the series, and offers a last opportunity to say good.
I:10014;4519;Prior knowledge of Firefly immensely improves the movie experience but overall: just pure awesome.
I:10014;4520;"now odds are I was going to like ""Serenity"", but what amazed me is how MUCH I liked it."
I:10014;4521;Quite simply, the movie was fantastic on a number of levels.
I:10014;4522;it's exciting, well paced, doesn't trade action for story (or character) development and vice versa.
I:10014;4523;The extended cast (nine actors returning from the TV show) wear their characters well, the story is captivating, the dialog is well scripted, and the movie feels great.
I:10014;4524;This is something that's really hard to capture and was perhaps most impressive to me.
I:10014;4525;But suffice to say based soley on the movie, this one is well worth the investment.
I:10014;4526;That sums up the stances of the two sides perfectly.
I:10014;4527;takes, and plenty of extras detailed elsewhere.
I:10014;4528;The cast commentary is one of the most entertaining commentaries I've heard.
I:10014;4529;The film is grand in scope and well executed.
I:10014;4530;This is not a religious film, but it is a film about belief and love.
I:10014;4531;The bottom line is, this movie and the extras are a lot of fun.
I:10014;4532;Sit back, relax, and enjoy it.
I:10014;4533;Even better than I remember it the first time around.
I:10014;4534;Fantastic story and amazing acting.
I:10014;4535;If you haven't seen it see it now and you will be hooked.
I:10014;4536;"I enjoyed the TV series ""Firefly"" and I enjoy the movie, but one of the problems with movies is the noise from the other patrons."
I:10014;4537;"if you do a Google search for ""Chinese used in Firefly and Serenity"" you can get translation for the Chinese used, some is quite rude but amusing."
I:10014;4538;"Filled with action, science fiction, and humor, ""Serenity"" is a highly entertaining movie experience."
I:10014;4539;joss Whedon, creator and first.
I:10014;4540;"time director, has crafted a highly entertaining tale that can be enjoyed by ""Firefly"" fans and newcomers alike."
I:10014;4541;"names, Whedon has crafted a tale that is reminisent of the first ""Star Wars"" film."
I:10014;4542;I, for one, hope that we will see the spaceship Serenity again.
I:10014;4543;That said, Serenity was the next best thing.
I:10014;4544;I enjoyed the subtle overlaps and variations that made the movie stand alone.
I:10014;4545;It is an entertaining blend of Western and Space adventures for folks with an open mind.
I:10014;4546;The epic conclusion was a poignent ending to a great story.
I:10014;4547;I loved it, but personally prefer the more comfortable setting of the TV show:Firefly .
I:10014;4548;fiction series blended with a nostalgic western style to its storylines.
I:10014;4549;up with Universal Pictures to spawn a full.
I:10014;4550;inspiring scripts to grace domestic movie theatres with its presence in the last few years, let alone this year.
I:10014;4551;The dialogue is especially crisp and brilliantly crafted with each of the characters and their actions onscreen.
I:10014;4552;While their performances are pretty much the same as they were on the small screen, not a complaint in the least, each performer seems to take their role up a notch in the transition to the silver screen.
I:10014;4553;Nathan Fillion is one of the major stars of the picture and the one likely to benefit the most from Serenity's critical acclaim.
I:10014;4554;Chiwetel Ejiofor is the perfect adversary to Captain Malcolm Reynolds, an avowed atheist, in the role of The Operative simply because unlike Reynolds he believes adamantly in what he is fighting for.
I:10014;4555;He is perfectly admirable, relinquishing his `sword' so to speak at the end when the cause he has fought valiantly for has been defeated.
I:10014;4556;And Summer Glau is wonderful in the role of River Tam.
I:10014;4557;"There are moments, in particular a scene in which the crew returns from a heist and she delivers the line, ""I swallowed a bug"", where she is perfectly adorable."
I:10014;4558;Hopefully she will have more opportunities to work in feature films thanks to this film.
I:10014;4559;overall, Serenity, whether it is viewed by certified Brown Coats or green horns, is an innovative motion.
I:10014;4560;picture event, a true rarity in a year overflowing with lifeless big.
I:10014;4561;budget action flicks and extraneous sequels, with something for nearly everyone, from breathtaking special effects and solid performances to splashes of well.
I:10014;4562;timed dark humor and inspiration religious message every audience member no matter what their religious affiliation can take to heart.
I:10014;4563;Series creator and film director Joss Whedon, a man quite familiar with using theological subtexts within his works, designed Serenity specifically as a means in which to answer the question his now.
I:10014;4564;The driving force behind the power of belief is that we as human beings conceptualize of a greater power in the universe, greater then ourselves, which controls every aspect of our lives down to our very actions.
I:10014;4565;nine million dollars according to studio estimates, the special effects, in particular the stunning aerial acrobatic chase sequence near the end of the film, are positively stunning.
I:10014;4566;Furthermore, Serenity's musical score, a wonderful blending of nostalgic western ballads and mysterious futuristic accompaniments, is brilliantly composed by David Newman.
I:10014;4567;Serenity benefits substantially from a brilliantly witty and charming script from series creator Joss Whedon.
I:10014;4568;Its effective combination of humor, action, and heart make it a must see for any fan of science.
I:10014;4569;English and Chinese cultures combined in a most imaginative fashion.
I:10014;4570;Serenity takes the series up to a whole new level and it packs a wallop of a good time and come on, Joss Whedon knows how to please his fans of Firefly and of course Buffy and Angel.
I:10014;4571;"Their picked up by Serenity, and the crew consists of Captain Malcolm ""Mal"" Reynolds, played by the always fantastic Nathan Fillion (Tv's Buffy, Water's Edge) and he is superb here, the pilot Wash, played by funny man Alan Tudyk (Dodgeball, 28 Days) and his wife Zoey, played by Gina Torres (Tv's Angel, Matrix Revolutions)."
I:10014;4572;Kaylee Frye, played by the adorable Jewel Staite who's an engineer and knows a lot about ships and how to fix them and who also is in love with Doctor Simon Tam.
I:10014;4573;that's if they make it in time, and alive.
I:10014;4574;even better then Firefly, filled with that great Joss Whedon touch of humor, action, romance and drama.
I:10014;4575;One of the best movies of the year so far, by far greater then, yes I am saying this and I mean it, Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith.
I:10014;4576;the first one wasnt that great.
I:10014;4577;It's great for a Sci Fi, blood and guts movie, but it destroys the enjoyment of the Fire Fly series.
I:10014;4578;If a well edited version came out, then I'ld recommend it.
I:10014;4579;I found this movie to be a great continuation of the Firefly series.
I:10014;4580;I was happy when I got to see the characters together again.
I:10014;4581;this flick certainly ranks up there with the Star Wars series in my book.
I:10014;4582;Solid acting, good chemistry between the cast, great story line, excellent special effects and nail.
I:10014;4583;the movie is so good, you will come to care about the Serenity crew, laugh and possibly cry at the situations they are in too.
I:10014;4584;well made movies like this deserve a second viewing.
I:10014;4585;You will get your money's worth seeing this film!
I:10014;4586;From the outset her character does a lot more than she had in the series up to that point, and Summer Glau does a great job with it.
I:10014;4587;There are funny moments within tense moments (that are even funnier if you have the background from the series), and the acting and writing are both top notch.
I:10014;4588;The movie on its own is very good, the movie after having watched the series in the order the series was meant to be seen is awesome.
I:10014;4589;For what it was trying to do (tell the entire story of what could have been spread out over multiple TV seasons in two hours), the movie accomplished that very well.
I:10014;4590;It will forever be relegated to cult classic status, but if you give it a chance you will be glad you did.
I:10014;4591;This is the only movie i have ever watched where every time i watch it, i am amazed at how fantastic of a movie is.
I:10014;4592;i recommend this movie to everybody, even people who dont like SiFi movies.
I:10014;4593;If you like Firefly, the tv series that Serenity was based off of, then you will love this movie.
I:10014;4594;space adventure so as to more than satisfy fans of the show, which I recommend watching first (it helps explain some of the emotions and interactions between characters in the film).
I:10014;4595;"Without having seen Firefly's one partial season the movie is still fascinating and informed viewers will enjoy the ""[uni]verse"" finally focusing on the possibly government mind."
I:10014;4596;"Though its missing the ""unpleasant slavery associations"" this seems a reasonable picture of the south and I would not worry, but the additional deletion of American Indian issues from the universe of Serenity is transforms the final message of the series and movie from the brilliant seemingly Foucault inspired insights Joss is capable of."
I:10014;4597;red vision the Reavers represent a portion of us each, each of us being oppressed by the US government, but some of have a harder time with it.

I:10014;4599;"lived series ""Firefly,"" as well as a valentine to the thousands of fans who refused to let the show die after the Fox Network canceled it in 2002."
I:10014;4600;"the main value of ""Serenity"" to fans."
I:10014;4601;besides reuniting the cast and allowing a bigger budget for special effects.
I:10014;4602;whedon's writing is as sharp as ever, as are the performances of the ensemble cast.
I:10014;4603;"deprecating introduction to the movie and scenes from the appearance of Whedon and the ""Serenity"" cast at a ComicCon convention."
I:10014;4604;It is touching and heartening to see them engulfed by the love of their fans.
I:10014;4605;"I hope so, this series has ""hooked"" me like Star Trek did in the 1960's and Star Wars did in the 1970's."
I:10014;4606;Good movie, but to understand it you should have seen the firefly series.
I:10014;4607;I started watching the Firefly series because I love Buffy and Angel and I figured if Joss Whedon is behind it, it must be good.
I:10014;4608;fi fan exactly, although I do enjoy the genre.
I:10014;4609;The characters and dialogue are the heart of this movie, and you really care what happens.
I:10014;4610;I was satisfied with the River story as that was the burning question after the series.
I:10014;4611;fi fan to love this movie or series.
I:10014;4612;You just have to love a great story.
I:10014;4613;One of my favorite movies of all time!
I:10014;4614;The show Firefly was excellent and the movie based on the show is even better.
I:10014;4615;A very fresh story for sci.
I:10014;4616;and if you can't do something smart, do something right.
I:10014;4617;you all watched with interest (purchasing is better).
I:10014;4618;If you love it, there will be more for you to love.
I:10014;4619;If you didn't, you watched with hope anyway and the continuation of the series or the movie can keep that hope alive.
I:10014;4620;fi network), ABC, CBS, the CW, USA, TNT.
I:10014;4621;you will love the rest of the movie .
I:10014;4622;This is a great movie!
I:10014;4623;western and turned up the seriousness more than a notch (think of a Roger Moore James Bond film improved up to a Daniel Craig James Bond film), and with the addition of movie.
I:10014;4624;"comparisons to ""Star Wars"" are valid, in that George Lucas took several, infinitely familiar themes, scenarios and characters, and combined them into a creation clearly his own."
I:10014;4625;the characters are simply a delight to watch interact with each other.
I:10014;4626;Nathan Fillion, as the leader of the band, Mal Reynolds, is one of the great, recent heroes of filmdom.
I:10014;4627;He's got the gravitas, the humor, the physicality.
I:10014;4628;"You will love spending more time with these guys.yes, most of them (in this film) are carefully drawn with a few lines and scenes
I:10014;4629;"the actress playing Inora ""the companion"" (Morena Baccarin)is one of the most startlingly beautiful actresses I've ever seen."
I:10014;4630;She's given a criminally small amount of screen time and should have been a bigger part of this film.
I:10014;4631;whedon's film serves the story, and serves it well.
I:10014;4632;He also tidies up many of the over.
I:10014;4633;"carrying automaton combine to form a genuinely terrifying set of ""bad guys""."
I:10014;4634;the action scenes are marvelous.
I:10014;4635;the chase scenes in space are breathtaking.
I:10014;4636;I loved the punctuating silences as opposed to the expected bombastic whooshes and crashes.
I:10014;4637;the terrestrial hovercraft chase is a model of how things like this should be done.
I:10014;4638;that add enormously to the movie.
I:10014;4639;And of course, some phenomenal acting.
I:10014;4640;It's a brilliant bit of writing and acting.
I:10014;4641;this is a most impressive creation by Joss Whedon, and it would truly be a shame if this were to be the last we ever see of the Serenity crew.
I:10014;4642;This is a great movie that wraps up the series FireFly.
I:10014;4643;i love the humor in the midst of an action filled movie.
I:10014;4644;Look if you are going to see this for the first time, your in for a treat.
I:10014;4645;It may be a double dip, but the extras are well worth it.
I:10014;4646;easily accessable for Scifi fans and non fans of the show.
I:10014;4647;This is one of the best movies of 2005.
I:10014;4648;I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys scifi.
I:10014;4649;Gem of a sci fi film.
I:10014;4650;where lucas relied on antiseptic, cgi worlds, whedon's worlds are organic and real, and it gives the movie a lot more credibility.
I:10014;4651;the movie absolutely benefits from it.
I:10014;4652;whedon is also great at directing his actors.
I:10014;4653;i watched 'serenity' a second time with whedon's commentary (he's a joy to listen to, by the way.
I:10014;4654;effacing humor, wit, and warmth), and he talked about how he'd often reshoot scenes dozens of times until he had the take he wanted.
I:10014;4655;the actors, for their part, are great.
I:10014;4656;nathan fillion's 'mal' is the ideal gang.
I:10014;4657;the crew (i don't know all their names yet) are fantastic in his or her own way.
I:10014;4658;zoe and wash's marriage is sweet, kaylee's crush on simon is sincere, jayne's machismo is stereotypical but believable, and inara, well, she's just hot.
I:10014;4659;you can tell the actors love what they're doing and it makes you pull for them all the more.
I:10014;4660;she's one heckuva an actress.
I:10014;4661;glau's training as a dancer obviously benefits the character.
I:10014;4662;she does a beautiful job of balancing the her role as a human weapon and the holder of terrible secrets.
I:10014;4663;he injects a lot of geniune warmth and humor.
I:10014;4664;each character, it seems, has a foil.
I:10014;4665;and whedon fully takes advantage of it.
I:10014;4666;the banter is great, witty, and just plain fun.
I:10014;4667;in all, 'serenity' is a great film, one i wish i had seen on the big screen.
I:10014;4668;i don't think anymore sequels are likely, but it'd be nice to see one some day.
I:10014;4669;thanks, joss and co.(it makes me sad to wonder what star wars would've been like in whedon's hands.
I:10014;4670;"It tied up all the loose ends from the ""Firefly"" series and yet would stand on its own as a good movie."
I:10014;4671;Many people have recommended it to me, but I finally got around to watching it, and this movie really ties up the series quite well.
I:10014;4672;Really, this is one of the best Sci.
I:10014;4673;Its fresh, fun, and you don't need to be a sci.
I:10014;4674;fi fan to enjoy it.
I:10014;4675;"Completes the series ""Firefly"" nicely."
I:10014;4676;"A ""must see"" for Firefly series fans."
I:10014;4677;I keep running into sci.
I:10014;4678;written for a more mature audience.
I:10014;4679;Think you will enjoy at any age.
I:10014;4680;If you loved the show, you definitely has to watch this!
I:10014;4681;It's not as good as the show but it does a decent job.
I:10014;4682;I am so glad that Joss Wheadon decided to make this movie so that we the fans could have some closure after the end of a great show.
I:10014;4683;This film is a great edition to the series firefly.
I:10014;4684;The same cast, writers and director of the Firefly series finally have given us the full.
I:10014;4685;Lots of insider information and extras as well as the incredible movie.
I:10014;4686;This is a wonderful follow up to one of the best series ever made.
I:10014;4687;When there are over 3000 reviews and it's still got 5 stars over all, that tells you it's good.
I:10014;4688;The finishing touch to an enjoyable series.
I:10014;4689;Fast paced, a light touch of humor, and poignancy.
I:10014;4690;A great movie to finish off a great TV show.
I:10014;4691;I loved all the characters, the witty dialogue, awesome fight scenes, nice SFX, and the non.
I:10014;4692;I really felt like I knew these characters after watching this two hour film.
I:10014;4693;fi, action, western, and comedy all rolled together in a beautiful balance.
I:10014;4694;This is easily one of the best films I have seen this year, and without question, the best time I had at the movies this year for sure.
I:10014;4695;I love this movie and Firefly.
I:10014;4696;wow i thought your shipping was gonna be late but thnx!!!
I:10014;4697;Serenity is a great movie even if you're not a sci.
I:10014;4698;I'm a huge Star Trek fan but I have to admit Firefly and Serenity are more interesting and realistic.
I:10014;4699;The future presented in Firefly/Serenity is much more probable which makes the entire series more approachable and enjoyable.
I:10014;4700;why did you cancel one of the best tv shows around?
I:10014;4701;Fun to watch and one of the best young actresses has a leading role.
I:10014;4702;Summer Glau who we loved in the tv show the Terminator played her part to perfection.
I:10014;4703;The story moves fast and is action packed!
I:10014;4704;Great effects, great humor, and great loss.
I:10014;4705;but it ended on a high.
I:10014;4706;I got this movie and the Firefly series since the review were soooo good.
I:10014;4707;But right now I rather watch Castle when I have a moment to watch TV than this.
I:10014;4708;The series is the finest ever on television, in my opinion.
I:10014;4709;Help fund the possiblity of a triumphant return from Firefly!
I:10014;4710;alone film, the story telling, action, and characters are first rate.
I:10014;4711;"When compared to poorly written and acted movies like ""Revenge of the Sith"" this is a far better movie."
I:10014;4712;While I know people who enjoyed the movie as an introduction to Firefly, to best appreciate the unfolding richness of the Firefly 'verse, pick up the series first.
I:10014;4713;Commentary by Joss is always fun and informative.
I:10014;4714;I am so happy I gave this movie a chance.
I:10014;4715;"Serenity tells a story about family (the crew)
I:10014;4716;In the end, you take an emotional ride with the crew of this ship.
I:10014;4717;i strongly recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good story, told well, by a talented group of lesser.
I:10014;4718;My friend is in love with this movie, and she wants sequals made.
I:10014;4719;I keep writing episodes in my mind.
I:10014;4720;This movie is an extreamly fun time.
I:10014;4721;This movie has it all: action, humor, mystery, great characters, drama.
I:10014;4722;Do yourself and favor and go see this movie!
I:10014;4723;This movie is a conclusion to the 'Firefly' series and satisfies my need for an end to a story.
I:10014;4724;They worked to make a classic.
I:10014;4725;Which means I am COMPLETELY and utterly in love with the Firefly universe and everything in it, this movie included.
I:10014;4726;And the price is great too.
I:10014;4727;picture commentary which was kinda fun.
I:10014;4728;If you're a Browncoat then it's definitely worth the couple bucks to add this to your collection.
I:10014;4729;Firefly fans the world over can look forward to the fun of revisiting their characters in their BIG screen incarnation, having many of their answers solved, and to more trademark Joss Whedon storytelling trickery alternately misleading or revealing various unexpected plot twists .
I:10014;4730;What's more, unlike most movie style sci.
I:10014;4731;"i went with a couple of similar ""Firefly"" fanatics, like me eager to see how the story trail would be picked up."
I:10014;4732;For myself, I walked away feeling that Joss Whedon is a real gift to genre based story telling.
I:10014;4733;to remind us of the personal cost to our protagonists of the events into which they have been swept.
I:10014;4734;"My other ""Firefly"" buddy Nathan and I in the car on the drive home felt that perhaps Whedon's real skills are best expressed in the more expansive format provided by series television ."
I:10014;4735;Still, it's great entertainment, and I'll be in the cinemas again in the next few days to see it again.
I:10014;4736;fiction goes, and takes place shortly after this film.
I:10014;4737;i live in the U. k and have just got back from watching and for me this film represents the way big movies should be, big story, big charictors and big explosions.
I:10014;4738;Every frame of this is packed with smart dialogue, imagination, style, action, drama, and adventure.
I:10014;4739;The most important moment for a hero, whether it comes in a comic book, a television series, a novel, or a movie, is when everyone realizes that they're looking at a hero.
I:10014;4740;In Joss Whedon's film 'Serenity', he gives us such a moment, and it's the kind that inspires goosebumps, tingles, and lumps in the throat.
I:10014;4741;Some of the elements are right off the shelf (just reach in blindly and close your hand around a dozen or so), and the fugitive brother and sister hitching a ride with a smuggler on a goofy.
I:10014;4742;away from an enormously powerful and evil intergalactic organization might sound a bit familiar, but the story is thoroughly engrossing.
I:10014;4743;Nathan Fillion and Jewel Staite, in particular, throw out the kind of cheeky, out.
I:10014;4744;line humor that fans of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' will appreciate.
I:10014;4745;She has helped create a haunting, original character who, understandably, has an adoring cult following.
I:10014;4746;Joss Whedon has a thing for female characters who seem fragile, seem to need the protection of those around them, then emerge as suprisingly strong and capable just when the others need, well, a hero.
I:10014;4747;When River's moment arrives, she is equal to the challenge.
I:10014;4748;"I wish I could give it 4.5 stars
I:10014;4749;With 'Serenity', Joss Whedon has a story that cannot be told in any other way, and his film is a success because he makes creative and effective use of the genre to serve his needs.
I:10014;4750;The clarity, sound and menus make this an awesome, must.
I:10014;4751;This movie really defies categorization, which is what makes it so fun to watch.
I:10014;4752;At it's core it is really a Western, but the setting is in outer space and it has Zombie Slashers!
I:10014;4753;Josh Whedon did a great job in assembling an ensemble and providing each one with a unique character that is both entertaining and believable as a person.
I:10014;4754;plotting and pacing is fantastic, although there are a few edits in the action sequences that are a bit confusing as to what exactly is going on, and a couple pivotal words of the dialogue is garbled to my damaged ears.
I:10014;4755;But overall, a great film.
I:10014;4756;It didn't really add any new info to anyone steeped in the 'verse, but seeing Joss Whedon playing off an audience when you haven't in the flesh is a worthwhile special feature.
I:10014;4757;I wish the movie was longer because the story was very good and the characters were very well developed.
I:10014;4758;Just about a perfect tale of goodies and bad guys set in a distant star system, if you like adventure and fast moving action thenthis is for youHighly recommended
I:10014;4759;We enjoyed the movie very much.
I:10014;4760;Although I wasn't necessarily happy with the ending of the movie, it was well done and enjoyable to watch.
I:10014;4761;Fab, well worth watching if you liked the series, always funny and ingredibly enjoyable.
I:10014;4762;He and his motley crew are sheltering a woman and her brother from the Alliance.
I:10014;4763;The effects, the photography, the music, all are satisfyingly big screen, while making us enjoy everything we loved on the small screen.
I:10014;4764;If you are a fan of the series or have never seen the series, you will enjoy this movie.
I:10014;4765;It has action, science fiction, fun, and even romance.
I:10014;4766;The story flows and there are a few surprises .
I:10014;4767;This is Joss Whedon at his best.
I:10014;4768;"and giving away the original TV series box set, ""Firefly"", to friends and family as gifts."
I:10014;4769;I was rewarded with this film.
I:10014;4770;I adored every single moment of this film.
I:10014;4771;"when I first tagged the title ""Browncoat"" to my sleeve, I had a sense of belonging to something special."
I:10014;4772;If you've never been a part of our 'verse, then see this film.
I:10014;4773;for fans this is a necesssity.
I:10014;4774;We had to have a conclusion and it was worth the wait.
I:10014;4775;In a year of great science fiction disappointments (Star Wars:RotS, Hitchhiker's Guide) there has been one standout film.
I:10014;4776;It's well written, well acted, and was well worth watching.
I:10014;4777;the story centers around River Tam, a 17 year old girl with tremendous intelligence, physical prowess, and some psychic ability.
I:10014;4778;i really enjoyed the movie.
I:10014;4779;the actors work very well together and play their parts very well.
I:10014;4780;The people who really stand out are Nathan Fillion, Summer Glau, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.
I:10014;4781;You can see Mal's struggle in the writing, but Nathan does a great job bringing the conflict to life in his interactions with the crew.
I:10014;4782;Nathan really makes Mal a believable character.
I:10014;4783;"She really stands out for two reasons: she plays River very well
I:10014;4784;River evolves nicely during the movie from a young woman with no grasp on reality to a woman who's starting regain some grasp.
I:10014;4785;The fight scenes involving River are extremely physical .
I:10014;4786;they involve martial arts, weapons, and gymnastics.
I:10014;4787;Chiwetel makes him seem very charming, sophisticated, and intelligent.
I:10014;4788;He really reminds me of some of the classic James Bond villains.
I:10014;4789;It's almost impossible to hate this character and that's large due to the fine work of the actor.
I:10014;4790;Serenity is very entertaining even if you haven't seen the series, but even more delightful if you have.
I:10014;4791;The Actors and the Characters they portray will keep you coming back to watch this again and again.
I:10014;4792;On top of tying up loose ends from the Firefly series, it`s a very good stand alone film.
I:10014;4793;It has a good story and a decentplot.
I:10014;4794;Sure it get a bit goofy in spots, but all in all it`s a very good film.
I:10014;4795;with this many 5 star reviews.)
I:10014;4796;Excellent story and very well told, fantastic cast and put together by people for whom this whole project was obviously a labor of love.
I:10014;4797;budget to work with makes this a BETTER film because they weren't tempted to rely too much on eye candy and instead focused on making a great film.
I:10014;4798;And I love the fact that it's such a huge success (again, check the reviews.)
I:10014;4799;Joss Whedon carries on his wonderful humor from the Angel series.
I:10014;4800;cudos for adding a sharp sense of humor.
I:10014;4801;fi fan, also liked them both.
I:10014;4802;The characters are fresh, alive and intense, the special effects are great, the writing is superb.
I:10014;4803;And I might add, the best SciFi movie made in many years.
I:10014;4804;I thank Universal for letting Firely soar again.
I:10014;4805;I find the characters compelling, the villain menacing, the action enthralling and the concept visionary.
I:10014;4806;If you love a good sci.
I:10014;4807;Ten + years later it is still revered by a broad spectrum of the public.
I:10014;4808;This is how a sci.
I:10014;4809;The lines are crisp, the action is great, the back.
I:10014;4810;story helps establish the movie's environment, the CGI is effective and used wisely (meaning that we don't have old men doing back flips just to skip using the stairs and actors are not surrounded by awful CGI environments), and the acting is good for the kinda movie it is.
I:10014;4811;FUN like Star Wars was, The Thing was, Body Snatchers was, and the countless other movies that helped establish the genre from the '50's and on.
I:10014;4812;I for one hope Universal will allow this to become a franchise series, it is worth it.
I:10014;4813;This film is classic Joss Whedon and will leave you breathless at the end as if you were in on the action.
I:10014;4814;But the series is just that good.
I:10014;4815;if you haven't seen it before the movie, I'll guarantee you will afterwards.
I:10014;4816;fi shows is the ship and scenes are much more realistic and believable.
I:10014;4817;sounding language which is a sweet way to keep the ratings and yet be believable.
I:10014;4818;There's first and foremost Shepard Book, the preacher with the mysterious past, played wonderfully by Ron Glass in the series and who has way too short a role in the film.
I:10014;4819;(Oldsters will remember that Glass played a detective in the comedy Barney Miller.)
I:10014;4820;Inara, a companion, is a Buddhist.
I:10014;4821;And Mr. Universe, a pirate broadcaster, has a Jewish wedding with his robot companion.
I:10014;4822;She is a psychic and they have tried to tap into her brain.
I:10014;4823;, you'll cry and yes, you'll cheer.
I:10014;4824;fi movie and it will give you a lot to ponder later.
I:10014;4825;I have loved Joss Whedon for over a third of my life.
I:10014;4826;"I had extremely high expectations for his theatrical directorial debut, and I am very happy to say that ""Serenity"" more than exceeded all my expectations."
I:10014;4827;"But I was skeptical as to how successfully Joss could introduce the characters and their ""verse"" to first timers while adding something new and relevant to the story for those of us who have enjoyed the adventures of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his crew for years now."
I:10014;4828;Joss's cast and characters have a comaraderie about them that is uniquely Joss and uniquely fun.
I:10014;4829;"He did it with Buffy, he did it again with Angel, he did if for a third (and possibly most successful) time with Firefly, and he continues it with his work on Marvel Comics comic book, ""Astonishing X. men."""
I:10014;4830;"There is a familial warmth that is undeniable, and it is part of what makes the film ""Serenity"" so spectacular."
I:10014;4831;this movie is the kind of movie that one can truly watch over and over and over again.
I:10014;4832;"The witty quips and dialogue of this movie are unparalleled in every other movie ever, with the possible exception of ""Army of Darkness."""
I:10014;4833;man, Jayne, obvious funnyman, Wash, Mal himself, or any of the other brilliant characters, this movie is hilarious.
I:10014;4834;In a very intelligent and surprising way.
I:10014;4835;The humor just adds to the plot which took my breath away with its intricacies and perfection.
I:10014;4836;fi, westerns, comedy, action, romance, or whatever, this movie is for you.
I:10014;4837;"The visuals in this epic film are on par with films that cost literally hundreds more millions of dollars to make (ie all three Star Wars Prequels) so I say go all out and get widescreen to take in all the gorgeous beauty that is ""Serenity."""
I:10014;4838;But even in full screen format it's still worth every penny.
I:10014;4839;I actually saw this movie before I even heard about the series, so you definitely don't have to watch the series to appreciate the film.
I:10014;4840;but never was I able to see the first half!
I:10014;4841;Others have written more eloquently about it, so I suggest you read their reviews and ignore mine.
I:10014;4842;I certainly recommend it, and also recommend the series Firefly if you've never seen it.
I:10014;4843;"I actually saw this movie long before I finally saw the complete season of ""Firefly"", and the second time watching it means that it made so much more sense to me!"
I:10014;4844;All of the characters are really strong, there's a perfect balance of the serious with the humorous, and one thing I absolutely love is that the special effects are there to support the story and not put in as a tribute to themselves.
I:10014;4845;"I would love Joss Whedon to make another movie or to make a new season featuring the ""Firefly"" cast
I:10014;4846;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:10014;4847;I'm a big Firefly fan.
I:10014;4848;not a fanatical one, but I really found this show extremely entertaining.
I:10014;4849;The writing and acting were top.
I:10014;4850;I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good comedy.
I:10014;4851;I really liked the series.
I:10014;4852;This exemplary continuation of the Fox television series Firefly proves that a TV.
I:10014;4853;lived series), Serenity (which shares its name with the program's beloved ship) is a science.
I:10014;4854;comedy with a classic Western feel that delivers in each of its numerous genre categories, while simultaneously refreshing viewers with relatable characters and a convincing script.
I:10014;4855;As was the case on the show, Nathan Fillion steals the spotlight as the goofy, yet legendary captain, Malcolm Reynolds.
I:10014;4856;I thoroughly enjoyed the series Firefly.
I:10014;4857;It did a good job of bringing things together and tying up those ends.
I:10014;4858;Anyway, it was a good story.
I:10014;4859;I love the Firefly characters and thats what the show was all about.
I:10014;4860;I like that they shed more light onto River's story.
I:10014;4861;I hope it comes back in some form one day.
I:10014;4862;It's definitely worth your time.
I:10014;4863;Definitely answered some questions left by Firefly.
I:10014;4864;There is a LOT of awesome action and adventure.
I:10014;4865;Pretty much any work produced by Joss Whedon at this point deserves a look.
I:10014;4866;Most of what he puts his name on is worth watching.
I:10014;4867;Serenity was an excellent last episode too a series that ended years before its time.
I:10014;4868;"The new special features are all great
I:10014;4869;Taxi Driver came out last week with a great new collectors edition featuring a very nice, slim set with the perfect photos.
I:10014;4870;"behind the paper sheet that displays the bonus info, on the ""real"" back cover of the set, is a great cast photo."
I:10014;4871;"the coolest thing is that there is a clear piece of plastic on the front that has the photo of River, as well as the word ""Serenity""."
I:10014;4872;overall, the material is a lot better than the previous release.
I:10014;4873;I suppose it'll be nice to have such a big case for Serenity on my shelf, to draw attention to it.
I:10014;4874;If you haven't watched the series on which this movie is based on, then give it a chance and watch it first.
I:10014;4875;Overall a great movie and one that I can watch over and over again!
I:10014;4876;In that way, the film works even if you were never a fan of the series .
I:10014;4877;credit sequence is probably the most innovative in terms of storytelling .
I:10014;4878;the film packs several layers of information about the universe we are in and the nature of two central characters into just a few minutes, and it is both enjoyable and intriguing.
I:10014;4879;After that, while the story itself is clever, it begins to feel a bit more like a conventional episode from the TV series (which is still more inventive and fun than most movies and tv), until the last twenty minutes or so when the story explodes into something much bigger than a TV episode and becomes, well, very obviously a very good movie.
I:10014;4880;What I got was probably my favorite science fiction film in a number of years.
I:10014;4881;What makes this such an enjoyable film is that it doesn't take itself overly seriously.
I:10014;4882;The plot is good, the acting good to great, and the visuals are remarkable for a film with the budget size of this one.
I:10014;4883;the acting is very well done, beginning with Serenity's captain, a loose.
I:10014;4884;river, the psychic girl, is also very well cast.
I:10014;4885;She is believable as all three, and captivating to watch whether wielding ad.
I:10014;4886;There is an animal intensity to the way she plays River that is thrilling to watch.
I:10014;4887;the other major rolls are filled admirably with another interesting performance turned in by the film's main antagonist who goes simply by The Operative.
I:10014;4888;He is clever and intelligent, defying stereotypical enforcers from totalitarian regimes.
I:10014;4889;This is a good death, he tells the man responsible for River's escape as he takes his last few breaths impaled on a sword.
I:10014;4890;He is able to convey a sort of moral depth that gives his character a level of gravitas few cinema villains ever achieve.
I:10014;4891;while clich is present in the film, it is kept at a minimum through two very interesting methods.
I:10014;4892;style dialogue that is free from the more painful bits of sci.
I:10014;4893;This provides the film with a 'culture' that is distinct as well as entertaining.
I:10014;4894;It's a joy listening to the dialogue, and makes the movie worth watching more than a few times since you pick up on new things you might have missed the first time through.
I:10014;4895;The other thing that helps Serenity stay fresh throughout is the remarkable level of detail in the art direction.
I:10014;4896;While not the most original plot line ever conceived, it is more than adequate to let the best elements of the film shine: interesting, multifaceted characters, terrifically good writing, and beautiful art design.
I:10014;4897;fi film well worth owning.
I:10014;4898;My loss as I love good Sci.
I:10014;4899;Against the backdrop of the Firefly series it all makes perfect sense.
I:10014;4900;"that said, the movie was well done, and I said ""close to marvelous"" because while I couldn't quite put my finger on why I didn't enjoy it as much as the Firefly series, I still enjoyed it enough to give it 4 stars."
I:10014;4901;"Maybe Josh was telling us that ""that's it"" and there won't be any more, but I hated to see the door shut on some of the characters I enjoyed so much and wanted to see a lot more of."
I:10014;4902;in closing, I give it 4 Stars and recommend it highly, but strongly suggest you see Firefly first.
I:10014;4903;fi this is the moive for you as it is really a kind of genre hybrid of sci.
I:10014;4904;The characters are great and really well writen.
I:10014;4905;Great movie to watch with friends.
I:10014;4906;You've got to hand it to Joss Whedon.
I:10014;4907;Serenity, like Firefly before it, is everything that science fiction should be and then some: loaded with ideas and a sense of wonder and awe.
I:10014;4908;And because it's from the mind of Joss Whedon, you can expect Serenity to be everything something from Whedon should be: smart, loaded with snappy dialogue, intricately plotted, and full of memorable characters.
I:10014;4909;And what she knows can, and will, change everything.
I:10014;4910;All in all, Serenity is an excellent film and one of the finest moments of sci.
I:10014;4911;fi to appear in quite some time, and yes, it's so much better than anything lately to come out of a universe from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
I:10014;4912;Serenity is at once a fitting ending AND a promising beginning.
I:10014;4913;rat River and her brother Simon who risked everything, including a successful and prominent life in medicine, to save River from the government who was hurting her.
I:10014;4914;"the movie functions best to its target audience
I:10014;4915;A newcomer may still enjoy the movie very much, but would in all likely.
I:10014;4916;The best example is the small, but quite nice subplot in the movie that deals with Simon and Kaylee.
I:10014;4917;In fact, I was somewhat surprised Kaylee ended up being the movie's most entertaining character.
I:10014;4918;"in the end, ""Serenity"" is a fantastic sci."
I:10014;4919;fi film with great effects and action.
I:10014;4920;The witty, yet smart dialogue of Whedon is again a trademark of the film like the series.
I:10014;4921;Afterwards I felt like the movie had began a few weeks after the last episode of the show, and had wrapped up all the plotlines nicely.
I:10014;4922;It also sets up some new dynamics within the crew, and leaves the door open for a promising film franchise.
I:10014;4923;we can only hope, the studio is smarter than the network, and allows a sequel to occur.
I:10014;4924;I enjoyed it so much that I've ordered the entire series and 6 tee shirts!
I:10014;4925;I knew that it was by Joss Whedon, who is a genius in his own right.
I:10014;4926;I knew I could expect witty, outrageous humor, I knew I could expect depth in the characters and story lines.
I:10014;4927;the characters are amazing, the stories.
I:10014;4928;it is by far one of my favorite movies of the year.
I:10014;4929;It had action, that witty humor we all love and depth in the story and with the characters.
I:10014;4930;I laughed, I cried, I yelled (look behind you!
I:10014;4931;i found my serenity in Serenity.
I:10014;4932;My friends all liked this movie.
I:10014;4933;Yes, this movie was pretty good.
I:10014;4934;particularly the sexy little girl warrior that kicks guys' butts and the heavy conspiracy government cover.
I:10014;4935;But there's a reason Whedon is popular, he can certainly write, it's cool dialogue and action and his hero is someone Han Solo would hang out with.
I:10014;4936;the movie IS fun, original, thought.
I:10014;4937;of making it's point clearly.
I:10014;4938;The fans obviously get it .
I:10014;4939;the rest of us will have to be happy with the movie George Lucas should have given us years ago.
I:10014;4940;My personal preference is that Josh makes more movies like this, with a smidge more fun, a little more explanation, and a little more spit and polish .
I:10014;4941;This film is the best film Ive seen since the last Lord of the Rings movie.
I:10014;4942;What a fantastic tie in to the short lived but fantastic series.
I:10014;4943;It makes you laugh, cry and cheer all at the same time.
I:10014;4944;The writing is FANTASTIC and the acting INCREDIBLE!
I:10014;4945;I just hope that this movie will show everyone just how special this show really was.
I:10014;4946;It'll make the experience that much more rewarding.
I:10014;4947;After watching it I thought it was a pretty decent SciFi actioner with some pretty clever jokes thrown in.
I:10014;4948;existing affection for that crew.
I:10014;4949;Once I had that and went back to watch the film for a second time, it became very bittersweet to me, and, thusly, more important.
I:10014;4950;That was always something that I liked about the show and I did miss it somewhat in the film.
I:10014;4951;Serenity stands alone fine, but having the back story adds a bit.
I:10014;4952;That is the best line I can think of to describe this film.
I:10014;4953;Part of these characters' charm is their lack of heroic capability.
I:10014;4954;This was a great movie.
I:10014;4955;It was a wonderful, and masterfully executed, conclusion to one of the greatest TV series: Firefly.
I:10014;4956;The movie Serenity stands on its own as a great movie, but if you havent watched the Firefly series, then Id highly recommend it.
I:10014;4957;Not only for the simple fact that its an amazing show, but because it is actually the precursor to the movie.
I:10014;4958;this movie asks what would be a perfect world, and would it be what you thought if you got it?
I:10014;4959;Would it be worth the price?
I:10014;4960;Sure, it may sound similar to other stories, but this one is presented in a pretty unique way, and the characters are unforgettable.
I:10014;4961;But as a continuation of Firefly, its perfect
I:10014;4962;It takes an episode or 2 to get into it but once you do you'll love it.
I:10014;4963;Everybody who loved Firefly will also love this movie.
I:10014;4964;Still hoping for another one to come.
I:10014;4965;Amazing movie, but not too great watching it they Amazon
I:10014;4966;I practically worship this movie because of the closure it gives.
I:10014;4967;I've seen it many times since (it's great every time!)
I:10014;4968;when I show it to friends and family.
I:10014;4969;The movie drama created for one of my favorite series was SO awesome.
I:10014;4970;I love the series, and hope it will come back to the small screen, but this movie did manage to fill a void for a little while.
I:10014;4971;Again, the writing, the characters, the story line, all superb.
I:10014;4972;I highly recomend this movie to all.
I:10014;4973;The cast blends together and draws you into the adventures.
I:10014;4974;If you are into SciFi this is the one for you.
I:10014;4975;It's like a mix of western and science fiction.
I:10014;4976;Definitely an unpublicized gem worth seeing.
I:10014;4977;I love the infusion of Chinese culture in almost a Blade Runner fashion.
I:10014;4978;fix to tide you over till he once again emerges victorious with a new feature film or TV series.
I:10014;4979;"We came to care for the finely drawn characters, and ""Serenity"" is an awesome sort."
I:10014;4980;It's now one of my favorite movies ever.
I:10014;4981;Do yourself a favor and see this one!
I:10014;4982;I had never seen the show before going to see the movie, and let me tell you, it made absolutely no difference.
I:10014;4983;This is one of the best movies that I have seen in many years.
I:10014;4984;The originality is stunning (western in space!)
I:10014;4985;Also, the characters are so believable, not stiff like in the Star Wars movies (new ones).
I:10014;4986;The battle between Summer (River) and the cannibals is totally brilliant.
I:10014;4987;Bravo to Joss for casting a dancer.
I:10014;4988;This movie was true to the series and kept the characters in their former attitudes.
I:10014;4989;It was by far one of the best series on tv, bar none.
I:10014;4990;It was fantastic to see everyone on the big screen.
I:10014;4991;Although, we could see Joss' ideas for a whole 'nother season in it.
I:10014;4992;By far the best Hi Def release to date.
I:10014;4993;a blown opportunity to provide fans with a truly memorable collection .
I:10014;4994;For those who do not know, Serenity takes the characters of Firefly and slightly rewrites their story to create this movie.
I:10014;4995;It's a fantastic creation, full of witty dialogue, perfectly timed lines and action, and a fully developed cast that you somehow feel you already know.
I:10014;4996;Perhaps one advantage of having come from a series is that the chemistry between the actors definitely shows, and it's obvious they know exactly who they are playing.
I:10014;4997;great film, and a good introduction to the (unfortunately) short.
I:10014;4998;"For those who have viewed the Firefly Series and those who have not, this should be quite an enjoyable film

I:10014;5001;It's hard to hit everyone's funny bone at the same time.
I:10014;5002;"But for people who don't care for that, the action sequences are good too
I:10014;5003;And yes, it does have that feel of the very first Star Wars, though perhaps not as epic.
I:10014;5004;serenity got rave reviews and as a science fiction writer/publisher and lifetime fan I had to see what everyone was talking about.

I:10014;5014;This video will be listed as one of the classics, ranking among the top in entertainment.
I:10014;5015;I want to go see it again.
I:10014;5016;the humor in the movie is more pronounced than in the TV series, which is a good thing.
I:10014;5017;humor added to plots that are serious, when well done, is always a welcome thing.
I:10014;5018;It was like these 9 wonderful people were born to play these parts.
I:10014;5019;"eyed"" at the thought of the series being over is both gratifying and heart."
I:10014;5020;Let's hope we see a sequel, and that certain unexpected turns of events in the movie are brought to happier conclusions.
I:10014;5021;truly one of the most amazing television shows ever made.
I:10014;5022;"Still ""Serenity"" showcased wonderful characters with fascinating stories to tell, although there were some incomplete story lines which could not be told within the limited framework of a two hour movie."
I:10014;5023;I was there since the beginning and I'll continue being there to support this great show.
I:10014;5024;The Bottom Line:A capable adaptation of the always.
I:10014;5025;"brilliant Firefly, Serenity benefits from Chiwetel Ejiofor's exceptional villain and Whedon's wry humor
I:10014;5026;fi, and an excellent continuation of the Firely series.
I:10014;5027;If you like Firefly, you'll love this movie.
I:10014;5028;This is an entertaining movie that requires watchers to listen to the dialog and follow along with the plot, but provides enough action to keep you interested.
I:10014;5029;The special effects are sufficiently advanced and the acting is fairly good (as it was in the whole series).
I:10014;5030;brow entertainment, but if you want a fun story that moves fast enough and requires enough thought to keep you interested, this movie qualifies.
I:10014;5031;I have loved Firefly ever since the first episode.
I:10014;5032;This is a good sci.
I:10014;5033;The genius that is Joss Whedon, created a thouroghly enjoyable movie that is watchable whether you are familiar with the show that spawned it or not.
I:10014;5034;Love the Show, Love The Movie.
I:10014;5035;This is an excellent movie.
I:10014;5036;It is a nice wrap up to a wonderful series that was ended entirely too soon.
I:10014;5037;It has a somewhat expected ending but with some unexpected twists.
I:10014;5038;At the end, I wanted to see more about what happens to Serenity and her crew.
I:10014;5039;Special effects have improved so much over the years.
I:10014;5040;the dialogue, script and the actors flowed so smoothly.
I:10014;5041;Watch them back to back and this is the final touch.
I:10014;5042;"fi fan of ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" and also like the appeal of character development and growth of the characters in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" this is a fantastic show to watch."
I:10014;5043;Captain Mal is the stubborn and smart.
I:10014;5044;alicky type guy one can admire, love, need to punch from time to time, and want to understand better.
I:10014;5045;Whedon has a great talent for humor and detailed storytelling.
I:10014;5046;There's not a whole lot extra, but the box is worth it!
I:10014;5047;Very good for say people that enjoy SciFi series/movies like Star Gate SG.1, etc.
I:10014;5048;As someone who ONLY encountered the movie at that time, I thought the film pretty darn shiny.
I:10014;5049;off epic culmination of the television series.
I:10014;5050;If ever I could, I would resurrect this uniquely original concept into full.
I:10014;5051;The Complete Seriesin one definitive stroke!Again, I still really like the film and Nathan Fillion's portrayal of the reluctant hero who only wants to be left alone but is never, ever going to be left alone is one of the best of its ilk that I have ever seen.
I:10014;5052;Whedon came up with a damn good premise made even better by some shiny character development.
I:10014;5053;If only there had been someone at FOX who understood the potential goldmine upon which they blindly sat!This is a film worthy of a good look on Blu.
I:10014;5054;It would be a little to odd to like one equally as the other, but I do recommend exploring both.
I:10014;5055;ray disc of the film is impeccable, the series itself was filmed intentionally with a grainy look akin to a lot westerns.
I:10014;5056;in the final analysis, I genuinely believe that the film is in every way superior to the short.
I:10014;5057;lived, albeit brilliant, television series, but the film also establishes certain absolutes that I do wish could have been avoided.
I:10014;5058;If I had my way, I would write a trilogy that reconciles the best of the series into a worthy prequel to this film.
I:10014;5059;Still, this is a very strong four star effort and one that I do recommend as much as the television series so long as all are aware of the tragic nature of this story.
I:10014;5060;very nice to hear Joss talk about how it's all put together.
I:10014;5061;What a great ensemble cast.
I:10014;5062;Joss Whedon outdid himself with this series and film.
I:10014;5063;love the movie, but my wife really digs it.
I:10014;5064;law recommended that we watch Firefly and we absolutely loved it.
I:10014;5065;I love syfy and westerns and this just brought them both together seamlessly.
I:10014;5066;Excellent writing and superb acting made this a must see for syfy fans.
I:10014;5067;Wish they could bring the series back with new episodes with the original cast.
I:10014;5068;My sons introduced me to Firefly, and I love it.
I:10014;5069;It did a good job of it .
I:10014;5070;It gives a very good message!!
I:10014;5071;the top plots and characters in abundance, but we don't often get really good science fiction movies that contain all the elements that make up a great story.
I:10014;5072;It has everything: interesting and layered characters, great dialogue, heart.
I:10014;5073;stopping action, and a plot that pulls it all together.
I:10014;5074;I seriously hope there's a sequel.
I:10014;5075;it met all the expectations I had for it.
I:10014;5076;Wow, what a debate in the review section.
I:10014;5077;what this movie really offers is a fresh take on the space movie .
I:10014;5078;and a cast of nine (ten, if you count the ship) who have been acting together for two years and show incredible timing and really, truly, act like they are the crew of a ship.
I:10014;5079;Funny and fast, but the tragic points are truly tragic.
I:10014;5080;Blade Runner is slow, slow, slow, but it's still fun.
I:10014;5081;This Serenity movie fits perfectly in the genre of offbeat, smaller.
I:10014;5082;You'll love it, and it will make this movie even better for you.
I:10014;5083;tech and human, with (ambiguous) saints and devils, and some of the great sci.
I:10014;5084;"Saw this at the movies and loved it then I found out that it was a TV series that had only one season

I:10014;5087;Joss Whedon created a film that certainly ran neck and neck with other sci.
I:10014;5088;This is definitely the best movie you've never seen.
I:10014;5089;This movie shows that a good story line counts for more than a big budget!
I:10014;5090;It is involved, intense with developed characters that you get to know and get to like.
I:10014;5091;Will keep you on the edge of your seat!
I:10014;5092;One of my favorite sci.
I:10014;5093;I can't say anything more then has already been said about this movie, it's just fantastic.
I:10014;5094;Firefly finally gets its smashing finish fans were praying for, in this hip, humorous, and triumphant movie adaptation, Serenity.
I:10014;5095;With breakneck pacing, cool visuals, an attractive cast, a hilarious script, Whedon's knack for action choreography, and a story made for all to enjoy (not just the Firefly elitists), Serenity is a joy to watch.
I:10014;5096;All the characters have something to say and they work very well as an ensemble.
I:10014;5097;One thing that made the series work was the well.
I:10014;5098;Fans demanded more, and a movie got produced.
I:10014;5099;As a Firefly fan, I enjoyed seeing a certain percentage of the plot arcs come to a satisfactory conclusion.
I:10014;5100;For one thing, it's a lot bigger.
I:10014;5101;Bigger emotionally, bigger in scope, and bigger in sheer size.
I:10014;5102;If you liked Firefly, you'll love this movie.
I:10014;5103;The River Tam sesssions alone are worth the price of admission, in my opinion.
I:10014;5104;fi special and more with the cast and crew.
I:10014;5105;for those who haven't seen the flick, you need to if you're a fan of intelligent, well crafted sci.
I:10014;5106;The universe is well put together with no flaws that I could see and the characters are real people created by one of the industries best writers and brought to life by a dynamite cast.
I:10014;5107;fi is Star Wars and Independance Day, then you need to watch this movie to see what is well and truly good in science fiction.
I:10014;5108;jar gets his own talk show, be cool.
I:10014;5109;Serenity, the movie title, illustrates not only the name of the ship in which the main characters reside, it also expresses the overall theme to what makes the characters and story work.
I:10014;5110;to be successful, you must keep your head and find your inner serenity.
I:10014;5111;The rebels that live on Serenity do just that, each in there own way, and thus, in the end, are successful in saving the woman secretly trained to be a secret weapon and, ultimately, exposing the forced Manchurian Candidate.
I:10014;5112;though not for small kids, this movie had very good pacing and beautiful spaceships, with a lot of funny one.
I:10014;5113;i'd recommend this movie to all for a night of spaceship chasing fun.
I:10014;5114;If you are a fan of science fiction AND/OR a fan of the short.
I:10014;5115;lived series Firefly, you will most likely fall in love with this movie.
I:10014;5116;Joss Whedon sure knows how to spin an amazing tapestry of adventure, excitement and humor!
I:10014;5117;Not the greatest movie, but it was entertaining
I:10014;5118;It is a fitting and satisfying film for firefly fans.
I:10014;5119;Also a great into to the series for those new to the franchise.
I:10014;5120;Enough people have talked about the history behind the movie and debated its genre that I'll be very brief: this is the best adventure film since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.
I:10014;5121;archetypal characters, a simple us.
I:10014;5122;them story that evolves into something much larger, and expertly.
I:10014;5123;Serenity is going to become one of those perfect lazy.
I:10014;5124;player and just relax kind of movies, perfect on the shelf alongside Raiders or Butch and Sundance.
I:10014;5125;A great, incredibly accessible entertainment.
I:10014;5126;Nice addition to the Firefly verse.
I:10014;5127;Good characters, pretty good plot and lots of fun.
I:10014;5128;(I loved every minute of it!)
I:10014;5129;i loved the series, it was great, this movie is even better, with quite a few surprises.
I:10014;5130;Love the special features .
I:10014;5131;picture is great if you want a running commentary (and you can have subtitles of the movie going on in the background, so you can watch both at once)
I:10014;5132;This is, without a doubt, one of the best films of the Sci.
I:10014;5133;serenity has heart, humor, drama, wit, and a cast that you quickly grow to love and care about.
I:10014;5134;and it does a stellar job at both.
I:10014;5135;This was made to please an already established fan base.
I:10014;5136;They skillfully answered a bunch of questions that had been left unanswered about the back story of the Firefly universe.
I:10014;5137;pleasing aspect of this movie.
I:10014;5138;Overall, an excellent movie if you're already a fan of the series.
I:10014;5139;A movie with wry humor and sharp wit that treats its audience as if we have brains?!?!
I:10014;5140;His script is brilliant and his cast a wonder.
I:10014;5141;But it's a nice collection of extras, and a fine finish to a well made, short.
I:10014;5142;This was a Christmas present to an avid Firefly fan.
I:10014;5143;It is a great completion to the Firefly TV series and ties everything together.
I:10014;5144;A well acted, well scripted, TOP NOTCH sci.
I:10014;5145;just enough to ease the tension at just the right time!
I:10014;5146;A classic GOOD vs. EVIL story with a real world, not fairy tale, ending.
I:10014;5147;I fell even harder it is now my favorite show ever and Serenity is my favorite movie.
I:10014;5148;I'm so happy I bought it on Blu Ray too.
I:10014;5149;fi movie been this fun, and balanced excitement, action, humor, and an ensemble cast so expertly.
I:10014;5150;i give serenity the edge though b/c it's a smarter film, dealing with more philosophical/moral issues (tuskegee medical experiments, anyone?)
I:10014;5151;, while still being a whole lot of fun.
I:10014;5152;that will make this film so much more significant, and will make it clear to you what an incredible achievement and victory it is.
I:10014;5153;well, i think you can figure out what might come next.
I:10014;5154;The characters are all great, and it delivers a satisfying resolution.
I:10014;5155;I like Joss Whedon's The Avengers as much as the next guy, but obviously this is his masterpiece.
I:10014;5156;i'm not one to really rate the technical aspects of bought movies.
I:10014;5157;All that matters to me is the special features I end up watching, and the main attraction itself.
I:10014;5158;I've seen this movie several times now, and to this day I may prefer it over watching something new, like most movies I know are great.
I:10014;5159;Serenity, hard to believe a show that was so good got shot down so fast.
I:10014;5160;Nathan Fillion, can be found on Castle.
I:10014;5161;"There's a reason for that
I:10014;5162;this film is particularly well written, manages an ensemble cast well with witty one.
I:10014;5163;liner dialogue and tells a unique storyline with a space.
I:10014;5164;western feel to it, whilst enabling itself to explore political and powerful concerns important in today's society.
I:10014;5165;this is one of the rare good films to have been released this year and certainly worth keeping on your shelf at home next to the original star wars collection.
I:10014;5166;Loved the series and have that too.
I:10014;5167;Worth watching but watch the series first.
I:10014;5168;one great feature here is you get both blu.
I:10014;5169;Mandatory and satisfying viewing for anyone who watched Firefly on TV.
I:10014;5170;Well, worth the upgrade if you have the choice.
I:10014;5171;This is my first review here at Amazon, and technically, I view it as more of a response to some of the comments made about the film.
I:10014;5172;That scene was absolutely necessary.
I:10014;5173;It would be interesting to see how certain characters cope with the impact of it.
I:10014;5174;And it serves as a reminder of just how good Whedon is at making you feel for what happens to the crew of Serenity.
I:10014;5175;I felt this is one of its stronger points.
I:10014;5176;as for the review, I feel that this is one of the best movies.
I:10014;5177;It's wonderfully written, excellently acted, and beautifully scored.
I:10014;5178;If you haven't watched Firefly (the show which it's based on), I would heartily recommend it.
I:10014;5179;I wouldn't mind more from this universe, but I'm definitely happy with what we got.
I:10014;5180;This is a fantastic film (and series), better than any recent Star Wars in my opinion.
I:10014;5181;This film is definitely among the more unique in our time.
I:10014;5182;It is as exciting as Indiana Jones, but is layered with deep philosophical complexities and moral ambiguities that many modern art house films don't even get quite right.
I:10014;5183;He's that complicated a character!
I:10014;5184;For the crew with which Mal has surrounded himself, I would make the argument, are a complex of Mal's many manifested personalities:Zoe .
I:10014;5185;hearted adventurous pirate, filled with wanderlust.
I:10014;5186;the suppressed inner child, innocent but adaptable and capable.
I:10014;5187;an otherwise gifted individual, twisted into something dark by the Alliance.
I:10014;5188;the dialogue in this movie rivals some of the best I've ever seen on film.
I:10014;5189;I've only seen this movie three times, so please forgive any inaccuracies):(my personal favorite!)
I:10014;5190;That tickles me a bit.
I:10014;5191;So here is us, on the raggedy edge.
I:10014;5192;mal: I start fighting a war, I guarantee you'll see something new.
I:10014;5193;Maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground swept clean.
I:10014;5194;there are many, many more that I have omitted.
I:10014;5195;It was so refreshing that Whedon actually got to conclude his story, not many people would be afforded that opportunity.
I:10014;5196;A great continuation of the TV series.
I:10014;5197;Serenity is that kind of movie.
I:10014;5198;I felt that there were some story plots that could have been further explored, but regardless, the movie kept me entertained throughout.
I:10014;5199;Acting and direction are thin but special effects and continuity are good enough to keep the story moving along.
I:10014;5200;When some much needed downtime came up I bought the series because so many people were saying how good it was.
I:10014;5201;fi or just fun movies watch this.
I:10014;5202;saw the movie and loved it but there were some discontinuites with the origional show.
I:10014;5203;found this flick to be surprisingly awesome and i am a seriously critical scifi fan.
I:10014;5204;have reccomended it to many all who love it
I:10014;5205;although never really getting the opportunity to fulfill its promise, the series had an interesting premise and likable enough characters to prompt me to give the movie another view.
I:10014;5206;The added character developement of the series improved this movie immensely for me.
I:10014;5207;It added an immeasurable degree of emotional depth to the story, and when when it was over I could finally see what all the fuss was about.
I:10014;5208;taken together, the series and film work nicely together to create what is perhaps the most compelling space opera in recent memory.
I:10014;5209;While most people will tell you that it really isn't necessary to enjoy the film, the added context it provides is well worth the extra effort.
I:10014;5210;this is the perfect ending movie for any firefly fans out there .
I:10014;5211;Devoted fans will, of course, love it.
I:10014;5212;Someone who's never seen the show will also feel right at home with the way the movie brings in the viewer without feeling as though he's missed something.
I:10014;5213;he has done with Serenity.
I:10014;5214;But with the same outstanding level of achievement.
I:10014;5215;All the fantastic elements that made that series and all of Whedon's TV endeavors so loved by fans are on full display here, only on a larger scale, with the antes severly upped.
I:10014;5216;here we finally learn the dark secret that River (the stunning Summer Glau) had carried with her throughout the series and are introduced to the mysterious Operative, the Alliance's number one agent, played with force by Chiwetel Ejiofor.
I:10014;5217;The final act of the movie is pure exhiliration.
I:10014;5218;Sure, the series is gone forever, but they took the whole storyline and dumped all the rest of the backstory into one brilliant movie.
I:10014;5219;Serenity is an excellent space adventure that hopefully will go down as a classic.
I:10014;5220;Not only does it have an amazing action packed world that blends its own personality with bits of Star Trek and Star Wars, but the characters are rich and it's social commentary gives the film multiple layers.
I:10014;5221;the part of film that makes it truly interesting is that it's storyline is a reflection of events going on in the world today.
I:10014;5222;This move sums up the series.
I:10014;5223;You'll better understand the characters.
I:10014;5224;The series is goofy, funny and just plain fun.
I:10014;5225;It was an entertaining film and fans of the series will enjoy getting to see Firefly with a bigger budget.
I:10014;5226;The Collector's Edition has a lot of additional material that any fan of the movie will appreciate.
I:10014;5227;Commentaries abound and the box is nifty also.
I:10014;5228;ray has excellent video and audio and the supplemental package is also worthwhile.
I:10014;5229;alone film, Serenity is very enjoyable and itself deserves a high recommendation.
I:10014;5230;Well conceived and well wrought.
I:10014;5231;So the spine upon which the plot was grafted was strong.
I:10014;5232;There was a good and believable tension among the players, as though they had their individual agendas.
I:10014;5233;The action was good action.
I:10014;5234;subtle mind, the preternatural anticipation Mal had for the next Alliance move.
I:10014;5235;If you guess that the Alliance has captured Mr. U's planet and so you bring the Reavers with you, you had better be right.
I:10014;5236;Love this movie based off the series.
I:10014;5237;Great movie if you enjoy Sci.
I:10014;5238;Great price and great selection on movies.
I:10014;5239;Amazon and it's dealers are great.
I:10014;5240;I live in a rural area and have the world for a shopping mall thanks to them.
I:10014;5241;ABC Fox Disney is a lot more powerful negatively than NBC Warner was.
I:10014;5242;This movie, from the series Firefly, is (like the series) the best sci.
I:10014;5243;"the characters are so real, you can identify with them immediately and I'm pleased to say that they all stayed ""in character"" for the movie."
I:10014;5244;I was a Joss Whedon fan from the start coming from Buffy and Angel, so naturally I just had to start watching Firefly.
I:10014;5245;The plot lines do not correspond completely but it is understandable in order to allow new viewers to enjoy the movie and get a quick background introduction.
I:10014;5246;This movie MUST be seen if not for the plot but for the wonderful interaction between characters and Joss Whedon's witty writing!
I:10014;5247;Another gem in Joss Whedon's crown.
I:10014;5248;I saw the series on science channel and bought it.
I:10014;5249;still, it's more of Firefly where it was shut down and I still love this show.
I:10014;5250;The regular edition should be enough.
I:10014;5251;It has everything: action/adventure, comedy, good acting, a great story.
I:10014;5252;It will make you cheer and break your heart.
I:10014;5253;"It's a perfect companion to the Firefly series
I:10014;5254;A great ending to one of the best shows I have ever watched.
I:10014;5255;I salute the creators of Firefly and Serenity for giving us a masterpiece ending like this.
I:10014;5256;Everyone i know loved this movie.
I:10014;5257;I got to see one of the early cuts in the theater before it was released.
I:10014;5258;"But then it's Joss
I:10014;5259;if you're a Firefly fan, you should love this.
I:10014;5260;Even with what he does to the characters, the writing was superb and made the movie that much more dramatic.
I:10014;5261;i've also got to say that if you're not a fan, you can still enjoy the movie and never see the series.
I:10014;5262;I have friends who were introduced to Firefly through Serenity and have since bought their own copies.
I:10014;5263;weedon's ability to mix humor into very serious material is remarkable.
I:10014;5264;He'll make you laugh, cry and clench your fist in almost the same breath.
I:10014;5265;It was surprising for otherwise fantastic FX sequences.
I:10014;5266;It's got all the classic parts.
I:10014;5267;It rivals even Star Wars (OT) in my heart.
I:10014;5268;but I enjoy the movie so, that its not worth the hassle of trying to return it.
I:10014;5269;Loved the series and watched it several times.
I:10014;5270;Movie is a great conclusion and am very happy to have it in my collection
I:10014;5271;But a friend urged me to watch it by saying that it was an eerie prefiguration of the entire Edward Snowden/NSA situation.
I:10014;5272;Although the humor and the PG.
I:10014;5273;nature of the film suggests that its target audience is probably teenagers, its message is a pertinent one.
I:10014;5274;dimensional it made me want to throttle Joss Wheden, especially because Buffy was so great, but wow!
I:10014;5275;I was shocked, surprised, thankful, etc.
I:10014;5276;This was a very good movie, in every aspect, cinematography, acting, plotline, editing, music, lighting.you name it, it was good.
I:10014;5277;One of the best sci.
I:10014;5278;The storyline is fascinating and the character development is excellent.
I:10014;5279;Everyone who enjoys science fiction will love this movie.
I:10014;5280;This movie is just a continuation of the story that takes the series to some kind of conclusion using the movie.
I:10014;5281;Overall the movie is quite watchable and entertaining but definitely not mind blowing.
I:10014;5282;"well it was 'an act of kindness'."""
I:10014;5283;once you see it once or twice (and you'll prob.
I:10014;5284;I also admit to a fine hankerin' for all things Nathan Fillion, and this here will do me jus fine.
I:10014;5285;If you, as I, feel that 13 episodes were simply not enough and you yearn for more information than those simple few can give you, than this is the perfect addition.
I:10014;5286;"Also, a cute little flyer came in the box with mine for ""Ships Papers"", ""Alliance Money"" and a few other collector items for sale, for those who are truly dedicated to keeping the Firefly mystique alive."
I:10014;5287;The box itself is quite a bit more hardy, and beautiful in a way, and its outer raised embossing is pleasing to the touch.
I:10014;5288;placed, incredibly funny wry humor.
I:10014;5289;The characters interact incredibly well, and even the bad guy is made to be understood by the viewer.
I:10014;5290;fi viewers, this series was short lived but very good.
I:10014;5291;good to be able to get the original feature.
I:10014;5292;One of my family's favorite films.
I:10014;5293;Good film, great story, and lovable characters.
I:10014;5294;up kids (18 and 21) to see this movie.
I:10014;5295;We were delighted with the originality and humor of the film.
I:10014;5296;It has the funniest dialogue I have heard in a long time.
I:10014;5297;Kind of reminds me of Episodes IV and V of Star Wars in that respect.
I:10014;5298;Very appealing collection of diverse characters.
I:10014;5299;Very sad to see two of the most interesting characters killed off.
I:10014;5300;But on the whole, this is very well.
I:10014;5301;Most importantly, we found ourselves becoming hard.
I:10014;5302;core fans, and developing a real loyalty to the characters.
I:10014;5303;Maybe the next movie can be a prequel, so the killed of characters would still be alive.
I:10014;5304;Right now I and my kids are fervently hoping that sales are good enough for long enough to get a sequel made to this excellent movie .
I:10014;5305;Highly recommend to any collector.
I:10014;5306;be sure to watch it after you watch the series.
I:10014;5307;For Firefly fans, this movie is beyond satisfying.
I:10014;5308;and at the same time, leaves you wanting more.
I:10014;5309;I just loved the balance and style of the writing in this movie, showing off all the conventions that Joss Whedon excels at.
I:10014;5310;and demonstrating once and for all that these characters are timeless.
I:10014;5311;I loved the tv show firefly which this movie is based off of.
I:10014;5312;The result is this beautiful piece of a SciFi movie that doesn't have one alien and no major star anywhere in it's universe.
I:10014;5313;Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Jewel Strait, Sean Maher, Summer Glau, Ron Glass, Morena Baccarin, and Chiwetel Ejiofor scorch the screen as the principles in this 'cat and mouse' game with the surprise ending.
I:10014;5314;The movie kept going, thanks to the Browncoats and the new fans, until it 'broke even' at $39M.
I:10014;5315;The action is tense but realistic.
I:10014;5316;Even the setting is more believable if you think about it.
I:10014;5317;The actors/actressess are all gorgeous and sexy.
I:10014;5318;a top notch scifi series that is so popular with everyone who's seen it that it stands an extremely good chance of being picked up in the near future for another run.
I:10014;5319;Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) created an amazing cinematic vision with Serenity.
I:10014;5320;Probably one of the most endearing things about the Firefly/Serenity story is that it is a science fiction story that does not rely on the typical sci.
I:10014;5321;Meanwhile his crew consists of a wonderfully talented and colorful group of actors and characters.
I:10014;5322;watching the television series beforehand is not vital to understanding the story, but it will give the viewer added insight, understanding, and appreciation for several details of the movie.
I:10014;5323;The very human characters and actors create an intense and amazing chemistry, and the energy is definitely bouncing between them.
I:10014;5324;I watched the entire first season, if you can call it a whole season, and loved it.
I:10014;5325;The next day I saw the Serenity on the big screen and thought it to be one of the best I had seen this year.
I:10014;5326;Great movie and a must have for any fan of Firefly or heck, just any science fiction fan in general.
I:10014;5327;Wow, seriously, I have to use a set number of words?
I:10014;5328;What it does have, that many other sci.
I:10014;5329;humour, great dialogue, engauging characters .
I:10014;5330;which drives a great story.
I:10014;5331;And it's a story worth watching.
I:10014;5332;It's a fantastic film that features great action sequences, intriguing characters, air.
I:10014;5333;tight pacing, and a gripping plot.
I:10014;5334;"fi"" is rarely so fantastic."
I:10014;5335;a reaction that was elicited by the introduction to the movie's central characters.
I:10014;5336;The next morning I found myself talking to the cashier at the local HMV.
I:10014;5337;I thought this was a great deal blue.
I:10014;5338;Interesting is I can get diapers to deliver within one day and blue.
I:10014;5339;ray0 stars for amazon delivery
I:10014;5340;The characters are portrayed perfectly by the cast and are all believable.
I:10014;5341;We thoroughly enjoyed the movie not just from a scifi perspective, but also the character development and the creativity employed in their language and culture.
I:10014;5342;The message regarding the dangers of an oppressive government and the power of freely available information was interesting as well.
I:10014;5343;Being a huge Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan, it makes perfect sense that this other brain child of Whedon's would be just as captivating.
I:10014;5344;Although I'll definitely miss some of the characters that were killed off, I hope we'll see this cast again in future projects!
I:10014;5345;From the cool box design to the extra bonus features, this collector's edition is extra special!
I:10014;5346;I liked the original commentary with Joss Whedon (which is still on here as well), but the new one with Joss, Nathan Fillian, Adam Baldwin, Summer Glau and Ron Glass is even better!
I:10014;5347;Great conclusion to a series I didn't discover until it had already been off the air for several years (great job, marketing department).
I:10014;5348;This is one of the best movies ever made.
I:10014;5349;A great space classic that fans of Star Wars and/or Star Treck will enjoy.
I:10014;5350;I bought it to go along with the Firefly series and have random screenings with friends of both the series and this movie.
I:10014;5351;There's never a dull moment and the cast is perfectly fit to the characters!
I:10014;5352;this was a great fun movie.
I:10014;5353;i went with people who had never seen the TV show (more fool they), and both loved it and will see it again, as will I!!!
I:10014;5354;it was great to see such fun up on screen.
I:10014;5355;Well, I got a kick out of it just the same.
I:10014;5356;"If you liked the film, go see it again and again
I:10014;5357;Let them view the series so they can fully enjoy the experience.
I:10014;5358;This is such a great movie and has lots of twists in it.
I:10014;5359;Movie works great and love all the characters
I:10014;5360;i found Joss Whedon's creation to be well made, with the right balance of humor, action, and situations.
I:10014;5361;"The mostly unknown cast (I only knew Adam Baldwin and Ron Glass) acquaints itself well and adds to the ""freshness"" of a storyline that, at times, is reminiscent of genre films that have come and gone before."
I:10014;5362;"what with ""The Federation"" (""Star Trek"") on hold, ""The Empire"" (""Star Wars"") having bit the dust, it might be time for Whedon's ""Alliance"" to take its place in the minds of sci."
I:10014;5363;fi fans, hungry for the next franchise.
I:10014;5364;I loved all the extras and special features .
I:10014;5365;it really added to the value of this movie.
I:10014;5366;I was a huge fan of the original, axe.
I:10014;5367;Is it as good as the TV show?Trick question.
I:10014;5368;compression, and a necessity to focus on only a very few arcs.
I:10014;5369;But it also allows for some incredibly big thrills, chills, and explosions along the way.
I:10014;5370;river and Mal are given center stage, along with the Reavers story, and creative mastermind Joss Whedon uses his trademark brilliant dialog, brutalizing emotional content, and jaw.
I:10014;5371;dropping set pieces to full effect, every bit as funny, terrifying, and surprising as I've come to (happily) expect.
I:10014;5372;Whether Serenity introduces them to Firefly or vice versa, its definitely a journey worth taking and characters worth experiencing.
I:10014;5373;driven science fiction I've seen since The Wrath of Khan.
I:10014;5374;The characters are well drawn, the situations have a believability about them in personal and universal terms and you wind up actually caring about what happens to these people in this universe.
I:10014;5375;You want to see them succeed and continue on.
I:10014;5376;Joss Whedon does a great job.
I:10014;5377;He says more in one sentence with his well chosen cast than most sci fi writers say in a trilogy.
I:10014;5378;genius, I love his characters and his dialogue.
I:10014;5379;He has few equals working today, and I while I will always believe that he and this series deserved better at the time, it's gratifying to see that Hollywierd has finally awakened to the fact that this man can tell a story and tell it better than all but a very few around him.
I:10014;5380;rah piece celebrating the film.
I:10014;5381;Interesting to ponder what Universal'll dig out for the show's 20th anniversary.
I:10014;5382;This is a great series, undeserving to be shown on TV as a 'series'.
I:10014;5383;The storyline is genius and the actors are perfect for their parts.
I:10014;5384;fi in each episode and it really is a pleasure to watch.
I:10014;5385;I love this movie (ain't nothin' like it in the 'verse) and I don't care what anyone else says.
I:10014;5386;It's not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it IS a fun way to spend a Saturday night.
I:10014;5387;If you have not seen the TV show fear not, this film is still a great watch.
I:10014;5388;There are a number of action sequences, plenty of humor, and fun characters that work well together as the plot thickens.
I:10014;5389;The flashbacks of a conditioned/programmed teen girl 'Firefly' are very interesting, as the mystery of a secret society is revealed.
I:10014;5390;i do highly recommend this movie but only if you watch the series first.
I:10014;5391;This movie is really a series finale.
I:10014;5392;After watching the series first it makes much more sense and the characters have much more depth.
I:10014;5393;You can watch it first but you'll be seeing the ending first.
I:10014;5394;Absolutely worth the time of any SciFi fan.
I:10014;5395;Serenity is, quite simply, one of the best sci.
I:10014;5396;fi movies I've had the pleasure of seeing.
I:10014;5397;The characters and their interactions are somehow witty and realistic at the same time, and the writing and directing is top.
I:10014;5398;"If you don't own this movie, I recommend it highly, and would suggest getting this edition
I:10014;5399;The additional features are nice, but nothing mindblowing.
I:10014;5400;"Serenity is the sci fi epic based on the show Firefly, a show which (in the words of its director) was ""immediately hailed as one of the most cancelled shows of the year."""
I:10014;5401;But in its short run, it gained an incredibly strong cult following, and pressure from the show's fans and creators led to the creation of the film.
I:10014;5402;serenity is every sci fi fan's dream.
I:10014;5403;Its special effects aren't really that special, but they're handled well enough that we believe them.
I:10014;5404;Earlier this year I praised Revenge of the Sith for its opening shot being a single long take, but Serenity does it one better with its Russian.
I:10014;5405;this all happens shortly after one of the most brilliant opening sequences I've ever seen.
I:10014;5406;As it turns out, it's a woman teaching a history class.
I:10014;5407;As that turns out, the history class is the dream of a brainwash victim before her daring escape.
I:10014;5408;fi tv/movie world with the best characters ever created.
I:10014;5409;This is a really well presented set.
I:10014;5410;The box is awesome, to begin with.
I:10014;5411;The menus are simple and load in the blink of an eye.
I:10014;5412;The presentation looks great, sound is good, picture is top notch.
I:10014;5413;The extras are pretty extensive and there is new stuff over the previous releases.
I:10014;5414;The writer does a wonderful job of making the story accessable to newbies like me, yet I could also sense there was a lot of old plots and loose ends being tied up.
I:10014;5415;Good science fiction with a touch of the old west and some humor.
I:10014;5416;Serenity is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:10014;5417;One of the best parts is the very beginning when you first see the ship and Mal Reynolds makes some snide remarks about the ship falling apart.
I:10014;5418;One is the original, the other is this collectors edition.
I:10014;5419;Both are basically the same, but the collector's version has a nice box and a few extra features.
I:10014;5420;It is Joss Whedon's masterpiece.
I:10014;5421;I haven't seen Firefly.yet, but you can watch this movie without it and still enjoy it.
I:10014;5422;Serenity has some really strong, and well developed characters.
I:10014;5423;It's great when you can see a film with actors and actresses who aren't well known, but can pull the job off as well as any big name hollywood cast member could.
I:10014;5424;It would be great to see a second Serenity film, but even if a follow up is never made, it's still a great film that stands on it's own merits and then some.
I:10014;5425;the humor and weird slang are simply outstanding subtleties that really make this film special.
I:10014;5426;i'll likely view the Firefly show in the near future as a result of how great this film was.
I:10014;5427;which a very, very pleasant surprise for a change.
I:10014;5428;"Great movie as a standalone
I:10014;5429;First, the other reviews are spot on.
I:10014;5430;In my opinion, this movie is the best one released this year.
I:10014;5431;In any category, class, genre, you name it.
I:10014;5432;The story, plot, writing, and acting are superb.
I:10014;5433;The result is an experience that tickles all the emotions, so expect to laugh, cheer, and yes, bring some tissues too.
I:10014;5434;A great movie, I highly recommend.
I:10014;5435;I loved the series, I love the movie.
I:10014;5436;"Joss knows exactly how to draw you in, make you love his ""family"" and want more of them."
I:10014;5437;This movie has everything you go to the movies for.
I:10014;5438;What can I say, it has Nathan Fillion and it is the movie to one of the greatest TV series, ever!
I:10014;5439;A must watch for anyone that loves syfy.
I:10014;5440;If you loved Firefly, this is awesome.
I:10014;5441;A sad sudden ending to an excellent series, one of my favorites.
I:10014;5442;So, with this ediiton I give a 1 star.
I:10014;5443;i absolutely LOVED the series and LOVED this movie.
I:10014;5444;It's a bit fast paced to keep up with if you don't know the details of the characters, plots, and flow of the series, but it is a wonderfully filmed and played out movie.
I:10014;5445;"I was vary happy with the storyline of the reavers and what ""made"" them."
I:10014;5446;"thank you Josh for giving us your imagination and this ""baby"" that you created called ""Firefly,"" and to the extension of that series."
I:10014;5447;One can only hopy that there, one day, will be enough spark to light the fire once more.
I:10014;5448;If that's the future, please, end it all now.
I:10014;5449;Bring on Armageddon because the human race is at an end.
I:10014;5450;"China and the USA have become ""the"" merged power."
I:10014;5451;Serenity stole the ground chase from Nemesis almost shot by shot, up to and including the ship maneuvering in front of the racing ground vehicle so it can jump inside.
I:10014;5452;the rabid fan base needs to get a life and discover real science fiction .
I:10014;5453;This man knows how to write.
I:10014;5454;His stuff has a tendancy to pull you in and make you part of his family.
I:10014;5455;Whene I first heard he was starting a new sci.
I:10014;5456;The network gave the best show of the year the axe without even giving it a chance to let it grow.
I:10014;5457;Both us the fans and Joss crusaded and fought.
I:10014;5458;(I give that 5 stars to) Still a best seller here at amazon after 2 years.
I:10014;5459;opening day my friend and I got a group of 12, some fans of the series some newbies, everyone loved it.
I:10014;5460;The writing, acting, everything works well.
I:10014;5461;Trust, me get the Firefly Series first, watch it and you'll enjoy the movie even more.
I:10014;5462;Even alone the movie is top notch, first rate.
I:10014;5463;I was, and still am in love with the creativity, the originality and the clever 'not.
I:10014;5464;the movies feels like an enormous, well.
I:10014;5465;which is what I love about it most.
I:10014;5466;The cast, visibly made 'more Hollywood' was superb in continuing the story that made this a cult favorite.
I:10014;5467;From the very original story arc, to teh fantastic workings of the digital effects team.
I:10014;5468;How wonderful it was to see the Firefly cast in action again.
I:10014;5469;The deeply felt characters, the humor, the action, the clear moral compass (sometimes spinning a bit out of control).
I:10014;5470;It was all so wonderful and so sad at the same time.
I:10014;5471;A great concept with enormous potential, I can't wait for the next one.
I:10014;5472;Nathan Fillion and the rest of the Serenity cast pull off a truly wonderful film centered around the characters of the one season firefly series.
I:10014;5473;Witty and moving, this is one of those movies that would make you want to see more from this director even if you had never heard of The Avengers.
I:10014;5474;Not have see the series until it appeared on Blue Ray I was thoroughly entertained by this movie.
I:10014;5475;As is the continuation of a great Science fiction series.
I:10014;5476;The movie is well done and Josh Whedon's direction is spot on.
I:10014;5477;You can tell the director and Cast know their characters well.
I:10014;5478;The cast's close ties with each other comes through on the screen.
I:10014;5479;Watching some of the cast in their roles on TV is fascination.
I:10014;5480;I enjoy actors who can take on a role with carrying baggage or trait from a former character.
I:10014;5481;And watching Gina Torres (Suits) reminds me she is one of the more elegant actress to grace the screen.
I:10014;5482;i rated this as 5 stars because of the smart script, great direction, and a solid cast
I:10014;5483;It was great to see Mal and the crew in High Definition on a big TV.
I:10014;5484;A feast for browncoats and Sci.
I:10014;5485;fi fans alike, Serenity is a sure bet for those willing to give it a shot.
I:10014;5486;paced, with twists, and with a sense of humour.
I:10014;5487;It's a likeable, solid cast.
I:10014;5488;name character actors, which emphasizes the ensemble feel.
I:10014;5489;"while the film spends a few minutes introducing the ""Firefly universe"" at the start, for the most part the characters are introduced on the fly."
I:10014;5490;It is the discovery and unfurling of those secrets that is at the heart of the plot.
I:10014;5491;all in all, it makes for an enjoyable film.
I:10014;5492;serenity delivers on all fronts.
I:10014;5493;It gives the viewer action and adventure and allows the charactors to give out a little revenge of their own on the 'evil' forces out there looking to stop them.
I:10014;5494;Best case scenario for fans of Firefly would be a new movie and an even better case scenario would be a series of TV movies on a cable channel.
I:10014;5495;either way, Serenity is a good piece of old fashioned Sci.
I:10014;5496;Excellent story line, acting, music score, and ending.
I:10014;5497;lived Firefly series, then you will absolutely love this movie with its full action and excellent characters!!
I:10014;5498;My daughter love Fire Fly and this was a great edition to here collection, i have created a SCI FY nut lol
I:10014;5499;This movie was a good continuation and conclusion to the series.
I:10014;5500;I went to the movies to see it, and w/ my home set up now, it's the cats a$$.
I:10014;5501;I've kept track of all the actors, and many of them are doing well, especially Fillion.
I:10014;5502;This film is the best adaptation for the big screen that could have been done for this show.
I:10014;5503;As much as I wanted this show to continue on tv for season after season, the film had the look and feel of the show.
I:10014;5504;The characters translated well to the big screen and the action was amped up to fill the giant shoes of a sci.
I:10014;5505;One of the big mysteries of the show is answered and in spectacular fashion, and we get to spend another hour and a half with our favorite characters.
I:10014;5506;In my opinion (for what it's worth) Serenity is one of the best movies out there, Joss Whedon (the creator of Buffy The Vampire Slayer) at his finest.
I:10014;5507;But thanks to the loyal fans of the series (like myself) Firefly has been raised from the dead and been reborn as Serenity.
I:10014;5508;Wow, what a great show!
I:10014;5509;Serenity lacked the warmth and humor of Firefly, and I couldn't feel the bond between the characters so evident in the series.
I:10014;5510;I'm a huge fan of the series, and this movie was a good way to put an end to the series.
I:10014;5511;It is darker, more focused with a lot of serious action.
I:10014;5512;To accomplish this, it has to give up some of the whimsy of the series.
I:10014;5513;You may miss this in the beginning of the movie, but as the story line draws you in and you begin to realize what is at stake for the characters, you become less concerned with comic relief and more concerned with what lies ahead.
I:10014;5514;As the movie nears its conclusion, the intense action and gut.
I:10014;5515;wrenching occurrences, grab you and hold you there.
I:10014;5516;It is an emotional experience.
I:10014;5517;If you are a Firefly fan then this is a must have film.
I:10014;5518;Good acting and give the Firefly series closure.
I:10014;5519;In short, this film is absolutely superb.
I:10014;5520;Serenity has it all: great characters, superb performances, great dialogue, action, suspense, and a few laughs too.
I:10014;5521;How horrible that a movie exists that actually believes each of us owns our own lives!
I:10014;5522;If you haven't bought the first season of Firefly, then make sure you watch that as well.
I:10014;5523;One of the better movies I have watched in the last couple years.
I:10014;5524;it's a great movie and Firefly fans were lucky to get a movie based off of a cancelled TV show.
I:10014;5525;This movie is absolutely made by and for the underdogs of the world and for the fans of firefly!
I:10014;5526;Serenity(released Aug/05)is a quite decent Sci.
I:10014;5527;so this review is really kind of reverse engineering in a literary sense and a look at this film in situ.
I:10014;5528;it is an exciting plot throughout and holds ones interest all the way.
I:10014;5529;i was pleasantly surprised to see some fine actors like Gina Torres,who goes by Gin Torres in the credits,better known for her roles in Hercules and Cleopatra 2020 among others,Adam Baldwin who I recall from X Files and old Ron Glass from Barney Miller.
I:10014;5530;the entire cast gels beautifully and the glue is Fillion himself who does a wonderful job as the persnickety captain of the Serenity,who likes to run his ship HIS way.
I:10014;5531;all in all Serenity is a wonderful stand alone film.
I:10014;5532;for the fans of Firefly it's just a natural to get,but anyone interested in good Sci.
I:10014;5533;Good movie just as the series was.
I:10014;5534;Serenity is an excellent movie with a good plot and anybody who is a firefly fan will surely enjoy this movie.
I:10014;5535;fi, cowboys, humor, or action.
I:10014;5536;Love the cast, the direction, the production, the writing, all were great.
I:10014;5537;This product arrived on time and in good condition.
I:10014;5538;I'm a big fan of this movie, and of the Fox series as well.
I:10014;5539;fi flick with a great ensemble cast.
I:10014;5540;I enjoyed this as action sci.
I:10014;5541;In the beginning, I got into it as it was full of intriguing notions: a mutant beauty with extraordinary powers in thrall to a techno.
I:10014;5542;Escapes and takes refuge on a ship with a quirky crew.
I:10014;5543;None of the actors that well known, with few exceptions.
I:10014;5544;discover their ideals, fight a bunch of monsters, then make a difference with a discovery they must share.
I:10014;5545;That is a lot to accomplish in 2 hours, and I didn't feel that they quite did.
I:10014;5546;while the actors are not big stars, their performances are at least better than average and often excellent.
I:10014;5547;It is good, hard sci.
I:10014;5548;both a great movie and great series.
I:10014;5549;At least they wrapped up the story line with Serenity.
I:10014;5550;Thank you to all responsible for this production.
I:10014;5551;Awesome addition to the series.
I:10014;5552;"Fun movie by the director of the ""Avengers""."
I:10014;5553;Every once in a while, spending extra money on a blu.
I:10014;5554;As far as the movie goes it has sci.
I:10014;5555;fi action, humor, adventure, and a story line that is intense and believable.
I:10014;5556;At the end of the series we knew only a little about her, that she possessed some kind of psychic ability, that she was physically agile, that she was a genius, and that she had been shattered by her experiences.
I:10014;5557;Summer Glau, whose first acting job came on ANGEL when Joss Whedon needed a professional ballerina for an episode, does a good job as River.
I:10014;5558;The role is more about movement and posture than anything and choosing a dancer for the part was a great decision.
I:10014;5559;Her ability to move is key to her success in the role and is crucial to her fight scenes being so believable.
I:10014;5560;Of course, by the end of the film Mal's suppressed idealism comes back and the crew ends doing something rather heroic in the name of the truth.
I:10014;5561;all in all, this is the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long, long time.
I:10014;5562;I honestly can compare the fun to other experiences such as seeing STAR WARS for the first time or THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.
I:10014;5563;The plot was rich and fun and the action sequences were plentiful and delightful.
I:10014;5564;Chiwetel Ejiofor was absolutely splendid as The Agent, the man without a name or security number who sought the capture of River in order to create, as he imagines it, a better world.
I:10014;5565;Whedon loves to play with viewer's expectations in his various projects, and the way he handles The Agent is no exception.
I:10014;5566;The sets were marvelous throughout and frankly I liked the way the film made outer space look much better than George Lucas did in THE PHANTOM MENACE.
I:10014;5567;Also, the film was filled with the marvelous one.
I:10014;5568;The word is that the studio hoped to make a trilogy of films depending on how well the film does at the box office.
I:10014;5569;The first weekend the film has done well though not spectacularly.
I:10014;5570;My own guess is that the film is going to do well enough for Universal to pick up the option for another film.
I:10014;5571;With Whedon's productions far more popular in Europe and the UK than in the US, the film should do exceptionally well on the international box office.
I:10014;5572;I expect that in the end it will turn enough of a profit to demand a second film.
I:10014;5573;I say crazy because before seeing the movie I would not have believed it possible to pull of such a scenario, but it worked very well.
I:10014;5574;Though still well worth watching without seeing Firefly.
I:10014;5575;par, like most B. class Movies.
I:10014;5576;Sexy people + SciFi + scary politics + ambiguous morality + great writing + great effects = canceled series (Firefly).
I:10014;5577;the movie itself is fantastic, and I know it may be a bit biased since I'm already a fan, but even if I weren't a fan of the show I'd still think it's a brillaint movie, and if I wasn't already a fan of the series, this movie would prompt me to become a fan, that's how good it is.
I:10014;5578;That's because it's brilliant!If you like Star Trek and Star Wars you will definitely enjoy Serenity.
I:10014;5579;bang to keep your interest but if you enjoy character and plot development this is one to pick up.
I:10014;5580;The series Firefly is great and this movie is an extension of that.
I:10014;5581;I just bought this movie because it was on sale and am very happy I did.
I:10014;5582;The special effects are great, and I learned a lot about the series' history which got me into the Firefly series.
I:10014;5583;fi and you like westerns or just some great humor mixed with exciting action and great story telling you will definitely enjoy this movie.
I:10014;5584;Great movie on blue ray.
I:10014;5585;Love watching this on a pretty regular basis.
I:10014;5586;ray are great and fun to watch
I:10014;5587;I highly recommend this movie tho .
I:10014;5588;The characters are great, there is plenty of emotion and it is just an all around good movie.
I:10014;5589;This is a wonderful conclusion to a great series (which in retrospect should be considered a mini.
I:10014;5590;Wonderful performances from all cast members.
I:10014;5591;This movie was a perfect conclusion to a really outstanding show.
I:10014;5592;I loved the series (you can probably tell) and this movie helped tie most everything together.
I:10014;5593;Even if you never watched a single episode, you can still appreciate this movie on it's own as a great story with some incredible characters.
I:10014;5594;ray, but they are really cool to a fan like me.
I:10014;5595;This is a 3.5 star B. movie.
I:10014;5596;And they have imaginative dialog to work with.
I:10014;5597;is better than anything in the last three Star Wars installments.
I:10014;5598;A rich combination of the tried and true synthesis of the mythical American wild west and our dream of space travel, plus the concept of the free spirited hero come together to create a movie that is just plain fun.
I:10014;5599;An added benefit is that it is easily this movie a few times.
I:10014;5600;"It's got all the elements of a movie classic
I:10014;5601;fi, Western in space, with excellent character developement and great humor .
I:10014;5602;you'll love this series and Movie.
I:10014;5603;Start with the series and finish with the movie for full understanding of the characters.
I:10014;5604;Not one of my favorite SciFi movies, but still, ultimately an enjoyable and worthwhile movie.
I:10014;5605;BEFOREI thought this movie was great!
I:10014;5606;Slightly wierd perhaps, but a really good ride and very interesting.
I:10014;5607;"Again, as in ""Star Wars,"" the ship and its crew engage in an intergalactic chase with a force much bigger and more powerful that they somehow must find a way to defeat."
I:10014;5608;"despite the feeling of d j vu that permeates the work, ""Serenity"" has a few fun moments involving the characters' interactions with one another."
I:10014;5609;interest as righteousness and courage.
I:10014;5610;The acting is generally wooden, but the plotting is intriguing enough to sustain our interest through most of the movie.
I:10014;5611;this is definitely a mixed bag when it comes to science fiction entertainment.
I:10014;5612;Director, Joss Whedon, decided to make a theatrical version of the show that would make a final statement of a wonderfully written and original idea for a space opera that never had the chance to let the characters and the storyline mature to it's fullest.
I:10014;5613;special effects are excellent and and believable.
I:10014;5614;The sets are well designed and the costumes are well suited for the atmosphere of the show.
I:10014;5615;It will complete this whole brilliant concept in a storyline of Patriotism, Friendship, Family and Love.
I:10014;5616;I am absolutely floored at how great this film was.
I:10014;5617;This film succeeds because of its characters, its story, and its heart, a thing lacking in many films today.
I:10014;5618;See this film, or you are robbing yourself of something that will touch you more than you think it will.
I:10014;5619;I love the television series because of it's sence of pure adventure.
I:10014;5620;There is more but I will stop with these facts.
I:10014;5621;The proof of this assertion is in the box office receipts.
I:10014;5622;SERENITY should have demanded more respect than Mr. Whedon held back.
I:10014;5623;It is full of the extras stuff you desire.
I:10014;5624;The series based on this movie was an enjoyable Sci Fi romp.
I:10014;5625;A lot of tongue in cheek comedy and danger and evil defeated made an enjoyable ending movie.
I:10014;5626;Sad that the producers didnt want to continue the series but well worth watching the series and the movie
I:10014;5627;More humor, less death and much better character development.
I:10014;5628;I havnt seen it since the last time i saw it, but I remember it being a fantastic movie.
I:10014;5629;Because the series and the movie is short enough before it started to have flaws makes it an instant classic for me.
I:10014;5630;Im a big fan of Nathan Fillion and Summer Glau but im a bigger fan of space adventures.
I:10014;5631;Firefly was an amazing show.
I:10014;5632;fi western or a comedy sci.
I:10014;5633;The movie, while very very fun and well worth watching, doesn't answer all the questions you'd expect it to, so don't expect complete closure.
I:10014;5634;serenity (Widescreen Edition),Serenity (Collector's Edition)And it will help a lot to those new to Firefly to go back and watch the series before the film,Firefly .
I:10014;5635;But being able to watch this awesome cast for 2 more hours of fun was wonderful.
I:10014;5636;But all in all, this is a must own as a fair ending to a great series, and not very many shows can say they at least got a chance to give any sort of ending or resolve to it.
I:10014;5637;Five hundred years into the future, the human race moved to a new solar system with many planets.
I:10014;5638;whedon brought back the same stellar cast from the cancelled television series Firefly.
I:10014;5639;When we see River's elegant dancer feet, we know danger is coming.
I:10014;5640;the script is quirky, rhythmic (with Chinese curses), and the dialogs superbly blend humor with terror.
I:10014;5641;And Whedon makes his point.
I:10014;5642;He is composed, pleasant, and honorable.
I:10014;5643;'Joss Whedon created a sci.
I:10014;5644;fi masterpiece that reminds us the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
I:10014;5645;Augmented by Alliance technology, River is something of a super.
I:10014;5646;one deep inside Reaver territory.
I:10014;5647;i really wanted to like this flick, which displays some pretty crisp dialog for a sci.
I:10014;5648;Mal and the Operative share some interesting banter when they first meet, but the Operative is smart enough to recognize stalling.
I:10014;5649;the story's biggest weakness is that it seldom feels like it's going anywhere .
I:10014;5650;won't be the only time we watch it.
I:10014;5651;It's action packed, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
I:10014;5652;Very few movies evoke a full spectrum of emotion like this one does.
I:10014;5653;What a fantastic film this is!
I:10014;5654;Everything you could possibly want, including an interesting plotline, beautiful costumes, a fantastic soundtrack, creative and extremely funny one.
I:10014;5655;stop action and adventure, more character development and a fulfilling closure of ties at the end all rolled into one outstanding film.
I:10014;5656;I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves a good story.
I:10014;5657;If you like good SiFi, and don't have a copy of Serenity, you may as well get this one.
I:10014;5658;Plus it's in cinema wide screen, so if you have a 4 X 3 aspect ratio TV, the picture is narrow.
I:10014;5659;"piece (high on the ""love fest"" index) and a piece that shows River's deterioration at the ""academy."""
I:10014;5660;Nevertheless, Serenity's premise makes for excellent SiFi, and it is a fun movie.
I:10014;5661;again, Serenity is good SiFi and a fun ride.
I:10014;5662;"If you can't get enough, then the Collector's Addition is a good idea
I:10014;5663;"hard fan with a ""regular"" TV, I'd recommend getting the standard full."
I:10014;5664;"The Collector's Addition is worth every penny of the $18
I:10014;5665;If you like the show you'll love the movie.
I:10014;5666;I was a big fan of the series.
I:10014;5667;Really good acting from everyone in the cast.
I:10014;5668;For Firefly fans, this movie is a must watch.
I:10014;5669;I thought the Blu Ray picture and sound was very good.
I:10014;5670;The movie is action packed and has the edge.
I:10014;5671;seat suspense that keeps it moving along, as the TV show did.
I:10014;5672;It has all the ingredients that make a movie great.
I:10014;5673;One of the few movies that I've enjoyed watching more that once.
I:10014;5674;Joss Whedon put together an excellent series.
I:10014;5675;I hope there is more to come!
I:10014;5676;Thank you for listening to the Browncoats and fans and giving us some closure to the much beloved Firefly Saga with this movie, Serenity.
I:10014;5677;this movie can be viewed as a 'stand alone' movie, but is so much more enjoyable as the end part of the series.
I:10014;5678;highly recommended for those who like a good yarn, humour, space ships, cool characters and some eye.
I:10014;5679;I remember the set moving up into the fifth all around rating on Amazon.
I:10014;5680;I was hooked into the plot right from the opening scene.
I:10014;5681;pledged movie on the Firefly and her crew was so perfect for me.
I:10014;5682;All I will say, is I cried at the end of this movie.
I:10014;5683;I will watch them until I die, that is how much I love this story.
I:10014;5684;If you loved the show, you will feel right at home.
I:10014;5685;So all of us fans will have more chapters in the story to look froward to.
I:10014;5686;It is well worth your time and money.
I:10014;5687;I love the strong women of Firefly, and the men who stand by them.
I:10014;5688;and it was better the second time.
I:10014;5689;serenity, the movie, is an entertaining sci.
I:10014;5690;She is a warrior, after all, and she has absorbed the memories of senior Alliance officials that give her insight into the mysterious planet, Miranda.
I:10014;5691;but the search for River by the Alliance has gone into high gear.
I:10014;5692;An Operative sent after her is relentless, and merciless, as he tracks her down.
I:10014;5693;But Serenity, the movie, is entertaining regardless.
I:10014;5694;Whether or not you've seen (or heard of) Firefly, Serenity will please your gray matter.
I:10014;5695;Joss does an excellent job of character developement and getting you to believe in the movie and all of the people.
I:10014;5696;This is a pretty good story with pretty good acting.
I:10014;5697;fi fan, and we both loved it.
I:10014;5698;Great chemistry between the characters.
I:10014;5699;I don't by any means consider myself qualified to be a critic but watching this movie makes me happy and that's what movies are all about, yes?
I:10014;5700;But the movie was just a recipe action movie that pretty much destroyed the great characterizations and the feel of the series.
I:10014;5701;Thank you to all involved in this movie and series.
I:10014;5702;The series wasgreat and the movie is even more amazing!
I:10014;5703;The characters are so diverseyet work together great.
I:10014;5704;Everyone should see thismovie at least once!The camera work is awesome and shows the nature of the film as unique and unafraid.
I:10014;5705;Joss Whedon is an amazing writer and director.
I:10014;5706;From Buffy to Angel and now to Serenity, I am hooked on the great comedy, quick turn of events, and action that these teams produce.
I:10014;5707;Serenity is a must see movie and a great story that I hope continues.
I:10014;5708;This movie is a must for anyone who loved the show.
I:10014;5709;It is a great ending to the series !!!
I:10014;5710;Firefly was the best Sci Fi I have ever seen.
I:10014;5711;The characters had so much depth to them and were so real.
I:10014;5712;This is great movie from the Firefly series.
I:10014;5713;There are no aliens, and in fact you could take the space out of the show and still have the dedication you see from its proponents.
I:10014;5714;Crank that feeling you get up a couple 100 percent and your getting what firefly and serenity have to offer.
I:10014;5715;in short, it is all worth your time.
I:10014;5716;take a chance to make the time for this movie.
I:10014;5717;Great movie, under explored series, that really hit the mark with the age old formula of Space age meets old west.
I:10014;5718;Hopefully this special addition will spark some new life into this R. i. p. franchise.
I:10014;5719;But I dont need to tell you that.
I:10014;5720;Not only is the dialogue snappy and true to human conversation, but the story itself is completely original (unlike most of the formulaic stuff spewing out of Hollywood these days).
I:10014;5721;This movie is a breath of fresh air, and the Blu.
I:10014;5722;Extras give you a lot of insight into Joss Whedon's creativity.
I:10014;5723;I liked the tour of the ship.
I:10014;5724;This movie, based on the short lived TV series is great on many levels.
I:10014;5725;This is a great Scifi movie filled with action, suspense and drama.
I:10014;5726;The characters are cast perfectly and the writing is superb.
I:10014;5727;This is my favorite movie of all time, I was happy to pick up the Blu Ray for such a low price.
I:10014;5728;It's a shame Firefly was canceled, but this movie definitely provides closure for fans of the series.
I:10014;5729;Serenity is a film that will entrance any film buff.
I:10014;5730;The stellar acting, skilled directing, and the riveting, mysterious plot grab the viewer in the first scene and nevet let you go until the finale.
I:10014;5731;I was browsing online and saw some amazing reviews and my interest was piqued.
I:10014;5732;at the heart of this film, are a crew of characters who are both full of bravery and pragmatism and an intriguing blend of idealism and cynicism.
I:10014;5733;It's an apt description of the type of people they are.
I:10014;5734;serenity is the best science.
I:10014;5735;fiction film I've ever seen and will long be viewed by critics as one of the best action films of the decade.
I:10014;5736;I had already seen it but it is nice to have to watch whenever I want.
I:10014;5737;This amazing show suffered from a string of circumstances that caused it to be cancelled even before all of the filmed episodes of it's first season had aired.
I:10014;5738;"The dedication of these loyal fans, dubbed ""Browncoats,"" contributed to the release of a follow."
I:10014;5739;Just adding my two cents to the numerous reviews in support of this fantastic movie.
I:10014;5740;As violent in spots as this movie can be, it is satyrical, yet with humorous writing.
I:10014;5741;I loved the TV series .
I:10014;5742;Love it love it love it.
I:10014;5743;It really has everything for a excellent film.
I:10014;5744;A cast in which you care about everyone in the movie, the action, comedy, most important the story which are all spot on.
I:10014;5745;This movie is a fitting big.
I:10014;5746;great acting, funny dialogue, and very touching ending.
I:10014;5747;Far better than the Star Wars prequels.
I:10014;5748;I loved the show so decided to get the movie.
I:10014;5749;Best Scifi movie of the new century.
I:10014;5750;If you aren't familiar with Firefly or Serenity, than I envy you.
I:10014;5751;cause I'd love to discover them all over again!
I:10014;5752;Serenity is the best, freshest movie to come along in a generation.
I:10014;5753;Serenity borrows from the best of Sci Fi (shades of Blade Runner, the original Star Wars) and succeeds blending it with an old fashion western in ways Star Trek never did.
I:10014;5754;After finishing the series I was eager to get more and more of the shows elegance and fun loving crew onto my TV.
I:10014;5755;I'm still unclear as how this movie holds out alone and thats probably why it didn't get the numbers the execs wanted, but the movie with the show is an exceptional piece of sci fi all worth the small amount it's been on our radar.
I:10014;5756;The movie it self has a well thought out premise and defiantly leads you in with learning more about the Firefly history.
I:10014;5757;That's what made me love this series, the people and their interactions.
I:10014;5758;All pieces of the story are fun and awesome to watch.
I:10014;5759;I do love that this was a show and a movie combined that I was able to experience.
I:10014;5760;It's a great show and a great story.
I:10014;5761;Aside from the movie being purely great, the colors and clarity were amazing.
I:10014;5762;"i've compared this to my buddies ""Blue Ray"" disks and I can tell you that this definitely looked sharper."
I:10014;5763;Except a really good movie.
I:10014;5764;Every character can be appreciated on many levels, as can the story.
I:10014;5765;but there are real people, living in a real world, having an adventure that will leave you breathless and wanting more!
I:10014;5766;Thought the acting and general program was better in Firefly.
I:10014;5767;I stumbled onto Firefly in a meander on the edge of the black looking for interesting Sci.
I:10014;5768;Needless to say, the series was captivating and satisfying on every level.
I:10014;5769;shooter style and never lets up.
I:10014;5770;The quick wit and unique dialogue with the multi.
I:10014;5771;cultural mix is there blazoning your brain with its cleverness .
I:10014;5772;The movie is the perfect accompaniment to the series.
I:10014;5773;Honestly one of the greatest stories ever told with the best characters and amazing casting.
I:10014;5774;I can't say enough words about how much I love this movie!
I:10014;5775;Seeing it at this deal was a great day for me!!
I:10014;5776;The feel of the acting and the sense of humor, along with some of the characters, are very like writer/director Whedon's other work, including his best known, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
I:10014;5777;it works well, on the whole.
I:10014;5778;There's plenty of action, enough character development to be interesting, romance, pop philosophy of the kind you get in Star Wars and Star Trek, and a mix of moral ambiguities among strong moral values that's distinctively Whedon.
I:10014;5779;Some of the sentimentality stuck out enough to make me squirm a couple times, but it's handled with a leavening humor.
I:10014;5780;If you enjoyed Star Wars or Whedon's other work, you're likely to enjoy this.
I:10014;5781;I think this is a very fine movie and that the series was way to good to have been cancelled.
I:10014;5782;The casting is really good, the acting is also good, the writing is excellent, and while there is a lot of serious scenes there are also a lot of funny ones.
I:10014;5783;You really follow this crew and see them as a family.
I:10014;5784;You feel their joys, their fear, their sadness and their passions.
I:10014;5785;the prologue in this movie is interesting for both the Firefly fan and the folk who never heard of it.
I:10014;5786;From the prelude, the rest of the movie is a journey into this family's toughest trial yet.
I:10014;5787;Make great characters, and a great story and people will watch it.
I:10014;5788;But what does it take to make great characters and stories?
I:10014;5789;An excellent writer and time, time being the key.
I:10014;5790;fi, and TV shows in general and after Firefly, nothing really seemed worth watching.
I:10014;5791;fi drama with comic elements and western and asian themes.
I:10014;5792;its an awesome series that gets you hooked in the first episode.
I:10014;5793;its really cool, a little scary, and pretty funny.
I:10014;5794;The audible gasps and laughs of members in the audience was great.
I:10014;5795;I laughed, I cried, I became a fan all over again.
I:10014;5796;Watch the documentary about it.
I:10014;5797;the cast of Serenity and Firefly are amazing.
I:10014;5798;everything about it all is phenomenal.
I:10014;5799;The action, the emotions, the plot development, the effects, the acting .
I:10014;5800;this movie is full to the brim and is guaranteed to sweep you off your feet.
I:10014;5801;You'll laugh out loud, you'll cry, you'll hold your breath, you'll sit quietly in astonishment.
I:10014;5802;What a great experience!Contrary to most science fiction drivel, it actually has real people you quickly relate to going through actual character development, a story worth telling and the use of special effects and action in the service of the plot .
I:10014;5803;guaranteed a place among science fiction classics!
I:10014;5804;If anyone wants to watch a wonderful film with sci.
I:10014;5805;fi, comedy, and suspense then this film is worth it.
I:10014;5806;I saw this movie at the theater and I loved it.
I:10014;5807;There is the humor that made the Tv show and more action.
I:10014;5808;The actors have all returned and do a great job.
I:10014;5809;I will be picking this one up on Dec. 20 and you should do the same.
I:10014;5810;great writing, acting, and a cool concept.
I:10014;5811;This film is pretty much perfect, it acts as a stellar conclusion to Firefly.
I:10014;5812;This is by far the greatest movie of 2005, much much better than Star Wars episode 3, I'm a fan of Star Wars, but that movie blew, it had great acting, great music, and amazing effects.
I:10014;5813;Joss Whedon can truly be happy about this movie.
I:10014;5814;The movie had me laughing one minute, tense with anticipation the next, and then crying.
I:10014;5815;Even through my tears this movie made me laugh constantly, Joss is a comic genius.
I:10014;5816;He managed to get the feel of the show, put a darker twist on it, and then give it back to us for Christmas.
I:10014;5817;I give this the hightest recomendation, if you don't see it you are missing out on one of the greatest movies of all time.
I:10014;5818;The characters live and the Verse is consistent.
I:10014;5819;A nice tribute to the show.
I:10014;5820;Mal finding the thing that could help bring down the Alliance for good was a nice touch .
I:10014;5821;One of the best movies I've seen.
I:10014;5822;up and satisfying conclusion to the too.
I:10014;5823;Amazing storyline and great special effects.
I:10014;5824;The main characters stayed true to the series.
I:10014;5825;Loved the behind the scenes footage!
I:10014;5826;This is afranchise that has still to take flight.
I:10014;5827;I have to say I tremendously enjoyed the interactions between all the main characters and their conflicting personalities.
I:10014;5828;The story line was rich and detailed and kept my attention the entire length of the movie.
I:10014;5829;the CGI was not what is expected of a big budget film but were passable and got the job done.
I:10014;5830;This is a rich world Joss Whedon, the creator of Angel, Buffy, and director of the new upcoming Avengers movie, Introduced us to.
I:10014;5831;if you have not seen the movie or the television series, I highly recommend you order both the movie and television series, pull up a blanket and bowl of popcorn and make a weekend of it.
I:10014;5832;The plot is easy enough to follow and I found the acting to be good, for my taste.
I:10014;5833;I loved this movie as it put a bow on the 2 year series.
I:10014;5834;Summer Glau does 'strange' pretty good and to see what 'her purpose' was, was satisfying.
I:10014;5835;It also had an actor who played the 'good.
I:10014;5836;Good action and a cap on all the actors and actresses who've most have gone onto other successful shows.
I:10014;5837;Serenity does a good job of answering some of the mysteries of the Firefly season, except why such an exceptional series was cancelled in the first place!
I:10014;5838;bot introduces a good concept, reminiscent of the Borg concept when it was first introduced into Star Trek.
I:10014;5839;If you love Firefly, you must see this finale.
I:10014;5840;Just an incredible movie honoring a great show that was stopped way before its time.
I:10014;5841;I love the firefly season, and I love the serenity movie as well.
I:10014;5842;but these risks are worth the rewards of diving into Joss Whedon's futuristic universe.
I:10014;5843;"Serenity builds on the foundation laid by the TV series, and while it's better if you've seen the series, it's by no means essential to understand ""Serenity."
I:10014;5844;Let's take one of God's great creations and make a weapon out of her!
I:10014;5845;Her brother, Simon, is destined to be a successful, brilliant wealthy surgeon, but he throws it all away to break River out of her government lab/prison.
I:10014;5846;"led by Capt. Mal Reynolds, the crew of ""Serenity"" is classic."
I:10014;5847;whedon: lovable, sarcastic, witty, dangerous, and just.
I:10014;5848;The rest of the cast has its own sets of idiosyncrasies and lovable traits . . . this is a cast of fully.
I:10014;5849;one of the disadvantages you have when a TV series is adapted to the Big Screen is scope.
I:10014;5850;As a result, some beloved characters from the series are relegated to more supporting roles .
I:10014;5851;"Fortunately, Whedon and his team are great writers, so even the little moments for the ""supporting"" characters are a riot."
I:10014;5852;Sure, he's got his trademark wit, but we explore his pain (and his unending capacity for it) a bit deeper here.
I:10014;5853;And that's wonderful, because Mal is a great character.
I:10014;5854;we also see a lot more of River in the movie.
I:10014;5855;In the series, River's story was always hinted at, but you could see that her story was something the writers wanted to weave gradually throughout the series as it evolved.
I:10014;5856;"grittier, edgier, and more violent than the TV series, ""Serenity"" is an excellent adaptation to the big screen of one of the little screen's greatest triumphs and tragedies."
I:10014;5857;A horrible (read: excellent) ending to a wonderful series.
I:10014;5858;this disc started up and played wonderfully on my Samsung 5500, though there is a quirk where the opening Universal titles are repeated because Joss used it to fade into the actual print.
I:10014;5859;Serenity, the name of both the first and final installments of the Firefly series, is a fantastic movie.
I:10014;5860;"fi, comedies, then you'll like this show and I recommend it without reservation, but I also recommend watching the entire series (14 episodes)first
I:10014;5861;After watching the rest of the story, the movie is the appropriate capstone.
I:10014;5862;I love this story and also bought the Firefly Series.
I:10014;5863;Humorous, dramatic, suspenseful, and entertaining.
I:10014;5864;I highly recommend this movie and the companion tv series.
I:10014;5865;"This movie does an excellent job of tying up some loose ends that were unresolved when the TV series was cancelled
I:10014;5866;It's also a great finale, with no need for a sequel (spoiler alert: two of the characters die in this film).
I:10014;5867;If you loved the series, do get this movie.
I:10014;5868;fi network (the series is most likely where Ronald Moore and Co. got their 'documentary' ideas from) and really help put you into the story.
I:10014;5869;everyone who is a fan of sci.
I:10014;5870;fi will love this movie and the Firefly series, but the real gem in Joss' storytelling is anyone, no matter what genre appeals to them, can find themselves at home aboard Serenity.
I:10014;5871;serenity is a great follow.
I:10014;5872;up for a great series.
I:10014;5873;Balancing humor, action, and a good storyline with developed, believable characters, it's a treat for fans of the series, and fans of Science Fiction as well.
I:10014;5874;The best escapist good time movie science fiction isn't that deep, it's just the Western set in the future.
I:10014;5875;The characters are interesting, pretty well developed, creating very entertaining teamwork challenges.
I:10014;5876;Like a lot of science fiction, we get a subtle anti.
I:10014;5877;It's just the right combination of action, funny lines, and story line, this movie is fun.
I:10014;5878;series was a bit more detailed, more exciting, and funnier.
I:10014;5879;One of the best films of recent years.
I:10014;5880;It's a very action packed film that shares everything which made the series what it once was.
I:10014;5881;"This movie is a fine yet bittersweet chapter in the saga that was the TV series, ""Firefly."""
I:10014;5882;Of particular interest to fans of the show, it nonetheless stands well on its own as a fast.
I:10014;5883;fi drama with a droll touch of humor.
I:10014;5884;The heroes are a compelling mix of misfits.
I:10014;5885;"some stoic
I:10014;5886;and all share a bond forged from living together in a dangerous and unsettled world aboard a rather decrepit spaceship, Serenity.
I:10014;5887;These are characters you can care about and root for (played deftly by interesting, appealing actors), and the special effects and action in the film keep it visually interesting.
I:10014;5888;All in all, an intelligent, fun, and well.
I:10014;5889;This movie is iconic and so is the Firefly series.
I:10014;5890;My wife and I watch this movie on a regular basis.
I:10014;5891;It makes a lot more sense when its in the proper order, this show should still be on the cable, just great.
I:10014;5892;Joss Whedon's space adventure ticks pretty much all the right boxes: it's sharp, funny, thrilling, and intelligent.
I:10014;5893;I hate that this is the ending of such an amazing TV show with such a short life, but that's all I dislike about this, the film is a nice closure to the short lived but amazing TV show Firefly.
I:10014;5894;All the wonderful cast of the TV show is back in this final adventure, if you're a fan of the TV show then this is a must watch.
I:10014;5895;Serenity is the movie based off the fan favorite TV Show FireFly.
I:10014;5896;It's blend of SciFi action, oddball humor, and quirky yet warm characters makes it a great show and film for any SciFi\Fantasy fan.
I:10014;5897;the movie was made to tie up the plot of the now cancelled show as best as possible, and without having watched the show, the movie will not be as easy to follow.
I:10014;5898;"the premise was interesting but it was ""okay"" at best."
I:10014;5899;"i'd heard it was ""so"" funny and great, so I wanted to see it, thinking since it was released to the general public it would be more polished."
I:10014;5900;To tell the truth, there were two episodes of the TV show that I enjoyed more than the movie.
I:10014;5901;If you've seen Firefly and haven't seen Serenity, see it.
I:10014;5902;If you haven't seen either but want to see Serenity, well, see it.
I:10014;5903;If you've seen Serenity and now want to see Firefly, again, see it.
I:10014;5904;I waited for over 2 weeks to receive my order.
I:10014;5905;There are many morals to this tale, and one lesson is that you constantly have to fight for freedom and knowledge.
I:10014;5906;alas, the cast is great, and so are the special effects.
I:10014;5907;I finally saw this after a long wait, and I must say its incredible.
I:10014;5908;Yes there were a few good moments and some great lines but that was at the beginning of the movie.
I:10014;5909;Jayne (Adam Baldwin) was terrific as usual.
I:10014;5910;enjoyed the action and the finality and closure with Alliance.
I:10014;5911;star votes for this gritty sci.
I:10014;5912;In its unusual blend of sharp.
I:10014;5913;shooting space cowboys and oriental mythology, it yokes together something proprietary to its fantastic world, something that has the electricity to make it all seem worthwhile.
I:10014;5914;A bunch of renegades fly around in space, spewing witty banter more than anything more productive .
I:10014;5915;but really, the dialogue is sharp throughout.
I:10014;5916;athon of a flick, with all its twists and turns and bone.
I:10014;5917;crunching bursts of martial art.
I:10014;5918;Surprisingly, the actors are pretty confident in their parts, which is impressive considering that I had never seen any of them before.
I:10014;5919;and wow, the visuals are amazing on this one, highly recommended for anyone who loves the movie.
I:10014;5920;Well, i was told you could watch and enjoy the movie without watching the series, so i ordered Serenity and can say it was a real treat, im not a sci.
I:10014;5921;fi nut, im actually more into period films.
I:10014;5922;"But Serenity was such a great story line i decided to order the seroies ""Firefly"" so i can get the full picture."
I:10014;5923;This movie was obviously low budget but the story line was just fantastic, i wish there was a bigger budget so this movie could have gottent he treatment it deserved.
I:10014;5924;Serenity concludes and wraps up of most of the story lines from the show Firefly.
I:10014;5925;Whether you claim yourself to be a faithful 'browncoat' or if your response to that statement is 'my winter coat is blue', Serenity is most likely going to entertain you.
I:10014;5926;for the avid fans, this is a solid representation of Firefly and it appears it was an easy transition.
I:10014;5927;Every element that is loved by the fans .
I:10014;5928;the wit, the relationships, the smart action .
I:10014;5929;for those, like me, who have no idea what all this jargin means I think you will still enjoy the film.
I:10014;5930;Great writing, acting, and production values.
I:10014;5931;I have never heard of any of the actors before and these guys are fantastic (I laughed, I cried, I laughed again).
I:10014;5932;to my surprise I learned that this movie was based on a cancelled TV show known as Firefly.
I:10014;5933;The best movie of 2005.
I:10014;5934;the one film all year that was worth every penny AND delivered on all fronts .
I:10014;5935;provoking, poignant, beautifully shot, fun, and funny .
I:10014;5936;as a moviegoer, more like this, please.
I:10014;5937;the movie answered a lot of questions that had developed throughout the series.
I:10014;5938;it is worth seeing if you like sci.
I:10014;5939;Honestly I must say that fans of Firefly probobly enjoy it more than people who never watched the show, but it's still a good sci.
I:10014;5940;fi movie in the grand scale of things.
I:10014;5941;I loved the TV show .
I:10014;5942;An I seen it on sale so I bought it so I can watch it.
I:10014;5943;It doesn't take long to get into this and Whedon (Buffy and Angel television shows) does a great job with the characters and the stories.
I:10014;5944;The characters are unique and very human.
I:10014;5945;This is due to their individual talents as actors and Whedon's own skill in using his actors.
I:10014;5946;The movie still moves very fast and is a bit more complicated than all of the other big screen sci.
I:10014;5947;You'll see a greatly entertaining movie with a lot of action and humor and some sad bits, too.
I:10014;5948;This movie just rocks and it shows exactly how every big budget action movie should contect with it's audience.
I:10014;5949;This movie is a terrific 'episode' to the Firefly series.
I:10014;5950;Joss Whedon, the visionary genius behind Firefly and Serenity, has my everlasting thanks and unending admiration for his exemplary work with this project.
I:10014;5951;Really great movie after an awesome series ended.
I:10014;5952;it wraps it up well even though your heart will break a tiny bit.
I:10014;5953;For the Firefly familiars they loved it.
I:10014;5954;I loved it, I guess, for its originality and unique vision.
I:10014;5955;I saw the pilot for the first time Sunday, and all I can say is that I hope a sequel to Serenity is made, bar some revival of the series.
I:10014;5956;It was action, comedy and an actually good story line.
I:10014;5957;I'm a huge Firefly fan, so I guess this won't be the most objective review in the 'verse, but it's from the heart.
I:10014;5958;i was deeply saddened when the superb FIREFLY series was cancelled and was keen for the new Serenity film as a chance to enjoy another adventure with the crew and ship I'd come to love.
I:10014;5959;It's a great film .
I:10014;5960;fi that's cleverly written, has a real heart to it, a great cast of characters with real chemistry between them, and a wonderful story (works better if you've seen Firefly in my mind, but not essential).
I:10014;5961;See it for yourself and make your own minds up.
I:10014;5962;I really enjoyed the film and it was great that (should it be the last) it does serve well as a valedictory piece whilst still leaving ample room for more.
I:10014;5963;A fitting end to a great series.
I:10014;5964;A good old fashioned story about the triumph of individual bloody.
I:10014;5965;i have really enjoyed the whole thing.
I:10014;5966;i recommend it for fans of science fiction, fantasy, and the wild west!I can't imagine why fox took it off the air.
I:10014;5967;It was one of the best new shows in town!
I:10014;5968;I chose this rating because this is a great movie.
I:10014;5969;It's a fun, exciting sci.
I:10014;5970;fi spectacular that's a must watch for any Firefly fan yet still accessible to those that have never seen the TV show.
I:10014;5971;The distinct western feel, interesting dialect, and the quirks of the characters sets this apart from many other contemporary sci.
I:10014;5972;My four year old knows the theme song by heart.
I:10014;5973;true Browncoats will have to own this continuation of the tv series story.
I:10014;5974;this was a great way to say good by.
I:10014;5975;"In Serenity, we can see the arc of what ""Firefly"" could have been, and in my opinion, much more."
I:10014;5976;, it is only proper that it be given the cinematic touch.
I:10014;5977;Perhaps this is one of the formulas that make the movie work.
I:10014;5978;Battlestar Galactica is one such example of sci.
I:10014;5979;Star Wars is another classic example in that it believes in a universal Force that is in all things, and that the right WILL triumph over the wrong.
I:10014;5980;The Star Trek series, while primarily adventure.
I:10014;5981;"Fans of ""Firefly"" know that this has strong parallels with the American Western frontiers from two centuries ago."
I:10014;5982;The Frontier overtones are so strong that even our heroes still carry guns, instead of the usual lasers.
I:10014;5983;Their destination: as far out as they can go.
I:10014;5984;The ship is captained by Malcom Reynolds (the good.
I:10014;5985;Into the storyline are thrown a mixture of interesting characters such as a Companion (a certified pleasure.
I:10014;5986;giver in the sexual way,) a Christian priest, a universal hacker and the loyal Serenity crew.
I:10014;5987;As a personal opinion, I like the fight scenes between these two the best.
I:10014;5988;If romance can have electricity between two characters, so can a brawl between two fighters.
I:10014;5989;But the underground movement is bound to be moved for sure, and therein lies another branch of story in the Whedon `verse.
I:10014;5990;"overall, ""Serenity"" is the worthy movie of ""Firefly."""
I:10014;5991;uninitiated, it will still pass as a very entertaining movie.
I:10014;5992;Script is crisp and no nonsense.
I:10014;5993;Good story pacing and always commanding attention.
I:10014;5994;"The ""Leaf on the Wind"" sequence is also nicely done, and is one of the scenes that lift ""Serenity"" to a grander scale."
I:10014;5995;Anyway, just sit back and enjoy this sci.
I:10014;5996;But just for the film's adventure story and the love that Mr. Joss Whedon has put into it, makes the film highly watchable.
I:10014;5997;if you're into the series, you'll like the film.
I:10014;5998;two thumbs up, great film.
I:10014;5999;This movie, in my mind, is an instant classic.
I:10014;6000;It has a wonderful balance of drama, suspense, comedy, science fiction, and action.
I:10014;6001;"But more than that, it just has ""heart""."
I:10014;6002;Bought this as a gift and it was WELL received.
I:10014;6003;This movie has a great rating on RottenTomatoes.
I:10014;6004;This movie has a great deal of feedback from people on Amazon, who love it too.
I:10014;6005;now I have never seen Firefly, but this is a movie that should be at least good on it's own merits somewhat right?
I:10014;6006;i am welcome to comments to open my eyes to the light.
I:10014;6007;In my opinion, Firefly was one of the best series on TV.
I:10014;6008;But at least they got to make a movie, and the movie was quite good.
I:10014;6009;There is a big diversion between fans and critics.
I:10014;6010;I hope hollywood appreciates how great this movie did considering its dimunitive budget.
I:10014;6011;This is the perfect finale to a brilliant but canceled show.
I:10014;6012;Highly recommended to anyone who likes intelligent sci.
I:10014;6013;fi and well realized worlds and characters.
I:10014;6014;"Most of the other reviews summed up the important points of the movie
I:10014;6015;Serenity was an amazing movie.
I:10014;6016;You can tell that a lot of love went into the making of this movie.
I:10014;6017;A fantastic movie made by a fantastic director in a fantastic universe.
I:10014;6018;even for those of you unlucky enough to have not seen Firefly (another viewing experience that should not be passed by), Serenity offers a great science fiction.
I:10014;6019;western story with wondeful characters, a great plot, outstanding visuals, and a whole lot of cool action scenes.
I:10014;6020;Must watch the series BEFORE watching this movie to truly appreciate it.
I:10014;6021;But watching it a second time will be a pleasure!
I:10014;6022;"Enter ""River"" the strange twisted girl who has been trained to be psychic and a human weapon."
I:10014;6023;It's a dark melancholy movie in many ways, but with lots of good dialogue and gritty, blood.
I:10014;6024;The characters are well drawn and distinctive .
I:10014;6025;or at least well drawn for those of us familiar with the TV series.
I:10014;6026;"Serenity is a low budget movie compared to other space operas like ""Star Wars"" but the special effects were impressive nevertheless and the story was a lot better than the simplistic comic."
I:10014;6027;It's exciting as only the very best of action and science fiction movies can be!Smallchief
I:10014;6028;If you are a SciFi fan, you will get one of the best genre films made in a very long time.
I:10014;6029;Exciting, well acted, funny, and great to look at.
I:10014;6030;The scripting and camera work is occasionally over the top .
I:10014;6031;There were some very funny lines.
I:10014;6032;It was clearly an attempt to finish telling the story the Firefly series was setting up to tell, and it does it nicely.
I:10014;6033;We finally learn about River's amazing skill set.
I:10014;6034;We see the man moving in to catch, return or kill her to prevent the secret from getting out .
I:10014;6035;and we see human perseverance at its finest.
I:10014;6036;or as it is well put in the film .
I:10014;6037;That was the true beauty of this series/movie.
I:10014;6038;Besides, the characters, even the Companion, were all written and designed to be good people with morals, integrity, and conviction.
I:10014;6039;She is a young, gifted girl who was taken from her home by the corporation to exploit her mental capacity and refine her into a weapon .
I:10014;6040;And River puts that premise forward in some of the best possible ways during this movie.
I:10014;6041;overall, this movie was a great conclusion to an excellent series that ended far, far too early.
I:10014;6042;The likelihood of this series coming back, especially with Joss Whedon's schedule (not to mention all the actors) is infinitesimally small, but that's all that most Browncoats (true fans of this series .
I:10014;6043;and also the name of the resistance forces during the Great War ) need to carry on.
I:10014;6044;fi or even westerns.you'll enjoy this one!
I:10014;6045;We really liked the show.
I:10014;6046;"So we were VERY excited and happy to hear about the new movie (with the original cast from the TV show) ""SERENITY""."
I:10014;6047;it is a fun, witty, well.
I:10014;6048;written and acted and fast.
I:10014;6049;"what I liked so much about ""Serenity"" is the blend of wild west atmosphere and space adventures."
I:10014;6050;"it's totally unexpected but actually works well
I:10014;6051;but I would recommend it, because it adds a lot of depth and understanding to this movie.
I:10014;6052;all in all, wonderful movie .
I:10014;6053;I happened across this movie on my watch instantly account with netflix and loved it.
I:10014;6054;While the graphics aren't the same as LotR or Star Wars (New Trilogy) but the story is still compelling and even though the dialogue sounds a bit awkward at times (it's still better than the new Star Wars trilogy at any right), it stays true to the universe.
I:10014;6055;The acting is good, you can get a sense of the characters and their developement over the course of the movie.
I:10014;6056;star cast and very little publicity, Joss Weddon has produced a great film with strong characters, cool SFX and a quick and whitty script.
I:10014;6057;The realm of science fiction being concerned with the future and improved technology normally carries a progressive message and constructs utopian societies in which people are 'better' than real.
I:10014;6058;The crew of the film come across as real people, not at all like the crew of a Star Trek vessel anyway, the captain is abrasive, ruthless and capable of immoral actions yet is also heroic.
I:10014;6059;The film does a splendid job of bringing together many interesting characters (none more interesting than The Operative played brilliantly by Chiwetel Ejiofor) and locations and breathing life into this interesting world.
I:10014;6060;The story is a real gripper, at the part were the Reaver fleet emerges from the nebula i found myself cheering out loud.
I:10014;6061;Packed with suspense, mystery, camraderie and even quieter moments of mystical awe (during the awesomely understated scenes on the surface of Miranda where they discover the bizarre and horrifying secret) this movie excels in every area and i was really surprised at how good it was.
I:10014;6062;The movie is great and i really like the package also, this is a collectors edition any fan would want to have, the bonus features are great and all I can say is this deleted scenes should have never been deleted
I:10014;6063;Because I've seen the Firefly series, I really enjoyed this movie.
I:10014;6064;It tied up a lot of things that were never really explored in the series and also brought out some great universal truths.
I:10014;6065;I appreciated the balance between dark and light.
I:10014;6066;A witty line makes all the difference in a story about destroyed races and death.
I:10014;6067;I recommend that you watch the TV series first to appreciate the characters and then see the movie (Serenity) to find out where all the loose ends are going.
I:10014;6068;Jos W had a lot of great plot lines to keep this show interesting if it was not cancelled after only one season.
I:10014;6069;I don't know how the writer thought to make a space western, but it really works.
I:10014;6070;It provides new information and strikes a cord with many people.
I:10014;6071;A great man, that Joss Whedon.
I:10014;6072;Still, it was a bit jarring at first.
I:10014;6073;The clever, witty dialog, fine acting with great chemistry between characters, live.
I:10014;6074;action feel with ambient lighting and hand.
I:10014;6075;held camera shots, extending even into the excellent but unobtrusive special effects.
I:10014;6076;But anyhow, it's a really great story, very well told.
I:10014;6077;up of the old threads is very artfully and seamlessly integrated with the present very compelling story, but my perspective may be skewed on that since I'm so steeped in the old threads.
I:10014;6078;"Anyhow, not all the old threads are tied up, and that's good news for fans because it means more is coming
I:10014;6079;The humor was biting, the action plausible, the characters developed and the plot was ORIGINAL.
I:10014;6080;God it was great seeing a sci.
I:10014;6081;alone movie, you will appreciate it more after seeing the series and that is most definitely not a chore.
I:10014;6082;i really can't pick a favorite character because they interact so well together.
I:10014;6083;A fitting sequel to the original made.
I:10014;6084;If you love Firefly then it's a given you will love Serenity.
I:10014;6085;If you aren't familiar with Firefly it's is a space opera kind of science fiction (high adventure in space) that combines the classic cowboy show type elements into a really neat package.
I:10014;6086;It may seem like a weird combination, but it works in a really nice way.
I:10014;6087;It's best for you new folk to check out Firefly first, then come back to me about Serenity.
I:10014;6088;You get a good mix of plot twists, comical moments, and drama peppered throughout a story.
I:10014;6089;One thing I notice though was it felt like an extended and well produced television show instead of a movie.
I:10014;6090;If it's like a TV show, it's like the best TV show you will ever see on the big screen.
I:10014;6091;They put that money on some fantastic special effects.
I:10014;6092;The scenes in space are beautiful to behold, both the calm ones and the massively large ship battles.
I:10014;6093;I'm talking about ship battles with more intensity than Star Wars Episode III.
I:10014;6094;Even if the movie feel likes a TV show the audio is a major boost up and the added effects do stand out in a very good way.
I:10014;6095;The acting is so solid you will find yourself liking more than one character in the movie.
I:10014;6096;The music is also a nice blend of that space opera soundtrack and old west.
I:10014;6097;feature Commentery with Writer and Director Joss Whedon .
I:10014;6098;depreciates himself a lot on the commentary.
I:10014;6099;First it's entertaining that he can crack wise on himself, but it eventually gets old.
I:10014;6100;They did a lot of cutting up in that one.
I:10014;6101;Fun to listen to for a while.
I:10014;6102;Some of these scenes are nice and some are so.
I:10014;6103;jerker for fans who experienced it firsthand.
I:10014;6104;Includes some nice details on the actor's and how well they work together.
I:10014;6105;take A Walk On Serenity .
I:10014;6106;A snarky tour of the set with the director and actors.
I:10014;6107;well the previous disk is a bit cheaper now.
I:10014;6108;It's best to experience the series and move to this movie as everything comes together much better.
I:10014;6109;Think of a marriage of concepts that is one part Star Wars, one part spaghetti western and one part seven samauri and you'd come close.
I:10014;6110;Take that and add Whedon's incredible knack for having characters say and do all those little things you always wished TV/movie characters would say or do.
I:10014;6111;In Firefly the magic worked and it worked well.
I:10014;6112;serenity is a true successor to the TV show without FEELING like a TV show transferred to the big screen.
I:10014;6113;It clicks on so many levels.
I:10014;6114;packed but also very dramtically compelling, building on character relationships as well as tackling questions we were teased with in the series.
I:10014;6115;Trust me, if you get a chance, see the show, follow it up with the movie.
I:10014;6116;It's a ride you won't forget.
I:10014;6117;a true masterpiece that is definitely worth this price!
I:10014;6118;We are so hooked on this show!
I:10014;6119;It's so surprising that it was cancelled after one season .
I:10014;6120;My daughter also brought the movie for us to watch, and we have since bought the first season and the movie.
I:10014;6121;This movie helps to wrap up several of the threads of the story that were left hanging after the Firefly series was prematurely ended.
I:10014;6122;"A friend recommended the show ""Firefly"" to me a few months back."
I:10014;6123;It's science fiction in some of the best traditions of science fiction: witty, well.
I:10014;6124;It has all thrill and geniune fun (and much more serious elements, ultimately) that each of the new Star Wars movies lacked in some department, and more interestingly, none of the clear good.
I:10014;6125;Most of all, the universe is utterly believable.
I:10014;6126;With genuinely good science fiction in such an awful back.
I:10014;6127;well, where nobody has seriously gone in some time.
I:10014;6128;Seriously though, it's probably the one Hollywood movie released this year that's utterly enjoyable and completely rewatchable.
I:10014;6129;serenity is a fantastic sci.
I:10014;6130;In fact, it is fantastic entertainment, period.
I:10014;6131;I mean, let's be honest with ourselves, most sci.
I:10014;6132;It is, quite simply, a great adventure movie, that just happens to be in a futuristic setting.
I:10014;6133;It has good actors portraying fun characters in exciting situations.
I:10014;6134;There is humor, action, horror, and just a little bit of romance.
I:10014;6135;All the basics for exciting, entertaining cinema.
I:10014;6136;fi/Western series Firefly) left off, weaving a tale that is rich and complex, bound to snare both fans and non.
I:10014;6137;all in all, I have to say that Joss did a wonderful job with Serenity.
I:10014;6138;It's one of the best genre films I've seen since Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, and it's going to be one of those that anyone will want to see again and again.
I:10014;6139;The best of the best in visual and writing.
I:10014;6140;This BDM is a true example of pure, strong characters and a great story.
I:10014;6141;i just loved this movie and I didn't know why.
I:10014;6142;Something about it was just so great.
I:10014;6143;It's all about personal taste, and this one suited mine (and many others as well).
I:10014;6144;Probably even more than the movie.
I:10014;6145;enlightenment of the Firefly#The journey of a filmmaker#Extended Scenes#A walk on the Serenity#The Green Clan#Session 416* Bonus material (in high.
I:10014;6146;Absolutely the best movie of 2005!!!
I:10014;6147;Lots of action, snarky dialogue, suspense and heart.
I:10014;6148;One of my cousins liked this movie without knowing any of the backstory, i. e. without having to watch the series.
I:10014;6149;The dialogue in this movie, and really the show as well, gives a preview of what was to come in the Marvel movies.
I:10014;6150;This is a really fun well put together adventure and it isn't even necessary to have watched the series to enjoy.
I:10014;6151;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:10014;6152;I honestly have to keep track of who has it, so that the sneaks don't steal it when I'm not looking.
I:10014;6153;Nonetheless, it's still a remarkable pleasure to watch any version of this film.
I:10014;6154;"Now, armed with the original cast, a bigger budget, and a good script, Joss Whedon, the mind behind ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" brings his trademark imagination and wit to his feature directing debut."
I:10014;6155;the story takes many turns but stays interesting throughout.
I:10014;6156;The cast, all pretty much unknown, perform as a solid ensemble.
I:10014;6157;The effects are beautiful and virtually seamless.
I:10014;6158;This is a breath of fresh air.
I:10014;6159;also, dont worry about if you havent seen the show this is based on, my mother hadnt and she enjoyed the film just as much as me.
I:10014;6160;and on that note, I will finish off by saying, its really incredible that this movie is both Scary, Funny, Noir, and action packed, with out ever getting silly, stupid, loosing its characters, or having a boring scene.
I:10014;6161;Joss Whedon's masterpiece television series, Firefly, came to the big screen in 2005 with Serenity.
I:10014;6162;This movie really does live up to the series.
I:10014;6163;"I have seen ""Serenity"" roughly 20 times, and, to quote from a line from one of the characters, ""that's never getting old."""
I:10014;6164;but well aware of its grand reputation among many sci.
I:10014;6165;"I watched ""Serenity"" with great expectations."
I:10014;6166;The cast is competent if relatively unknown (I did recognize Adam Baldwin and Ron Glass), even if they look a bit like second.
I:10014;6167;The plot moves toward an intense climax that is satisfying if open.
I:10014;6168;I highly recommend watching the series of Firefly and this, they are just great entertainment.
I:10014;6169;So I went to the movie, and it was just as good.
I:10014;6170;(I'm puzzled how a simple movie can create such emotional responses, but I digress.
I:10014;6171;"well, the whole ""government turned my sister into a psychic super."
I:10014;6172;up action type of movie.
I:10014;6173;It was a movie with a purpose, a movie with a background, and a movie with a purpose beyond the titilation of violence, sex, explosions, and eye candy.
I:10014;6174;Like the best of stories, you leave with the sense that, though what you saw was good, what you didn't see was so much more interesting .
I:10014;6175;and you hope to get a sequel just to delve deeper into that world!
I:10014;6176;but for its ability to sell you on the Universe it has created.
I:10014;6177;this was probably one of the best casts ever assembled (for both the TV series, and the movie).
I:10014;6178;Through great writing and skilled acting, you get a real sense that these are not actors spouting lines, but real characters who have been working on this ship for over a year now, and have developed a true bond.
I:10014;6179;Each actor convincingly fills their space with talent and believability.
I:10014;6180;every line is believable and serves a purpose!
I:10014;6181;This is what TRULY makes this film (and the TV series it came from) so unique and worthy of another fully.
I:10014;6182;The mass audiences of today do not want a deep and well thought out storyline.
I:10014;6183;If you can appreciate the poetic beauty of a true western set in space, this movie will appeal to you.
I:10014;6184;Even so, give this movie a chance to work it's magic!FINAL NOTE .
I:10014;6185;There are so many TV shows getting canceled regardless how good those shows are.
I:10014;6186;All characters were well developed and all actors contributed their A games to this film.
I:10014;6187;The script is very serious and intense, and yet Fillion and Baldwin delivered some what goofiness and humors.
I:10014;6188;Yes, this movie barrowed so many aspects from other type of films and yet turned into something very original.
I:10014;6189;I loved Firefly and was glad the Joss Whedon was able to do Serenity to wrap up loose ends.
I:10014;6190;The movie Serenity is one of the best movies in the last 10.20 years.
I:10014;6191;It is a movie that spans action and human relations.
I:10014;6192;From the opening dialogue to the titles to space action scenes to fight scenes to character revealing conversations this is a movie that stands out above the crowd.
I:10014;6193;I have seen the movie 8 times in theatres and keep finding new gems to admire and appreciate.
I:10014;6194;How they survive and make the hard decisions is a edge of the seat story.
I:10014;6195;fi, action and especially if they are funny.
I:10014;6196;This was the perfect movie for me.
I:10014;6197;It has well portrayed suspense, action and humor.
I:10014;6198;even the villain was outstanding.
I:10014;6199;the special effects where incredible, especially considering the budget they had to work with.
I:10014;6200;I love a pod race as much as the next person, but here we are talking about a space battle involving 80 craft from the perspective of one ship traveling through the battle.
I:10014;6201;And you learn to love 9 characters and their lives.
I:10014;6202;the movie is every bit as good as the TV series Firefly.
I:10014;6203;For you SciFi fans, this is a must own movie.
I:10014;6204;The blue ray is breathtaking.
I:10014;6205;The story is fun and well written.
I:10014;6206;The ship is a masterpiece.
I:10014;6207;If you like the show you will like the movie.
I:10014;6208;The movie completes the series with some changes to make it unique.
I:10014;6209;The commraderie, the humor, the intensity .
I:10014;6210;This movie is slick and fast paced, gritty and action packed.
I:10014;6211;That aside, a great sci.
I:10014;6212;fi movie for all ages.
I:10014;6213;sexual tension and humor with no nudity.
I:10014;6214;all in all a great action flick with some situational humor that comes off as natural and spontaneous.
I:10014;6215;If you are unfamiliar with the series, chances are good you will look for it after seeing this movie.
I:10014;6216;"If you liked the TV series ""Firefly"" that this movie was based upon, you are in for a real surprise with ""Serenity""."
I:10014;6217;"I loved ""Firefly"" and have no doubt it would have been an excellent show given the time to mature."
I:10014;6218;This movie is excellent from beginning to end.
I:10014;6219;"Even if you haven't seen the series, you will be able to follow ""Serenity"" (although I do recommend that you do watch the show before the movie to get the full effect)."
I:10014;6220;Joss Whedon makes you love his characters.
I:10014;6221;And the situations he places them into in this movie makes them shine in ways they didn't in the show.
I:10014;6222;The story is marvelous and the various themes Whedon explores are brilliant (themes also seen in Buffy and Angel).
I:10014;6223;fi flick, this movie is EPIC!
I:10014;6224;My wife, who ordinarily does not like these types of films, also loved the show.
I:10014;6225;"i just can't stop saying how good this movie really is
I:10014;6226;You will love this movie!
I:10014;6227;do anything to see it.
I:10014;6228;Kudos to Joss Whedon on this monumental and unprecedented achievement!
I:10014;6229;caesar says two thumbs enthusiastically way up!
I:10014;6230;it seems clear that Mr. Wheddon and his cast are all comfortable with the roles of the characters which makes the story so credible.
I:10014;6231;At heart it is a western with frontier justice and 'regular' people forming a small community/family in order to survive adversity.
I:10014;6232;which is still recommended regardless given the good writing, great casting, and strong acting .
I:10014;6233;Great story and good special effectsGood chemistry between the characters and an interesting and fast moving plot.
I:10014;6234;This movie is simply amazing.
I:10014;6235;To those of us who loved the series this movie is a treasure.
I:10014;6236;Joss is a masterful storyteller who has created such depth and realism for all of the beloved characters that it really pulls you in, and the special features and commentaries give it excellent replay value.
I:10014;6237;It wasn't aiming deep and it didn't have much of a strong theme, like the Matrix or Star Wars, but it was a lot of fun to watch.
I:10014;6238;It was pretty amazing that he was able to jam so much plot and quirky personality into just two hours.
I:10014;6239;whedon wrote this as fun, light sci.
I:10014;6240;fi entertainment and it was a great success, far better than the dreck usually found on the sci.
I:10014;6241;While knowledge of Firefly is not required, it's not a bad idea, as you gain a deeper appreciation for the characters.
I:10014;6242;It is a unique vision of the future, and just enough grounded dialogue to keep the audience watching.
I:10014;6243;this is, however, the final part of the saga.
I:10014;6244;It's a good ending, and a lot of closure is there.
I:10014;6245;overall, I think you'll like the film, and you'll probably enjoy the TV show.
I:10014;6246;that being said, the movie is fantastic.
I:10014;6247;Aside from a couple of plot points that I could have done without (*ahem*) it's masterful.
I:10014;6248;It's wonderful storytelling about captivating characters on a marvelous adventure.
I:10014;6249;Whether you have seen Firefly or not, I think there is something anyone can enjoy about Serenity.
I:10014;6250;This movie has great action, humor, and special affects and it truly cares about its characters.
I:10014;6251;This was by far the best movie of 2005.
I:10014;6252;i am a unshakable fan of Firefly and Serenity (show me a petition to bring it back or make another movie and I'll sign!)
I:10014;6253;I already had the first release and I ordered this one based on the EXTENDED SCENES lure.
I:10014;6254;Joss, honey, you can do better than this.
I:10014;6255;I got hooked when watching reruns of Serenity on the Syfy channel.
I:10014;6256;I would recommend this movie to any syfy fan.
I:10014;6257;This is just a great movie.
I:10014;6258;I never knew of this series until a friend suggested it a while ago.
I:10014;6259;As a fan of the Firefly TV series, I absolutely LOVE this movie!
I:10014;6260;paced and has some unexpected twists and turns.
I:10014;6261;Plus, it was great to see the cast of Firefly back together!
I:10014;6262;Even if you are not already a Whedon fan, you'll love the quirky dialogue and wonderful characters!
I:10014;6263;So nice that a prematurely cancelled series gets a chance to appear on the big screen as well as have a solid wrap up.
I:10014;6264;Came in good time in good shape Thanks
I:10014;6265;This was a wonderful movie that is a follow up to the Firefly series.
I:10014;6266;This cast makes watching the future fun!
I:10014;6267;The dialog is smart and witty.
I:10014;6268;I devoured all the Firefly episodes and was anxious to see this movie.
I:10014;6269;I found it great for fans and for first time viewers.
I:10014;6270;It gave a quick background and then got right into the story.
I:10014;6271;Thoroughy enjoyable movie with wonderful writing, acting and character development.
I:10014;6272;Even if you have never seen the show, you can appreciate this great film!
I:10014;6273;I don't normally take the time to review movies, but this movie is amazing.
I:10014;6274;I wasn't sure what it would be like I never got to see the show or anything but I love this movie and have bought the Firefly TV Series now too, which is also really good.
I:10014;6275;Definately worth any sci fi fans time and money!
I:10014;6276;I loved Firefly and recently re.
I:10014;6277;It's fun, full of action, and compliments the tv show beautifully.
I:10014;6278;Very enjoyable and entertaining to watch and watch again.
I:10014;6279;I wish the series would have lasted more than one season but this movie does a good job at providing closure for the series.
I:10014;6280;You'll soon be writing your own glowing review of this remarkable movie.
I:10014;6281;anyone will tell you that Nathan Fillion as Captain Reynolds is the heart and soul of this film.
I:10014;6282;A classic movie for all Flans out there (Firefly Fans = Flans).
I:10014;6283;Plenty of great features and a MUST HAVE for your collection.
I:10014;6284;This movie is better than that.
I:10014;6285;Whether you have or have not seen the series, this is great movie.
I:10014;6286;Exciting, suspenseful story, characters that are very real and that you care about.
I:10014;6287;If you haven't seen the series, you will want to after seeing the movie.
I:10014;6288;If you have seen the series, you will want to see the movie.
I:10014;6289;If you've already seen the movie, you will want to see it and the series again!
I:10014;6290;if Firefly was a favorite, you 'll love Serenity.
I:10014;6291;This story was even richer and funnier than Firefly, which I didn't think possible.
I:10014;6292;By the end of Firefly, the actors had formed a chemistry, which I'm happy to say was still there for Serenity.
I:10014;6293;Joss Whedon did a marvelous job telling his story in this medium, and hats off to him for working so hard to bring us, the fans, at least this much.
I:10014;6294;He's become one of my favorite writers for TV or big screen.
I:10014;6295;An amazing gem in the sea of mediocrity that is Modern Film the Film from start to finish has everything humor drama action.
I:10014;6296;firefly was an amazing seriesFirefly will be an amazing seriesYou cant take the sky away from me[.]
I:10014;6297;And I finally got around to watching it recently.
I:10014;6298;This is a 2 hour thrill ride that you will not notice is 2 hours in the least!!!
I:10014;6299;The chemistry between the actors is always noticable, and the humor shared is subtle, but still hits you, and does not lay flat at all!
I:10014;6300;hero was also welcome, even if it was a bit western in feel.
I:10014;6301;once you get past that, Serenity is a great movie, well worthy of multiple viewings.
I:10014;6302;I hope to put it back in the player and watch it with the commentary on.
I:10014;6303;Serenity had what I loved about the series Firefly and added the action pack thrills of a major summer movie.
I:10014;6304;written quips, the fear that after that first death no one was safe, kept our attention for a solid 2 hours.
I:10014;6305;That shows just how popular this series was/has become.
I:10014;6306;the movie was an excellent continuation of a story that was prematurely cut by executives that just didn't undestand Joss Whedon's vision .
I:10014;6307;if you liked it the first time, you'll like it again with all the nifty new additions.
I:10014;6308;It is so sad that the television series was cancelled, the movie is great, with excellent acting, impressive ambiance and great casting/chemistry and the TV series, with the same cast, was equally enjoyable.
I:10014;6309;Interesting way to merge a western with Sci.
I:10014;6310;This movie really pulls all of the Firefly episodes into focus and allows the audience to experience closure of a TV episode that was canceled way to early.
I:10014;6311;It's also nice to see the actors that were in the movie and the series getting some action in Hollywood.
I:10014;6312;This movie is a cult classic for all those people who watched Firefly before it was cancelled.
I:10014;6313;The story sucks you in and takes you on a trip that you can't help but enjoy with characters you seem to be able to relate to.
I:10014;6314;I'll start off by saying that, as a general rule, I really, REALLY hate science fiction.
I:10014;6315;"the great thing about rules is that they were made to be broken, and the Firefly franchise is one of the few exceptions I make in my ""Sci."
I:10014;6316;Rarely are relationships so defined and multi.
I:10014;6317;layered in BOOKS, let alone in TV and movies.
I:10014;6318;Although we get a very condensed version of what makes these people tick, Joss Whedon does a superb job of making both the fan and the casual viewer care about what happens to the crew of Serenity, and the actors are excellent at making those characters believable.
I:10014;6319;He's a monster, and he knows it, but he continues to be one because he truly believes the things he does will benefit mankind in the longrun.
I:10014;6320;As far as I'm concerned, it's the best twist in the whole movie, but I'm weird about stuff like that.
I:10014;6321;Summing up: The writing is fun, the characters are fabulous, the plot brings the action and also makes you think without shoving political statements down your throat, and the movie boasts some of the best underrated actors in the business (Adam Baldwin, Alan Tudyk, Gina Torres, etc.).
I:10014;6322;A great end to an even better series.
I:10014;6323;It nicely wraps up all the storylines that were abruptly cut off from the series cancellation.
I:10014;6324;This movie is very action.
I:10014;6325;Wash will have his revenge!
I:10014;6326;great flic, but I'd recommend watching the Firefly series first.
I:10014;6327;Great ensemble cast, action, and thrills.
I:10014;6328;Serenity was as good as the series, but with more action.
I:10014;6329;It will make so much more sense.
I:10014;6330;I found out about Firefly, and had to pick up the series as well.
I:10014;6331;Although there were some slight deviations from the show, over all I thought they did a good job with the movie of wrapping things up for those of us left hanging.
I:10014;6332;This movie is a great conclusion to one of the finest science fiction series ever.
I:10014;6333;The best part is that you can watch it before or after having watched the Firefly series, and it can stand alone as a great movie with loveable characters.
I:10014;6334;The series is a fun mixture of sci.
I:10014;6335;fi and wild west, with a terrific group of characters and interesting story lines.
I:10014;6336;it was so much fun to watch!
I:10014;6337;"The movie was true to the look, casting, and story
I:10014;6338;When will we see another great story like this?
I:10014;6339;Being an enormous fan of Firefly, I really liked Serenity.
I:10014;6340;Fox completely blew it by canceling such an amazing story.
I:10014;6341;I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the series.
I:10014;6342;a *regular* person who simply likes good sci.
I:10014;6343;The music worked for me, the visuals worked, and all of those thrilling episodes of derring do were deftly mixed with the wonderful touches of humor and humanity that are Joss Whedon's trademark as a writer.
I:10014;6344;if you enjoy space opera, if you enjoy a good western, if you simply enjoy interesting characters doing interesting things while tossing off genuinely amusing wisecracks, then you should probably find some SERENITY now!
I:10014;6345;Now that I'm older, I found this would be a great addition to my blue ray movies.
I:10014;6346;This movie sure brought back old memories and great times.
I:10014;6347;I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys sci fi and theseries Firefly.
I:10014;6348;Bought as a present for me and my significant other.
I:10014;6349;It was an excellent series, blending my favorite subject: science fiction with something I had never thought much of, the classic Western.
I:10014;6350;The blend is pure genius and I savored every episode of the series, just so that I could make it last.
I:10014;6351;I loved the way the characters interacted with each other in such intimate and snarky ways.
I:10014;6352;I loved the series and the movie.
I:10014;6353;River's dialogue consisting of double meanings and answers that portent the future revelation of Miranda, is ever intriguing.
I:10014;6354;But if it is, there was no better way to finish the story than with this outstanding work of art.
I:10014;6355;I have a new hero.
I:10014;6356;Just kiddin' I dream of the whole cast of Serenity.
I:10014;6357;I fell in love with this show and would even call myself a browncoat and follow these guys right back to space.
I:10014;6358;Wash and Book were great and did the series credit!If you haven't seen the show.
I:10014;6359;This is old west adventure set in the future.
I:10014;6360;The writing, character buildup, creativeness, everything is great!
I:10014;6361;Kids are welcome to watch this show, however the TV series has PG 13 scenes not suitable for kids.
I:10014;6362;I just felt like saying something cliched, but it fits perfectly.
I:10014;6363;I loved the TV series, and I would say the movie is actually better.
I:10014;6364;This series and movie is something that every since sci.
I:10014;6365;I had not seen the Firefly TV series, but am a fan of Buffy and Angel.
I:10014;6366;"Serenity offers Joss Whedon's wit in a ""realistic"" sci."
I:10014;6367;The repartee among the ensemble cast is so enjoyable, I've watched it multiple times just for the dialogue and the laughs it brings.
I:10014;6368;This is a fantastic Sci.
I:10014;6369;line, GREAT ACTION, and some parts that make you jump or cringe.
I:10014;6370;Poor Phantom Menance, and yet it makes a great comparison to Serenity, an underrated movie with one tenth the budget that delivers 5,000% square rooted by a prime string theory.
I:10014;6371;great cast, great writing, things that go boom AND boo, what more could you ask for unless you were incredibly high maintenance?
I:10014;6372;Nothing, that's what!Watch it, otherwise you'll be missing out on a great movie experience and people will talk about you behind your back.
I:10014;6373;This one was a rare exception.
I:10014;6374;It is a little darker than the series, and honestly I liked the look of everything better in the show, but once I got into it I didn't even notice anymore.
I:10014;6375;I like that the movie serves to wrap up the show very well, and yet still manages to make you tear up.
I:10014;6376;I was so happy when Joss got the backing to make Serenity.
I:10014;6377;The characters, the social strata of the 'Verse and all make for such great storytelling.
I:10014;6378;And Serenity is better than Empire.
I:10014;6379;Every time I watched it I saw something new.
I:10014;6380;Very well shot and presented.
I:10014;6381;Really good and adds to the series.
I:10014;6382;As in good, very good.
I:10014;6383;the movie manage to be realistic enough to make the viewer think it possible, but fictional enough so they realizes it wouldn't.
I:10014;6384;fi I've seen there is refreshing simplicity to it.
I:10014;6385;*A note to this whose friends recommended Serenity: There is a section where Joss literally tells the fans to recommend it like crazy.
I:10014;6386;It is a wonderful movie that is about characters which drive the plot and not fancy computer created graphics.
I:10014;6387;If you see the movie in a sort of symbiosis, you'll find the movie way more enjoyable.
I:10014;6388;Actually, I've heard of many first seeing the movie and liking it so much that they went and bought the series afterwards.
I:10014;6389;you'll be glad you did!All in all, a beautiful space western that deserved to have its story told.
I:10014;6390;this one was truly a breath of fresh air.
I:10014;6391;"I'm a huge FireFly fan, and I attend ""Can't Stop the Serenity"" events every time I can."
I:10014;6392;This gives me a chance, at least once a year, to see this movie again in a nice theater with great sound.
I:10014;6393;"I finally really hear and feel those initial explosions in the film (during the ""Earth."
I:10014;6394;part), all that great music, the battle with the Reavers just beyond the Ion Cloud .
I:10014;6395;It's so much closer to that movie theater experience for this movie.
I:10014;6396;I'd give it more stars if I could!
I:10014;6397;out the stories as he does so well) but I will happily take a second movie.
I:10014;6398;Nathan Fillion's portrayal of Mal ranks up there with the greatest male actors in history.
I:10014;6399;"He has the ""man's man"" vibe with humorist sensibilities, able to care about his crew like no other, and threaten to shoot them all for an ideal."
I:10014;6400;One of the best sci fi films ever made!
I:10014;6401;All the favorite characters are here in a feature length film.
I:10014;6402;5 out of 5 One of my favorite films!
I:10014;6403;Joss Whedon is a genius, and the ideas were great as were the effects, the costumes, the music, the videography.
I:10014;6404;But for me the most important part of drama of any sort is how the players work together, 'ensemble'.
I:10014;6405;The Firefly/Serenity cast are magical, the chemistry of the troupe is just remarkable.
I:10014;6406;There are hundreds of positive reviews on the film, most by fans of the show, many however, by people who gave the movie a chance and came away very surprised.
I:10014;6407;And after viewing the film, you can see why.
I:10014;6408;I can think of no show or movie that got treated the way it did, and yet triumphs in the hearts of thousands of people as the end all be all of great storytelling.
I:10014;6409;Love this :) A pretty good way to wrap up a series that should have run much longer.
I:10014;6410;I loved the world Joss created, I was invested in the characters and I was very sad when the show was canceled.
I:10014;6411;The story line is smart, sharp and doesn't pull any punches.
I:10014;6412;There were moments when I had to actually remind myself to sit back in my seat, so intense was the action.
I:10014;6413;It has something for everyone, action, adventure, romance, light comedy, and most of all, it has a story line that makes sense and doesn't cheat the audience.
I:10014;6414;I highly recommend this movie and once you've seen it you too will become a fan!
I:10014;6415;This movie is enjoyable from beginning to end.
I:10014;6416;The cast is truly amazing to watch, and everyone of them is very entertaining.
I:10014;6417;The special effects are very good, and the story is involving and intricate.
I:10014;6418;fi/action/western/dramedy that is fun, but at the same time can be serious and deep.
I:10014;6419;(I have since seen the show and it is great as well.)
I:10014;6420;The movie was a well done story that answers many of the questions left when the Firefly series was terminated.
I:10014;6421;If you enjoyed Firefly then Serenity is definitely worth your time.
I:10014;6422;The writing, acting, effects and direction is superior!
I:10014;6423;The movie script makes use of psychobabble and talk of behavior modification which at times is unique for a sci.
I:10014;6424;I would rate this movie as one of my top 10 favorites of all time.
I:10014;6425;The characters are engaging and believable.
I:10014;6426;The story keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:10014;6427;It has moments where you want to stand up and cheer, moments of laughter, and moments of sadness all mixed in a very good way.
I:10014;6428;The effects, set design, costumes, locations, and props were all extremely well done.
I:10014;6429;This is, I believe, is Joss Whedons greatest work.
I:10014;6430;i rated this film as five stars .
I:10014;6431;Serenity satisfied every expectation I had for the film and more.
I:10014;6432;The movie is both faithful to the fans and to a new audience.
I:10014;6433;The cast was very good.
I:10014;6434;When they say this is an action film it is absolutely true.
I:10014;6435;Even the villian was heroic in the end.
I:10014;6436;It is a rousing good time with many suprises and well worth viewing.
I:10014;6437;What I can speak to is from the point of view of an actor in this business for a long time .
I:10014;6438;This is what film used to be, A great story, a director writer who knows his craft, A cast of actors who play it real and with heart.
I:10014;6439;This film and series have restored a little faith that good work can still be done.
I:10014;6440;Congrats Joss keep up the good work Thomas
I:10014;6441;Almost as good as star trek.
I:10014;6442;This movie is a must.
I:10014;6443;"see, if you were a fan of the series ""Firefly""."
I:10014;6444;I highly recommend the movie to fill in many gaps that were left when Firefly was cancelled.
I:10014;6445;Joss Whedon is an absolute genius!
I:10014;6446;He created in my opinion the three best TV shows in history (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly) and now he has created one of the greatest films I have ever seen in 'Serenity'.
I:10014;6447;The witty dialogue, incredible character relationships, and amazing action sequences are only the tip of the iceberg for what only can be described as cinematic bliss.
I:10014;6448;fy movie, better watch right now.
I:10014;6449;Star Wars or Star Trek fan, this beats both shows.
I:10014;6450;Great acting and no aliens and it is like the wild west in the outer planets.
I:10014;6451;one of Joss Wedens best films and tv series.
I:10014;6452;It is a great movie, and it was a great tv series.
I:10014;6453;After watching this movie I remembered seeing it on TV in the past.
I:10014;6454;It is a good movie with action and suspense.
I:10014;6455;makes you love believable characters, then has believable things happen to them that you don't like.
I:10014;6456;and please hire a decent tutor to stop the actors from mangling their Mandarin Chinese lines, or better yet, get a first year student of Mandarin to dub them.
I:10014;6457;I loved that this movie was made to satisfy fans, but it still wasn't enough.
I:10014;6458;Over the years, I've become a huge Joss Whedon fan, for his thoughtfully and intelligently written shows Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel, each filled with gut.
I:10014;6459;busting humor, smart and clever dialogue, involving character development and careful, calculated plotting.
I:10014;6460;Simply put: the man is a master storyteller.
I:10014;6461;to maximize your enjoyment of Serenity, it is best that you watchFireflyfirst.
I:10014;6462;Thanks to a brilliantly written introduction, this film is accessible to everyone, but everything is enhanced if you know more about the characters' background and motivation.
I:10014;6463;If you watch it all in order, you will be rewarded handsomely.
I:10014;6464;But all that means is that the most entertaining movie of the year could've been better if it was 18 hours long.
I:10014;6465;A lot of scenes that were cut, you can watch on this edition as well as the previous single.
I:10014;6466;this movie has something for everyone.
I:10014;6467;It's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's unpredictable, it even has a little romance.
I:10014;6468;universal should've released this 2.
I:10014;6469;the original features are entertaining to watch again.
I:10014;6470;The box is nice and shiny, though.
I:10014;6471;That would be very, very nice.
I:10014;6472;someone else mentioned that the new features are also found on an Australian 2.
I:10014;6473;Normally, a cast commentary leaves you with little other than a feeling that your friends are talking over a movie you like, but Joss keeps most of them grounded and there's plenty of laughs and interesting info.
I:10014;6474;Ron is mostly quiet and Summer is adorably shy, but put on the spot by Joss often enough to get her out of her shell.
I:10014;6475;Lots of behind the scenes bits.
I:10014;6476;take A Walk on Serenity .
I:10014;6477;A cool short with Joss and the cast talking about the new Serenity set and the little differences between the film and the show.
I:10014;6478;This is just a special that aired on Sci.
I:10014;6479;Probably the best feature, showing River's sudden transformation from a bright young girl to what we know her as now.
I:10014;6480;The characters, stories, and humor is very well writen and acted.
I:10014;6481;Firefly was so good I felt my heart drop knowing that i'm watching my last episode of this awsome series.
I:10014;6482;I'll be a Browncoat for life.
I:10014;6483;One of Joss Whedon's best works.
I:10014;6484;They tied up the loose ends from the series, addressed how things came to be and it was a great, fast paced and exciting movie!!!
I:10014;6485;I saw the movie after I watched the show and was very pleased with the CGI story and acting in the movie!
I:10014;6486;Joss Whedon does some lovely thing with the camerawork and filming to distinguish this from the television medium that he's been working in forever.
I:10014;6487;toe with Oscar Wilde and Quentin Tarantino any day.
I:10014;6488;George Lucas isn't even very good by Hollywood action movie standards.)
I:10014;6489;every year there are movies that fly under the radar, either because of poor distribution or audience expectations, yet they are wonderful and worth seeing.
I:10014;6490;Serenity, bouyed and crippled by its relation to a failed television show, is one of the 2005 great movies that should have done better.
I:10014;6491;the story is fairly simple.
I:10014;6492;Every character in the movie is fully realized and believable.
I:10014;6493;The sense of passion, excitement and victory amongst the crowd was something that's rare to experience today.
I:10014;6494;"i've shown the movie to my friends, and most of them said, ""It was good,"" while a couple loved it."
I:10014;6495;alone film, but, in all honesty, will probably be much more poignant and meaningful if you've seen the 'Firefly' series.
I:10014;6496;otherwise, prepare yourself for an amazing film that BBC voted the #1 movie of 2005.
I:10014;6497;check out Serenity, and tell everyone you know about it.
I:10014;6498;If you have seen the Firefly TV series this is a great movie.
I:10014;6499;Otherwise it is just a good movie.
I:10014;6500;You will instantly be hooked.
I:10014;6501;I have to say I love this movie.
I:10014;6502;The challenge that I have is that there are times when it seems the movie does not fit exactly into the series, but I still absolutely love the movie.
I:10014;6503;a perfect finale to the much loved series firefly.
I:10014;6504;no spoilers here just lettin you know this is a great movie.
I:10014;6505;ifyou're new to the 'verse prepare to be blown away, it will be your favorite new addiction!
I:10014;6506;The cast and crew of Serenity mesh so well together and the plot is great.
I:10014;6507;This movie at least brought a ending to a great series.
I:10014;6508;For those of us who loved the TV series Firefly, this movie provides the raison d'etre for River.
I:10014;6509;The movie finally tells us her story and does a superb job of tying up all the loose ends.
I:10014;6510;This movie is, to me, the perfect follow on to the tragically short lived TV series.
I:10014;6511;I have been a SciFi fan since the 1950s and this is one of my all time favs.
I:10014;6512;A worthy finale for the TV show.
I:10014;6513;Great SciFi and wrap up on the Firefly series.
I:10014;6514;Simply the best show on television and a wonderful movie.
I:10014;6515;A story this great, and characters so wonderful, are a rare creation.
I:10014;6516;This is my favorite movie.
I:10014;6517;If you liked Firefly you will love the movie.
I:10014;6518;And with any hope there will be many more to come.
I:10014;6519;"this movie can be enjoyed as a follow up to the series ""Firefly"" or on its own."
I:10014;6520;It is an amazing adventure you can watch over and over again.
I:10014;6521;The story hits hard and fast, soon after introducing the wonderfully deep characters.
I:10014;6522;The story will leave you enthralled, inspired, and in shock.
I:10014;6523;Though the actors names are not yet well known on the big screen, they are the next up and coming big stars in my opinion.
I:10014;6524;then a friend recommended I actually watch the series before opening my big mouth.
I:10014;6525;:) I do have to add that you can watch it and it will make sense without having seen the show but watching it does help.
I:10014;6526;The movie was great, the acting was superb and the storyline flowed nicely.
I:10014;6527;The movie has alot of heart.
I:10014;6528;I saw the movie review and thought it might be an interesting movie.
I:10014;6529;This movie is the top movie I have seen besides March of the Penguins for 2005.
I:10014;6530;I hope they do make a sequel.
I:10014;6531;Nathan Fillion and his cast are wonderful.
I:10014;6532;hour TV episode into a movie that is worthy being called 'great'.
I:10014;6533;The actresses cast to represent them are gems, each an every one of them, each in their own way.
I:10014;6534;ass ladies, each naturally possessed of a sharply.
I:10014;6535;drawn and distinct character, who combine intelligence and strength with an edgy sweetness that's never vacuous.
I:10014;6536;But I also hope that they will never have to struggle to find work, preferably in roles where they can enchant their audience as much as they have done in Firefly and Serenity.
I:10014;6537;My wife, who has a pathological aversion to all things science fiction and fantasy, actually liked both the series and the movie.
I:10014;6538;The characters in Serenity and Firefly are the primary focus and they are real, interesting, and funny.
I:10014;6539;Joss Whedon is one of the most extremely talented people working in the entertainment industry today.
I:10014;6540;His work on the brilliant television series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER showcased Whedon's versatility as both a writer and a director.
I:10014;6541;His last series, FIREFLY, proved that he was capable of making most anything excellent.
I:10014;6542;Now those fans can rejoice: SERENITY, the feature film adaptation of FIREFLY, has arrived.
I:10014;6543;though it's not essential for one to watch FIREFLY before watching SERENITY, I highly recommend that you do.
I:10014;6544;For those who decide against it, though, Joss Whedon has done a terrific job of explaining the backstory from the show.
I:10014;6545;The sequence in which the characters are introduced is even more brilliant.
I:10014;6546;On the contrary, Whedon's script is laced with his trademark wit and originality.
I:10014;6547;another Whedon trademark is realistic characters, and the characters in SERENITY are certainly realistic.
I:10014;6548;Despite this, the crew of SERENITY are most definitely heroes.
I:10014;6549;"Finally he pipes up and says, ""Well ."
I:10014;6550;As far as filmmaking goes, SERENITY is a very impressive piece of work.
I:10014;6551;The lighting is as realistic as could be.
I:10014;6552;David Newman's score is good, and at times its excellent, though it's a far cry from Greg Edmonson's popular score from FIREFLY.
I:10014;6553;Each member of the cast delivers a great performance.
I:10014;6554;Particularly delightful is Summer Glau, who makes River seem extremely amusing and wildly unpredictable while also making her someone to pity.
I:10014;6555;Nathan Fillion is also terrific as Mal Reynolds.
I:10014;6556;Mal is very likable, dedicated, and sometimes clever, but he's human just like everyone else.
I:10014;6557;Also of note is Adam Baldwin, who is hilarious as the brutish Jayne.
I:10014;6558;there is one moment in particular that I really loved.
I:10014;6559;screen directorial debut, and what an impressive one it is.
I:10014;6560;SERENITY is an original, intelligent, old.
I:10014;6561;fans may enjoy it as well, but it's clear that this was designed for those many people who helped turn the complete series set of FIREFLY into one of the best.
I:10014;6562;I love the Firefly television show and Serenity was great!
I:10014;6563;Whedon knows how to use action without supplanting the story.
I:10014;6564;There's some good choreography, and he's smart enough of a director to allow the viewers to follow the action instead of substituting quick cuts thinking he'll trick the audience into thinking they're excited.
I:10014;6565;this was also a great film for Whedon to showcase his visual talents.
I:10014;6566;With a relatively small budget (I think it was 40 million) he is able to immerse us into a believable and unique world.
I:10014;6567;He is also smart enough to vary the landscape.
I:10014;6568;As anyone who has watched Firefly or Buffy knows, when you're watching those shows you feel that not only are you getting to know the characters on screen but the creator behind those characters as well.
I:10014;6569;One of Whedon's great abilities is to make sure the audience is never complacent.
I:10014;6570;in closing, Firefly fans will probably be more pleased than novices, but whoever you are I guarantee you'll be entertained.
I:10014;6571;This is an overrated film.
I:10014;6572;If you look browse movie websites you will see that this movie has good reviews yet didn't make enough money in theaters.
I:10014;6573;If you were a fan of Firefly or just like space westerns, this movie is for you.
I:10014;6574;Even if you never watched the series you can get into this movie as it was written with a stand alone tone to it.
I:10014;6575;But I don't think I will, any ways highly recommended for Firefly fans.
I:10014;6576;Got it for Christmas together with Firefly and would love to see the sequel.
I:10014;6577;Definitely worth spending the money.
I:10014;6578;Lets open up the book, I was a fan of the series when I first saw the pilot and thought the movie was ok.
I:10014;6579;The small pauses that you developed and learned more about them.
I:10014;6580;But as a film, its is one of the best sci.
I:10014;6581;I just love the idea and love the box.
I:10014;6582;And also new commentary track by some of the cast.
I:10014;6583;Overall the extra content is intressting and special, and it feels right for being a collectors edition.
I:10014;6584;Great movie and great series.
I:10014;6585;I think this is one of the best science fiction movies I have ever seen.
I:10014;6586;Lots of action and adventure with a good mixture of comedy and drama.
I:10014;6587;I just recently became a huge fan of the series, and this movie was amazing.
I:10014;6588;Joss Whedon is a great director.
I:10014;6589;fi channel, certainly not something that I would expect to see at the cinemas and it is clear from the box office results that most people agreed with my view.
I:10014;6590;The movie was very good and as it stated it would be!
I:10014;6591;Thanks for all of the things done!
I:10014;6592;ray definition and clarity are outstanding.
I:10014;6593;Well written and well directed, this movie converts more fans everyday and is on its way to becoming a popular hit long after it opened in theaters.
I:10014;6594;fi adventure series, Firefly, (which was never given half a chance on Fox network), this film runs the emotional gamet of laughter and tears with several thought.
I:10014;6595;"provoking scenes that keep you thinking ""What if."""
I:10014;6596;"Serenity is the best science fiction film since ""The Matrix"" and for true fans of the series, it is a literal dream come true."
I:10014;6597;alone popcorn affair so much as it is the greatest series finale in history.
I:10014;6598;packed, full of quirky characters both familiar and new, and just plain cool to boot.
I:10014;6599;There is also a deep philosophical argument explored as the costs of personal freedom and government control are contrasted in a brilliant manner.
I:10014;6600;Half of writing history is covering up the truth is just one of the memorable observations made by our heroes over the course of this journey.
I:10014;6601;Part of the genius of the series (and this film) are the insane rantings of River, which begin to make sense if you pay attention.
I:10014;6602;"It never touched them but they're drowning in it"" may seem nonsensical to some, but it is a rather poetic yet eerily accurate representation of both the government officials in her universe, and in ours."
I:10014;6603;The events taking place in this future are vaguely familair as plot devices, but what makes them brilliant is the way they relate to what's happening in our society.
I:10014;6604;Serenity's crew includes an endearing assortment of contrasting characters that all get their moments to shine in the film: Jayne the hardcore mercenary, Kailee the loveable mechanic, Mal's old war buddy Zoe, and her pilot/comedian husband Wash are all well represented.
I:10014;6605;malcolm's love interest who happens to be a well.
I:10014;6606;turn up along the way as well.
I:10014;6607;"the style of the universe that our heroes inhabit is still a mix of all of the cultures of ""Earth."
I:10014;6608;This movie is both epic and personal, hilarious and heart.
I:10014;6609;breaking, deeply thoughtful yet fun.
I:10014;6610;It represents the fulfillment of a promise from it's creator and is a miracle unto itself that came about simply because the fans refused to let his brilliant creation die just because of a bad decision by a biased television executive.
I:10014;6611;"The story behind the film is almost as uplifting as the film itself and serves to justify those of us who support the things we love, even years after they've ""died""."
I:10014;6612;"not unlike the characters themselves., ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" may have flown in under the public's radar, but for those of us who know what great entertainment is capable of, this is the stuff we live for seeing and we're happy to keep it our little secret."
I:10014;6613;"all the relationships are so carefully delineated in ""Serenity"", that you actually care what happens to all the denizens of the old junker firefly."
I:10014;6614;that, capped with great dialogue, thrilling action and stunts and plot elements that don't all center around board meetings, makes for some mighty thrilling, whiz bang entertainment!
I:10014;6615;Whedon was always determined to finish telling his story, and with the support of Universal Studios, completed a screenplay for the film that would become Serenity.
I:10014;6616;released in 2005, Serenity is a triumphant return for the crew of the Firefly, and a magnificent achievement on almost all levels.
I:10014;6617;Once a passenger on the spaceship Serenity, the waifish River's importance is tremendously elevated, and her role expanded to include some impressive fight scenes.
I:10014;6618;Fillion also has several extended fight sequences.
I:10014;6619;Pilot Hoban `Wash' Washburne (Alan Tudyk) shines in the battle sequences in space.
I:10014;6620;Shepherd Book's (Ron Glass) appearance is brief, but very touching.
I:10014;6621;the backstory of the mysterious Reavers is revealed, when the Serenity arrives at the ghost planet Miranda.
I:10014;6622;the special effects heavy Serenity, looks absolutely fabulous on Blu.
I:10014;6623;Joss Whedon's presence is extensive, as he provides a solo commentary, and one with members of the cast recorded in 2007, that can also be viewed as inserted video onscreen.
I:10014;6624;While the film may not totally satisfy the desires of all hardcore fans, it does a very good job of covering most of the high points, and winding up most of the loose ends, as Whedon was not counting on doing another sequel.
I:10014;6625;As over five years have passed, it seems that he made a wise choice.
I:10014;6626;The show Firefly was really good.
I:10014;6627;Despite initially being somewhat put off seeing it by the rabid behavior of some of the more fanatical fans of the series, Serenity was easily the most enjoyable of this year's admittedly disappointing crop of Summer movies, so naturally it proved a box.
I:10014;6628;As if aware that this probably was a last shot deal, Joss Whedon manages to provide a genuinely satisfying finale to the dominant plot.
I:10014;6629;But beyond that, he takes some surprising chances, particularly his willingness to kill off key cast members (one of the few areas where seeing the TV series actually is necessary: without their backstories it's unlikely their genuinely unexpected deaths would be quite so affecting), providing a sci.
I:10014;6630;fi movie that's not just sassy and funny but also surprisingly touching as well.
I:10014;6631;the setpieces are both fun and ingenious (not least the way they manage to break through the bad guys' blockade) but not without consequences, and the big secret at the heart of the conspiracy actually makes sense.
I:10014;6632;This is a good wrap up, though there a few things I wish would have been brought back in.
I:10014;6633;It will give you more emotional involvement with the characters and a better feel for their background.
I:10014;6634;Anyone who liked the series Firefly will love this movie.
I:10014;6635;What a wonderful series Firefly was.
I:10014;6636;"All those familiar with the ""Firefly"" verse will already be quite familiar with it."
I:10014;6637;* The menus are laid out quite nicely and look good.
I:10014;6638;These 9 crew members function in very specific ways for very specific reasons, both as individuals and as a group.
I:10014;6639;"Though the movie does do an admirable job of giving you the ""crash course"" in roll."
I:10014;6640;Those of us who saw this movie having already seen the TV show went in with great affection and genuine concern for the fate of its characters.
I:10014;6641;those of you that have seen and enjoyed the TV show have most likely already seen this movie, so I won't take up anyone's time by comparing the two.
I:10014;6642;screenings, is particularly touching and immediately reminds the fans exactly why we love these people.
I:10014;6643;the features are pleasant enough and the extended scenes are well worth watching.
I:10014;6644;As a fan, I'm obviously happy to own this movie.
I:10014;6645;"screen' movie which Joss Whedon describes as ""a thank you to the fans."
I:10014;6646;"And that is exactly what the film version of Serenity"" is."
I:10014;6647;On the exterior it is a fast.
I:10014;6648;past, character driven, science fiction blast for everyone to enjoy, and the people that did see it did enjoy it alot.
I:10014;6649;fiction or just good storytelling this is a movie for you.
I:10014;6650;Its a good movie for SiFi Fans, but im sorry to say only for them.
I:10014;6651;So four stars is all i can do.
I:10014;6652;fi films, however, and I happened to notice many positive reviews about `Serenity,' so I gave it a try.
I:10014;6653;it is a pleasant surprise because the film is so good.
I:10014;6654;Characters are lively, the dialogues are snappy and occasionally funny, and the film's story is intriguing.
I:10014;6655;The special effects are very good (though some still need improvement), but what is remarkable about the film is the wits of the creator Joss Whedon who manages to keep telling this good, old Western.
I:10014;6656;in short, this is what a good action film should be, and you can enjoy watching it without knowing anything about the history of the production.
I:10014;6657;The back story of the future world and the characters are cleverly explained in the opening, so you don't have to read long subtitles to understand them.
I:10014;6658;"like many other TV series that are loved by us for generations, ""Serenity"" presents the credible relations between the flawed but likable characters through a series of slightly episodic actions, and those relations are what really matters."
I:10014;6659;I am one who bought into all the hype that this is actually a good movie.
I:10014;6660;Witty dialog, likeable characters, great plot, excellent effects, and a story to wrap it all together.
I:10014;6661;The acting and plot are some of the best I have seen in a science fiction movie in a long time .
I:10014;6662;The special effect are some the best of It's time and still hold up today.
I:10014;6663;I really enjoyed Firefly so of course I liked the movie.
I:10014;6664;Alas, a strong fan base was able to convince producers to bring this wonderful story of frontierspeople against the mega.
I:10014;6665;society complex to the big screen.
I:10014;6666;"Best viewed after watching the entire ""Firefly"" series to understand the context, but also stands alone as a entertaining movie."
I:10014;6667;The movie is awesome with lots of action.
I:10014;6668;Great action, special effects, good acting.
I:10014;6669;Also enjoyed the series it inspired.
I:10014;6670;Recommend for all SciFi buffs.
I:10014;6671;This is a good follow up to the Firefly tv show.
I:10014;6672;The characters are well thought out and played very well by each actor.
I:10014;6673;So I wanted to take the piece of paper off the back that the company put on there to explain what was on the discs and I ripped off a good deal of the top inch or so of the paper of the back graphic, so now it has ripped paper on the top and bottom.
I:10014;6674;I thought this was a very good and entertaining movie.
I:10014;6675;Serenity is fun to watch and has good characters and a good story.
I:10014;6676;It has just enough tongue in cheek humor to give it another angle that makes it enjoyable.
I:10014;6677;i recommend this movie to both sci.
I:10014;6678;I enjoyed it and so did a lot of my friends who were as in the dark about the concept and the show as I was.
I:10014;6679;"For me that comes in the form of Jewel Staite 
I:10014;6680;and the rest of the cast of 'Serenity'This is the film continuation of the sci.
I:10014;6681;fi cult show 'Firefly' as it loosely picks up where the show left of and takes on an epic adventure.
I:10014;6682;A ride that leads to secrets revealed, fan satisfactions given and a few unexpected and saddening twists all for the soul purpose of giving this original fan favorite epic the proper send off that it deserved.
I:10014;6683;fi cult classics like 'The Fifth Element' 'Tron' and 'Akira' a film that is rich in character development and story and keeps you entertained from beginning to end.
I:10014;6684;polite operative is entertaining, and good comedy.
I:10014;6685;the real magic is taking wild twists on familiar ground.
I:10014;6686;out, but this cleverness never sterilizes its emotional core, the characters.
I:10014;6687;But noodling out underlying meanings isn't required, it's perfectly enjoyable at face value.
I:10014;6688;It's very good to watch after the devastation of finding out there is no more firefly.
I:10014;6689;All the actors and actresses did a great job.
I:10014;6690;Well written, acted and produced.
I:10014;6691;Loved this movie, it helped to wrap up stuff left hanging in the series.
I:10014;6692;When the flick came out I loved it.
I:10014;6693;Loved it so much I saw it more then once.
I:10014;6694;Loved it so much I just had to have the three part series of comic books that gapped the time between the final Firefly episode (Objects In Space) and the film (Serenity).
I:10014;6695;Joss Whedon it's such a visionary.
I:10014;6696;If you are a fan of the series, you MUST watch the movie to tie the knots and allow yourself to find closure.
I:10014;6697;This is a movie that I came upon from the critics on TV (you know, two names of two guys that have a lot to say).
I:10014;6698;I enjoyed both the male and female roles and this is usually not the case for me.
I:10014;6699;The way that the spaceship looked and was laid out was great to look at.
I:10014;6700;The TV shows will give you a lot of insight on the characters and how they interact and this makes the movie much more enjoyable.
I:10014;6701;I feel that there is so much good stuff out there why would I want to take up the time watching something more that at least twice.
I:10014;6702;this movie was very enjoyable, particularly on blu ray.
I:10014;6703;The picture and sound are excellent.
I:10014;6704;For all you out there, this is really NOT Science Fiction, the great literature we sci fi fans love to read (and sometimes write).
I:10014;6705;A must for Joss Whedon fans and sci fi lovers also!
I:10014;6706;"It was ""Star Trek"" with guts, verve, hormones and nowhere near the faith in big government and big space navies."
I:10014;6707;and the movie it spawned, Serenity, is even better than that.
I:10014;6708;All the fun folks we loved so well from Firefly, plus new characters, some you'll love, some you won't love so much, some you won't care for at all.
I:10014;6709;paced action, with immediacy, humor, and passion.
I:10014;6710;It's an adventure epic, a spy story, a fantasy/science fiction masterpiece, and more than any of that, it's the very best thing Joss Whedon ever set his hand to.
I:10014;6711;fi fan, but this movie was great.
I:10014;6712;Have you ever started a fabulous book, engaging, well.
I:10014;6713;Fabulous acting, great stories, many questions unanswered .
I:10014;6714;but because the fans demanded it, eventually Whedon's miracle arrived, and a movie was made.
I:10014;6715;The dialogue is fantastic: witty, funny, sometimes very apt.
I:10014;6716;dumpty, is a master of the words he uses, bending them to his will.
I:10014;6717;"There's ""shiny"" and ""companion"" and ""nethers""."
I:10014;6718;"And perhaps, my favorite, the use of the word ""'verse"" to mean ""universe"" ."
I:10014;6719;the movie starts and ends with discussions of love.
I:10014;6720;The nameless operative also understands the power of belief.
I:10014;6721;Mal, during the movie, also learns to believe again .
I:10014;6722;There's a wonderful exchange, in which the nameless operative asks Mal if he is ready to die for his beliefs.
I:10014;6723;they're both good people .
I:10014;6724;He finally gets to be considered a genuine hero and perhaps that should have been acknowledged.
I:10014;6725;nevertheless a wonderful movie and a tribute to the faith of the fans and Firefly's creators.
I:10014;6726;While I'm not happy about Firefly not being continued and this movie wasn't what I would've chosen for an ending for the Firefly series, it still is a good movie.
I:10014;6727;Not going to the theater good, but good enough to own at home.
I:10014;6728;Well besides Batman Begins this was my favorite movie of 2005.
I:10014;6729;It was 2 solid hours of entertainment.
I:10014;6730;I could go on and on but the simple truth is that this is a very good Sci.
I:10014;6731;fi film, probably one of the best in years.
I:10014;6732;This is a rich universe that is real and tangible.
I:10014;6733;I was impressed with how well this movie was done, the acting is at times tongue and cheek just like humans not actors and I didnt once hit the fast forward button.
I:10014;6734;If you liked the series Firefly, this ties up the lose ends wonderfully.
I:10014;6735;If you have never seen the series, you will still be able to follow the movie perfectly, and you will fall in love with the cast, then you will need to watch the series.
I:10014;6736;ray format won the war.
I:10014;6737;You may be gone, but you will always be the winner of my heart.
I:10014;6738;The storyline is excellent, with Mal, his crew and his passengers conducting shady dealings like payroll heists but, true to their pasts idealists as well.
I:10014;6739;the movie is great fun and certainly one of the best science fiction films of the last few years.
I:10014;6740;This movie is an incredible achievement.
I:10014;6741;Of course, first I have to work my way back through 7 seasons of Buffy!Joss Whedon is a great writer and a great storyteller.
I:10014;6742;i'm a huge Firefly/Serenity fan and a huge Joss Whedon fan in general so I got the collector's edition.
I:10014;6743;It has all the extras from the first release (good job, guys!)
I:10014;6744;and lots of new stuff.
I:10014;6745;This is really worth the money.
I:10014;6746;The Complete Seriesyet, I recommend checking it out first.
I:10014;6747;This is a fantastic movie based on an even more fantastic (cancelled) tv show.
I:10014;6748;So much has yet to be revealed.
I:10014;6749;Climb aboard for a fun ride.
I:10014;6750;but the magic of this movie is that it takes all these hoary standards, stirs them up and comes up with something that is fresh, original and bucketloads of fun.
I:10014;6751;I suspect part of the exuberance has to do with the casting .
I:10014;6752;And the action and effects .
I:10014;6753;and the exquisite little River Tam (River .
I:10014;6754;The series is good, but the movie is even better.
I:10014;6755;It's full of action, adventure and a few twists.
I:10014;6756;This is definitely a keeper.
I:10014;6757;This is an excellent fun movie, characters worked, and well put together.
I:10014;6758;Gets a big thumbs up, good job.
I:10014;6759;Great cast, brilliant one liners.
I:10014;6760;Watch the show before watching the movie.
I:10014;6761;It will make it a whole lot more enjoyable.
I:10014;6762;This is a great movie , As is the Firefly series that it followed .
I:10014;6763;This cultish movie was great fun to watch and am glad a friend told me about the series.
I:10014;6764;Very well done, good acting, the right casts, written in good dept, a must see movie for Firefly fans.
I:10014;6765;I have it always available to watch it every now and then.
I:10014;6766;A good combination and balance of action, drama, space exploration, comedy and justice makes this movie one of my favorite ones.
I:10014;6767;But I'll show you some critics views on the movie.
I:10014;6768;"orson Scott Card, one of, if not the, greatest science fiction writers of all time, and Hugo/Nebula award winning author, said, ""I'm not going to say it's the best science fiction movie, ever."
I:10014;6769;"Dom, of Mega Tokyo, the incredibly popular web comic, said, And, without having any experience with Joss Whedon's writing style, without having any prior knowledge of anything that had ever happened in Firefly, I watched the movie."""
I:10014;6770;"The movie was excellent at changing gears from tension to humor to action, and for perhaps the first time in years, I was actually at the edge of my seat sometimes instead of slouching back."""
I:10014;6771;The writing is impeccable, the chemistry among the cast is fantastic, the performances are great, and the action is non.
I:10014;6772;The dialogue is sharp, witty, quickfire and sarcasm filled.
I:10014;6773;He's also got a great understanding of how to pull the audience's strings.
I:10014;6774;Tension, suspense and impending danger often twist around in a shocking or explosive moment delivering a good deal of the entertainment value.
I:10014;6775;He's without a doubt a great writer and director and he shows it here, he's a great entertainer.
I:10014;6776;Without a doubt this movie is incredible.
I:10014;6777;Great acting, writing, cinematography, the whole works.
I:10014;6778;A friend suggested I watch Firefly.
I:10014;6779;The premise is okay though.
I:10014;6780;It sums up the entire idea and reaches a conclusion without wasting all of your time.
I:10014;6781;It comes with some nice additional features.
I:10014;6782;"Even with a heavyweight director like Robert Wise ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" did well at the box office critically the film became the Titanic with its long ponderous shots of V'Ger and the long lingering affectionate gaze at the Enterprise."
I:10014;6783;"Few TV properties truly make the jump to the big screen well so I was surprised and elated that ""Serenity"" Joss Whedon's (""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"") film extension of his TV show ""Firefly"" actually was very good."
I:10014;6784;That's too bad because Whedon does a nice job of giving a backstory to nonfans and still manages to capture the flavor of the TV show.
I:10014;6785;"featuring a stellar cast, ""Serenity"" is a rarity in that it makes the transition to the big screen effortlessly and Whedon manages to clue in those who didn't follow the series with a breathtaking opening sequence that illustrates things fans were told had occurred during the first season but never saw."
I:10014;6786;Since Whedon wraps things up but also leaves the door open the film manages to work both ways for fans by providing closure to one of the main story points of the first season and opening up possibilities (which no doubt will continue in novels and comic books) for further adventures.
I:10014;6787;"Serenity manages to be that rare thing in science fiction films
I:10014;6788;ass adventure with some thought behind it.
I:10014;6789;"While some of the plot points that are revealed in ""Serenity"" are a bit predictable the film manages to combine the best elements of space opera and science fiction to create valentine for fans of the show."
I:10014;6790;The colors are vivid and bright where appropriate and the clarity of the image exceedingly good.
I:10014;6791;The 5.1 Dolby Digital presentation of the film nicely captures the active soundtrack from the theatrical exhibit of the film.
I:10014;6792;Dialogue comes across crisp and clear while action sequences don't have the compressed muddy sound that I've seen in some recent releases.
I:10014;6793;What's in a Firefly focuses on the optical effects with Whedon and members of the visual effects team discussing how they conceived some of the best visual sequences.
I:10014;6794;The discussion of his thought process behind the film's plot and how he tied in various points from the series was refreshingly frank and fascinating to listen to.
I:10014;6795;Whedon's impish sense of humor also gets a nice airing in his discussion on making the film.
I:10014;6796;"while the fact that this is truly the end of the ""Firefly"" saga will be a bitter pill for fans to swallow, Whedon delivers a truly stunning valentine with ""Serenity"" channeling the major plot points for a planned second season that never materialized."
I:10014;6797;enjoyed the tv program and the movie as well .
I:10014;6798;there is a reason why the series and movie have a cult status.
I:10014;6799;seen movie that deserves to be enjoyed by many more.
I:10014;6800;Better than most blockbusters by a country mile.
I:10014;6801;lived show is brilliant beyond words.
I:10014;6802;Serenity provides great closure to a great TV series and is a heck of a stand alone film.
I:10014;6803;pS Might be a good idea to bring along some grenades.
I:10014;6804;He enjoyed the series very much.
I:10014;6805;I have a strong feeling that this cast and story line would have been as big a hit as Star trek in its time.
I:10014;6806;There are so many people who love Buffy,Angel,Doll house and watch them repeatedly as strange new fun.
I:10014;6807;The color, picture and volume though out was great.
I:10014;6808;I enjoyed it all I will not spoil the delight in watching this movie for anyone else but its worth owning and sharing with friends on movie night!!
I:10014;6809;"I understand that everyone is going to have their own ideas about this movie and the ""Firefly"" series."
I:10014;6810;One day my family came into the very end of Serenity on HBO.
I:10014;6811;fi and action fans loved it immediately.
I:10014;6812;I got it and we watched it from the beginning and instantly loved the movie.
I:10014;6813;After seeing the end, watching it through, things made so much more sense.
I:10014;6814;This movie stands alone very well without the backstory.
I:10014;6815;Of course, the history helps explain certain things and helps you to understand the characters, but this movie certainly holds it's own.
I:10014;6816;This series is very smart.
I:10014;6817;"In this type of a situation, it's human nature to adapt to a new way of life, even a new way of speaking whether it be developing a new dialect or reverting to ""cowboy"" ways because you are so cut off from the mainstream that you do what you can to survive."
I:10014;6818;I love it and glad they made it.
I:10014;6819;I really love this movie.
I:10014;6820;western hybrid of the show to the cinematic medium, and brilliantly at that.
I:10014;6821;Serenity is a great movie by virtually any standard, but it's precisely great movies like this one (and Bubba Ho.

I:10014;6825;The conversion to the new format provides Serenity with the nifty effects and grandiosity befitting its status as a modern space opera, but without compromising any of the wit, intimacy, and heart that made Firefly a great show (one might be tempted to note in passing that it was precisely these qualities that George Lucas's mega.

I:10014;6827;themed comedic space opera from Whedon, but in any case Serenity's classic status is guaranteed.
I:10014;6828;I for one found this to be easily one of the most intelligent, original, and entertaining movies of the decade.
I:10014;6829;This movie was another part of a present I ordered for a friend, and arrived promptly in brand new condition for him to enjoy.
I:10014;6830;Thanks for the quick delivery of a great gift!
I:10014;6831;I was engrossed by this amazing world that Whedon so flawlessly created.
I:10014;6832;this is an excellent movie and that is an understatement.
I:10014;6833;The characters are flawless, in my opinion.
I:10014;6834;Never have I seen a cast flow so smoothly together.
I:10014;6835;It is a unique and beautiful thing.
I:10014;6836;I spend my days now encouraging people to look at this series/movie.
I:10014;6837;I hadn't seen the series when I first saw this movie, but I still loved it and I was able to understand it.
I:10014;6838;Great characters, mystery and action combine with a wild west attitude and futuristic flair.
I:10014;6839;A truly unique and enjoyable movie.
I:10014;6840;I very much enjoyed the TV series from which this film evolvedand I enjoyed this film.
I:10014;6841;The acting was good and the story was also.
I:10014;6842;but the characters and their interactions drive the real power of Serenity and make it a joy to watch.
I:10014;6843;Certainly you will enjoy it even more if you are already familiar with the relationships from the regrettably short.
I:10014;6844;So, if you are a fan of sci.
I:10014;6845;fi fan, I still highly recommend you give Serenity a shot, you just might find yourself enjoying it.
I:10014;6846;fi nut or a Firefly fan to enjoy this movie.
I:10014;6847;It's great as a stand.
I:10014;6848;Rarely are action movies this good.
I:10014;6849;This movie is exciting, but it also has substance.
I:10014;6850;You truly grow to love the characters and the relationships they have with each other.
I:10014;6851;the story was the easy part and could be redone in any number of action movies, but the relationship that the characters have with each other make this a marvel.
I:10014;6852;The dialogue is fresh and funny.
I:10014;6853;The graphics are clean and beautiful.
I:10014;6854;This movie has been deemed the new Star Wars and for good reasons.
I:10014;6855;The plot is intricate, the special effects are amazing, and the acting is stupendous.
I:10014;6856;Above all, there is an overwhelming feeling of camraderie that is captivating.
I:10014;6857;I highly recommend this film, not just to SciFi buffs, but to anyone who enjoys movies.
I:10014;6858;The series will give you an understanding of the characters and their relationships.
I:10014;6859;It's pretty goodfor a TV show and when I finish watching the series, I will re.
I:10014;6860;A lot of the people I've talked to that have seen it had never heard of Firefly before a week ago, and they all agree that it is a fantastic movie.
I:10014;6861;To me, it had all of the right ingredients that made me a fan of the series in the first place: action, humor, and most importantly, character development (something that movies nowadays seem to lack in abundance).
I:10014;6862;The script is top notch, peppered with Joss Whedon's quirky trademark dialogue, and the acting is A+.
I:10014;6863;Serenity is a treat from start to finish, and has the potential to be the next Star Wars if given a chance.
I:10014;6864;Along about the time things are humming right along (with a few scenes that are worthy of the telly programme, humour and wit and action mixing and gliding along in a disbelief suspending trance) Josh Whedon alienates fans with a startling event (no spoilers here!)
I:10014;6865;which I have come to terms with but I know is a love it/hate it polarizing moment.
I:10014;6866;Curiously, I normally applaud a director and writer willing to take on this kind of challenge, but I guess this once the emotional investment I had was too strong to feel the usual bittersweet satisfaction of a job well done.
I:10014;6867;It's a middling entry into the action sci.
I:10014;6868;quick history review: Joss Whedon, overall creator guy, enjoys cult success fromBuffyandAngel.
I:10014;6869;And it works on that front, if somewhat clumsily.
I:10014;6870;the visuals are pleasing, and avoid many of the modern sci.
I:10014;6871;Rarely if ever are we violently pulled from enjoying the movie by blue.
I:10014;6872;the sound is booming and epic, which is actually sort of a problem.
I:10014;6873;While this effectively Hollywoodizes things, it takes away from the flavor of the property and eliminates one of the more enjoyable aspects of the show.
I:10014;6874;Think of the parts in Wayne's World on the paid set and you'll have a good idea of what I mean.
I:10014;6875;this is a great movie.
I:10014;6876;if you have seen firefly this movie just continues the amazing series.
I:10014;6877;if you havent seen firefly this will still be an awesome action movie.
I:10014;6878;This was a great follow.
I:10014;6879;But then as a cult film/series continues to be an enjoyable experience.
I:10014;6880;This is a great movie if you are a fan of the TV show.
I:10014;6881;The manner in which Mr. Whedon weaves his story is amazing and quite engaging.
I:10014;6882;"I decided to do some research to see if the movie was a hit""."
I:10014;6883;This has everything you wish Lucas had provided in the prequels: great acting, kicking action, moving characters, and a great plot.
I:10014;6884;The feel is gritty but with great heart.
I:10014;6885;Surprises, love and a message about humanity make it complete.
I:10014;6886;fi movie on the big screen that you could love, do yourself a favor and give this movie a try.
I:10014;6887;I highly recommend the series, but also think it really helps to have seen it before viewing this movie.
I:10014;6888;that said, this intense film was more than just a 2.
I:10014;6889;Serenity is full of action, humor, intensity, and character depth.
I:10014;6890;It's also got its share of surprise twists that will shock you and keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:10014;6891;the collector's edition is reasonably priced and contains many behind.
I:10014;6892;scenes goodies as you'd usually expect in a two.
I:10014;6893;highly recommended, and what a pity the Firefly series was too cool to survive Hollywood.
I:10014;6894;The movie was great, and based on how it feels compared to the Firefly series it is great!!
I:10014;6895;But after watching this movie I found myself wanting to watch the series, and I got to say that if they turned the theme into a video game or made or extended the story of the show in some way it would be one of the greatest things I could think of and I would greatly enjoy any of it as long as it's executed well.
I:10014;6896;Like many people I prefer wide screen formats, because all thou it makes the top of the screen smaller and the bottom it tends to give you more content on the left and right sides of the video feed.
I:10014;6897;serenity is character driven sci.
I:10014;6898;fi that is light (in a good way) on special effects, and heavy on story.
I:10014;6899;A great aspect of the movie is that you never know what is going to happen next.
I:10014;6900;There is a degree of bickering between the crew, but it is done is a very believable way.
I:10014;6901;something not often mentioned in these reviews is the fact that the show's cast is well put together.
I:10014;6902;Not only do they work well together, but each has a very unique screen presence that only fortifies the story.
I:10014;6903;my heart is saddened, as a new fan to the Firefly universe, that this is the end.
I:10014;6904;fi fan, checking out Serenity is a must.
I:10014;6905;This is a great movie!
I:10014;6906;The series was great, the movie is great.
I:10014;6907;Came in and played just fine and I have always liked this movie and could watch it over and over.
I:10014;6908;Incredible cast, great effects, rich characters, smart dialogue, and just a rip.
I:10014;6909;Good story line, great for those with imagination and keen science fiction fans and as a fan just love this,thanks
I:10014;6910;"Serenity takes everything wonderful about ""Firefly""."
I:10014;6911;the complexity, humor, excitement, and characters that feel like family members.
I:10014;6912;This is an incredibly intense, downright scary film.
I:10014;6913;"Familiarity with the backstory from the show will make your experience with the movie even deeper and more shocking, but even on its own ""Serenity"" stands as the equal of any adventure movie ever made."
I:10014;6914;One of the best tv series ever, Firefly by Joss Whedon, was so much fun to watch that it was a shame that it all ended too soon .
I:10014;6915;But the big budget feature film provided one last adventure that was truly exciting, and it was great to see all the old characters again.
I:10014;6916;alone thrilling film with excellent pacing and editing.
I:10014;6917;I loved star trek and the brilliant new 2002 battestar galactica, but for pure fun Firefly could not be surpassed.
I:10014;6918;A great movie that holds up to multiple viewings.
I:10014;6919;Shows you the kind of genius Joss Whedon really is!The film is 8 years old and sure didn`t have a huge modern.
I:10014;6920;but it still is one of the best Sci.
I:10014;6921;"ray Disc has won the ""High Def"" format war."
I:10014;6922;Firefly and Serenity a great time even if you are not a Science Fiction fan or a Western fan.
I:10014;6923;The television series and the film, so if you have the television series, this film will make the story come full circle.
I:10014;6924;This movie introduced me to the world and legend involving Mal and a simple ship and crew.
I:10014;6925;Few things are more fun than great sci.
I:10014;6926;It takes you to new places to explore deep, age.
I:10014;6927;Serenity is my top movie for 2005, and I'll tell you why: the characters.
I:10014;6928;Their choices, their emotions, and their relationships are what guide this.
I:10014;6929;Yes, the action is great, though not on par with the Matrix as some commercials state for some reason.
I:10014;6930;Yes, the special effects are spectacular, although obviously not created by ILM.
I:10014;6931;And yes, the story and the big twist revelation at the end keep you guessing.
I:10014;6932;It is a series that should have enjoyed a long well.
I:10014;6933;The chemistry between the characters were superb and the main characters were wonderfully interesting and complex, especially the captain.
I:10014;6934;that just how good the series is.
I:10014;6935;next, the movie was excellent, action.
I:10014;6936;packed, and greatly lives up to the spirit of the TV series.
I:10014;6937;You care about the characters and the action draws you in.
I:10014;6938;You could only imagine how exiciting it would have been to watch him actually develop into such a great athlete.
I:10014;6939;We've always loved the TV series and this movie provides closure to the whole story.
I:10014;6940;A great follow up to an incredible series.
I:10014;6941;If you are a Firefly fan you'll love this .
I:10014;6942;This is surprising considering the plot of Serenity is a gritty outlaw western, set in a science fiction genre.
I:10014;6943;And that those who won't leave them alone are almost always the winners.
I:10014;6944;It was a fresh perspective, that got a major motion picture studio to spend $40 million to bring the tale to the big screen.
I:10014;6945;If you want to see a good movie for once, you had best hurry, because sadly, even with the very good reviews, Serenity won't be around much longer.
I:10014;6946;Good movie to take a date, because there is plenty to keep your girl shedding tears while you watch the action.
I:10014;6947;some of the subplots may not be as developed as you'd hope, but there are several interesting deleted scenes in the special features that you'll just have to see for yourself.
I:10014;6948;an enjoyable movie for Firefly fans and non.
I:10014;6949;Loved the series, had to get the movie.
I:10014;6950;It's great just on it's own but i would also recommend getting the series.
I:10014;6951;"The Region 4 ""Serenity"" 2 disc edition is superior and the best out of all regions with exclusive extras."
I:10014;6952;"Whilst having watched the ""Firefly"" television series will allow you to get into the story quickly, audiences can see this film without having any pre."
I:10014;6953;Exciting, pacey and compelling this was by far one of the best releases of 2005.
I:10014;6954;Just like the series firefly, this is a realistic SciFi adventure without the aliens, monsters and fancy lasers.
I:10014;6955;i love the humor in this, I love the interaction between the characters, they seem just like regular people you would find walking on the street today.
I:10014;6956;the movie answered questions from the Firefly series and kept the same feel, fans will be comfortable with the similarities.
I:10014;6957;new fans will like it as well, it gives enough information at the begining to explain the general story preceding the movie but to really understand the characters new fans really need to go back the check out the series.
I:10014;6958;this has something for everyone.
I:10014;6959;i just wanted to say nice movie, but i have to write 18 words nice movie nice movie
I:10014;6960;If you are a true science fiction fan,I'm sure you will agree.
I:10014;6961;Good special effects does not equal interesting characters or good storytelling.
I:10014;6962;I laughed at almost all of River Tam's parts, because she is given nothing to work with.
I:10014;6963;It was well written and acted.
I:10014;6964;Each character is fleshed out and their purpose with each other is fulfilled in this final movie.
I:10014;6965;Serenity is a good movie.
I:10014;6966;There are plenty of other reviews available so I won't add much to them.
I:10014;6967;This is a generally fast paced film with a variety of plot threads and characters to keep things interesting and good dialogue.
I:10014;6968;Although it's not necessary to have seen the series first it will add enormously to the experience.
I:10014;6969;Bought this for FIL as a gift.
I:10014;6970;He really enjoyed watching the series and movie but wanted to see the behind the scenes footage for the movie.
I:10014;6971;Great deal at a great price.
I:10014;6972;The one bounty hunter with the sword still sends chills up and down my spine with the actors portrayal.
I:10014;6973;the movie briefly recaps the most important aspects of the series' characters, and proceeds to a rather fantastic conclusion.
I:10014;6974;The plot is unique, full of twists, and memorable.
I:10014;6975;The characters are distinct and superbly acted.
I:10014;6976;in my opinion, one of the best performances in sci.
I:10014;6977;If you've seen the series, Serenity brings it to a pretty solid conclusion (there's a bit of room for continuation, but it does have the taste of a finale).
I:10014;6978;If you haven't, this will likely convince you to do so (and you should, the series is also excellent).
I:10014;6979;The universe Whedon created here is truly a feat of the imagination, and it would be a shame to leave it.
I:10014;6980;The numbers for both the series and the previous version of the show were really high and with this new collector's edition coming out there has been some serious talk about a sequel to Serenity.
I:10014;6981;But it's a testament to just how good the series and movie really are.
I:10014;6982;obviously, this is a must for any self.
I:10014;6983;Two reasons why: First off, it's got the movie you love, plus a lot of special features thrown in.
I:10014;6984;loud blooper reel, and some documentaries.
I:10014;6985;There are rumors about it.
I:10014;6986;The TV show is even better than the movie, and a lot of what happens in the movie doesn't mean as much if you haven't seen the show first.)
I:10014;6987;Not a classic film, but a fun movie nonetheless.
I:10014;6988;worth a shot if you are a fan of goofy sci.
I:10014;6989;"the last 45 minutes or so, though, are truly incredible and showcase everything that is good about the entire ""Firefly"" concept."
I:10014;6990;What was very much a middling effort is turned into a great cinematic experience in the span of just under an hour.
I:10014;6991;"off from FOX (instead being cancelled just when it seemed things were getting good), ""Serenity"" provides a very nice coda to such a well."
I:10014;6992;Joss did something great here.
I:10014;6993;Serenity is an excellent sci.
I:10014;6994;fi/action film, with great characters and very entertaining.
I:10014;6995;It's a great film regardless, but I think the characters and their relationships mean much more if you've watched the TV show.
I:10014;6996;ray player, and I will say the blu.
I:10014;6997;ray is an excellent production, and I would recommend (and have recommended) this show to anybody who enjoys an action film that still has a good story and personable characters.
I:10014;6998;Clearly this dialogue was put in for cinema viewers pleasures.
I:10014;6999;And then when they are out of ammo, and have lost men, some of them are hurt, then they back out behind some VERY solid steel doors and take a breath.
I:10014;7000;oKAll in all I would give it 2 stars This is what it truly should be.
I:10014;7001;ai ai ai!Ending on a more positive note: if you close your eyes on these points, are a simple person, or a pre.
I:10014;7002;I loved this movie in every way.
I:10014;7003;Even before I'd seen the shows I found the movie very easy to follow.
I:10014;7004;It was an awesome movie with a lot of action, lots of good laughs, a fast pace, some scary parts, a good amout of violence but not too much and a wonderful plot with chilling undertones which unfold throughout the film.
I:10014;7005;The suspense was good and the characters seemed very real.
I:10014;7006;It's a well balanced story.
I:10014;7007;I really found it refreshing that this movie went back to the roots of action and adventure and focused on a great plot and great acting rather than tons of expensive special effects.
I:10014;7008;I would love to see a sequel one day.
I:10014;7009;I just have to congratulate Mr Whedon for his outstanding work on this movie and to ask whether the people at fox are in the right jobs?
I:10014;7010;It's only a few bucks more and the special features are worth an extra 3 or 4 dollars.
I:10014;7011;"i hope that Joss Whedon comes out with a ""real"" collector's edition very soon that includes added scenes into the movie itself."
I:10014;7012;"the essence of ""Firefly"" is captured in this film."
I:10014;7013;Better character development on many of the characters you've come to love.
