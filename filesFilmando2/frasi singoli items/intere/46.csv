1;The mood in this movie is set from the start.
2;And his good natured trusting mentality really skews our perspective of what crime really is.
3;Lumet at his finest sets the tone for the film using the everyday 70's atmosphere.
4;This is the first time I have seen this movie.
5;Generally from the first moment of watching this masterpiece I was impressed.
6;The story is unassuming in today's action packed films.
7;what made this movie so enjoyable was the humanity of the main robber Sonny(Al Pacino) and how they dealt with the quickly changing circumstances.
8;Filled with chaos and a changing world the movie reflects that.
9;ray I was incredibly impressed.
10;This movie is the true vision of those who created it and now it can be seen in stunning detail.
11;The story and dialogue is very real and may not be a delight for those who like non.
12;For those who love good stories then Dog Day Afternoon should be on your must watch list.
13;Simply put: One of the great American films ever, with one of the great American performances EVER.
14;A classic for many reasons, I couldn't recommend a film more.
15;Dog Day Afternoon still feels fresh to me.
16;Maybe because Lumet packed so much talent and so many unforgettable moments into it.
17;Why should you watch it?It's the best Pacino has ever been.
18;(I thought the Oscar belonged to him and not to Nicholson that year.)
19;Want to see how far into a character a good actor can delve?
20;it's not only the late John Cazale in another of his brilliant 70s performances, but it's Pacino and Cazale together again after the two Godfathers.
21;It's the quintessential New York location movie.
22;monologue in the barber shop is so convincing, you'll think, No way was this guy ever married to Susan!
23;james Broderick's performance as the FBI agent is a masterpiece of iceberg acting (in which 90% of what's going on is beneath the surface, making the 10% you do see that much more powerful).
24;pacino again, this time .
25;well, not to give anything away .
26;"In 1975 there was one film that completely swept the Oscars, winning awards for Picture, Screenplay, Director, Lead Actor and Lead Actress
27;`Dog Day Afternoon' is a brilliant film about desperation and last resorts, a film about the power of misguided passion and how one man can be pushed to his limit when he feels trapped or pressed into a corner.
28;Al Pacino brilliantly captures Sonny's state of mind, delivering what may very well be his finest performance ever.
29;His manipulation of the audience is beautifully controlled.
30;He glides through panic with ease and charisma and then nests firmly into defiance and a false sense of dominance as he believes he has a handle on the situation.
31;the rest of the cast is also brilliant, especially Charles Durning (who should have received the Oscar nomination over Chris Sarandon).
32;As the main detective on the case, Durning is a powerful presence, one of reason.
33;He floats through each scene with such confidence and maturity.
34;Chris Sarandon has a few strong scenes and adds a twist to the film (I know that his character has been spoiled by quite a few reviews here but I won't do it) and he manages to draw on audience sympathy (maybe that's why he was awarded with the Oscar nomination).
35;sidney Lumet directs `Dog Day Afternoon' with ferocious intensity, an intensity that matches Pacino's fearless (yes, I threw that word in there) performance perfectly.
36;`Dog Day Afternoon' never lets go of the audience but holds them at bay for its entirety and that is a magical thing.
37;I love films based on real life events because they help you to see that true life is often more engrossing, disturbing and downright mesmerizing than fiction.
38;`Dog Day Afternoon' is proof of that very statement.
39;it has been ages since i saw this movie.
40;i love al pacino such a great actor.
41;i completely forgot this was a true story.
42;it is serious but it is funny or i just have a wierd sence of humor.
43;all the acting in this movie is fantastic.
44;they captured it in detail.
45;i just think this is one of al pacinos best works.
46;Al Pacino was great as the bisexual who holds up the bank.
47;This is where the fun begins.
48;What turns out afterwords is exciting and a great story that never lets you go.
49;Excellent movie,Al Pichino is great in this and its directed very well by Sidney Lument.
50;This is the quintessential look and feel of 70's American filmmaking.
51;Al Pacino is a master of unspoken expression.
52;Pacino's character brings on a gamut of emotions you will not expect.
53;Al Pacino is at his best .
54;He is a real artist.
55;One of the best movies ever.
56;DDA is one of the best examples of the 70's movies which explored 'taboo subject matter' in a nonexplotive way.
57;A lot of great movies came out of this era.
58;Everyone is great in it, not just Pacino.
59;I originally saw this in a theatre when I was a kid and I'm surprised how well this movie holds up.
60;Brilliant film version of the real.
61;Al Pacino and John Cazale are fantastic as the criminals, Chris Sarandon wonderful as Sonny's suicidal boyfriend, and Penelope Allen (my favourite performance in the film) is just a genius as the smart.
62;seat tension (thanks to Dede Allen's editing) and the added bonus of some great comedy that comes from watching these guys and their lack of expertise in the matter of solid crime.
63;Dog Day Afternoon has aged well.
64;It puts us into its millieu, it puts us in touch with its characters, and like John Ford it does not call attention to its direction.
65;(With the exception of its use of sound effects to do the work of a music track.
66;Viva the lifestyle!Notice how well Lumet keeps the set getting dingy over time.
67;It is nice, as is the lighting which goes from flourescent harshness to cold night.
68;almost 50 years after Stonewall, almost 40 years after its release, """"Dog Day Afternoon"""" brings us deftly back and presents a narrative more compelling than it seemed wehn first released."""
69;Al Pacino delivers a great performance as a transvestite looking to raise money for his lover[Chris Sarandon]'s sex change operation.
70;This film is not violent, but it makes a strong point.
71;The performances are mesmerizing, and the fact that this really happened in modern America adds to the film's punch.
72;Great acting from two actors who starred together again in The Godfather.
73;Possibly one of pacino's best.
74;All parts of this movie are generally interesting on to the public.
75;this movie is a classic and shows alot of where pacino got his personifications of serpico, carlito, and scarface.
76;a must see for any fan of those movies.
77;"change operation, holds up a bank in Brooklyn with a dimwit friend (played by John Cazale)
78;Porcino is great as the half.
79;charles Durning gives a stellar performance as the police detective in charge, as does Cazale, who is perfect as Sonny's accomplice who is in way over his head (he thinks Wyoming is another country).
80;The movie has a perfect NYC feel to it, with the large crowds forming outside the bank and immediately siding with Porcino (""""Attica!"""
81;As we realize he's more a victim himself than a victimizer, he becomes a truly tragic figure, one we can honestly sympathize with.
82;"An excellent movie
83;This movie has a young Al Pacino.
84;It is also based on a true bank robbery story in New York.
85;One of the greatest films ever made.
86;This is a sweaty, gritty, true crime vehicle for the genius that is Al Pacino.
87;like Pacino's character """"Sonny's"""" two """"wives""""."""
88;this film is packed with raw moments of absolute human emotion, theres no need to glamorize any of the characters, nor to demonize them.
89;I'm not an extra's kind of viewer but I did go through some of them and found them a nice add.
90;Inside the bank, Sonny finds a rapport with the hostages and comes up with a grand scheme to escape to Algeria.
91;Great performances all around, and we actually root for Sonny and Sal because we realize that besides being dumb, they're harmless.
92;Masterfully shot on location, and it's a treat to watch Pacino work the crowd outside the bank.
93;Dog Day Afternoon, an extraordinary movie in its own right, is made even more extraordinary because all of it was true.
94;This is a movie based primarily on character study, more so than the simple plot.
95;Sonny (Al Pacino, in his best performance to date, imo) is the mastermind of the heist, while Sal (John Cazale, equally brilliant) is the brooding follower.
96;"It's a fascinating account of the seduction of celebrity, as evidenced by Sonny, the bank tellers (who want to remain inside the bank and give interviews instead of being saved), and, in a nice touch, the pizza man (who, after delivering the pizza while surrounded by the TV cameras, shouts, ""I'm a f***ing star!!"")"
97;go that the plot, even one as intriguing as this one, can't support this movie on its own.
98;Al Pacino is wonderful wonderful wonderful as Sonny.
99;He is adorable in his dorkiness, and gets the nervous face tics, shuffle in his steps, and the wonderful boyish, insecure voice down pat.
100;faced and enormously likable, even as he is robbing the bank (although I think that Pacino naturally exudes this charm and likeability, even when he's playing less.
101;"I've seen most of Pacino's films, and I consider this to be his best performance to date, even better than his amazing performance as Michael Corleone in the ""Godfather"" movies (and that's saying something, because I adore Michael Corleone)."
102;caliber performance, and he should have won it that year.
103;John Cazale is just as good as the brooding, reserved Sal, who is the perfect counterbalance to Pacino's screaming, wide.
104;"nominated) is also very good as Leon, Sonny's lover and male ""wife""."
105;A very strong supporting cast makes the film even more enjoyable.
106;i said Pierson's Oscar for his screenplay was well.
107;deserved because of the witty dialogue and extremely well thought.
108;out, bitingly funny, and compassionate scenes.
109;"Take, for example, the very memorable scene where Sonny tell police captain Moretti, ""Kiss me."
110;at the police, and wins the crowd's support.
111;The scene is pure adrenaline, and one of the most thrilling and exciting scenes I've ever witnessed on screen.
112;The best scenes in the movie are Sonny's two telephone conversations, one with his male wife Leon and the other with his female wife Angie.
113;"Director Sidney Lumet claims that Pacino and Sarandon improvised most of their telephone conversation, which is a testament to the skills of both actors, as that telephone conversation is simultaneously funny (""Algeria?"
114;"There's crazy people who wear things on their heads"") and very poignant (""You're warped, you know that?"""
115;Sonny's conversation with his wife Angie is just as good, with Pacino getting a chance to let out his trademark volcanic.
116;These wonderful scenes work v. well together, capturing all the madness, poignancy, and compassion of the events.
117;"made movie
118;study and wisely sticks to just that, his characters.
119;One of my favorite movies, and a definite must.
120;Great movie, great second disc, great everything.
121;This is probably one of the funniest """"based on a true story"""" movies I've ever seen."""
122;Pacino was great in this.
123;You will sit back and laugh at the whole scenario.
124;But, like I say, it is a great movie.
125;He will roba bank so he can get the $$$ for his lovers operation.
126;They are a crossthe street at that very moment.
127;This movie is FANTASTICand shows why the 70's had some of our greatest films.
128;I love Dog DayAfternoon and was lucky to see this on the big screenat a run down theatre in San Jose Ca.
129;Michael Sarazen plays Al's lover and is hystericalhe won the Best Supporting Oscar that year.
130;Also recommend for great Pachinie GODFATHER and GODFATHER IISCARFACE=DEVIL'S ADVOCATE(hey!
131;He's one of the most complex and dynamic criminals I've seen in a film.
132;Sidney Lumet is at the top of his form.

134;time viewers still enjoy this movie as much as theater.
135;life event which makes it all the more interesting.
136;"all the other characters were definitely interesting, especially Pacino's partner ""Sal"" (John Cazale)."
137;The story certainly is a memorable one and a big hit when it came out.
138;Well, this is one of those films that I just loved from the moment I first saw it.
139;It was Al Pacino so I was interested.
140;First, I always love films from the 70's as that was the best overall decade for movies, toys and music.
141;The old cars are easier to imagine them being the hottest things out since they are very clear like real life.
142;It would have been nice to include some actual footage from the real event so that people like me can see just how wild a scene this was in real life.
143;If you have never seen it, see it.
144;Nevermind the Godfather or Scarface, Pacino is a master of the art of acting in THIS film!
145;Dog Day Afternoon is based on an actual event that took place in Brooklyn, New York in August 1973 and has become one of Al Pacino's signature roles.
146;It also features lean, efficient filmmaking from Sidney Lumet who establishes life in the city through an expertly edited montage that shows people at work and at play with blue collar types, office workers and people of all races .
147;lumet walks a fine line between gritty crime film and absurdist comedy.
148;Pacino's intense performance constantly teeters on the edge of hysteria but it is always rooted in heartfelt realism that makes him a sympathetic character.
149;It's great to hear him talk about a movie he is clearly proud of.
150;He does a great job of taking us through this landmark movie in this informative commentary.
151;"the second disc features ""The Making of Dog Day Afternoon"" that consists of four featurettes that can be viewed separately or altogether."
152;Most of the main cast and crew contribute new interviews, including Pacino, Lumet, Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon in this excellent retrospective look at this important film.
153;Lumet: Filmmaker is a vintage featurette on the director done during the making of Dog Day Afternoon.
154;We see him in action, directing the cast on location.
155;This is a nice snapshot of the man back in the day.
156;i watched this movie with a friend my age who was very sheltered growing up and he was blown away by the realistic pace of the movie.
157;the cool New York street scenes and the incredilbly superb acting of Pacino and Sarandon.
158;this transfer is clean and fun to watch especially if you like true crime stories.
159;After a very successful collaboration on SERPICO, Sidney Lumet and Al Pacino did everyone a favor and teamed up again to make DOG DAY AFTERNOON.
160;Together, both films comprise some of the best work of the early 1970s.
161;DOG DAY AFTERNOON begins with the stark realism that I have come to expect from Lumet.
162;Sonny (Pacino) is one of the most interesting characters in all of cinema and there is a reason that, of all Pacino's performances, this is one of his most memorable.
163;dOG DAY AFTERNOON also provides a nice critique of the media, as the media becomes entranced with the bank robbery.
164;"The scenes in which Pacino ""works"" the crowd, despite holding several hostages, is magnificent, inspiring the film's most famous line: ""Attica!"
165;For many in the city of New York, Sonny is their hero.
166;It is fascinating to watch the hostages at the bank become excited and wrapped up in the idea of being on television.
167;Something very interesting happened in the 1970s with cinema, and I'm sure if we've been able to get it back.
168;Based on a true story of a botched Brooklyn bank robbery heist, Dog Day Afternoon is a suspenseful, attention.
169;His partner Sal also points an automatic gun at the bank manager (Sully Boyar), and the tone of the movie is set.
170;The VHS version contains added bonus footage of cast and film staff interviews, so you're in for a real treat here!
171;Any movie with Al Pacino is sure to be a winner.
172;I've always liked this one because it showed his future genius.
173;Probably the strongest attraction to ordering was the presence of Al Pacino, who played a powerful character, albeit not the brightest bulb in the room (same for John Cazale).
174;"It was a rough year for the Academy since there were two great films that year: ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and this winner, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" featuring a classic iconic performance by Al Pacino."
175;"Now, I've fortunately seen Pacino on stage back in the '90's in David Mamet's ""American Buffalo"" and he performed with so much intensity that I was over."
176;Perhaps it is just the dearth of good material that causes great actors like Pacino to periodically return to the stage, his first love.
177;"The air conditioning may be off, but Al Pacino is definitely ""on"" in his absolutely brilliant portrayal of John Wojtowicz (""Sonny Wortzik"" in the film), whose botched attempt to rob a Brooklyn bank turned into a dangerous hostage crisis and a twisted media circus (the desperate Wojtowicz was trying to finance his lover's sex."
178;Keep an eye out for Chris Sarandon's memorable cameo.
179;smart screenplay was based on articles by P. f. Kluge and Thomas Moore.
180;disc edition is outstanding, with a great transfer and film.
181;There is one actor here who is light years ahead of anyone else in the movie.
182;For almsot two hours, he gives cinema one of the greatest performance it has ever seen.
183;the magic that Pacino brings to the screen is irresistable, exciting, and finally, breathtaking.
184;This classic keeps you riveted for the entire movie like few other movie do.
185;Dog Day Afternoon is an All.
186;But I have to say .
187;"the way he portrays himself as this ""man."
188;Al Pacino gives his greatest performance of his illustrious career.
189;Charles Durning, John Casale and Chris Sarandon lead the way for an amazing supporting cast.
190;A brilliant chess match between the perpetrators and the police/FBI with hostages in the balance.
191;Al Pacino is at his best in this amazing film.
192;I love these older movies because they really developed the characters so you care about them and what happens.
193;this is such a great story of a bank robbery gone wrong.
194;If you have, see it again.
195;Dog Day Afternoon is a real classic that asks some difficult questions about the roles celebrity, money and responsibility play in our everyday lives.
196;His life is a struggle against a society that wants to bring him down, and here he is up against a police force that is determined to do the same.
197;This allows for a certain charm in the film that would not have appeared possible at the outset.
198;'Dog Day Afternoon' ends up being a strange but fantastic mix of gun.
199;slinging tension and oddball charm, that has it's rightful place in film history and creates an interesting new twist in the crime genre.
200;Dog Day Afternoon is my favourite film.
201;al Pacino is brilliant .
202;and he makes Sonny seem really believable.
203;Then there's Chris Sarandon who is fantastic as Leon.
204;The rest of the cast are superb as well.
205;the fact that Dog Day Afternoon is based on a true story also helps, because it adds another dimension to the film.
206;the final thing that is great about Dog Day Afternoon is that it's very emotional, especially at the end but it's also funny in some places.
207;"Just looking at Sal makes me laugh (and cry when I think about what happens to him later) and there are some funny lines as well ""Sal, Wyoming's not a country."
208;It's also Pacino doing the finest work of his career.
209;"He is incredible in a difficult role
210;The scene towards the end when he dictates his will to the bank teller who writes it up is one of the most moving scenes in all of cinema.
211;The film's atmosphere is perfectly captured.you can FEEL the stifiling, sweltering heat inside the bank as if you are sitting in there with the hostages.
212;Pacino has never been this good, even in the Godfather series.
213;This movie is an excellent one.
214;Al Pacino's acting is outstanding, and the story is very well written.
215;Also, the phones are silly, but fun .
216;Background details (pictures on walls, Christmas club bank advertisements, etc.) now stand out, making the movie set feel much more realistic.
217;that's the mark of a great actor.

222;It was one of the best movies I've seen in years.
223;I understand that it received six Academy Award nominations including one for Best Picture.
224;Well, It's that kind of movie.
225;Naturally, a crowd of thousands gathered and cheered the proceedings.
226;the acting in this movie was sensationally good.
227;I felt as if I was actually there and a functioning part of the story.
228;Al Pacino came across as a likable robber and his partner, John Cazale, was about as creepy as you could get.
229;The film moved along at an appropriate pace without a trace of boredom emerging.
230;This was just a well done film!Gary Peterson

233;nominated direction is sharp throughout.
234;"Based on actual events, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is another great winner from the 1970s, Hollywood's second Golden Age."
235;The pace of the film, the dialogue and over the top performance by Al Pacino make this film so appealing and captivating.
236;It was great to see John Cazale once again acting opposite Pacino.
237;I also liked James Broderick's performance working on the other side of the law negotiating with Pacino.
238;All the performances integrated made this film what it is.
239;Dog Day Afternoon is the true story of Sonny and Sal, two first.
240;These men, both veterans of the Vietnam War and open homosexuals (though not extrafilially involved), must face a war zone of life.
241;Fantastic, yes, but excellent acting by Al Pacino, Charles Durning, and James Broderick makes this narrative startlingly real.
242;"Accessible to the average viewer, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" will find particular interest to ex."
243;This movie is as good as I remembered.
244;It is Al Pacino at his best from a time when actors carried movies with their acting abilities, rather than special effects.
245;In mood, acting, location and plot, this story delivers.
246;So does his right hand man, John Cazale, who plays Sal.
247;They really work great off each other.
248;"He is as good as Pacino in this movie, and as important
249;The story itself is fun in a tragicomic kind of way and should hold your interest pretty well the full 2 hours.
250;Cinematography is great and I'd have to say this is the best Sydney Lumet film I've seen with the exception of """"Network"""" maybe."""
251;"disc edition has lots of special features which make for interesting watching, with Pacino and Lumet talking about their work and the film in ""A 4."
252;Dog Day Afternoon has subtitles in English (yes!)
253;An excellent and surprising period piece (1975) which gives a portrayal of an incident that happened 3 years prior (1972).
254;Would appeal to fans of 'true crime' stories, 70s classics, Sydney Lumet and Al Pacino.
255;I saw this after catching Scarecrow with Pacino and Gene Hackman, also a winner.
256;Movie in tact and great to watch.
257;Al Pacino does a great job in this movie with his co. stars.
258;I remember this movie when it was in the box office and I saw it as soon as it was first out .
259;Al Pacino has a way of making this movie more exciting and more captivating than just plain bank robbery .
260;I also loved to see New York the way it was back when I was growing up.
261;Not very impressive , but that was how New York was then.
262;I really enjoyed the movie then and am so happy to own it now !
263;I've always liked this movie and at Amazon.

279;sonny and Sal (that's Pacino and John Cazale) and some other guy enter a bank in Brooklyn with the intention of robbing it.
280;based on a true story, the dialogue is mostly improvised, giving it a raw, realistic feel.
281;Despite this, the script still won an Academy Award.
282;Why he never won the Oscar for Best Actor that year is beyond me.
283;It was also competing with Jaws for Best Picture that year.
284;one my favorite actors (Lance Henriksen, the man with the coolest voice in the world) has a small role as one of the FBI Agents.
285;On the one hand it's a hard.
286;Not a film for action junkies, I assume this is more for film buffs of students more than anyone else, but it's certainly an important film and it marks one of the many turning points in Pacino's never.
287;The Dolby Digital+ sound design is about as good as it's going to be more a Mono.
288;He is up there with Scorsese as one of the finest American directors.
289;This film is as good as Lumet's other masterpiece Twelve Angry Men.
290;I want to talk about Al Pacino whose performance I regard as being the best in cinema's golden history.
291;pacino's performance as Sonny is breathless.
292;The film's short time period helps create this feeling of tension and intensity inside Pacino.
293;He is a complicated character who I still can't fully understand after numerous viewings.
294;Why does he treat Leon so badly and yet the whole bank heist is in Leon's best interest.
295;He is an enormously affecting character.
296;Though Sonny and Sal are the bank robbers, we grow fond of them because of their deeply moving performances.
297;We share in Sonny's anxiety in his relationship with the FBI.
298;"the best scenes to watch Pacino at work are: his frustration when the tellers have to go to the bathroom

300;And Pacino really finds the spot to make him into a compassionate character.

303;While Cuckoo's Nest was a better movie, this one is still amazing.
304;Creative and fun dialogue (despite the strong language) and although it's a true story, it had some surprising twists.
305;Dog Day Afternoon ranks as one of Al Pacino's best films.
306;Loosely based on a true story (and as the motive for theft unravels we find that truth really is stranger than fiction)this film provides comic relief interspersed with pathos.
307;Pacino excels in this physically daunting roll of Sonny .

310;Based on the true story of a quick bank job gone horribly wrong, Dog Day Afternoon is a tale of old.

312;Dog Day Afternoon brings to the screen a bank robbery that supposedly happened in Brooklyn on a sweltering August day in 1972.
313;It should be a piece of cake, in.
314;Things come to a climactic resolution in the movie's final scenes, and the ending is kind of what we expected, but the movie is great fun to watch through its various twists and turns to reach the inevitable.
315;"The major actors are uniformly terrific
316;The cinematography is excellent and gives the film its convincing atmosphere"
317;This movie is one of the truly great ones from the 1970's and it gets better with age.
318;It's a quintessential New York story.
319;This is a great film and in the beginning, I was wondering why it's categorized as a drama rather than a comedy.
320;It doesn't feel at all dated and in addition to The Godfather series, this will definitely make you a fan of Al Pacino.
321;Dog Day afternoon is one of those films that define 70's films.
322;That was a great decade for Pacino.
323;It has that same grainy real.
324;world look to it as a film like the French Connection or even On The Waterfront.
325;A lot of close up shots of their faces and eyes.
326;Charles Durning was excellent in here as the police lieutenant involved in most of the negotiations with Pacino and his parter, Sal, played by the late great John Cazale who played Freddie in the Godfather films.
327;A great example of 70's filmmaking and of what made Pacino the star he is today.
328;This is one of my very favorite movies of all time.
329;Since it's everything a true story, I had to look up and read the book written by the real Sonny .
330;ehte movie is deadon and Pacino is wonderful playing the frustrated would be bank robber where everything that cold go wrong z\does.
331;Filmed on a relatively small budget when director Sydney Lumet was at the top of his game, this is one of the best films of the mid.1970's, well deserving of its 6 Oscar nominations and other awards.
332;When compared to the photos and TV coverage of the actual robbery in progress, Pacino was the perfect fit for the role, and not just in appearance.
333;ray transfer is very good and clean.
334;Contrast is very good as well as black levels.
335;One of Lumet's most perfect slice of reality tales from a true story, and not only does it look like it's from a true story, it looks like they took every single event that happens in the movie straight from reality.
336;Also extremely easy to watch, tense, funny, crazy.
337;Pacino's ruffled, passionate evocation of working.
338;stands alongside his best work of the 1970s.
339;Gritty, suspenseful, and superbly crafted.
340;This was one of the best films that came out of the 70's.
341;Its up there with The French Connection and Taxi Driver and One Flew.
342;"This is one of the best ""based on true events"" movies that you will ever see."
343;Together with Sal (John Cazale) he held up a small bank in New York at closing time.
344;The negotiations took place on the street outside the bank in full view of a growing audience and, despite the attempts of the negotiators, the whole thing turned into a piece of street theatre.
345;al Pacino does a brilliant job in the role of Sonny.
346;Penelope Allen, in the role of Sylvia the chief cashier, is a fine support to Pacino.
347;Like him, her character is always on the brittle edge but holding her staff together.
348;that does not detract from the movie though which is all about Pacino's barnstorming performance and an Oscar winning script that just buzzes along.
349;This is a great movie, it is full of tension and drama but also lightened with some very funny moments and we get to see a great actor giving his all.
350;one of the strongest attractions of this movie is Al Pacino who is as his raw, edgy best.
351;Al Pacino is 1 of my favorite actors and this film's a classic.
352;This is one of my all time favorite Al Pacino movies.
353;Great movie, albeit long about a Bank Robbery that goes wrong, I did not like some aspects of the movie or some of the plot.
354;but Pacino himself along with his fellow co. star John Cazale(Frido from Godfather,now Deceased) do a excellent portrayal.
355;one of pacino's Early work and one of the best.
356;I love Al, best actor ever!!!
357;You can really feel what happen that day with all the actors lines.
358;I have seen this move maybe 50 times and I felt I had to own it.
359;Dog Day Afternoon is a great film that wowed me the first time I saw it and continues to be a great film that I enjoy even after my 4th time watching it.
360;"We all know what a fine actor Al Pacino is
361;Nothing against Tony Montana, but Pacino's Sonny is such a great character that could've been played so many ways and Pacino does it just right.
362;The movie also happens to feature one of the most famous one.
363;DDA is, in my opinion, his masterpiece.

370;"Do yourself a favor, as a lover of cinema, and see ""Dog Day Afternoon."""
371;This has got to be one of the greatest films ever.
372;The story, the plot, the acting is just amazing.
373;Al Pacino is an original in this film.
374;Great movie to watch on a hot weekend, summer afternoon.
375;He shows amazing kindness to his hostages while he tries to devise a plan for his escape.
376;The mood of the movie seems to constantly shift from humor to pathos to tension and some of the plot shifts are entirely too strange to come from a fiction writer's pen.
377;The acting is excellent and riveting in this movie, based on a true incident.
378;I read a book on cross dressing recently, and this film got a mention.
379;So I bought it, and love it.
380;It's rather unusual to have a bank robber played by Al Pacino (absolutely fabulous!)
381;turn out to be gay, leaving his wife and moving in with a transsexual.
382;The way Pacino plays this mad bank robber is touching.
383;The film as such a joy, because it's a perfect document of a long gone era.
384;"Dog Day Afternoon is an excellent movie
385;ray version is crystalline, and looks fine on a 39.
386;if one enjoys some of the absurdities of the human condition, one will enjoy this film.
387;Excellent writing, excellent acting, excellent direction, editing, sound.
388;have so much respect for this film and the way all concerned are treated with such respect and dignity am going to order thetwo disk special edition.
389;this is probably as good as any motion picture ever made.
390;dramas, DOG DAY AFTERNOON (1975) is the last of the great performances of Al Pacino's early career.
391;blooded, and in fact, the hostages appear to be having a fairly good time, and become friendly with their captors, waving enthusiastically at the cameras and refusing to leave the bank when chances occur.
392;(Attica prison in Upstate New York was the site of a 1972 prison riot which was put down with a brutal loss of life) is considered one of the greatest moments in movie history.
393;Leading a cheering crowd one moment, he is frozen into immobility the next.
394;review: Al (Sonny) pacino is in fine form in this movie as is the rest of the cast.
395;This fine paced film is a tripto 70s attitudes before political correctness you won't soon forget.
396;This is a classic movie where everyone knows how it's going to end.
397;(It's a true story, keeping fairly close to the facts.)
398;good solid cast, John Cazale as 'Sal' the demented killer and Charles Durning (I just realized oddly enough he was also in Hindenburg) and the brilliant Al Pacino as his rocket began to soar.
399;If you watch Pacino you see every move of everyman.
400;Probably the last city of diverse races practicing cross.
401;cultural communication on a (often) friendly, day by day style.
402;Thank God that got here.
403;Except they had the Brothers Gibb do the musical score and Dog Day had Diva Elton.
404;good flick if only to see Pacino move.
405;A great performance by Pacino and several supporting actors tell this true story in an interesting fashion.
406;sonny is apprehended, sentenced to 20 years, and served six.
407;Despite the fact that many of the incidents in the movie,like live coverage of a crime event, are no longer a novelty and in some senses you know what to expect in the end, this movie had me riveted throughout.
408;mr. Sidney Lumet makes you feel the sweat of that afternoon.
409;As Sonny says It is on nobody Mr. Al Pacino was just fantastic.
410;He holds stage for the entire duration of the movie and you want more not less.
411;Al Pacino's glorious little film about a couple of would be bank robbers who simply have a really bad day.
412;Brought to you by the same team that would also bring us Serpico, Pacino is simply electrifying in this film about a bank robbery in New York City that simply turned into a media circus on live television.
413;With a rivetting performance Pacino simply oozes panic and sheer hysteria.
414;Pacino is simply terrific in this film as an on the edge psychopath who simply wants to pull the job off.
415;But if you are a Pacino fan or love high tension drama's you may enjoy this.
416;There's never a dull moment and it's beautifully scripted.
417;If you are an Al Pacino fan, this is a brilliant must have.
418;The intensity of the film is incredible.
419;this is a prime example of a great film,sadly underrated and overshadowed by 'Cuckcuckoo's Nest' that year of the anti.
420;al Pacino,Chris Saradin,and the late genius Sydney Lumet discuss the various ideas and observations about the film.
421;lumet would later win his laurels with the film 'Network',yet 'Dog Day Afternoon' is his true magnum opus.
422;what makes this a great film?
423;Great actors,great supporting actors,great script,great director,great writing,great ad libs,and a bizzare great story.
424;everything about this film clicked,at the right time.
425;it's wonderful magic to see the chemistry between Al Pacino and John Cazale.
426;in the 'Godfather' films,Al's role of Michael Corleone,he is rationale and sharp.
427;i still love this film.
428;al Pacino was perfect for this film.
429;it's a raw classic that still keeps the audience hostage.
430;I'm a fan of Al Pacino, so anything he puts out, I go and see.
431;This movie was a movie with a serious message and Pacino delivered it well with his superb acting.
432;I must admit, I didn't view this part but I have viewed the movie several times and I am a HUGE Al Pacino fan!I bought it for it's price and fast service.
433;A great movie, a classic movie.
434;The body of the movie involves the usual bargining for hostages techniques that we would expect, but we also are given some twist to this plot as well.
435;Al Pacino is at his best in this movie, and we can see why he is a true film legend.
436;John Cazele also gives a top notch performence as his sidekick.
437;i seen this when i was a child and i loved it as much now as then you will learn more about this movie than you may think
438;After the Godfather, Godfather part II Pacino made Dog Day Afternoon.
439;They try to rob a bank at closing time but the cops are right across the street.
440;A 5 minute event turns into a all day fun fest.
441;Dog Day Afternoon is a perfect example of why the 70's were a shining decade for filmmaking.
442;not only one of Al Pacino's best performances, but Sidney Lumet's best film as well.
443;From start to finish, it is a humorous, energetic, piece of pure entertainment (even though it is depicting a real incident).
444;Every scene is engrossing, every performance a vital component to the overall endproduct.
445;Regardless, the film itself is worth owning.
446;This is a great movie to have in your rainy day collection, Al Picino in NYC 1970.
447;Nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, """"Dog Day Afternoon"""" is a funny, gripping, touching human story that helped personified the golden age of 1970s filmmaking as we know it."""
448;"This movie examines the lengths people will go to to make a stand for what they believe in, the drastic things some individuals do for themselves and others, as well as the nuttiness of the ""15 minutes of fame"" phenomenon so prevalent in our mixed up culture."
449;First rate performances, a great script, wonderful use of the NY inner city landscape, and incredible direction by Sidney Lumet make this a 70s gem.
450;A good story, great acting and a few totally unexpected twists.
451;Al Pacino is just outstanding in Dog Day Afternoon.
452;There are great actors cast, along with an excellent screenplay.
453;I enjoyed this movie very much and would recommend it to anyone.
454;If you are an Al Pacino fan like myself, you must see this movie.
455;(Just mentioning this to underline the greatness of this movie too)
456;This story does a terrific job of keeping the audience's attention.
457;This is pretty much a depiction of Murphy's Law going into full effect for these two guys trying to rob a bank.
458;Part of the reason why the film is intriguing is because the story makes you care about how these two guys are going to get out of this situation.
459;It makes you care about everyone involved with very well developed characters.
460;the acting is grade A+ all the way through this film.
461;Sonny is one of Pacino's Oscar nominated performances.
462;Pacino has a way of keeping you fixed on him but the supporting cast more than complements him with terrific performances.
463;The film earned six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and won for best original screenplay.
464;The film , excellently , captures the feel of summertime in the city.
465;The opening of the film , effectively , establishes the tone and the feel of the setting.
466;The screenplay Oscar was well earned.
467;One of my favorite films.
468;You get actor's bios , the awards that the film won , subtitles in english , spanish , and french and the Reel Recommendation's and thats about it.
469;this is movie is a good heist movie.
470;Good film, kind of slow sometimes, but it keeps a reality to it.
471;This is a great movie!
472;I'll leave you to see why he's robbing this bank, but this movie is based on a true story that ACTUALLY HAPPENED.
473;It is funny, drama(ish) and bitingly real.
474;moving side, being over 2 hours in length.
475;Al Pacino does a great job acting.
476;Basicly the whole movie is the hostage takers negotiating with the police and planning their escape.
477;this is one of Pacino's finest acting performances.
478;"He consistnetly makes you feel both the stress and fear that ""sonny"" feels during the entire ""waiting"" period."
479;"The way he displays ""sonny's"" emotions is really uamazing."
480;He is always on the edge of breaking, but always manages to keep his cool.
481;Pacino is so good at both facial expressions and mannerisms that he does not even need to speak for the audience to know what it is he is feeling.
482;one more thing I love about this film, is the setting.
483;at times the movie is tense action thriller, at times comedy and at times pure farce.
484;The crowd goes wild, roaring their support for someone who has somehow become something of a local celebrity.
485;Brave people, considering this was New York City in 1972, just 3 years after Stonewall.
486;the movie earned six Oscar nominations in 1975 including Best Picture, Best Screenplay and one apiece for Al Pacino (his fourth) and Chris Sarandon.
487;"ray for the price and though I hadn't watched the movie in years, it's good to see it all ""cleaned up""."
488;And it has one of the best actor ad libs when he in.
489;"sighted the crowd into the ""ATTICA"" chant as he discussed in a recent 60 Minutes interview."
490;In writing a review of Dog Day Afternoon I had to do the dubious thing and ignor both the great cast and stellar director MR. Sidney Lamet, instead I had to face the true facts here, that this was Al Pacino's stage and has been since day 1.
491;His perfomance in this film is so strong and breath.
492;Much like Richard Burton in Who's afraid of Virginia Wolf, this stands as one of the more heart breaking moments in the history of that award.
493;on the strict surface this film shows an amazing spectacle taking place before your very eyes.
494;It is when you see this human pain, this human loss, the human tragidy, that you see just how poignant, and real, and meaningful, each and every moment of Dog Day afternoon truly is.
495;It is only when you realize the impact these moments have, that you then know that you have just watched 20 minutes of perhapes the greatest acting in the history of motion pictures, and Al Pacino's greatest moments in his illustious career.
496;This is simply the BEST acting performance of Al Pacino's career.
497;He is absolutely flawless here and how this did not earn him a Best Actor Academy Award is truly baffling to me.
498;This is a master class in acting.
499;He easily makes you feel the raw emotion and desperation of this character.
500;john Cazale, Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon are all phenomenal as well.
501;You can see and feel all of emotions that exists between those two characters in one 5 minute phone call.
502;all and all, this is one of the best films of all time.
503;The whole cast is extraordinary in their performances.
504;movie also makes a bold statement about the confused, war.
505;"Sound familiar?Pacino is magnificent
506;The Director keeps him in close up and he wrings out all an audience can ask for.
507;Al Pacino burns up the screen in Dog Day Afternoon which is based on a true story and confirms that fact that truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.
508;time bank employee, so he knows all the tricks of the trade to thwart bank robbers.
509;His scenes on the street outside the bank are scintillating including his famous Attica chant.
510;Sidney Lumet does a fine job translating the heat and humidity of the day and you can feel yourself sweating along with the characters.
511;Dog day afternoon is a wonderful masterpiece from director Sidney Lumet(The Verdict, Serpico, 12 angry men).
512;What happens next is terrific, electrifying, and hilarious as Sonny turns the whole situation into a near circus side show.
513;Charles Durning turns in an incredible performance and Al Pacino delivers an Oscar nominated, pitch perfect performance as the hysterically funny lead bank robber.
514;A side note also is that this is certainly John Cazale's(The Godfather, Deer Hunter) finest performance before his untimely death just 2 years later.
515;There is never a dull moment throughout Dog day afternoon, and several actors here give some of the best performances of their careers.
516;He is sensitive, screwed up, and angry.
517;The acting is so good"
518;The gay lover is sprung from a mental hospital.
519;Sidney Lument has created a flawed masterpiece of suspense with the Oscar winning script by Frank Pierson.
520;This fine film is an order of magnitude better on Blu.
521;Really a brilliant performance by Pacino.
522;Pacino's intensity, which morphed into overacting in some of his later films, jumps off the screen and is mesmerizing.
523;And so he outdoes himself once again in his best performance, which is the chronicle of a what.
524;dog Day Afternoon is one of my all time favorite films.
525;it is very simple, has very little violence in it and yet the performances are VERY real.
526;Al Pacino gives his best performance here, and everyone definitely makes this film feel real for sure.
527;overall, this is one of my favorite films and is truly a great classic.
528;On the back of the case, this movie is branded as a boisterous comedy that is Bitingly Funny .
529;And while the movie certainly has its funny parts, it never has one.
530;It is more of a comedy as a whole, and just about how the whole bank robbery got screwed up.
531;Accually, it is really quite serious in tone.
532;so once you get past the aboslutly false statements that this is a comedy, you start to see the magic of this film.
533;when watching this movie, you will feel like you are right there, inside this movie.
534;You will progress right along with the main character, Sonny.
535;Al Pacino does a brilliant job showing the many changes that Sonny goes through.
536;not only does Al Pacino do a brilliant job, but the other characters are amazingly protrayed as well.
537;Every character is so believable and real that you will truly feel like you have met them all first hand.
538;one thing that I have noticed about Dog Day Afternoon is its influences on more modern movies.
539;In Mad City, John Travoltra's character is also faced with a media circus as he holds a group of school kids and their teacher hostage in a meauseam.
540;The frenzy of media coverage, the public reaction, and the way that the main character becomes friendly with the hostages all give a very big nod to Dog Day Afternoon.
541;overall, this is a fantastic movie that is full of brilliant performances.
542;it is all pretty much dialogue .
543;If you've never seen this flick, it's worth it.
544;It's also cool to see what NYC looked like back in the 70's .
545;favorite lines: Hey Sonny, you looked a little squeezed out.
546;For one, the character development provides the viewer with many clever personality sketches of unique and involving individuals as opposed to typical, standard formula, two.
547;looking crowd is loving every minute of it.
548;The movie seems to be no more than a retelling of that afternoon's events, but it does so in a very compelling way and without taking sides or manipulating the viewer's emotions.
549;The Blu Ray High Definition make you feel that you are in the movies.
550;Everything is excellent about this suspenseful movie of a bank robbery that goes wrong.
551;The casting is perfect, and psychology penetrating.
552;There is humor and there is tragedy.
553;Pacion puts in possibly his best performance and John Cazale amazes as his sidekick.
554;One of the best movies of the 70's.
555;There's so much to like about this movie.
556;director Sidney Lumet and Al Pacion teamed again, a few years after makingSerpico (Widescreen Edition), to bring a true story about a bank robbery to screen.
557;Again Mr. Pacino got unlucky!How on earth he hasn't got the academy award for this brilliant performance!
558;I love all Jack Nickolson work but honestly if you compare his work on One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest against Dog day will agree with me that Al could have got the Academy.
559;pacino acting is far energetic, tough to do(in dog day context), brilliant, classic and what a amazing performance!It requires a lot of dare to do a subject like DOG DAY after becoming an Icon (after Godfather Hit).
560;In short: Lumet (Direcor) has done great job, he knows how to deal with tense situations, Superb acting,Pacino in his splendor, Should have got 2 Oscar for this role.
561;The pacing is extremely good.
562;A man who is in middle of robbery still he is considerate.
563;i have watched and will keep watching this movie to enjoy Al Pacino great acting.
564;I believe this was Al Pacino's first movie and it's a great one.
565;He's believable as Sonny, who in desperation to get his boyfriend a sex.
566;If you've never seen it, treat yourself to an adventure watching one of Al Pacino's best performances.
567;Lumet (nominated for 5 Oscars but never won, 6 Golden Globes, 1 win ) and Pacino (nominated for 8, winner of 1, 15 Golden globe nominations, 4 wins) both prove why they were elite and deserving of much more awards and accolades.
568;"This movie was an instant classic and the best robbery movie, along with Michael Mann's opus ""Heat"" (which also had Pacino)"
569;best performances from the many good and great actors he's had working for him.
570;I've never done the math, but I'd almost bet that he sports more best lead and supporting Oscars than any other director in the history of film.
571;the acting is great, but Pacino is impeccable.
572;"if there was ever a movie that cried, ""Oh for god's sake"" from beginning to end, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" is that movie, and it does so with inimitable style."
573;A genuine classic and must.
574;Took a long time to have one of my favorite movies of the 70's.
575;He is a Al Pacino fan so .
576;it was one of his Christmas gift
577;Dog Day Afternoon (1975)Crime, Drama, 125 minutesDirected by Sidney LumetStarring Al Pacino, John Cazale and Charles DurningAl Pacino is one of the best actors of his generation and has given us many memorable characters, from Michael Corleone in The Godfather trilogy to his Oscar.
578;winning portrayal of Frank Slade in Scent of a Woman.
579;pacino's performance was so full of energy.
580;Heist movies are something I enjoy when they are executed well, and this would top my list.
581;But something about the story held my attention even then.
582;"Sidney Lumet's ""Dog Day Afternoon"" reminds us that films once upon a time made it a point to properly develop the individuals within their stories."
583;"Just when it appears matters cannot get any more odd, Sonny's new ""wife"" (Chris Sarandon) is brought to the scene and the reason for the bank robbery is revealed."
584;Dog Day Afternoon is in a class of its own when one is talking about bank robbery films.
585;There are so many unconventional elements to the story .
586;"One might think that it would be easy to lose sight of the fine performances in ""Dog Day Afternoon"" with all of these elements vying for your attention but the efforts turned in by Pacino, Cazale, Sarandon, Charles Durning, and the rest of the cast is so good that their characters will not promptly fade from memory."
587;Lumet also does an amazing job of creating a specific time and place with his directing.
588;"He infuses ""Dog Day Afternoon"" with such realism that you can literally feel the heat rising from sidewalks."
589;Take out your scorecard and mark down this jewel as one of the essential films of the Seventies.
590;thanks for the bday gift I was told .
591;Though brilliant in The Godfather (I and II), Pacino's best performance of his career was in this film.
592;In the Godfather films, there was a lot of talent all around him.
593;In Dog Day Afternoon, Pacino carried the movie.
594;"it's a great movie
595;The realism of Al Pacino role in Dog Day Afternoon is almost 3.
596;Setting in the summertime makes excitement more tense and thrilling.
597;EVERYBODY under 30 who loves great serious drama and especially crime drama should find and view everything Al Pacino has EVER made!
598;He is one fabulous actor!
599;Great movie, great actor, great price.

612;A prime Pacino spearheaded this film and it stands up to some of his best.
613;it also still stands up today as an important movie that makes a number of statements about life and media influence.
614;dog Day Afternoon walks a wonderfully thin line between comedy and seriousness.
615;it's the pure skill of Al Pacino that keeps you engaged until the very bitter end.
616;overall this is a very good film.
617;The human nature of the film shines through.
618;Also characteristic of 70s cinema, the media is a clustered force to be reckoned with.
619;Dog Day Afternoon is a brave film that tackled tough subjects in a unique way.
620;For those who love Al Pacino this I would have to say is one of his better movies.
621;Pacino's role as a misfit bank robber is outstanding.
622;He plays the part so very well and the acting is dramatic at times while Pacino's ignorance of being a bank robber provides some needed humor to a rather serious situation.
623;How he handles people in the movie, his gestures and actions are Pacino at his best.
624;Any true fan of Al Pacino should have this movie in their collection!
625;I would have to agree with everyone in here that this is one of Pacino's best films.
626;I think that an idea for a bank robbery film is excellent.
627;Also to my surprise this movie was based on a true story and that kind of surprised me a tiny bit because I thought to myself how could anyone have lasted that long in a bank .
628;I thought that was fabulous.
629;Pacino and cazale are amazing.
630;Pacino lets his emotions out in an outstanding performance, method acting.
631;cazale didn't have much lines but he focused on his character presence and it worked perfectly.
632;as bizarre as the characters were, it takes great actors to make them iconic.
633;the movie starts out pretty good, but by the half.
634;Based on a true story and a true gem of a movie.
635;"A Brilliant true story crime drama, gripping and very funny entertainment, a classic that no other film is like, Pacino is a knockout in this felony film that features the unforgettable scene with the unforgettable line when Sonny yells out to the crowd surrounded by cops ""ATTICA, ATTICA"""
636;This is the movie that, in my opinion, put Al Pacino on his way to super stardom.
637;Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors and he gives an inspired performance in an extremely strange true story of a bank robbery.
638;Huge crowds gather outside and cheer every time Sonny comes out to talk with the cops and the media is having a heyday with the story.
639;The direction of Sidney Lumet is amazing.
640;The movie is at times quite hilarious as the story becomes more and more fantastic, but the end takes somewhat of a tragic turn.
641;The interactive menus are nice, but I still go back to the movie.
642;This true story however is so much more down to earth and believable not to mention likeable that the bank personell who beccme hostages feel a sympathy mostly for Sonny.
643;The bottom line is that this movie is well acted and captures the amazment the real event caused in Brooklyn in the early 70's.
644;Al Pachino was nominated for many Oscars on this one and to date ranks as one of his best films!
645;this is one of the films I watch every couple of years because i like it so much.
