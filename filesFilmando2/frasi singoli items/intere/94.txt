I:9772;1;This is a wonderful love letter to the movies from Francois Truffaut who not only directs but also delivers a terrific performance as a movie director.
I:9772;2;The very first scene is magical.
I:9772;3;the camera picks up a couple of the characters and you wonder who the film will be about.
I:9772;4;They play the scene again, but this time we hear the director's instructions and see the cameras moving around.
I:9772;5;the director has to manage all kinds of personal dramas on his set .
I:9772;6;the stage hands, personal aides, the director, the stuntman .
I:9772;7;this is a mesmerizing glimpse of how movies get made by one of the true masters of the genre.
I:9772;8;I consider it highly valuable for those interested in film.
I:9772;9;Near the beginning of this film a character says real estate is the place to make money, not the movie business, but he continues to work in the movies because he loves it.
I:9772;10;"That is what Francois Truffaut's ""Day for Night"" is all about."
I:9772;11;People who love movies making movies.
I:9772;12;"titles I now think it is one of Truffaut's best films only behind ""400 Blows""."
I:9772;13;"as we watch ""Day for Night"" we see what it takes to make a movie."
I:9772;14;"It's one of the many reasons so many people have called this one of the greatest films about films in a class with ""8 1\2"", ""Contempt"" and to a lesser extent one of my favorites ""Stardust Memories""."
I:9772;15;"Day for Night won the Academy Award for ""best foreign film""in 1972 and two years later was nominated for ""best picture""."
I:9772;16;Film critic Gene Siskel even hailed it as the best film of 1974.
I:9772;17;line: One of Francois Truffaut's best films.
I:9772;18;And it may as well be one of the greatest films about the movies.
I:9772;19;It may not be as sublimely rich and ultimately haunting as Federico Fellini's `8 ' but truth be told `La Nuit Americaine' is an astonishing film that is as clever as it is honest in its depiction of the art of filmmaking.
I:9772;20;Here Truffaut shows us what goes into taking what is on the printed page and transferring it onto the silver screen.
I:9772;21;It's a very large feat, and he delivers it rather well.
I:9772;22;some have stated that the film starts off slow, and sadly there are some slow spots throughout, but overall the film is redeemed by a witty script (which allows us to get to know each and every player intimately) as well as some superb performances.
I:9772;23;Cortese is wonderful as Severine, displaying the true anxiousness from realizing you are past your prime yet refusing to acknowledge it.
I:9772;24;She is marvelously entertaining here.Yes, it plays out like a realistic soap.
I:9772;25;this is a very smart and very entertaining film that should be high on the lists of any lover of film, for it is an ode to the wonderful art of making that said film.
I:9772;26;This film should come with the tagline `please try at home' for this is a film that will make you appreciate film to a degree that you'll ache to try your hand at filmmaking.
I:9772;27;Truly Truffaut crafts a stunning portrait of his own career and gives us all something to talk about.
I:9772;28;If you have, congratulations, you've watched one of the masterpieces of cinema history!
I:9772;29;Solid filmmaking, excellent performances all round.
I:9772;30;they are depriving us of one of the best films of all time, by one of the best directors.
I:9772;31;pLEASE release it in the subtitled version, and please readable subtitles with good translation.
I:9772;32;And if at all possible CRITERION please take note!
I:9772;33;Truffaut loved the cinema, perhaps more than any other director, and this is his movie about what it's like making a movie.
I:9772;34;Truffaut also shows us the actors, actresses, and production staff in all their glory (and all their pettiness, too): their genius, hard work, cleverness, generosity, and professionalism (and also their mediocrity, selfishness, narrow.
I:9772;35;"It's a warm, humorous, poignant, and loving look at ""movie madness."""
I:9772;36;A narcissistic view of the movie business.
I:9772;37;The film is about a film being shot, and ends when this is accomplished.
I:9772;38;We see what goes on in the daily lives of those involved in the work, from the director (the same Truffaut) to the producer, to the cast, to the stuntman.
I:9772;39;There are visual references to the great classic directors in film history, to how the film industry has changed.
I:9772;40;That question is quite revealing of what our world has become.
I:9772;41;And of course, they speak French a lot, which is one of the main reasons I watched this film.
I:9772;42;the acting was excellent, and the behind the scenes look at the process of shooting a movie (with Trufaut playing himself as the unflappable director) was interesting, charming, and at time hilarious.
I:9772;43;this is amusing and always engaging, and certainly worth seeing, but neither the fictional film at the center nor the general article amount to very much.
I:9772;44;Also noteworthy for its sprawl and ensemble work, both of which are Altman.
I:9772;45;In his films he shows considerably more technical skill, overall, than his great rival, Jean.
I:9772;46;Truffaut, by comparison, likes shiny, pretty things, and anything that disturbs that safe universe is averse to him.
I:9772;47;exterior of the viewer watching the film, satisfies on any level.
I:9772;48;Critics argue the film shows how much Franois Truffaut loves film.
I:9772;49;But, the two most interesting comparisons to be drawn with this film would be from films released a decade earlier.
I:9772;50;French and dubbed version and a boatload of extras including rare footage of Truffaut interviews.
I:9772;51;Needless to say that the images and the sound are perfect.
I:9772;52;La Nuit Am ricaine is an interesting movie with celebrated French director Francois Truffaut playing a director making a movie.
I:9772;53;He proves to be a modest and convincing actor himself while patiently weaving a tale about how movies are made and how intense the emotional interactions among those making the movie can be.
I:9772;54;Truffaut gives us a glimpse of how the production crew works together (and sometimes at odds) while showing us some of the things that can go wrong while making a movie.
I:9772;55;Truffaut's fine sense of emotional conflict and how conflict might be resolved makes the various stories touching without being maudlin.
I:9772;56;She is a delight as an actress with a heart of gold recovering from a nervous breakdown married to an older man whom she does indeed love.
I:9772;57;Bisset's warm and sisterly befriending of Leaud is, shall we say, entirely French (which gets her into trouble with her husband).
I:9772;58;This really is a skillful showcasing of Bisset since she gets to play something like an ingenue with her husband and the older woman with Leaud.
I:9772;59;valentina Cortese in a fine supporting role does a most convincing job of playing the temperamental Italian actress just past her prime who quaffs champagne while working, who forgets her lines and can't find the right door, but when properly indulged gives a great performance.
I:9772;60;truffaut is the kind of director who allows the audience to penetrate not only his characters to see what makes them tick, but also the stars who play those characters.
I:9772;61;He does a particularly beautiful job with Bisset who is warm and wise and something close to heroic, and with Leaud whose childishness seems natural and whose pettiness forgivable.
I:9772;62;It is carefully crafted and very well thought out and is a fine example of the work of the one of the great directors of the French cinema.
I:9772;63;See it for Truffaut whose delicate genius is evident throughout.
I:9772;64;While this movie is about making movies, it still revisists Truffaut's main theme in most of his films: the relationships between men and women.
I:9772;65;a brilliant movie by a brilliant director (the best, actually).
I:9772;66;"The opening one minute tracking shot of the ""movie within the movie"" emptiomizes Truffaut's own unique style: a bus zooms by as we seemingly focus on the main character?"
I:9772;67;This opening sequence sets the tone for a truly original film about film.
I:9772;68;even though we don't make movies like they used to in 1972, this is still a fascinating look into the movie making world of the time, with all it's facets, responsiblities, and relationships.
I:9772;69;Very humorous at times, it is a true pleasure to sit back and enjoy this Oscar winning film, from a director who is unequaled in the history of films.
I:9772;70;For those of you who haven't seen any films by the late, great French director, Francois Truffaut, Day For Night (French title: La Nuit Americaine) is a great introduction.
I:9772;71;This actually won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, and it is evident why.
I:9772;72;Day For Night is really a valentine to Francois Truffaut's love affair with cinema.
I:9772;73;This is a great and intriguing story (a sort of film within a film approach).
I:9772;74;i love this shot because it almost seems like a pseudo.
I:9772;75;documentary, as well as a loving tribute to the blood, sweat and tears that go into making a film.
I:9772;76;How great that Truffaut got in front of the camera for this piece.
I:9772;77;He really should have done it more often.
I:9772;78;This film is equally funny and touching and I highly reccomend it.
I:9772;79;very bright, funny, warm, cute, inviting, entertaining, informative, and fascinating.
I:9772;80;In the mold of other great films about making films, such as Fellini's 8 1/2 and Godard's Contempt , Francois Truffaut let's us visit the set of a French film crew at work .
I:9772;81;Indeed, just four years later, he'd star in Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind as the French scientist Lacombe.
I:9772;82;It's a sheer joy from start to finish and the humanity shines throughout.
I:9772;83;francois Truffaut makes wonderful movies and this is one of his best!
I:9772;84;An adorable movie by anyone's standards.
I:9772;85;One of Truffaut's best and warmest films as the director himself plays a harried film director making a piece of fluff at the Victorine stuios in Nice.
I:9772;86;Uniformly wonderful performances and one of the best films on the filmmaking process ever made.
I:9772;87;Easily one of the best, and true, movies about a movie .
I:9772;88;And also probably one of Truffault's best (a lot of his moives, for those that haven't seen them, sort of go on a on and never really have a plot).
I:9772;89;It's engaging and funny, and (having worked on a couple film sets) right on about the behind the scenes antics of a movie set.
I:9772;90;Anyway Bisset was lithe and elegant and spoke great french.
I:9772;91;Truffaut's DAY FOR NIGHT is an interesting film experience.
I:9772;92;One of them was this film, (with Japanese AND English subtitles!)
I:9772;93;and I enjoyed the experience.
I:9772;94;tint former experiences, and I seem to remember this as a really great film.
I:9772;95;Well, some 40+ years later, I got to see this for second time, and.
I:9772;96;Several elements of the film are unfortunately dated, but it's an enjoyable enough movie.
I:9772;97;This an affectionate satire on the art and the madness of making movies .

I:9772;100;art Cinema in its highest level .
I:9772;101;Day For Night (also called La Nuit Americaine) is a captivating glimpse into the mechanics of the film.
I:9772;102;It is a film within a film .
I:9772;103;So whilst we might smile nostalgically at the clothes (most of which are unbelievably tight), the aspects of human relationships revealed are as relevant today as they were in 1973.
I:9772;104;"One of the best films ever made about the innate absurdities of moviemaking, ""Night"" is a loving satire about the film."
I:9772;105;world family filled with marvelously nutty performances, tons of movie references, and an overwhelming joie de vivre.
I:9772;106;Truffaut develops his slightly defective characters beautifully, and the entire cast is splendid.
I:9772;107;But a better question would be: Has any director ever loved movies more than Truffaut, who lovingly spoofs even himself?
I:9772;108;"The dizzying, exhilarating ""Night"" is his personal answer."
I:9772;109;why do people who make movies believe that making movies is an interesting enough topic to make movies about .
I:9772;110;Day for Night is the best film about filmmaking there is.
I:9772;111;Plus, Jacqueline Bisset at her most beautiful.
I:9772;112;the film captures the French's love of film .
I:9772;113;"The best line of dialogue is when Truffaut says ""When I begin, I try to make the best picture possible."
I:9772;114;Anyone who has ever worked on a film set will see that some things are eternal .

I:9772;116;This is a beautiful movie about the world of film.
I:9772;117;making, with all of its trials and joys.
I:9772;118;Truffaut shows the foibles and glories of the people who make films, revealing even his own indiscretions.
I:9772;119;The film is, at the same time, a charming story.
I:9772;120;And almost every shot reveals something about how films are made .
I:9772;121;stuntwork, set facades, directing extras, and even working with animals!
I:9772;122;A joyous ode to the people who make films!
I:9772;123;By the end I was in grateful tears.
I:9772;124;A truly inspiring film about making art.
I:9772;125;Truffault brilliantly illustrates the experience of being an artist in a medium that requires so many tedious details to be taken care of.
I:9772;126;The actors are superb and the characters are developed brilliantly, beginning the film as the caricatures that they present to strangers, and becoming more developed as they get to know one another.
I:9772;127;The music was also a suprise, as instead of using it as background filler or to create suspense, he brings in distinct themes at certain parts to draw one into greater understanding.
I:9772;128;watching the accompanying interviews was a great learning experience.
I:9772;129;That is understandable, but this is a well done dubbed film compared to others.
I:9772;130;This is a wonderful film and you should be grateful it is still available at all to the American public in any form.
I:9772;131;An entertaining movie but not as good as IMDB suggests.
I:9772;132;Wonderful film, that any lover of the cinema cannot be lost, mainlybecause is cinema within the cinema and the magic of thecinematographic accomplishment.
I:9772;133;"Hollywood keeps making films that, since ""Sunset Boulevard,"" see filmmaking as some kind of gothic tragedy."
I:9772;134;"There is no question here however that love, sex, egos, alcoholism, and the rest are all part of just trying to make a film

I:9772;138;"Severine, the older actress playing the mother in the film within a film complains that she and Alexandre, the romantic lead, hit Hollywood at about the same time and hsre she is playing mothers and other ""older women"", and he's still playing the romantic lead who gets the young girl."
I:9772;139;the details of film technology are fascinating, as are the story and continuity problems that arise and (due to the fact that films are shot out of order and two scenes that take place one after the other on screen may well be shot in reverse order and days, even months, apart) must be taken into account and require rewrites and even reshoots (though one attempts to avoid those) .
I:9772;140;the dream sequences (in black and white) are, in fact, actual events from director Truffaut's childhood.
I:9772;141;It means 'day for night'.
I:9772;142;This was my first foreign film and it was the dubbed version but it opened my eyes that great films can come outside the Hollywood studio system.
I:9772;143;It was many years before I got to see it in the original French but I was hooked.
I:9772;144;truffaut was one of the greatest directors ever and this was one of his best.
I:9772;145;what makes this a masterpiece is the acting.
I:9772;146;Truffaut gets the most from all his actors, including himself playing the director.
I:9772;147;And Truffaut is reunited with one of his early star finds, Jean.
I:9772;148;but the star of the film is the film.
I:9772;149;This is a joyous ode to filmmaking and is impossible to resist.
I:9772;150;more cynical, even more funny, but not nearly so complex or profound.
I:9772;151;Day for Night almost wants to be a tragedy, and while the fact that the film gets finished in the end lends the film a comic dimension, it is clear that Truffaut knows life is never so neatly packaged.
I:9772;152;That is, in fact, the central theme of the film: that life is unpredictable and often tragic, but cinema makes magic of tragedy, and is worth the sacrifice that are made for it.
I:9772;153;The acting is very real and compelling .
I:9772;154;The film itself seamlessly moves between scenes that are shot for the film within a film and scenes shot of the filming process and of the lives of the actors and crew.
I:9772;155;"I did enjoy the fact that Truffaut included himself as the director of the film with the film that he was also directing
I:9772;156;handed elements in the film, that belie Truffaut's otherwise light and subtle touch.
I:9772;157;at another moment the director opens a package of books and they are books about several of the great western directors including Orson Welles, Fellini, and Cocteau.
I:9772;158;was the point to make a comparison or to suggest a feeling of inadequacy?On the whole, though, in spite of a few reservations that may be peculiar to me, this is an excellent film that belongs especially among the very great films about film: 8 1/2, Stardust Memories, Living in Oblivion, Beware of a Holy Whore, State and Main, and a few others.
I:9772;159;Highly recommended for lovers of film.

I:9772;162;it is a declaration of love for the cinema where drama and fun are told with the incomparable grace and lightness of Truffaut.
I:9772;163;i am not a cinema expert by any means, but I have seen the subtitled version and I have seen the dubbed version, and the subtitled version is much funnier and more enjoyable.
I:9772;164;Probably thinking that, since it is such an immediate and enjoyable movie about movies, it might actually sell to English.
I:9772;165;Just as westerns sound right with American voices.
I:9772;166;But the movie itself is wonderful!
I:9772;167;The other movies were good, some even very good, but I came away from them with the impression that they were over.

I:9772;169;"It has a subject matter that had me sceptical
I:9772;170;autobiographical works are very well.
I:9772;171;"I think that is the beauty of ""Day for Night""."
I:9772;172;Truffaut gives us the impression that we are participants rather than an audience.

I:9772;175;Truffaut has a gift of including so many aspects of the process and he does it all with the personal touch of a cast that seems anxious that we get the most out of the experience.
I:9772;176;There is plenty of humor, more than enough drama, and it all is woven together in a tempo that eliminates boredom or confusion.
I:9772;177;Day for Night moves along as well as just about any picture I've seen.
I:9772;178;Kudos to the film editor in an off.
I:9772;179;I got to the end of the film in a very happy frame of mind.
I:9772;180;Day for Night is a classic!
I:9772;181;This was one of the movies that when I first saw it made me love the cinema even more.
I:9772;182;This film is a great treat to those who like film but know little about how they are made.
I:9772;183;scenes look into how a master director manages a whole bunch of quirky, sometimes difficult, and endearing people.
I:9772;184;on one level, it is really excellent drama.
I:9772;185;You have a psychologically fragile star (Bisset, who was never more beautiful), a man.
I:9772;186;They perform within a wonderful cast, in particular N. Baye, but also many French character actors who make brilliant often hilarious characterizations.
I:9772;187;This part of the film is wonderful and fast moving, a true treat of melodrama.
I:9772;188;The story within a story is very fun and there are multiple layers.
I:9772;189;It is a great story, even if its accuracy is open to question.
I:9772;190;"Day for Night is one of the best movies about the movies ever made, standing right up there with ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""Singin' in the Rain""."
I:9772;191;It is director Francois Truffaut's love letter to the movies, and especially to movie making.
I:9772;192;One of the nicest things about the film is that it focuses, not just on the cast, but on the crew.

I:9772;194;truffaut takes us behind the scenes to see the magic that is used to create the realistic world the cast inhabits.
I:9772;195;In a couple of very powerful moments, he shows how the filming process takes on a life of its own, overwhelming the personal feelings and better natures of the participants.
I:9772;196;In another scene the director utilizes words that the leading lady says to him in confidence to improve a dramatic scene in the film.
I:9772;197;the large cast includes, in addition to Truffaut himself, Jacqueline Bisset, Jean.
I:9772;198;pierre Aumont, Valentina Cortese, Nathalie Baye and Truffaut favorite Jean.
I:9772;199;All are in fine form, with standout performances by Cortese and Leaud.
I:9772;200;In one of the funniest, and yet touching, scenes Cortese, playing an alcoholic has.
I:9772;201;this film is a must for anyone who loves the movies, and is interested in seeing how movies are made, at least how they were made forty years ago.
I:9772;202;It is a comedy/drama, a movie for people who love movies, made by a director .
I:9772;203;the cast is certainly distinguished.

I:9772;206;the film's score, a tuneful beauty, is by Georges Delerue.

I:9772;213;It shows Ferrand, the director, as a deaf man who lives what he does, and is willing to deal with any difficulties involved.

I:9772;220;it also shows how the on set chemistry can essentially drive the final product.
I:9772;221;overall this movie is pretty clever and a must see for those interested in the art of film.
I:9772;222;Day For Night (La Nuit Americaine) is one of the finest movies ever made about the movies.
