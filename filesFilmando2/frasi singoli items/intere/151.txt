I:21067;1;This movie is very good, one of the best Bonds.
I:21067;2;Tanya Romanova is stunning and Robert Shaw (star of the movie Jaws ) is so cool as a villain.
I:21067;3;This is surely one of the best.
I:21067;4;FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE while being the second in the series to DR. NO is the first in which the James Bond popular culture came to know and love makes his appearance and is often considered the best of them all.
I:21067;5;Connery made a Bond better fit for the screen, giving the character more personality, more charisma and humor than Fleming's buttoned.
I:21067;6;living civil servant with fierce penetrating eyes, cruel mouth and laconic manner.
I:21067;7;sharp instinct for survival, complete with a wide array of international dossiers, and a license to kill.
I:21067;8;sleek in his Seville Row suit and top hat, the imported gold.
I:21067;9;Just as the spy, my favorite spy, does in the novels.
I:21067;10;Though truly, the film version of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is the definitive classic 007 spy thriller from which the gripping likes of Bond's later espionage intrigues, THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS and GOLDENEYE, have been born.
I:21067;11;What Connery has done .
I:21067;12;and what has been the key to the creation of this, the greatest film series ever based upon a literary figure .
I:21067;13;is that he took only what he needed from the Bond of the books, then added a great part of what could only be himself to the role.
I:21067;14;nosed adventurous literary figure with the smooth, sly.
I:21067;15;So they devise an intricate and devious scheme that would not only do away with 007, but also humiliate him, as well as the entire British Secret Service in the process.
I:21067;16;She approaches MI6 with the story that she wishes to defect, and that if they would assist her, she would give them in return the Soviet's top.
I:21067;17;Therefore, for this delicate mission, they send in their best agent Bond, of course, to retrieve it from her.
I:21067;18;Grant's determined to strike hard and swiftly at just the right time.
I:21067;19;While there, he and Bey find quite a lot of tense action and adventure, including a gathering with some gypsies, where a very entertaining catfight ensues.
I:21067;20;The Orient Express scenes are amongst the best in the series.
I:21067;21;Then there's a great finale action scene .
I:21067;22;As with many of the later films, Blofeld's face is never seen, but he's a scary entity nonetheless.
I:21067;23;this is the first Bond movie that uses all the wonderful staples that follow to this day, some 40 years later: sly cheeky wit, cool modes of transport, gorgeous Bond girls, beautiful exotic locales, dangerous villains with menacing henchmen, M, Moneypenny, Q and all his gadgets, the opening gun.
I:21067;24;barrel sequence followed by Maurice Binder's brilliant opening credits sequence .
I:21067;25;prevalent charm and charisma of Bond.
I:21067;26;john Barry's excellent score is played prodigiously here .
I:21067;27;But the movie's so good, it's easy to forgive such little shortcomings.
I:21067;28;this is my absolute favorite in the entire James Bond movie series.
I:21067;29;For, not only is it vastly entertaining to watch .
I:21067;30;This earlier film in the Bond series keeps a good pace and lets Sean Connery get on with solving the mystery and finding the clues .
I:21067;31;There is more of a dramatic feel to it .
I:21067;32;I recommend it to those who are unfamiliar with the less showy Bond films .
I:21067;33;Great hokie action and adventure.
I:21067;34;Great incredibly outrages stories that make for good entertainment.
I:21067;35;A lot of exotic scenery to entertain as well.
I:21067;36;After getting the upper hand, 'Red Grant' is betrayed by his greed, and James Bond wins again (its all in the script).
I:21067;37;They reach the motor boat to make their escape across the sea.
I:21067;38;love this movie, i believe one of the best, or the best james bond movie ever, and Sean connery did it naturally.
I:21067;39;This is a classic Bond film with Spector back to create havic in the world.
I:21067;40;This movie starts many of the bond immortal icons, face.
I:21067;41;Classic scenes like the helicopter chase on the mouintain and the train fight between bond and his assasin are just the beginning of this unforgettable Bond film, which started it all for the 007 collection.
I:21067;42;A true spy flick and one of Connery's Best performances.
I:21067;43;title chapter which in this movie sees an expert assasin take out what appears to be our intrepid agent untill it is revealed that it is a stage set up.
I:21067;44;q makes an apperance with the first of many gadgets that Bond will call on during his lifetime.
I:21067;45;I admit it, I had the toy attache' case as a kid.
I:21067;46;I love this collection of JB it is very entertaning.
I:21067;47;plus it gives me a chance to escape for a little time and enjoy a great movie.
I:21067;48;It was as fresh and interesting and suspenseful and any movie I had ever seen.
I:21067;49;Light on the gadgets, no humongous explosions, just suspense, mystery intrique AND James Bond done right.
I:21067;50;I enjoy the later ones, Brosnan is a great Bond, relies a but less on the gadgets than Moore.
I:21067;51;era Bond, but this to me is the true definition of who 007 really is.
I:21067;52;Every Bond fan should see and study this movie in order to understand the aspects of the Bond mystique that started the whole thing.
I:21067;53;I have always watched newer movies and seen huge explosions and massive action scenes.
I:21067;54;But From Russia With Love is a great movie that displays we don't need all the hype to have a good story line.
I:21067;55;The early Bond films are still the best, and this is in my top 3.
I:21067;56;It's beautifully shot, in exotic locations, and Sean Connery is at his peak.
I:21067;57;Along with Goldfinger, this is probably the best of the early James Bond films.
I:21067;58;Sean Connery was excellent in it.
I:21067;59;The story and the cast is great.
I:21067;60;The fight scene on the train between Connery and Shaw is worth the price alone!
I:21067;61;A face paced, well thought out and entertaining film.
I:21067;62;From Russia With Love [VHS]I like the James Bond movies from the beginning, and this is one of my favorites.
I:21067;63;I agree with those that think the Terrance Young Bond movies were the best, and this is the best of the three he directed.
I:21067;64;This movie is filled with lots of action, and great acting, it's also got Q!
I:21067;65;Great movie I really like this movie.
I:21067;66;recintly saw this movie and it's still great!!
I:21067;67;The image is superb,as always,for Blu.
I:21067;68;bonus features are good,but,no deleted scenes/test scenes.
I:21067;69;this is one of my personal favorites in the long running James Bond movie series,I highly recommend it.
I:21067;70;seven years later, I find it quite amazing that everybody involved actually made the movie.
I:21067;71;It's like he is this awesomely trained villain, and he finally gets James Bond in his hand.
I:21067;72;"Of course, as usual, James Bond will bed more women because he has this ""charm."""
I:21067;73;I think this is the best of the Bond movies, it definitely keeps your interest, and has lots of action right when you think it's starting to slow down, i'd recommend to any action movie fan, or bond fan.
I:21067;74;Now Red Grant, a powerful and dangerous agent of Spectre.
I:21067;75;And really, one reviewer is right.
I:21067;76;And that whole 5.10 minutes scene is absolutely uneccessary, and serves no purpose to the film.
I:21067;77;Now this moving does get interesting, once they get on the orient express.
I:21067;78;And the fight between Bond and Grant, one of the best hand to hand fights in the series.
I:21067;79;And to watch grant take a Bond's contact's place is awsome, but it still can't help this movie.
I:21067;80;M (Bernard Lee) tells James bond that he is to help Tatiana and get the Lector.
I:21067;81;Every thing sounds pretty simple.
I:21067;82;When some one mentions 007 this is the one that come in mind.
I:21067;83;It has well known good guys, bad guys and good.
I:21067;84;"See her in the movie that made her famous ""The Threepenny Opera""."
I:21067;85;She even looks good through a periscope.
I:21067;86;ray and big screen TV does this film justice.
I:21067;87;Bond is always great to watch.
I:21067;88;"I've enjoyed ""From Russia With Love"" since I first saw it in the theater as a 13 year old boy."
I:21067;89;This movie epitomizes the James Bond character as written by Ian Fleming and is closer to the source novel than any other Bond film.
I:21067;90;The combination of suspense, action and tongue.
I:21067;91;humor is what made the series so popular and works the best in this film.
I:21067;92;ray edition is so well produced as to make me think that I'm watching the movie for the first time in a theater.
I:21067;93;The detail and vibrant colors jump out at you and the 5.1 sound track, especially during the action scenes is breathtaking.
I:21067;94;As a relative newcomer to the James Bond franchise (since 1996) and a lover of the later films, I read all the very high reviews of this movie as ordered it without hesitation.
I:21067;95;Without going too much into detail about plot, characters, story line (there are plenty of people who have supplied reviews), i'll just say that this is one of the most enjoyable of the Bond films.
I:21067;96;this is a REAL spy movie.
I:21067;97;"sean Connery gives an excellent performance in this movie, playing a more serious and focused character than you'll find from ""Diamonds are Forever"" and onward."
I:21067;98;Ian Fleming's novel was done great justice here.
I:21067;99;The reason that the board is in the film is that the producers worked on that film as well.
I:21067;100;Still, a great entrace into the series.
I:21067;101;that briefcase is very cool.
I:21067;102;The first three Bond films are the best.
I:21067;103;This film is an excellent adaptation of Ian Fleming's novel.
I:21067;104;From the beginning, it grabs the viewer, and takes them on an exciting adventure.
I:21067;105;The Bond woman Tatyiana Romanova, is wonderfully played by Danielle Bianchi.
I:21067;106;She brings elegance, and grace to her role despite her objectives.
I:21067;107;This leads to a wonderful climax on the train.
I:21067;108;This Turkish millionaire is wonderfully played by Pedro Armendariz.
I:21067;109;All in all, a fine film.
I:21067;110;The second Bond movie is possibly the best true spy story of the series.
I:21067;111;There is a little bit of mystery, a lot of double dealing and spy.
I:21067;112;This is a great Bond flick.
I:21067;113;This an awesome classic bond flick with everything you could expect.
I:21067;114;Love the retro gadgets and the retro babes!
I:21067;115;An already prime example of the attraction for Bond movies, From Russia with Love may be the finest of the Sean Connery era.
I:21067;116;A great movie and a great medium.
I:21067;117;60,000,007 James Bond fans live in a throbbing world of hot blooded excitement!
I:21067;118;The titles themselves are a knockout, all the more so thanks to Lionel Bart's striking theme, orchestrated by John Barry who, for the first of eleven times provides Bond with an exciting score that's as much a signature for the series as the famous gun.
I:21067;119;From Russia With Love is slower paced by later Bond standards but smarter, too, with a comparatively modest plot involving a decoding device coveted by SPECTRE.
I:21067;120;cheek humor that would come to characterize the series was pretty much introduced here in an effort to offset the charges of sadism levied against the first film, but it doesn't overtake the action, including a fight aboard the Orient Express widely hailed as one of the greatest action scenes ever staged.
I:21067;121;"if the other films in the series warrant classification in the adventure genre, ""From Russia With Love"" is a thriller, the only film in the series I can imagine Alfred Hitchcock directing."
I:21067;122;the cast is one of the best ever recruited for a Bond film with Robert Shaw's muscle bound hit.
I:21067;123;If you examine Bond's fight in the train car, you will observe that the scene captures how people actually fight in real life.
I:21067;124;It was as real as I've seen on film.
I:21067;125;hand combat scenes can be laid at the feet of Bruce Lee.
I:21067;126;In the spy genre, I suppose the last Bourne film certainly went a long way toward capturing the rhythm and feel of real martial combat.
I:21067;127;this is a great movie.
I:21067;128;it is sharper than the movie theatre version I saw in 1964.
I:21067;129;they are worth the money.
I:21067;130;I felt that the storyline in this film was to simple.
I:21067;131;Trinity city books is a fantastic company for all of your video needs.
I:21067;132;He is actually the Bond
I:21067;133;top plots found in later Bond offerings.
I:21067;134;Even though this film is almost 50 years old, released in 1963, it is one of the strongest Bond films.
I:21067;135;This second Bond film followed Dr. No and preceded the incredible international sensation, Goldfinger.
I:21067;136;This is one of the most realistic and feasible of the James Bond plots.
I:21067;137;the scenes of Istanbul feel right and the film captures the sense of place.
I:21067;138;it is also interesting that Lotte Lenya, plays a role in this film.
I:21067;139;She is a historic figure in the theater, particularly in performing the work of Brecht and Kurt Weil.
I:21067;140;The film is suspenseful and well made.
I:21067;141;It is the most realistic of the Bond films.
I:21067;142;By far this is the best Bond film made.
I:21067;143;Nothing tops it, because it resembles a well.
I:21067;144;crafted spy thriller from any era.
I:21067;145;What is best about this film .
I:21067;146;face train fight to the excessively beautiful Bond girl, you have it all.
I:21067;147;Plus the set pieces are amazing, look at how Terence Young uses Istanbul seemlessly in the story .
I:21067;148;and Robert Shaw quite possibly is the best screen assassin .
I:21067;149;And SPECTRE is at the heart of this film, the one thing that makes all the Bond films post FOR YOUR EYES ONLY only mediocre at best.
I:21067;150;A great hero is made by a great villian, and Bloefeld's presence is the best antagonist for Bond.
I:21067;151;but make no mistake the story is one of the best .
I:21067;152;This movie is great for all of you people out there that may be a little sick of the generic Bond movie.
I:21067;153;From Russia With Love is exstremly well written and actually a little confusing.
I:21067;154;THe majority of the adventure takes place on a train as Bond and a Russian girl struggle to bring somthing very important back to England.
I:21067;155;this is one of my favorite Bond films because it really stands apart from the rest and I like the fact that it is really well written.
I:21067;156;"This sequel to the first James Bond adventure, ""Dr. No"" proved that with intelligence and diligence, it is possible to create a series of movies that all have the same dynamic energy."
I:21067;157;Lotte Lenya as Rosa Kleb is just terrific.
I:21067;158;this, second of Bond films, has a literate script, fine acting, double entendre that is not embarrassing and Mr. Connery.
I:21067;159;Purists may have to get over how far (and how quickly) the Bond franchise moved away from the template of this foreboding, deliberate spy adventure that has always ranked as one of the very best films in the series.
I:21067;160;"It's delicious viewing, but not exactly ""fun"" in the way, say, ""You Only Live Twice"" or even ""For Your Eyes Only"" might be."
I:21067;161;the heavies in this film are uniformly splendid (including Blofeld's Cat).
I:21067;162;Romantic, sweet and girlish, she is played and preyed upon by SPECTRE to perform dirty deeds for patriotism.
I:21067;163;We feel how tenderness surprises and overtakes her the longer she stays in Bond's company, and we feel how excruciatingly her fantasy life bursts when Kleb returns on the scene in Venice, reminding her of her almost.
I:21067;164;But such time as they share onscreen is among the most genuinely erotic, tense, and affecting companionship we've seen in a Bond picture.
I:21067;165;"Minus the great Diana Rigg's Tracy (""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" always commands special privileges) Tatiana may be the most luminous and satisfying of all Bond's onscreen companions."
I:21067;166;connery, of course, is at his best here.
I:21067;167;A masterful thriller, ceaselessly sexy, suspenseful, and exciting.
I:21067;168;it's still the classic Bond that I remembered.
I:21067;169;Definitely timeless and something one can come back to ever so often over the years and Still find worth the watch.
I:21067;170;back when a film had beautiful women who didn't need to strip down to nearly nothing to be tantilising and men wore tailored suits with out looking or being vain.Yes, it's very much a timeless classic.
I:21067;171;A ton of scenes in the film don't make any sense either.
I:21067;172;It has NOTHING to do with the plot, yet a good deal of the film is spent here.
I:21067;173;"a. raid"" Whew!Out of all the Bond films Richard Maibaum has provided the most complex plot,returning again as screen scribe and Terence Young returns as director and John Barry giving the film one of the most punchy and recognizable music scores of the entire series."
I:21067;174;Terence Young really maintains the style and feel he created on Dr. No and makes the action set pieces bigger and better.
I:21067;175;The atypical Bond storyline gives it twists and turns unusual for the series as Bond himself, really doesn't seem to know how out of his depth he is in the game that SPECTRE is playing.
I:21067;176;istanbul and the Orient Express hurtling through Yugoslavia are the perfect settings for this thriller and tension builds with the superb supporting cast including Pedro Armenda`riz playing lovable rogue and head of station T Turkey, Ali Kerim Bey, Bond's liaison.
I:21067;177;He's scary every time he utters a line not that he has many!That brings us to the set pieces of this gem.
I:21067;178;The chemistry sparks between the two leads, 007 ranging from charming to brutal toward his Russian flame due to her dubious motives.
I:21067;179;well apart from the fashions giving it away again of course.
I:21067;180;There is also a platter of delicious extras from a making of, to a look at the growing popularity of Bond.
I:21067;181;Sean Connery is very good however, as is Daniela Bianchi.
I:21067;182;but the best of these three is FRWL.
I:21067;183;the film has great characters set in a storyline that is genuinely suspenseful.
I:21067;184;The fight scene aboard the train between 007 and Red Grant is one of the best ever filmed.
I:21067;185;Sean Connery returns to the role of 007 in the second film of the series.
I:21067;186;I won't give away too much of the story, but this film features excellent plot and dialogue with some swift action sequences squeezed in here and there.
I:21067;187;amazing picture and killer sound.
I:21067;188;This was the best of the Bond films.
I:21067;189;FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE has great scenes from the backdrop of Istanbul to the Orient Express.
I:21067;190;bond in this film are a bit stereotyped, they are impressively portrayed.
I:21067;191;but '63s From Russia w/ Love was very good, lots of action and some interesting plot twists (I won't give any away, you'll just have to see the movie:)!
I:21067;192;I will say that is believable for the most part and well acted.
I:21067;193;From the gadgets to the stuns to the script it all has a better feeling about it.
I:21067;194;Bitrates for all the remasters average from 25 to 30 and this one has a nice layer of grain evident in each frame.
I:21067;195;Sure, in certain parts it is dated but this one has held up remarkably over the years for being only the second film in the series.
I:21067;196;this movie was packaged great.
I:21067;197;it also made it here in great timing.
I:21067;198;ray which is why I only give it 4 stars, but I would still highly recommend it.
I:21067;199;This is really an excellent movie as far as content and performances.
I:21067;200;From Russia With Love is easily the best movie because if gives you everything that could be wanted in a Bond film.
I:21067;201;The thrilling action, the exotic locations, the menacing villians, the master plot, and of course Bond at his best.
I:21067;202;I was really impressed with this movie and I think it stacks up with the great Bond movies.
I:21067;203;(From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, View To a Kill (ya right) ) but all in all i think that this was a very enjoyable Bond film, and stands among the greatest!
I:21067;204;Sean Connery is the original James Bond in this thrilling second film in the series that has 22 films and counting!The story follows James Bond as he attempts to locate a Soviet cryptographic decoder and take the device to England.
I:21067;205;Klebb also acquires the help of an unknowing Russian cipher clerk named Tatiana Romanova (played by Daniela Bianchi).
I:21067;206;this film has a perfect blend of everything: action, suspense, Bond girls, gadgets, you name it!
I:21067;207;Several scenes in the movie really stand out including the opening sequence, the gypsy camp scene, the brawl with Grant on board the Orient Express, and the fight against Rosa Klebb and her poison.
I:21067;208;Daniela Bianchi deserves special mention as a Bond girl, she is certainly one of the most beautiful ones to date.
I:21067;209;still one of the Best Bond movies yet!
I:21067;210;I bought this for a friend for Christmas this year.
I:21067;211;A beautifully remastered copy of From Russia with Love, full of vivid color and crisp detail.
I:21067;212;set of the cast, and includes director Terence Young and Ian Fleming.
I:21067;213;A must have for Bond fans!
I:21067;214;This has everything going for it!
I:21067;215;Adventure, Esionage, and and great fight scenes!
I:21067;216;Instead, largely thanks to the ingenuity of director Terence Young and film editor Peter Hunt, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE topped the success of the first film and solidified the success of the James Bond series in a single blow.
I:21067;217;Widely considered to be one of the best films of the entire series (if not the best), FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE manages to get everything right.
I:21067;218;Sean Connery is at his finest in this picture, confident in his sophomore performance.
I:21067;219;The plot is intricate and the action is well.
I:21067;220;Indeed, not only was the second James Bond film a wonderful action movie, it was a good movie in its own right.
I:21067;221;"after the famous ""gun barrel"" sequence at the top of the film, we are treated to the first pre."
I:21067;222;Lasting only three minutes or so, it works perfectly to draw us once again into the dangerous world of Bond.
I:21067;223;"It would, of course, set the tone for the Bond films to come, as the opening ""teaser"" would gradually become more and more elaborate, taking on a world of its own."
I:21067;224;"worked version of the Bond theme by John Barry, including the ""From Russia With Love"" theme."
I:21067;225;the first ever popular song in a Bond film.
I:21067;226;the plot begins with a nod to the Spassky/Bronstein chess match of 1960, widely considered one of the most inspired, brilliant chess matches of all time.
I:21067;227;Immediately, he makes his move, uncovering a deadly discovered check.
I:21067;228;Kronsteen, known for his brilliant chess play, has devised an evil plan that is perfect.
I:21067;229;He has considered every move and countermove and all that is required is proper execution.
I:21067;230;the plan is wonderfully complex for a James Bond film and might seem rather down.
I:21067;231;While the British and Russians battle it out for the decoding machine, SPECTRE will swoop in and capture it for themselves.
I:21067;232;paced, it is precisely this down.
I:21067;233;earth style that lends the film genuine authenticity and appeal.
I:21067;234;Everything is pulled off in fine style and the film works, so long as you keep track of exactly who is doing what to whom.
I:21067;235;ultimately, it is the memorable characters that make FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE so enjoyable.
I:21067;236;In particular, while the film gives us several villains to feast upon, the best is Red Grant (Robert Shaw).
I:21067;237;What makes Red so compelling is the fact that he is so understated.
I:21067;238;a man worthy of James Bond himself.
I:21067;239;Red is truly one of Bond's equals.
I:21067;240;When Bond and he finally meet in the climactic train fight (a fight known for its brutality and complexity), it is a true battle or equals.
I:21067;241;tatiana Romanova is our new Bond girl and she pulls off the part in fine style.
I:21067;242;Although not nearly as interesting as Ursula Andress in DR. NO, Tatiana manages to play her part convincingly and is the first Bond girl that is on the same playing field as Bond, given that she is a Russian agent.
I:21067;243;It would prove a constant challenge to the James Bond series to try and create an equal for Bond and a compelling love interest, while still allowing for the action to drive the story.
I:21067;244;Connery looks far more confident in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and now seems to wear Bond's grace and wit naturally.
I:21067;245;She establishes the time of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE as occurring six months after his previous adventure.
I:21067;246;Connery is as smooth as ever with the ladies and seems even more relaxed than in his first adventure.
I:21067;247;Wonderfully understated, Sean Connery manages to deliver all of the dry one.
I:21067;248;liners with perfect taste and there is nothing campy about them.
I:21067;249;The romance is all hinted at and nicely done.
I:21067;250;Connery truly is the best Bond.
I:21067;251;This time, Q is armed with the first official Bond gadget: a Swiss.
I:21067;252;The meeting of Red Grant and Bond on the train is the best action sequence in the entire film and is one of the most brutal encounters Bond would ever have on screen.
I:21067;253;In fact, the spectacular helicopter chase and boat chase that round out the end of the film pale in comparison to the suspense generated in the close quarters of the Orient Express.
I:21067;254;For my tastes, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is perfectly paced and the film divides into several neat chapters.
I:21067;255;So, the first twenty minutes of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE are a real pleasure for the film lover who sleeps in each one of us.
I:21067;256;Terence Young invites us to see what's behind the facts and shows us, in the first scene of the movie as well as in the last image of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, that cinema is the subject of his work.
I:21067;257;Dr. No was a good beginning, but From Russia With Love is the first Bond movie to hit classic status.
I:21067;258;The lovely Daniella Bianchi totally exudes sensuality.
I:21067;259;Robert Shaw ranks with the best of the 007 adversaries, as Red Grant.
I:21067;260;The train fight between him and Bond is, in my opinion, the greatest movie fight scene of all time!
I:21067;261;Pedro Armendarez is funny and enthusiastic as Bond's male aly, Kerim Bey.
I:21067;262;Now, the Bond series first hits it's stride!
I:21067;263;"up to ""Dr. No"" turned out to be the most consistently satisfying of the whole Bond franchise, despite a rather small plot driver involving a ""Lektor"" decoding machine that was past its macguffin sell."
I:21067;264;James Bond and a beautiful Russian clerk from SMERSH are caught in the middle.
I:21067;265;And it's more than enough.
I:21067;266;From Russia with Love shows us a possible direction that this franchise might have taken if the producers had been interested in smaller but perhaps better films.
I:21067;267;"music and credit sequence: great Barry score, but the actual ""From Russia with Love"" theme ."
I:21067;268;is saved for the end.
I:21067;269;"Barry's first Bond score also included the ""Second Bond Theme"", which has become the high."
I:21067;270;"Binder merely went on to perfect the form, starting with the next film in the franchise, ""Goldfinger""."
I:21067;271;bond Girl: quite uniquely, only one: Daniela Bianchi, who is one of the franchise's very best.
I:21067;272;Not only is she gorgeous .
I:21067;273;but she appears to have great chemistry with Connery.
I:21067;274;I presume the studio made a small killing after the film's release, selling toy briefcases to blown.
I:21067;275;"This film also introduces Desmond Lllewelyn as ""Q""."
I:21067;276;His partnership with Our Man in Istanbul further adds to what is a pretty realistic movie.
I:21067;277;By the way, the world.
I:21067;278;A Bond movie that's an actual spy movie.
I:21067;279;From Russia with Love is the pinnacle of the series, in my estimation.
I:21067;280;With an excellent startup from Dr. No, James Bond gets into full swing battling SPECTRE up and down Europe, and has one of the best Bond fights on the Orient Express.
I:21067;281;Beautiful women, tough bad guys and just the right amount of Bond toys make it one of the best James Bond movies of them all!
I:21067;282;The second of the James Bond movies features solid scriptwriting, excellent supporting actors and Sean Connery in his best performance as 007.
I:21067;283;lotte Lenya is brilliant as the blunt, menacing SPECTRE recruit Rosa Klebb.
I:21067;284;"And Robert Shaw as her henchman, Donald ""Red"" Grant is nearly 007's equal in terms of both determination and physical strength, as seen by the classic fistfight on board the Orient Express."
I:21067;285;More convincing are Pedro Armendariz as the fun.
I:21067;286;"Unlike the somewhat thuggish Bond provided by Connery in ""Dr. No,"" the British agent shows the cool and confidence of someone in his element."
I:21067;287;Connery is firm without overacting, and witty without being cute.
I:21067;288;"Goldfinger may be the more gripping action film and be more loved, but ""From Russia With Love"" is the overall best in the Bond series and one of the best in the spy genre."
I:21067;289;This is one debate that'll go on forever.
I:21067;290;Which James Bond film is the best?
I:21067;291;From Russia wih Love AND Goldfinger are the TWO best Bond movies.
I:21067;292;The excellent Harry Palmer series with Michael Caine is known for being the antithesis of Bond.
I:21067;293;It has the heaviest espionage quotient and the best atmosphere in the entire series.
I:21067;294;This is an excellent one.
I:21067;295;FRWL is a real FILM.
I:21067;296;By that I mean director Terrance Young Co. make excellent use of the basics of the medium: dissolves, musical interplay, voice.
I:21067;297;"overs, creative editing
I:21067;298;In any good action thriller, you have to feel that the hero is vulnerable and could die at any moment.
I:21067;299;This raises our level of exitement and interest.
I:21067;300;Bond is extremely vulnerable in FRWL.
I:21067;301;In the entire series, is there a more believable and clever escape sequence than Bond tricking Grant into opening the briefcase?
I:21067;302;Hmmm, well maybe the classic laser/crotch scene in Goldfinger.
I:21067;303;The best escapes are the ones in which Bond uses his head as opposed to a gadget.
I:21067;304;Because of all the pop culture spy.
I:21067;305;isms: The super car, the hidden mastermind stroking his cat, the secret enemy base/island, code.
I:21067;306;Consistently one of the best in the series of Bond Films.
I:21067;307;James Bond's (Sean Connery) assignment is to make contact with a beautiful Russian defector (Daniela Bianchi) who has promised to help the British obtain a top secret Soviet encryption device, even though it is almost sure to be a trap.
I:21067;308;this excellent film shows the budding franchise still searching for its tone.
I:21067;309;Such campy elements as Dr. No's secret island stronghold are gone, and director Terence Young presents a gritty spy drama that one could imagine happening in the real world.
I:21067;310;Connery plays Bond as more of the wise.
I:21067;311;All the usual stuff that makes a good 007 movie.
I:21067;312;Very little gadgetry, but has a decent amount of action.
I:21067;313;From Russia With Love is not just one of the greatest Bond films, but one of the greatest films in genral.
I:21067;314;The villan, Red Grant, is truly the most lethal in the series.
I:21067;315;Connery gives an amazing preformance as 007.
I:21067;316;The harrowing scene on the Orville Express is truly the greatest in movie history.
I:21067;317;The gadgets are the best, and the Bond girl is outstanding.
I:21067;318;From Russia With Love, the second 007 flick is still considered one of the series finest.
I:21067;319;still in it's early stages, it's an action packed improvement on the previous Dr. no .
I:21067;320;fRWL may seem a bit dated, but it still stands among the other twenty 007 films as one of it's best.
I:21067;321;My son loves this movie and it was nice to get it in a special edition for my favorite autistic person!!
I:21067;322;(I Love Lucy 2nd season, Lava lamp, Cats Cradle) Tv/Move Book/ and just fun.
I:21067;323;From Russia With Love is perhaps the best James Bond movie ever.
I:21067;324;sean Connery said of all his seven films, that From Russia with Love was his best.
I:21067;325;From Russia With love has a better plot, and much more suspense.
I:21067;326;the newest assasion that works for SPECTRE.
I:21067;327;He meets up with an ally in the form of Kerim Bey.
I:21067;328;Bond meets Tataina, and they take the Lektor on a train back to Britain with Kerim Bey.
I:21067;329;He confronts bond in a train compartment and tells the disastorous plan.
I:21067;330;He tells Bond that they taped him and Tatiana making love, and have made a letter where Tataina says she'll turn the film over to the police unless he marries her.
I:21067;331;Bond lives, and leaves with Tatiana.
I:21067;332;from Russia With Love is clearly one of the series best, and filled with action, suspense and an adventerous mission from 007!
I:21067;333;great movie at at at at at at at at at at at at ata at ata t at at at at at at at ata at at at ata aata ta
I:21067;334;This was the James Bond movie that I saw on the big screen.
I:21067;335;screen chemistry between James Bond and Tatiana Ramova, and I love the movie's intrigue and mystery.
I:21067;336;This is one of the great all.
I:21067;337;I was a boy that was extremely entertained !!
I:21067;338;now, I had read all the Ian Fleming 007 books and loved the almost pulp nature of theirpresentation.
I:21067;339;I wasjust old enough to get into the film and loved the gritty, fun attitude it exuded.
I:21067;340;The film, tome, was the best Connory/Bond he had ever made.
I:21067;341;"The film is presented in 1.66:1 widescreen andlooks wonderful
I:21067;342;In short ,it is just a lot of good oldfashioned fun served up with a wink and a smile.
I:21067;343;Certainly not the most exciting James Bond flick ever created, still, From Russia With Love is one of the most loyal to Ian Fleming's imagination.
I:21067;344;This 2nd entry into the Bond movie franchise is certainly a step up from its predacessor .
I:21067;345;The improved experience is actually saying a lot, since Dr. No was teriffic and seen as one of the best Bond films by many fans.
I:21067;346;from Russia With Love is a very intelligent, in.
I:21067;347;depth and well plotted story.
I:21067;348;It is certainly what a great spy movie is all about.
I:21067;349;Sean Connery gives us one of his best performances of his career as he is already a natural at the part of James Bond just after two films (though many will argue he really peaked in Goldfinger, the next film in the series).
I:21067;350;sPECTRE makes a stronger return in this film, and will continue to be present for many films to come as the center of conflict for Bond.
I:21067;351;"He does have two very important scenes of dialouge, yet we do not get to see his face (which will not happen until ""You Only Live Twice"")."
I:21067;352;A reference is made to Dr. No, which is a nice reminder of continuation from the first film.
I:21067;353;Grant (Robert Shaw) is a hired KGB, who makes his presence sit quitely and patiently in the shadows until his exciting entrance later in the movie, confusing Bond at first and then giving us a very real and suspensful train cabin fight that is done very well.
I:21067;354;From Russia With Love is definetly a film that the more mature audience fans of Bond will love.
I:21067;355;power to make it very successful.
I:21067;356;It's a classic I've seen many times.
I:21067;357;Now it is great to have it available on Amazon Instant Video.
I:21067;358;It's also nice to connect the big screen smart.
I:21067;359;Thanks Amazon for Amazon prime.
I:21067;360;If your most recent copy of FRWL is on VHS, the price is worth the upgrade.
I:21067;361;In my opinion the best of all Bond movies.
I:21067;362;I saw it when it was first released and had forgotten much of the plot, so it was fun to see the improbable adventures of Mr. Bond all over again.
I:21067;363;Sean Connery at his best and Daniela Bianchi is beautiful as a Russian spy.
I:21067;364;It is Interesting to see Istanbul in the early 1960s, full of American built cars and portrayed as a thoroughly secular city.
I:21067;365;A rock solid suspense/action/adventure genre.
I:21067;366;bender, From Russia With Love eases from gripping moments of tension to smart bits of detective work with almost no effort at all.
I:21067;367;a careful balance that this series isn't usually able to manage so efficiently.
I:21067;368;up to the events of Dr. No, it's also an impressive step up in almost every category .
I:21067;369;Loaded with a perfect lead, an exotic romance, a healthy supporting cast and a strong, dangerous villain, my only complaint is that it could have benefited from a faster timeline aboard the Orient Express.
I:21067;370;One of the character's best showings, it stands the test of time incredibly well.
I:21067;371;Worth watching if you haven't seen it.
I:21067;372;Everybody has their favorite movie.
I:21067;373;This is as close to realism as the Bond series got.
I:21067;374;The fight between Bond and Grant is my favorite in the series.
I:21067;375;This is my favorite movie of all time.
I:21067;376;The movie, which is part of a trilogy of bond movies, was very good for its time.
I:21067;377;I have to say that I enjoyed the movie, though I did not love it like other spy movies.
I:21067;378;Connery is sharp, whitty, and at his best in this film.
I:21067;379;The plot of the story is good!
I:21067;380;Great actor, fun movie to watch.
I:21067;381;I was born many years after this movie was made, now I understand why Bond is so iconic.
I:21067;382;From Russia with Love is an excellent 1963 spy thriller, based on Ian Fleming's novel, which keeps you riveted to the seat throughout the show.
I:21067;383;This is among the best James Bond spy thriller, thanks to the exceptional skills of the director Terence Young.
I:21067;384;this is a classic action packed James Bond spy movie with a straightforward plot which is well made with excellent acting all round.
I:21067;385;Istanbul is the site of the first portion of the film and shows itself well.
I:21067;386;One of my favorite Bond movies of all time, however I wasn't able to finish watching it this time around because Amazon removed it from the library of Prime legible movies overnight.
I:21067;387;From Russia with LoveThe second movie featuring James Bond, Agent 007 of her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service continues to marvel audiences the world over.
I:21067;388;the James Bond movies capture the action and romance found in the books by the author and surfaced a world of espionage, gadgets, secret weapons, beautiful women and amazing cars.
I:21067;389;The success of Sean Connery created an image so powerful that still to today, it is thought as that of the best Bond character.
I:21067;390;from Russia with Love dazzled audiences with an action packed film where Bond is sent to help Tatiana Romanova defect in Turkey.
I:21067;391;robert Shaw is magnificent in the role of Red Grant who skillfully pursues Bond throughout this film with the intention of eliminating 007.
I:21067;392;The plot starts to unfold and we learn that Kronsteen, masterfully played by Vladek Sheybal, is a Chess player who plans to steal a Lektor cryptographic device from Russia and has thought of every variation to successfully accomplish his mission.
I:21067;393;rosa Klebb, played by Lotte Lenya, is given leadership of the mission and she selects Tatiana Romanova, beautifully played by Daniela Bianchi as the pawn that will capture Bond.
I:21067;394;Grant drugs Romanova at dinner and then, overcomes Bond telling him that while Romanova believes she is working for mother Russia, she is really working for SPECTRE.
I:21067;395;Without a doubt, one of the most memorable Bond films by Sean Connery.
I:21067;396;It's all here: the one liners, the music, the locales and the formidable baddies.
I:21067;397;I do recommend the movie but like many others, I don't rate it as one of the all.
I:21067;398;overall a B+ and more than worth a look.
I:21067;399;They made a gem here.
I:21067;400;You may know the right wines but you're the one on your knees The train fight scene ranks up there with the ones Lazenby did in OHMSS , and some of Dalton's.
I:21067;401;By the way, Brosnan is adequate and Roger Boore never had a good fight scene.
I:21067;402;Armendariz as Karim Bey is fantastic, he is the best ally of Bond in any movie.
I:21067;403;He didn't have action scenes but he was smart and witty and was like a wise master to 007.
I:21067;404;tanya (Bianchi) was gorgeous and convincing as a Russian spy.
I:21067;405;By the way, don't you just love #1's (Blofeld) voice?
I:21067;406;It is one of the best of the Sean Connery era, with an outstanding story from Ian Fleming's novel, and a terrific screenplay by Johanna Harwood (who also collaborated on Dr. No).
I:21067;407;i consider this one of the best of the Bond series.
I:21067;408;the film was destined for success from the outset.
I:21067;409;"The first film, ""Dr. No"" was so well received that a sort of mania was building in expectation of the sequel."
I:21067;410;When it was released, it was an instant success.
I:21067;411;"this film along with ""Goldfinger"" represents the best of the series."
I:21067;412;It was early enough that the concept was still fresh and unadulterated by excessive gimmickry.
I:21067;413;As the Bond series continued, there was always an obsession with outdoing the previous film.
I:21067;414;From Russia With Love is the essence of Bond in its purest form, a straight spy story with more intrigue than action.
I:21067;415;sean Connery was outstanding in this film.
I:21067;416;He was energetic and exciting in the role, in complete command of each frame.
I:21067;417;Daniela Bianchi was also excellent as the duplicitous temptress whose professed love for Bond is always suspect.
I:21067;418;scenes featurette, with a lot of historical information and retrospective interviews with Connery, Bianchi and others.
I:21067;419;i've always felt that Connery was the Quintessential Bond, and this was among the best of his Bond performances.
I:21067;420;I rated this film a 9/10.
I:21067;421;the images are so impressive natural!I bought this together with Package 1.
I:21067;422;it's my special Christmas gift.
I:21067;423;The second best film in the series,beaten only by OHMSS.
I:21067;424;Once one gets past the plot contrivance of a spy that introduces himself by his real name, the rest is easy.
I:21067;425;connery seems to be having fun.
I:21067;426;the special effects, sets, stunts were state of the art for the day.
I:21067;427;if you are a 007 fan, it all works.
I:21067;428;Of the first three Bond films, FRWL is my favorite and one of my top 5 Bond films.
I:21067;429;assured in this film, just watch the way he saunters in after the attempted assasination of his friend Kerim Bey by a hidden bomb, he is just so cool.
I:21067;430;The older I get, the more I appreciate the beauty of Daniela Bianchi, for some reason, one of the lesser.
I:21067;431;The fight scene between Connery and Robert Shaw on the Istanbul Express is the best and one of the most brutal in the series.
I:21067;432;this film is an absolute classic and I look forward to getting it on blu.
I:21067;433;This is the second bond and possibly the very best.
I:21067;434;ouch!Most of the movie, Bond spends with lovely Russian agent Tatiana Romanova (Daniella Bianchi) which provides the romance interest.
I:21067;435;This one sets the tone for the subsequent Bond action/espionage dramas, and has the charm which some of the latest bond movies lack.
I:21067;436;FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is considered to be one of the better Bond films in the series.
I:21067;437;Sean Connery continues his portrayal of the character in the Fleming literary mold but simultaneously continues to refine his performance adding more depth to the character's worldliness, intellect, social graces and wry humor.
I:21067;438;"Interestingly, John Barry began his ""official"" scoring duties in tandem with his screen credit on FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE bringing a highly recognizable and definitive substantiating sound to the Bond series that distinguished it with his unique and inimitable musical style."
I:21067;439;FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is exceptional filmmaking.
I:21067;440;When compared to other films in the series it stands alone bringing in very few, if any, elements of the fantastic allowing Bond to rely on his own wit and skill for survival to overcome the opposition.
I:21067;441;"Since this highly touted espionage movie is regarded by many as the best of the James Bond series along with ""Goldfinger"", I figured it would be a good place for me to be introduced to Sean Connery's legendary Agent 007, aka James Bond."
I:21067;442;"Based on Ian Fleming's novel of the same name, ""From Russia With Love"" opens with a suspenseful bang."
I:21067;443;certainly there is a lot of espionage and action, including a bar fight, a gun battle in a gypsy camp, the cold.
I:21067;444;"blooded killing of enemy agents (""She should have kept her mouth shut"") and several improbable chase sequences with a helicopter and boats."
I:21067;445;But this is what the movie is all about: love at first sight, dancing, lots of female flesh and sensuous women, sexual innuendo, and frequent implied promiscuity as James Bond has no problem getting on with all the beautiful ladies he wants.
I:21067;446;The success of the movie probably owes something to the fact that John F. Kennedy included the novel in his top ten, and the fact that it is probably the best of all the James Bond movies.
I:21067;447;Fans of the James Bond are entitled to their opinion that this is one of the best in the genre, but I've just discovered that I don't care for the genre at all, because I was hoping for more Russia than love.
I:21067;448;Thought by many I know to be the best in the series, James bond returns after his debut in the film Dr. No with this follow up, From Russia With Love.
I:21067;449;With one of the best looking Bond girls (Daniela Bianchi) and some of the best villains ever, one of which is played by Robert Shaw (Jaws) and some great shooting locations, this second film in a very long running serious is great.
I:21067;450;You've got a creepy lesbian villain with a poison tipped knife on the end of her shoe, a gypsy fight between two hot chicks, and a great train fight to round up this action film.
I:21067;451;ray and are a fan of James Bond then this is worth getting.
I:21067;452;This is a must have for Bond fans and film fans alike.
I:21067;453;FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is Bond with a brain.
I:21067;454;This is the most intelligent of the Bond films, holding up for 40 plus years.
I:21067;455;Terrance Young masterfully directs the action and credit Matt Monroe with the first bonafide Bond theme song.
I:21067;456;all polish are top notch.
I:21067;457;Many people consider this work as the best of Bond series .
I:21067;458;And to me it has very interesting and enriching issues that makes it totally apart from the others .
I:21067;459;"the locations in Istanbul are gorgeous 
I:21067;460;"worthable film , though ny favorite film of Bond is Goldfinger and Thunderball this work is to me the third in the list of the great Bond series with the best Bond ever 
I:21067;461;Sean Connery is my favorite Bond.
I:21067;462;Most of his movies were in the early years and are kind of cheesy but he's still my favorite.
I:21067;463;He is flummoxed so both are offered to him!
I:21067;464;"Nash is his nemesis
I:21067;465;A memorable addition is the singing of Matt Munro's title song, as the film concludes in Venice.
I:21067;466;Thanks to Casino Royale I was able to get the family onboard.
I:21067;467;The first movie had a lot of nostalgia doing for it and the story within the story helped it feel more engrossing.
I:21067;468;Sound and Content are the best yet.
I:21067;469;This is by far a very amazing James Bond movie with Sean Connery delivers top notch preformance.
I:21067;470;The other actors did a great job also, what did it for me though was a very believable plotline, amazing shots of the countries they filmed in, and last the action scenes fight on the train, the gun fight within the Gypsy living area, and last the helicoper blow up scene very nice filming.
I:21067;471;But I agree with the bigger fans of Bond movies this is by far one of the best in the films and forever shall be a classic among the James Bond set.
I:21067;472;So if you like your classic spy films, great acting, and some very memoriable scenes of the sites around the country then pick this movie up and see for yourself how much and why this is forever one of the best Bond movies ever made.
I:21067;473;Connery is great, lots of location filming (compared to a lot of in.
I:21067;474;studio and background projection shots) and the plot is classic.
I:21067;475;I choose this rating because the movie is good.
I:21067;476;What I like about the movie is that Sean Connery returns as James Bond in this thrill.
I:21067;477;a. minute adventure featuring remarkable villains, beautiful women and exotic locales!
I:21067;478;What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it.
I:21067;479;I would recommend this movie to other people.
I:21067;480;I think this film captures the quintessential character of James Bond as envisioned by his creator, Ian Fleming.
I:21067;481;While later films would have the emphasis on explosions and chase sequences, this one gives one an insight into the world of spying and international intrigue.
I:21067;482;The film sets the pattern for big fight scenes (with the gypsy vs. Russian kill squad), boat chases, one.
I:21067;483;one fight scene (in the train), romancing the enemy girl (Bianchi) to good, the end.
I:21067;484;film attempt on Bond's life (by Lenya), Q's gadgets, and witty sayings.
I:21067;485;Danielle Bianchi, Lotte Lenya and Robert Shaw (an author at the time) deliver solid performances.
I:21067;486;This is a solid spy film!
I:21067;487;I simply want to cast my vote for From Russia With Love as the best Bond movie ever made.
I:21067;488;The plot is good, all of the characters are well developed and the dialouge great.
I:21067;489;As an owner of all of the Bond series and having watched each multiple times, this is my clear favorite.
I:21067;490;This was one of the best movies of the Ian Flemming books.
I:21067;491;They will send in a beautiful Russian agent, Tatiana (Diniela Blanchi) to get closer to James Bond.
I:21067;492;blofeld was played by Anthony Dawson and the voice was Eric Pohlmann.
I:21067;493;One month after filming was completed, he committed suicide June 18, 1963.
I:21067;494;"No doubt about it that ""From Russia With Love"" is a classic Bond film."
I:21067;495;"Although in my opinion it is not as good as it precessor ""Dr. no"", it is still an essential Bond film worth seeing and owning."
I:21067;496;From Russia With Love has a solid plot with several awesome action scenes such as Bond's famous fight on the orient express against Red Grant as well as the Helicopter pursuing 007 and the gypsy battle.
I:21067;497;the entire cast was excellent as each actor or actresses character was very colourful and had his or her own personality.
I:21067;498;Connery is wonderful as Bond as usual.
I:21067;499;daniela Bianchi plays the lovely Tatiana Romanova with beautiful innocence.
I:21067;500;All three of these characters are classic Bond villians.
I:21067;501;Pedro Armenderiz portrays Bond's comrade Kerim Bey wonderfully.
I:21067;502;"overall ""From Russia With Love"" is a classic Bond film that must be seen by all Bond fans."
I:21067;503;The plot is great, the action sequences are classic and the characters are well developed.
I:21067;504;One of the finest films in the series!
I:21067;505;This film has never looked so beautiful.
I:21067;506;ray edition is outstanding and plays perfectly on my PS3.
I:21067;507;In this installment, Bond is off to Istanbul to meet an absolutely stunning Soviet Intelligence officer who has promised to deliver a Lector decoding machine to him in exchange for helping her defect to the west.
I:21067;508;Unbeknownst to Bond and his lovely partner, the terrorist organization SPECTRE is manipulating them both.
I:21067;509;We have the first appearance of Q, the big introduction of the gadgets in the form of Bonds attach case, and the first pretitle sequence.
I:21067;510;top sense of fun that marked Goldfinger and the later Connery adventures.
I:21067;511;In addition to the film, we are given two first rate documentaries that give us the skinny about what went happened around the production.
I:21067;512;From Russia With Love is one of Sean Connery's best performances as the gentlemen's spy, James Bond.
I:21067;513;As the 2nd movie in this long running saga of fighting for good, it holds up to the test of time.
I:21067;514;Still one of my favorites even in comparison to today's 007 films.
I:21067;515;4.5 stars This was an amazing followup to Dr No.
I:21067;516;James gets killed in the beginning, goes to get a decoder, gets 2 gypsys and ends up on the great train ride.
I:21067;517;This was also a very good Fleming novel.
I:21067;518;I ordered this movie on the advice of my travel agent to get a sense of Istanbul, where I will be visiting next year.
I:21067;519;If you are going to Turkey, watch this movie.
I:21067;520;It is interesting that in this you see the love thing is nothing more then his duty for queen and country.
I:21067;521;Also a movie with a good deal talking about the spectre organization.
I:21067;522;"In the true spirit of ""Dr. No"", here we have a James Bond (Connery) who can handle himself very nicely in the mold of a true 1964 British agent."
I:21067;523;"This is the Bond we knew and loved, not the ""Casper Milktoast"" seen in ""Goldfinger""."
I:21067;524;But, by 1964 standards,at least he acts, he perfoms his best here.
I:21067;525;Thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it is a favorite.
I:21067;526;The soundtrack is also very good and adds to the excitement of the movie.
I:21067;527;This movie stands on the merits of it's plot and characters.
I:21067;528;FRWL has, if anything, a more.
I:21067;529;interesting and complex storyline than its predecessor, while retaining DR. NO's plot.
I:21067;530;"The tragic Pedro Armendariz plays one of the best ""helpful locals"" in the Bond series, the colourful Kerim Bey, ably holding our attention despite the presence of Sean Connery, who has developed his James Bond into a smoother, more charming and more relaxed agent
I:21067;531;fRWL is one of the best of the classic Bond movies, with an engaging story, interesting characters and locations, a solid orchestral soundtrack, and one of the best movie fistfights ever.
I:21067;532;AUSTIN POWERS fans will have an additional appreciation for this movie, as it introduces the S. p. e. c. t. r. e. characters who are so thoroughly spoofed in that series.
I:21067;533;documentary is, like the one on the earlier release, interesting and remarkably reserved for a chronicle of film history.
I:21067;534;"It focuses a great deal of attention on the complications involved with the production of FRWL, which were considerable, and that makes for a more exciting ""making of"" documentary than one might expect."
I:21067;535;So I can still vividly remember how iconoclastic, exciting, and ground.
I:21067;536;I actually like all the Bond movies, pretty much.
I:21067;537;He just discovered the most recent Flemming creations and I wanted him to have the Classics of the genre.
I:21067;538;The three are still perfect and carry the viewer into the scary and dangerous world of the British Secret Service with a Martini, shaken, not stirred.
I:21067;539;"From Russia With Love from 1963,the second James Bond adventure,(following ""Dr. No"" the previous year),was probably the best all around of the series."
I:21067;540;this was perhaps the most realistic recreation of all the Ian Fleming novels.
I:21067;541;lotte Lenya and Robert Shaw were very effective villians,John Barry composed a very good soundtrack,all under Terence Young's assured direction.
I:21067;542;"john Barry(Academy Award winner for ""Born Free"" in 1966 and ""Dances with Wolves"" in 1990),composed most of the film scores for the Bond series."
I:21067;543;"sean Connery said in an interview back in the mid '90's that he thought ""From Russia With Love"" was the best of all the James Bond films."
I:21067;544;This is the second of the bond films and it is as good as they get.
I:21067;545;Best of all, there is also the great Lotte Lenya with the deadliest shoes in the spy business.
I:21067;546;packed with a great cast, and I guess you could also call it a comedy.
I:21067;547;also, if you are interested in what Bond gadgets there will be in this movie, wait 'till you see them.
I:21067;548;Communicators, transmitters, shoe thorns, and the briefcase that Bond is given.
I:21067;549;"world"" details like this truly delight."
I:21067;550;Ninotchka here is split in two, into the lovely confused heroine Bond saves from Communism and her would.
I:21067;551;be sexual conquerer, the wonderful Lotte Lenya, who thinks nothing of sweeping up if it will get her at her man.
I:21067;552;This stylish second entry in the Bond franchise features a less cold.
I:21067;553;orchestrated chases and clashes, culminating in a heart.
I:21067;554;The kittenishly seductive Romanova is fetching as Bond's dicey love interest, but German chanteuse Lenya has the most fun springing poisonous blades from her shoes.
I:21067;555;"Racy, exhilarating, and loads of fun, ""Love"" breathes flashy new life into Ian Fleming's classic novel."
I:21067;556;In this movie, Connery proves it.
I:21067;557;He's cool, smart, every woman's dream, and smoothly deadly.
I:21067;558;The best of the series!
I:21067;559;Bond is really a macho man in this one.
I:21067;560;such a good movie,this was like watching it for the first time.
I:21067;561;Great, believeable action scenes and a good spy story power this film instead of special effects.
I:21067;562;Yes, looks do count, but the ability demonstrated by Ms. Bianchi really takes away from an otherwise classic Bond effort.
I:21067;563;I don't like the racism and sexism much, but the adventure is really the genuine article.
I:21067;564;"Of all Bond villains (especially the vastly overrated ""Jaws""), he's about the best."
I:21067;565;I loved this movie,I liked the breifcase and the part where Bond said She should have kept her mouth shut.
I:21067;566;It is indeed one of the best Bond films of all time.
I:21067;567;the plot a lone is just great.
I:21067;568;the great fight scene on the train is great, and of course Sean Connery is the best Bond of them all.
I:21067;569;He plays him very well, so smooth and suave, the way Bond should be.
I:21067;570;Not only would I call this Connery's best Bond, but I would also say it is one of the most exciting action films ever made.
I:21067;571;With an interesting yet simple plot it allows for much more character, character development and nail biting action to be added to the film.
I:21067;572;robert Shaw is brilliant in this, he plays an outstanding assassin.
I:21067;573;The train fight is probably my favorite of all time.
I:21067;574;Also Rosa Klebb and Tatiana both make great female characters.
I:21067;575;this one is really where Connery shines.
I:21067;576;It's almost as if Dr. No was really an experiment and they simply just got it right this time.
I:21067;577;This is one that you can watch over and over and still enjoy.
I:21067;578;Even though some scenes looks ackwards (present time versus the time it was filmed)it still brings the sweetness of the main title theme on the picture back ground song, itbrings back tender memories.
I:21067;579;I have come to the conclusion that this is the best of the Bond films.
I:21067;580;This and Dr. No are the most faithful to the novel series, and they also have the best production values.
I:21067;581;FRWL is the better of the two.
I:21067;582;I remember seeing this movie in the theaters it was so cool its still pretty cool, james bond the greatest spy and secret agent of all.
I:21067;583;Sean Connery is the Best Bond, anyone who has watched the whole series knows this.
I:21067;584;This is the ultimate Bond movie: a few gadgets, a lot of suave style and cool acting.
I:21067;585;NO Bond movie is better if you're looking for more than a few explosions, as it contains the intrigue, excitement, style and flair that all imitations wish they had.
I:21067;586;Some of the gadgets seem a little outdated, but the acting of Connery makes them great values.
I:21067;587;eon movies (Casino Royale 1967, Never Say Never Again) and From Russia with Love is the best!
I:21067;588;Daniela Bianchi is simply stunning in every scene she is in.
I:21067;589;Lotte Lenya plays a great villian as does Robert Shaw.
I:21067;590;From Russia with Love builds the characters so greatly that you simply don't know until the end.
I:21067;591;I bought it as a present for a die.
I:21067;592;This movie is a classic!
I:21067;593;Great leading lady in the form of Daniela Bianchi.
I:21067;594;Setting the bar for the essence of the Bond character that noone since has been able to match.
I:21067;595;I got it for my father and he is a James bond fan like me.
I:21067;596;daniel Craig's are also good and a necessary modernization of the franchise.
I:21067;597;so with seven of these Bond's you've got the best of OO7 for a whole lot less money.
I:21067;598;Brimming with tension, suspense, and understated cool, From Russia with Love is one of the very best movies in the entire James Bond series.
I:21067;599;The plot, which revolves around the criminal organization SPECTRE and its attempt to steal a Soviet codemaking machine by manipulating and ultimatley murdering a certain British secret agent (guess which one), is clever and engrossing.
I:21067;600;Part of the movie's charm comes from simply watching SPECTRE's plan unfold.
I:21067;601;The film is also incredibly atmospheric: Bond travels to a lush, decedant Istanbul before heading back west on a train trip that hangs heavy with mystery and paranoia.
I:21067;602;sean Connery is, of course, incredible.
I:21067;603;He's in complete command of the character, playing his role with absolute confidence, brimming with wit, charm, and ruthless intelligence.
I:21067;604;Connery's Bond is mesmerizing, his performance a masterpiece.
I:21067;605;The rest of the cast is fantastic as well: Lotte Lenya is unforgettable as the brutal Colonel Rosa Kleb, playing her part with relentless authority and barely subdued insanity.
I:21067;606;"Ditto for Robert Shaw, whose portrayal of ruthless assassain Donald ""Red"" Grant is fiery and intense."
I:21067;607;Pedro Armendariz is superb as the exuberant, friendly, and loveable Kerim Bey, who befriends and assists Bond in Istanbul.
I:21067;608;The film also contains the first appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as Q, one of the series' most beloved characters (he'd appear in every subsequent Bond film until 1999's The World is Not Enough).
I:21067;609;liners ever found in a Bond film and you've got an absolute classic, and one of the finest entries in an excellent series.
I:21067;610;"this James Bond film (also ""Dr. No"" and ""Goldfinger"") very realistically portrays a life."
I:21067;611;After these three films, the storyline get wild and the flicks move into the fantasy category.
I:21067;612;"i enjoy ""From Russia With Love"" every time I watch it."
I:21067;613;office wise it has to be THUNDERBALL) but for me, FRWL is it!
I:21067;614;"A terrific Fleming story, a great cast that includes Robert Shaw as the psychopathic Donald Grant (""The first one won't kill you."
I:21067;615;One of the best fight scenes in movies between Bond and Grant in a train car on the Orient Express.
I:21067;616;My dad loved this movie, and he wanted it for a very long time.
I:21067;617;he appreciated it deeply when he received it.
I:21067;618;In my mind From Russia With Love is the greatest bond film.
I:21067;619;it sticks to the novel relatively closely and is directed with panache by Terence Young.
I:21067;620;the action is thrilling, the performances pitch perfect and, thanks to this blu ray release, the film has never looked better.
I:21067;621;this is one upgrade I thoroughly recommend.
I:21067;622;"up movie to ""Dr. No"" introduced many of the recurring elements of the James Bond genre: Desmond Llewelyn as Q
I:21067;623;There is much more action, including a very believable fight scene on a train between Robert Shaw and Sean Connery.
I:21067;624;this Bond movie ranks as one of my favorites.
I:21067;625;The story is serious, with more tongue.
I:21067;626;okay, a quick list of other interesting things from this movie.
I:21067;627;There were a lot of vehicles, cars, boats, trains, and even a helicopter.
I:21067;628;The scenes under the Soviet embassy are very cool, particularly the scene with the rats.
I:21067;629;If you haven't seen Dr. No the references would be lost on you, but for avid Bond fans the references are fun.
I:21067;630;this movie is a classic in every sense.
I:21067;631;A classic 60s movie, a classic spy movie, a classic Sean Connery movie.
I:21067;632;No matter how many times you watch you see something new and interesting.
I:21067;633;"From Russia with Love, the second Bond film, is a favorite, second only to ""Goldfinger"" in my view, if only because it has absolutely no outrageous gimmickry, though I may be biased to ""Goldfinger"" because I spent many of my youthful days, on both sides of the filming at the Fontainebleau Hotel's pool and beach, thus the movie reflects those happy days, when getting on a plane was as easy as firing a Walther PPK."
I:21067;634;From Russia also has a gypsy cat fight and perhaps the best, most believable fight to the death in cinema, when Bond confronts Spectre's assassin (Robert Shaw).
I:21067;635;ray shows off Bond's impeccably tailored, Savile Row suits nicely, and the Dolby 5.1 transformation from the original mono track is also very well done.
I:21067;636;Worth the upgrade cost, the re.
I:21067;637;Now, with a far better movie assembled around him, he demonstrates just why he is still the best of the five actors to play James Bond.
I:21067;638;The action is some of Bond's best also, with a good brawl scene at a gypsy camp, a gripping hand.
I:21067;639;hand fight in a train, and an utterly magnificent boat chase at the end.
I:21067;640;I have seen all 007's movies many time and will do again.
I:21067;641;This, Bond classic comes the closest to being an actual spy movie as opposed to an action.
I:21067;642;adventure romp, as most of the other Bond films are.
I:21067;643;paced action and snappy dialogue make this one of the best of breed.
I:21067;644;Forever a classic in the Bond franchise.
I:21067;645;From Russia With Love ranks among the top three films in the durable James Bond series.
I:21067;646;As in many of the best films in the series, the tone is relatively serious.
I:21067;647;The story is believable and there is an atmosphere of genuine tension throughout the film.
I:21067;648;from Russia With Love's greatest strength is its superb cast.
I:21067;649;Sean Connery, in his second outing as Bond, is very good, handling both dialogue and action adeptly.
I:21067;650;Daniela Bianchi is a beautiful heroine, and her onscreen relationship with Bond is very plausible.
I:21067;651;it is a very enjoyable movie to view again and again.
I:21067;652;I watch it several times a year.
I:21067;653;Has all the thrills and cool travel experience.
I:21067;654;i love watching the james bond movies and collecting them and watching them during the winter to pass the time.
I:21067;655;This film`s got everything, great plot, cool charactors, etc.
I:21067;656;One of the best Bond films of all TIME!
I:21067;657;Both are great but the movie gives us a peak into the world of Bond in the sixties.
I:21067;658;"Indeed, ""From Russia with Love"" is the best of them all."
I:21067;659;It is a good and entertaining action film in itself, outside the 007 perimeter, and this is the one Sean Connery always said to have enjoyed the most making it !
I:21067;660;Ian Fleming's espionage story is good, and so is the film script.
I:21067;661;between, and brought closer to the locations where the action takes place.
I:21067;662;We have a sinister #1 whose face we bever see (the excellent voice of Harry Pohlmann), a master chess player by day and strategist of evil by night (played by Vladek Sheybal), a ferocious and believable high.
I:21067;663;kGB agent (played by Lotte Lenia), and an intelligent contract killer (played by Robert Shaw), all tag.
I:21067;664;1960 Miss Universe' Daniela Bianchi is so enjoyable to watch and does well as Tatiana Romanova.
I:21067;665;Good dialogues, characterization and Cold War is over, and the technology is far superior these days, but are these the elements by which we should judge a film, which after all, even if, in most instances, is supposed to just entertain us, is always expected to be a form of artistic expression.
I:21067;666;"37 year after its inception ""From Russia with Love"" stands apart both for its entertaining and artistic values."
I:21067;667;last but nor least, we have Sean Connery in top form, handsome, smiling, and above all, confident, sure of himself .
I:21067;668;and this, beyond any shade of a doubt ***is*** what makes a man sexy !
I:21067;669;Nice story with not too much advance technologies, just appropriate for the era.
I:21067;670;The film was well kept and not obvious defects despite this old.
I:21067;671;this one is a razzle dazzle Bond movie, the best of Connery's is my choice.
I:21067;672;the best bit is when bond fights Shaw on the train, you gotta love that moment and also when Bond is dodging helicopter bullets.
I:21067;673;fun all around and it kicks majot ass man.
I:21067;674;considered to be the best
I:21067;675;Several years ago I purchsed the entire set (18 movies at that time) of James Bond.
I:21067;676;I wish she could have seen it because she was a James bond fan.
I:21067;677;second movie in the bond series and a great movie.
I:21067;678;sean connery is so great as james bond.
I:21067;679;Overall, the story arc matches the book pretty well and it's a good watch.
I:21067;680;From Russia With Love, the second James Bond film, is one of the best (in my view, second only to Goldfinger).
I:21067;681;This is the most realistic of the Bond films with a story that could probably happen in the real world of espionage.
I:21067;682;terence Young, who also helmed Dr. No and Thunderball, does an outstanding job of directing.
I:21067;683;He makes wonderful use of the locations, especially in Istanbul.
I:21067;684;As with his other two Bond efforts, Young eschews a cartoon approach to the action in favor of a more brutal, realistic approach.
I:21067;685;And unlike many later Bond directors, Young concentrates on developing characters, making them real people with real emotions.
I:21067;686;The action scenes are tightly edited and the film's pacing and continuity are flawless.
I:21067;687;however, the best thing about the film is the casting.
I:21067;688;Sean Connery, of course, is, and always will be, the best James Bond.
I:21067;689;Newcomer Daniela Bianchi is terrific as pseudo defector Tatiana Romanova.
I:21067;690;She is beautiful, sexy and appealing.
I:21067;691;Robert Shaw (A Man for all Seasons, Black Sunday, Jaws) is chilling as SPECTRE assassin Red Grant.
I:21067;692;Aremedariz's performance is especially poignant because he was dying of cancer during the filming.
I:21067;693;from Russia With Love is not only a good Bond film, but a good film alone, apart from the series.
I:21067;694;The main documentary is especially interesting as it details how the filmmakers drastically changed the story progression during the shoot.
I:21067;695;"Following the successful introduction of Bond in ""Dr. No,"" ""From Russia With Love"" ups the ante in what in my opinion is one of the best movies of the series."
I:21067;696;"Fantastic locations, quick dialogue, and a maniacal plot collectively make this movie great, but it is the main villain, who is very much Bond's equal, that sets ""From Russia With Love"" apart from the others."
I:21067;697;mouse game with Bond's plan to steal the Lektor from the Russians.
I:21067;698;In the meantime, we are treated to some great side.
I:21067;699;"plot scenes involving Kerim Bey, one of Bond's best allies of the series
I:21067;700;Grant is a silent, highly trained killer, who works effectively and efficiently to lay the trap that Bond will inevitably fall into.
I:21067;701;"The foreboding glimpses of Grant hiding in the shadows or crouched behind a wall (acting as Bond's ""guardian angel"" as he sinisterly puts it) greatly add to the movie's suspense and build anticipation to when Bond and Grant finally meet in Zagreb."
I:21067;702;sean Connery is superb in what I believe is his best outing as Bond.
I:21067;703;"assuredness in Miss Moneypenny's office early on to his genuine terror after being bested by Grant in the latter half of the movie, Connery brings his best in ""From Russia With Love."""
I:21067;704;He truly epitomizes Bond in this movie.
I:21067;705;"from the opening teaser on SPECTRE Island (""Exactly 1 minute, 52 seconds, that's excellent"") and Kronsteen's chess match in Venice, to the memorable fight aboard the Orient Express, ""From Russia With Love"" is a fantastic movie with all the right elements."
I:21067;706;This film moves right along keeping you on your toes and guessing!
I:21067;707;This is an outstanding, if dated, movie.
I:21067;708;It was sexy and scandalous then.
I:21067;709;But the story is everything, and this is a great story.
I:21067;710;shot, and has one of the best fight sequences ever filmed.
I:21067;711;I highly recommend it and am proud to have it in my library.
I:21067;712;It is one of my go.
I:21067;713;to films for when I want to watch something I know to be worthwhile.
I:21067;714;they are, for the most part, pretty much as described in the text of the bookWe see the beginning of the later films' elaborately.
I:21067;715;"an excellent successor to ""Dr No"", and an eminently."
I:21067;716;watchable bridge to the form that the series would have when it hit its stride .
I:21067;717;Most fans of the Bond series and film critics usually say Goldfinger is the best Bond.
I:21067;718;Don't get me wrong I think Goldfinger is a great film but I rank it behind FRWL.
I:21067;719;This film has it all from start to finish.
I:21067;720;Action, Villains, A very sexy Bond girl, a dedicated ally, and Connery giving one liners and firmly establishing the legacy of Bond.
I:21067;721;The score is great, and the plot is believable (more so than Goldfinger).
I:21067;722;This film also gives us a first glimpse of Blofeld and the first of his plots that would become common in other Bond films.
I:21067;723;it was awesome for a 12 year old to see a film like that back then .
I:21067;724;After that, I eventually was able to see both Dr. No and From Russia With Love.
I:21067;725;it is simply staggeringly good with amazingly rich color.
I:21067;726;What I will concentrate on is this new Blu.
I:21067;727;def release is the best.
I:21067;728;especially if you are a Bond fan.
I:21067;729;It really is amazing and makes you appreciate the movie on a whole new level.
I:21067;730;with a nice DTS 5.1 soundtrack and a slew of extras, this will be a great addition to your Blu.
I:21067;731;Looking forward to the next one and adding to the rest to our movie library.
I:21067;732;It's amazing that the James Bond movie franchise is forty years old and still successful.
I:21067;733;"what makes this Bond movie exceptional is its diversion from the standard plot
I:21067;734;"top
I:21067;735;And, of course, the best of the Bonds, Sean Connery, is in this one as well.
I:21067;736;"goldfinger and Dr. No are also especially good Bond movies
I:21067;737;The plot is satisfyingly spy.
I:21067;738;organisation, is invented for 1960 political correctness sake.
I:21067;739;A then stellar cast, including the famous German cabaret star Lotte Lenya, playing Rosa Klebb, the villain who inspires the Connery quip `She's had her kicks', Daniella Bianchi who had just come runner up in Miss Universe, as well as two more beauty pageant contestants, who play the fighting gypsy girls.
I:21067;740;the action scenes are varied, and satisfyingly interspersed with a real story, not so far removed from Fleming's original.
I:21067;741;Mostly, it is Peter Hunt's fantastic editing that makes the scene, and indeed adds a sense of style to the entire movie.
I:21067;742;the extras include all that the special edition had, plus one or two new items.
I:21067;743;Sean Connery makes the film worthwhile.
I:21067;744;The product came in timely.
I:21067;745;It was in great condition.
I:21067;746;The packing for shipment was great for protection.
I:21067;747;It was a gift and I couldnt be happier.
I:21067;748;It is nice to order something.
I:21067;749;Utterly absurd and thoroughly enjoyable.
I:21067;750;Great action, scenery, and dialogue.
I:21067;751;A movie that looks like it was fun to make.
I:21067;752;The second Broccolli Bond and probably one of the best and most suspenseful in the franchise with Sean Connery as the cool.
I:21067;753;A great script directed by Terence Young brings us a no.
I:21067;754;Bond's efforts are hampered by a gorgeous KGB double.
I:21067;755;a great Bond with true intrigue one would expect from a spy film.
I:21067;756;top action sequences that became so prevalent in the later films.
I:21067;757;A great film to own!
I:21067;758;this movie is one of the best in the series.
I:21067;759;purpose briefcase is believable, unlike most of the gadgets from the Moore era, and only adds to the classic feel that this film carries.
I:21067;760;fashioned espionage tale, From Russia With Love scores very highly.
I:21067;761;My top 8 Bond films are: 1.
I:21067;762;Now what you'll notice about most of the films in that list is, that they contain solid action sequences that stick with what the plot dictates.
I:21067;763;He produces genuine menace, and, unlike Jaws and Oddjob, does not possess any special weapon, he's just a hard.
I:21067;764;In summary, From Russia With Love is a great espionage tale, even if it lags behind some of the more spectacular 007 flicks.
I:21067;765;That quote is from the best villian in any Bond movie.
I:21067;766;He's Robert Shaw and tells Bond that the first bullets from his gun won't kill him until he begs to be put out of his misery.
I:21067;767;Along with Shaw is Lotte Lenya who is the best villianess in the series.
I:21067;768;So with just those two characters, the film gets a high mark, not to mention a young Sean Connery playing it straight and carrying a brief case full of gadgets.
I:21067;769;The tension in this film builds and then explode with a sting of four unique action pieces.
I:21067;770;"The villiness ""gets her kicks"" and so will you."
I:21067;771;this film ranks #2 on my top Bond film lists (after OHMSS)so that should tell you what I think of it.
I:21067;772;If you want to see the best Bond actor in a serious Bond film, see this one.
I:21067;773;It's also the best film to introduce someone to James Bond.
I:21067;774;The best book in the series and arguably the best Bond film.
I:21067;775;Just watched it again and loved it for all the same reasons.
I:21067;776;From Russia With Love, has the feel of Dr. No with an extended color palette, exotic locations, an interesting villain in strong man 'Grant' played by Robert Shaw, who is great in a suspenseful train scene.
I:21067;777;I like the pacing of the action and Connery is in fine form.
I:21067;778;This film gives us an idea where the Bond films are headed and it's an exciting ride.
I:21067;779;Truely one of the best of the series.
I:21067;780;This is the second of the Bond movies, Sean Connery and Terrance Young do a wonderful job of expanding the Bond character.
I:21067;781;This movie contains the first appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as the ever popular Q with the first in a long line of secret gadgets.
I:21067;782;It also has deliciously evil villans, gorgeous women, great action, and most importantly the most believable plot of any of the Bond movies.
I:21067;783;John Barry's second score of the series is very enjoyable and introduces the popular 007 Theme (played during the fight at the gypsy camp and Bond's escape with the Lector).
I:21067;784;Here moviegoers get their first inside look at SPECTRE and the extend of their considerable resources and organization.
I:21067;785;The plan hatched SPECTRE is bold, to have James Bond with the help of a defecting Russian cipher clerk stationed in Istanbul, Turkey, steal a top secret encoding machine from the Soviet embassy from there, kill him and the clerk, and sell the machine back to the Soviets.
I:21067;786;Klebb is overseeing the execution of SPECTRE's operation while trained assasin Red Grant (well acted by Robert Shaw) makes sure the operation stays on track, even if he must eliminate a few bystanders.
I:21067;787;the screenplay is well written and contains several good subplots including a visit to a Gypsy camp and the vendetta between Kerim Bey (played with great aplomb by Pedro Armendariz), Bond's contact in Istanbul and a Bulgarian assasin.
I:21067;788;The screenplay also provides an excellent primer on SPECTRE which appears in one form or another in six of the first seven Bond films.
I:21067;789;tech, Bond must rely mainly on his wits to survive.
I:21067;790;Connery again gives an outstanding performance as the elegant but lethal James Bond.
I:21067;791;Robert Shaw exudes an incredible air of menace in his protrayal of Red Grant.
I:21067;792;The fight scene between Bond and Grant is one of the best of the entire series.
I:21067;793;For this reason alone, many feel that From Russia With Love remains the one of the best if not the best in the series.
I:21067;794;Whether you are a Bond fan or just enjoy a good spy movie, make sure you put From Russia With Love into your movie collection.
I:21067;795;There is even one scene in the widescreen version where the sky has a green spot on it!
I:21067;796;"This was actually the next to the last ""novelistic"" Bond movie."
I:21067;797;"Goldfinger was the last, and, oddly enough, started the overproduction juggernaut that would eventually kill the ""cool spy"" genre in movies."
I:21067;798;"Bond, driven mainly by ""Goldfinger""'s incredible combination of music, acting, gadgets, outsized goals of the villains and Connery's charm as the hero, sparked more imitators than just about any other franchise you can name, before or since."
I:21067;799;"I say ""mainly"", because ""FRWL"" also had a lot of charm."
I:21067;800;the first three films were 1) More realistic 2) More involving 3) More cerebral, and this one is a prime example.
I:21067;801;FRWL starts out all business and is a mix of humor AND business from the word go.
I:21067;802;M calls Bond via old radiophone while the randy field agent romances Sylvia Trench lakeside somewhere in the country.
I:21067;803;Through a gypsy village, making love with a woman while being videotaped, and manages to outsmart an almost insane assasin, Connery is very believable as Bond.
I:21067;804;Of all of the movies I've seen (which isn't exactly all of them) this one is one of the best, right up there with Goldfinger.
I:21067;805;Great to see some of these older 007 films available on Amazon Prime.
I:21067;806;FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is a gem of an action film.
I:21067;807;The movie is set pretty much in a realistic fashion.
I:21067;808;And FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE represents the best of a bygone era of filmaking.
I:21067;809;Complete with great scenarios, excellent compelling action, magnifincetly colored scenery, sexy women, and great, but believable gadgets, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE delivers with a lot of gisto.
I:21067;810;The James Bond series of films has, over the last 40.
I:21067;811;odd years, been a great highlight of cinema's spy genre.
I:21067;812;"after a somewhat slow start in ""Dr. No"", ""From Russia With Love"" propelled Bond and Connery forward to a new height ."
I:21067;813;and even better was to come.
I:21067;814;From Russia was more of what we came to expect from Bond films, with 007 travelling from one interesting locale to another.
I:21067;815;From Russia boasts (as came to be usual) an excellent cast .
I:21067;816;the casting of Lotte Lenya is the most creative casting move undertaken in this film.
I:21067;817;In the late '20s and very early '30s, she was one of the great lights of the Berlin stage, for whom Kurt Weill wrote many roles specifically.
I:21067;818;"Lenya's performance in ""From Russia"" adds real gravitas and a palpable sense of menace to the film."
I:21067;819;"if you check the Amazon review of this film, you may notice that in it Lotte Lenya is referred to as a ""lovely assassin""."
I:21067;820;Her face was perfect for the role, lovely in the sense of Margaret Hamilton or a pre.
I:21067;821;Can you imagine a blonde bombshell chasing 007 around with dagger.
I:21067;822;Well, maybe if you want comic relief.
I:21067;823;"As it is, a ""lovely"" Lotte is hilarious enough."
I:21067;824;"I love the movie ""From Russia with Love""."
I:21067;825;In fact, I doubted it could be visually improved upon.
I:21067;826;ray edition is so good that it's like watching a brand new movie.
I:21067;827;"Watching it with my family I repeatedly heard the comment ""wow."
I:21067;828;"I never noticed that before . . ."" The studio did a first rate job of restoring the movie for the Blu."
I:21067;829;And, after all . . . it's a James Bond film.
I:21067;830;"ray Bond films
I:21067;831;The 2nd book based on a novel by Ian Fleming, this is also a great Sean Connery 007 film.
I:21067;832;At the same time, he loves a sexy russian woman known as Tatiana Romanova.
I:21067;833;tHOUGHTS: What a worthy sequel!
I:21067;834;This is better than Dr. No in my opinion, and has much more intense action scenes, more beautiful women, and edgier humor.
I:21067;835;In FRWL we see James Bond emerging as the action hero that he will always been seen as in years to come.
I:21067;836;"You cannot beat the scenes where he is chased by the helicopter or the speed boat chase in the end
I:21067;837;Another reason this film stands above the rest is that Shaw plays his role as henchmen/assasin Grant perfectly with a blend of malice, intelligence, mystery, and sophistication.
I:21067;838;making him one of the most competent and threatening Bond villains of all time.
I:21067;839;but overall a great Bond film!
I:21067;840;Fun to watch the young Sean Connery and Robert Shaw, though.
I:21067;841;Lots of intrigue and lots of action in this 007 spy.
I:21067;842;Connery is a hit again as 007 the spy who's a hit with the ladies, and a pain in the neck to the bad guys.
I:21067;843;tension builds nicely until,what's this?
I:21067;844;at this point the credits start to roll with the wonderful theme music, but no vocals.
I:21067;845;"in this one we see more girls'distinct and showing more flesh
I:21067;846;the film opens in Venice,Italy where a chess championship is taking place between a Canadian and Czech player(Ironically the movie goes full circle as it ends up back here in the end).
I:21067;847;"bond gets his usual ""M"" briefing before heading out on his assignment and we are introduced to one ""Boothroyd"" played by Desmond Llewllyn."
I:21067;848;bond heads off to Istanbul to meet one Kareem Bey played wonderfully by Pedro Armendariz,his contact there.
I:21067;849;kareem is a very influential man.
I:21067;850;"bond meets up with Tatiana as planned and they both ""steal"" the Lektor."
I:21067;851;kareem arranges a trip through the eastern block on a train to get Bond,the girl and the machine spirited to the west.
I:21067;852;along the way much intrigue and fighting ensues.
I:21067;853;of course Grant's real identity is eventually revealed and after a harrowing struggle Bond narrowly escapes certain death.
I:21067;854;farther on Bond and Tatiana,who by now is in love with Bond(naturally!)
I:21067;855;,disembark the train and overpower Grant's contact and steal his truck.
I:21067;856;he eventually brings it down and they head to the coast.
I:21067;857;for space sake I can only give you small details of course.
I:21067;858;it is a very action packed and charged movie that constantly thrives to keep the tension going throughout.
I:21067;859;a nice touch in that respect was the Robert Shaw character who is that constant and nagging unseen(by Bond)threat.
I:21067;860;"so even though,in my oppinion,not up to the level of its' predecessor ""To Russia with Love"" is still a very entertaining flick which you will still enjoy."
I:21067;861;and this new remastered edition is a delight to the eyes and ears.
I:21067;862;But also with wit, style, grace, grit.
I:21067;863;More engaging, less earnest than contemporary versions.
I:21067;864;Item sent in a timely manner.
I:21067;865;and the price is right.
I:21067;866;Most James Bond fans have their personal favorites among all the films in this forty.year series: FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is mine.
I:21067;867;In many ways, this was actually the first film with the full James Bond formula in tact.
I:21067;868;In FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, Bond departed from the character in the novels, and became witty, ironic, and very much tongue.
I:21067;869;The story is a great improvement as well.
I:21067;870;the setting for the film, Istanbul, is one of the best in the entire series.
I:21067;871;It perfect set the international tone for all subsequent Bond films.
I:21067;872;The city is used as a perfect backdrop for much of the film.
I:21067;873;Among all the other distinctions of this film, it also belongs on the short list of the great train films, with much of the film taking place on the train that travels along the route of the former Orient Express.
I:21067;874;The only film that I think rivals this one in the James Bond series is the immediate sequel, GOLDFINGER, which is my second favorite Bond film.
I:21067;875;"by the way, this is one of the few films in which Bond does NOT say, ""Bond, James Bond."""
I:21067;876;One of the better Bond movies.
I:21067;877;But still and all, it is exciting and well done and is one of my favorite movies in my Kendle file.
I:21067;878;Sean Connery's second portrayal of the Secret Agent 007 is right on target.
I:21067;879;libertine is always ready to seduce a pretty spy for his country.
I:21067;880;Luckily Tatiana knows which side to stand.
I:21067;881;the charming Daniela Bianchi is Tatiana Romanova, a young Greta Garbo.
I:21067;882;She also ignores that behind the mirror above the king sized bed, Spectre agents are secretly filming her love making with Bond from a cabinet de voyeur.
I:21067;883;in his final appearance, Pedro Armendariz plays Bond's most memorable Turkish Ally, the delightful Ali Kerim Bey, head of Station T, in Turkey.
I:21067;884;Kerim Bey is the perfect combination of aggression and intelligence.
I:21067;885;(Dying of cancer and hospitalized in Los Angeles, this great Mexican actor, took a pistol from under his pillow and shot himself.)
I:21067;886;This repugnant lady recruits the good.
I:21067;887;He is, perhaps, the most memorable assassin who succeeds in making Bond kneel.
I:21067;888;vladek Sheybal plays the master planner, Spectre top operative on the mission, number five, Kronsteen.
I:21067;889;"He is a chess master known as the ""Wizard of Ice."""
I:21067;890;The way he is dealt with is very original.
I:21067;891;"From Russia with Love introduces ""Q"" to the series."
I:21067;892;From Russia with Love is a splendidly entertaining film against exotic Istanbul and Venice backgrounds.
I:21067;893;This is one of the finest James Bond stories and films, and possibly *the* finest.
I:21067;894;this is a wonderful film.
I:21067;895;A beautiful Soviet cipher expert agrees to defect with a valuable code.
I:21067;896;paced, engaging, and classy film that will hold the viewer's interest.
I:21067;897;as always, Sean Connery is perfect as agent 007, and carries off the role with class and elan.
I:21067;898;This is my favorite Bond movie.
I:21067;899;It's got everything you expect from a classic Bond film.
I:21067;900;It's got sexy women, great dialouge, great action, and a great fight scene between Sean Connery as bond and Robert Shaw as Red Grant.
I:21067;901;This is the role that Connery was born to play.
I:21067;902;level worker at the Russian embassy, but one with access to a much.
I:21067;903;everybody loves this Bond which has the charm of the rest of the series without the camp value (fewer gadgets, more narrow escapes).
I:21067;904;Actually, it's better than it has a right to be .
I:21067;905;Kerim Bey is actually one of the best supporting characters in the series, which only makes his end seem that much more painful.
I:21067;906;that said, the flick excels as a great, and explains why nobody ever has managed to pull off an intelligent Bond parody .
I:21067;907;Russia manages the task with more bite than anybody is willing to admit.
I:21067;908;The flick masterfully sends up Bond .
I:21067;909;"Toss in the ""Orient Express"" and the catacombs of Constantinople, and ""Russia"" earns its spot at the top of Bond lists."
I:21067;910;The veneer of sophistication over his violence never gets old and is so well done.
I:21067;911;all incredible examples of early Bond films that contributed to the distinct style that still exists today.
I:21067;912;This was the One Bond film for all ages.
I:21067;913;Complete with action, love, humor, villans, and gadgets, this was a success for Bonds.
I:21067;914;From Russia with Love certainly deserves the rank after Goldfinger and Thunderball as it's One of the Very Best Bond Movies.
I:21067;915;Most part of it remained true to the Novel which was very pleasant to watch.
I:21067;916;Q was introduced in this Movie and Connery really does some of his best work of his Bond ever.
I:21067;917;Robert shaw displays the perfect shades of the cunning character of Red Grant.
I:21067;918;The Briefcase remains the most memorable gadget ever used in a Bond Movie.
I:21067;919;The plot is perfect and the most enjoyable scene is the Fight between Bond and Red Grant aboard the Orient Express.
I:21067;920;I'd highly recommend this Movie to everyone and any Bond Fan should not miss this one at any cost.
I:21067;921;The Movie is worth the Price.
I:21067;922;Because there is more dialogue it helps to own this movie so you can watch it again.
I:21067;923;cold assassin Red Grant (Robert Shaw), and one of the best bond girls ever ('James, will you make love to make all the time in England?')
I:21067;924;Pedro Armend riz fits the role of 007's ally Kerim Bey very nicely.
I:21067;925;The real action is between the characters and within the story.
I:21067;926;This is actually one of the best Bond films.
I:21067;927;The actors, story, and music are great.
I:21067;928;I bought it and enjoy it.
I:21067;929;The plot is easy to follow, acting is solid, and the results smashing and satisfying!
I:21067;930;From Russia With Love may be the best of all the James Bond flicks.
I:21067;931;The plot is that SPECTRE is bent on getting the LEKTOR, a top.
I:21067;932;sean Connery is in top form as the dashing British agent OO7, and few Bond girls are better than Daniela Binachi's Tatiana Romanavo.
I:21067;933;Robert Shaw and Lotte Lenya are superb villains, especially Shaw as Rosa Klebb and Donald Red Grant.
I:21067;934;Kerim Bey is wonderful as Pedro Armendariz.
I:21067;935;The action includes OO7 being chased by a helicopter, the famed gypsy camp scene, an incredible and long hand.
I:21067;936;hand fight aboard the Orient Express between Connery and Shaw, and a good boat chase near the end.
I:21067;937;The script is very good, the cinematography is dark and brooding, and the settings are nice.
I:21067;938;All of Sean Connery's James Bond movies are enjoyable and this one did not disappoint.
I:21067;939;From Russia with Love has become my favorite Bond movie.
I:21067;940;It has a great plot, wonderful locations, and none of the over the top gadgets that show up in the later movies.
I:21067;941;Another great 007 flick, with Sean Connery.
I:21067;942;Great plot, great villians, great gadgets, and beautiul women.
I:21067;943;Another ageless film I could watch year after year.
I:21067;944;A good movie with Dr. no ranking up some good reviews.
I:21067;945;From Russia With Love got a lot of good reveiws.
I:21067;946;Any how you'll love this movie all the way to Russia!
I:21067;947;"Bonds come and go, but ""From Russia With Love"" (1963) is a screen classic in its own right."
I:21067;948;Terence Young directs this Ian Fleming adaptation with a firm hand.
I:21067;949;From Russia With Love remains Connery's favorite Bond film . . . and it's easy to see why.
I:21067;950;This is one of my favorite Bond films.
I:21067;951;A must have for true Bond fans and very enjoyable for the regular movie watcher.
I:21067;952;Great cast, story line, plot and perfect length keeps the viewer interested right to the end credits.
I:21067;953;From Russia With Love is one of the best, scratch that, is the best Bond film.
I:21067;954;The plot is extremely intelligent, and the suspense is killer.
I:21067;955;Robert Shaw is my favorite henchman of all, and the fight between him and Connery makes you wince as if you just got hit.
I:21067;956;If you like Bond, watch the others for enjoyment, but watch From Russia With Love for an intelligent action film.
I:21067;957;anyhow, From Russia with Love is in my opinion the best outing of Bond to this date.
I:21067;958;unlike the future Bond film that relied more on gadgets, implausible plots, and secret lairs that are so huge that I just can think how the villain got this all done in such short period of time.
I:21067;959;"The movie has the most memorable fight scene in cinema history
I:21067;960;This way the Russians and British will be fighting and doubting each other.
I:21067;961;It's not very complex, but it works extremely well as a spy/action movie, there is really no fantasy here, everything is believable.
I:21067;962;It's Bond from back when Bond was the real thing.
I:21067;963;I chose to give 5 stars because I am a true and loyal fan of Sean Connery.
I:21067;964;I think he is a really wonderful human being and I love his personality and acting.
I:21067;965;To me, he always was and always will be the best JAMES BOND.
I:21067;966;It's beautiful theme song, brilliant story line and superb acting from Sean Connery make it a 'must have' .
I:21067;967;This 1963 Bond movie is one of the best ever made.
I:21067;968;Sean Connery is at his most charismatic in this movie.
I:21067;969;He is supported wonderfully by Robert Shaw as the hitman 'Red' Grant.
I:21067;970;this is a James Bond before huge elborate sets, special cars and extravagant budgets, and its all the better for it.
I:21067;971;I think this is my favorite Bond movie of them all, and I'm not exactly sure why.
I:21067;972;I think it's because it's one of the earlier Bond movies, but also one of the more polished ones.
I:21067;973;one of the things I liked is the gadgets Bond is given.
I:21067;974;It's the first movie with them, and it fits well, a briefcase with tear gas, ammunition, sniper rifle, and some gold coins.
I:21067;975;the scenes aboard the Orient Express, over the hills with the helicopter and the boast scenes are nice, they give just the right amount of fighting and suspense to the movie without being completely over the top.
I:21067;976;The Orient Express scene is nicely done, the fighting between Bond and the SPECTRE agent looks violent and real, not like some fighting from that time.
I:21067;977;Both the Helicopter scene and the boat scenes have great explosions, lots of fire and flying things.
I:21067;978;overall I thought this was a really good Bond movie, it captures the essence of the secret agent without being cheesy or going over the top.
I:21067;979;I was very happy with the delivery time on this movie.
I:21067;980;I am very happy with my first experience using Amazon.
I:21067;981;Lotte Lenya is chillingly creepy as Rosa Krebs, one of the greatest Bond villains ever.
I:21067;982;And Robert Shaw is magnificent as the bull.
I:21067;983;His fight with Connery in the train is maybe the most thrilling unarmed fight scene I have ever seen in a movie (okay, except for Bruce).
I:21067;984;Fans of the novels will tell you that the Bond there is more gritty and down to earth.
I:21067;985;The film makers simply wanted to create bigger stories with a larger than life Bond that was more inspired by the books than based on them.
I:21067;986;Perhaps it is because the best of the films try to expand the character rather than remake him.
I:21067;987;From Russia with Love is the closest adaptation from any of the books and my favorite of the Connery films.
I:21067;988;Goldfinger is the definitive Bond film and set the archtype for the films to follow but this movie was the closest to the novels that I love.
I:21067;989;For Your Eyes Only and Octopussy made great use of the short stories but here is the best use of the full novels.
I:21067;990;girl type crush on the handsome, charismatic and worldly Bond.
I:21067;991;Besides, the female villian is shown to be smart, capable and very deadly.
I:21067;992;It is an exciting movie that shows the best of Fleming's work and that of the film series.

I:21067;996;sean Connery brings his characteristic savoir fare to the movie.
I:21067;997;This movie has been digitally restored and I'm sure the picture is just as good (if not better!!)
I:21067;998;There is also superior sound.
I:21067;999;As well, there is one extra in the form of an audio commentary.
I:21067;1000;In conclusion, this is one of the best Bond movies ever made and was Sean Connery's favourite.
I:21067;1001;It was so good that a video adaptation of it was made!!!
I:21067;1002;The best James Bond of the Sean Connery era.
I:21067;1003;The Q branch tech is spot on and the story is nearly woven.
I:21067;1004;When viewing these films by how closely they translated the character of James Bond to the screen, this film is clearly the best of the entire 20+ film series.
I:21067;1005;Rich, complex, and full of suprises, the story is the best feature to this Bond gem.
I:21067;1006;creating a tense and involving story that can be enjoyed and appreciated by today's audiences as much as it was during its first run!This film also introduced us to the character of Q, played by Desmond Llewelyn.

I:21067;1009;It is in this 1963 classic that Connery sets the bar for how to play James Bond with flying colors.

I:21067;1018;I love 007 movies especially the ones with Sean Connery.

I:21067;1021;It is a bit outdated for an action movie but still enjoyable if you are a classic Bond film fan.

I:21067;1025;this is one great looking picture.
I:21067;1026;The images are sharp and the sound (once mono) is boosted to surround.
I:21067;1027;Over the course of time this has slowly became the best Bond in my opinion.
I:21067;1028;It has a very serious tone that many Bond films lack greatly, has Connerys best performance, best acting out of the entire series, and has aged well.
I:21067;1029;Their really isnt another Bond film quite like this one.
I:21067;1030;From Russia With Love has one of the greatest fight scenes ever filmed.
I:21067;1031;The fight on the train with Bond and Grant is realistic and truly visually amazing even now.
I:21067;1032;Connery may not be my favorite Bond, but he is always going to be the most classy.
I:21067;1033;That fact certainly shows here.
I:21067;1034;His acting and overall performance is better here than even in Goldfinger or Thunderball.
I:21067;1035;Its also takes a great Bond girl to make the film a classic.
I:21067;1036;Daniela Bianchi is stunning and just hot as hell.
I:21067;1037;Creating one of the best Bond films of them all.
I:21067;1038;I enjoyed this movie in 1968 and it is just as good.
I:21067;1039;Sean Connery will always be the best James Bond.

I:21067;1046;together film which remains my favorite in the series.
I:21067;1047;From Russia with Love is Connery's second go at playing James Bond, and in my opinion the best movie in the entire series.
I:21067;1048;foreign locations, beautiful women, a great villain, and lots of thrills and suspense.
I:21067;1049;"As with most Bond films the story isn't the high point
I:21067;1050;when it comes to the actual cinematography and action sequences, From Russia With Love kicks it up a notch from Dr. No.
I:21067;1051;In other words, the action is top notch, you'll hold your breath plenty of times, and as I'm sure you're aware, the women and more.
I:21067;1052;intimate scenes are some of the more shocking from its time.

I:21067;1059;It's the ultimate Bond experience, and a release anyone who worked on the film should be proud of.
I:21067;1060;From Russia With Love is the finest example of one of those films.
I:21067;1061;That film would introduce the bizarre villians, terrific action, comic suprises and become a worldwide phenomenon.
I:21067;1062;What is interesting about From Russia.
I:21067;1063;is that it too has bizarre villians, terrific action and comic moments but it is definitely removed from the 007 film stereotype.
I:21067;1064;Connery's performance here shows a character that is charming and intelligent but also a lethal and cunning weapon who will kill for queen and country if needs be.
I:21067;1065;He's exactly what a double 0 agent should be.
I:21067;1066;this film also benefits from a strange romantic twist.
I:21067;1067;He has a romance here that is one of the more personal in his spy career, as he allows himself to be deeply attracted to a beautiful Soviet officer.
I:21067;1068;along with a strong suspense story and an affecting romance, From Russia.
I:21067;1069;also sports some of the greatest action pieces in the 007 series as well as what may be one of the most tense showdowns between between two characters in film history.
I:21067;1070;That showdown is between Bond and the late Robert Shaw's character aboard the tight quarters of the Orient Express.
I:21067;1071;everyone has their favorite Bond actor and Bond film.
I:21067;1072;"It is the film that remembers well of the genre which Bond was born from
I:21067;1073;This is the most faithful adaption of an Ian Fleming novel and the most solid spy film, story.
I:21067;1074;The directing, acting, locations all work.
I:21067;1075;it's not just a great James Bond movie, it's an excellent thriller of spy wars in the 1960s.
I:21067;1076;robert Shaw, whose other great role was Quint the shark killer from JAWS, is strong and believable as the psychotic agent killer stalking Bond.
I:21067;1077;This is such a good movie.
I:21067;1078;The fight between Red Grant and James Bond is one of the best hand to hand combat scene of any movie, maybe even the best.
I:21067;1079;It has a cool boat chase and a great girl.
I:21067;1080;We are really enjoying watching these classics and seeing them as the precursors to the action/spy thrillers we have today
I:21067;1081;I liked the 60's look.
I:21067;1082;The history of James Bond and the country's and cultures they visit.

I:21067;1085;the gadgets that were to eventually get so out of hand make their first appearance in the form of Bond's ingenious attach case, but at least here they are still entirely credible .
I:21067;1086;"Red wine with fish, that should have told me something, he tells Robert Shaw's working class homicidal paranoiac, the best and most genuinely threatening of the Bond heavies (""You may know the right wines, but you're the one on your knees."")"
I:21067;1087;it's still the best of the series and most convincingly plotted, an excellent crane shot of the chequered setting for a chess tournament sets the scene for the chess.
I:21067;1088;Indeed, directorially this is considerably more ambitious and assured than its predecessor, evident in the skilfully handled church scene and a beautifully blocked scene as Bond is followed along a train platform by Shaw inside the train.
I:21067;1089;As with Dr No there's not a huge amount of new extra material over the extras from previous release, all of which are carried over here, but it's pretty good .
I:21067;1090;From russia with love is the best bond film ever and ever will be.
I:21067;1091;John Barrys score is one of the best and Terence Young gives his best direction in a bond film.
I:21067;1092;The gypsy scene is top as well as the shooting in the ladys mouth as Pedro gets even.
I:21067;1093;The train fight scene with Connery and Shaw is the best scene of the whole series and Shaw at the films teaser at the beginning is remarkable.
I:21067;1094;Even Pedros ladyfriend who returns in goldfinger in another role is to be watched, her outfit and bed settings, colors are very nice and to be admired in the films selection of great taste.
I:21067;1095;I still watch all the films.
I:21067;1096;ray.You can get a great bargain if your a savvy shopper.
I:21067;1097;No matter how many times I watch this movie and I enjoy it every single time.
I:21067;1098;An oldie but a goodie!
I:21067;1099;This is the best of the Bond collection which is based on Ian Fleming's original with the add on of Spectra.
I:21067;1100;The movie keeps you on with love, sex, tricks, secret weapons.
I:21067;1101;The section that he keeps Bond on his knee while preparing his gun with silencer is real life.
I:21067;1102;The conversation is civil and credible.
I:21067;1103;The tear gas explosion and subsequent fighting under a blue light created a tense mood.
I:21067;1104;with British humor of smoke and fire, Bond escaped with the wit of being a secret agent.
I:21067;1105;Sean makes Bond alive and real with the right balance of being a British gentleman, not an American playboy later by Roger Moore.
I:21067;1106;this movie keeps the James Bond thrills on till the end.
I:21067;1107;The theme song by Matt Monroe is wonderful.
I:21067;1108;This is the best James Bond classic which entertains in sight and sound.
I:21067;1109;"One of the best Connery Bond films along with ""Goldfinger"", ""From Russia with Love"" focuses more on story and less on the gadgets that came to dominate the Bond films."
I:21067;1110;Fox and MGM (Fox is now marketing MGM/UA films even though MGM is owned by Sony)have done a good job of upgrading this classic film.
I:21067;1111;Skin tones look quite good throughout.
I:21067;1112;Trailers, radio, TV spots are also included.
I:21067;1113;"There is also a nice featurette on co. producer Harry Saltzman and image datatbase and an interactive ""007 Mission Control"" into the world of ""From Russia with Love""."
I:21067;1114;Richard Maiubaum's screenplay is top notch taking the elements of Ian Fleming's novel and brilliantly using them in the context of the film.
I:21067;1115;Bond's got competition for the device.
I:21067;1116;The fight sequence at the conclusion of the film between Connery and Shaw is terrific.5 stars for the film, 5 stars for the digital clean up, 4 stars for the digital clean up/transfer (could have been 5 with stronger colors).
I:21067;1117;"The second Bond adventure is considered by many to be the best (Though ""Goldfinger"" and ""Dr. No"" are excellent as well)."
I:21067;1118;The crime group SPECTRE also wants it.
I:21067;1119;Nevertheless, it's pure entertainment all the way.
I:21067;1120;The fight scene on the train is one of the best action sequences ever filmed for a Bond film or any other in its time.
I:21067;1121;Sean Connery is at his rugged best.
I:21067;1122;I can remember how shocked I was at the beginning of this film when I first saw it in the theaters .
I:21067;1123;shocked that a SPECTRE agent had so easily vanquished my idol, the great James Bond.
I:21067;1124;Of course, this deceitful illusion is soon clarified and we get to see Mr. Connery at his swashbuckling best!
I:21067;1125;Great film from start to finish!
