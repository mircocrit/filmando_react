1;Everyone speaks with an American accent.
2;Great customer service, as per usual.
3;draw the loathing of others, as a last and unique gesture of compassion.
4;There is another beautiful girl, who chooses to keep running, like burning time will give you a lighter pain.
5;There is a friend, with strong attitude and confidence, but his non.
6;it is one of the rare movies that strongly motivate you, get you scared of what could happen or confidence that you are doing well .
7;Yes, Polanski had sex with an underage girl, however the underage girl and the mother have always maintained that the sex was consensual and therefore Polanski while being a pedophile(not pedephile) is not a rapist.
8;That being said, this is one of the greatest films to ever be produced.
9;I saw it only once in 1978 and I am still telling people that they need to see it.
10;this is the 2nd Roman Polanski film ive seen so far and I think I enjoyed this film even more than Rosemary's Baby.
11;Its truly an eerie creepy slow moving film.
12;Ive seen many movies and this is unlike any other ive ever seen.
13;It not only has the suspense and story which pulls you in deeper as the story progresses but it also has plenty of black humor to it.
14;I laughed out loud in a couple scenes.
15;There is so much more to this film than meets the eye, ideas to contemplate, etc.
16;After i watched it and it sunk in over the days i was thinking , this is truly a great film.
17;almost like those good pizza places that deliver in under 30 minutes!
18;this one worked out excellent
19;the beauty here is that the film never allows the audience know what is real and what is concocted until its climax that, at first, resembles a comedy of errors, but develops into an incredily eerie disposition.
20;"just wanted to add the Japanese movie ""Pulse"" has a similiar theme."
21;"actually, if you want the full Egyptian workout, see ""Cure"" and then ""Charisma""pps."
22;"i just love the reviewer who says ""I've been to Paris ."
23;I was excited to see this film as I have enjoyed some of Polanski's other works and had heard such great things about what some call the scariest movie of all time.
24;This is a great psychological thriller by Roman Polanski, who wisely cast himself into the lead role.
25;He after a time, dresses up like her in one scene and talks about how he's pregnant.
26;one of the most effective non.
27;The music is perfect for the mood of the flick, as is the camerawork and the casting.
28;Starring the likes of: Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas, Jo Van Fleet, and Shelley Winters, it has a strong cast.
29;Excellent psychological thriller and interesting look at Roman Polanski's early work in the trilogy of psychological thrillers.
30;Films of this caliber are very rare anymore.
31;I enjoyed this film very much and recommend it highly.
32;the unnerving plot gets underway when a man named Trelkovsky, played disarmingly by Polanski, moves into a creepy Parisian apartment building, occupying a flat in which the previous tenant committed suicide.
33;Part of the unsettling nature of this film is created by the director's skill in methodically escalating the plot, bit by excruciating bit.
34;in addition to Polanski, the outstanding cast includes Melvyn Douglas, Jo Van Fleet, Shelley Winters and Isabelle Adjani, all seemingly having a great time with a story that is mesmerizing, but granted, may be just too exasperatingly strange for some.
35;The high production values include gorgeous, moody photography by the great Sven Nykvist (who often photographed for Ingmar Bergman), and an appropriately eerie score by Philippe Sarde.
36;Though I am more familiar with Mr. Polanski's reputation as a filmmaker than with his films, I did expect him to bring a singular vision to the adaptation .
37;Much of the dialogue came straight from the book, and the actors were outstanding in their roles (including a stellar turn by Shelley Winters).
38;But does it matter since both narratives share the same events right up to the end?
39;I can accept bizarre characters and storylines, but the established elements must evolve during the film along believable lines.
40;it's possible that I'm being too harsh, and that those unfamiliar with the book will still be able to easily follow along with the movie.
41;I will say that the film should appeal to viewers with a heightened appreciation for subtle nuance, and that those who are used to a more contemporary presentation of horror may want to take a pass.
42;right up until it falls apart in the final act.
43;I love this movie but I received a European version that I could not play on my player.
44;growing maddening tension that pushes the film forward are all elements that Polanski used effectively once again in his more recent masterpiece.
45;The film can be appreciated as a well.
46;the film, set in France, stars Polanski as the relatively meek Trelkovsky, a modest man searching for an apartment.
47;There's a lot to appreciate here, especially Polanski's performance, but the rewards are far and few between.
48;and then his budding relationship with the previous tenant's best friend, Stella (Adjani), her mourning and trying to come to terms with the loss of her friend while Trelkovsky presents the pretense of actually knowing the deceased woman, his web of lies ever growing, made him appear even more creepy (and things do get creepier.
49;much more so, especially once he finds the previous tenant's clothes).
50;Despite this, Polanski does manage to keep the atmosphere throughout tense and fraught with an impending sense of danger (the Kafka.
51;The production looks wonderful, as do the interiors and very realistic location shots in Paris.
52;polanski demonstrates an expansive imagination in his creation of the madness surrounding this outlandish film.
53;If you love Polanski movies, you might give it 5 stars.
54;"Other reviewers disagree and feel that ""The Tenant is one of Roman Polanski's greatest and darkest films."""
55;It has become a cult favorite and is perhaps best known for its director dressing as a woman.
56;Polanski won a Best Director Oscar for the film The Pianist, which also won best picture.
57;If you like Polanski, you will like this movie.
58;I watched the movie late at night and thought it was very well made, but I still couldnt comprehend the ending.
59;"You see the contrast between him and ""Real"" men in the movie."
60;I enjoy a strange and slow flick, I loved the ninth gate.
61;Roman Polanski stars and directs in this vicious, haunting little conte.
62;Trelkovsky, eager to please, diffident in all aspects of his life and his civil.
63;service job, anxious to avoid offense, lounges drunk on the bed of his lover (the astonishing Isabelle Adjani, here hopelessly gorgeous) and wonders by what right he considers himself.
64;perfect as the meek and meticulous Trelkovsky, eager to please, anxious to avoid offense.
65;perfect is Polanski's meticulous attention to detail in the atmosphere of malice: a harmless, noisy house.
66;Polanski, Douglas, and Winters all speak their lines in English, but it's jarring to hear French gens.
67;If you enjoy Roman Polanski, this small 1976 film is truly a masterpiece.
68;To tell too much of the plot gives away a great deal.
69;There is also a great deal of humor and wit.
70;A standout cast including Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Shelley Winters lend tremendous support to Polanski's riveting performance.
71;Does it actually ever end?
72;Watch this film as you move into the apartment house along with Roman only to become terrified!
73;The Sream takes on a whole new meaning!
74;"You can see the roots of ""Rosemary's Baby"" in this unique portraiture of multiple dwelling!"
75;the movie is well done because of the talented director, but the story is too far.
76;"As was the case with Roman's adaptation of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" you can read the book ""The Tenant"" (by Roland Topor) and watch the movie and see very little difference between the two."
77;Perhaps the script could have been really tightened up but, hey, hindsight is always 20/20 and we (the viewing public) always think we can do a better job than the director.
78;making that always draws me to his films is the fact that he doesn't explain things.
79;though this is not one of my favorite Roman Polanski films, it's interesting, nonetheless, and is a great compendium to the book.
80;Finally one night I put it in after getting tired of watching predictable movies and got to see one of Polanski's finest attempts at making an original mystery come to life.
81;All I knew is that it was going to be a psychological thriller and that he had just made CHINATOWN a year before.
82;I was amazed to see what he had accomplished with this story.
83;Polanski stars in it as a new tenant who moves into an apartment building with some of the weirdest and most intriguing characters I've seen in cinema.
84;"Great acting from all of them
85;Polanski's talent at slowly bringing in audiences to a story is certainly impressive.
86;The imagery in this film is some of the best I've seen, and the music makes it a work of art.
87;It is a bonus that he is also the main character in this film.
88;The Tenant definitely puts Roman Polanski on my list.
89;For younger viewers it may bring to mind modern classics like Blue Velvet or River's Edge.
90;but Roman was here first and he does it best.
91;Better yet, watch it in broad daylight.
92;I'd never seen Polanski act and he delivered a very strong performance here in an exceptionally unsettling movie.
93;it's well written, well shot, well acted and it's like watching a horrid accident unfold in slow motion.
94;The viewer never knows for sure and this makes the film highly provocative.
95;having watched Polanski's occult masterpiece, """"Rosemary's Baby,"""" I can't help but believe that Trelkovsky is part of a complex Satanic conspiracy."""
96;There is also the human tooth embedded in his apartment wall.
97;There are, however, English subtitles for us hearing impaired.
98;The Tenant is highly recommended for fans of psychological horror, fans of occult thrillers, and fans of Roman Polanski's works.
99;Undoubtedly one of the most horrifying films I have ever seen, Polanski's The Tenant ranks as perhaps his overlooked masterpiece.
100;God knows why, but it sets up the framework for a really believable, chilling descent into madness.
101;sees striking similarities between him and the woman who jumped from the apartment room he is living in.
102;there are memorable scenes in which he is frantically offered her brand of cigarettes, coffee, etc.
103;"Perhaps Polanski wants us to see in Tarkovsky the male echo of the former tenant
104;He finds (or does he?)
105;what I don't understand is why more people aren't aware of this film, as it definitely one of the most powerful pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen.
106;Aside from a few scattered absurd scenes, the entire thing is chillingly believable.
107;I recalled seeing a movie a few years ago with a similar plot and thought this was it.
108;Story, which is based on some novel, is great because it tells you about the tragedy of a man falling victim to an unfair world.
109;You really see and feel how insane he goes with the good story pacing.
110;there's a few humorous parts but it's mostly dark and dramatic.
111;A fearlessly original masterpiece of suspense.
112;Yes it's very suspenseful, psychologically stirring and very funny with razor sharp wit.
113;Though this film is widely hailed as one of the greatest underground.
114;wall with a neighbor can relate to The Tenant as it produces an unsettling cinematic experience that will give grounds for thoughts to question the character of your neighbors.
115;the story sounds really good and gripping .
116;He has a beautiful girl interested in him .
117;polanski made a lot of outstanding movies, most of which are classics by now.
118;this one is his very best of the 1970's decade.
119;Deliberately paced, ultimately gripping film about a seemingly nice, normal single man who moves into an apartment whose previous tenant, named Simone, committed suicide by jumping out the window.
120;He comes to believe it's a plot to drive him to suicide.
121;Roman Polanski (who co. wrote and also directed) is brilliant as Trelkovsky, the quiet tenant who's plunged into a nightmare that may or not be real.
122;He's believable as an Everyman who suddenly finds himself alienated and in the grips of something he can't control.
123;A fascinating and haunting psychological journey that keeps you intrigued (and disturbed) right up until the final, bone.
124;Not for every taste, but still """"The Tenant"""" is pure cinema terror all the way."""
125;These are the themes of Roman Polanski's 1976 film, The Tenant.
126;The film is tragically funny and creepy.
127;this film is one of my all.
128;time favorites because it belongs in that man in his room category.
129;I think I can only name a few such as Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, Vampire's Kiss, Love Object, or the French film, I Stand Alone.
130;The tragic ending is just undeniably hilarious.
131;roman Polanski is one of my favorite filmmakers and The Tenant is his best.
132;The Tenant is truly a Polanski tour.
133;The Tenant's score, which I really love, is simultaneosly hypnotic and tragic.
134;The Tenant is without doubt, Polanski's best film ever.
135;was this madness already in him or was he driven to madness by those nieghbours!I think it is the poetry of madness.
136;roman Polanski does brilliant acting, I actually think he was born for the part.
137;is so funny and so sad that it stays in your mind forever.
138;I feel that the Tenant is his alienation working its way onto screen and poked into our own minds eye.
139;Because even though THE TENANT is well acted.
140;polanski, in the titular role, delivers what is arguably his best acting performance.
141;and despite the fact that the ambiguous plot is both creepy and engaging, the film's conclusion is wholly dissatisfying and anti.
142;And this obsession eventually leads to Trelkovsky's undoing.
143;On the other hand, hardcore Polanski aficionados will probably love it from opening scene all the way to closing credits.
144;Polanski is very effective at depicting the mental deterioration of the title character, Trelkovsky, and gorgeous French actress Isabelle Adjani is compellingly bizarre as Stella, Trelkovsky's occasional love.
145;Veteran American actor Melvyn Douglas delivers a delightful performance as the landlord, and it's fun to see American actress Shelly Winters in a cameo role as the concierge of the apartment complex.
146;But nothing is interesting beyond that.
147;THE TENANT is one of those psychological thrillers you have to pay close attention to in order to understand and fully grasp the concept of paranoia.
148;It's one of the finest thrillers since Hitchcock's masterful PSYCHO.
149;We learn in the beginning that the place he's interested in once belonged to a woman by the name of Simone, a woman who was driven to suicide without specific explanation.
150;There, Trevoltsky meets Stella, a young woman who he seems entranced with and is a friend of Simone's.
151;What's he's created turns out to be a fine thriller in the vein of PSYCHO and REPULSION, and his exploration into the world of paranoia and delusions further cements his status as one of the great thriller directors of our generation.
152;THE TENANT remains a fine suspense thriller that will make you think whether the next neighbors you have will leave you guessing at every turn.
153;This story made me want to see it the second I saw the story.
154;Trelkovski later forms a good realationship with one of Simones friends, Stella.
155;Just the perfect ammount of horror here.
156;See it A. s. a. p.
157;Not everyone's favorite Polanski film, but it's great to have it out there.
158;This is one of Polanski's finest and strangest.
159;it seems to have had a lasting effect on those two gentlemen.
160;This creepy but not entirely effective thriller features Roman Polanski (also the director) as the title character, a quiet Parisian who has just moved into an apartment.
161;this is a good movie, but not the best of Polanski's efforts.
162;made film: creepy, suspenseful and generally entertaining.
163;It is, and let me tell you, folks .
164;Sure, there are American actors in the film, we don't get to hear their voices, but that's all right as Polanski gives a fine rendition of his role in French and the actors dubbing the rest of the cast acquit themselves extraordinarily well.
165;It used a French studio, French actors and technicians, and is thusly as sharp an evocation of the damp, mouldy side of Paris as has ever been seen in pictures.
166;But I hope you won't just take my word for it .
167;to see The Tenant in French is a unique viewing experience.
168;I'm not good at reviews, all I can say is that I really enjoyed this movie, I am a big fan of horror and psychological horror, this movie has you confused, not really sure if the lead character is crazy or if your going crazy.
169;All in all this is a awesome movie, and highly suggest it for anyone
170;In CHINATOWN, Polanski gave us a great story of corruption.
171;Here, in THE TENANT, Roman Polanski gives us a stunning new portrayal of absolute paranoia.
172;why is this a great film?
173;A first rate screenplay (beautifully constructed), amazing actors (Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas are great!)
174;The bulding (a parisian quartier) is absolutely fantastic.
175;allowing Mr. polanski enough freedom to put the camera wherever he wanted.
176;The main character starts to see, hear and discover things that may actually be true!
177;this film has one of the best studio cinematographies I have ever seen.
178;The music is also beautiful and you will love it from the moment it begins.
179;Also a great achevement is sound design.
180;this is one of those great films where mood and atmosphere set an exemple for what to do in a film .
181;"REVIEW: ""There's something going on in my building."""
182;It stars Polanski himself (a canny move) as a quiet, somewhat put.
183;THE TENANT tries to have it both ways: as a psychological horror story and as a real.
184;Yet it falters a bit on both accounts despite the excellent performances, and the beautiful camera work by legendary cinematographer Sven Nykvist.
185;The whole gist of Trelkovsky's eventual descent into madness can also be analyzed from a spiritual point.
186;Roman Polanski is, without a doubt, my favorite post.
187;talented, if he had one superior strength, it would be in his construction of the psychological drama.
188;Although it is a place one would really never like to visit, there is something compelling about really getting inside a person's trauma and seeing it from the inside out.
189;Polanski, as not just the film's director but the main character here, is a perfect fit in the 'dual' role of the lead, both insecure meek mouse and paranoiac mental case.
190;now, for anyone who has ever seen his earlier work 'Repulsion', that is one of my favorite thrillers and a work that made my top 100 list of personal favorites.
191;and I like it quite a bit.
192;In Polanski, the film is almost always a reality.
193;on the other hand, it may end up becoming an annual Halloween treat for me, one that .
194;ending and twist them until one's muscles begin to stiffen.
195;Perhaps, then, the bad dream that The Tenant embodies, however upsetting, is most impressive and worthwhile due to the attention of detail and depth and, well, the reality that it conveys.
196;To the person that wrote that this was a masterpiece please take heed to what I say in this review I will address you at the end of my review.
197;if you or anyone you know has a sleep deprivation problem please watch this flick.
198;I will mail it to you for free and I guarantee that your problem will be over.
199;I will give you this much the best part of this movie is when he killed himself but the DumbA&& couldn't do it right.
200;The Tenent is one of Polanski's many successful horror adaptions.
201;Shelly Winters and Joe Van Fleet also give very good, yet understated performances in this small, but terrifying thriller of identity crisis and paranoia.4/5*
202;"Trelkovsky willingly goes into ""danger""."
203;K willingly goes on his way.
204;The Tenant (Roman Polanski, 1975)Sometimes you put a brilliant novel together with a brilliant director and you get a brilliant movie.
205;roland Topor's novel, upon which this film is based, is a wonderful piece of outsider art.
206;This movie is very strange, it is one of the weirdest I have ever seen and I've seen lots!
207;It is over the top!
208;"Roman Polanski likes to have surreal moments in his films, even when he's making ostensibly realistic pictures like ""Chinatown"" or ""The Pianist."""
209;It's one of the strangest movies I've ever seen.
210;You're still waiting for a realistic explanation for what's happening onscreen.
211;I highly recommend this film.
212;It will haunt you for a long time.
213;I like THE TENANT better with each viewing.
214;Polanski fans will love this, more mainstream fans might think the pace is a little too slow.
215;One of my favorite neglected films, I recommend it highly.
216;This is the right interepretation: Simone and Roman Polanski are one and the same.
217;People will enjoy the movie more when they see it this way and understand it as a double personality.
218;"Another detail is that Stella knows Simone and also knows Roman Polanski the man, she is a friend to both of them but she does not know they are the same person, till Roman Polanski gets to believe that she is ""conspiring"" against him with the other tenants and the landlord."
219;Another hint is that viewers should accept that there is time.
220;If done well, I really like this type of film and found myself enjoying this one.
221;Despite its morbid themes, the film also has a pervasive, dark humor to it that reminds me of both Kafka's writing and Stanley Kubrick's films.
222;The film begins innocuously enough and really takes its time to build suspense.
223;Although known as a director, it turns out Polanski can act and is quite charming and charismatic.
224;It is his ability to carry the film as an actor that draws us into this film and captivates us, even though nothing terribly exciting happens at the onset.
225;The film is filled with interesting characters and terrific dialogue, which alone would be enough to make the film worth recommending.
226;Then there is the luminous Isabelle Adjani, who alone also would make the film worth watching.
227;She is absolutely gorgeous, even behind those massive 70's glasses and funky clothes.
228;As he convinces himself that he'll never meet the fate that awaited his predecessor in the apartment, his paranoia very gradually takes over as he finds quaint neighbors.
229;Roman Polanski became one of cinema's most capable film directors, and THE TENANT is among his very finest works in or out of Hollywood.
230;screen in a way that is clear and understandable and palpable to a broad audience.
231;tHE TENANT is a delectable treat for those viewers who can appreciate a journey into darkness, odd personalities, and extremely wry humor generated by nothing more contrived than human characters we've all encountered ourselves at some time or another.
232;the film segues deftly and seamlessly .
233;from serious moments, to undeniably hilarious moments, to moments of disturbing, frightening images leading inexorably to sub.
234;tHE TENANT is a fully formed film from start to finish, starting benignly enough (as with REPULSION) and developing into moments of human dysfunction to make one's skin crawl.
235;the last act and its climax are full of emotional complexity and revelation .
236;the film is perfectly visualized with a sound effects track as inspired as that of ROSEMARY'S BABY.
237;This is thoughtful art exploring aspects of the human condition, inspired by a director with a singular eye for things quintessentially unsettling.
238;There are moments when this movie dives into laughs.
239;But it still holds you into its grip of uneasiness.
240;If you know anything about this man's life, what he went through (and what he was about to go through, a scandal that caused him to flee the U. s.), the events in this very darkly humorous tale become all the more haunting.
241;I've read many comparisons to Taxi Driver, but the subtle supernatural implications found in The Tenant's more surreal moments remind me more of The Shining, wherein an alienated individual renders himself prone to dark, irrational powers by way of his own obsession.
242;holds barred, lights out masterpiece.
243;Right from the moment when Polanski visits the women in the hospital and she lets out that BLOOD CURDLING scream, you know you are in for a good one.
244;Guranteed the hair on the back of neck will stand up.
245;If you enjoyed any of Polanski's other films you will surely appreciate this one.
246;Recommended to any horror movie fan as well.
247;Polanski's 'the tenant' is a very haunting tale of a tenant who falls into a state of madness induced by his neighbors and the dark history of the apartment he is living in.
248;it is shot beautifully by the great sven nykvist .
249;Great film, worthy of four stars, but.
250;Sorry but Roman Polanski has done so much better then this.
251;I have the movie and love the movie Rosemary's Baby so, that is why I bought The Tenant.
252;I was so excited when I received it that I had to watch it as soon as possible.
253;I remember Rosemary's Baby keeping my attention from start to finish when I first watched it.
254;His acting is surprisingly top notch and you really feel for this character even though his thoughts may be blown way out of proportion.
255;This film earns its five stars and I recommend it to anyone.
