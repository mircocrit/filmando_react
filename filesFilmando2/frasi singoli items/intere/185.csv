187;liked the movie could not pass it up when it was on blueray and this is a good way to add to a collection.
188;Topol is an amazing lead actor!!
189;There are some really sad parts that hurt my heart, but this is one of the best musicals ever!!
190;great charactors and great humor.
191;throw in a solid story line and you can't go wrong on this one.
192;And the musical is about how he handles it.

199;Fiddler on the Roof is a wonderful musical and one of my very favorites, combining the right touch of comedy and fun with a serious, meaningful plot.

201;The songs and musical routines are fun, memorable, sometimes even pretty, and many have become classics.
202;length version of the film with Topol's running commentary, which reveals some genuinely interesting information about the making of the movie and the actors, etc.
203;You also get commentary from the film's director, as well as a never.

207;To my surprise even my small grandchildren love it!

216;The family bonds and values are so good in it.
217;Everyone should see this at least once.
218;I have always loved this movie.
219;This is one of my favorite movies.
220;Great classic musical of Jewish life back in the day and how the head of a particular family deals with trials, daughters and God.
221;This is my all time favorite musical.
222;I love this movie version.
223;I even love ever song.
224;the music from this film will remain in your head long after the three hour movie ends and you'll be happy about it.
225;The entire film is well done.
226;There seems to exist a perfect balance between real life Jewish discrimination in Russia and humorous interactions between the characters.
227;Perfect for a night of laughs and tears.
228;This is a great portrayal of Jewish culture, love and social change.
229;film Fiddler on the Roof is a classic, and features some hilarious songs and rousing cinematography.
230;5 out of 5 stars, a classic!
231;this has always been one of my favorite movies, the theme is so vital and delivered in such a great way.
232;Next to goodbye mr. Chips and Tom sawyer , this movie boasts great musical arrangements by John Williams.
233;The main title sequence is extraordinary.
234;Oh yes, it's a good film as well.
235;From beginning to end, was surprised to find what a GREAT movie and musical this is!
236;it's certainly one of the most excellent movie.
237;"so many good songs with both interesting and funny lyrics, but as for fine music, it would be utterly fulfilling if one viewed no more than just the preface song ""Tradition"" followed by the Fiddler's solo at the very beginning of the action."
238;"What an exquisite musical opening!The words of the ""Tradition"" song bear careful attention as they establish the foundation for the story that lies ahead."
239;"Tradition tells us who we are (is the source of identity and customs), and ""tells us what God wants us to do."""
240;Challenges to Tradition in this story arise out of a determined loosening by the young people of the usual strictures surrounding love.
241;all the actors/characters are engaging.
242;I enjoyed especially how the character of the ancient rabbi was interwoven into the story from time to time.
243;He asks God who was the match.
244;He is able to relax, accordingly.
245;of course, there is great tragedy in this story.
246;and yet the fiddler with his irrepressibly high.
247;hearted music is always apt to appear as a foil to it.
248;Also Topol's comments are effectively edited into the accompanying Jewison's commentary, together they provide valuable insight into the making of Fiddler on the Roof.
249;I have loved this story/movie for years and so enjoyed seeing it again.
250;the music is beautiful and timeless.
251;The sound through my speakers nice.
252;Love the extras and I'm very happy with it.
253;Topol is fantastic in role as Tevye.
254;Ordered as a gift for a friend.
255;It was one of her favorite movies.
256;It came promptly and went over very well as her present.
257;She loved it and I've watched it with her a few times since then.
258;This is without a doubt the greatest movie musical of them all.
259;"chava's banishing for marrying a Russian to the sheer joy of ""To Life""."
260;Everything in this film is beyond first rate.
261;"The music alone is a great reason for purchasing this film, but there's nothing like seeing songs like ""If I Were a Rich Man"" and ""Matchmaker"" performed on screen as opposed to hearing it on the film's soundtrack alone."
262;This superb film does a terrific job portraying turn.
263;This movie is now my favorite!
264;It is excited, humorous, interesting, fun, enjoyable.
265;and best of all 100% clean.
266;This film is something the whole family can enjoy along with learn from.
267;Good music, humor, tradition, history, dancing, adaptability, love, hate .
268;Wonderful performances (especially by Topol) make this a must.
269;The best of family movie styles, captivating and educational.
270;Everyone should see this movie.
271;By that definition, this is indisputably a classic.
272;The cinematography got an Academy Award for good reason.
273;Norman Jewison also deserves a lot of credit for his casting choices, especially Topol as Tevye, and for the energy and feeling of day.
274;day realism the movie has.
275;The collector's edition has more special features than the special edition.
276;Japan embraced the movie even more than the US and Europe did because they were throwing off centuries of traditions very quickly.
277;i really enjoy the first half of the musical because it's a storyline befitting a comic opera or situation comedy where deception helps solve an interpersonal problem.
278;The first half makes it worthwhile for me to watch the whole musical.
279;"A lot of the music is delightful, and my favorites are ""If I Were a Rich Man"" and ""L'Chaim""."
280;Most of the time, I feel like the dialogue is very realistic and believable, which is what Jewison wanted the film to feel like.
281;The fiddler is a symbol of how traditions/customs add stability and enjoyment to life, and the roof is the shakiness of that stability.
282;I have a lot of respect for the musical genius of the melodies and the careful placement of songs through the musical, and for the acting, pace, and cinematography.
283;It is interesting that movie musicals sometimes encapsulate entire eras.
284;It kind of wrapped up 30 years of the Warners' influence on Warner Brothers.
285;Coming out in the early 1970s, it also seems to be the perfect encapsulation of the last several years of turmoil.
286;Neither the stage musical nor the movie's filming and release were designed to be timed with certain social changes, but I find that an interesting coincidence.
287;It is the last movie musical with a spectacular style similar to big.
288;This is such a classic, that I like all aspects of the music.
289;ray productions, it is a vast improvement over the prior versions and makes the film accessible to a whole new generation.
290;Loved it and highly recommend.
291;Good movie for young and old.
292;I could watch the movie again and still enjoy it.
293;As a guy I'm not into most musicals, but this is a great personal story told in pre.
294;The music enhances the story.
295;this musical brings back happy memories, where she can enjoy the music, while maybe not being able to follow the story line.
296;Maybe if you have a 5.1 or 7.1 setup, it sounds great (others have seemed to imply it does).
297;I watched with a Stereo setup and I can tell you that this 7.1 mix does NOT downmix very well to 2 channel stereo.
298;ray's I own, it is my first experience with it.
299;This is one of my favorite moviesThanks so much for having it.
300;IT is so wonderful and everyone should love it.
301;This is my favorite musical.
302;It tells all about life.
303;your relationship with your family, your love, your God.
304;This entertaining film adaptation of the great musical is a true classic that you can watch with the whole family.
305;Albeit a bit long (about 3 hours), the storyline is excellent, and can be appreciated by ALL cultures and ethnic or religious backrounds.
306;Topol as 'Tevye' is perhaps one of the best all.
307;time perfect character casting fits ever on film!
308;I thoroughly enjoy watching this tale.
309;It's wholesome, uplifting, enchanting, thought.
310;I now see why people speak so highly of the movie.
311;Throughout the movie, we witness those traditions being challenged and defeated by the daughters.
312;The struggle pulls the family apart, only to be held togther by the love of family.
313;The fiddler's role is the metaphorically portray the Jewish heart, and core strengths, values, traditions, .
314;It's all very well written and acted.
315;The second disc is quite informative.
316;And it was a musical that so many civic groups could pull off and audiences came to every kind of performance.
317;It is a story of family, of tradition, of changing times.
318;Then there are the wonderful songs.
319;You love him and feel for his plight.
320;The rest of his family is also enjoyable and each plays her part, but the story is for and about Tevye.
321;I like the opening number and understand the anchor and strength that come from tradition.
322;But it never is, is it?My favorite scene is when the idea of marriage as a love relationship finally dawns on Tevye and he asks the tough and wonderful Golde if she loves him.
323;a fantastic movie for family viewing and discussion.
324;just rewatching it for good time sake.
325;love the free streaming with prime!
326;I love the music in this music, the dancing, the story, it's memorable, moving, funny at the same time.
327;And it tells the true story of Jewish people having to leave their homeland.
328;One of the best movies ever made.
329;Must watch musical with amazing performances from all cast!
330;I saw Topol do this, I bought the movie when it came out.
331;well worth upgrading my library with
332;Topol was brilliant as the patriarch of this lovely family
333;"Love this movie but this ""special"" edition is NOT."
334;The sound a remastered 5.1 is actually 2.0 returned the product once and received more of the same.
335;One of the best musicals made.
336;It has the awards to prove it.
337;A timeless movie musical classic.
338;i bought this movie because i like musicals and this movie is a classic musical.
339;In Russia they endure anti semitism yet manage a normal happy life.
340;But it is a new world that is coming, a world of communism and fascism, of the growing of individuality and humanism, of new technologies (the sewing machine) and globalism.
341;One by one this jewish family is affected by these new ideas.
342;fiddler On The Roof is a musical masterpiece, though most of the great songs appear in the first half.
343;Recently introduced it to my boys, 8 and 12, who loved it as well.
344;and it was good for my boys to see males in these types of roles.
345;Classic fun for the whole family.
346;This movie is exceptionally produced with actors that bring you into their world.
347;Fantastic movie for any family of faith or lover of good production.
348;Traditional, entertaining a great cuddle up on the couch with your family movie.
349;I can watch this movie over.
350;An excellent story told realistically about how the Russian Czar's treated the Jewish people.
351;i HIGHLY recommend this film to any individual who enjoys both a good historical story,filmography,acting,cinematography and music as well!
352;Great story with wonderful songs!
353;This version of the film is the better of the two available.
354;Topov makes this story come alive!
355;"Ever since I had a part in ""Fiddler on the Roof"", while in college, it has been my favorite musical."
356;It is really a great production.
357;Recently though my interest in Russian Orthodoxy and her Tradition brought me back into contact with it, and I finally decided to see what it was all about.
358;the main character is a likable peasant Jew, who is desperately clinging to the old ways while the world he knows is rapidly disintegrating and disappearing.
359;it is interspersed with song and dance, yet manages not to get cheesy or sentimental.
360;it is a story I feel we can all relate to on some level.
361;But if you have a mind and a heart and you DON'T have FOTR, get it today.
362;Story takes place in a small Russian village prior to the Revolution and all the characters are well played .
363;This is one of the greatest musicals of our time.
364;the cast is great the music is great and so is the story.
365;if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.
366;Wonderful movie with music and a lesson on the changing times.
367;I play it over and over and enjoy some of the music more each time.
368;Every Time I hear Tapol singing If I were a Rich Man I become a really rich person.
369;butifule movie everytime I watch it.
370;It's nice having this movie on both Blue.
371;the heart can be a devious deceptor.
372;It reminds me how unwise the expression, Just follow your heart!
373;especially something as significant as marriage.
374;Goulda and Tevia's eventual emotions that followed their commitment is a wonderful illustration of this.
375;Topol, the star figure in the cast, transcends other roles he has had, with an absolutely perfect portrayal of Tevye.
376;The other members of the cast lend credence, humor and pathos to the story line as well.
377;The music and the story are magnificent, be it presented by a high school drama class or on a professional stage.
378;After a few more actors turned down the role, they worked their way up to hefty, robust looking Zero Mostel.
379;Topol's full, baritone voice both in speaking and singing is dinstinctive among the many who have played Tevya.
380;I highly recommend this movie.
381;An excellent movie that presents the classic struggle between youth and tradition.
382;A great classic movie we love to watch.
383;Seen it many times and will definitely watch again.
384;The actual content of the blu ray disk sparkles with amazing color and detail.
385;The sound, as far as I am concerned is excellent with good lip synching.
386;This movie has been my favorite movie since I was a young one.
387;If you watch it, have a lot of kleenex with you.
388;Everything we hear, sense, touch, smell, see, taste.
389;Awesome for children and adults alike, this is a cherished gift for all generations.
390;Let us NOT FORGET the cruelty mankind endeavors to rise above.
391;It made me laugh .
392;Mostly, it helped define me, my values, my love of people, joy, friendships and family.
393;One of the best entertainment gifts you can offer someone.
394;I enjoyed this movie for the story, the music, the actors.
395;I was able to share the music that I loved and they loved it too.
396;A three hour movie with intermission and they stayed to the end.
397;Great picture of a struggle between love and devotion to tradition.
398;The love of a father for his children and love for his tradition become a struggle that can only be won by giving up something loved.
399;this is by far one of the best musicals ever, right up there with west side story and sound of music.
400;the songs are wonderful and the story is quite well done, letting the viewer decide what's going on.
401;This was a great movie and wonderful for a family.
402;if you enjoy history and music,this movie is for you!
403;It is every bit as good as I remembered and the music is even more wonderful, now that I am older and can appreciate the story line which accompanies the musical gifts.
404;Having been raised with sisters, I can easily relate to the scenes of interaction between Tevye's daughters and I admire their independant spirits.
405;Paul Michael Glasser is brilliant as a youthful idealist who wins the heart of the second daughter, Hodel, who is played by a friendly and outgoing Neva Small.
406;Because Leonard Frey's Motel hearkens unto the voice of his sweetheart, remembering that even a poor taylor is entitled to some happiness, he wins her hand in marriage.
407;Ray Lovelock's Fyetkev is the Good Gentile who wins the affection of beautiful, red.
408;It had depth and scope in addition to beautiful music.
409;In an interesting footnote, Chaim Topol and Michael Jayston, the two leads in Fiddler on the Roof and Nicholas and Alexandra ended up working together in a film called The Public Eye with Mia Farrow a year later.
410;My husband is Russian Jewish background and gave me insights as I watched this delightful movie.
411;He also loved it because it reminded him of his grandfather.
412;Such a touching story of bitter sweet struggles and the human condition.
413;I like to watch it from time to time because I pick up so much more each time: humor, wit, sadness, and the whole array of the human condition.
414;Norman Jewison is brilliant, the songs are touching, and very special.
415;An all time favorite and annual event in our house.
416;Our entire family (including kids ages 9 and 12) LOVED this movie.
417;Fiddler on the Roof is easily one of the best movies/musicals ever created.
418;It is the movie version of the stage musical.
419;I love to sing along with those wonderful songs in the film.
420;received it as one of my (and best) Christmas Presents this year from my family.
421;Product is great and I recommend this seller.
422;It is great viewing for members of the family.
423;You will be singing right along with Topol and humming some of the tunes for days afterwards.
424;It is one that wil stick with you.
425;Every time I watch this movie, I am so impressed with how clever the dialogue is.
426;The story is wonderful and heartwarming.
427;Great story of decisions affecting change from the top, down to the common person.
428;Brings some history to life.
429;This is my all time favorite movie and now I have it to enjoy any time of the year that I want.
430;Great classic film with fun songs that stay with you for years to come!
431;"the film would be nominated for eight Academy Awards and would win three for ""Best Cinematography"" (Oswald Morris), ""Best Music, Scoring Adaptation and Song Score"" (John Williams) and ""Best Sound"" (Gordon K. McCallum, David Hildyard)."
432;Fiddler on the Roof, the movie is presented in two acts and incorporates music from the film from Tevye and his family's perspective.
433;The film looks absolutely magnificent and holds up extremely well 40.
434;"As what Twentieth Century Fox has done for ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"", the goal was to present the film as it looked originally and that includes Oswald Morris' Oscar winning cinematography which has a unique look to it."
435;ray, this film looks great!
436;A very good amount of grain, skin tones are natural, you can see the blues clearly in Tzeitel's eyes, you can see the detail in the villages, the grime on the faces of the characters and more.
437;"I was definitely pleased by the cinematography and all that research that Norman Jewison and crew did in order to capture the look and feel of the village during 1905, was quite an accomplishment and it shows in the film!AUDIO and SUBTITLES:""Fiddler on the Roof: 40th Anniversary"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS."
438;Jerry Bock did such a magnificent job in creating the music and working with conductor John Williams to really capture traditional Russian and Jewish themes but through lyrics by Sheldon Harnick that just want to make you smile and even laugh at times.
439;It's the music that I remembered back then and it's the music that continues to resonate strongly today.
440;Sound effects placed in the surround channels, especially during the more ensemble performances sound spectacular.
441;"Once again, I was in awe of this lossless soundtrack and this is the best I have heard of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" ever!Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French."
442;A wonderful audio commentary Norman Jewison looks back and you can hear a bit of emotion having seen this film for the first time in many years and knowing that many of the talent of the film are no longer living.
443;"(49:33) A fantastic documentary about Norman Jewison and footage of him working on the ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and seeing the challenges that the filmmaker had during the filming of the movie and also his candid thoughts on Hollywood at the time."
444;featuring the original shot of Tevye's dream in color (5:56) and also a side.
445;"release trailer, the ""reserve your seat"" trailer, Will Rogers trailer, 1971 TV spot and the 1979 TV spot."
446;Fiddler on the Roof was a film that captured my attention at an early age and I guess you can say that I have a connection to it as I grew up in a family who believed in tradition and in fact, even I grew up expecting family (ie.
447;Fiddler on the Roof resonated so strongly with many people because not only was it a wonderful film with beautiful, catchy and enjoyable music but there is an important story behind the music about a family having to go through changes.
448;A father who believed in tradition, knowing how much of it is being lost and seeing it upfront, close up as his daughters, that he raised believing in tradition, now going against it.
449;But also seeing a land that he loved, a livelihood that he was so used to, now being destroyed by the government and literally being kicked out of the country.
450;so, the film had a strong story, wonderful music but to make it happen, it needed wonderful direction, location and to achieve realism and that is where Norman Jewison comes in.
451;To make it happen and he achieved it with great efficacy.
452;And also, Joseph Stein did a remarkable job with the screenplay.
453;"and the interesting thing about Norman Jewison is that I can easily call ""Fiddler on the Roof"" as a masterpiece, a classic for the filmmaker but his list of accomplishments from his oeuvre as a filmmaker, as this film does standout, so does many of his other films."
454;"But where ""Fiddler on the Roof"" is achieves success is that he had high ambitions and his crew wanted the same, to create a realistic atmosphere of and bringing that memoir created by Sholem Aleichem to life."
455;"From Tevye's ""If I Were a Rich Man"", my favorite ""Tradition"" by the company and then my wife's favorite ""Matchmaker"" by Tevye's children and of course, along with the music comes memorable scenes and who can not forget the Tevye's dream sequence which was one of the most surprising and freaky."
456;"michael Jackson Thriller"" scenes that I have seen from a film and of course, the choreography of the ""Wedding Celebration/The Bottle Dance""."
457;This is one memorable movie that received a fantastic Blu.
458;is it the ultimate Blu.
459;"Well, 20th Century Fox raised the bar with ""The Sound of Music"" from restoration, remastering and to presentation with its many special features."
460;"In the case of ""Fiddler on the Roof"", although the film looks great and it's the best looking version of the film that I have seen."
461;"And as mentioned, this is the best I have heard of ""Fiddler on the Roof""!"
462;"overall, ""Fiddler on the Roof: 40th Anniversary"" is a wonderful release and if you are a fan of the film, I'll tell you right now, this is the best looking and sounding version of the film to date."
463;And if you really enjoyed this film, this is a must.
464;The music in this movie is still catchy, and our teen daughter enjoys the story line as well.
465;It is a great movie and it is historical.
466;Classic movie for fans of musicals.
467;Acting and singing are top notch.
468;Music is classic, catching and has withstood the test of time.
469;good musical, even with the darker elements added.
470;What a wonderful way to spend an evening or a rainy afternoon!
471;A lovely classic that should be in every video library.
472;we love the musical themes.
473;great story and appropriate for all family.
474;i love it because it is so politically incorrect!
475;One of my all time favorites.
476;the music is simply wonderful!
477;"a must have in everyone's video collection
478;this is a very good classic movie.
479;it doesn't quite rank up with my favorite movies, but it certainly is a very good one
480;A wonderful movie that our entire family, young and old, really enjoyed.
481;This version is very true to the Broadway production, which I saw, and even better for the scope of its scenery.
482;What the cast and crew of Fiddler on the Roof have achieved is breathtaking.
483;They've taken the literary concept of magical realism and translated it into the language of cinema.
484;The events and characters are exaggerated, the songs are almost overly grandiose, but all this does is to emphasize the emotional and psychological truths at this great film's heart.
485;dance numbers, the film enshrines those emotions and ideas that comprise the human mind, and, more than that, the soul.
486;I was very pleased with the remake of this movie.
487;I enjoyed watching it over and over again and letting my grandchildren watch it.
488;We remembered seeing this movie years ago and wanted to see it again.
489;It was just as great seeing it last night as it was years ago.
490;I have to say, I can see their point.
491;one by one, his older daughters buck tradition and choose their own husbands by falling in love: a penniless tailor, a revolutionary teacher, and a local, non.
492;One of the sweetest moments in the movie comes when all this romance gets to Tevye and he asks his wife of many years if she loves him.
493;it's a wonderfully emotional snapshot of the setting.
494;It's about the struggle to find, accept, and hold on to one's roles in the family and in society, something everyone can relate to.
495;were hard to watch, but important, especially if the thinking they provoke extends beyond the specific people, time, and place.
496;The lesson is all the more powerful for being surrounded by warmth and humor.
497;the music is, of course, the first thing I think of, and is just perfect.
498;Even my kids liked it, and I've heard warped versions of """"If I Were a Rich Man"""" around the house a few times since we finished watching the movie."""
499;What can you say about this wonderful movie.
500;I've seen it at least five times over the years and I get something more out of it each time I watch it.
501;It is just a lovely movie in every way and such a pleasant way to spend a cold winter evening curled up under a throw or with the fireplace on, getting lost in 'Tradition'.
502;The music is what gets to me first, then, of course, the story itself of a man, a father who loves his daughters and is bound by tradition, which keeps him somewhat sane in an insane world.
503;But his daughters are not bound by tradition and they love who they love.
504;It's a beautiful story and matched together with the music that touches something very deep and very ancient in me creates this moving drama.
505;"FIDDLER ON THE ROOF differs drastically from most musicals for two reasons: it tells an engrossing story
506;Director Norman Jewison is the true star of this epic, as he is able to seamlessly transport the viewer to the Russian village of Anatevka.
507;It is here the viewer is vigorously and wonderfully indoctrinated into the Jewish faith through the narration of Tevye, the milkman (Topol).
508;Again, Jewison tells a powerful story, superbly augmented by the music.
509;topol and the rest of the cast are fantastic.
510;This film covers the full gambit of emotion, from lighthearted fun to dark remorse.
511;I have loved this movie for a long time and have had it on VHS for a long time.
512;My wife is extremely pleased with this gift.
513;It's her favorite musical, and you can't beat that as a gift.
514;See the play or see the video and you won't find better entertainment anywhere.
515;I've seen the video four times now and enjoy every viewing.
516;Topal and the cast of characters are magnificent in the film.
517;Beautiful lyrics, superb acting and my favorite song is Do you love me .
518;the visuals for a film made quite a while ago were fantastic like it was made a few years ago.
519;We like musicals so any musical is fine with us.
520;If you like musicals, you'll like this.
521;Our whole family enjoyed it, including the kids ages 10.15.
522;I'd highly recommend it for family movie night.
523;My whole family enjoyed it, and it was a good kick off for disussion of that time era.
524;The songs will last in your mind for a long time.
525;Fiddler on the Roof is one of the best films ever made.
526;It is a musical with wonderful songs, but at the same time, it is so much more.
527;First and foremost, it is a film about family ties, values, and conflicts.
528;It is a film about love.
529;It is very funny, very witty, and very sad, all at the same time.
530;I laughed, and then I cried.
531;It has memorable characters: Haim Topol, who played Tevya the milkman on the stage in London, is made for the role, and has become identified with it.
532;He portrays an authoritative, yet sympathetic father, and he is the source of many witty and very funny comments about life.
533;or in attempting to explain how a certain tradition began, """"I'll tell you."""
534;Norma Crane is equally wonderful in playing Tevye's wife.
535;Life has not been good to her, and this shows, and she has never experienced romantic love.
536;But she is a good, loving,forgiving mother, and a devoted wife.
537;The three eldest daughters are beautiful and dream of a great match.
538;"the film is replete with humour, wit, love, and great songs, among which ""Tradition"" (accompanied by wonderfully clever film shots, ""Matchmaker,"" ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" ""To life,"" ""Sunrise, Sunset,"" ""Anatevka,"" some merry, some hearbreaking, all utterly enjoyable and touching."
539;pay attention to the opening shot of the film, it is absolutely brilliant.
540;The cinematography is splendid, the colours are strong and fresh.
541;The locations are beautiful and faithfully recreate village life.
542;You will laugh, cry, be entertained, as well as deeply touched.
543;This is a wonderful motion picture.
544;Topol was a wonderful pick for the part of Topol.
545;The story is great, too.
546;I recommend it for every family.
547;Its a beautiful family movie.
548;I reccomended highly, its funny and very entertaining.
549;I enjoyed all the songs and music.
550;It is the inspiring story of a people who make the best of what they have, and know who they are.
551;Bringing parts of history alive in words, song and dance brings this awesome musical to people in an enjoyable way After all, don't we all experience the truth of our existence, and often look at it with fresh eyes and an open heart?
552;In spite of the fact that fathers had the right to name who their children would marry, Tevya still has his moments.
553;The story itself is characteristically light.
554;weight, as the focus is on the music and dancing .
555;The Jews have always attached great importance to their traditions in order to maintain the stability of their way of life.
556;The screenplay was by Joseph Stein, from the story `Tevye and his Daughters' by Sholem Aleichem, so it has a very authentic Jewish atmosphere.
557;A classic movie with great acting and music that beautifully enhanced the story.
558;The role of Tevya was amazingly well played.
559;I am pleased to say that I enjoyed it as much as ever.
560;topol imbues the character of Tevye the milkman with soul, energy, poignancy, and humor.
561;Norma Crane is the sweetly acerbic Golde, whose love for her family, innate superstition, and acceptance of things that she cannot change are the constants in her exhausting life.
562;Molly Picon is an amusing Yente, who does her best to bring people together even if they're not compatible.
563;Leonard Frey is a delightful Motel Kamzoil, the skinny and shy tailor who has loved Tzeitel for years.
564;Fiddler on the Roof has a magnificent score that I hum to myself as I walk down the street (I try to keep my voice down).
565;The beautifully choreographed production numbers are electrifying, and the quiet scenes are funny and extremely touching.
566;"certain scenes in ""Fiddler"" are so vivid as to be unforgettable."
567;Also worth noting are the lovely candle.
568;Fiddler is a skillfully directed and wonderfully performed film that, so far, has stood the test of time.
569;This one movie has sooo much history, so much of so many stories rolled into one movie, and I love the music, too.
570;I loved watching it as a teenager and no can enjoy it again.
571;If you are looking for a good movie, here it is.
572;An old classic brought to you in a new format.
573;"The music from ""Fiddler on the Roof"" gets better and better ."
574;"the more I listen to it, the more I enjoy it
575;The description of the house that he would build if he was a rich man is great .
576;This was a gift for a friend who likes the film .
577;the price makes it easy to give as a gift .
578;My family have always loved this.
579;If you enjoy musicals you will love this.
580;This movie is a classic.
581;The picture and sound were also great.
582;Actors fabulous with their singing on point.
583;Loved the look and feel of the scenery too.
584;The movie itself is a beautiful work about life.
585;the transfer has good video, but only middling sound.
586;Gives insight into the Jewish plight.
587;Love the music and lyrics.
588;I love this move, however.
589;Happily, I have it in full.
590;Watched it together with my kids, 10 and 8.
591;Nice combination of good movie and great music showing culture and traditions of the time.
592;I had many questions from my kids and we had good thoughtful talk after the movie.
593;This is a true classic .
594;as relevant and rewarding as the day it was released.
595;Terrific music, a wonderful cast.
596;Topal shines as Tevya the father of 5 daughters.3 of whom are of marriageable age.
597;they also have minds of their own when it comes to the groom
598;For teachers who have to teach Open Court, this story fits in beautifully with the Heritage Unit, The Night Journey.
599;Also, powerful music and incredible acting.
600;And had the same pleasure and enjoyment.
601;Topol is fantastic and a great singer.
602;Really a great version of the musical.
603;Topol brings such life to the character.
604;Enjoy it every time I watch it.
605;A wonderful movie for everyone.
606;Great music, great story of the need to change with the times and let your children grow as they will.
607;My friend and I were talking about it the other day and it made me remember how much I loved it so I HAD to add it to my collection of movies.
608;I'm so excited to watch it over and over and over!
609;The music alone would be enough to watch this movie, but the story is enchanting.
610;It has its sad moments, but the joy of life is clearly the focal point of this movie.
611;I rate it on the same level as The Sound Of Music.
612;This is such a good movie and the blu.
613;My family enjoys watching this movie and singing along.
614;the admiration can be laid at the feet of their tremendous courage, world.
615;The film was wonderfully illustrative of one of the core beliefs of MY faith (which I hold dear and for which I am thankful), namely"
616;possibly one of the greatest cinematic gifts of all time.
617;"Best of all.you don't have to be a ""wealthy man"" to enjoy it!"
618;but on the other hand ), they provide the comedy relief of this serious play.
619;weary fear of change, to his joyous dreams of plenty, Topol gives an exuberant and memorable performance.
620;For me the movie brings back lots of great memories.
621;This is one of my favorite movies.
622;I HIGHLY recommend it, for everyone, not just those of the Jewish faith.
623;I liked the movie a lot.
624;this movie is so nice i have seen it many many times and i still watch it when ever i get to it so i jyst lke it its good for me
625;They were people of strong faithand came to America to start a new life for themselves, theirchildren and all of us grandchildren!
626;Fully restored to its original length, intermission and all, the last great musical from Broadway to the screen, settled at the end the the Czarit Russia, this three Oscar Winner movie, has a beautyfull photography, Art and Set Decoration (shooted in former Yugoslavia), and the masterfull touch of the great Maestro John Williams, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra
627;The songs are beautiful, the theme masterfully woven through the whole tale.
628;Great movie, all around, a bit of a downer still at the end, but makes it easier to be sympathetic to an ostracized sub.
629;Music was great and so was the acting.
630;Beautiful story, beautiful songs, wonderful dancing and fabulous actors.
631;At the same time it was entertaining and funny.
632;The main actor was outstanding in his performance.
633;I has always been a big favorite!
634;This has got to be among the top 5 musicals ever adapted for the big screen.
635;Many musicals have great difficulty in balancing the music and dance with the storyline as they are either too heavy on the one side over the other but here you get excellent music and choreography and an equally excellent storyline.
636;This movie is 3 hours long and yet it is so enjoyable that I didn't even feel the length and the Intermission at the middle of the movie actually irritated me rather than giving me a sense of relief at the break.
637;The anamorphic widescreen presentation as well as the brilliant scoring and camerawork makes this an unforgettable cinematic experience.
638;"The special features on the reverse side of the disc are also very good with a very good documentary:""Norman Jewison, Filmaker"" and ""Stories of Shalom Aleichem ."""
639;We studied an overview of Judaism in our Classical Literature class, and they thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
640;The singing was superb, acting great.
641;I watched this as a kid and remembered loving the soundtrack.
642;Seeing it as an adult reminded me of why I enjoyed it so much.
643;it is hilarious, has catchy songs, lovable characters, thought.
644;Great for the whole family.
645;"So Fox doesn't consider you might actually want to get from one feature to another.Yeah, this is a pretty ""Foxed."
646;Always like the movie and music.
647;Nice to play every once in while.
648;It was a great price and great condition.
649;This is one of my favorite movies of all time and not just in the category of musicals.
650;The acting, the songs the story is so well done.
651;We watched it with our 24 daughter who saw it for the first time and she loved it.
652;This is a great family movie.
653;A wonderful story depicted with great acting, scenery and emotion.
654;I grew up with it and now i can be a kid again every time i watch it.
655;The Fiddler on the Roof is a classic and needed to be put into Blu.
656;We have enjoyed the movie.
657;Entertaining and a pleasure to watch.
658;You will be singing the songs long after you watch the movie.
659;A movie I used to watch as a child and it is still as good now as it was then.
660;It is a wonderful integration of music into a story.
661;A brilliant translation to the wide screen.
662;And Topol is outstanding in his somewhat underplayed (relatively speaking) performance which allows the rest of the cast their moments of glory.
663;It may not represent the poverty of the Russian shtetl, but it is a warm,ingratiating story of how one man came to accept the modern world.
664;Just wonderful technically in its use of the wide canvas of Panavision.
665;"I am hearing impaired(bornthat way) and this is 1 of the movies aside from ""The Sound of Music"", that has truly captured my heart of love for music and actually understanding it!!"
666;My brother was also in the play when we were in Elementary school, for he shared thesame feelings as I did of the movie production and he has a remarkable voice himself.
667;He is now working on movie sets as a crew member for setting up the sites and locations.
668;Gran Torino was his favorite experience so far.
669;I guarantee you will want to watch it and recommend it to your family and friends!
670;This is the most beautiful movie I ever saw.
671;The songs are great and the playing list is excellent.
672;But I sing the songs all the time, and I know the story backwards and forwards.
673;Watching it again, after 15 or more years, was wonderful.
674;SO much talent went into the creation of this superb movie, based on the folk.
675;It is a human story about the right of people to simply exist, told with irony, humor, romanticism and even some hard truth.
676;I highly recommend this to anyone who has never seen it before, or recently.
677;Fiddler on the Roof is a movie that will always stand the test of time.
678;there are many moments of humor and other moments that are poignant.
679;whereas Topol's character certainly stands out the most, each of the supporting cast members give noteworthy performances.
680;And the music is all fabulous.
681;To Life, Sunrise Sunset, Tradition, and If I Were A Rich Man are all very memorable songs.
682;If you like musicals, you'll love Fiddler.
683;It's a story of a Jewish community in Czarist Russia, and their lives and trials told in rich songs: If I Were a Rich Man, Sunrise, Sunset, Tradition, and many more.
684;The story revolves around a peddlar, is wife, and three of their daughters.
685;One of the greatest musicals ever on broadway.
686;whether your Jewish or gentile this moving story will touch your heart.
687;love Jewish people and history.
688;And this movie so well done.
689;it had drama and laughter.
690;i hope that they enjoy the culture and the families and yes, the tradition.
691;An absolute classic, everyone should own this movie.
692;literal laughs and tears story.
693;Pure entertainment and pure magic.
694;Historically this movie gives a good understanding of the plight of Jewish communities in Eastern Europe.
695;russiamusically this movie is awesome.
696;The opening violin solo (on top of the roof) sets the tone for the whole movie.you cannot help but fall in love with the characters portrayed by the cast.
697;just a great great movie.
698;I first saw Fiddler on the Roof in the early seventies and have loved it since.
699;Directed by Norman Jewison, it's widely acknowledged to be one of the best musicals ever made.
700;Oswald Morris' beautiful cinematography and Jewison's compelling film.
701;making pursue these questions both for the residents of Anatevka and for us in our ever.
702;clear picture on a double.
703;Jewison Topol's commmentary give you some ideas behind the making of the film, what the director was trying to achieve, and how Topol moved his character from stage to screen.
704;A marvelous film, as is the soundtrack, and Topol, who stars in the lead, gives a fabulous portrayal of Teyve, the patriarch who witnesses his life come to an abrupt halt in the small town of Anatevka.
705;the music takes you through this tale of laughter and pathos, and tragedy, and in a very timeless way, it is sort of a history of the Jewish folks who have been persecuted throughout the centuries because they have been willing to pay the price for their own traditions and way of life, because it has been at odds with the rest of the world.
706;You can still see it being played out today in many parts of the world.
707;this is a wonderful and entertaining story, with a brilliant ensemble cast, and it will not only make you chuckle, but cry as well.
708;"The songs, from ""If I were a Rich Man,"" to ""To Life,"" to ""Matchmaker, Matchmaker,"" to ""Far from the Home I Love,"" are priceless and memorable, as is the story."
709;It's a wonderful addition to a film library, and highly recommended!!!
710;This is one of my all time favorite movies, and in high.
711;If you love Fiddler, you will love this Blu.
712;"The acting is good
713;The success of such a film depends too much on our willing suspension of disbelief.
714;That's why a musical like THE MUSIC MAN is so much more successful, stylistically.
715;I normally don't care for musicals, but I really liked this one.
716;It won three Academy Awards, including one for arranger .
717;It was nominated for a number of others, including Best Picture, Best Actior Chaim Yopolas Tevye and Best Supporting Actor for Leonartd Frey, who played Motel the Tailor( both had originally acted in the musical"
718;"Probably my favorite songs are ""Tradition"" and ""Matchmaker"" And ""Do You Love Me""Gunner May, 2008"
719;with arguably one of the best performances by an actor/singer.
720;The original of this play will never be outdone and if you were lucky enough to see the original stage play, consider yourself to have seen one of the greatest stage spectacles ever made.
721;Aside from the spirited singing and dancing, the film depicts The Bolshevik Revolution, a Siberian prison camp and generally the whole Russian Army fighting a revolution in expansive production values that at times equal the splendor of such grand movies as Lawrtence Of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago .
722;It seems the film should have only suggested these worldly details and remained focused on the gentleness and charm of the lead character and his domestic troubles.
723;Our family loves to watch this movie.
724;Humorous, but serous, sad but happy.
725;Have loved the movie since first seeing it in the 60's.
726;This ia a Great Move and My wife and I really enjoyed it.
727;Would recommend to anyone who is interested in History.
728;The songs, of course, are great.
729;Tovol was such a pleasure to watch.
730;He portrays such a compassionate father.
731;A great story that follows the emotions behind raising 5 girls, 3 of who were ready to marry but not via the traditional arranged marriage.
732;It is a heartfelt story that all should watch at least once.
733;It is funny, interesting, and informative on how the Russian Jews lived about 1900.
734;I love the Russian dance sequence in the bar scene.
735;topol gives an outstanding performance as a milkman who tries to keep his traditions, but keeps giving in.
736;Perfect on a rainy day, just laying back with the family and enjoying a wonderful timeless classic.
737;Great acting and the story is very interesting.
738;This is a classic and I hope to see the play again someday.
739;a friend of hers did this as a play, so we wanted to watch the actual movie.
740;This item is a great addition to my collection.
741;Love the movie the first time I watch it I love it ever since .
742;Some drama, funny and songs.
743;So important to have them appreciate many things this movie offers.
744;He was so excited to get it.
745;The remastered sound is absolutely incredible.
746;"These first two, together with ""Fiddler on the Roof"", are a great three."
747;Has to be one of the best plays ever.
748;He is a fiddler on the roof.
749;Fiddler on the Roof is a wonderful evocation of time and place, with a stellar cast.
750;The film is loaded with atmospheric detail and numerous darkly lit scenes, all tremendously improved by the high.
751;Having seen Fiddler several times over many years, the high.
752;definition version was a revelation, and almost like seeing the film for the first time.
753;released in 1971, Fiddler on the Roof is a perfect film for a high.
754;definition restoration, because the minute details, the colors and the many memorable songs are all given new life by Blu.
755;Whether you already love it, or have never seen it, this is a must.
756;the movie does a great job of depicting life as a jew during the onset of WW2.
757;And I love the songs.
758;Nothing beats a good oldie
759;Mind you, I am not a big fan of musicals, but this is one of my all time favorites and Topol is fantastic!
760;One of the best movies.
761;epic in plot, setting and length, Fiddler on the Roof tells a surprisingly tight and focused story that has universal poignancy.
762;If you want to understand the process of human evolution this movie is a must!
763;It both embraces and transcends Jewish life to elucidate the human condition.
764;A must relationship and ongoing conversation with that, which made you and a growth process that must be accepted, endured, mastered and evolved into in order to become a fully functioning human being.
765;Examining tradition and its merits and how they must always be subject to truth and logic superb!
766;It is a perfect training tool to prepare young children for the reality and realities of life.
767;I'm really happy to finally own it myself.
768;This is a movie that is REALLY important to see in color, or you miss all the details in the scenery.
769;music was excellent and costuming as well however I thought the plot could have been developed more in the area of sibling interface
770;If you love this movie, this is the way to see it.
771;The picture is beautiful, and sound is top notch.
772;There are no words to describe the wonderful movie that this is!
773;It will always be one of my favorites.
774;Topol is an excellent actor!
775;Suffering, humor, happiness, sadness, dancing, and singing are all intermingled within this movie!
776;This is definitely a Family classic.
777;One of the Best films that you can share with the family and friends.
778;This is real life issues that bring life from the Old country to life in that life we love and what changes our lives as we live them out.
779;It was a wonderful story with a beautiful moral for humanity, and how harmful tradition or religion can be on someone who is bound to this belief.
780;I grew up on this movie and I still enjoy watching it on a regular basis.
781;An old film of the double feature time with intermission music but no exit music is a great pleasure to reminisce about these old days.
782;She will get her father's blessing in extreme conditions.
783;We can and may believe in miracles.
784;"but the best part of the film is the music, the songs, one long and haunting tune ""If I were a rich man"" that comes back over and over again."
785;That's maybe a good song, though a little surprising and in some way a clich about the dream of all Jews to be rich one day.
786;The constant asking God to do something for these Jews, for this one in particular speaking now hence always coming from the concerned person sounds slightly like begging for God's help and favor.
787;when the community gets the order to leave within three days they accept their lot, pack and go.
788;This movie has always been a favorite of our family for years.
789;The beautiful songs and humor alongside several serious social issues, and the love of G. d and family all mix together to make a fantastic movie.
790;revolutionary Russian town of hardworking, faithful Orthodox Jews.
791;The film is a great family show that everyone will enjoy, a classic of classics that will continue to endure audiences for many a time to come.
792;The most noteable bonus feature is wonderful feature.
793;They provide an intriuging and insightful comments and recall suprising memories about making the film.
794;Also cool is the 8.
795;Amazing cultural understanding of what Jewish people have experienced in the way of hatred and a beautiful and bittersweet experience of family life.
796;Thank you for the fast service.
797;The music is great and the story very poignant!
798;Fiddler on the Roof is one of the movies I enjoy watching from time to time and wanted to be able to continue to do so.
799;One of the best movies of all time.
800;It had been many years since I viewed it and seeing it again after all of these years was almost like seeing it for the first time.
801;I'm not a musical lover, but this is an exception and I absolutely love this show.
802;The main character, Tevye is a milkman, a simple but honorable and a wise man who cares about his family.
803;During the course of the movie his three daughters get married and he struggles to balance tradition and family honor with his daughters wishes and happiness.
804;It's a beautiful and brilliant production.
805;Such a warm, comical, and sentimental story.
806;A top 20 all time favorite of mine.
807;He made fun of me at first then thought it was fun
808;Classic Movie, good for entire family.
809;Movie looks great, sounds great is great.
810;Good stuff, if I were a rich man.

812;the story is great about changing traditions.
813;Our kids liked ie, also.
814;There are musical numbers, memorable ones, but there is a truly engaging story also.
815;Topol gives us a great performance as we see his traditional ways tested with the marriages of some of his daughters.
816;Pogroms are moving people around or away, and this movie shows the effects on a village.
817;I found it very informative.
818;oK, the music will stick with you.
819;I music of Isaac Stern will stay with you also.
820;i would highly recommend seeing this movie.
821;excellent condition, and just before Christmas.

825;Amazon was so easy and the cheapest price.
826;old son loves to watch it over and over.
827;Lots of fun musical numbers, spectacular acting and script.
828;A bit sad at the end, but historically relevant.
829;A wonderful film to watch with the entire family.
830;Amazing music, beautifully shot, amazing performances, especially by Topol as Tevye.
831;Great seeing the young Paul Michael Glasser.
832;My Dad had five daughters too so I loved watching Tevia.

834;Loved watching it again with my kids.
835;Also great insight on the Jewish culture.
836;Kids danced and wanted to watch it again.
837;Good movei and well worth the investment.
838;The charactors are strong and the story line can stand on it's own.

840;All together with a great sound and image.
841;It is fiddler on the roof!
842;my son's favorite movie of all time .
843;Great characters great music n songs Great story about the poor treatment of Jews.
844;Fiddler is among the greatest motion pictures ever made.
845;This story of faith and human frailty can lead us to true conversion of our heart, if only we let God work that miracle within us.
846;The item was a good deal and shipped promptly.
847;I love this Movie and so did my husband.
848;I sent one to my sister and her Family and they loved it as well.
849;There are some really great (and funny) songs as well.
850;It's very enlightening, however, and it shows not just a glimpse of another culture, but the struggles encountered when cultures conflict.
851;Overall, I enjoy this film immensely.
852;It is funny, smart and insightful.
853;Take a chance, and watch with an open mind.
854;i would highly recommend to anyone but those who appreciate wonderful movie making in all aspects would also give it a 5 star rating
855;"contrast the almost conversational tone of ""Do you love me"" and the meditative ""Far from the home I love"" with the over."
856;top sort of singing in, say, Yentl.
857;This film captures a culture, yet is a musical, too.

888;this is an extraordinary movie.
889;When we finally got around to watching Fiddler on the Roof it played for 20 minutes or so and stopped.

898;The package arrived rather quickly to an APO via USPS and in good condition.
899;This is one of my wife's favorite musicals and I was happy to have found it for her so easily on Amazon.

901;I was pleasantly surprised that it ended so quickly this time, and I loved the film as an adult.
902;Topol does a great acting job.
903;I absolutely love this movie and the beautiful music that is such a part of it.
904;The music is wonderful and the story is just as good.
905;This is a great movie of an everyday people trying to simply live their lives in a backdrop of persecution that will continue to entertain viewers through the years.

911;The relationship between Israelite people in this film and God is amazing.
912;My kids love to watch it for the music and acting, but once the history of the story was explained, the movie took on a whole new meaning to them.
913;A true classic with the best actors.
914;This movie is a pure joy to behold.
915;In this day of Hollywood blockbusters bent on entertaining audiences with violence and nudity and vulgarity, it is so refreshing to see a movie with such a timeless and universal story.
916;Fiddler on the Roof makes life look so simple and wonderful.
917;The music is also a joy to behold.
918;musical, Yiddish adaptation of Sholem Aleichem's story, entitled Tevye, available from Amazon.
919;ray, when I found it at a good price, I got it.
920;It is a timeless classic.

922;I am very happy with the merchant.
923;happy to add this classic film to my collection.
924;"Hopefully MGM will do a restoration in the future and bring out an ""extra special edition"" (or something)."
925;Wonderful story line, good acting, all around enjoyable musical.
926;The music and songs are moving and memorable!
927;One to watch with the whole family.
928;Tevye and his family represent the typical Russian Jews of the time.

936;this movie is a true classic!
937;My family would all watch it together once a year, and we can pretty much recite the entire dialogue.
938;Great movie, powerful, and heart.
939;I'm glad to finally have a good copy of my very own.
940;This is one of the best musicals ever.
941;STill the best musical ever as far as I'm concerned.
942;good film, not all happy happy joy joy but it brings you into their lives and you ride the emotional roller coaster with them.
943;a wonderful movie, awesome sound track.
944;This movie is one of my favs.
945;easily top 20, possibly even top 10.
946;The acting is perfect, the setting is perfect and the songs?
947;Funny, and lighthearted in places as any good musical should be, but it does not steer away from the serious moments either.
948;I watched it on the suggestion of a friend, a man who was born in Poland during the interwar period into a very religious, observant Jewish family.
949;knit, loving family and its values, steeped in rich tradition, is something I find both enchanting and heartbreaking.
950;"i am not a lover of musicals in general, but this one captured my heart
951;I loved seeing the world of the Shtetl, which I have read a lot about, come to life.
952;the music was absolutely wonderful.
953;I especially liked """"Tradition,"""" which makes me smile whenenver I think about it, and the lovely """"Sunrise/Sunset,"""" so sweet and hopeful."""
954;It's a love story, and a history lesson, a plea for tolerance and a bittersweet glimpse of a beautiful way of life, all wrapped up in a magical, colorful, richly rendered and beautifully performed musical.
955;I really wanted to love this Blu.
956;I had waited for years for a really good, clean, crisp version of Fiddler On The Roof to come out.
957;It is one of the best movie musicals of all time.
958;ray technically is exactly what the folks at the movie company wanted it to be.
959;We wanted a sharp picture, with vivid colors.
960;There are some nice extra features on this Blu.
961;I love the discussion with John Williams about adapting the movie music for the big screen.
962;It was also good reminiscing with the daughters.
963;Then they take a movie as important as Fiddler On The Roof and can't even sync the sound and the picture consistently throughout the film.
964;The colors are actually pretty good.
965;If that's the case here, that's okay.
966;And for it to have the features that I paid for at the dealership.
967;But for an established movie, and a Blu.
968;"Perhaps it is a ""Jewish Film,"" perhaps it breaks through the barriers and everyone, regardless of their nationality, will feel the pain and the humor and the lifes of people who were always ready to move away from where they were to a place they don't know."
969;It's reflective of the times, customs and everyday life of the Jewish people who loved Mother Russia, but were hated by the Csar.
970;Yes my son, the Rabbi answered.
971;"The songs from Fiddler"" are still played at appropriate times (weddings, bar/bat mitzvas, deaths), but as far as I feel, the songs are always appropriate."
972;I hope you do too.
973;That got me to thinking if they'll ever do a remake.
974;Because, while their life is hard, it is also simple yet replete with an ethical standard.
975;In a strange way, that makes them rich, despite extreme hardship.
976;I love the music and the acting.
977;I wish I was a rich man.
978;Music is exceptional and so enjoyable.
979;Great for the whole family.
980;Always makes me smile and laugh.
981;I think that Tevia is great!
982;Rich man and Tradition are awesome songs.
983;A spirital, and physical experience.
984;"It is simply one of the best musicals of all time
985;always come back with the same observation: I can't get those songs out of my head!
986;It is a beautiful, haunting film of strength and hope, of courage and commitment.
987;Great movie about a time gone bye.
988;I don't think it is historically accurate but the signing is great.
989;Simply one of the best film adaptations of a musical ever made.
990;It's a wonderful movie and the songs are so fun to sing along with.
991;This is a classic to be enjoyed throughout years.
992;It has a light humorous storyline"
993;If you like musicals you will love this movie.
994;My family loves it and watches it often.
995;Thanks I love this movie and now I own it!
996;The hubby is really going to love it as a gift.
997;Great old time movie for my mom with lots of great music that she recognizes.
998;If you like musicals, this is a must see!
999;It has a great cast of characters and some very catchy songs.
1000;This is a wonderful movie, I received it in great condition, arrived quickly.
1001;I would highly recommend it to anyone.
1002;Colors are strong, but it seems to be a bit on the dark side to me.
1003;I think I read some time ago that the film was shot through a nylon stocking which gives it an overall cast of a flesh tone, extremely subtle, but it is there.
1004;I am a big believer in wide screen, and want to see all of the director's creation, and not some cut off version.
1005;as to the performance, this is one of the all time best musicals, superbly cast and photographed.
1006;I really caught the moment in time perfectly, while delivering some superb entertainment.
1007;Very rich movie from the acting to the singing to the songs being sung.
1008;I've always been an advocate for the modern cinematography.
1009;I produce music videos for modern musicians, and yet I am always short of the vital element that which is required in a true work of excellence.
1010;Absolutely brilliant and entertaining in every aspect, The Fiddler On the Roof is without a doubt one of the greatest examples of musical story.
1011;One of my all time favorite movies.
1012;Saw it as a kid and fell in love with the music ,story and family.
1013;This film was well done.
1014;I liked how it was easy to follow.
1015;it showed an important piece of Jewish culture, beautifully done with emotion, and sincerity.
1016;done very well and plays great too.
1017;If you love these type of musicals it well worth it.
1018;I very much enjoyed the broadway show and this did not disappoint.
1019;Fabulous story, music and dancing . . . completely entertaining and great for the whole family.
1020;I love musicals and this is one I grew up watching.
1021;The color and sound are perfect.
1022;This is one of the best movies ever made!
1023;ray version is just magnificent.
1024;A true joy to watch.
1025;tempered, gruff, cantankerous and sometimes plain annoying but if you look beyond his rough exterior you'll see that he really does love and care about his family.
1026;One of his most consistent traits is that in spite of having almost no spare time to read the scriptures as he often longs to, he carries on a constant conversation with God.
1027;in the leading roles simply because the iconic names would sell more tickets.
1028;He chooses his actors based on who is most suited for their parts regardless of their popularity or star status.
1029;dimensional performance in the leading role and won a richly merited oscar nomination although he didn't win it.
1030;(Julie Andrews losing out a Best Leading Actress nomination for Maria in The Sound of Music is a perfect example.)
1031;Topol can do more with a look in his eyes than most actors today can with an entire script.
1032;and where she tells him tearfully that her third daughter has married against their will is profoundly moving.
1033;All three elder daughters (Rosalind Harris, Michele Marsh and Neva Small) are very well cast.
1034;up, lipstick and bangs) they resemble real, plain, ordinary farm girls with freckles, moles, etc.) Usually, I like to see the actresses prettily made up, but here the gritty realism works perfectly.
1035;Leonard Frey is solid as Motel the Tailor.
1036;Molly Picon is hilarious as the eccentric matchmaker Yente.
1037;The best (and most powerfully done) scenes were:1.
1038;The expression on Golde's face during this scene is well worth watching.

1280;I agree with HeadbangerDuh in every sense.
1281;This is the best of musicals.
1282;While some other musicals amy be corny, boring, and downright dumb, Fiddler shows humor, interest, and is educational.
1283;Although part one is funnier, part two I feel is richer, and more full, not as goofy.
1284;This is probably the best film of the century.
1285;One of our favorite classics.
1286;A must see that I have watched many times and will enjoy again and again!

1294;Tevye, who is friends with the town's non.

1296;"* ""Do You Love Me"" as sung by Tevye and Golda, questioning each other's love for one another."
1297;"it is no wonder that ""Fiddler on the Roof"" won 3 Oscars for Best Cinematography (the film was shot mostly in Croatia, former Yugoslav republic), Best Original Music (courtesy of John Williams) and Best Sound."
1298;The film was also nominated for Best Picture, Topol was nominated for Best Actor, Leonard Frey was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Norman Jewison was nominated for Best Director.
1299;ray because it's security measures make access and resume play so difficult, but the picture is wonderful, the message timeless, the performances terrific.

1303;The music is great, lyrics and tunes.
1304;The dialogue is witty and fresh.

1317;This classic movie at an unreal price!

1319;The oldest girl is in love with the village tailor, and they eventually marry.
1320;Our family is bound for the US.
1321;time favorite musical, both on the stage and on film.
1322;This is a story of tradition, love and marriage in a Jewish family living in the face of persecution in Tsarist Russia at the beginning of the 20th century.
1323;Director Norman Jewison's treatment of this story is wonderfully sensitive.

1333;I have always loved this movie.
1334;THE movie during the wedding scene froze thengot stuck.
1335;It is a movie I saw as a teenager and still enjoy watching today.
1336;Fiddler On The Roof is without a doubt the best ever musical!
1337;It has great actors, cool characters, unforgettable songs and fun plots.
1338;It's great how Tzeitel and Hodel convince Tevye to let them choose who they marry.
1339;And all of the songs show feelings, some are happy like Miracle Of Miracles or Tradition and some are sad like Far From The Home I Love .
1340;Some of the characters are really funny like Yente, or very serious like Golde.
1341;And there are a lot of funny parts in the movie, like when the lesson of Laban cheating on Jacob was Never trust your employer , or when Motel's 'new arrival' was a sewing machine, although he and Tzeitel did have a baby.
1342;And the dream the Tevye pretends to have is absolutely hilarious!
1343;All of these are reasons why I liked this musical, and I think you'll like it too!
1344;I recommend this to anybody!
1345;The performances are magnificent aside from the music score.
1346;This is the best musical movie EVER!
1347;not only is it a great musical overall, the actors and the setting and, and, and.
1348;line, and of course the best place to find things such as this is Amazon.

1350;I love having my own copy of this classic story!
1351;The music is wonderful and the story enjoyable!If I were a rich man, Sunrise sunset.
1352;I enjoyed seeing Reptevia adjust to new ideas within his family and the changing times.

1360;ray the sound,picture is amazing!
1361;I am happy with the collector's edition of Fiddler On The Roof.
1362;Fiddler on the Roof is one of the greatest films ever made!
1363;Topol is excellent as Tevye, a poor milkman whose love, pride, and faith help him face the oppression of turn.
1364;I suggest you see Fiddler on the Roof right away if you have not seen it!
1365;Both the books and musical are considered cultural icons.
1366;The children are there to carry on traditions of the family.
1367;She is at the age that she must marry soon.
1368;Yenta has found a great match, well at least he's well off.

1372;"But Fyedka, an ""outsider"" farmer, comes to her rescue."
1373;They begin to see each other.
1374;After a life together the village disperses.
1375;this movie is one of the last great movie musicals.
1376;Director Norman Jewison took what he learned from directing TV variety shows and the great movies of the 60's to make a truly evocative film about the oppressive life of Jews in Russia.
1377;Even though this film is bleak it also shows the hope that all the people of that time lived with.
1378;from a technical view, the score is one of the best.
1379;Much of the production design is actual locations in Yugoslavia.
1380;A 49 minute National Film Board of Canada documentary on Jewison and the filming of Fiddler.
1381;This has an into by Jewison and also a side by side viewing of a portion of the number.
1382;The comparisons are always great to see.
1383;The best is the animated souvenir program which shows the entire souvenir program page by page.
1384;I remember seeing this as a young girl with my family.
1385;I love sharing with my family and singing along with all the songs.
1386;My kids have a small glimpse into history and are intrigued by it.
1387;Sing a long and enjoy!
1388;Glad to see a classic.
1389;I wanted to share this with the younger generation to see if it is still enjoyable.
1390;its a musical but the songs tell part of the story.
1391;'Fiddler on the Roof' is an exception to the rule, with a story that is very compelling and songs that are catchy.
1392;aside from a great story and music the cinematography is beautiful and as 3 hour films go, this one breezes by like a warm afternoon.
1393;This film has made me want to see more musicals and I can only hope they will all be this good.
1394;I enjoyed watching it as a child, and love it now!
1395;I wish I were a rich man
1396;I bought this movie for myself and my children to enjoy on cold winter afternoons or evenings.
1397;"It is so fun to hear my kids singing, ""If I were a rich man."
1398;Fiddler is one of those movies that is lasting and worthwhile to watch again and again.
1399;This movie is a pure joy to behold.
1400;In this day of Hollywood blockbusters bent on entertaining audiences with violence and nudity and vulgarity, it is so refreshing to see a movie with such a timeless and universal story.
1401;Fiddler makes life look so simple and wonderful.
1402;I give my highest recommendations to all people of all faiths to watch this movie.
1403;I own it and my whole family loves it, so does my 10 y/o!
1404;This goes against everything he believes in and his struggle to come to terms with the changes around him is both hilarious and poignant to watch.
1405;one of the best musicals ever made.
1406;Topol was a great Tevya.
1407;This film is one of my favorites and I am so glad to be able to watch it on my Kindle Fire!
1408;Everybody who has seen Fiddler on the Roof know what a great movie it is.
1409;I enjoy watching it again and again.
1410;Fiddler on the Roof looks terrific on blu.
1411;Good actors and a good story about one of Russia's pogroms, showing how it affected decent people.
1412;A very worthwhile movie about how some people came to be in America, or Israel or somewhere else.
1413;ray player is a high end Samsung and it plays all of my other Blu.
1414;"I have searched for this film a good while now
1415;My pastor had quoted from the story in one of his sermons and peaked my interest.
1416;The messages in the songs are timeless as well as being memorable.
1417;The song to his daughter when she was to be married is so poignant and could be what any father might want to say for his daughter.
1418;I love it and watch every few years.
1419;Beautiful story, with music to match.
1420;Very pleased with collector's set!!
1421;It's important to watch videos as a family once in a while.
1422;this is a classical movie and I know it has depth in its story and acting.
1423;Also the entire story is beautiful!
1424;Excellent and so memorable music.
1425;Had much more appreciation for the flow and drama of history this time.
1426;This story is timeless, human, and so moving that I am in tears at Isaac Stern's first notes on the violin!
1427;This movie belongs in everyone's video library.
1428;Beautifully remastered, shot with the eye of the masters on canvas, cast mostly with perfectly attuned actors, but the wildness of the stage, the heat of the in your face presentation live is so difficult to maintain in a film.
1429;But, it's like complaining about a terrific dinner that needed a bit more creative cooking and some extra spice.
1430;The music is wonderful, the story still breaks the heart and allows us to crack a smile.
1431;and who knows, one day this will be the only history of the original musical, so at least they all did their heartfelt best.
1432;Fiddler on the roof is by far one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of our time.
1433;Through this movie you will see that tradition may not be the most important bind holding together a family but the families individuality that makes it strong.
1434;Countless thumbs up for Jerry Bock's Fiddler on the Roof !
1435;I love this movie, and everything about it.
1436;The music, the emotion, the scenery, the performances.
1437;The casting of Topol in the lead role was mastery, which has led the way for this film to become one of the greatest musicals of all times.
1438;With the 50th anniversary of Fiddler on the Roof coming up in New York this June, this is a great way to share with the family the revival of a great classic.
1439;This is not really my style, but everyone knows this is a classic, so I'm sure it's great.
1440;This movie is as moving as when it first came out.
1441;Great educational tool for music and history teachers alike.
1442;Fiddler on the Roof is a cinematic masterpiece.
1443;Originally a musical, this movie is an amazing adaptation that remains faithful to the original, while at the same time not making it seem theatrical to the point where it looks contrived.
1444;The characters are played perfectly with Topol (who plays Tevye, the poor village milkman) taking the highest honors.
1445;fiddler on the Roof is simply a timeless story, even if it finds itself placed in czarist Russia.
1446;This film follows Tevye in his journey to meld his rich Jewish past with the modern world that surrounds him.
1447;are priceless and allow us to relate with Tevye as he struggles with his heritage (the pogroms), his financial status ( If I Were a Rich Man ) and his family (his daughters are entering marrying age).
1448;The songs are poignant and easily remembered.
1449;I guarantee that you'll wind up singing/humming Tradition or If I Were a Rich Man days after watching the movie.
1450;The cinematics are also extraordinary, with the film being shot on location in Zagreb, Yugoslavia.
1451;this is an ideal family movie, and I can remember watching (and loving) this movie at an early age.
1452;sided and contains additional footage, an additional song (cut at production) and a commentary on the movie itself.
1453;This is one of those movies you just have to have in your collection.
1454;Fiddler is one of my favorite musicals.
1455;I was very happy to finally own a copy and view the anniversary bonus material.
1456;The Bottom Line:Fiddler on the Roof is really long and plays as such sometimes, but the movie looks gorgeous, is acted well, and offers spirited renditions of songs that most of us know by now: recommended to musical.
1457;Love the musicals of a by.
1458;Great family oriented musical dealing with relationships in the 1900's.
1459;Time and place may change but relationships still are an important part of family life.
1460;Excellent movie, a classic, something you need to watch every year with you family and the stupid people, so they can be educated with this.
1461;The tragic ending does leave hope in one as the family moves from Russia to America.
1462;A great movie for the mature which you could watch with your children as some of the content will not be understood, thankfully, by the innocent.
1463;Topol was by far the best """"Tevye"""", in this classic story of Jewish Life in early 19th century Russia."""
1464;The movie adaptation of the most famous play on Broadway, added a totally new dimension to the story.
1465;I have seen live performances of Fiddler, at least a dozen times in my life.
1466;Topol shines as Tevye in the phenomenal musical that follows his life.
1467;You'll laugh and cry and sing along (at least you'll sing along after you have seen it as many times as I have).
1468;It is quite long, which may discourage some, but it is worth it.
1469;This should rate as one of the top ten MUST SEE movies for all those who would like to understand more about not just Jewish history, but the history of every group persecuted in known ages.
1470;A wonderful classic movie that can be watched over and over and you will never get tired of it.
1471;this is is a great musical production.
1472;i would also recommend if you love musicals Man of La Mancha and Jesus Christ Super Star.
1473;com is a great way to keep your movies and be able to watch them anytime.
1474;This is one of the most outstanding musicals of all time.
1475;This movie version is the best and Topol does it like no other
1476;arrived promptly in excellent condition.
1477;thanks for keeping a classic alive.
1478;Love this movie, demonstrates so much so beautifully.
1479;keeps you interested over and over again.
1480;This is a great movie with a message we should all remember.
1481;I bought this as a gift for my Grandson as he was going to play a part in the High School play.
1482;It was a good way for him to practice at home too.
1483;I was blown away by this movie and was moved to tears and laughter!
1484;There are several scenes that are so well.
1485;done that I would call them the best scenes ever made, of all time!
1486;The scene where Tevye is recalling memories of his little girl, whom he has now lost forever to the Russian, is one of the best pieces of filmmaking I have ever scene.
1487;The whole movie is just amazing and wonderful.
1488;the scenes where he is debating with God on the other hand about whether he should accept the marriages of his daughters were some of the best moments in filmmaking also.
1489;I would also be moved to tears when he would say, Look at my daughter's eyes, she loves him, so hopeful.
1490;Those were really touching moments.
1491;It was wonderful how the filmmakers would move Tevye farther away from the daughters at those moments, as if he were far away, deep in thought.
1492;the whole movie is beautifully made.
1493;The clothing and settings are very appropriate and don't give the viewer any indication of when the movie was made (like some 50's movies do with the heavy makeup the women would wear).
1494;The characters were very funny and likeable.
1495;The song is a fine song and would have worked well, but I suppose it was in the interest of time that they deleted it.
1496;An all time must see classic.
1497;Must see for all ages between 13 and 90.
1498;If you have seen it a thousand times, it's worth watching another 2 or 1000 times.
1499;Watch this and love the songs If I were a Rich man.
1500;This is a movie for ALL ages.
1501;Gives great insight into whole theme of tradition .
1502;It has been many years since I've seen it.
1503;Now I keep humming the songs.
1504;If I was a rich man :)
1505;This is Topol being so brilliant that he really becomes a Jew in Czarist Russia.
1506;His voice and his diction are excellent, and the supporting caste are all good.
1507;It is very funny at times, and the songs are great.
1508;This is a musical and much of the interaction and communication between the characters occurs in the song lyrics!
1509;The music makes you feel light and good at times and sadder emotions other times.
1510;Was a great family opportunity.
1511;Wonderful film, saw this film many years ago at the drive.
1512;great performance's, especially from Topol who seems to have almost made a career out of playing the lead character on stage.
1513;wonderful music, humour, drama, just a great film.
1514;I've always loved this movie.
1515;I love the music and the message the movie makes.
1516;This production is certainly a gem.
1517;Whether you just like musicals, or interested in history, or enjoy a fine acting work .
1518;This is one of the best musicals ever.
1519;The performances, direction and photography are awesome.
1520;Fiddler on the Roof has always been one of my favorite musicals.
1521;I also believe that this is one of the very few adaptations of a Broadway musical that worked on film.
1522;I always laugh at Topol's dramatic, yet unabashedly witty portrayal of Tevye.
1523;One of the several important aspects that glue this film together is the wonderful Bock/Harnick musical score that includes If I Were A Rich Man Sunrise, Sunset and the sweet duet Do you Love me?
1524;, while the other side is chock.
1525;full of substantial extras, documentaries, as well as Tevye's Dream in full color.
1526;One feature I particularly enjoy is a documentary on director Norman Jewison.
1527;You really get to see the genius in his use of realism, rather than broad comedy, to bring forth a new aspect of the realities of the characters.
1528;This, by far, is my favorite movie.
1529;It has absolutely everything in it.
1530;the story is very realistic, and that makes it enjoyable.
1531;I have to say also that the actors are very well.
1532;You can die from such a man.
1533;I love this movie and I highly recommend it.
1534;I'm asking myself why there are so many movies about good jewish people and their traditions.
1535;I can recall now Schindlers list, the pianist, Munich, Life is Beautiful, Holocaust, Diary of Anne Frank, and a lot moe.
1536;I received this video and played it.
1537;Loved the movie, but hard to watch with skipping!
1538;Good story line, wonderful actors, entertaining.
1539;Great movie for a Saturday afternoon on the couch with a bowl of popcorn.
1540;If you like this movie, and want to own it, this is an excellent option.
1541;Good audio and good video.
1542;I have the Broadway musical in my own library but I like this 1971 movie better.
1543;Watched this with my 8 year old granddaughter.
1544;A nice way to introduce her to some history.
1545;After purchasing this film and viewing it with my kids, we we were full of emotions.
1546;We laughed, cried, felt sadness and angered.
1547;I highly recommend this movie to anyone, no wonder it received many awards.
1548;to begin with, it comes on a single disk, with the movie on one side and the extra material on the other.
1549;A minor complaint, perhaps, but highly relevant to the senior generation to which my wife and I belong .
1550;the very same generation that is a big part of the market for this movie.
1551;and why do that with such an important classic?
1552;So, I'm docking this edition a star for it's inconvenient format, and I certainly hope this one.
1553;on the plus side, the many interesting extras include a very nice background piece, narrated by director Norman Jewison, explaining the history of Jews under the Russian Tzar, the Pale of Settlement, the pattern of village life, the various social strata, etc., such as portrayed in the film.
1554;Great cultural movie with a cross.
1555;Love the dialogue throughout of tradition vs. modern as new is introduced to old.
1556;This was the original I had seen years ago.
1557;most wonderful movie, very educational.

1559;great for children to learn from
1560;It is a great movie and I am happy to own it.
1561;Great dialogue, great characters, interesting setting and historical interest.
1562;The dancing, the singing, the romance, this musical has it all!
1563;This is such a great movie in so many ways.
1564;A movie has to reach into my heart and deeply move my emotions in some profound way.
1565;It also addresses the deepest love that anybody ever has.
1566;to top it off, this movie inspired me to love God more.
1567;Tevya talks to God like a friend, and he really inspired me to love God as my friend and talk to Him kind of like Tevya.
1568;A most enjoyable musical that has considerable historical value in it.
1569;We especially enjoyed the reasoning displayed in this film.
1570;excellent disc with extra options and story about the making of film
1571;This classic has endured time with a story of love, tragedy, comedy and excitement combined with outstanding musical scores for all generations.

1589;I watch it at least once a year.
1590;This particular verson is great.
1591;And, the story is a classic.
1592;watching this film finally led me to wonder who had written such a great story and developed the character of Tevye.
1593;He is the creator of Tevye the Dairyman.
1594;The character in the musical is an excellant portrayal of the character described in Sholom Aleichem's book.
1595;the songs written by Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick are classics also.
1596;It can be watched and enjoyed over and over.
1597;It is worth every penny and I'm a penny watcher.
1598;It was interesting to field their questions as the play unfolded.

1600;My wife and I enjoyed the acting by the father, mother and all the supporting characters.
1601;The storyline was very good.
1602;Sound mildly subdued, but still rich and vibrant.
1603;All in all a very pleasant movie experience.
1604;It's hard to imagine that anyone could write such an uplifting, beautiful musical about anti.
1605;It's impeccably cast with the lead role of Tevye, the town's milkman, played by Topol.
1606;Unlike some recent Hollywood musicals, i. e. Les Miserables, all of the principles easily carry off the singing and acting their roles require and the music is beautiful.
1607;I enthusiastically recommend this for your listening and viewing pleasure.
1608;A great movie to see again and again.
1609;There is a moral to the story and story to follow and fall in love with the characters.

1614;"'Fiddler on the Roof' is one of the finest movies ever produced by Hollywood

1616;The musical performance is as good as should be expected considering that one of the finest violinists of all time played it.
1617;the acting, particularly by Topol is also outstanding and his singing is adequate and appropriate for the part.
1618;The supporting actors all performed well.
1619;over all a very satisfying production!

1650;It manages to tell a rather somber story while being entertaining at the same time.

1652;At the beginning, he addresses us, the audience.
1653;In the remainder of the film, he interacts with each of the other characters and, most notably, with God, to whom he addresses his pleas.

1656;norma Crane plays Tevye's wife Golde, who both loves and tolerates him, all at once.
1657;Rosalind Harris plays Tevye's eldest daughter of five, Tzeitel, in a beautiful performance of quiet understatement.
1658;His performance is so full of vitality that it's amazing to me that FIDDLER ON THE ROOF was the very last film he would ever do.
1659;Lastly, it is of note that future Starsky and Hutch star Paul Michael Glaser (here billed simply as Michael Glaser) makes a notable film debut as Communist revolutionary Perchik, who wins the hand of Tevye's second.
1660;The eldest calls into question the tradition of arranged marriages and the second calls into question the tradition of marrying an observant Jew (who himself calls into question the ancient rules of intergender public activity, such as dancing).
1661;with all of its subplots and activity, FIDDLER ON THE ROOF leaves you with much about which to think.
1662;For all of its musical bombast, it contains much in the way of thoughtfulness.
1663;Perhaps most importantly, it captures a people and their era that is so distantly removed from our own.
1664;It also contains some beautiful music by Isaac Stern, who gives such an idelible musical voice to the titular character in this thoroughly remarkable, classic film.
1665;This is a classic must see musical for the entire family.

1670;'Fiddler on the Roof' is a powerful statement about the evils of prejudice and the importance of maintaining a warm and communicative family life in the midst of severe oppression.
1671;'Fiddler on the Roof' is about love and fear, devotion and defiance, persecution and poverty, pride and dignity, sorrow and oppression.
1672;The songs evoke happiness and tears.
1673;The fiddler's hauntingly beautiful music came from the violin of the world's greatest virtuosos, Isaac Stern.
1674;Composer Jerry Bock and lyricist Sheldon Harnick captured the drama and conflict of the story from its incisive opening to, ultimately, the powerfully silent human circle at the very end.
1675;Their treatment of the music produced some outstanding hits like 'Tradition.
1676;''Tradition' is more than a simple musical number.

1694;the movie sets are exquisite and I don't use this term lightly.
1695;Even though it happens around a poverished village, it goes to show how rich and rewarding people can still live within those realms.
1696;the music is so apart of the story and general mood, it doesnt matter if one is a movie musical fan or not.
1697;I have always enjoyed the original musical, and find Topol's Tevye in this movie to be more complex compared to Zero Mostel's larger than life characterization, which is perfect for this format.
1698;The songs are great and the ensemble does great work!
1699;I recommend this for fans of the play and musicals.
1700;It is a classic and I absolutely love every minute song actor all of it.
1701;This is a very well done film and provides a view of life for the Russian Jews of that period.
1702;The selection of actors was excellent.
1703;I remember seeing this movie in the theatre when I was 7 and it has become such a part of my life that it qualifies for a religious service to watch it.

1713;And Do you love me is such a cool song.
1714;Fiddler on the roof is one of the small group of musical movies that remains entertaining every time I view it.
1715;I have seen this movie about four times and certainly plan to do so again.
1716;A wonderful retelling of the Broadway production.
1717;Topol is flawless as the dairyman who talks to God and Rosalind Harris (Barbra Streisand look alike)is astounding as his eldest daughter.
1718;It is beautifully filmed on locations in Yugoslavia.
1719;This movie is the best of the fiddler on the roof movies .

1731;On my top ten of all time.
1732;You can see that we're a big fan.
1733;Their is lots to learn from this show.
1734;This is one of my favorite musicals.
1735;The songs, some humorous , some heart breaking, are brilliantly interwoven into the story line.
1736;It is easy to feel and see how life was for Jews living in Russia before the Revolution.
1737;The main focus is on one of these families, seen through their timeless traditions.
1738;The local commissar, seen early on as sympathetic to the Jews, receives some disturbing orders from the Central Government.
1739;This movie, even for those who dislike musicals will hold your interest from beginning to end.
1740;Fiddler on the Roof is a timeless classic for all people.
1741;No matter what your ethnic background, you will be able to relate to this wonderful story of life.
1742;This is the kind of movie that can be enjoyed over and over again!
1743;It's a classic for sure, that you can watch time and again.
1744;A family movie too, in spite of the deeper thematic plot that may not be easily understood by the younger ones.
1745;A movie for the whole family with heart and love for everyone to enjoy.
1746;In addition to the beautiful songs, it is the always.
1747;moving story of a loving home maintained by the Jewish couple amidst poverty and persecution.
1748;Particularly touching is the struggle of the father to reconcile his tradition with the changing conditions of modern life, where children assert themselves and shape their own lives.
1749;This movie is a wonderful classic that contains a lesson concerning change versus tradition and the impacts of both on a small town Jewish community in the Ukraine.
1750;What I received was a two.
1751;The deleted song is outstanding and the interviews of the actresses who played the three oldest daughters is a real treat.
1752;Mostel, who is not a singer but a comedian, played the role for laughs.
1753;Topol brings a voice and a gravitas that does Bashevis Singers's story justice.
1754;Topol's Tevye is a man who believes he is living as G. d commands him to, and is bewildered at why the world won't let him keep on living that way.
1755;He does not like how the world is changing, but his duty compels him to survive in it and to protect the traditions that made his life meaningful.
1756;The scenery, the sets, the costuming are all painstakingly accurate to the region and time.
1757;There is one tiny glitch.
1758;Loved this movie the first time I saw it years and years ago, love it today.
1759;It's a movie you can watch over and over.
1760;I have realy enjoyed the movie and will repeatedly watch it.
1761;i invited a wheelchair bound neighbor to share the viewing and had pizza while watching.
1762;This is definitely a movie for all ages.
1763;She watched it with my daughter maybe a week before and loved it so much that she asked to watch it again with me.
1764;I highly recommend this movie for everyone.
1765;This movie, along with Sound of Music, Hello Dolly (the original)Oklahoma and My Fair Lady to name a few, deserve to be seen with Blu.
1766;ray of this movie, and must say, Blu.
1767;mastering, allows for it to be seen just as if you were on the set.
1768;If you have NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE please, please do so, especially in Blu.
1769;It's not rock and roll, it's not preachy, just an outstanding musical story with depth.
1770;It's even better with a proper surround sound.
1771;Excellent movie!I have always loved this movie and enjoyed viewing it with friends who had never seen it.
1772;I've seen this on the stage a few times, and always enjoyed it.
1773;I was very pleased when the movie was made.
1774;but the movie still managed to be moving and funny, and the musical parts are great.
1775;fashioned for some, but I recommend it for most.
1776;I grew up with Fiddler on the Roof and I love all of the songs and the movie.
1777;Topol is a perfect Tevye.
1778;I found it at a very good price and then shipped it directly tohim without a problem.
1779;I heartily recommend this video that deals with changes in family structure,culture and politics.
1780;The music is beautiful and the acting superior.
1781;It is so great because the story stands on its own .
1782;Since it does have such a great soundtrack, it's even better!
1783;here the music is seamlessly integrated that it seems normal for them to continue the story through music.
1784;The rest of the cast is great and the direction is spot.
1785;highly recommended, not just as a musical, but as a wonderful movie about people dealing with traditions in an ever.
1786;changing world and the loving compromises they make.
1787;I can see why it is a classic.
1788;Somber story yet hopeful about life.
1789;I grew up knowing this musical and love this movie.
1790;My wife and I have loved this movie for a long time.
1791;This was an entertaining film about a group of Russian peasants and the hardships and prejudice they face because they are Jews.
1792;The musical numbers in this film are awe.
1793;inspiring, the actors, especially the protagonist Tevye the Milkman are well portrayed.
1794;"Songs such as `If I were a rich man"" and ""Tradition"" will inspire you and leave you tapping your feet or clapping your hands."
1795;The director Norman Jewson, Tevye's Topol and all of the actors, including Tevye's horse are doing a great job.
1796;My favorite performer there is Molly Picon, you night watch it more than once to really appreciate her work.

1802;My daughter is in a chorus group and they are singing many of these songs for their performance.
1803;Her teacher recommended they watch it to get a better understanding of the music.
1804;Good For: Families with older children (especially families tired by syrupy stories), creative viewers, persons who love historical fiction, music buffs.
1805;this film compares to the live Broadway musical, with memorable performance moments.
1806;Norman Jamison's film effects capture the live musical well and creatively.
1807;"The cinematography is beautiful
1808;put by antiquated film effects, but it is alarmingly realistic.
1809;This must be digitally remastered as it is sharp and clear even on our large screen.
1810;watchers will enjoy the performance techniques.
1811;All said, the music still goes into the """"gut"""""
1812;"our children are nine and thirteen and loved the story

1863;The music in this movie is absolutely beautiful and timeless.
1864;And not only that, but a great and powerful film.
1865;Tevye, who is a poor milk man, struggles with keeping the Jewish faith, all in the face of overwhelming prejudice, changing moral codes, and sweeping political ideas.
1866;An important lesson, especially today.
1867;Alfred Molina played Tevye and I loved it.

1895;Our family really enjoyed seeing this classic again.
1896;It was actually much better than we remembered.
1897;The musical numbers just fit in beautifully instead of interrupting story like so many other musicals.
1898;we also had a much better understanding of the story with more maturity and knowledge of everything the Jewish people have suffered.
1899;He has the most practice at it .
1900;The music and songs are great!
1901;This was my Mother's favorite film and I just recently saw the Fiddler on the Roof on stage at our local theater company and it was just as great as this film!
1902;Wish my Mother was still with me to see this film again!
1903;This movie is a classic.
1904;The music and story are very engaging.
1905;I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys musicals.
1906;A classic movie based very closely on the Broadway play, it is excellently produced, acted, and filmed.
1907;Simply one of the best stories ever told with music and lyrics beloved by generations.
1908;I picked it up as part of her Christmas gift.
1909;"Had forgotten many of the great songs in this musical production and the parts casting is excellent
1910;This is my all time favorite movie.
1911;Having it on Kindle Fire will allow me to watch it anytime, anywhere, including on flights.
1912;I enjoy the story and the characters are so believable and likeable.
1913;Came in a timely manner.
1914;Its my mothers favourite movie so I decided to get her for Christmas and I'm really excited to give her!
1915;Now I watch it often with my family and we enjoy it more every time.
1916;I ordered this movie for my children to watch due to them being in a production of this movie for their local playhouse.
1917;They enjoy it and have watched it several times.
1918;I watched it with them and couldnt believe I waited so long to own this wonderful movie.
1919;I knew a lot of the music though.
1920;It was entertaining, heartbreaking, but always hopeful.
1921;This is an excellent movie, such passion, joy, love, and sorrow.
1922;The songs are memorable, the acting is great, and there are some very funny parts.
1923;Fiddler on the Roof is one of the greatest works for the theater of all time.
1924;The story is one of extroidinary importance, and one that has entertained ever since opening on Broadway on September 22, 1964.
1925;The story is so engrossing, so I will tell no more of the plot, as to not spoil for you the joys of first viewing it yourself.
1926;I must say, however, that Topol is a marvel as the lovable Tevye.
1927;He is a perfect match to the character.
1928;his performance is both funny and touching.
1929;I laugh every time I see him dance while singing the famous If I Were A Rich Man .
1930;His performance is one for the ages.
1931;the supporting performances are all extroidinary!
1932;Norma Crane is very sincere and fabulous as Golde, Tevye's wife.
1933;Their performances are all sentimental and heartfelt.
1934;Their rendition of Matchmaker is priceless.
1935;Leonard Frey is also great as Motel, the tailor and one of the girl's love interests.
1936;Nevertheless, he sings a great rendition of Miracles of Miracles .
1937;Every one of the songs in Fiddler on the Roof is incredible.
1938;and the haunting, beautifully written Sunrise, Sunset .
1939;Fiddler on the Roof is an incredible story with incredible music.
1940;Believe me, you will love this American Masterpiece.
1941;It is not just one of the greatest musicals ever written, it is one of the best movies of all.
1942;If you're lucky enough to have it still, be wise enough to visit it often.
1943;Fiddler on the Roof tells the story of Tevya, and his family, coming to grips with changes in a small village Tzarist Russia.
1944;the music is classic .
1945;Tradition, Sunrise Sunset, L'haim to name a few.
1946;Well worth catching those as well.
1947;An incredible tale of heroism!
1948;Topol is perfect as Tevye.
1949;In the film, he makes me laugh and cry, love him and hate him.
1950;The music is stunning and John Williams' orchestarations are first rate.
1951;The cinematography captures the raw essence of the movie, rather harsh and cruel.
1952;Perhaps the best thing in the movie is Isaac Stern's violin playing.
1953;The dream sequence along with fabulous dance sequences, lead me to my final conclusion that I would rate this in the top 5 movies of all time.
1954;Though the movie shows the life of the Jews amidst the others, it shows the transition of life in that part of the world.
1955;The movie is wonderful in its humor, especially Tevye's conversations with God and his interpretations of the Bible.
1956;The songs in the movie are beautiful and haunting with violinist Isaac Stern doing his magic.
1957;Right from """"Tradition"""" which shows why he believes in his religion to the aching """"Matchmaker, matchmaker"""" where you can hear the longing in the girls voices, each song is unique."""
1958;"the humor is fantastic, when one person reads bad news, people tell him ""Why should I care about the outside world?"
1959;"Let the outside world grow its own head"" Now Tevye responds, ""He is right, if you spit in the air, it lands in your face."""
1960;"Tevye says now, ""He is right too""."
1961;"Now the first person says ""He is right and he is right, they cannot both be right."""
1962;Tevye's shrewish wife Golde also does a superb job in the acting.
1963;The longing with which they remember their times there shows us that happiness is something of the inside.
1964;While a lot of the movie may not appeal to people who may not understand the times and the context, the Tsar, the coming of the revolution in Russia and the Pogroms, those who can relate to it will adore this movie, both for the story and for the songs.
1965;Despite this, it is an outstanding movie.
1966;Everything about it is superb and in blu.
1967;ray it is even better.
1968;But I really liked it more than I thought I would.
1969;One of the best musicals out there.
1970;In fact, one of the best movies, IMO.
1971;ray comes with some good bonus features.
1972;It's interesting decades later to see some of the actors when they were younger.
1973;fiddler is a beautiful story of hope and tradition that we never get tired watching.
1974;thank you, the movie was very helpful to a teenage boy who never saw the movie or play and he was very excited to receive the movie from grandma.
1975;This is a good movie and story to study prejudice and Tradition.
1976;The songs are all very memorable, some more so than others.

1993;Suitable for the whole family.
1994;I bought this movie as a gift for a relative.
1995;I saw a stage performance of this and it was incredible.
1996;I have also seen the movie version as well.
1997;This is a movie worth watching several times.
1998;Fiddler on the Roof is a classic, clean fun movie with much history!
1999;I am not into musicals but this one I just love!
2000;You won't go wrong by watching his brilliant movie about life, it's traditional hardships and it's joys.
2001;A must see for new generations so oblivious to classic movie screen art.
2002;Excellent acting and memorable songs.
2003;Fiddler on the Roof is one of my all time favorite musicals.
2004;Topol as Tevia is wonderful.
2005;My favorite scene is Tevia's dream.
2006;This is a perfect work of art, no other movie version should be made.
2007;This movie brought back a lot of memories.
2008;I first saw the film at school as a child, and been in love with it ever since.
2009;Saw this many years ago and was able to relive the experience with my Kindle Fire.
2010;recommend the Kindle to see many of the oldoes.
2011;This motion pictures takes one on a family journey.
2012;Even if one's roots are not Jewish or from eastern Europe the story is so universal.
2013;love, romance, family dictating who one should marry, marrying for sense or sensibility, etc. that all can enjoy.
2014;Plus the music is magnificent!
2015;Wonderful movie full of music and rich history.
2016;Very long, so make sure you have plenty of time to enjoy!
2017;Topol shines and is supported by a stellar cast.
2018;My entire family gathers in front of the TV to watch this story .
2019;full of joy and pathos.
2020;the musci is great, the scenery is beautiful, the story teaches life lessons without being preachy.
2021;This is one of my favorite movies.
2022;i always enjoy seeiing Tevya's Dream sequence.you won't be disappointed.
2023;This musical is well worth seeing, I would recommend it.
2024;this is a musical that everyone would enjoy and want it see again.
2025;One of the best movies ever made.
2026;"I showed it to my Bible class
2027;Fiddler on the Roof is an essential for any home library!
2028;Aside from being a valuable historical record for Jewish families, this Classic will provide a mesmerizing look into a lifestyle in the """"Pale"""" of Pre."""
2029;It is at once comic and tragic throughout, and it continues to move all who see it.
2030;Fiddler on the Roof is one of my favorite.
2031;It's a demonstration of faith, love, joy and music in the face of poverty and antisemitism.
2032;This is one of those stories that had to be told.
2033;I will continue to use Amazon.
2034;I doubt I have anything new to add, so I will simply say that between the music, screen play, casting, and multi faceted story, this deserved those three Oscars and a place in everyone's viewing library.
2035;Like a great conductor conveys the essence of a composers emotions through interpretation and conducting, this film was created, much like a symphony coming to life, in the hands of a master film maker.
2036;It is about the tradition of the Jewish culture and how everything must have a law and a faith to keep them together.
2037;norman Jewison has made some great films over his career, but for me, Fiddler is the pinnacle of his artistic achievement in musicals.
2038;It is stylishly with the flair of an artist who knows.
2039;music is so much of the story and Jewison has edited to the music.
2040;Unlike many previous musicals (i. e. Rogers Hammerstein or most filmed Operas) which hold a shot for the singers and actors to move about the frame, Jewison has cut and intercut the film on the meaning of the story and the beat of the music so that the performers and the music bring the audience intimately into the lives of the characters.
2041;Fiddler shows how a creative director can construct a film to be a spectacle of congeniality of all the elements, because he knows how to tell a story visually.
2042;this is a great film from a master filmmaker with a twinkle in his eye.
2043;It will put a smile even on Uncle Schrooge's face.
2044;However, Fiddler is a Classic, is a film that you will want to watch more than once.
2045;The acting is extremely well done.
2046;The cinematography is beautiful, and directing provides for an actual storyline not just a bunch of people bursting into song.
2047;This film is also based on real/true events during Russia's tumultuous days during the Bolshevik Revolution, World War I, the initial rise of Communism, and how it effects a small village of Russian Jews with each village member simply trying to raise a family, and provide some form of income.
2048;A great classic, time proven over and over.
2049;This movie is one of the greatest movies of all time.
2050;it is a must see.
2051;I would recommend it to everyone.
2052;The best part of this movie is that it is set in a real.
2053;It show the struggles that a family goes through.
2054;the music, the story, acting, all great.
2055;family movie with real history.
2056;ray product is excellent picture and sound which is why I am collecting my favorites on blu.
2057;"I have heard of this musical movie for many years and finally I bought it and watched it
2058;we just love this movie and it's worth owning one.
