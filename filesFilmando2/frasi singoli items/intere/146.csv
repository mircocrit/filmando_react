1;this movie is a nice introduction into the beliefs of ernesto guevara that shaped the man who later became publicly known as che .
2;Its not violent, nor too political either way, therefore its easy to watch and enjoy.
3;who was deeply committed to his beliefs to the end.
4;Having read several accounts of the trip and part of the book, I looked forward to an outstanding motorcycle/life adventure.
5;I had hoped to share it with friends and family as we have done the Long Way Round and other movies, but that will never happen.
6;It made me see that in the movie that rich people always were the boss of poor people.
7;This movie is awesome and very cool!
8;I particularly enjoyed the end.
9;Works perfectly, and was in excellent condition.
10;Arrived literally the next day!
11;This beautiful movie deserves a wider audience than it's likely to get.
12;taking, and the story inspirational.
13;So Che had a dream of a United Latin America.
14;As for the film, it is an experience that is a must for anyone with any curiosity about the world, although I understand that curiosity is discouraged in schoolrooms today, where the point of an education seems to be to establish our superiority over our neighbors.
15;Che's critics got the last laugh.
16;But the film captures the dream beautifully, and for a moment we may even believe it's possible.
17;The movie was one of the great ways to show how Ernesto became EL Che and it also shows you some of the good things that he as done in is life to change the world.
18;The Motorcycle Diaries is one of the most beautiful and engaging films I have seen in a long time.
19;The experiences and achievements of Ernesto and Alberto makes the viewer pause to reassess the potential of a human being's life and experiences, and I think that this is all the more significant for this film because it shows the two mens' experiences BEFORE Ernesto becomes the 'Che' of international renown.
20;but the film has a lot to offer other than this.
21;The scenery, as so many reviewers have already mentioned, is breathtakingly, awe.
22;inspiringly, beautiful (as is Gael Garcia Bernal.)
23;revolutionary Che in a quite refreshingly non.
24;He was so charismatic and full of vibrancy that it was impossible not to fall for his character.
25;The interaction between the two leads was wonderful and the whole film makes for an entirely fulfilling experience, one of the best movie experiences of past years.
26;A man of revolutionary conviction.
27;does this early life study of Che work?
28;Che got the urge to find 'himself' before Kerouac's Beat Generation classic On the Road and we got it as a result of that work so this struggle against personal alienation has been going on for a while now.
29;If one did not know before hand that this film was about Che then, while it was interesting, cinematically beautiful and the interplay between the two travelers was well.
30;acted it could have been about a fair percentage of the children of post.
31;Yes, I know that to recruit people to revolution these days we will be dealing with bright, articulate, thoughtful, concerned liberals like Che in this film's period but I believe that the makers of this film took a dive on the politics.
32;If they merely , as I assume, wanted to ride the wave of popularity for a real icon for international youth then I have even greater political differences with their use of Che's legacy.
33;I really enjoyed this movie.
34;I liked it because I saw how Ernesto and Alberto went through life.
35;symbolic of brave revolution in the face of tyranny.
36;righteous liberal elitism makes the mixture that much more intoxicating.
37;Add to that the outrageous good looks of the lead, Gael Garcia Bernal, and you have a budding thug and executioner you'd gladly introduce to mom and dad.
38;the star of the film, and its much.
39;a movie deconstructing the hippie.
40;Well besides that the movie was interesting because of the ways that they both handled things when they came across something.
41;this movie can really interest somebody because of the way the things go along in the movie.
42;Motorcycle Diaries was a tight movie, because it showed the path of Ernesto to becoming CHE.
43;I liked the movie because Che was strong and cared for the low class people and stood up for them.
44;sadly ones he returns to the continent that he was born in, he gets killed by the CIA.
45;I liked this movie simply for the other side that it presents, not only of Che, but also of how one may develop communistic ideas, which challenge the assumption many hold about both the man and the idea.
46;Is this a romantic well directed movie?
47;Acting is good, photography is splendid.
48;The gradual transformation of Che is well constructed.
49;The characters' stay in the clinic for lepers is convincing (with the exception of the sequence with Che swimming to the other side) and touching.
50;The last sentence we read on the screen is the culmination of this distorted view of Che.
51;"i saw this movie shortly after seeing ""The lives of others"" (about the ""good"" life in the ex."
52;A good complement to someone that likes international politics.
53;The best part that i liked was were they kept falling in the motorcycle.
54;But from hearing the movie it seemed like it had some comedy and that they had nice long adventures.
55;It was a great movie though.
56;"The Motorcycle Diaries covers the travels of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara and his friend, Alberto Granado, through South America during 1952."
57;Firstly, the magnificent grandeur of the South American landscape through which they travel.
58;"From the extremes of the Atacama Desert to the snows of the Andes Mountains to the jungles of the Amazon, ""Diaries"" is truly spectacular."
59;He slowly transforms from mere medical student to a young man with a desire to change the world.
60;"the history of events subsequent to ""Diaries"" is well known."
61;Guevara eventually travels to Mexico and joins up with Fidel Castro to overthrow the Batista government in Cuba culminating with success in January 1959.
62;Diaries goes some of the way to explain Guevara's political awakening.
63;This young man seems destined for bigger things regardless of the success or otherwise of this film.
64;Diaries should be seen by all interested in learning more about one of the enigmas of the 20th century.
65;A true, or as true as a film can be I guess of the early life of Che Guevara, when he was just forming his political views that caused him to join the revolution.
66;For me, the best things about the film .
67;It truly captures the beauty of South America.
68;"it's stunning to see the real life Alberto Granado suddenly standing in front of you
I:10970;69;It's a brilliant stretch of movie.
I:10970;70;I love this movie, especially since I've done a lot of traveling abroad recently.
I:10970;71;If you're the type of person who loves to travel or is dreaming of traveling, this movie will put you in a wonderful mood.
I:10970;72;You'll enjoy the beautiful scenery, the wonderful movie soundtrack, and of course the moving story.
I:10970;73;Plus the lead actor (Gael Garcia Brenal) is very attractive!
I:10970;74;The tale is about the youthful adventures of Che Guevara.
I:10970;75;My husband loved it"
76;The Motorcycle Diaries, which is based on Fuser's and Mial's accounts, covers the journey of both Ernesto and his best friend through several countries of South America.
77;Ernesto comes across as a compassionate and caring person who gently helps others.
78;I would recommend this film to everyone.
79;But it is well worth keeping an eye on the action and following as much of the subtitles that one can read.
80;This movie is very inspiring.
81;I call this a good movie, because there is some good history and I know it's a classic, but I think it could have been done a little better.
82;This is a beautifully done film.
83;both scenically and with a haunting message as well.
84;This movie has beautiful landscapes that you should take advantage of.
85;Just make sure that when you are viewing this movie have a nice t. v that will show the image very clearly.
86;Oh, yeah, that's right, he killed people.
87;With oer 300 reviews and a very high rating, this is strong indication you will want this in your collection.
88;this film is about that, and it is about two young doctors goign to work and gain experience at a reknown leper colony.
89;The story is profoundly touching.
90;it is a gold star winner in my book.
91;Just a short and sweet review here.
92;the movie is very good and exhibits the passion of a young Che Guevara, but it makes the mistake of assuming that being around the poor people in society automatically makes you a socialist.
93;The real voyage was an interior one, psychologically, spiritually, politically .
94;from what i heard the movie was good.
95;Motorcycle diaries for me is one of the greatest movies i have seen personally.
96;I was really moved by the south american scenery and also moved by certain themes like injustice and the segragation of the health workers from the lepers in the leper colony.
97;I never really cry when i watch movies but, I cried at the end because both men like true friends have to part ways, and sometimes parting ways is part of life, Che and Granado had seperate paths that went pararell from the begining.
98;Excellent portrayal of developing the character of Che Guevara in his feeling for the common good of all people and his sense of justice.
99;An entertaining and informative read you will not want to miss.
100;He's a young idealist living in South America when he and a friend (Alberto Granado played by up.
101;as they argue with each other over money, their deficient form of transportation, and Guevara's unflinching honesty when asked delicate questions (this is brought into focus when they first meet a man .
102;the cinematography was done exceptionally well on a small budget.
103;The beauty of Machu Picchu, the green forests of Peru, the nothingness of various deserts, all added great visuals for the viewer.
104;Yes, Che was concerned with humanity as a whole.
105;blowing locations, with a spectacular soundtrack, and explendid acting, director Walter Salles takes us, deep into South America, to an unforgettable journey, where two best friends will find more than just adventures, but get in touch with their true self, and will change their lives forever.
106;"And for those, that believes movies aren't all about, know that this is a true story, based on the diary of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, and his trip with his best Friend Alberto Granado."
107;see picture and a must.
108;The story focuses on the relationships of two young friends, their once in a lifetime road travels, and how their experiences would shape the men they would become.
109;world class acting, cinematography, and musical score/soundtrack.
110;"due to this loss of visual translation of the film art medium in ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" the viewer must see this film at least 3 times to really capture the greatness of this motion picture.yes, It's that well made and the cinematography is stunning."
111;the best I've seen in the past 10 years at least!I've seen this film 10 times and I still see new things in it that I missed before.
112;this film is a treat!
113;Traveling is one of my favorite activities.
114;They hop aboard a motorcycle and proceed to traverse throughout South America, making for an entertaining film that combines travel adventure and politics to create a mesmerizing film with a strong message.
115;this movie is based on a real.
116;life event that occurred in the 1950's when Ernesto Guevara set off across the South American continent with his friend on the back of a motorcycle.
117;There is also some great man.
118;the direction of this movie is superb, and it is intended to get the viewer to think about social and economic justice.
119;It offers great scenery, flawless direction, and great performances by the large cast of characters.
120;Toss your political beliefs aside and give this film a chance.
121;You will be happy you did.
122;My Spanish professor recommended the movie to me.
123;I liked it and enjoyed the story.
124;It was good to see on film a variety of Spanish Speaking America.
125;I think that the motorcycle diaries is a great movie of great content!
126;I loved it and i also feel like i learned alot from it.
127;The movie has alot of lessons to learn from and i loved all the characters performances.
128;It 's a truly great picture and the work done by Eric Gautier, ASC is unsurpassed.,if you're an appasionate with cute surroundings and want to admire a great cinematography, this is your kind of movie to have in your collection.
129;The story of the early years of Che Guevara is amazing.
130;Ill recommend this movie to any one.
131;I send a copy to my mother and she enjoyed it before going blind.
132;This is a powerful story and I think helped me understand more about Che Guevara.
133;"When you see his deep passion for the people and dedication to ""the least of these,"" you can see more how he became a revolutionary."
134;Even though he ended up caught up in violence, you can see how his heart began in the right place.
135;beautiful cinematography, and Gael Garcia Bernal does a wonderful job as Che, with just the right mix of intensity and innocence.
136;THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES, the new film by Walter Salles, is based on Guevara's journals and the letters he sent home to his family, chronicling a real.
137;"their trip, completed mostly on foot, is punctuated by heartbreaking portraits (literally
I:10970;138;From a couple forced to leave their children and find work in dangerous mines, to Indians who never had to learn Spanish before but who now have no choice but to integrate, the film delivers a clear message: """"The people"""" are suffering."""
139;"The film clearly illustrates Guevara's desire to help the people who cannot help themselves
I:10970;140;the screen loves Gael Garcia Bernal, who plays the young Ernesto Guevara.
I:10970;141;He is a beautiful, incredibly talented actor who, after his performance in this film, will probably be gracing the big screen here in America very soon.
I:10970;142;but the most stunning part of this film is the scenery.
I:10970;143;The views are breathtaking and unspeakably, draw.
I:10970;144;The film is an interesting mix of social commentary and coming.
I:10970;145;age story, filled with stunning imagery and containing a clear perspective and message.
I:10970;146;An interesting buddy movie with a twist.
I:10970;147;It seems to want to gain sympathy for Ernesto, but it does so in an uneven way, with fits and starts.
I:10970;148;i imagine that the purpose of the book was to place Enrnesto in a generous light, but that just didn't work.
I:10970;149;He turned out to be anything but an admirable figure and in life worked towards the enslavement or death of thousands of people, if not millions.
I:10970;150;This sensitive, colorful picture into the life of one the largest political figures in Latin America is passionately brought back to viewers through this film.
I:10970;151;the reality of the breathtaking images of South America makes it a must to see.
I:10970;152;The vocabulary is strong, however, not unlike what you may hear in the street today.
I:10970;153;it is an interesting movie to watch because it brings Ch to life in a way that captures your emotions and curiosity.
I:10970;154;It also explains the power of the life of Ch that continues to live on.
I:10970;155;It is mainly a nice exhibition of countryside cinematography.
I:10970;156;Its something of a buddies on the road picture.
I:10970;157;basically, The Motorcycle Diaries is just cotton candy for the mind.
I:10970;158;Motorcycle Diaries is a good foreign epic, with good acting and an even better soundtrack.
I:10970;159;This movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen.
I:10970;160;Even though i couldn't see the pictures i liked what i got to tsee and what i heard.
I:10970;161;The Motorcycle Diaries tells the story of a life.
I:10970;162;There is a ton of injustice in the world, and Guevara is learning that maybe he needs to do something about it.
I:10970;163;The part of his life that is depicted in The Motorcycle Diaries certainly paints him as brash and idealistic and serves to show that it is important to stand up for what you believe in, and not simply let your world dictate who you are.
I:10970;164;This is a beautifully shot movie, fantastic scenery and earthy people.
I:10970;165;Maria Full of Grace is my choice for best foreign film of 2004.
I:10970;166;Instead of being a road trip movie about things that change your life, it ended up becoming a look into a life who had enough with things and wanted change.
I:10970;167;first off, the film is anchored with 2 great performances, especially by Gael Garcia Bernal as Ernesto who manages to say a lot just simply by his expression or his gestures.
I:10970;168;Second, the cinematography is great with picturesque shots of the countryside including an ancient Mayan civilization.
I:10970;169;school special """"we are the world"""" stuff a lot of these films have."""
170;Like many popular figures, he ended up becoming one of the more well.
171;it's certainly a watchable film although I probably wouldn't watch it twice.
172;It's a great character study where your eyes get opened to everything beyond your comfort zone and I think we can all relate.
173;semitism and you will about have what The Motorcycle Diaries represents for Latin American Communism.
174;Yet, to the recrudescent Hollywood PC Elitists he is a hero, simply because he opposed America.
175;Despite being made by a Brazilian filmmaker, this film is thoroughly Hollywood, and bound to polarize.
176;Rarely is it easy to make the distinction between social history and cultural mythology.
177;And to create a film to represent the lives of complex historical figures is a daunting task, yet Walter Salles has proven that he is more than capable of creating such a film.
178;Their trek will take them on an amazing journey of over 8000 kilometers and will end in Venezuela at the Guajira Peninsula.
179;Ernesto and Alberto witness the turmoil of their land and it changes them profoundly.
180;While Alberto acknowledges the troubles of the people and sympathizes with them, Ernesto takes them to heart and understands the need for action.
181;A new conviction is born within him, a new cause for his existence and he is given something to fight for.
182;He craves revolution and the unity of Latin America.
183;the film gives a humanistic portrait of a man who has been idolized by young political radicals, respected by social reformers and admired by philosophers.
184;He was above all a complicated man capable of sincerity, compassion and instituting great change.
185;For those who are already familiar with his life, this film will deepen your understanding and appreciation of him.
186;For those unfamiliar with Che, the film is a wonderful introduction to a fascinating man.
187;the film is driven by powerful performances from its two leading men, who enrich their characters with impetuosity, angst, empathy and humor.
188;The music ingeniously captures the flavor of South American culture while imbuing the film with the angst of youthful rebellion.
189;What this film was about, however, is a true, as real as it gets, soul searching journey by two young Argentinian men who traverse South America on motorcycle in order to see other landscapes and people.
190;discovery' and empathy come in many forms, as these two shape their opinions on the human condition while two.
191;wheeling it across many landscapes and cultures for 8 months.
192;The scenery and landscapes are stunning and gorgeous, and the well.
193;paced film has a very realistic feel to it that draws you in.
194;Gael Garcia Bernal offers a riveting performance as the young Ernesto Guevara de la Serna in Walter Salles' film of The Motorcycle Diaries, based on book by both participants: Guevara's Notes on a Latin American Journey and Alberto Granado's Traveling with Che.
195;the trip matures them in many ways, bringing out their true natures, especially once they arrive at their destination, a leprosy clinic (Guevara's specialty).
196;But it is effective storytelling nonetheless, mostly due to the genuine performances by Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna, a actual relative of Guevara, but Eric Gautier's cinematography also makes good use of the locations to offer a sense of time and place.
197;"fans of the political side of Guevara will appreciate a few allusions to his future, but you don't have to be a supporter to enjoy the ""buddy movie"" aspects of The Motorcycle Diaries, and the ""coming of age"" of a couple of young men, on its own terms."
198;It's an interesting biography flick.
199;the film's one saving grace is the amazing musical score by Gustavo Santaolalla.
200;Even with it's drawbacks, it's a film worth checking out, especially if you are into foreign flicks.
201;"Before Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara became one of the galvanizing forces behind the Cuban Revolution, he traveled through Latin America with his best friend Alberto Granado on a beat."
202;He documented these adventures in a diary and this film dramatizes some of his entries, along with Granado's memoirs, and examines some of the experiences that led to Che's political awakening.
203;walter Salles fills his movie with beautiful scenery: the green, rolling hills of Argentina and the snowy roads and fog.
204;The Motorcycle Diaries is about two men becoming aware of the world around them and learning what it means to truly help and serve your fellow man.
205;Included is a good bit where Che and Alberto try to steal wine from a dinner that they are working at only to have their stash stolen by other workers helping out.
206;Making of The Motorcycle Diaries is a 22.
207;"A Moment with Gael Garcia Bernal is a Telemundo interview with the young actor."""
208;The movie is great, lots of reviews about it.
209;i like the actors, they are excellent.
210;Director managed it very good.
211;The movie is really good and the location is beautiful.
212;It shows the good side of Che Guevara, who once was a man with a heart.
213;You can enjoy this film as a coming.
214;age travel narrative with spectacular scenery of Incan ruins and the Andes mountains.
215;As a political documentary of its main subject, the revolutionary Che Guevara, it is at best romantic and incomplete.
216;"Still, there is something deeply powerful about the ""pedagogy of the poor"" learned from real life experiences of injustice and oppression such as are recounted here, and which are the lot of a disproportionate number of people in our world."
217;The film, in Spanish with English subtitles, is based upon Guevara's diaries of the trip.
218;Granado, now in his eighties, still lives in Havana.
219;I really enjoyed watching this movie ebcause it captivated me from the beginning.
220;Motorcycle Diaries offers more insight as a lens into the mindset of the Pan.
221;Good, sympathetic acting is shown against a compelling cinemascape of a vast, untamed land.
222;At one level, I enjoyed the story being told by the movie, but I could never reconcile the movie I saw with the history I knew.
223;But it succeeds in extending the pro.
224;read it carefully and you will find a lot of hidden expressions and comparissons against black people.
225;Well enjoy the movie and it's spirit of freedom and traveling!!!
226;"winning ""The Motorcycly Diaries"", starring Gael Garcia Bernal (""Y Tu Mama Tambien""), is an amazing film that portrays the world."
227;Alberto, his best friend, and he set on a road trip to explore all of South America.
228;As medical students, they help several families with pride.
229;Though it doesn't portray him in his famous activism, this film still shall touch viewer's hearts.
230;Regardless, this film wonderfully portrays him.
231;"the passion and the emotion lingers throughout ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" as they portray the families and the communities in pain."
232;As the two young men help them, the film shows how this epidemic effects everyone.
233;Therefore this is more than just a film of a road trip.
234;This is a film about friendship, heroism, and hope.
235;The emotional impact adds with Gael Garcia Bernal's beautiful performance as Che Guevera.
236;He alone gives this film the right theme for each individual scene.
237;Though all the other main actors also offer powerful performance, Bernal's remains the standout.
238;The Motorcycle Diaries is a touching film that will surely please its audiences for a long time.
239;This is an essential for any Gael Garcia Bernal fans.
240;"Those wanting to learn more about the influences in the Cuban Revolutionary should also watch ""Before Night Falls"", which shows the effects it had on the Cuban GLBT community."
241;I liked the movie because this person got chaged because of a trip that wasn't thought out completely.
242;The well meaning Robert Redford is a historical illiterate.
243;The enslavement of Cuba is greatly due to his efforts.
244;According to this film, Che was once an idealist who valued truth and interacted with other human beings in a very generous manner.
245;wing political leanings, but for the most part they seem like wild and crazy guys seeking adventure and a good time.
246;It really provides and enlightening perspective of what makes people tick.
247;like a lot of typical college students the summer of their graduation in America who travel to Europe, Asia, etc. to seek fun and adventure, this offers a similar journey of 2 friends who journey through Latin America ultimately to work in a leper colony.
248;It gives great insight how a single experience can change the destiny of one's life.
249;I could really relate to this experience, as I have also found this to be true in my own life.
250;I give kudos to the writers of this film who wrote a very layered piece which could relate to individuals on many levels and the actors were on point in their portrayals.
251;Robert Redford is the executive producer on this film and made a wonderful choice in taking on this film.
252;A true tribute to his development and experiences with the Sundance Film Institute.
253;the most important thing the movie reflects is truth and self.
254;The truth that 2 friends wil be parting ways and what path each one will choose.
255;One comfortable and safe, the other difficult and challenging.
256;A true coming of age movie.
257;As an adventure, right of passage movie it is interesting and entertaining.
258;Both humorous and dramatic, the acting is top notch.
259;And the cinematography is well done too.
260;The beauty and diversity of South America is nicely portrayed.
261;The film is worth a look.
262;We use this movie for our Advanced Placement Spanish class and want the students to see great films using the Spanish language.
263;It is very panoramic with lots of scenery and a slow serene pace and mostly a light mood to it.
264;This movie is about 2 friends and their adventure, they travel across South America.
265;"Ernesto ""Fuser"" is a medical student and this is his journey along with his friend Alberto."
266;i loved this movie, and I really reccomend for you watching it.
267;I liked it because it did not involve the radical politics that Che' is now known for.
268;And I know a lot of people have problems with him, the whole hero/murderer debate is always in swing when talking about him.
269;He is an interesting person for sure.
270;The film does a great job of showing Che' grow as a person.
271;Like I said the movie is not about politics it is more about a young man growing into himself.
272;And it is a pretty film with scenes taking place all throughout S. America.
273;But keep in mind it is a Spanish film and uses subtitles, so make sure you know how to read before you tackle this one.
274;Ernesto was a very rebellious and very realistic person.
275;I liked the message this movie.
276;Most of the film made me feel like i was going on the trip as well.
277;it will be a great movie to watch and it also helps in history class.
278;This movie is the story of a Cuban family during the Cuban Revolution and ACCURATELY shows you both pre.
279;The movie is fair because it portrays both points of view.
280;i though this is a movie about touring the beautiful South America with motorcycles.
281;the beautiful scenes of the beautiful South America and the mass murderers can't be mixed together.
282;To begin with, the cinematography is stunning.
283;is a masterpiece of understatement and economy, and the acting is uniformly terrific.
284;I honestly don't think there is a single weak link anywhere to be found in this film: other than the arguably simplistic portrayal of a potent historical character, this is as perfect a movie as you'll ever see.
285;What more can I say, other that to insist that you have to see this in the full, widescreen edition .
286;A great and entertaining movie about the young life of Che Guevara.
287;It does a wonderful job explaining how a young Ernesto Guevara went from a curious young man to a changed man that felt the need to help the Latin community.
288;I'll tell you, this movie is pretty amazing.
289;The visuals are worth it alone.
290;The music by Gustavo Santaolalla is as amazing as the movie itself.
291;Both main actors are amazing, all supporting actors do a great job.
292;There are funny parts, serious parts, deep parts, etc.
293;I recommend seeing this movie at least once to everyone.
294;This movie is well done.
295;The movie was good overall.
296;The movie had funny parts and some strong language.
297;perceptively directed, beautifully photographed and wondrously acted by a cast headed by two charismatic actors who tap deep into the hearts and souls of their characters.
298;Whereas the book is more observational, the movie provides a more involving feeling in its portrait of a young man on the brink of his political awakening.
299;inspiring Machu Picchu and several towns in between.
300;But the most touching passage takes place at the San Pablo leper colony in the Peruvian Amazon basin, where Ernesto bonds deeply with the lepers to the chagrin of the local nuns.
301;His night swim across the Amazon, struggling for air through his asthma, is a powerful scene among many in this subtly potent film.
302;"as he proved with his wonderful ""Central Station"", director Walter Salles has an acute ability to connect his characters to their settings in deeply emotional ways."
303;He is the ideal choice to guide this road movie.
304;As Guevara, Gael Garcia Bernal transcends his Tiger Beat, teen heartthrob looks and delivers a deeply touching performance, as he grows from a big city innocent to a haunted young man ready to take on a greater cause than his medical career.
305;He does an especially strong job in conveying his character's unblinking honesty and displaying unexpected acts of rage and compassion.
306;Just as good is Rodrigo de la Serna in his feature film debut as Granado, effortlessly showing his character's bravado and humor while finding his own bumpy way in the world.
307;In fact, much of the film's power comes from their palpable chemistry and unforced rapport.
308;They are instantly and completely believable as best friends.
309;And much more than the book, the film builds a solid emotional bridge between the young innocent and the Communist revolutionary Guevara was to become.
310;If you are not aware of his fate, it is briefly summarized in subtitles at the end, and the coda with the real Granado is moving.
311;This is a wonderfully heartfelt film.
312;of documentary is helpful, and includes comments from Salles, screenwriter Jose Rivera and executive producer Robert Redford.
313;There are also a couple of brief Spanish.
314;This is basically a road movie about friendship and self.
315;I won't give away anything else but suffice to say that this film is touching because of the level of humanity that it encompasses and not because it is a movie about Guevara and Guevara alone.
316;"As a matter of fact, I found Alberto more likeable and engaging because of his ""ahem"" womanistic and happy."
317;lucky personality which does a great job in contrasting with Ernesto's seriousness.
318;film theater in January and was absolutely mesmerized by it.
319;good buddies on the road together story slowly transitions into a deep film about the human condition, as Che's perspective on the world deepens and matures.
320;this is a fabulous movie, with all the dynamics and timeless messages of a true classic.
321;the many challenges that they overcome make them become closer and discover themselves.
322;The movie was beautifully shot and the story line was easy to follow, even without the subtitles.
323;It was inspiring and sad at the same time to watch the story unfold.
324;Even if you're not interested in other cultures or politics, this is a heart.
325;warming and heartbreaking true story at the same time.
326;"Obviously, I HIGHLY recommend this movie
I:10970;327;It perfectly shows the conditions in what some of the latin american countries community were living and the difference between lower and higher class.
I:10970;328;Great cinematography, great acting, great screen play, great soundtrack!Great performance by Rodrigo De La Serna in his first film, and of course Gael Garcia Bernal was excellent playing young Ernesto """"Che"""" Guevara, not just his acting but his Argentinean accent was not bad at all."""
329;the movie is about friendship, how two young man best friends have the best time of their life trying to accomplish their dream.
330;I think this movie was fantastic because it was based on how to treat people.
331;this movie was wonderful and I hope you get to see it one day.
332;The Motorcycle Diaries averaged three stars, including three on its merits as film.
333;"The imagery is powerful and emotionally persuasive, the story makes the point clear, and the subject of this fictionalized account of ""Che"" Guevara's journey across South America will do much to keep a communist/socialist/popular revolutionary in the same mindset as his or her comrades."
334;Che's book was funny, light.
335;He was able to laugh at himself.
336;The scenery of Latin America is the real star of the film, varied but always magnificent and captured well by the filmmakers.
337;The real star in my mind is the lady who played Silvia, a young woman with leprosy, with a lovely face despite her ailment.
338;She played the role with heart, and was brilliant as she regained hope and a desire to live, despite her daily suffering.
339;A tender and romantic portrait of Ernesto Guevara's adventurous youth, Motorcycle Diaries is not a very complex movie, but that makes it even better.
340;the journey simply *influenced* them.
341;The cinematography is beautiful and helps a lot in giving the movie an epic feel.
342;Rodrigo de La Serna, on the other hand, is fantastic as Alberto Granado.
343;He provides the movie with some awesome humour moments.
344;basically, Motorcycle Diaries is a good movie to introduce us to Ernesto Guevara, the man, before he became the figure we all know.
345;"For ""demonizers"" of him, it's a good way to see his human side."
346;The Motorcycle Diaries is one of those rare films that one should see on the big screen.
347;Gael Garcia Bernal's performance as a young Che Guevara was truly impressive.
348;There is a quiet intensity about him as an actor that made me believe that he was Che Guevara.
349;Rodrigo de la Serna was a delight to watch as Che's womanizing, playful companion and was just as much fun to watch as Gael Garcia was as Che.
350;I truly felt like I was in South America personally.
351;Throughout the first half of the film I always wondered where on earth the two friends found gas for the motorcycle because all I saw was them driving in desolated areas of the country where there is no gas stations.
352;tinged film score was excellent.
353;The second hour of the film is easily the strongest moments of the film.
354;Seeing Che and Alberto interact with the patients of a leper colony was deeply moving.
355;I especially liked the interaction between Che and a young woman who refused to have surgery.
356;Another great scene was when Che and Alberto arrived at the colony and shook hands with a couple of the residents without gloves as a symbolic gesture.
357;All in all I loved the film.
358;The performances by Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna were excellent and were a joy to watch.
359;I really enjoyed the making of the film and the conversation with Alberto Granado.
360;This movie is abou fuser wanting to see the world and help others before he turns 30.
361;The movie is neither informative nor very entertaining (to my taste).
362;The Motorcycle Diaries is an important film for everyone to watch.
363;For those who wonder why the Latin American youth still wears Che, Allende, SubComandante MArcos, and Lenin T. shirts, it is important to understand the circumstances in which Latin Americans grow up.
364;While Americans continue to believe that socialism is evil and authoritarian, and while many note that Guevara justified killing political enemies, it is also important to understand that Latin America has suffered under the influence of some American presidents, who, during the Cold WAr, supported authoritarian upper.
365;it is important for Americans who want to understand Latin America to watch this film.
366;Visually appealing, with a great amount of extras on the disc.
367;This movie is great because it shows the adventure 2 friends that traveled tin a journey to America.
368;I also think that this movie would be a great movie for people who like drama and history in the same movie.
369;I was very moved and inspired by this moved in many ways.
370;I laughed and cried in this movie because they portrayed thier story really well.
371;The movie portrays the journey of Erensto and Che as they set out for an awsome adventure.
372;It has love, action, and comedy in this cuban film.
373;Even though you have to read the subtitles in English, you can still understand it
374;"In the same manner that Lord of the Rings incorporated New Zealand's stunning landscape into the storyline, ""Motorcycle Diaries"" tells a very honest tale of two adventure seekers who ride through South America on a motorbike and are inspired by its breathtaking landscape and the interesting lives of the people they encounter."
375;"It's all a true story and it's the road trip that inspired Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara to become a revolutionary."
376;regardless of your viewpoints of Che Guevara, this movie modestly and humorously brings about the sense of adventure and humanity of Granado and Guevara on their trip.
377;Nonetheless, it's a wonderful journey.
378;Gael Garcia Bernal asolutely nails the role.
379;He's fast on his way to an Oscar.
380;highly recommended movie and not to be missed.
381;THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is certainly one of the finest films of the year .
382;creation of the journey of two young, well.
383;"Walter Salles (""Behind the Sun"", ""Central Station"") once again proves himself a director who can infuse his vision of a story with uncomplicated directness of approach, having the sensitivity to allow his well."
384;chosen actors to create wholly believable, three.
385;taken as simply a movie to enjoy, THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES is as beautiful as a National Geographic Magazine feature on the Amazon and the deserted and populated lands of South America.
386;creation of Che Guevara's and Alberto Granado's meaningful excursion into manhood this movie goes far beyond entertainment and enters that rarefied arena of psychobiography.
387;They are touched by the plights of the people, the people in turn love the boys, and they eventually spend three weeks living and working in a leprosarium run by the nuns, adding their knowledge of medicine to helping not only the physical needs of the lepers but finding ways to break the psychosocial ostracism that historically curses the 'unclean'.
388;gael Garcia Bernal gives an incredibly thoughtful, stunning portrayal of Che, saying so much more with his eyes, his body language (especially as he suffers through his own physical demon of asthma attacks), and his perfect embodiment of the spirit of a man who becomes enlightened by the peasants he comes to love.
389;Bernal is already a brilliant actor and a magnetic screen presence, and if he is not nominated for an Oscar for this unique, artful role it will be a major surprise.
390;His is a career to watch!
391;ALL of the many extras in this huge cast are memorable: the leper colony abounds with some of the most touching human beings ever captured on film.
392;The camera work, the musical scoring, the obvious commitment on the part of everyone involved in this glorious picture .
393;This film reminds us of the stunning power of movies to alter historical fact and blind the clueless, fawning masses.
394;"Humberto Fontova helps us remember the real Che:""When you saw the beaming look on Che's face as the victims were tied to the stake and blasted apart by the firing squad,"" said a former Cuban political prisoner Roberto Martin."
395;When other duties tore him away from his beloved execution yard, he consoled himself by viewing the slaughter.
396;This passage is from Ernesto Guevara's famous Motorcycle Diaries, though Robert Redford somehow overlooked it while directing his heart.
397;the one genuine accomplishment in Che Guevara's life was the mass.
398;A fun movie with beautiful scenery and witty dialogue.
399;bernal does another great movie.
400;I love this film, in fact it is one of my favorites.
401;But I liked the bike.
402;I liked the South American history and scenery.
403;And anyone who tops a wild three month vacation off with a visit to a leper colony already has my attention.
404;This film is amazing and while working at an independent film theatre during its' release I enjoyed it immensely.
405;ray to properly represent the story it tells, just as it is a perfect story in real life.
406;The film has two characters who set out to travel on a bike.
407;I liked the Black Jack scene for one.
408;This film is fantastic with its scenery, the beautiful story of two young unselfish heroes, realizing unknown social contrasts during their adventurous never boring motorcycle trip.
409;but please, have your own check.
410;This movie touched my heart deeply.
411;It was about friendship and self discovered through experiences in life.
412;To travel is to learn the true meaning of life.
413;These two fine actors were amazing.
414;He performed for the Cuban revolution what Heinrich Himmler performed for the Nazis.
415;He was a warm killing machine.
416;I just want those who think it is some innocent journey of self discovery to be aware of what the main character really was in real life.
417;"This movie is realy something especial,not only beacuse its the story of el ""Che""in his early life,but its well done movie,great music and good photography."
418;this film makes you want to explore by yourself.
419;This film has come to my hart to see how at the biginning of the movie he knew he wanted 2 be a doctor.
420;for those who hung che's portrait in their dorm roomscomes a well made film glorifying a murderouscreep who hated bathes.
421;I usually do not like subtitled movies, but I will make a HUGE exception for this well acted movie.
422;and it is a quite interesting and very UNEXPECTED story of his youth.
423;I found it so interesting that I was sorry the movie ended when it did, I wanted it to tell more about the next stage of a historic life and figure.
424;This film is for the free spirited, revolutionary dreamer in all of us.
425;"the picture is breathtaking as it elegantly showcases the beauty of South America
I:10970;426;Che's and Alberto's lives ran parallel for a while and circumstances pitted them against each other which in turn made them grow"
427;This movie is a great autobiography and is well portrayed in the movie!
428;It shows a young man becoming a great leader along his journy.
429;Persanaly I liked the movie a lot and want to see it again.
430;What I enjoyed was all the beautiful scenery and the grouth of a great leader.
431;Walter Salles sweeps you along on a magical ride through South America, charting a course set by Che Guevara many years ago.
432;Gael Garcia Bernal turns in a beautifully understated performance in sharp contrast to the role he played in Y Tu Mama Tambien.
433;There is something about being on the road with your best friend, a motorcycle, and thousands of kilometers ahead of you.
434;"Such is the amaingly quiet and stunning film ""The Motorcycle Diaries""."
435;Leaving Buenos Aries, they seemingly run into everything along the road, including, rather enjoyably, a cow.
436;this film can rightfully be called half of a two buddies on the road picture, with the other half being a picture of great social commentary.
437;Gael Garc a Bernal is amazing as Ernesto.
438;His depth of feeling as an actor penetrates every cel of this film, and his performance is Oscar worthy.
439;Equally worth is Rodrigo De la Serna's performance as the heavy (?)
440;When Ernesto becomes embroiled in his thoughts, Rodrigo carries the audience with him until the end in tremendous fashion.
441;"They gaze into the camera, almost expressionless, but it causes us, who watch this film in our comfortable living rooms, with well stocked refrigerators, to remember the world out there, and that we are a part of it as is everyone
I:10970;442;The stares of those people are a constant reminder of that.
I:10970;443;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:10970;444;Lucky a friend had a movie night out and I was able to catch it in the theatre, otherwise I would have missed it for a while if not altogether.
I:10970;445;audio: ACrisp and full guitars.
I:10970;446;Levels great, including excellent center channel.
I:10970;447;mA 5.1 is the selling point.
I:10970;448;If you can fully enjoy the uncompressed audio then this disc is expensive but worth the upgrade.
I:10970;449;old Ernesto Guevera de la Serna, called """"Fuser,"""" with affection, along with good friend, Alberto Granado, began an eight month."""
450;long epic journey, (almost 5000 miles) .
451;an adventure of a lifetime .
452;which was to have a tremendous impact on both of their lives.
453;The two men used their feet and thumbs, to make their way across a continent.
454;The Motorcycle Diaries is much more than a historical travel film.
455;It is a moving drama about the human spirit, rife with comedic moments, as Alberto and Fuser banter, argue, and provide each other with conversation and companionship on the road.
456;Granado's attachment to his beloved motorcycle is hilarious, as is his highly developed art of bullsh*t.
457;His charm and gift of gab come in extremely handy when money and transportation are needed.
458;Ernesto is especially moved and angered by the poverty and injustice he witnesses.
459;This growing awareness of the vast differences in social and economic circumstances between the wealthy few, and the multitude who barely eke out an existence, all over Latin America, begins a process of transformation for Ernesto.
460;And this transformation is the driving force behind the film.
461;The tremendous transition from middle class professional to future revolutionary, begins on this journey.
462;gael Garc a Bernal, as Ernesto Guevara, and Rodrigo De la Serna, as Alberto, (the real life cousin of Ch Guevara), give extraordinarily nuanced performances.
463;The two actors are the film's very heart, soul and energy.
464;De la Serna provides humor and warmth, an excellent contrast to Garcia Bernal's more serious, intense young Ernesto.
465;The supporting cast also excels .
466;the acting is superb!A variety of exquisite South American landscapes, in all kinds of weather, are beautifully portrayed.
467;The shots of Machu Picchu and Cuzco are phenomenal.
468;Although modern technology has reached the cities, the beautiful scenery of the countryside is the same, as are the faces of the people, their songs, dances, native dress, languages and dialects.
469;At the movie's conclusion, the final shot is of the now very old Alberto Grenado, the man who made this famous trip back in 1952.
470;i am moved at how well Brazillian director Walter Salles captured the peoples of South America, their cultures and ambiance, and the content of the diaries.
471;He has remained faithful to the literary sources .
472;When he wrote of his trip, he did so with the youthful idealism of a 23 year.
473;It is this fresh, idealistic perspective, and the genuine expression of social consciousness, that makes the film so powerful.
474;In the movie you could really see the differences between both friends.
475;This movie did a good job at portraying Ernesto Guevara's road trip through South America.
476;It depicts two bright minds who like many their age want to see some of the world.
477;The film did a good job at showing the situations that helped change Che while not focusing too much on the negative.
478;Redford did a good job.
479;"I still cannot bring myself to admire him, but this certainly was an interesting facet of his life as depicted in ""The Motorcycle Diaries."""
480;Its story of two people that ride an old bike and head on to face the road by themselves.
481;This is a great movie about the coming of age of a prominent political figure in South America.
482;It is funny as well and beautifully filmed in gorgeous countries in South America.
483;Still, this movie was compelling in many ways.
484;so Che and his buddy Alberto go on a trip through South America.
485;"It's funny that it is called ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" when they only travel partially by motorcycle."
486;This was an interesting filmic contribution to men's studies.
487;Males leave their comfortable homes to see the world and prove themselves.
488;There are conflicts between the alpha and beta male.
489;the important point in this movie is that Che learns about oppression based upon race, class, political affiliation, and disability.
490;But they definitely came up as themes.
491;They definitely played a role in defining manhood, tacitly Latino manhood, here.
492;But they show the real.
493;life Alberto de la Serna here and it really adds to the fim.
494;First off, I'm impressed that he's still alive, especially given that Che was assassinated.
495;They also show actual photos of the two men during their trip.
496;It powerfully reminds you that this really happened.
497;"I liked the way the two Aboriginal women in ""Rabbit."
498;the film was really moving.
499;i really enjoyed this movie beacuse i could see what Ernesto and Alberto when through.
500;i also enjoyed it because i could see how they felt and i could understand the story better than just reading the book.
501;i enjoyed watching the movie.
502;"I was able to watch ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" today and Walter Salles is no ordinary director."
503;I am pleased to see that he convincingly managed to overcome geographical barriers, to accomplish a high standard of film making.
504;The cinematography is truly gorgeous, and reminded me how little of the South American landscape we ever see on film in the U. s.
505;A film like this is long overdue, and it deserves wide distribution.
506;Diaries runs smoothly and effortlessly, without a trace of boredom.
507;It is frequently funny and it makes the audience aware of deep emotions inside the minds of two young adventurers, who were bound to change their lives forever.
508;upon reading the credits, one can clearly see that this is joint project, done by people who are deeply involved with good, non.
509;Their performance is truly first.
510;class, yielding a special significant to the development of the characters and the credibility of the film.
511;class Latin Americans, by the sweeping landscapes and by the fantastic performances.
512;"Once I (finally) figured out that the Ernesto Guevara in this film was indeed *the* Ernesto Guevara, I thought, ""How brilliant."""
513;It's a very rare thing in cinema, or history studies in general: a portrait of a man as a man.
514;Imagine the story of the Beer Hall Putsch told in such a way that we really got into the youthful main character's mind to discover its workings and motivations.
515;my personal opion was that I really don't enjoy this types of movies but the funny parts were the ones that I really enjoyed.
516;I also thought it was a good idea that he went with a friend so that he did not have to go through all of this alone.
517;I felt the film failed, however, on the level of writing in that it often drifted into the area of excessive sentimentality: the swim across the river, the waving good.
518;bye to the lepers, Guevara and Granado's good.
519;This is one of those films that can be both throughly enjoyable as a viewing experience and flawed as a serious film.
520;But this movie is great because deep down inside every ruthless killer and dictator.
521;So we should make nice movies about them.
522;Next the director will be making a film about Adolf who was a real swell guy and animal lover who became so enraged about German mismanagement of its economy and the after.
523;good movie, not as bad as i thought my uncle wanted the movie so i bought it for his bday!
524;In the film's climactic moment, after attending a performance of Wagner's stirring anthem to freedom.
525;This is a great movie.
526;"the story is absorbing
I:10970;527;The larger issue is that this is yet another example.
I:10970;528;There are many reasons one would like to give five stars to this film: the writing and acting, costuming, music, the engaging cinematography.
I:10970;529;Even the interviews with the Chilean indegenas incorporated into the screenplay, though not in the book, are so spontaneous as to be convincing.
I:10970;530;This is the benefit of being wed to one's mother.
I:10970;531;the film is poignant, however, even as fiction.
I:10970;532;He takes on a new persona, displacing the old, frustrated Che with yet another new name.
I:10970;533;but he will have one terminal success.
I:10970;534;He is successful at something in that he creates his total immolation, his self.
I:10970;535;dreaming of the day he'll be rewarded with his own chalet at Berchtesgarden.
I:10970;536;opening trip and political awakening, Salles's lushly photographed """"Diaries"""" is an impressively acted and superbly directed coming."""
537;"Anchored by Bernal and De La Serna's hearty performances, ""Diaries"" is a rousing portrait of political integrity and humanitarian commitment."
538;The movie also has the same unseen narrator style to move the story along.
539;A lot of adventures and a lot of humor make this intelligent and highly recommended.
540;It is a road trip, buddy movie, but also so much more.
541;Thus, it is odd to see a film made that shows him in a positive light.
542;I watched this movie because someday I hope to be able to travel South America similar to this.
543;Also brings up a good debate on the ideas and methods that were used in this influential time of change.
544;The Motorcycle Diaries is based on Che's journals of the same name.
545;"the film version of ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" is an excellent adaptation of Che's memoir, showing the leader of the Cuban revolution in a light with which most people are unfamiliar."
546;"So in ""The Motorcycle Diaries,"" it's interesting to see Che as a young man."
547;The Motorcycle Diaries is thankfully subtle, showing Che not as an inflated hero, but as a likable human being.
548;And even though the trip is difficult, he does manage to have fun.
549;"throughout his journey, Che is astounded by the inequities of the world
I:10970;550;The Motorcycle Diaries is reflective, informative, inspiring and entertaining.
I:10970;551;As the first major motion picture about Che, it does a great job of covering the early years of his life, perhaps providing even the final cinematic word on the subject.
I:10970;552;It is a great Movie, to people who enjoy real life stories and deep thoughs.
I:10970;553;There'd be nothing remarkable about the story except that it's ostensibly true and the student eventually matured into Che Guevara, that revolutionary whose memory is revered by dissidents and the politically correct everywhere.
I:10970;554;But, you get the picture.
I:10970;555;the film is notable for the lush scenery and spectacular locations of South America, and which include the Incan ruins of Machu Picchu and a riverside leper colony, where the boys donate their volunteer services.
I:10970;556;Were they actually people stricken with Mycobacterium leprae, or just actors with strategically applied body make.
I:10970;557;The movie also has it's humorous moments, especially during the first half when our heroes stuttering progression across the landscape comprises a series of road mishaps on the motorcycle.
I:10970;558;Oooh, there's the Machiavellian CIA, again!
I:10970;559;As is, it's a good road story that reminds the viewer of the exuberance of youth and the adventures to be found if one has the stamina for it.
I:10970;560;Just a real, stirring story of friendship and a journey of self.
I:10970;561;The acting was wonderful and the style unique.
I:10970;562;A highly effectual film, its angle made the audience curious about its material and the fate of its characters without being preachy about Che Guevara's particular controversies.
I:10970;563;i highly recommend it for anyone who's interested not only in Latin American politics, but more for anyone who can appreciate an excellently told story.
I:10970;564;This time the brazilian director manages a multi.
I:10970;565;The other one is Alberto Granado, pharmaceutic, a little older, a funny, easy.
I:10970;566;All they know is that this trip will be utterly important in their lives, and they couldn't be more correct.
I:10970;567;All this among many other adventurous, funny and memorable moments.
I:10970;568;to me, the most interesting fact in the movie is that it shows the early life of Che Guevara.
I:10970;569;I was expecting a movie about political ideologies and revolutions, and got a subtle, beautiful, emotional movie, feelings that no politics could ever arise in myself.
I:10970;570;Mexican Gael Garcia Bernal and argentinian Rodrigo de la Serna are almost perfect in their roles.
I:10970;571;there are two other things that come to mind as good features in """"The motorcycle diaries""""."""
572;pichu, to the Peruvian Amazon, this is certainly one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.
573;Every frame on the movie has the purpose to bring the viewers closer to the characters, making us climb abord with them on their motorcycle, or in a boat, or even on foot through the cold desert's night.
574;As this is a movie based on real events, Salles' experience with documentaries comes really at hand.
575;It's impossible not to imagine this movie as real, authentic, in a powerful way.
576;This film is moving beyond imagination.
577;gael Garcia Bernal's portrayal of Ernesto Guevara is just magnificent.
578;the actors were just beautiful and each one fitting in their respective roles.
579;the landscaping was phenomenal and just beyond my wildest imagination.
580;this film throws at you wisdom of men,sadness but plenty of happiness and paves the way for Guevara's future political struggle.
581;I was excited to finally see this movie after hearing a lot of positive reviews of it.
582;The film has some stunning images of South America and Gael Garcia Bernal does a fine job in the role of Che, but I was expecting more from this film.
583;I'd recommend Bernal's Y Tu Mama Tambien instead, as it's another road movie with wonderful visuals but I feel it also has more thought provoking political moments.
584;"This film shows the human side of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara before all his revolution road."
585;I enjoyed studying Che, however after the Cuban Revolution he became cocky by publishing manuscripts on how he revolutionized Guerrilla Warfare, which ultimately lead to his capture and death.
586;Must be viewed multiple time (like many films) to understand the message.
587;I now want to learn and explore more about Che Guevera and the things that he accomplished.
588;There were so many scenes that showed the beautiful features of South America.
589;You have to pay attention and actively empathize with the characters, and that's when the drama will hit you.
590;But the acting was superb, as was the writing.
591;The relationship between the two men was heartfelt and easy to relate to, and they were hilarious in their interactions.
592;This is hands down the best foreign film i've ever seen.
593;Theres so much symbolism and meaning I watched it 3 times in one week and discovered something new each time.
594;the film is really a beautiful piece of work, some of the most gorgeous cimenatogrophy that I've ever seen, fog covered lakes, and rain soked jungle covered mountain passes, the total visual effect of the this film is outstanding, just wish it had been dubbed, so I could have caught even more of the effect.
595;on,and you come home feeling entertained.
596;this is a film about a meaningful events of a man who later became a REAL hero.
597;its full of fun events in the beginning of the film,later slowly transforming in to something very intense and meaningful.
598;I greatly enjoyed Motorcycle Diaries despite the fact that I have mixed feelings about the figure portrayed in the film.
599;I would encourage all, from every political spectrum, to see the film as it is well worth it!
600;South America is a beautiful, exotic, and diverse continental rich in history and culture.
601;Having traveled there several times I find the land fascinating.
602;Like the mountains,the bodies of water,and the animals.
603;"the story is funny,exhilarating and rather sentimental to the point of winning one over to love and embrace the youth that Guevara was, and to not acknowledge the monster that he became.You will be lulled with gorgeous cinematography of Argentina,Peru,Chile,Colombia and Venezuela
I:10970;604;if you don't watch out, you will think that Guevara ends up a true champion of the people who loved lepers as much as he loved the freedom of all people.
I:10970;605;This movie was a moving heartfelt adventure road movie.
I:10970;606;The scenes are beautiful and the people that they meet even more so.
I:10970;607;Through society and the environments in which people coexist information can be acquired that furthers notions in regards to personal values, beliefs, and morals.
I:10970;608;A person's beliefs and moral values illustrate the persona of an individual, and it is often how people connect to one another.
I:10970;609;Motorcycle Diaries offers some insights to how these beliefs and morals might have been acquired on a long journey through the South American continent.
I:10970;610;When the day comes they pack up on the """"Mighty One"""", a leaky motorcycle from 1938 that is to bring them to their destination."""
611;These moments offer a strong opportunity to look into how these two young men observe the world, as it gives some insights to the securities and comforts in which they were brought up.
612;Furthermore, the name of the motorcycle, the Might One, offers a perceptive analogy with some irony as it gives more detailed depictions of how reckless and absent minded they are in regards to their journey.
613;This visit to Chichina offers a deeper development of Fuser's personality, which depicts a righteously romantic character.
614;The sound in the following scenes brings the audience a thundering murmur, as if Fuser is about to explode.
615;In essence, it is a film about learning.
616;the cinematography that Salles employs through cinematographer Eric Gautier is marvelous.
617;There are also many other scenes that elevate the cinematic experience, for instance, the many close ups of Alberto and Che's faces.
618;This is a clever way of making the film even more enjoyable, which in the end will offer much for the viewers to contemplate through the many hardships that Che and Alberto face.
619;informative about the beginnings of Che Guevara.
620;An average citizen, smart and refined (about to attend Med School) inspired by his trip through America to become what he is known as today.
621;The movie stays true to the book, which is the writings of Che Guevara himself.
622;The photography is fantastic and the transition between affluent fun to social conscience is handled nicely and nearly seamlessly.
623;americans, North Americans, probably make the better films.
624;It's just the way it is.
625;So seeing the 'best foreign film(s) of the year' has an element of 'how ARE the Joneses doing?
626;'And in that regard, this film comes out well.
627;garcia Bernal does a great job as Ernesto Guevara, and although less sexy or sensual I thought Rodrigo de la Serna was the better actor as Che's compatriot travelling in South America on the last fling before responsibility, de la Serna as a biochemist and Che in medicine.
628;the movie does seem to encourage that and giving it credit, witstand it.
629;This is part of his life, or the life that he embraced, and critics need to feel a willingness to point that out in the absence of villification.
630;With Che, it's a fair shot.
631;And we did that with this competent film as well.
632;It was nice bring it to live and see the relevant places.
633;Still, I loved the film because it showed the beauty of Latin America, and it did give insight to how El Che developed his idea Pan Americanism.
634;Gael Garcia Bernal is just great!
635;Good movie and great chemistry with his partnerr (can't think of the other actor's name.)
636;Good biographical piece of what led Che to Cuba.
637;Brazilian director Walter Salles Jr. has done a good job of elevating Brazilian cinema to the international audience.
638;"With ""Central Station,"" ""Foreign Land,"" and ""Exposure,"" he's created an important body of work."
639;Dealing with the younger parts of the characters' lives, we see a more carefree existence set against the gorgeous backdrop of South America in Argentina, Chile, Peru and Venezuela.
640;I read it won the Oscar for best song, although I confess I can't hum a few bars of that tune.
641;Jose Rivera's screenplay was nominated for Oscar's Best Adapted Screenplay.
642;"as Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, Gael Garcia Bernal portrays him as a serious and thoughtful young medical doctor."
643;His buddy Alberto Granado is the perfect foil, not as handsome and more portly, he swaggers with a delightful flare throughout this, his first film performance.
644;paced film, but moves methodically and certainly, allowing the camera to linger on the faces of the people and for the care in their faces to sink in.
645;I thought it was a very good cinematic piece that provoked thought.
646;Both are good in their roles although the screenplay itself lacks depth.
647;top with righteous indignation and political fervor that I actually found myself giggling, their adventures consisted mostly of having their motorcycle break down and meeting some native people.
648;romanticized scenes in a leper colony.
649;Mostly, it played like a coming.
650;That's why I had such hope for this film.
651;I loved that book and hoped to discover in this film that combination of adventure and discomfort that created a turning place in their lives.
652;The film begins as most other `buddy films' begin, with the image of two young men setting out for a fun.
653;way through the film, the pair's 1939 British Norton motorcycle dies and they continue their journey by foot and hitch.
654;It is a culmination of their social awakening.
655;This act is reminiscent of the initiatory baptism, the washing away of the old life to create the new way of life.
656;"He brings the young Che to life
I:10970;657;Bernal's Che is likeable, charismatic, intelligent and compassionate, which even Che detractors must recognize.
I:10970;658;revolutionary and follows the young man's transformation from a fun.
I:10970;659;loving, slightly irresponsible medical student, to the socially conscious idealist and radical.
I:10970;660;loving dissidents and idealists will love this romanticized portrait of their hero.
I:10970;661;The film emphasizes Guevara's great love for the South American people and the oppressed indigenous tribes.
I:10970;662;Walter Salles' direction is seamless and subtle.
I:10970;663;stricken South Americans to speak for itself, and to highlight Guevara and Granado's growing awareness of the injustice.
I:10970;664;He steals many of the scenes and his witty, gregarious performance sets the pace for the film.
I:10970;665;He provides just enough humor in the midst of some of the appalling scenes of misery.
I:10970;666;And of course, as a relative of the historical Che Guevara, de la Serna provides a tangible link to the subject.
I:10970;667;in the end, Salles provides a poignant, hopeful ending.
I:10970;668;The two friends part and Guevara finishes his medical studies before embarking upon his political career.
I:10970;669;the cinematography is astounding and showcases the South American landscape.
I:10970;670;The great panoramic sweeps of the camera perfectly illustrates the dizzying height of the Andes, the emerald fields and the Incan ruins.
I:10970;671;the images of the Incan ruins is perhaps the most poignant images of the film.
I:10970;672;And that moment is one of the many turning points in the film.
I:10970;673;the true star is the South American continent.
I:10970;674;The film will leave you wanting to read more, see more of this beautiful land and its fascinating history.
I:10970;675;The Motorcycle Diaries was one of the best films of 2004 and well worth the money.
I:10970;676;this has been one of the good movies I have seen.
I:10970;677;Good actors, lovely settings, especially Machu Pichu, and a fascinating story.
I:10970;678;It's a nice ride through South America with interesting people along the way.
I:10970;679;The plan is to be ambulant party animals, and the early part of the film is precisely that.
I:10970;680;It is here that Guevarra's transformation is complete.
I:10970;681;this film is an awesome view into the 6 month journey of a lifetime!!!
I:10970;682;This was a good movie.
I:10970;683;This movie had very good details.
I:10970;684;This movie, with its excellent scenery, needs to be watched in a movie theater to really appreciate the cinematography.
I:10970;685;The acting is fine, and you can really see how a trip like that might have influenced Guevara's worldview and why communism easily found a home in poverty.
I:10970;686;Two guys embark on a trek to discover South America.
I:10970;687;They have a great time.
I:10970;688;It's the stuff that makes for an interesting book perhaps, but movies are made to be watched.
I:10970;689;I certainly can't see a big audience for it among today's moviegoers.
I:10970;690;Item was brand new, sealed and exactly as described.
I:10970;691;Thanks for an honest sale!
I:10970;692;Sound is great, film is excellent.
I:10970;693;Walter Salles' gorgeous road movie follows 23.
I:10970;694;These procedures are an archaic bourgeois detail.
I:10970;695;the very diaries just made into this heartwarming film by Robert Redford.
I:10970;696;Actions speak louders than words,and agony and innocent blood deserves more respect.
I:10970;697;This is a road movie about Ernesto """"Che"""" Guevara, before his """"political"""" times."""
698;Actually, it is fair to say that it depicts in a romantic way the road trip through the heart of South America that opened him up to the things to come later.
699;The music by Gustavo Santaolalla is breathtaking, becoming a perfect match for the monumental South American landscapes (think Andes, Amazon river.)
700;The movie as a whole leaves you feeling good in the end.
701;I cried, I laughed, I was moved and more importantly forever touched.
702;He was a true revolutionary.
703;this movie was greatr and i hope you get to see it one day.
704;My husband and I loved it.
705;Despite the youth of the actors, the performance was great, superb!
706;Brilliant direction, outstanding performance by an amazing cast ensemble, breathtaking cinematography, and best of all, Gustavo Santaolalla's original musical score.
707;the genius of Walter Salles' direction and Gustavo Santaolalla's musical composition is felt throughout the film.
708;This particular musical piece filled with emotion, transports you to altered states of being.
709;"It is here where you feel the passion Ernesto once felt for the common man
I:10970;710;a passionate film about two young souls thirsty for knowledge and self.
I:10970;711;I enjoyed this wonderful movie on many, many levels.
I:10970;712;che Guevara once said that """"a true revolutionary is guided by great feelings of love""""."""
713;"Although I work in the ""capitalistic"" financial services sector and am a few years shy of 60, I was, and continue to be, a great admirer of Che Guevara."
714;"this movie captures a 10,000 km journey throughout South America that a young, footloose 23 year old Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara embarked on with his good friend, Alberto Granada, in 1952."
715;On countless occasions, the film provides the viewer with some breathtaking images of South America as seen through the eyes of a couple of guys on the back of a motorcycle .
716;along the way, a very subtle change takes place within Che.
717;In one poignant moment, Ernesto tells his mother that he spent one cold night next to a young destitute couple, but that this night brought him closer to the human race.
718;This beuatifully crafted film gives the viewer a glimpse into the mind of the young Che's political and philosophical awakening as he comes into direct contact with the generous, friendly working.
719;but above all, I found the closing shot of a now.
720;He was a delightful and personable friend to Ernesto and loyal to a fault.
721;"paul Sartre would declare him to be ""not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age"" and the ""era's most perfect man"" ."
722;regardless of your political views, this is a wonderful film that I would highly recommend.
723;It is a story about friendship, but also of two men finding their place in the world.
724;old medical student Ernesto Guevara sets out for adventure and fun, the actions and events he witnesses makes him think and reflect on his views and aspects of life.
725;These encounters raise his social consciousness emotionally and politically and inspire him to become a revolutionary.
726;this is the kind of movie we all need to see every now and then.
727;There was humor and comedy, beautiful scenery of the countries, and even an opportunity to practice listening to Spanish as I read the subtitles.
728;Also, Fuser's example of generosity, honesty, and social consciousness was thought provoking and makes one aware of their own beliefs.
729;This movie is amazing, not because this man was such a revolutionary, but even before that, he learned how to see the beauty of a person.
730;This movie shows the intense drama of human desire first to help another and then to be loved.
731;I would say it is important to see this movie because it is an adventure, but more than that, it is a lesson on life!
732;The Motorcycle Diaries is one of my favorite movies from 2004.
733;Lyrical and insightful, it is one of the best `road trip' movies of all time.
734;gael Garcia Bernal is one of the great actors of our generation.
735;He gives to Ernesto a great meaning and presence.
736;The Motorcycle Diaries is based on a true story.
737;This movie tells us the story of two young men, and the adventure that would change the way they saw the world.
738;Rodrigo de la Serna is just as convincing as Alberto Granado, and he makes us laugh from time to time with his antics.
739;It is highly likely that those books helped Brazilian director Walter Salles to make a film that sounds so true, but he obviously also contributed, and a lot, to make a film that is far from the banal, and that appeals to those who watch it.
740;If you aren't interested in that, you can just consider this movie an opportunity to appreciate the scenery of some really beautiful places in South America, and to enjoy the adventures of two young men that embarked on the journey of a lifetime.
741;In Diaries, Bernal portrays a young pre.
742;revolutionary Che Guevara on a life.
743;movie' ingredients are here, but director Walter Salles manages to layer the story with a deeper theme that makes it all cohesive: a road trip of grandiose notions and goals is reduced to the need to help humanity in its most direct form.
744;these guys are about as flawed as Mother Teresa), but with Gustava Santaolalla's atmospheric guitar music and Eric Gautier's warm cinematography, Diaries and all its flaws become a satisfying cinematic experience that swells to a rewarding, if somewhat trite, finale.
745;The message of Diaries is powerful, though, no matter how schmaltzy it may be.
746;"As the tagline goes, ""Let the world change you."
747;It was a good movie.
748;with all that said, the film is beautifully and artfully shot by cinematographer Eric Gautier and the mise en scene is cluttered with the beauty that is South America.
749;The duo's bumpy journey by raft, ferry but mostly on foot is characterized by humor, arguing and a deep recognition of how much better they have it than most of the people with whom they come in contact.
750;This movie is one of the best foreign flix i have ever seen.
751;the way that they portrey Che is so interesting.
752;This movie is a great historical film as long as a great Drama
753;"the movie ""Motorcycle Diaries"" wuz a resplendent movie and it wuz bout two friends named Che and Alberto both heading to Cuba."
754;Alberto lies alot and Che isz very honest.
755;There's not much substance here, but it's nice to look at and the actors provide some comedic moments.
756;Except for the cinematography and an occasional laugh, this movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
757;This is one of my favorite movies in any language!
758;The Motorcycle Diaries is a fantastic film.
759;The cinematography is glorious, the setting spectacular.
760;The story of an epic journey of self discovery and the birth of social conscience for two very special young men.
761;spanish speaker, loved the movie too .
762;"this is definitely a ""must have"" movie!!!"
763;I saw this really cool movie about Charles Manson when he was a boy, riding a bike, helping people he met along the way, volunteering at a leper colony, charming the ladies, flashing that winning smile, etc.
764;the Motorcycle Diaries is about a man who personally oversaw and took pleasure in dozens of mass executions in Cuba and Latin America (and ordered hundreds more).
765;These procedures are an archaic bourgeois detail.
766;affirming road trips as young men and had madcap misadventures, learning about the world and about themselves in the process.
767;Should such a man be admired, memorialized in cinema and t. shirts, and held up as a role model for those seeking justice?
768;From a purely product perspective, this is a very good film.
769;The scenery is outstanding, the actors are good, the story is interesting, etc.
770;So what's the problem?The issue is that we are watching a film that puts a person who did horrible things into an extremely positive light.
771;The actor playing Che has a lot of charisma and the viewer can't help but pull for him.
772;Why then, do we celebrate his life with a film like this?I was able to enjoy the film at face value, imagining that it was just some fictional account.
773;That's were the film makers made this a politcal film instead of just a good story.
774;Would I enjoy such a film?
775;This movie was good .
776;well acted and I didn't mind that it was in subtitles.
777;The movie is excellent and I don't feel the need to say anything more about the plot or cinematic features than what has already been said.
778;This is one of those rare films that really can affect one's outlook and persepective.
779;life character who is pathologically reviled by many in the United States even today, but abroad, is an icon on the scale of Mohammed Ali.
780;how one perceives this historical figure is rooted in rich and poor, North vs. South, propertied versus the rest.
781;Guevara isn't born to these conditions, he has to see and experience them in a very tactile way, even though he is born to privilege and his journey with his friend starts very much as a student lark .
782;the seductiveness of this lyrical film is that many reviews considered the movie to be apolitical.
783;The film is actually very political in its quiet way, in explaining, mostly with pictures and few words, the roots of Guevara's agrarian radicalism.
784;"this movie is properly subversive with an ""S"", even though many people still think this is another harmless ""buddy"" movie."
785;My two teen age boys were captivated by the story.
786;Go get this, and own it.
787;this is an important film that everyone that cares about the world should see.
788;both medical students they end up meeting a well.
789;i enjoyed this film emmensley and recommend it to everyone.
790;this film portrays South America's (and third world's)reality in a very effective way.
791;This movie tells the story of two friends who discover the dark side of the great world the people who criticize this movie live in.
792;with that said, the acting is great, the photography is remarkable, the story is well paced, the music is beautiful, and America is just America, pure magnificence.
793;It was so good, I bought one for myself and a few extras for my family.
794;Same director as Central Station, another great film!
795;Diarios de Motocicleta is a great film and I would highly recommend it.
796;It's really a shame because the aesthetics of this film are really nice with a lot of lovely scenery.
797;the romantic idea of a trip across the continent, the coming of age tale, the photography, the locales, the music are all fantastic.
798;so the motives and methods of che's actions are anything but simple.
799;even if the accusations against che are true, then it shows us how situation and circumstance can turn a idealistic and well meaning individual into a killer.
800;but the movie itself is highly enjoyable and educational.
801;great lesson for everybody today.
802;The scenery, characters, and dialogue make this movie a true gem.
803;Regardless of your stance on Guevara, you will enjoy it.
804;This is a great movie with an interesting perspective.
805;A bit elaborated, but makes for a great movie experience.
806;The movie 'Traffic' affords this option, so it CAN be done.
807;The first hour of this film is magical: the stunning South American scenery lends itself to grandiose cinematography against which our two likeable young bon.
808;vivants set about an epic journey.
809;It really is beautifully photographed and captures the very essence of the young man's perspective on discovering the world.
810;And as the last reel arrives it is clear there are sanctimonious cowpats aplenty: an honest, beautiful film becomes revisionist, people's poet.
811;it's not exactly subtle, but those on the educated left will love it: our local cinema, nestled in quiet, affluent, but Guardian.
812;This movie is so great, I even saw this movie three times.
813;This movie helped me learn more about Che and Albertos journey.
814;A co. worker recommended this movie.
815;I bought and really enjoyed watching.
816;The story reminds us of why it is that we can be driven to action when we are young.
817;It was good to know something about the principal caracter, but my wife enjoyed it and she was born and raise in the Pacific Islands not a clue as to who Che is so the movie tells a good story of a young man who found his revolutionary calling after seen all of south America.
818;Better if you speak Spanish, and great if you are Argentinean (to feel again that is the best country of Latin America).
819;An idyllic and compassionate Argentine rich kid decides to throw it all away and redeem himself by redeeming the poor.
820;conformist with a heart of gold and a mind of steel .
821;star idol recognition among First World well intentioned rich liberals escapes me.
822;"with his handsome ""Howard the Duck"" looks."
823;I would love to see that movie get raving reviews and international awards, and I'd also like to see your kids wearing that lovable commissar's face on their T. shirts.
824;see how you like that, for a change!
825;If you haven't yet discovered the talents of Garcia Gael Bernal, you certainly will want to see more of his films after this.
826;Beautifully photographed, will make you want to take a tour of Latin America yourself.
827;"Truly gives you a better understanding of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevaro's motivation for who he was to become."
828;The Widescreen edition is a must to appreciate the magnificent magical feeling that makes you want to get on the back of the motocycle with them.
829;This movie was very interesting because it shows that people care about others and that's very nice.
830;I didn't know it was going to be in spanish, but I still enjoyed it and being based on a true story made it even better.
831;A really really great movie of how the world chages a person and makes them wanna change the world he lives in.
832;A profound and heart moving movie that shall be seen on the big screen.
833;This is a movie I've wanted to see since it first came out, and regret not doing so.
834;It's a GREAT movie, and Gael Garcia Bernal is terrific.
835;well worth seeing again and again!
836;The film remarkably capable of telling this complex story in a very enjoyable format.
837;Lots of food for thought!
838;Before he changed the world the world changed himPhilanthropy, adrenaline, passion, love, and breathtaking views.
839;it is as authentic as the air you breathe, the leaf you don't crush, the tears you hide.
840;Two friends who take on a trip for fun and adventure.
841;compassion, truth, genuine human to human respect.
842;these procedures are an archaic bourgeois detail.
843;Motorcycle Diaries is a emotional and inspiring movie to watch.
844;It will also create emotional reactions at some point.
845;I reluctantly watched this movie for a Spanish class and was surprised at how great it was!
846;The middle lagged a little but Ernesto and Alberto are fantastic and the ending is just beautiful.
847;What sparks you?This movie is just a begining of a man.
848;And, I believe it is a touching movie of destiny.
849;"Although the concluding remarks referred to his later years, the events portrayed in this movie could have inspired a positive change in the lives of many ""mainstream"" persons including ourselves."
850;"It begins with a sense of knowing what it is like to be to be perceived as a member of the ""lower"" class."
851;This treatment affects Ernesto and starts to open his eyes to other injustices.
852;the photography, as I mentioned, is outstanding.
853;From the Andes to the Amazon, we are treated to a view of a world we seldom see.
854;I chose the English option and got the sound in Spanish with English subtitles.
855;With Engligh language films you can go into the kitchen to grab something while listening to the dialogue or background music to cue you if things start to get intense.
856;This is a movie that commands all of our attention.
857;The movie holds your interest, the characters are well portrayed by the actors, and you'll love Che once you've met him through the film.
858;"The best movie that captures the live of the Legendary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevarra, before becoming the revolutionary icon."
859;gael Garc a Bernal performance is exquisite, the story and locations are superb!!
860;If you enjoy latin american story and history, you got to watch this film.
861;A beautiful exploration of how a road trip across Latin America in 1952 makes a lasting impression on a pair of idealistic young medical students, one of whom would later go on to become the Communist revolutionary Che Guevara.
862;As I don't pretend to know Che's real life story, I enjoyed the movie as it was presented and skipped on passing judgment on fact.
863;"made film by the brilliant Walter Salles, and stars the excellent Gael Garcia Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna as Che and his good friend, Alberto Granado, as they set out to discover the South American countryside, from Argentina, to Chile and Peru, ending in Colombia
I:10970;864;This is a buddy movie, with humor, adventure and purpose.
I:10970;865;Che's discovery of man's inhumanity to man started with this trip, and the rest is history.
I:10970;866;taking cinematography by Eric Gautier, and an unobtrusive but effective score by Gustavo Santaolalla add to the enjoyment.
I:10970;867;The two leads have wonderful chemistry, and it all comes together for an exciting ride, with an award.
I:10970;868;winning script by Jose Rivera.
I:10970;869;Whatever your opinion of Che Guevara, I recommend you see this film to gain a great perspective of the man and his ensuing motivations.
I:10970;870;Despite all the political discrepancies that you may have or have not with Che Guevara, this is a must see movie.
I:10970;871;One of the best of the year!!
I:10970;872;It makes you laugh but it can also touch you very deeply.
I:10970;873;I recommend watching this movie with an open mind approach and you'll find it great
I:10970;874;The Motorcycle Diaries changed my opinion of that greatly.
I:10970;875;Gael Garc a Bernal did a great job in this movie.
I:10970;876;It is a great adventure based on a true story about Ernesto R. Guevara de la Serna, who is better known as Che Guevara the Marxist revolutionary that allied himself later in life with Fidel Castro.
I:10970;877;I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in getting an idea of the story of the young Ernesto Guevara, who is definitely a controversial figure even to this present day, for anyone who wants a fun experience in learning some Spanish (given it has English subtitles), or for anyone who likes and enjoys beautiful scenery and travels.
I:10970;878;It is rated R and is for a mature audience rightfully so.
I:10970;879;I give the Motorcycle Diaries 4 stars without allowing my own personal beliefs of Che Guevara to create a biased opinion.
I:10970;880;I thought this was a beautiful film.
I:10970;881;The great actor, director, and deep thinker Robert Redford really did an outstanding job of realistically portraying South America in the 1950s and telling the story of Che, the great humanitarian who now adornes so many T. shirts.
I:10970;882;I thought the best part of the film was the scene at La Cabaa prison in which Che presided over the executions of over 500 political prisoners, including children.
I:10970;883;It was such an act of heroic compassion on his part because he was able to rid the world of so many vile, contemptable capitalists in such a short period of time.
I:10970;884;I can see now why so many people like and admire Che and bear his image on their T. shirts.
I:10970;885;in fact, Guevara's great awakening takes a somewhat surprising back seat to the journey itself here, and that's one of the things that makes The Motorcycle Diaries into such a wonderful, and watchable, movie.
I:10970;886;Bernal and De la Serna are both fine actors, and the chemistry between the two is easily the equal of that to be found in any Hollywood buddy.
I:10970;887;Director Walter Salles (Central Station) and screenwriter Jose Rivera (Eerie, Indiana) decided, quite rightly, to focus on that chemistry, to make The Motorcycle Diaries the story of a friendship that happens to contain a political awakening, rather than a political awakening that happens to be couched within a friendship, and it makes all the difference.
I:10970;888;You can choose to see it as a political film, or you can choose to see it as a buddy film.
I:10970;889;One way or the other, though, you should see it.
I:10970;890;I saw this film 7 or 8 times in the theatre!
I:10970;891;It was love at first sight!
I:10970;892;I think this film has multiple layers of appeal for viewers to appreciate.
I:10970;893;It has a wonderfully charming Latin appeal.
I:10970;894;The music is totally captivating in the emotional sense, perfectly choreographed with what the actors are experiencing and going through.
I:10970;895;As well as expressing the cultural and geographical timeframe flawlessly.
I:10970;896;This film REALLY grows on you the more that you view it, you find yourself sympathizing more and more with the actors.
I:10970;897;Is this, on its own merits, a great film?
I:10970;898;I think she was correct, and I would agree with those who feel that what merits the film has depends to some degree on who the film is about.
I:10970;899;the film does a good job of rooting Che's eventual concern with the liberation of the oppressed by depicting his broad and constant encounters with everyday people throughout the continent.
I:10970;900;epic exposure to the continent clearly condition his sympathies and inform his vision.
I:10970;901;in many ways, the star of the film is the South American continent.
I:10970;902;The scene shot in Machu Picchu reveals the incredible beauty of the site better than anything else I have ever seen.
I:10970;903;gael Garcia Bernal is a remarkably handsome, talented young actor, formerly best known for one of the two young men in Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, and is outstanding in portraying the young Che Guevara.
I:10970;904;Rodrigo De la Serna does not have the enormous charisma of Bernal, but he more than holds his own in the film.
I:10970;905;, amazing, art win, and unique culture too, guess what?
I:10970;906;This movie captures the story of Guevara's trip perfectly.
I:10970;907;I highly recommend this movie to everyone interested in the life of one of the 20th centuries most influential figures.
I:10970;908;Great music for a great movie.
I:10970;909;Shows where Che came from and what truly changed his mind and his soul.
I:10970;910;This movie covers a road trip Che Gueverra took with his friend Alberto Granado.
I:10970;911;Fine acting, writing, and beautiful scenery.
I:10970;912;The Motorcycle Diaries is based on Guevara's own writings about the trip.
I:10970;913;Even so, the film is never totally successful at showing how this rather modest young man became one of the world's leading revolutionary figures.
I:10970;914;As a result, the second half of the movie is more interesting than the first.
I:10970;915;In addition to the confident directing by Walter Salles and the fluid editing and camerawork, the film has a rich musical score, filled with flavorful Spanish rhythms, provided by Gustavo Santaolalla, who recently won an Academy Award for his even more beautiful work in """"Brokeback Mountain."""
916;revolutionary years, is able to bypass all that messiness and paint the man in largely glowing and positive terms.
917;"A movie on that subject might make for a more searching and pointed film than this one turns out to be, but ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" still has much to recommend it."
918;Gael Garcia is excellent in his portrayal of the late Che as he formed his ideas while travelling through Latin America.
919;Some of the camera work on the scenery up in the mountains is nicely done and interesting to look at.
920;I thought that this movie was great.
921;i liked the book a bit but the movie is also good because i got to see the land in south america.
922;it was a beautiful land.
923;i want to see it again.
924;Scenes of luxurious grandeur of the upper classes contrast with the dignity of the peasants who accept, as natural, their poverty and the pillage of their land by the rich.
925;This movie was really good.
926;You should watch this movie and see if it changes or atleast affects your life a bit.
927;Watch it and you'll see.
928;This was one of the first ones ive seen and i must say even after practically seeing a new one every few days this still ranks amoung my favorites.
929;I thought this was an extrordinarily beautiful movie.
930;The cinematography, music, acting, and pace are all superb.
931;This is what happened to my wife, who was expecting a lot more than the movie delivered, but luckily I was aware of what the topic was, and found it extremely interesting.
932;the two friends show striking similarities in their way of looking at the world, but also considerable differences in their behavior.
933;"Alberto is more gregarious and can convince other people of almost anything through the use of his wit and talents as a kind of ""con artist""."
934;Ernesto, a student of medicine, who is close to getting his degree, is more introverted and takes things a lot more seriously.
935;"I understand that in this way, Salles is trying to attract a wider audience
I:10970;936;What the movie does do, is provide the viewers with spectacular images of an amazing continent.
I:10970;937;The breathtaking scene in Machu Pichu is one of the highest points in this area, and the reflections about how the Spanish exterminated the amazing Inca civilization filled me with sorrow and regret.
I:10970;938;gael Garcia Bernal proves that he has all the qualities that make a successful actor, presenting a polished performance.
I:10970;939;Rodrigo De la Serna holds his end of the bargain pretty well, especially through his spontaneity, adding a humorous tone that helps move things along.
I:10970;940;There is also a brief interview with Santaolla, who did an outstanding work with the music in this film, by incorporating the sounds of South America.
I:10970;941;The music includes an inspiring song that has been nominated for an Oscar: """"Al Otro Lado del Rio"""" by Jorge Drexler."""
942;It is worth seeing The Motorcycle Diaries if only for the film's style and beautiful cinematography.
943;"A great sense of unity is created by this movie
I:10970;944;all of it works together to create a very beautiful and emotionally powerful film.
I:10970;945;gael Garcia Bernal, the best thing to ever come out of Mexico, stars as a young Che Guevera, in the years before all of his political activity.
I:10970;946;He wants to live more, see more.
I:10970;947;And Guevera is the perfect partner for the trip.
I:10970;948;exploratory journey, the movie hits all the right buttons.
I:10970;949;i was often awed by the beauty and sadness of it all.
I:10970;950;Bernal is amazing as Guevera.
I:10970;951;This is one young actor who deserves more roles in great pictures.
I:10970;952;The supporting cast is also solid, and the script and direction often brilliant.
I:10970;953;This is a very touching and powerful film that you won't regret seeing.
I:10970;954;I did see some parts and they where quite funny even if it was in Spanish and I speak English.
I:10970;955;like movie that brings forth the joy and peril of travel, raw stunning beauty of South America, courageous characters and travel.
I:10970;956;i think that travel opens up the window to one's soul and enables one to see beyond the day.
I:10970;957;It is amazing how man must travel distant places to take a deep.
I:10970;958;Snowcapped mountains provide the perfect backdrop.
I:10970;959;the background music played towards the later part of the movie is haunting and soul.
I:10970;960;i thought the story or plot was great.
I:10970;961;butj overall the movei was good!!!!
I:10970;962;it's a romantic ode to the youthful Guevara, and truly captures the adventurism and empathy of his formative years that may have affected him in later life.
I:10970;963;The director is wise not to weigh his narrative down with too many explicit allusions to his eventual activist zeal.
I:10970;964;all physical destinations to be reached and crossed as well as stages in our protagonist's spiritual and psychological growth.
I:10970;965;But Bernal does a fabulous job of maintaining a perfect dose of traveler's passivity coupled with boyish inquisitiveness.
I:10970;966;i highly recommend it for the discerning viewer.
I:10970;967;At first I gave this 5 stars for its great performances and awesome scenery, but now I'm starting to agree with some of the other reviewers about the moral implications of painting a man with Che's history as a saint.
I:10970;968;But lets put the moral aspects aside for a moment.
I:10970;969;This is movie is just amazing.
I:10970;970;This film has remarkably beautiful photography, commendable acting, and, early on, undeniably amusing scenes of camaraderie between the young, relatively well.
I:10970;971;but I still love this film!
I:10970;972;the film shows the very human side of a young Ernesto Guevara as he takes a break from his medical studies to do a road trip around South America.
I:10970;973;Together with Alberto Grenada, they experience the gamut of human emotion: the joys, elations, and sadness of a journey amongst the downtrodden of the time.
I:10970;974;Walter Salles did an exceptional job of portraying the feelings evident in the book, which I bought and read as a result of this movie.
I:10970;975;because of this movie, I learned quite a bit about that period of history and, more specifically, about a man the CIA thought important enough to kill in Bolivia.
I:10970;976;i highly recommend this movie for not only an exciting film that will draw you in, but for a look at the making of a revolutionary who so affected the world in which we live today.
I:10970;977;My main draw of seeing this movie was to see the beautiful South America since I knew nothing about Che Guverara.
I:10970;978;If you are going to watch for that very reason then I assure you this is an awesome movie.
I:10970;979;If you have ever been on a road trip just to enjoy nature you will readily connect with this film.
I:10970;980;The Motorcycle Diaries in my opinion is probally one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
I:10970;981;It is very inspiring and shows how Ernesto Guevara becomes Che Guevara.
I:10970;982;Seeing and hearing about the injustice in the world will open your eyes and make you want to do something about it.
I:10970;983;He was right and is still right.
I:10970;984;There is so much injustice in this world.
I:10970;985;I absolutely love this movie!
I:10970;986;It is one of my favorite foreign films.
I:10970;987;The music is awesome, and the acting is right on.
I:10970;988;It is a serious journey throughout South America, but humor never leaves the picture.
I:10970;989;Well done and interesting film offering accurate background on the subject: Che.
I:10970;990;A favorite of my students.
I:10970;991;This was an adventurous movie by Walter Salles.
I:10970;992;The movie is very persuasive, inspiring people to make a change not only for themselves but for everyone.
I:10970;993;Both were put in many obstacles, but they managed to reach their goal and make a change for every one today.
I:10970;994;told story of two young men's road trip through South America in the 1950s, and an eye.
I:10970;995;opening visual treat for an American like me who is ignorant of South America's geographic beauty and diversity.
I:10970;996;Young Che (Ernesto), portrayed by the well.
I:10970;997;But the final moments of the film give away a strong political bias .
I:10970;998;The film would be beautiful if it was simply about 2 young men unknown to this day and age.
I:10970;999;Ignore the obvious political bias, and enjoy it on the human and scenic level.
I:10970;1000;time and again couple of my Indian friends recommended to watch this movie.
I:10970;1001;it is just a great movie.
I:10970;1002;way through the story, but Ernesto and his friend continue their journey.
I:10970;1003;all in all a beautiful tale of 'two lives who ran parallel for awhile'.
I:10970;1004;Highly recommended on it's own terms, and also for those who are looking for early Che's life story.
I:10970;1005;Very creative filming yielding a very sensitive study of how people can come to realize greater global needs of humanity.
I:10970;1006;as a film the main strength is the rendition of the landscape.
I:10970;1007;despite all that the film is rather pleasant.
I:10970;1008;The photography is terrific and there is enough narrative interest and plot to prevent you getting to bored.
I:10970;1009;This is a great collection to add to our already existing Spanish movie collection.
I:10970;1010;amazing cinematography and score lend a subdued realism to the OUTSTANDING performances by the two antagonists.
I:10970;1011;The best movie of 2004, hands down.
I:10970;1012;Gael Garcia Bernal (from Y Tu Mama Tambien) is amazing as the young Che .
I:10970;1013;you really feel for him and the situations he encounters, and you can see why he changes the way he does throughout the movie.
I:10970;1014;But when you watch it, you will feel you have made the journey along with Che and Alberto on their dilapitated old motorcycle.
I:10970;1015;A couple of points to make about the movie for those interested in watching it.
I:10970;1016;There are subtitles that can be read by an English.
I:10970;1017;Be aware if you are going to watch this movie.
I:10970;1018;times buddy film about two friends on a journey.
I:10970;1019;When the characters are meeting travelers on their journey, it seems like authentic documentary at some points"
1020;finally, go into the film expecting to watch a movie and learn about a relatively well.
1021;Take the film for being a film (with stunning scenery) and use it to further understand the person.
1022;"I watched this film a few years ago, and immediately I regarded it as one of the best films I've ever watched
I:10970;1023;Firstly it's about the unknown youth of one of the world's most well known people and most iconic legends known throughout the world"
1024;Secondly, it's a road movie, and I love road movies of all kinds, whether they are factual, funny, dramatic, sad, introspective or a mix of all these things.
1025;"Fourthly, it goes throughout South America from country to country showing off this wonderful and magnificent continent in all its beauty and splendour
I:10970;1026;Fifthly, the road movie is often a metaphor for life, and the journey taken on the road to here there and everywhere becomes symbolic of the journey we all make in life"
1027;the film has no bad parts in it and the script and the acting are top.
1028;"notch
I:10970;1029;Of course, the film is in Spanish, so you need subtitles if you can't speak that language but this in no way detracts from the film, lending it in fact an exotic air"
1030;All in all, this is a fantastic film, a buddy movie, a coming of age tale and the lost story of a world legend.
1031;To watch the film is to feel the life of the places, and this is the best thing you can find in 'The Motorcycle Diaries.
1032;What happened to the other person, you will see at the end of the film.
1033;For that alone, 'The Motorcycle Diaries' is worth your time.
1034;Motorcycle Diaries is a movie about two guys who saw how people were being mistreated for a dumb reason and they wanted to help people who weren't being treated right.
1035;It was a good movie.
1036;"The movie, at its core, is a good movie
I:10970;1037;He is seeing that they need to do something.
I:10970;1038;The acting, though, is superb.
I:10970;1039;I was happy with this company and I would use them again.
I:10970;1040;The movie has a good since of humor and it has a good point makes you reliaze all the injustice that there is in the united states but not only here but all over the world is a nation wide thing.
I:10970;1041;I enjoyed the life lessons learned in this film, though I watched it on a horrible screening.
I:10970;1042;I reccomend that you see this movie sometime.
I:10970;1043;It was kind of chinke in the beginning but overall it's a good movie to learn from.
I:10970;1044;Interesting movie based on the lives on two very interesting men that shaped Latin America.
I:10970;1045;Good intro to the Social Revolution
I:10970;1046;great filmmakers such as Tarkovsky and Cassavetes have the ability to """"humanize"""" their subjects."""
1047;In other words, they avoid all biases and stereotypes and take us directly into the minds and hearts of their characters in a way that helps us to understand their choices and accept them on a more personal, human level.
1048;this is an amazing film about the younger che guevara.
1049;i will always appreciate the acting and storyline because it gives us a chance to see how che was before he became a cuban revolutionist!
1050;This is a great movie, a wonderful tour through many regions of South America.
1051;The movie moved me because of what Che did as a revoultionary.
1052;Great for AP hitch school Spanish when talking about national heroes.
1053;hero and it excellent for debate.
1054;Diarios de una Motocycleta was a great great movie.
1055;But what i loved the most was the shipping yes it came in three days less than what i had expected.
1056;I order this and got standard mail and received it in 3 DAYS!
1057;as a person who has read the actual diary this movie does drift off a little bit from the book but it is acceptable.
1058;(the diary is filled with laughter for all to enjoy) I really recommend this Film for anyone of any age.
1059;personally I was happy with this product good movie and it arrive before the time i had expected.
1060;If you have seen the movie Che or plan to see it, I highly recommend seeing The Motorcycle Diaries.
1061;Finally, this is an excellent road movie beautifully filmed.
