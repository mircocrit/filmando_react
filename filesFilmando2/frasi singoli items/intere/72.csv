1;There is something about this type of humor I guess.
2;fans of this instant classic!
3;I find the comedy style in most Simon Pegg movies to be refreshing and somewhat subtle when compared to the in your face slapstick Hollywood comedic styles.
4;I tend to find Hot Fuzz funnier than this one, but this is still a funny movie.
5;This movie is one of my favorites.
6;This movie is the most fun you can have with flesh.
7;I loved this movie since the first time I've seen it.
8;I also enjoy all the other work with Nick Frost, SImon Pegg, and Edgar Wright collaborate on.
9;They work so well together and their ideas seem to mesh together so well.
10;There are also some emotional moments that harken back to the master of zombies himself
11;For me the result was the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time.
12;Having seen a lot of things young Mr. Pegg has done on various television shows .
13;including the amazing SPACED, which everyone who enjoys this film should immediately seek out .
14;I was anxious to see him in something bigger.
15;special mention goes to the very cool Bill Nighy, playing Shaun's dad.
16;Nick Frost is disgustingly brilliant as Shaun's slob of a best maye.
17;Also, the numerous iconic film quotes peppered throughout the film is interesting enough, and hilarious to hear taken out of context.
18;this is a homage to all the zombie films you have ever seen and loved, as well as a milestone in both British filmaking (think Trainspotting) and new British Comedy.
19;Love this movie, glad I finally bought it on Blu.
20;Shaun of the Dead does everything a zombie movie needs to do, and it also manages to be an intelligent comedy that says something not only about the protagonist Shaun (Simon Pegg), but about the Britain around him as well.
21;He is, we have the impression, an observant, smart, young.
22;He does have redeeming qualities
23;The explanation (and it's very brief) is that it's a sickness infecting the locals.
24;the film has some truly hilarious scenes, espcially when they decide which LPs to throw at the zombies to try and decapitate them.
25;crushing implement
26;the extras are great to watch, espcially the Zomb.
27;this is definitely a film for any zombie freak
28;This is one of my personal favorites!
29;I had really high expectations of the movie from the second I heard about it, so it wasn't as good as I thought.
30;It is a very hard line to cross in today's cinema to make a film that part comedy and horror film.
31;this film wasn't made in America, it was made in Britain where the humor is actually intellectually funny.
32;While there were some in this film, I felt the majority of the humor was logic and intelligence based.
33;If you listen to the words, you will laugh at the jokes style of comedy instead of waiting to see who will fall over what first.
34;with its firm grasp on the comedy aspect, Shaun of the Dead delivers an exceptional grade for its creativity.
35;That was actually some of my favorite parts of this film.
36;stealer duo, Shaun and Ed.
37;what also made this film work on every level was the cast.
38;Director Edgar Wright has done a fantastic job of placing the right actors with the right characters.
39;They were each believable in their own part, and I loved every scene with Bill Nighy.
40;He was perfectly cased and you could just tell that he loved being in this film.
41;That is another great aspect of this film.
42;It was a fun film and you could tell that the cast was having fun with their roles and were comfortable in their environment.
43;So many times we watch these style of films and we see miscasting and uncontrolled actors doing anything to ensure that they stay at the top of people's minds.
44;All I could do was sit back and enjoy everyone and everything.
45;overall, if you love zombie films and you are a fan of The Office or any Hugh Grant film, than Shaun of the Dead will appeal to you.
46;I don't remember the last time I witnessed such a creative film.
47;I think not!SOTD is a very fine piece of work which works on so many levels.
48;This is revealed most brilliantly in the way the zombies blend in so well early on that Shaun, family and friends fail to notice anything has changed.
49;There is a decidedly very British strain of humour running throughout that should still travel well
50;I particularly liked the bit when Bill Nighy downplays his injury stating he had his inoculations when he holidayed on the 'isle of wight'.
51;this really is a unique piece of work and I for one hope it is a roaring success when it is released stateside.
52;I cant understand why this film is considered by some to be something special.
53;The film may have played better in England, but a good British movie works anywhere.
54;E. g., carefully watch the opening sequence and you'll see part of what I mean.
55;The funniest scene has to be when they're dealing with the zombied pub owner all to the beat of a Queen song.
56;notch British zombie comedy, the steelbook is incredibly sleek and looks great on a Blu.
57;I enjoyed this movie because it was funny and did not lag at all.
58;You will be entertained thoughout.
59;Saw Hot Fuzz first, which was also great.
60;This movie is a great comedy.
61;Great movie in the tradition of British comedies with smart, sharp writing and great acting.
62;It's simply a great action comedy.
63;It's a great cast, drawn to a delightful romp of a script.
64;Simon Pegg does a brilliant job of playing Shaun.
65;I LOVE this movie and the humor!
66;It was about time somebody made a zombie movie that was both scary and funny at the same time!
67;I just love this movie.
68;Simon Pegg is a genius.
69;It's one of those movies everyone must see.
70;I would definitely recommend this movie to friends and family even though it is older now.
71;for as much British humor that was supposed to be in the film, it really seemed like a contemporary American comedy for most of the start.
72;It's the same pop culture reference name dropping brand of humor that has developed over here in the last 10 or so years.
73;The drunk girl zombie in the garden is pure Dude Where's My Car.
74;while it's all very amusing it's more like a Oh yeah, that was clever laugh you'll get out of it.
75;The leads are ridiculously amusing.
76;I love the films style and cuts as well.
77;I have bought this movie and given it as a gift several times.
78;British humor and zombie movies, what more could a geek ask for?
79;Brilliantly written and wonderfully acted by a couple of guys who know what it takes: write what you know and write what you love.
80;a very British movie, a kinda odd and funny movie.
81;I do recommend this movie but not for young people
82;My family and I have a kind of sick love for really, really stupid movies, so we thought we were good to go with this one.
83;But actually, it was very funny, very smart.
84;i recommend this movie to all who like zaney humor.
85;I really enjoy this movie.
86;Very good comedy, a bit of horror (zombies look realistic) and a definite romantic comedy.
87;After seeing Hot Fuzz by the same team, I knew I had to see the movie again.
88;It's just as good as I remember it and I caught new things watching it again.
89;I invited a few friends over to watch it and they liked it too.
90;I'm a huge fan of zombie movies.
91;This is a great movie.
92;It was in great condition/new.
93;I am pleased with the service.
94;Amazing that I liked it.
95;The best zombies ever were in the Michael Jackson video Thriller.
96;Both of them hated it, and I loved it.
97;Like the other reviewer said, it's intellectual humour.
98;I told my family, when you take out the non.
99;scary zombies, it's just a story about a guy and his friends/girlfriend.
100;That's what I liked about it.
101;I do not like scary movies, but I love this.
102;stop funny, and yet somehow very realistic.
103;The only thing I really liked was Bill Nighy, who is a great actor and was funny (but I should say I think the actors were all fine.
104;When the city suddenly gets taken over by the living dead Shaun finds the perfect opportunity to prove himself to Liz, so he sets out to save the day, win his girlfriend back and keep his mum, Barbara, from being eaten by his step.
105;The film is also very clever, with a clear social commentary running throughout.
106;But if you do get it, then good for you, because there is a lot of great stuff to be seen here.
107;The script is wonderful and throws up many comedic moments, such as when Shaun and Ed are looking through Shaun's LP collection for a suitable vinyl to throw at two oncoming zombies, Dire Straits?
108;One minute it's a comedy, then it's a drama and then it's a full blown horror.
109;One extremely gory part in particular is a clear homage to another famous horror film that shall remain unamed, but if you know what I'm talking about when you see it then good for you.
110;I can assure you that most will like it.
111;If you don't, then I really am sorry for you as this is about the most fun I have had in the cinema since Kill Bill .
112;It's not without its faults though, losing its spark slightly during the third act but it comes back with a vengence and gets in some really good jokes just before the credits roll.
113;shaun Of The Dead is a great film.
114;It's funny, it's clever and it's got zombies in it!
115;Just when the British film industry appears to be dead this gem pops up and shows us what someone with a sense of humour and a real passion for the media can achieve.
116;Go watch it, you'll laugh till it hurts!
117;This movie mixes horror with comedy very well, making it a solid comedic performance.
118;One of the best things about this movie is that, for a while, no one notices!
119;They soon figure out the truth, and the fun begins.
120;Besides a fun plot, you'll find an endless supply of one.
121;This was fun to watch, I bought this film after watching 'Hot Fuzz' which was hilarious.
122;Although Shaun of the Dead was not as funny, it was still a great movie and one that I will watch over and over again.
123;com and as always the service was of a high standard.
124;This is by far one of the funiest movies I have ever seen.
125;While the movie does loose some steam halfway through, it picks right up at the end.
126;The extras are funny, and some of the cut scenes actually add to the final result.
127;Add this movie to your colection!
128;I loved (and still) this movie about a romantic comedy with zombies.
129;Some extra features are included.
130;A great comedy/horror hybrid but was looking forward to the commentary promised on the back and it's just not there.
131;Witty, smart, funny and clever all around.
132;I am very happy with the ending they chose.
133;i thought that the mix of comedy and the mix of horror went well.
134;You start out with Shaun and his friend Ed living their lives and eventually Shaun has to deal with a breakup.
135;This is the best zombie movie ever made.
136;It's funny, if you can handle british comedy.
137;I recomend this movie to everyone.
138;I'll admit, I love British comedies.
139;This movie is personal a 5.
140;It's funny, because they're just normal people in a weird situation.
141;If you like British comedy, you'll love this.
142;I have a friend that does, but I'm more of 'a once you see one undead person, you've seen them all' type of person.
143;What I liked was the fresh approach on an absurb topic.
144;Very funny movie at a terrific price.
145;Shaun leads such a dead lifestyle, which is what makes it so funny.
146;The dialogue is fantastic, and I don't know about everyone else, but some moments actually made me jump.
147;I could laugh my head off and be sort of scared at the same time.
148;He decides that the best thing to do would be to go get his mom, his ex.
149;anyway, I definitely recommend this movie.
150;It's funny, kinda scary, campy.
151;This movie is one of the best horror comedies of alltime, this is one of two movies that i have actually laughed outloud at[the other is donnie darko].
152;monthly he works in an appliance store, and has one up.
153;his life, in fact, is so sh*tty it takes him a few days to even realize that zombies have begun to take over england, but when he finds it out, its a record throwin, skull bashin, jaguar stealin, wall climbin, flesh eatin, good time, I cant wait to see it again!
154;It's funny, has a good storyline, and good character development.
155;I enjoyed it from beginning to end, even the end is good!
156;The funniest comedy horror movie made.
157;I've always liked this movie and gave it as a gift for Christmas and know the person receiving always wanted it to watch!
158;It's an excellent movie to add to your collection
159;This is one of my favorite movies.
160;It came in great condition, new.
161;Have no problems with it and would definitely recommend it to others!
162;Thanks to my discovery of On Demand, I found it!
163;Having now seen it, the word is right.
164;This movie is a funny, gory blast from start to finish.
165;It has all the zombie cliches in there, and it has a heck of a time having fun with it all.
166;It's wonderfully conceived and sharply directed.
167;Before long, Shaun and his friend Ed(Nick Frost), are getting everyone together and battling the zombies to stay alive.
168;The movie is also very funny.
169;What was surprising to me, was that the humor was also kind of American as well.
170;The cast itself is up for the fun, and Pegg makes Shaun very likeable and relatable.
171;Nighy is a superb actor(and he's great as Davy Jones in the new Pirates movie), and he makes the most of his role here as Shaun's stepfather.
172;The movie doesn't really have any huge social significance like the zombie films of George Romero, but it celebrates all the fun of the zombie movie, with having nice humor along for the ride.
173;Some fans don't like the mix, but it works like gangbusters here.
174;They gave some reason, but really, it's a passing thought.
175;It's all about the gore, the head smacks, the humor, and the notion of this extraordinary thing happening to ordinary people with extra ordinary lives.
176;He's a twenty nine year old who lives with his two best friends Ed and Pete.
177;My husband and brothers (being stereotypical males) love this movie and think it's great.
178;I definitely give them props for that.
179;I love a good funny zombie movie and this just might be my favorite.
180;This was a really fun movie.
181;It has cool looking zombies, a couple surprises and good characters.
182;A brilliant Zombie film and a even better comedy.
183;So this makes it hte best zombie comedy ever with a small bit of romance added to it for good measure.
184;it's a very funny film and is a must have and is one of the top comedy films around.
185;The film works in so many way's the acters work off each other well, the script is brilliant in a stange way (like most zombie and comedy films) and the it's also the little bit's that you catch out of the corner off your eye or 2nd time around that make this a brilliant film and a must have.
186;This movie got great reviews from both critics and audiences on Rotten Tomatoes.
187;There are so many things that make this movie work!
188;It's a must own for me!
189;glad to see he's developing such good taste!
190;I laughed from start to finish, even though there are some truly horrifying moments sprinkled in.
191;factor is high, and the story is great.
192;The best zombie parody since DEAD ALIVE!
193;I'm happy to report it met all my expectations.
194;It's clever, funny and has a healthy dose of gore.
195;Words fail me
196;the film is shot very well, and the zombies are perfectly slow and stupid.
197;if you love funny movies, then this is for you!
198;Great old fashioned zombie tail morphed into a dry, british black comedy.
199;A blast to watch, if you understand british humor.
200;Hilarious and clever, with a couple gore shots that will really surprise you.
201;Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are great duo.
202;It is the first really fresh farce I've seen since the Airplane/Naked Gun continuum of cookie cutter comedies started to run in the early 1980's.
203;The movie is well photographed, smart, clever and funny.
204;The humor is a little goofy (imagine if your high school class clown were allowed the budget and resources to make a serious movie), but it is satisfying.
205;The filmmaker is well versed in traditional zombie movie/Night of the Living Dead cinematic mythology, and you'll see a lot of familiar horror movie symbols skewered.
206;The tradition of British humor which prides itself on originality of thinking is a key element at work in the success of Shawn of the Dead.
207;There's always something new to see.
208;wARNING: As I said, this is a smart movie!
209;Like all of the best comedy there are some barbed social comments at work here.
210;this is the best kind of zombie movie of all.
211;son made me do it and I laughed myself sick.
212;It's droll, well paced, beautfully acted and just, well, gorgeously silly.
213;It is a very British film .
214;I also liked the absence of a token Hollywood face there for box.
215;a film with something for everyone.
216;it's nice to see a horror film that features a regular person leading a regular life rather than some blond, glamourous hunk or a group of privleged teens.
217;pegg is delightfully dumpy as shaun, and there is excellent on.
218;i thought one of the most intriguing bits was at the very beginning, in which the viewer watches various individuals whose lives are caught up in dreary, mundane routines whose movements and demeanor are already zombie.
219;eating undead, thus reinforcing the message that modern life makes zombies of us all.
220;the film's conclusion offers a humourous twist, as the survivors of z. day come up with a unique solution for dealing with the hideous undead that still walk among them.
221;I bought this as a gift.
222;I told you that when I bought it.
223;And Shaun of the Dead hits the bullseye.
224;The situations that the characters find themselves in are very real.
225;proof is a great scenario.
226;But regardless, this is a great movie.
227;ray collection, Simon Peg and crew are brilliant in their comedic performance, just the right amount of every kind of humor.
228;Great for anyone who has even a vague sense of humor.
229;Now our family can enjoy a favorite of his together!
230;This is a must see for the family.
231;Watch it at least four times.
232;Everything is perfect about this movie.
233;Watch it with an open mind and really let it wash over you.
234;Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright continue their series of excellent ideas from their hilarious sitcom Spaced with some of the best screenwriting and directing in years.
235;word recurrence of the first with the dialogue providing a hilarious irony that takes several viewings of the film to fully appreciate.
236;To make things better, the cast's comic timing is superb to the point of almost being able to work telepathically with each other and Edgar Wright's use of camera angles and distinct images not only pays respects to the classics that he so reveres but also demonstrates his enormous talent in creating films with a style all his own.
237;Shaun of the Dead is easily the most rewarding movie of its kind for at least a decade and one can only hope that the excellent output from the geniuses behind it will continue long into the 21st century.
238;Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have always made a good comedy team.
239;I bought this movie years ago and I fell in love with it.
240;Truely one of the few movies truely worthy of a five star rating.
241;When she fianlly turns, groans and comes forward they says, She's drunk!
242;Another good scene is when two nighbors come at them and they try to kill them with LP's.
243;Sade, of course, is one of them.You have to be tuned into this movie from the get.
244;Of course being well versed in the prior Dead movies is a must to fully appreciate it.
245;my kids absolutely love zombie movies and this is a must have.
246;i would recommend this product.
247;It begins very well, almost perfectly, the first scenes featuring snappy direction and camera tricks together with amusing 'we're all zombies now' references ie.
248;I almost punched my fist in the air when certain of them got eaten alive.
249;Still, on the whole this parody is affectionate and sophisticated enough to be liked (and even loved) by both fans of zombie movies and of british comedy alike.
250;I heard sooooooo many good things about this movie, then I finally got to see it.
251;I've seen this done so many times before, and every one of those efforts was vastly superior to this one.
252;Check out Clockwatchers if you want to see this movie done with sympathetic characters and genuine wit.
253;Check out Free Enterprise if you want to see the Trekkie spin on it, once again with sympathetic characters and genuine wit.
254;Shaun of the Dead is the funniest horror movie I have ever seen.
255;Though I enjoy the realistic zombie shows, I like the funny ones so much better!
256;Shawn of the Dead is a must see, must own, Movie!
257;Simon Pegg is a fantastic writer and actor.
258;Simon Pegg reminds me of a modern day Don Quixote.
259;All the characters were well acted.
260;see for lovers of gory comedy.
261;thought out, and well proportioned mix of laughs, gore, and drama.
262;The dialogue is witty and the plot is well.
263;I highly recommend to any zombie fan.
264;If you like British comedy, this is for you.
265;They manage to poke fun at every zombie movie you've ever seen.
266;tag band of friends, dry humor, and a desperate dash for the Winchester.
267;one of my favorite movies for sure.
268;Loved it everything was easy thank you!!
269;Will shop again because it was so easy to do and the products are a great selection.
270;I like zombie stuff and this move has that along with some very funny scenes.
271;This is my all time favorite movie.
272;more on the humorous side, it had a little bit of every thing in it, great for all types of people
273;I love zombie films and this is the BEST zombie comedy out there!
274;I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in a comedy with a little bit of horror.
275;Entertains the friends and family.
276;One of my favorite movies to watch.
277;If you like zombies and humor it is a must see.
278;liners and visual gags, Shaun of the Dead succeeds most of the time as both an enjoyable spoof and as a fond tribute to the Romero.
279;the characterisation is surprisingly strong and Shaun's (brilliantly played by Simon Pegg) tribulations and hang.
280;ups will elicit nods of recognition from many of us I expect!Some extremely laddish humour, interspersed with wry and often very perceptive observational comedy, ensures continued interest, and the action scenes are genuinely dramatic and effective.
281;huge amount of extras make this great value for money.
282;not Oscar material maybe, but still a highly entertaining movie, which should appeal to those who enjoy the likes of the Evil Dead 2/3 and American Werewolf in London.
283;Like those movies, Shaun of the Dead is almost certainly destined for similar cult status.
284;A couple of weeks ago my friends and I went to the movies to see Team America.
285;It could have been very cheesy so we just sat there and and about half way through, we all realized this was one of the best character comedies we'd seen, one of the scariest films in a while and a truly heartfelt film about love and friendship.
286;This is a film that will be cherished for years.
287;This has to be the funniest movie I've seen and I've seen a lot of movies!
288;It's thrilling and so entertaining!
289;This is on my top 3 movies.
290;It has a great cast and great plot.
291;It's a must see movie!
292;also, I believe a lot of people are saying they like it to fit in.
293;funny movie i love simon pegg and his humor.
294;some zombies are scary for a comedy i can watch all day
295;I just bought this earier in the day.
296;I recommend this to anyone.
297;I think this is one of the best zombie comedies ever made.
298;It's subtle humor for the most part, so if that's your thing you'll probably love it!
299;Though I am not a huge fan of zombie movies, it is easily one of my favorite movies of all time.
300;Brilliant writing, timing and attention to details make this movie hysterical.
301;Not only funny, but a brilliant commentary on how life can slip away from us if we don't make the most of it, as we become zombies in our day to day lives.
302;No scratches at all played beautifully!
303;All the special feautures that cone with it are great too.
304;Although not a zombie fan, I love this British comic take on the genre!
305;touting the flick's exceptional funny, its glorious messy, and its marvelous silly.
306;And for a second thing, I found it genuinely suspenseful .
307;The very same theme was tackled much more effectively without zombies in American Beauty, and much better with zombies in Shaun of the Dead .
308;a film which actually manages to make a clever statement on the subject.
309;much of the perceived hilarity in this film occurs at the beginning and the end, wherein the satire is more light.
310;The great conceit of the first thirty.
311;a deftly executed surgical extraction of a man from his suffocating safety zone, and a grim (yet oddly uplifting) morality fable about appreciating what you have without unthinking presumption.
312;All in all, I thought this was a damn fine film and I really enjoyed it.
313;It's funny how they like to make fun of zombie movie's whitch is great cause it's like there saying oh people are getting board seeing the samething happening in zombie movie's so why don't we make it more fun and exciteing and that's what they did in this movie, this and dead and breakfest were the only two zombie comedy movies that came out, they should make more zombie comedy movie's but this movie was great and funny.
314;I LOVED Paul and thought I would give this movie a try.
315;Wow, what a difference, with Shaun of the Dead
316;There are scenes, like the one in the garden, that'll make you laugh until you cry.
317;Even though there's British humor that as an American I dont understand, it's still great.
318;see especially if you like zombie movies.
319;I just want to say that I enjoyed this comedy.
320;i like all movies, and I also love the movie Dawn of the Dead, and this movie was a very funny counterpart.
321;This comedy about the Zombies or 'mobile dead' is wickedly funny, especially the light symbolism scattered through.
322;out (the living often resembling the 'undead' in their life.
323;styles, etc.) Very well done, and not so gruesome that younger family members can't watch.
324;I have to admit, I heard about this movie through word of mouth a year ago.
325;A friend of mine from Southhampton, UK said it was the funniest movie he'd seen all year.
326;Every scene with Shaun and slacker roomie Ed are priceless.
327;Will Shaun's attempt to get friends, family and ex.
328;But what's really brilliant about it is that it doesn't limit itself to comedy and zombie.
329;killing, but also makes subtle commentary about real.
330;director Edgar Wright and his co. writer (and star of the film) Simon Pegg decide to take their time in the beginning of the film to establish the characters and their quirks, and this is an excellent strategy, because it sets up everything else that follows.
331;I laughed hysterically for nearly the entire length of the movie, especially so at the end when the fate of the zombies is revealed.
332;It's the perfect ending to an excellent film.
333;Finally, a movie that does everything right!
334;The humor is witty and smart, as is most british comedy, but not as dry as you might expect.
335;I still crack up every time I see it.
336;This one is definitely going down as a classic!
337;Real simple, if you are a zombie fan, watch it.
338;and I just love this movie.
339;This film is superb fun, and has plenty of really good laughs as well as brilliant scenes with zombies.
340;It's a very inventive film that lifts the horror.
341;this is a really enjoyable bit of nonsense that I'd recommend to anyone.
342;The new movie coming out with the two guys from this movie will be good too I bet!
343;This is a great comedy.
344;Talk about your black humor, this movie hits all the right chords!!
345;I am not going to summarize the movie, since another reviewer did a pretty accurate job, but I will recommend this movie for fans of Peter Jackson's 'Dead Alive' Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness'.
346;It has a campy feel to it, although it was never cheesy and has some clever scenes.
347;There are scenes that'll make you jump out of your seat, and other scenes that will make you laugh.
348;The acting is great, I love the attitudes these characters have facing their pending doom.
349;This is the best movie I've scene all year!!
350;The film has its share of gore, including one very gory scene while it still has its laughs.
351;Pretty short intro mind you.
352;There's also Pete, who can't stand Ed of course.
353;the acting is surprisingly strong too with a great scene involving a Reservoir Dogs spoof involving a mexican standoff.
354;One of the few movies that can do this.
355;women who have amazing taste and aren't morons will love this movie for it's subversive humor, gore, and all.
356;It's a delightful romp through the cliches of typical zombie.
357;film horror and takes parodying to a hilarious level.
358;You'll love it, and it's a great movie for couples to watch.
359;Heard about this movie from my neice,(have to give her credit for the acronym for Zombie Comedy) Absolutley hilarious, just a good fun laugh out loud movie.
360;Shaun of the Dead was hilarious!
361;I do enjoy the horror/comedy features, a few of my favorites being Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (1992) aka Braindead, and the Sam Raimi/Bruce Campbell Evil Dead features.
362;While watching the movie one familiar with films that came before can't help but feel those responsible for this feature are true fans of the genre, and horror films in general, given the immense amount of references included, in terms of visuals, the script, and various other aspects of the production, all of which can be identified by activating a special Zomb.
363;I also really enjoyed the thoughtfulness in the structure of the movie, for example, near the beginning, before the influx of the zombies, we see Shaun walking to a nearby store, and there's a good amount of normal, street activity (a kid playing, a man washing his car, a homeless man begging for change, etc.).
364;Another great sequence in this regard was when Shaun and Ed had it out, in front of the pub, surrounded by hundreds of dead eyed spectators.
365;I thought the performances all really good (both Pegg and Frost stood out for me), and the characters completely distinctive and interesting.
366;The direction was excellent, as the use of various gimmicks done especially well, keeping me interested rather than distracting.
367;As far as the zombies and special effects in general, I thought they were all done very well, resulting in excellent production values for a film of this type, this type being a relatively independent feature made on a relatively modest budget (this film cost a reportedly 4 million to make, while George Romero's 2005 Land of the Dead cost about 15 million).
368;the picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1), looks very sharp and clear, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio comes through very clean.
369;As far as the special features, there are a good amount of them related to the film, of which I won't list as the Amazon website does this well enough, but not so much as to overwhelm.
370;My husband got this to watch with our granddaughter because she was into a big zombie Halloween this year (he loved it in the past).
371;eating zombies in a wickedly funny twist on the whole Dawn of the 28 Living Dead Days Later genre with VERY entertaining results.
372;Shaun is a loveably sympathetic character and (best friend) Ed provides endless laughs.
373;there is SOME gore (usually presented in a gratuitously humorous manner) but the demeanor of the film is quite light.
374;it is one of my absolute favorite feel good zombie flicks!!
375;you've got RED on you.
376;This movie is definetely at the top of my funniest movies ever list.
377;It is well worth $20, and is guaranteed to have you on the floor laughing.
378;Edgar Wright's SHAUN OF THE DEAD is an absolute zombie masterpiece!
379;This movie is the RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD of this generation.
380;SHAUN is 1 of a very small # of absolutely flawless zombie movies!
381;In my opinion Zack Snyder's DAWN 04 and Edgar Wright's SHAUN OF THE DEAD have SAVED a genre that was on life support and is now alive and living very well in the hearts of new and younger zombie fans like my 9 year old little brother who loved both movies and keeps hounding me to watch all the zombie classics that i have collected over the years.
382;I thank both Zack Snyder and Edgar Wright for making such great new classic's and also for turning my 9 year old little brother into a new generation zombie fan!!!
383;also Shaun, unlike the Evil Deads, has a killer rock soundtrack, better (and more fleshed out.
384;ass sidekick and even a couple of moments when you may shed a tear or two.
385;plus a wonderful ending that I kinda saw coming but not quite!
386;Quirky, odd, fast paced and funny with a horror movie twist.
387;In typical British fashion this movie is a great escape for a few hours to a what if kind of world.
388;If you like british humor you should love this movie.
389;All great movies with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.
390;My mother cant get enough of watching this movie and she is 84 yrs old she also loves the walkingdead .
391;Had to get this to watch the whole thing, I caught the end of it on t. v. It's pretty funny for a spoof, and definitely memorable.
392;Funny movie
393;Highly recommended for anyone that likes zombie movies, and slapstick, offbeat humor.
394;Simon Pegg is hilarious as Shaun in this British horror spoof.
395;Alongside his mother, his best friend, his girlfriend and her friends they fight for survival against the flesh eating zombies.
396;It was funny, witty and at some times even a bit scary.
397;The British humor is not always my cup of tea, but it's approached brilliantly here that every minute is enjoyable.
398;Well it's a great movie and I wanted it added to our collection of blue.
399;It was a super price too!
400;Okay, I can't stand the overuse of profanity in movies, but once I ignored that fact I really enjoyed this spoof about zombie movies.
401;Shaun of the Dead has a character all its own.
402;He has that it factor people always talk about .
403;a universal appeal if you will.
404;He is great at what he does .
405;Pegg makes this movie a blast to watch, and I'll bet he made it a lot of fun to film too.
406;does a wonderful job as Shaun's girlfriend.
407;earth person who manages to make her role in a spoof movie still be interesting.
408;But that is what this movie does best
409;and Shaun's mother (though they seem delighted at the prospect of killing Shaun's step.
410;this movie is extremely well acted
411;And I was laughing the whole time
412;there's also a bonus aspect of this movie: it serves as a great social commentary.
413;for example, when he hits a man with his car, he backs up to see if the man is alright.
414;Shaun of the Dead is one of those flicks you can watch again and again, because it's that good.
415;Superb acting, clever writing, an intriguing plot, and genuine laughs and thrills.
416;This is one of my favorite movies.
417;There are so many small things that make the movie great.
418;Its that attention to detail.
419;Simply a great movie that's funny with enough intelligent parts to really carry it through.
420;Shaun of the Dead is a wonderfully written, well directed tribute to old zombie movies such as The Evil Dead and Dawn of the Dead.
421;And a tribute it is too, as opposed to an all.
422;The zombies act like real zombies, and the humour comes from the actors.
423;Shaun of the Dead is probably one of the funniest movies of 2004, and certainly a lesson to film.
424;time classic, and easily ranks in my top three zombie movies ever made.
425;And mind you, I live, eat, breathe, sleep, and chainsaw these things.
426;perfect as the reluctant zombie slayer), a one.
427;Shaun of the Dead is a full.
428;It's just one of those rarest of ghoulish gemstones: a horror movie with a wickedly black sense of humor and an impeccable, deeply British, sense of timing.
429;And the timing here is perfect.
430;is one of the best sequences in cinematic history.
431;He's backed up by cinematographer David Dunlap, who serves as heavy weapons tech on on the cinematic black magic: my God, this movie looks good!
432;And let's back up a bit.
433;Question: which flick delivered the most pure, unadulterated, zombie.
434;Shaun of the Dead succeeds, largely, by animating more than just dead bodies.
435;It's intensely horrific, insanely gripping, and happily disgusting.
436;Shaun of the Dead brings it all home with a double.
437;now: watch Shaun and Ed's reaction when they're putting their first zombie down.
438;at the passing of the world they knew, the world of X. box, Indian take.
439;It's the end of the world as we know it, and we don't feel fine.
440;Drink up, Mate, and pass the ammunition.
441;A great film, and really offers such a refreshing viewpoint and sense of humor compared to what I normally watch.
442;this one is really great, and I highly recommend you check it out.
443;This movie is a parody and well done.
444;I liked it a lot and you will too watch it.
445;It was one of the best movies of the year.
446;I love zombie movies and this one referenced them all.
447;It is a laugh riot but the looming horror keeps you on the edge of your seat.
448;The film that I think comes closest as far as marrying these elements is An American Werewolf in London from 1981 but I think this film is more successful.
449;Pegg is excellent in the title role, handling both the comic and action demands superbly.
450;Nick Frost as Ed, Shaun's best friend, is a hoot.
451;He's good here and was the best thing in the otherwise turgid Love Actually.
452;i enjoyed the film, due to wonderful performances and the funny way that hell on earth so slowly impinges on Shaun's existence.
453;I was bothered by several scenes in which characters have extended, pointless conversations with each other while in the midst of an attack, but I was won back by the fresh take on a familiar genre and sharp social commentary.
454;Amazing to see the evolution of Nick Frost as an actor.
455;I'm American, but I enjoy a lot of British humor .
456;Yes, there are some funny moments.
457;It does a good job of showing how ordinary .
458;Shaun of the Dead is definitely tongue in cheek zombie humour.
459;The movie is more centered on Shaun winning back his girlfriend than surviving the undead plague rampaging the island.
460;There is a play within a play as the surviving group attempts their best zombie impersonations in order to ascertain safety in their local pub.
461;The extras (i. e. zombies) act brilliantly as well, and keep the film moving along.
462;In the end, boy wins back girl, and gets to have it all as you will see in his shed at the end of the movie.
463;quentin Tarantino said it was the best film he saw all year.
464;The comedy is superb, The horror is genuinely frightening, the emotion is touching and real .
465;there is a reason why this is an instant cult classic.
466;I thought shaun of the dead was a very funny horror comedy.
467;i recomend this movie to everyone who loves comedys.
468;it was a good thing i bought an import of the movie because it doesn't look like its gonna be in theaters in Oshkosh Wiscosin.
469;So see the movie if you can.
470;this is a good movie but dont expect it to be as good as hot fuzz
471;Turns out you can be funny about zombies and still take them seriously.
472;Though a comedy this film does have some dramatic points, one includes a spoof of a classic scene from Reservoir Dogs.
473;Nick Frost is really funny as Shaun's friend Ed and the soundtrack is great and has alot of funny moments in it.
474;Romero loved this film so much he asked Pegg and director Edgar Wright to appear in his new film Land of the Dead as zombies.
475;Until then I will enjoy this good zombie movie.
476;There are a lot of zombie movies these days but this is one of my favorites.
477;It's about the most realistic movie also.
478;if you like British humor, Benny Hill, Monty Python antics, this show is for you.
479;the acting in this movie is amazing, Simon Pegg (Shaun) and Nick Frost (Ed) giving stunning performances with perfect comic timing, they play off each other extremely well and there isn't a moment in the movie that you don't believe these two are childhood pals.
480;this movie although a comedy still remains true to its zombie subplot with lots of gore and amazing visuals, I am a huge fan of zombie films and this one is by far my favorite.
481;fans of George A Romero will definitely enjoy this funny and scary romantic/zombie/comedy.
482;It's a classic that I'll be watching for years to come!
483;She just might thank you afterwords!
484;I absolutley loved the film, thought it was hilarious but there are a few reasons why i would.
485;So for me to see Simon Pegg make it onto the bigscreen in a film that is basically 'his' was a real joy.
486;This was a great series, that picked up a very cult following (being on the UK's Channel 4, the mother of all Cult channels here).
487;What i loved about this film is exactly what i loved about the series Spaced.
488;another great piece of work was the 'doppelgangers'.
489;The use of the 'C' word was so funny i choked on my drink anyway :)Anyway truly this film is great fun, and its typical and perfect Simon Pegg, for those that care .
490;Short and sweet review:Like the zombie genre but capable of laughing at it?
491;Just like laughing?Answer yes to either of the above then this is a movie for you.
492;up of zombie movies but with a surprising streak of sweetness running throughout, this movie appeals to many people I know who would normally say no if asked if they like British comedy or zombie movies.
493;Last night we watched with friends who had never seen it and found ourselves (and everyone) laughing even harder than when we first saw it.
494;A must in the halloween movie rotation.
495;Well as far as zombie comedies go this is for sure one of the best.
496;Great spoof on clasic zombie story line hat will keep you laughing as long as you can get into British humor.
497;You know from the opening credits that this movie is going to be a classic.
498;The 3 headed zombie beating to the Queen song is one of the greatest scenes in the movie.
499;I cant get enough of it!
500;If you like British humor and zombies then this movie is for you.
501;imposed ennui to take control of his life.
502;highly recommended
503;I bought it as a gift for someone because it's one of their favorite movies.
504;I'm happy because it looks like I bought it at the store.
505;I caught this gem one night on cable, and I've been hooked ever since.
506;I was already a fan of Pegg/Frost/Wright from Spaced, and thier foray into film is a triumph.
507;Standout performances from Simon and Nick, and a terrific but all too small perfomance by Bill Nighy.
508;The special features were excellent, similar to the ones on their Spaced sets (Outtakes, Homage.
509;Movie is amazing, but it took FOREVER for it to arrive to my mailbox.
510;I'd recommend this and Hot Fuzz which is by the same director.
511;The writing is suprisingly intelligent and altogether tongue.
512;often followed by a burst of laughter.
513;Yet another additive that sets this film apart from the rest of the genre is that all the characters are worth rooting for and caring about.
514;There are actually some touching scenes with authentic emotions indicating that although there are many ridiculous moments loaded with humor, these are real people caught in a life or death situation.
515;The way this film shifts from true horror and pain to slapstick (sometimes literally slapstick) makes this a remarkable creation.
516;This is a superb addition to the genre.
517;Very FAST service and am quite please.
518;Will watch it again and again for it is so FUNNY!!!
519;I have to start by saying that, in my opinion, Shaun of the Dead is one of the funniest English comedies ever.
520;The tag line says it all A romantic comedy, with zombies.
521;The humor is nonstop and at times can be very subtle as with most British movies.
522;If you want a good romantic comedy that won't put you to sleep, I highly recommend this movie.
523;The horror genre has an interesting relationship to comedy.
524;up comedian during his slashing sequences, the dividing line has become more and more blurred, until we reach this film, Shaun of the Dead, which is simulaneously a romantic comedy, a straight.
525;It is very well done, it is very smart.
526;because of all it brings to the table, the movie can be enjoyed by just about anyone, but fans of horror films (and zombie movies in particular) will get the most out of the references and allusions.
527;moan, it helps to know what it sounds like.
528;back story, surrounded by Satan spawn who eat human flesh.
529;the romance works, the parody works (I'd say Comic *Silver*, as opposed to Comic Gold), the horror kind of works.
530;A worthy example of genre.
531;A fun movie to watch.
532;If you've seen the preview of this movie, then you've seen all of the best parts in the entire thing.
533;Just watch the preview, and you'll have seen all of the good parts.
534;it's one of those movies that you would want to keep going back to watch and with the steel book edition its a nice fit to a collection
535;Shaun of the Dead is a real pleasure.
536;Quite funny throughout as we watch sleppy.
537;Gorey in a delightfully silly way, comically scarey and a whole lot of fun.
538;whole family loves this movie.
539;would recommend it to everyone.
540;one of our favorite movies.
541;I expected great things from Shaun of the Dead as it came from the makers of Spaced, the finest sitcom of the past decade.
542;it's surreal, packed with references, true to life, incredibly funny, ironic, warm, quite scary and extremely well directed, acted and edited.
543;co. uk, and order the Spaced Collector's Edition along with this movie.
544;This was one of the most clever, funny movies I have ever seen.
545;There were actually scary moments and frights.
546;And that was just 2 of the many hilarious moments.
547;This is keeper and a classic!
548;Great comedy for all ages and would recommend highly to all.
549;A smash hit romantic comedy, with zombies.
550;Shaun of the Dead is a great zombie movie in its own right and nails both the horror and the comedy.
551;the comedy in the film is so slick you may have to watch multiple times to catch it all.
552;Just something you have to notice to realize how funny that is) pay attention to all the back ground action (was that couple making out or was she just eating his neck?)
553;Don't worry there are still some nice fall down humor and inappropriate words to giggle at.You can see the love of the zombie films these film makers have and the layers they use to tell their story is amazing.
554;Also inventive is the use of foreshadowing.
555;there's a whole slew of this kind of thing along with the fact its a great comedy and horror (don't believe me?
556;If you like intelligent comedies or zombies or hey, there's a romance plot in there too, then you'll love this.
557;Shaun of the Dead is a good horror movie which intjects some off the cuff humor to great results.
558;I could easily go on about memorable characters, social commentary, and great performances
559;this movie is very clever.
560;this is a buddy movie as well as comedy zombie flick.
561;the movie has a romance bit in it and shaun is admirable in his intentions and in the end there is a happy ending.
562;I was pleasantly surprised by the originality of this film in light of it being a zomie flick.
563;Shaun of the Dead is an original treat, loaded with character, huge doses of fun, charm and wit.
564;This film is a must for fans of a true horror comedy.
565;if you didn't get it please check to see that your sense of humor was not surgically removed and watch the movie again.
566;Simon Pegg and Nick Frost deliver their best performance, in my opinion.
567;A mixture of comedy and a few scares.
568;I've always been a fan of their movies and this one is definitely my favorite.
569;The steelbook has great art.
570;but zombie films are revitalized by the wickedly funny Shaun of the Dead, a tale of music, love, pubs, and the slobbering undead.
571;In the vein of Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, it's full of twisted humour, funny dialogue and plenty of gore.
572;a very funny one, with lots of gore.
573;It's gory, and the ending gets a bit cliched and overserious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments.
574;everybody knows guys like Shaun and Ed.
575;Pegg perfectly plays a slacker with a heart of gold, who would like to be more than he is, but doesn't have the slightest clue how to go about it.
576;while it's a hilarious movie, it's not a spoof .
577;rather it's a zombie movie with wit, love and comedy.
578;All I ever heard about this movie was how funny it was.
579;the movie is extremely funny in a British way, like a new generation of Monty Python.
580;Its played wacky at some moments and serious, but really funny, at other times.
581;And it's this balance between the two that make this movie as funny as it is.
582;The movie is also a nice homage to past George Romero zombie films, which I really enjoyed because I'm a big fan of that whole trilogy.
583;And what better place to go than the local pub.
584;But its the reason the movie worked so well.
585;It was able to so finely walk the line between good horror movie, great comedy and winning romance all wrapped into one nice little package.
586;another welcome return is the walking zombies.
587;It's a movie you will watch, and watch, and watch, and think of lines or scenes from the movie in your every day life and laugh.
588;This movie is awesome a great combination of fright and laughter.
589;I highly recommmend this film.
590;This is one of the first movies to have comedy and horror it was a great mix.
591;It's hilarious and horrifying, often at the same time.
592;Shaun and Ed are two very believable slackers who I'd very much like to hang out with.
593;mind you, this movie does seem to shift attitudes a lot.
594;This would make an excellent double feature with the new DAWN OF THE DEAD.
595;Even if you're one of the folks who don't typically like British Comedy, I think it'll pleasantly surprise you.
596;I am not much into British humor, but I have to admit that I really enjoyed viewing this movie.
597;If you are looking for a light comedic movie, with a adventurous twist I would suggest Shaun of the Dead.
598;I understand that it's a comedy about some juvenile delinquents dealing with the zombie apocalypse.
599;I am squeamish, and Shaun of the Dead is so funny that I was able to sit through most of it.
600;I enjoy being able to share in a family tradition, and my age is showing by choosing this undead movie over newer ones.
601;The language is filthy, which for British comedy adds to the humor.
602;This movie is cheap and WAY worth it!
603;This is such a hysterically funny movie that you wont stop laughing while youre wondering who becomes a zombie next.
604;Watch this insanely entertaining movie!
605;Love this movie and if you like a good funny zombie movie .
606;simon pegg is great and so is the rest of the cast
607;Shawn of the Dead is destined to be a cult classic.
608;Love these guys, love all their films!
609;The best part of this movie for me comes with the special features, where they acknowledge the plot holes and attempt to explain them instead of just hoping people forget it.
610;It's the icing on top of an already fantastic cake.
611;This particular comedy, co. written by Edgar Wright and Britcom actor Simon Pegg (Spaced) is a true homage to the old Romero zombie movies, with plenty of hints to let fellow fans know where they got their ideas.
612;unlike this summer's remade Dawn of the Dead, this movie stays true to the old formula.
613;Low budgets, decent acting, dark humor, blood, and of course, tons of slow moving zombie extras.
614;The mixture of this classic formula with a North London flair is successful,and though the British humor is familiar, it is also fresh and well, funny.
615;this is a good movie to see with the lights off, as there are some pretty scary bits.
616;Lots of good spooks and scenes lifted straight from the old Romero trilogy will leave fans howling in delight.
617;Extremely funny, lots of surprises, Timothy Dalton.
618;it's one of my favorites.
619;Maybe I'll have a festival today, and watch this one, Paul , and Hot Fuzz again.
620;This film is simply great.
621;One of the best zombie films ever made.
622;The one's that actually gave this movie a good review, must really like this kind of humor.
623;Pegg and Wright are big fans of George A. Romero's works, and they wanted to creataed a zombie film of their own.
624;And what they did was give it their all.
625;Pegg and Frost make a great duo as they knock out every zombie that gets in their way.
626;Everything, the music, the editing, the cinematography, EVERYTHING works here.
627;Another classic in the living dead genre.
628;Each type has their respective merits).
629;SotD has all three, and done well enough so I'd pay to see the movie again.
630;ordinary people are caught up in extraordinary events, and they must rise to the occasion or die.
631;Nothing original about that, but this time the execution is superb.
632;A couple things in particular stand out:First, the humor is superlative, and I can't rave enough about it.
633;loud moments alone are enough to recommend this flick.
634;SotD delivers plenty of gruesome human.
635;zombie interactions, particularly during the climactic last stand at Shaun's beloved Winchester pub.
636;finally, the relationships between the characters and their personal struggles ring true, and will appeal to any self.
637;His crisis transformation from slacker to savior is nicely done.
638;The chemistry between the main characters is spot.
639;A good portion of the comedy results from their interactions, especially between Shaun and his slovenly roommate/best friend Ed.
640;Indeed, the actors are the real reason this movie works, and without exception they do a commendable job.
641;the last two years have seen a welcome resurgence of the zombie genre, with 28 Days Later, the Dawn of the Dead remake, and now the excellent Shaun of the Dead.
642;good pacing, great characters .
643;an enjoyable romp through a clever twist on the zombie genre.
644;Ok, so I read reviews praising the movie and saw it on a lot of top 10 zombie movies lists.
645;Came exactly as shown, brand new and still in the cellophane, packaged well, and even arrived before the delivery date by a couple days!
646;Comedy, gore, story line, and great cast!!
647;Happy to have it among my collection.
648;Simply the funniest zombie flick ever!
649;Shaun of the Dead is a British comedy that represents a spoof of the now popular zombie.
650;For the definite fact is, this is ultimately a comedy through and through.
651;I was very impressed, however, and this movie was much more than I could have anticipated.
652;Still, I felt like the movie was fun, and definitely a popcorn style movie (if you can keep your stomach that is).
653;If you enjoy a good spoof, and especially if you are up with the zombie.
654;Like all good parodies, Shaun of the Dead manages to both mock and provide a good example of the genre it's spoofing.
655;but for those who take a secret delight in watching civilization and human relationships get pushed to the brink, this movie will entertain even after multiple viewings.
656;oddly enough, the original Dawn of the Dead was a deadpan (har har) satire on American consumerism, and it's fun to see those themes reemerge in a more obviously humorous setting.
657;The opening credits make it clear that zombies are already among us, and they are us.
658;be sure to watch this movie twice to catch all the background humor.
659;A great addition to any film library.
660;The BEST Zombie Movie of ALL TIME!I Love it and Watch it all the time.
661;This movie is truly a great satire while simultaneously being scary and right on the zombie money.
662;Wonderfully written, directed and acted.
663;The best zombie movie in the last 20 years.
664;Just be sure to tell your girlfriend its a romantic comedy.
665;Great movie is all i can say mostly.
666;I can watch this movie over and over again.
667;Got to also add Amazon with there amazing fast shipping!
668;Shaun is a great movie that shows what a zombie attack would be like in real life.
669;at moments, the movie is very touching and at moments very sad, even some scenes that bring you to tears.
670;And at other moments, funny as all get out!
671;This movie is good at being serious when it wants to be and funny when it wants to be.
672;Simon Pegg and Nick Frost plus Director Edgar Wright is just perfect.
673;I have rewatched this film several times and every time I enjoy it!
674;Sure its a comedic parody of the Romero zombie films, but its just great!
675;Plus a small role by the great Bill Nighy!
676;Its a Romantic comedy with zombies!
677;Someday I hope the film gets deluxe treatment in a home video release, it deserves a super special edition!Special Features:Missing Bits.
678;I love movies that know just when to make you laugh.
679;This one combines bloody zombies with brilliant humor.
680;If you can withstand over the top violence (its absurd) then this is for you.
681;Very funny movie and deserves all 5 stars.
682;Shaun of the dead is a great movie full of action and comedy.
683;I was really looking forward to seeing 'Shaun of the Dead', and since it never came to any local theaters despite the fact that it was outperforming half the films showing at those places even with a limited release, I got to look forward to seeing it even longer.
684;A fate to which House of Flying Daggers is no doubt consigned) Fortunately, it proved to be more than worth the wait, and was definitely one of the best movies in a fairly ho.
685;As far as comedies go, I think this movie's about as good as it gets.
686;alive), this film actually takes itself fairly seriously at times.
687;It works very well both when it's trying to be funny and when it's trying to be serious/dramatic/touching, and I always like films that are willing to play with tone.
688;(one of the best aspects of the original Dawn of the Dead, imo) I also particularly like the more serious bits, because it makes it abundantly obvious that the makers of the film have a genuine affection for the genre they're parodying.
689;the film has a level a visual flair and an attention to detail which are pretty extraordinary for a comedy, and quite impressive, regardless of genre.
690;They use lots of great long, steadicam shots and some fun, ultra.
691;I also like how it has the will to be subtle.
692;All I can say is that I though it was funny.
693;it's also got a surprising amount of gore, which is generally nicely done.
694;There are quite a few nicely done gunshots, and two particularly stunning headshots.
695;The zombies themselves look quite nice, though they are fairly low.
696;Definitely a great movie, which certainly must be viewed by any zombie fan.
697;the comedy is intelligent and keeps you wanting more.
698;Shaun Of The Dead is great British Film.
699;this zombie film filled with homage's and parodies of zombies films and other kinds of films.
700;zombies!Now he has to change his life around,win back his girlfriend and fight of zombies to survive.
701;also their very good supporting characters of David and Diane (there is a injoke that they look like Harry Potter and Britney Spears).
702;there is Shaun's stepfather played by Bill Nighy that everybody knows form Underworld and Love Accuatly.
703;the funny thing about this movie is that its truly funny as hell.
704;a lot of great jokes.
705;there are numerous jokes to mention.
706;one other with two other actors and one more with zombies.
707;also a couple behind the scenes videos.
708;the guys that made this film also made a Tv Series in Britain called Spaced that is very cool and funny as film.
709;with great jokes and parodies to Resident Evil even to The Conversation.
710;its one of my favorite films of 2004.
711;this movies has everything romance,comedy,good performances,great direction as well as writing and most of all Zombies!!!
712;It is because of that movie that I love playing Left for Dead 1 and 2 and any other video game with zombies.
713;They turned zombie killing into an enjoyable art.
714;This is a true cult classic that will be around for many generations to come.
715;I fight back and laugh while doing it.
716;but I really do like good satire, and good English humor and I found this movie hilarious!Maybe you even have to have lived in the UK to really appreciate the characters, but I don't think so.
717;The deadpan deliveries are so spot on that I think if you have any appreciation for dry humor, you will enjoy this.
718;In its own way, this film is a minor classic already.
719;It has created a whole new genre
720;Zombies, of course, have always been kind of humorous, with their shuffling, growling, and slowness.
721;The script was very clever, full of pathos and pratfalls, and it was as much a social commentary as it was comedic.
722;Shaun's best friend, and primary roommate, was Ed, played by Nick Frost.
723;kate Ashfield played Liz, Shaun's longtime girlfriend.
724;She wanted to dump him and move on.
725;They were quite effective, and almost stole every scene they were in.
726;Nighy is a great character actor, and he did especially well.
727;He is a fine actor.
728;It is loads of fun watching.
729;His discovery that zombies are out and about and how to kill them is great.
730;I'd have to say it's the best comedy AND the best horror movie I've seen this year.
731;The humor is witty, the social commentary sharp, and the blood and gore convincing.
732;Technically, it's also very well made.
733;Be sure to keep an eye on the background of the frame to see all sorts of strange things going on.
734;I'd recommend the movie based on those two shots alone.
735;I was excited to see this movie based on the trailers I had seen, what an incredible let down.
736;If your a fan of the zombie genre, this is the best comedy horror since Return of the Living Dead (excluding Dead Alive).
737;up, some gory moments,and plenty of inside (the genre) jokes.
738;very funny film, well made.
739;It's very funny and very well acted.
740;Very well done, directing and writing.
741;It's an all around good movie.
742;Yes, I will add a few references regarding other zombie films.
743;Shaun keeps changing the channels finding Zombie game shows and talk shows with zombie love affairs.
744;fans of Sam Rami and George A. Romero can certainly appreciate the basic zombie elements of this film.
745;I give this movie a high rating because it amuses me after watching numerous amounts of times.
746;Shaun of the dead is brilliant.
747;I have never laughed so much at a zombie movie.
748;Even George A. Romero loves this movie and has it as one of his personal collection.
749;The effects are effective, the zombies look genuinely scary and you see plenty of flesh eating in this film.
750;The way that they dispatch the zombies is equally funny.
751;I would have never thought of throwing records at zombies' heads but it's an idea that works.
752;i enjoyed this movie and then I needed a laugh so Shaun of the dead followed and it was great.
753;I love those 2 actors 
754;I have no stomach for horror movies, but I do love a good spoof.
755;shaun of the dead is yet another comedy, homage/parody of romero's movies.
756;they are about equally funny.
757;i'm adding 1 star for the very effective comedy before the zombies show up.
758;More proof to heap on the mountain of evidence that the Brits are simply the funniest race to ever grace the planet.
759;Spots of gore and some tense scenes with some very funny bits.
760;It was occasionally funny, but never rip roaring hilarious like many said it was.
761;I love this movie so much that I saw it twice in theatres.
762;You will love this film if you enjoy Zombie Movies, British Humor, Video Games, Violence/Gore, and quirky, odd films.
763;It's more like a comedy take on the film set during the same time as Romero's Dead series but set in England.
764;Except this one is funny.
765;some people are flabbergasted that this movie got good reviews.
766;You will LOVE this movie if you love all the things I mentioned earlier.
767;well then, I'd be pretty surprised.
768;The extras add quite a bit to the movie.
769;A wonderful comedy, its not very scary, but thats not the point of this movie is it?
770;Brilliance, laughs, pubs, and lurching Zombies .
771;If you love zombie movies, you will be totally locked into this.
772;It dissects the tropes, has fun with them, and also manages some goods scares, gore and heart along the way.
773;A great film with a definitive style.
774;SImon pegg is one of the best comedy actors of this generation.
775;Nick Frost is also very good.
776;It pays great homage and respect to the classic Zombie film(s) of Romero, down to the socio.
777;culture symbolism, and puts a fresh twist on things by succeeding as a dark comedy.
778;The British makers of this film know their Zombie lore and manage to tie.
779;in logic, emotional empathy and relatability, that's believeable and endearing, often as a result of the light.
780;hearted comedy and likeable protaganists.
781;and of course the subtle but quite effective behavioral parallels that humans are living zombies in many ways, is perfect and blends right in with the dark humor and tone of the entire film.
782;natured comedy, clever writing, and memorable acting.
783;Because of these reasons, this is certainly in my own top 10 favorite movies of all time.
784;Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are a hoot.
785;Together they work so well off each other one might think Laurel and Hardy, Martin and Lewis or Abbott and Costello.
786;the writing is top knotch, the acting is goofy as hell, and it makes for a great, funny, movie.
787;Satire seems to be one of Pegg's greatest attributes.
788;I do not usually watch horror movies, and this movie is perfect for people like me.
789;Though it is definitely R in the language used and the scary/gorey scenes, there is enough hilarity to carry people like me through.
790;It is, to me, more genuinely scary than Scary Movie, and it is also more genuinely funny than Scary Movie.
791;I have given Shaun of the Dead to two people as gifts, and recommend it as a movie that does not pretend to be anything more than what it is.
792;When the zombie apocalypse arrives, a hero will rise.
793;hard skeptic must recognize SHAUN OF THE DEAD for the wildly entertaining jolt of British cinema that it is.
794;SHAUN OF THE DEAD was brilliant and refreshing enough that it massively raised the profiles of several of the participants, namely Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and their constant director Edgar Wright.
795;at its heart SHAUN OF THE DEAD is a romantic comedy.
796;it's a smart, gleeful, and absolutely inspired send.
797;up of zombie horror, and at the end of the day I was surprised by how much heart it had.
798;Director Edgar Wright masterfully marries the gory, ghoulish scares with the clever and genuinely funny bits.
799;This is one of those times in which the kinetic quick edits amplify the tension.
800;There are frequent legitimately spooky moments that'll make you jump.
801;Still, it's the goofy sequences that plant themselves in your memory, whether it's the record.
802;There are heaps of amusing foreshadowing.
803;SHAUN OF THE DEAD is simply so well made, so well structured and terrifically paced.
804;Pegg and Frost are perfection, with Pegg readily building on his lead actor creds.
805;There is surprising weight and credibility to Simon Pegg.
806;A faux interview with Coldplay as the band promotes Zombaid, with walk.
807;Great movie that is why I bought.
808;If you like zombie movies, you will love this one!
809;It is zombies and humor rolled into one great movie!
810;It is one of those pitch.
811;I was especially impressed by how the rising threat evolves from something that can't be distinguished from the ordinary to the all out bloodbath and back again.
812;Very intelligent and very funny, with a little heartfelt drama thrown in as a kind of garnish.
813;I highly recommend this movie, as long as you aren't too squeamish.
814;These 2 guys, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are amazing together.
815;I enjoy anything they are in.
816;I really love this movie as well.
817;It was great from start to finish.
818;ray so the trilogy will be complete.
819;SIMON PEG is so perfect in this movie.
820;He is so very funny.
821;for those who really liked this movie, I will recommend DEAD ALIVE.
822;It's a comedy/zombie movie (this one has MAJOR gore and blood, but is hilarious).
823;Having said that, sit back and enjoy a good giggle.
824;The obvious humor entangled with this appocolyptic story is fun and engaging.
825;Even the zombies themselves have compelling moments.
826;This movie has it all!
827;Clever dialogue, cool plot, lots of humor, touching emotional scenes, romance, and of course.
828;p. s.: You've got red on you!
829;One of the best zombie satires of this decade, definitely one of their best movies.
830;This is one of the most entertaining and refreshing movies I have seen in some time.
831;As a big fan of zombie/the living dead horror films I loved how this movie played on the zombie theme while being able to mix perfectly timed and smart humor.
832;The writing is crisp and it is soooooooo nice to see a really well made horror film these days.
833;I think this is by far the best horror/comedy film in some time.
834;The best thing about the film is the fact that is stays true to the Zombie genre while treating Romero type fans with the respect they deserve, this movie compliments all its predecessors.
835;Yes It WasThere was so much about this movie that I enjoyed
836;And to be honest, the only other zombie thing that i've ever enjoyed is Warm Bodies and that's pretty much it (The Last Of Us doesn't count considering the fact that those are not zombies, but zombie.
837;I've seen this movie many times and I have to say it is very funny.
838;It is really hilarious how oblivious Shawn is in the beginning of the movie to all the zombies around him.
839;This is an absolutely hilarious (in the British sense of the word) zombie movie!
840;Simon Pegg plays Shaun to perfection and the supporting cast is fantastic (including the ever.
841;even one of his flatmates, but when it finally sinks in, it makes for lots of fun.
842;This movie is a breathe of fresh air.
843;Sure it has violence and blood but it also has some of the funniest lines ever.
844;I love the opening credits when it shows us how in some way we are all zombie like.
845;The writers added the right amount of comedy along with zombie movie etiquette to make one of the finest zombie movies to come along in quite a while.
846;i love the record throwing part.
847;It is wry British humor and that is something to keep in mind.
848;My friends and I quote it regularly!
849;Very funny British humor and the characters really made the movie.
850;The film itself gets five stars from me, just so that is said.
851;I agree with the reviewers this is a love movie with horror parts in the form of zombies.
852;The main actor is a very good comedical actor but I didn't care for hot fuzz that much I perfer this one Shawn of the Dead.
853;so if you need a good comedical movie to waste time with bits of horror scenes then this is the movie for you to sit back and enjoy time and time again.
854;Shaun of the Dead is a interesting twist in the zombie movie genre.
855;This is a buddy film, with a romantic twist.
856;overall, the movie moves a little slowly at points, but there is a good bit of dry humor and, again, Shaun is a protagonist that I ended up liking more than I disliked.
857;Cult classic that fits perfectly in with the 2 other in the Cornetto trilogy.
858;Shaun of the Dead is EASILY one of my top five favorite comedies.
859;If you like Simon Pegg, British humor, Spaced (Simon's previous tv series), and the associated ensemble of actors, you'll love Shaun of the Dead.
860;The director has a unique plot style, camera cut.
861;This was a really good movie but extremely dark and alarming sometimes.
862;The Hot Fuzz was my favorite of the group.
863;This was a good so if you enjoy Hot Fuzz you will definitely enjoy this.
864;The BEST movie I have seen yet.
865;It is funny,scary,and it has drama and everything you would want in a movie.
866;Shaun of the Dead is influenced by many films, comedy and horror.
867;But it is a movie that is highly entertaining, with some genuine belly laughs and a few genuine sad, somber moments.
868;Mr. Romero liked it so well, it has inspired him to make a new sequel, a fourth film to his .
869;this quirky movie, Shaun of the Dead, was filmed in London, England.
870;I won't say anything about the plot, but this zombie film with an English touch is fun to watch.
871;easter Egg: After you have seen the film, you can watch it again with a new feature.
872;There is a lot of gore in it to make it a slasher/horror movie, but it's so funny I would rather put in the comedy group.
873;either way this movie is FUNNY!
874;AWESOME!This movie from start to finish is a riot!!
875;And for that it deserves to be considered one of the best comedies to come along in a long time.
876;It's a comedy too, sweet.
877;Some may think it's cheater, but I enjoyed it, and will watch it more just to see if I can pick out more instances.
878;The jokes were dead on, they made fun of every aspect of a typical zombie movie, and they did it so well.
879;hey, if George Romero said it was good, it has to be, right?
880;My teenage boys love it.
881;Action in some many funny ways, funny comedy and romance!
882;the story made sense and the characters were really great together.
883;I received it in just a couple of days and it was in perfect condition.
884;Just a barrel of laughs, and those cricket bats are really handy!
885;Absolutely one of the fumiest movies I've ever seen.
886;Nick Frost is the best parring with Simon Peg!!!
887;Great buddy flick!Great classic Zombie movie!Great comedy!!!
888;Shaun of the Dead is one of the most unique horror films I've ever had the privilege of watching.
889;You might even find yourself shedding a tear or two in this over.
890;This is a film that can be enjoyed by just about everyone.
891;The dialog and acting are brilliant as are the make.
892;The violence and gore is satisfying without being too over.
893;For more, please check out [.]
894;Good humor, movie changes from the typical romantic comedy to a goofy, gore fest.
895;Well worth the watch, that's for sure.
896;and all around great movie.
897;Never laughed as hard as I did when i watched this movie!
898;Ok first let me say I love Zombie/horror/gore movies, I just freaking love them.
899;so when I heard they where making a comedy about zombie movies I was like this is going to be great, and then the reviews started coming in and it sounded really good, the hype was high.
900;It was free and i was able to bring a guest, so i figured i would check it out.
901;It was probably one of the best decisions i've made this year.
902;I highly reccomend this flick to anyone who needs a good laugh.
903;I absolutely love this movie!
904;I'm a huge fan of this film.
905;i've seen it numerous times, and I'm sure i'll see it plenty more.
906;It's a really fun film with a unique twist on zombies.
907;It isn't just a survival of a horde massacre, it's genuinely hilarious and well put together.
908;The actors mesh very well together, and fill their roles excelently.
909;Before picking up or watching this film, make sure you don't mind a bit of crafty, quirky british humor.
910;In a way the movie mirrors our world and the way people adapt to their environments.
911;there are scenes that get very intense but the film makers also follow the intensity up with great comedy.
912;Shaun of the Dead is hands down the funniest movie of the year.
913;I laughed out loud multiple times.
914;If you are a fan of comedy and are not too squeamish about gore (after all it is a zombie movie) this movie will be quite a treat for you I know I look forward to seeing it again!
915;This is a fantastic small movie.
916;Well written and superbly cast.
917;budget look to it, which actually suits it perfectly.
918;This is popcorn entertainment at its finest.
919;Simon Pegg has a great performance as the deadbeat, laidback Shaun who suddenly has to become semi.
920;So, I knew that it was a comedy .
921;anyway, I really enjoyed this movie .
922;I found the relationships between the characters to be convincing, and likeable, and the characters themselves to be well portrayed.
923;the humor is pretty fast.
924;I have always loved this movie and was excited to watch it again.
925;Plus its a great watch for the kids while on long trips.
926;end life the viewer observes hints here and there of the coming apocalypse.
927;The best bits are pieced together in the trailer.
928;Those movie's were in great humor, and much of the time was hilarious.
929;THis movie was humurous, and great for a date friday.
930;It is lively and homewelcome.
931;I got the feeling that the target audience was English as well, I found it apalling how shaun cried for his mummy near the end.
932;Keep this movie in mind, and in eight years, give it another try.
933;This is a classic zombie humor film.
934;I love this movie and am so happy to have it in my collect!
935;it was funny,and a little sad but mostly funny.
936;the characters are great,i could never say enough good things about this movie.
937;Seen this movie too many times to count and it still makes me laugh.
938;I finally got a chance to see this movie, and I LOVED it!!
939;It is so funny and gross at the same time.
940;So when you hear the term funny associated with zombie you think, Oh, it's a spoof.
941;growing army of reanimated flesh.
942;The casting was well put together and you will absolutely love Shaun and his pal Ed.
943;there is much to admire about this film.
944;I will say towards the ending it does gets a bit clich d and over serious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments.
945;One funny detail is that since in the U. k., guns are pretty much nonexistent.
946;zombie films are some of my favorite horror movies and I am grateful that they have made a comeback in recent years.
947;Still the same movie in blue ray as in original format.
948;One heck of a funny movie!
949;It was in very good shape.
950;I look forward to do more business.
951;This is one of those movies like Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, Kubrick's Shining, and Fargo that just get better and better!
952;Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have become two of my favorite actors and do such an amazing job in anything they do together!
953;This movie is very funny!
954;I love seeing other familiar faces pop up here and there (Bill Nighy for example) and the movie has plenty of action/bad.
955;This movie will definitely not disappoint!
956;It was written and directed very well and the actors bring it all together with the chemistry between all of them.
957;I would highly recommend this movie to anybody, because it has something for everybody.
958;I have a few other movies with Simon Pegg and friends and there all very good .
959;this is exactly how i want the world to end.
960;it's funny and filled with irony and zombies .
961;sure they're out to kill you and eat your brains but you're sure to have fun in the mean time.
962;thank you so much for this film.
963;This is one of my favorite movies.
964;I love the comedy mixed with zombie.
965;I have watched this film several times and now and just love the humour.
966;The dynamic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost can often at times be annoying, but when they are on they are really funny, and in this movie they're really funny.
967;this is a movie that can be at times really funny and clever, and because it's a movie starring Simon Pegg it can at times be extremely annoying.
968;This is a movie that despite Simon Pegg and Nick Frost holds itself together, and it's an entertaining watch.
969;It was sweet, deep, funny.
970;A Zombie movie with heart.
971;A must see it movie.
972;This is a wonderful movie from the first laugh to the last laugh.
973;This movie has to be the best comedy of the year.
974;This is considered to be the best movie I have ever seen!!
975;There were several funny lines and situations.
976;It's hard to find a movie you'll have more fun watching this year over Shaun of the Dead.
977;It's stylish with great one.
978;liners and good comic acting.
979;It does manage to even be scary at times.
980;It makes fun of other zombie movies while being one itself.
981;It does have times when it takes itself serious and where it can even be touching as well.
982;It makes for a good movie to watch with buddies and some beers.
983;I thought this movie was extremely funny and a great tribute to the original Romero undead movies.
984;I especially liked that the premise was not copied from Romero's films (with the exception of the resurrection of the dead.)
985;I liked the what happened when.
986;This is a great movie to have a scary laugh.
987;I love this movie and recommend it to all my firends!!!!
988;Edgar Wright is one of my favorite filmmakers, so I'm a bit biased, but this movie is amazing.
989;It's smart, funny and full of love for the zombie genre.
990;There is a distinct difference.
991;This is it's own story that's meant to show love to the genre.
992;If you love zombie movies, comedies or just anything good, you need to own this!
993;Yes, I laughed couple of times, and felt disgusted another couple of times.
994;i could recommend dozens of comedies which are funnier and dozen of better thrillers to keep you on the edge of your seat.
995;Takes a while to build, so be patient.
996;Overall, a good movie when you're in the mood for something easy.
997;A quirky black comedy, but very British.
998;what is perhaps most engaging about this film is that while it is a parody, with numerous flat out hilarious moments, it is also offers up some genuine thrills, a bit of romance and a surprisingly realistic portrayal of the strains and emotion of an end of the world type scenario.
999;While Shaun of the Dead is first and foremost a comedy, it offers some surprisingly poignant moments, including Shaun's reconciliation with his badly mauled stepfather.
1000;Of course, it offers the best fight sequence set to Queen since Highlander
1001;what lends to the comedy, and also to the interesting dynamic, is that the cast is made up exclusively of normal people.
1002;the most interesting aspect of these relationships is that between Shaun and his recently ex.
1003;The directors insert their give and take in to the flow of the action perfectly
1004;A such, it has more in common with old time Hollywood romances that it does with the over the top grope.
1005;offering laugh out loud moments, a few nice chills and some really interesting social commentary, Shaun of the Dead was a surprisingly complex movie.
1006;Those who enjoyed Max Brooks' book The Zombie Survival Guide will particularly appreciate the film as much of the comedy is the subtle, tongue in cheek satire the British do so well.
1007;That said, don't rule Shaun of the Dead out just because you're not a fan of the genre
1008;They hit the nail right on the head!!!
1009;Funny the Brits alive complection is the same color!!!??
1010;This is a very good movie for the young'ns!!!
1011;And remember, you have to shoot them in the head!!!!
1012;Yeah thats right it is amazing.
1013;I've seen this movie a few times and it always entertains me.
1014;Plus Simon Pegg is usually going to bring it.
1015;Granted a really good one is fewand far between but Shaun of the Dead to me screams at least golden globe noms for best actor and best picture in comedy.
1016;Well I can truly say that Shaun of the Dead is the real deal when it comes to a solid comedy, and also a solid horror flick to boot.
1017;Shaun combines verbal wit, with physical comedy, and also satire.
1018;For me, the funniest running gag is how the characters shirk to call zombies, well.
1019;It's funny because when you look back at every great zombie movie they never call them zombies.
1020;tep The difference between this and a spoof if that a horror/comedy actually has potent moments of horror which have the power to jolt the audience.
1021;The standard issue horror jolts are perfectly placed and imaginative.
1022;not to mention since this takes place in Britan and the posession of firearms is looked down upon over there, it's thoroughly enjoyable to see how our heroes cope, starting by throwing small items, then onto a brilliantly hysterical sequence where they're bickering over which records to launch and the intruding zombies.
1023;Another success of Shaun of the Dead is it's characters.
1024;All the characters, including the ones you're supposed to hate are appealing and extremely well written.
1025;but that's why we love him.
1026;And in the finale of the film you fnd yourself deeply affected by the bond between Shaun and Ed.
1027;The love interest, Liz, gamely played by Kate Ashfield Makes for a fantastic horror heroine, and makes it easy for us to understand why Shaun is so wounded when Liz dumps him in the beginning.
1028;She also lends a lot to Shaun's development through the course of the film, while at the same time sustaining her memorability.
1029;It takes skilled talent to properly balance those elements, through the brilliance of Simon Pegg, and Edgar Wright's Writing, the balance is achieved effortlessly.
1030;So here's to the best horror movie, and the best comedy of 2004!!!
1031;so being the fun loving drinker that he is he arms himself with a cricket bat and decides that the safest place to be is at The Winchester Pub.
1032;This is a must watch for all movie lovers.
1033;definitely the best Horror/Comedy out there and also one of my favorite Zombie movies.
1034;to be honest i bought another movie at blockbuster on a late night trip to return movies and when i got home i found that they had put this movie in the case instead of the one i bought.
1035;this is a very funny horror spoof and it had me laughing so hard that i had to stop it twice and review parts again because i would miss things!
1036;the makers of this movie really outdid themselves with this.
1037;the next day in one of the funniest walks ever shaun walks to the store and back never noticeing the zombies or dead in the streets.
1038;this is just a fun movie and if you can get into the story i think you'll have a great time with this one(yes it is very gory also)!!!
1039;The gory story is grounded by a good natured sense of humor and a real desire to make a horror film that goes against the grain.
1040;Splatter fans will appreciate the rip and shred effects, but at the heart of the film is a love story.
1041;pegg is the perfect anti.
1042;offs are so rich in black humor that we find ourselves engaged in the film's excesses rather than turning away.
1043;what elevates the film is its sense of purpose.
1044;Most horror films attempt to break the ice with nervous laughter, but Shaun of the Dead celebrates its silliness.
1045;The situations and jokes are universal, especially when the character's survival skills kick in.
1046;Shaun and Ed may not be great warriors, but they're great entertainment.
1047;writer Pegg take their cue from the works of Dario Argento and George Romero, and even Danny Boyle's recent 28 Days Later.
1048;The references should delight fans of zombie films, who will immediately recognize the homages.
1049;The performances are perfectly suited to the misfit nature of the story, with Pegg and Frost the biggest misfits in the bunch.
1050;What also works for this movie is social satire with dark humor, gore abound, some Goblin music from the original Dawn of the Dead and the scene where Shaun is struggling with a zombie then the fat slob roommate takes a picture of them was hilarious.
1051;This movie is my favorite movie of any kind.
1052;Not just the genre, but the absolute classic riot that this is.
1053;It really has to go down as the greatest zombie movie and perhaps the greatest comedy of all time.
1054;The characters are likeable, they have the right amount of swearing, you see people die.
1055;the only thing this movie lacks of s(e)x, but it really makes up for it with their innuendos.
1056;Thea\se guys did a great job with a great story and little money.
1057;The movie was funny, and had all the expected zombie antics.
1058;It is my favorite zombie movie and I can't wait for a third movie with the two from Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz!
1059;First with 28 Days Later, a film that put a new spin on the zombie genre, and now with Shaun of the Dead, a hilarious romantic zombie comedy, or rom.
1060;Shaun of the Dead is about, well, Shaun (Pegg), a man who is at a crossroads in his life.
1061;end job, he lives with his slob of a best friend, Ed (Frost), and he was just dumped by his girlfriend of three years, Liz (Ashfield).
1062;The references to classic horror films and filmmakers just flow and flow constantly, as the film gives a nod to everything from Romero's Dead series (obviously) to The Evil Dead to Lucio Fulci.
1063;The way the film approaches the zombie invasion is extremely clever and well.
1064;handled, featuring several brilliant sequences, one of which shows Shaun routinely walking the streets of London on a perfectly average morning and then walking them again on the morning of the undead, or, dare I say it, the dawn of the dead (insert eye.
1065;The acting is excellent, especially from Simon Pegg, who delivers gags with perfect comic timing, pulls off heated confrontations expertly, and even nails the film's demanding emotional scenes (yes, there are demanding emotional scenes).
1066;Also, the ending, though something of a deus ex machina, is still extremely inventive and is most certainly a crowd pleaser.
1067;Deep down they are a combination of many classical well known/loved genres, and most of all SHOWCASE/celebrate the complexities and empathy of human relationships and it's polar dynamics (eg.
1068;Really this film is a fantastic and rare mix of comedy, horror and drama that had me laughing out aloud consistently and almost making some in the audience cry.
1069;Overall this a surprise hit (I wasn't expecting much from it) containing fantastic special effects (conversely almost beats Hollywood, considering this film's low budget).
1070;More importantly I pose the question.
1071;is this film better than the other loved and acclaimed British director's (Danny Boyle) films 28 Days Later and Trainspotting?
1072;An actually funny zombie movie!
1073;sketched characters (the brave guy, the smart.
1074;ass guy, the cynical guy, the cowardly guy, etc.) like a lot of horror movies, this one delivers a nice little group of nicely.
1075;A nice sharp picture, great sound, and generous extras round out this must.
1076;if you don't like British humor, you may find it a bit dry, but I loved it.
1077;Just a word of advice to Rogue Pictures, the company that is releasing this amazing romantic comedy with Zombies.
1078;A Smash Hit Comedy with Zombies?!?!?!?
1079;whats that it should be A Romantic Comedy with Zombies!
1080;and the film wasn't even really a smash hit here in the U. s. it was a success overseas in England.
1081;They love cinema classics like Scary Movie 3, or Exorcist: The Beginning!!!
1082;Excellent movie by the way.
1083;Great performances by Bill Nighy, Simon Pegg and Kate Ashfield, but hands down Nick Frost steals the show.
1084;If you like this movie you will love the British sitcom Spaced also written by Simon Pegg!!
1085;If you are a fan of The Newsroom, The Office or John Cleese's Clockwise, then you are the sort of person who should enjoy the dry British humor of this film gem.
1086;i found the cast to be strong and well chosen.
1087;The humor was good (if you like the dry style) and I particularly liked they way the coming menace was hinted at in the beginning.
1088;This is a great movie, I love it!
1089;I hope they make more!
1090;For me, the really shocking part about this movie was the thought that people I knew thought this movie was good.
1091;Finally, I'll bet that the screenwriter came up with the idea of this movie after he heard his friend Shaun being refered to as Shaun of the dead.
1092;This is the next in a proud tradition.
1093;There is much to admire about the film.
1094;First off, it brings a very British sense of humor to the characters.
1095;It's a bit like seeing the cast of The Office in a horror movie.
1096;At least in Shaun of the Dead, the zombies still move slowly.
1097;I loved this movie: a little bit of gore, a little bit of heartbreak.
1098;they do their best to survive.
1099;the local zombies are great.
1100;they all did a really great job!
1101;this is an extremely fun movie, and I highly recommend it.
1102;, it is a wonderful comedy, the plot is interesting
1103;If you have never seen a zombie movie (maybe because you are too young or you have living in a bunker for the past 30 years), then this is a good starting point.
1104;This movie was for my son, he and his friends love it.
1105;A comedic twist on a zombie movie.
1106;A love, buddy, and social cometary story set in a zombie holocaust?
1107;This movie works on so many levels.
1108;When I heard about this movie coming out, I was interested, cause it looked like it added a humorous twist to one.
1109;I wasn't sure that could actually be pulled off, but when I finally saw this movie, I was definitely impressed.
1110;I loved it so much, when Hot Fuzz came out, I had to see that too.
1111;I ended up loving that movie as well!!
1112;I was fooled by the trailer into thinking this was a good comedy movie.
1113;I'm a huge fan of zombies, a huge fan of horror.
1114;Now, I wish I had been able to see this one on the big screen because it was so great!
1115;This movie has a little bit of everything: comedy, horror, drama, action, suspense, musical, and originiality.
1116;Terrific tongue and cheek humor, and the soundtrack is awesome!
1117;A real winner and I recommend it to everyone I know, even the ones that don't like scary movies.
1118;Simon Pegg, who plays Shaun, and Edgar Wright, the director, wrote and created a very creative take on zombies that is overflowing with black comedy.
1119;Besides the zombies, there is not much horror, but you will be entertained by the modern take.
1120;er well it is the funniest film i've seen in years.
1121;the storyline is obvious its about zombies ok easy, its the way they deal with them thats funny, there are some fantastic visual and physical comedy as well as some verbal gems.
1122;the characters are really well written, but the one who steals the show is Ed, he is without a doubt the biggest pratt, but you want him as your best mate.
1123;the more i watch this film the funnier it gets.
1124;always a good funny movie for viewing any time of the year just watch and you will see for yourself and enjoy
1125;When I first saw the film, I laughed out loud several times and chuckled at other places.
1126;In order to truly get this film you have to view it multiple times.
1127;I watched this movie three days in a row and every time i watched it I picked up new tidbits which made the film even more hilarious then the last.
1128;This film is laced with details and jokes that are truly genius.
1129;Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright did a masterful job with the script and each character is wonderfully cast.
1130;Although this is a comedy for the most part, the story is really tight and gets serious.
1131;Overall, a great flick that great to watch with some of your friends.
1132;This was a crazy, funny movie.
1133;I loved the subtle humor and the gory zombie scenes made for an edge.
1134;The movie was cleverly written and enjoyable.
1135;Zombie horror, comedy at it's best.
1136;Top on my Halloween viewing list right next to Young Frankenstein.
1137;This movie has all the elements I love .
1138;great acting, comic energy, a modicum of gruesomeness and slow moving zombies.
1139;Incredibly funny and a new way to look at the Zombie apocalypse.
1140;Watching this will allow you to look at such experience with humor.
1141;Another fantastically funny movie with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost!
1142;What Fun zombies can be when they are met with this cast of characters!!
1143;I thought the movie was hilarious but it might take a few watches before you can really get into it.
1144;Scary, gross and funny all in one!
1145;In addition to the amazing movie, the specials are GREAT!
1146;If you love the movie, I highly recommend watching all the specials.
1147;It's a great movie for those who like British humor and Zombies.
1148;If you are a Simon Pegg fan you will enjoy as well.
1149;This is by far one of my favorite zombie movies.
1150;It has awesome British humor, which in my opinion is perfect for the zombie genre.
1151;With a brilliant script and an all.
1152;star cast this is destined to become a cult classic.
1153;aUDIO 4 of 5Great soundtrack and a very decent surround sound setup.
1154;If you're a fan of zombie flicks, and enjoy laughing.
1155;This movie is seriously right up your alley.
1156;This movie is really, really good!
1157;The direction is the greatest aspect of it, but the acting and the script were also superb.
1158;This and Hot Fuzz are some of favorite comedy films.
1159;Just one of my favorite flicks.
1160;He and his cheeky fellows are hilarious.
1161;This has become a cult classic in my personal a opinion.
1162;Sean of the dead is a wonderfully hard to find movie, which I found with ease and got exactly what I was looking for
1163;Shaun Of The Dead is definitley one of the best zombie films of all time.
1164;I can see why George A. Romero loves this film, because it's full of laughs, gore and great characters.
1165;shaun Of The Dead is a must.
1166;see for anyone who wants to have a good laugh and a good scare.
1167;Definitley one the best films last year and it's sure to be a classic.
1168;This is one of the best movies ever made!
1169;It's a parody of Dawn of the Dead, with addition of its own elements and great intelligent humor.
1170;Of the entire movie one part hand me laughing to tears.
1171;Simultaneously as London is stricken by an outbreak of zombies, Shaun gets drunk, works on his hangover, and goes to the local convenient store for a soda.
1172;Shaun's first contact with the zombies is hilarious as they assume that the person is excessively drunk as the zombie is moaning and stumbling towards them.
1173;The humor is very real as many know and recognize Shaun and Ed in people they know, or in themselves.
1174;The love story between Liz and Shaun is also an element that brings further amusement to the audience as it is something to which the audience can relate.
1175;It is this connection with the audience that enhances the cinematic experience of the film.
1176;Ultimately, the comedy and horror bring together a light cinematic event, which should be enjoyed as it offers something for everyone.
1177;Some of it is very subtle.
1178;And the whole movie is peppered with subtle jokes, along with the more obvious ones.
1179;I prefer this type of intelligent humuor over some of the other stuff.
1180;and there is more than just humour.
1181;This movie is witty and devious.
1182;It is a typical zombie movie with blood and guts but mostly it is a satire on modern life.
1183;I like this movie because it's a fresh take on a buddy.
1184;One of my favorite movies ever.
1185;I love how the drunks and the zombies are so similar in the beginning.
1186;Worth watching more than once because there are a lot of funny things that happen that you don't really catch on to until re.
1187;I loved this show when it first came out, and now I'm sharing it with my stepson.
1188;I see people all the time so immersed in their phones that they never look up, so you can imagine what they would think if they looked up to confront a zombie!
1189;It WAS extremely funny and well done, it has become one of my horror/comedy favs.
1190;And it has Queen music in it, too.
1191;It is extremely funny and keeps the humor throughout the entire movie.
1192;Even when the movie takes a dramatic turn, it always is brought back to center with a great laugh.
1193;If you like a good comedy, this movie is for you.
1194;the entire cast is terrific and Simon Pegg is perfect as the lovable but quite imperfect Shaun.
1195;The disc comes with a lot of nice extras, including two commentaries.
1196;I just want to say that i love this movie.
1197;Any zombie genre fan will LOVE this film!
1198;I love Zombie movies and this is one of those at the top of my list.
1199;Hands down, the funniest zombie movie I've ever seen, with lots of nods to zombie classics, ample gore, fantastic pacing, and a great story line.
1200;this movie is played for laughs .
1201;It is a clever take off of Zombie horror movies that nevertheless does have its moments of genuine horror.
1202;If you are fan of horror movies or camp B movies then you should watch this modern take on the genre.
1203;It doesn't strike me as a typical British movie, but it is still one I enjoyed.
1204;This was a funny movie and good parody and I'm glad I have it in my collection.
1205;Every once in awhile I'll pull it out and watch it and have a good laugh.
1206;Great acting, funny plot, and well, those zombies to 'die for'.
1207;We still laugh watching the troupe pretend to be zombies to 'blend in'.
1208;And the end of the movie kicker is great fun!!!
1209;For one, it was only moderately funny.
1210;I only got a couple of laughs through the whole picture.
1211;loud kind of funny I was looking for.
1212;That was about only the real justice this movie did for any of its predecessors.
1213;And underlying the whole thing was a stagnant love story.
1214;And the movie is so funny too!
1215;The ending is the best though.
1216;If you like zombie movies, this movie is definitely for you!
1217;If you like comedies, this movie is for you!
1218;Simon Pegg and the entire British cast are outstanding.
1219;this is the perfect movie!
1220;not quite as good as Pineapple Express but still a cool movie!
1221;This is one is the best zombie ever made period.
1222;Great acting, funny moments, and the beginning of the cornetta trilogy.
1223;Satirical and funny, scary and touching, this movie has it all (including a GREAT soundtrack!)
1224;his girlfriend is dissatisfied with their relationship, because all they ever do is go to pub (the Winchester) in the evenings with their respective roommates, and they never do anything together.
1225;Once Shaun realizes what is happening, he decides what to do and sets out to do it .
1226;at any rate, I loved it and this movie earns a definite YES YOU MUST SEE IT from me!
1227;If you've never been a fan of British comedy, this movie is excellent to ease you in.
1228;humor with which you may be familiar.
1229;Shaun of the Dead is American humor with a British accent.
1230;It is also a love story that happens to involve zombies.
1231;shaun works a retail job, lives a lazy bachelor's life and thinks an idea of a good time is going to the Winchester every night.
1232;this film can be violent at times, but the humor certainly outweighs the gore.
1233;The comedy in this film is certainly memorable.
1234;She is leading a team of friends in the fight against the zombies who happen to look and dress similarly to the party that Shaun is leading.
1235;But rest assured, the zombies aren't all that scary and the brief shots of gore are few and far between so that you can turn away when necessary but still enjoy the movie.
1236;if you'd like to see any of Simon Pegg's or Nick Frost's work, or if you want to enjoy a less dry brand of British humor, then this is a great place to start.
1237;Edgar Wright is an excellent director and the way he shoots certain scenes is a joy to watch.
1238;For zombie humor with heart, consider Shaun of the Dead!
1239;I actually REALLY liked this movie.
1240;If you're a fan of the George Romero Zombie movies (I have them all), you will really enjoy this one.
1241;The British got it right!
1242;It's probably not the funniest movie ever made.
1243;This is a great movie.
1244;wall humor, endlessly quotable dialogue (Pete's 4 AM freak.
1245;out is my favorite), and subtle references to other horror films make Shaun of the Dead worth watching over and over again.
1246;There's comedy in the smallest of things, is that the definition of British humor?
1247;Because if that's so, I'm just one of the few Americans who understand it.
1248;Also if you have a good sense of humor.
1249;Shaun of the Dead was a hilarious twist to the zombie movie genre.
1250;The movie made great referances to George Romero and his start of the whole genre with 'Night of the Living Dead' when all the while cracking up the audience with the witty brittish humor director Edgar Wright brought to the film.
1251;It's definately worth checking out.
1252;To put it best, the text on the cover explains it right, It's a romantic comedy, with zombies.
1253;This movie is a classic.
1254;This is a horror movie with awesome comedy and sprinkled with touchingsentimental moments.
1255;territory, which is still the funniest film of all time (measured in number of laughs generated) but there is another dimension to the film beyond the humor.
1256;The really funny thing is that, underneath it all, it really is a romantic comedy.
1257;actually the movie that that came to mind the most, despite the references to the great zombie movies of the past (We're coming to get you, Barbara!)
1258;there are two prime moments that reflect this rather amazing tightrope walking act.
1259;The other is when we have one of those goodbye scenes usually found in war movies
1260;until the ball rips through the nets and then you smile and say Great shot!
1261;The other great bit of fun is how Shaun of the Dead plays with the genre movies.
1262;The bit you have seen in the preview about arguing over which LPs to use as weapons to fight the living dead is cute, but the comic masterpiece in this film is Shaun channel surfing.
1263;the more you know about zombie movies the more you will enjoy Shaun of the Dead, because you will be able to pick up on all the specific references.
1264;These are presented in comic book form as opposed to having actual footage, but that simply adds to their charm.
1265;This movie is one of my favorites that I've watched over and over again.
1266;But I love Simon Pegg and all his other movies.
1267;It's a great movie to have when you have mates over.
1268;Shaun of the Dead is a wonderfully funny movie.
1269;I highly recommend this film to non.
1270;These guys (Simon Pegg et al.) are hilarious!
1271;A fantastic movie that can be watched again and again.
1272;This movie is a great in your PJs movie.
1273;There's definitely some LOL moments.
1274;With voice overs from the actors and comic drawings onscreen.
1275;I see no scratches or markes and that makes me very happy.
1276;I love this movie it is funny and worth watching.
1277;I usually don't like the mixture of the two but this one had me on the edge of my seat and laughing at the same time.
1278;The movie is fun, the jokes work, and they beat a zombie to death it time to a Queen song
1279;I entirely enjoyed this spoof of the horror classics.
1280;I laughed and laughed at the antics of Shaun and his pals.
1281;Nothing is believable, but that's what makes it funny.
1282;It's so ludicrious it's hilarious!
1283;i wont go to much into detail, but basically its a zombie flick with a good plot, good characters,good acting, good social commentary, and a a GREAT sense of humor!!!
1284;This is my son's all time favorite movie.
1285;This movie takes the scary theme of zombies and makes it funny.
1286;There are so many laugh out loud moments!
1287;I love the actors and their acting abilities in this movie.
1288;They are all perfect for their roles.
1289;My son has either lost or broken/scratched several copies of this movie over the years, and it is so good and he loves watching it so much that I always end up replacing it with a new copy.
1290;I think this is my favorite movie.
1291;Pegg and Frost are a fabulous pair.
1292;This is a funny movie!
1293;My husband and I love to laugh, and this parody is great!
1294;quirky, interesting, funny, creepy, so quotable.
1295;liners from this movie over the years and now our 15 year old will know what the he** we're talking about.
1296;a perfect blend of horror and comedy and a sendoff to all zombie movies of the past.
1297;This movie is fantastic, and gets better with repeated viewings.
1298;I've been a fan of Simon Pegg for a long time, and this is probably the best movie he's ever done.
1299;I finally got a chance to see this movie, and I LOVED it!!
1300;It is so over the top funny and gross at the same time.
1301;The casting was perfect, you will absolutely love Shaun, his pal, and you will recognize his Mom as being in the other British comedy Calendar Girls.
1302;I laughed so hard I had tears running down my face, and I was thankfully, alone at the time.
1303;You will love this movie if you enjoy the dry British humor that is so prevalent.
1304;shaun's life takes an unexpected turn when people suddenly start turning into zombies, and he finds himself unexpectedly taking on the role of superhero zombie.
1305;But will they be safe even there?This is an absolutely hilarious film, with wonderful performances all round, hilarious dialogue and a gloriously surreal plot.
1306;I haven't laughed at anything so much for years.
1307;Hot Fuzz is a great movie!
1308;Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are amazing and hilarious!
1309;I've added it to my home movie library.
1310;He is good at what he does.
1311;After hearing how hilarious this movie was from several people, I finally watched it, and I just don't understand the hype about this movie.
1312;We found this after we thought Hot Fuzz was the funniest thing.
1313;So, based on the reviews, bought this and agree that it is funny!
1314;A definite cult classic for the ages.
1315;This is just a love story with zombies gettin in teh way of one man and his Tv.
1316;There is little actual gore in the film, but it is still a good show.
1317;funny and a good alround flick, 4stars
1318;I liked this British dark comedy, very appropriately undertitled Romantic comedy with zombies .
1319;This movie was shipped very fast and I love this comedy horror movie.
1320;Otherwise, you will find lots of laughs and will likely be quoting this one long after it is over.
1321;This is one of my favorite films of all time!
1322;I saw 28 Days Later and loved it.
1323;This movie is SO funny.
1324;One of the best zombie movies I have ever seen.
1325;Funny with lots of gore.
1326;:) I would recommend this movie to all my friends.
1327;I love this movie .
1328;Nice spin to the whole zombie apocalypse mood, and the music is perfect :)
1329;While that doesn't sound funny, it surely is made funny by Simon Pegg's performance as Shaun.
1330;great dialog, a new twist on a common horror theme, and a little seriousness thrown in make this a great film.
1331;catch this one when you can, it's spectacular!
1332;Consistantly funny, yet amazingly believable, take on a zombie invasion.
1333;Characters well drawn and full of subtle details that make rewatching fun.
1334;This is moving is very entertaining.
1335;Its very clever, witty,and smart film.
1336;There's a 'recipe' for integrating these two genres, and most outcomes are disasterous.
1337;up horror
1338;But, occasionally, a film will slip through that cover and hit me because of it's unique style, with such force, that I have to admit that, yes, the two genres can work off of one another.
1339;it just takes a director with great timing, actors who can deliver the lines with superb authority and a pace that draws me in as a viewer.
1340;Following a typical day in Shaun's life as a retail clerk, the audience is introduced to a cast of lively characters (well, in the beginning they are alive).
1341;With this, it was the timing that worked, the delivery of the lines and, all in all, the reactions of the actors to the environment and situation that made the scenes work.
1342;A film about the Living Dead, splashed with comedy, Dead Alive succeeded in following the 'recipe' for combining the horror and comedy genres.
1343;With Shaun of the Dead, we have seen success again.
1344;In fact, writing this review has gotten me so fired up over the film again, that I'm going to pop it in and watch it again.
1345;I have an EXCELLENT film to watch.
1346;i'm a big fan of horror movies, and comedy movies, and most things british.
1347;so i looked forward to watching this one because i heard it was pretty good and funny.
1348;This movie is one for the ages and gets funnier with every viewing.
1349;This is a classic Brit comedy and should be in everyone's library.
1350;Good fun, touching moments and terrifying gore.
1351;Gruesome, funny, disgusting, and touching all at the same time, Shaun of the Dead really delivers.
1352;My teenaged son and i watch this together on a regular basis.
1353;It's become a cult classic at our house, and we're always quoting from it when we talk.
1354;It is VERY gory, which i normally hate, but it's so funny that for me it's worth putting up with the gore.
1355;i was panting with delight at the thought.
1356;this film is just so much fun.
1357;This film is so much fun, it's a shame to miss it.
1358;I prefer to go into a film with a clean slate, knowing as little as possible about the film before I see it.
1359;I find the movie going experience more enjoyable when I have less pre.
1360;That being said, I love to read reviews and seek out trivia about movies that I have already seen.
1361;I enjoy reading other peoples thoughts and ideas about a movie and compare them to my own.
1362;since living in France I have completely been out of the entertainment loop.
1363;We don't have a TV and it is rare that we go to a new movie.
1364;Primarily that it was a funny zombie spoof.
1365;The movie does a good job of spoofing many of the conventions of the genre.
1366;There are a number of truly funny scenes that mimic many of the classic zombie cliche's.
1367;They've lifted lines right out of the classics of the genre.
1368;They're gorey, violent, bloody and often hilarious (intentional or otherwise).
1369;I have seen more than my fair share of good and awful zombie flicks.
1370;What I mean by that is that the production is made like a comedy.
1371;The story is truly frightening, the dead of came to life and are devouring the city.
1372;Though often quite funny, zombie films play the situation straight.
1373;Some of this is also, likely enough, because it is a British comedy at heart.
1374;There are a number of bits that seem to play better for the British sensibilities than my American in France heart.
1375;Because it is, often hilarious even.
1376;It's just that the tone of the film was of great comedy, and the buzz I had heard matched this.
1377;shaun of the Dead is a fine movie.
1378;It spoofs a genre of film that is dear to my heart, yet remains firmly a fan of the genre.
1379;It references so many of the classics and non classics of the genre that you'll need encyclopedic knowledge of zombies to catch them all.
1380;It is truly funny and makes a great party movie.
1381;The previews for this movie make it seem a lot funnier than it is, but it is still pretty funny, and it is a neat adventure.
1382;The Brits still need work on humor and comedic timing, but they are getting better.
1383;Not only is very funny, but also has some great scares throughout.
1384;The movie doesn't take itself seriously from the get go and that is why it works so well!
1385;In the end you don't have just a comedy making fun of zombie movies or vice versa, but you have the perfect balance of both.
1386;I love british humor, I love zombie movies, but the two don't mix well.
1387;It took us yanks to get it right with the new version of Dawn of the Dead This is a scary movie!
1388;Entertaining and also funny at times.
1389;Shaun of the Dead is hilarious.
1390;It's an honest to god zombie movie.
1391;It just so happens that it's also mind numbingly funny.
1392;All I can say is WOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
1393;I love the EVIL DEAD MOVIES and this rates right up there with them!
1394;This is, simply put, the best movie ever made.
1395;As a huge fan of zombie movies, when I saw the preview for 'Shaun of the Dead,' I knew I had to see it
1396;This movie, unlike some other horror parodies, perfectly blends humor with gore.
1397;Very funny and interesting all the way through the movie!!!
1398;I would definitely recommend this movie to the people of the world who love zombie movies who love to laugh!!!
1399;Have a great time watching this movie!!
1400;The writing is great, the English downplayed humor is great and the timing of the actors is impeccable.
1401;All of those halves add up to so much of a total movie viewing experience, it is incredible.
1402;If you enjoy snarky drunk video game playing slacker humor, this is for you.
1403;If you love great dialogue almost always with a touch of humor, and can wait for set.
1404;i repeat, this is for you.
1405;I absolutely love this film and it's main characters, there are some hard sad scenes but since they are mixed with gore, it's harder to get too depressed over them.
1406;I've seen enough 'serious' horror/zombie movies, so this one was a real treat.
1407;The cast of actors and the plot is great.
1408;There's also lots of funny bits, like when Shaun is leading his group through the backyards, and passes another group which is similar to his in personality/body types, and all say 'hi' to the other as they pass by, or the group trying to fit in with the zombies (and actually managing to do so!)
1409;I also like the camera work and action (also seen in 'Hot Fuzz'), and felt it was very creative.
1410;There's some nice and sentimental bits in here, like Shaun and his stepdad.
1411;Overall, this is a great movie to watch with friends, and the ending will have you in stitches, it's simply too funny and quirky to forget, and really fit in with the rest of the movie.
1412;4.5/5 stars for a great zombie movie!
1413;They don't make fun of zombie movies, they make fun of life, love, and death.
1414;One of the few horror movies that works as a date movie.
1415;Simon Pegg knows funny, but the entire cast gets a turn to shine through as well.
1416;I was actually quite surprised I enjoyed this movie, considering I didn't enjoy the original Dawn of the Dead one little bit.
1417;I laughed at loads of bits during the film, and bits I probably shouldn't have laughed at too!
1418;there's quite a few injokes, and other references to movies in this.
1419;and also one of the daftest scenes in the whole movie!
1420;All the names of the characters give some clue to their eventual fate: Shaun is re.
1421;born, Liz lives, Ed is dead, Dave ends up in the grave, Di dies, Barbara ends up a cadaver, Yvonne has moved on.
1422;i love the way the film portrays where Shaun lives.
1423;this is a great zombie movie, and loads better than the originals.
1424;Its actually very nice that Europe did their own zombie movie and not just America.
1425;Love the movie, love the plot, you name it.
1426;1,000 or more thumbs up.
1427;What can I say this movie is funny from beginning to end!
1428;This clever British spoof on the zombie movie features the less.
1429;brilliant Shaun and his friends, all capitalist zombies working at McJobs, faced with the prospect of battling the undead.
1430;It came packaged securely and came fast.
1431;This is a very funny spoof of Dawn of the Dead or Night of the Living Dead.
1432;Don't get me wrong it is pretty gorey and has some colorful language but it is funny.
1433;This was funny, by far one of the best zombie movies(after dawn of the dead).
1434;the zombies looked realistic,if this was'nt a spoof it will be a very scary movie.
1435;This is one of those British jewels that once in a while come from England to show how you can make very good movies with moderate budgets.
1436;SHAUN OF THE DEAD is fun, but not stupid fun: it's a very good movie.
1437;And beware of the scene where on of the heroes trapped inside the Winchester is teared apart while still alive by a mass of zombies.
1438;They're dissolute, but fun: without a care in the world.
1439;Way better than expected and way hilarious.
1440;A bloody good time and hey.
1441;SHAUN OF THE DEAD is one of those rare comedy horror movies that works and that's because it's script takes chances and goes where many movies have been afraid to go in their satirical whimsies.
1442;The movie has some marvelously hilarious scenes (i. e., Shaun and his buddy using old lp's as killer discs, fighting over which ones they should keep).
1443;It also has some intensely dramatic and poignant scenes (when Shaun tries to prevent his friend from killing his soon to be zombie mother or when his stepdad admits to Shaun that he really loved him).
1444;Starts off slow and then it flows into full on action insanity, but it's quick, fun, and despite the comedy, a bit scary at times.
1445;This movie has an unfair advantage over most movies: it's British.
1446;For some reason, the British are just a whole lot funnier than us Americans.
1447;One is definitely superior to the other.
1448;shaun of the Dead is a fine example of dead.
1449;Yes, it does have zombies in it, but it is really just another great British comedy.
1450;Sam Raimi proved that it could be a successful vehicle for launching more expensive films with Evil Dead.
1451;Zombies definitely have a lot of humor potential, as established in Evil Dead II.
1452;The shamble is one of the primary reasons that modern zombie movies have made their zombies move quickly.
1453;It's enough to make a person snap.
1454;like grind of a working man.
1455;He still lives with his two flatmates, Ed (Nick Frost), the fat, funny one and Pete (Peter Serafinowicz), the smart, successful one.
1456;a large part of the humor is how Shaun and his compatriots deal with the undead.
1457;The director, Edgar Wright, gleefully makes this point at every turn.
1458;until it's a family member.
1459;dad, introduces his girlfriend to his mom, meets an ex.
1460;this movie is deadly earnest about everything, including its humor.
1461;worthy moments of true drama.
1462;All of it is pulled off with incredible aplomb by the cast, who have to do everything from beat on zombies to act like zombies (no, really) to finally going utterly ballistic like real human beings.
1463;Shaun of the Dead is a fun, amusing take on the zombie film.
1464;There is interesting social commentary as well.
1465;But overall a fun adventure that's worth a check out for a few laughs.
1466;It makes you look twice at sleepy, limping neighbors.
1467;A rip roaring good time this movie was.
1468;These actors are funny and the comedic writing is spot on.
1469;Since I am from Europe I might enjoy this movie more than the average american but I am sure they still find it a great comedy and a lot to laugh about.
1470;The main character is just moving along in life, happy, drinking beer, playing video games, and not cleaning up his place.
1471;it is a movie about choices.
1472;he loved his girlfriend, tried to get along with his friends and, to my knowledge, didn't drown kittens.
1473;Great movie and teaches us a lesson about enjoying what we have and not trying to wish for change.
1474;I was going to Ireland, and I had heard that this would be a good and funny movie to see as a prelude to it such a vacation.
1475;And I love Irish and British humor.
1476;It is totally hilarious, but has a strange touching side to it, too.
1477;This is one of the best zombie.
1478;apocalypse films I've ever seen it, and it's surprisingly technically a comedy (although there definitely are some dramatic moments in my opinion).
1479;certainly worth watching once, but not nearly as good as I was expecting.
1480;There are laughs all over the place and it takes a good half hour for Shaun (Simon Pegg) to realize that he is surrounded by zombies.
1481;Him and a friend that he lives with cook up a plan to save his ex.
1482;Shaun believes the best place to wait it out is at the local pub.
1483;shaun of the Dead is very entertaining and is one of those movies that you'd think you would skip if it's in the movie theaters and on T. v.
1484;When you watch it, you get hooked.
1485;The comedy is great as it mocks Dawn of the Dead slightly and any other zombie movie you've watched.
1486;It's a good addition to your comedy collection.
1487;When I got to the theatre, I was surprised to find about a hundred other people waiting in line to see it.
1488;This is a comedy love story.
1489;But, I believe, that once you see it, you will see what I mean.
1490;Again, this is a great movie.
1491;These let us view into their world and see what was on their minds as they spawned such a creative plot and characters.
1492;the casting tapes were excellent as well.
1493;Watching simon's video diary made me crack up because it showed the informality in structure.
1494;it shows how much fun they really had behind the scenes.
1495;not to mention, the answers will keep you rolling with laughter.
1496;these features are just compliments to an already amazing movie.
1497;A humorous break from the Walking Dead.
1498;rather than becoming tedious and repetitive, this movie actually gets better and better each time you watch it!
1499;Minor characters turn out to be more deeply entwined with our heroes' lives than they appear at first.
1500;all in all, this is now one of my favorite movies, and one I watch from time to time just for fun.
1501;you want these guys to be your buddies, they're that likable.
1502;It is funny, has a few heartwarming moments, and is gross, just as a zombie movie should be.
1503;The movie nails the zombie satire, and has just the right amount of English humor.
1504;Any of those labels undercuts this entertaining film.
1505;Shaun of the Dead is much more sophisticated that that.
1506;It takes Shaun quite a while, and when he does, he's like any of us.
1507;And the best and worst of people is explored in a way that is often seen in zombie movies but still somehow seems fresh and interesting in this one.
1508;But it's still kind of funny, and a small sin.
1509;Its impossible not to love this movie.
1510;it has Zombies, romance, scares and even a tear or two.
1511;Its without a doubt the best movie to come out of the UK in the last five years.
1512;simon Pegg is wonderful as Shaun, the ultimate everyman with his sidekick Nick Frost as Ed.
1513;The rest of the cast are wonderful and a veritable whos who of British comedy, with Lucy Davis from the smash hit The Office and utterly fabulous Dylan Moran who is perhaps one of the greatest Irish standup comics ever.
1514;But that isnt what I got at all.
1515;There is genuine tension created with the character David, proving Dylan Morans wonderful range as a dramatic actor.
1516;The wealth of commentaries (on the uk release) is wonderful.
1517;I love commentaries and loved the group one with all the principle characters together clearly enjoying each other company and, it would seem, getting a little drunk (at least on Dylans part)I love this movie, mainly for the fact that it suprised me.
1518;It was wonderfully funny but also tugged at the heartstrings and had the odd scare here and there.
1519;I just got back from seeing this film and it was even better than I expected, and I had high hopes to begin with.
1520;Simon Pegg as Shaun is brilliant and Nick Frost as his best bud gets some great lines to go along with his loser attitude.
1521;The British humor here really works and if you want some great gore effects this film is for you.
1522;That scene towards the end when the zombies get a hold of four eyes in the pub, will bring back those gross memories of the Captain in Day of the Dead being pulled to pieces.Yuck!
1523;five years from now people will be embarrassed that they liked this movie.
1524;First time I watched it, I was enjoying it as the very funny satire that it seemed to be.
1525;For the most part, this is a genuinely affectionate homage to the zombie genre.
1526;simon Pegg is just a treat as Shaun, (the hero of the story), and his facial features, mannerisms and expressions caused more than a few discomforting muscular spasms and cramping.
1527;Nick Frost is also the perfect guy to play the slob best friend Ed.
1528;girlfriend), his Mum and her husband, along with Liz's friends, are hilarious.
1529;It provided a depth that could be enjoyed by most people.
1530;i thought it was a great movie, and was a lot of fun.
1531;this movie is first class: period.
1532;Destined to be a true cult classic!
1533;the movie features characters you really do care about (despite the fact that they are pretty much lovable losers), excellent actor chemistry, a well spent special effects budget (watch for the girl in the garden scene), some hilarious slapstick scenes (I'll never listen to Queen again without thinking of this movie), and a ton of Romeo.
1534;Be sure to watch the surprise ending!
1535;One of our fav's we love thses two guys together.
1536;This takes Zombies to a very funny level.
1537;But things take a drastic turn when Liz gives him an ultimatum.
1538;After that, they'll comfortably stay at the Winchester until all is well once again.
1539;Shaun of the Dead is one of those pleasantly surprising gems!
1540;The characters deliver great performances and good comedic timing.
1541;(One of the funnier moments is when Diane is trying to teach the others how to act like zombies so they can blend in with them.)
1542;The most fun about this movie is how cleverly it reminds us that most people sleepwalk through their lives .
1543;In just a few words, this movie has everything.
1544;It's a sweet little movie with a lot of heart and an intelligent script.
1545;This collection and package is great for any cult/comedy horror fan.
1546;For the price, it's well worth it!
1547;Best of both worlds, zombies mixed with British humor, perfect.
1548;If you watch it, you will love it, again and again.
1549;I was never a huge fan of Zombie flicks.
1550;I'm a big fan of dry British humor and Shaun Of The Dead is packed with that as well as flesh.
1551;As they say, the mark of a hero is how he reacts to adversity.
1552;Because Shaun is a hero.
1553;That's where the comedy is rooted, in the places where the audience can laugh at themselves because they really see themselves onscreen.
1554;And then there are some simply hilarious moments, such as the one outside the pub when Shaun and his roommate sing drunkenly and think they are being backed up by a fellow drinker who we know is merely a moaning zombie.
1555;the message here is a simple one and is clearly illustrated throughout the picture, most obviously in the opening sequence: What's the difference between these people who shuffle blindly through their days and the actual zombies?
1556;The movie is brilliant and funny and scary at points as well.
1557;Serves as a good comical base plan for the next zombie apocalypse.
1558;Good for the price though.
1559;Wonderful gory parody of zombie classics mixed with British humour that is sure to entertain.
1560;SHAWN OF THE DEAD is excellent dark humor !
1561;It pays excellent homage to Romero's flicks.
1562;I bought this movie before I saw it.
1563;Its the first time I've ever done that, and I loved it.
1564;it was an awesome satiric comedy with a bunch of great new young english actors.
1565;This delightful comedy not only pays tribute to the 'zombie' movie, it also takes the mickey out of them at the same time.
1566;shaun comes up with a plan to rescue his mother and friends, including his ex and leading them to safety with the hope of winning back Liz, trying to show her he can be responsible and a reliable person.
1567;This brilliantly funny and romance/zombie/comedy is everything an older horror fan could ask for.
1568;, Shaun of the Dead is a joy from beginning to end.
1569;There's plenty of quirky British humor, and plenty of gory zombie horror as well.
1570;It's singlehandedly the best zombie movie to come along in a long time, and while it's horror elements aren't original in the least, it doesn't try to be.
1571;Shaun of the Dead is what Peter Jackson's Dead Alive was over ten years ago: a hilarious and horrifying thrill ride that is an absolute instant classic.
1572;shaun of the Dead is one of my most favorite movies ever.
1573;This has to be one of the funniest and wittiest films I have seen in years though reading reviews I noticed that many people were complaining that it wasn't scary, it wasn't supposed to be, just because it had zombies in doesn't mean that is was going to be a horror movie.
1574;The point was to poke fun at zombie movies in a good natured way.
1575;ray, it's one of my favorite movies of all time and I'm not disappointed.
1576;o. meter is a really cool new feature.
1577;I don't like zombie movies and because I enjoyed Hot Fuzz I thought this movie would be funny.
1578;I enjoy this movie and I like how they make fun of the typical zombie movies.
1579;There are plenty of funny moments.
1580;So I decided to take a shot at this and I didn't realize how gorey it was gonna be but either way I laughed my ass off!
1581;A real great movie with a lot of blood and a lot of action.
1582;It is a comedy with a heart, and more importantly, a great and consistent idea of what it is spoofing, (an element missing in other spoofs, such as parts of the Scary Movie films).
1583;the movie, (whose title, an obvious spoof on George Romero's Dawn of the Dead, the secon in his zombie trilogy [soon to be a quadrilogy]), knows its influences well.
1584;zombie regulars will also find references to the Evil Dead trilogy, a subtle but hilarious poke of fun at Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, and more.
1585;With very little knowledge about the outbreak or how to kill the recently deceased who have risen again, Shaun and best friend make their way to the girl he loves and her flatmates to try and make it to the pub.
1586;The ending will surprise you, as will how much you'll become attached to certain characters.
1587;A must see if you enjoy the zombie genre, Simon Pegg or Nick Frost!
1588;For those whose funny bone it doesn't strike, the film's strength comes from its metaphors.
1589;our hero's journey from overlooked loser to courageous leader is also satisfying.
1590;He finds himself torn between the well.
1591;intended but prepubescent friend of his youth and his girlfriend's affections.
1592;spoof fans will enjoy watching the nonplussed Shaun and his best mate battle zombies.
1593;SOTD is entertaining, providing a few semi.
1594;There are a couple of interesting (not great) special effects, and the extras are entertaining to a point (they start getting old fast) but in general, the movie's no classic
1595;The hype way exceeds the flick.
1596;Then you should enjoy this flix.
1597;The best zombie movies are ones that don't take themselves seriously .
1598;Just good comedy and fun.
1599;If zombies are your bag, and you're looking for a good laugh at the same time, then this flick is for you.
1600;Shaun of the Dead one of the best British movies I've ever seen till now and I can watch it once every month.
1601;The cast may all be new faces to the American audience, but over here they have become the Monty Pythons of this generation through great shows like Spaced, The Office and Black Books.
1602;The romance part of the film is a very thin veil over what is an hilarious and very gory film.
1603;you will be rewarded with a fantastic modern British comedy (without Hugh Grant or Colin Firth!!)
1604;Finally, I think that the use of music in the film is by far the best I've ever heard.
1605;Zombie bashing to the Queen classic Don't Stop Me Now is one of the funniest things I have seen in a long time.
1606;I have become such a Walking Dead fan with all the drama and action I was not sure I wanted the spoof in the mix, but please, folks, this is a good zombie flick.
1607;This movie has the same feel and vibe as Jack Black and his roommate in School of Rock.
1608;This has an impact on each person's ability to fight the zombie hoards.
1609;His actions are ones a regular person would consider and it creates the potential for all of us to see the sometimes silly and petty actions that govern our day.
1610;I was very pleasantly surprised.
1611;It has the British humor of movie classics like The Full Monty and the real zombie gore one would expect of The Walking Dead.
1612;first off, I love zombie movies and hearing that there was this perfect parody of zombie movies but with heart and a really clever plot.
1613;please note that I was able to watch this movie for free via Amazon Instant Video.
1614;it's hard to explain why this movie works so well.
1615;A simple story of everyday normal people dealing with the fact that the dead are coming back to life and how it affects their everyday lives.
1616;Probably the funniest film I've seen in a long time that's actually made me laugh.
1617;The Bottom Line:The more you know about zombie movies the funnier you'll find this inspired homage to/spoof of them
1618;A great addition to you video library.
1619;With the ability to pause and rewind, the perfect addition to your zombie apocalypse, action fest weekend.
1620;I love English humor and this movie gets me every time so I finally added it to my collection.
1621;Highly recommend you adding it to your Zombie collection just for laughs.
1622;simon Pegg and all are great.
1623;and wow, once i popped in the movie, i was greatly surprised.
1624;soo much more detail that i never noticed from the first one.
1625;Funny and scary at the same time loved it laughed so hard great movie youll love it youll love it too
1626;I love zombie movies so I had to see this one.
1627;Many laughs and zombies are always a great mix.
1628;Love Simon Pegg and the fat man, they have made a lot of films together and this one is a great one.
1629;I am sure you will have a great time watching SHAUN
1630;As far as the movie itself goes it is one of my favorites.
1631;I liked it before Zombieland but now I love it.
1632;BUT, if you like wry, subtle humor this movie is worth a look!
1633;I didn't expect much the first time I watched, but SHAUN OF THE DEAD delivered laughs, adventure, romance and realistic characters.
1634;Does require an attention span of more than video game proportions to appreciate the subtle, recuring humor themes throughout the movie.
1635;Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Kate Ashfield are excellent throughout, as are the supporting cast.
1636;Zombies are well done, too.
1637;not great, but the commentary is worth a listen.
1638;Also, the OUTTAKES are rather good.
1639;Transcends the British/American humor gap as well.
1640;Lots of zombie action with traditional zombies.
1641;Well acted, realistic, real world characters you can relate to.
1642;Well scripted, well edited and entertaining!
1643;If you are like me, you've most likely heard over and over how hilarious this must see movie is.
1644;by all means it was a good movie, but it was no where near the standard of Hot Fuzz.
1645;a bit gory at times, but due to the context of the movie, it's expeted
1646;Kind of gross but very fun!
1647;I got this to entertain him and expected to hate it.
1648;He enjoyed it too even if it wasn't what he was expecting.
1649;I particularly loved the characters.
1650;Each was done so well.
1651;Witty dialogue and great comedic acting.
1652;Horror films, and particularly the zombie movie, are often the site of young filmmakers first chance to make a 'real' movie.
1653;Pegg and Wright love talking about movies the way great novelists love talking about books and it shows throughout Shaun.
1654;That said, the scripting is so deft that it's hard to say once and for all if this is a zombie movie with a romantic comedy glued on top, or a romantic comedy with Zombies stapled on.
1655;Part of this is because the film is as much about London as it is about scares.
1656;something Londoners is so much a part of the story that it can be enjoyed as much as a movie about a place and time (England in the dreary nineties) as about a group of characters (the standard rom.
1657;Pegg displays the most lovable sort of spastic.
1658;faced English comic delivery and Nick Frost is the most adorable galut I've seen on film in a long time.
1659;line performers are pitch perfect, credit casting or directing or both.
1660;the soundtrack is an amazing array of remixes touching on Zombie film lore, eighties electro notalgia, video game scores, and indy consciousness.
1661;It's so good, in fact, that by the end it becomes a homage to itself.
1662;The ONLY zombie movie worth watching.
1663;I've watched this 3 times already and will probably watch it again.
1664;The writing is incredibly smart.
1665;There are moments that make you laugh out loud, followed by, and sometimes mixed with scenes that are genuinely creepy and unsettling.
1666;And towards the end, there are some truly touchingly sad moments.
1667;I give immense credit to star/co.
1668;Going to the movies would be a lot more fun.
1669;This is such a good movie.
1670;I cant even believe it.
1671;When I first saw the preview I thought Wow this looks good.
1672;All the comedy is so good.
1673;The movie ultimatley ends with a very funny and satisfying ending.
1674;But Wright and Pegg, in spoofing the genre, create an homage pic.
1675;It's full of funny moments that tip their hit to Romero's 'Zed word' flicks, but it has so much original horror and humor to offer.
1676;namely, the premise is original.
1677;Wright and Pegg craft an interesting bunch of characters that are really those other guys in horror films.
1678;Shaun's plan to save everyone is interesting in its successes and failures, breaking the trend of so much recent horror.
1679;In all its comedy, you'll still care about every character in the end.
1680;In that, its successful in its own right as a horror film, as much as it is in comedy.
1681;but it's the comedy that triumphs above all.
1682;The writing is razor sharp.
1683;Listen to every piece of dialogue and you wil realize that Wright and Pegg have crafted an ingenious script that is constantly referencing itself as well as other horror movies.
1684;Key to the writing though is the pitch perfect delivery.
1685;This is something that Simon Pegg, in particular, has perfected.
1686;Yet at the same time, he is also a brilliant physical comedian, as noted in this film's famous jukebox scene.
1687;He has quite a bit of support, namely in his partner in crime Nick Frost .
1688;You're best served by watching the film.
1689;If you have time, watch it again and just listen to it to hear all the witty dialogue.
1690;Watch these guys at work .
1691;you'll realize more goes into this comedy than a simple script and a couple funny actors.
1692;Couple that withthe fact that my mom was born in London and I wasraised with a wry (or is that rye) sense of humor tothe tune of Benny Hill and Monty Python.
1693;And onlyTarantino could appreciate it as much as I.
1694;I've never laughed more during ahorror romp than this.
1695;Hilarious!SOTD is popcorn munching fun!
1696;This movie is truly hilarious, sure to entertain and delight fans of horror, comedy, and horror/comedy.
1697;The acting is exceptional, especially Simon Pegg, who plays Shaun.
1698;face jokes but more of an understated type of humor, which is especially effective in this setting.
1699;One thing this movie does very well is establish character, so that during the movie you really get to know and identify with them.
1700;The funniest moments come when Shaun goes about the mundane tasks of his life, oblivious to the horror around him (people dropping over dead, bloodstains in the shop he enters, etc.) The movie is brilliantly written, and all of the actors do a wonderful job at making the humor work.
1701;It sort of transcends a genre, which to me is a sign of a great movie.
1702;one of the most originial, intelligently written, and best acted movies I have seen lately.
1703;I received this as a Christmas present 5 years ago.
1704;This is a really good horror/comedy about a man named Shaun getting dumped by his girlfriend and the next day, all hell breaks loose.
1705;If you have read my reviews before, you'd know that I love Zombie movies!
1706;If you love zombies, comedy, gore, and action, I highly recommend SHAUN OF THE DEAD!!!
1707;Saw this for the first time in a special screening at a local theater, with my son.
1708;It's everything a good zombie movie should be .
1709;it's hilarious, snarky, a wee.
1710;bit dramatic, and it has well.
1711;it even makes for a good date movie, because of the how.
1712;A great movie all around.
1713;This is a fun movie.
1714;It evokes much laughter, and it serves as an excellent satire of the zombie.
1715;i understand that this is part of what makes it a great satire for movies like Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later
1716;But it is extremely funny, very well executed, with high drama when warranted and funny when it needs to be.
1717;This is one of my all time favorite movies and I'm introducing yet another cohort!
1718;these guys have outstanding chemestry, which isnt surprising considering their history (Spaced.
1719;its a great British TV show, yet to become Region 1) anyway, what makes this movie so amazing you ask?
1720;its a great horror movie, and its a great comedy.
1721;most movies cant walk such a fine line so well.
1722;you'll be finding new things to laugh about throughout the movie every time you see it.
1723;You get a brilliant horror comedy, one of the handful of films which effortlessly shift gears from clever genre parody to full fledged entries of the same genre.
1724;IT'S FREAKIN' HILARIOUSIf your a fan of zombies, british comedy, or great comedic timing then this is the movie for you!
1725;This is a great spoof of all of the zombie movies out there.
1726;A slick social commentary on modern society where we are all kind of zombies.
1727;A perfect parody of every zombie movie ever made.
1728;I laugh until my sides hurt every time I watch it.
1729;The intro to this movie is perfect, AT A BAR.
1730;Perfect for the horror movie fan, comedy fan, oddball romantic comedy fan and the british humor fan and eveyone else!
1731;It has all the elements of what an entertaining film should have: good direction, good acting, great sountrack and no attempt at taking itself too seriously or selling itself short.
1732;The backyard scene near the beginning is awesome, and one of the many highlights in the film.
1733;the film is influenced by the original, 'Dawn Of The Dead'.
1734;There are other subtle influences throughout the film
1735;o. meter (zombie trivia), in the special features!This film is unique!
1736;I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a funny movie on Halloween or any non.
1737;Prepare to be laugh your head off, literally.
1738;able, and just made you want to puke.
1739;I can only remember one funny bit, and it wasn't even that funny.
1740;This is my favorite movie.
1741;A great movie for all the brit comedy lovers.
1742;I hope there will be #2.
1743;It's amazing to me how much love Romero's original masterpiece Dawn of the Dead is finally getting.
1744;I found myself laughing and laughing all through this epic.
1745;A wonderful tribute movie that stands out on its own.
1746;The gritty survival, the black humor, the gory deaths.
1747;it's funny, it's got characters that you can identify with, it's funny, it's cleverly written, it's funny, it's scary, it's funny, it has surprising depth.
1748;and did I mention that it's funny?
1749;'Shaun of the Dead' does a neat trick .
1750;It can scare you, it can make you laugh, it can gross you out, and it can make you care about the people in it.
1751;In other words, Shaun is in every way an ordinary person who is thrust into an extraordinary situation when the dead begin to rise.
1752;this is where the clever parts come in.
1753;The advent of the undead (which the audience knows is coming, of course) is done with great subtlety and worked into Shaun's story well.
1754;The fact that he barely notices as the evidence of the creeping horde mounts just adds to both the scares and the laughs.
1755;the point is that zombie movies, for many like me, are something of a guilty pleasure.
1756;'Shaun of the Dead' is that rare one, though, a zombie movie so smartly.
1757;'Shaun of the Dead' is one you can take home to your girlfriend and watch together.
1758;altogether this really is a hilarious movie and very cleverly done.
1759;Shaun is truly one of the most bizarrely funny cult films I have ever seen.
1760;talk about 'teams' and what a study of human nature Shaun and his group would make.
1761;so they can see human nature in action.
1762;Shaun is a great film on both the funny and the serious levels.
1763;And it is one to be watched more than once.
1764;the best satire Zombie movie you will see, 2nd only to ZombieLand, if you liked ZombieLand, you will like this one too!let's go to the Pub!
1765;I first saw this when my son introduced it to me a few years ago and laughed myself silly.
1766;Definitely one of my two top favorite movies!
1767;If you love British humor, you'll REALLY love this one!
1768;There is social commentary and comedy based on class and silly Britishisms all mixed together.
1769;Wife thinks I'm nuts but I just love Zombie movies.
1770;It pays frequent homage to the latter film through a host of direct references as well as its general subject matter (for instance, much of the news as read by the television presenters are lifted nearly word for word from Romero's script).
1771;There differences are, however, marked.
1772;This is an important exercise for prospective viewers.
1773;key, subdued approach to the story.
1774;If the answer is Yes there is a high degree of probability that you will enjoy this one.
1775;i love British humor so I definitely fall more into the class of people apt to enjoy this.
1776;I loved the pacing and subdued reactions of the main characters.
1777;I loved, for instance, a pair of scenes that are allowed to unfold rather slowly.
1778;They were superbly executed scenes, and it is hard to imagine any American studio allowing a scene in a zombie comedy film to unfold so nicely.
1779;there are many wonderful scenes in the film, some very short and some a bit longer.
1780;I loved, for instance, the store employee who interrupted a meeting to accept a call on his cell phone.
1781;Their rehearsing their imitations of zombies was one of the best scenes in the film.
1782;Bill Nighy, who pretty much stole the show (despite being part of an ensemble cast) in LOVE ACTUALLY as the burned out rock musician, is in a number of nice moments in a regretfully small part.
1783;i really loved the great teamwork between stars Simon Pegg and David Frost.
1784;The cast as a whole is quite strong, though I did find the character of David to be just a tad too irritating.
1785;all in all, I really had a great time seeing this one and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys British humor.
1786;An awesome poke at the zombie genre, Simon Peggs first international hit and an awesome buddy coming of age film.
1787;I saw this movie with a group of friends, all of us expecting to laugh from start to finish.
1788;After the movie was over, I was glad that I brought friends in a sort of mysery loves company kind of way.
1789;Shaun of The Dead is a very very funny and silly little comedy which is probably the first zombie movie in history that isn't horror.
1790;That's already pretty much how things are with the rest of the movie and the plot is easy.
1791;I friend raved about this movie and so I decided to see it.
1792;I love zombie movies .
1793;Plus I love the pairing of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.
1794;They're always so funny together.
1795;Just got done watching this movie and I mustsay it was a real underachiever.
1796;But the humor wasmediocre to say the least.
1797;Not any of them were theslightest bit funny.
1798;That'swhat the rest of the cast was.
1799;But SOTD delivers as both a zombie flick and a comedy (a zomedy, if you will), and on many levels.
1800;esque setups hatched throughout, always coming full.
1801;On the other side, it offers a little credibility as a horror flick as well, delivering some genuinely startling moments.
1802;but Shaun Of The Dead mostly succeeds because of its characters.
1803;she'd own me, for sure LOLAnyway, Shaun Of The Dead is destined to be one of those instant cult flicks ala This Is Spinal Tap, so jump on the bandwagon early and see it ASAP.
1804;It has a great mix of comedy and zombie action.
1805;Hilarious and still makes you jump at times.
1806;This film magically combines comedy and horror.
1807;Glad Shaun made it as Scotty on Star Trek he is a versitile actor!
1808;I will say it makes me laugh and that makes me happy.
1809;The disc was obviously new in box (NIB) and the case was in perfect condition.
1810;I recommend this product and seller wholeheartedly.
1811;Right off the bat, you need to understand that this movie is funny.
1812;It is far more funny than it is scary.
1813;the jokes are great and range from the playground variety fart jokes to far more subtle and mind tweaking samples.
1814;just sit back and bask in its glow for a second.
1815;The perfect spoof on the zombie genre because it manages to make you feel scared, tense, appalled, and happy all at once.
1816;It's British humor at its best.
1817;Kudos for a great movie.
1818;Shaun of the Dead is one of the best homages to Horror films I've ever seen.
1819;Hilarious, bloody, and extremely well written
1820;This movie is so good because so many scenes are executed with dead on brilliance and near perfect comic timing.
1821;That's one thing the Brits will always have over us Yanks, they're damn funny people.
1822;what follows is a harrowing and hilarious sequence of events as Shaun is suddenly thrust into the position of leader.
1823;shaun of the Dead is an amazing film, a cult hit for the new millenia.
1824;Its uncanny blending of Horror affinity (with some quite resplendent gore) and romantic comedy is a bright, shining glimmer of hope for the Horror genre.
1825;This movie is one of my favorites.
1826;Dry British humor is always a win.
1827;I just love British humor!Simon Pegg was great, as usual.
1828;Would definitely recommend this film.
1829;So much so that we had to own it so we can watch it anytime we want.
1830;Have enjoyed this movie since years before The Walking Dead.
1831;And did I mention zombies.
1832;It works well because it just satirises the genre in detail.
1833;crafted in a way that only a few British writers can do, the symmetry, and the irony, works well, in fact extremly well in a british context, but may not translate 100% .
1834;Great Value in all respects, and a top notch B Grade film.
1835;But this was at least just as hilarious, if not more.
1836;You really have to be aware of what's going on in the background, though, which makes this a great movie to watch more than once.
1837;she's actually gnawing on the man's neck, and when they turn around, you can see his head fall off.
1838;This is just one of the many, many well.
1839;played humorous bits in it.
1840;shaun of the Dead is a fantastic movie and one of my favorite films of all time.
1841;If you love dry British humor, this is for you.
1842;i have shown this to as many people as I can and will continue to do so.
1843;The Best Comedy Zombie Movie Ever!
1844;This is just a really original idea for a dark comedy.
1845;Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are perfect together as always.
1846;i enjoyed the first half or so of the Shaun of The Dead.
1847;The humour in the film was funny.
1848;I didn't laugh out loud, but I enjoyed it.
1849;The physical comedy reminded me a bit of Chris Farley and the Three Stooges.
1850;For a romantic movie, it was good enough to keep my girlfriend glued to her seat, so it get's a 'thumbs up' in that department.
1851;And, for a zombie movie, it's the best one I've seen (and I've seen almost all of them).
1852;This movie was simply fantastic.
1853;He's still working at a computer store.
1854;One very inventive feature was the inclusion of comics that plugs so holes in the story.
1855;This movie is so much better than the remake of Dawn of the Dead.
1856;In some scenes, I laughed out loud but for the most part it was just very enjoyable.
1857;This is a really intelligently written film though the title is deceptive.
1858;Surprisingly good acting and directing, some of the composition of the shots are amazing.
1859;and there is a couple of scenes you may rewind and watch over and over!
1860;Thats a sign of a great movie if you want to view it over and over!
1861;A new cult classic for sure!
1862;Has all the elements of a great zombie movie with the humor of the Brits.
1863;Shawn and his buddy are great together, dealing with each situation in a believable manner for the clueless goofs they are.
1864;Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead is a hilarious romp through the cliches of zombie movies, slackerdom, and romantic comedies.
1865;Tossing the genres of horror and comedy into a blender and getting the mix just right, Shaun is one of those movies that earns the compliment, destined to be a cult classic.
1866;The titular Shaun (Simon Pegg) has an intriguing ambition .
1867;One of the most hilarious running gags in the movie is the amazing ability of our hero to fail to realize that London is beset by zombies!
1868;Ed and Shaun come face to face with a few zombies, and quickly learn the basic rules of fighting the undead.
1869;tag bunch of supporting characters, including Liz, a couple of friends with hidden agendas, and Shaun's beloved mom and hated step.
1870;watch for a hilarious scene as one rag.
1871;The flight to the pub and the defense of the pub give the filmmakers several great opportunities for humor and scares, and they get high marks for both.
1872;A brief epilogue is both hilarious and somewhat poignant, as one is shown the true value of a friendship that can survive even the biggest obstacles.
1873;tep on the humorous side, we've never seen more pure zombie flicks at one time on the big screen, as far as I can tell.
1874;Shaun both sends up and honors the cliches of the zombie sub.
1875;genre of horror film, and it does so in wonderful style.
1876;Both scary and hilarious .
1877;listen for the perfect example of a witty soundtrack .
1878;see for horror fans and for fans of British comedy.
1879;It's still a great movie and totally reccomend getting it .
1880;Peter Serafinowicz is also quite good as Shaun and Ed's roommate, Pete.
1881;A very appealing, albeit disheartening, comment on society contained in this film is that many people move listlessly through life, like zombies.
1882;it contains some of the funniest scenes ever, including a side.
1883;Another scene, among many, which comes to mind is one in which the crew mimic an impaled zombie with the intention of blending into the crowd of zombies to make it across the street to The Winchester.
1884;the film is absolute fun the entire way through.
1885;Brilliant writing and acting, with flawless timing.
1886;It is a perfect blend of horror and comedy, with just the right amount of gore.
1887;It is my fave film at the moment and I don't think I'll ever tire of watching it.
1888;It contains some of the funniest moments ever on film and is destined and guaranteed to be a cult classic.
1889;Ive been waiting for ever to see a comedy worth seeing, and my friends this is it.
1890;Its the funniest movie ive ever seen, throughout the whole film i actually did not stop laughing, seriously its that funny.
1891;The steelbook edition is really nice.
1892;The movie is obviously a classic, if you haven't seen it yet you are in for a treat.
1893;Horror and comedy don't always mesh well together.
1894;Well, our generation finally has its great horror comedy.
1895;Now, on the night he breaks up with his girlfriend, he'll be faced with the greatest battle of his life.
1896;this one is a laugh.
1897;the movie is perfectly cast and the plot brightly written.
1898;The balance between horror and comedy is realized in a way that is worthy of all the praise it can get.
1899;i'm so happy that this British flick was able to achieve the things it did.
1900;This movie just comes to show how great British Comedy is.
1901;Sean Pegg and Nick Frost are an amazing duo, that will have you laughing from beginning to end.
1902;My husband and I love this movie!
1903;And since the Walking Dead has brought so much popularity to Zombie themed movies, I hope he will enjoy this Christmas gift.
1904;So if your into the silly type of comedy this is definitely for you.
1905;Good movie, touching romance and our hero Shaun, is a great every man, sure he come off as a bit of a loser, but when it hits the fan he stands up to the challenge.
1906;The extra features are fun, so is the commentary again on the shaun scale 10 pints.
1907;For anyone that likes zombie.
1908;comedy movies, this one is for you.
1909;Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are two of the funniest actors ever in my opinion.
1910;But what this movie is really about is comedy.
1911;It is pretty much relentless laughs right from the beginning.
1912;It's really intelligent humor too, not that slapstick stuff.
1913;I recommend this to anyone because it's one of my favorite movies ever.
1914;English films are usually a bit uneven in my experience but this is one movie I have practically absorbed .
1915;I can pretty much recite the whole movie.
1916;and if you check out the commentary which I found fascinating, not only was it genius as far as comedy but they put meaning into just about every scene, giving homage to many other films.
1917;A great piece of cinema!
1918;I love zombie flicks, Simon Pegg is a great actor in comedies or more serious roles so, naturally, this was a good movie.
1919;and brew, its a recipe for a perfect Halloween.
1920;Great flick that would only work with British humor.
1921;The cast is very good, as well as Simon Pegg, theres Dylan Moran from Black Books, Lucy Davis from The Office and cameo roles from two others from both those series.
1922;Whilst I didn't find it laugh out loud all the time, it always kept me interested and surprisingly there are a number of quite moving moments.
1923;In both cases the films are affectionate parodies rather than straight spoofs.
1924;the film has a lovely twisted ending, and I'm pretty sure it will hold up to repeated viewings, so I'll be watching again fairly shortly!
1925;Just darn funny, is all.
1926;Great plot, lots of zombies, hilarious from beginning to end.
1927;I really like the lead dude.
1928;He is very good in everything I have seen him in.
1929;There are scary and tense moments but for the most part, it is a hilarious romp.
1930;Quirky and funny, good tense moments and lots of eaten people.
1931;Absolutely brilliant spoof of zombie movies, while at the same time being pretty scary.
1932;The best contemporary dark comedy.
1933;For a British black comedy this one is barely adequete with some good laughs and good zombie makeup.
1934;The funny part is when Shaun and Ed are in the backyard and think the zombie is a drunk woman and then start throwing records at two zombies.
1935;What really makes the movie so.
1936;That's what makes it so good.
1937;all in all tasteless good fun has never bbeen so good.
1938;This is an extremely funny and sardonic movie .
1939;people at Amazon were extending the snarky nature of this excellent film by offering it up alongside Become Jane and My Fair Lady.
1940;you can draw your own conclusions here .
1941;and it does a wonderful sendup of the genre.
1942;You really do end up laughing at most of the scenes.
1943;Some of the humor is clever and most of it is ironic.
1944;Respect the R rating for what it represents and you'll probably have a good laugh.
1945;the ending TV snippets are much funnier than they should be.
1946;this is terrific fun, a very likeable, very British comedy horror film, sharply written and extremely well acted.
1947;Penelope Wilton and Nick Frost are especially good as, respectively, Shaun's good.
1948;Think Night of the Living Dead meets Withnail and I and you'll sort of get the idea.
1949;The movie is very funny, the actors are quite lovable with a couple go great bits throughout!
1950;This is the sleeper movie of the decade and easily the best dark comedy I have seen.
1951;When you watch this movie the second time you start cracking up at the characters you see before they are zombies and the part they played.
1952;the romantic conflict was well done.
1953;to be honest, I found absolutely no humor in this film.
1954;I will be fair and give it another star, rather than a 1.
1955;Try again next time and maybe I'll laugh.
1956;the humor comes primarily from the main, live characters, who are like British sitcom characters whose lives irritatingly get interrupted by flesh.
1957;I loved how Shaun doesn't even notice them at first.
1958;so, I think if you love zombie movies, you'll love Shaun of the Dead, and if you hate zombie movies, you'll love Shaun of the Dead as it's so fun to watch.
1959;'Shaun of the Dead' is a funny spoof Zombie movie that will have you chuckling out loud at times and with a few huge belly laughs chucked in for good measure.
1960;Simon Pegg is great to watch, as is Nick Frost, and the supporting cast are pretty good as well.
1961;It's a great little film, that doesn't take itself too seriously and is good for some light hearted entertainment.
1962;I loved every minute of it.
1963;This fun flick is a spoof on zombie films in general, and like most zombie films, has some pretty well thought out social commentary embedded into it.
1964;maybe I liked this because I could relate to Shaun.
1965;i reccomend this to fans of British comedy and mainstream horror.
1966;Good acting, liked it after I understood what it was trying to do.
1967;Got to be one of the best films in the past few years.
1968;was I missing a wonderful film!
1969;It is well written and directed,has a superb cast,it made me laugh,it made me sad,then it made me laugh again.
1970;i think i watched it a few times in as many days,which is a rare thing.
1971;how many films do you watch that makes you want to watch it again and you enjoy it as much each time you watch?If you liked the Bohemian Rhapsody moment in Wayne`s World (a classic moment of modern cinema!)
1972;the funniest film in years.
1973;I wanted to like this movie more than I did, and some of that is due to age, I'm sure .
1974;It's maturity that caught up with me.
1975;The best moments here are the ones when the characters forget the sticky situations that they're in and start rehashing their old relationship issues.
1976;There's a touch of the Python is such moments that are welcome.
1977;Ok fine, Cemetery Man was also good.
1978;Shaun Of The Dead is British comedy's take on Romero, and it's actually very good.
1979;The film is quite funny with some Python.
1980;esque moments, but is also able to screetch to a halt to deliver a few scenes that might actually get you a little misty eyed(!)
1981;There's some very clever jokes, but a few Dude, Where's My Car?
1982;Granted, most people won't pick up on these either, but it shows the film maker's knowledge and respect for the film's roots.
1983;Simon Peg rocks as usual, his dry sense of humor always ensures a good laugh.
1984;This is one of my favorite movies, so I'm biased.
1985;I really love this movie.
1986;If you love British comedies and zombie movies, then this is right up your alley!
1987;I think Simon Pegg is one of the best actors around.
1988;I've seen most of his pics and they are all the best of the best.
1989;No copping out, good enough for those boobs in the audience sensibilities at work here.
1990;A likeable loser finds himself battling the undead.
1991;The frenetic comedy works quite well in the first half of the film, as we come to understand the irony that while Shaun technically is alive, he exists in a kind of living dead state due to his inability to take charge of his life.
1992;well childhood pal, Ed (Nick Frost), and his quandary over his on.
1993;hill Harry Potter lookalike (Dylan Moran), and the result is a winning combination of satire and scares, even if the second half takes itself just a little too seriously as an actual zombie movie.
1994;This release is as good as any!The movie:Shaun is a loser.
1995;And it's a love letter to the of the Dead films.
1996;The movie sounds good, but never amazing.
1997;There are plenty of grunts and growls and the rear channels are used nicely and appropriately.
1998;The release is jammed up full of extras though and all are pretty much worth watching if you enjoy that sort of thing.
1999;overall:Shaun of the Dead is a fun film.
2000;I picked this up at the library because it got an 80.
2001;some percent fresh rating at RottenTomatoes, which I thought after seeing it just again showed that critics do not view movies the same as real people.
2002;An extremely clever and witty spoof of Dawn of the Dead, this film deftly mixes comedy, romance, and zombie movie staples into a perfect package.
2003;It is, without doubt, not only one of the funniest movies to come out of Great Britain in 2004, but it is also one of the better horror films.
2004;see for fans of well.
2005;done comedies and zombie movies alike
2006;Great movie for a rainy day.
2007;It is rated R due to language.
2008;It does a lot of things right: the pacing, camera work, and of course the gore.
2009;Better than Hot Fuzz in my opinion.
2010;Anyone who appreciates British humor should love this movie.
2011;The gory parts are done so well, gross enough for me (the more guts, the better) but are also hilarious so that they do not bother the faint of heart too much (like my sister, who avoids bloody horror movies).
2012;I am glad that I bought this for myself, I'll watch it again and again.
2013;Hot Fuzz and Paul are both funnier movies.
2014;Yes, there are touching, sad and/or gory moments but, most of all, I laughed my a$$ off!I loved the movie so much, I ordered an I Got Wood shirt like the one Ed wears in the movie.
2015;LOL)Anyway, I love this film!
2016;Shaun of the Dead is the epitome of British humor .
2017;self effacing, subtle, and hilarious!Just a quick note: If you think that SOTD is going to be an all out gore.
2018;Several snippets you will need to rewind because of the occassionally thick British accents, but keep an ear out for the subtle humor.
2019;make sure you watch the extras, too .
2020;See you at the Winchester (you'll get the Winchester reference after you see the movie)!
2021;It has a hilarious plot and the ending is excellent!
2022;In a former life this movie may have been entertaining.
2023;Because Shaun's roomie and childhood friend Ed (Nick Frost), is in the way.
2024;what sets this movie apart is that it is hilarious.
2025;This is a great movie.
2026;Arrived quickly, great product for the money.
2027;teen kids watched it and loved it
2028;What a wise investment it turned out to be.
2029;sHAUN OF THE DEAD is an ingenious blend of comedy and gore, and makes a genuine stab.
2030;This is one of our favorite movies of all times.
2031;If you enjoyed Zombieland or Dawn of the Dead , you will like this film.
2032;Even if you don't traditionally like zombie films, you will enjoy this one, as it takes a tongue.
2033;Simon Pegg's best movie, in my opinion.
2034;I love the over the top gore, making fun of a classic zombie movie, and just general stupid humor.
2035;I really just wanted to give this movie 5 stars.
2036;It's extremly funny, but for a comedy/spoof.
2037;Great Zombie movie, great comedy.
2038;It manages to keep some of the thematic elements of the Romero trilogy while adding a bit of smart humor.
2039;Zombification in this film has a physiological reason (which is hidden thanks to some well.
2040;The same is true with any ideal to which one is tempted to conform.
2041;This is a wonderful British homage to Romero that just happens to be pretty funny.
2042;It is always fun when the director and/or writer is willing to open himself as such to the viewer.
2043;Pretty much as funny as zombies get.
2044;If you liked Return of the Living Dead better than Night of the Living Dead, you will love this.
2045;One of the funniest films of the past few years, Shaun of the Dead manages to skewer and lovingly address the zombie genre made popular by George Romero and other horror directors.
2046;The entire cast is great, especially the two main characters played by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.
2047;I'd recommend this disc whole heartedly to comedy fans and horror fans alike.
2048;This movie is so freaking funny, I think it was a surprise hit in the theathers not many of them were showing it.
2049;Surprisingly it has a story line, it develops characters, you don't hate Shaun or his  couch potato buddy of his, you'll even learn to love Phillips!
2050;This movie has it all gore, romance, humor, very dark humor, and good sci fi effects.
2051;I can't wait till it comes out and I'll be a proud owner come the 21st!!
2052;thank God for british humor!
2053;I seriousely think that this is the most hilarious film of the year.
2054;One good thing about this movie, is that you do not have to watch the real Dawn of the Dead in order to actually enjoy the spoof, Shaun of the Dead.
2055;He cant really be bothered to do anything along with his friend Ed.
2056;what i liked about the storyline is that it is so simple and yet hilarious.
2057;Director Edgar Wright does a wonderful job of sticking to the story as well as every so often resorting to the real version Dawn of the Dead.
2058;Great job guys in terms of storyline!Acting/script.
2059;The acting/script, i thought, was actually better then the real storyline.
2060;The words and phrases that each character comes out with are just priceless and another good thing about the characters is that each one has the same personality.
2061;This usually isn't good for movie, but when your talking about a spoof like this, its hilarious and great.
2062;The actors do a really great job on letting the world know that they are living a dull life and are just fed up with it.
2063;There really isn't that much more to the movie besides the hilarious lines, acting and the storyline.
2064;But its the comedy that make this movie great and definetely worth seeing.
2065;In a movie like this you'd expect the Indian guy in the store to be surprisingly hilarious or the mother or somebody, but nobody was really hilarious.
2066;Scary and funny it is a classic.
2067;I am not into horror films but I love thi movie.
2068;Thats just one of the things that make Shaun of the Dead so funny, these guys don't have a clue as to whats going on.
2069;what makes this brilliant is that even though they want to survive, Shaun just cant seem to want to part with his favorite records.
2070;the acting and humor in Shaun of the Dead is very entertaining and even sincere in some places.
2071;So many twists and funy moments, too many to name.
2072;i definately reccomend this movie if anyone wants a good laugh.
2073;Shaun of the dead was the best movie i saw last year and for good reason.
2074;he also has a buddy named ED who he plays video games with and mixes records and listens to techno music with .
2075;News flashes across screens, people acting very wild, un.
2076;okay well this is a smart comedy, some jokes you're gonna miss because some part of the comedy happens in the backround.
2077;what is so good about this movie is this movie turns from a light hearted comedy to a full fledged horror film towards the end and you actually feel suspense and horror from a movie you thought was going to be a dumb spoof.Yes my friend you must see this movie, it's an actual good movie from the U. k not just tasteless humour like ALI G.(watch now the hatemail flow to my email account from U. k people).
2078;the Negatives.yes even a great film like this has some negatives.
2079;pros+Good humour+great characters(except the stiff that looks like a grown harry potter)+When the horror is on!
2080;+yummmm internal organs fly everywhere, always a plus!Cons.
2081;plus it's really good.4.5 STARS ROUNDED UP TO 5!
2082;Easily finds a place in my top 20 movies, tons of laughs and jokes to be repeated amongst friends, fun to play drinking games with too :P
2083;Shaun of the Dead is one of those classic movies that I keep coming back to.
2084;Everytime I watch this, I find new and incredibly brilliant lines of comedy, easter eggs, or other small moments of insight.
2085;They put a lot of thought into making this movie, and I love every second of it.
2086;This is something I re.
2087;Shaun Of The Dead is smart and clever.
2088;This movie is great fun any zombie lover.
2089;It's funny, it's scary, and it's tightly woven.
2090;what that last one means is that it has several self.
2091;This is my favorite part of the movie, where Shaun walks from home to the store and back, NOT NOTICING the zombies around him!
2092;The scene is funny and creepy at the same time.
2093;An important moment is when Shaun removes his job nametag, thus rejecting literal and social zombification.
2094;there is swearing, and one character gets his guts ripped out, but overall Shaun of the Dead is a good movie.
2095;It's funny, scary, intelligent, well.
2096;Good movie, and especially since it wasn't done by Americans (which they surely would have ruined it!)
2097;A good British spoof on the zombie movie genre.
2098;(Sorry if this review appeared twice!
2099;These Guys are pure Gold!
2100;It's a very light hearted cheeky movie about a group dealing with a zombie infection.
2101;I love it when a movie can be watched over and over again.
2102;Good Movie must add to your collection.
2103;shaun takes it's cue mainly from DAwn of the Dead.
2104;Quite a wonderful skewering of middle America.
2105;shaun of the Dead is the best Zombie movie in many years.
2106;Kudos again for Mr. Wright for calling them out.
2107;if I have one complaint, it's that the last 3rd of the film is played mostly as a straight zombie horror film and the comedy takes a bit of a back seat.
2108;I cannot recommend this one any higher!
2109;in my honest opinion(IMHO) this is a great zombie film, a great comedy.
2110;iMHO this is the best bromance/ buddy comedy film in my collection(250+ movies)If you haven't seen this film yet, please do.
2111;Shaun of the DeadArguably, the best Horror/Comedy out there and also one of my favorite Zombie movies.
2112;i highly recommend viewing this film, a personal favorite.
2113;I had heard from early on, that this will be the next great zombie movie.
2114;Even a director that put out one of the last good horror movies and a man i greatly respect, Eli Roth Cabin Fever loved this film.
2115;So my friend watch it and determine for yourself.
2116;It's one of my favorite movies of all time because of its perfect balance of horror and comedy with a little splash of romance.
2117;I never would have thought that these elements could work so well together, but Edgar Wright's masterpiece of a zombie film proved me wrong.
2118;The buildup to the zombie outbreak is simply perfect.
2119;One of the things that makes this film great is the repetition.
2120;There are quite a few things like this (way too many to write about) that provide many laughs and are also a sign of great writing.
2121;simon Pegg as Shaun and Nick Frost as Ed are a hilarious comedic duo.
2122;Shaun is the meek, kind of quiet slacker who lets others push him around.
2123;On Z. day, he turns his entire life around and does all the things he has always wanted to do.
2124;They are definitely an unlikely duo to become leaders during the zombie apocalypse, but at the same time are realistic characters.
2125;their friendship is exhibited throughout the film, even when they are in the direst of situations.
2126;Although much of the film is funny, there are a few very emotional and touching scenes that brought me to tears.
2127;The ability for such a funny movie to succeed in having heartbreaking, tear inducing scenes is amazing and shows a culmination of writing, acting, and directing.
2128;shaun of the Dead has it all: zombies, humor, romance, loss, video games, and electro.
2129;This is what Shaun of the Dead is like.
2130;mash scenes in the bar, the movie is great fun to watch.
2131;Love this movie, read everyone else's raves for my take on it.
2132;May be fun to watch for those who enjoy brains smashed with shovels and bloody guts all over the screen.
2133;I mean, what are two of the strongest humor emotions?
2134;you can have one darn fine movie.
2135;I've been looking forward to this movie since I first saw it advertised in U. s. theaters, and I can sincerely say that it lived up to the highest of my expectations.
2136;but Shaun is given a chance to win back Liz, as well as fix things up with his mother (Nicola Cunningham) and stepdad.
2137;As a fan, I can say that anyone else who liked those movies will love Shaun of the Dead.
2138;ever seen a man get ripped to pieces right in front of you, while he's still living, and his guts eaten?)
2139;The cast is terrific, Pegg especially.
2140;This is one of the best films of the year, and easily the best horror.
2141;I was entertained throughout the entire film.
2142;Hilarious and absorbing, Shaun is anything but dead.
2143;Horror fans will like it as well as comedy fans.
2144;Being a HUGE fan of the British series Spaced (also directed by Edgar Wright and written/starring Simon Pegg), I really enjoyed this movie.
2145;I watched it a second time today and it's still entertaining.
2146;Simon Pegg is on the verge of breaking out in the US and Edgar Wright is an amazing talent for such a young director.
2147;His filming style is flawless and this movie is a nice start to what I hope is a lucrative career for everyone involved.
2148;every part of it was done perfectly and it was flawless.
2149;this is the one movie you must see asap.
2150;also i suggest you seesaw.
2151;also a good movie for a true horror fan
2152;Some of the zombies look great.
2153;Enjoy it for what it is.
2154;Tight story telling and a great riff on the classic zombie apocalypse story.
2155;Good for a larf and love the 80's nostalgia soundtrack.
2156;This is definitely in my top ten of all time.
2157;Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are the Laurel and Hardy, the Lewis and Sinatra, the Harold and Kumar (errr), of our generation.
2158;Clever dialogue, awesome buddy pic, hillarity ensues.
2159;It has EVERYTHING I LOVE about in this one movie, fun, funny, romance, action, beautiful places, beautiful people, beautiful music, and classy British taste and creativity.
2160;A directly humorous attempt, that is, the humans are the source of most of the comedy instead of the zombies.
2161;That's was a nice touch.
2162;When it needs to be funny, it delivers.
2163;When it needs to be gruesome, it also delivers.
2164;One of the few horror films that takes the time to develop the characters in the film.
2165;I like any style, realism, comedic, dark comedy, camp, but this spoof definitely excels.
2166;A nice balance of scares to laughs.
2167;good movie, clear picture, great sound.
2168;i loved this movie when it came out in 2005 and truely feel it was the sleeper flick of the year.
2169;This film is fast pace with lots of smart jokes and off color humor that is very enjoyable to watch.
2170;Despite the rather corny title, 'Shaun of the Dead' is a funny and often brilliant, even intelligent spoof on horror films, in this case, zombies in particular.
2171;that's it, 'Shaun of the Dead' is filled with British humor, peppered with occasional pop culture references.
2172;It understands the rules of so many zombie films, and twists and uses it for its own purpose to make us laugh.
2173;the film, as is the case with intelligent films, works as off.
2174;See one incredibly hilarious scene where Shawn, himself being 'in the weather' because of the last night's booze, walks in the street, not noticing at all that the town has already been full of the zombies roaming.
2175;until he and Ed do realize that she is a real thing.
2176;But the ending, which is quite original, would makes it up for the loss of creative energy that keeps up the entire film several notched higher than usual spoofs.
2177;Zombie land was the next best thing to this.
2178;Many US fans of the zombie genre will just love the movie because it is well done.
2179;The fun thing to do at my house is try and find background actors in multiple scenes of the film.
2180;You are missing one of the rare best zombie movie we have in years.
2181;Shaun of the Dead is a comedy classic in my book.
2182;Edgar Wright is a fantastic director that was underappreciated for Scott Pilgrim.
2183;All of his films deserve to be owned, watched, and enjoyed.
2184;What I do criticize is its blu.
2185;Nobody wants to watch this film 7 times to receive all the special features.
2186;Treat your films seriously and provide fans with a blu.
2187;i summed it up before: Great Movie, Tedious Blu.
2188;The picture and sound is great, but the features are a drag.
2189;Wright's flawless ability to blend absurd comedy and drama is always refreshing.
2190;Here's an interesting turn on the zombie.
2191;perfect horror film (there is some serious gore, be warned), it's also very, very funny.
2192;Whats more, the movie has a big heart, and an endearing troop of characters we pray won't end up as food.
2193;Movie arrived in two days, thank to prime membership.
2194;I think this is a great movie with great humor and great lines.
2195;While the comedy is wryly British, it is still funny .
2196;just a fun movie, from start to finish .
2197;There is a lot of 'quick.
2198;strip away the humor and homage, and there is actually a much tighter plot than many movies.
2199;Impressed by the attention to those kind of details.
2200;it's billed as a Romantic Comedy with Zombies .
2201;We enjoyed watching a movie that actually made you laugh out loud and this one does throughout.
2202;A hilarious commentary, very well done film to the very end.
2203;spoof on the past, great cast wonderfully done!
2204;Funny movie spoffed off the original.
2205;Great lines and observations of live.
2206;It was a good movie, at least what I was able to watch.
2207;Haven't opened package yet, it's a gift, but it seems in good shape.
2208;Shaun of the Dead clearly has a lot of fun playing with horror movie conventions, especially those of (duh) zombie movies, and it does so in such a fast.
2209;paced manner, and with special effects that are so much more impressive than you'd expect to see in such a low.
2210;Shaun of the Dead is its own creation, one that takes Romero's Dead trilogy as its starting point but comes up with more than enough inspired ideas of its own.
2211;It's billed as A smash hit romantic comedy.
2212;with zombies, and while that description isn't too far off, the movie actually encompasses a significantly broader range of styles.
2213;it's rare for movies to work on this many levels, but Shaun of the Dead is such a great movie largely because it's so wide.
2214;ranging in tone: at its best, it perfectly encapsulates the combination of high comedy, horror, and drama that is everyday life, zombies or no zombies.
2215;and of course, it doesnt hurt that the movie's incredibly watchable from beginning to end, and undeniably hilarious for much of that time as well.
2216;Edgar Wright, who co. wrote the script with Pegg, directs the movie with a manic, stylish, and ruthless efficiency that keeps things moving briskly from one wildly entertaining set piece to another.
2217;Slapstick humor effortlessly shares space with plenty of dry British wit, with several truly unforgettable scenes along the way: you've got Shaun and his best friend Ed fending off the advances of a zombie while thinking she's just drunk
2218;wasting extras to enhance the viewing experience.
2219;First off i'd like to say this movie was great and i got plenty of laughs out of it.
2220;I really liked this movie and thought it was funny, but the rest of the family didnt like it.
2221;he needs to watch it again and actually watch it.
2222;this movie is very, very funny.
2223;The writing is smart, and includes inside references to any number of horror/scifi movies.
2224;This is another of those movies definitely made for adults.
2225;It is especially rewarding if you've seen the original Dawn of the Dead, but funny even if you don't get all the references to that cult classic.
2226;If you haven't seen it, watch it!
2227;This is a laugh out loud, fantastic comedy!
2228;The characters are rich and interesting and the movie is a delight.
2229;It's one of the funniest movies of the year.
2230;Guys, let me tell you, I saw what had to be the best movie of the year.
2231;Now keep in mind what I like, but to back it up, I've seen nothing but fantastic reviews on this movie and 4 star ratings.
2232;Yes, it is about zombies, but in the most ridiculous hilarious way you could ever imagine.
2233;But the story is excellent, the ending is super, and you will be laughing throughout the movie.
2234;The perfect combination of British comedy, romantic comedy, and zombie horror flick.
2235;The main character, Shaun, is one of the most likeable protagonists I have ever cheered for in a Zombie movie.
2236;It also ranks in the top 5 best Zombie Movies of all time.
2237;(More towards 4 1/2 stars)It's funny.
2238;One of the best comedies i've ever seen.
2239;this movie finally shows everyone what I have always believed.
2240;Walks through the town, goes to the store, gets a beer, goes home, doesn't notice a thing.
2241;lots of good comedy in this movie.
2242;It was all good until they got into the pub.
2243;It dropped the comedy thing for a while.
2244;Dawn of the Dead 2004(17 movies later, this is still the best)2.)
2245;The only one that I found entertaining(3 stars entertaining) was Creepshow.
2246;This film is one the most funniest films I ever see, the main character already worth the movie, Shaun is not a looser, he is a BIG looser but the great loosers are the great leaders (anyone remember dawn of dead 2004?)
2247;The movie is replete with memorable scenes, but the movie is not only about zombies and gore is about love and friendship, at last an instantaneous classic.
2248;Prepare your popcorn and enjoy it.
2249;Shaun of the Dead is twice as funny as both, and an INSTANT CLASSIC!!
2250;The movie truly holds up!
