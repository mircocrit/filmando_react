1;I really love this movie.
2;It is as real as real gets.
3;Sideways has a fine premise for a movie: Two friends go traveling in Northern California to celebrate the freedom of bachelorhood before one of them gets married.
4;We may not always like the characters (and maybe we're not supposed to), but we can find their struggles and the story appealing enough.
5;The story is complete, unlike some films that only try to illustrate relationships and do little else.
6;Sideways is a worthy trip and a good diversion, but it may require an acquired palette.
7;I dont understand how the critics hailed this movie as one of the best of 2004.
8;They could have made a more interesting and engaging film at considerably less expense by focusing the camera on a pleasantly colored wall of wet paint and filming the drying process with some elevator music in the background.
9;funny so. called 'comedy' I've ever seen!!
10;The only time I even laughed (snickered, actually.
11;church, Madsen, Oh) give great performances.
12;When I read the glowing reviews for this snoozefest, I keep wondering .
13;"Let's take a close look at the movie ""Sideways."""
14;take randomn, unbelievable situations, two likeable, female characters who have NO chemistry with our protaganists, and be sure to add generous amounts of lame wine metaphors for life.
15;wise, that makes this movie work or enjoyable.
16;in order to garner what few laughs the film has.
17;"Sideways has made an@l intercourse humor ""highbrow."
18;Sideways is an amazingly average film.
19;dimensional characters, the neurotic angst.
20;(The latter, by the way, is played by Thomas Hayden Church, so he's certainly familiar with the territory.)
21;Tour California wine country and get laid as much as possible before the wedding.
22;but on the plus side, the scenery is truly gorgeous.
23;The movie focuses heavily on this conflict, which is intensified when the duo comes in contact with two local woman (played by Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen), and Jack has a wild fling with one of them.
24;There is plenty humor in this movie, although it's subtle, and it's not the type of picture that will have you falling out of your chair with laughter.
25;"i recommend ""Sideways"" if you're looking for a film with clever dialogue and a serious plot with crafty humor."
26;"If you like movies like ""Lost in Translation"" this should be appealing."
27;I also found similarities to certain Woody Allen movies and characters, but without the New York neuroticisms.
28;The FilmWhat a great film.
29;Sideways is one of the few movies based on a book that improves a good deal over its source material.
30;And it is absolutely hilarious.
31;The film blends friendship, the road trip and a party flick.
32;The wine provides an interesting tenor to boot.
33;Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael created a unique look for the visuals to give the film a signature feel.
34;the end product is a vintage style soft image.
35;I will continually stand by my point with two arguments pertaining to this film.
36;The first being that this fine piece of cinematic brilliance should have won an Academy Award this year.
37;To me, all very symbolic of being a human being.
38;His performance was the strongest that I saw last year, and the strongest that I have seen so far this year.
39;"He brought his character to life, giving us this sense of ""every man"" coupled with that oh."
40;with that grumbling aside, I strongly think that this was an amazing film by any standards.
41;Alexander Payne has proven, with this film and his previous outings that he can capture the American spirit while also showing us a world that is originally not seen in other films.
42;The cinematography was beautiful and breathtaking.
43;For any of us that have never been to that side of the world, Payne gives us that glimpse and creates that sensation of excitement.
44;Payne not only miraculously showed us a beautiful part of our country, but also brought forward the passion for wine.
45;It is one of those rare cinematic moments where the wine just seeps from the edges of your television, and you instantly fall in love.
46;so, you have a brilliant mind behind the camera giving the direction, you have a passionate subject that explores one of America's pastimes, what else is there to rave about this film.
47;Giamatti was, well, a genius and I will forever wave my fist at the Academy for forgetting him.
48;overall, as if you couldn't tell already, I thought that this was one of the best cinematic outings to come out of Hollywood this year.
49;Payne, unlike his early work with Miramax, had complete creative control over this project and he proved that he could handle a balanced story, with complex characters and plenty of wine.
50;His passion for our American landscape shined brightly through this film as it did with About Schmidt, as he toured us through some unknown nooks and crannies of our nation.
51;"He proved, to the film community, that he is ready for bigger, bolder projects, and I have no doubt in my mind that we will soon see his face with a ""Best Director"" Oscar right next to it."
52;Alexander Payne is one of Hollywood's most underappreciated secrets, and it is about time that he is unleashed onto the world.
53;Not for everyone but I have always really enjoyed this movie and think its a great story and slight comedy.
54;If you love the California wine scene or just wine in general this movie is a classic.
55;As a frequent visitor to Solvang and the Santa Barbara area wineries this movie reminds me of so many great places.
56;If you have never been to Santa Ynez its definitely worth the trip, and all of the wineries and restaurants from the movie are worth visiting.
57;Now I can enjoy My Movie on My Day oFF.
58;It was recommended to me from friends and I decided to take a break from my horror movies and get into some drama.
59;I have always been a fan of Paul Giamatti.
60;"I remember the first time I saw him in ""Private Parts"" and though he was just hilarious."
61;I am not sure what it is, but he is able to play very memorable characters.
62;A very unique character to say the least, Thomas Haden Church plays Jack a friend Miles (Giamatti) who is having doubts about his wedding.
63;Jack not knowing anything about wine is hilarious when Miles tries to explain the joys of wine drinking to him.
64;His loyalty to his unmoral friend is amazing.
65;This was a film that I truly enjoyed.
66;It showed phenomenal acting and directing, just a wonderfully made film.
67;Funny, interesting, and a bit sad, it's one of the smartest comedies to come along in quite some time.
68;This is, far and away, my favorite movie of all time.
69;but, the commentary is fantastic and well worth the price.
70;And the price, for a Blu Ray disc, is definitely right.
71;Good luck finding another movie, let alone a good one, on Blu Ray, for about $10.
72;"First off, I want to say that ""Sideways"" is one of the most well written movies I have come across in a long time, and for the most part I really enjoyed this movie."
73;I thought Paul Giamatti had excellent comedic timing, but also did a great job of showing utter dissapointment with life in ones middle age.
74;Loved the qups between Jack and MilesChemistry.
75;All 4 characters were perfectly well cast.
76;I especially liked Virginia Madsen's performacne, as she had the ability to do what Miles wanted from someone all along, and that was to tell him he wasn't a failure.
77;I loved how they would discuss wine as a metaphor for life and love.
78;"There are 2 ""sex"" scenes in this movie."
79;I actually found this scene to be pretty funny, and quick.
80;overall, a wonderful film about life, love and what friendship really entails, and yes it was very profound at times, and yes it was extremly funny on many occassions, but that one scene in the final 5 minutes really hurt this film considerably.
81;Also, seeing Lowell from Wings be a total sociopath is highly entertaining.
82;A scene where he is chewing gum while tasting wine is, to me, a classic.
83;i recommend this one without reservations.
84;I just moved to Santa Ynez so it was fun to see the places they went.
85;Overall I liked the movie.
86;Nothing to complain, a pretty enjoyable and fun movie!
87;meaning that the critics loved it and I felt like I'm from another planet because I thought it sucked.
88;executed and has bits of hilarity, ultimately this movie is as morose, aimless and self.
89;indulgent as it's lead character.
90;I want people who are interesting to watch, who want something (money, power, sex, safety), and the something they want is powerful in their lives.
91;I saw this movie because I thought Election was brilliant and wanted more of the same.
92;It is in no way amusing or entertaining.
93;And it is most definately not, as one reviewer described it 'heartwarming'.
94;see a man make promises of eternal love and devotion to a woman who he has known only a few days.
95;This flick was a blast, funny, well written, well acted and while certainly a stylized realism (a bit over the top here and there) it showed human emotion and behavior in such a shocking way that it couldn't help but be a good movie.
96;I'd told her early in the day that I'd seen the movie.
97;"The characters in the movie are very recognizable
98;The story is good, the dialogue is great, and the actors/actresses all do a superb job"
99;If you are a fan of such films as 'Lost In Translation', 'About Schmidt' or even 'Garden State', there's a good chance you'll enjoy this.
100;The movie overall was very well done.
101;We moved to the SYV and it was great to have more of a familarity with the spots that are claiming to be affiliated with the movie.
102;He is such an incredible actor that you really feel his pain.
103;I like the idea of the film and generally felt the characters stayed true to themselves.
104;He still gets to marry his beautiful fiancee and never really learns anything from his adventure.
105;trust me, you'll want it!Great performances and a definite must see.
106;In my opinion, Babette's Feast is a much worthier tribute to the joys of food and drink, if one can bear a subtitle or two.
107;Along the way, there is a bit of humor, a bit of despair, and a bit of wine.
108;The movie itself is hilarious and a great movie to watch with wine lovers.
109;"this rather dark ""comedy"" is actually one of the most introspectively maudlin pictures you could possibly see, however knowing this going in, you can't ask for a more engaging story or cast."
110;Fantastic script, acting, subject matter, and storyline.
111;Beautiful scenery in Santa Rita Hills.
112;This is the sort of movie that critics love.
113;This is supposed to be a hilarious comedy, the best movie of the year with an incredible script.
114;Yes, the scene between Miles and Maya is nice, but it can't save the movie.
115;doesn't make you more realistic, nor is it especially funny.
116;This is a film about a loser winning (Jack) and a loser losing but perhaps making a surprise come.
117;this movie really deserves to be seen.
118;Giamatti's and Church's characters may not be role models but they are truthful and full of life.
119;"characters are very vivid, situations are real, relashionship is full of nuances, ""Sideways"" sometimes are extremely funny and very sad also."
120;You really start feeling compassion towards the characters especially if you try to imagine yourself in their shoes.
121;And especially if you're a man.
122;Because practically Giamatti and Church personify here two types of men that exist on our planet.
123;It's really touching and although it's not a tear.
124;it's a real man's movie and those will be real man's tears.
125;The latest, brilliant work from director Alexander Payne, who once again finds the empty, lonely heart at the center of so much American life.
126;I have watched it many times, and still find wonderful things in the performances of Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh (Mrs Payne at the time the film was made).
127;All I can say is: you sound just like a character in a Alexander Payne movie!
128;I will admit that I laughed.
129;"this is all the more remarkable when you consider that this film was nominated for Oscars, critically praised to the heavens, and reviewed as the ""best movie of the year!"""
130;o film's this is great for you.
131;I think my wife and I chuckled at exactly one line in the movie.
132;other reviewers are correct that the acting was excellent.
133;In this case, I think the film got a lot of kudos due to the fine acting.
134;In order to care, we need to see some good qualities early in the movie.
135;That sums up this movie!
136;regarded movie so perhaps it's me and I don't have a resonant sense of humor or something.
137;So, maybe gives you an idea of the type stick.
138;If you love wine, appreciate life after divorce and the commitment of friends .
139;this movie will make you laugh and reflect!
140;The movie makes fun of snooty wine drinkers as well as the novice drinker.
141;The movie focuses on the grooms get away one week prior to his wedding and portrays the characters worst and best sides of their personalities.
142;There are many crude scenes so the modest viewer beware!
143;But if you can allow yourself to sit back and enjoy their journey I think most will recognize themselves, former loves and friendships depicted.
144;One of my favorite movies ever!
145;I laugh every time I watch it!
146;Alexander Payne has a gift for exploring human conditions and I love his balance of entertaining while describing the struggles many have with life in our privileged society.
147;The best part about this great movie is the side.
148;deprecating, it is the best special feature ever.
149;Miles, still fresh from his year.
150;however, the mixture of despair and humor make this a great movie.
151;Watch it and hopefully you'll love it, also.
152;I generally like 'smart', 'offbeat', 'sophisticated', 'critically praise' films.
153;The best part of it was seeing areas I grew up in.
154;A terrific little movie, one that sneaks up on you in quiet, almost nondescript little ways.
155;You start out thinking it's going one way, then it goes, well .
156;The screenplay is the true standout here.
157;The actors are given so much depth and complexity to work with.
158;The characters are richly drawn, three dimensional and, at times, laugh.
159;It appears simple, unobtrusive, but is so smart.
160;There's a lot going on in the frame if one takes the time to study it.
161;Alexander Payne loves to load every image with a lot of symbolical detail .
162;Sideways is a gift of a film, something we don't see from Hollywood anymore.
163;A rich tapestry of feelings, raw emotions, personal revelations.
164;I really enjoyed this movie.
165;It's funny, awkward, and touching.
166;It's got a *great* ending.
167;If you're looking for high drama, big action, stunning cinematography.
168;and genuine humor, give sideways a try.
169;After watching it, it easily made my top 5 all time fav.
170;The acting is top notch and the story doesn't lag at all.
171;If your sick of slap stick immature humor then sideways is your best bet.
172;Easily one of the best comedies out there.
173;Sideways is a great film about two buddies that go on one last trip to the wine country in Ca before one of them gets married.
174;driving through wine country and tasting along the way is what the story anchored on,But the people Miles and Jack come into contact with,how we connect with people we meet,was so true to life like.
175;especially Miles character got to me so much.
176;if you are a person with a deep well of feeling,and an intelligent person, you will love this movie.
177;It's one of a kind.
178;"I remember when there was a time we used to watch movies for entertainment, with good editing, good direction and excellent scripts
179;verdict: Overall quite an enjoyable movie with some really witty dialogue not to mention the mini.
180;It strikes a decent balance between good filmmaking and a modern.
181;rating: 4 stars for a well written movie made with a lot of emotion and creditable performance.
182;It is absolutely not what I was expecting.
183;I enjoyed this movie when it first came out.
184;themed gift basket along with wines from the region where the movie takes place.
185;The gift was a hit.
186;Sideways, the first comedy (well, dramedy) to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture in recent memory, is in serious danger of being overhyped.
187;Viewers will come to it expecting """"one of the best films of the last decade"""" or a """"hilarious"""" film and be disappointed, which is a shame, because the modest charms it actually has are quite engaging."""
188;to wit: This is a film that substitutes quiet charm for laugh.
189;And, frankly, thank goodness for that.
190;If only more Best Picture nominees were created by film makers content to make a satisfying film, instead of a religious experience.
191;I rarely enjoy comedies as much as this one.
192;it's more of a guy movie.
193;pretty much how guys talk and act when they're not with mixed company.
194;it's kind of a mid.
195;or the humorous side of mid.
196;neither of these guys would be one of my buddies in real life (both are irritating), but they are funny characters.
197;sandra Oh is really cute in this movie.
198;Alex Payne, an alum from the same Catholic Jesuit high school in Omaha that I attended, I find to be one of the most honest and fresh directors that film has had in a long time.
199;He emphasizes this truth in casting relative unknowns in his movies (besides the occassional star like Nicholson), filming them with the perfect background music, shots of nature, and other great techniques.
200;Beautiful movie, go see it today!
201;the film definitely has an avant.
202;guard feel with its early double, triple, and quadruple feature frames and camera angles.
203;The landscape of the wine country is marvelous so the physical setting could not be improved upon.
204;Authenticity is the most accurate word for the film making.
205;The one is a connoisseur of outstanding wine while the other just wants to know what the alcohol content is.
206;i'd have to say that Sideways is a highly refreshing film as it is subtle, sensitive, and redeeming.
207;If you are looking for a great wine movie I recommend SIDEWAYS which was up for a lot of 2005 Oscars.
208;As someone whose family has been in California for seven generations now, it is always a treat to see a movie that shows off the gorgeous scenery of California, including its awesome wineries.
209;And a bigger hoot to spot favorite wineries whose sites were shown in the movie.
210;The good elements: great CA scenery,good on the wine tasting,some good sexscenes.
211;that in and of itself is hilarious.
212;but this film has an amazing way of making you sympathize, and care for, two deeply flawed characters.
213;He tries, and succeeds, at picking up any women he meets during the trip, despite his upcoming tying of the not.
214;But watching the relationship between the two men, how they support and compliment each other in their imperfection, is what makes us love these characters.
215;Both devices work here, but it is how Sideways shows how two incredibly faulted yet fundamentally decent people can connect with each other, and us.
216;Seriously, when you have a one night stand do you honestly think that person loves you and wants to be with you for the rest of your life, and would make an awesome father figure for your 5 yr old son???
217;Sideways had so much potential to me before I viewed it and the hype behind it made it appear as a kitschy wacky movie for wine lovers.
218;This is a very sublime story line encapsulated in a frenzy of very believable real life mistakes made by the characters.
219;This movie is a great example of what happens when a darling of independent film festivals become large enough to go mainstream and becomes widely available.
220;for the smaller few, this is a great and gloomy look at what life often is and the small redemption's are sometimes all we find.
221;One of the great things about it is that it's mostly shot on location which is not common these days.
222;Also the acting is very good until the movie's almost over, and then some of the seconds don't live up to the par of the leads.
223;if that weren't enough, Jack, his best buddy, is now getting married and Miles has to be his Best Man.
224;wife and her new husband are coming to the wedding, too.
225;anxiety medications, something is about to break.
226;but what the two have brought along with them on this trip is their pasts, their present, and, ultimately, their futures.
227;Third, this film moves you into the characters' lives gently, kind of like getting into a pool filled with ice water.
228;"This movie has ""true"" characters."""
229;"so if you're the type who goes into a theater expecting to be ""blown away"" by the special effects, bypass this one and spare us your review here."
230;But if you enjoy character studies, and don't mind a slow, funny, touching, and downright realistic film, you'll probably love this one.
231;(Congratulations to the screenwriters for their Oscar win!)
232;In fact, when you reflect on some of his notable roles (e. g., Lady In The Water [Blu.
233;"he has clearly been chosen precisely for his ability to convey such negative and complex emotions
234;it's a lovely, touching movie, that uses as its springboard a venture into Californian wine country, as a holiday between two male friends, one of whom, a surface.

236;the two female leads, Virginia Madsen, who plays the love interest to Giamatti's character, and Sandra Oh, who plays the sex/passion interest of Thomas Haden Church's character, are performed with charm, good humour and a touching, gentle and real grace.
237;It is a great complement to the Hollywood road movie and the buddy.
238;"buddy/friendship genres
239;The dialogue is crisp and sharp, the acting (from the entire ensemble) is top notch and it's a joy, joy, joy to absorb (never mind the wonderful education you get about some terrific Californian wines along the way .
240;The other day I thought about watching """"Sideways"""" for a second time, and I thought to myself, """"."""
241;so I'll have to revise what I just said .
242;i thought Virginia Madsen was very good until the scene where she describes her romantic interest in wine.
243;Then, like other reviewers, I thought she was amazing.
244;"But then ""Maya"" gives us an honest and genuine assessment, reminding us that there is decency and honesty, even in the world of wine."

249;"Either way, this revelation is another big ""Ouch,"" literally."
250;the European writers and directors do a much better job with this genre of a movie.
251;And why on earth is it considered a comedy?
252;"That being able to taste subtle differences in wine ""varietals"" gives him class."
253;And brings home a guy she just met in a bar and her claim to fame is she has sex like an animal.
254;I did not particularly enjoy this film.
255;He is a great actor in this.
256;This story is depressing to me, but it's really good.
257;It was informative on wine.
258;As a wine fan and a Californian who is familiar with the Santa Barbara area wineries, I thought I might enjoy it.
259;on some levels, this movie delivers.
260;The cinematography is excellent, and the screenwriters knew their wine.
261;There are parts of this movie that are really funny.
262;It's humorous, if not disturbing, to see all the moral proclamations against this movie.
263;Great writing and superb acting by a stand out cast make this a perfect movie to own.
264;Nominated for five Academy Awards, and winner of Best Screenplay adapted from an outside source, Sideways turned out to be one of the surprise blockbusters of 2004.
265;Based on the Rex Pickett novel of the same name, Sideways is a clever comedy about wine, life, and a group of friends .
266;each in search of his unique identity.
267;"driven movies that traditionally dominate Hollywood, Sideways is one of those rare pictures which actually ""reads"" like a novel."
268;With very little to speak of in the way of plot, the movie relies heavily on the development of its quirky characters, and in this aspect, Sideways is an overwhelming success.
269;Something about this movie (which I can't quite put my finger on) makes me love it, and I'm willing to bet that you'll enjoy it too.
270;oftentimes hilarious, sometimes deeply symbolic, Sideways runs the gambit of human emotion.

272;Together, Haden Church and Giamatti create an unforgettable screen combination.
273;and it's this powder keg mixture of relationships between Jack, Miles, Maya, and Stephanie that give Sideways its enticing cinematic flavor.
274;It's a film about life and decisions and relationships and happiness and everything else.
275;More importantly, it's one of the most interesting and entertaining films of the last several years, and that's why Sideways is a definite must.
276;"One's repressed, sensitive
277;Throughout, they establish their friendship and loyalty for each other through a series of adventures that are terrifically interesting, often funny, and sometimes moving.
278;You are drawn into the action, and pretty much feel like you are right there with them.
279;That's good acting, writing, directing, etc.
280;nominated for five academy awards, including best picture.
281;This movie really had potential, but it's amazing how Hollywood writers can take a good idea and completely ruin it.
282;It was unique and the characters seemed like real people in that they were flawed.
283;I hadn't had time to run out and see this film when it was in theatres, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it on an in.

291;Great film, great performances, how could I give it less than five stars?
292;Sideways is absolutely worth purchasing.
293;Together they are an indefatigable duo that you will definitely want to see paired up again.
294;Sideways is well written, acted, produced and directed.
295;Sideways is a classic film, because it perfectly captures the angst of a growing american demographic.
296;Many films explore the angst of the young.
297;This movie is one of the few that explore the angst of those who are no longer young.
298;This movie is so true to some people's lives that they will view it like a horror movie.
299;they are intelligent, but the hard knocks of life have taken their toll.
300;what I love about sideways is that it is realistic, but ultimately hopeful.
301;though it could be seeen as a horror film for the lost middle aged, it is also ultimately a life affirming story for them.
302;And that is why this film is a classic.
303;& I love this movie.
304;This flick is cleverly written.
305;Much more than wine, this movie is hilarious and poignant in ways that will appeal to almost everyone.
306;Relationships, self interests, and class cultures collide in this hilarious yet entwining tale of a wine tasting excursion between friends gone somewhat awry.
307;this one is sure to please.
308;The pair is a subtle, comedic duo of contrasting personalities.
309;Miles, is a deeply serious man who is working on a book, Jack is a carefree part.

317;the redeeming scene in the movie, the one that salvages it from mediocrity, is the revealing exchange between two thoughtful characters explaining their appreciation of wine.

322;Have seen Sideways numerous times, and with each viewing it gets richer.
323;Locations are dynamite, the quartet cast plays beautifully off one another, and the story and directing are totally solid.
324;Giamatti delivers his role perfectly and Thomas Haden Church is a hilarious wing man.
325;whether wine enthusiast, film enthusiast, or both, it is worth seeing!
326;At least the porn people are honest about what they do for a living.
327;I've always enjoyed this movie.
328;It's even better with a nice glass of pinot noir!
329;If you can't get to Napa Valley this is the next best thing!
330;This movie reflected the lives of two less than admirable guys.
331;His career has peaked, though, and he sees marriage as his last chance.
332;Together they will go on a double date that will take them through deception to ultimate truth, and for Jack and Miles, it will be a lesson in life, betrayal, and a chance for redemption.
333;sideways is a great film about 4 humans, each with their own good points and flaws.
334;sandra Oh gave an excellent performance in Sideways.
335;Out of 1,000 young women who auditioned for the role, Oh got the part, and gave a very memorable performance, so I wasn't surprised to see her turn up again in Sideways, and doing Oh so well.
336;her character in Sideways is Stephanie, a single mother who works as a bartender in a winery.
337;She is very knowledgeable about wine, and also has a zest for living.
338;Even though she may be a product of the wish fulfillment principle, she was a very real person, who was totally believable.
339;virginia Madsen, who played Maya, was also fantastic.
340;She not only feigned attraction to Miles, but also gave an excellent monologue about how much she loved wine, and how she came to realize that she loved wine.
341;alexander Payne did a great job of directing.
342;Repeated viewings constantly reward you with new details and insights into how well the story was paced, how the momentum flowed, how little details were juxtaposed to either counterpoint or enhance the main action.
343;The cinematography was excellent, with colors that were almost pastel, or depending on the mood, dark and foreboding.
344;thomas Haden Church has a life that in some ways parallels his character Jack.
345;There are so many great scenes and little touches that make his character come to life.
346;The way he keeps three condoms for himself and gives Miles one when they all end up at Stephanie's after their double date.
347;And then later the next day, takes it back.
348;And for this, he was nominated for an Oscar.
349;He steals money from her.
350;He is passionate about wine, especially Pinot Noir, and seems sincere and genuine, but is an alcoholic, or at least using wine to escape from his problems.
351;Paul Giamatti is perfectly cast in this role.
352;He can go from funny to sad in 60 seconds.
353;Anyone who would find this movie enjoyable or even funny must have found the mating of flies interesting!
354;If you like comedy and want to know more about wine, this move is great.
355;But THIS movie is in a class of its own.
356;One of the best movie of the year.
357;It is funny for sure.
358;At the same time his friend enjoys the trip with new girls.
359;Wonderful story, perfect characters, nice California scenes.
360;Highly recommended for wine lovers.
361;A film whose subtle touches, scenes and words stay with you long after you've left the theater.
362;Some here have protested that """"people don't really talk like that"""", but Maya has an impressive academic resume (a professor's ex."""
363;"Miles is built up as the ultimate ""loyal friend"" with a sense of duty, yet as Best Man he abandons the wedding before the reception where he has the obligation to make the toast."
364;comic possibilities of the reception (Miles + Jack + pregnant ex.
365;but again, the thoughtfulness and performances overcome these annoyances.
366;It's also interesting that a film set entirely in California is so non.
367;Paul Giamatti's performance is brilliant!
368;Thomas Haden Church's character is so comedic!
369;The adventures they go on through central Californias beautiful wine country is hilarious, depressing, beautiful and maddening.
370;I always enjoy it and always find something new about it.
371;(Having just returned from the Santa Barbara region, it was especially enjoyable to watch again.
372;Revisiting those beautiful areas on the big screen was fun!)
373;A great movie for adults, scenery from the California coast, wine lovers, dating, and what you want or would not want in a relationship.
374;Sideways has great acting, is really funny, and is a great buddy movie for adults.
375;The real gem of the movie is the scenary of California's Central Coast.
376;It is a stream of consciousness story, but it has all the elements of a good adventure.
377;the best part about this movie is its reality.
378;middle aged guys, one who loves wine and the other who could care less, take a trip from Los Angeles northward to the wineries of the Santa Ynez Valley on the eve of the latter's wedding.
379;This sense of reality really makes you connect with the characters.
380;paul Giamatti is classic Paul Giamatti in this movie.
381;These two loves provide the conflict in the story and make for some really funny adventures with his neanderthal.
382;"If you're looking for a good story with fun acting and character development, ""Sideways"" will fit the bill.5 stars"
383;So, the situation here and the human emotions provide the laughs.
384;The subtle and understated manner is refreshing and even harkens back to some of those Woody Allen comedies.
385;The stories were just great, real stories.
386;Your time is more valuable than any sort of gratification this movie could ever possibly provide.
387;I was excited to see this movie.
388;There were a few funny parts and itz always great to see people work their problems out in the end.
389;But there is a lot of context that leaves you feeling BLAH.
390;Perhaps because Giamatti and Madsen get to explore deeper characters, they can shine more.
391;the filmmaking is nice, and there are some beautiful views of California's wine country, and some poignant moments.
392;thought out, nicely acted, interesting movie.
393;So I give it four stars, not five.
394;"fashioned, but in order to enjoy a movie I must ""like"" the (at least one)characters or at least be able to relate to them."
395;I will be the first to admit, that the acting is top.
396;The scenery was great .
397;I truly felt transported to California wine country.
398;While they are a collection of extremely smart people, rarely do my tastes in really good movies ever agree with theirs.
399;The actors in the movie deserved more.
400;The cover has critics saying it is the funniest movie of the year, great comedy, etc.
401;my wife and I sat on the couch and starting watching.
402;She looked at me and asked why in the world I bought this movie.
403;If you go into it with this knowledge, you may give it a 3 star.
404;One of my favorite movies the casting was amazing totally got me and my wife into wine we can watch it over and over
405;Sideways was a 2004 sleeper comedy hit by director Alexander Payne that really deserved its plaudits.
406;He previously made the funny Reese Witherspoon comedy Election and the so.
407;life crises, as it celebrates human foibles in an intelligent manner.
408;It was adapted by Payne and Jim Taylor from an unpublished novel by a writer named Rex Pickett, and won a well deserved Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.
409;the film follows in a long tradition of buddy comedies, from the silent era, wherein one guy is a good fellow, and the other is his ne'er do well pal.
410;the film is a ray of hope for viewers who want intelligent films, especially comedies, from someone not named Woody Allen.
411;The video came in wrong viewing version, Widescreen versus full screen but was given a credit so the customer service was good.
412;It is in the style of Bridget Jones (the first one) .
413;The best man, Miles, thinks this is a good opportunity to introduce his friend to the fine art of oenology (wine tasting), especially since he will be marrying into a socially elite and rich family.
414;Part of it is the performances by Giamatti and Church, which are very good.
415;top, which allows the audience to relax and forgive them their foibles.
416;the women in the film are much more realistic and more subtle.
417;They provide the solid emotional grounding and realism that offsets the insanity revolving around the two guys.
418;There are poignant moments, but most of the time the film is humourous in its observations about the people, and the humour grows naturally from the characters and the inextricable logic they must follow once they get themselves into the situation they are in.
419;And we have spent a satisfying and fun 2 hours with the characters, without having been cheated by a cheap and artificially contrived grand resolution.
420;The audio commentary by the two stars is fun, if not particularly informative.
421;But it's fun to see them nonetheless.
422;This movie is witty, If you know wine, or if you don't the charcters are comical.
423;i would recommend this movie!
424;I initially saw Sideways at the movies and loved it.
425;They just seem to be enjoying the job of commenting on the movie and they really bring you along for that.
426;The movie is hilarious anyway, but the movie with them making talking points is beyond hilarious.
427;Some of the stuff they say about the ladies like Virginia Madsen are priceless.
428;This is now one of my favorite movie commentaries of all time.
429;Love, love this movie, but I love all Alexander Payne movies.
430;To come to the point, if you enjoy listening to tedious conversations about the characteristics of Californian wines by chauvinistic males, you will love this movie.
431;This is such a hilarious film.
432;Everyone in the cast was so funny.
433;Miles intentions for the week are quite clear: bond with his best friend over a few bottles of wine, forget about the demise of his marriage, relax from the pressures of trying to get his novel published, and hey!
434;sex, sex, sex, and more sex.
435;Jack meets an exotic local cashier at one of the winery stops and decides to temporarily put a halt to his impending nuptials much to Mile's chagrin.
436;Stephanie, played by the delightful Sandra Oh (Gray's Anatomy), is everything that Jack believes has been missing from his life.
437;She is a cross between Biker Barbie and a Wrecking Ball and she comes complete with a single friend, Maya, for Miles.
438;In one of the most poignant scenes, Miles and Maya go tte.
439;The writer's supply dialogue that is noteworthy and Madsen is more than apt to take up the challenge of giving the words, and movie, life.
440;Payne's last film, About Schmidt, continued his fascination with American cinema in the `70s by featuring one its biggest (and most prolific) stars, Jack Nicholson.
441;His latest movie, Sideways, continues the road movie motif from Schmidt and combines it with the buddy film.
442;tasting tour through California's Central Coast and squeeze in a bit of golfing as well.
443;And yet Payne is able to get a good amount of comedic mileage from the pair.
444;An interesting thing happens during the course of the movie.
445;fresh off the success of American Splendor, Paul Giamatti is one of those actors who makes it look so effortless as he inhabits the characters he plays completely.
446;Giamatti is able to tap into his character's deep reservoir of pain and anger and pull out an incredible performance that is, in some ways a variation of his take on the equally acerbic Harvey Pekar in Splendor.
447;Haden Church's deadpanned delivery of smart.
448;"Haden Church then proceeds to deflate this by delivering ironic statements like, ""Also, I love your head in this scene,"" in a deadpan style that is very funny."
449;But it has a good ending and the perform of Giannati is superb.
450;Great buddy picture of two flawed middle aged guys out for a good time.
451;Each in excess can be interesting.
452;Best if your a jaded viewer to enjoy this one.
453;But the film picked up and turned into a powerful portrait of the costs of friendship and the nature of hope.
454;There's an effective blend of pathos and humor.
455;A Top 10 favorite movies all time.
456;"Timeless and classic
457;The cast delivers in everyway.
458;One of my all time favorites.
459;It sounds like a relatively simple.
460;The soft focused reflections of the California sunshine is perfectly captured in context of the copious amount of footage of wine drinking and grapes.
461;This was a good and entertaining movie.
462;I think guys would like it more than women and it should give a lot of guys hope.
463;Both play their parts well, however Giamatti does such a good job and is very believable.
464;She would be the best thing that could ever happen to this guy.
465;I love seeing So. Cal showcased in movie.
466;I was drawn to the cute effervecent waitress, a girl next door lovely.
467;spirited, depressing, slice of life look at the human condition.
468;In fact for me it ranks with Ishtar, and Heaven's Gate.
469;well, here's the male version.
470;I thought this movie was amazing and was appauled that it did not sweep the oscars.
471;regardless though this film was just brilliant, touching and funny and just real all the way around.
472;I loved his charactor every minute he was on screen.
473;The film is simple, plot wise that is, but the meaning it carries about love and life and friendship and relationships and starting over and or moving on from the things and experiences that weigh you down is endlessly moving.
474;And I so so done with this film when the naked man comes running outside and presses his naked body against the car.
475;The artsy, deep, hip and high.
476;Sideways strangely has one of those cool quirky titles that sounds really hip and grabs your attention.
477;Like """"Entourage,"""" """"Purgatory,"""" """"Angel Eyes"""" and the like."""
478;And they're so true and worthy of it, we want them to find it and thus, assure we will find it ourselves.
479;successful actor who's most respected credit was a short.
480;Jack is living an ideal life otherwise and Miles has seen better days.
481;taking plenty of meds and alcohol himself, usually all at once.
482;And the movie illustrates how that's exactly who he is.
483;one of Miles' true passions that does bring him happiness in wine.
484;And with great wine, you have to know what you're talking about.
485;You treat it as an art, as yourself.
486;"He's eons ahead of Lowell and ""Wings."
487;He has a womanizer charm that doesn't seem lecherous or arrogant.
488;In fact, we encourage it.
489;And we're anxious to see how.
490;They wind up having a fast relationship and one of the most surprising moments comes when Miles realizes how fast their relationship is going.
491;She isn't just a hottie, she has a wild spirit we'd all want to get into.
492;"It's the kind of movie where you keep thinking, ""Yeah, this is life."
493;This is so exactly true to life.
494;right down to every last detail.
495;life way all about the fascination of human nature.
496;laughter, anger, frustration and brain candy.
497;And Payne not only directs beautifully and passionately, but manages to get the right feel in every frame.
498;"like most of the population who saw ""Sideways,"" I was relieved to see that the screenplay managed to walk off with nearly every honor for writing there was: The Oscar, the British Academy Award, the Golden Globe, the Independent Spirit Award, the New York Film Critic Circle Award."
499;And it's cast got it's props as well.
500;one of those rare and precious years where the Academy actually got it right.
501;nOTE: This review is dedicated in loving memory to my grandfather, Arthur Benzie.
502;A schoolteacher with a passion for the written word.
503;it all got to him in a big way.
504;Like Miles, he had a deep passion, an insight.
505;For the highbrow and the savory.
506;The man always appreciated a good drink.
507;hatred and is utterly endearing.
508;slapping, good looking hunk of a bit.
509;splitting humor and deeply human poignancy combine in this travel narrative.
510;I loved Paul Giamatti (Miles) in American Splendor, and he is every bit as good in this film.
511;This movie has received uniformly great reviews (a notable exception being one in the New York Times).
512;Definitely a dark comedy that has very funny moments and but neither of the two male characters are anything to empathize with but both Madsen and Oh play positive characters and they balance the film.
513;Oh offers the film energy along with Church and she has the most memorable moments in the film.
514;Funny grown up film that is dark but leaves a possibility of a positive ending.
515;But it is also rare that a movie evokes such raw emotion in me.
516;waiting for the funny part.
517;"now that's some funny humor"" was exactly what popped into my head."
518;"Jack's constant harping on ""c'mon, man!"
519;got real old real quick.
520;as though life and death depended on it was another example of the fine comedy writing in this movie.
521;still waiting for the funny parts.
522;At last, a mildly amusing moment.
523;OK, so I laughed when Jack was trying to fake a car accident because he needed an excuse to tell his dimwit bride to be for his broken nose, given to him by his woman scorned, and the car missed the tree.
524;The idiot deserved that one.
525;To think all of these years I thought Caddyshack was funny.
526;the acting, dialogue and script are absolutely superb, and the movie contains many memorable scenes and lines .
527;It should have won Best Picture this past year in my humble opinion.
528;First of all, this was the best movie of 2005.
529;Thirdly, as one of the better scripts out there, the writing was amazing.
530;i felt like an observer into real life.
531;this film was beautifully done and I think that a film like this comes out once every few years that is highly underrated and happens to be a masterpiece.
532;It's a rare film and a favorite.
533;These are interesting characters with a lot at stake.
534;Hilarious, informative, and it helps to keep us wine weenies in check a little by showing how we can be perceived by others.
535;Oh by the way, we started with Osso Anna, just do it!
536;"I think lots of people feel like this, including myself
537;I feel I have hope for people in general"
538;This becomes more than just a journey.
539;This is a journey of them finding themselves and why their lives are so dramatic.
540;Sideways proceeded to win several awards, including two Golden Globes and one Oscar.
541;headed humor with a dramatic twist.
542;This unique storyline combines love, reflection, and alcohol finely.
543;It contains the style that of old.
544;fashioned journey films and modernizes it with the alcohol hobbies.
545;This technique combines well with all of the themes and turn of events.
546;This allows the characters to have a motive to bond so well instead of just cause.
547;"Therefore, this comedy is not just an action comedy
548;thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen make terrific comebacks in this film in their Oscar and Golden Globe nominated roles (both supporting performances).
549;Not just did they make comebacks"
550;"Paul Giomatti proves his acting capabilities with the second consecutive outstanding performance in a film (the first being ""American Splender"")."
551;Though Sandra Oh didn't receive many award nominations for this film, she still gave great essence to it like her fellow cast members.
552;It will surely continue pleasing many audiences as it already has.
553;The first time without the commentary on so you can appreciate the terrific jazz score by Rolfe Kent that terrifically underscores the action on the screen.
554;This pair have infinite clever bon mots about the action on the screen and the making of the film.
555;In the process they learn about life, love, themselves, some of it painful, some of it wickedly hilarious.
556;"Director Alexander Payne with this film and his previous comic masterworks, ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"" continues to rise to the upper echelon of American filmmakers."
557;"We can thank him for advancing the careers here of Paul Giamatti, star of last year's brilliant ""American Splendor"", Thomas Haden Church, best known for his work in sitcoms, ""Wings"" and ""Ned and Stacey""."
558;Particular mention should be made of his utilization of Virginia Madsen as Maya, the waitress that captures the heart of Giamatti's character, Miles.
559;"be in Hollywood even though she delivered solid work in movies as diverse as the horror film ""Candyman"" and Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of John Grisham's ""The Rainmaker""."
560;Here's hoping the success of this film is a springboard for the careers of all those involved.
561;i thought that thomas haden church was funny in this movie.
562;The movie is great indeed.
563;I must said I was pleasantly surprised, and found it to be a highly intellectual film.
564;i found 80% of the script to be spot on, and very realistic.
565;But this storyteller did an outstanding job.
566;There are moments where the dialogue is outstanding.
567;Very intense and impressive performance.
568;Ok, well it takes place in California so anything is possible!What I find to be most impressive about this movie, is the fact that it is an accurate portrait of life in general.
569;It just so happens that a wild number of things occur in a few days in the film.
570;i do not consider this film to be a comedy, it has funny moments to be sure.
571;So if you want insight into your own life and how to relate that to others, then I think this film might offer you a gaze into that world.
572;"I sit here in my study surrounded by my Pinot and I think about how this movie shows that ""an interest in wine"" takes on a new and wholly significant meaning, centrally from the point of view of Maya and Miles."
573;It shouldn't have been funny, and yet I found myself laughing.
574;But there it is, its a pretty good film that I enjoyed in spite of myself (but please don't tell anyone).
575;Beautifully written, acted, directed and produced.
576;After 7 viewings our appreciation of this movie hasn't changed.
577;I am well read, cultured, eloquent, and affluent.
578;This was a great little heart.
579;warming picture, full of intelligence and grace, humor and pathos.
580;A classic road picture with two likable types who have nothing going for them.
581;We love them for this finally, as do the gals they meet on their wine.
582;The actors are very charming and fully realize their parts.
583;I especially liked Sandra Oh, who is passionate and intelligent.
584;The guys are fine, although I wonder about seeing a lot of them .
585;cultural in a way, slightly subversive of the call to success.
586;These kinds of film made my generation love going to the movies.
587;Sandra Oh has a great scene as Haden Church's weekend girlfriend.
588;Sideways is one of my favorite movies of all time.
589;Watching it is like hanging out with my two best friends.
590;I just feel totally comfortable hanging around with Miles and Jack.
591;I was despondent and anti.
592;I was dependent on them for my sense of identity and confidence.
593;i also really really relate to Jack, the actor from LA who is getting married in the movie.
594;I also relate to his love of and need for new women.
595;"confident and more of the ""lady."
596;The music is so perfect, the dialogue is so choice.
597;The scenery is refreshing looking and nice, and the acting by Sarah Oh and the other actress are so sensitive and spot on.
598;I hope everyone can enjoy this classic.
599;I really enjoyed this film.
600;I love the characters in this show, the way they stick their nose in the glass, look at the color, sip a little then spit it out.
601;I laughed all the way through this film, great acting, and story.
602;I thought it would be a very funny, oddball comedy.
603;"This film is one of those movies that are made for people that can understand the deeper meaning of certian subjects and Content, the movie is some what similar to ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zizzou"" and ""Lost in Translation"", Paul Giamatti to me is a alot like Bill Murray other than the fact the Mr. Murray has a bit more of a humorous side, Giamatti in my opinion is one of the most under."
604;rated actors of this decade.
605;"His performance in ""Cinnderella Man"" was oscar worthy as was his remarkable performance the the low."
606;"Though Jack is planning on getting married when he returns from their trip he hooks up with a young woman who Jack says is quote ""Nasty, Nasty, Nasty!"
607;the cinamatography is absolutly stunning, the humor is uncanny, the acting is flawless and the dialouge, direction and screenplay are all exceptional, though the movie can be slow to some with small attention spands and others who have to have either non.
608;stop action or constant humor, I thought it was very good and would recommend it to most.
609;This film is enjoyable and often funny, but also somewhat predictable.
610;sandra Oh, in the smallest part of the four, steals the show with her luminous, sexy, no.
611;Ironically, Jack's ignorance keeps the tone light and saves the movie from its own snobbishness.
612;this film is worth watching for the performances as it is more character.
613;As long as you don't expect too much, you'll enjoy this film that melds male bonding with romantic comedy, thus appealing to both genders.
614;In many movies this kind of incident is a set.
615;the central character is pretty clearly an alcoholic, and one can understand from his phone call to his former wife that his over.
616;His friend has problems with a sex drive that needs therapy and all sorts of problems with honesty and trustworthiness.
617;I was a little surprised to see this billed as a comedy.
618;And it is a whole lot funnier than most movies that are supposed to be comedies.
619;It is a buddy movie.
620;It is a brilliant tour de force by Alexander Payne, who along with Jim Taylor wrote the script, and who directed, based on the novel by Rex Pickett.
621;On the basis of seeing two of his movies, this and Election (1999) I can say without the slightest doubt, Payne is one very talented man who has Hollywood by the proverbials.
622;both the script and the direction were superb.
623;One might say Payne spent a little too much time developing character, but when you see the result, you have to say, it was worth it.
624;He also reminds me of someone.
625;miles recently (two years ago actually) got dumped by the true love of his life, his now ex.
626;"And Jack, bless his heart, is about to marry a very well appointed and very nice looking young woman who lives in a grand house in Palos Verdes (in the script
627;This movie hit home with me.
628;I mean, I have been to France and I have drunk Chateau Cheval Blanc, and to be honest I have also drunk great burgundies with (God help us) fast food, although unlike Miles I took the food home"
629;in other words, the movie is realistic, so much so that I suspect a lot of viewers will find something in it that relates directly and even spookily to their own lives.
630;Can a movie be so absolutely true to life that it.
631;But the movie is so well planned, so well contrived (if you will) so aggressively true to life and honest about human nature that I came within a hair breath of turning it off.
632;It is craftily planned to reward the viewer with a most interesting and enjoyable movie experience.
633;in addition to a brilliant script and some very fine direction from Payne, the movie is blessed with some excellent casting.
634;Paul Giamatti is perfect as Miles, who really is not a loser.
635;Thomas Haden Church is exactly right as the attractive and confident, every.
636;Sandra Oh provides a perfect fit as the Asian.
637;i guess I could give Hollywood the ultimate compliment and say that this movie is so slick that it doesn't seem in the slightest bit slick.
638;That it is so realistic that one never thinks for a moment that it is contrived.
639;To paraphrase somebody, the essence of the art of story, whether it be a novel, a short story or a movie, is in believable characters in believable situations doing the things we all do, but in a way that goes beyond realism to artistry.
640;If you can fake that you can make it big not only in Hollywood but anywhere there is an audience, a viewer, a reader, anybody who seeks to be enlightened and entertained and experience the catharsis that art can bring.
641;see this for director Alexander Payne who knows what he is doing at all times.
642;I love a smart, well written, quirky movie.
643;It had potential, with great actors, a good , but overused premise (getting married this weekend so I want to party with my buddy and get ____.)
644;geek theme got old very early on.
645;This film has been called 'quirky' and 'smart'.
646;Is it me or does Paul Giamatti always deliver?
647;It's fitting that like fine wine, you may have to watch this movie more than once to fully savor its richness.
648;Her performance opens your mind to the world of wine tasting and how, like tattoos, it's a very personal and individual experience for all of us.
649;Of course, the zany, madcap events of the boys last hoorah helps move things along too.
650;It's funny how relationships shape and direct our lives.
651;With an outstanding ensemble cast, this film treats wine and relationships with humor, warmth, and reality.
652;If so, he's a great actor, because the viewer comes away despising the guy.
653;"On the positive side, ""Sideways"" is a pleasure to watch for Giamatti's and Virginia Madsen's (Maya) performances."
654;These are characters we can like, and they have true chemistry.
655;Church and Sandra Oh (Stephanie) are also very good, but I would have liked more screen time for Oh's character, and more exploration of the lives of Maya and Stephanie.
656;nominated, and I look forward to more of his work.
657;he is divorced and still in love with his ex.
658;He has two things, which sustain him: his love of wine and his love of his old college buddy Jack (Thomas Haden Church).
659;Miles' love of wine is the vehicle by which his buddy finds his first date.
660;And Miles himself finds company with a local waitress who shares his passion.
661;She even likes his book which Miles describes as some kind of `Robbe.
662;The film makes a strong attempt in developing the characterisation of the players although the women come across as stereotypical.
663;no, this isn't a `wine' movie but it's an entertaining comedy which is worth the price of a cinema ticket.
664;I like films with plow.
665;So y did I give it 5 stars.
666;It has its moments, Sandra Oh is great and should have gotten far more, but the match between the male and female leads was unlikely and strained.
667;fargo that won a lot of awards and was a real stinker!
668;There was some hope for one in the end, and several amusing situations, but these did not redeem the film in my opinion.
669;Pound for pound, Giamatti is the best actor around.
670;"He stole the show in Private Parts
671;The movie focuses on friendship, wine and the simple joy of life(and how elusive this can be).
672;it works on the big screen and on the small one in your bedroom.
673;It works as a date movie and as a solitary adventure.
674;With humor and sadness, Sideways tracks two men on a last tango in Napa as they guzzle the grape extract, golf and find love and romance.
675;The majestic California wine country is a lovely backdrop . . . but Sidways looks inward at regret and the unruly journey to true love.
676;ray we still watch it when it airs on TV.
677;I love the acting by all the characters in this film and someday I hope to visit some of the towns and wineries featured in the movie.
678;This is one for all the fans of Paul Giamatti.
679;Rather a ' boys adventure ' with beautiful scenery and a few healthy guffaws as we watch the misadventures of Miles and Jack all wrapped up with a nice and tidy predictable Hollywood ending.
680;Miles, played by the remarkable Paul Giammatti, portraying a teacher/writer ( unpublished at that! )
681;Its not a character that deserves much empathy from the viewer but it is one in which we can, at one time or another, certainly identify with.
682;If not then you have most definitely lead a charmed life!
683;For most men it might the love of a good woman.
684;but he also finds solace and comfort in his one true passion.
685;what truly, for me at least, turned this film from being simply good to arguably a great movie experience is that as """" Sideways """" developes we unknowlingly turn a sympathetic eye toward Miles and ultimately by the end of the movie are cheering him on and crossing our fingers for our very own 'happy ending.'"""
686;What director Alexander Payne does so effectively is to let his characters develope at their very own pace, knowing full well that as more and more of Miles character is revealed the audience will begin to understand and empathize with his faults and liabilities.
687;going experience our lives will be enriched ten.
688;Some truly inspired comedic moments i. e. Jack and Miles purposefully wrecking Miles car so as to help convince Jacks soon.
689;"Its moments like these that makes "" Sideways "" a movie that like a fine bottle of wine ( and no Merlot please! )"
690;superb, brought back nice memories of wine country.
691;packaged perfectly, timely, no issues of any kind.
692;For us adventure lovers, these are the movies I pass on.
693;From his first scene in Sideways, Alexander Payne's masterfully structured coming.
694;For Jack, an actor whose greatest success occurred years ago with a recognizable commercial voiceover and engaged to a woman he does not love, life is a series of compromises.
695;But their combination of masochism and hedonism makes for one compelling symbiotic relationship.
696;One of the more gorgeous scenes in the film involve Maya's initial seduction of Miles as both metaphorically talk about the qualities of wine, when in reality describe themselves.
697;"One of the most impressive feats in Sideways is Payne's sense of economy
698;as solid an ensemble piece as this is, it is Giamatti's tour.
699;force that is the film's crowning achievement.
700;As Miles, his deft work and attention to detail creates a real person, rather than a showy performance.
701;Most films stick to celebrating the beautiful people, life's winners"
702;Sideways forces us to watch them.
703;When the engaged playboy gets what's coming to him, it is both funny and satisfying.
704;What I experienced was anything but.
705;Good acting, fairly good comedy, mediocre story line.
706;OH yeah it would have.
707;"I guess the saving grace is seeing the Asian woman, and imagining the ""freaky"" activities going on behind closed doors."

709;This is the most thoroughly misogynistic movie I've ever had the misfortune to see!

715;But the execution of this plot is full of shrewd observations and so many delightfully unexpected scenes that seem like non.
716;sequiturs at first but somehow mesh into a story that keeps you guessing what will come next.
717;It's a fascinating journey, often hysterical, sometimes painful, about lost opportunities and facing one's deep.
718;the characters are familiar and unpredictable at the same time, and the actors inhabiting them are terrific.
719;In a relatively understated, finely detailed performance, Paul Giamatti provides the emotional core of the story as put.

721;the two actors have an easy and sometimes tense rapport as best friends with opposite approaches to life but a strong sense of devotion to each other.
722;Their wine tasting scenes with a liberal use of jargon, in particular, are hilarious in that only.
723;And it's gratifying to see Virginia Madsen make the most of a good role.
724;This beautiful, searingly intelligent actress had been kicking around bad potboilers and horror flicks for over two decades, and it's about time someone saved her from Lifetime TV.

730;Those who work in the wine industry know about the meritage of the featured Pinot including Merlot, but aside from that piece of trivia the fact is, Merlot is a great varietal.
731;It just got too popular, so this movie takes a cheap shot to make fun of it, and all of the people who enjoy it.
732;Everyone in this movie did a great job acting.
733;I just loved the friendship between Miles and Jack.
734;Because of this movie, I read the book and I think this is the rare occasion where the movie is actually better than the book.
735;, try this refreshing gem.
736;Fact: Alexander Payne is one of America's most exciting filmmakers.
737;Not because he delivers slick, cobalt.
738;"Making these people interesting is one thing
739;It's quite a feat .
740;One scene in particular strikes you hard: while clumsily, reluctantly attempting to seduce waitress and fellow vinophile Maya (an excellent, back.

746;But it has a story, and the dialogue is fabulous, quirky, and very funny.
747;if you tend to like French cinema, you'll surely love Sideways, so go for it.
748;Some people liked this film, others didn't.
749;It' a rich narrative, a road trip through a golden landscape.
750;A film that makes you laugh.
751;Sideways is a really good fun, funny movie.
752;This movie was/is wildly popular because its a mirror image of much of white America.
753;So in 2005 I was primed to empathize with their cathartic journey of middle.
754;the plot is pretty straightforward.
755;such as fine dining and stimulating conversation over a good pinot noir.
756;the four main actors are uniformly excellent.
757;Paul Giamatti brings a sharp pathos to Miles, and Thomas Haden Church embodies Jack as a likeable but selfish aging lothario.
758;As for the ladies, Virginia Madsen's Maya is a lovely, intelligent woman with a great palate who is a bit out of Miles' league, and Sandra Oh's Stephanie is sexy, sassy, and vulnerable to Jack's seductive charisma.
759;For me, Giamatti's performance is especially poignant, since he perfectly embodies the solitary, yearning existence of a middle.
760;Based on my own life, I could tell that Miles had plenty of practice making the best of solitude.
761;They have a natural chemistry, and their banter really shines.
762;The intriguing insights they provide are leavened with plenty of self.
763;deprecating humor (almost as funny as the movie itself), with just enough trivia to leave one wanting more.
764;I certainly would've enjoyed their perspective on the proceedings.

768;The acting was good, the emotions were there but it wasn't comedic acting.
769;It was cute, but not worthy of all the praise.
770;It came highly recommended by a freiend who previously has recommended some great movies (i. e. Sexy Beast and Cedar Rapids both get thumbs up).
771;he is laughing for getting me to watch it.
772;This movie is packed full of shock moments.
773;But on the way they encounter two females that will send their lives into an interesting turn.
774;But Miles, the character we sympathize with, is obssesed with wine . . . and writing.
775;I am so happy nobody will ever make me watch this movie again.
776;I laughed out loud many times and usually with tears (this occurred in both the film and the book.
777;but the book is superior by far).
778;Giamatti and Church are wondrous together, a true comedy match.
779;The movie is desperately pathetic, which of course is what makes it so humorous.
780;Call me crazy, but I really do see this scenario as very 'true to life.
781;Of the hundreds of books I have read in my life time, this one, by far, was the most fun.

787;Since I study film, and this film received great reviews including a 96% Rotten Tomatoes rating, I had to watch it .
788;It's an excellent ensemble film, in which wine isn't much more than a pretense for the story, which in many ways follows a pattern of other good stories featuring one uptight guy and one looser.
789;The writers received an Academy Award for their excellent work and deserved it.
790;The acting was excellent as well, and the characters are appealing.

799;This brief and wonderful moment made the whole film worth watching for me or perhaps it's the one bright thing that I have taken away from this movie and held onto inside.
800;funny film (I think it was supposed to be a comedy) but it tries too hard to be about 'real life' that it seems more movie.
801;in that respect, I feel Citizen Ruth is his best film.
802;It's the greatest movie about the art of appreciating wine that I have ever seen.
803;Sure there's a lot more going on but that's what I found most successful about it.
804;Its characters taste wine, drink it, talk about it, travel in the Wine Country, California and learn about the birth, growing and maturing of this almost living thing.
805;"Most inspirational and moving monologues are dedicated to the ancient but forever young child of Sun, Air, Earth and Grape

807;This film feels like a fine wine.
808;The perfect combination of hilarity and bitter.
809;sweetness, humor and drama, depressing realizations about life and hope make """"Sideways' one of the best films of that year for me."""
810;It is the best of three Alexander Payne's films I've seen.
811;I love this movie .
812;the characters are indelible, the casting is amazing, and the script is a classic.
813;Overall a good movie .
814;Very good movie to have a glass or two of wine while watching.
815;Tolbert has it right, this film is over.
816;I did manage to stay awake, just to see if it ever ends.
817;I'll come back an add on to this if it ever does.
818;there is one excellent sight.
819;That is sheer Laurel and Hardy at their peak .
820;the jazzy soundtrack isn't quite as good, IMHO, as some reviewers might have you believe, but it lends a very light touch to the film.

955;after leaving the theater back in november when i first saw it, i knew that i had just saw the best film of 2004, hands down.
956;and it still is a masterpiece of new millenuim filmmaking in my opinion.
957;Sideways is at once a quirky comedy, and a moving, sometimes painful, drama about two men approaching middle.

970;Maya, a wise and sensitive woman, who is studying horticulture at the local university, understands.
971;Her response, a wonderfully poetic monologue about what wine means to her, is mesmerizing.
972;This gem of a scene is one of my favorites in the film.

976;This is definitely a 5 Star film, nuanced, complex, with fabulous depth, seductive and not too fruity!

983;"I loved Giamatti in ""Private Parts"", and wished I had stayed home and watched that again."
984;Take some happy pills before you watch this, to keep from slitting your wrists half way through.
985;The film itself is great!
986;Great cast with a great story of a mid.

988;the friend is blustery, claims to be blissfully happy with his impending marriage and is delighted to take off on the tour.

990;That scene is immensely satisfying to every woman in the audience, so stay with it, even when you are becoming very impatient with the characters.
991;Talk about getting your just deserts!I hated this movie until this scene and then I loved it!
992;Good entertainment, wine lovers appreciate the comedy in this movie!
993;It's one I have seen many times, so likely you'll want to own it!
994;the primary focus of the movie was on Paul Giamatti, and wine tasting.

997;traveled, and I have made a serious study of wine.
998;It had a few funny moments, here and there, that's about it.
999;The final scene is at least hopeful .
1000;probably the best scene in the movie.
1001;The film won an Oscar for screen writing adaptation from a novel.
1002;This movie is simply a gem.
1003;I agree with the previous review mentioning that 20.
1004;Nevertheless, it is poignant through the use of humor and gives one a few things to think about in terms of life choices.
1005;Giamatti had one or two funny moments, just because he plays a good oaf.
1006;I loved it then, as did everyone I ever met at the time who saw it.
1007;Even a big home tv screen and a few friends together will make it fun.
1008;We liked it, but I have to say not as much as I thought we would.
1009;(My friend had never seen it and I kept telling him how much he was going to love this movie.
1010;This movie is thought provoking and has very good character studies.
1011;My husband and I loved this movie!
1012;We saw subtle humor throughout the entire movie.
1013;is one of the funniest lines of 2005.
1014;Sideways has a lot going for it.
1015;Great acting, especially on the part of Paul Giamatti, realistic characters, and a very interesting subplot involving California wines and those who immerse themselves in them .
1016;Predictably, this means that the groom.
1017;Studying wine makes up for the great hole in his emotional life.
1018;The mismatch between the temperament and aspirations of these two men is what many find charming about the film.
1019;Still, the film was well done, if not the laff.
1020;riot it is thought to be.
1021;* The scenery in the wine country of Southern California is beautiful, as are the restaurants the characters visit and Stephanie's rural home.
1022;* Maya seemed like such a sympathetic character, plowing through Miles' book even though she barely knew him, and Jack, though a rogue himself, has Miles' best interests at heart, helping Miles and Maya get together.
1023;you may just find it immensely watchable.
1024;The movie is about friendship, love, obsession, and existential angst.
1025;The acting and casting are excellent: Giamatti, Church, Madsen and Oh are all very good.
1026;The story is bittersweet, but the movie has some very funny scenes.
1027;The movie is literate and intelligent.
1028;The movie gives me insight into an obsession and a world of which I am not familiar.
1029;The movie works in part, because the characters seem to enjoy each others company.
1030;The commentary by Church and Giammatti is funny, but not very poignant.
1031;They really enjoyed making the movie and they have an enjoyable self.
1032;This unlikely duo, Miles and Jack, sets out to enjoy the last days of Jack's bachelorhood.
1033;Jack's character is a caricature of the glory.
1034;"bound hunk of yesteryear
1035;There are some funny, moments .
1036;and touching scenes of life, love, and treachery.
1037;I liked this film well enough the first time around, but after a second viewing a year later, I've become somewhat fascinated by it.
1038;Also, the backdrop of California's vineyards is wonderful.
1039;At the end of this film I quite enjoyed it and for many reasons.
1040;My point is that Sideways is a great movie and nothing more.
1041;I found myself forgetting he was acting.
1042;Thomas Haden Church offers a very nice contrast by playing what appears to be a two.
1043;the story is simple and focuses more on character development.
1044;It is easy to connect with each of the main characters.
1045;If you can't relate to them personally, they remind you of a family member or close friend.
1046;as the film amply does with smart, sharp and pungent dialogue .
1047;the film is a full.
1048;Sideways is an evocative film about male friendship, relationships, flings, marriage, careers, the approach of middle age, settling instead of realizing your true dreams, and, of course, wine.
1049;Wine is a character, a driving force in this film.
1050;The movie explores their friendship and their attempts at relationships with women.
1051;This is a powerful drama with some very comedic scenes interspersed (including the discussion of whether committing suicide with further Giamatti's novel, and the scene in which a naked cuckholded husband chases down the pair, beating on their car).
1052;It is well cast, and exquisitly executed.
1053;Loved it when I first saw it on the screen.
1054;what you do get from this movie is excellent characters.
1055;I think a lot of people have friends that are like Jack.
1056;the dialogue is witty and sarcastic sometimes to the point of being outright hilarious.
1057;Granted it may take a special kind of humor to understand why some things are funny.
1058;I mean no way was this the funniest movie of the year.
1059;He still has some heart felt moments and has great chemestry with Virginia Madsen (Candyman).
1060;It's good but it reminded me a lot of Alexander Payne's last film About Schmidt.
1061;i have liked this director's work in the past, especially Election.
1062;i love wine, and I love to taste wine"
1063;as far as performances, cinematography and direction go.
1064;the movie is like a well.
1065;Virginia Madsen should have won an Academy Award for her performance as Maya.
1066;The story itself is great (which is more than I can say for the novel) as is the final, ambiguous, fantastic shot.
1067;There is absolutely nothing worth listening to on this feature.
1068;I liked so much about this movie.
1069;And I also really appreciate the excellent videography and nice shots of California countryside.
1070;this has nothing to do with cinematography, politics, performances, or direction.
1071;what I can't understand is who give positive reviews to movies like this.
1072;Unless you are in the recreation of psychopath's life as a moral lesson, the content of the character matters.
1073;Thanks for letting me vent.
1074;I enjoy a good pinot noir, but it's a young, lighter wine.
1075;No big story, just a very smart piece of script writing and performance and in my book, great writing beats an explosion and a super hero costume every single time.
1076;This is one of those movies and its got the kind of funny that life really does offer.
1077;This is one of the best films made in the history of cinema.
1078;Miles and Jack are the quintessential buddy.
1079;Their adventures in wine country are so much more about just wine drinking: they screw up, they bicker, they do ostensibly immoral things, but there's something so human about them, so real that our hearts go out to them.
1080;This is such an extraordinary film, an anomaly really in the world of George Lucas and video gaming and WWF smackdown.
1081;This movie is a riot on so many levels.
1082;Thomas Church plays his character so well.
1083;i love the central theme of the movie.
1084;This will become an iconic movie and it will be watched over and over because it is great.
1085;"Oscar winner Payne has a sure hand in ""Sideways,"" and a unique way of blending comedy and poignant storytelling."
1086;Sideways explores the darker side of character development and the importance of a good wine!
1087;Yes, the essence of wine as a metaphor of the lives we lead, our hopes for the future and our struggles, occassionally, to glimpse the light in our lives through the haze.
1088;Anyone searching for a strong character driven movie with a sense of humour and an extraordinary insight into the human experience will be delighted with this quirky, yet endearing story that is .
1089;Miles, a schoolteacher and aspiring novelist, is precise and enjoys a good Pinot Noir.
1090;it's true that opposites attract, and former college roommates Miles and Jack have managed to remain friends despite their extreme differences.
1091;like all of Payne and Taylor's films, Sideways takes us on a journey of self.
1092;reflection, a celluloid mirror that totally captures the honesty and reality of the characters and situations.
1093;Even when the characters stray off the beaten path, it proves advantageous to all concerned.
1094;Instead of a movie about two best friends who come to blows over wine and women, we are treated to an engrossing analysis of the fragile state of the human psyche.
1095;works novel, afraid with every ring of the phone comes rejection.
1096;sideways is as unexpected as it is unique.
1097;I love that the filmmakers never feel compelled to reduce them or their feelings to convenient plot devices.
1098;Sideways is much smarter than that, and is one of the best films of the year.
1099;This movie is a slice of life, superbly drawn.
1100;i started, then, to love it.
1101;It's a great road trip/buddy movie.
1102;but the performances throughout are wonderful, and the two leads play off each other perfectly.
1103;it's a wonderful actor's movie.
1104;"Giamatti and Church play off each other like a comfortable old team
1105;the commentary track on the movie features Giamatti and Church.
1106;It's pretty much just a riff on the movie without much actual insight or information, but amusing in it's way.
1107;I really enjoyed this movie, even more the second time I saw it.
1108;The first time, in the theater, I had the impression that it was a good movie, but not a great one.
1109;It's still not a GREAT film, but it certainly is an excellent story.
1110;There also aren't a lot of two person (technically) films that can hold your interest.
1111;I even listen to it in the car, as it makes a wonderful driving soundtrack.
1112;my favorite aspect of this movie is getting to watch it with people who have never seen it, so I can remember what it was like for me to see some of my favorite scenes for the first time.
1113;It helps that I myself am a lot like Paul's character, and I have a friend very much like Thomas's character (albeit not quite as manipulative).
1114;it's also a very good wine movie.
1115;I must confess that I did pick up more than my share of bottles after watching the movie, because Paul G. does such a great job of describing the details of Pinot.
1116;the commentary track is absolutely wonderful to listen to.
1117;The two main actors, Paul and Thomas, work just as well off camera as on.
1118;I know that some people think that this movie is slow but this film, at least to me, is absolutely hilarious and so true to life.
1119;And, for the record, it was another film that made me happy to be a lesbian.
1120;this movie made me laugh so much, and i wish for the people who didnt like it, to give it a rewatch.
1121;Side ways rides you through California Wine States panoramic roads, fine dinning restaurants and mainly through the souls of young adults, man and woman, stressed by day by day living who find an scape inside botles of good and rare wines.
1122;Yses the best American movie for years.
1123;make a date with Sideways.
1124;make a datewith the best of yourself.
1125;The man about to get married goes to have fun before he gets married.
1126;Sex, laughs and fat chicks and men making well making and a wallet.
1127;However the film is quite easy to watch and the sadness is its beauty.
1128;realistic portrayals of actual people we know in life, perhaps even ourselves.
1129;the film is absolutely hilarious and the characters are so wonderful that the saddness that does pervade the movie is cleansed with great hope.
1130;This film really reminded me of some of those fantastic greek tragedies we all read in college.
1131;this is a must watch film.
1132;It's a really funny movie and we love it.
1133;and in my opinion, more entertaining than the film itself.
1134;his best friend, the woman he supposedly loves.
1135;Will watch more than once.
1136;Good acting, fun situations, interestingtake on wine and California wine country.
1137;Paul Giamatti (one of my favorite actors) absolutely shines in this movie.
1138;I've watched this movie multiple times, and I keep discovering new nuances in the faces of Thomas Haden Church and Paul Giamatti.
1139;For me, it's the misty rolling green backdrop and the true of the color of sun .
1140;that made this film work so well for me.
1141;Dreaming is what this movie is all about, along with great lines and great acting.
1142;The other three play their roles with absolute perfection.
1143;Bring a sense of humor and your love for wanderlust, and this movie will not steer you wrong.
1144;When it came to town I was really anxious to see what many reviewers commented in the papers: that it was a great movie.
1145;well, they are interesting to watch!
1146;It's quite another to have such vivid demonstrations.
1147;this was the most highest acclaimed film last year which gave me reason to watch this film.
1148;what I liked about the movie was the easy flow of narration combined with some excellent acting from the actors.
1149;I wasn't expecting to like this movie when I saw it in the theater, but I was won over by the great acting, comic timing, realism, and general good.
1150;Basically, it's a good old.
1151;with a lot of humor.
1152;Parts of this film are very slapstick.y, but I admit I laughed a lot.
1153;I had looked forward to this movie with relish, liking very much past performances of the 4 leads.
1154;a simple, yet dynamic story with great characters and themes!Loved this movie!
1155;I STILL love this movie!
1156;It's hysterical and the funny thing about Paul screaming I'm NOT drinking any f. g merlot!
1157;Still one of the funniest, well written movies ever!
1158;Beautifully filmed and never a dull moment, it's a modern classic.
1159;And everyone has known Thomas Hayden Church's character.
1160;This has to be the most overrated film I've ever seen in my life!
1161;It's filled with great actors, but the two main characters are incredibly unlikeable.
1162;As for this film's """"comedy"""" classification, I thought comedies were supposed to make you laugh."""
1163;It will truly touch your heart in many ways, especially with laughter and awe.
1164;my wife and i collect wine and we put off seeing it in the theaters because we wanted to watch it with a good bottle of pinot noir and savor them both.
1165;"we also very much enjoyed ""about schmidt"" and ""election""."
1166;"My favorite is the frequent description of the main character as a ""looser."""
1167;"Alexander Payne's wonderful, Academy Award winning film, ""Sideways"" is a mixture of two types of comedy genres, the 'road picture' and the 'buddy picture'."
1168;Both these genres mesh together perfectly to create both big laughs and some sobering reflections about how people live their lives.
1169;Romantic sparks fly and entanglements occur, that produce humor, hidden truths, and self.
1170;"the Academy Award winning Script (""2005 Best writing, Adapted Screenplay"") by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor is both witty, funny and emotionally moving."
1171;They have created interesting characters, who you just want to listen to and find out more about.
1172;In one of the most memorable scenes of the film, Miles is describing Pinot Noir grapes (his favorite) but eventually you realize he's actually talking about himself.
1173;Maya's response to his description is just as good.
1174;The scene is almost poetic.
1175;the cast in this film is just first rate.
1176;Virginia Madsen (who was nominated) plays the Maya character with a special vitality and sexiness, that the role requires.
1177;She makes it believable, that this bright, sexy woman could fall for this sad.
1178;Thomas Haden Church (also nomimnated) and Sandra Oh are very funny in their indespensible roles.
1179;i also want to mention how much this film does work as a road picture.
1180;Both the locations and the beautiful cinematography (By Phedon Papamichael) just hold your interest and make wish you were there!
1181;You will unknowingly be humming along with it.
1182;This is a wonderfully, funny and moving film, that has some interesting characters.
1183;This is my favorite movie!
1184;I've seen it at least 4 times and I enjoy it just the same every time.
1185;It's been a while since I've seen a movie that feels so real on all levels.
1186;I laughed out loud several times, and not always at the obvious spots.
1187;The movie works because it remains real and true to itself.
1188;The wine tasting dialogue is hilarious .
1189;look on his face is simply priceless.
1190;It works, thanks to the contrast of his costars' comparatively lively, even hedonistic, yet no less self.
1191;Together, they create an engaging story which exceeds the sum of its parts, loping sideways into the future.
1192;I loved the book, and Miles was not such a sad sack loser as portrayed in the movie.
1193;He was funnier than Jack!
1194;miles returns to the apartment while being aware that he is behind schedule, as he has over slept.
1195;The reason for this expedition is Jack's upcoming wedding, as they have decided that Jack should enjoy freedom before marriage one final time.
1196;One striking notion is how Jack could be friends with Miles, as Jack is the polar opposite of Miles.
1197;Jack has a career and options to try new things while being a positive, strong, and confident man who seems to have it all.
1198;After all Miles is the key for Jack to be able to be himself .
1199;in regards to his new family and wife to be.
1200;Later, in the film, more of Jack's two.
1201;Jack's career as an actor truly seems to be self.
1202;As an interesting side note, Conundrum is also the name of the publishing company that might publish Miles book.
1203;words such as vibrantly alive and authentic come to mind when listening to what the two main characters say.
1204;This is due to a brilliantly adapted screen play by Alexander Payne who co. wrote the screenplay with Jim Taylor, which originates from a novel by Rex Pickett.
1205;Ultimately, Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church's character contrasts makes the film very absorbing while providing performances of the highest level.
1206;This leaves the audience with an authentic tale of existence, hope, and love, which makes it ok to dream while also trying to work toward those dreams.
1207;A great movie, great characters and a well told story.
1208;I have seen it many times but recently introduced it to a family member after a wine tasting.
1209;Nothing new, but did new great things with universal themes: hurt, loss, depression, loose cannon friends, and most importantly.
1210;if you really like movies, you'll like this film.
1211;written and beautifully acted by all four main characters.
1212;esteem, to self absorbed for a man, main character.
1213;The best part of the movie is when Sandra Oh gives the best friend a beat.
1214;Well, I'm proud to say that he couldn't have been more wrong, I absolutely love this movie.
1215;well, ever maybe, I'd love to see them do the Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder thing.
1216;deprecating commentary track alone is worth the price of the disc.
1217;it must be the funniest and most entertaining commentary track I've heard in years.
1218;The disc is region free, by the way.
1219;Paul Giamatti (who was wrongly snubbed for an Oscar nomination for Best Actor) is impressive in a performance that is the highlight of the career.
1220;Alexander Payne's directing is excellent!
1221;I knew from the advertisements that it wouldnt be a blockbuster.
1222;the first time I saw this a couple of years ago, I thought it was interesting.
1223;On one hand, you have the hang.
1224;rate actor who fancies himself a ladies' man.
1225;another duality is that Miles is well.
1226;Then there is the beautiful and flirtatious Stephanie, winningly portayed by Sandra Oh, who at least comes away with her dignity intact after her dalliance with and subsequent revenge on the smarmy Jack.
1227;Probably the best part is that the wine novice can actually learn SOMETHING about wine while smirking at some of the wine world's sillier affectations.
1228;Solid cast, quirky characters, beautiful setting and really the birth of Pinot Noir interest in the Santa Barbara Area.
1229;The movie introduces CA's well.
1230;known wine regions with lots of comedy.
1231;I enjoyed the movie tremendously and made notes of the wine areas to visit at a later time.
1232;It spends endless amounts of time talking about wine, sounding very mature and intellectual, when at its heart this is another buddy comedy.
1233;"The choice of wine is one that appeals to ""couples""."
1234;It bothers me so much reading all these high.
1235;brow sounding reviews that I had to write about it.
1236;Most buddy films like this one .
1237;are viewed as two and a half star films.
1238;this one, for whatever reason, was given far more consideration by the Hollywood establishment and was nominated for an Oscar for best picture.
1239;whatever the case, there is nothing outstanding in this movie except for one funny scene crashing a car.
1240;There were some nice scenes and a couple that were funny, but this is a two and a half star film.
1241;It is absurd to think this film so magnificent is ranks in league with the greatest films ever made.
1242;One of the best movies of last year!
1243;I have watched it a dozen times and could easily watch it a dozen more!
1244;There is good acting .
1245;Virginia Madsen was great .
1246;"As Jack says: ""All I know is that I'm an actor."
1247;His idea of instinct is living any lie that fits the moment.
1248;they did a great job with their characters.
1249;Sideways is a time tested soon to be a classic.
1250;It is a great flick.
1251;Sideways has to be one of the top ten male.
1252;the protagonists are 1)Jack: a empathy.
1253;confidence who's only able to muster a hint of fortitude after he's put away a couple of bottles of Pinot.

1255;wife tells Miles she's pregnant and his world comes crashing down.
1256;He drinks it alone in a fast food joint from paper bag.
1257;"How lame is that!The take away message:Women = cool, intelligent, compassionate, ""together,"" self."
1258;reading this, just for the sheer hilarity of it.
1259;Again, this book was made into an equally hilarious movie (with the advantage of some memorable sight gags).
1260;There is additionalcontent (both hilarious and bizarre ) in the book that was not in the movie.
1261;Curl up with a good Pinot and enjoy.
1262;a fun and poignant read.
1263;This movie is a perfect date night movie for a few laughs, lots of talk about wine, and thoughts about hoping neither one does something dumb.
1264;A great movie to cuddle up to with your loved one and drink some wine.
1265;Not the most feel good movie, but cute enough to enjoy this bachelor weekend duos ride of ups and down through wine country.
1266;The association is tenuous at best.
1267;Interesting enough to want to watch the movie again?
1268;Interesting enough to recommend this movie?
1269;"Director Alexander Payne (""Election,"" ""About Schmidt"") manhandles well the terrain of the lonely loser."
1270;popcorn moment, and yet it never feels unbelievable.
1271;Miles, as played by Paul Giamatti in the wonderfully understated film, is an Everynerd who started out with a semblance of promise and somehow got off track, oh, a decade or so ago.
1272;His idea of a good time is retiring with a glass of pinot noir and the latest issue of Barely Legal.
1273;Jack's getting married in a week, an event he's approaching with the ambivalence unique to an aging pretty boy: He knows his skirt.
1274;"The pinot grape, Miles tells Maya, ""needs constant care and attention. . . ."
1275;"Replies Maya: ""A bottle of wine is constantly alive, evolving, until it peaks."
1276;It is a lovely moment until, that is, Miles breaks the spell.
1277;It rambles along at its own good.
1278;The film's a welcome ramble.
1279;Giamatti, as demonstrated in his attention.

1282;Forces of Nature is one of the movies about making it home for a wedding.
1283;The movie was boring, and I can't understand anyone liking this movie, but they do, and got good reviews.
1284;I was looking forward to seeing it since all the interviews with the actors made it seem like a great film.
1285;And I did enjoy it, but I thought it was a little long winded.
1286;This movie has good people in actors and actresses roles.
1287;winning movie in the theater.
1288;It may be worth seeing just for the shock value.
1289;that said, all of the main actors give wonderfully believable performances and the wine country setting is very engaging.
1290;hyped, though the acting was very good.
1291;I remain confounded as to why so many people are saying it is such a funny movie.
1292;These people should watch the news more often, to see what the President is doing to our country .
1293;Adopting a superior tone simply because you think this was a superior film simply shows how thin and weak your argument really is.
1294;Readers will have to take my word for it, but I am well.
1295;read / educated / traveled, and also really love wine, and I'm telling you this film is nothing special.
1296;it's just a damn movie!
1297;The movie by itself, is 5 star: funny, and well made.
1298;The entire cast is great.
1299;there were maybe three good scenes in the movie.
1300;Sideways is a comedy of the unpredictable roads of life.
1301;tasting trip and end up finding laughter, women, and fine wine.
1302;Jack is celebrating his final days as a bachelor, and Miles is his tour guide of sorts, a man who knows and enjoys fine wine.
1303;spirited women (Viginia Madsen and Sandra Oh), and fabulous fun happens.
1304;Also, a realization that each day opens with opportunity and a chance to start over.
1305;There is also fine wine to enjoy and savor like life itself.
1306;This is a roadtrip examining character and hope as well as the ups and downs of everyman's life.
1307;although slow, overall the film is worth watching for some smiles, and interesting insights.
1308;'Sideways' was a wonderfully written film.
1309;It's funny, offensive, and touching at the same time.
1310;The characters have a reality to them that you rarely see in films nowadays.
1311;what I've noticed in a lot of user reviews, is surprisement in reaction to some of the characters actions.
1312;they do and say things that many would find inappropriate, but it really works in this film.
1313;everybody wins kind of movie, which I think alot of people were expecting.
1314;It has a dark humor to it, along with a wonderful emtional depth to it that seems real.
1315;Miles is a true wine connoisseur, and, following his divorce, wine seems to be the only thing about which he can truly be excited.
1316;this film effectively has two stars .
1317;In this film's best moments, wine is employed as a character.
1318;miles's favorite wine, Pinot Noir, functions as a metaphor for his own personality.
1319;In describing why he loved his ex.
1320;wife, he speaks fondly of her palate.
1321;He is at times melancholy, at others frustrated, at others just plain drunk, and his journey is perfectly, and frequently humorously, set against the lush beauty of California wine country.
1322;Sideways if offbeat and fun.
1323;I laughed at the antics and direction of the movie.
1324;I'll let it be a surprise and worth seeing:)
1325;The acting is masterful, Sandra Oh is delectable and the scenery is.
1326;what sets this movie up for a special place in my heart is one great wine joke.
1327;At the very end of the movie, Miles decides to drink the one great bottle of wine that he's been saving for ' a special occasion'.
1328;At the risk of sounding like a cheap, sensationalistic tagline, this movie is quirky, kinky, decadent, and just plain perversely funny in a jaded and downbeat sort of way.
1329;brow humor which the movie has its share of.
1330;The subject of wine becomes a metaphor for several of the other themes in the movie, including unpredictability of relationships and life in general, and even the misadventures that befall the two main characters' during their week.
1331;another thing I enjoyed about it, which is more of a personal nostalgia thing, is that I've visited many of the places in the movie, including Buelton, Solvang, Sanford Winery, The Hitching Post Steakhouse, and others, and it was fun to watch the film and recognize so many of them from my past travels.
1332;Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church as the pair of old college buddies were perfect in their roles and did a wonderful job of acting.
1333;I think they played off each other well enough so that I hope the director does a sequel or at least another film with both of them in the lead roles.
1334;although not a film for everybody's taste I enjoyed its skewed and downbeat humor and slant on life and I look forward to seeing what this director does in the future.
1335;also, if you haven't seen Love Serenade but enjoyed this movie, I can recommend that one also.
1336;miles thinks he is going to introduce his friend into marriage with a tour of the wine country and some golf.
1337;i would have given the movie three stars instead of four, but the acting is superb in this movie.
1338;Paul Giamatti is at his best.
1339;written script, well edited for timing and flow.
1340;Everything about this movie is just great.
1341;Totally entertaining from start to finish.
1342;Two polar opposite friends personalitywise, go on a week long wine tasting trip , making for one of the best 'buddy movies' ever made.
1343;But it's satisfying on deeper levels too.
1344;The situations those guys are in, nearly scene by scene, are things alot of middle aged folks can relate too and the comic interplay between Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church is just perfect.
1345;The beautiful wine country backdrops give the movie such a unique 'California cool' vibe too and also the laid back , cool jazz music from the very 1st scene at Miles apartment.
1346;The movie is so well done, from the screenplay to the character development to the plot.
1347;An excellent movie that is only marginally about wine.
1348;but the movie by Alexander Payne is more about what we can do with ourselves and our lives with the hand we are dealt at birth and by chance.
1349;looking but deep thinking fellow who is deeply passionate about what he loves, be it his lost ex.
1350;But it is the Jacks of the world who have more fun: not so deep, not so careful, just happy go lucky types.
1351;The last scene of the movie leaves a door open to hope however: while Jack sinks unenthusiastically into his marriage, Miles finds the true love of his life.
1352;And the few good stretches of wine.
1353;"and ""Motorcycle Diaries,"" and I got it with this film."
1354;heroes, and that's just so refreshing.
1355;Their adventures are comic, poignant, absurd, but feel so real for some reason.
1356;That's what makes him so great.
1357;A terrific movie in all ways.
1358;There's not much story, but that's what's amazing about the film: it moves of its own volition.
1359;Movies have become so formulaic, this film is like a tonic water, a breath of fresh air.
1360;Giamatti and Church are amazing.
1361;But, what a great film, one for the ages, one time will bear out as a minor masterpiece.
1362;Unlike most movies, this rewarded a second viewing.
1363;Good music, nice scenery, quirky characters.
1364;See R. g. White's review for more detail.
1365;About the only good thing I can say is that I received it as a gift and didn't spend my own money on it.
1366;"Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church star in Alexander Payne's wise film, ""Sideways""."
1367;Despite all this, Miles seems an honestly good.
1368;jack is now engaged, and Paul wants them to have a final bachelor's week in California wine country.
1369;without being preachy, the movie provides a stark contrast between Jack, who is interested in having as much hot sweaty bedroom encounters as possible, and Miles, who is dumpy and middle.
1370;there are no moments when I laughed my head off, but the clever screenplay made me chuckle appreciatively every couple of minutes.
1371;These people and their dialogue seemed very real and familiar.
1372;by the end you hope Jack will have learned a lesson of sorts, and you hope for good things for Miles and Maya.
1373;Sideways is an entertaining but vastly overrated film about the pleasures of life and wine.
1374;rate cast deliver good, but not extraordinary performances in this tale about two men reaching middle age with not much to show but disappointment, who embark on a week long road trip through California's wine country, just as one is about to take a trip down the altar.
1375;if anyone in this film deserved an Oscar nomination it was Paul Giamatti, a terrific actor always overlooked by the Academy for his brilliant turns in independent cinema.
1376;the screenplay, written by director Alexander Payne (Sandra Oh's husband) and Jim Taylor, from the novel by Rex Pickett, is a twist on the conventional romantic comedy.
1377;One of its most wonderful qualities is that all four characters are necessary.
1378;Perhaps I have to see it again to truly appreciate it, but I just feel this was a really good film for the romantic comedy genre and nothing more.
1379;I recommend it yes, but beware, it is one of the most overrated films of the year, if not ever.
1380;see this movie because it is entertaining, not because you've heard it's a masterpiece and you'll come out enjoying it.
1381;Miles, just looks forward to the getaway and some extended time with his best friend.
1382;Maya, a recently divorced waitress, is happy to see Miles.
1383;There are a few funny moments and more than a few sad ones.
1384;This is actually a very serious movie about depression, loneliness, and eventually hope for a new beginning.
1385;Definitely very well worth watching!
1386;Delivered quickly and in excellent condition.
1387;I had been told that this was a good movie and I am glad that I obtained this movie and enjoyed watching it.
1388;This was a great addition to my collection.
1389;I was very pleased with the quickness of my order, and it arrived in the condition stated online.
1390;Was it the only way they could afford the great wine??
1391;Crazy adventures occur on the trip involving infidelity, love, and above all lots of wine.
1392;Giamatti's character in this movie has some similarities to the one in American Splendor, but Miles is more of a funny loser because he is prone to hissy fits, alcoholic silliness, and general nervousness around women.
1393;The intelligent yet insecure character of Miles plays a good foil to that of Jack, the cool, convident ladies' man who is just looking to have some fun before he gets married.
1394;The characters' friendship works well in the movie and enlights many instances of humor.
1395;this movie also includes contrasts between romances: a semi.
1396;tender, and a fling between Jack and Stephanie (Sandra Oh) that is mainly for pleasure.
1397;But this is a good movie and I would recommend watching it.
1398;It successfully splices together elements of humor and romance, which makes it both funny and touching.
1399;Probably one of the best Guy movies about life and romance (heartbreak and all that goes along with that).
1400;Refreshing to see a romantic movie from the perspective of the American man.
1401;great writing, excellent acting (Paul Giamatti is fantastic), and great direction.
1402;Makes me want to head out to California and hit up the places that were in the movie!If you're a guy (or a woman, haha) this is a great movie to see the ups and downs from romantic love.
1403;Sideways is an exceptionally fine comedy/drama for adults.
1404;life crisis in full swing.
1405;Just before the nuptials, the guys take a road trip together to California's wine country.
1406;Giamatti and Church are excellent.
1407;Sideways is about equal parts drama and comedy, but it may be remembered more as a comedy because it contains many truly funny scenes.
1408;The movie remains true to itself right up to the ending, which is hopeful rather than happy.
1409;Both are entertaining, but really underwhelming and underwritten movies created for a niche audience.
1410;I really enjoyed the feature commentary by Giamatti and Haden Church .
1411;They sound like really nice people .
1412;Haden Chruch especially sounds like a vastly underrated actor.
1413;women seem to like this movie less than men and sometimes it gets quite vitriolic comments but for me, it has been the best movie of the last couple years.
1414;Certainly not full house, and I was the one laughing most but I've seen it four times since and I just keep loving it.
1415;I really enjoyed this movie a lot.
1416;The acting was very good, a dynamic and intelligent script, great camera direction and so much more.
1417;This movie is about two men who are still coming of age and despite their adult years still have much learning and growing up to do.
1418;Clearly he has much growing up to do and maybe he thinks once he sows his wild oats he will finally be able to marry and commit to one lady.
1419;He is a sympathetic character which is what i like about him.
1420;I had forgotten how hilarious and funny this was.
1421;Paul Giamaitti is outstanding, and Alexander Payne is one of a kind director.
1422;From an entertainment perspective it was ok at best.
1423;"make ""Sideways"" a good movie about the pitfalls of approaching middle age."
1424;dog jerk, and both are terrific at making a mess of their lives.
1425;The movie's logic gets a little wobbly during a madcap caper but it's in keeping with the rest of the movie's humor, which arises out of situations and not at the expense of character.
1426;I love the actors and actresses in this movie, and they played their chracters very well, but the script flowed like molasses and the ending of the movie left you in the same place where you start .
1427;Sideways is truly a gem in an era where moviemakers are obsessed with period pieces, blockbusters, and gimmicky dramas.
1428;It boasts realistic characters with real problems, and touches on the nature and meaning of friendship, romance, betrayal, etc.
1429;The movie relies on the stunning beauty of southern California's wine region and the natural but undeniable appeal of its four leads, not computer generated effects and flavor.
1430;The result is a deeply touching but hilarious masterpiece.
1431;Paul Giamatti has mastered the frumpy, angry white male but injects so much pathos and irony that he's always fun to watch.
1432;Sandra Oh is effective with the few lines she has, but it is wonderful to see an Asian actor portray a character who could be of any ethnicity, white, black, or whatever!
1433;I loved the fact that there was no explanation about why she and her mother and daughter were not the same race!
1434;regardless, this was THE star making performance of the year.
1435;some may think the movie moves along too slowly, but I say enjoy it and its wonderful pace.
1436;It's a quiet film that will stay with you a lot longer than the blockbusters.
1437;This movie has a great soundtrack, scenery, acting, direction, screenplay, etc., etc., and in no way deserves 3.1/2 stars.
1438;Should have won more Oscars.
1439;"I must say, out of all the 50 some odd films I've seen in theaters this year
1440;this was definitely Thomas Haden Church's best performance to date.
1441;He was absolutely hilarious and insanely lovable in """"Sideways""""."""
1442;And if you're not familiar with Paul Giamatti (American Splendor) then you should know he's a funny, intelligent and thought.
1443;"together, Giamatti and Church play Miles and Jack
1444;filled, yet serious journey"
1445;Which both actresses were also very excellent in this film.
1446;if you're at all interested in this smart, fun.
1447;filled movie that shows the pros and cons of life.
1448;I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
1449;The absolute best scene in the movie is when Sandra Oh beats the ever.
1450;Sideways makes clever comparisons between wine and people, and the film explores how individuals and couples evolve over time.
1451;This is a very simple movie, but it's definitely one of the best films I've seen in a while.
1452;Watch this movie as soon as you can!
1453;Sideways is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
1454;"Buddy movies are sometimes mindless, but this is more of an ""intellectual"" buddy movie."
1455;For those who have recently been to Wine Country (as I have), it is a must.
1456;see, as it makes you just want to go right back to the vineyards of California.
1457;Tensions flare, comedy insues and a bunch of wine is consumed in this hilarious and dramatic independent film directed by About Schmidt and Election director Alexander Payne.
1458;Giamatti and Haden Church give two performances that are simply outstanding and are among one of their best.
1459;Madsen is simply gorgeous as ever (Virginia Madsen is sister of actor Michael Madsen) and Sandra Oh is hot and spicy.
1460;thanks Sideways (2 thumbs up).
1461;Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor one Oscar for best original screenplay.
1462;It also one a lot of Independent Spirit Awards.
1463;"I think of such ""buddy"" films of the past, the best of them from the 1970s (e. g., ""Scarecrow"" with Al Pacino and Gene Hackman
1464;I give Sideways"""" two stars only because it had done a fine job of capturing and reflecting the bucolic beauty of California's largely still."""
1465;which would have, I think, resulted in a more believable and interesting movie.
1466;Movies hold most of their value in entertainment and their ability to transport us to places we've never been and to distract us from our problems if only for two hours.
1467;I didn't have high expectations at all about this film at the outset, but it turned out to be truly a great film.
1468;I was afraid that the wine tasting theme might be a bit too artistic and esoteric, but the wine theme is perfect to set up the characters and plot.
1469;This film is so convincing.
1470;The actors and actresses in this film all did a superb job and created a reality that is so memorable.
1471;There are so many films, but so few really great ones like this.
1472;They make it look so easy.
1473;I had already made up in my mind that I loved this movie based on all the reviews I heard from critics and ordinary moviegoers alike.
1474;and I normally love chick flicks .
1475;one bright spot was Sandra oh .
1476;"So it is remarkable that ""Sideways"" even came about."
1477;"But what makes ""Sideways"" so brilliant is that it does not play to the audience."
1478;This feels like a film that was made for someone instead of just a mass of people to make money and it is in that compassion that a great film was made.
1479;the writing is top notch.
1480;Laced with humor, depression, akwardness, hopelessness AND hope the characters are driven to each other.
1481;these characters are wonderfully written and the actors know this.
1482;Virginia Madsen's monologue about wine is extremely touching and and some of the best writing seen in a while and by far the best delivered moment in the film.
1483;this is a prime example of having all the right elements together at the right time.
1484;The chemistry between the direction, writing, cinematography and acting were completely in tune with each other and the result was something magical.
1485;"I have seen SIDEWAYS twice
1486;It is a film that grows on you"
1487;SIDEWAYS is one of the best films of the year or maybe the decade.
1488;This is always an Enjoyable Movie to Watch.
1489;A great cast of characters and an Adult theme fun movie.
1490;OK, first, you have an ensemble cast of four, with supporting characters.
1491;"When it comes to Madsen and Oh, it's basically ""smart women, foolish choices."
1492;Mix in breathtaking scenery of the SoCal wine country and a lite.
1493;jazz soundtrack and you see that one person's five star film is another person's one star film.
1494;if you like the film, great.
1495;To me, these are 3 of the greatest acting performances of the last few years.
1496;Giamatti's performance is subtle but his range of expression and emotion is incredible.
1497;There are no flaws in his acting and he's so good in the role that you believe entirely that he is the character Miles.
1498;I don't usually gush but this is one of those actors whose films you watch for his performance alone.
1499;All I will say is that Sideways is a special movie with truly GREAT acting and several moving moments that will mesmerize you.
1500;I understand that it is about the 2 guys and there journey to self realization.
1501;"Sideways is a ""dramedy"" based on the novel of the same name by Rex Pickett."
1502;There is more drama than comedy, though, as middle.
1503;He wants to sow his wild oats before plunging into matrimony, and he thinks Miles should do the same.
1504;And Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who pours wine at vineyard and likes adventure as much as Jack.
1505;"Oenophiles will probably enjoy ""Sideways"" for the passion it expresses for wine."
1506;The story revolves around the men, but Maya and Stephanie are more interesting characters.
1507;Sideways is a solid adaptation, but 2 hours of characters who are essentially annoying wears on the audience, even if what they do is amusing.
1508;"Director Alexander Payne followed up his 2002 masterpiece ""About Schmidt"" (starring Jack Nicholson) with this fine 2004 film ""Sideways""."
1509;"Like the three previous movies Payne has directed himself, the screenplay for ""Sideways"" was written by him and Jim Taylor."
1510;there are many positive aspects to this movie.
1511;Payne and Taylor once again demonstrate their incredible knack for rich dialogue, as well as sly and occasionally over.
1512;It's great to see former Wings star Thomas Haden Church get a role that he can really go to town with.
1513;Virginia Madsen is also wonderful, delivering a sensitive and tender performance.
1514;Sideways does work very well as a comedy, but overall, it's not a full.
1515;like I said before, her performance here is terrific, and at the end of the movie, it just feels like we haven't seen quite enough of her.
1516;"if you love ""About Schmidt"" and ""Election"", ""Sideways"" is a must see."
1517;It's a very good film, but it feels like Payne kind of bit off more than he could chew this time around, and as entertaining and funny as the film is, it leaves one feeling a little unsatisfied when it's over.
1518;The best part of this film was the wine, and the scenes filmed in wine country.
1519;In addition, Paul Giamatti's character is odd, unpredicatable and entertaining.
1520;it has alot of funny moments but I wish the film had have jump started a bit more quicker.
1521;personally I like wine and having fun, so my personal opinion is that the movie was great.
1522;loathing animals, that's what they are.
1523;This is a hilarious movie.
1524;Yes, I love wine, but even more, I love the atmosphere that surrounds a wine tasting trip that can turn into an adventure, which can change you life, as in this story.
1525;IF for no other reason, see this movie just to fall in love with Virginia Madsen, her description of why she loves wine is priceless and will give you some understanding of why true wine lovers share a slower pace of life, a sense of history, and a passion for living, besides.
1526;it taste so F___ing good.
1527;minus the giddy silliness and likable characters.
1528;Lacking in grace, intelligence, or worth.
1529;It is set in my home town and takes me home when I watch it.
1530;independent movie and all the critics are raving that Paul Giamatti is an incredible actor and deserving of awards for his great ability in this picture.
1531;considering all the great reviews, I watched it.
1532;He did his role just fine but it was a simple role.
1533;"this is another one of those ""it's of higher."
1534;"value because it's (psuedo) independent""."
1535;I finally got a chance to see this film last night and while I found the story amusing, it wasn't nearly as good as I expected it to be.
1536;The humor is very subtle and will likely put a smile on your face rather than making you laugh for all to hear.
1537;The acting by the two leads is really good, even if the characters are totally unlikable.
1538;on the old tyme radio shows like The Jack and Benny Show!
1539;this is friendship and humor?
1540;And, Miles covers for Jack and crashes his own car in order to develop a believable alibi for Jack's broken nose.
1541;In my life I've known each one of these characters, even dated some.
1542;He got right into the skin of this complex character!Jack.
1543;Always the Big Lie when it comes to women.
1544;Young women should watch this movie to see guys like this in action.
1545;But this movie does have a happy ending and Miles' life did make a turn because he got the backbone to grab for happiness instead of dwelling on his past failures.
1546;Everytime I watch it, I see more deeply into the characters.
1547;That's great writing and movie making!
1548;Honestly, I enjoy a variety of movie genres, and I can usually find at least one thing I like about a movie .
1549;What is so entertaining about a looser and his jack ass friend carousing for a week?
1550;charles Krauthammer, the conservative political columnist, praised this movie as being highly intelligent.
1551;The movie is so intelligent that it demands that you be intelligent too.
1552;To enjoy this movie you will need to be understanding of people, both in the sense of caring about people and knowing them.
1553;This movie proves that sometimes we do laugh to keep from crying.
1554;There were a couple funny moments but not enough to hold my interest.
1555;This is definetly a Love it/Hate it movie.
1556;okay, first of all, the reasons I like the movie:1.
1557;The acting is really superb.2.
1558;The whole movie is about Men lying to women, yet these are people you know.
1559;The dialogue is great, and the Dry humor is just about perfect.
1560;This is a good movie!
1561;I've always been a fan of Virginia Madsen and she shines in this movie.
1562;Forgive me for not knowing her name, but she really knows how to beat up a guy with a purse.
1563;Its a movie, and a very good and funny one.
1564;i really wanted to enjoy this.
1565;Really a great movie, something about this movie makes it more real than most movies, the characters actually have flaws, they're more human than most films, that's adds a whole new dynamic that I'm not used to seeing.
1566;This movie is funny, sad, happy it's got everything and it's not dumbed down for the average Michael.
1567;The plot has already been summarized by other reviewers, so I will just say how much I loved and still love this film.
1568;One thing that prompted me to say so, was the surprising strong divide among reviews here.
1569;It is an ironic pairing and they are a bit of an odd couple.
1570;But the performances are brilliant.
1571;church's character's immaturity, his performance is ripe!
1572;All the performances are brilliant and it's just a pleasure to watch over and over again.
1573;I saw SIDEWAYS before all the hype and thoroughly enjoyed it.
1574;especially the reemergence of Virginia Madsen and a memorable performance by Thomas Haden Church.
1575;It's a pretty, witty little movie about interesting albeit unlikeable folks who love drinking wine as much as I do.
1576;"deleted scenes and a fun commentary track will bring the movie ""back down to earth"" for you."
1577;Haden Church, particularly, is incredibly honest and clever in his commentary.
1578;there's a real genius and comic timing you wouldn't expect.
1579;Hopefully, the attention and accolades he garnered for this role will allow him to showcase more of his talents in the future.
1580;Well take a look at Sideways and you get a snapshot.
1581;The calamitous opening scenes give us the plot,,two guys going on a stag weekend to the wine growing area of Southern California.
1582;the film is beautifully shot and is evocative of a long gone image of the 'California Dreamin' generation.
1583;We are given a broad canvass and it captures a great deal, this film is a feast of images, ideas and stimulating suggestions.
1584;soaked portrayal of Californian life leaves us feeling fascinated by lives that are not ours, but what we may have beenor what may yet happen should we follow 'the dream' .
1585;but I understand that they had to cut a lot of things out to keep the film to a decent running time.
1586;this film has plenty going for it: a fine cast, a great and complimentary soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, awesome location, and a clever script.
1587;He has a great sparring partner in Thomas Harden Church, who plays an extroverted, womanizing lout with a diminishing acting career.
1588;The scenes between Paul and Virginia Madsen are the best in the film.
1589;as their dialogue about life and using wine as a metaphor represents a cool style of flirtation.
1590;She's brilliant and the best thing about this film.
1591;Because of that scene, I couldn't recommend this film to many people I'd otherwise recommend it to (their sensibilities would not find much humor in it).
1592;it was a good film.
1593;It is so much better and you'll gain a fuller appreciation for the characters.
1594;"Plus, the film made some changes in the beginning and the ending, as well as changing Stephanie from the novel's character of ""Terra""."
1595;and get ready for a belly full of laughs!
1596;Sideways is a buddy film where a bachelor week to wine country in Northern California allows two good friends to enjoy some time away from the city.
1597;Their adventures and misadventures are entertaining, yet it is the unveiling of their true demeanour and the direction they take with their lives that gives the viewer a lot to enjoy.
1598;This movie is a gem, and much has been written about the content of it.
1599;"One of my favorite Giamatti comments is when he calls Haden Church a ""young Lee Marvin."
1600;In some ways it's a metaphor for modern America .
1601;This is a wonderful film.
1602;Everything about it is excellent.
1603;The writing, the cinematography, the music, and the especially the acting performances.
1604;One of the best performances I've ever seen from any actor in any movie.
1605;I will enjoy this movie many more times.
1606;A true work of art never gets old.
1607;the cinematography in this film was absolutely beautiful, with magnificent sweeping pans of the California countryside.
1608;It was passionate and interesting.
1609;He did a great job in Sideways.
1610;What I liked best about Miles was that he was a contradictory character, like so many of us are.
1611;He did bad things, like steal money from his mother and lie to his best friend, but he was also capable of great loyalty, self.
1612;I also liked the way that, although the story didn't end with everything tied up in a nice bow, you definitely felt that Miles was going to be all right, that he was going to make it just fine.
1613;Sometimes all people need is one person who really gives a hoot about them.
1614;Sure there are only two blokes at the party and the beer kegs have been replaced by pinot noir, but those classic themes of friendship and loyalty are lurking under the surface.
1615;miles (Paul Giamatti) is a middle.
1616;as best man, Miles, decides that a tour of California's wine country and an introduction to the finer things in life is the perfect wedding gift for his best friend.
1617;Jack on the other hand sees the trip as his one last gasp of sexual freedom.
1618;be avoids his fiance's calls and convinces himself he is in love with his fling.
1619;both Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh are fantastic as the sassy and intelligent women that become entangled in the lives of Jack and Miles, although in reality it's hard to imagine women like them ending up with guys like these.
1620;It was a very introspective piece.
1621;she is now one of my favorite actresses and I hope to see her in more things.
1622;The warm tones and stylistic visuals of the vinyards will give you the free feel of driving through the valley yourself.
1623;although Sideways may not be as side splitting as you might hope it's a delightful introspective of a friendship that is preparing to be changed forever.
1624;I love a good merlot.
1625;Miles, somehow when you're not looking, steals your heart.
1626;Miles is a complex man whose grief, sorrow, and regret keeps the audience emotionally invested.
1627;Paul Giamatti was definitely robbed of an Oscar nomination, however, it was year of great male performances.
1628;The lines are memorable and fun to repeat.
1629;So I actually enjoy reading the 1 star reviews knowing I'm not a member of that crowd that just doesn't get it.
1630;And their points will be valid (for them).
1631;Wonderful movie about the wine country in Solvang and Los Olivos, great acting, very enjoyable, can watch it over and over.
1632;If you have ever been to wine country you'll enjoy seeing this over and over.
1633;I love a film that dares to show the complexity and dark side of life for a couple of relatively normal people.
1634;THe photography is beautiful and creative.
1635;A great effort all around.
1636;"Giamatti should definitely have won an Oscar, if only for the ""big scene"" with Virginia."
1637;somethings in our modern society.
1638;"They drift through life working sporadic ""careers"" while telling themselves that their true callings are really something more meaningful."
1639;"_The film starts out with our two ""heroes"" heading of for a weekend of wine tasting and golf."
1640;I know that sounds funny, but it turns painful.
1641;_I primarily enjoyed this film because of its shining accuracy in depicting so many of the people I see around me.
1642;I have a big suspicion that the haters of this really good comedy did not watch the whole thing, otherwise they would have mentioned in the last half of the movie:1.
1643;a. kind wedding rings in it.
1644;Watching the fat guy run BUCK NAKED towards the car and down the street with his manhood swinging in the wind is hilarious!
1645;The characters are refreshingly deep and well drawn, so rare nowdays.
1646;"jack would get found in the saddle by his new wife and be divorced because Jack is a ""men are pigs"" type guy and he knows he is."
1647;He is what he is and always will be.
1648;miles will have a happy marriage and kids and WILL publish a book someday.
1649;"I love this movie and it's not about wine
1650;The Bottom Line:One of the more successful blends of laughs and pathos to come out of Hollywood in the last few years, Sideways lures viewers in with its (very funny) comedy and leaves them with its suprisingly.
1651;Great romantic comedy centered around """"Wine Country"""" in Sonoma."""
1652;I was surprised that this video got some good reviews.
1653;In my opinion it lacked humor and the occasional scene that tried to be funny was so tied up with over the top sex that the humor died.
1654;The girls in that magazine are posed to look like they are the age of his students.
1655;He is something of a middle aged Charlie Brown.
1656;Sideways is not for everyone but I loved this movie.
1657;As you watch you see Miles go through an emotional roller coaster ride as he deals with Jack who is almost his polar opposite, tries to get over his ex wife and looks for something positive to hope for in the future as he indulges in the last thing he truly enjoys which is drinking good wine.
1658;the Good: The acting all around was great.
1659;Paul Giamatti was absolutely perfect for the Miles character and Thomas Haden Church was a perfect to play off of Gimatti's Miles and the character dynamic between the 2 was great.
1660;the score for this movie was superbly done.
1661;The music perfectly accents Miles and his moods and feelings.
1662;With the combination of Gimatti's acting and the score I felt like I knew exactly what was going on in Miles' head.
1663;I want to watch a movie and, if it's a comedy, I want to laugh.
1664;A bittersweet, but ultimately very satisfying comedy, Sideways boasted some of the best performances of the year in a story set in the beautiful California wine country.
1665;the characters dont have to be likeable for the film to succeed , but what they say has to be believable.
1666;and on this front the film succeeeds brilliantly.
1667;alexander Payne has composed his best film to date and hopefully ushered in a new era of adult themed films.
1668;I like movies where the characters are trivial in a way, completely believable, exactly like people we know, doing things that are mundane yet exciting.
1669;Sideways fits all these bills and that's pretty much why it is one of the best films I've seen lately.
1670;This is all fine and dandy, except Jack is not only looking for the first chance of getting laid, he's also trying to get Miles laid too.
1671;"Miles and Jack could be you and me while the girls they met are perfect examples of the proverbial ""girls next door""."
1672;if you like independent movies that feature interesting yet ordinary characters and are heavily based upon dialogue, then this film is definitely for you.
1673;The surprise factor is important and the fun is all in unraveling the adventures these two guys come across.
1674;I laughed more the second time, though.
1675;This movie was done with a self.
1676;Most movies, in order to be entertaining, resort to extreme unrealism.
1677;The characters are incredibly beautiful and rich with fabulous possessions or incredibly poor and yet noble.
1678;Given these constraints one can still hope for a movie that makes us laugh, that tells us things about the human condition, and that makes us more sympathetic to the foibles of our friends and familes.
1679;Sideways delivers on those hopes.
1680;It is a great achievement.
1681;Certainly the best movie of 2004.
1682;It should have won Best Picture but Million Dollar Baby got there instead by having a sympathetic character become paralyzed and then die.
1683;This is NOT intelligent comedy.
1684;"or ""I just stole from my mom!"
1685;"or how about ""I just punched a guy in the face!"""
1686;WIMP finally get the courage to visit the wine girl.
1687;Obviously subtle and deep treatment of real human emotions in a film is beyond your ability to grasp.
1688;go to a Vin Diesel marathon and leave the good movies to the intellectually able.
1689;if you enjoy wine and a good story this is for you.
1690;Very disappointing movie and I'm even more disappointed with its success.
1691;Alexander Payne's Sideways is a very funny, but deep movie about two friends, Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church), who travel up to wine country for a weeklong bachelor party for Jack.
1692;All four lead actors are excellent, but Mr. Giamatti is the heart and soul of the film.
1693;Other than that, Sideways is an excellent film.
1694;Mr. Payne's Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar is well deserved as the dialogue is funny, thought.
1695;I found nothing redeeming about this movie.
1696;The acting in this film is incredible.
1697;This film is not for anyone who thinks special effects, chase scenes, sex, or well known movie stars make a great movie.
1698;These people are very real, they don't do anything spectacular, like real people they have moments where they are doing just what they want to do, without any sense of how its affecting someone else, and other moments when they need to be everything they are, but just can't quite get there.
1699;It's filled with amazing dialogue and alot of really funny moments.
1700;Awesome movie, makes me want to take a trip to California and visit the vineyards.
1701;This is a movie you can watch over and over again.
1702;This is very good, but it is NOT an action movie.
1703;It is somewhat of a middle.
1704;crisis for single/divorced people, but entertaining.
1705;The kind of thing that is just messed up enough that it has to be true.
1706;I watched it because it won an Oscar for something, I don't even know what.
1707;Anyway, I wasn't expecting anything all that much but I was very impressed on how the movie kept coming at me with more and more to offer.
1708;"roommate is out to have fun
1709;there's a lot of funny things that take place in the movie.
1710;I was really touched by the relationship that developed with our bumbling hero.
1711;so many laughs and a bit of anguish led me to conclude that Hollywood can still do it.
1712;The best scene in the movie is when Sandra Oh clobbers the philandering and.
1713;Sideways won an Academy Award for best Adaptation.
1714;Giamatti is a very fine actor.
1715;I have always envied characters like Miles"
1716;"this is not a movie about wine but everything about it revolves around it, and just like any good vintage its separate components create a masterful movie, where everything fits
1717;From earlier reviews, you'd think this was a hilarious movie.
1718;Quirky, a bit dark, funny, sad, great acting, a strong cast and good dialogue.
1719;Sideways strikes me as a film that makes a big impact the year it comes out.
1720;I love wine and I love the California wine regions, including the Central Coast where """"Sideways"""" takes place."""
1721;"the landscapes looked as beautiful as in some of the shots in ""Elvira Madigan"" from the 60's."
1722;poetic thoughts to share on wine?
1723;p. s. It's a well.
1724;I just loved this movie.
1725;The acting was great and the script was faithful to Rex Pickett's novel.
1726;I enjoyed the movie and have watched it a couple times.
1727;Some really funny scenes .
1728;How incredibly uplifting it is to view another genius film by director Alexander Payne.
1729;"Payne, whose earlier films include, ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"" were darkly humorous, and about people who look at themselves as losers and failures."
1730;Sideways is no exception, and Payne has done an excellent job on creating a film (such as his previous works) that do not have much complexity to the characters, which in turn, ends up making them very complex.
1731;His best friend since college, Jack played by Thomas Haden Church, is about to get married.
1732;The trip is of more interest to Miles, as he is very wine savvy.
1733;It is quite clear that both Jack and Miles are complete opposites as Miles is quiet and introspective, while Jack is very outgoing and fun loving.
1734;The movie continues with Jack and Miles up and down experiences and eventually finding themselves.
1735;"it is very clear after watching ""Sideways"" in addition to Payne's previous films, he consistently provides concentration to the small details of everyday life, and places the characters in realistic settings so the audience can associate and relate."
1736;The dialogue is very natural and sincere, as every conversation sounds like something you would have with one of your friends.
1737;As a result, the film feels very genuine and comforting and forces you to identify.
1738;Sideways has a good balance of drama and comedy in addition to an excellent jazz score that heightens the film.
1739;Payne also does an excellent job of directing the flow and pace, in addition to strategic comedic timing, makes the lengthy movie feel like it is just as long as it needs to be.
1740;"cheek humor is very clever, so if you are drawn more towards a comedy such as ""Old School"" versus ""Rushmore"", you may not enjoy this movie."
1741;This will often turn off mainstream audiences that may take it for face value.
1742;I strongly recommend this film, as it is easily Payne's best film and one of my all time favorites.
1743;They call it such a wonderful indie movie, such a great look at vineyards and winemaking, but I tell you, that is not true.
1744;Miles, his best friend, is constantly moping about his failed marriage and crappy novel.
1745;"sighted director of ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt,"" always treats his characters' flaws with compassion, and his latest keenly observed comedy is the most humanistic yet."
1746;"With ""Sideways,"" he has crafted a sublime variation on the buddy road movie, infusing the midlife crises of the two main protagonists with hope and poetry."
1747;screen this year, each brought to life by a top.

1751;"miles, still sulking and pining two years after his divorce (""She had the best palate of any woman I've known""), can look achingly forlorn, but he is also capable of exploding into funny."
1752;be to the beautiful Santa Ynez Valley on a weeklong tour of the vineyards, golf courses and taverns as a kind of two.
1753;Miles, a devotee of pinot noir, is excited about treating his palate to some fine wine, while Jack, a dedicated party boy who talks in California dude.
1754;enter two beautiful, strong, together female characters .
1755;a rare treat for grown.
1756;Stephanie (Sandra Oh), a sexy, motorbike.
1757;riding wine pourer, immediately catches Jack's eye, and he woos her full.
1758;The hesitant courtship dance between Miles and Maya is lovely, and one of the most realistic ever committed to film.
1759;"whether it's Maya delivering a breathtakingly seductive soliloquy about wine as ""a living thing"" or Miles waxing lyrical about the properties of the pinot grape, each line of dialogue has a dual meaning that cleverly reveals something about the speaker."
1760;It's a joy to watch comedy unfold so naturally, the laughs gently teased out from our growing knowledge of the characters, their imperfections, doubts and, yes, emotional pain.
1761;this is a classic smart movie, has good jokes and clever conversations.
1762;Love the characters and it was a nice surprise movie to watch, the random time I saw it.
1763;"It is rather a ""Serious"" comedy with lots of laughs."
1764;the movie is about a couple of friends who go on a wine.
1765;On the way they meet two sexy chicks, Maya and Stephanie, and spend some time with them.
1766;The great thing about this film is that it holds up and you can view it again and again.
1767;This is a warm cup of cocoa on a Saturday night alone movie.
1768;Like Miles, Jack is kind to those around him.
1769;Still, like all great egotistical jerks in comedies, we secretly want to be like him, to carry that confidence that eludes us.
1770;there's something about Miles that I really connected with.
1771;This is the one thing that keeps him going, but it also keeps him isolated from those around him.
1772;As well as offering an intimite look at Miles' detachment from the world, it also gave the distinct impression of being drunk.
1773;In my opinion, this is the best film of 2004 (Kill Bill: Volume 2 is inferior unless combined with Volume 1).
1774;I just received my copy today, and have run thru a few scenes.
1775;very crisp where i look for details and resolution .
1776;wheel spokes, tree limbs, etc.
1777;I agree also with the above reviewer concerning some of the soft lighting and diffusion effects .
1778;yes, they are indeed intentional and a good cine/photo technique in various scenes for this movie.
1779;Oh it has some funny moments but this movie is very deep.
1780;The theme to me is that like a fine wine that gets better with time, so do (some)people.
1781;enjoy it with a bottle of your favorite wine, favorite cheese, and favorite person.
1782;With reasonably high expectations, a comfortable chair and an open mind, I sat back to enjoy this film's much talked about endearing quirkyness.
1783;Alternatively, I was easily impressed and enchanted by the gifted and beautiful Virginia Madsen in her effortless turn as Maya, a sensitive and introspective wine country waitress who is inexplicably attracted to Miles.
1784;Madsen is one talented and woefully underemployed actress that should be high on Hollywood's A list.
1785;All in all, 3 stars is all I could honestly muster even though I liked all of the actors and some of the dialog.
1786;it was funny as George Castanza.
1787;A nice little film that turned the wine communities on their heads.
1788;"the cast is great, and the ending isn't all ""Hollywood""."
1789;And the sex scenes had us rolling on the floor with laughter!
1790;How interesting would a movie be with 2 perfect buddies taking a trip, enjoying wine, and then going home?
1791;"i found this to be a strongly entertaining and funny movie about two ""FLAWED"" men who are lost in the world of relationships."
1792;the other is extroverted and fun, but just as lost.
1793;conscious, but has an attractive and undying passion for wine.
1794;"One of his most memorable moments has him expressing why he loves ""Pinot Noir"" due to the effort it takes to nurture and grow a healthy Pinot Noir grape."
1795;the beauty of the wine, countryside, and lovely women only adds to the entertainment value of this gorgeous movie.
1796;Giamatti stealing from his mother only highlights the lost nature of his character and makes the payoff of his enlightenment all that more sweet and complex.
1797;great dialogue, splendid acting all around, and a growing experience.
1798;This movie is the funniest I've seen in some time.
1799;The performances and writing are first rate.
1800;On a positive note, both actors have their funny moments, the scenery's amazing and the film is well shot, despite being mostly crap.
1801;incredible performances from all 4 principal actors, esp.
1802;but the film, the story, everything about it is truly astounding from start to great finish!
1803;it is hilarious, sad, hypotrical, great.
1804;i mean great acting by all, i could go on for an hour here, but i won't!
1805;it is a real masterpiece of a comedy with raw, sore, human emotions that literally begs for a 2nd and third viewing.
1806;it'a s real keeper, an instant classic, and one masterpiece of a film!
1807;bravos to all the marvelous cast.
1808;kudos for the producer/director for attempting it in the first place!
1809;B R A V O S!
1810;If you're in the arts at all, this film will make even more sense to you.
1811;Certainly, two friends, both arts oriented, are at a crossroads.
1812;and, most likely, follow in the family business).

1817;This road trip is, in effect, a wake for their friendship.
1818;Marriage is often the final nail in the coffin of friendship between men (as, often, with women).
1819;It's VERY entertaining and lively.
1820;ups that is FUN!In addition to this movie, I also need recommend another Amazon pick, a comic novel, THE LOSERS' CLUB: Complete Restored Edition by Richard Perez, which deals with similar themes of loss and friendships while also managing to be quite funny, lively, and off the cuff.
1821;An easy read with short chapters and funny characters, set in pre.9/11 New York City.

1827;Good performances, particularly from Sandra Oh who was so good in """"Under a Tuscan Sun."""""""
1828;i like the film's attention to detail .
1829;The interaction between the two main characters and the women they meet is engaging.
1830;I also like how even though one of the characters is still the self.
1831;absorbed loser, he finally shows a glimmer of improvement in the very final scene.
1832;This is a great film.
1833;It's a romantic comedy with hints about wine!!!
1834;It's a good movie for the end off the afternoon!
1835;Nothing I write here will sway you.
1836;if your IQ is higher than that, take a look at this great film.
1837;But I am glad I finally got around to seeing it!
1838;This makes fun of and characterizes much of American manliness: one final fling before marriage.
1839;A friend recommended this having heard of all its rewards won.
1840;the contrast between the two friends is dramatic.
1841;One has conscience pangs, while the other just is used to letting his yearnings control his life.
1842;miles is a wine kind of guy and Jack is a hunk actor with over developed libido.
1843;Watched it and it was a great comedy.
1844;Plot a little week but good advice on wines and lots of laughs.
1845;"Alexander Payne`s ""Sideways"" is what is known in the movie business as a ""Little Movie That Could,"" a low budget, independent film without major stars or dazzling special effects that, nevertheless, achieves a measure of success at the box office and, in this case at least, an Oscar nomination for Best Picture of the year."
1846;The one aspect of life in which Miles really seems to excel and in which his passion is given free rein is his connoisseurship of fine wine.
1847;His buddy, Jack, is a has.
1848;"like a rare, vintage Pinot Noir, ""Sideways"" is a film best appreciated by those with a finely developed taste for the subtle and offbeat."
1849;"The ideal way to experience a film like ""Sideways"" is to allow it to sneak up on you, to let it catch you unawares with its uniqueness and charm."
1850;"all this is preparatory to saying that ""Sideways"" is a very enjoyable little film for those willing to give it a chance."
1851;Not only are the premise and the setting novel and unique, but the film boasts some of the finest ensemble acting in any movie of recent years.
1852;Paul Giamatti, long one of our most talented and underrated actors, gives a performance of tremendous understatement and restraint, creating an entire character as much through facial expressions and body language as through dialogue.
1853;Playing the two women who enter into their lives that week, Sandra Oh and, especially, Virginia Madsen provide a sweetness and warmth that contrasts nicely with these two emotionally stunted middle.
1854;In a perfect blending of form and content, Payne and co. author Jim Taylor have created a tasty mixture of revelatory conversation, understated humor and lyrical camerawork.
1855;A wonderful film about real people and real places.
1856;At once a buddy film, a road movie, a romance, a drama, and an intelligent comedy,
1857;Oh, hoo rah, he finally gets the courage to go after the girl.
1858;Fun seeing the same places that were in the movie.
1859;Sideways tells of a weekend road trip shared by Jack and Miles .
1860;free weekend of fine wines, good food and wholesome golf.
1861;is determined to have both of them.
1862;Miles is smart enough to see through Jack's plans .
1863;which include a passionate and free.
1864;sampling the finest Pinot and also sharing his intellectual love with Maya.
1865;"Happily ""Sideways"" manages not to become a movie about wines (like ""Year of the Comet"") as much as a story about people who are into wines."
1866;"For its passion, ""Sideways"" is a soft."
1867;riot, it does have its comic moments .
1868;"Giamatti works pretty well for a depressive character who seems to seek in wine what he knows he can't find in other people
1869;Two men, friends for decades, leave San Diego for a week in California's wine country.
1870;The other man wants to golf, drink lots of great wine, and wait for a call from his publisher.
1871;i thought this really was a film about friendship.
1872;its just an okay movie.
1873;the are doing some crazy things and the story and the actings are right on target and very convincing.
1874;overall, it's really a masterpiece.
1875;The actors play is great, the story is full of fine little details, etc.
1876;Critics and movie reviewers raved about this film as it even won some awards as one of the best films of the year.
1877;I really want to give this movie a 1 star, but Paul Giamatti in a handful of scenes pulls off a his role quite well (I especially liked his reunion with his ex.
1878;Miles is to be the best man at Jack's wedding.
1879;one last comment about the women: it is amazing how one.
1880;dimensional the women of this movie are.
1881;And sometimes they can be good conversationalists, indulging us men in the things we care about most and telling us when we need to hear it how amazing we are.
1882;i kept waiting to find the funny part.
1883;I heard it was a buddy movie, a journey of discovery with laughs a. plenty along the way.
1884;style humor, but at least that did make me laugh, unlike this.
1885;Summary: Miles (Paul Giamatti) is Jack's (Thomas Haden Church) best man and wants to show Jack a fun time before he ties the knot.
1886;To Jack, this means sowing his wild oats before the wedding night.
1887;Miles is a loyal friend goes to great lengths to clean up after Jack, including fetching a wallet left at a one.
1888;I liked that the acting and script were very earthy and true to life .
1889;It was the accurate portrait of ungodly, middle.
1890;It's a story of apprehension, fear, love, and love lost .
1891;theme that tied together the whole movie.
1892;There are some utterly hilarious scenes and some terribly depressing scenes.
1893;I laughed numerous times at the outrageous antics.
1894;loved it!not for the faint of heart.
1895;I finally got around to catching on of last years most critically acclaimed movies, Sideway.
1896;All during awards season, everyone keeps talking how the movie should win or how it got shafted in certain categories.
1897;So with all the build up, I had high expectations for the film.
1898;the movie does pick up once the female leads disappear, but it's never a good sign when the first time you laugh in a comedy is an hour and a half in.
1899;It's wonderful when you can be among the first to see small.
1900;Sideways is an extremely funny and insightful examination of two men struggling with their mediocrity .
1901;thanks to the witty script, """"there's just like the faintest soupon of like, uh, asparagus,"""" has entered our lexicon of pretentious criticism."""
1902;Miles and Maya share a devotion to wine, and Miles is continuously surprised at the depth and character of this woman.
1903;The question of whether Miles can break out of his various layers of emotional armor to forge a connection with this delightful woman dominates the movie.
1904;destructive move, Jack gets involved with Stepanie (Sandra Oh), a vibrant single mother and good friend of Maya's.
1905;Watching Jack skirt emotional ruin while selfishly justifying his caddish behavior is a gruesome delight.
1906;"through it all, the script for ""Sideways"" puts believable, memorable lines into the mouths of these talented actors."
1907;"there is plenty of humor in ""Sideways,"" but most of it is reserved ."
1908;you will chuckle more often than laugh outright .
1909;Sideways is an attractive movie, but it is shot with a realistic eye .
1910;Sideways gets the balance of visuals and substance just right .
1911;one can easily imagine Miles liking his own movie, and that is high praise.
1912;This is one of the great films in the last decade of cinema and we get people like the previous reviewer .
1913;It does a real disservice to people who honestly write intelligently about films and books.
1914;I loved the movie, think it's a small work of genius, but I'm intrigued by the other user reviews.
1915;It's so funny: the five star reviews are, by and large, eloquent, insightful, etc.
1916;Because it won so many awards and went into mass release, it found itself in the red states where the numbskulls live: the squirrel.
1917;There are actually about 30 minutes of fun items that await you if you can find them!
1918;As I stated, it's all done for fun and it's worth a look.
1919;and2) A series of funny bloopers and shots of the crew on location, running about 14 minutes in length.
1920;There are quite a few fun items here.
1921;"First and foremost
1922;ray edition of this particular film.
1923;if I had to guess, it may very well go all the way back to the film equipment that was used to film the movie on set and location.
1924;This has got to be the most BORING movie I have seen.
1925;I went to see it kind of as a way to pass time while I was waiting for someone, but I really did enjoy myself.
1926;I found the movie to be very funny and it had a great story along with some very memorable characters.
1927;I just love her in this movie.
1928;She is actually the reason I started to watch Grey's Anatomy (which I love as well and she is great in).
1929;Everything about this movie was just wonderful.
1930;That really surprised me as I had generally heard it described as a comedy, which there is an abundance of.
1931;The classic movie to watch for the wine lover!
1932;It has a fantastic and charismatic cast that travels through Napa Valley for a weekend bachelor party.
1933;If you like wine and/or would like to learn more about it, then i would recommend this story for sure!
1934;I saw this film late at night at hotel in Dallas, I was about to go to sleep and just started watching it and really liked it.
1935;It's totally offbeat, but so well done.
1936;Giamatti, is first rate as always and Church is his perfect foil.
1937;It's a touching film and you really pull for Giamatti's character, you so want him to find some happiness, I can't think of any actor working today that is better at these type of parts than Giamatti.
1938;This film really is a true comedy drama, parts of it are just hilarious, but parts are so raw you want to look away.
1939;really a very good film.
1940;The poor people who gave this movie bad review should stick to cartoons and leave films like this to adults who appreciate intellectual comedy this movie was fantastic a piece of comic genus with heart, Paul Giammati was great as was church, you could feel the performances Madsen and Oh we're just as good so if you want a truly great film to watch see this, a must for your library these don't come around very often.
1941;I will always tell it like I see it.
1942;Hilarious, especially if you live in the Napa Valley!
1943;Paul Giamatti and Sandra Oh are amazing in this film.
1944;Virginia Madsen was wonderful .
1945;Sandra Oh is always fun to watch but didn't get a very good role to play with.
1946;He's capable of very good work.
1947;pierre Darroussin gives a gripping performance as a man under serious pressure.
1948;moving car, and an edgy ending.
1949;Thankfully it avoids the depressing tone of other films such as American Beauty and finds humor in the journey.
1950;Giamatti is a great actor and lets you feel his despair about the failures of his marriage and budding novel career.
1951;Virginia Madsen finally gets a role to showcase what she's capable of.
1952;How great is it that a man is attracted to a woman his age because of her intellect and interests.
1953;Yes she's very pretty, but if regular Hollywood was casting they would probably choose a 20 something starlet in the role.
1954;Her maturity is a large part of her appeal.
1955;Overall it has laugh out loud scenes as well as great dialog.
1956;Wine is more like a metaphor for life and there is a brilliant dialogue between Miles and Maya (the girl he falls in love with) that clearly shows this point.
1957;mainstream stuff should see it.
1958;The friends' two personalities grate terrifically, which makes for some superb character comedy .
1959;sideways works so well because the characters of Miles and Jack are so realistically and intelligently drawn by Payne, bringing them from Rex Pickett's novel to the screen with thoughtful dexterity.
1960;the comedy is a mixture of high farce (the scenes when Jack is playing the field as ferociously as he can in his final pre.
1961;The romantic sagas of the two guys perfectly reflects their characters.
1962;The sexual tension between them allows some poignant scenes.
1963;character development in this movie is top.
1964;These two unlikely pair creates an atmosphere of comical friendship.
1965;in short, the story is excellent, the dialog is filled with witty humour and the actors were brilliant.
1966;This movie was also nominated for 5 academy awards including best picture and best director.
1967;This is unsurprising as the scenery in this movie is also breathtaking.
1968;This movie is for those who appreciate fine acting and thoughtful dialogue.
1969;Character development, on location scenery, great performances and a script that is one of the best I've seen and heard in years.
1970;Paul Giamatti is excellent as Miles, the down on his luck author and school teacher trying to get his life in order.
1971;Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh round out the cast to make this movie a true Independent film classic.
1972;the people who put this movie together put it together from the point of view of their line in this movie that a bottle of wine is alive.
1973;the story has depth and the characters are totally believable.
1974;This movie is one of those excellent """"slice of life"""" movies that convinced you that the characters here are real people and the story is real and not just excellent actors you see on the screen."""
1975;slice of life movies are my favorites and those movies, the well.
1976;made ones are very rare in American cinema today.
1977;great combination of comedy and drama.
1978;Great story from the start as it slowly unfolds before your eyes.
1979;I am sorry I missed this one at the theater but this is a great one to watch on today's large screen televisions what with the very beautiful California wine country as one of the characters in the movie.
1980;Sideways is one of my most favorite movies of all time, and easily one of the best films ever made.
1981;It really is that good.
1982;It is deep, and thought provoking.
1983;Like I said, it is an all around excellent movie.
1984;I would give it a hundred stars if I could!
1985;Jack's idea of a good time?
1986;Getting laid as often as possible before he ties the knot.
1987;"he complains, ""She's a HOSTESS!"""
1988;I'm giving this two stars for the two times I laughed out loud.
1989;I love the characters, Miles, Jack, Mia,Stephanie, and of course, Stephanie's mother and Cami with the great laugh.
1990;To develop the characters in such a true to life way is amazing.
1991;Should have won best picture, best screen play, best actor, best supporting actor, best director, and best sound editing!!!!
1992;Alexander Payne is fast becoming one of the most interesting film directors in the business.
1993;His previous films Election and About Schmidt are light social commentary comedies.
1994;sideways tells the story of two middle aged men, one a middle school Social Studies teacher named Miles Raymond played by Paul Giamatti, and the other an actor named Jack played by Thomas Haden Church.
1995;tasting tour that Miles is an expert at.
1996;Along the way, they meet the humble, charming waitress Maya, played by Virginia Madsen, and the wild single mother Stephanie, played by Sandra Oh.
1997;with funny dialogue and the Alexander Payne style of realism, Sideways succeeds in making a connection with the audience.
1998;Ok, it is a shame that people won't order Merlot from me anymore (Oregon state merlot, people), but there's no denying the fact that this is a masterful piece of work here.
1999;this film has everything I love.
2000;witty dialouge with an underlying sense of sarcasm and black humor, it's about a writer, wine, dispicable characters, social commentary on how shallow secular America has become in relationships with other people, and wine.
2001;i loved seeing Giammatti's character.
2002;the acting was top notch, and it is a brilliantly written character study.
2003;I really relate to this movie.
2004;The scenery in California is beautiful.
2005;It's a good window into the wine culture.
2006;This scene is the turning point of the film and one of the most beautifully written scenes in world cinema.
2007;Only a man or woman without a heart could fail to be impressed by Miles' growth through the film, and this owing to his connection with a woman more profound than he.
2008;one final and amusing note on Miles' pretentiousness as a wine conoisseur.
2009;I thought it was a celebration of real life and when I left the theater, I was walking on a cloud.
2010;A classic with some great character actors and Paul Giamatti is always excellent and especially in this an early movie for him.
2011;I always thought that Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen deserved much better careers than they've had so far.
2012;"As it stands, ""Sideways"" is more a collection of scenes, some good, some great, than a movie, but that doesn't stop it from shining in many moments, including a would."
2013;And while I could have done without having to see the latter's backside while enjoying the carnal pleasures of the former, I do admire the willingness of the actors to go with the moment in their performances.
2014;it's a charming film but not a particularly revelatory or remarkable one .
2015;but adult audiences in middle age or creeping toward it will likely crack a smile and shed a well deserved tear despite themselves.
2016;I liked Sideways for many reasons, but mostly because the characters were very believable and honest to me.
2017;At best, it is a vague and open.
2018;The only thing we might infer is that Miles, as played by Paul Giamatti in what should have been an Oscar winning performance, finally begins to realize that he is a worthwhile person and that he has made peace with his divorce and begun the slow move forward.
2019;loathing that had eaten away at his happiness, his confidence, and his self.
2020;He was the right person and that was a powerful statement.
2021;His future looks far from happy to me.
2022;Maya, the perfect compliment to the needy and delicate Miles, has already re.
2023;filled marriage ended and it is her steadfastness and her new.
2024;found confidence and independence that allow her to re.
2025;connect with Miles and give him the benefit of a second chance.
2026;The scene between Miles and Maya in which they describe their love of wine is one of the most eloquent I have seen in a movie in a long while.
2027;It is a quiet movie that takes a wealth of empathy and understanding of the frailties of man to fully appreciate.
2028;I enjoyed Sideways and am glad I bought it.
2029;It contains beautiful scenery, lots of wine, little real life unsexy sex, a small amount of comedy, but seems to primarily be about how Miles and Jack deal with their dissappointing lives.
2030;He enjoys it both for it's sensual pleasure, but also to numb his angst.
2031;miles main goal for the trip is to show Jack a good time.
2032;To drink some fine wine, play some golf, and take in the beautiful location.
2033;Charming and confident on the surface, he's a former soap opera star who is now doing commericial voice overs.
2034;They meet Maya and Stephanie, two intelligent, attractive, and interesting women, but things don't go quite as planned.
2035;I will mention, though, that the acting is first rate.
2036;All 4 main actors do excellent jobs with their roles.
2037;there is an added bonus if you are a wine geek, yourself.
2038;You see the labels and they talk about the wines.
2039;They are first rate wines, though Miles is a bit of a snob.
2040;Early in their trip, Jack meets and soon courts the spirited Stephanie (Sandra Oh), who as it turns out is a friend of one of Miles' acquaintances, Maya (Virginia Madsen).
2041;Sideways is a film that has a charming warmth and humor to it.
2042;Its exploration of friendship through its two lead characters is insightful and ultimately inspirational.
2043;Yet, both men keep surviving their day.
2044;day adversities with the help of the other despite knowing they can never truly overcome all of their shortcomings.
2045;Helping to make the film work are a quartet of wonderful performances.
2046;perfect in his role and he is complemented by attention.
2047;Sideways is one of those films that makes you reflect on your own life.
2048;It also is a great introduction to the world of the wine connoisseur.
2049;We appreciate the good bottle of wine (or vino, as we call it) and found this movie to be hilarious, touching, thought provoking and all around enjoyable.
2050;Highly recommend it to wine lovers everywhere!
2051;It is just as delightful as I remembered when it played all over the country.
2052;a sensitive, bittersweet look at love and wine.
2053;Oh and if like me you wanted to enjoy the beauty of the vineyards and this lovely area well instead they chose to focus on the inside of a bad motel.
2054;"while ""Sideways"" is actually a film that blends many familiar themes in its plot it manages to introduce them achieving an atmosphere that makes it a very warm and ultimately very human film."
2055;sideways is genuingly funny in a manner that we all know real life can be.
2056;It's also equally tragic mostly because the loser of the story is a terrifically convincing character, one of those people that actually proclaim themselves losers even though they possess wonderful qualities that they themselves do not realise.
2057;This character is given a great performance by Giammati, one that should easily be considered for Oscar material even if the film doesnt have the otherwise flashy credentials recquired for such a consideration.
2058;Hilarious yes, farsical even, but still very believable.
2059;The scriptwriter obviously managed to achieve a very fine balance here, without which we'd have another fine idea messed up on celluloid.
2060;i's definetely not a situational comedy as most of the charm of the film is based on some seriously self.
2061;sarcastic and poignant dialogue and this counts as an extra asset to it.
2062;"one of the bigger surprises in films this year, ""Sideways"" shouldnt be ignored by anyone who looks for a comedy which isnt really a comedy or for a drama which isnt that either, but something in between which will have you laughing and thinking at the same time."
2063;then it was recommended by a knowledgeable family member.
2064;I enjoyed it a lot and hope to see more of Paul Giamatti in the future.
2065;life crisis, wine country and a humorous yet moving portrayal of all the ups and downs of life?
2066;You get the best film of 2004.
2067;The two of them take a trip to wine country to celebrate Jack's wedding.
2068;The direction and script are top notch but what really makes this film are the performances by the four leads.
2069;Thomas Haden Church also shines as a guy who makes many reckless mistakes but also learns about himself in the process.
2070;Virginia Madsen is terrific as a waitress at Miles favorite restaurant that is going through the growing pains of life.
2071;"She is lively and feisty as Jack's ""love interest."""
2072;The real crime here is that Paul Giamatti's humorous and moving performance was not nominated for Best Actor.
2073;This man was the emotional core of the entire movie.
2074;The ending perfectly does this.
2075;I give this remarkable film my highest rating of five out of five stars.
2076;I think this was a great movie, but I saw it after all the oscar hype and all.
2077;I love the guys that were the leads (Paul and Tom), and they did do a great job .
2078;I mean a really great job .
2079;on the upside, I was so happy that a movie like this made it into the mainstream, because so many of them are .
2080;Sideways is a gem in the rough, and with some more creative writing could have been one of the best movies of the year .
2081;Great job to all that made this unique film happen!!
2082;I was pleased that I finally saw it.
2083;A friend of mine is planning a wine.
2084;tasting trip to everywhere the movie went (which are all real places, I believe.
2085;But it takes a while to get going.
2086;His wild, reckless needs give an unpredictable energy to everything.
2087;You don't care so much about what Miles will do next, you wonder what his buddy will get into next!Some great, funny scenes in the second half.
2088;Hollywood pabulum is best left in Hollywood.
2089;But when Thomas Haden Church is in a movie, any movie, I will see it.
2090;His goal in this movie is to get laid period.
2091;Yes, what a wonderful and totally brand.
2092;keep in mind how the words whine and wine are homophones.
2093;If I haven't given you enough reasons not to watch this film, by all means read on cause here's the coup de grace.
2094;SPOILER ALERT!Much like the pinot noir described in the movie, this film is full of complexity, nuance and depth.
2095;It is a lot like wine that gets better with age.
2096;This movie is an exploration of the human condition: the frailties, the hope, the weaknesses, the desperation, the beauty and the inevitable humor that result from the follies of the characters.
2097;making are explored and juxtaposed with human nature as a metaphor.
2098;If done right, the result is a wine of complexity, subtlety, nuance and uncommon flavor.
2099;Much like his beloved varietal, Miles (Giamatti) is a complex, erudite scribe with a delicate psyche.
2100;"As pinots are sensitive to its environment
2101;Fortunately, nature shows him kindness, and warms his fields in the form of a beautiful, intelligent oenophile that knows and loves wine as much as he does.
2102;Much like the merlot described in the movie.
2103;forward but yet simple California merlot.
2104;lucky Jack also provides wonderful counterbalance to the sulky Miles in the form of levity and humor.
2105;stephanie works at a vineyard.
2106;Stephanie is bold, strong, assertive, and could even kick the ass of the man that breaks her heart.
2107;bank, cabernet and merlot blend very well in this movie in the form of Jack and Stephanie.
2108;maya is an attractive server at a restaurant with a sharp palate.
2109;She knows and loves wine as much as Miles.
2110;For reasons unexplained in the film, she likes Miles.
2111;The crux of this smart film can be found in a scene where Maya leads Miles out to the patio in order to escape from the awkwardness that escalates between them as the moans and the groans emanate louder and louder from Stephanie's room.
2112;What takes place is the most beautiful scene of the whole movie.
2113;In turn, Miles asks Maya how she got into wine, and what follows is a beautiful monologue that accomplishes several things: she reveals her passion and heightens the sexual intensity to a point where Miles just cannot take it anymore and has to eject himself into the bathroom.
2114;And true to form, injects more awkwardness between the two by forcing himself upon her in the kitchen.
2115;Miles is recuperating from a divorce, and Jack will marry for the first time the Saturday following the trek.
2116;Miles is , cerebral, introverted, literary and a connaiseur ofg fine wines.
2117;Jack gets the occasional voice.
2118;He is drowning in self.
2119;His acting skills serve him well in this role, and he manages to fool Stephanie into believing that he loves her.
2120;But one wonders whether Victoria and Maya will be able to mend these tattered men.
2121;a. subtext way that I wanted to punch them all in the mouth.
2122;I thought this movie was interesting from front to back.
2123;I loved the interacting of characters.
2124;Very funny, Very SMART, a human frailty revealing movie with all too easy to relate to characters.
2125;Once in awhile , there comes a film that defines and epitimizes the power of independent film.
2126;Films, that take the viewer to higher levels of awareness and consciousness , that studio films , seem trepidacous towards.
2127;Sideways"""", simply tells a basic story."""
2128;One of the best movies of 2004 was this highly entertaining 'feel good' drama/comedy of a week.
2129;It's kind of a 'mut and jeff' story.
2130;The dynamic between the two is great.
2131;They actually really complement each other in their contrasting yet endearing friendship.
2132;the screenplay is exceptionally well written with very 'human' character flaws revealed in these two rather lovable clowns that are displayed in the most humorous of ways.
2133;The scenery is of course wonderful and the film also serves as an introductory primer about those who live with an attuned awareness of fine wines.
2134;Does to me!The combination of drama to humor is a deft mix.
2135;The story is progressively interesting yet interjected with a lot of dry humor.
2136;By the end of the film both of their personalities are revealed to a degree of complexity that is rare for a movie coming out of hollywood these days.
2137;The net result is the viewer comes away with a good deal of empathy for these flawed characters.
2138;all in all, an excellent, light film that will make you laugh out loud and end up making you feel good.
2139;"My overall impression is that it was well done, but I don't think it rose to ""Best Picture of the Year"" worthiness."
2140;I thinking the acting was excellent.
2141;The direction was impeccable, with Alexander Payne not only getting great performances out of his actors, but beautifully capturing the setting, the odd juxtaposition of beautiful central California oak.
2142;And he's the better of the two.
2143;Is that the reality behind the California dream, where everyone is an actor and everyone's life is an act, a bunch of self.
2144;The character is one who has written a novel that he hoped to publish and turn his life around.
2145;Perhaps more importantly he has to cope with his ordinariness.
2146;the action of the film takes place mainly during a week when the aspiring writer takes a university buddy on a week trip to a wine growing area.
2147;In fact the film has been one of the most successful low budget films in years.
2148;The reason for that is despite the repellent nature of the characters it is hilarious.
2149;Each scene is a minor masterpiece either comic in itself or part of the gradual development of the character study of both of the participants.
2150;perhaps one of the most bizarre things about the film is that you feel drawn to the two protagonists.
2151;Some of the scenes are classics of comedy.
2152;it is one of the best films and years and after seeing it one can never attend a wine tasting again without bursting into laughter.
2153;The medium of the cinema can be entertaining as well as educational, and when it's done well, a film can be both.
2154;"in ""Sideways,"" Payne has created a highly entertaining and emotionally involving film with characters and situations to which a broad cross."
2155;section of viewers will readily be able to relate and identify.
2156;a succinct examination of the human condition.
2157;subtlety and nuance is exactly what Paul Giamatti brings to the role of Miles, as well.
2158;It's a performance that is so real it's almost excruciatingly so at times, but it makes Miles someone you can empathize with.
2159;"Giamatti creates a sympathetic character you can't help but root for on this vast wilderness of a stage we call life
2160;He imbues his character with such believable self.
2161;You realize that this is just Jack honestly being who he is.
2162;And it takes a good performance to get you as a viewer to that place.
2163;the striking Virginia Madsen does a good job, as well, as Maya, creating a character that is a perfect counterpart to the Miles created by Giamatti.
2164;I like this movie more every time I see it.
2165;It stays in you like the tannens of a fine Bordeaux.
2166;The hilarity of moments like the spitoon scene or the waitress scene are so well.
2167;balanced by the poignant relationships that build and cement.
2168;One of my favorite films.
2169;Brilliant cast, Giamati especially, and an hilarious script.
2170;One of those movies I could watch over and over.
2171;The movie is quite a study of two friends that have serious character flaws, yet we become involved in their story hoping the best for them.
2172;Pour a nice glass of pinot, sit back and enjoy.
2173;I love love love this movie.
2174;I also love the way some of the detractors of this movie just don't get it.
2175;well, you get the idea .
2176;excellent wine country footage, and great winetasting ephemera as well.
2177;It manages to both satirize and glorify the wine world at the same time.
2178;and, holy moley, what great acting.
2179;And Thomas Hayden Church was brilliant as well .
2180;and Sandra Oh and Virginia Madsen are pretty much perfection as well.
2181;and there are some of the great, earned bellylaughs in a movie, ever.
2182;A beautiful film about male relationships, also a very funny film, it's hard to believe that anyone could just totally trash what is a breath of fresh air for American movies.
2183;I've seen the movie three times and it gets better with every viewing.
2184;I really appreciate the talent of Paul Giamatti, but Sideways merely tells the tale of two buddies spending one last week of bachelorhood together before Jack (Thomas Haden Church) gets married.
2185;If you want a good movie surrounding a middle age crisis, I highly recommend """"American Beauty"""" instead."""
2186;This is the greatest film since Woody Allen's Mighty Aphrodite (1995).
2187;I came across this on satelite one night not knowing a thing about it other then it was a popular title around Oscar time.
2188;It turned out to be my favorite film in the last 10 years.
2189;I love everything about it, from the actors, the scenery, the road trip idea, I would not change a single thing.
2190;The whole film obsessed with sex, and has constant uses of the F word and contains a steady stream of other extremely vulgar language.
2191;Many say 'Sideways' is a funny comedy, and that is not without truths.
2192;life crisis, this film means much more than being a well.
2193;sweet tale about the life .
2194;and as that it is fantastic.
2195;nothing remarkable happens in 'Sideways.'
2196;Don't miss this part, for this is one of the most touching moments in the movie history.
2197;Surely Ms. Madsen deserves an Oscar nomination.
2198;as every good comedy is ultimately talking about life, 'Sideways' is also about life.
2199;This film is such a precious experience to teach us that.
2200;mild mannered and extremely intelligent Miles Raymond.
2201;jack is engaged to a beautiful young woman whom he seems to love very much.
2202;tasting trip is Miles' gift to Jack for his wedding.
2203;But each of them travels an immense distance emotionally, mentally, and psychologically during their week trip.
2204;the writing in the movie is fantastic.
2205;In addition to the writing, the acting is superb.
2206;Paul Giamatti gives a brilliant performance and was once again snubbed by the Academy for his efforts.
2207;All of the supporting roles were just as strong as Giamatti's performance and are a joy to watch together.
2208;Many of these references are actually sidebars about Thomas Haden Church's real.
2209;overall, SIDEWAYS is a wonderful and brilliant quirky, little film.
2210;Not everyone will enjoy it.
2211;But it does capture the essence of the struggle of a man at midlife and is worth watching for Giamatti's performance.
2212;I got this movie because of Paul Giamatti.
2213;In the movies that I have seen him in, I find him quite hilarious and so I figured he would be fun to watch in this movie to, plus I had heard pretty good things about the film.
2214;He hooks up with a couple and boy were they easy.
2215;Definitely don't watch with kids!
2216;This movie is really about nothing, but occasionally a movie about nothing is worthy of the highest praise.
2217;Paul Giamatti again demonstrates his ability to make you forget you are watching a movie rather than just observing someone else's life.
2218;This movie, perhaps better than any other movie with comparable box office revenue in the last two decades, truly develops a selection of unique and interesting characters that you can care about as a viewer.
2219;By having the courage to create four central characters that are all lovable, admirable and flawed individuals, this movie offers up a slice of life that will continue to affect you long after watching it.
2220;It's a touching, sometimes funny, mid.
2221;I found myself waiting to be blown away, and I think this in part made me enjoy the film less.
2222;"In fact, I was more moved by ""About Schmidt."""
2223;Both are character films with great acting, but Schmidt just seemed more original, and it hit a deeper nerve.
2224;Believe all the hype that you have heard on this film it is absolutely wonderful in so many ways.
2225;The boys meet a couple of bright and wonderful women who add to the fiasco.
2226;But the wine is the true star!This film is written lyrically and it flows like the wine which remains its sub.
2227;The acting is phenomenal offering both comic and emotional depth in each of the characters.
2228;"Madsen is luminous and has the best lines
2229;Giamatti is subtle yet hilarious as the unconfident man with a heart of gold.
2230;And Sandra Oh has the best revenge scene ever filmed.you go girl!
2231;Together the blend has an essence of vanilla, a touch of oak and absolutely no horrible aftertaste because it is aged and cared for just like a fine body of wine shelved sideways.
2232;Though this movie is referred to as a comedy (and it is funny in a lot of places), I saw Sideways as more of a serious drama with humor mixed in.
2233;There's a lot of emotional sadness and heartache in this film, and it's not to be taken lightly.
2234;Jack's about to marry into a rich family in a few days, and he's starting to have second thoughts about his decision.
2235;During the trip, the two men inadvertently get involved with two very intelligent, passionate, and independent women (Maya who's played by Virginia Madsen and Stephanie who's played by Sandra Oh), setting the stage for humor, betrayal, and a great deal of emotional turmoil.
2236;sideways is a vivid study of male friendship, mid.
2237;The acting by the four main principles is subtle"
2238;There are three really powerful scenes in the film that stood out for me.
2239;While there, Miles pays a visit to his mother's bedroom and steals several hundred dollars from her dresser bureau.
2240;This scene is definitely one of Virginia Madsen's best.
2241;This is powerful acting by both Giamatti and Church.
2242;The expression on their faces captured perfectly the heart.
2243;felt emotions that two friends can have for each other, knowing that it's impossible not to help the other.
2244;This is the best piece of work that he's done to date and About Schmidt was one of his earlier films.
2245;What it does take, however, is a strong script, strong direction, and strong acting.
2246;I now wish that Sideways had won more Academy Awards than it did.
2247;I just watched it for the third time and loved it more than ever.
2248;This emotional, yet humorous movie, is more poignant to me now then when it was released nearly ten years ago.
2249;Plus, it does a great job of depicting wine tasting in Santa Barbara wine country.
2250;Paul Giamatti is a terrific actor, there is NO arguing that.
2251;THAT aside, this is yet another fine film by Alexander Payne, who's now 4 for 4.
2252;There's just something he manages to put in every one of his movies that can appeal to just about anyone who takes the time to appreciate them, and this one is no exception.
2253;This is, to put it simply, a brilliant movie, sometimes not all that easy to watch but in the end all the better for it.
2254;Those accustomed to movies with tidy plots and unambiguous endings will probably find themselves disappointed with this one, but I actually found its irregular rhythms and relaxed pace to be a welcome deviation from the norm.
2255;Sideways is filled with open spaces, uncomfortable silences, and some truly painful moments, but it's also filled with hilarious, deadpan dialogue, occasionally unlikable but persistently believable characters, and random bits of outrageous slapstick humor and unforgettable imagery.
2256;Not to mention, it further demonstrates Payne's genius when it comes finding meaning and hilarity in the lives of completely ordinary people.
2257;payne has long since demonstrated a knack for crafting characters who are deeply flawed but strangely sympathetic at the same time, and in Miles Raymond he may have his best protagonist yet.
2258;toned allusions and ripping on themselves as well as occasionally talking about the movie.
2259;At some points it's even funnier than the movie itself, which is saying something.
2260;Oh and of course, it goes without saying that you should pick up the widescreen edition, as the transfer you get with it is decidedly excellent.
2261;What's funny about lying in order to get a woman into bed?Don't waste your money.
2262;And wuck our wives in the frass.
2263;Neither Giamatti nor Church played likable characters.
2264;The best thing in the film is Virginia Madsen, who was other.
2265;"worldly radiant as the angel of death in ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and is realistically radiant here."
2266;Has anyone noticed that the one.
2267;you know who you are, you brain.
2268;star reviews are very lengthy, usually articulate and thoughtful and understand what the filmmaker was trying to accomplish.
2269;In Sideways, Alexander Payne has made arguably his best film, and that is saying a lot indeed.
2270;Election and Citizen Ruth are masterful satirical comedies, and About Schmidt is a wonderful film about one man's coming to terms with middle age.
2271;this film has elements of his prior work (great script, full blown multi.
2272;dimensional characters, and social satire), but is more subtle and fully realized.
2273;The acting is first rate by all, but Paul Giamatti is an absolute revelation.
2274;the film's storyline has been adequately covered by previous reviewers, but one facet warrants special mention.
2275;This guy knows how to end a movie.
2276;Simply put, this is the best movie made in the last year and a half.
2277;The scenery and the actual locations within the Santa Barbara.
2278;As you can see, this combo makes for an interesting weeks adventure.
2279;Mix in some fine wine, and let the show begin.
2280;I just watched this movie for about the third time, and each time its like a fine wine, the humor and drama really come out with viewing.
2281;turner, one of those addictive ones you read cover to cover in one day.
2282;So I strongly recommend this movie, it really was one of the best films of 2004, for once ebert and ropert were right, and the acadamy awards robbed it from best picture, stolen by million dollar baby, why?
2283;So grab a glass of wine and enjoy.
2284;got it, thanks), but otherwise brilliant.
2285;Paul Giamatti's performance is the reason to see Sideways, he is extremely entertaining.
2286;Sandra Oh is pretty good, I'm just not sure why they have her listed as the featured actor.
2287;As it was, I really savoured this wonderful comic drama.
2288;It's his best friend's wedding, and the two of them take off into Californian wine country for a last bit of fun together.
2289;this central relationship is beautifully portrayed.
2290;The two are poles apart on every level, having in common only the fact they shared a room together in college, and yet they share a strong bond that goes deep.
2291;paul Giamatti's performance as Miles is the backbone of the film.
2292;His scenes with Virginia Madsen are particularly poignant.
2293;life territory, could have been disastrously pretentious, but it works because of two perfect performances and because it is obvious the characters are aware of what's going on .
2294;Their deep connection, her warm heart and his hurt are so evident.
2295;other delights in the film are the Californian landscape and Guy Rolfe's quirky, jazzy score.
2296;Payne is a great storyteller, and throws in lots of neat devices to tell us more about the characters and the story without having to hit us in the face with the script all the time.
2297;"I remember when there was a time we used to watch movies for entertainment, with good editing, good direction and excellent scripts
2298;verdict: Overall quite an enjoyable movie with some really witty dialogue not to mention the mini.
2299;It strikes a decent balance between good filmmaking and a modern.
2300;rating: 4 and stars for a well written movie made with a lot of emotion and creditable performance.
2301;let me begin by stating that I am completely mystified by the film's positive reception and, so much so, that I feel compelled to air my views publicly.
2302;As the film deals with the consumption of excellent wines to the extent that it does, it would do to be reminded that there exists a very definite distinction between good and bad wines.
2303;The following describes the tasks performed to prepare for a reviewing of the film and the Blu Ray media format as well.
2304;To accomplish that feat, I provided various types and qualities of wines to pair with the sequence of events throughout the film.
2305;Once the evening and the film moved along, the wines progressed into the red variety, with Pinot Noir's presented at the appropriate moment, as well as (ironically) Merlot, just when it was stated that there shouldn't be any.
2306;Those that enjoy 'sweet', light, critter.
2307;For those who think highly of the film, they will always find enjoyment from watching it again (especially with snakkies and wine).
2308;the only 'gripe' from those that complain about the movie, that I can understand, is that it is marketed and hinted.
2309;I intend to watch it again (like many fans of the movie) with my soon.
2310;I found this to be one of the best films I've seen in the past year.
2311;Ten years ago I loved the movie Swingers, because it had much more appeal for someone in that age group (immediately post.
2312;Additionally, the more confident and self.
2313;It should appeal to a certain age and disposition, but for those who can relate at all to Miles, it is written brilliantly.
2314;I loved how the actors .
2315;I loved listening to the way they spoke their lines and timed their facial expressions: Outstanding talent.
2316;The contrast between how polite, charming and intelligent the characters strove to be when in the company of others, and their genuine thoughts and feelings apart from any company was amusing, to me.
2317;i loved Virginia Madsen and her portrayal of """"Maya."""""""
2318;But I sure enjoyed Virginia Madsen's portrayal of a remarkable woman showing interest in a rather pathetic man (and no, I'm not that either).
