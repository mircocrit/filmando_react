id;spiegazione
1;this is right up your alley (as it is mine!)
2;But historically, it's incredibly inaccurate.
3;put your feet on the coffee table, crack a beer, open a bag of potato chips, and lose yourself in a really good war movie.
4;Beautiful set design for a blasted out Stalingrad, great costuming, and wonderful makeup.
5;Both Soviet resolve and the famous Russian winter ganged up on the German and some Italian forces to create a truly exquisite hell on earth, and the nearly totally destroyed city of Stalingrad itself gave wonderful and equal cover to both forces.
6;the movie is the story of the dual between the Soviet and German snipers and does indeed make for a great flick.
7;nagant is a good rifle, but it was still a field.
8;Tania Chernova was blond and, in addition to being a very successful sniper in her own right, did some explosives work.
9;Forget all about the history books, and just relax and enjoy the movie.
10;(That is, if you can overlook Russians speaking with British accents).
11;I was in the military and I know what it's really like, but this is one inaccuracy I approve of.
12;Five stars for a good fictionalized war movie.
13;but it's only a one star movie for historical accuracy.
14;It's promotional hook is the lethal, real life cat.
15;And that will be the point you finally feel some precious shred of hope you will actually be back in the light of your real world when the movie ends.
16;When I first watched this film I thought what an amazing war film.
17;The acting is pretty incredible from everyone by Weiss.
18;Ed Harris and Jude Law are just excellent as the snipers and convey emotion.
19;Ron Pearlman's breif character is good.
20;The good old Happy Ending.
21;Yet they make sure the ending is a happy one.
22;But the happy ending takes away any real need for us to think.
23;Overall it is a film worth owning if for no other reason than Ed Harris.
24;This movie will make you say saving private who???
25;The sniper duels are amazing.
26;they should have stuck with the good stuff.
27;This movie is worth ever penny
28;A young boy provides a story for a bar of chocolate.
29;Tanya and Vassily are nice to each other.
30;Koenig is very clever to understand that boy, and lays a trap.
31;The film continues to the final showdown between Vassily and Koenig.
32;While its not purely historically accurate, it does take the highlights of Vasily career as a Russian Sniper and gives it to us in a entertaining way.
33;Acting for all characters is good, depiction of the war on the Russian front is a lot like Saving Private Ryan, very realistic.
34;I would recommend this to anyone.
35;With all of the killing how could you like this movie .
36;From peasant farmer to outstanding killer the road upward.
37;I rate this movie overall as a four star (out of five).
38;Very entertaining, very good scenes specially the crossing of the Volga while being attacked by Stukas and the Red Square battle.
39;In this category the movie certainly rates a high 4 stars.
40;very well done, the sets look real, I have seen pictures of red square and the red October factory and the sets used are very accurate.
41;The ambientation, the uniforms, the equipment shown is very realistic (mark III panzer tanks, spandau machine guns, SKDf half tracks, etc.) in this respect I will give the production a five star.
42;on the one hand it is a ``piece of art,'' but on the other hand it is very rare in the social/historical sense.
43;As a suspense, I think that the duel between snipers is very interesting, for example.
44;I think this is the most realistic war movie I ever saw .
45;the historical aspect is much more important.
46;Indeed, after these numerous Hollywood war movies one can be under the impression the American troops won the WWII alone.
47;The opening sequences are very effective and impressively nightmarish in showing that war is hell, a message one can't hear too often.
48;This is a great movie to see this, it is very educational, before it I had no idea of Stalingrad, and I love history and specially WW2, sure, is not as good as Saving Private Ryan, but it is at least as authentic, which makes it a great contender for best war movie.
49;And this movie is like that, although some people might argue about that, this movie is not that heroic, we have to remember that it is a true story, and it can't be changed that dramatically.
50;It is still about Russian folk hero Vassili Zaitzev, but Ed Harris did as usual a great job in being a nemesis, authentic and real, not exaggerated.
51;The sound is good as the picture.
52;The script is decent, and most of the direction is understated but fine enough.
53;the sniper confrontations between Law and Harris are very well done, and actually fairly gripping (with excellent use of bomb.
54;technically the film is very well made, with fine use of CGI effects to conjure up awe.
55;The extras include 2 reasonable featurettes and an above average trailer.
56;There is little positive to say about this movie.
57;I've watched this film several times and it is one of my favorites, has just enough action to keep a guy at the edge is his seat and enough suspense/love story to keep my gf in hers.
58;The film jumps back and forth between reality and myth.
59;One scene may be gritty realism, while another surreal myth.
60;The director knows this and that's the whole point.
61;A friend, with more knowledge than I in such matters, tells me that there are many, obvious references to the great Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein.
62;together Hollywood romance, but it's well handled here and not a huge part of the story.
63;Those who talk about it marring a large part of the film are prehaps seeing the romance as bigger than it is, hating the fact that it is there at all.
64;and by the time I got to the end of the film I was thoroughly done with it.
65;I liked all the characters in the story, even if not everything fit neatly.
66;The battle of Stalingrad is the most epic battle ever, and an accurate re.
67;enactment is an education of inestimable value!
68;(scratch) The amazing moral, personal, and social insensitivity of modern Americans is, to me, quite amazing!
69;Anyway, this film displays the incredible personal and moral courage of Russian soldiers fighting like rats in the ruins of Stalingrad.
70;The opening scene on the Volga is worth the whole film.
71;So after openly admitting that this genre often leaves me cold, I have to take a step back from my stance and admit that `Enemy at the Gates' is kind of great.
72;And, in all honestly, containing the warfare to a more subtle and quiet setting (the sniping) makes it all the more intimate and internalized, which adds to the intensity as opposed to just bolstering our external excitement.
73;The film was well made with great special effects and the scene of the transferring of troops across the Volga river was spectacular.
74;Enemy at the Gates is a very good movie.
75;When they get into the City and they are bombed, the special effects improved.
76;I love English Accents, and the actors and actresses are great, so that balances the Accent Problem.
77;It's a great WW2 movie, covering the Russian offensive.
78;my dad asked me to look for this and i found this for a good price and he loved it
79;It shows memorable battle sequences (both infantry and sniper).
80;It also shows female Russian snipers (They existed and were as tough and skilled as their male counterparts, ex: Lyudmila Mykhailivna Pavlichenko) One big plus in this movie is they actually got the scope right!
81;5/5 Great Movie, must watch!
82;This is a realistic comment on the mentality of the Russians who killed thousands of their own troops in disciplinary actions.
83;It's the other way around, politically correct would be to say how great the Russians were in WWII.
84;politically correct is what's surprising, and is why you should view such a rarity.
85;There's also a love interest.
86;It's not a great movie, because of the sniper and love interest are so.
87;so done, but it's a good movie, and one of the few large screen Hollywood cinematic releases on the subject, is relatively short at a bit over two hours considering the subject matter, and is essential viewing for anyone interested in Stalingrad and the nature of the Soviet Union.
88;If you have further interest, there are numerous documentaries that could and should be watched on the Battle for Stalingrad.
89;I waited a long time and finally got it on video.
90;It is amazing to look at and it has excellent special effects.
91;It is still a good film and worth watching, even if it was a bit disappointing.
92;One of my favorite movies.
93;As it is based on true facts., So interested in the main character that we bought a book about him.
94;Apart from a scene which awkwardly caricatures the Russian field commanders and the occasionally distracting accents, the film successfully immerses the viewer in this tense war drama.
95;Enemy At The Gates is still a consistently intriguing war film.
96;rare because it does not involve Americans.
97;While we are never really concerned about the outcome of the actual war, nor do we entirely care about several aspects of the main characters, there are many good scenes of suspense, and the overall mood of the movie is effective.
98;Enemy at the Gates is worth seeing if it sounds interesting to you.
99;Any true story is worth the re.
100;It also came in just fine in both video and audio.
101;When I read the words based on a true story or inspired by real events I question how much of the story is factual.
102;After seeing this movie I would like to think I have a pretty good idea where the writers/director added their 'artistic discretion' but either way it makes for an enjoyable story.
103;Between a decent cast and interesting plot I would recommend this movie to any history buff or fan of military films.
104;this film could have had it all _ a gruesome battle in WWII, historical truth and a great beginning, the train ride, the crossing of the don, the attack in the city, it all promised a great war movie.
105;both are far better than 10 minutes of this film.
106;Seldom is an event in history so well rendered as is the classic battle for Stalingrad during WWII in this superb film about a classic sniper's duel between a young and renowned Soviet rifleman who had become a virtual legend to both his fellow soldiers and the ragged proletariat back home, on the one hand, and an older and highly decorated Wehrmacht officer who has come to eliminate the young Soviet phenomenon for propaganda purposes.
107;What is most amazing about the classic snipers' duel is the fact that it is all based on historical fact, and the eventual survivor of the duel goes on to live a long and satisfying life thereafter.
108;This is a wonderful albeit grim and sometimes depressing movie, and one I can heartily recommend.
109;I recommend this movie, particularly to those with an eye to history or the History Channel.
110;it was a great story of the two rifles that competed against each other in the war.
111;Jude law and Ed Harris should have won an emmy
112;Cross of Iron is great, but I wanted a modern interpretation.
113;This is the most realistic part of the movie.
114;The standard infantry is, as they can defend and take positions.
115;The very last thing on a soldier's mind in those conditions is [romance].
116;This movie is a wonderful compliment to any Mosin Nagant owner.
117;There is one major sex scene, and a movie filled with visceral and visible gunshot wounds.
118;This is a movie that is a joy to watch, is contemporary to the times, and showcases what our society today too often ignores: Heroes.
119;Evolution: Cinema has seen many, many WWII films.
120;Yet there is a certain glee in the gun.
121;Stageplay: One of the first surprises of the film is that the Russian actors have British accents, while the Germans have German accents and speak English.
122;Anyone who enjoys dramatic portrayals of war will enjoy this movie.
123;Like any other production of a true story, it takes liberties to keep the viewer focused and captivated, but it is done well.
124;It takes unexpected turns that keep the viewer anxious.
125;Enemy at the Gates, despite being mostly fictitious, is a very entertaining film that accurately depicts much of the fighting in Stalingrad.
126;for the most part, the sequences in Enemy at the Gates are believable, if not quite historically accurate.
127;The acting is superb, though, with both Jude Law and Ed Harris delivering excellent performances.
128;argue about the inaccuracies all you want, Enemy at the Gates is still an entertaining film that kept me enthralled throughout.
129;I highly recommend seeing it.
130;Great film, the most accurate description of the battle of Stalingrad I have seen.
131;The over all theme of the movie was historically accurate, and as far as entertainment goes, it was top notch.
132;This movie was poorly made, as in, it is one of the most historically inaccurate movies I have ever seen.
133;I bought this a couple years ago and I don't think i have a greater regret in my life, than sitting down and watching this movie.
134;This is a terrific portrayal of the epic battle of Stalingrad and the heroic sniper efforts of the Russian army.
135;A great war movie without all the huge battle scenes but rather just following the story of one man.
136;The choas and bravery of the event are caputured masterfully and Jude Law delivers his best performance yet.
137;I always liked this movie just for the fact that it shows the side of the Russians and not just the American/British front.
138;But Jude Law does a good job portraying one of the greatest snipers.
139;And that love story got in the way.
140;there is a great story in the tale of this sniper duel.
141;I had wanted to see it because Ebert Roeper, Joel Siegel, and whoever reviews movies for People Magazine had all said this was a good movie.
142;i thought the director did a very good job of portraying the TRUE battle between a Soviet and German sniper in WWII Stalingrad.
143;It's just more than worth seeing.
144;So admired Vacelli and his passion.
145;Great tenancy in the Russian people, strength in spite of being outnumbered, they prevailed.
146;This film was one of the best films about WWII and the Soviet Union.
147;This is one of the movies that actually makes people who watch it less intelligent.
148;While the VERY broad facts the story is based on actually happened, the movie is pure fiction despite being based on real people.
149;This film walks the thin line between showing the reality of war and fulfilling the necessity of having a sexy, intelligent, 3 dimensional female in a high budget action picture.
150;This film has it all for me.
151;This movie is a great World War 2 film, I would definitely recommend it to a friend to watch this.
152;Enemy at the Gates is a Very Good War film
153;The film was well acted, and the cinematography was execellent.
154;I felt that the overall film was very enjoyable, and that tracking the lif of the sniper who became a hero was a great idea.
155;This film is one of the first films ever sold to a primarily American audience about the Soviet Front in WW2.
156;In that regard it is an important film.
157;this particular movie is about a very personal duel within the context if the battle of Stalingrad, a mammoth battle which consumed the entire German Sixth Army.
158;Their answer is the commander of their own elite sniper school in Berlin, a Major Koenig (wonderfully played by Ed Harris).
159;There is also a love triangle between Zaitsev, a female soldier (Rachel Weisz .
160;all in all, this was an excellent movie, but did not make a truly lasting impression on me like other classic war movies, such as Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, and Apocalypse Now.
161;One of the best war movies I have seen in a long time.
162;Interesting story line, very good acting and battle sceens.
163;This one is a modern classic.
164;I think its a very good history movie to see because it talks about the real story of Vassili Zaitsev the russian sharp shooter.
165;Jude law is a very good actor in this movie.
166;At best, it is a made up war.
167;arms tale with a historical figure, Vasilly Zaitzev, at the center.
168;the first 10.20 minutes of the film are pretty good.
169;The footage of Stukas attacking Soviet troops as they make the crossing into Stalingrad was terrific.
170;the story of the defense of Stalingrad is one of the most compelling and dramatic of the war.
171;This could have been a great movie.
172;Just as lifelike and certainly as, if not more, compelling, Enemy At The Gates paints a vivid picture of the Battle of Stalingrad.
173;The unarmed men are instructed to follow a man with gun, and when he is killed, to pick up the weapon himself and fight the enemy valiantly.
174;as a powerful figure in the Communist propaganda machine, Danilov uses his skills and connections to transform Vassili into a larger.
175;life hero, creating the impression that he is capable of defeating the German army all by himself.
176;Meanwhile, Enemy At The Gates makes a place for itself among the great war dramas of our era.
177;cultivated screenplay, coupled with an unparalleled visual display of the destructiveness of war, makes this a must.
178;both for its educational and historical value as well as its edge.
179;Any student of the Great War knows that this struggle among the ruins of Stalingrad was one of the great personnel battles to take place.
180;If you like War movies, especially World Wr 2 movies, I recommend this movie.
181;It was a very great sniper movie and very realisitic.
182;This movie had a very great plot and tons of action.
183;Of the many essential films to the WW2 story,this crucial example of reality during a time of combat fully demonstrates the virtues of the hero.
184;factor,in the case of the story's young soldier that must show his people hope in the ways of a combat.
185;this extraordinary release of the millenium not only shows a willing justifiable plot but brings us an almost uncomparable reunion of cinema's best men for the job.
186;starting the cast with Ed Harris,we see the expectation given to his 'hunter' soldier by the film's cause,and learn that the man resembles the brilliance of 'From Russia with love's s. p. e. c. t. r. e assazin Red Grant which in 1963 was powerfully portrayed by the late Robert Shaw(1927.1979),but Harris' entry holds a touch of heroism,comparable to Jude Law's soviet.
187;adding up to this level of irony given by Harris we are given another truely great presence Bob Hoskins portraying a crucial Nikita Krushchev.
188;hoskins is truely admirable in this film as well as the common war element or gift shown by Harris,as well as a great directing chore given by Jean.
189;Sure, this was a great movie for passing the time, great action, fine acting, and so forth.
190;He is one soldier, one of millions in Soviet army.
191;But the ultimate laugh was when Ed Harris is mixing English and German together in his sentences.
192;era Russian and Third Reich German, as executed so well in Downfall.
193;I Love this movie and have watched it over and over.
194;Along the way there is a romance between Law and Rachel Weisz and we even meet Bob Hoskins as Nikita Kruschev!
195;Law is sexy, as usual, but he is so obviously an Englishman that he can't bring this character entirely home to us.
196;The romance aspect isn't bad.
197;His best English language film was The Lover set in Vietnam when it was French Indochina and populated by the French.
198;Enemy at the Gates is a very impressive movie.
199;It is a visual feast.
200;The acting, plot, beautiful cinematography, and directing are top.
201;The setting and war scenes are simply amazing.
202;We really enjoyed this movie very much.
203;I was not as moved as I felt I could have been by parts of the story, nor did I feel they developed the Russian story as well as they could have.
204;This could have been an EPIC, however, it is now just a good, entertaining movie.
205;That said, a few observations:Vassily Zaitsev, the hero of this film, certainly existed in reality.
206;as the film tells us very clearly.
207;Purists will object that nobody in history has been THAT good a shot, or anything close to it.
208;rachel Weisz is such an extraordinarily appealing actress that one overlooks the absurdities in how her character is written.
209;michael Medved detested James Horner's musical score.
210;I found it very effective, though Horneresque.
211;as the doors are opened, the troops stand in shock at what they see, the destruction of a once mighty city by a force that is far superior to what the Russians can muster up.
212;this is the backdrop for the real story, which focuses on young Vassily Zaitsev, played by Jude Law.
213;Vassily is a young man, a farmer's son, who was taught by his grandfather to shoot and is excellent at it.
214;He meets up with Danilov, a Political Officer whose job is similar to a moral cheerleader.
215;the Russian/German showdown is definitely the showcase of this movie.
216;One of the best scenes in the movie involve Vassily and a fellow tracker (Dana Cebulla) think they got Koenig in a clothing factory, but are instead walking into a trap.
217;Even movies of great darkness such as Schindler's List had a few moments of brightness.
218;i would recommend this movie because of the fabulous showdown of the sniper's and the bloody realism of the Battle of Stalingrad.
219;Vassilly is a true hero, and this is the finest war movie I have ever seen.
220;I thought this was a good (though not great) movie, especially for WWII fans.
221;Well worth the viewing, probably more than once, and a nice addition to the film library.
222;but the movie itself is very nice.
223;actually, the film is about a legend that grew in Soviet Russia during WWII, and this story puts it into that great battle.
224;The other is a professional from Nazi Germany.
225;The mass combat is spectacular.
226;Watch this film for a look at that for yourself.
227;It will give you a small look at the struggle that cost 20 million Soviets' lives.
228;I think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
229;Jude Law is a member of the resistance and becomes a hero, and the Germans send a guy (Ed Harris) to stop him.
230;They are both top snipers and the sniper war is on.
231;This movie is a suspenseful thriller you will want to watch over and over.
232;This movie is a must.
233;It is a GREAT movie!
234;I actually got this movie after hearing the soundtrack on Spotify .
235;the movie itself didn't disappoint in the least :D No punches pulled, it showed both sides of the story quite well .
236;I would DEFINITELY recommend this if you like historical fiction, action, or if you merely have good taste in movies.
237;Bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it.
238;Price i paid was great for it being used and still in the clear packaging.
239;Likewise, Enemy at the Gates gets a star of gratitude for recognizing the enormous Soviet contribution to the Victory, and for its portrayal of sympathetic Russian and Ukrainian heroes based on real people.
240;natural nature film of a male bear nurturing an orphan cub!
241;Because EATG gives us the immensely interesting Stalingrad setting, complete with long overdue Eastern Front heroes for us to root for!
242;I could cite dozens of examples, but here are just a few, crafted to create a politically.
243;which brings me to EATG's main characters.
244;Zaitsev, while played charmingly by Hollywood heartthrob Jude Law, was actually a strict, self.
245;confident leader, not a shy farmboy.
246;(One of the film's redeeming features is its recognition of the million.
247;So much for the tender Hollywood romance!
248;top performance of Bob Hoskins as Nikita Khruschev, the better!All in all, this film promised so much greatness and delivered so much b. s. I'm sorry to say so.
249;The German film Stalingrad gives a much more accurate and serious impression of the turning.
250;William Craig's book, which inspired the title and some of the scenes of EATG, is worth reading.
251;I enjoyed this movie, and give it 4 stars for its scenery, props and acting.
252;(The real explanation, by the way, was largely twofold .
253;the setting, scenes, uniforms and weapons, were accurately protrayed to a very good level of detail.
254;its a good movie .
255;Zaitsev was a real person though and a real hero, as was Tanya.
256;Probably the best war movie ever.
257;based on American William Craig's book it concentates on a true life duel between the best German and Russian snipers.
258;The film's only flaw is the Romance between Law and actress:Rachel Weisz put the film down, what could have been an Mastepiece, still is an very good movie.
259;Based on a true story, this movie kept me riveted to the screen.
260;I found it fascinating that such an inspiring movie based on the mighty army of an invader can bring out the best in the common people.
261;Best movie in a long time of nonfiction
262;In this case, it is the cat.
263;With friends like him, who needs enemies?
264;As well as Robert Fraisse's photography of a city being bombarded and destroyed, the dark colors and constantly burning buildings creating the mood, Alain Godard and Jean.
265;jacques Annaud, both of whom had worked together on The Name of the Rose (1986), have produced a memorable movie dealing with one of the darkest chapters in world history with their meticulous attention to detail.
266;The reason I gave this two and not one star was that at times this was a very appealing movie visually.
267;This scene was absolutely inexcusable.
268;well to make it short, I enjoyed the story of Zaitsiev, the noble sniper (check the book Stalingrad by Anthony Beevor), being made in to a movie.
269;Enemy at the gates was really well.
270;done, but the romance got in the way a little.
271;It was definitely worth seeing and I highly recommend it.
272;The story has been brilliantly reassembled from the many Russian newspaper reports of the time to create a beautifully written, visually enthralling film studded with many fine actors and actresses.
273;Major Konig's marksmanship is also very well depicted.
274;This movie is a must.
275;One of the best film movies.
276;The picture is great too.
277;Enemy at the Gates contained some of the most authentic and horrific wartime footage since Spielberg's masterpiece, Saving Private Ryan .
278;The battle of wits between the 2 is played out very nicely.
279;There is also a love triangle played out between Law, Soviet political officer Joseph Fiennes (excellent as usual) and Soviet soldier Rachel Weisz.
280;I really liked this movie.
281;as well as all the other actors.
282;The authenticity of the story made the movie.
283;The fight scenes are intense, the acting is quite good, and Ed Harris always gives us a fantastic performance.
284;please give this movie a chance.
285;It is well worth viewing at least once.
286;Enemy at the Gates is an excellent movie.
287;I usually don't like war movies but this one was exceptional.
288;The opening 20 minutes had me on the edge of my seat, talking to the screen.
289;if 'life and death' isn't riveting enough for you, the casting is sublime.
290;good back and forth between both soldiers with some interestingcharacters thrown in to enhance it along the way.
291;jacques Annuad creates an elaborate and perfect atmosphere for this film, which takes place during World War II.
292;The film is based on a unique true story.
293;The film works better as a suspense thriller than a war film, but it indeed is great for its intensity.
294;Of course Saving Private Ryan remains the best or one of the best war films still and probably will continue to be.
295;definatly a good World war two movie, a worthy follow up to Saving Privat Ryan.
296;For what it's worth, this film deserves more credit than it is frequently given.
297;Should we make a film that accurately captures the battle of Stalingrad?
298;Should we, instead, focus on the wonderful story of these two rival snipers?
299;The opening is spectacular and moving.
300;And just in case you think I'm trying to demonize the Russian commanders, ENEMY AT THE GATES provides these men with plenty of motivation.
301;It is about the incredible struggle, based on true events, that occurred during the battle.
302;An expert marksmen and natural talent, Zaitsev stalks the German army, proving his skill time and time again.
303;For me, this is the most interesting storyline in the film.
304;Both Ed Harris and Jude Law have an intensity about them, often communicated only by turning the camera on their eyes, that is perfect for the silent nature of the sniping scenes.
305;The sniping scenes are expertly handled, the background sets of war.
306;torn Stalingrad are amazingly detailed and completely set the tone, and the tension and suspense of these scenes is high.
307;Instead, an infamous love triangle is introduced to the film to stir things up.
308;For one thing, it provides Zeitsev with motivation towards the end of the film.
309;He is fearless in his struggle against the Germans.
310;Furthermore, his love provides him ultimately with the confidence and determination to put an end to Knig, who has been seemingly invincible up until that point.
311;The love triangle provides Commisar Danilov with his ever.
312;This, in turn, only heightens our love of the protagonist, as his natural goodness is depicted side.
313;All that we know is that Vassili is good.
314;The truth is that no one ends up very good in this film, besides our two lovers.
315;ultimately, I enjoyed ENEMY AT THE GATES.
316;In fact, I enjoyed it more the second time I watched it.
317;It is focused on two men in the middle of that battle.
318;Every film must explore life's events through the eyes of a few characters.
319;While I wish the film could have focused even more on the sniping angle than it does, I believe it to be a respectable war film and one that is quite interesting.
320;It's done through the point of view of two of the soldiers, from their own perspective.
321;There are very interesting tactics involved in the shooting procedures that are made interesting and suspenseful throughout this tipped off by constant camera attention toward a portrait of Hitler.
322;acting performances were more than impressive for Jude Law, especially, and Ed Harris.
323;They brought a lot of realism to the table and they easily resembled the real soldiers at that time.
324;Sasha, the adolescent who serves as the spy, did a fairly good job.
325;When I first heard about Enemy at the Gate, I was intensely excited: one of my favorite directors (Jean.
326;jacques Arnaud, who produced such brilliant, intriguing, and engaging spectacles as Name of the Rose, The Bear, and Seven Years in Tibet) helming up a film about a sniper duel in the ruins of Stalingrad during the darkest days of World War II.
327;What was most exciting about the prospect of Enemy at the Gate, which deals with the same period, is the struggle between the Russian sniper Vasily Zaitzev (Jude Law) and his German counterpart and would.
328;had Arnaud stuck to the intricate game of cat.
329;tasty Rachel Weisz), and a Russian officer Danilov (played blandly by the overrated Joseph Fiennes).
330;As a result, the love.
331;when Arnaud centers on the duel between his protagonists, the movie is at its best.
332;and in these sequences, filmed amid the smoking ruins of Stalingrad, the film delivers.
333;Think the final conflict between Harris and Law is going to be exciting?
334;there are some sensational moments in the film: the scenes of German Stukas dive.
335;Arnaud also gets the feel of bombed.
336;The movie at the start has a broad focus, concentrating on the battle at the start of the film.
337;The performances by the main characters are all solid, and there are no major flaws or mistakes.
338;enthusiastic political commissar at the side of Zaitzev.
339;What happened in the movie is creative license.
340;mostly, this is a movie about the personal duel between 2 soldiers, played with admirable nuances by Jude Law and Ed Harris.
341;a very well done and entertaining film.
342;Of course the Russians are depicted as proud and brave, loyal to the Motherland, the Germans automata, if not outright buffoons.
343;this is a good movie for those that really didn't know what the Russian fighting men were meant to endure during World war two
344;Maybe oneof the best war movies ever made.
345;This one has to be seen to appreciate what the Russian front at Stalingrad was like in WWII.
346;The young boy, Sacha Fillipov, is also a true character who was hanged for his spying.
347;The movie is very good though, and has a very good look at the eastern front during WW2.
348;For another good movie about the eastern front, try Stalingrad by Wolfgang Petersen, it is a German movie, and is very good and accurate.
349;the Hunt For Red October was a real disapointment for such a good movie!
350;But they did a great job on this one!!!!
351;The picture is perfect and it is presented in true anamorphic wide screen.
352;The movie may not be the most accurate when it comes to history but it is still a very entertaining movie to watch Bob Hoskins as Kruschev He was perfect for the part .
353;The best line in the movie was spoken by Kruschev quote.
354;hour movie (and you go bankrupt in filming it!)
355;However, having lived in Russia for nearly two years as an English teacher, one comes to realize that most Russians who learn English in school learn British, and I have known many Russians with impeccable British English.
356;finally, yes, love did exist during the War.
357;In my honest opinion, I believe that the movies are on par with one another, with EAG being much more watchable.
358;the impression that this movie leaves you with is the right one.
359;Harris is a good actor.
360;i enjoyed the tale of Vassily and his girl Rachel Weisz (a plesant surprise because I didn't associate the name with the Mummy).
361;it was full of tense apprehension and a well developed story line.
362;this is a great look at the other front of the war, between the russians and the germans.
363;featuring a screenplay written and directed by Jean.
364;ENEMY OF THE GATES is a fictionalized story about the Russian sniper hero Vassili Zaitsev.
365;nagant rifle but also a symbol of success for the Russians in their use of training of snipers.
366;He immediately takes notice of a beautiful woman (Rachel Weisz).
367;nagant rifle, while the other carries ammunition.
368;Wherever Vassili shows up, the Russian soldiers are inspired to have him around.
369;That is where Vassili is reunited with the beautiful woman he saw when he first became a soldier.
370;His name is Major Erwin Konig (Ed Harris), an excellent sniper and the head of the German Army Sniper School.
371;Immediately, Vassili knows that Kong's precision and his way of hunting is excellent and feels that he may not be up to the job to take him on.
372;There is very good use of direction of sound from the ongoing bombings throughout the city which utilizes the low frequency of the subwoofer, then during scenes where there are many Russians around, you can hear those people talk in the fronts while dialogue is coming straight from the center speaker.
373;Sniper shots and rifle shots are also done well as you can hear the bullets zipping and hitting its target on impact.
374;sPECIAL FEATURES:ENEMY AT THE GATES features several informative special features which include:* Through the Crosshairs .
375;jacques Annaud, producers and talent.
376;How they wanted the right people to accomplish their goal for this film.
377;A very informative special feature.
378;jacques Annaud and the four major talent.
379;jUDGMENT CALL:ENEMY AT THE GATES is a very impressive war film.
380;This was filmed wonderfully!I was also impressed with the performances with all four major talents.
381;Jude Law did a great job as Vassili, and on one side we know he is the great sniper of Russia but when not on the battlefield, he was a man in love.
382;Ed Harris who plays the antagonist is just a wonderful actor and did a great job playing Major Konig.
383;And the performances by Rachel Weisz and Joseph Fiennes are absolutely fabulous.
384;if you take the film on its own as a fictionalized story, then you can probably enjoy the screenplay as it shows the bleakness of war but how, during war, love is found and how love was lost.
385;But its a powerful film that can be marred by the fact that certain scenes are embellished for the sake of the story.
386;For Russians who honor their war heroes and those who lost their lives at The Battle of Stalingrad, they have every right to have been upset with how the soldiers were depicted.
387;but this is a fictional film inspired from three pages of the original book by William Craig.
388;It's indeed a powerful film with strong images of war and a film featuring wonderful performances from the talent.
389;i enjoyed ENEMY AT THE GATES and I definitely recommend it on Blu.
390;The movie centers around the Russian sniper played by Jude Law and his rival German sniper (Ed Harris)The opening of the movie is good especially where it shows every other Russian soldier receiving a rifle due to short supply and his partner is to pick it up when the other is killed.
391;This is a really good movie good price and it shipped fast.
392;great form of history and it is action packed
393;This portrayal of the Seige of Stalingrad and the sniper duel between Russian and German aces is very gritty.
394;The demolished Stalingrad setting is very believable along with the usual horrific depictions of war.
395;I enjoyed the movie, despite the love story not gelling too well.
396;the Kiev protests and subsequentbehavior by Russia make this timely viewing.
397;This film is something of a complication.
398;Although I did enjoy it there are many arguments.
399;The almost all British cast (except Ed Harris) are top.
400;The real shiners in the cast are Jude Law .
401;The graphics are as good as can be wished for, plot interesting and probably one of the best war films around.
402;If however you like tacky, twisted plots (with lots of bangs), or even accurately followed historical events then this may not be for you, but nevertheless still worth watching.
403;This movie had some good looking battle sceanes and some well thought out sniper duels, that manage to make the movie watchable and kind of fun.
404;This production tried to have its cake and eat it too.
405;Enemy at the Gates tells the riveting tale of dueling snipers (one Russian and one German) during the Battle of Stalingrad.
406;The cast is excellent, the action is very well done, and the story is compelling.
407;I have watched this movie twice now, and enjoyed it both times.
408;I also like the fact that the story focuses on snipers, which are a fascinating component of combat.
409;If you enjoy WWII films, then I think you will like this one as well.
410;Enemy at the Gates brings to the screen a realistic depiction of the physical brutalities of war, doing for Stalingrad what Saving Private Ryan did for Normandy.
411;the fact that this is a full.
412;off between the German and Russian armies creates a massive amount of intensity and energy.
413;the recreation is brilliant, but as the movie moves on, its plot begins to hinder.
414;He uses this to make Vassili a hero in the eyes of soldiers and civilians alike, and soon Vassili is known and hailed by all he meets, including the strong.
415;place love story, both of which generate little sparks.
416;But these scenes become plentiful, and the more there are, the less intriguing they become as we await the final payoff.
417;Yes, love stories sometimes work as an emotional outlet for a much bigger event
418;jaques Annaud certainly has an eye for an effective war sequence.
419;The bloodshed is high, though does more in the film's favor than against it.
420;War has never been so realistic since Saving Private Ryan.
421;The cast does commendably well in their parts, though certain characters leave something to be desired.
422;Jude Law is convincing as the stern Vassili, and he shares just enough chemistry with Rachel Weisz so that the love story is believable on a physical level, at least.
423;Joseph Fiennes is enthusiastic as always, but my respect vanished for him by film's end.
424;Annaud has created a juggernaut, but I wonder is this is the kind he had in mind.
425;When this film works, it's a nail.
426;Enemy at the Gates is a strange mixture of absolutely tip.
427;top confrontation scenes (based around the duel of two snipers) and ho.
428;Maj. Koenig's scenes with Sacha (a Russian child who may or may not be a traitor) are also great, economical but illuminating.
429;These scenes are eminently memorable in my head, while my impression on the overall plot and character relationships remains fuzzy, at best.
430;the rewards of those great sniper scenes are worth the weak spots in between, so I'd still say this film is worth checking out.
431;but still enjoyable despite its flaws.
432;an amazing job of recreating a historic event.
433;Would highly recommend it (it was highly recommended to me).
434;The use of snipers by the Russians is very consistent with the book Stalingrad.
435;All the actors put in good performances particularly ed harris.
436;I particularly enjoyed the romance section of the film even if cliched
437;They are outstanding at what they do
438;This a gritty well acted and directed down in the mud and guts story set in WWII.
439;Follow the footsteps of a lowly soldier rising up to become his countries finest sniper.
440;I love this movie It's now in my collection
441;if you aren't such an historical purist that you can't accept some embellishments that are intended to broaden the interested audience, then you will enjoy the beauty of this film that is made about the Center of Hell.
442;cinematography: excellent, especially since most scenes were during dark winter months in dust.
443;resolution of all characters and ending: unforgettable.
444;this is now one of my favorite movies!
445;I recommend watching with a Russian friend, as I did.
446;i would love to think of some clever way to end my review to make myself look witty but the truth is, this movie is so pure and raw and wonderful that I just want to say WATCH IT!
447;No matter how evil, no matter how great the actor, a German major top sniper should speak German.
448;I think Ed Harris is among our greatest actors.
449;He does a magnificent job here, even hanging the young Russian boy who has acted as a double agent, appearing to be sympathetic to the German sniper sent to eliminated the great Soviet hero.3.
450;The ending of the film Stalingrad, in which the surviving whore of of the German officers is killed trying to save surviving Germans, is more believable.6.
451;Otherwise, I recommend Stalingrad (the German film), which is worth seeing, even if you are multitasking.8.
452;Extremely well acted and directed war film based on a non.
453;The story is based somewhat loosely on a real Russian sniper (and ultimately a national hero), Vasily Zaitsev.
454;Having an avid interest in WWII story.
455;telling films, I found that this movie gets almost all the details correct, including period Russian firearms and equipment.
456;Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Bob Hoskins, Joseph Fiennes, and Ed Harris turn in superior performances.
457;I'm giving this film five stars, not because it's a favorite of mine (although I liked it very much), but because it is a well.
458;A US pilot strays over forbidden area and get great spy pictures of mass graves.
459;right up there with Saving Private Ryan.
460;it's basically about the greatest Russian sniper who ever lived, Vassili Zaitsev.
461;This is perhaps the best WWII film I've seen this year, even better than Pearl Harbor I must add!Jude Law's portrayal of Sergeant Vassili is so real, you could feel his determination and courage in fighting the seemingly lost cause of Fatherland Stalingrad in his eyes.
462;the cinematography of the movie is brilliant thanks to Jean.
463;joseph Fiennes also put up a great performance as Commissar Danilov who falls for the same woman as Vassili.
464;Ed Harris' portrayal of Nazi Major Erwin Konig is a cunning and worthy nemesis of Vassili.
465;this is one good war movie to watch and if anything, the movie teaches one to believe in one's ability to contribute to a greater cause when all seems lost.
466;greatly directed, amazing artistical direction, outstanding edition.
467;Great for Annaud, this one deserves all prizes.
468;If you have interest in the Second World War, this story will intice you .
469;it is one of the very few movies made about the Eastern Front, and the equipment, cinematography and setting are first rate.
470;There seems to be some controversy about whether Koenig was killed after being sent to shoot the Russian sniper Zaitchev, but the story is gripping and believable.
471;for Westerners trying to make a Russian movie, this is a great success.
472;The best sniper movie of all time that I've seen.
473;I would highly recommended it to others to see.
474;The story line developed within thick fabric of Russian defense of Stalingrad (during WWII) and made it more colorful than average 'sniper' movies.
475;it's an awesome movie .
476;gave it five stars ,cause the action was good.
477;and I would recommend it to men that understand war , if you like a good war movie .
478;The idea of making a movie about the eastern flank battles in WWII is interesting and welcomed on its own .
479;In my opinion , what they had decided to do here was to ride success wave of Saving Private Ryan (SPR) .
480;somebody wanted to make some money and found a way : let's take a good part of SPR .
481;concentrate and develop his contribution to the war efforts .
482;His Part , like all the others' is without soul or depth .
483;I placed my order on a Friday and it arrived at my house on Monday.
484;It was the quickest delivery I've received, and the price was amazing.
485;I will definitely be reminded of my high school days while now being a junior/senior in college.
486;The picture, the sound, the clarity.
487;The movie is something that I find interesting.
488;It deals with a true story.
489;so what makes this movie so good?
490;First off, the acting is excellent.
491;coming Jude Law to the very underrated Ed Harris.
492;okay, enough of all these compliments.
493;About my only complaint is the love story.
494;so, if you want a good movie, get this.
495;Based on surface look alone, Enemy at the Gates is an impressive production with excellent visuals and a high.
496;gates does begin in a very promising fashion.
497;The rest of the film is a game of cat.
498;True, the sniper hunts are fairly riveting in a visceral manner, but never truly engaging because you don't feel for the protagonist.
499;ed Harris, unsurprisingly, fares much better as the villain of the picture.
500;the film never works as an anti.
501;For all the elements I listed above, you can find more effective films that employ them with more precision and entertainment value.
502;I found Enemy at the Gates to be an impressive war movie.
503;Unlike S. p. r., Enemy relies heavily on its gradually intensifying and emotional storyline, which to some may make the movie seem to drag, but is a breath of fresh air to those of us who appreciate good writing, character development, and convincing actors.
504;I also found the films evolving romantic elements to be consistent with the rest of the movie, not overbearing it to the point of distraction (as in Pearl Harbor).
505;Evenly dispersed throughout the movie are some impressive bombing and battle sequences, as well as some brillantly choreographed sniper encounters.
506;The bombing sequences are simply stunning, delivering in boatloads the take.you.
507;So with this in mind and judging by its high sales, it is no wonder then that Enemy at the Gates has gained a newfound puplic appreciation, an appreciation I most definitely share.
508;When going into this film it is best to remember that it is a fictional story based on the Battle of Stalingrad.
509;I also wished the characters would have acted more Russian.
510;all in all Enemy at the Gates is entertaining it does have its flaws but as long as you are willing to look past them the movie is worth a watch.
511;still, worth watching and very interesting.
512;i enjoyed this movie love and alot of war in stalingrad would reccomend to watch this movie if you like world war 2 movies.
513;This is an amazing movie.
514;Best war film ever after PLATOON and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.
515;I am very pleased with this movie.
516;When I first saw this film in the movies, I was really.
517;stunned by the reality of the scene, the realization of how brave the soldiers were when two had to share one weapon against an almost unbeatable enemy.
518;as I was saying, realistic .
519;I now own the movie and I got used to it and every time I watch it, it seems better and better, more touching every time.
520;One of them is Vasilij Zaitsev, who shoots so well (especially a sniper, who waits silently until the right time for shooting) that he's a menace to the German officers.
521;They're great friends in the beginning.
522;So all this is bound into the thrilling epic movie Enemy At The Gates, with times of tension and suspense as the two snipers wait for each other to appear and for the right moment to give the other one a last second of life, at times touching and moving because of the Russian spirit, the love that Tanya and Vasilij shared, the realism of the movie which is hard to portray .
523;it will only move you to various emotions which you will experience throughout the movie.
524;I can tell you I'm really thrilled and I'm happy to have the video at home.
525;Besides that this movie is well reccomended.
526;A pleasant surprise came with Enemy at the Gates directed by the French director Jean.
527;my critic also goes in a similar way to that I made to Saving Private Ryan .
528;sided view of the battle and here Annaud losses a great opportunity.
529;Rachel Weisz is Tani Chernova, another sharpshooter and Vassili's love.
530;the cat and mouse game which many seem to dislike is the best part.
531;The backdrop is impressive, fighting among the ruins of a once great city.
532;This was some of the most savage fighting of the war and it is accurately depicted.
533;The beginning is very well done, then the only interesting parts are the cat.
534;Luckily, I recorded it from TV.
535;Anyway, good actors without all the bravado one sees in war movies.
536;Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) is an extraordinary marksman, pressed into service as a sniper in the Soviet army.
537;The result is a deadly game of cat and mouse where the lines between predator and prey blur.
538;The film is generally well directed with an authentic wartime feel to it.
539;While some have criticized it for looking too much like Saving Private Ryan, I feel such a comparison is a compliment.
540;Using outstanding cinematography as a model, and coming close to duplicating it is a positive, not a negative.
541;jude Law gives a fine follow.
542;up to his outstanding performance in The Talented Mr. Ripley showing that he is here to stay.
543;He strikes an excellent balance between Vassili's sense of duty and reluctance to be a hero, showing a character that is compelled to be courageous when he is really scared.
544;Joseph Fiennes is also very good, although his is another role that is overemphasized needlessly.
545;this is a very good film that lost its opportunity to be great because of Annaud's inexplicable need to wander from a terrific storyline.
546;It is a good wartime thriller worth a look.
547;The movie is a cat mouse game between these two experts with both countries depending on their respective man to win.
548;The product received was as advertised and was received within the allotted time frame.
549;Great WW II war film with an all star cast.
550;As an English Eastern Front enthusiast I was very pleased with Enemy At The Gates.
551;A film like this addresses this issue and brings to the film.
552;The opening action scene I felt was more compelling, grandiose and spine.
553;This is a great movie .
554;I loved this movie .
555;It is so great .
556;Has a little sad parts in it and good action scenes thatll have you on your feet waiting to see whats bound to happen .
557;Its my favorite war movie of all time .
558;The movie and it's special effects are true to the event.
559;Bob Hoskins is excellent as a younger Nikita Kruschev who plays Stalin's personal political representative on site.
560;excellent review of politics they are all dirtbags .
561;Forgotten history is usual the most interesting.
562;Captured is part of the tremendous suffering due to war during the battle of Stalingrad.
563;the characters are rich and full.
564;The sniper, a solider drunk with his sniper rifle, is also a 20th centuries invention.
565;This makes the film a good but solemn and even at times gruesome watch.
566;An amazing visible historic tale of heroism.
567;Incredible cinematography, acting, and drama.
568;I am a big movie lover, and on top of that I am also a big history buff.
569;the last thing I think I would have to mentioned are the actors, which perform their roles with a genuine feel that accentuates the tense foreboding of their character's times.
570;I recommend it to anyone that enjoys war movies, or well made movies in general.
571;This is a really sharp film.
572;It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
573;The acting was first rate Ed Harris and Jude Law really lived their roles.
574;Solid acting and a pretty good story based on some true events.
575;If you like WWII movies you will like this.
576;Really gives you a sense of the brutality of the battle for Stalingrad and the famous Mosin Nagant ans Mauser rifles.
577;Excellent story based on a true Russian hero and a three day cat and mouse duel between himself and a German sniper.
578;Great acting, good storyline, and realistic background and battlefield scenes.
579;This totally destroys the pace of the film and detracts from its main subject.
580;The only emotion felt, is delivered by James Horner's score during the scenes when the two men actually do confront each other.
581;One of the better movies about world war two.
582;I've seen it a couple times and bought it to share with my girl friend.
583;The interviews with the actor is good, because this movie has GOOD actors, real actors.
584;i enjoyment in cinema, and now i enjoy in my house.
585;Add love interest in the form of Tania Chernova (Rachel Weisz) and a triangle with Commissar/friend Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) and the potential was there for an adult love story (and I dont mean the XXX variety) set against a truly epic backdrop.
586;The recreation of the devastated city is truly awesome.
587;Cold, yet burning, strewn with corpses and piled with rubble, the city itself becomes the most powerful character on the screen.
588;nothing serves to tie the events together into a convincing narrative, which, considering that the most important battle of the Second World War is taking place, exhibits extreme laziness on the part of the script writer and the director.
589;which brings us to the overall ambivalent treatment of the historical setting.
590;But their is an overall disregard for the historical context of the setting.
591;The true story of the battle of Stalingrad is so dramatic that if the film had followed the historical tension closely, a much more gripping film would have been the result.
592;As it is we are left with a spectacular looking film (there has got to be an Oscar in there somewhere for set design) with some masterful moments and some relevant comments on the nature of tyranny and war.
593;If only it had had a scriptIt really only deserves 2.5 stars but for the magnificent set and the subject matter.
594;watch it if you want, just make sure you watch Klimov's Come and See
595;I recommended this movie before I saw it based on the incredible documentary of this true story on the history channel.
596;I don't remember the name of the documentary on the history channel, but if you're lucky you'll find it here or on another service and will be able to stream it to your TV.
597;The first thing this film definitely deserves credit for is the fact that it presents a WWII story from a POV that definitely hasn't been explored enough in film (the Russian perspective).
598;they are simply portrayed as protagonists in a desperate conflict.
599;As a movie about the battle of Stalingrad itself, this film is good but not great.
600;The sets are great and the opening battle gives you an idea of just how desperate a situation the Soviet troops were in (and why their valiant efforts at Stalingrad should be tributed).
601;Nevertheless, the sniper battles were very well done and the atmosphere was conveyed very well.
602;I also felt that the plot (about the russian sniper who must bear the unwilling burden of being a heroic symbol for his people, despite his own fears and limitations), made a very touching example of wartime sacrifice.
603;Instead it turns out as a very well executed, albeit conventional war film.
604;I am a true story fan of all sorts.
605;This was a very well done film from the Russian perspective in WWII.
606;I like WWII movies and this one is very interesting and a lot of actions.
607;Husband wishes he could rate it thirty stars.
608;This movie is a great insight into the battle of Stalingrad and the first 10 minutes of the movie grab your attention right out of the gates.
609;The movie is based on a real life sniper at the time and is very well acted out on both sides.
610;This is an absolutely must have for any fan of WW2 history!
611;He is a enormous and talented director and something happened behind the original script or the editing process .
612;in fact , the captivating and intriguing search is the central dramatic nervous of the film .
613;Ed Harris and Jude law are top notch each one in his respective roles.
614;In the ends it turns into a cat and mouse game between the Russian sniper and a German colonel sniper.
615;The German is a bit older and has more experience, but the Russian has good instincts.
616;There is some romance, and one scene of the Russian making love in to a women in foxhole type conditions.
617;The Russian was a real person and the women was also a real person.
618;A lot of the circumstances actually occurred.
619;I enjoyed it, my wife and I watch it every now and again if there's nothing new to see.
620;The drama was intense and the movie always has you on the edge of your seat, even when the charecters are staying still.
621;It has something for everyone .
622;One of the greatest things about this movie as well is that it's an excellent view of the Russian front during World War II.
623;i was so looking forward to this film yet I have to say I came away a bit dissappointed with it.
624;having read Anthony Beevoirs book I can well believe it.
625;so to make a film on this was obviously going to be a very ambitious project and ultimately I think Jean.
626;the film sets are terrific and some of the battle scenes are very realistic.
627;creation of Stalingrad was also very impressive.
628;the Russian sniper,Zaitsev,played by Jude Law has become a hero to the Russian troops.
629;his fortunes are so important that they dictate the morale of the Russian soldiers.
630;the German's are anxious to eliminate him so they send over their top marksman Koenig,played by Ed Harris to do the job.
631;at first the duels and close shaves between these two characters are quite interesting and tense.
632;this enrages Joseph Fiennes who is also in love with her himself.
633;the detailed recreation of the city is quite amazing though.
634;the rubble on the streets,the derilict buildings and the mud everywhere feel is quite impressive.
635;so all in all I don't think this movie ever really flows at all.
636;it has it's high points and moments of drama but overall I was a bit dissappointed in it.
637;I had high hopes for this because I usually love Jude Law movies.
638;Some nice score, some cool sound effects for your home theatre system, but that's about it.
639;I found this book to be enthralling and would have rated it 5 out of 5.
640;The difference between the book and the movie is that the book focuses on the entire battle, while the movies focus is on the duel between the two top snipers, the Russian Vassili Zaitsev and the German Major Koenig.
641;But these flaws were redeemed by the fantastic action sequences and amazing sounds and computer imaging.
642;I found the movie thrilling and wonderful and, out of 10, I would give it a 9.5.
643;This is an interesting and very good movie, I totally recommend watch this movie.
644;and is a true story.
645;VERY INTERESTING and FOCUSED FILM.
646;but each does his duty
647;The creators' ignorance is amazing.
648;sure, there is occasional decent acting and some special effects, though the effects are much less convincing than those in much older Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down.
649;This film will undoubtedly make you think.
650;But believe me, you will be.
651;along with exceptional filming skills.
652;He eventually meets up with journalist Danilov (Shakespere in Love) who builds up Vassili into a Russian hero in order to provide hope to the people of their country.
653;He uses the likes of a child to get to him and it'll make you sick enough to want to kill Ed Harris, despite the amazing man he is in real life .
654;that's how good he plays this character.
655;look in Hollywood and should most definitely be given its recognition at the Oscars next year.
656;Yet it is a great story about humanity and the impossibility of ideological Communism (even if everyone is equal, there will be always something to be envied).
657;The cast is great, and while this is a graphic war.
658;drama, it is a love story under impossible circumstances as well.
659;The opening scenes of the movie are incredibly accurate and well handled, portraying the hysterical shoveling of untrained soldiery into a desperate struggle to retain control of Stalingrad.
660;from here the action shrinks from epic to a more personal level as we meet the protagonists.
661;Jude Law is appropriately noble and down.
662;Joe Fiennes' betrayal of Vasily is all the more appropriate as he represents the corrupt Communist leadership.
663;the duel, the love triangle, the tragic child, and so forth.
664;despite all this it's a watchable film with good action sequences and a reasonable story line.
665;It's also beautiful on the big screen
666;Truly an excellent movie
667;This one is REALLY good.
668;Historically accurate and well done.
669;I would recommend it to anyone interested in the period and topic.
670;You can see that Spielberg puts to the screen exactly what his story needs,(and more), and Mr Annaud fails.
671;lastly, the uniforms and weapons used in the movie are also historically accurate.
672;enemy At The Gates is acted well by all of the cast.
673;The problems begin with the suspense.
674;In a film like this you should have great feeling of suspense, afterall it's a duel between two hihgly skilled snipers.
675;special Features include a Widescreen version enhanced for 16:9 television sets.
676;bottom Line:Enemy At The Gates is a good film.
677;I still enjoyed this film.
678;Case in point Enemy At The Gates is a good war film, with subtle sub.
679;I would recommend this film to anyone who liked Saving Private Ryan, because this is the Russian version of the underdog heroes.
680;Awesome movie, graphic as it gets.
681;The only reason I gave this film two stars is because of the interesting and suspenseful non.
682;The part of Khrushchev played by Bob Hoskins is quite notable as when he arrives at Stalingrad by boat to stiffen the resolve of the Russian troops he looks and acts almost like Khrushchev, he is quite noticeable if one knows what the future leader of Russia looked like.
683;He certainly plays the role well in the speeches he gives, although no one really knows what he said.
684;Ed Harris is especially good as the German sniper who comes to Stalingrad to find and kill the Russian sniper.
685;He is as cool and deliberative as you would expect from a German(SS) sniper.
686;Finny is very cool and humble about his gift as a good sniper who grew up on the Siberian plains with his grandfather having taught him how to hide and shoot the wolves, and hide he does on the Russian front.
687;His friend and college and political commissar helps his career by making him a hero by using the power of the Soviet press to highlight it.
688;A really well done film that was nominated for several Oscars Including supporting actor for Ed Harris, best picture, etc.
689;But he highest award it got was for original screen play.
690;It is great to see Hollywood crank out a WWII movie set in the Soviet Union.
691;if you want perfect accounts of history, read a book.
692;if you can get past that however, you'll love the beautiful scenery, the great sound and story.
693;I want to love this film.
694;There are moments when I really do .
695;Stalingrad was the place that the Nazi irresistible force met the unyielding Soviet resolve .
696;Still, in the modern cannon of war films, this manages to deliver a few great moments, a stunning score, and some nods to actual events.
697;For those interested, I recommend the book Stalingrad by Anthony Beevor, and then consider this as a fine piece of 21st century propaganda.
698;very well done, with a portrayal of Kruschev sent to the city by Stalin to fix things.
699;This is one great movie.You get to see how the Germans and Russians fought each other during WWII in this true story of a Russian sniper, his love affair, and a German sniper.
700;stay with the movie, It's long but has a great ending.
701;What really sets this apart from other movies is the non.
702;In this it is probably an accurate portrayal of a city and an army under siege.
703;I found it to be a great aid to understanding the nature of the war in the east.
704;the battle for Stalingrad was one of the bloodiest and most important conflicts in one of the bloodiest and most important conflicts in history.
705;proud city on the Volga was destroyed, providing the perfect setting for snipers to pick off enemy soldiers and weaken morale.
706;The set design is nothing short of brilliant, and at no point does the veiwer feel that he or she is not right in the center of a bombed.
707;equipped Soviet troops charging the entrenched German army, is brilliant and one of the best even put to film.
708;When I saw it I thought it was the Hokiest movie I have seen in years.
709;The two snipers were well cast and did fine jobs of acting.
710;Wartime footage shows the sun actually shining some during the Stalingrad campaign, though most of the action was set at night.
711;There are advantages to daytime sniping, and that would have helped the overall drearyness of the movie.
712;Even though I really liked the Russian sniper, the movie leads one to favor the German sniper and his side in general.
713;Enemy is great because you're dealing with the creation of and separating the differences between idols and heroes based on their faith, beliefs and their values.
714;In the process, Vasilli sees the champion/Konig in action first hand and is awed by his already incredible skill, making him become a little kid again, unsure if he can even beat him now.
715;As for the love interest,.
716;But seriously, you feel for everyone in this film and I think that's what really makes this film work so well.
717;Except Sasha, I was actually very happy when the Major finally killed him off.
718;I thought he was a real piece of sh@# to begin with and he would just grow up and become an adult like that.
719;So when he did meet his untimely end, I actually had a nice, big, smile on my face.
720;serves him right I thought.
721;I know a lot of women who have seen this film and they all tell me that the sex scene between Rachel Weitz and Jude Law is one of the hottest scenes they've ever seen and I've heard quite a few say that it's even one of their favorites!
722;If you want your girl to think you have a heart and.
723;Besides that, she'll (temporarily at least), think you're smart and courageous like Vasilli and the sex scene will keep her happy and.
724;Grreat Move and an even greater movie because of it!
725;Great film about the WW2 battle of Stalingrad and how a sniper (Jude Law) halted the Germans from taking the CITY.
726;It's truly marvelous that they've made a World War II movie on the eastern front.
727;the acting was very good although there should have been richer dialogue.
728;This movie mostly follows the movement of the two men, which was highly entertaining.
729;overall, this movie was very dark and it sort of mixed the sadness with the triumph.
730;i still give it five stars
731;Although I had seen this movie before, I thought that Ed Harris should have at least attempted to speak with an accent.
732;This film captures the essence of the sniper so greatly, at least in my opinion.
733;All of it is depicted wonderfully.
734;Much of this is due to the fact that the cast was taught by an actual sharpshooter.
735;The whole movie is basically a dramatic story of courage and heroics.
736;You have the hero, Vasille with the gift of aim and courage,and the man who makes him famous played by Joseph Fiennes.
737;I wouldn't really call it a triangle since Law and Weisz are the ones in love.
738;As the movie comes to a close, you see that the love story was actually essential since the two friends develop a hate for each other that is eventually reconsiled.
739;There are many twists in the movie that make your jaw drop.
740;I just love this movie.
741;this is and excellent film that contains the very essence of what war was like for the russians.
742;it is a very good film that you should take your kids to see as long as you cover their eyes in the parts that contain sexual content.
743;You should only take your kids to this if you know they are mature enough to see such a film as this one because other then sexual content it contains very graphic displays of warfare.
744;Producers and screenwriters of historical films always like to twist the truth a bit to make this type of film more dramatic.
745;Whoever coordinated the blood spattering must have liked the neck, because we see many neck wounds, and as the boats cross, we see a boat full of blood.
746;The performances could have been much better, while the special effects are just right.
747;Horner's score is the bright spot of the film, with a great suite repeated throughout.
748;Its a gripping plot based upon a true story.
749;it succeeds in creating a realistic feel of what Stalingrad would have been like at that time, although without depicting the extreme cold weather.
750;I guess the pitch meeting made it look great: a tragic love story during one of the worst (or the worst) states of siege in WWII, battles that made many of the other ones look like a game, Jude Law, Ed Harris, the gorgeous Rachel Weisz.
751;I belive this is one of the few war movies I actually enjoyed.
752;Everyone is complaining that it had to much of a love story, but considering the plot is about a love story, that is kinda fitting.
753;Sure, it isn't as action packed as Saving Private Ryan, but it is definately an enjoyable film in it's own right.
754;It's beautifully directed, I mean the visual style of the whole film is awe inspiring.
755;style directing used, reminicent of Luc Besson, although he is still the best French director.
756;The acting is superb, even if they do have English accents, who cares?
757;This is less of an all out war film than Private ryan, but I enjoyed it's subdued, almost mellow pace.
758;The action scenes between the snipers are cleverly done and quite hair raising.
759;I reccomend this to anyone who enjoys movies like Shakepeare in Love, and war aficianados may enjoy it as well.
760;The ruins of the city of Stalingrad stands as a symbol of Russia's brave resistance and Hitler's army is determined to capture it.
761;this was a great movie.
762;It was exciting and tense to watch Konig and Vassili try to outmaneuver each other.
763;The film also shows the patience and dedication it takes to be a successful sniper.
764;The audio is excellent and is one of the best DD 5.1 mixes I have heard.
765;If you are a fan of war films this is highly recommended.
766;I have seen this before and enjoyed it just as much the seond time around.
767;Love the story and the casting.
768;This by far is my favorite World War II film.
769;Everything about the film is done in a surperb fashion.
770;This is one of the best moves I have ever seen about the Russian Snipers of World war two.
771;Very powerful movie I've always enjoyed and now, my daughter is doing a report on the same.
772;Thank goodness for continued excellent movie making !!!
773;This is a movie that will certainly hold your attention and focuses on other aspects that certainly do occur during any war.
774;So, come on writers/directors, make something new.
775;I enjoy historic movies, but can never understand one thing.
776;As a movie though it is VERY good.
777;The opening scene when the inexperienced Russians are thrown against the Nazi War Machine is every bit as good as 'Saving Private Ryan's' opening D. day scene.
778;There is a love triangle too in this flick, I thought it unneccesary, but it kept the movie flowing between hunting/hunted scenes.
779;I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a World War II movie without the over.
780;It is so gratifying to finally see a major motion picture made about the WWII Russian Front.
781;_Enemy at the Gates_ is a movie of epic proportions, featuring good overall performances by a solid cast as well as a spectacular cinematic recreation of the bombed.
782;Saving Private Ryan succeeded in telling much of the story of the Normandy invasion in a way that neatly complimented the movies plot.
783;The opening sequence of the Volga crossing is powerful filmmaking and is mostly accurate up until Zaitsev and his fellow soldiers enter the city.
784;the Soviet characters all share the names of actual people, but none are true to their real.
785;Somewhat accurate in technical and historical detail.
786;The film shows perfectly the tragical times suffered during the war.
787;The role of the the actors is superb, forcing the public to follow with constant expectation the next scenes.
788;It's a cat and mouse confrontation depicted with startling realism, though, in this case, the mouse is just as deadly as the cat.
789;the film, set among the rubble and destroyed factories of Stalin's city, is visually stunning.
790;The performances of Law, Harris and Fiennes are excellent, as is that by Bob Hoskins, who plays Joe Stalin's political representative on the scene, Nikita Krushchev.
791;If you're interested in this footnote to the Stalingrad struggle, the book is a must, and the film will serve as excellent visual reinforcement.
792;I have never figured out why some really good movies, such as this one, are never replayed on TV/Cable.
793;This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to end.
794;I believe this movies shows the horror of war as much as the human side as well.
795;On the plus side, the director did an excellent job of capturing the essence of the hell on Earth that was Stalingrad.
796;The acting, for the most part, is very good (although I thought Ed Harris was a little wooden as the German marksman Maj. Konig), and the special effects were outstanding.
797;But all in all, Enemy At The Gates is a gripping, well.
798;This movie is based on a true story about a Russian WWII Sniper.
799;If you like these type of movies, this is a must see !
800;Great movie, captures the brutal do or die defense of Stalingrad when two totalitarian states are locked in a life and death struggle.
801;Superb performance by Jude Law and Ed Harris.
802;Enemy at the gates is a ultimate war epic film the best i seen since Saving Private Ryan , a cutting edge type,that will keep you at the edge of your seat thru the entire film, suspensful, and has high tech special effects, and great images of war.
803;(Jude Law) is the heroic russian sniper , (Ed Harris) is the more intelligent and proffesional nazi sniper, both are hired to take each other down, based on historical facts, this film is one of the best made war films of all time with an unforgettable cast,performances,screenplay and war scenes .
804;i guarantee you'll enjoy this film .
805;The director made a few changes in the fates of individuals, added a political officer in the mix to good effect and generally did a good job.
806;One in the meeting with Nikita K of political officers where one wets his pants and another when Ed Harris (as Maj. Konig, an Oscar worthy performance!)
807;It is still an effective picture.
808;It is still good and makes for an entertaining semi.
809;Not seeing much of the Eastern Front portrayed in movies, I found it fascinating.
810;What drags the movie a little IS the romantic subplot, but the other subplot about the German sniper and the Russian boy was actually very interesting.
811;Not the greatest war movie, but certainly fresh and much needed.
812;accurate this movie's time lap is, but like all hollywood movies, non of them set to be accurate at all, i think it's a great movie, it has a nice action scene, great snipping scenes and a love story, but i mostly got it because of the mosin nagant that appears on it.
813;I believe Hollywood should outsource its big money to an European production to hire authentic German and Russian actors and maybe one of the great Polish directors.
814;Obiously the objective of Hollywood is to entertain .
815;The Russians were expert at street fighting and outfought the Germans using innovative tactics that the Germans never successfully countered.
816;As far as women were concerned, the Russians had special sniper schools for women and in fact several women won the highest award of the Hero of the Soviet Union.
817;If you want to see a more realistic movie on the fighting in Stalingrad, I highly recommend the 1991 German film Stalingrad with English subtitles.
818;In my opinion, movies like Enemy at the Gates are worth watching simply because it helps educate a generation that is far too self absorbed.
819;still this an interesting story and worth your time and attention.
820;The movie did do a credible job in giving the view a true.
821;Jude Law was quite convincing as Vassily Zaitzev, and Ed Harris also did a yeoman's job as German Major Konig.
822;Other great actors in this film: Rachel Weisz as Zaitzev's Russian woman soldier love interst, and Joseph Fiennes(Danilov) as Zaitzev's political officer who puffs him for Russian Consumption.
823;This, my friends, is acting.
824;When Danilov tells Khruschev that yes, he knows a hero who can provide such hope, a sharpshooter who was able to kill five Germans one right after the other in order to save the officer and himself, a smile literally creeps across the senior officer's face.
825;Jude Law does well too, although he's a young'n here with room to grow.
826;(The scary thing is, given Stalingrad's remarkable victory, its Comissars' propoganda may have actually done some good.)
827;This is an excellent movie.
828;The book about these two snipers is also a great read.
829;I do not remember the title of the book but I may hunt it up and read it again.
830;I suppose they won in the end.
831;As another reviewer pointed out, it is difficult to decide whether you root for anyone when it's a Hitler versus Stalin match, but the film itself is exceptionally well done.
832;Although the ebb and flow of the battle is lost in the context of the story of the two snipers, the film holds your attention to the end, wondering who will win the game of cat and mouse being played out in the midst of one of history's most horrific battles.
833;That in itself is a real shocker.
834;This a great WWII film.
835;Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Ed Harris, and Rachel Weisz make a great team.
836;It's an amazing film with plenty of action, suspense, and major drama.
837;I really liked this movie.
838;This cat and mouse game of two snipers is worth a look.
839;It is a good overall story, though, and the realism was pretty good.
840;This movie is great if you have a love for WWII history, in particular the Russian/German aspect of the war.
841;If you are a firearms lover, and have a fondness for the Mosin Nagant, you are REALLY going to love this movie.
842;Well written, well acted, well worth the price.
843;What an amazing movie, two superior snipers control the battle of a city.
844;Into this epic struggle between the desperate Soviets and the overextended Nazis plunges our hero, Vassili Zaitsev, fresh from the Urals and played by Jude Law.
845;vassili is an excellent shot and he's clever.
846;Danilov and Vassili's friendship is tested by their common desire for beautiful Tanya, a fellow soldier.
847;Daniliv feels a special desire for her since they are both Jewish, but she is more drawn to Vassili's bravery.
848;This is played up by Daniliv as an epic class struggle in the best tradition of Soviet propaganda.
849;The movie moves to its conclusion with the struggle between and Vassily and Konig and the love triangle involving Vassily, Daniliv and Tanya as the central elements.
850;Seriously, it was great to see history portrayed from a non.
851;Bought this because I caught the very end of it on late night TV one night and it looked great.
852;I liked Ron Pearlman's character.
853;Although the movie is (unstandably) not as involved as the book, Enemy at the Gates is a very good movie.
854;It has substantial information and a good cast.
855;It also shows the determination of the Russian people that survived and fought against the invaders.
856;I long waited to watch this film.
857;Saving Private Ryan is the pinacle of the cinema.
858;The only line , which must be met with laughter , is about Kruzhev.
859;I was left with mixed feelings about this movie
860;Well, this certainly was a breath of fresh air, considering all the ready.
861;oiled machinery was convincingly portrayed.
862;This is a well acted movie with Jude Law and Ed Harris.
863;Great movie a must own.
864;Great storyline that shows the strength and weakness in the characters.
865;This was a really intense and interesting movie.
866;I thoroughly enjoyed the action and suspense.
867;I was also shocked to see how well it parralled the video game .
868;good plot and was true.
869;scences were great, action and suspense was good
870;This movie captures the political and military realities of that period.
871;Rule number one Hollywood when it comes to War movies, leave out the love stories.
872;The first and and last part of the movie is five stars plus.
873;For those that would love history and adventure this is truly a great video.
874;It is truly The most triumphant war movie since 'Saving Private Ryan' .
875;the story is based on a true story of a Russian sniper against the best of the German snipers focused on the battle of Stalingrad.
876;The setting is very interesting and there is a short commentary on how the movie was created at the end of the video that is truly worth the viewing.
877;the choice of actors is really superb with Jude Law playing the part of the Russian sniper Vassili Zaitsev, and Ed Harris as the German sniper.
878;Enemy At The Gates was an excellent and carefully planned war film.
879;I have read an incredible amount of negative reviews on this movie and I can say just one thing about it .
880;it's one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, because it is realistic .
881;the setting of the film is wonderful .
882;The actors are all wonderful .
883;their intensity and psychological emotions are shown right there in their faces.
884;I think the actors have done an excellent job on making this movie come alive and seem real .
885;the story is definitely interesting and original as well.
886;It depicts a duel between two excellent snipers, Konig and Zaitsev.
887;Just see it for yourself and you will see what I am talking about!
888;Go for it and watch it .
889;confessed WW II buff (for reasons that should be obvious from my byline), I found the movie to be about as historically accurate as they come, with an unusual attention to detail (from authentical tanks down to the rags wrapped around rifles to keep one's hands from freezing to the metal).
890;Cinematography does a great job of showing the grisliness and unglorious side of war in general and this type of urban warfare in particular, and the actors put in good to excellent performances.
891;But the best performance I saw was that of Ed Harris, playing the antagonist, depicted in some historical accounts (and in the movie) as a German army major named Koenig or Koenigs (head of the sniper school at Zossen in former East Germany), and in other accounts as an SS.
892;This movie was recommended by a friend and turned out to be everything he said it was.
893;Thoroughly enjoyed it and was very pleased with how quickly it came from Amazon.
894;This 2001 war movie brings WW2 to audiences from a unique perspective for Americans .
895;Each one gives an impressive performance.
896;the battle scenes are excellent, the cruelty of war clearly demonstrated, especially in the scenes when the Russians shoot their own men for running away.
897;There's a lot of blood and it is all very real and gruesome.
898;This sets the stage for the rest of the story, which is quite gripping, especially as the two sharpshooters are locked in a cat and mouse game throughout most of the film.
899;At those times, my eyes were glued to the screen, feeling the tension as well as the hardships that the Russians endured.
900;The story was a good one though and could have stood on its own without all that extra stuff.
901;I did thoroughly enjoy the video, however, and recommend it for war film buffs, especially for those who might want to explore this rarely explored part of history.
902;The film has its weaknesses, but it is still worth watching.
903;He enjoyed it vey much.
904;Entertaining film about a Russian and German sniper with the ruthlessness that occured during WWII.
905;all aspect of the film is superbly and carefully crafted, with a brillant performances from the actors, a touch of romance and realistic battle scenes this is a film that will make you remember for a long time.
906;a great film speaks for itself.
907;I think that Enemy at the Gates is the greatest movie ever!
908;I love it so much, and I dream about it every night.
909;It is a movie you don't forget, because it's the best!
910;The actors are so good, and the background is great, and the story is so hilarious and beautiful and great!!!!
911;I love the movie, and I can see it on and on again!
912;See the Moscow Times for a review: Made in Germany, directed by a Frenchman .
913;This movie shows a pivotal moment in Russian history.
914;It shows the Russian military during a very important moment in World War II.
915;This movie is very good.
916;This is a great movie.
917;The cinematography and special effects are commendable.
918;Jude Law does an very good job in the lead role and he proves to be well supported by his supporting cast members like Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Wiesz and Ed Harris.
919;The romance angle was not bad as Rachel Weisz provided an interesting character.
920;Their love scene among the dirty sleeping soldiers in the bunker add a certain level of reality to their situation.
921;Ed Harris provides an interesting and challenging foe as an ace German sniper whose ego regarded his duel with Vassili like a game.
922;I thought the movie was pretty entertaining as both sides play their cat and mouse game as the story unfold.
923;i thought this was one of the underrated World War II movies that came out in our recent years.
924;This is a must see movie.
925;This movie is epic and a must have for any video library or war movie collection.
926;Great film for learning some good sniper history.
927;One of the very best war movies for capturing the feel of the battle.
928;The story is riveting, the acting is excellent, the reconstruction of the atmosphere of the battle of Stalingrad brings thrills along your spine, and you can feel the tension and the adrenaline pumping up.
929;The idea of presenting a more intimate angle of the battle by making it a game of cat and mouse between two snipers with a personal war of eyes is awesome, and the viewer is exposed to a series of sniper techniques that alone are worth the whole movie.
930;rich in love and poor in love.
931;Yes, the plot of this movie is fiction.
932;Zietzev arrived in Staligrad an accomplished sniper with a well.
933;Hundreds of snipers on both sides did.
934;/pThe movie is definitely historical fiction, but it's fiction that is very true to the truth of the events.
935;The photography and effects are appropriate, notobtrusive.
936;and Bob Hoskins was good.
937;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, enough that I began doing additional reading and research on The Battle of Stalingrad.
938;The opening battle scene is very well done and throughout the movie there are some very interesting scenes but, as with so many movies, its potential was not realized to make the movie more inviting to as wide an audience base as possible.
939;to be honest, there were some very fascinating parts of this film .
940;the sniper scenes are also interesting to watch, however I doubt that a huge battle between several hundred thousands of soldiers would suddenly cease just so that a sniper duel between two people can have greater dramatic tension.
941;i also found the ending very odd.
942;Third, like the guy walking through wouldn't notice, let's get realistic here.
943;Her character was a complete stereotype the `smart strong independent coy tomboy.'
944;I was relieved when she got shot, I thought there was going to be a plot twist, but alas she miraculously bounced back to perfect health in some random hospital.
945;I think those parts were visually well done.
946;I thought that was a great visual representation of what was happening at that time.
947;If you liked Saving Private Ryan you will love this one.
948;A great addition to anyones war movie collection.
949;A prime example of Hollywood's taste for Art Direction over script.
950;Sure, the city looks devastated, but all the Russians are happy.
951;ya, very moving, not since Rocky III where the Russian was training with high.
952;tech equipment while Rocky was punching sides of beef have I been so moved by the subtle use of metaphor.
953;i don't mean making the movie about them, I mean they literally made the entire battle hinge on who won the sniper's duel.yes, forget the MILLIONS who struggled and died there, it's the two with pretty eyes and strong jawlines who really matter.
954;It's amazing that people who thrill over the accuracy of the weapons here are willing to overlook the trivializing of the entire event.
955;Great movie the plot was good, actors did a great job I wish they where more movies like this, thank you
956;A truer picture of the reality of what war can be and how it affects a way of life.
957;Good blend of the cast.
958;The opening scenes of the battle for Stalingrad during World War II set, in their gruesome intensity, the brute nature that was the street fighting between the Nazi Wehrmacht and the Soviet Red Army.
959;Up to this point, director Jean.
960;Would recommend this to others , easy to comprehend and easy to keep an interest in.
961;My great grandson (and me) have thoroughly enjoyed this retelling ofRussia's place in WW II history.
962;It was actually recommended bya doctor.
963;This is a movie that has a little something for everyone in it.
964;There are moments of realist horror, but also moments of suspense, drama, intrigue, love, sex, humor, you name it.
965;Ed Harris does a great job as the German sniper, but the real star of this film should have been Bob Hoskins, whose colorful portrayal of Kruschev probably comes very close to the real man himself.
966;Production and set design is excellent
967;Also, there is a gorgeous musical theme at the end of the film.
968;And I was going to refrain from mentioning this, but I can't help it: this film contains the most mature and tasteful sex scene I've seen in a long, long time.
969;This movie is so tight man.
970;Enemy at the Gates is a pretty good war flick.
971;He's told to pick one up off his fallen comrades.
972;the game of cat and mouse is on as the snipers hunt each other.
973;jude Law gives in my opinion the second best performance of his carear.
974;He doesn't equal the job that he does in Cold Mountain but he's fantastic as Vassili.
975;This guy can really act and he is quicly becoming one of my more favorite actors.
976;the other actors are good in the movie.
977;Ed Harris is good as Konig as is Fiennes as Danilov.
978;They never develop it much to be a huge major part of the story.
979;I know they had to do some stuff for filler, but if you are at 
980;this is a good war flick.
981;It's the best movie that I've seen to date on the battle of Stalingrad, but it should have been more.
982;It's still great though and the showdown between Harris and Law is worth the wait.
983;'Enemy at the Gates' is a solid sniper movie.
984;It is set in World War II, and told from a Russian perspective.
985;All the main characters are Russian, and their primary adversaries are the Germans, who want to take over their cities.
986;A game of cat mouse is afoot, and it is adequately played out.
987;the film has a stirring beginning not unlike the heavy introduction of Saving Private Ryan .
988;It is quite graphic, as artillery shoots into people's heads, body parts fly everywhere, and bullets riddle the brave.
989;Vassili meets a young newspaper man, played by Joseph Fiennes, who helps turn him into an instant legend.
990;Rachel Weisz plays Tania, Vassili's love interest.
991;There develops somewhat of a love triangle, which basically just serves as filler space.
992;'Enemy at the Gates' is acted and directed well.
993;The cinematography is ripped straight from Saving Private Ryan , and adds an overall *gritty* feel to the picture.
994;The sniper scenes between Vassili and Konig are effectively tense.
995;I have rarely seen a picture, based on real events, which truly captures exact facts .
996;'Enemy at the Gates' makes for engaging cinema, and is done suitably well.
997;It is a solid sniper flick.
998;Since it isn't, I'll give it my best shot.
999;w. w. iI is still a valid and interesting theme, one which in recent years has inspired several brilliant movies, including Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List and Life is Beautiful.
1000;It taked a script structured basically like the war movies of the 1940s and 1950s, then adds in all the graphic 'realism' that modern technology allows.
1001;The Germans finally resorted to bringing in their best sniper, an aristocratic officer, Maj. Erwin Lonig [Ed Harris].
1002;An elaborate game of cat and mouse followed.
1003;This part of the story is true.
1004;Like the rest of the movie, it made the mostly true story seem like fiction.
1005;it had great acting and great cinematography.
1006;i enjoyed every second of it and i recommend it to just about everybody
1007;What Works: Realistic depictions of the early stages in the European battles of WWII.
1008;pounding drama, as well as powerful directing top that all off.
1009;As well as the sleepy moments in between battles that are supposed to be a major part of the film, but just boost up more of LAW's performance.
1010;And this film does have some sex in it and strong, very graphic war violence.
1011;OVERALL: This film is great, but has its own portion of cliches that take away from what could've made it the best film of 2001.
1012;Yet the performances, directing and battles are powerful, which helps ENEMY AT THE GATES hold its domain in the 4 star area.
1013;This movie was well done.
1014;Another soldier hooks him up with the newspaper industry and the sniper man becomes famous with the people and is on the hunt for another excellent sharp shooter (Ed Harris.
1015;The ending really pulled it around as {Rachel Weiez.
1016;The Mummy 1 2) became the true love of the young good shooter and her kid brother is hanged, and there is a big battle.
1017;Ed Harris shoots the good sniper's friend, but thinks he killed the good sniper, his enemy.
1018;This movie is good in acting, directing (considering it was made in Europe), and story.
1019;The beginning rocks, the middle is sleepy, the keeps your eyes open most of the time.
1020;See this movie on video.
1021;This is up there with Saving Private Ryan!
1022;I thought this was a great movie.
1023;It has great special effects, Action, and pretty good acting.
1024;great acting all around by Rachel Wiess (The Mummy, Mummy Returns), Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare in love) also.
1025;it tries to copy Saving Private Ryan in some ways, but this one stands on its own, with a pretty good storyline and character development.
1026;special Features are pretty good, nice menus, some behind the scenes featurettes, and trailers.
1027;The action is awesome and realistic.
1028;The characters fit the story very well.
1029;It adds more mystery to what is going to happen.
1030;You have action, suspense and romance in a true to life package.
1031;A reasonably competent portrayal of the siege of Leningrad in the 2nd world war, by the director of 'Seven Years In Tibet' and 'Name Of The Rose'.
1032;More should have been done with the script to create greater empathy for the characters
1033;ed Harris gives the strongest performance in the film all steely eyes and controlled violence.
1034;The film is worth seeing, just don't expect to be bowled over and try not to compare it with other more impressive war films, at least not until the end.
1035;this is a good movie during WWII.
1036;if you like war movies this is a good watch
1037;speaking movie I've ever seen on the subject, and while it is riddled with flaws, it is still a pretty entertaining flick.
1038;For their purposes one suited as well as the other.
1039;But while Vassily is quite an able killer, he is really no more than a gifted amateur, and he knows it.
1040;Law is a good choice for Zeitsev, and Bob Hoskins is hilarious as the villainous Nikita Kruschev, who tries to steal the movie by doing things like handing a defeated Red Army general a pistol and telling him to cut through the red tape but the movie belongs to Ed Harris, who turns out to have a highly personal motivation for killing Zeitsev after all.
1041;This is such foolishness it comes close to ruining the movie by itself, but Gates has just enough to recommend it despite this and other blunders, namely a by.
1042;This movie is often compared to Saving Private Ryan and it is almost as good.
1043;Performances are quite good and the movie is beautifully shot by director Jean.
1044;The picture transfer itself is very good.
1045;Good movie, i liked it.
1046;Good acting, good story line.
1047;I wasnt aware that Russians also had English accents.
1048;I am not a big fan of Jude Law with that silly smile plastered on his face but he plays the role with some humility here and it works pretty good.
1049;Where fans are typically entirely in the dark, Enemy is a wonderful example of how easily filmmakers can revert to Gunga Din and other shopworn Circa 1930's templates.
1050;His son , his gold.
1051;Zaitsev married and realized his dream, verbalized in the film, of managing a factory .
1052;Enemy at the Gates is a great film.
1053;the film shows a new perspective on WW2.
1054;That's why I think this movie is informative in showing a new perspective.
1055;the special effects, sound, and cinematography are all excellent, and there is a riveting plot to hold the wathcer's attention.
1056;Unnecessary, and it does take away from the power and meaning of the film.
1057;Watch it as what it is.
1058;This is one terrific film.
1059;A friend turned me on to it and I was so glad I could get it for my sons, who found it fascinating.
1060;Well acted, beautifully directed from a terrific script.
1061;I thought it looked really good.
1062;I've just finished watching this amazing film, and I thought it was a shame that it was so underrated.
1063;this is one of the best war movies I have I ever seen.
1064;Its stunningly atmospheric and moody, with excellent and taut direction, a fabulous cast with kicks for giving believable performances, a story and script that portrays war in its coldest hour, and some very developed and interesting characters that kept me captivated the entire time.
1065;enemy at the Gates is a big winner because it shows the true harsh reality of war.
1066;The movie shows what lengths people will go to if it results in winning war and triumph.
1067;destroying, real and raw world of war.
1068;hearted, and I even felt a little queasy after the stunning opening sequence.
1069;studded cast features Oscar nominee Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Ed Harris, Rachel Weisz and Bob Hoskins in the leading role.
1070;Law is a sensitive and compassionate hero, Harris is a cunning and creepy villain, Weisz (fresh from the success of The Mummy Returns) is a beautiful and heroic leading lass, and Hoskins we don't really see that much of, but he does well with what small role he has.
1071;Fiennes is the real star power here.
1072;I also thought he was terribly underrated for his performance in Shakespeare in Love, and he proves yet again that he is quietly one of the most brilliant actors of his generation.
1073;Fiennes pulls of a real winner especially in this case, displaying a character who is jealous yet friendly, longing but also fulfilled.
1074;His character is merely a supporting role, but he is the character I felt most drawn to.
1075;the special effects in this movie could beat Saving Private Ryan in its own game.
1076;After an authentic and scary opening sequence, the movie continues to get more and more violent, and more and more attractively moody.
1077;The special effects aren't quite as spectacular as Pearl Harbour or The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, but they do display a small kind of blockbuster excellence in appearance, which we don't get much these days.
1078;and overall is one of the more clever war films I've seen.
1079;Highly recommended for people who can stomach what war really was.
1080;Although the movie appears to take a fair amount of theatrical licence with the story line, it still manages to capture much of the essance of the battle of Stalingrad.
1081;I would have liked to have seen the ending of the sniper battle done a little more historically and the love triangle plot line detracted more than added to the story but over all it is a great movie.
1082;Just another Hollywood love story wrapped in pseudo.
1083;A big laugh for anyone familiar with reality!The screenplay is written with little respect for the nation that won the battle of Stalingrad and saved Europe from Nazi Germany.
1084;go ahead and see the movie, if you want to find out more about WWII and Russia .
1085;Rachel Weisz adds what is likely a fictionalized romance to the film, and Bob Hoskins gives a brilliant portrayal of a middle aged Nikita Krushchev.
1086;most notable in this film is the presentation to the western world of the events of the Eastern Front during World War II.
1087;An epic saga, for the most part, overlooked by film makers.
1088;It's good to see what appears to be a fairly accurate portrayal of that sector of the war.
1089;the acting in this film is above average.
1090;That gift comes to the attention of Commisar Danilov, who sees Zaitsev as a political propaganda coup for an ailing Russian military.
1091;the movie is earthy and real, and the acting is excellent.
1092;Jude Law is great in the lead roll.
1093;I was very impressed with the cast of the movie.
1094;fest likeWe Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition), it is certainly realistic in its depictions.
1095;It is a good movie with lots of tense moments.
1096;I enjoyed this movie a lot.
1097;If you liked Saving Private Ryan, you will definitely enjoy this film.
1098;I enjoyed this movie immensely, except for the ending.
1099;Don't get me wrong, it's still a worth while movie to see.
1100;I would definitely recommend this movie.
1101;Very good action packed movie about WWII and the history of the Snipers who protected Stalingrad from takeover in 1943.
1102;A pretty good portrayal and historically accurate.
1103;Suspense is still engaging even though I know what's going to happen.
1104;Vassily gives his people new hope and as a result, the Nazis view Vassily as a major threat to their conquest of Russia and send their own expert marksman Major Konig (Ed Harris) to Stalingrad to hunt down and kill Vassily, and so begins a game of cat and mouse.
1105;The main cat and mouse plot between the two expert marksmen is also well.
1106;handled and Annaud maintains a good balance between the need for suspense, urgency and character development.
1107;It is also a fact that propaganda (on all sides) always plays an important part in war, and that the Russian soldiers in WWII fought incredibly hard and won against all odds, as depicted in this movie.
1108;The casting of the movie is pretty interesting, with the exception of the excellent Ed Harris, the main characters are all played by British actors (with English accents), including a cameo from Bob Hoskins as Joseph Stalin.
1109;The reason behind this I don't know but they all give good performances, although I must admit to still being slightly unconvinced with Rachel Weisz's acting ability.
1110;This is definitely superior to most of the dross that gets released on a weekly basis and whilst not quite scaling the heights to greatness, it's a pretty good film that I highly recommend checking out.
1111;And the story of Vasily Zaytsev is great.
1112;If you like WWII movies this is a great addition to any collection
1113;In the epic opening battle scene, a trainload of fresh.
1114;style: An officer yells into a bullhorn, The one with the rifle shoots
1115;It's surreal, but a fitting introduction to a movie about the harrowing, intersecting worlds of a sniper and a propagandist.
1116;On top of that, there's a robust allegorical layer far more complex than it first appears.
1117;picking aside and enjoy the film.
1118;An underexplored WWII chapter, the battle for Stalingrad, is interestingly examined in this big budget epic.
1119;notable for its spectacular battle scenes and another pitch perfect performance from the gifted Jude Law.
1120;top billed Joseph Fiennes is out of his element and can't keep up with his two main costars.
1121;the intellectual and charismatic director, Jean.
1122;i simply cant put it to words but amazing its almost have the setting just like saving privite ryan
1123;stop inclusion of scenes dedicated to building up the love story.
1124;It's unfortunate that such a great true life story had to be butchered, one day maybe someone will get it right.
1125;This movie is great for the life of me i cant figure out why some people give the movie bad ratings if you are the most hardcore war movie goer you might want to skip this one but for those who just want to see a good entertaining war movie this is it.
1126;This is easily better then platoon and o so many others.
1127;It was in good condition.
1128;Actors are good so is direction.
1129;which is really magnificent in this.
1130;The acting ranges from superb to good, and the story is captivating as well as interesting.
1131;Suffice to say if you like WW2 epics, you'll like this a lot.
1132;My primary interest in this movie was historical.
1133;I enjoy studying World War II history, and the battle for Stalingrad has always been, in my estimation, one of the most fascinating episodes of the entire war.
1134;this movie provides a rare and realistic glimpse into the horror and chaos that was Stalingrad.
1135;The production was extremely well done, and did a fabulous job of setting the scene for the two intertwined story lines.
1136;the second story line is the love triangle (with the obligatory sex scene) involving Zaitsev, his best friend and promoter, and an attractive young lady who happens to serve in the local citizen militia.
1137;From my perspective as a historical purist, I thought it took something away from an otherwise great movie.
1138;overall, Enemy at the Gates is suspenseful and riveting, historically insightful if not necessarily true in every detail, and carries an underlying theme about the precious value of life and love in the face of the most horrific of circumstances.
1139;I enjoyed it immensely, and would recommend it enthusiastically.
1140;Enemy at the Gates was quite interesting.
1141;thanks to Danilov his name and face was in the papers.
1142;It had action, combat scenes, intrigue, heroes, villains, and a little romance.
1143;This film was well worth watching.
1144;As the battle progresses, he soon finds himself to be one of the best marksmen in the Red Army.
1145;Throughout the movie, the director seemed more interested at making humorous jabs of Soviets and communism instead of emphasizing the dramatic elements of the plot.
1146;I got interested in it because of my recent knowledge of the Russian Mosin Nagant rifle.
1147;My son has some of them and got me interested in shooting and gun collecting.
1148;The acting was very good and the hero story was very believable.
1149;This ia an intense and smart cat.
1150;mouse tale of two men .
1151;The script makes a smart choice by focusing on the tale of the younger Russian, including his friends (Fiennes) and loves (Weisz) to make a more sympathetic character.
1152;a good case of less is more).
1153;The intensity of the four lead performances, combined with real locations, a strong supporting cast, a strong script, a true story, and the solid directing job by Jean.
1154;jacques Annaud makes for a very good film.
1155;It does not reach the heights of PLATOON or THE THIN RED LINE, but it is still an awfully good movie.
1156;Very very entertaining movie .
1157;plent of action and you can tell the person who wrote the script took his time to do so .
1158;I have been a fanatic about anything Soviet since I was in high school, so this film hits all the right notes for me.
1159;packed, suspenseful, and entertaining movie about a Soviet sniper defending Stalingrad from the Nazis.
1160;For God's sake, it has Bob Hoskins as a spot.
1161;ray version looks pretty damn good.
1162;Great cat and mouse movie, set in Stalingrad.
1163;He's a magnet for attention.
1164;Any movie he is in is bound to be good and this movie is GREAT!
1165;acting in general, is good but could be far more greater.
1166;he does a magnificent job as a German expert sniper with a casual fatality about the job he has to accomplish (those who are about to die, salute you.)
1167;many of the battles for possession of Stalingrad are detailed in the film but the central story focuses upon the renowned Soviet snipers, (many of these heroic individuals being women), who saved the day for their Motherland.
1168;one contest with a renowned German sniper, (brilliantly conveyed by Ed Harris.)
1169;The mounting suspense in this 2001 film tenoned with its astounding realism makes the movie so compelling as to rank as one of the best contemporary films I've ever viewed.
1170;Lots of action, a decent romantic sub.
1171;plot, flawless casting, and marvelous cinematography all contribute to make this one a movie which you will surely want to watch over and over.
1172;One picks up more of the film's clever details with each subsequent viewing.
1173;I own two of them, one with a scope and one without.
1174;They are incredibly powerful and accurate, about the same as the popular American .30.06 caliber rifle.
1175;It's in color, subtitled in English, and features the most realistic war action I've ever seen staged .
1176;returning to the film under review, I award this remarkable movie my very highest rating.
1177;Given the importance of the Russians in WWII, I really like it when a good movie comes out about them.
1178;I especially enjoyed finding out more about how the crossing of the Volga looked from the Russian side.
1179;Yes, it was historically inaccurate to have it occur in the daytime, but it made for a more exciting movie.
1180;I found the love scene between Zaitzev and Chernova very erotic.
1181;He is made a hero by his would.
1182;is very graphic and exciting and more realistic than most war films.
1183;the action part of the movie is mainly focused on the Russian sharpshooter's duel with the elegant German sniper sent to cut him down.
1184;The cast all round is superb, especially the principal characters.
1185;That being said, I found myself identifying with both snipers in this movie.
1186;So we have two basically good human beings plying their trade against each other, in the service of two monsters.
1187;One more part was with the Russians.
1188;Besides that, everything else was very realistic and had many parts of excitement that I enjoyed.
1189;If you are not as closely linked to history as I am, and you do not know as many details, this will be the right action+thriller for you.
1190;Even with myself not knowing anything about the true story this movie was based on I can already tell you that this film took HUGE historical liberties with its adaptation.
1191;The movie is a good portrayal of Stalingrad's general atmosphere during World War II and urban sniper techniques but the story's details are straight out of Hollywood.
1192;As far as casting, the movie has an excellent ensemble of some of today's top acting talent.
1193;Both actors are blessed with brilliantly colored eyes that project a sense of tranquility required for the audience to believe their roles as snipers.
1194;Both are general in theme.
1195;One surprsing element of the film are the enjoyable deleted scenes.
1196;jacques Annaud does a very good job of keeping the audience in the film and the cinematography is s superb complement to the acting talent.
1197;This is the type of movie that is much more enjoyable with a great theater sound system but it will keep you captivated throughout the film regardless.
1198;Still, a good film and one of the better World War II projects in recent years.
1199;I really enjoy this movie.
1200;i also enjoy the Romantic aspects of the movie too.
1201;And it is good to see the Soviet women fight alongside their men.
1202;has much better sets and scenery than the German made Stalingrad (most of which takes places in the steppes outside the city).
1203;probally the one of best WWII movies, ever.
1204;Very great movie, not a crazy action war movie, but fulfills alot of what i look for in a war movie.
1205;the criticisms I read about Enemy at the Gates are, by and large, correct!
1206;So why on earth do I think this is a great movie?!
1207;Well, the performances are great.
1208;Very affordable price as well.
1209;handed and silly
1210;This has become one of my favorite movies with Jude Law.
1211;I thought it was well done
1212;It was the type of movie I like, a little slow, but the acting was good.
1213;One of my favorites movies, all time classic.
1214;Very well made and an excellent account if historic events add they really happened
1215;My husband made me watch it :D So many great actors and even better knowing it was based on a true story.
1216;It's a very good movie.
1217;The plot is moving and the apperance of the actress is very great.
1218;When Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) arrives to take charge and solicits ideas from his officers as to how they may turn the tide of the battle, a young political officer in charge of propaganda, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) steps forward and proffers a hero, a soldier from among the ranks he knows to be a marksman of exceptional ability.
1219;Early in the film, Annaud creates a sense of urgency and tension that promises to sweep you along to the climax, and the anticipation of an involving emotional experience at that point is high.
1220;that greatly affects the success of the film.
1221;Distracting as well is the fact that all of the Russians have class.
1222;distinctive British accents, which makes their credibility a bit hard to swallow.
1223;He manages enough emotional depth and lends a bearing to the character that make him believable, though there is one lapse near the end when during a particularly emotional scene he briefly slips into a such a Cockney dialect that it takes you out of the moment.
1224;That one exception aside, it's a solid performance.
1225;Ed Harris delivers a notable performance, as well, though far removed from the best work he's ever done.
1226;Rachel Weisz comports herself well as Tania, the woman who impacts the lives of Danilov and Vasily, but the role is far from challenging.
1227;There is some chemistry between her and Law, however, and their scenes together create what little emotional apex there is to the film.
1228;And it illustrates just how much impact the expertise (or lack thereof) of the director can have on a film, for even the best actors must rely on the instincts of their director, as well as their own, to keep them on task.
1229;Though based on a true story, and dealing with a significant historical event.
1230;The troops got it on both sides.
1231;According to what I have read, this is pretty factual.
1232;The performances were pretty good for the most part.
1233;The story line was fairly good, predictable but good for a weekend where the weather keeps you in.
1234;In this struggle between opposing snipers, the director beautifully captures the essence of the struggle and its ebb and sway.
1235;Being a history buff I usually hate when hollywood takes such an major event in world history, and turns it into a love story, but it works here.
1236;A very good movie and awesome with the home theater on.
1237;Roiling within the brutal warfare that engulfed Stalingrad was a more personal conflict that is the subject of this highly entertaining movie.
1238;Two exceptional men, one a common shepherd from the Urals, the other a well.
1239;This is an utterly facinating look into the world of snipers and the psychology that motivates them.
1240;Both Law and Harris have deep penetrating eyes that served well in emphasizing a deadly job behind the scope of a high powered rifle.
1241;This epic movie is very well done, the special effects are detailed and breathtaking and used only to support the film, not drive it like some of the demographically motivated drivel that all too frequently dominates a domestic Hollywood production.
1242;The supporting roles were well cast and rounded out ably enough.
1243;Lovely Rachel Weisz (The Mummy) and gifted actor Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare in Love) fleshed out the cast in their supporting roles as Russian soldiers driven to protect the homeland.
1244;Arnaud not only gives us a candid look at the devastation of civilization in bombed.
1245;This is actually a good movie.
1246;If you ask me, see this movie.
1247;Your opinion is your opinion but I feel you will enjoy it.
1248;Some of his output deserves instant classic status
1249;The two are backed by a solid cast of minor characters, including the off.
1250;genius casting of Bob Hoskins as Krushchev.
1251;Jude Law is, as always, a pleasure to watch onscreen, and Ed Harris gives one of his better performances (though he can't seem to decide if he's supposed to be speaking in a German accent or not).
1252;it is nice to see a WW2 movie that does not have americans in, as we ONLY helped win in europe
1253;This is a really good film of a talented fighter, Zaitsev, who is chosen as a tool of political propaganda in a desperate era.
1254;The acting is wonderful, from Law as the hero, Fiennes as the political propagandist and Hoskins as Krushchev, to Ed Harris as the sensitive and hoghly talented villain/sniper.
1255;I have watched this, utterly rivetted, several times these last months, and my fascination with the historical period and characters is undiminished.
1256;The battle scenes are great.
1257;The story line is a bit weak, but kind of interesting.
1258;Agreed, this is a movie and the producers have the right to use artistic license, BUT, the true story of Zaitsev is even more fascinating than the movie portrays.
1259;i would encourage the viewer to explore the history of Zaitsev and the female in the movie, Tania Chernova.
1260;I assure you, it will amaze you!
1261;so, thumbs up for a good display of what war was like in Stalingrad and thumbs down for substituting a make believe story line for a true one that is simply astounding.
1262;There are a number of things to love about this movie.
1263;This movie helps correct some of that misapprehension by focusing on the major front of WW II.
1264;The performances are all excellent, the sets.
1265;While nearly every scene is memorable, the film functions best as a collection of great individual bits, rather than a marvelous, unified whole.
1266;Nonetheless, I feel comfortable rating this five stars because of the first rate performances, the amazingly vivid battle sequences, and the amazing sets.
1267;It is also a decipher or I will devour you, a Greek play of human sentiments magistrally transported to the wide.
1268;screen by the renowned French director, a game of chess between two of the best snipers of the nazi and Soviet army, who fight one each other till one prevails.
1269;But many die before this happens, and many love triangles are to be ruptured by envy, delation and intrigue, just to name a few of the human sentiments parading in front of you in the big screen.
1270;the rationale behind each shapshooter's move is amazing, and in order to survive they have to know in advance all the steps to be taken by their opponent.
1271;See the film and you will know the surprising end.
1272;I hope you enjoy it as I did.
1273;It make this movie look like a Disney movie.
1274;The imagry is great, and the scenes at the docks were a work of art.
1275;The love story is true, but the end of it is changed for the movie to make a happy ending, and the end of the sniper duel is so well known, and so much better than the ending in the movie I have no idea why they changed it, but most people wouldn't know the difference anyway.
1276;The set and digital effects are stunning (even if at times they are clearly digitally.
1277;derived: mainly due to a desire to show the camera moving rather self.
1278;The early sniper duels are very good and involving .
1279;Still this film really does deliver on the visual goods and this is reason alone to see it.
1280;Whilst the sets have a painterly composed look to them (a little to many romantic statues of Lenin and Stalin lying about I think) the scenes of desolate destroyed streets are impressive as are the scenes of attacks from the air.
1281;A fine effort in depicting the un.
1282;this film gives one a feeling of what Stalingrad must have been like during the fighting from more of the Russian point of view.
1283;has Vassili become, that the Germans have even sent their greatest sniper, Major Konig, to find and dispatch him.
1284;thus, the film becomes at times a fascinating depiction of a cat.
1285;eyed intensity of a bloodthirsty killer, as much driven by his need for personal triumph as his love of the greater cause.
1286;Part of the fascination of his character rests in the struggle Vassili undergoes as he tries to reconcile the heroic image of himself as portrayed in the newspapers with the all.
1287;human man of flesh and blood he knows himself to be.
1288;in addition to covering an aspect of World War II that has long gone untouched by moviemakers until now, Enemy at the Gates provides us with an interesting plot .
1289;Kudos go out to all the films technical people, its production designer, art directors, set decorator, editors, cinematographer, special effects technicians etc.
1290;They have done a truly monumental job on this film.
1291;good idea to tell the story of stalingrad , but at least come close to the truth.
1292;I very much enjoyed this movie, despite the perhaps inevitable Hollywood hype.
1293;zaitsev was, in fact, an accomplished sniper.
1294;There were plenty of entirely competent marksmen there, already.
1295;The Soviets would have certainly promoted their lady sniper as the 'best'.
1296;Still as it is, has great replay potential!
1297;Well, I thought the acting was pretty darn good (4.5).
1298;I thought it was pretty realistic about war.
1299;I thought the sniper scenes were very well done.
1300;however:It had the Saving Private Ryan flavor, mixed with a love story, a story about friendship, and a clear example of the cruelty of war (3.0).
1301;Certainly, in any war, there are stories of luck, of hope, and of love.
1302;The film is true in that regard.
1303;How these people survive, fight, and love in an environment where death can come at any minute is the true focus of the film.
1304;The point is to see how heroic in the face of insurmountable odds men and women can be.
1305;Fast delivery, the price was excellent for this classic movie!
1306;the epic war scenes of the Russian soldiers attackinga cptured Staligrad are absolutely fabulous and appear to be so tru to life that one can actually feel like one of the young Russian soldiers being used as cannon fodder.
1307;one other notable bright light in this movie is Ed Harris as the Nazi sniper sent to kill the young backwoods Russian sniper .
1308;well, you'll probably convince me of the existence of the tooth fairy first .
1309;The movie provides a realistic visual of what it was like from a Russian soldiers view point of how they were treated, the horrors of war, the fear, and hopelessness of surviving any of the battles.
1310;Awesome action, cool battle scenes, heads getting blown off, this is cool at it's best.
1311;This movie is wonderful in that it truly shows the tragic situations of war.
1312;I bought this item as a gift and it was well received, oh it's very much a guy movie for sure.
1313;An interesting film for the Nagant Revolver or Mosin Nagant collector.
1314;They are everywhere in this film !
1315;The immediate characters are well constructed, and we care for them.
1316;i enjoyed seeing Nikita Krushshev as a character.
1317;The Additonal Scenes are particularly good at fleshing out his character.
1318;The writers and director HAVE taken creative license when it comes to language, casting, and history.
1319;The true story has been greatly altered, but if you wanted to have a history lesson, I'm sure the local university could help you out.
1320;A full 2+ hours of excellent filmmaking.
1321;There is truly something for everyone.
1322;The guys will love the graphic battle scenes.
1323;The ladies will love the romantic subplot and the unbelievably handsome leading men.
1324;This a beautiful story of bravery, perserverance, and humanity in the face of unspeakable horrors of war.
1325;Jude Law once again proves that his beauty is surpassed only by his talent.
1326;Ed Harris was perfect as the ice.
1327;Rachel Weisz was believable as the female soldier with a personal vengance against the Nazis.
1328;She was beautiful enough to be a leading lady, but not at all done.
1329;Worth every penny you spend if you go into it with an open mind.
1330;Appreciate the amazing cinematography, the solid acting, the beautiful story.
1331;a legendary movie that made me discover Jude Law in a face to face scenario.
1332;Great movie, sad though that so many people died such nasty deaths in that war!
1333;A good look at history.
1334;A movie based on a very dramatic true life showdown between snipers during World War II featuring the amazingly talented actors Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare in Love) and Ed Harris (Pollock) can't miss, right?
1335;Joseph Fiennes is a terrific actor but the director allows his British mannerisms to show even though he's playing a Russian.
1336;The ending is anticlimactic, mainly because for most of the film we see the two snipers playing a game of cat and mouse.
1337;The movie had great potential even though it was based on partially true events.
1338;This is pure BS, if anyone has ever read a non.
1339;What you are really seeing is an NKVD penal unit charging across Red Square.
1340;oddly enough the character i liked was the German sniper.
1341;he seemed very real to me.
1342;historically it played a very miniscule part.
1343;I forgot how interesting the movie was.
1344;A great Story and a great look at the difficulties of war and war on the northern front
1345;Ed Harris, Jude Law, and the others give top.
1346;notch performances, and really put both intensity and humanity into this war story.
1347;made movie that gives you a respect for the sacrifices of all soldiers.
1348;Even so, this is among the best war movies out there, even if sanitized somewhat.
1349;The strafing of the ferry boats in the beginning, Krushchev (done very realistically here) leading the Soviet cause, and much of the rest is top notch.
1350;cartoon caricature, whereas the Russian side is given a lot more sympathy.
1351;Given that this battle was compressed into a 2 and half hour movie, it deserves a solid 5.
1352;Its funny but I think I like this movie best for reasons that other people seem to dislike it.
1353;Personally I found this movie to be completely entertaining, and when I define entertaining I mean Not Boring, which I find more and more movies to be these days.
1354;It was at least good, if not great, and I personally think it still to be Jude Law's best role to date, if that's saying much, heh?
1355;battle between the snipers entwined with the love triangle (much better than Pearl harbor's love story), and they set it up well against the grand yet brutle background of the crumbing Stalingrad, arguably the greatest battlefield in WWII.
1356;The love scene was also very cute, I thought, because though they did it in such a improper and dirty public place, it was still so touching, considering bombs were been droped night and day and corpse is all you could see, and very true, considering their age and that natural desire for body contact.
1357;the sniper showdowns are spectacular.
1358;the brutal fight in stalingrad is shown with huge intensity and carnage.
1359;it also perfectly shows how the soviet leaders treated their soldiers and officers, with great brutality.
1360;nevertheless the stellar casts performaces pushes the movie right along
1361;I found it to be a good movie that acurately portrayed the Battle of Stalingrad and the true story of these two snipers that fought it out to the death.
1362;Very good movie, very good product.
1363;Bought this after seeing it on Amazon Instant Video and having a World War II hankering.
1364;that aside, it's still a great movie to watch, even if bits are historically off here and there.
1365;I always preferred it more for it's slower take on action scenes rather than a history lesson, so keeping that it mind helps take some of the heat off its weirder elements.
1366;I'd definitely recommend this to anyone interested in World War II as a hobby rather than a passion.
1367;It was nice to watch it again.
1368;Incredible!This is definitly worth watching.
1369;This movie was the most amazing reconstruction of World War Two Russia I have ever seen.
1370;It depicts the Russian struglle perfectly while keeping the characters as real as possible.
1371;Stunning performances from Harris, Fiennes, and Law, all three alike.
1372;This is a must see for anyone with a strong mind who is ready to be blown away.
1373;Well cast, high production value movie with sharp characterizations of protagonist (Ed Harris as Nazi 'sniper hunter') chasing down Vasily (Jude Law as the Soviet sniper) in war ravaged Stalingrad.
1374;Rachel Weize plays the love interest in one of her first big budget leading roles.
1375;If you read War of the Rats you will see the movie substantially recreating this story.
1376;Visually compelling, with a number of excellent set piece battle scenes.
1377;found friend, a political officer within the Red Army?
1378;fest, intended to leave one awe.
1379;certainly, the special effects are gut.
1380;Vassili's childhood circumstances
1381;the film is worth watching for some powerful performances by the principals .
1382;It would at least be nice to have the opportunity to try it that way.
1383;The war torn background and city were very well done which added a lot to the movie itself.
1384;I've only ever seen two movies featuring Jude Law ('Enemy at the Gates' being one), and he was fantastic in both.
1385;There is a little gratuitous sex scene around the middle of the picture, but overlooking that, it's a wonderful flick.
1386;The battle sequences are fantastic, and the visual effects are awesome.
1387;The two standout performances in the film are Rachel Weiz as Tania, and Ron Perlman (Hellboy) in a brief role as a Russian soldier.
1388;I recommend seeing it once, and that's it.
1389;this is probably one of the best and most accurate portrials of WWII and what being a sniper is really like.
1390;The plot is adorned with a love.
1391;destroyed city is beautifully recreated and photographed.
1392;The pacing allows for us to spend tense moments with Law and Harris, doing not much more than looking through a gun.
1393;This movie also seems wonderfully edited.
1394;Law is very good as the young shootist who must convince himself he not overmatched, and Harris, in a role that calls for little more than one note, is pitch perfect.
1395;The concept is a great one: a lowly Russian sniper and an intellectual propagandist together inspire the Red Army to repel the Germans from Stalingrad and effectively stop Hitler in his tracks.
1396;It begins well enough with a spectacular and bloody crossing of the Volga, and a very efficient introduction of Danilov (Fiennes) and Vassili (Law).
1397;If so, we can blame the producers more than the writers.
1398;But there was one thing they did get right: unlike so many recent films, the use of CGI in the battle scenes was thoughtful, controlled and highly effective.
1399;This is an Epic, brilliantly directed by Jean.
1400;The spectacular opening scene depicting the Russian's frantic defense of Stalingrad .
1401;the cast is impeccable: the always electrifying Ed Harris as a suave, German super sniper, his interaction with the Russian child is deserving of an Academy Award
1402;a group of us with highly divergent movie tastes watched this and all gave an enthusiastic thumbs.
1403;Jude Law is Vasily Zaitsev, one of Russia's great heroes of WWII, who was a highly.
1404;There is a subplot of a love story between Zaitsev and a female Russian soldier (Rachel Weisz).
1405;She is convincing and serves to humanize Zaitsev, as he becomes a reluctant hero, and a pawn of the propaganda war.
1406;with those unforgettable blue eyes and cat.
1407;is perfectly cast as the German sniper.
1408;mouse game with Zaitsev is the heart and soul of this movie and is played to perfection.
1409;He is the Sergeant York of Russian lore.
1410;Jude Law manages to portray the emotional journey from Zaitsev's initial rural naivete to that of an intelligent and cunning, worthy opponent for one of Germany's top sharpshooters.
1411;Fantastic performances across the board.
1412;I highly recommend this movie.
1413;Jude Law and Ed Harris are fantastic.
1414;the story (which I believe actually happened) is gripping.
1415;A great account of war and German warfare.
1416;If you like history, I recommend think you will enjoy this movie, exciting, keeps yopu interested!
1417;All this, along with a plethora of other facts are spectacularly ABSENT from this film.
1418;And maybe Hollywood is actually improving when one thinks of the surreal distortion of history they did recently with Pearl Harbor.
1419;Ed Harris gives his usual stunning performance.
1420;The production (keeping in mind the overwhelming innacuracies) is incredible, and especially the depiction of the ruined city.
1421;The duel itself between the two snipers involved is superbly given and it's probably the one thing that keeps this movie going.
1422;and lastly, is ths film worth watching?
1423;Yes, if you are aware WHAT it is you are watching.
1424;If you know you are watching a nicely filmed lie then yes.
1425;It was much more intense with the picture clarity
1426;Just because you can do a thing does't mean you should.
1427;Special effects, well golly gee whizzz and ho.
1428;just about the sniper,moviewas most in the same place,good movie to wacth,worth the $ $ $ $ $ $ $
1429;The story contains elements of rivalry, treachery, friendship, patriotism and sacrifice amidst the collapsing ruins of Stalingrad, as well as romance, once Zaietseff and Danilov find themselves competeing for the love of Tanya (Rachel Weisz), a dedicated and devoted fellow soldier and romantic interest.
1430;As Zaietseff's fame spreads as an expert sniper and Russian national hero (on account of his masterful assasinations of high.
1431;a truly great WW2 and one of the best about Stalingrad and THE best about what the Eastern Front was truly like for the hapless Red Army soldier trapped between Nazism and Communism.
1432;The film is brave, subversive and original in its handling of Communism during WW2 and there is none of the usual old Moscow boilerplate and/or American Liberal rose colored glasses that has dominated the subject since 1943's MISSION TO MOSCOW wrote the template.
1433;So the film is a game changer.
1434;It is the best film ON communism period since the 1980s if not the early 1960s.
1435;while doing the above, this is also a superbly mounted war film with thrilling harrowing battle scenes that.
1436;The sets are incredible as is the cinemtography.
1437;Annaud really should have had an Oscar nomination for Best Director.
1438;He puts Spielberg in the shade here.
1439;The cast is truly first rate.
1440;Law, Pearlman and Hoskins give memorable performances.
1441;He does a better job here than his version of Mussolini.
1442;One is unaware of a great many Communists who EVER admitted they were wrong and of ANY who then committed suicide but the film community keeps trotting it out.
1443;horner's score is classic and worth purchasing.
1444;very likley the best WW2 film of the first decade of the 21st century and of the 21st century as a whole thus far.
1445;Best WW2 film since the 80s and perhaps A BRIDGE TOO FAR as well.
1446;Best film on communism in decades.
1447;A great film on Stalingrad.
1448;'Enemy' expresses the soul of the Russian people, incredibly decent, humane and resourceful despite the total depravities of their communist rulers.
1449;So, to show the Red Army that it is possible to defeat the Germans, a skilled sniper is elevated to be a popular hero of the people.
1450;It's based on actual events, like the other two films.
1451;all three are visually stunning, a graphic reminder of the brutal impact of war.
1452;The acting is superb
1453;instead, watch this film because of how it depicts the character of the Russians, a people who rose far above their communist masters to win a tremendous victory.
1454;but this together with gripping action and sustained suspense .
1455;any fool knows it will end with a dead German and the good Russian alive somewhere with his girlfriend .
1456;Instead, the truly great works of literature and film are more of an impressive study of character and morals.
1457;in that, it ranks with the best films of World War II.
1458;Vassili and Danilov, are best friend, but then get caught in a love triangle, between the beautiful Tania (Rachel Weisz) and things start to heat up!!!
1459;Sounds like, a great movie huh, well it is more than great!!!
1460;THis has to be the best WW2 movie since Saving Private Ryan,!!!
1461;Everything was perfect about the movie, especially the cast of actors, along with the realistic feel, and sheer visual genius!!!
1462;This movie is an instant classic that you will savor every minute of action packed excitment, along with realistic combat!!!
1463;This is great for any action fan or anybody that loves great war movies!!!
1464;I have studied the Eastern Front for many years, and finally there is a movie I can see about it.
1465;the opening scenes, especially on the young Red Army soldiers cross the Volga river into the battlefield, were both realistic and visually stunning
1466;produced movie on one of the most decisive battles of the Eastern Front, and hope that more films will be made regarding this subject in the future.
1467;the main actors (Law and Harris) are superb, nailing each scene with stone.
1468;Supporting performances by Ron Perlman and the lovely Rachel Weisz are also well done.
1469;The score is subtly wonderful, the themes lending emotion to the alternatively violent, tense and tender scenes.
1470;iI period movies go, but recommended nonetheless.
1471;Despite not being 100% true to history within all of the characters this is a great movie.
1472;(Look for the drunk Russian soldier passing gas on a lit candle in the soldiers underground dormitory two thirds through, it's hilarious.)
1473;Yes it may be a tad bit commercial but it still is must see vieweing.
1474;I think one of the most underrated movie of all time.
1475;Great action and awesome to see in Blu.
1476;Good movie and the brutality that the Stalingrad combatants suffered on both sides was well depicted.
1477;reminds of Spartacus movies of the 50ies or the first Star Trek serials with plastic rocks flying around.
1478;Dully played by most of the actors.
1479;Annaud proves this beautiful attitude once again.
1480;The movie is awesome and makes me pleased to know the extent of the history of my Mosin nagant rifle that was produced in 1925.
1481;Love Annaud's films, everything since Quest for Fire has been a masterpiece.
1482;his obsession with detail always rewards repeated viewings.
1483;jude Law and Ed Harris deliver the goods as they say in Hollywood.
1484;It's amazing how you can see a full.
1485;It's a well oiled war machine, the film industry.
1486;Jude Law plays super sniper and Soviet national hero Vassili Zaitsev and is amazing as always.
1487;i always feel like I'm watching a movie about the concept of luck, and how interesting a theme can luck really make, even in a war picture?
1488;lucky in life, lucky in love.
1489;Have always love this movie so glad to have it in my collection.
1490;movie , is good movie.
1491;the movie is good otherwise i would of have not watched it, i make good choice.
1492;Sorry, I read the high ratings but the movie lacked interest, action and empathy.
1493;It's a good suspense and entertaining movie.
1494;There are many other factors to it.
1495;This is a Christmas gift which was requested, so I'm sure he will love it.
1496;There are several scenes which show the grand scheme of things in the battle and then it progresses to go deeper into the sniper part of the story.
1497;The duels between the two expert snipers are excellent putting the viewer right next to the action.
1498;The final duel is very well put together as well.
1499;while the duel is the better part of the movie, the performances are also very good.
1500;Jude Law is the best as Vasily Zaitsev, the famous Russian sniper.
1501;Joseph Fiennes is also very good as the writer who makes Vasily famous by publishing stories about his exploits.
1502;There are very graphic scenes of battle and also one scene with a sexual situation so beware.
1503;Excellent musical score by James Horner which adds to the mood of the duels.
1504;Excellent sniper movie with great characters even though they all have British accents when they portray Russian characters.
1505;The German is a cunning professional from a military school.
1506;One wonders if the film makers ever read anything about the actual campaign or the mechanics of the fighting.
1507;whilst the scenes devoted to the main characters Jude Law and Ed Harris are good, the rest of the film does not rise above tedium.
1508;well another movie that believes in wartime romance being more important than wartime facts.
1509;hopefully someone will make a movie about the real thing and have it in a language we can understand.
1510;Enemy a the gates is a very good movie.
1511;for a war movie it is great.
1512;It contains lots of action, and it takes place all in Russia, a very seldom looked at front.
1513;It was worth seeing again.
1514;This movie was recommended by a friend of mine.
1515;If you are into sniper movies this is a must see.
1516;I loved the dramatic scenes of the two snipers seeking each other out.
1517;I actually learned a lot about this war that I wasnt aware of.
1518;The psychological and emotional changes and state of these characters were well played by both Joseph and Jude.
1519;The enjoyable index will also be higher.
1520;I was looking for a SAVING PRIVATE RYAN at Stalingrad, but what I ending up seeing was a love story wrapped around by one spectacular battle scene and a few interesting sniper moments.
1521;Jude Law as Vassily is the star of this film, but the most interesting and intriguing character is Major Konig played by Ed Harris.
1522;I have always enjoyed this film.
1523;Performances are solid and presumably an accurate portrayal of the battle from one sniper's point of view.
1524;First of all, yes the Russians are played by English actors.
1525;Midway , the Japanese speak English in the film.
1526;This film is a great war film.
1527;It has epic battle scenes, and the acting is well done.
1528;This film was always compaired to Saving Private Ryan .
1529;I think it is one of the best war films I have seen in years.
1530;Excellent cast and dramatic love story cast in the midst of war.
1531;Love the seamless vfx in this period film.
1532;I was greatly impressed with the set extensions.
1533;Really added to the film without drawing attention away.
1534;Being born 1942 I enjoy movies of WWII.
1535;This movie gives a good prospective of what life was like in Stalingrad.
1536;This movie has lots of action and will keep you watching.
1537;the cast include good actors like Jude Law in the play of the Hero Vassili Zaitsev and Ed Harris the role of the Major Edwig Koenig and one of the most beauties actress of this times Rachel Weisz on the role of Tania Chernova.You will enjoy this movie.
1538;This movie is a great, suspense movie.
1539;It takes place in WWII and has great actions sceens and GREAT affects in the movie.
1540;I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes war movies, or great action movies.
1541;This movie will keep you on your toes, and it also has one sumwhat of a love sceen in it!!
1542;The one thing i like it the detail in the movie, and how good the affects are, I watched this movie on a surround sound, and when the snipers took there shots it was like you were there with them as there spoters!
1543;In spite of other reviews and critisms this movie is a classic to me and probably a lot closer to fact than most Hollywood war movies.
1544;I would enjoy it more this way , but even with English language , it is one of the best movies I have ever seen .
1545;As an American who is interested in Russian history , it is fascinating .
1546;As a movie buff , it is just a darn good movie .
1547;This is one of the best war films I have ever seen.
1548;Jude Law is excellent, as is the action.
1549;the flavor of the times the movie deals with (Braveheart).
1550;was it an accurate portrayal of the actual siege of Stalingrad?
1551;was it a visually realistic, visceral look at a part of WW II that has been almost ignored by Hollywood?
1552;i'd say it is a very good movie, overall, in kind of the same way that Red Dawn is a good movie, even tho RD is completely fictional, and Enemy is more or less factually based.
1553;It also shows the grit and determination of those who are dedicated to protecting their friends and countrymen from invasive enemies.
1554;This is an intriguing look at another side of what goes on during wartime.
1555;I thoroughly enjoyed Enemy at the Gates.
1556;It has a very captivaitng story which I found really interesting because it is a true story about a Russian sniper during WWII, something that Americans haven't had a lot of oppoutunity to learn about.
1557;The cast in this movie is nothing short of wonderful, and they all deliver very believable performances.
1558;I think that many viewers will enjoy this movie greatly because it is not the typical war movie.
1559;There are large battle scenes, but what makes Enemy at the Gates so unique is that the story revolves around two snipers so it results in a deadly game of cat and mouse.
1560;I think Enemy at the gates is definatley worth watching for the compelling story, the wonderful acting, and the true story of one man who inspired many people during WWII.
1561;I think if you like world war 2, you definitely should have this movie.
1562;Very entertaining, with a good plot.
1563;is an excellent movie, well acted
1564;This sequence is just extremely harrowing, even more so than Saving Private Ryan's opening D. day invasion.
1565;This is definitely one of the most realistic, well.
1566;The film's worth viewing for this incredible sequence alone!
1567;rubble sets with bodies strewn everywhere had a lasting impression on me as did the scurring.
1568;Some may find this weird, but I always remembered the discreet love.
1569;What's interesting is that I later discovered that the film was based on the book War of the Rats by David L. Robbins.
1570;fINAL WORD: Enemy at the Gates is a truly unforgettable war film about an oft.
1571;It has numerous memorable scenes, especially the opening crossing of the Volga and also a clever sequence involving a large shard of reflective glass.
1572;In my humble opinion the film's far better than the contemporaneous Saving Private Ryan (I'm sure I'll get a handful of 'non.
1573;The combat footage was done very well.
1574;I do believe the director did a great job at recreating a actuall event.
1575;The chase is on, and the tension builds steadily.
1576;Add Tania, a beautiful female soldier, to the mix, and a love triangle develops between Vasilli and Danilov, further fueling the tension of the film.
1577;this movie had an authentic feel and a good story full of twists.
1578;And the acting was great.
1579;Jude Law gives a steady performance as Vasilli, and Joseph Fiennes lights up the screen with his passionate and deep Danilov.
1580;Ed Harris is intense as usual, and it was nice to see Rachel Weisz in a role that was quite a departure from the comical librarian in The Mummy.
1581;the look of the film was both lush and spare, perfect for a war movie.
1582;The directing was skillful, and the script was great, taking a refreshing non.
1583;a movie well worth seeing.
1584;In my book this is one of the best war films ever made.
1585;Like Saving Private Ryan, this is also great moviemaking that puts you believably inside a war zone, this time in Stalingrad.
1586;Intriguing story line about survival during world war 2 in Stalingrad.
1587;the approach in this film is to build the story around the rivalry between two sharp.
1588;in this approach the film succeed well and it is a genuinely absorbing and interesting experience.
