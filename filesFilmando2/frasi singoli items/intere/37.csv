1;Not the God Father, but a good flick.
2;Guess I'll have to ask.
3;I got this for a Christmas gift.
4;Guess I'll have to ask and find out how they liked it.
5;I am a fan of Sergio Leone's films and have seen almost everything he directed .
6;the actors perform well and the story takes its time to unfold , which is to be expected in a Leone film .
7;especially with this particular scenario .
8;i would recommend it but put aside a couple of nights or days as you will need to do that to appreciate it fully .
9;a meditation on time, memory, and the nature of cinema itself.
10;I hope and pray this is true.
11;Christopher Frayling's excellent biography of Leone outlines the missing footage .
12;hopefully this footage will remedy that and turn Once Upon A Time In America into the masterpiece it undoubtedly is.
13;Strangely moving, dreamlike gangster epic is masterfully executed by all involved.
14;De Niro heads an amazing cast, but a large portion of the credit must go to the youngsters who portay these characters in their youths.
15;developed characters in a magnificent screenplay along with breathtaking cinematography make this film worth watching by themselves.
16;Also includes one of Morricone's most endearing and unforgettable scores.
17;Indelible film will stay with you long after the final reel.
18;Still, the acting is top.
19;notch (especially James Woods and the youngsters) and the scope of the movie is still pretty amazing.
20;I've owned this epic film on VHS.
21;it's that engrossing and impresses anew each time: such an absorbing plot.
22;fine performances by Robert De Niro, James Woods, Elizabeth McGovern and Joe Pesci under the expert direction of Sergio Leone, with a haunting score by Ennio Morricone [the recurring main theme will linger long after the closing credits] all contribute to a superbly memorable cinematic experience.
23;I have also seen this movie at least 50 times and I can view it 50 more times.
24;This movie is by far the greatest movie ever made.
25;The directing, the great cast, the acting, the music, the setting, the props, no other movie that I have seen compares.
26;It is very interesting to watch the other movies directed by Sergio Leone.
27;The only one a serious moviegoer should invest his time watching is the full length film, which clocks in at 227 minutes.
28;No matter how well intentioned, there is no way a capsule review could begin to properly illustrate how powerful, moving and ultimately surprising this movie really is.
29;"Robert de Niro's ""Noodles"" is quietly understated.yet, it is his story that we follow from start to finish."
30;A truly outstanding performance from a master of the genre.
31;james Woods gives his character, Max, his usual intensity.
32;constantly confronts the viewer throughout the film.
33;The end result is that the story of these two criminal friends, covering the years from youth to old age, is believable every step of the way.
34;I wouldn't care if you were Orson Welles or D. W Griffith this is Sergio Leone's take on the 'birth of a nation', that nation being modern day America and the corrupting influences that have brought about that transition.
35;Naturally the movie was given masterpiece status on it's first showing at Cannes.
36;It is Leone's original cut.
37;the leone documentary is interesting, particularly the recollections of the screenwriters and the amazing meticulous leone work ethic.
38;When I compare it to the superb commentary on The Wicker man for instance when the main actors, director and a critic were brought in.
39;Watching these films chronologically is a real treat for a film buff like myself, as you can clearly see the evolution of a deeply creative mind.
40;pretty much a connect the dots remake of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, stands out for taking the most unique samurai film ever made and putting it in a Western setting.
41;He managed to parody, pay homage to, and reinvent the dying Western genre all in one go.
42;A basic film all in all, especially by today's standards, but one that holds a special place in cinema history.
43;The film was so wildly popular in America that Leone set out almost immediately to make it's sequel.
44;From the first 15 minutes of this film, you know you are watching something special.
45;Leone carries the parody element to an absurd extreme in this film, but he manages to keep it strangely believable at the same time.
46;Throw in Morricone's utterly genius score (which adds a lot to the parody in itself), and you have yourself a brilliant work of art that will leave even the most hardened critic champing at the bit to see the next installment.
47;which can only be described as a big ass epic western.
48;Some consider this to be the best western ever made.
49;Nevertheless, this movie is superb in every regard.
50;The story, the characters, the music, the cinematography.
51;everything about this film just pulls you into this world.
52;With a running time of 3 hours, this movie is truly epic, and cemented the names of Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood among the true greats of cinema.
53;Nevertheless, I can tell you that as far as I am concerned, Once Upon A Time In The West is the greatest western ever made.
54;OUATITW manages to capture what must have been an accurate depiction of the absolute chaos of the time in a way that I have never seen before.
55;What makes this film stand apart from all the other stories of this type is the supreme mastery of the craft that both Leone and Morricone display.
56;Every shot in this film is absolutely breathtaking.
57;Every note of music as well.
58;Charles Bronson plays a character not unlike the Clint Eastwood character in the Dollars trilogy, but his hardness is much more defined, as you will see in the jaw.
59;All in all, this film demonstrated that Leone was capable of true cinematic brilliance, if you doubted it before.
60;This is the most moving piece of cinema I've ever had the pleasure to view.
61;I was giddy and very ready to see this, his last film.
62;Very early on, one can see the trademarks of Leone's style.
63;the very depths of Leone's subconscious mind.
64;from the point of view of Noodles, played by Robert De Niro in one of his best roles.
65;What I can say is that the characters, and therefore the viewers, are taken on a completely surreal journey through every emotion known to man.
66;It is only in old age that Noodles gets any kind of redemption for all the pain he has caused and experienced, and even in his redemption, the closure for him is bittersweet at best.
67;This is a very human film.
68;Once Upon A Time In America is a masterpiece of film from one of the medium's true innovators.
69;Leone's visual style was never more effective, and Morricone's beautiful score will likely haunt you for weeks or months to come.
70;thanks for being patient enough to read this.
71;Interesting story, good actors, terrific movie and I like it every time i watch it.
72;this is a truly wonderful film, with a beautiful score.
73;one of the most emotional and harrowing storylines ever.
74;do the right thing and get this released.
75;I love this movie, it is actually long and does have it's drawn out moments but the story and acting is top of the line.
76;De Niro is fantastic as usual and his cast is great.
77;if you enjoy great gangster movies you will have to have this one as a keeper.
78;It's sweet and hot and brutish and mystical.
79;a superb story, excellently presented.
80;A underrated and under appreciated classic!
81;Once upon a time in America is one of James woods best works and of course Robert d isn't bad either!
82;good movie about friendship and how people can go wrong under certain circumstances.
83;I'm laid up with a broken leg watching the great American gangster films.
84;I relish a well done film that exposes the socio.
85;political history of an era and tells a classic, archetypal story.
86;This is one of the best movies ever made.
87;This has to be the best movie I have ever seen.
88;The story is just so powerful that once you've started it you just have to see it through to the end.
89;A really magnificent piece of cinema history.
90;all the people who acted in this were superb.
91;This movie is a masterpiece and deserves a lot more recognition.
92;This is a very well done superbly acted movie with a lot of stars.
93;Sergio Leone was a genius.
94;This, his final film, is an Epic masterpiece of the gangster genre, its only equals are Coppola's first Godfather films.
95;Having said that, it is a roughing tale of friendship, hardship, loyalty, a little love and romance wrapped in a mob drama.
96;Definitely an epic movie worth watching.
97;It is artful, that is true.
98;"I first came to know Morricone's music through ""The Legend of 1900"", a wonderful, wonderful movie."
99;I wonder if she has actually seen it.
100;I think this movie is visually interesting, even beautiful at times .
101;the color saturation and tone is lovely, the costumes, the sets and scenes .
102;all visually good, the stuff of great movies.
103;"There is also a pervasive ""good ole boys"" tone to the featured group, a reverence for the internal loyalty and bonding that lures one to accept the vile ""code"" that they live by, a reverence that seems to lead the viewer into a world that is absolutely debased ."
104;"and to portray it as ""fun"", boyish, bunch of pals, fun."
105;"Except it is vile, even moreso because it is visually beautiful and ""fun""."
106;Putting people in wonderful costumes, in an interesting, romanticized historical setting, playing over beautiful, haunting music .
107;"is somehow much more insidious than a less beautiful ""guised"" portrayal."
108;The movie is worth watching if you can make it to the 15 min mark!
109;It reveals the inner mind of a tough guy, and his passion for a sweet success.
110;It is one of the best gangster movies of all time.
111;"10 years and millions of dollars were put into Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time In America"", a piercing look into to the life of two Jewish gangsters growing up in the Lower East Side, chronicling their childhood to their autumn years."
112;"Now, in honor of Leone's legacy, ""Once Upon A Time In America"" has been restored to its directors true vision."
113;We see their humble beginnings as two young street hoodlums to their rise to power as two of the world's most powerful mobsters, to their ultimate descent and disillusion.
114;It is a true masterpiece.
115;And the supporting cast of Elizabeth McGovern, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Tuesday Weld, Treat Williams and a young Jennifer Connelly add punch to an already enthralling film.
116;this new special edition is excellent.
117;James Woods was very good in his role.
118;All of the other actors played their part well.
119;I like the way it was done, taking us back and forth to see what transpired over the course of their lives.
120;IF you're a fan of mob movies I highly recommend this movie.
121;There is an intermission half way through the move.
122;The 2nd half is well worth it.
123;The visuals are intriguing, and I wish I could just watch a film of the sets and soundstages.
124;The dialoge and the story are all drawn out, but this adds to the poetry and the flavor of the charecters and their lives.
125;He is a good man at heart, but his situation made him do the things that he did.
126;He betrayed his friends because he loved them, and we get a chance to feel that love and we sympathize with him, and we can even hear his concience calling him.
127;The film is great, really great, but these discs don't do it justice.
128;The extras are pretty non.
129;This is a great movie that has been long over due.
130;for years ive been forced to listen to critics tell me about the all time great gangster movies from the eighties Scarface,and even earlier movies such as the Godfather.
131;this particular film never got the justice it deserved, it may be one of Deniro's best performances to date.
132;This movie is a masterpiece.
133;Restored to its original length, the movie is a work of art.
134;The music is fantastic and the acting is great.
135;Jennifer Connelly also makes an appearence, early in the film.
136;What an excellent film .
137;Fabulous performance and although slow in places builds to an excellent finish.
138;We never really even see, to a satisfying extent, the accumulation of wealth by the main characters.
139;I loved the movies Leone did with Eastwood.
140;Just about nothing works in this woofer.
141;The final shot of DeNiro's monkey.
142;Now, once again, the same still holds true.
143;"It would be like, ""Zoom in."
144;This is one great horror flick with all the right elements many of today's horror films are lacking.
145;"the real horrific part about this great horror film was that when I came to vote ""2"", I found it in the top 250 films of all time!!"
146;And after all of this some still deny it's one of the great Horror films of all time?Seriously, thanks god for the presence of Jennifer Connelly.
147;The actors are very good also.
148;This movie was delivered to me in great condition.
149;This is a great movie to watch if you love movies like the Godfather, Goodfellas, etc.
150;Loved it, great for your movie library.
151;For anyone liking gangster movie's it is excellent.
152;Ok I loved the movie, its a awesome movie ,top notch actors.
153;It was good to see the Good fellow group back together in a small way.
154;I had caught parts of this movie over the years and now I can watch it and relax.
155;It's really an enjoyable tale and with great acting to boot.
156;Some years ago I saw this film on TV and was very impressed with the story line and the acting.
157;Beautiful score throughout which helped tone down some of the violence, yet the haunting refrain seemed inappropriate for most scenes.
158;this is sergio leones best film the emotion and the feeling of a comedy in the shakesperean sense of the word almost enters the summary.
159;it leaves you thinking for weeks it is so under rated that it gives the big lebowski blockbuster worthy status in comparison.
160;This is an unbelievably beautiful story which is multi.
161;"Yes, it certainly is a gangster movie and it also is a love story
162;Both aspects of the film are conceptually executed well.
163;once Upon a Time in America is a very unique film as unlike a Goodfellas or Casino it is rich in sentimentality and the effect is mesmerizing but also very depressing.
164;Ennio Morricone's musical score adds to the film's melancholic feel.
165;This is one of a number of Sergio Leone movies.
166;The other movies he did with Clint Eastwood, as far as I'm concerned are classic gold.
167;Great story great acting directing all the ingredients of a great film are here.
168;Don't waste your time reading a review watch the movie already!
169;This long version is great.
170;This is one of DeNiro's finest as a gangster.
171;The way the long version jumps around from era to era, sort of gives you a Tarnatinoesque view which was probably started by leone.
172;It has a lot of scenes that were very moving and took you through time changes while showing you about the realities of the time period.
173;If you love the GODFATHER and movies like that,then you definitely want to add this to your collection.
174;A lot of times in the second half of the movie I felt like I had to try and catch up with the story and figure out what had happened.
175;I've got all of Leone's spaghetti western's and I'd give them all 5 stars.
176;This is not only one of my all time favorites but most film fans have it n their top 100 lists.
177;Very long but full of real story .
178;Easily among the top gangster flicks ever made .
179;ray edition makes it show at its best.
180;This movie is one of Robert Deniro's best films!
181;It is one of the most underrated movies out there!
182;A long but enjoyable epic movie with twists, drama, and just enough violence.
183;I have seen this movie many, many times, and like all movies that are seen more than once, you find something new in each viewing.
184;in my opinion, this is one of the finest modern day movies made.
185;having said all that, I have seen both versions, and prefer the long one.
186;This movie is just plain great!
187;DeNiro is great as Noodles, James Woods as Max does steal the show, and Jennifer Connelly as young Deborah is STUNNING!!!
188;This is just a steller cast for a steller movie.
189;The haunting flute flows mournfully throughout the movie enchanting you.
190;I either enjoy it or I don't.
191;One of my favorite movie scenes of all time is right here.
192;when that beautiful, young blue.
193;But all in all, a fantastic movie.
194;When Once Upon A Time in America was initially released, there wasn't much of a stir in America due to the well.
195;documented excision of around an hour and half of footage.
196;This is a deeply moving, emotionally.
197;wrenching film that deserves its ranks in the annals of some of the greatest motion pictures ever filmed.
198;Movie lovers will delight in this film from frame to frame.
199;notch performances, extended sequences with attention to detail that rival the best Kubrick films, and plot twists told through inventive flashback sequences make this a movie.
200;DeNiro, of course, holds every scene he's in"
201;Thirdly, the pacing of the film was deliberately extended in several sequences to allow for Ennio Morricone's haunting, melancholic, and most deeply felt musical score.
202;When Morricone's music swells, so collectively do we, and the play on the screen becomes the ultimate tragedy that can never have a happy ending.
203;all of this together creates an unforgettable movie experience, one that will stay with the viewer for a long time.
204;He really does look today like he was made up to look in this movie as an old man 30.40 years ago.
205;the Photography and excellent acting, dirtecting through out is as good as it gets.
206;This is by far one of the greatest movies of all time.
207;It is bloody, dirty, sad, depressing, sexual, funny, clever, and just wonderful to watch.
208;It feels like you are actually in New York in the 20's and early 30's.
209;a defective item from mx_123this is a good movie.
210;but i got a defective item.
211;This kind of stark horror of real life stuff was very popular in the late 70s and early 80s.
212;If your a fan of Robert De Niro early work your going to love this movie!
213;It's pretty long but the story line is worth it.
214;"The story is about friendship,growing up poor, learning to survive the streets,love hate
215;I bought this for a gift and watched it for the first time.
216;i think this is one of the best movies ever made,not only is it a movie about gansters,but about childhood friendship,and first love,and trust amond friends.yes it is a little long.
217;the movie is filled with great scenes.
218;it should have won a number of awards.
219;That's fine, really, not everything this master does is great, as people who have seen some of his real clunkers know.
220;This is a very good movie, however a lttle confusing because they keep going back and forth in time when this movie takes place.
221;But all in all, I enjoyed watching the movie, it kept me in suspense.
222;great and a good depiction of that era a bit bloody but then most people like that for sure so watch it.
223;Even with the length, I will watch it again and again!
224;I kept checking my watch.
225;i really really love this movie.
226;you hafto really watch this film.
227;but the story unfolds so wonderfully.
228;i hold this movie as the best movie of pretty much all time.
229;its such a great movie.
230;the director is a geneous and all the actors are supurb.
231;the movie is almost perfect.
232;this is the best mob movie i've seen.
233;so far, it may be an extremely long movie but its worth watching!
234;even if you dont like those movies this is a movie that will really get to you.
235;The performances were fine, the settings and the camera work were top notch and it had one of Ennio Morricone's finest scores but somehow it didn't quite work.
236;The power and persistence of memory is a theme which runs through most of Leone's films but never has it been treated with such genius as it is here.
237;That's what makes a movie great in my opinion.
238;This movie for me is the culmination of the motion picture experience.
239;It is Leone's homage to the history of movies.
240;It must be in good condition with original sleeve.
241;I will pay top price for it.
242;The people he betrayed, raped and sold out were still his friends and still acted like they owed him something.
243;great cast but the storyline just didn't have the it factor for me.
244;It is very LONG but I must admit that once I started watching it I got hooked.
245;You'll love it if you love DeNiro and if you love epic film.
246;I recommend that you AT LEAST watch the entire film once in your life!
247;This is a great film .
248;in my view it is clearly the best film of the past 25 years.
249;Leone's final cut, the one that played to international audiences, not the butchered format foisted on Americans, has been restored.
250;It should have won best director, best film, and best score .
251;and DeNiro should have won best actor.
252;i will have to give spoilers here to explain my reaction to the film.
253;is that part of the dream?It is dreamlike, to be sure.
254;consistent with a 1933 opium smoker imagining the future by superimposing 1933 America on it.
255;on one level, Leone does want to tell the tale in an opium dream fashion .
256;And so the movie is also about the greatness of spirit and the survivor instinct that defines Noodles and his love interest Deborah.
257;I'm not sure this works all that well, though it is significant, perhaps, that she never marries him.
258;It's an endearing, if tragic characteristic.
259;i found the ending, DeNiro's opium smile, very poignant as well.
260;leone's technical mastery is the stuff of legend.
261;His attention to detail, transitions, everything is so right.
262;But he's just so damned good.
263;DeNiro is simply the best there is.
264;The child actors were very well cast and particularly the young Deborah was marvelous.
265;I thought they played well together, that the bond and respect and tension between them is utterly convincing, and that Woods like DeNiro was marvelous.
266;i liked Elizabeth McGovern as well, and the other leading ladies (Tuesday Weld and the actress who plays Noodles last girl friend) were great.
267;it's an amazing movie, from which you learn more with every viewing.
268;While it is quite long, it is worth viewing.
269;With all the flash backs, it keeps you interested.
270;One of the best movies I've seen in years and one of the geatest performances by De Nero.
271;I'll watch this 100 more times.
272;5 stars for the film,2 stars for doing a director's cut and chopping the movie at an important segment!
273;An extra star for a great transfer.
274;in a class that includes few other films, Once Upon A Time in America travels the viewer through time and plants them firmly in an era that is brought to life with a sense of realism that is unsurpassable.
275;It is a film that despite its length can keep you seated and transfixed.
276;shift to and fro to keep you paying attention.
277;But in the end, it is a love story that starts at the films beginning and ends at the film's end.
278;i am a fan of epic and dramatic films.
279;It is, as I stated, simply brilliant, and it has provided me with countless hours of enjoyment and escape.
280;One of the most beautiful scenes is the part where De Niro reflects in the past as he peeps through a hole that he used to look at the little girl that was dancing, an elegy to the lost innocence.
281;Also friendships and loyalty are very strongly depicted.
282;a very nostalgic movie that is captivating.
283;But, if you take this movie on the terms director Sergio Leone sets, it's a richly rewarding cinemeatic experience.
284;But it's slow and richly detailed, and a little odd at times, for very good reasons that pay off in spades by the film's emotionally titanic (though slightly anti.
285;DeNiro smolders throughout, while James Woods delivers a teriffic scenery.
286;maker here, capable of stunning beauty and cruelty, often within the same frame.
287;it's absorbing enough in its own right to keep you from noticing)?
288;The supporting cast, especially the young actors playing the gang members in thier childhood, is also consistently stellar.

293;the period sets here are magnificent.
294;this is a fascinating film to watch for the story, too.
295;There are numerous memorable scenes, some of them involving some downright shocking violence, even for today's movies.

301;type crime movie that ranks right up there with that famous film, not taking a back seat to it at all.
302;It is a pretty damn fine film in the end.
303;i'll put it this way.
304;If you like Leone films and you like foreign gangster stuff this will be your cup of tea.
305;A lot of beautiful shots and the score is also great as well.
306;"This film came to me with high recommendation, for which I give thanks
307;Have always been a fan of DeNiro, but over and above that, I have to say the young actors in this movie were brilliant.
308;A sweeping epic following interesting, dynamic, and convoluted characters through the hard choices and the difficult events of life and friendship.
309;Long movie, but worth it.
310;Fantastic acting and great cast make this movie a s must see.
311;I love the GodFather Saga, The Last Don and just about every gangster movie I have seen over the years but this one has always stood out separately from the rest.

314;Visually stunning, superb art direction set design, best instances of character development I've ever seen.
315;Makeup and costume design were also exceptional.

317;It's one of those movies easily considered a classic such as """"Scarface"""" or """"The Godfather""""."""
318;Overall the storyline is great, filled with great actors and characters were believable.
319;"It's a decent movie that is perhaps worth one viewing, with mostly good acting by De Niro and some others, but there are many flaws that keep this off any ""best of"" list I can think of."

322;Leone's epic wisely chose actors who could actually act.
323;Heck, even the young 'uns who portrayed the main characters in childhood were marvelous.
324;The transfer is excellent, considering the age of the film and perhaps it could have done with a little more brushing up on the grain.
325;Best to leave a whole afternoon to finish this epic in one sitting.
326;We are big fans of Robert De Niro and I am so glad that you offer this movie!

333;blooded adults, and finally emerge in an improbable future as well.
334;moving resurrection of the gritty world of immigrants of the early twentieth.
335;a classically great film, and mostly a good film as well.
336;This is a wonderful saga that spans the lifetimes of friends as they experience the ups and downs of lives in crime.
337;A well tols story and supremely acted.
338;Definitely one of DeNiros best performances.
339;"I found ""The Godfather"" movies one and two way more respectable than this."
340;Often touching, yet also boldly brutal at times, this film is like watching a 4 hour moving painting of images.
341;The score is haunting and will stay with you long after the images are gone.
342;Absorb it, and see it again and again.
343;On the one hand, allowing these characters to marinate in the audience's mind for four hours, including extended looks back into the lives of these gangsters as children, allows them to evolve and develop.
344;Sergio Leone's filmmaking is superb, but the plot does not seem to warrant or require the length of this edition.
345;the children's story and the spectacular ending of the film that I found emotionally electrifying.
346;that being said, _Once Upon a Time in America_ did manage to affect me and it is certainly worth a look, allowing the beautiful camera work and intriguing storyline to have its effect on you.
347;Robert Deniro, in 1984, is at his peak and delivers a commanding and scene stealing performance.
348;James Woods, as well, delivers a powerful performance, definitely holding his own with the likes of Deniro.
349;if you enjoy gangster films, Robert Deniro at his height of ability, and don't mind living inside the mind of Leone's beautiful filmmaking and these wonderful characters for four hours, you should watch this film.
350;Though some viewers might be put off by its length, graphic violence, and absence of likable characters, Sergio Leone's final film is also a cinematic masterpiece.
351;"Spanning four decades, the film tells the story of David ""Noodles"" Aaronson (Robert De Niro) and his ."
352;creation of the time period, the cinematography, and the music are all superb.
353;film mythology and a continuation of the director's exploration of the issues of time and history.
354;The film's strengths emerge only in its full 227.
355;I read that it you have this film on LD and watch it in slow mo that you can see some kind of spirit floating around in the dance.
356;It is a true classic!
357;having spent a lazy Sunday afternoon watching the complete version, I'm no longer quite baffled, but I still shrug my shoulders a bit at the masterpiece label.
358;but at least we get a lot of beautiful stuff, like Morricone's score and those lavish sets of New York, particularly in the adolescent sequences that take place in the early Twenties.
359;Leone shot these exteriors in New York, Montreal, and in Cinecitta studio, and the results are completely convincing to the degree that I think he surpassed Coppola's work in Godfather Part 2 .
360;He knows how good it all looks, too: he can afford to pan back and allow us to bask in scenic views of his work.
361;Shooting in deep focus, Leone clutters the screen with marvelous bric.
362;The sets are finally more realistic than the characters, I believe, though I also believe that, at least in this uncut version that Amazon is featuring on Prime, De Niro sells the character of Noodles.
363;It takes four hours of time for us to feel the weight of De Niro's past and how it colors his present, and that result comes from De Niro's fine work rather than the script itself.
364;Depressing stuff, but De Niro makes it work.
365;Excepting McGovern, the rest of the cast is fine, particularly a precocious Jennifer Connelly.
366;The characters do things, and things are done to them.
367;An excellent film of two men growing up in New York at the turn of the century.
368;One must really pay attention to understand this film.
369;Once upon a time has got to be the best file ever, its a stunning story of a group of young hoodlems who grow up into big time crooks.
370;Its an epic film that lasts over 3 and a half hours, but once you start watching you will not be able to stop.
371;He is so good that when you see these long glances he makes, you really get the impression he is just repeating the look over and over so that it can be edited out later on.
372;i researched this movie on Wikipedia and saw the the original US distribution actually did this and drastically edited the movie to make it shorter.
373;overall, it is worth watching.
374;The acting by some of the actors is great.
375;De Niro is great and so is Woods.
376;the story brings you full circle.
377;if you love old movies you will like to watch this.
378;Thank heaven that this version is the original one, as the shortened one was a ham.
379;One kind of moment, to be found in the show, is found in a scene you will not find in any U. s. made gangster flick.
380;He is taking it to a neighborhood girl who, it is known, will offer sexual favors in return for such offerings.
381;Waiting for her on the stairs leading up to her apartment, he unexpectedly finds himself torn between two temptations.
382;There is the anticipation of the gratification promised by the encounter with the girl but, right there before him, there is the cake, the chocolate icing, the sweet cream filling, the cherry on top.
383;This inventive plot device touchingly captures a vivid sense of life inside the mind of a young boy.
384;This is a long movie, with a large and brilliant cast, and too many amazing moments to recount here.
385;I found it wonderfully worth the effort required.
386;Note the magnificent score by Ennio Morricone.
387;Director Sergio Leone has produced an ambitious, complex, and moving portrayal of Jewish gangsters in the early 20th century.
388;and the payoff to this fine film.
389;James Woods delivers an explosive performance, as always.
390;It's gritty realism and devoted marriage to cinema has yet to lose one shred of its impact and bravery of a time now gone, and will be as strong today as it truly ever will.
391;After 16 years in the making, Leone along with his 322 page script set out to make what was to be his final masterpiece.
392;A True Landmark in Cinema History!
393;Deniro in a really great role.
394;A classic of its time.
395;One of the greatest movies made.
396;Editing of this movie is great.
397;Long movie, but worth the watch.
398;Excellent movie about the Jewish Mob during the prohibition era of America.
399;That's how some of our most famous Americans got their start.
400;There are admittedly some fine performances from the likes of James Woods, Treat Williams, Danny Aiello, Tuesday Weld and a much younger Jennifer Connely, but it is DeNiro's brilliance that almost saves the film.
401;He easily carries out the demands of portraying a man in his retirement years.
402;Warren Beatty's 1991 movie Bugsy is also a fantastic look at this almost forgotten era.
403;This is a must see movie for all fans of James Woods and Robert DeNiro.
404;It is long but you should enjoy every minute.
405;Really enjoyed the story and the graphics of the period.
406;Once Upon A Time In America is my all time favorite movie.
407;my Mother recorded it for me and mailed it to me.
408;i viewed it and loved it.
409;i had friends over and everyone enjoyed it.
410;my best friend and i viewed it at least once a week for months.
411;i recently learned that this is his favorite as well.
412;I give it 5 stars +.
413;A strong story doesn't need nudity.
414;This a great movie and the music is outstanding.
415;I love James Woods and Robert DiNiro's work anyway but they were very, very good in this movie.
416;The scenary was great and the plot was worth the wait.
417;"unite for the last time in ""Casino"", a lesser film)and the supporting cast is great with a young Joe Pesci and Treat Williams as a Hoffa like union organizer."
418;Love everything Leone and Quinton have produced and directed
419;after all, this is a movie about a man's interior dialogue with himself.
420;That either of these two interpretations can be deduced from the movie's narrative structure is testament to the brilliant conceit that Leone creates here: the only thing persistent in life is our memories (an idea to which Marcel Proust refers repeatedly).
421;'Once Upon a Time in America', simply put, is the best gangster movie I've ever seen and is one of the greatest movies ever made.
422;The entire film seems like long, beautiful, and scary dream.
423;I felt like I understood their every feeling and emotion, their joys and sadness.
424;Moviemaking is rarely this magical or this tragic.
425;A few words on this fine motion picture, Once upon a time in America .
426;the chemistry between all the artists is mesmerizing.
427;shades ofRififi,Good fellas,Score,Millers'Crossing,and so on.
428;released version was the eviscerated masterpiece others have claimed, and that this Special Edition would be a delight to view.
429;It proved intermittently watchable on fast.
430;"There were outstanding performances by secondary charactors
431;De Niro and Woods were solid in their standard personae.
432;The best way to view this movie would be with a fellow film buff with whom you could share many long, leisurely dinners (ala Noodles and Deborah) to discuss the story inconsistencies and dead ends, lack of character development, fascinating history, luscious cinematography, violence, aging makeup gaffes or mystique, and whatever else Leone has thunk up to add to the messy charm of this failed masterpiece.
433;Great Story Beautifully Executed:Once Upon A Time In America relates the story of the socalled """"Jewish Mafia"""" in New York."""
434;The story's great, the acting and direction are superb, including the sensitive rendition of the color spectrum.
435;Prodigy IBM Sears did the best review I have read.
436;A movie that is as good or even better than the Godfather.
437;It literally flowed like an unending mountain stream having rapids and rocks now and then with beautiful restful pools spaced in between where love could possibly bloom.
438;The more you watch, the more you feel so good.
439;I highly recommend to enjoy this film at least 10 times.
440;and feel happy with the well.
441;fantastic music by Ennio Morricone.
442;deNiro gives and exceptionally understated performance.
443;He's a sociopath at times, and the film's hero at other times.
444;this is arguably James Woods' best performance.
445;the film is complex, jumping between 3 periods of time.
446;Definitely on my top ten list of favorite movies.
447;This was a terrific movie that was overlooked by many.
448;A bit long but the story required it.
449;This dark masterpiece deserved an informative and intelligent commentary track.
450;Once again Richard Schickel seems more impressed with himself than the film.
451;All actors men and woemen were perfect in there rolls.
452;The story is gripping from beginning to end.
453;Robert de Niro is fantastic.
454;Ennio Morricone's music scores this film perfectly and is hauntingly beautiful.
455;one of the best gangster movies.
456;These are some of the best actors.
457;De Niro is always great.
458;Fantastic Movie, great storyline, great cast of actors.
459;best movie i've ever seen, watched 3 times on the road, best picture, best soundtrack, best editing and best storyline.
460;Sergio Leone gazes into the souls of several violent, sociopathic gangsters and finds heart and humanity amidst the savagery.
461;Worth the time of any film devotee.
462;Best Sergio Leone ever finally on Blu.
463;A 3 hour+ epic that spans the lives of a group of young street kids in turn of the century New York.
464;Deborah is Max's lifelong love, but___well, see the movie.
465;"Sergio Leone's sprawling gangster epic ""Once Upon A Time In America"" is an artful film deserving of classic status, sadly overlooked thanks to studio butchery in the 1980s."
466;"fans of ""The Godfather Part II"" will be at home with ""Once Upon A Time In America's"" quirk of moving back and forth between time periods."
467;"If you know the style Leone strutted on ""Once Upon A Time In The West,"" you'll be familiar with the pacing here."
468;those who relish in the kind of tempo Leone works in, those who enjoy dwelling in a moment, in letting images tell the story, will absolutely love Leone's filmmaking here.
469;All the style he developed over his beloved spaghetti westerns is on display here, tenfold.
470;As far as this reviewer is concerned, Leone crafted a pure work of art.
471;The picture looks good, though could probably use some remastering, and the sound is nice.
472;There is a brief 20.
473;existing documentary on Sergio Leone, and a solid commentary track.
474;Once Upon A Time In America is certainly one of the great gangster films ever made, loaded with style and grace, and should be seen at least once by all who love film.
475;this was an incredible story of growing up in the streets of new York during the prohibition era.
476;a true life portrait of kids who were forced into adulthood in order to survive.
477;it is about friends growing up in the underworld and later they go on into bootleging.
478;but all in all its a good flick
479;It is one of my family's favorite.
480;It is a little long, but still a good storyline.
481;The acting was great, the story was good.
482;This is a very good movie and one of those movies you can't miss anything or you will be lost at the end.
483;I was very thrilled when I discovered that Amazon had it for sale.
484;This new version of the story is much clearer.
485;All in all it is a very good movie.
486;A flawless Leone interpretation of a gangster movie.
487;Said by some to be an opium dream , the film lives up to the expectation.
488;to see the full uncut version is to understand how the narrative rings true.
489;the original Leone version is epic.
490;the music is absolutely beautiful.
491;ray is a splendidly mastered version of this grand gangster epic .
492;a masterwork by the great Italian director, Sergio Leone.
493;length version presented with film.
494;like accuracy, and superior color.
495;timing, that bests the special.
496;like flashbacks and full of powerful psychosexual emotions, it is loaded with grandiose set pieces and remarkable performances, all capped with a lush, evocative score by Ennio Morricone.
497;One of the greatest films of it's era, now in a brilliant, high.
498;definition version that captures the essence of the original International theatrical release (including the intermission card).
499;through a brilliant set of flash.
500;Its difficult to say exactly whether this was first of its kind of story telling in 1982, but definitely smart and intelligent.
501;What I also liked was the use of color in the movie.
502;another asset of this movie is the music.
503;Ennio Morricone is simply a genius to write such a score.
504;"I'll see your ""Godfather"" your ""Godfellas"" your ""Departed"" and your ""Scarface"" and still beat you every time with ""Once Upon a Time in America""."
505;It also has something that many other movies, not just mobster movies forget, great charecter development.
506;It has a great cast and a great story to go with it although it can throw people off with the quick pace with which it changes points of view.
507;when you finally get it you will be amazed how attached and interested you get in the affairs of David 'Noodles' Aaronson and his friends.
508;give it a shot if you like a good movie
509;I enjoyed this so much .
510;This helped add appreciation, insight and cleared up a few connections that had eluded me the first time through.
511;Powerful music and performances throughout.
512;Try to pay careful attention since it goes back and forth in time.
513;Best gangster/mobster movie of all time IMO.
514;The acting, De Niro, Woods and others was great.
515;A movie that one can watch again and again and never tire of it.
516;More importantly, the incredible film score wormed its way into my subconscious and slowly began to reemerge as I grew older and realized the genius of Ennio Morricone.
517;When it came in the mail I popped it in the VCR immediately and relived all of the amazing moments of the film, with renewed appreciation and a more mature understanding.
518;everything about this film is perfect.
519;The acting is wonderful on all fronts, the music score is absolutely haunting.
520;some of Morricone's best themes, in my opinion.
521;the editing is incredible, and the sets are breathtaking.
522;The other is Leone's depiction of women in the film.
523;It encompasses a huge range of emotion and humanity within its chosen subject of organized crime.
524;I have planned on getting this movie as I have liked it since I first saw it.
525;I could write a lengthy review, but quite a bit has been said about this great movie.
526;Now, I am by no means a Sergio Leone fan, but he deserved the Oscar for Direction for this film.
527;"I firmly believe that this film stands up there with ""The Godfather, Part II"", ""Casablanca"", and ""Citizen Kane"" as one of the greatest films ever released (maybe the best)."
528;Brilliant, poetic visuals, great photography and fantastic performances across the board.
529;robert DeNiro is fantastic as always as Noodles.
530;Their performances, as well as the two leads at the very least deserved, but didn't recieve any, Academy Award nominations.
531;Ennio Morricone's score was as beautiful and evocative as one would expect from the master of the Italian score.
532;Sit back, take the phone off the hook and prepare for a cinematic experience.
533;Chock full of top rated actors and a great story about early life in America.
534;A Must See movie and one of my classics!
535;I give the motion picture itself 5 stars, the studio's 1987 VHS two.
536;Once Upon A Time In America, particularly in its long version, is a masterpiece.
537;A bit long but well worth it.
538;Excellent plot, ending and acting.
539;I firmly believe that there are works of art that are simply a masterpiece in itself irregardless of whether or not popular culture recognizes it to be so.
540;The compliments are often bestowed upon its cinematography and while the color and feel of the movie is perfect and gorgeous, the many complaints about its length and confusing plotline is ungrounded.
541;The movie is quite worth the 227 minutes playtime and makes sense well enough when isn't cut into a shorter version.
542;leone's masterpiece is often compared to the Godfather series and often comes up the less favorable brother of the two.
543;Leone creates an artistically beautiful film to watch, but his actors beautifully, and tragically [sometimes violently], humanize their respective characters.
544;Robert de Niro and his younger counterpart Scott Tiler do an amazing job capturing the angry innocence of this young man that grows old to be a troubled man.
545;Also wonderful performances by Jennifer Connelly as his younger love interest and James Woods as de Niro's doppleganger.
546;this is a movie that leaves an haunting impression behind.
547;Amazing movie that will leave you remembering it, if not loving it for its tragedy.
548;This is no masterpiece, unless by 'masterpiece' you mean epic in duration.
549;up days, the interest continues.
550;done orchestral score at times.
551;"i've always been a fan of Sergio Leone, as well as DeNiro and company, but ""Once Upon A Time in America"" has nothing over the Scorcese/DeNiro classics (Taxi Driver, Good Fellas, Casino ."
552;It's one of the most majestic, moving epics ever made.
553;And considering Leone hadn't directed a film in 12 years makes it all the more remarkable.
554;Everything in this film comes together so well.
555;Performances, direction, and Ennio Morricone's music is the most moving score he ever did for Leone.
556;Morricone and Leone had probably the most unique collaboration in the history of cinema.
557;Critics, for once, helped this film get noticed.
558;Then Warner Brothers released the uncut version to arthouse theaters, and the film was recognised as a classic.
559;The film is like an epic novel, unfolding slowly, layer by layer, until the sad, melancholy ending.
560;But that's up for debate.
561;A great work of art like this inspires debate.
562;This is his deepest work, a film that will last forever.
563;This is a beautiful piece with a gorgeous soundtrack and it draws you in gradually, bit by bit, until you are entirely engulfed in the progress of the film and the development of the characters.
564;It is, in a way, like a beautifully.
565;So, when and if you watch this film, sit back, relax, and enjoy the dance.
566;So I popped it into my VCR, and watched a very moving, bitterweet, heart.
567;cat like grinning WILLIAM FORSYTHE, the son of the late great John Forsythe and a good actor in his own right ), and young Dominic, who plays a pivotal role in the movie and is a catalyst for some very important parts of the film.
568;In the movie the other characters are very well.
569;played by the actors who played them and they're like people you would have known in any neighborhood you grew up in like these 5 Jewish kids did: Maggie, Fat Moe, and the love of Noodle's life, Deborah ( played by a very young Jennifer Connelly as a child ).
570;tag kids on the streets of Brooklyn, New York to their most successful period when started their soon.
571;be successful criminal enterprise during 1930's Prohibition America, to when their success came to an abrupt end and to the rash decision that led to the introduction of the personal demons Noodles carried with him for the rest of his life.
572;forwards, it's in the present day ( Noodle's present day, the 1960's ) and all the while the haunting soundtrack by Ennio Morricone and the masterful playing of the Pan flute by Gheorghes Zamfir plays in the background.
573;noodles carries a heavy burden upon himself his entire life.
574;The interplay by Robert de Niro and James Woods in this movie is amazing, they really seem to be like brothers, always bickering, fighting, squabbling, and trying to outdo one another.
575;As it all plays out everything is revealed like a chess game, the opponents who are like brothers know each so well, and this story about two brothers torn apart by the circumstances of life reaches it's end.
576;"The story is long, sometimes it can be overdrawn and boring, it's a "" flawed "" masterpiece like so many masterpieces that were destined to be great but for one reason or another laced the right direction or source of confidence to make them great."
577;The acting is stellar, the scenery is breathtaking ( if you like the concrete, potholes, rat.
578;infested stinky slums of Brooklyn ), the music fits perfectly into the overall mood of the movie, and you should really just sit down and try to enjoy yourself while you watch it.
579;, which is exactly what I thought when Noodles left the train station a young man and came back a wise elder.
580;A beautiful, great, haunting movie.
581;The soundtrack is espcially nice so pick that up too, it will relax you and make you feel good on the days you want to reflect upon your life Have fun!
582;So vivid in detail, shockingly so, it seems to be more of a documentary than drama.
583;An amazingly effective cast and stellar director/writer Sergio Leone make the difference.
584;It was a disgusting segment of society, and this film gives the period and underworld segment its true flavor.
585;While trying to find out who seduced him back, he relives the childhood gang days (the most delightful 1920s portion), then the sinister underworld activity of the 1930s, and also the mysterious sleuthing return in 1968.
586;That format in storytelling works dramatically in this film.
587;There is some extra stuff worth the look, and without the blood and evil.
588;I'd recommend it to ADULT friends with strong stomachs.
589;Masterfully acted, directed, created, in all ways, but it is just hard to brush away that phlegm.
590;I remember when this movie was broadcasted on prime time TV as a miniseries (I think either a two night or three night thing), and I thought Jennifer Connelly was the most beautiful actress, and I made an effort to remember her.
591;Then she starred in Labyrinth and later became famous and won an Oscar.
592;But aside from having Jennifer Connelly in it, this gangster movie has a strong cast and characters.
593;And tells a great story.
594;It jumps around in sequence of timeline, so the characters are old then in flashback they are kids.
595;When the gangsters are kids, is my favorite part of the movie because it shows how clever these guys are, up to their tricks and con jobs, of making some bucks.
596;Digging beneath the surface we see that really, it's a story about love and friendship.
597;Most importantly, it creates an atmosphere of nostalgia and regret which permeates the whole film, underscored beautifully by Ennio Morricone.
598;These are the things that remain after everything else has long been forgotten, and it's the indescribably beautiful way in which these ideas are expressed in story.
599;telling format, which creates a film that lives long in the memory.
600;gives great attention to seemingly small details without, in my opinion, being artsy, pretentious or excessively indulgent.
601;Leone's films are as much about everyday life as they are about friendship, American capitalism, revolutions, the Old West or any other grand themes you care to mention.
602;The director is constantly reminding us that everyday actions are just as important.
603;the potential of film as a medium to leave you believing you have witnessed something truly profound is seldom fulfilled to the extent I believe it has been with this film.
604;Together, they have collaborated to produce a cinematic experience, which transcends far beyond the sum of their individual contributions.
605;A partnership forged in film to rival the likes of that forged by Lennon and McCartney in music, at least in recent decades.
606;Morricone's genius is a match for Leone's and sometimes leaves you wondering, which came first, the story or the music.
607;but this comes closer than most)
608;de Niro displayed once more his abilities and James Woods is standout in this Gargantuan picture of 225 min.
609;But the narrative solvency, extraordinary script and sumptuous stage well deserve it.
610;At first we were making fun of the staginess of the scenes then at some point the whole thing starts to make sense.
611;A lot better than the reviews.
612;but OUATIA really grew on me, and I think it is a masterpiece.
613;But it is great in its own way.
614;Noodles is the ultimate loser, played with great subtlety by De Niro.
615;His childhood friends Max and Deborah go on to great things, and become wealthy and prominent.
616;respect and is comfortable with where he is, even if he has many regrets.
617;For example, the central moment of the film .
618;"con, is remarkably like the Lewis character in ""Jackie Brown""."
619;Then somehow he is sitting in the boat again, safe and well, grinning at Noodles.
620;last of all, there is the haunting and unforgettable end to the Max character.
621;I'd also like to share an idea I have.
622;But I hope these points are enough to show what I think is the staggering depth of this film.
623;You can find endless fascinating things to notice in this extremely sumptuous film.
624;If there is a heaven I can only hope that:1.
625;Sergio Leone will be there and he will show all the movies he never got to make while he was alive.
626;Robert De Niro and James Woods best performance ever.
627;The picking of the characters was most excellent as to where the children looked identical to the adults, and the makeup as when they were older was superb.
628;Yes, there are masterful moments, but many irritations, as well, in this long, long film.
629;like I said, it was a great movie.
630;First off, the movie transformation to me was great.
631;But, to me, that makes it all the more interesting.
632;I am happy to report for me that it was just as enjoyable as I remember so long ago.
633;Yet, for some reason, The Godfather Part II (which I think is the best of all three Godfathers) ran about 207 minutes and was not told in a completely linear fashion (skipping back and forth between Vito's past and Michael's present), but it was considered an excellent movie (and I agree).
634;The butchered release of Once Upon a Time in America that was shown in the US did nothing but destroy what I feel is one of the greatest story telling movies.
635;To see how this gang evolved over 50 years from young punks, to successful gangsters to nothing is fascinating.
636;get this movie and go for a swim!
637;My favorite movie of all time, edging out Catch.22.
638;This is one of the best movies ever!!!
639;A little language and a couple of rough scenes, but extremely well done
640;a. mob story, enhanced and improved, and even elevated, by the performances of De Niro, Pesci, Woods, and a cast of hundreds.
641;i admire this film way more than I actually like it.
642;still, it needs to be viewed at least once by anyone who actually loves movies.
643;The movie itself is definitely worth watching, but one major knock is how a good scene is cut.
644;In 2013, we can easily fit the entire film on one disc.
645;The acting and the directing are perfect.
646;Everything in the movie seemed so authentic for that time period.
647;Overall, I loved it and will watch it again in the future.
648;Sergio Leone's final masterpiece ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA is by far a unique and amazing piece of filmmaking by one of the cinema's greatest Italian directors since Fellini and De Sica.
649;minute uncut version and in a beautifully preserved 1:85.1 aspect ratio,Disc one innapropriately stops in the middle of the Diamond Robbery scene,even though the disc jacket says it ends directly at the intermission title card!!
650;Sergio Leone is one of the great film directors of all time.
651;Many of his films rank amongst the best films ever made.
652;One of the best movies ever made!!
653;I am ordering another to give as a gift.
654;I enjoy these types of movies.
655;keeps u on the edge of your seat.
656;I had already seen it but enjoyed it again
657;Good movie, good cast, good directing.
658;disc movie and runs about 4 hours, but worth it.
659;One of the greatest movies ever made.
660;The first half of this film is wonderful in the same way that the first half of goodfellas is.
661;It shows how a young gang of kids in new york city grows up to become the cities most powerful mobsters.
662;I thoroughly enjoyed this part, but I felt as if the movie had graduated to a higher level of film when the next part begun, because the next part is the truly mind boggling part of the story.
663;She hasn't aged, he has.
664;Well that sounds very witty, but I don't think so.
665;that aside, the acting and cinematography are wonderful.
666;This movie speaks for itself.
667;d) Deleted scenes: NONEe) Alternate ending: NONEf) Spanish French: NONEg) Booklet: NONE4) And finally this informative commentary, that was worth including.
668;Tell you what, I found a greek version.
669;I love gangster films (prohibition/depression era) and this one stands above the rest.
670;This version really is a few steps up!
671;This really tells a story now in the 229 minute format.
672;prohibition enriched a few entrepeneurial spirits in its day and funded a group of Jewish thugs.
673;sergio Leone has a flamboyant streak for this genre which is evident in the music, the script.
674;a good film, not great.
675;In making a film about the effects of guilt and betrayal both real and imagined, Sergio Leone also made a film about the numbing poignancy of the passage of time.
676;"The film is long, the plot is complex, and some elements of the story are rearranged into an emotional vs. a straight narrative order, but the overall effect is extraordinarily efficient
677;Plus, what a marvelous cast .
678;My only problems with the film are minor technical gaffs (the use of cold cream to try to unsucessfully age an obviously still very young Elizabeth McGovern, etc.), otherwise, this is simply a wonderful, powerful movie.
679;The senses and emotions of the film will linger much longer than the story.
680;In the beginning when Deniro sees his friends on the ground dead after a heist which we think is orchestrated by James Woods, one of them is burnt to a crisp and unrecognizable.
681;She tells him she wants to go to Hollywood and Deniro seemed to be very understanding of this AND why she couldn't be with him.
682;This was 25 years ago and it still is the best film I have ever seen.
683;DeNiro has a few films that many have never heard of and are terrific movies, this is one of them.
684;You have to savor this film like a fine wine.
685;For me it's Godfater part .2 , Goodfellas, Once Upon A Time in America.
686;I would highly recommend this movie,The cast just keeps pounding out the preformance that we come to know and love.
687;robert De niro,James woods,Joe Pesci, Burt Young just to name a few principal characters.
688;So dim the lights get the popcorn and enjoy.
689;the story is great, the acting is superb, the length is awsome (3 hr.
690;Superb acting, an outstanding story, captivating music, true.
691;life scenes and impeccible directing.
692;This is truly an American epic.
693;One of the best productions ever made.
694;One of the best roles De niro and Woods ever play.
695;I have loved this film from the first time I saw it.
696;The 2 hour was the actual theatrical release which also killed this movie at the box office as well as robbed it of it's place in history as one of the great movies of all time.
697;He also won the bet, and capped off one of the best performances of the film.
698;An apt description for this movie too!
699;It was outstanding and the acting was first rate.
700;The story was well structured and covered a lot of territory but they kept it relatively easy to follow.
701;An instant classic movie I'd never grow tired of seeing!
702;What really grabs me in the background music.
703;Amapola is a great tune and its many apprearances throughout the movie really tie the story together.
704;This movie ranks amoung the best.
705;Make sure you have plenty of time to view and that you get the extended version.
706;Watch a couple of times to get the full effect of the film.
707;The movie featured a great cast and a wonderful story of growing up and friendship.
708;it sort of dragged in places but was worth the watch.
709;the real story is about his relationships with his friends and others he has known since childhood, and how those relationships evolved over the years.
710;Approach this as a story about people in that era as seen through the eyes of one man reminiscing about his life as he ultimately makes an unexpected final confrontation with his past.
711;The film's slower pacing is appropriate for this, allowing the viewer to savor, absorb and contemplate what is occurring, and why.
712;Leone is a master of using realistic sounds of everyday life to drive the environment in which the story takes place.
713;It's similar to his Once Upon A Time In the West in pacing and epic length.
714;ray transfer video and audio to be quite good.
715;It's the epic film as Sergio Leone intended it to be distributed, and how it was distributed outside the US.
716;It's a magnificent story about a man who happened to be a Jewish NYC gangster during the Prohibition Era, but it's not a gangster drama.
717;the score is so overrated.
718;Better than a lot of movies.
719;Next to the GodFather I and II, this is the best film I've ever seen.
720;If you like the Godfather and/or the Sopranos, you'll love """"Once Upon A Time in America""""."""
721;the acting, story line, and ability to show a forty year timeline and make it believable.
722;I have loved it for years and it seems to improve every time I watch it.
723;My 20 year old tape is far better (although the sound isn't as good).
724;What a masterpiece is all I can really say about this movie.
725;It is a gem and will hold the test of time like no other.
726;Once again Sergio Leone proves that he is the master of the classically American genre film, this time training his exquisite eye from the Western to the gangster film.
727;"length commentary track is also a joy to watch/listen to.But Warner Brothers REALLY dropped the ball by deciding to split the film into two equal lengths for the purpose of placing it on 2 discs
728;As it is, the perfect realization of the film that was by all admissions nearest and dearest to the Italian film maestro's heart still eludes him, even in this digital age.
729;A terrific film, beautifully and lovingly shot as always, speaking to the emotions of the viewer in a way that so many American directors simply can't pull off.
730;Many of you have seen this, you should watch it again.
731;tells his life to himself to exonerate his role in this act.
732;Leone fools you into believing the contemporary scenes are real just as the De Niro character fools himself .
733;day New York never becomes a place like the beautiful rendering of turn.
734;I believe this has to be one of the most inventive plots I have ever seen in a motion picture, not only is it about how punks and all of us with some punk in us romanticize ourselves, but how the American culture does the same to the gangsters and cowboys of our fiction.
735;Leone is a masterful director, many of the scenes just crackle with energy and the acting is superb, I guess that would be why.
736;But Leone is also a very indulgent director and all that is on display as well.
737;still (another way of saying but) it is a masterpiece despite being a rough road.
738;i was just read the novel and, i was very impressed when i was only 16.
739;Then i watched the movie, this film is one of the bests of Sergio Leone, and story is really big, its a must to have for all movie archieves.
740;This is a classic Noodles tale!
741;An epic story and drama that leaves one alittle tender at the end.
742;This film , directed by Sergio Leone is , arguably, one of the best of all time.
743;And, likely, Leone's finest film!
744;the score by Ennio Morriconne is haunting, nostalgic and evokes emotion from the film's scenes in a near perfect choreography of dialogue and music.
745;i watched a cut version recently on AMC and while, this is the official American release version, it is a powerful film of substance.
746;grab the new, uncut version of this film and enjoy it, whenever you long for the types of movies that made us fans.
747;the beauty and acting of both, are superb.
748;Once Upon a Time in the West was a masterwork by a great artist.
749;Once Upon a Time in America is an overindulgent mess with nothing to say that is worthwhile or even interesting.
750;This is a great movie.
751;Excellent storyline, characters and plot.
752;I rate this movie up there with the Godfather.
753;Superb movie, a materpiece and one of the best movies of all time!
754;Rated on the top 100 of imdb!
755;Robert De Niro was great throughout.
756;It brings me back to Ennio Morricone's music.
757;i am sure real thugs were not as glamorous as shown on celluloids, but it's a credit to Sergio Leone's artistic skill that he has been able to create a time capsule and a world where we are immersed and feel the time it captures.
758;That's where all men of power and especially American men of power belong.
759;That's seems to be the final statement of this film and what a grand statement it is!This is a political film although it is an allegorical one.
760;given duty to do!And to be able to see this film and it's correct depiction of what America truly stands for, is a little starter on the way towards truth that anyone should be able to bear and relish.
761;the land of great adventures, maybe you say?
762;Very pleased with the early secure delivery and with the product itself .
763;This is one of the very best movies of all time.
764;I do remember that I knew it was powerful the first time I saw it.
765;Also, the Ennio Morriconne score is one of his best, perhaps the most haunting of his career.
766;I loved it each time.
767;For most movies, a running time half of that is pushing it.
768;there are a lot of great scenes.
769;A lot of great violent scenes (the opener for starters.
770;it's packed with a lot of great stuff.
771;So three stars it is.
772;This movie is a classic!
773;I saw it years ago and still credit it for fueling my interest in American history.
774;Sergio Leone, the Italian director whose Westerns """"Fistful of Dollars"""", """"For a Few Dollars More,"""" and """"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"""" redefined the Western and catapulted Clint Eastwood to stardom, here produces his masterpiece."""
775;This is a powerful epic that not only gives a new mythic dimension to the gangster film but adds a fresh perspective to the immigrant experience.
776;so why do I admire this film so much?
777;Because, violence aside, it's more powerful and compelling viewing than most films of the last twenty years.
778;The reconstruction of early 20th century New York is visually stunning, but this is almost incidental to the richly detailed performances of the five child actors who play the young gangsters.
779;As they become adults, and the story is blended with Prohibition and the growth of the labor movement, this film gives us a harsh, quick.
780;cut view of a nation in the throes of growing pains.
781;At close to four hours, it's probably best to watch discs one and two on consecutive evenings.
782;Try watching the beginning again after you've finished the picture.
783;I remember watching this movie as a young girl on HBO.
784;The most beautiful part of the film is the music score by Ennio Morricone.
785;Hauntingly tragic music that helps keep the movie moving.
786;But overall the movie is still stirring and definately gave Martin Scorsese something to reinvent with Gangs of New York.
787;a great movie worth seeing
788;Powerful and well acted this is a movie you'll watch again and again.
789;The story, the majority of which is set in the New York of the 1920's, is a compelling tale about friendship, gangs, jewish immigrants and ultimately, betrayal.
790;Robert DeNiro, I believe, gives his finest performance as the taciturn Noodles, who is setup by his friend and leader of the gang, Max (James Woods).
791;Every actor in this movie gives a compelling performance.
792;This is undoudoutbly one of my favourivite films of all times, wanting to see this film for some time, after seeing all the over classic gangsta films.
793;The athuencity of the clothes, cars, and buildings made me actually feel like I was in New york.
794;The seens of young noodles et al as kids were unbelieveble, and the musical score was one of the best ever.
795;Great movie with two of my favorite actors in it a must see for mafia movie fans that love action
796;I personally love Robert De Niro in this film.
797;it is a true classic of the mob.
798;I am a fan of0 mob movies and this is in the top ten.
799;De Niro is the best man for the movie, to make it 100 percent great.
800;The pic was nice and clear,and I was able to hear everything clearly.
801;i would recommend this to any DeNiro fan, fan of action, true mafia movies.
802;I'd like to see the original directors cut of this epic.
803;The film on Prime is still very worth watching.
804;My friend and I, both fans of the shorter VHS version for years, watched it last night.
805;One of the best mob movies ever.
806;A Classic movie that get an A+.
807;Anything with Robert Dinero I like.
808;It had a great cast also.
809;This is a favorite of mine.
810;Just a great movie about friends growing up and becoming deeply involved in crime throughout their lives and how it shapes their relationship.
811;Some parts a bit slow but overall worth the watch.
812;All top notch actors and an interesting plot.
813;it is audacious for a director to attempt a project along the same lines as the Oscar Winning duo released in the early 70's.
814;I was surprised that Leone's movie did not recieve one Oscar nomination for this 4 hour epic.
815;"leone's picture exists in a much more ""dog eat dog"" world, with alot of hurt spread out to every character."
816;"The decision to depict turn of the century gangs is the most original aspect of the movie
817;His return to New York city after decades of hiding """"like a rat"""" provides the introduction to his trip down memory lane, guiding the film's progression, which switches from the late 1960's back to the streets of their youth."""
818;I was just so amazed at the films grandoisity, complex plotline, acting and cinematography.
819;Robert De Niro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Tuesday Weld and the rest of the cast gives great performances, including the child actors.
820;I really liked how the film moved in weird order from plot time period to time period as it made the film much more interesting.
821;And holy #%@$ is that plot complex and captivating.
822;There is so much symbolism and complexity in the plot its almost absurd but it makes the film all the more enjoyable.
823;The ending twist is absolutely amazing, and it concludes the film perfectly.
824;I can safely say I'm not a person with a terribly great attention span as I'm somewhat borderline ADD but I was glued to the Television for the entire movie, as its shifting complex plot and elegant cinematography and Leone's grand vision kept my eyes glued to the Television screen.
825;Highly reccommended for any films of De Niro or gangster films as this the best gangster film and ties for best de niro film with taxi driver!
826;Great must see highly recommended.
827;This movie will leave you spellbound.
828;This movie is rated R for a reason.
829;How could a movie be so wonderfully crafted with those items, it just is.
830;The best way to describe this movie is that it is not about gangsters, but rather, friendship.
831;It takes one through a historical perspective of prohibition, but just so amazingly crafted.
832;The costume dress is superb, the acting is spectacular, and the plot is engaging.
833;Every element of the film is perfect.
834;"A movie of ""heavy stuff"" yet well crafted."
835;and please keep in mind the 2 greatest killers the world has produced,Herr Hitler and Comrade Stalin.
836;A true masterpiece in the history of cinema.
837;leone creates a sublime example of form and content fusing to produce an art text.
838;here is a film showing the viewer the pure and unique form of cinema and why it is the most potent and influential medium of communication.
839;This is one of the great, forgotten films.
840;The music being played during this sequence is Yesterday by the Beatles.
841;This film is one of the best i have seen in all my years of living!The performances are out of this world with the great Robert De Niro taking the lead role.
842;the costumes and set up of scenery are stunning and the story is one that has and will touch many peoples hearts for years to come.
843;this brilliant story of friendship during the prohibitation era makes you think and the continous flashbacks going over period of four decades gives the best impact on the viewer to understanding the characters and the harsh times they have gone through.
844;the music score is fantastic and I recommend to anyone who hasn't seen this film should see it without a doubt!ENJOY
845;great cast, great story and maybe the best music in any movie I ever watched.
846;And it's stunning in every way a movie can be!
847;The story is wonderful, the screenplay has the slow but unstoppable flow of a mighty river, and visually, it looks like a renaissance painting in motion.
848;At times it is very hard to watch for the violence but over all a very enjoyable movie.
849;This movie rates right up there with the Godfather in my opinion.
850;I recommend this movie to anyone that likes an era movie that involves mobsters.
851;i live with Happy Guy!!
852;:):) He loves this movie!
853;great movie could not find it any where, thank you.
854;It could have, with good editing, been a better movie had it been only a little over two hours in length.
855;jennifer Connelly gives a good performance of a very young Deborah.
856;i can't recommend this film even though it has a great cast.
857;Maybe one of the best movies ever!!
858;Acting superb and story fantastic.
859;ray version is awesome!A must for DeNiro fans, one of the great gangster movies of all times.
860;the director and cast were amazing.
861;The reason for this: the beauty of the images (particularly the shots of New.York bridges), the emotion conveyed by the music (by Ennio Morricone), but above all, the very particular construction of its story, made of constant flashes.
862;back which, far from disturbing you, makes its nostalgia extremely touching.
863;A wonderful crime epic that spans a lifetime of the characters in the story.
864;Good movie, a classic, make sure to watch the longer version!
865;Definitely make sure you're getting the longer version .
866;otherwise its a movie that all Robert Deniro fans should watch once.
867;this is a great movie must watch must own its definitely a instant classic and it will make you want to watch it again and again.
868;A story of trust and betrayal and of sincerity.
869;I've always felt that, with the exception of THE GODFATHER TRILOGY, this Sergio Leone.
870;directed epic is, by far, the best of the modern gangster films.
871;You can always tell the winners.
872;elizabeth McGovern is DeNiro's childhood sweetheart, an aspiring actress who, though she loves him, realizes that this is a bittersweet romance that can never be.
873;Leone, incidentally, has also done a remarkable job in recreating and photographing New York of the 20s, 30s and 60s.
874;Just try it, your gonna love this film.
875;Epic, extravagant, brilliant, brutal, dark, touching .
876;This Italian masterpiece, by director Sergio Leone best known for his spaghetti Westerns, is possibly the most underrated and terrific gangster saga ever told.
877;it is said the American version broke Leone's heart, being that it was put under the knife, and he never made another film before his death in 1989.
878;ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA is a true epic crime saga that will go down in history and an absolute must own for any true film buff.
879;I was excited to see this because it was about the Jewish gangster era.
880;It is true that the cinematography is brilliant and the production design is top.
881;It is a very authentic.
882;The climactic scene is anything but climactic.
883;You can count on two fingers the number of times Deniro changes facial expressions.
884;He practically sleepwalks through the film.
885;The Godfather films triumph because the characters have redeeming qualities that balance out thier evil deeds.
886;I loved this movie the first time I saw it, which, unfortunately, was the bad edit made for American release, according to what I've read.
887;edited order with additional content, it made so much more sense and was far more enjoyable.
888;The acting and music make it a true epic feature, and I dare say it's something that people need to see, to have this understanding of the basis of America in many aspects.
889;I am so glad to finally own this disc and enjoy this story when I want to.
890;Once Upon a Time in Am rica is undoubtfully one of the best movies ever made.
891;The plot is original, the characteres and the actors just perfect, the photography outstanding.
892;i really think this film is Good.
893;robert De Niro James Woods work very well through out this film.
894;the action is a must see.
895;burt Young is a trip in this film.
896;very solid Direction through out.
897;Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America was released almost 20 years ago, and it is still one of my all time favorite films.
898;The film spans over a period of 20 years.
899;The story fastforwards 20 years into the future where childhood friends Max ( James Woods) and Noodles (Robert De Niro) form a partnership to run a powerful crime organization along with the rest of their childhood buddies .
900;Once Upon a Time in America utilizes the four basic traits of human nature .
901;friendship, crime, love, and betrayal, to create one of the most dramatic and rich stories ever captured on screen.
902;Robert De Niro, James Woods, William Forsythe, Elizabeth McGovern, Treat Williams, Larry Rapp, James Hayden, Joe Pesci, and Danny Aiello were all unbelieveable and each helped to bring the story to life.
903;This film marked the first time appearance of Jennifer Connely, and even then at the age of 14, you could tell that she was a fantastic actress.
904;The authenticity that the photos provided to the settings was absolutely outstanding, and were the film's best feature.
905;the actors, well developed story, and stunning authenticity really provide for a wonderful film.
906;Once Upon A Time in America offers a look at the dark side of the American dream that you can watch time and time again.
907;Leone masterfully recreates New York in the 1910s and '30s, but then insists on labouring absolutely every scene, while irritating us with ringing telephones, clinking teaspoons or Morricone's morbid soundtrack.
908;This film is a profound expression of truth regarding friendship and betrayal.
909;Sergio Leone's masterpiece of growing up in immigrant America is probably one of the first, and finest Leone movies I'd ever seen.
910;James Woods and Robert DeNrio are spectacular as the two friends' whose life in prohibition.
911;Ennio Morricone's score is beautiful and haunting, while Leone's cuts are long and patient.
912;I am a huge fan of gangster movies, and I do recommend this one, as well as Goodfellas, Miller's Crossing, and the Untouchables.
913;From the opening scenes of the flash backs, flash forward moving in and out of various time periods the first 45 minutes alone shows this movie is a true master piece.
914;Acting from all the cast is first rate and Sergio Leone made is best film ever.
915;Looking back at his career from the Eastwood man with no name triogy to Once Upon A Time In The West (another stunning film) you can see the progression of Leone's genius ending with Once Upon A Time In Amercia.
916;All of these movies have character's on one level or another you respect and root for.
917;"The cinematography in this movie is great and worth seeing
918;No review really does justice to the brilliance of Leone's masterwork.
919;But note that there are a number of variations of this film with running times in and around this length.
920;This was an excellent value for the money spent.
921;it has to be the finest of the genre.
922;sergio Leone has offered us a very rare and wonderful portrait of what it must have been like to live on 1920s New York,not in rich and elite circles but in poor and underpriveleged Jewish underclass circles.
923;the film is replete with humour as well,who will ever forget the baby exchange and who cannot identify with the lad waiting to see the young lady being unable to resist the wonderful cake he had bought her ?
924;Robert De Niro is fantastic as the unhappy and strangly moral """"Noodles"""" and one cannot imagine better casting for the role of """"Rebecca"""" than Elizabeth McGovern,a breathtakingly beautiful woman."""
925;there is the possibility that it could be the greatest film made in the twentieth century,at least in America !
926;An excellent picture indeed with lots of flashbacks and Twists.
927;an epic tale about the Jewish mafia in N.Y. c.
928;DeNiro has an exhilerating performance.
929;Also James Woods was great for supporting actor.
930;danny Aiello and William Forsythe have excellent performances that bring to the screen.
931;Even Frank Millileto who is played by Joe Pesci does a brilliant job in Sergio Leones film.
932;This movie is just absolutely awesome.
933;DiNero, and Woods were fantastic.
934;I just love Mobsters movies.
935;This is one of the best movies featuring Robert De Niro.
936;Even if you saw this 20 years ago you will still enjoy it.
937;Okay of course someone saw that I love Gangsta movies, and books and suggested that this had to be one for the collection.
938;i love Robert DeNiro, and James Wood, and seeing them together cinched it.
939;Sergio Leone's final sprawling epic is finally presented in all it's restored glory on this 2.
940;At 229 minutes, this is the longest cut of the film to ever see the light of day, and while some may see Once Upon a Time in America as an exercise in indulgence (and let's face it, it can be at some points) one can't deny the lasting power of Leone's final film.
941;"It may not achieve the same type of greatness as The Godfather, Goodfellas, etc.
942;Though Once Upon a Time in America departs from Sergio Leon'e traditional stlye of Italian Westerns, it still stands as a great movie.
943;The movie follows the life of Jewish gangsters from childhood until adulthood giving great incites to the characters and helps to define the movie.
944;It will make your experience of the story much, much richer.
945;alone movie it is excellent .
946;the performances were outstanding, the sets magnificent and the evocation of a time long gone priceless.
947;The best part for me was seeing the story's beginning on the Lower Eastside prior to World War I.
948;it also gives an insight to the history and birth of the crime syndicates that exist to this day.
949;This was one of the best movies i have ever seen.
950;It came in great condition.
951;I will definately recommend it to mt friends
952;Mind blowing scenes and actors are awesome.
953;Robert DeNiro is definitely pulled remarkable act of his life time!
954;As a unit they are loyal and formidable, but it is greed and ruthlessness that causes great treachery, yet the perfect plan to take all doesn't fool the most astute of the group.
955;It is the realization that David """"Noodles"""" Aaronson has been outplayed that provides for a surprising conclusion."""
956;This movie has been the most extraordinary cinematographic story and storytelling I have ever experienced.
957;flawless direction, script, acting, staging, magnificent soundtrack.
958;storytelling, camera, characters and acting, music, costumes and the works.
959;The story is good, as is the acting, characters and everything else I mentioned above.
960;I'm sure that even a Sergio Leone film is not great enough to survive such master butchery.
961;Once Upon A Time In America is director, Sergio Leone's stunning tale of organized crime and the destruction it unleashes into the lives of four life.
962;Robert DeNiro headlines a cast of great talent that includes Joe Pesci, Treat Williams and James Woods.
963;I am pleased to say that this new 2.
964;disc set at last gives us the story as it was originally intended, full of robust characterizations, enthralling action sequences and filled with the sort of memorable moments that have reminded me why we all go to the movies .
965;The break happens right in the middle of a crucial scene.
966;Many scenes offer remarkable clarity and depth while others, mostly night time or dark scenes suffer from a loss of fine detail that disappears into a haze of undistinguished muddy blacks, browns and blues.
967;Edge enhancement, pixelization, shimmering and aliasing are present throughout the transfer, sometimes distractingly so.
968;That's it, that's all!BOTTOM LINE: For its sheer mastery in the art of cinema story telling, I recommend Once Upon A Time In America .
969;The transfer leaves something to be desired but hey, it's nice to have this American classic back in the spotlight and, finally, in its full running time.
970;It is high time that American critics and fans alike start to debunk their unquestioned, sloppy veneration of films like Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America'.
971;establish her relationship with a post.
972;a make up department fumble or intentional one wonders).
973;Like all masterpieces, this film completely absorbs for its duration, and stays with you long after.
974;it is a film that says so much about dreams, friendship, memory, growing old, wasted lives, and is imbued with a sense of the infinite.
975;Whilst not overly misogynistic, it is definitely a male orientated film, with male friendship, real and imagined being the cornerstone of this tour de force.
976;It retains its brilliance throughout, the four hours flew by.
977;it's worth seeing for De Niro's brilliantly understated performance.
978;Plus, James Woods provides a perfect counterbalance to De Niro, with Woods at his hyperactive best.
979;But this time there is actually real depth to Woods' performance .
980;"Great story of growing up, love, loyalty, betrayal, and ""settling the score"", involving a group of childhood friends."
981;"I found it more real than ""The Godfather"", which I also liked."
982;one caveat: see the original, full.
983;I have seen many movies but have never been moved enough to actually write a review.
984;"Especially the nude scene of the ""good"" girl."
985;i have always had problems with the portrayal of a genuinely evil person as someone with a human heart.
986;He is no better than his friends and the audience should not have any feelings for him other than he deserved what he got.
987;Once Upon a Time in America, along with operatic Once Upon a Time in the West, are director Sergio Leone's underrated masterpieces.
988;Most importantly, Sergio Leone masterfully puts us into the minds of characters, enabling us to fully connect (particularly effective via his trademark Sergio Leone extreme close.
989;cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli, this is a marvelous film to look at, with many unforgettable shots.
990;The images pack a ton of details with deep shadow detail and periodic color palette.
991;Best of all, no edge enhancement.
992;just as underrated is Ennio Morricone's score, possibly his most haunting work ever.
993;Many film score composers cite Once Upon a Time in America as among the very best score ever written, and it is easy to hear why.
994;Like his score to Once Upon a Time in the West, this score features 3 distinctively unforgettable themes.
995;everything from the camera work, the sets, the costumes, the cars, and a special shoutout to Ennio Morricone who composed a brilliant music score, it just brings you back to that time period, and really fits the movie, of course he worked with Sergio Leone on The Man With No Name series, so they had a good connection.
996;Great story and great photography.
997;The cast is also is perfect.
998;It is my favorite movie of all times for the story.
999;It needs attention and to be viewed twice.
1000;I recommend it to the ones who really love cinema, it is a masterpiece!
1001;Sergio Leone's mafia film following the lives of two friends from the 1920s to modern times is, despite its convoluted screenplay, another great mob film combining the talents of many stars including Robert DeNiro and James Woods as the central characters.
1002;The story follows the commeraderie of the main characters as they evolve in their criminal lives with respect to each other and the world around them.
1003;The film concludes with the characters facing and judging each other after many years of being apart.
1004;the film is unique in that most mafia films cover Italian or Irish Catholic immigrants who resorted to organized crime to make their fortunes in the 20s and 30s.
1005;"This is particularly true with the ending in that Leone didn't seem to have any time left to present a powerful or conclusive ending
1006;despite flaws in plot continuity and consistency, the film is well acted with relatively good character studies.
1007;This is another great film that should be in every mob film lover's collection.
1008;i saw Robert de Niro playing and the amount of good reviews so I thought it will be a good one.
1009;Pretend to be a good mafia film.
1010;And he probably is in real life as well.
1011;As most of his films I have seen by him have the above elements, similar or playing the jerk.
1012;You will thank me for this review.
1013;This is my favorite movie of all time!
1014;One minute he's the voice of reason, next minute he is raping a girl he loved since childhood.
1015;I would put all of those head and shoulders above this movie.
1016;Ok this movie takes you on a journey.
1017;This story, through art design, wardrobe, and set design, captures the era of Prohibition beautifully as a narrative with interesting and complex characters unfolds.
1018;A terrific cast including Robert Di Nero, Elizabeth McGovern, and James Woods, A long film but well worth the time.
1019;Once Upon A Time In America is not only a perfect gangster film but it is one of the greatest films of all time!
1020;A truly brilliant end to Leone's career.
1021;The Blu Ray does justice to this movie I've seen more times than I can remember.
1022;Once Upon a Time in America ranks in the top three of my list of favorite movies period.
1023;The time will fly because you want to know more.
1024;'cause I promise ya, I'll do it!!!
1025;It is told in an interesting fashion.
1026;Once upon a time is one of the greatest films ever!
1027;A mesmerizing film, gets better with age, like a fine wine.
1028;it is long because the characters and their scenes are given time to really develop.
1029;It truly is an absorbing and well made movie.
1030;All of the characters are unforgettable.
1031;Always love action movies that have classiness in them!
1032;Good movie to watch for those who like mob movies.
1033;See the 4 houres lenght version (the original one, not the one cut by the american producer) and you'll experience what I believe to be the greatest movie ever made, a nostalgic hymn to youth.
1034;love and ultimately to life and cinema itself.
1035;By the way its soundtrack is a masterpiece as well (by the great Morricone).
1036;Sergio Leone's last film, Once Upon A Time In America is a close to four hour film that tells the story of Jewish gangsters over the course of forty years.
1037;The most interesting part of the film is the section where Mr. Leone explores the origins of Noodles and Max's relationship.
1038;Showing the two gangsters as young hoods on the lower East Side of Manhattan is an excellent piece of cinema and the actors, Scott Tiler and Rusty Jacobs, who play the young Noodles and young Max respectively are quite good especially Mr. Tiler.
1039;Elizabeth McGovern plays the adult Deborah and one of the film's most intense scenes involves Noodles raping Deborah in the back of a car after a romantic and elegant dinner at the beach.
1040;Mr. Woods, on the other hand, is explosive and gives one of his best performances.
1041;well, okay, so let's start over.
1042;Leone ties the two together with some of the best editing techniques on film, and thus we get a deep enough story that's still easy to follow.
1043;The same basic structure is there, and let us focus a moment on the """"America"""" part of the title."""
1044;all of this is illustrated and structured around nice long zooming shots inward towards an actors face as he or she.
1045;The characters are believable of course, but that's because we've been raised on a diet of them.
1046;What, besides the idea of the American Dream as it relates to the criminal world, keeps compelling us to sit for nearly four hours to watch Al or Robert slap hysterical women around, cavort with dangerous friends, and face down killers with a subtle scowl that suggests pure control and power over the situation?
1047;The story is deeper than the godfather and just as good.
1048;Onewhich is really two films in one.
1049;The first film tells the story of a gang of New York street kids (Jewish), in turn of the century New York.
1050;Also captured wonderfully is the character of this time.
1051;Cop or crook, everyone is displayed in very bright light, and most people apprear as small as they are in real life.
1052;A wonderful scene in this part of the movie, is of one of the young gang (maybe 13) waiting outside of an apartment to get a crack at a prostitute in training (a young woman).
1053;This sensual scene captures the beauty of youth, even in very sordid sorroundings.
1054;ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA is a true story in that it's tail of crime, politics, corrpution and friendship rings very true.
1055;Sergio Leone is known for the beautiful haunting music in his movies and he doesn't fail here.
1056;The transfer is terrific as is the 5.1 sound mix which emphasizes Ennio Morricone's wonderous score.
1057;The extras are a nice bonus spread out over two discs (as is the film) with a special look at the films of Sergio Leone.
1058;Grand cinematic storytelling by a master craftsman.
1059;Fine acting, fine direction, musical score by the maestro.
1060;This is a very long movie but it is a great classic.
1061;It is also one of my favorite Dinero movies.
1062;This is a excellent movie starring Robert De Niro.
1063;I love good mob movies, but his was a sorry one.
1064;The Godfather may have been a more critical and commercial success, but Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America is mesmerizing.
1065;Leone's trademark use of dialog less scenes allows the actors' facial expressions coupled with the background music and sounds to convey meaning without words.
1066;what distinguishes this film is its effective use of the female leads.
1067;Both Elizabeth McGovern and Tuesday Weld are outstanding in their respective parts as the women who come in intimate contact with DeNiro and Woods.
1068;McGovern, also taken advantage by DeNiro's Noodles, is exquisitely beautiful and plays her part sympathetically and passionately.
1069;the young actors portraying the stars' younger selves are superb.
1070;New York City locations, costuming, and period detail are flawless as the film spans four decades.
1071;european filmmakers, like Leone and Forman, seem to have a truly unique way of looking at America that is satisfying and respectful.
1072;I have watched this film over and over and I have enjoyed it every time.
1073;It evokes many emotions, both joyful and dark.
1074;The epic nature of this film is enhanced by the magnificent flashbacks.
1075;I enjoyed this film when I viewed it on a non cable channel and enjoyed it.
1076;I am a huge fan of Robert De Niro I own The Godfather Part II, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, The Deer Hunter, GoodFellas, Casino, Analyze This, Analyze hat and Midnight Run.
1077;But what a magnificent movie this is for three and a half hours!
1078;Viewers with a longer attention span will be delighted with the film's careful evocation of life in the lower east side of NY ca. 1910.1930 and with Morricone's typically beautiful score.
1079;The acting is superb throughout, and several sequences (such as the baby.
1080;I ordered the two disc special edition and that arrived.
1081;I am very happy with the one I got.
1082;Nice performances, but just seemed too dated.
1083;stopping action all the way through very good show
1084;The best gangaster film ever, perhaps one of the best films in the history.
1085;Was ranked by the critics as one of the best films of the 80's, overlooked in the oscars, but when the real release of the film was displayed everyone asserted in saying that this is a masterpiece.
1086;It is one of my favorite films withsome of the greatest actors and actresses of all time.
1087;Sure, there were good things about it, like the scenes with the kids as they formed their gang and the young love story.
1088;edited version might be the masterpiece that Leone had intended.
1089;it starts out funny, but just goes on and on, like McGovern removing all of her makeup.
1090;there are very many things that reviewers claimed the new version accomplishes.
1091;Indeed, the part that I liked best was the childhood flashbacks.
1092;Probably the best gangster movie ever made .
1093;Robert DeNiro and James Woods are both wonderful as are the other actors.
1094;It has an excellent (although admittedly very slow moving) plot and has a real mystery to it (unlike the Godfather movies where the only mysteries are when and who is going to get shot).
1095;It also has a haunting musical score.
1096;"This is the ONLY so called gangster film that is not just a fast moving thriller, where the killings seem just entertainment
1097;Sergio Leone's splendid 229 minute restored director's cut of ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, one of the most sought.
1098;It broke Leone's heart: his fairy tale had been decimated.
1099;Brutal and beautiful, Leone's saga of Jewish gangsters covers nearly 50 years (1920 to 1968) in the strange partnership of Lower East Side childhood thugs Noodles (Robert De Niro) and Max (James Woods).
1100;existent"
1101;the feeling of a lucid dream of America fueled by Ennio Morricone's exquisite score and the hallucinatory images of 1920s New York.
1102;An epic tale of jewish kids in turn of the century new york who begin a life of petty crime that blossums into large scale organized crime.
1103;In one important scene noodles rapes his childhood sweetheart the woman he claims to love.
1104;Noodles and his best pal max take a pretty good beating for their intrusion but they continue to work the area and the reprisals become much stronger.
1105;Will noodles help his friends or will he double cross them to save his own skin.
1106;There are a few more twists and turns and some real surprises.
1107;this is a fine film with solid writing, acting and a realistic ambience.
1108;You do feel part of the life and times of the characters.
1109;The story line is solid though the flashback method can make it frustrating at times to follow.
1110;For that reason this is a good movie to own so you can see it several times in which you'll appreciate it more.
1111;Noodles in the mausoleum, noodles with his childhood sweetheart in the restaurant ect.
1112;still a very fine film and one of the best from the 1980s.
1113;Always a favorite movie .
1114;ive seen this movie many times in the last 28 years and i always considered it one of the best movies of all time.
1115;I rated this movie 5 stars, the story was well told with a superb cast of characters.
1116;I've wanted this movie to add to my collection for a long time and now I have it.
1117;I remember taping it a few years back but I never got around to watching it.
1118;I had never really heard anything about it even though I was a huge Robert DeNiro fan and I liked gangster movies.
1119;DeNiro and the other actors are first rate.
1120;The actors playing the young hoods are also very good.
1121;I found myself wanting to fast forward through certain parts of the movie.
1122;The movie moves around a lot but is easy to follow.
1123;Even a fan of the genre it's worth it.
1124;Others I advise to steer clear.
1125;Once Upon a Time in America is a good film, not a great one.
1126;it is terrible and I highly recommend NOT watching it.
1127;Be smart and watch The Godfather instead!
1128;One of the greatest films.
1129;The musical score makes up for it, along with costume and storyline.
1130;A great saga of two pals/competitors spread across many years during periods of great change.
1131;At times a little confusing but the acting is excellent with James Wood in a standout performance.
1132;The wife and I both enjoyed the movie though it was hard to follow at times.
1133;I'm still wondering if I interpreted the ending correctly, but that's what makes a good movie.
1134;"this movie has it all
1135;Once upon a time in america portrays 50 years of riveting underworld history and offers rich roles to a remarkable cast.
1136;Robert De Niro and James Woods central characters at their best.
1137;To see this film is to be swept away by the assurance and vitality of a great director Sergio Leone.
1138;If you enjoy gangster movies this is a great collectors item.
1139;macho world they inhabit both creates and scorns.
1140;hero films, for having the courage to explore such a taboo subject.
1141;ennio Morriccone's majestic orchestral score (especially the strings and pan flute) is hauntingly delicious in this gangster epic and is in itself an important character.
1142;I love Italian film music and this score is one of the most touching I have heard.
1143;There is good use of the Beatles's Yesterday as Noodles waxes nostalgic.
1144;There is pleasing cineamatography as its shot in NY, Toronto, Rome, Venice and Paris.
1145;I especially liked the transition shots like when the frisbee flies.
1146;Leone's epic seems to stand still in time while he stirs his coffee for what seems like an eternity while the others anxiously watch to see what he will do next.
1147;the young actors playing the young gang in the 30's did a great job, especially Scott Tiler, who played young Noodles exploring first love.
1148;Noodles' youthful character is more energetic and expressive than DeNiro's who gives an understated, controlled low emotional performance of quiet strength.
1149;this ambitious film raises more questions than it answers.
1150;What about De Niro's mysterious stained smile at the end?
1151;There is a lot of detail in the recreation of 1930's NY and UOATIA will take you on a journey through time and one man's memories.
1152;so many great action scenes and dialogue from the the two GODFATHER movies.
1153;everyone brought their best for this American classic!
1154;A movie that I've seen again and again.
1155;best gangster movie in my opinion.
1156;music (soundtrack) is also worth getting.
1157;If you enjoy gangster movies and aren't disturbed by nudity, this movie is for you!
1158;It's a thrill ride with lots of twists and turns.
1159;It's incredible on so many levels.
1160;It's fantastic as a gangster story, and all the intertwining narratives are incredible.
1161;format and it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1162;The time spent on character development makes it all worth while.
1163;James Woods is in his finest form of any movie I have ever seen him in, including Salvador, and that is saying something.
1164;DeNiro is even better, and his part proves why he is considered one of the best actors of the past 30+ years.
1165;Then there are all of the supporting actors, who were amazing as well.
1166;The fact that this movie didn't win a Best Picture Oscar is one of the great travesties of cinematic justice.
1167;Its got a good story about a group of friends that grow up to be some of the most powerful bootleggers with alot of subplots like the love story between noodles and i think her name is debra anyway, the story is good a complicated.
1168;Performance wise there really isn't any likable characters, but its supposed to be that way, we are talking mobsters here, but the all do a good job of potraying their chracters.
1169;Overall its a damn good movie that i give a 9 out of a 10.
1170;joe pesci is awesome in it and it one of the best mob movies ever.
1171;I love, love, love this film and cannot watch it enough.
1172;The cinmatography is so brilliant with its sepia.
1173;And that music is beautiful and haunting.
1174;Tuesday Weld is wonderful and she has been used too litle on film and is a great actress.
1175;what makes this film so brilliant is the way the Italian filmakers capture the Jewish lower East Side so perfectly (to me, at least).
1176;and if you can, catch it on a big screen in a repertory theater.
1177;but the ending is truly amazing.
1178;There are two cuts of this film.
1179;Robert DiNero shows off his considerable talent with an outstanding supporting cast.
1180;OUATIA is an epic film in every sense.
1181;the cast are superb with DeNiro and James Woods as Max (at his most charismatic) playing the two leading roles roles.
1182;Its beautifully shot and a wonderful looking film.
1183;But this is a very minor critcism of what is otherwise a superb film.
1184;This is an interesting movie with good acting and directing.
1185;I do really love the fruit I am sent as a Christmas gift each year from a sibling I love and cherish.
1186;I like movies and this sibling has scarce time to relax with work and family and transporting and groceries and laundry and.
1187;please relax"
1188;It's a tale of two movies.
1189;If you do watch this, make sure it's the 227 minute version.
1190;The movie sells because Robert De Niro is in it otherwise to eat his own with this one!!
1191;I would much rather watch Bugsey Malone (the musical) it's more true to life.
1192;This film, along with Once Upon a Time in the West are the pinnacle of Sergio Leone's carrier .
1193;a brilliant director and film maker.
1194;For anyone interested in the art of film, this is a must.
1195;"see
1196;This is a classic film.
1197;I got it at a good price and it was delivered on time and in new condition.
1198;This is the ultimate American Dream film.
1199;Leone creates a New York that almost smells real and the actors round out some fantastic set pieces.
1200;De Niro is superb as Noodles an ageing Jewish hoodlum who returns to his old haunts after receiving a mysterious letter.
1201;James Woods is superb as Max in this fantastic movie.
1202;The theme tune is haunting pan pipe style music that stays with you long after the images have disappeared.
1203;but the beauty is on screen.
1204;Sergio Leone's """"Once Upon a Time in America"""" marked the triumphant return of the famed director to the big screen after an extended absence."""
1205;"david ""Noodles"" Aaronson (Robert De Niro) receives a mysterious job offer and returns to New York after a thirty.year absence."
1206;Noodles reminisces about the good times he had with his old gang of friends and the woman he loved since his youth, the fetching Deborah Gelly (Jennifer Connelly/Elizabeth McGovern).
1207;He also reflects upon the criminal endeavors he engaged in and wonders whether the sins of his past have finally caught up with him.
1208;"there is much to admire about ""Once Upon A Time in America."""
1209;The production design accurately recreates industrialized America at the turn of the twentieth century.
1210;rate with the adult cast turning in passionate and savage performances and the youthful ensemble doing astounding work in the flashback sequences.
1211;Also, the Ennio Morricone is as lush and memorable as his earlier masterpieces.
1212;edited original American theatrical version.
1213;It also showed very clearly the addiction of power and the need to take more, and more, risks to maintain and satisfy that addiction
1214;"Sergio Leone's last major movie is most likely his masterpiece, even if ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" will remain his best."
1215;"Much like that Clint Eastwood movie, ""Once upon a Time in America"" has a director's edition that is bloated, epic and far more than it advertises."
1216;"Once Upon A Time is a gangster movie in the same way that ""The Good"" is a cowboy flick ."
1217;they both carry these genres at their hearts, but each is really more of a period piece.
1218;what follows is perhaps one of the greatest gangster movies of all time, despite the fact that it is cut with some tedious exposition and static self.
1219;When it works, the film is brilliant.
1220;"If you've got four hours to spend watching a man's life, ""Once Upon A Time"" is an amazing film."
1221;My husband really wanted this and has enjoyed it immensely.
1222;Provides good mental picture of cultural and ethnic diversity and clashes .
1223;was it really like this?Movie Making: Great script, scenes, direction (really good, homogenous flow), brought out the actors' best efforts.
1224;acting: Very good by almost everyone, even the bit players.
1225;overall: Exellent example of the best in movie.
1226;ive seen this movie before and thought i have to have this!
1227;this is a great movie and i dont regret it, i could watch this over and over again!!!!
1228;great plot, interesting ambiguity of morality and what really happens, plenty of seeing (as opposed to telling) but in the end I wish the vision was condensed.
1229;This is an Epic on Film!
1230;The film gives you a great look at a couple of young street punks who band together and go on to create a crime syndicate.
1231;"i also recommend ""Miller's Crossing"", ""Good Fellas"", ""Casino"", and ""Scarface""."
1232;This film and the soundtrack that graces it are absolutely essential pieces for anyone's collection.
1233;Everything is right except the sound.
1234;a meditation on time, memory, and the nature of cinema itself.
1235;I hope and pray this is true.
1236;Christopher Frayling's excellent biography of Leone outlines the missing footage .
1237;"hopefully this footage will remedy that and turn ""Once Upon A Time In America"" into the masterpiece it undoubtedly is."
1238;"were in any way instrumental in the eventual restoration and release of Sergio Leones' masterful adaptation of ""Once Upon a Time in America"" to it's original making ."
1239;just as he'd envisioned, and just as he'd seen was the very best way in which to convey the entire and somewhat complicated narrative of the lives of five boys caught in a web of survival during the early prohibition years through it's repeal .
1240;thanks to Mr. Leone's taking full creative license with his film moving effortlessly from the past to the present to the somewhat ambiguous future .
1241;(Oh, and I write this now from the perspective of having viewed the film two days past, as I've found myself rather obsessed with it and thinking on it so often I felt the best thing to do was to put my feelings down in writing .
1242;the most incredibly human story.
1243;And also international as it reminds us that not only Italians run Mafias .
1244;The movie has a master piece score that has been reviewed successfully all over.
1245;The movie has elements of love, corresponded and not, of profound criminal but also sexual violence.
1246;Both are essential to the story and thus not gratuitous.
1247;De Niro let us know, again, that he is a masterful actor, as is Elizabeth Montgomery in he unique and outstanding type of beauty.
1248;A very cool look at Jewish gangsters of the 20s and 30s.
1249;Great sets and views of early 20th C NYC.
1250;It has genius scenes in it.
1251;Sergio Leone is one of the most famous and popular film directors of our time.
1252;It is the epic tale of their 50 years together, going from poverty to the good life and back.
1253;It is a stunning, unique look at the underworld and how even the best of friendships can die with the push of a button (not literally.)
1254;sergio Leone's directing is perfect.
1255;Ennio Morricone's music is great and well.
1256;The script is long, but holds up well throughout the time.
1257;The acting is also great, with top.
1258;notch performances from Woods and De Niro.
1259;Leone, previously with a reputation solely for directing westerns (almost all of which became classics) clearly has an excellent take on the gangster genre, and this comes out as his best with THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY.
1260;Believe me, it's worth it.
1261;After two decades of silly and heartbreaking truncated editions, this is the cut that finally makes sense out of a towering cinematic achievement.
1262;It's so mesmerizing and poetic that it's hard to believe that it remains a relatively forgotten film.
1263;I'll watch it again in a month or two.
1264;Good actors and a okay plot .
1265;Once Upon a Time in Americais a timeless movie that I enjoyed watching.
1266;It brought back many memories.
1267;The acting and story line were outstanding.
1268;Awfully long, but the actors alone would make it a worthwhile movie.
1269;best film of the 80's about Jewish gangsters with out the romanticized style of the Godfather this movie is like the 80's version of good fellas raw and to the point.
1270;The flashback itself is engrossing and endearing.
1271;If you love movies, if you love great acting, if you love history, this is the epic for you.
1272;In a genius move, director Sergio Leone portrays how crime influences this tough, beautiful, but delicate friendship.
1273;They must also have a short attention span, for the portrayel of the four main characters' childhood is at times beautiful, elegiac and hilarious.
1274;"It tells a timeless tale of the central character in the film, Noodles (later played by Robert DeNiro), and his obsession with the local beauty (a young Jennifer Conally, later played by Elizabeth McGovern) who refuses to love him because he'll ""always be a two."
1275;And it ends in one of the film's most emotional moments that proves you must have a strong stomach to really pay attention and/or appreciate the film to full extent.
1276;this carries over into the rest of the film, dotted with modern day looks at Noodles and his three friends who are dead at the beginning of the film.
1277;After his mental journey through the past, he searches in real life for the love of his life, played by Elizabeth McGovern.
1278;What ensues is a twist, one of the best in cinematic history (that I've seen, anyway).
1279;what is masterful about all of these storylines, flashbacks and flashforwards is the extent of their depth.
1280;Leone accompanies each detail with an unforgettable emotional truth that extends deep into each character's (and our own) psyche.
1281;apart from the amazing depth in character and story, the production values are top notch, with glorious sets, cinematography and editing.
1282;It all works together so well on so many levels.
1283;so to those who have strong stomachs (there are bouts of intense violence) and those who are not too young (this is definitely not a family film, as it portrays some graphic sexuality) and also those who are in love with cinema, I recommend 'Once Upon a Time in America.'
1284;Oh, and make sure you have a good attention span.
1285;deNiro's performance as Noodles the Jewish gangster at the heart of the film.
1286;The explosion performances and violent confrontations make America an often compelling film.
1287;The commentary by film historian/critic Richard Schickel and the brief documentary on the making of the film provide added background on this important minor classic.
1288;I watched the movie twice in a whole day.
1289;It's so beautiful of its music and scene painting.
1290;First time i watched this film, i enjoyed everything about it, although at first a little confusing with the time changing aspect on viewing it a few times i was able to follow the storyline with more understanding, along with Ennio Morricone's fantastic panpipe's and musical score.
1291;One of the best movies I've ever seen, so well done.
1292;A gem of a movie.
1293;A great film with great actors from a wizard director.
1294;Later, it was screened at the Venice Film Festival with an equal success.
1295;The music of Ennio Morricone is stunning and award.
1296;winning as is the cinematography.
1297;a true masterpiece, in my opinion!
1298;Once upon a time in 1984 the director Sergio Leone made his version of a gangster film which in my opinion greatly contrasts the works of cinematic extrimists like Copolla and Scorcese.
1299;OUTIA is a film that also has violence, sex, gore, but above all it has emotion and a fairy.
1300;like realism which balances all these elements.
1301;In fact this movie is like a fairy.
1302;tale and yet it is real.
1303;In my opinion both versions of this movie are great.
1304;Only a handful movies moved me to tears (ages of innocence, breaking the waves, dancer in the dark, to name a few).
1305;Thermatically, this is the strongest movie that I have ever watched, and it surpassed the best that Tarkovsky, Bergman, Kurosawa, Scorsese, Visconti have ever offered.
1306;also, did I mention the spectacular score Morricone composed for this movie?
1307;"Heck, these scores are better than anything that the great John Williams has ever composed, maybe with the exception of the main theme from ""ET"" and ""Schindler's List""."
1308;even as i write this i have to fight back tears of joy!This is unequivicaly the best movie I have ever seen.
1309;i anxiously await the oncoming defining moment of my life thus far when on june 10th 2003 I slip this disc gently into place and sit in quiet awe as what is sure to be a luminous image transfer, and crystal clear sound, of this confident, narratively and photographicaly superior work of art filters through my being.
1310;graphic in the extent of its emotional truth, momentus beyond all hope of descrition, this masterpiece is the pinnacle of filmic technique as a source of artistic storytelling.
1311;unconciously grand in every respect.
1312;every performance is pitched in the sheer depth of complete confidence as is every other piece of this puzzle.
1313;watch some parts so you can put it together in your head, but that is what makes it cool.
