I:430;1;l'Appartement is a terrific film, one of the best French films in the last two decades.
I:430;2;it's great to finally have this available in the US.
I:430;3;It's great to have separate subs for the hard of hearing IF they have regular subs for those who aren't hard of hearing.
I:430;4;"lingal Monica Bellucci a star
I:430;5;To see she and Cassel together at the starts of their now famous careers is a treat.
I:430;6;Muriel is, by the way, Max's CEO's sister.
I:430;7;Writer/Director Gilles Mimouni (Wicker Park) employs a really neat trick of showing you an event from a character's point.
I:430;8;time showing has new meaning and gives you an 'ah ha!'
I:430;9;It's very carefully constructed and artful stuff.
I:430;10;"It was a postmodern quest in that I was obsessed over a film about obsession with a capital ""O."" For those who don't yet know, Vincent is the son of the late great French actor Jean."
I:430;11;Then I remembered how watchable Unfaithful was and turned anxious.
I:430;12;The answer was emotional depth and existential intensity.
I:430;13;That both Bellucci and Kruger play a woman named Lisa is just one nod to cinematic master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock although only one of the ladies (Kruger) is a blonde.
I:430;14;"The protagonists' brooding temperaments contrast with euphoria
I:430;15;all of which are part of both films' intricate puzzles that will draw you into the intersection of memory and obsession.
I:430;16;have I been so riveted by such an obsessed protagonist as Cassel's Max.
I:430;17;find ourselves getting more and more absorbed in Max's stream of consciousness and rooting for his love quest with each compelling frame.
I:430;18;suffice it to say: Mimouni's L'Appartement is a brilliant film and, unlike Wicker Park, is not for the faint of heart.
I:430;19;In my opinion, L'Appartement was fantastic!
I:430;20;watch the movie to catch the subtle statements from the jeweler, to the obvious moments of obsession by all characters.
I:430;21;Overall, the movie was great.
I:430;22;"L'Appartment is truly a French movie worth watching and one of those films that should never have been remade made into an ""English"" equivalent."
I:430;23;the acting from the principle characters are superb (Bohringer, Cassel, and Bellucci).
I:430;24;I will agree with the others of the Hitchcock.
I:430;25;crossed lovers whose attempts to reunite after an unintential two year separation are constantly thwarted by fate and the devious actions of a third party determined to keep them apart.
I:430;26;critique: Released in '96, `The Apartment' receives the highest marks on every level.
I:430;27;The cinematography is superb, artistically capturing the urban, Parisian terrain which seems to ooze from the screen.
I:430;28;The camera skillfully captures the spirit of this legendary city and the atmosphere of the landscape incorporating that romantic ambience into the separated lovers Max and Lisa.
I:430;29;The soundtrack is melodic, melancholy and apprehensive, a perfect fit for the taut, expertly constructed plot unfolding layer by complex layer on the screen before the viewer.
I:430;30;`The Apartment' is first class entertainment from beginning to end and believe me when the end finally arrives you'll be taken totally by surprise just as I was.
I:430;31;This is a classic that definitely can be watched again and again.
I:430;32;One facet of this movie that no one mentions but it really is a factor is that two of the actors on the screen are perhaps the sexiest, most magnetic and charismatic stars movie goers have seen in awhile.
I:430;33;So perhaps the film was helped by this real life sizzling and chemistry.
I:430;34;He does spot her one day and follows her to her apartment.
I:430;35;This is a very nuanced, layered film.
I:430;36;Cassel is definitely the lead because the camera is always on him and he is the one who is searching.
I:430;37;This film is like that one in style, elan and suspense.
I:430;38;The problem with watching Alfred Hitchcock's films is that they leave you wanting to see another and another, to savour his unique and playful blend of romance, tension and intrigue.
I:430;39;"l'appartement is the closest to being a ""new"" Hitchcock film that I've ever come across."
I:430;40;The director, Gilles Mimouni, makes the connection to Hitchcock clear from the beginning with a lush, romantic soundtrack (courtesy of Peter Chase) that immediately recalls Vertigo.
I:430;41;Also like Hitch, Mimouni uses sweeping camerawork and a rich colour palette to heighten the eccentric nature of his story.
I:430;42;Max has just become engaged and is due to fly to Tokyo for an important business trip, but he decides to put everything on hold to track down Lisa.
I:430;43;Naturally, not everything is as it appears and the story, filled with flashbacks and unexpected plot twists, becomes a romantic mystery and a thriller.
I:430;44;Half the fun and purpose of Hitchcock's films is to see what happens to ordinary people when they're caught in an extraordinary series of events.
I:430;45;And even Paris, which doesn't need much help to look mysterious and romantic, is made to look lusher and more delectable than the real thing.
I:430;46;watch it to understand how it all fits together.
I:430;47;Call this one Hitchcock's last great film.You can read more of my reviews at JettisonCocoon dot com.
I:430;48;Daniel brings up the rear obsessing about Lisa.
I:430;49;Lucien, Max's best friend, dates Alice but does not obsess.
I:430;50;Let's just say it has been done much more artfully in other movies.
I:430;51;"Her talent, as showcased in ""Malena,"" is well hidden here."
I:430;52;It seems that De Palma has spent his whole career trying to imitate Hitchcock and he does a much better job than Mimouni.
I:430;53;The musical score is basic De Palma.
I:430;54;It also has a gorgeous film score.
I:430;55;The fact that Max would have any attraction for Alice after he finds out what she has done is a prime example of art not imitating life at all.
I:430;56;The Apartment is a well.
I:430;57;In fact, it takes the characters quite a while to figure out their true relationships.
I:430;58;The end result is an entertaining movie that rewards the careful viewer and provides multiple puzzles to be solved.
I:430;59;The actresses with the two female lead roles both give memorable performances.
I:430;60;Monica Bellucci is absolutely gorgeous with her alluring eyes and smartly.
I:430;61;In perhaps a bit of typecasting, Bellucci portrays a woman so beautiful that one of the male leads, expertly played by handsome Vincent Cassel, cannot get her out of his mind years later, even in the presence of his fiancee.
I:430;62;"Her character is at times passive, at times plotting and aggressive
I:430;63;It's quite a role, and Bohringer does a great job with it.
I:430;64;there may be a message that The Apartment is conveying: given the ease and speed with which present.
I:430;65;day romances progress to the intimate stage, adults who play the field are presented with many options, and it can be hard to choose among them to find true love.
I:430;66;And true love may be nothing more than an unhealthy obsession.
I:430;67;But the primary attractions of The Apartment are the intricate plot and the fine job turned in by the lead actors, with some beautiful scenes of Paris exteriors and interiors thrown in for a bonus.
I:430;68;The Apartment is worth seeing not once but twice, to capture everything that is going on and to learn how it all fits together.
I:430;69;The movie arrived on time and packaged well.
I:430;70;A bit of a modern classic in some ways, I highly recommend this film if you haven't seen it.
I:430;71;The English version makes way more sense than French version which makesLittle sense!
I:430;72;This is a stunning romance thriller.
I:430;73;The music and camera work is excellent as you follow the characters throughout and the story keeps you thinking.
I:430;74;gradually revealing complex and interesting layers of the story.
I:430;75;making the viewer think a person is somewhere, when in fact, they're somewhere else.
I:430;76;For some, it'll be fun.
I:430;77;for a few reasons, I recommend seeing THE APARTMENT (L'APPARTEMENT) first.
I:430;78;(4) Vincent Cassel is more energetic and open as this nervous, love.
I:430;79;looking and she gives a very good performance.
I:430;80;In the American version, the role is played by the lovely Australian actress Rose Byrne made to look mousey.
I:430;81;frankly, I prefer the film version with Rose Byrne.
I:430;82;hearing) as the only option.
I:430;83;I'll just be doing what I should have done in the first place and picking up the French disc.
I:430;84;watch it, over and over and over and you will fall in love too.
I:430;85;these are two of the best and sexiest european actors of this generation.
I:430;86;The previous reviewer (Lim) did a great job of summarizing without giving anything away.
I:430;87;This movie was a classic french love story .
I:430;88;The soul of the movie is best explained by Alice, as she is confronted by Max of her duplicity .
I:430;89;We see idealized love (Max and Lisa), we see obsessive love (almost all of the characters at one point), we see pragmatic love (Max and Muriel and Lisa for Daniel), etc.
I:430;90;All types of love are displayed and the ending is most fitting for each character.
I:430;91;I believe that Alice's character was the most intriguing as she starts obsessive and grows into true love.
I:430;92;monica Bellucci and her husband, Vincent Cassel convincingly play lovers, but Romane Bohringer actually eclipses Bellucci on the sexy quotient, at least in this one.
I:430;93;I liked Wicker Park but this movie is definitely better.
I:430;94;This is a movie I can enjoy watching every couple of years so I'm glad I bought it.
I:430;95;Neither is all that great, but I liked The Apartment better because it has more nudity, specifically more of Romane Bohringer.
I:430;96;The very beautiful Monica Bellucci is also nude, but we don't get to see anything.
I:430;97;to true lovers of this film, get a multi.
I:430;98;The tension of the film is created by a lot of unrequited passions as the characters sort of chase one another around attempting to make a connection of one kind or another.
I:430;99;There are some clever Tarantino.
I:430;100;Bellucci is lovely, as always, though this is not one of her steamier roles (no nudity) .
I:430;101;a refreshing change from Hollywood cliches .
I:430;102;an engrossing and entertaining watch.
I:430;103;where the true absurdity of the fact that everyone in it save Max Mayer (em>Sheitan/em>'s Vincent Cassel, excellent as always), our main character, is lying through his or her teeth is exposed.
I:430;104;it's a damn good movie (though it is not without, as we'll discuss later, a few structural flaws), and is especially notable nowadays as an early role for both Cassel and Monica Bellucci (they met on the set and married in 1999), who plays Max's ex.
I:430;105;"The fact that they felt the need to rename the film should tell you most of what you need to know
I:430;106;vacuous Josh Hartnett was an acceptable replacement for Vincent Cassel should tell you the rest.
I:430;107;You've heard me batter on about stupid Hollywood remakes that didn't need made before, I'll spare you here.
I:430;108;All four of the principals are fine (and look for the great character actor Vincent Nemeth, best known on this side of the pond for em>The Transporter/em>, in a small role), the script is great when it brings its A game, and cinematographer Thierry Arbogast (em>Leon: The Professional/em>) is great at putting the camera in the perfect place to maximize tension.
I:430;109;Good stuff, recommended despite its flaws.
I:430;110;But then, a third into the picture it takes a sudden left turn and what had been a relatively simple romantic drama about lost love suddenly became a much more complex piece of work touching on the nature of desire and the way accidents of timing and interpretation can change fate.
