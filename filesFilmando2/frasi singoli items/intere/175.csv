1;It's a masterpiece of it's era, but don't let that put you off!
2;It's hard not to love this film It's colorful, playful, experimental, poetic and adventurous.
3;It's fun to watch this troubled couple on the run reciting poetry and treating life as if it was a great series of adventures that could be tossed to the wind at any moment.
4;Yet at times, there is genuine care and emotion between goddard's 2 most charismatic actors.
5;"I want to echo a sentiment expressed in an earlier review,"" Godard's films are known for their memorable scenes,"" (G. Merritt) more so than their memorable stories."
6;this is what explains his intense appeal to filmmakers as well as his modest appeal to the general filmgoer.
7;As a filmmaker Godard makes you see the possibilities of the cinema by breaking nearly every rule thought indispensable to the cinema.
8;In fact, those of us who love his work are actually in love with particular scenes or moments in his films that strike a deeply personal, profoundly intellectual or unrestrained comic cord within us.
9;pierrot Le Fou is a bizarre, exciting and comical film from Godard.
10;The pleasure of this film is found in the fact that you have absolutely no idea what Pierrot the character or Godard the filmmaker is going to do next.
11;"My favorite scene in this film is the ""C'est Moi, Marrianne"" sequence that alternates between silence, voice over, Duchamel's brillantly emotional score and Raoul Coutard's incredibly hypnotic tracking shots that all combine to create one of the most spectacular escape scenes in all of the French New Wave films."
12;For filmmakers it has a cameo of the great American director, Samuel Fuller who is in France attempting to raise money to do a film.
13;luc Godard is considered by some as among his masterpieces.
14;Easily (and I mean that in the boldest of senses) one of my favorite films of all time, `Pierrot le Fou' is cinematic perfection personified.
15;From the lush sets to the engaged performances to the witty banter to the sharply edited sequences to the ravishingly spectacular script, `Pierrot le Fou' is, in a word, perfect.
16;the very thought of this movie makes me want to drop to my hands and knees and perform an act of worship.
17;i have and always will be an advocate for French cinema, especially the 60's new wave campaigned by the likes of Francois Truffaut and my personal favorite film director (of all time) Jean.
18;`Pierrot le Fou' capitalizes on everything I find so enthralling about French new wave.
19;There is the obvious weighty themes but they are presented in an enchantingly jovial tone that keeps the audience entertained, even in the throes of crisis.
20;The colorful sets only serve as slick compliments to the films grounded performances (Jean.
21;paul Belmondo and Anna Karina were never better) and the films sharp editing helps embellish the complexities of the films plot.
22;while one can easily point to the films sporadic delivery and ascertain that it is merely an `art' film, one would be wrong in simply dismissing it for its entertainment value alone.
23;The film, for me, captures elements from all sides of the cinematic spectrum.
24;The film is undeniably entertaining, which is not something many `art' films can attest to being.
25;Most people label `art' films as boring and needlessly complex (I'm not talking about myself here) but this film, which is most certainly an `art' film, is far from either.
26;There is a rich poignancy here that transcends the films release date, and there is an enigmatic atmosphere that only helps elevate the films importance.
27;it is fresh, it is exciting, it is dangerous, it is meaningful, and it is loud, abrasive and epic in every sense of the word.
28;"It is cinema
I:12165;29;Even """"Last Year at Marienbad"""" is about something, or many things (or """"nothing,"""" you choose), and it does the job quite well."""
30;(Funny, all the talk about what THAT movie means.
31;check out the original trailer at Criterion's website and you'll see it was marketed as a cinematic version of Mad Libs.)
32;"Lots of folks don't ""get"" that movie either, but it's a heck of a lot of fun to watch."
33;But a friend once offered this test for a movie's worth: In the middle of movie, do you care about any of the characters or what happens to them?
34;to me, it captures some of the essence of the 60's .
35;Its amazing how certain people considers themselves know.
36;The print and sound is so perfect, you'd think Criterion did it.
37;bones production effort of a movie that deserves the red.
38;"the film is his most ambitious film yet, not only reuniting with two stars that he has worked with before but the fact that elements of his previous nine films shows up on ""Pierrot Le Fou""."
39;The film is probably the most gorgeous film I have seen by Jean.
40;The film is full of colors, absolutely vibrant, reds and blues just pop.
41;"For fans of Godard's '60s work, ""Pierrot Le Fou"" is his most colorful film."
42;It's important to note that the restored high.
43;Dialogue is clean and understandable and Anna Karina's singing voice is crystal clear in this film.
44;"jUDGMENT CALL:Perhaps one of Godard's most accessible films, ""Pierrot Le Fou"" is a film that is best enjoyed after watching a good number of his films that preceded this film."
45;ray for the first time through the Criterion Collection, many people will will be introduced to Jean.
46;Pierrot Le Fou is often seen as an early paradigmatic example of postmodernism in film.
47;In the film, Godard shows his feeling towards American pop culture but Godard also becomes gets political as he uses the film for his characters to discuss the Vietnam and Algerian war.
48;personally, what I enjoy about this film is the adventure that Godard takes you.
49;Ferdinand is reserved, quiet and just wants to enjoy the simple and peaceful life he has at the moment.
50;She's involved with some shady characters dealing with illegal activity but in some way, that is her form of fun and she wants to expose Ferdinand to that life.
51;the way that Godard has shot the film is quite intriguing.
52;It's like it's something natural for them.
53;nevertheless, its the adventure of these two unlikely individuals that I find so interesting.
54;Personally, I found it great to see Jean.
55;The two have really good chemistry onscreen and the fact that we are enjoying this adventure of two people involved in criminal activity is quite interesting.
56;godard has done a great job and utilizing many scenes with the two together to show their story of life together, when things start to become problematic leading up to a pivotal scene that comes out of left field (granted, this is common theme with Godard's '60s films, always expect the unexpected).
57;"overall, ""Pierrot Le Fou"" is an enjoyable stylish, arthouse film."
58;It's also one of those films that I feel is appreciated the more times you watch it.
59;"Pierrot Le Fou is a Godard masterpiece, but I highly recommend watching a few of his films such as ""Breatheless"", ""A Woman is a Woman"", ""A Band of Outsiders"", ""Contempt"", ""Alphaville"" and ""Masculin Feminin"" before tackling on this film."
60;Once you start appreciating Godard's filmmaking, then you'll definitely appreciate this film even more.
61;"This is one of the most exciting films made in the last fifty years
I:12165;62;Only true masters achieve a world view that encompasses so much of life.
I:12165;63;one behind the camera and one in front of it.
I:12165;64;Anna Karina is perfect just being Anna Karina.
I:12165;65;She doesn't have to do much but be her charming and pretty self.
I:12165;66;On one level the film traces a love story from its inception to its demise but on another level its about how pervasive consumer culture has become.
I:12165;67;Consumerism affects every aspect of these characters lives.
I:12165;68;its a very funny film in parts and a very sad film in other parts and even a bit mystical toward the end.
I:12165;69;Its a poignant elegy for the brevity of all things.
I:12165;70;But Godard finds beauty even in emptiness and the ending of this film has an eerie and mystic grace to it.
I:12165;71;Pierrot Le Fou is one of the most satisfying of Godards films.
I:12165;72;it entertains more consistently than any of his other films and it also presents the Godard vision in full.
I:12165;73;The film was the 15th highest grossing film of the year with a total of 1,310,580 admissions in France.
I:12165;74;the former also 5, and the latter his top film, actually a """"hors classe"""" 5."""
75;"nent American director and producer Samuel Fuller sums it up: ""Film is like a battle."
76;This is a gorgeous looking transfer of a beautifully photographed film from the 1960s.
77;ray brings the visuals to the screen with striking clarity.
78;I certainly love the look and even people who hate artsy cinematic snobbery like Pierrot Le Fou can sit still for awhile and just look at the pretty pictures.
79;The audio is perfect for what it is, a basic two channel monaural track.
80;It's the picture that pops!
81;The special features are extensive, including an interview with Anna Karina from recent days.
82;The mainstream viewer would be absolutely right in that opinion since at this point of his career Godard cared less and less about mere entertainment or telling a good story than he did with satirizing consumer culture, the middle class, American imperialism and all that jazz but encased always in this pop art sensibility with the girls and the guns and the crime stories.
83;Resnais has a sense of cinematic form that eludes Godard in most respects.
84;As attractive as the Godard films are and they all look great, I always felt he was the kind of French fraud that one reads about.
85;I know this kind of thing was hip and cool back in the 60s and it was the height of trendiness but I can't stand it!
86;All three are far more penetrating modern voices.
87;spiritual, almost always especially at that point in his career.
88;Still he did photograph a lot of pretty things in beautiful ways and here we have a genuinely gorgeous Blu.
89;luc Godard film so the unexpected always happens.
90;Like pop art, the film uses visuals drawn from cartoons and utilizes a garish visual aesthetic based on bright primary colours, and a parodic, but admiring attitude towards American pop culture, mixing high and low art, dissecting popular movie conventions with a collage.
91;ray looks marvelous in colour, with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.
92;"The set also features a video interview with Anna Karina, an informative ""Pierrot"" primer with commentary by Jean."
93;luc Godard, his life and films with Karina.
94;Like the the works of faience found in Tijuana, Jean.
95;luc takes a poised aim at the portrait of a young man in need of a colorful existence.
96;impressionist, this would be a work of sheer brilliance.
97;Godard built an admirable collage nourished with documental style, hyper kinetic rhythm with frenzy personages at the verge of despair.
98;the nervous camera tells about an initial murder and the escape with Pierrot in search of the coveted liberty, with clever statements and a profound love for the literature and the cinema.
99;the movie maybe result of date for many viewers, and it is absolutely comprehensible.
100;You may consider it as a Theme with Variations, a clever ensemble of vignettes al along this poetic ride.
101;Thriller elements, philosophical inquiries, musings, musical numbers, romance,political asides, essays.
102;Raoul Coutard's cinematography and the music of Bassiak all contribute to the film's myriad felicities.
103;"At the center is the incomparable duo of Jean Paul Belmondo (in his best performance since ""Breathless"") and Anna Karina, the muse of Godard and the New Wave."
104;Godard has pursued his original vision to the letter, with uncompromising passion.
105;It's beneath the artist to explain his work.
106;great video, amazing movie but the it lacks in the extras department.
107;they should have packed everything in one disc and charged less.
108;my favorite thing in this item would be the colorful booklet (essay + review + godard interview + pictures )
109;If you don't care about the presentation and are just dying to see this film again the money is probably worth it.
110;A good friend told me later that she had been profoundly moved, and she simply didn't want to understand why.
111;PIERROT is on of the few examples of true mystical cinema that we have.
112;Make some popcorn, snuggle up to your partner, cat, dog, teddybear whatever and get ready for a cinematic treat.
113;Visually and emotional he keeps you with him the whole way through.
114;This film explodes Hollywood conventions, while praising its auteurs,and in the process transcends all of its literary, cinematic, and artistic influences.
115;For the Godard fan, this is one of his finest efforts, carefully balancing emotion with intellect.
116;The ending scene has to be one of the funniest things I've ever seen on screen.
117;to me this movie is so much about the color redfor me this is godard's masterpiecethe extras are greatanna on t. v. at the venice film festival is pricelesswhat a beautiful, beautiful woman and spirit !
118;This is just a plea to anyone from fox.
119;Why is it so hard to get hold of films by one of the 20th Century's greatest film artists?
120;Thank you for your time.
121;This is a great movie, probably Godard's best.
122;I would recommend that you wait for a decent label to release this film properly.
123;I first viewed this great work with Jose Fernandez, who was delivering a series of lectures here in Southern California, where he alleged that many film directors use archive footage of Popitekus for dermatophytic purposes.
124;He highly recommended Pierrot le Fou as a key example of a director who strives to accomplish just the opposite.
125;This bold attempt at cinematic brilliance merely mimics the magasame visions that Cardonas acheived from the late 1950s through 1965.
126;In the meantime, Pierrot le Fou is worth your time.
127;But Breathless and Pierrot Le Fou are just wonderful.
128;A must see for anyone seriously interested in films.
129;Nonetheless, several sequences are striking and aethetically pleasing.
130;This is suggested only because to this viewer, the film looks mostly terrific.
131;2 stars for the film and 4 stars to Criterions package.
132;Like with Dylan, it's always worth while looking to see if godard is critiquing (or just complicating the approach to) the views that he himself agrees with, or at least thinks are part of the story.
133;Bourgeois cinema says enjoy it, learn from it in an unproblematic way, fascist cinema tells you what to think (left.
134;love the use of color and the subtle violence.
135;Its fun to watch, there's no emotion attached to the characters, its the experience of the film itself.
136;Is this the best version yet?
137;They did good with Seven Beauties, Last Year at Marienbad, and the already LD Criterion.
138;Raoul Coutard's filmography is, once again, stunning.
139;Some might see this as arty pretension, well it is.
140;It's funny, sad, exciting, and most of all enigmatic.
141;containable murderess always on the move, whereas the earlier film all she wants is a kid.
142;also, the end of Pierrot is one of the most abrupt, unexpected, wonderfully humorous and disconcerting of any I have ever seen!So, while I whole.
143;heartedly recommend this to anyone interested, perhaps it'd be best to acquaint yourself with his earlier films to get a gist of Godard's intentions as a filmmaker.
144;All the films mentioned above are outstanding, amazing, brilliant films worth a million Jurassic Parks, Mama Mias, Titanics and ET's.
145;One of Godards best and the criterion extras just make it even better to own.
146;One of the most obtuse of Jean Luc Goddard's french new wave films.
147;The subtleties of the film make it visually beautifully in respect to costume and cinematography but hard to watch in terms of clear plot line.
148;This will almost squash all your passion and longing vision that you have for her.
149;Godare, L'amour, la Poesie, a fifty minute documentary chronicling Godard's life and films with Karina is worth the price of this set.
150;luc from the time period (1965)that show him very relaxed and thoughtful to the questions he is given and his answers.
151;Another filmed interview from the period with Belmondo shows him to also be very relaxed and amusing.
152;It's quite a revelation to see how he was in real life away from the brusk gangsters and ne'er.
153;wells that he played on the screen.
154;The 2 disc set comes with a thick booklet carrying beautiful color stills, a lengthy interview with J. l. g, a nice review from Andrew Sarris and more.
155;i saw this film on the big screen twice in the past year.
156;the Double disc is worth the price for the documentary on Godard and Karina alone.
157;And also for the interview with the latter.
158;Plus, it has a wonderfully insiteful primer from Jean Pierre Gorin.
159;"But it's kind of like billing Woody Allen as the greatest comic filmmaker of our time
I:12165;160;I would say briefly that, in this film, Godard is a master juggler of signs.
I:12165;161;ray, this is pure cinema and pure Godard.
I:12165;162;luc Godard, the darling of French """"New Wave"""" cinema, premiered this film at the '65 Venice Film Festival (where it was Booed!)"""
163;paul Belmondo and Anna Karina as a sexy couple who hit the road to escape the bourgeoisie, it is much more than a road movie.
164;playful, farcical, satiric and at times light.
165;art sensibility pervades this energetically acted film that is enhanced by the emphasis of primary colors and the vivid Technicolor cinematography of Raoul Coutard (who approved this stunning Crierion hi.
166;"(He's ""Ferdinand"" in the movie.)"
167;"He said, ""Life is the subject with CinemaScope and color its attributes."
168;This film is, on one level, a celebration of art for art's sake.
169;ray release warrants a second look at this enduring cinematic treasure.
170;generous extras include an interview with Anna Karina, a 50 minute documentary about Godard's life and films, archival interviews with Godard, Belmondo and Karina.
171;"An enclosed booklet has a fascinating essay by film historian and ""New Yorker"" writer Richard Brody who says: ""Exactly as Godard intended, `Pierrot Le Fou' reflects appropriately vast, cosmic, quasimetaphysical artistic dreams of a Balzacian grandeur."""
172;There are many more like that!
173;Pierrot le Fou is the ultimate french New.
174;It's the closest the New.
175;wave gets to an epic, without becoming a boring Truffault film.
176;The film is packed with little vignettes .
177;but it is more of a comedy then a political.
178;sliced up music, slapstick comedy, primary colours, brilliant dialogue, jump cuts, brechtian sh.
179;It's a perfect starting point for Godard newcomers.
180;Anna Karina and Jean Paul Belmondo are the greatest couple on.
181;Godard is a casting god!
182;Unable to speak of the virtues or vices of this product/movie as it was never something I viewed for myself.
183;Nonetheless, it contains two of the most fabulous scenes I have ever seen: the ever.
184;amusing Vietnam reenactment and [of course] the supremely satisfying ending.
185;Product was in great condition when I got it.
186;It would appear Arkadin cares very much for the service he provides.
187;Growing up in a cultural wasteland, I was more than heartened to finally find someone in the world (Godard) who was on my wavelength!Godard is wonderfully inventive in his use of language, situations, visuals, images.
188;one of my favorite parts of Pierrot le Fou is the scene in which Jean.
189;paul and Anna romp through a forest, hand.
190;Godard's pierrot le fou is one the most successful comedy/tragedy/political/crime.
191;It breaks all the rules, as all his movies do, but plays with such gusto and joie de vivre to keep any audience in their seet untill the end.
192;It stars the great jean.
193;this is an equally enchanting film.
194;Godard's use of color in the widescreen format is very effective (also see 'contempt' it is probably Godard's best color feature).
195;concious cinema at its finest.
196;This is a transitional Godard moment .
197;This is one of his best.
198;she's so cute for the Guillotine.
199;worthy serial killer she is.
200;Well, since the first moment I saw it, I have loved Godard's early movie BREATHLESS, and Belmondo, its star.
201;But I really disliked this movie the first time I saw it, and I still do.
202;its originality makes up for any flaws.
203;This is truly an iconoclastic, anarchistic, nihilistic.
204;I first saw this film a few years ago and remember that I liked it.
205;i think it may be my favorite Godard film of all.
206;Pierrot le fou is also a deeply poetic picture.
207;"It is the surreal color version of ""Breathless""."
208;"Pierrot le fou is a ""happening"" on film."
209;paul Belmondo (as Pierrot / Ferdinand Griffon) is a fantastic comic, impressionist, physical / slapstick actor.
210;and I want to believe that underneath his whimsy, he is profound as well.
211;"He has great chemistry with Anna Karina (as Marianne Renoir) who I have enjoyed in other films by Godard, including ""Alphaville"", ""Bande part"" and ""Vivre sa vie""."
212;The scenes in which Karina sings are priceless.
213;Both lead actors look like they were having a great time making this picture.
214;media and visual symbols is yet another innovative Godard staple thrown into the mix.
215;Pierrot le fou also features a haunting score by Antoine Duhamel.
216;"Since my Appreciation of Cinema class in college (about 1967) I've made it a practice to watch ""art"" films, commercial films and those in the large gray area between in equal measure."
217;One goes into a film from one of the masters/greats/pioneers with a bias towards enjoying it, if not loving it.
218;it has many redeeming scenes to be enjoyed.
219;It is far from a great transfer, many imperfections and a lack of clarity.
220;One memorable scene is when the go to the beach and drive the car into the water.
221;this is a 2 disc set with all of the special features in disc two.
222;this is a classic film but can be hard to follow for some people.
223;So, the movie itself is beyond words, something to be experienced.
224;whether or not that experience is worthy anything to you will vary by person, but I for one, enjoyed it immensely.
225;Criterion has done a masterful job with this edition,and I couldn't have been more pleased with its presentation.
226;Of course, the beautiful cinematography helps out, too.
227;give it a shot, it defied everything I thought it would be.
