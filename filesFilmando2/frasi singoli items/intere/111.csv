1;A colorful, unique blend of fairy.
2;tale and scathing adolescent bitterness, which will serve as a kind of emotional pinnacle to anyone who has ever felt alienated and out.
3;"It's a movie that I can imagine numerous valid criticizms for, but to me it is a gem
4;with an amazing story line and characters.
5;edward scissorhands is an instant classic.
6;get this movie, u'll love it
7;Would highly recommend this movie to any Jonny Depp fans!
8;Found this movie to be very creative in a Tim Burton style.
9;This is the best movie in the world Tim Burton is the coolest guy the movie is goth and kinda Sci.
10;this tale is so wonderful.
11;the way the story progresses is perfect.
12;it gives a perfect blend of drama, comedy, and fantasy.
13;i loved the dreamlike world he created in this film.
14;also johnny depp portrayed edward perfectly.
15;also danny elfman put together a perfect score for this classic tale.
16;This masterpiece takes one of the simplest things like snow and turns it into the most beautiful and saddest tale ever imagined or created.
17;I was surprised at how I reacted at the final conclusion of this marvelous film.
18;Edward knows how to love and be gentle and kind, but still, people won't accept the way he is.
19;This tale is too good and beautiful to be true, and I think it's the saddest film of all time, but also the most beautiful!This is good to watch by anyone, and at anytime.
20;The setting is great, The acting is wonderful, the writing is fantastic, and the directing is spectactular.
21;This movie deserves more than 5 stars!!
22;One day I just opened my eyes and realized that this is one of the most touching movies I've ever seen.
23;tim Burton is my favorite director and Edward Scissorhands is what I consider to be his masterpiece.
24;It is a modern fable for a modern world, a world that always needs a monster to hunt.
25;That's who this movie will touch.
26;and of course, the inconquerable and gorgeous score by Danny Elfman.
27;it is simply perfect that Burton and Elfman collaborate on almost every single film that Burton does.
28;He embodies Burton's vison on the screen.
29;And luckily, in a streak of perfection, this film has all three of these people involved, along with a marvelous story and beautiful art direction.
30;anyway, this is a marvelous movie.
31;It is touching, tragic, beautiful, and funny.
32;And how can you resist another eccentric Johnny Depp performance, complete with Robert Smith hair?I LOVE IT!
33;One of the most astonishing movies i've ever watched.
34;great fantasy no one had ever thought,featuring the american neighbourhoods of the 50's.
35;a timeless classic i never tire of, it's very magical, eye opening to others strife as well.
36;This is the first truly original modern fairy tale in decades.
37;In my opinion, along with 'Big Fish', this is Tim Burton's best work, at least in live action features.
38;this is one of the most incredible movies ever.
39;its sooo sad and brilliant and morbid and beautiful.
40;It is a fantastic story about a man suffering from his scissorhands.
41;In the society, when he does whatever people want, he is considered as a good,clever even a genious guy.
42;The whole story is set on a good atmosphere and also the music express the idea and emotion of the scenes very well.
43;Generally it is a very good film based upon a fantastic, amazing and fascinating story.
44;Tim Burton's imagination is just marvelous.
45;The plot is imaginative, the acting fabulous, everything about this movie is just good.
46;It is a must see.
47;Johnny Depp plays the role so good.
48;It has a sad ending, but it's it's a really good movie.
49;This is probably Tim Burton's best film to date.
50;And with a stellar cast.
51;how can you go wrong?The story is fantastic, brilliantly acted out by all the cast.
52;This is one of the best movies.
53;but it is sad with a great moral.
54;It had to be a difficult pitch, even with the brilliant blockbuster director of Batman and Beetlejuice attached: a fairy tale.
55;Edward Scissorhands is the most hauntingly, strikingly original and beautiful film to come out in decades, and we still have not seen anything quite like it since.
56;A straightforward recantation of the story would not do justice to the complex thematic elements, the incredible imagery, the perfect score, or the once.
57;a. lifetime performances given by Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, and the rest of the amazing cast.
58;town politics, ideals of society and modern culture, and of course exclusionism.
59;the visuals are nothing short of amazing.
60;My favorite is the obvious yet perfect contrast between the neon colors of the neighborhood's cars, houses, and people and the pure black and whites of Edward.
61;You will find many other interesting visual ques obviously, such as the BANK and the castle.
62;side with these visuals, the music is simply breathtaking.
63;Edward Scissorhands is one of the most underestimated and understated films of the decade.
64;It is sure to gain the recognition and understanding it deserves in the near future.
65;One of my favorite movies"
66;I can watch over and over still love the movie
67;This movie really is a fascinating classic story.
68;the town feels so 'plastic' and cookie cut with bright colors that it really does a good job contrasting with Edward's world which is dark, gritty, with lots of grey while his clothing is anything but simple and ordinary.
69;blending the two worlds is done really well as Edward tries to adapt.
70;But the seemingly simple community is full of back biters who are all just fair weather friends with the exception of the family that takes Edward in and a few others.
71;i especially loved a semi minor character in the police officer who seemed to not only understand how fickle the community was but also understood some of the challenges Edward faced and was sympathetic and genuine to him.
72;overall after all these years I still love this film, perhaps even more than before since I feel I understand it more.
73;Highly recommend this one to anyone and it looks great on Blu ray.
74;EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, Tim Burton's masterpiece metaphor about a humanoid creation with scissors for hands is a wonderful statement about how society tends to take the unusual and unique and, after a brief period of acceptance and curiosity, misunderstands it, vilifies it and then hastens to destroy it out of fear and ignorance.
75;Depp's acting versatility shines in one of his finest roles.
76;Vincent Price is wonderful in his cameo appearance as the eccentric inventor who gives Edward life but dies before he is able to complete his creation.
77;tim Burton's creative genius comes through in spades in this wonderful movie.
78;Danny Elfman's striking score is the finishing touch.
79;But from then on till now, I hold respect up to one of the most dramatic and beautiful movies of all time.
80;Combining the perfect talents of Johnny Depp and Wynona Ryder along with a fantastic music score by Danny Elfman, Edward Scissorhands is sure to bring laughs, cries, and above all, the most rewarding time watching a film, then you ever had before!
81;Edward Scissorhands is an excellent piece of work.
82;The story is an enchanting fairytale, pieced together by what I like to call the dream team.
83;This is Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, and Johnny Depp to boot, all at their best.
84;The music, haunting and also seductive, spins a dreamlike background that adds to the story.
85;The direction is so well.
86;planned, the story written so well, and all the parts played with unbelievable skill.
87;From the very beginning of the film, it draws you into a dream, and leaves you there even after the last credits have rolled.
88;This is everything a good movie should be.
89;Tim Burton does an exeptional job with this movie.
90;The acting is fantastic of course, coming from Depp and Ryder, my favorite actors.
91;edward Scissorhands is an amazing acomplishment.
92;She befriends him and takes him home with her.
93;He discovers a whole new world and the daughter of the avon lady, which le likes.
94;"I have always admired his visual style and his visionary status
95;Everything about this film lives and breathes like a Burton fantasy, but at its heart it actually surpasses everything he's every done and delivers a shockingly relevant story of humanity.
96;Like I said, I am a fan of his visual style, but as a whole I've never felt a serious connection to his work.
97;He has infused most everything he's done with a sense of sentiment, but it always felt forced or at best masked by the artistic aspects of his films.
98;It is a stunning film visually, but it is even more stunning emotionally.
99;It mimics the classic monster movies of old, most notably that of `Mary Shelly's Frankenstein' but it brings its own set of heart to the core and delivers a uniquely captivating picture that stands apart as Burton's masterwork.
100;the acting is wonderful here as well"
101;Everything about her performance is dynamic, truly capturing the heart of her character.
102;in the end `Edward Scissorhands' is, to me, a masterpiece.
103;Yes, it is not only the best film of the year that was 1990 but it is truly one of the best films that has ever been made.
104;Tim Burton has rarely been this good.
105;Yes, he is a great director, but this is beyond him.
106;Tim Burton is a brilliant visual director but with Edward Scissorhands he managed to combine these talents with pure, classic storytelling .
107;Scissorhands is his best overall film, abandoning the slight characterizations and special effects.
108;driven spectacle of the (albeit hugely enjoyable) Batman and serving up a convincingly detailed left.
109;esque tale of alienation and the empowerment of love.
110;hand to the joys of life, until accidentally injuring a young boy and becoming the enemy of the overzealous town.
111;the climax is beautifully done and, because Burton has allowed his characters to expand so much, it's also very touching.
112;Burton's never been as good at telling believable stories as he has mythical, exciting fables (see Sleepy Hollow for a similar example).
113;oriented film of his career .
114;"You can literally ""feel"" the vibe of this picture, its heart pulsing black blood."
115;As a result Burton's true affinity for the subject is evident .
116;it's clear that he takes this entire project very seriously.
117;the acting is marvelous .
118;Depp's performance is one of his finest and, arguably, one of the most convincing and fun of all.
119;Depp has formed a Scorsese/De Niro.
120;He's always had fun relishing his over.
121;top and absurdly dark roles, such as Ichabod Crane in particular.
122;This is possibly one of the reasons the film is able to affect its audience so well to this very day.
123;This is a great movie.
124;I used it in class as an example of magic realism.
125;That interesting combination of the extraordinary with the ordinary.
126;Lessons aside though, it's simply very entertaining.
127;I absolutely love this movie, it's a Tim Burton classic!
128;The story was really great, and Johnny Depp is a very good actor.
129;"As a matter of fact, after ""Nightmare Before Christmas,"" it is my favorite."
130;"This movie kept constantly reminding me of ""Nightmare,"" and the story is just beautiful."
131;It was so visually unique and the quirkiness just entertained me.
132;IMO We never got an entertaining Comic.
133;Then I saw Edward Scissorhands and was so touched.
134;Johnny Depp's performance as Edward was probably his best ever (even though his Jack Sparrow was a riot).
135;This is one of Danny Elfman's favorite scores and I would wholeheartedly agree with him.
136;This movie just worked so well.
137;It helps when the director gives something that really came from the heart.
138;Check out also Ed Wood: another Tim Burton film with another great Johnny Depp performance.
139;This is a movie about how this world destroys everything beautiful and sincere.
140;Johnny Depp gives a brilliant performance as the vulnerable Edward.
141;His facial expressions are so cute and heart wrenching that you just want to go up and give him a great big hug!
142;The other actors do a great performance as well, and what can I say about Tim Burton?
143;The guy is an imaginative genius!This movie manages to be very comedic.
144;pants funny, but its the little quirky things that make you giggle.
145;Edward Scissorhands is very touching as well, and you really feel strongly for Edward.
146;This is quite possibly one of the most magical movies I have ever seen.
147;Every adorable expression on his face tells us that he would do anything to have even just one friend.
148;Edward then shows them his wonderful talent at cutting bushes into miraculous shapes.
149;He is in love with his new life.
150;he finds that he is also in love with Peg's daughter, Kim, played by Winona Ryder.
151;"The most unforgettable part in this movie is later when Kim asks Edward, ""Hold me,"" and Edward's response is ""."
152;anyway, everything is going perfectly, until a few accidents happen.
153;I will tell you that this movie has a sad ending.
154;My opinion is that this role is probably Johnny Depp's best.
155;He gives Edward the perfect blend of sadness, happiness and innocence.
156;For the price, I loved this movie.
157;now i always watch it and have seen it millions of times.
158;Not just my favorite genre film, my favorite film period.
159;Nothing can explain the emotional attachment one will have to this film after a few viewings.
160;It may not hit you the first time, but trust me this film is worth the time you put into it.
161;Amazing!This is a much better movie than the posters would suggest.
162;edward finds a place for himself in this suburbia, first trimming trees into fantastic topiary shapes, then trimming dogs (fancy poodle cuts are just the beginning), and finally cutting ladies' hair.
163;it's a touching story, for all it is very funny, and eventually you will see that although he's a construction, Edward is more human than most of the rest of the people in the film.
164;I liked the motion picture of this game.
165;"They both have the wild black hair, both seem a bit odd and both seem to have interesting reactions from their appearnaces and styles from the so called ""normal"" people around them."
166;"The film has avon lady Peg Boggs(wonderfully played by Oscar winner, Dianne Wiest, who has such a positive demeanor all the way thru and a cheerful tone in her voice, especially when she always says ""Hi, Bill""), discover Edward(Depp), living alone in the gothic mansion that raises high above the neighborhood."
167;The film is gorgeous, and has a real fairy tale like atmosphere.
168;It's unknown exactly when the era is, since it appears to have styles out of the 60's and 70's, but there are hints of present day as well.
169;It's a fairy tale, and nothing has to make perfect sense.
170;This may be Depp's best performance.
171;like and fragile, and new to everything around him, that his fear and awe are so realistic.
172;This could very well be his best.
173;His reaction to Wiest's talk about neighbors' new curtains and such is dryly hysterical.
174;Anthony Michael Hall is a great jerk, and Winona Ryder, well, she's just lovely here.
175;The neighborhood ladies all seem authentic and could live in any close knit community.
176;Danny Elfman shines in the music department, giving the score a very whimsical, yet gothic fairy tale sound.
177;"Burton has always had one of the best ""visions"" in Hollywood, and his design here with the brightly colored neighborhood and the dark, gothic mansion, are visions to behold."
178;So are many moments here.
179;The movie has it all.
180;Laughs, drama, romance, gothic fairy tale, and Tom Jones.
181;The developing relationship between Edward and Kim(Ryder), is an interesting one.
182;"At first it seems unlikely, but it's done so naturally and authenticly, that you end up thinking ""Why not?"""
183;In the end, Edward Scissorhands is a masterpiece.
184;Depp is phenomenal, and the heart and soul of this film are fully on display and affective.
185;His art concepts and styleare unique and each of his films speak volumes about what it's like to be the outcast.
186;That is why all his works are so genius.
187;He lives his art and work.
188;And Edward Scissorhands is such an example of how he feels.
189;Diane Wiest sweetly portrays the Avon lady who graciously takes Edward into her home, introducing him to her family and neighbors.
190;It is a quirky, funny, sad movie.
191;It's about Johnny Depp being born, er, created, with scissors for hands!
192;speaking of which, the actual story!
193;He can trim practically anything into a masterpiece, including bushes, dogs and women's hair.
194;He's also very shy and introverted, but despite this, he loves Dianne's daughter but can never find the right words to impress her.
195;This leads to my favorite scene in the movie.
196;the ending is pretty unpredictable.
197;It's another wonderful Tim Burton film and Johnny Depp does an excellent job as Edward Scissorhands.
198;It has some very sweet moments as well.
199;This is director Tim Burton's first cinema pairing with the excellent actor Johnny Depp .
200;a partnership that's still going (on and off) to this day (see also 'Ed Wood' and 'Sleepy Hollow', which are both excellent films).
201;one thing I love about this film is the all.
202;Tim Burton makes wonderful movies especially this one.
203;Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder were great actor and actress.
204;Aside from the superb acting, this has to be one of the most beautifully unusual screenplays ever written, and Tim Burton does it justice.
205;For anyone who likes the ART of film, Edward Sissorhands is a must see!
206;And all of us ended up in tears.
207;I love Tim Burton's work.
208;but this is a masterpiece.
209;There are so few sweet movies that make you *believe*.
210;For every big mansion I see I want to go into it and look for Edward.
211;Edward Scissorhands is not only a brilliant study of man.
212;She brings him to her warm, colourful neighbourhood and integrates him with the family.
213;As a viewer, you'll hope that Edward lives happily but with his scissor like hands, the likelyhood of him being 'normal' is slim.
214;the film unravels itself to be a great piece of cinematic work as it uses bright colours and characters to portray the environment that Edward is living in.
215;He is more than just looks, he has undeniable talent and if you have doubted him before, you'll change your mind when you watch this film.
216;in terms of a film that has soul, character and emotion in it, Edward Scissorhands has all of it.
217;Undoubtedly one of the best film of the 1990s.
218;I remembered enjoying this film as a child so I decided to watch it again with my children, not remembering much of the details of the movie from so long ago.
219;what a wonderful and safe community, that is until Edward comes in.
220;They are made up of sharp knives, scissors and other cutting implements.
221;After all what could possibly happen with him in this great town?Quite a bit!
222;Edward Scissorhands is a marvellous comedy spoofing the lives and values of a myopic community.
223;"Diane Wiest does a great job in her role as the Avon lady who brings this weird ""monster"" into the community."
224;"johnny Depp gives us a stellar preformance as Edward, the creative, quiet and reflective young ""creation"" who is slowly emerging from his years of isolation."
225;His openess for change and need for acceptance will touch your heart.
226;Find out in this splendid tale.
227;I have always enjoyed this movie.
228;I thought that my students would enjoy it also.
229;I always felt that Burton and Depp when making a movie usually succeeded best when it was an original Burton concept rather then a take on someone elses brainchild except for Sleepy Hollow, which I feel did right by Washington Irving's story, as opposed to Alice and Willie and Barnabas.
230;Its a cursed talent Edward has.
231;Edwards story tell us that you cant have just one and expect the other to maintain.
232;But would have had his true love and he could have created a happy medium between the two.
233;A great fairy tale, probably will always be Burton's greatest creation and Depp's most sympathetic role.
234;"I saw this movie when I was little and liked it
235;year old man, and its instantly become my favorite.
236;day Frankenstein with a more strongly emphasized heart, its one of those rare movies that succeeds by pushing its themes to the foreground instead of burying them in layers of symbology and dialogue for the persistant to uncover.
237;And they succeed, on all counts.
238;I'd watch it every day if I had the time.
239;Actually my daughter loves this movie.
240;She is a Johnny Depp fan and that is what counts.
241;Depp's performance in this movie is just as outstanding and intriguing as his other movies.
242;His character is a machine that was turned into a human and his performance is believable.
243;This movie is also a true Tim Burtonesque film.
244;This movies message is quite strong and worth showing to children and adults of all ages.
245;This movie is Tim Burton at his absolute best.
246;The supporting cast is superb.
247;The sets and scenery are timeless.
248;This is a movie that runs the entire viewing spectrum and will be at the top of the list of my all.
249;I am an artist, and have watched this movie for 20+ years with warm regard.
250;Edward is so symbolic of the heart of the artist to me.
251;This idea has a wonderful innocence to me.
252;Not only that he'll have a heart but a sweet one at that.
253;johnny Depp is in one of my personal favorite roles, for me at least.
254;Edward Scissorhands wonderfully shows as people how we accept the odd until the odity no longer suits us.
255;He is loved but then ultimately shunned due to his gift.
256;What is considered normal, and how do we react to it?
257;Where is beauty in the world if not in the eyes of the one doing the looking?Are we able to love without condition?
258;And isnt it possible that a love can grow and be shared from one single moment?
259;With good reason, and I agree with this, it shows both parts of the human spirit, the light and the dark and Edward Scissorhands expresses this without fail.
260;timeless and wonderful the Blue Ray viewing was a real treat since the last copy I owned was a VHS tape.
261;I strongly recommend this to any lover of Tim Burton films, fairy tales, love stories and fantasy.
262;The creative person and passionate soul is the one most likely to connect with this one, one of Tim Burtons best!!
263;What once seemed odd, out of place, or just plain wacked, then becomes a prescient work of art that is honored as being ahead of its time, or at least ahead of the audience's understanding of it.
264;Edward Scissorhands is such a film.
265;I don't recall if I was distracted, just didn't have the time, or simply didn't get it, but upon close attention at long last I find this to be a mesmerizing, beautiful, touching film that defies categorization.
266;This singular vision of director Tim Burton, his fourth hit in a row following """"Pee."""
267;We also see his home and its extremely modern security system.
268;"It's a fairy tale, after all
269;burton belongs to that pantheon of directors whose work bears a unique stamp, visually and aesthetically otherwise, so that it's clear that you're watching a Burton film.
270;That puts him in an elite group of directors, such as Hitchcock, Spielberg, Kubrick, Scorsese, Bergman, Tarantino, Fellini, Spike Lee, Sidney Lumet, David Lynch, Woody Allen, Robert Altman, etc., not bad company to be in.
271;it also carries the delicious depth of story that one has to plumb after viewing.
272;In any event, this is well worth repeated viewing.
273;Burton's earlier successes are detailed above.
274;Just a note added in the cause of correct information.
275;OMG, this is one of my favorite movies.
276;Actually, it's my favorite movie after Rain Man.
277;I mean, come on, even as a 13 year old girl, I can see how cute, loveable, and sweet he is.
278;I mean it's the perfect mix of genres.
279;Drama, some funny moments, fantasy, etc.
280;Believe me, those of you who haven't seen it yet, you MUST see it.
281;I'm guessing that it's such a great movie cause it came out the year I was born lol :) Enjoy
282;I absolutely adore Tim Burton films .
283;, but is actually very touching and heartwarming.
284;I don't know how people make these kinds of things up, but it works here .
285;Just finish it up with Beetlejuice or something to retore your faith in the value of human/non.
286;I just love this movie, not too much more to say.
287;I really haven't had a chance to watch the whole movie but what I saw of it was cute.
288;Johnny Depp, as always, plays a strange character but seems to do a good job of it.
289;I was really excited to hear what Tim Burton and Danny Elfman had to say in their interviews.
290;Both could play the movie, which is a real gem, but not the interviews.
291;but hey, its a really cool film.
292;edward should be required viewing for children, it says so much about how quickly people can adobpt a gang mentality and stop thinking for themselves and it does it in a humorous way.
293;Great movie for anyone whose ever been the odd man, woman, boy or girl out.
294;Another genius production by Tim Burton!!
295;As a huge fan of Time Burton AND Johnny Depp, it is my completely unbiased opinion that this is (perhaps) one of the most underrated Christmas Love stories of modern times!!
296;Edward Scissorhands is definitely a love story!!
297;It is the story of the love between a father and a son and a son and his father.
298;It is the tale of love between a boy and girl.
299;the classic forbidden love as in Romeo and Juliet.
300;Johnny Depp also provides great character development without speech.
301;A misshapen boy with scissors for hands is discovered by the Avon lady high above the city in his creator's dark castle.
302;EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is undoubtedly Tim Burton's personal masterpiece"
303;Danny Elfman's magnificent score drives the emotional highs and lows as well, while Bo Welch does a brilliant job contrasting the cookie.
304;Cult status aside, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS must be considered a classic of its time, and one of Tim Burton's finest achievements.
305;Edward Scissor Hands is by far my favorite love story ever to be told.
306;It is genuine and heart touching.
307;i was only 7 years old when this movie came out and yet I always felt it had touched me and exactly understood the main reason for this film being still at such young age.
308;I will always be able to relate this film to society's behavior due to even 20 years later it has aged so well.
309;This is truly a Tim Burton Film, from the art direction to the quirky yet lovable characters.
310;I liked all of his movies, but I didn't realize that they were his of course.
311;But besides that, I was amazed at the beautiful film.
312;Watch this movie for a touching story with a little comedy thrown in.
313;There's so much emotion and sadness in his eyes.
314;he was the perfect guy for the role.
315;This story is, on the surface, a bittersweet story about a (boy?
316;another great thing about the movie).
317;I'm going to watch it again!
318;I've seen a few films that look their full of pixels.
319;This one does have it moments when the scenes get really dark, but the day scenes are pretty sharp.
320;Edward Sissorhands is one of the best movies ever created!
321;The people in the town were crazy about him he was well received by everyone!
322;He cut the boy of the Avon lady and he also cut the hand of Winona Ryder.
323;brilliantly made Burton is a genius.
324;lines then this movie is for you!
325;i love this movie very much, so naturally i couldnt wait to receive it.
326;I know the peice is good.
327;A few minutes into the movie and I was hooked!
328;Watch this movie for yourself, it's wonderful, and you won't regret it!
329;"Then last week, I was watching the FOX special, ""Greatest Christmas moments of all time"" and they included some parts from this film."
330;I realized that I really HAD to see it!
331;The granddaughter points out that it's snowing outside, and asks why.
332;She continues, saying that long ago there was a scientist who tried to create a person.
333;Though she is frightened by Edward at first, she soon realizes that he is very innocent and shy.
334;And she takes him home with her.
335;This includes waterbeds, dogs, nosy neighbors, jealous boys, and the teenage daughter (Winona Ryder) of the woman that took him in.
336;Edward himself is a very sweet character.
337;He can talk, though he hardly ever chooses to.
338;Johnny Depp does a wonderful job as playing him.
339;This movie made me a big fan of his.
340;They were actually considering him!This is film is a rare wonder.
341;The acting is wonderful by everyone, especially Depp (as I said before) and Ryder.
342;It's very sweet and touching.
343;Tim Burton, like always, brings great directing and visual scenery to the movie.
344;I was pleasantly surprised by this film.
345;It's just astonishing and beautiful.
346;it was a precious movie.
347;and he loved the movie.
348;Johnny's character is so innocent and sweet, you can't help but love him.
349;The whole Tim Burton effect is evident also.
350;It's a win win movie and I'll never grow tired of it.
351;This is American film at its finest.
352;The story is so well.
353;crafted, yet so juvenile that it seems like a 6.
354;This brings me to the acting, which is DEFINITELY Johnny Depp's best collaboration with Tim Burton, possibly his best film ever.
355;Depp conveys so many emotions with so little words that he speaks about as much as Woody Allen at a 50 Cent party, yet gets as many points across as Star Jones on cocaine.
356;It really is a truly amazing performance.
357;His amazing level of not belonging is almost endearing, and surely this movie will bring tears to the eyes of even the most adament of tough guys.
358;Winona Ryder and Michael Anthony Hall are the supporting cast.
359;He is completely believable, and you will have no problem hating him early in the film.
360;"edward Scissorhands also carries an incredible moral, and thatr is that when you are a novelty as he is in this world, your ""friends"" are prone to turn on you any time, just as they do on Edward."
361;They use him to trim hedges and cut hair, two of his amazing abilities.
362;overall, Edward Scissorhands is one of the best films I have ever seen.
363;It is the best Johnny Depp movie and one of the best, if not the best Tim Burton film.
364;Edward Scissorhands is an example of the magic that can happen when story, director, cast and crew all come together to create a classic.
365;I was totally willing to suspend my disbelief and revel in the superb performance of John Christopher Depp II as Edward Scissorhands, and marvel at the exquisite direction of director Tim Burton.
366;Burton really has a great visual sense, especially when he puts it in the service of his inner child.
367;"[On Vincent Price] ""One of the most incredible moments I've ever had was sitting in Vincent's trailer . . . I was showing him this first."
368;edition book I have of the complete works of [Edgar Allan Poe], with really amazing illustrations.
369;Then he closed the book and began to recite it to me in this beautiful voice, filling the room with huge sounds.
370;It was a great moment.
371;"and I remember looking and going, ""Wow, this is it."
372;Winona Ryder is stunningly beautiful as the young Kim.
373;The rest of the cast is great as well.
374;st) is great as Avon representative Peg Boggs.
375;Alan Arkin is great as her husband.
376;to top it all off, Vincent Price caps off a stunningly illustrious career with this masterpiece that seems tailor made for his unique talent.
377;He has a small but pivotal role as the mad inventor and creator of Edward.
378;I can see that I've disturbed you.
379;Johnny is such an awesome actor.
380;The director is really cool.
381;Wrapped up in a young girl's question of why it snows in the winter, the film tells a simple fable of a person created by an old inventor.
382;The strange man is brought into a new, strange world .
383;"fairy tales are pure style in themself
384;Within the tale, Tim Burton says a lot through striking visuals .
385;colored, gossipy world, to the quirky world of the inventor.
386;Like many of the best fairy tales, there is subtle parodies of society invoked, and you may laugh at a few of the concepts.
387;but what's really striking about this film is the tender outsider story, the heart of the film.
388;Outsider stories are common in Hollywood movies, but few (dare I say none) display such empathy and innocence.
389;the innocence and heart .
390;of Johnny Depp's character, that makes this movie incredibly powerful.
391;like score (his best so far) further enhances the effect, with beautiful layers of boy's choir enveloping the most striking visual elements.
392;this is one of my favorite films.
393;But its definitely one of the best films of its genre .
394;There is just one word (or should I say one way) I can use to describe this film, a work of art.
395;The gothic atmosphere of Tim Burton is still working great, the effects are top notch, and the acting is perfect.
396;In short, a great film.
397;Came in a nice box with no scratches or anything and I just love watching how cute Johnny Depp is!
398;But it has since become my favorite fantasy film.
399;Straight from Tim Burton's subconscious vision he paints the tale a sensitive, isolated stranger who is brought into the realm of Day.
400;glo suburbia by an Avon lady with the best of intentions.
401;The story unfolds as the Main character is perceived as both creative and destructive by the denizens of this pristine, ordered world.
402;but bittersweet, beautiful, visual storytelling takes this classic theme and elevates it to the highest artform a film can acheive.
403;but abhorred as a personality by those who worship their art.
404;The characters are its pungent ingredients: Johnny Depp's innocent Edward, Winona Ryder's ethereal Kim, Alan Arkin's crusty Bill, Dianne Wiest's sweet Peg, Anthony Michael Hall's brutal Jim, Kathy Baker's man.
405;Edward's world gives color, from his black and white castle, to his eerily green gardens, to the pastel.
406;The story brings the meal together with chew and crunch .
407;and Edward's and Kim's romance finishes dinner sweetly.
408;which, like Rocky and Bullwinkle, is a special treat for the grownups who get what the kids don't .
409;Edward Scissorhands is a serious yet playful look at suburban living, and what can happen when a new factor arrives unannounced.
410;He quickly makes friends with all, through the amasing artwork in hedges and hair.
411;Burton weaves this beautiful story next to Danny Elfman's musical score, possibly the best of his career, and the two are a perfect match.
412;and so does Jim, with a gun.
413;The brillant portrayal of Edward by Johnny Depp will soften even the most stony heart, as Depp conveys millions of emotions with few words.
414;Even though Edward's hands may not be finished, his heart is.
415;such a delicate character whom captures the heart of most everyone he meets.
416;I admit it is a rather odd movie but well directed, and the music and the ice/snow scene is just breathtaking.
417;My four year old shares in the love of this movie and wants to watch it all the time.
418;This was a gift for my daughter and she was very happy to receive it.
419;Thanks to those who do this.
420;The colors are great, and the detail is good, but there is some fine grain in some background scenes that seem to fibrate (the grain seems to move).
421;This has certainly got to be one of Burton's most imaginative creations.
422;I can't remember a movie be that puzzlling, and yet so interesting and fun.
423;I laughed, I cried, then I laughed some more.
424;There, he is welcomed by the townpeople as he did their gardening (made wonderful figures from the trees) cut their dogs' hair and the people's hair.
425;boyfriend, Jim, who thinks he lost her to a non human thing.
426;a fight ensues and Jim is killed and Kim tells Edward that she loves him.
427;and it's the last time they see each other.
428;this story is a fairy tale but when u watch it, seems so believable.
429;so innocently makes you love him.
430;what a bittersweet ending!Edward and Kim made a truly beautiful yet odd couple.
431;between a real woman and a real yet unreal man.
432;Tim Burton is one of those kind of directors where 2 or 3 of his films out of a whole filmography goes into a debate on which one's the best.
433;You probably even disagreed with me right there, well for Tim Burton it comes down to either Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood.
434;Well certainly this film is quite enjoyable but don't think it's one of those family films for all ages like Grinch Stole Christmas or something.
435;But at a certain age, they'll love it.
436;The rest of the cast is of course perfect from Dianne West to Anthony Michael Hall(!)
437;of course it's a family film so it's very vibrant and colorful and full of trademark Burtonisms.
438;One can make a case that his films tend to be great set design with the occasional good film sometimes attached to it well Scissorhands manages to be very eye.
439;catching as well as being just a solid film.
440;life story interwoven with aspects reminiscent of a fairy tale and for that it's a successful mix.
441;It's essentially the perfect family film for outsiders, people who can handle it but if you're thinking this is in line with Bambi or Cinderella well you'd be quite mistaken.
442;depth look behind the music, art design, Depp's training with scissors, a retrospective on the making?
443;it's hard to recommend since my comments about its mild language and violence still stand but this is still one of Burton's better films and one of the best from the 90's.
444;its a gift but I just know the grandson is going to love it!
445;its a very touching movie.
446;It's a joy when the ending credits start to roll and the only thought that comes to mind is this is the movie I've been waiting for my entire life!
447;Maybe 'a joy' is underselling its importance.
448;Edward Scissorhands is one of the most beautiful masterpieces these eyes have ever seen.
449;In every imaginable facet, Edward Scissorhands is perfect.
450;It is also a movie that can be interpreted in so many ways.
451;His appeal is practically universal in that sense, although Burton certainly doesn't sacrifice an ounce of his vision to make his film appeal to everyone.
452;In the film's shocking showdown, he shows the outcome of two world's colliding: one of a gentle, misunderstood nature, and one of a greedy, self.
453;Apart from the humor and the dark elements, there is a touching and doomed romance between Edward and Kim that balances out the film and makes it work on every level: as a dark comedy, a tragic romance, and a grim fantasy.
454;Two particular sequences that are visually memorable are Edward's B&E and his ice sculpture scene when Kim dances under the ice flakes.
455;In those, Burton proves to be a director that fully understands what kind of shots elicit certain emotions and uses that knowledge to his full advantage.
456;The score by Danny Elfman plays on the whimsical fantasy elements of the story in a very effective manner.
457;Johnny Depp as the title character is spectacular.
458;Winona Ryder as Kim, the gorgeous love interest, is spot.
459;Dianne Wiest is hilarious as a door.
460;Kathy Baker is a lovelorn, middle.
461;The entire cast is truly brilliant and do a magnificent job of taking Burton's zany ideas and turning them into reality.
462;Bravo to everyone involved in the production for helping make this cinematic miracle.
463;This movie I'd definitely worth watching, I enjoyed every moment of it.
464;If you are a Johnny Depp fan, you can see the movie that launched him on his way to being the master of quirky roles.
465;This is a classic Tim Burton movie that every fan should own.
466;This movie was a masterpiece.
467;It is very rare to find an artistically sound movie that is also entertaining enough to please the masses.
468;Johnny Depp's greatest role and the best collaboration he made with Tim Burton.
469;This movie is dark, yet very funny and heartwarming.
470;Story and cast is superb.
471;Great for all ages to see.
472;I'm a huge Burton and Elfman fan.
473;This is a classic Burton film and has an incredible score by Danny Elfman.
474;He lives alone without human contact until one day Diane Wiest's avon lady comes calling and introduces him to a whole new world.
475;It's both strange and exciting for Edward whose initially excepted as the eclectic towsfolk use him as a hedge.
476;this movie is truely amazing and definitely one of my favorites.
477;tim burton's directing is so utterly wonderful and danny elfman's music fits with every aspect of the film PERFECTLY.
478;Johnny Depp is so terrific in this movie.
479;Truly, one of the most original films this side of Halloween Town.
480;Edward Scissorhands Is One Of The Best Movies In The 1990's.
481;Everybody Loved Edward Execpt For The Boyfriend.
482;This Movie Is Great For Your Collection.
483;Prior to """"Edward Scissorhands"""", Burton had success with """"Pee Wee's Big Adventure"""", """"Beetlejuice"""", and """"Batman."""
484;Fortunately for us, this offbeat yet sweet fable was Burton's pet project.
485;If you examine his performance closely it's a very intricate one.
486;Despite the Robert Smith of the Cure getup and razor appendages Depp is able to convey the poignance that's at the heart of his character.
487;There's also highly imaginative art direction by Bo Welch and another clever score by Danny Elfman.
488;"I hadn't seen this film in ten years or so but along with ""Ed Wood"" and ""Big Fish"" this is one of Burton's crowning achievements."
489;Tim Burton directs a phenomanal movie.
490;I Recommend it for everyone
491;This is one of my all time favorite movies from when I was a child.
492;I still love this movie now it's just a beautiful movie
493;Tim Burton has outdone himself with this surreal fairy tale.
494;day classic attempts to decommercialize Christmas.
495;The ice dance, for example, was enchanting and still gives me chills even though I've seen this film several times.
496;Depp was (as he always is) perfect.
497;One of my favorite movies ever.
498;Loved it when I was kid and I will love it for many years to come.
499;This movie shows Burton at his finest.
500;"His early 90's film ""Edward Scissorhands"" is Burtons best movie and argueably one of the best movie of it's time!"
501;johnny Depp, Winnona Ryder, Dianne Wiest and Actor Icon Vincent price star and do a superb job of helping Burtons job go a little more smoothly with there great performances.
502;Edward Scissorhands is a MOdern Drak FairyTale that is wonderful and touching for the whole family.
503;Movie rocked and Johnny Depp is amazing!!!
504;Tim Burton is a great director.
505;A must see movie for sure.
506;The soundtrack that Danny Elfman created for this movie is by far one of the most endearing, and most copied in it's similarity for various products being advertised during the Christmas season.
507;I guarantee you that after 16 years now, you will hear a commercial this holiday season emulating this sound track once again.
508;The mood of this soundtrack engulfs the listener with a wonderful collage of melancholy, innocence, beauty and wonder.
509;This Elfman creation is one of the greatest musical sound tracks you will ever experience.
510;stages the film which is quite a compliment and accomplishment.
511;Edward Scissorhands is an innocent, beautiful and sentimental journey of love that can never be realized between by Johnny Depp's and Winnoa Ryder's characters.
512;Thank God for you buddy.
513;PQ is excellent with vibrant colors, with very good detail.
514;This is a dynamic 4.0 sound track.
515;This is a sensetive tale told beautifully and modestly .
516;with a wonderful feel and an excellent soundtrack.
517;"There is magic in this little gem, and I am still, to this day, sympathetic toward Edward's ""handicap""."
518;he's got the right idea, though .
519;This story is easy to relate to for those tender misfits with big hearts.
520;Misunderstood artists and romantics unite, Edward scissorhands is alive and wants a place in your imagination.
521;Heck, he IS imagination, manifested!This movie has a subtle way of expressing many cultural issues in a wonderful, creative spirit.
522;"It is pulled off so effectively that one must wonder how much ""Edward"" is really Tim Burton, because the movie is so candid, so personal, that there is a genuine honesty working here."
523;edward Scissorhands may never have a place in this world, but for fans, he holds a special place in the heart.
524;on top of a hill, just beyond a place we like to call reality.
525;I am happy to know this place.
526;Tim Burton pulled of quite an achievement when he made Edward Scissorhands.
527;Every detail from casting, set design, costumes, music.
528;There is such a sweetness and fragility to the whole thing on the one hand and a lot of laughs and satire on the other.
529;Depp is brilliant and Wiest is right there with him.
530;Wynonna is lovely spinning a snow of ice ships while Edward works his magic.
531;Any one who's a fan of Tim Burton or Johnny Depp would enjoy this movie!
532;He captures the soul of the sensitive,creative, tortured Edward Scissorhands and makes the story believable.
533;Bought this for my son and his girlfriend.
534;It still speaks to teens just as it did when it first came out.
535;Edward's natural talents manifest as he attempts to settle in, displaying remarkable skills in imaginative hedge.
536;In a most memorable and pathos.
537;the music is hauntingly beautiful, conjured by Musickal Magician Danny Elfman, whose eclectic orchestrations I thuroughly enjoy through their many manifestations.
538;The aesthetics are enthralling, repleat with trapezoidal angles and awe.
539;edward Scissorhands is a romantic escapade into the life of one de.
540;Will only continue to get better with age.
541;Fun watching it again after many years.
542;It's a good as everyone says.
543;Edward Scissorhands is an incredible movie, it definitely ranks in my top 10 all time favorite movies.
544;The best thing in the movie is the casting.
545;Everyone is absolutely PERFECT for thier parts.
546;"The second thing that hits you is the ""look"" of the community and neighborhood."
547;they all work perfectly together to set the stage.
548;Third is the story itself, which is very endearing and touching, yet strange and unique.
549;I think this is Tim Burton's best work.
550;Tim Burton's vision of a modern day fairy tale succeeds in capturing the essence and heart of the dream.
551;Johnny Depp, one of Hollywood's most underrated actors, delivers an outstanding performance as the lonely hero.
552;This is a great, touching story that kids and adults of all ages can love.
553;Great acting by the cast .
554;Johnny Depp is particularly good.
555;And the sets and scenery are wonderful.
556;well I had weird tastes then and I have weird tastes now.
557;I'm still yearning to live in a fairy tale and I'm still in love with Edward.
558;burton's movie is a spectacular take on the tragedy of humanity always unable to accept and understand each other if it stands in the way of protecting themselves.
559;But Burton brings out the compassion in any (willing) member of the audience and reminds watchers that there is humanity and love in the strangest and even the most dangerous of creatures.
560;this is a great movie.
561;any movie with Johnny Depp is great so take the time to check it out.
562;by the end of the movie you will really feel for edward and wish him the best.
563;Tim Burton has made some incredible films.
564;His atmosphere that he creates is surely one of the best qualities of his films.
565;Well, not only does this film have that, it also has great acting, great writing, and the best score ever!
566;It is funny, eerie, and it is one of my top 20 favorites of all time.
567;Viewing Burton's creation from this framework significantly improved the picture .
568;i think that it is a wonderful story that was done very well.
569;every person i talk to loves this movie (or doesn't not like anyways).
570;its definitely something to excperience.
571;It appeals to the strange geek inside us all who just wants to be accepted for what he is.
572;THe extras are quite neat with commentary tracks, production art, and best of all some old Burton shorts.
573;THe image clarity is fantastic, as is the sound on this disc.
574;It has some really cool animated menus too.
575;Bottom line is if you like Burton films, you will love this one.
576;this movie is a funny, yet sad movie that all can enjoy!!!
577;Johnny Depp played edward like he was real,you should see this movie you'll love it to.
578;This movie is a great movie!
579;There is some blood and violence but besides that its a very good movie.
580;When I first saw it it was one of my favorite movies.
581;This movie is very sad but it's a great movie.
582;I thought Edward ScissorHands was an excellent movie.
583;It was funny and a little sad in some parts.
584;So if you're a Johnny Depp fan you'll really like it just like I did.
585;I remember seeing this movie when I was a little kid and loving it!
586;I know now that i really loved this movie because it was a great movie that I could relate to.
587;I am a huge Tim Burton fan now, and this movie is still just as amazing as when I first saw it.
588;Johnny Depp's performance is excellent!
589;It is definitely a must see for any Tim Burton fan or you love a great movie that I am sure alot of us can relate to.
590;I think this is a good movie that i had ever seen.
591;If you havent seen it you got to see it.
592;While this artistic piece doesn't end like a fairytale, it keeps you thinking and enjoying the beauty even in the dark sadness.
593;Tim Burton and Stanley Kubrick are my two favorite directors of all time.
594;And needless to say, Edward Scissorhands is one of my favorite films from Burton.
595;This is a classic modern fairy tale that's full of humor, tragedy, and colorful suburbia.
596;Johnny Depp as Edward is so believable, that I doubt anyone else could've played the part.
597;Winona Ryder may be in a rut these days, but here she's lovely.
598;Her growing affection for Edward makes for a beautiful atmospheric way of making the story shine.
599;Vincent Price is memorable in his last film role.
600;And finally, Anthony Michael Hall is Jim the main antagonist.
601;Danny Elfman works the story with lots and lots of orchestral emotion.
602;"The suburbia music is catchy and a bit jazzy
603;This movie is a must for fans of Tim.
604;I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the work of Johnny Depp.
605;The characterizations are clear, as is the moral tale, the color palets, the dichotomies.
606;The goth appearance of Depp is striking for 1990.
607;Burton's stop animation works are a much better realization of his creativity.
608;This movie is dark but beautifully visual.
609;the castle grounds are spectacular!
610;if you love Tim Burton's work you will LOVE Edward Scissorhands!
611;I saw this movie for the first time in theaters when I was eight years old and it has always been way up there on my favorites list a great movie for both kids and adults.
612;Johnny and Wynonna did excellent performances in this movie.
613;The reason this will and has touched so many people is because who among us have not felt like the only strange one in a white.
614;I think this is the best movie of him.
615;Like most Tim Burton movies this is a story that could have walked right out of a fairy tale.
616;There are elements of fantasy, of love, of miracles, and of difference in a world that is far too ordinary.
617;we are introduced to a small town of perfect families, of perfect houses, of stereotypical duplicates.
618;at first he is seen as a curiosity and along with his presence he brings creativity and inspiration.
619;His innocence and his large heart hold universes that are unattainable with the faked duplicates he is surrounded by in the village.
620;a powerful movie with many powerful messages.
621;This is such a great movie on many levels.
622;Original idea, Excellent characters, perfect cast, outstanding storyline, wonderful subplots.
623;It will leave you somewhat sad, but it is a wonderful journey of sight and sound and imagination.
624;Don't ever let anyone tell you that you have a handicap, one of those neighbors tells Edward towards the beginning of the movie.
625;Only one character, Kim, succeeds in (literally) embracing difference.
626;Although all the characters in this movie are caricatures, it's a great irony (and masterstroke on the part of Mr. Burton) that the most unusual.
627;The greatest part of his acting is nonverbal, far beyond the few words he softly speaks.
628;In the scene where Edward begins giving haircuts, he reminded me of a soulful concert pianist, in how his surprisingly gentle movements were each charged with emotion.
629;but to me (besides the touching scene where embraces Kim), one of the most poignant moments was when Edward flinched away from the Avon lady's touch, when one would *think* that of the two characters, he was the least threatened.
630;It is tragic that his exposure to """"what we call reality"""" resulted in such great pain to Edward and Kim."""
631;Loved it since I was a kid and now my daughter loves it.
632;This is such a cute movie and there is some humor in it as well it is a very touching movie and I loved it!
633;I am a huge fan of Johnny depp movies but this is probly one of my favorite ones that he has done
634;Edward Scissorhands is beautifully portrayed by Johnny Depp in this unforgetable fantasy and I strongly recommend this movie to anyone.
635;I admire the character, I admire actor, and I can truthfully say this production is nothing short of a masterpiece.
636;There are so many artistic touches and Stan Winston's contribution to the film that don't not get mentioned in any depth.
637;The transer and sound are wonderful, the colors are crisper and most noticably the facial scars seemed more prominant in the transer.
638;This dark and odd fairy tale is an interesting and somewhat original watch, but calling it a masterpiece is a bit too much.
639;Director Tim Burton presents a captivating and well.
640;Johnny Depp provides a solid performance as the fragile and curious protagonist, and the rest of the cast is good as well.
641;Overall, this is a poignant and absorbing offbeat effort, one that proves Tim Burton`s uniqueness and creativity.
642;This was an amazing movie at a great price!
643;I would definitely recommend both the movie and this seller.
644;This movie is really very sweet and funny.
645;It really is a great film.
646;an unfinished creation is welcomed to a small.
647;I've always liked this film and Johnny and Winonahave good chemistry.
648;ray has nice picture and soundplus commentary, a featurette and trailers.
649;ray of this Burton classic.
650;It is a good movie with a good message.
651;I thought the visuals were very important to the overall feel of the movie and burton did a great job with them
652;The story, the characters, the quirky Burton gadgets, everything.
653;It is now quickly becoming one of my favorite movies ever, but then again, I am a huge Burton fan.
654;One of the most amazing, touching, charming, saddest and heartfelt movies I ever had the pleasure of watching.
655;Thank you Tim Burton for showing such a human/ touching side of yourself in this masterpiece.
656;this movie is exelent from tim burton thats amazing movie from his imagination 5 stars.
657;and is a classic movie
658;"up to ""Batman"" is a modern reimagining of ""ThePhantom Of The Opera,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""Beauty and The Beast"" and other stories of people who are deformed on the outside, but their hearts are noble."
659;The performances of Depp and Ryder {Ryder is always special}, are top.
660;The others are also fine.
661;the soundtrack accompanies the feature well.
662;The word 'haunting' comes to mind.
663;just the right touch of humor.
664;social commentary?Grounded in realism but still fantastic.
665;"We have watched ""Edward Scissorhands"" with other people, and been surprised when they declared it ""nice"" or ""OK""."
666;My husband and I think this is an incredible fable.
667;Everytime I watch it, I tear up through the last 10 minutes.
668;this is worthy of Shakespeare, though I'm not sure if it would be a drama with some comedy or a comedy with some drama.
669;there is a lot of humor, and the acting is brilliant, keeping in mind that this is meant to be stylized.
670;"and what an evocative end:""You see, before he came down here, it never snowed."
671;Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.
672;Edward Scissorhands is a lovely movie.
673;it was in great condition.
674;tragic movie about a very lonely man, living in a wickedly haunting house on top of the hill.
675;while filled with fun moments, especially the lawn sculptures, it really made me empathize with his lonliness.
676;It was my absolute favorite movie growing up.
677;Of course I bought it because it brought back memories and this movie is still as wonderful as it was sixteen years ago.
678;Peg invited Edward to come home and live with her and her family.
679;This sets Edward on a long, exciting journey learning how to live as others do in suburbia.
680;this is such a wonderful story told through the creative imagination of Tim Burton.
681;Edward's innocence will tug at your heart as you watch this fragile creature go from being the talk of the town to the thing they fear most.
682;Definately one of Johnny Depp's top performances.
683;This is also the most creative and heartfelt fairy tales I have ever seen.
684;Great for people of all ages.
685;I recommend it to everyone.
686;A great film to watch with the whole family.
687;Johnny Depp is awesome and it's definitely worth seeing.
688;The creative and fertile imagination of Tim Burton reached the peak with this incredible and poignant fable .
689;The script is well known for all of you , so I want to emphasize is the rapture , the dark poetry and the presence of a model in the cinema .
690;johny Depp made the most powerful artistic performance about a unknown and never created before character .
691;Heaccepted the role and won by far .
692;the atmosphere is top of the line .
693;johnny Depp is actually one of the greatest actors in the world .
694;And I think his talent grew up in this film and somehow this movie blessed him .
695;beat roles and so well!
696;This movie is a classic Burton film with amazing visual direction and unique story.
697;It's certainly weird, but has a very cool feel to it.
698;This is a highly imaginative tale of a young man whose over the top, unusual gifts make it impossible to fit into a very narrow minded community.
699;Edward Scissorhands has absolutely no one who can truely understand his existence and special gifts.
700;We are ultimately alone, and to find a soul mate, who you can share your joys, passions, gifts, and self with is something highly creative individuals yearn for, and what I believe this film portrays.
701;A wonderful gift from Tim Burton!
702;After watching this movie of the adventures of Edward Scissorhands, I thought it was a masterpiece.
703;But I am happy that's he's alive.
704;The Theme of this story is beauty because of how beautiful Edward makes things.
705;Edward Scissorhands is by far one of the single most best movies Mr. Tim Burton has ever made during his whole movie directing life.
706;Johnny Deep did an amazing job as always with the character he played in the movie and Winona Ryder also mind blowing preformance made it one of my favorite movies of all time in my collection.
707;And also love the music of Danny Elfman uses for the movie such a great talent the man has for all of Tim Burton's movies.
708;Great film, great transfer, the extras are great the commentary is interesting (even though Tim Burton rambles).
709;The overall sound is above par, music and dialogue mix nicely.
710;"Adding to this is Burton
711;THe color saturated neighborhood of snobs works in starch contrast to teh blanch and strange edward, making this film a marvel to watch.
712;Edward Scissorhands arrived promptly and in excellent conditions.
713;I'd heard that this was a very good movie about a misunderstood social outcast with a beautifully gothic appearance, but it exceeded even my wildest expectation.
714;The movie has an almost whimsical nature.
715;instead help to transport you to this world where such innocence, such a pure desire to simply love and be loved, can be embodied in one beautiful young man.
716;i think this movie can be best summed up by one of it's taglines: His story will touch you, even though he can't.
717;Edward Scissorhands is a fairytale, full of magic and mystery, sorrow and happiness.
718;edward is brought to life from Burtons drawing in this movie, full of exciting things such as an escape from the police and a bit of hair styling!It tears your heart apart with its signature line:""""Hold me."""""""
719;its a great Christmas movie, telling you how snow was made, but it also is a great all around movie, perfect for families, except for one scene and a few bad words.
720;Johnny Depp as a gothic man made person was a good peformance, and although Winona Ryder looked like a miserable goth in BEETLEJUICE, she looks positively radiant in this Tim Burton classic.
721;This has to be Tim Burton's crowning glory, the summation of his fine appreciation of B. horror movies of the 50's, placed squarely in suburban America.
722;He assembles a fine cast, which is what really makes this movie work with their razor sharp performances.
723;They play beautifully off the ridiculous theme he creates.
724;The movie's strength is in the personal relationships it sets up.
725;I was surprised to find that my 3.
726;year old daughter loves the movie, I think in large part to the compelling nature of Scissorhands himself who is one of the most memorable movie creations of all time.
727;The cast is amazing, the scenery unforgetable, and who can resist Danny Elfmans haunting score.
728;This movie will make you smile.
729;This has always been one of my favorite movies from when I was a kid, so I still love it.
730;Depp at his best and in true Tim Burton fashion :) the right amount of creepy with the right amount of crazy fun!
731;You have to see it if you love Tim Burton!
732;it succeeds in touching your emotions where many more realistic movies fail.
733;while the film is visually stunning and worth seeing just for the scenery, it's really Johnny Depp's performance and Danny Elfman's amazing score that grab you and don't let go.
734;Add a lovely young Winona Ryder and a host of hilarious supporting characters, and you have a modern fairy tale classic (akin to The Princess Bride) that I find myself watching over and over again.
735;i know that in time, my brother will mature and grow to appreciate the magic of Edward just as I do, and will ask me to watch it again.
736;I received this the other day for my daughter.
737;This is an enjoyable film with fabulous scenery and lighting.
738;The rest of the actors are pretty good.
739;overall a good movie, but I'm certainly not dying to see it again.
740;A good analogy of Suburban isolation and small.
741;it's a wonderful and haunting fairytale.
742;the weirdness of this movie enhances its charm.
743;edward attracts a lot of attention very quickly, with his ability to trim hedges and hair to perfection.
744;he is definitely an underrated actor.
745;watch this movie and you'll see that it's a classic.
746;i highly recommend watch this funny, touching, and eerily beautiful film.
747;This a great cult classic, in my opinion, with equal dialog and characteristics of classics like Beetlejuice, and A Nightmare before Christmas.
748;the first time i saw it i thought it was just a comedy, but after a while i was like.
749;OMG this is so SWEET and SAD!
750;TO sum it up in a few words, I believe this is Burton's best film.
751;And I think it's definitely one of Danny Elfman's best aswell.
752;The score really MADE the movie.
753;Maybe, but for sure not as touching.
754;Danny Elfman is personally my favorite composer, and I'm happy that it all just came together for him and Burton alike.
755;God bless, good tidings, and fairwell .
756;This was a great movie that stared Johnny Depp.
757;He is an under rated actor worthy of an award.
758;If you had seen it, watch it again.
759;Edward Scissorhands is quite simply the best fairy tale never told.
760;This is Tim Burton in his eccentric prime, and his presence is palpable in every arena of this beautiful and personal film.
761;The inventive art direction is perhaps the most memorable aspect of that presence, most notably in the pastel palette that covers everything from the ingenius solid.
762;color costumes to the quaint neighborhood/town our characters inhabit.
763;the genius of this movie is more far.
764;from Danny Elfman's quirky score to Stefan Czapsky's meticulous camera work to an entire cast full of nuanced performances.
765;While this film's acting gem is Diane Weist in the role of the sweet and overly altruistic mother, Johnny Depp plays the titular role in a beautifully understated performance.
766;Similarly, Winona Ryder wonderfully (and blondly) embodies young beauty and Alan Arkin turns in a comedic yet touching performance as the sometimes.
767;The ensemble cast is flawless, complementing the quirky but ultimately realistic tone.
768;perhaps the best aspect of this movie is that it achieves its goals with amazing subtlety.
769;insightful commentaries from Tim Burton AND Danny Elfman and an interesting featurette, along with the concept art, trailers, TV Spots, and scene selection we've all come to expect.
770;This is just one of those positively timeless, life.
771;affirming movies that belongs in everyone's collection.
772;Edward played by Johnny Depp is so funny and entertaining.
773;Okay for the whole family to watch together.
774;Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors.
775;made me like a Batman movie!But, I think Edward Scissorhands (along with the Nightmare Before Christmas) is one of his best works.
776;The visuals are stunning, the story grabs your attention and won't let go, and each role is perfectly cast.
777;I enjoyed it when it first came out.
778;She was quite happy with my suggestion.
779;And Johnny Depp is always nice to look at.
780;The soundtrack is moving and hauntingly beautiful.
781;The story is compelling and quirky.
782;My kids love this movie as much as I do.
783;This has to be the one of most favorite and memorable movies of all from Tim Burton.
784;The move itself, is brillant.
785;Edward Sissorhands is about a man with sissors as hands, that lives on top of a mountain.
786;The music in this film is great.
787;Johnny Depp plays an incredible performance on Edward Sissorhands.
788;There's just so much about this movie that is beutiful.
789;I loved it a whole lot.
790;It's just one of those movies that we can only remember by our hearts.
791;If you haven't seen Edward Sissorhands, you've just gotta see this wonderful, imagitive movie.
792;Trust me, it's a movie you'll always remember.
793;Arrived unwrapped, which was a pleasant surprise considering I ordered a used copy.
794;Disc works great and there's some special stuff on there as well.
795;master director, tim burton has created another close to perfect film.
796;I Love this movie !
797;It's always been a Favorite every since I was a little girl.
798;johnny Depp is very good in this movie, so kind and sweet as Edward.
799;I love the style of this movie and Tim Burton is My Favorite Director !
800;This movie is filled with humor and a touch of heart breaking moments.
801;Johnny Depp is the king of unusual parts and this is my favorite.
802;Edward Scissorhands is a must see for everyone.
803;It was kind of hard to see Anthony Michael Hall as a villain but he does a great job from going from the geek in Sixteen Candles to the bully in Edward Scissorhands.
804;This is a great movie.
805;The picture was fine, the special features worked fine, but there was only music and background sounds.
806;I absolutely love this film.
807;I remember seeing it 5 times, at least, when it came to theaters.
808;One of the most beautiful things I remember was how Burton bookended the film with the story of a Grandmother explaining to her grandaughter why it snows.
809;That was truly one of the most emotion provoking scenes I can remember in any movie.
810;i don't know why this movie hits me so hard, but it will always be one of my favorites.
811;Johnny Depp does a remarkable job conveying the duality of his role.
812;"Winona Rider is beautiful and unreachable as well
813;Ice Dance is one of the great scenes and the music alone still brings tears to my eyes even today.
814;Compassion, brotherhood, sadness, happiness and many other emotions come and go as the movie ebbs and turns.
815;It relays the sadness of a love which is never returned and as the credits end RyoOhki ( a cute rabbit/cat mix long story ) ,listening to the song, sheds a tear.
816;That song and this movie have much in common as they both bring forth the same emotions, one using both visuals and a haunting score, the other with some of the most beautiful lyrics ever written.
817;especially the last verse: I love the warm emotion you bring, though there is pain I don't complain.
818;In your arms or far from sight, I'll be your light.
819;I like a great deal of movies.
820;I truly love only few.
821;Every film buff, no, every person who loves a good story must own this film as it is the very definition of fairy tale .
822;To not understand this movie is amazing.
823;release but the movie itself is priceless.
824;its still and always will be my favorite movie.
825;every time i see it i have to fast forward past one specific scary sequence.
826;its got comedy , drama , horror , fantasy , and romance.
827;a combination of all genres.
828;in the middle kim shows up.
829;the soundtracks haunting and inventive.
830;Another perfect choice to add to your Christmas time themed movie collection.
831;This beautiful film (in message and appearance) stars Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder.
832;A story of love that could never be"
833;This movie lives on in many hearts all over the world.
834;A tear jerker that will touch you.
835;Amazing performances add to this great story that you will never forget.
836;I recommend this film highly.
837;"It reminds me of the kind of plot that junior high kids come up with in creative writing class
838;He is so misunderstood that the police even go after him after he accidently cuts people with his razor sharp appendages.
839;I just loved Johnny Depp in the movie.
840;He is a very good actor.
841;I would recommend it to everybody.
842;A classic tale by the master Tim Burton.
843;the whole movie is beautiful and magical with it's simple settings and characters so real, that you feel you know them.
844;It leaves you with a special feeling, like all Tim Burton movies usually do.
845;johnny Depp shines again in this movie.
846;The perfect actor for this role.
847;trust me, this one's really good.
848;This is simply a beautiful film.
849;The cinematography, the quiet depth of Depp's performance, and the playful yet delicate touch of Burton's direction make EDWARD SCISSORHANDS a film both haunting and joyous.
850;If not, then congratulations, you're perfect.
851;director Burton, this film is a winner thanks to Depp's sensitive performance as a freaky, fragile creature with achingly human qualities.
852;attired, with a mane of wild, unkempt black hair, Depp is simply brilliant in his first big movie role.
853;So is the superlative supporting cast, including Ryder, Wiest, and horror maven Vincent Price, in his farewell role.
854;Edward Scissorhands is a quirky, endearing twist on the Frankenstein fable that feels cunningly contemporary.
855;Fanciful and funny with tragic overtones.
856;Acting is first rate and the scenics and costumes are hilarious spoofs on the pastel excesses of the fifties.
857;I found the film to be entertaining and at times raucously funny.
858;the story line is pure fantasy as the story of a young man who was created by a mad scientist who gave him multiple sets of scissors in place of hands.
859;The film is a masterful social commentary about racism and how it affects its victims.
860;if you notice all of the characters are white and all of the houses appear colorful.
861;Yet when he does speak his words reflect deep introspection and caring.
862;He sees the beauty in that 'other' world but no matter how hard he tries he just isn't accepted.
863;His true genius is that no reviewer yet has really seen the film for what it really is yet the majority recognize and are moved by its fundamental truths.
864;The film gets 5 stars.
865;He really dosen't speak much, but when he does, its very insightful.
866;He likes to wait in between.
867;If you loved it at the time, do yourself a favor and hold onto those memories and don't see it again no matter what you do.
868;I snuck into the theater to see it.
869;I love this film for its artistic and humorous look at the late sixties early seventies.
870;This is a great movie (probably Johnny Depps Best).
871;I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a splash of mysticism and romance in their viewing habits.
872;But in an incredibly delightful way.
873;Just the """"Avon lady"""" part is wonderful enough to make this movie premise crazy, but Burton did it."""
874;The combination of Edward's dark demeanor (it's almost as if he belongs in an actual black and white movie) with the colors of the houses and cars and outfits of the suburban people was wonderful and appreciative to the story.
875;johnny Deep proved long before any of his other movies that he is an excellent character actor.
876;His portrayal of Edward was subtle yet very touching.
877;I want to say cute .
878;Her chemistry with Johnny Depp was wonderful.
879;Depp's chemistry with Winona Ryder was also great.
880;And Vincent Price's last performance is found here.
881;In my most recent viewing of the film, it played a big part in almost each scene, and was orchastrated beautifully.
882;Edward Scissorhands won a place in movie history, and in my list of movies to love forever.
883;I can still remember when it was first released.
884;Well, it turns out it is another of Tim Burton's touching movies.
885;The very essence of Burton is in this film.
886;It's really worth watching it.
887;Johnny Depp also does an excellent job.
888;"I believe that Tim Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands"" is one of the director's finest moments and one of the best films ever made."
889;It starts as a charming fantasy and ends violently.
890;Which is exactly the way it should end, but it would be nice to see a happy ending.
891;The movie opens with an old woman telling her grandchild a story about the mansion on top of the hill, this is when we meet.
892;Her husband Bill (the always delightful Alan Arkin, 'Eros') and her son Kevin ask no questions and accept Edward.
893;Johnny Depp (one of my favorite actors) is fascinating, as always.
894;As in all his movies, he disappears into the role.
895;"All the actors are great
896;He's really great at creating his own little world.
897;But, keep in mind, definitely an aquired taste.
898;It's one of the most beautiful movies from an artistic and aesthetic point of view and from a story perspective.
899;It's a really great movie to watch for Christmas a magical film in keeping with the sprit, in story it's a mixture between Frankenstein and Beauty and the Beast.
900;it's an excellent movie and I love the relationship between Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder.
901;Such a cute couple in the film.
902;I still cant tell you my favorite Burton film and I own them all.
903;He has such a visual way of storytelling,he uses amazing sets and camera work.
904;what Edward Scissorhands showcases that few of Burtons movies do, is his creative writing ability.
905;Its very powerfull and a classic.
906;These features will be phenomenal.
907;I hope I can expect that soon.
908;She brings Edward home and Edward develops a vrush on her daughter Kim.
909;Part Fantasy Part Sweet Innocent Romance.
910;This is my favorite movie.
911;Edward Scissorhands is beautifully shot with a wonderful story line.
912;Everyone will love this movie.
913;it's one of Johnny Depp's best movies in my opinion.
914;If you love Johnny Depp's character acting in Pirates of the Caribbean, you will love this little Modern Day (Twisted) Fairy Tale .
915;Vincent Price also takes a charming, sentimental turn (in one of his last films) as Edward's Dad (creator).
916;And young Winnona Ryder is the perfect, sensitive every.
917;girl who wins Edwards heart.
918;it is a film the whole family can enjoy.
919;It was one of my son's favorites since he was 8 or 9 years old.
920;Ghoulish enough for the boys and sweet enough for the girls, Burton's twisted tale will stay with you long after you have watched it.
921;This film (Edward Scissorhands)was one of the best films directed by Tim Burton yet!
922;It contained all the perfect elements to make it as wonderful as it is.
923;This plot brings on a whole new world for edward to discover.
924;I got this for my daughter for Christmas gift.
925;She loves this movie and wanted to add it to her movie collection.
926;it is happy, sad, funny, romantic, and exciting.
927;being a huge fan of tim burton and having seen all his films, there is something about this movie that just stays with me.
928;it is truly wonderful and i hope that if you have not yet seen it, that you go out soon and make sure you do!
929;Edward Scissorhands is one of my all time favorites, especially because of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp who are both amazing.
930;It is my second favorite film (after Sleepy Hollow ), and the only film that makes me cry every time I see it.
931;it is so beautiful and sad.
932;well, what are you waiting for?!
933;This movie's a classic and is a family favorite.
934;Happy to have it in the collection.
935;This move is so good.
936;it is definitely one of my favorite movies ever.
937;It is an amazing movie and everybody should watch it at least once, or more like 14 times like me.
938;He has made such interesting movies in the past years among my favorites are: The Nightmare Before Christmas, Big Fish, and of course Edward Sissorhands.
939;It is a very sweet story about a young man who was made artificially but whose inventor died before completing him.
940;Edward expirences all human emotions: saddness, love, anger, pain and that is what the movie is about.
941;This is a great movie and tears always come to my eyes at the end when he did the ice sculpture of her in the attic.
942;This movie is Burton's masterpiece and it is easy to see why critics rave about his film making abilities.
943;The characters' costume, dialogue and such all lend to the unforgettable storyline.
944;i love how the menu starts.
945;great movie if you haven't seen it.
946;A lovely blend of comedy, fantasy, and romance with that Tim Burton touch that he's known for.
947;like creature in the middle of Suburbia (love the pastels!)
948;I think this is and probably will be the best movie Tim Burton creates.
949;I love Tim Burton's quirky spirit and his attention to surrounds, color and character concepts.
950;Now my 5 year old daughter loves it too.
951;That proves it's a great movie
952;After seeing this film, you will see why.
953;The supporting cast (especially Winona Rider and Dianne Wiest) are wonderful in this retrospective of 1950s suburbia.
954;One of the most touching fairy tale love story ever.
955;Depp and Wynona's chemistry are perfect.
956;The storyline is a little wierd but to an acceptable level and the elaborate setting gives the movie's dark but wonderful mood.
957;Definitely one of Tim Burton's better films.
958;What a wonderful mix of surreal characters and settings with a tender tale of unrequited love.
959;The juxtaposition sounds odd buts works remarkably well.
960;He was SO excited when he opened this gift!
961;Edward Scissorhands is a classic!
962;Fast delivery and in good condition.
963;I absolutely love this movie, and my son saw it for the first time today and he loved it too!!!!!
964;I am a huge Tim Burton fan, and love all of his movies and own them, have watched them at least 10 times each, and each one is really special to me (I know how dorky that sounds) but this is the one I am the most emotional about.
965;If I ever want to cry on demand, all I have to do is simply *remember* the last scene of the movie, and the last few lines uttered by the storyteller, and I tear up.
966;Just pulling up the image of Ryder, spinning around in the 'snow' dreamily, can still bring tears to my eyes 9 years later.
967;there's so many great things about this movie.
968;Tim Burton is a genius, plain and simple, and the art direction is brilliant.
969;His vision of suburbia is great, with rows and rows of identical, colorful 50's style tract houses and flawless green lawns.
970;Elfman does do his best work (other than Beetlejuice).
971;All the casting is great (Vincent Price, especially .
972;obviously, Tim Burton got his dream cast for this one).
973;(Starcrossed lovers always get to me).
974;This is a great movie!
975;Although this movie can be sad at times, there are plenty of funny scenes.
976;Johnny Depp is my favorite actor I greatly enjoy his movies and I saw Hotchicks long time ago with my daughter and loved it.
977;This wonderful fantasy tale stars Johnny Depp as a not.
978;diane Wiest is perfect as the ditsy and always.
979;Ryder is convincing as a selfish and spoiled teen.
980;Hall is the villian you love to hate.
981;The star, of course, is Johnny Depp.
982;wrenchingly delicate that you ache for him in every scene.
983;up and with only a few words of dialogue, Depp proves he is a very talented actor.
984;The wonderful and quite frail Vincent Price, as Edward's loving creator, will surely bring a tear to your eye.
985;this completely unique film blends comedy, fantasy, and romance to make a sentimental fairy tale that both teens and adults will enjoy.
986;This anniversary edition is super cool, has tons of footage and interviews from 80s and now.
987;awesome movie i loved it.
988;it was heartwarming and fun.
989;loved johnny as edward one of his best films.
990;One of Tim Burton's earlier films that showed the budding filmmaker's unique style and voice, Edward Scissorhands also featured a young Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder early in their careers.
991;The start of Johnny Depp's choice of quirky characters and collaboration with Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands told a story of a lonely boy born with scissors for hands.
992;Winona Ryder is pretty and sweet as the girl next door who befriends Edward.
993;day masterpiece succeeds beautifully at being both sharp comedy and achingly sad romance.
994;alike soon shows his talents for hedge and hair.
995;The imaginative set design and spellbinding story are both superb, but the real joys here are the performances, particularly from Depp.
996;Ten years on it is still one of his finest moments, in a movie that is certainly one of the best fantasy films ever made.
997;One of Burton's best, and also one of Elfman's finest musical efforts.
998;Depp is wonderfully understated and even Ryder comes off well, but Wiest is the real star here"
999;Arkin is also very funny, as is Baker.
1000;ray and bring Burton's vision all the way home.
1001;There's a whole lot of humor mixed with the pathos, a very tough combo to pull off.
1002;minimal budget made him work harder than he now has to, to splendid effect.
1003;"i saw this the week it came out and remember well how great it looked and felt then
1004;ray does that original experience full justice.
1005;A great movie and a great blu.
1006;It's the movie that counts, and ES shows how truly gifted and visionary Burton was, even at the start of his career.
1007;Highly recommended on every level.
1008;I enjoy vincent price movies and this one was his last one that he did.
1009;For years, Edward lived alone, in the castle atop a hill, until the day that society introduced itself to him in the form of a well.
1010;meaning and kindly hilarious Avon lady, who, seeing a cause in him, took him home to the strange and wonderful land of Suburbia.
1011;The score by Danny Elfman is one of, if not the, best he has ever done, and it too should be bought.
1012;Burton is a mad genius, we know that already, but the life and beauty he brings to this is impossibly heartbreaking, and the working chemistry betwen him and Depp is incredible .
1013;as is the chemistry between Depp and Ryder (which is, actually, very authentic .
1014;One interesting note is that this film makes me think immediatley of the song Weep For Jamie .
1015;And remember the magic that the first snow holds.
1016;Peace on earth, good will to all.
1017;the movie Edward Scissorhands is A Tim Burton's movie that succeeds beautifully at being both a sharp comedy and a sad romance.
1018;the movie is for the whole family and everyone how will watch it will be charmed by sweet sensitive Edward.
1019;i think that the movie is one of the most touching and beutiful movies i have ever seen.
1020;Johnny Depp is one of the best and most successful actores today.
1021;the movie is amazing and i recommend it to everyone.
1022;majesty: 7/10Execution: 9/10Taint: 0/10Total: 23Best features: Johnny Depp's acting, ice sculpting, water bed.
1023;Once in a great while, a movie will come along that truly touches our hearts.
1024;The messages and themes are so powerful and compelling.
1025;The music is so beautiful it cannot be described with the praise it deserves in my own words.
1026;This movie strikes a chord deep down that makes you realize how cruel society can be and how much power love has.
1027;But for more mature audiences, it truly is a masterpiece.
1028;line story ( There's this boy, he has scissors for hands. )
1029;This movie is a classic.
1030;I absolutely love all of his movies.
1031;One of my favorite movies of all time!
1032;Telling the story of an outcast learning to be accepted by society and of its dark side, it manages to balance the line between funny and touching without breaking into pathos.
1033;The whole cast is strong and it is notable that this was Vincent Price's last film role.
1034;Edward scissorhands is Johnny Depp at his finest.
1035;This is one of my favorites and it's the perfect gift to give!Quick and painless transaction.
1036;This movie is a classic.
1037;Introduced it to my seven year old daughter and she loved it so much she decided to be him for Halloween!
1038;Great message in this movie!
1039;It is a gift so I do not know if it works good.
1040;But just getting it will make her happy!
1041;I like the movie,but you have to have a good imagination to watch it and understand alot of the stupidity of it .
1042;Kind of difficult to livewith scissors for hands but he makes it look easy and a lots ofpeople happy.
1043;We are fans of Johnny Depp and our children wanted to know more of what he had been in.
1044;Well, needless to say they love this movie just as much as we do.
1045;please movie goer, so I kept waiting to like this movie.
1046;This is a truly mysical film.
1047;It will blow you away with its amazing atmosphere, and haunt you for years to come.
1048;I mean God, it really is an amazing movie.
1049;Edward Scissorhands, is one of the films that really move you and makes you think.
1050;I loved Edward , the main character, and Kim his love interest.
1051;Diane Weist is also a beaultiful and talented actress.
1052;It starts out amazing, the cute small 60's looking town , and a happy motherly Pegg Boggs , take him in like a son, and as sometimes in reality everything goes awry and Edward is chased out of town and hunted down.
1053;I always found it amazing that at the tv show with John Davidson, who is a very good actor, and show host, all the women in the audience love Edward and one older woman klnows a doctor who can help him , and Peg mentions she knows a doctor who could help , but they never get around to getting him to a doctoror visit him again.
1054;It was wonderful seeing Vincent Price, he played the part of Edward's inventor like no other could.
1055;With real sheer genious and humanity .
1056;A great love story between Edward and Kim, really sweet, innocent and true love.
1057;A film that really offers a lot.
1058;Tim Burton's movies can at times be hit or miss, but Edward Scissorhands is absolutely one of his best and just a fantastic film in general.
1059;Touching, cute, adorable, hilarious are just some terms that can be used to describe this wonderful film.
1060;this film is great fun for the entire family, and if you want to just relax and kick back, and suspend reality, this is the movie for you.
1061;Loved this movie when it was first released.
1062;Tim Burton brings to life a rare combination of elements that create a wonderfully poignant story that brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it.
1063;On the surface the story is the tale of Edward Scissorhands, created by inventor Vincent Price in one of his greatest roles.
1064;Instead, Tim Burton creates a beautiful fairy tale set in an idealized suburbia of the 50s.
1065;At first Tim Burton indicates that his suburban neighborhood is perfect and the epitome of the """"middle class way."""""""
1066;in the midst of the irony, Edward and Kim Boggs develop an innocent and beautiful love for each other.
1067;Edward represents innocence, beauty, and perhaps the potential we all have.
1068;Kim sees all this, and wants it, and her decision becomes the ironic capstone of this story.
1069;The contrast between the world as we think it should be, and the world as it could be, will always provide fodder for our art.
1070;In this case Tim took that fodder and created cinematic and emotional gold.
1071;It has an amazing story and a great make up for Edward.
1072;What can I say it's a masterpiece of his movies and I hope he continues his work and new movies with same wow.
1073;I did thuroughly enjoy it though, it truely is a great little classic Burton film in all apspects of those words.
1074;Tim Burton's wild imagination is evident, and the setting and make.
1075;peg Bogs the Avon lady brings him home to her family .
1076;this takes a leap of faith to believe.
1077;Edward Scissorhands is and has been one of my favorite movies.
1078;that said, this film is one of my favorites.
1079;I have always liked the oddity of Tim Burton's work (with the exception of Sweeney Todd, but I never like that musical anyways) and this is one of his early showcases of said odd work.
1080;I loved this movie as a child, and can still watch it and be amused.
1081;A good deal of the styling is obviously that of the late 80's and early 90's, but this can be said for many films of the time.
1082;Great movie, great price, came speedily (and loved the free Amazon OnDemand viewing that came with it .
1083;Have always liked this movie.
1084;Johnny Depp does a great job.
1085;like look of this amazing film.
1086;This has recently become my number one all time favorite movie.
1087;This movie captures the essence of innocence and cruelty.
1088;tim Burton, the best director ever, (look for his other films) creates the perfect cast, setting, and plot in this movie.
1089;The soundtrack by Danny Elfman,( look for the soundtrack) creates the most beautiful music ever in a movie.
1090;this is the most touching, sweetest, and the most beautiful fairy tale ever.
1091;This is a captivating tale of romance, comedy, and drama.
1092;Just think, a story of someone who loves and is so gentle on the inside, but has sharp knives on the outside.
1093;Of all the movies I have ever seen, I recommend this the most.
1094;I have always loved this movie and watch it every Christmas.
1095;I can relate to the depiction of the era and the characters are endearing.
1096;The music is wonderful and it even comes with a moral fabric.
1097;It just makes me smile.
1098;If anyone out there can find a movie that has a more atmospheric theme than Edward Scissorhands , then you've done a pretty good job.
1099;This movie is great overall, but the music really is quite exeptional.
1100;You may think the music doesn't matter all that much, but this fairy tale movie needed a great theme to compliment the great footage and story, and that's just what Danny Elfman composed for it.
1101;The movie has so many amazing scenes: The opening scene with the gothic castle in which Edward lives, the scene where Edward is made, the ending .
1102;Again, I must comment on the music: The theme is haunting, enchanting .
1103;This is my favorite movie in all of Tim Burton's classic horror/gothic/fantasy films.
1104;Also, I find that every single person in this whole movie has something unique about them.
1105;It has a lot of comedy, such as Edward's reactions to their 1950s style life.
1106;It also has some romance, in a slightly forbidden and unlikely manner.
1107;placed action sequences just when the tension builds up.
1108;The real reason I enjoy this movie is how creative, origional, and uncanny it is.
1109;What about the dark, brooding side of the story, when, you really feel for Edward, and then the pleasant tingling you feel in your body when the cheerful, colorful scenes come in?
1110;My favorite composer for movie scores and winner of multiple Academy Awards, he really brings life into this movie.
1111;If it helps, he composed the music to Batman, Batman Returns, Big Fish, Spider.
1112;This is a very creative movie that my 6 year old enjoyed.
1113;i would recommend this movie.
1114;This movie is proof that a title will sell a movie.
1115;What surprised me is that while I was wrapping presents, I found I didn't accomplish much, because this movie was really, really good!
1116;The cast was well chosen, the plot a complete surprise, and it is one I would replace if the first were to disappear, like most of my movies.
1117;I've loved this movie since I was a kid and the Blu.
1118;ray just makes it come alive.
1119;Now, I can say with confidence Tim Burton has my respect and admiration and is definitely my favorite storyteller.
1120;edward Scissorhands, in retrospective, brings to the forefront some elements that modern society and us as humans are so full of.
1121;edward Scissorhands is, quite simply, a classic that will stand the test of time, as it has so far.
1122;Fifteen years after its making (at the time of this writing), it is as fresh and packed with lessons as it was back in 1990.
1123;As you may notice Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands is his best and finest work.
1124;Johnny Depp's enchanting performance, Winona Ryder's beuty and Dianne Weiss sense of perfection.
1125;it's definitely a modern fairy tale that teach us all a valuable lesson.
1126;if you are going to see a movie this year, watch Edward Scissorhands!
1127;The fairy tale epilogue, which explains the origin of snow in pastel Suburbia, is cute though.
1128;THIS is the perfect metaphor for the role/function of the artist is society.
1129;The ending is bittersweet as some of those living in their look.
1130;I love this film, one of my top 5 of all time.
1131;A must see film for everybody, yes it's odd, quirky + off.
1132;beat but it's humour and heart and also undeniable.
1133;The Blu Ray edition of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is a must have for all the fans of this beautifull film, and wathing in high def it looks like it was film 3 years ago, the qualitty of the image is perfect.
1134;The picture and music score are fabulous !
1135;A wondeful gift for christmas.
1136;I told him that it's a classic.
1137;As a fable it still holds up well after all these years.
1138;The director's vision is unique.
1139;I love this movie and I love Johnny Depp!!
1140;Tim Burton is a genius when it comes to making movies
1141;My daughter is a huge Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fan and wanted a copy of this movie.
1142;She watched it yesterday and loved it.
1143;Product came promptly, packaged well, and in perfect condition.
1144;My fiance loved the movie.
1145;One of the movies that serves as a cornerstone for Tim Burton's career, this fairy tale has all of the right elements in all of the right proportions.
1146;The suburban wasteland that surrounds Edward is properly grotesque, and the character is wonderfully nave and sympathetic.
1147;The bittersweet ending works fairly well, although it seems to emphasize Winona over Depp a little too much for my tastes.
1148;Edward Scissorhands is Tim Burton's classic modern fairy tale that features not only some of the director's best work, but a great cast (including Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Diane Weist, and Vincent Price), and a fantastic score by Danny Elfman.
1149;In a quirk of fate, he is eventually discovered by an over.
1150;edward Scissorhands is a classic tale of fantasy and love, hope and sorrow.
1151;Tim Burton gives us a truly caring and sympathetic character in Edward.
1152;edward Scissorhands is a fun and entertaining film that I highly recommend.
1153;Edward Scissorhands is such an elaborately thought out film with such simple themes .
1154;This film has so many emotions packed onto one little disc!
1155;It ranges from hilarious to dark, beautiful to tragic.
1156;Amazing acting from Depp, Ryder, and especially Weist make it even more spectacular.
1157;I placed my order and received my video a couple days after they were fast and plastic was still on the product.
1158;Another Tim Burton classic now on blu ray!
1159;This truly is an incredible and memorable film.
1160;I saw it when I was a kid, and then again as an adult, and I appreciated it as much .
1161;The storyline might be a bit weird for some, but it really is an awesome and poignant film with good writing and acting.
1162;I definitely think Tim based a lot of Edward on himself, including looks.
1163;i love Johnny Depp movies, and I reckon there's only a couple that I've seen and not liked.
1164;This is one of his movies, a career.
1165;Along with Benny and Joon, this was Johnny trying to be an old silent movie star, and he does it very well indeed.
1166;And the scissors for hands must have been so much fun to work with!
1167;Tim Burton has never been one for telling believeable stories as he has exciting, mythical fables.
1168;there's some terrific funny moments in this, showing off Johnny's comedic side to the viewing audience.
1169;Particularly the scenes with the waterbed (I love the look he gives the clown lying beside him!)
1170;The music in the film goes totally unnoticed, and in my case, it has more of an effect on me that way.
1171;watchable, and gives you a warm and gooey feeling inside.
1172;The film is about a machine like a human and a family.
1173;The film is a kind of tragicomedy, because you can laugh in some scenes and feel sad in the other ones.
1174;I think director is successful, because while you are watching film you wonder what will happen next.
1175;And it makes you to think about the film.
1176;This is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again with out getting sick of it.
1177;Grew up watching it and still love it to this day!
1178;Yes it did I was waiting for to come in the mail for so long and then I open it wait when I got it and watch it right then and there
1179;In this film I realised that some people who don't act normally in the society could be loved by someone who is normal.
1180;He realise the real face of his friends.
1181;Finally,this film was in general_looking interesting with the scenes of the grasses or the statue of the girl from ice, and can be enjoyed by both fantasy lovers and non_fantasy lovers alike.
1182;Tim Burton is an amazing director.
1183;Through interesting uses of color, cinematography, characters and stories, he captures the imaginations of the audience and keeps them fully engaged throughout the duration of the vast majority of his films.
1184;"century films) and Carlo Collodi's (1826.1890) novel ""Pinocchio"" (which has also inspired many a twentieth."
1185;screen film) transformed these original stories into a touching modern interpretation about an inventor (Vincent Price, 1911.1993) who decides to transform one of his assembly.
1186;Below the hilltop upon which the inventor's castle stands is a modern suburban residential area.
1187;Their wives stay at home taking care of their colorful homes and children, as well as share interesting gossip about their neighbors.
1188;One housewife, Peg (Dianne Wiest), also works as a door.
1189;She walks into the castle and comes across Edward.
1190;Seeing how he constantly cuts himself with his scissor.
1191;In the meantime, Edward begins to transform their yard into the same immaculate garden with amazing shapes as at the castle.
1192;He then also transforms the yards throughout the neighborhood similarly, before starting to trim dogs' fur and eventually, the housewives' hair.
1193;Edward begins to fall in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), but Kim's boyfriend, Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), becomes jealous.
1194;Also noteworthy is Police Officer Allen (Dick Anthony Williams).
1195;"With an engaging story, wonderful characters, brilliant direction and wonderful acting, I rate ""Edward Scissorhands"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it."
1196;This Tim Burton masterpiece is the fairytale of a man born in human likeness with human emotions and feelings.
1197;He lived most of his life on a hill in a deserted mansion off the suburbs of a utopian town.
1198;He is discovered by a generous and loving woman who takes him into her house and adopts him as one of the family.
1199;sweet movie brings up many philosophical questions for those seeking a deep underlying message (questions e. g. ethics, aesthetics and morality).
1200;its visions are spectacular and wild.
1201;its characters are wild and spectacular, well you get my drift.
1202;Burton creates the world of Edward around him and inside of him.
1203;one of Depp's best no doubt.
1204;On my second viewing of Tim Burton's dark fable, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS made a stronger impression and it stands as one of, if not the best, of Burton's films.
1205;An atmospherically gorgeous film, it tells the story of a would be Pinocchio, whose maker doesn't get to give him hands before he dies.
1206;Vincent Price in his last role is hauntingly charming as the Inventor.
1207;Johnny Depp brings a tremendous amount of innocence, loss, and fascination in this extremely difficult role.
1208;Depp has proven to be one of our finest young actors and this is one of his finest roles.
1209;"Witness Depp as he ferociously makes his topiaries
1210;Ryder is genuinely astonishing as the young girl who Edward falls for, and with her radiant performance, Winona proves herself to be a formidable screen presence.
1211;The cookie cutter suburban existence is captured beautifully in the pastel houses and in the empty personas of the people who live in them.
1212;Dianne Wiest is marvelous as the Avon lady who brings Edward down from his castle home"
1213;EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is a visually hypnotizing film, and one with lots of heart in its story.
1214;A truly classic fable for our times.
1215;Every director probably has one movie that he pours part of himself into.
1216;Here, Tim Burton poured into the soul of Edward Scissorhands the world of an outsider, a creation of an old inventor (wonderfully played by Vincent Price) who passes on before he can finish Edward(wonderfully played by Johnny Depp).
1217;Danny Elfman delivers probably his most moving score in this picture.
1218;But most of the time I found myself wondering when they would speak again.
1219;The only cool notable is the interactive menu, made like a pop.
1220;If you are into those that promise incredible extra features, pass this one up.
1221;If you love Johnny Depp it's a must see.
1222;Stand the test of time wonderfully .
1223;My fav movie as a kid, and now my kids are enjoying it.
1224;Edward Scissorhands was a piece of my childhood remains as a favorite film to me to this day.
1225;This movie is pure genius, to say the least.
1226;with a perfectly picked cast, especially Johnny Depp his eyes that do a lot of the acting, the emotion feeling behind the movie equipped with a heart wrenching sound track.
1227;The story line is absolutely beautiful, this movie is a must see for people who apreciate art in the form of film.
1228;This one and IT are her favorite movies
1229;This movie makes it easy to fall in love with the main character, Edward, played marvelously by Johnny Depp, who is one of my favorite actors.
1230;Winona Rider is great too, and combined with Tim Burton's brilliance makes one heck of a movie.
1231;The music is by Danny Elfman, and it fits wonderfully and highlights the many poignant and emotional moments in the film.
1232;Parts of this movie bring a tear to my eye.
1233;This is not a new movie and I've seen it many times, but I enjoyed sharing it with my daughters who love Johnny Depp and Tim Burton films.
1234;This is one of my favorite movies.
1235;Johnny Depp is great as Edward.
1236;The movie gets very funny at some times.
1237;The end is creepy, exciting and a bit sad.
1238;I really do love this movie.
1239;I love Johnny Depp and think he's such a wonderful actor.
1240;This movie is magical and amazing.
1241;The Contrast with bright colors were good, Skin tones were decent, dark scenes had a grainy film to it.
1242;all in all, i've always loved the movie.
1243;The reason being that it is without a doubt the most tear worthy film ever made.
1244;Johnny Depp is wonderful as usual as the poor Edward, inspiring sympathy in even the most cold hearted viewer.
1245;a truly, inspiring, wonderful film.
1246;I am a huge Tim Burton fan.
1247;I have always loved the vast atmospheres that Burton always has the audience experience.
1248;At first everyone loves Edward, then the town begins to turn against him.
1249;Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but I prefer the atmosphere and mood of Sleepy Hollow better.
1250;I recommend seeing both of these well told Burton tales.
1251;I always cried when i watched this, and there were some very romantic parts between winona ryder and johnny depp.
1252;hands, but the neighborhood welcome him as if everything is natural.
1253;He easily get used to the social life.
1254;except the girl he is in love with(Winona Ryder).
1255;In fact, this film is a kind of love story with messages for viewers.
1256;The whole story is told in a surrealistic form which I think is more effective.
1257;Having some question marks in my mind.
1258;This movie is the most wonderful blend of fairy tale elements I've ever seen.
1259;Tim Burton is a genius.
1260;The scenery in this film is beautiful, the acting is fantastic, and the story is heartbreaking.
1261;You will love it, I promise.
1262;Edward Scissorhands is a typical Burton film in its originality and is probably one of the best he has made to date.
1263;For years he lives alone in an old house on top of a hill.
1264;initially all goes well as his 'novelty' appeals to the locals who flock round to have their hair cut or hedges made into fantastic shapes by the wonderfully artistic Edward.
1265;edward is brilliantly portrayed by Johnny Depp who demonstrates a tremendous ability to show his thoughts and emotions without speaking.
1266;this film is a magical fairytale for adults and will make you laugh and cry in equal amounts.
1267;Johnny and Winona do a superb job.
1268;Tim Burton once again makes a fantastic movie made for the whole family
1269;Tim Burton has done a great job in making a movie.
1270;The movie Edward Scissorhands has great plot movement as well as a good sense of anger, sadness, and lost love.
1271;Other than that, this is a really good family movie.
1272;But as I watch a little more I noticed that this film was a really excellent film, which is full of psychology.
1273;After she brought him to her house the neighbors loved him.
1274;Also he loved everybody especially the young girl.
1275;Only the girl was frightened when she saw him, but she loved him very fast, too.
1276;There was also comedy in the film.
1277;I think the scenes, which Edward was cutting the neighbors' hair, were only for fun.
1278;The scene in which the friends of the girl make Edward a thief was very strong.
1279;Finally I think the design was actually good.
1280;I can watch it several times.
1281;Johnny Depp's character is so unique, yet lovable.
1282;Tim Burton is a genius, he's created yet another timeless film.
1283;Time and time again this movie is just pure joy.
1284;Its like comfort food to me.
1285;"This film touches your heart and soul in a sweet way
1286;Johnny Depp did a phenomenal job playing the part of Edward Scissorhands.
1287;( Fun Fact: This was the great Vincent Prices' last film before he passed :/).
1288;The story takes you on a journey through suburbia and this sweet little lady who rescues Edward from the ruins of the castle and tries to bring him into society.
1289;At first Edward has a hard time adjusting, especially since he has scissors as hands but he soon adjusts to using them and does great things with his hands .
1290;He builds masterpieces out of bushes and trees and decorates the entire neighborhood he lives in.
1291;He also starts cutting peoples hair and also the pets of the small town.
1292;Danny Elfman does the music for this film as he usually does for almost all Tim Burton films and it is so perfect and fitting.
1293;All in all this movie is just fantastic!
1294;A bit of a nastaliac feeling everytime I watch it!
1295;'Edward Scissorhands' is a work of visual excellence and stylistic beauty that can scarcely be described in writing.
1296;Director Tim Burton soars past the brilliance of his other films to bring us this touching story of a man created by an inventor and raised in isolation from the surrounding town.
1297;identical houses painted in a narrow, but bright palette of colors, and 1950s.
1298;tale film is not only a work of art to rival some of the painted masterpieces of the world"
1299;Danny Elfman helps this film incalculably with his original score which compliments the film perfectly and only adds to the overall magnificence of the picture.
1300;Remarkable performances from Johnny Depp, Winona Rider, and Dianne Wiest are utterly flawless and a tribute to the skill of the actors themselves.
1301;Tim Burton combines a soundtrack which can only be adequately described as whimsical, performers who could scarcely have more perfectly cast in their roles, visual effects which are absolutely stunning, and Burton's own amazing style of film.
1302;making, 'Edward 'Scissorhands is not only a glimmering jewel in the career of Tim Burton, but a film worthy of a place in the list of the best films ever made.
1303;Great classic movie with a good underlying message.
1304;Edward scissorhands is a great movie the acting is wonderful and it is a very good movie would not recommend to the very young as it might scare them
1305;This is a great film.
1306;Like commentary by Johnny deep and Tim Burton.
1307;i bought as part of christmas gift so i havent opened it yet.
1308;Love this movie, but the Blu.
1309;Edward Scissorhands stands as Burton's most sincere and striking films to date.
1310;He goes far beyond the screen in this work however, into creating a mythic cycle for the youth cultures of 90's and on.
1311;His focus on the outsider motif and archetype is extremely clear and vividly portrayed, set on a story that is at times both whimsical and filled with an existential fury.
1312;Edward has become a powerful symbol in the minds of those youths lucky enough to view this film during the turbulent time of adolescence this film portrays.
1313;don't let the symbolism get to you though, its a wonderful movie in itself, which is the true test of artistic integrity.
1314;Once upon a time in a castle high on a hill lived an inventor whose greatest creation was named Edward.
1315;Edward Scissorhands is a masterful piece of work.
1316;The screenplay itself was pretty well.
1317;written, but Burton did a perfect job in directing the world and Danny Elman composed a musical score that is a wondrous work of art on its own and lends a beautiful touch to the film.
1318;The actors seem to have been made for the roles they inhabit, creating one of my favorite movies of all time.
1319;He wins the heart of Peg's daughter, but earns the ire of her slimeball boyfriend.
1320;burton does an excellent job in showing the contrast between Edward's dark world and the bright pastel suburbia.
1321;He keeps the pacing going at all the right moments.
1322;He knows exactly which parts are funny, moving, and saddening, and he portrays them perfectly.
1323;Johnny Depp, known for his acting in kooky roles, plays the childlike innocence of Edward to the letter, and the other actors do a great job of playing their own unique personalities.
1324;Danny Elfman's musical score sets the mood for each scene and compliments the film beautifully.
1325;It sets a perfect stage for showing how poor, innocent Edward cannot fit in a society that preys on innocence.
1326;The colorful suburban neighborhood seems like the American Dream, but this movie masterfully shows the corruptness of it's denizens and the dark rivers of ignorance that flow beneath it.
1327;The love story is actually believable and the ending will make you cry, regardless of how big or tough a guy you may be.
1328;This film is definately worth owning.
1329;This is a great film, and it's a shame Hollywood can't make more like this.
1330;I do give in props from being a stunning visual spectacle, but that's just about it.
1331;The suburbanites were funny and how society tends to lift things up only to tear them down was a nice touch.
1332;Still, overall I thought it was just okay.
1333;This movie made me feel like I was discovering new emotions or something, lol.
1334;The situations he's put in are sometimes sad, most of the time funny though, see that's what also is good about this movie, lots of comic relief, so it isn't nothing but sad sad sad, it's also just a beautiful movie, the music is so amazing, and the character's are beautiful (not literally, i mean.
1335;they were all just the perfect fit for the movie.)
1336;I love this movie though, lol.
1337;It's so beautiful and funny and sad, it's almost the perfect movie, it may already be just that.
1338;but both are wonderful movies for the avid fan.
1339;His eyes and facial expressions do wonders for this film.
1340;The casting is excellent and all actors and actresses shine.
1341;A great film for all ages.
1342;Truly, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is a wonderful, beautiful movie.
1343;It has excitement and drama, laughter and true love.
1344;Good acting and believable dialogue, fine direction and movie music, and other production values also show the excellence of this movie, and its justly.
1345;reviewers, amateur or professional, seem to have discovered about this movie.
1346;it is a totally, and wonderously beautiful one.
1347;Yet the parallels are SO obvious, it's amazing to me that, if they have been discovered by others, that they haven't been more widely discussed.
1348;And who can be more brilliant than God (the Father), Himself?
1349;"edward is soon ""brought into"" (!)"
1350;probably to show that The Virgin Mary is a figure that belongs to the entire world.
1351;"has acted in the play ""The Dybbuk"", and has made many films with Woody Allen."
1352;The Virgin Mary is goodness personified .
1353;Also part of the family is the beautiful Kim, played by Winona Ryder, (also of Jewish birth).
1354;"Here, the name ""Kim"" is given, and it means ""Regal Hill"", in the English derivation, and ""Golden"", in the Vietnamese derivation."
1355;"Also, ""Kim"" is a name given to both girls and boys."
1356;represents both humanity at large, (whom Jesus loved deeply), and also the Church which grew from Jesus' teachings, (which Jesus also loved.
1357;drum hedges into beautiful images of people, places and things could, I think, easily draw a parallel to Jesus' first miracle .
1358;(As could his appearance at the young son of the family's school, where he turns paper into wonderfully elaborate paper dolls!)
1359;"This draws a parallel to the ""temptations of the flesh"" that Jesus was tempted by, as well."
1360;He also helps the young son of the family when the little boy is injured.
1361;He returns to the castle.
1362;like fortress, high on a hill, where he was first created.
1363;was it Tim Burton's purpose to create a modern semi.
1364;in the truly loving and beautiful way it was done .
1365;She was very pleased to receive it.
1366;year old review that I believe perfectly captures the strong flow of emotions that one can be left with after viewing this remarkable movie.
1367;If I ever want to cry on demand, all I have to do is simply *remember* the last scene of the movie, and the last few lines uttered by the storyteller, and I tear up.
1368;Just pulling up the image of Ryder, spinning around in the 'snow' dreamily, can still bring tears to my eyes 9 years later.
1369;there's so many great things about this movie.
1370;Tim Burton is a genius, plain and simple, and the art direction is brilliant.
1371;His vision of suburbia is great, with rows and rows of identical, colorful 50's style tract houses and flawless green lawns.
1372;Elfman does do his best work (other than Beetlejuice).
1373;All the casting is great (Vincent Price, especially .
1374;obviously, Tim Burton got his dream cast for this one).
1375;(Starcrossed lovers always get to me).
1376;Really obscure, Tim Burton really outdoes himself.
1377;This is truly a modern fairy tale.
1378;a sad and moving story that is a timeless classic!
1379;Great sytlized sets and charactors.
1380;great acting and the last appearance of Vincent Price on the silver screen!
1381;Edward, the creation of a kindly genius who dies before he can complete his creature, has sharp metal shears instead of fingers.
1382;I saw this wonderful movie in 1990 when it first came out.
1383;It just hit me right in the heart, in the most vulnerable, deepest part of my soul.
1384;I've been in more than my share of fistfights, ride a Harley, and love guns, power tools, and anything that explodes.
1385;Which is exactly what we both proceeded to do, right there in front of the theatre.
1386;We held each other and sobbed.
1387;And I felt closer to her than I had in a long time.
1388;Thank you, Tim Burton, for that moment.
1389;Watched it with my 13 year old daughter, at her request.
1390;Depp is at his quirky best.
1391;First class entertainment, although my personal preference would have been for a happier ending.
1392;This is a wonderful and quirky movie staring Johnny Depp.
1393;My wife and I watched the original and we bought this in 2010 and still watch it every now and then.
1394;Love it, love it, love it.
1395;The love and compasion it's beyond my expectation.
1396;I am embarrassed to admit that this film is still one of my favorite Christmas works.
1397;"It is more than a teenage love story
1398;It is these miscarriages that propel their desire for perfection, they perfect in their art what they lack in their heart.
1399;it's dreamy and sad and poigant!
1400;1990: Tim Burton's introverted film is touching and tragic.
1401;The music by Danny Elfman is appropriately haunting and the acting is even Oscar worthy.
1402;Edward Scissorhands is a great commentary on outsiders, foreigners and people who are not mainstream.
1403;edward is the invention of an eccentric, lonely scientist (played by Vincent Price) who lives in a Gothic castle which looms on a great hill over a small, suburban 50's idealistic town.
1404;He begins to win people's affections at first, especially because he has great talent with his scissor, especially making lawn statuary and great haircuts.
1405;The modern fairty tale is moving, appropriately scored by Danny Elfman's chilling, haunting and romantic style of composition.
1406;This film is worth watching and worthy even of some Oscars.
1407;That year, Silence Of The Lambs or Misery won the Best Picture.
1408;Thank you for the item.
1409;i love this film!Hope to do more business soon, thanks again.
1410;This is a great film, mostly because it is a fantasy and borders on reality so harshly and truthfully.
1411;This is a genuinely moving film, with great acting, incredible production design, and, best of all, music.
1412;Elfman's score is so gorgeous and intense, bringing out the innocence in Edward and the cynicism in society.
1413;This is an extremely emotional film, not because of the grand facade, but for the smaller moments.
1414;At first funny, then mocking, then downright serious and tragic, this film in the end helps us all discover the more unusual side to our natures.
1415;The grand finale just helps to bring out what we are supposed to be as separate human beings.
1416;I saw Edward Scissorhands when I was twelve years old,and fell in love with the originality, beauty,and artistry of the story.
1417;tim Burton and Caroline Thompson did a great job with this movie,and the acting(mainly Depp and Ryder) was superb.
1418;watch for hearts and cookies"
1419;Also, the contrasts between what is arguably the world's most perfect neighborhood and the castle and Edward are dramatic, and highlight the character's desire(and failure) to belong in a colorful world of happiness and heartache.
1420;She takes him home and shows him to her family.
1421;So then, Edward makes plant sculptures, haircuts, and is appreciated everywhere.
1422;"And his weird haircuts and personality totally just keep you thinking ""He's so cool!"
1423;This movie is one that has and will change lives for the rest of time.
1424;Edward played by Johnny Depp, in my opinion his best performance to date, is captivating and enthralling.
1425;worthy performance in this unforgetable masterpiece, by the master of Film.
1426;magic, director Tim Burton, what more can I say, this movie will surely not be going anyplace.
1427;Burton and Elfman have completely outdone themselves in a monument of a cinamatic masterpiece.
1428;Surrealism, drama, true love,heartbreaking music, and flat out reality is perfectly combined into a film that satisfies the strange person in all of us.
1429;Better yet, its actually a GOOD kind of strange.
1430;It's the only movie that can really make me cry, and I'd recommend it to anyone, any age.
1431;Order the film and the soundtrack and you'll be the happiest person on the face of this planet.
1432;and more importantly, the power of true love.
1433;Anything with Johnny Depp in it is glorious, of course, but add Tim Burton and you always have the ultimate great movie.
1434;Loved this film with all of its uniquness, beauty and charm.
1435;My kids love it, too.
1436;He would be a great friend to me.
1437;I really love everything about this movie.
1438;This is my favorite movie from Tim Burton.
1439;socialized after living alone for most of his life, is eager to please everyone he meets, and because of this falls in with a bad crowd.
1440;top supernatural wackiness that was Beetlejuice, the world of Edward Scissorhands seems downright normal.
1441;"the genius of Tim Burton's artistry, and the reason his movies are almost guaranteed hits, is that his vision is so far left of center that ""left"" no longer becomes a valid aspect
1442;best lists, and he's directed a handful of bona fide modern classics, including Edward Scissorhands.
1443;His vision is complemented with fantastic camerawork, top.
1444;notch sound, excellent acting from the entire cast, and a message that's evident without being terribly overdone.
1445;A wonderful movie all around.
1446;This is a Great Movie.
1447;Wife and I really enjoyed watching Johnny Depp in his early acting career.
1448;Edward a wonderfully innocent young man, misunderstood yet kind in every way.
1449;Great story of Loving people for who they are.
1450;The setting is fantastic a mid.
1451;In this film, Johnny Depp is a bit more gentle.
1452;Peg Boggs brings him home and so begins his adventure.
1453;My almost.15 daughter *loves* the movie.
1454;By the middle of the movie, she was riveted, and afterwards dramatically said, I feel *every* emotion in my sternum.
1455;johnny Depp has always been definatly one of my favorite actors because he puts so much passion into them.
1456;This was his first movie with Tim Burton and how he met Wynonia, he is a gifted actor and now the public knows he exist.
1457;I saw this years ago but it is definitely worth repeating.
1458;It leads you to an amazing character, non human in his hands but very human in his heart.
1459;Burton grabs you and holds you throughout.
1460;Accolades to a brilliant creator!
1461;As Tim Burton's first movie that he directed and wrote, he did a fantastic job with this 1990 masterpiece.
1462;He is taken home one day by a makeup saleswoman (Dianne Wiest), who lives in a colorful and """"perfect"""" surburban neighborhood."""
1463;The population, mostly the housewives, grow to love him as one of their own.
1464;this film gets 5 stars, for making me cry and love such a creature.
1465;This wildly imaginative movie is Tim Burton's best, because it seems to be completely real to him as a filmmaker.
1466;From the gorgeous opening credits, set to Danny Elfman's candy.
1467;coated but melancholy musical score, to the swirling finale, this movie captivates, amuses and stirs the heart.
1468;"Johnny Depp is exceptional in a role that might have been slapstick with no heart
1469;Dianne Weist is also that perfect balance of cartoon and real human"
1470;This movie has some insightful and warmly realized messages to convey as well.
1471;"Look for Vincent Price in a perfect final role
1472;Most of all, though, this movie has a Christmas heart, and the sweetnees in its innocent romance, its sad story of misfits, and its pop.
1473;A young man comes to town who instead of hands has scissors, you can then imagine how difficult can it be for this guy to express himself with this physical """"limitation"""", the metaphor Burton uses in this character is simply beautiful and the story and the turns it takes have made it the classic it is considered today."""
1474;"Filled with classical Burton visuals and humor (there's a part of the film in which we get to listen Tom Jones' ""With these hands"" while a woman tries to seduce Edward) it is a compelling love story with an ending that will break your heart."
1475;As an added value we now have the beautiful white tin case and 6 postcards with pictures from the film in a very nice envelope.
1476;Edward Scissorhands is the archetypical tale of transformation, and of the transforming power of love.
1477;The young man discovers he has the capacity for love as well as the hate love can generate.
1478;His love for the woman's beautiful teen daughter, Kim, flowers.
1479;As their love painfully progresses, they mature, she from a somewhat self.
1480;The transforming power of the love he has for Kim manifests itself in his art, in the explosive beauty of his ice sculptures, and the attending snow flakes he produces as he carves the forms he cares for.
1481;Kim, for her part, is transformed into an elegant ballerina as she dances thru the falling snow.
1482;In the end, the suburban community rejects his presence, primarily because he cannot be formed into its image.
1483;The love between Kim and him is sustained in a timeless manner as is revealed at the beginning and end of the tale.
1484;If anything is incomplete, it is this: this wonderful tale demands a sequel where Kim's granddaughter, introduced at the beginning of the film, matures into her 30s and becomes a New York CEO.
1485;In defiance of her scepticism and disillusionment over her hometown's narrowmindedness and gossipy proclivities, one of the reasons for her departure to New York, she returns to seek Edward in the castle, seeking the truth of his existence and should he exist, to help him if she can.
1486;She wishes to confirm to him her deceased grandmother's love for him, as revealed in a secret diary.
1487;She replies that she doesn't know, but that if he does, she is sure he will see Kim again.
1488;The expert in an attempt to be of some help succeeds in this endeavor.
1489;Moved to tears, she begins to dance as her grandmother once did.
1490;She immediately decides to quite her job, to remain and convert the castle overlooking the community into an art museum in memory of her Grandmother and Edward.
1491;This is one of my all time favorite films!
1492;This is also Depp at his best.
1493;the cinematography and soundtrack are both superb!
1494;For all those people out there who didnt understand this movie because it was too stupid , it is about true love, being able to love someone inspite of their physical apperiance.
1495;Personally I thought this was one of Tim Burton's best films.
1496;It was touching, funny, and heart.
1497;who brings curiousity and in a way adventure to the town.
1498;The first time I saw this movie I was about six years old, and since then i thought this was an incredible film.
1499;If you want to watch a truly touching cinimatic peice, Edward Scissor hands is for you!
1500;I love this movie, it is one of my favorite movies of all time.
1501;This film takes a Hunchback of Notre Dame approach with a Tim Burton twist.
1502;The acting, the scenery, the script, everything was good in this film.
1503;The love between Winonna Ryder, and Johnny Depp (who gave wonderfull performances) was sweet and heartfelt.
1504;This film is really hard to review because it is so good.
1505;Tim Burton's best movie in my opinion, this film is certainly a 90s classic.
1506;wholesome entertainment for children, yet saucy enough for adults.
1507;Tim Burton's films coupled with Depp's remarkable acting abilities make this movie a classic.
1508;And, let's not forget Vincent Price who adds his star power to this brilliant masterpiece.
1509;"With this darkly romantic and surreal fable Tim Burton got so one of the best "" fantastique "" movies of the ninenties as one of the most devastating satires of the ""american way of life"" and ,specifically, of the american middle."
1510;style castle where Edwards lives and the exhaustly kitsch design of most of the houses of the closer district.
1511;This is a intresting movie.
1512;His role playing Edward is very powerful like all his other roles, but the movie is just a bit too odd for me.
1513;There is little to add to all the well deserved praise this masterpiece has garnered.
1514;I particularly enjoyed seeing it again close to the release of Frankenweenie, because it was fascinating to see how some of the themes and scenes rapidly evoked in Frankenweenie came back fully fleshed in Scissorhands.
1515;a great movie to watch with your adolescent kids, to launch a discussion on so many of the social difficulties that pleague this phase of life.
1516;even if it didn't have a plot or a point, it would still be worth watching again and again for the use of color in depicting a time period.
1517;I can't imagine a more beautifully crafted movie.
1518;The pastel stereotype Suburbia is so interesting, the characters are complete stereotypes and yet they are all unique.
1519;The visual aspects and the music blend together perfectly, I think this is Tim Burton's best film (and also probably my favorite Depp movie as well, though I've seen Benny Joon a thousand times and love it to death so it's hard to tell).
1520;overall, this movie is magical.
1521;It's something you can watch again and again.
1522;The characters are interesting and Depp's performance is beautiful.
1523;This movie is a classic.
1524;I am a huge fan of Tim Burton and this is one of his best films, in my opinion.
1525;One of my favorite movies of all times!
1526;I adore Johnny Depp and I think this is one of his best!
1527;It's funny, sad and emotional!
1528;Add it to you collection if you are a fan of Johnny!
1529;I loved this movie when it came out years ago and still do.
1530;a young Johnny Depp at the beginning of his career is great to see.
1531;This was a Great Film.
1532;Kids loved it and enjoyed watching it.
1533;Each of his films are at once entertaining, mesmerizing and thought provoking, giving the viewer an askewed but vivid portrayal of life through the images he so masterfully captures.
1534;edward Scissorhands is a prime example of such a film.
1535;When there, she discovers an enchanted old mansion, with beautiful sculptures cut from the tress and bushes that adorn the gardens.
1536;Edward, dark and mysterious, is a stark contrast to the bright, vibrant, colorful cookie.
1537;the story advances when Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder) returns home from a weekend camping trip.
1538;Burton, whose films might be considered bizarre and cartoonish at the front, makes a couple of very poignant points about acceptance and love in this film.
1539;Edward and Kim, through a series of events, are drawn together, and Kim learns that Edward's beauty is an internal one, and that, despite any physical abnormalities, he is far more beautiful than anyone she knows, save maybe for Peg, who defends Edward when the neighborhood turns on him later in the film.
1540;tim Burton's casting, direction and cinematic flare are never more poignant than they are in this film.
1541;If a director has a signature piece, than Edward Scissorhands is Burton's, and it shows.
1542;Audiences will be touched by the tender performance Johnny Depp, whose portrayal of Edward is both moving and completly believable, a task that must have been doubly challenging considering the amount of prosthetics and make.
1543;this film is a must have for any Burton fan, and a good film for the whole family.
1544;Though there are moments in the film that might be slightly inappropriate for younger audiences, the film as a whole is a tender and touching love story and a story of acceptance despite diversity.
1545;danny Elfman, whose scores have become synonymous with some of the most popular television and film programs ever (The Simpsons, Tales from the Crypt, Batman), scores this film beautifully, and his soundtrack is haunting and tender.
1546;The acting in the film is first rate, with an array of first rate actors (including those listed above): Alan Arkin and Anthony Michael Hall round out the cast.
1547;The film itself is digitally mastered, giving the sound and color a brilliance even more vibrant than provided in the theater.
1548;I was compelled to write this review after seeing 5 stars from all the other reviewers and having a really strong feeling against this movie.
1549;I loved this story in the 90's and I love it today.
1550;Its a sweet story with some very deep concerns and is thought provoking.
1551;A beautifully gentle person is mislead by others greed.
1552;The ending is just precious.
1553;Tim Burton was born in 1958 raised in the suburban city of Burbank California.
1554;He loved to draw and actually had a sketch of the little boy with the scissors for hands, now, Edward Scissorhands DECADES before his character became a feature film.
1555;The wild, black hair, the lonliness, reclusiveness, not really fitting in .
1556;That, plus the 1950's 60's portrayal of the suburbanite homes and nuclear families in the picture and you can see why this particular Burton film makes you feel just a bit more wonderful, sick sad all at the same time for the world and the people that live in it.
1557;this film is highly recommended and it is great family fare!Happy Watching!
1558;When I first saw this film, I thought of it as one of Tim Burton's more unusual efforts.
1559;But as time has gone by, it has become to touch me on many levels.
1560;"the music and ""choir"" backup lends a true heart."
1561;The scene where Ryder dances in the snow created by Edward's ice carving is unforgettable.
1562;She is able to celebrate who this person is.
1563;but I leave it as an adult tale of a love that could never be fully consumated.
1564;"colored ""normal"" people who never comprehend or appreciate that special individual who is Edward Scissorhands."
1565;I hope we never see a sequel, for this work stands alone as a modern day classic.
1566;I must say, this is one of the best films I have seen.
1567;Combined with a brilliant soundtrack,(Composed by Danny Elfman) that is both genius and touching, I would reccomed this movie to anybody.
1568;I found the movie very good because it was very strange.
1569;He took the attention of other people's on him.
1570;This was very good behavior of the women.
1571;All of these things made me love the movie.
1572;Thank you for sending my movie so fast.
1573;Depp and Burton embark on a career together that is one of the great duos of Hollywood's lore, watch it again and again!!!!!!!
1574;There is so much detail in the scenes.
1575;He's the one the that makes this into a real fearytale.
1576;This movie is just another one of Tim Burton's great masterpieces(along with Batman, Beetlejuice, etc.) It's so gothic and gloomy and has such a classical romantic feel to it.
1577;Gotta love his cinematography, unique storylines, clever detailed touches, humanistic parodies, and wry humor.
1578;This is a beautifully expressive film sure to please all.
1579;As a viewer every emotion possible will embrace you and you'll walk away with a teary sadness mixed with the pure pleasure of having your senses titillated beyond your imagination.
1580;I assure you that weeks later you will reflect on this film, Johnny Depp's incredible acting abilities, and the blast of genuine colors throughout which is a Burton signature.
1581;Truly a film that will leave you entranced and satisfied.
1582;Burton is a class act and a creative genius which is clearly evident in this wonderful family film.
1583;This film is truly great.
1584;up was done, the special scissor.
1585;effects, interviews with the cast and directors' commentary.
1586;This is a golden movie.
1587;It is quiet, queer, funny, touching and original.
1588;Johnny Depp does a great job, back before he was just a character actor.
1589;This is a wonderful film.
1590;I haven't seen it in a while, but I remember I liked it except that it was very dark.
1591;But thats what makes this movie so special.
1592;"Until then he's been a gentle, goofy soul, a quixotic outsider."""
1593;"He began as a gentle soul and left as a gentle soul
1594;He dared to reach out of his high mountain and try for acceptance in this place that seemed so beautiful from afar.
1595;ES pokes fun at those who are living a lie.
1596;deep (or perhaps air deep, teehee), and underneath lies this ravaging monster who wants to tear innocence apart.
1597;His plight was worth something, and Tim gives the artist, who feels completely alone in his world of emotion and creativity, someone to hold on to, a glimmer of light to serve as his once source of happiness.
1598;the SET, needless to say, and the music, exemplified the story and character of edward immaculately.
1599;fulfilling when looked at as a whole.
1600;And it's also sort of a Christmas movie.
1601;I also liked Burton's 'Batman' yay!
1602;It shows what really matters in life.
1603;The feelings of the heart are what count.
1604;that is where true beauty lies.
1605;Edward Scissorhands is without question director Tim Burton's masterpiece.
1606;while Burton's other films manage to grab the senses on a visual level instead of an emmotional level, Edward Scissorhands does both, with a combination of its gothic sets and special effects, stunning musical score by Danny Elfman (his best also) and empathetic characters that resemble you and me"
1607;edward Scissorhands is one of the greatest films ever made.
1608;I wish Depp win Oscar tomorrow.
1609;He used his heart to understand that character and rendered him vividly on screen.
1610;and yes, this movie is rather touching, as least it got my tears.
1611;Johnny Depp did a truly wonderful job with his portrayal of the childlike and innocent Edward.
1612;This movie goes beyond breathtaking.
1613;It is a beautiful, heartbreaking love story that just completely leaves you in awe.
1614;Danny Elfman is also a genius for the heavenly music he makes for Tim Burton films, especially this one.
1615;Johnny Depp and Winona Rider are outstandingly perfect.
1616;It is one of my all time favorite movies.
1617;I highly recommend if you have a blue ray player of some kind that you get this movie with that format.
1618;It's an incredible movie that balances drama, comedy, and tragedy with one of the best movie scores I've ever heard.
1619;Tim Burton has made one of the most memorable movie characters of all time.
1620;You'll laugh, you'll cry (and I'm a 20 year old guy and I still can't hold back my tears) and you WILL want to see this movie again.
1621;it has so much power.
1622;Tim Burton's storytelling, it is magnificent.
1623;his imagination is so great.
1624;the way he portrays his characters is so unique.
1625;she's such a good actress.
1626;Danny Elfman's score is superb!
1627;This fable has all of the beautiful hallmark visual touches of Tim Burton handled with a truly gentle and loving hand.
1628;But it also has a truly sympathetic hero in Edward and a cast of supporting characters that might in some cases be little more than stereotypes, but work wonderfully well to create a touching movie experience as Edward's life is turned upside down and his experiences in suburbia veer from the positive to tragic.
1629;The extras aren't all they might have been but this is a wonderful film that warrants five enthusiastic stars.
1630;It should have been watchable until August 2.
1631;Johnny Rat is an unbeliveably talented actor and the Direction genius of Rat Burton makes it an easy 5 star flick.
1632;building strength to go along with his pictorial flair.
1633;i give Ebert's reviews, 0 stars
1634;The nice, kind, mean no harm man he is in this movie makes me even more crazy about him.
1635;This is a fun love story to watch with your kids 13 and up.
1636;I enjoy watching it time and time again.
1637;A lot of people think that the point of the movie is to display the way people will love something one second and hate it the next.
1638;"i honestly have no idea what Tim Burton's masterpiece of a movie is ""really"" about."
1639;I know it sounds like a specific description, but the idea is just so universally poignant that details and all it has been done numerous times (the most notable being Gaston Leroux's ` The Phantom of the Opera' and of course `Beauty and The Beast').
1640;then there's the whole other story of Johnny Depp's performance.
1641;I am fairly confident that not a lot of actors could have successfully played the part of Edward, so when you consider how successfully Depp did play it that says something.
1642;This one is sooo special, it will absolutely melt your heart away.
1643;Tim Burton has out done himself, and Danny Elfman's music is enchanting.
1644;This is a must see for all ages and will forever be deamed, in my eyes, as a classic.
1645;Brand new and just as it should be.
1646;Tim Burton did a great job on this film and Johnny Depp was as superb as usual.
1647;While funny, this is still a dark comedy.
1648;The Collector's Edition is excellent, but the tin seems a bit unnesessary.
1649;This is one of my favorite Tim Burton movies.
1650;Johnny Depp is great as Edward Scissorhands.
1651;Tim Burton is definitely the most inventive director out there, and I have gone back to watching his older movies again after seeing the incredible Big Fish .
1652;time favorites of Burton's, because it is such a strange story created into a modern fairy tale, with his usual cleverness.
1653;And Burton is smart about this.
1654;Winona Ryder is also good here, and Alan Arkin is amazing as the often dazed and confused father of the family Edward lives with.
1655;burton really captures our imagination with his gothic world of surrealism, making us believe that this could have actually transpired somewhere, sometime.
1656;It is funny, sad, heart.
1657;warming and romantic all at the same time, and it should be cherished as the classic that it is.
1658;I would have liked to see them do interviews with the cast and crew now, ten years after this remarkable film was released.
1659;This was the first glimpse that Johnny Depp is a genius.
1660;Combine this with Tim Burton's ability to create a quirky and colorful world and you have a lovely movie and a story of an outcast that most everyone can relate to.
1661;It is a lovely movie and appropriate for those 8.80, maybe even a little younger if they young ones aren't disturbed by darker imagery.
1662;Excellent movie and rated so whole family can enjoy Mr. Depps amazing acting.
1663;Great to see how he was before he became Captain Jack Sparrow.
1664;Part fantasy, part fable, part drama, and part satire, it's a spectacularly done movie.
1665;"A very imaginative story
1666;Also simply beautiful to look at .
1667;the use of style, color, and direction is astounding.
1668;I love how it can always make me laugh!
1669;The """"funny parts"""" aren't too cheesy, which is rare!"""
1670;I love the movie and I love Johnny Depp and Tim Burton.
1671;He had scissors as hands and that brought plenty of attention from the local housewives.
1672;But the others discovered a raw talent in him after he had cut some shrubbery in Peg's backyard.
1673;His artistic flair sprouted as he cut women's hair, dog hair and constructed ice sculptures.
1674;This is a magical fairy tale movie that will leave anyone crying for weeks.
1675;Edward Scissorhands is one of my favorite movies and it's one of Tim Burton's best.
1676;This is one of my two all time favorite films (American Beauty being the other).
1677;Straight from the heart of genius director Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands is the story of a boy who has scissors for hands.
1678;He is created by an inventor and they live in a castle on top of a mountain.
1679;Then one day Peg, an avon lady, comes to his rescue and brings him to live with her.
1680;There he is introduced to suburbia and the colorful characters who live there.
1681;Johnny Depp is perfect as the lonely scissorhanded boy and Winona Ryder is gorgeous as Kim, but this movie is above all a triumph for director Tim Burtom who really pours his heart and soul into this film and makes a movie so beautiful it will make you cry.
1682;Tim Burton is my personal favorite director and all of his films are dear to me but this one is the icing on the cake.
1683;A man with scissors for hands, is brought to live in a suburban town, with a suburban family.
1684;This movie is richly entertaining, amusing and inventive.
1685;Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands can be called a masterpiece, in my opinion.
1686;It is touching and emotional in the most pleasant and saddening ways.
1687;Edward Scissorhands is an incredible take on the fairytale of a boy who just wants to fit in, who wants to have a life like others around him, and wants to find his true love to spend his life with.
1688;Johnny Depp shines as the fragile, yet uncompleted creation of The Inventor (Vincent Price).
1689;But to those who get to know the real Edward, he is just as human as anyone else, gentle and wanting to share in the love of the world.
1690;tim Burton creates Edward Scissorhands in a funny, comically creative, yet very moving way.
1691;The closing scene between Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder is enough to bring anyone to tears.
1692;The story and characters are beyond well developed and this is a movie worth adding to your collection.
1693;You'll return to visit this wonderful story of a boy with scissors for hands and a heart made from a cookie again and again.
1694;i consider this movie one of the best i've seen =) The love in this movie is unique and the humor is good.
1695;she should haf went back to the castle one day and pay him a visit =(i truly recommend you watching this.
1696;In this movie, Johnny expresses his cuteness in the outside instead of the outside.
1697;which i find really great
1698;Edward Scissorhands is the perfect drama in my opinion, an amazing, astonishing movie!!!!!

1701;He absolutely loves this movie!
1702;I loved this movie the first time I saw it as well.
1703;This item was even better than anticipated!
1704;We really liked the story.
1705;This movie is almost impossible to explain but imaginative director Tim Burton has taken parts of Frankenstein mixed it with Desperate Housewives and added a bit of Beauty and the Beast eventually arriving at a hauntingly touching tale that is perfect for any audience.
1706;During this time Edward starts to make topiaries and finds a talent for cutting hair, both for women and neighborhood dogs.
1707;the mind of Tim Burton is unlike any other and this film exposes all of the cruelties of society and the emphasis it places on perfection.
1708;With brilliant insight from an extremely unique perspective Burton brings forth the character of Edward Scissorhands from somewhere unfathomable yet he makes him entirely relatable if you have ever felt yourself to be an outsider.
1709;Johnny Depp brings Edward to life with a vulnerable innocence that can only be compared to the greatest movie creation of all, Frankenstein's monster.
1710;Winona Ryder is the beauty to Depp's beast.
1711;Johnny is such a wonderful actor and you truly believe that Edward is real.
1712;Tim Burton is a genius and this movie proves it.
1713;Anyone can enjoy this movie and maybe learn something about our own hearts and biases at the same time.
1714;Cute film and great acting (I love Kathy Baker.
1715;A wonderful hedge trimmer though.
1716;Edward Scissorhands is one of the best movies ever.
1717;Besides that, he plays an amazing role and is backed by a great cast and soundtrack.

1719;, but it also has a wonderful plot.

1725;Beautiful, funny, sad, and enchanting.

1727;d models of the inventor's castle and are very cool looking.
1728;There are excellent commentary tracks from Burton and Danny Elfman (music composer) that are both entertaining and insightful.
1729;There's a brief featurette that is somewhat intriguing.
1730;There are also the trailers, and then TV.
1731;But what you'll cherish is the anamorphic widescreen, the Dolby Digital sound, and those commentary tracks.
1732;this movie is just plain amazing.
1733;almost like a gothic fairy tale right out of the pages of a book.
1734;Johnny Depp's costume is beautiful.
1735;the movie touches my heart everytime i see it.
1736;the movie is bittersweet, leaving your heart melted and wanting more.
1737;it was a great movie, and in great condition!
1738;We all enjoyed it, great family movie!
1739;"The best thing that ""Edward Scissorhands"" has going for it is that it was directed by Tim Burton, perhaps the only man who could make this story move us."
1740;seen concept and compelling visuals?
1741;how can I enjoy this movie, then?
1742;Because, in the end, it truly is about love and having a big heart.
1743;Ryder is able to perfectly capture the essence of youthful beauty, while Edward is a character for whom sympathy is a must.
1744;Their moments on screen together (combined with a wonderful score from Danny Elfman) are spectacular and worth the viewing time alone.
1745;overall, this is a decent film that will always be remember for its unique concept and title character.
1746;If you can do that, you will care about what happens in the end.
1747;"I believe I did see this movie as a child
1748;johnny Depp is always awesome and he did a great job in this movie.
1749;The colors were vibrant and fun and the story line was very cute.
1750;My kids love this movie (and they usually do not appreciate old movies) and it was clean enough for them to watch along with me (12 .
1751;if you haven't seen this movie yet, it is worth the watch!
