3;This is my favorite movie of all times.
4;I have watched this movie from the day I received it in the mail.
5;Great price received on time.
6;Thank you thank you thank you.
7;I confess, I've never read the book but I sure do love this movie.
8;A gripping story lovingly told.
9;it is considered a classic both on paper and in film.
10;theres these 2 kids scout and gem who are growing up in the south long ago.
11;i think this is one of those rare movies that is likeable by everyone.
12;its good beginning to end also.
13;the trial is pretty intense and the closing scenes too.
14;a great great great GREAT movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15;worthy, the characters are groan.
16;Avoid this movie please, if you truly like movies.
17;I don't often view movies more than once, but this one is worth seeing every few years.
18;It is true to the great novel from which it came.
19;It brilliantly captures through the eyes of a child the nobility as well as the meanness of humankind.
20;Maybe it was just Harper Lee's style of writing.
21;But the movie is incredible.
22;Gregory Peck's Atticus is completely admirable, and Scout Boo Radley are two of the most innocent and adorable characters.
23;They're a trip, especially Scout!
24;The story is excellent on many levels, and it's a bit more complex than a retelling of the plot would indicate.
25;deserved Oscar for his portrayal of attorney Atticus Finch, one of literature's most memorable characters.
26;so how did this translate to the big screen?
27;The child actors, both newcomers, were excellent in their roles.
28;Ditto on the boy who portrayed Dill, whose part was far larger in the novel but which is good in the film as well.
29;The results are still as complex and multi.
30;I got a strong sense that the actors were equally aware, and that's cool.
31;"Later in this newsletter you'll see ""The One."
32;But this book, and this movie, are a fantastic example of what I'm talking about.
33;There is an old lady who is cranky.
34;These kids just wander around (to present a view of life).
35;"He tells ""Scout"" about the need for proper deportment in school."
36;Atticus returns to shoot it, he is known as a good shot.
37;A man shows up for a scary scene.
38;Atticus bars the door, he defends it with moral strength.
39;The courtroom is packed solid, but there is room on the second floor.
40;Mr Robinson takes the stand and tells what happened.
41;Finch asks for justice for his client.
42;Later Finch learns that Robinson was shot while trying to escape.
43;An example of poetic justice?
44;This ending damages the story.]
45;To Kill a Mockingbird is a Hollywood classic.
46;This is Gregory Peck's signature role, he won an Oscar for Best Actor.
47;He is flawless, gental, and humble in the role of lawyer Atticus Finch.
48;I love and admire this movie, has a meaningful message and a timeless story.
49;I highly recommend this treasure, enjoy!
50;This is my favorite movie of all times.
51;It arrived on time and in great condition.
52;This is a wonderful classic and he really enjoyed watching it after he read the book.
53;I would recommend this classic to anyone.
54;Good and evil are clearly drawn, and the values of justice and humanity portrayed with rare and memorable strength.
55;reading Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel had a huge impact on me as a teenager.
56;horton Foote won an Oscar for his screenplay, which is so faithful to the book.
57;Set in depression era Alabama, it's seen through the eyes of 8 year old Scout, beautifully played by Mary Badham, and the sensitivity of director Mulligan's vision is remarkable.
58;he's intensely moving as this innocent and silent man).
59;russell Harlan's superb cinematography should be seen in the widescreen version to be fully appreciated, and Elmer Bernstein's Americana style score adds so much to the film.
60;gregory Peck's Oscar winning performance is magnificent.
61;His Atticus is a hero of immense proportions, with compassion, integrity, and humility.
62;and it's one of the many reasons I think this powerful classic deserves to be in every video library.
63;after having read the book, which, as is often the case, is better than the movie.
64;The visual and audio qualities were excellent.
65;This film is an excellent black and white adaptation of Harper Lee's book of the same name.
66;That dramatic tension, muted as it was by the cinematic and social conventions of the time, nevertheless made a strong statement about the underlying tensions of this society at a time when the Southern black civil rights struggle movement was coming in focus in the national consciousness.
67;"That part is in some ways, particularly when the children watch the trial from the ""Negro"" balcony section of the courtroom, the least successful of the film."
68;What is entirely believable and gives some relief from the travesty that is unfolding are the pranks, pitfalls and antics of the kids.
69;The tensions between brother and sister, the protective role of the older brother, the attempt by the sister to assert her own identity, the sense of adventure and mystery of what lies beyond the immediate household that is the hallmark of youth all get a work out here.
70;But in the end it is the quiet dignity of solid old Atticus and the bewildered dignity of a doomed black man that hold this whole thing together.
71;Now that I understand more about the story and what is really going on, I believe it should be required viewing.
72;town South at the trough of the Depression.
73;To me, the languid pace seems perfectly at home with small towns, summer heat, southern courtliness, and Gregory Peck's quiet integrity as an actor and his tendency to slightly underplay a scene.
74;Elmer Bernstein's musical score is a treat of Americana.
75;With such well casted actors, this movie truly portrayed the problems in ancient and even today's society.
76;It shows the world through the eye of a child, and how innocence knows no evil.
77;BOTH are the best of American classics ever!!
78;This movie also won an Academy Award.
79;The children's impression and admiration for their father grows throughtout the movie.
80;To Kill A Mockingbird is enjoyable and educational and it explores stereotypical prejudices of the deep south with many emotional experiences.
81;i highly recommend this movie for everyone.
82;He has no lines in it, but has a high impact of emotions.
83;The story is as powerful on the screen as in print.
84;Nothing is lost, and the performances are perfect.
85;Remastered version wonderfully captures the mood of this masterpiece.
86;Enjoyed this on a quiet Saturday morning.
87;I was born and raised in the state of Alabama so To Kill a Mockingbird was both a great story and provided wonderful historical backgroup for me.
88;This is a wonderful movie no matter where you are from.
89;There is a bit of a mystery and big scare for Scout and her brother.
90;There is also wonderful acting and great entertainment.
91;Most of us are familiar with Harper Lee's classical novel by this name about depression.
92;gregory Peck delivers a great performance as Atticus Finch, the conscientious lawyer who defends a black man against false rape allegations.
93;His children, Jem and Scout, played by Philip Alford and Mary Badham are extremely well.
94;cast and act very naturally.
95;screen, thanks in part to screenwriter Horton Foote.
96;Although filmed on a holywood set, the rustic ambiance of the old southern town is brought to life very vividly.
97;My family loves this film.
98;From the very first time I saw it when I was 4 or 5 years old, I have really enjoyed it.
99;The Atticus character is the ideal father figure, the kids are fun and innocent, and the world is damaged.
100;The acting is top notch for this time period (especially the adults).
101;The cinematography was also very beautiful, with a couple complaints.
102;Anyways, I love the movie, love the characters, and it is a must own for your collection!
103;The remastering on this Blue Ray is fantastic!
104;I'd recommend this for everyone who likes old movies!
105;This was a present for my wife who collects old movies and she was tickled.
106;This book captures so much of the feel of the book.
107;It is a wonderful story about a man who stands for his convictions and passes that legacy onto his children.
108;I love Scout's first person retelling of this touching, thought provoking story.
109;It is in black and white and is perfect that way!
110;to Kill a Mockingbird is a true classic!!
111;I remember going to see it in the theater as a child, and I loved it then as much as I love it now.
112;A true classic and so thankful to be able to watch it again.
113;Lttile deep fro your kids but still a great lesson.
114;Wonderful movie a true classic.
115;A great movie AND a great book!
116;I love every minute of this movie and hope that others will find the same joy in reliving this classic.
117;This is one of my favorite movies.
118;I love the great preformeces by all the actors.
119;It is a great follow up to the book or you can say it is a wonderful court.
120;I would love to see a bit more.
121;It is such a wonderful story and I'm glad to be able to add it to my collection.
122;Classic stuff and worth having in any home library.
123;This is a classic story, the film is very moving.
124;It portrays imagination, struggle, friendship, and many aspects of life that seem fresh, though the movie is very old.
125;The story is told from the unique prospective of a well to do family during the great depression, that alone sets it apart from most films.
126;There are several plot elements that come full.
127;circle by the end of the movie, and show that people can be, and are capable of doing both beautiful and ugly things.
128;It is an excellent film about taking a stand, friendship, trust, learning, and growing, among many other things.
129;It is exciting to me to see this movie given the attention that it deserves.
130;Reviewing it was an honor.
131;This movie is special to me.
132;I saw it as an early teenager as a two night special movie presentation.
133;Atticus Finch is for me like an amazing Uncle who showed me what values and character are all about.
134;I believe this story is among the most important of my generation.
135;This is a must have movie.
136;This is my favorite movie of all time.
137;year old son and he loved it, too.
138;I enjoyed listening to SCOUT as an adult telling what it was like to play her role as a child and and what it was like to walk up and just sit in Mr. Peck's lap whenever she wanted.
139;Just a wonderful family movie.
140;Knowing that it is rendered one of the finest cinematic accomplishments of all time had perked my interest early on but it became the movie I wanted to see but never got around to.
141;i guess the first thing I should say is that everything you've heard about this film is true, all the praise it received was well deserved and every second of it's running time is well worth it.
142;unquote prejudices with a neighborhood boy named Boo Radley they watch their father work to free a man he knows is innocent.
143;Atticus, a widower, works equally hard to instill good morals in his two children and raise them right and this is reflected in their ability to reason on situations, some even too big for them to fully understand.
144;`To Kill a Mockingbird' truly is a downright perfect film.
145;The acting is superb, which is something I never truly expected.
146;I have watched a fair share of older films and have always found that the acting never truly stacks up to the great actors of today, but the performances by Gregory Peck especially rival those of today.
147;Gregory Peck (who won the Oscar for this performance) comes across so natural, so organic here.
148;His performance is understandably tempered and it helps aid the message of the film along.
149;the two young children as well, Mary Badham and Philip Alford, are excellent here.
150;For young actors they grasped their characters exceptionally well.
151;Brock Peters is convincing as Tom Robinson, the black man on trial, and James Anderson is deliciously evil as Robert Ewell, the man accusing him of the crime (against his daughter).
152;it was also interesting to see a young Robert Duvall here in a very small yet very powerful role.
153;He was truly commanding and played a key part in making this film's message a universal one.
154;It's brilliantly scripted, acted and directed and stands the test of time, for while it was released in 1962 it still means something today, 45 years later.
155;`To Kill a Mockingbird' is a film that everyone should see in order to appreciate and one that I highly recommend to anyone with the slightest interest.
156;I love the book and love the movie even more.
157;The is a great movie for all to see.
158;To Kill a Mockingbird Bird is a classic.
159;This is truly a classic.
160;This makes the first half come alive.
161;It is so good that my students do not even mind it is in black and white.
162;Probably the best movie ever made.
163;They did an amazing job of evoking a feeling and an era that seamlessly matches that of the book.
164;That they succeeded in a film with child actors makes it that much more admirable.
165;An all time favorite movie and the extra features are almost as interesting as the movie.
166;Reading the book just adds to the experience.
167;it is apart of our history.
168;originally adapted from the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee, director Robert Mulligan reveals his vision of the classic when the picture opens with a monologue from a seemingly grown.
169;The frame is focused on an all.
170;"Mystery constantly surrounds their dilapidated home as gossip and tall tales run high in the town
171;Atticus is a character that demands respect both on paper and on screen, and the multi.
172;talented Peck delivers this attitude.
173;His calm demeanor and noble ways add to the character development in the film.
174;The tension between the word of a black person versus the word of a white person is depicted perfectly by Mulligan when the controversial case goes to court.
175;The small courthouse not equipped for many people is suddenly packed with eager onlookers.
176;When the case begins, Atticus asks Tom Robinson subtle, honest questions and receives truthful answers in return.
177;Nonetheless, it is well known throughout the movie that the jury still favors Mayella because of the color of her skin.
178;Not everything is as perfect and plain as it seems though.
179;Atticus's plans for the trial come to an unexpected halt, but his positive, sensible mind helps him come to terms with the outcomes of the whole debacle.
180;The sensation from the film's conclusion fills audiences everywhere with content and motivates them to be as noble as Atticus Finch in their daily lives.
181;In this intense yet satisfying ending, we see the invariable nature of humans to disagree, but the positive consequences for those who rise above.
182;Since the story is set in the 1930's, the classic look of the film adds weight to its historic reality.
183;Added to this is a stellar cast who manage to hold their own against the amazing performance given by, Gregory Peck, an actor at the peak of his abilities.
184;For those who also enjoy Robert Duvall's huge body of work, it may be interesting to note this film as his first, in a non.
185;there is an interesting contrast between what we see of Atticus and how his two children describe him.
186;A man who is strong enough to stand against hatred, and brave enough to highlight the weaknesses of flawed white girl against the strengths of an honest black man.
187;well, I reckon because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy.
188;It was a magnificent movie Gregory Peck did a superb job of acting.
189;I dd see the movie when it was first released.
190;Every person should see this movie, I never read the book, my niece did, she said the book was better!
191;Peck is one of my favorite all time actors due to his consistent great performances.
192;His style is unique and character credibility as believable as any real life.
193;Harper Lee must have loved her Daddy and big brother.
194;Her warm fictional remembrance of them as Atticus and Jem in To Kill a Mockingbird is filled with respect and love.
195;She had a story to tell of race and hatred and tolerance and understanding, but underpinning all of it is her love of the two central males of her childhood, her kind and wise father, and her loving, protective brother.
196;This is the heart of her book, and it is the heart of this faithfully adapted film of that book.
197;The characters in this story of childhood adventures, awakenings and surprises, with the trial of an innocent black man in the South of the 30's at its center, are by and large decent people.
198;this flawlessly cast movie is a masterpiece.
199;It captures the innocense and wonder of childhood, and the sometimes tragedy struggle of adulthood without preaching.
200;The performances are first rate down to the smallest role.
201;Robert Mulligan manages to capture the world from a child's perspective without belaboring it.
202;It captured and moved me then.
203;It's simple truths and humanity are timeless.
204;Great classic film on the evils of segregation and the power of one man to champion an innocent against the accusations of members of the prevailing white class.
205;Such simplicity of form and thought is seldom seen in movies today, except, perhaps, in the rare instance of an Erin Brochovich fighting corporate greed.
206;The lead character, Atticus, is brilliantly portrayed by Gregory Peck.
207;The cinematography was outstanding given the limitations at the time.
208;This is a movie that is perfect for anyone, particularly families.
209;The movie is just a great, and Gregory Peck is just incredible.
210;Scout and Jem were fantastic as well.
211;I would recommend the book and movie to anyone.
212;I would also like to add that these reviews aren't a joke, and this book/movie should be appreciated, as it is the best book I have ever read, and the best movie I have ever seen.
213;It's absoulutely BRILLIANT and I strongly reccommend you should see it.
214;Not much to say other than this is a great movie.
215;It's rare that a movie has such universal appeal that even my nephew who was seven at the time he saw it loved it and wanted to see it again.
216;I remember watching this when I was young.
217;The relationship Scout and Jem had with their father was wondrous and moving.
218;Gregory Peck's performance as the widowed lawyer with 2 kids showed the strength, grace, dignity and vulnerability of Atticus Finch during the trial and aftermath of Tom Robinson the black man accused of rape.
219;Mary Badham's performance as the mischievous and willful tomboy named Scout who lovingly reminisces about her mother with her father is so pure and innocent.
220;She and her brother Jem's decision to make the town recluse come out of hiding is a fateful one that will forever change their lives.
221;The book was a masterpiece and although the film couldn't possibly include everything that was in the book all is forgiven because the film is a masterpiece in it's own right.
222;The order was received in a timely manner and I had no problems at all.
223;We read TO Kill a Mockingbird in our English class, and I loved it.
224;As well as Scout and Jem being played by the perfect people.
225;The film is extremely moving, and provides even more want to read the book and get into the whole story.
226;Some of my favorite scenes include the trial, Scout's talks with Atticus, and of course Radley's appearance.
227;The setting of the Novel is perfectly portrayed, and lets us understand the book even better.
228;Even if you didn't like the book, I encourage that you watch the movie becuase it was excellent!!
229;One of the best movies ever made, along with one of the best books ever made.
230;Movies are hard to come by in this day, but this is one that anyone and everyone could and can love.
231;I got this for a friend who never had seen the movie or read the book.
232;Loved Gregory Peck recalling Harper's comparison of him to her dad.
233;Gregory Peck's performance is 5 stars!
234;Amazing the plot of this film is somewhat still happening today in 'modern' times.
235;I need fingers and also toes of more than just me to count the number of times I have seen this movie since the first time I watched it when I was in fourth grade in the late 1960s, and my whole family sat riveted, huddled under wool blankets, on our unheated, glassed.
236;Many decades later, I can tell you that it still changes me every time I watch it.
237;In an era when little girls were being sold Easy Bake Ovens and there was no such thing as an alternative family, this movies protagonist is a tomboy (Scout) in a family headed by a man (Atticus Finch, who is a lawyer), and the childrens best friend is a delicate visiting neighbor modeled on Truman Capote.
238;To Kill a Mockingbird is equally a movie about how to learn from misguided assumptions, about recognizing love, and about creative survival.
239;I will stake my life and reputation that this is one of the best films ever made and that will ever be made.
240;Most films made now have one note themes.
241;Years after you watch it, you might hear the movie theme music and feel moved to tears.
242;It is told beautifully and Gregory Peck is, of course, his wonderful Oscar.
243;The script for this movie was based upon Harper Lee's sensitive and intelligent novel set in racially.
244;The film was put together by two excellent film.
245;read the original after a number of years.
246;I loved the writing and the """"southernisms"""" that reconnected me to the years I lived in the south (Texas, Alabama, Florida and North Carolina) and the travel I have done there."""
247;What a great example of southern culture of that time and the courage of a man for whom choosing to do the right thing was more important than what might happen afterwards.
248;Scout was a great spokesperson.
249;I just got through watching this movie again.
250;what a wonderful movie to add to you're collection.
251;She was so excited and we watched it together over two nights.
252;She loved it and I loved it again.
253;I was just a teenager still in high school, but immediately loved the movie, which I have seen countless times since.
254;Gregory Peck is probably the single greatest reason for the movie's smashing success, although the entire cast does a terrific job in bringing this momentous story to the screen.
255;Yet despite the sizzling if subdued sexual content and the divisive issues surrounding the movie, it quickly became the movie of the year, winning Peck the Oscar for his incredible portrayal of rural southern lawyer Atticus Finch.
256;no doubt it is the character of Atticus Finch who deserves most of the credit for the novel's enduring popularity.
257;Seldom has such a quietly heroic figure been so favorably and memorably described in such loving detail in an American novel as is fortyish Atticus Finch, the highly principled and somewhat befuddled widower.
258;lawyer trying his level best to raise his two young children alone in the midst of the deep South during the early years of the Depression.
259;And, as played by Gregory Peck, this thoughtful, moral, and courageous man became a model of modern American manhood for all who read or watched his story unfold.
260;Indeed, we watch with growing affection as Atticus increasingly relies and depends on their black governess, and are amazed by the degree to which he is concerned for her welfare as well.
261;So well and accurately drawn are the characters of this fable of the life and times of Scout Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird , that one can only hope it continues to be widely seen and appreciated as a modern American classic.
262;It was in black and white and picture perfect.
263;Such a classic and I am sure we will enjoy it for many years to come.
264;Not only is the message right on, but the prose is also really great.
265;I watched the movie with my mother (my ten year old sister was too young for it) and cried and laughed and suffered through every emotion with Scout and the rest.
266;Even though I saw the movie right after I finished the novel, I still was on the edge of my seat the whole way through.
267;Even for being an older movie, it was still very good
268;Gregory Peck's character is so dynamic, upstanding, courageous and human, that he stands above virtually all other masculine roles, and provides us with a hero for the ages.
269;Other heroes of like stature come to mind, seeing this movie, including Martin Luther King, Abe Lincoln, Jesus, Gandhi, and select few others.
270;Gregory Peck's character shows the epitomy of being a mature adult (a real grown.
271;This is the type of man, I think, we all strive to be.
272;I bought this edition because it was the best deal available but I have enjoyed watching all the added features.
273;Got the movie and is good shape.
274;A great reminder how our morals can get lost as adults when we chose not to think about our actions, and take responsibility for what we say and do.
275;The best movie a real lassic.
276;I was surprised at how well all the elements came together for this film.
277;I would classify this as one of Gregory peck's best movies.
278;They spend time daring each other and their summer friend, to go up to the neighbor house as it holds some mysterious crazed person.
279;Watch as the mystery unfolds.
280;I really enjoyed this classic movie.
281;I am a fan of old favorite movies.
282;I would recommend it to others
283;I would recommend this movie to anybody who appreciates a great story acted out by a brilliant cast.
284;Great intrepretation of classic novel.
285;A good movie to watch with the family.
286;A black and white movie that is a delight to watch.
287;Excellent message conveyed to the audience.
288;The movie is almost as good as the novel.
289;I think the book is much, much better but it's good to have a set of anything.
290;It is just fantastic in every respect.
291;The story is timeless and at the time it was madea huge surprise I am sure but it is another Classic every home should have.
292;Haprer Lee wrote a wonderful story
293;Older movie, but excellent plot with lots of suspense!
294;Have been wanting to see it for a while since I've heard so much about it.
295;The whole cast was effectively convincing of Macon, GA in the 1930's.
296;I have watched this film about 20 times, but I keep going back for more.
297;This is one of my favorite movies (and books) of all time.
298;The book was excellent and the movie is true to the book in both story and nuance.
299;The story is so well told from Scout's eyes.
300;Gregory Peck, in the role of Scout's father, Atticus Finch, is outstanding .
301;"speaking) portrayal of Arthur ""Boo"" Radley by a young Robert Duvall is special."
302;What brings me to to tears in this movie is the amazing love that Scout and Gem share .
303;for a truly inspiring, poignant story.
304;Slip back into yesteryear with this heart.
305;town life in the South during the 1930s.
306;A great character study that will make you realize theydon't make 'em like this anymore.
307;The film and screenplay are superbly adapted from the Harper Lee Novel.
308;The child actors Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are natural and very believable.
309;Robert Duvall almost steals the show without even one word of dialoge.2.
310;"The ""A Conversation with Gregory Peck"" is highly recommended to all who love and respect Gregory Peck.3."
311;this is a movie that should be viewed many times if for no other reason than to remind us of what fine filmaking can be.
312;This movie is a classic that needs to be seen by each upcoming generation.
313;Peck was an excellent actor and had a unmistakable presence on screen.
314;like all Peck films, this one is a great preformance.
315;Atticus Finch is what it means to be an American.
316;No other film has so artfully illumed the grit, and the impotence, of the decent citizen.
317;Embayed in a community corrupted.
318;It is a classic movie and I do like it.
319;Gregory Peck is a perfect Atticus though.
320;One of my all time favorite movies.
321;I will treasure this anniversary edition.
322;gone era, but the statement made is timeless.
323;My favorite movie of all.
324;ray picture and sound and by the special features that are on the disc.
325;One of the best all time stories and I'm giving it for a christmas gift for my daughter.
326;This Film Stunk, that is why I give this film 5 thumbs up.
327;The story is excellent, and the acting was superb.
328;Gregory Peck is excellent in this movie and the story was very good.
329;i will watch is many more times and I highly recommend this movie.
330;The movie is still a drama, but most of the foundation that builds to the drama is funny.
331;The actors did a great job, expecially Gregory Peck, who played Atticus Finch, a single father of two children and a lawyer in a small Southern town.
332;"I recently read the book, ""To kill a mockingbird"" and thoroughly enjoyed it."
333;Of course, it is in black and white, but nevertheless, very well done.
334;The acting, directing and script is supberb.
335;This is one of the best movies I have seen.
336;Gregory Peck is amazing in this performance.
337;All the actors were exceptional!
338;The world is a better place with this movie in it.
339;Faithfully adapted from Harper Lee's equally wonderful novel, with great acting performances and production values this film continues to engage viewers with a story line as relevant today as it was on release.
340;Gregory Peck won a well deserved Oscar for his lead role and rightly describes Attichus Finch as his favourite part .
341;and Robert Duvall, on movie debut, almost stops the show in one of my favourite scenes ever.
342;this 50th anniversary edition is a fully restored and remastered print and sound copy and includes two wonderful documentaries.
343;Engaging, You will be on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie!!
344;A Profound example of Human Compassion!
345;And a pretty profound example of the depravity and the LACK of justice experienced far, far too often in our American Justice system!!
346;I would recommend this film to everyone!!
347;The greatest of American films, and the greatest American hero (at least according to the voting of the American Film Institute).
348;i consider myself a fairly sophisticated film.
349;The performances are outstanding all around, and the story carries powerful, sincere messages that continue to resonate.
350;the message of tolerance has been covered here, but my favorite part of this film is the qualities that Anthony Peck's Atticus Finch displays as a father.
351;He is patient, engaged, and thoroughly loving.
352;The respect he shows for his own children is remarkable, and memorable.
353;It is such an awesome film, thanks to author Harper Lee's remarkably ingenious novel.
354;the plot in the film is true to Harper Lee's novel.
355;An adult Scout (played by Mary Badham) narrates and reflects on the events which took place over two summers when she was young girl, growing up in the Deep South, during the Depression.
356;The children, Tom Robinson and Boo Radley are mockingbirds.
357;director Robert Mulligan does a splendid job of impressing this innocence upon the viewer.
358;As she hums away like a hummingbird, Mulligan immediately creates a mood of innocence through the eyes of a child.
359;He carries on with the day.
360;"day simplicity of childhood in a sleepy Southern town, until half way through the film
361;gregory Peck as Atticus Finch gives a reserved and dignified performance of his character, certainly deserving of his Academy Award.
362;Brock Peters (who passed away a few months ago) as Tom Robinson offers a plaintive and stirring performance.
363;A young Robert Duvall, in his film debut, as the mute, gentle Boo Radley delivers a tremendous performance just with his eyes, facial expressions and body movement, saying more than some actors say in words, in a whole movie.
364;All are appropriately interspersed, adding genuine warmth and depth to the man who portrayed Atticus.
365;Quite surprisingly, we discover the actor and character were in many ways one and the same person.
366;in closing, I must say """"To Kill A Mockingbird"""" is at once an amazingly simple, yet profoundly universal story."""
367;Above all, it is a story that teaches the importance of fairness, justice, respect and love, for it is in these noble acts man learns to transcend his horrible propensity for prejudice, intolerance, ignorance and hatred.
368;I bought this movie after reading the book with my 8th grade class.
369;The whole sense of the book is seen in the movie, but the book is still better.
370;A great 'who done it' in the only good style that ever was, without a bunch of nudity and violence.
371;It's a real treat to hear from so many of the people who were involved in the production, from the producer, Alan J. Pakula, to the now grown actors who played Scout and Jim.
372;The audience gains great insights into what made this film so special, not only to the legions of its admiring fans, but to everyone involved in creating it.
373;Due credit is also given to Stephen Frankfurt, for his highly creative and original title design, which sets the tone so beatifully for the rest of the film.
374;there is no question that this is director Robert Mulligan's greatest film, nor that in his portrayal of Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck found the role most perfectly suited to his character and rock.
375;This is a film about integrity, essentially, and there is not a false moment in the film.
376;It's message and its relevance to the human condition will never go out of style, one hopes.
377;The single star is for Universal and NOT this brilliant film.
378;i can't tell which one is the best of the two.
379;we have two wonderful classics were children's innocence are shown at its purest.
380;elmer Bernstein's music is just exquisite, and will probably make you run out of tears.
381;One of the top 100 films of all times.
382;Another great film to come out from the South.
383;Plenty of debatable material for history classes, or simply a wonderful film to spend a quiet evening at home.
384;Some liberties taken from the book, but overall, a wonderful rendition of the story!
385;I recommend this movie for teens and up.
386;The source of the movie is the Pulitzer Prize novel of the same name by Harper Lee, one of the most beloved works of literature.
387;Its themes cover a wide range .
388;alan Pakula gives every detail of his production exquisite attention.
389;The screenplay by Horton Foote deftly trims details and enhances other aspects of the novel without changing its spirit.
390;The score by Elmer Bernstein moves the heart, especially in the opening sequence that perfectly captures the playful wonder of a child.
391;The direction by Robert Mulligan brings out the very best in his actors.
392;cinema has rarely assembled such a talented cast.
393;Mary Badham and Phillip Alford are two of the best child actors ever.
394;Robert Duvall, in his Hollywood debut, gives a riveting performance as a shy recluse, even though he barely speaks.
395;tO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD tells us that even in the confusing complexities of the real world, one can still persevere and make the world a better place.
396;This movie is cinema at its finest.
397;I bought this to watch with my 9 and 6 year old.
398;I remembered it from my childhood and knew it would be a thought provoking movie that I could discuss moral delemas with my kids as well as look at a change in times from how we live vs. how others have lived.
399;It displays the simple life where kids had to entertain themselves and use there imagination, which of course got them into trouble now and then.
400;This is one of my favorite movies and is great on blu ray!
401;One I will watch over and over againe.
402;Watched with son for his school project and found it obviously dated but the speech given by Gregory Peck in defense of his client was worth watching the whole movie.
403;Glad I watched this classic with my family and put it under our belt.
404;This movie is the best ever, it is just like the book.
405;I got my kids to watch the movie and they love watching it also.
406;I have read this book 3 times once in high school, as a young mother, and as a mature adult.
407;I loved it and enjoyed it every time.
408;As for the movie the actors are exceptional.
409;The children Gem and Scout we so fun to watch.
410;We introduced it to our children when they were young.
411;I love it's innocence and truth of the time.
412;It is so well written that I was captivated.
413;This book holds up well even after all these years.
414;It is a definite read for any one who enjoys a good read by a masterful author.
415;"I got this and 3 other movies particularly for my ""grand"" niece so that she would be exposed to the great film classics of yesteryear."
416;I rate this movie 5 stars!
417;This movie is in my top ten list!
418;A great movie and a great story to share with your children.
419;I've seen it a million times and will likely see it a million more!
420;Just saw it on the big screen a few weeks ago and it was like seeing it for the first time.
421;highly recommend that you see it on the big screen if you get a chance!
422;Atticus always my favorite stand up basic American decency on parade.
423;The twist is perfect and the depiction of a child's world
424;To Kill a Mockingbird is a real classic.
425;I have always loved this movie, and the book.
426;She also found the movie to be interesting.
427;keyed movie that is so well done, you just want everything to stop for a while after seeing it.
428;Soak up the movie, the town, the events, the music and the characters .
429;The one scene that captures the essence for me is the revealing of Boo Radley (Duvall) behind the door.
430;This movie is a view of small town America that is both real and idealized.
431;To Kill a Mockingbird is certainly destined to be a classic of both American literature and American film.
432;Finally I will discuss the continued question about this work, which is whether it is a book for children or adults.
433;harper Lee's novel continues to stimulate debate.
434;I know I read the book when I was in the eighth grade and found it to be wonderful.
435;but maybe it was fantastic because I was 14 years old and the moral clarity and wise heroism of Atticus Finch seems very right to my adolescent sense of justice.
436;The novel is full of wonderful experience and moral commentary as presented through the eyes of a 7 year old tom.
437;Twain recommended this style in fact pointing out that the hypocracy and odd motives of adults can be commented upon through nieve eyes with a sense of wonder and delightful humor.
438;the film, which captures poor rural Alabama perfectly, also was fantastic.
439;Gegory Peck was outstanding, as were all the actors.
440;The screen play is penetrating and tight, never letting the characters become cute country hicks.
441;Flannery O'Connor, the great writer, said that it amazed her that most adult readers didn't realize it was a children's book.
442;After a recent reviewing of the book and film, I find that the work actually has vast appeal to children, young adults, and adults.
443;I don't mean this to be avoidance of answering the question, but the work has multiple levels of depth and moral instruction relevant to any age.
444;It may in fact be very realistic to portray a character with clear moral bearings such as Atticus Finch, since such persons do in fact live in reality and I have been lucky enough in my life to know many such fine persons and I personally aspire to such moral character and strength.
445;This is the appeal of the adult reader/viewer for this classic work of American literature and film.
446;making for in the end it calls upon all of us, child or adult, to aspire to our own strength of character and courage for the sake of justice.
447;Superb acting, great plot, and it's in B&W, which seems to add to the allure.
448;An excellent movie with a compelling story, characters, setting.
449;The black and white format just adds to the drama.
450;If you have an evening, pick it up.
451;it is a quick read and a great Southern .
452;winning ageless novel To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the finest pieces of literature, past or present, ever composed.
453;The movie itself is truly amazing in every sense, and even the usage of black and white in mostly color pictures and TV make it even more superb.
454;"Perfect book, perfect film adaption
455;Wonderful special features, and lovely redone visuals.
456;Got it as a present for my Mother and she has greatly enjoyed it.
457;I was happy to find a 50th Anniversary Edition in Blu.
458;tech son absolutely loved it.
459;The picture and sound, etc., were all excellent.
460;making process and also some of their particular stories with each other.
461;I would recommend this movie to anyone who has read the book, or who is looking to read the book.
462;The movie did leave out several important parts of the book, but nonetheless, it is a great American classic.
463;This movie will set you back in time and make you sit on the edge of your seat!
464;I am sure injustice is happening somewhere even today!
465;We enjoyed the movie this time as much as we did the first time we saw it.
466;Here is a classic film about morality and prejudice that stands the test of time.
467;The 130 minute documentary, written and directed Charles Kiselyak, both discusses how the film was made and it's general literary elements.
468;The film is one of the most effectively edited documentaries I have seen, linking key scenes from Mockingbird with talking heads, still photos and black and white film taken in various localities across the south.
469;the documentary narration, written by Charles Kiselyak and read with great emotion by Mary Williams, is literary and quite sophisticated.
470;director Charles Kiselyak with the help of Harper Lee was able to get three residents to discuss their lives in Monroeville, Alabama.
471;She was thrilled with the director's plan to open the documentary with the first verse one of her favorite poems, William Blake's, Tyger: Tyger, Tyger burning bright, In the forests of the night"
472;I have seen this film more than 30 times and I still make new discoveries each time I watch it.
473;And this film deals with that matter on several levels.
474;It is, to my mind Gregory Peck's more memorable performance, embodying as he does the ideals by which we can only try to live.
475;And it was Robert Duvall's debut film performance as the spooky, seldom.
476;This is, in the truest sense, an American classic: affecting, powerful, and wonderfully faithful to the book.
477;Great person we were blessed to see his work and.
478;Great movie, but the books are ALWAYS better!
479;It arrived very fast, and she loves the product.
480;Gregory Peck offers what may be his definitive role (he won the Best.
481;Though slow in pace, the movie is never boring, and the picture it presents of the Deep South (Maycomb Co., Ala.) in the days before Martin Luther King is both fascinating and disturbing.
482;Robert Duvall, today one of our most respected actors, makes his first credited big.
483;"screen appearance (with never a word of dialogue) as ""Boo"" Radley, the mysterious and believed."
484;Awesome packaging from universal studios.
485;A classic movie to have in your collection.
486;Everyone in it is fantastic and it's a gripping film.
487;this is a timeless piece I always enjoy tripping back in time , and this show does that every time I watch it.
488;The movie is an excellent adaptation of a book that was way ahead of its time.
489;com lists COLOR as a special feature format of this collectors edition.
490;I think it is excellent as a black/white film but thought it would be interesting to see it in color.
491;winning honor for this film to be an acknowledgement of a long and fruitful career, rather than the individual performance.
492;winning novel, were no longer considered relevant.
493;What a joy to see this film's reputation grow on an annual basis.
494;I say completely, without a moment's hestitation, that Gregory Peck's performance as Atticus Finch is one of the greatest single performances in cinema history.
495;"It ranks with George C. Scott's performance in ""Patton,"" Robert De Niro's in ""The Raging Bull"" and Marlon Brando's in ""A Streetcar Named Desire."
496;Rarely has a role fit an actor so comfortably and believably as that of Atticus Finch with Gregory Peck.
497;The moment arrived, the cosmos came together, and Peck gave the ultimate performance of a lifetime.
498;In fact, it should be required viewing for all Americans.
499;This film ultimately personifies all that is strong and decent within our troubled culture.
500;His portrayal is a testament.
501;It is an example of what we can truly be if we tap the best within mankind.
502;wrinkled white suit, gentle smile, respectful of tradition.
503;This film, like the book, is exquistely timeless.
504;To kill a Mockingbird, is one of the greatest stories ever written.
505;It is a very moving story of the struggles between Blacks and Whites in the rural south.
506;This movie is one of the rare movies that actually tell the story as well as the book.
507;:) It depict racism very realistically and brought about great conversations with our kids ages 10, 12 and 14.
508;Though content is hard to digest, and parts of it are a little scarey for the younger kids, it is a real perspective of how prejudice people were and still can be.
509;To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the few examples where novel and movie for one really have something to say and where both versions are outstanding achievements in their own field.
510;Harper Lee's bestseller won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and the movie .
511;made with Lee's support and produced with the same love for the material .
512;received eight nominations for the Academy Award.
513;The film won three, including the Best Actor Award for Gregory Peck.
514;Finch has his two children to teach values of humanity, and these are based on compassion, courage and fighting for the right cause.
515;What makes this movie so special is that the happenings are seen through the eyes of the children rather than the adults, and thus the storytelling provides an unusual and fresh angle when we find ourselves stumbling into events and learn what's really at stake as the youngsters go along.
516;and it is a given that the viewer will walk away deeply moved by this movie.
517;the plot of the movie, told in a retrospective narration, is extraordinary and entirely in the spirit of the novel, evoking the full spectrum of emotions.
518;There's also no doubt about it that the acting is outstanding, not only as far as Peck is concerned but also the child actors, especially Mary Badham, really impress.
519;A lot of credit has to be given to the staff as they created the kind of environment to let the children blossom.
520;Also the black and white cinematography fits perfectly to the story and several scenes in the movie will stay in your mind for a very long time.
521;Yet I only discovered the movie version decades later, and it didn't disappoint and I learned to love the material even more.
522;especially the bonus features in this special edition are enlightening and make the experience whole.
523;A highly informative and yet entertaining commentary that stands high above comparable features.
524;Provides a lot of background information, not only how the movie was made but also what it meant back then and still means today.
525;The film also sheds light on the time and locations the characters of the movie lived in by via first hand accounts of folk who experienced it all themselves.
526;"A superb and touching documentary about Gregory Peck's life as an actor and father, especially dealing with the influence Harper Lee and ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" had on it."
527;A must see and indispensable supplement to the movie.
528;one of the best movies of the past century.
529;This film is about family, color of race, truth and redemption.
530;The Film also Win an Oscar for Best Art Direction.
531;set Decoration and Best Adapted Screenplay.
532;It was also Nominated for Best Supporting Actress:Mary Badham, Best Cinematography, Best Director, Best Score and Best Picture.
533;This film is leisurely Paced, flavorful film to others.
534;The movie, while not as good as the book, was still very interesting.
535;The story is one in which all the characters are able to learn something new about themselves as well as life.
536;I found the entire movie to be very intersting and it held my attention the whole time.
537;I highly recommend this movie to others.
538;As southern lawyer Atticus Finch, Peck garnered a Best Actor Oscar for his powerfully moving performance that, as one scene elicits, also commands a deep respect of the screen character.
539;The genius of the film, though, is its perspective of Peck's screen daughter, Scout.
540;Ranked the 34th best film ever by the American Film Institute, this one will remain always relevant as long as injustice based on discrimination exists.
541;wrenching, but the film as a whole it is truly a moving experience.
542;I have always loved this film, can't believe it is in it's 50th year.
543;Would highly recommend film, perfect addition to my collection.
544;"For some reason I thought it would look ""old"" but it looks sharp."
545;The story spans subjects of love, hate, tolerance and respect.
546;It is beautifully written with the story being told by one of the main characters.
547;This B/W film is simply one of the best movies ever made.
548;"Nominated for 8 Academy Awards, it and ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" dominated the 1962 Oscar race."
549;"it is a complex film of family and race relationships with none of the epic qualities that won ""Lawrence of Arabia"" the best picture/director Oscars."
550;But in terms of pure acting and story.
551;telling (Horton Foote won the best screenplay Oscar for his superior adaption of Harper Lee's novel), the movie cannot be improved.
552;Robert Duvall made his screen debut in his small but pivotal part of Boo Radley .
553;The film is worth repeated viewings for something new will be discovered.
554;It is still a powerful movie that has not been dated with the passage of the years.
555;One time where I enjoyed the movie as much as the book.
556;Calpurnia, the housekeeper in the Finch household, best represents the film's black stereotype.
557;Yes, it's okay for a good dad to impart important life lessons over the breakfast and dinner tables but shouldn't a good dad be concerned about his children's physical safety?Why does Atticus let his 6 year old daughter run around the neighborhood .
558;In my opinion, Atticus is truly over.
559;rated as the Good Dad.
560;It's the sort of film that appeals to those with very select tastes .
561;winning novels, or every black and white film, you're duty.
562;bound to take a look at it.
563;BUT, many scenes transcend that, and the final ten minutes will really surprise you.
564;Great packaging, deluxe and sturdy.
565;extras ranging from pretty good to excellent on Disc 1.
566;Love the 11 international mini.
567;"as an audience of the film, we are exposed to the necessity of pursuing virtue as human beings and what it really means and how important it is to have basic good manners in one's life
568;The magnificent performance of Mary Badham as the irrepressible Scout won her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress only to miss out to Patty Duke in her stunning role inThe Miracle WorkerConsidering both performances, Duke and Badham (both children) should have won a Joint Oscar as both were absolutely magnificent in their respective roles.
569;despite this film opening forty years ago, the story and performances continue to be a model for present day filmmaking.
570;beginning with a great story, a well adapted screenplay, a director who loves the project thus all in the crew give 100%, and the same basic example of virtue and integrity communicated in the novel and adapted for the screen: compassion, kindness, courage, respect and love.
571;truly one of the all time great films of the twentieth century.
572;something to show the children, something to learn.
573;Outstanding performance by the late, great Gregory Peck.
574;A timeless story that will touch the hearts of all that watch it.
575;There is absolutely nothing more that can be said.
576;Just watch the movie and enjoy it!
577;Gregory Peck won an Oscar for his wonderful performance as Atticus Finch, a lawyer in Alabama during the Depression.
578;It shows how kids adapt to very serious situations around them but manage to keep the innocence.
579;He shows us to stand true to our convictions no matter how hard that may seem.
580;Harper Lee's classic novel on acceptance and intolerance was beautifully transformed into a classic film with a performance that placed Gregory Peck permanently in the film pantheon.
581;Additionally the film has Horton Foote's observant script, Elmer Bernstein's finest score and a supporting cast (Brock Peters, Phiip Alford, as examples) all of whom mesh well.
582;excellent Kim Stanley is the uncredited narrator (Scout as a grown up).
583;The film deserves its reputation and has endured the test of time.
584;everyone has to see this movie.
585;it is the sweetest movie.
586;it's great to watch with family and the children are the best!
587;scout makes the cutest lil faces :) well i hope you take this into consideration!
588;Let's get this out of the way first: To Kill a Mockingbird is a great film in many ways.
589;It's based off one of the most revered novels of the 20th century, so it clearly has an interesting story and an important message.
590;It's characters are fleshed out, it features unforgettable performances from Gregory Peck and Brock Peters, a most unexpected debut of Robert Duvall, and it's powerfully directed by Robert Mulligan.
591;Both are classics, but if one wants a more complete and accomplished work, seek out the novel.
592;His sense of humor and down to earth style and seeing his family and other live interviews just validated my feelings for the actor and the man.
593;a great book and movie!!
594;This is a very good movie.
595;It is truly a classic.
596;This film is beautiful in its intent"
597;Also, Atticus' relationship with his children (played wonderfully by the two young actors in the film) is precious to see.
598;to me, the best part of the film is simply watching Gregory Peck and the two young actors who play his children.
599;Great film in what it tries to accomplish, but clumsy and convoluted (imo) in its execution.
600;The extra's make this worth the extra charge.
601;It is a tale of growing up in a society that doesn't practice what it preaches (pun intended).
602;It's the story of a man whose entire life boils down to the simplest of emotions, empathy.
603;why is it that a movie loved and universally praised can't be used as a blueprint for the society from which it came and today's society as well?
604;i don't know about anyone one else, but aside from my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Atticus Finch, fictitious though he may be, is a personal role model for my life, and has been since I first read the book in third grade.
605;As for the movie, they cast everyone perfectly.
606;a must read and must watch for everyone.
607;I'm honestly super surprised by how cheap this is.
608;I bought my copy and love it.
609;This was one of the first items I spotted and instantly got it.
610;I enjoy classic movies and this one is a must for any collector's library.
611;I recommend it to everyone who appreciates fine acting.
612;"Gregory Peckl said that this was the one movie of which he was very proud and humbled to have been in
613;This movie is about accepting others differences and being happy about your own.
614;The movie is poignant and thrilling and sad.
615;I remember watching it as a child and the rabid dog scene was so profoundly compelling but now it is really nothing at all.
616;Great movie to watch at least once a year and explain to your kids.
617;Released in 1962, this compelling black and white film is as relevant today as it was over 50 years ago.
618;The beautiful story of a young girl's coming of age in the deep south skilfully entwined with the social issues of the 1930s that sadly still inflict us today: prejudice based on race/color"
619;And of course, a brilliant performance by Gregory Peck in the role as Atticus Finch.
620;This is such a classic movie and I'm so happy it's now part of my collection!
621;Excellent film, I can watch this movie over and over.
622;This film will forever be a classic.
623;The film tells an intriguing story of the prejudices that crippled our society.
624;Everyone should see this film.
625;I have seen this movie many times in the past, but this version of the film brings out the best in the movie and completes make your senses delight in the literary masterpiece which is this film.
626;Not only does the story itself intrigue the viewer, but the acting is completely top rate and Gregory Peck alone is remarkable in his role (in my opinion, it was made for him).
627;ray provides but also on top of this all of the special features that have been provided for the viewer.
628;packed with so many behind the scenes as well as interesting tidbits that you would have never known about the movie.
629;I highly encourage you to get this version for yourself as it is definitely one to keep for all times!
630;Getting to watch movie afterwards was a special treat.
631;It is a wonderful tribute to Gregory Peck and company.
632;Great social film for studying our society.
633;This is an amazing story.
634;Rich in theme and and character development.
635;Greg Peck received an Oscar for his performance over those in competition for this Gold Standard.
636;The only book written by Pulitzer Prize winning author, Harper Lee's telling of her story made its way to the big screen and set the standard for great performances.
637;Watching this will more than entertain its viewers, it will enlighten them.

645;This movie is a classic, one of the best ever made.
646;This is easily one of the 10 best American films ever made.
647;That is, I suppose, what makes it so powerful: it walks the line behind the lazy summer days of Jem and Scout's childhood, and the hard truths of their father's courtroom drama.
648;TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD brings back the joys and the pains of childhood more accurately than any film I've ever seen.

708;I thought my son might enjoy it.
709;Happy to give this as a gift and the recipient was pleased to add this to their collection.
710;The film is a timeless classic!
711;This movie is one of the best period movies of it's time.
712;Gregory Peck is at his finest!
713;A must for everyone interested in segregation in the South.
714;This is a movie with a timeless message speaking to our humanity and integrity and the equal value of all people.
715;We loved revisiting this and would highly recommend its viewing by all!
716;Along with the book, this is a necessary watch.
717;One for the best films ever.
718;All of the actors/actresses are excellent.
719;This is a must watch film.

722;"To Kill a Mockingbird is the second best movie of 1962, next to ""Lawrence of Arabia"", and one of the best and most important movies of the 1960s."
723;Our son watched it with me the other day (he's 14) and he really liked it as well.
724;In recent years many of the movie collections are combined with interviews with the original cast.
725;One of my favorites is with Gregory Peck.
726;Peck often said that the role of Atticus Finch was his very favorite role in his long career as an actor.
727;Gregory Peck has always been one of my very favorite actors so this had great meaning for me to know that someone actually lead a principled life away from the stage.
728;the characters in the book are all very realistic for any community, not just a southern community.
729;I have enjoyed it throughout my life.
730;The screenplay and the movie is also pure Americana.
731;The movie was packaged well for shipping and in perfect condition when it arrived.
732;If you haven't watched the movie yet, I recommend it.
733;It is a great film and tells a great story.
734;Several performers gave Oscar worthy performances in this rendition of one of America's greatest novels.
735;An all time American Classic movie for all to see.
736;Clearly one of the best movies every made.
737;We were glad to find this really great film at such a good price to add to our video collection
738;I found it to be a mirror of our governance today.
739;This is my all time favorite.
740;My students love the reward of reading the book, knowing that they will get to view the movie following their final.
741;Ties my novel unit together nicely!
742;This is an excellent piece of literature with a timeless and thought provoking message!
743;Great book and movie to spark family discussion!
744;Rarely has a great classic of literature been so perfectly cast and so perfectly transformed to screen.
745;Harper Lee's nostalgic look at life in 1930's Alabama is a lazy walk in yesteryear that somehow gets hold of you and has you on the edge of your seat.
746;I read the book and watch the movie at least once a year and I still love it.
747;The characterizations were perfectly done in the book and very well imitated in the movie.
748;Gregory Peck makes the perfect Atticus and you are amazed at how well the children played the parts.
749;I'm not sure how they did it, but to restore and old movie and make it look as sharp and clean as this one is amazes me.
750;The sound and picture are absolutely brilliant on this Blu.
751;If you liked this movie, you will love it in Blu.
752;Do yourself a favor and experience this movie as it has always been meant to be seen.
753;This compelling actor played two of the most iconic characters in all of cinematic lore.
754;(And Peck played both roles in his own unique, creative style.)
755;With respect to Atticus Finch, Peck merely enhances an extraordinarily good film, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, based on Harper Lee's phenomenal and timelessnovel.
756;"I've read the book and seen the movie, many times
757;In particular, the film works marvelously, for several reasons.
758;for openers, Horton Foote penned a riveting screenplay, while director Robert Mulligan brings Lee's novel to vivid life.
759;The film is blessed with very believable child actors in Mary Badham (Scout) and Phillip Alford (Jem), who both made their silver screen debuts.
760;The supporting cast is spectacular, including a grisly, disheveled James Anderson playing villain Bob Ewell and a very young Robert Duvall playing reclusive Boo Radley.
761;Add to that Peck's commanding performance as a widowed lawyer and father of two children in the Jim Crow South during the Great Depression, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a movie for the ages.
762;Highly recommended for all movie collectors and cinema buffs.
763;Thought provoking, poignant and utterly captivating.
764;A favorite generational share and must have for every home video library.
765;The character of Atticus Finch quietly parsed the poverty and ignorance of his town with educated intelligence and the soul of a good man .
766;the casting, acting, photography, and musical score bring Harper Lee's original story to life.
767;The black and white film is perfectly fitting.
768;Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus was his very best work.
769;I still watch him in awe.
770;This movie brings back so many memories of my own childhood.
771;The daily antics of childhood's long summer days are portrayed with simple ease and grace.
772;The part played by Gregory Peck was played with such integrity and is a splendid thing to watch especially with children as they are not too often afforded the opportunity to see such a role model as this.
773;This movie makes it so easy to remember.
774;I love to set the mood when I watch this movie.
775;I'll remember it always as I hope my children and yours will too.
776;This is a great movie.
777;I feel a bit taken however, since the description of the disk lists it as """"widescreen"""" 1.85:1."""
778;Of course the movie arrived in wonderful condition.
779;We love the movie and watch it often.
780;Arrive on time and in perfect condition.
781;I saw this movie many times, and will pass it along to the younger generation.
782;I have always loved this movie, ever since it came out on TV when I was a child.
783;Gregory Peck is one of my favorite actors.
784;Also this was an anniversary edition with lots of extra stuff.
785;funny to hear about all the trouble they had behind the scenes, but how much fun it was doing the film to begin with.
786;my mother was very happy to have this, and she enjoyed it alotshe was very pleased to got this as a mothers day gift.
787;I had to read the novel in High School but found the film to add to my enjoyment.
788;Gregory Peck was a great actor!
789;As an educator it is always great to have a movie when the book is finish for compare and contrast.
790;To Kill a Mockingbird was an outstanding book which .
791;was made into an outstanding movie.
792;Gregory Peck won an Academy Award for his superb performance as southern lawyer, Atticus Finch, who controversially defends a black man unjustly accused of molesting a white girl.
793;Peck, a consistently fine actor, has frankly stated that this was his favorite role, and his performance is one of the most outstanding even given on film.
794;including those portraying his two children .
795;were also quite good and helped make this one of the greatest movies ever made.
796;as a professional, as a citizen, and as a father.
797;it is to the model set by my own father and to the portrayal of Atticus Finch in this film that I owe much of what has been good in the fulfillment of my duty to my community, to my patients, and to the children and grandchildren who were born into my responsibility.
798;if there is anything solid or valuable in the moral character of the male American Baby Boomer, it is attributable in at least some small way to the influence of this movie and the expectations it impressed upon us, consciously or unconsciously, in the darkened movie theaters of 1962 and 1963.
799;It is such a great movie that any sad thing that happens is for a reason and a teaching tool.
800;It's such a classic and writing a review can never do enough justice for this movie.
801;Rarely does Hollywood capture the essence and beauty of a novel.
802;This movie is a beautiful rendition of the best American novel ever written!
803;I seldom find a movie version of a story that is at least as good as the book in which it's based, but To Kill A Mockingbird is a rare exception: the film is, if possible, even better than the book.
804;Gregory Peck is superb here as the lawyer Atticus Finch, an everyman thrown into the role of a hero of sorts among his prejudiced community.
805;The film gives a tender but penetrating portrayal of the relationship between the widowed father and his children, of the children and the mysterious Boo, and of a community divided by hate.
806;that this is one of the classiest people ever to hit Hollywood.
807;Through the eyes of his wife, children, and adoring fans, this documentary allows you to get to know the real Gregory Peck, and I truly lament that the world has lost such a beautiful person.
808;May his wonderful movies keep his memory alive forever.
809;superb acting, though as has been noted Peck does come off seeming a bit too stiff.
810;And the human relationships that included Boo the man that saved the children.
811;I knew when I first watched this movie it was one of the best.
812;There are just so few better stories.
813;everyone should see this movie at least once in their lives.
814;This wonderful adaptation of Harper Lee's classic novel is a film of great dignity, a Norman Rockwell painting come to life.
815;"In the end, those of us who do mature find that there is often beauty on the other side of that mysterious door
816;On the contrary, it's one of the film's surprising strengths.
817;Mary Badham as Scout and Phillip Alford as Jem are utterly convincing as the children that many of us got to know in school.
818;deserved Oscar for his depiction of Atticus Finch "
819;Peck's closing argument to the jury is riveting, and is a stellar example of on.
820;There is inspiration and hope to be found here, a transcendence of time that few films can match.
821;Besides providing lovers of this work with a clean, sharp video transfer, we are treated to a beautiful making of documentary and given a decent director's commentary.
822;My memories did not betray me, for this is just as enchanting and moving a film as I remembered it to be.
823;Plus, there is a good commentary track and very in.
824;"documentary uses the film as a starting point from which to discuss the background era in which the film is set
825;so, you already know how great this film is and how great Gregory Peck is in it.
826;A 5 star effort all the way!
827;In other words, this is a timeless piece.
828;Rarely has a film so accurately captured the emotional consequences of human fallibility steadfastly within the grip of racial intolerance.
829;Facing great odds, Finch attempts to discredit Mayella on the stand, but Tom's sympathetic testimony proves to be his own undoing.
830;gregory Peck gives his career.
831;best performance as Finch, bringing the necessary human.
832;It's inspiring work from a great screen legend.
833;Mary Badham is wonderful as the inquisitive Scout never veering off toward precociousness in her acting, and almost as good is Philip Alford as Jem.
834;looking Robert Duvall makes his film debut as """"Boo"""" Radley, making his late appearance in the film impactful."""
835;white cinematography is effectively evocative.
836;This masterwork is as good as family films get.
837;Beyond providing an excellent print and audio transfer, the first disc contains a deeply insightful commentary track with full participation from Mulligan and the late producer, Alan J. Pakula, a superb director in his own right.
838;There is also video footage of Peck's acceptance speech when he won the 1962 Best Actor Oscar for his role, his quite touching speech when he received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, a tribute from his daughter Cecilia, a brief 1999 interview with the seldom.
839;the second disc offers a fascinating, ninety.
840;"minute 1998 documentary, ""Fearful Symmetry"", filmed effectively in black."
841;It includes interviews with Peck, Badham, Alford, Pakula, Mulligan, Foote and Bernstein, and paints a remarkably penetrating story of the production.
842;"There is a second feature, 1999's ""A Conversation with Gregory Peck"", directed by famed documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple, which is actually a full."
843;This is one of my all time favorite films.
844;By all means, if you love this film you need to own it in blue ray.
845;it's a GREAT movie if you can actually get it to play.
846;With outstanding performances from all the actors, especially Gregory Peck.
847;The children in the film also give wonderful performances and I think overall it's one of the best movies ever made.
848;The story is a classic and the film has been a classic for years re: social injustice,.
849;The performances are great Gregory Peck and Robert Duvall are excellent in the roles and I wanted the film so that my sons could experience it and I have already shared it with my friends.
850;i had read the book first,and was anxious to see it on film.
851;i think this is Mr. peck's finest film.
852;the dignity and grace he instills in the character of Atticus is inspiring.
853;and it inspired a whole generation of kids(I was 14 when it came out)who turned out to be social workers,lawyers,and activists in the fight for equal rights.
854;this is one of the best films you will ever have the privilege to see.
855;I have seen the movie many times and have enjoyed it.
856;The recipient was very pleased with my selection.
857;I really enjoy doing business with Amazon.
858;It makes shopping on line convenient and they have a variety of selections.
859;Outstanding performances of an iconic American novel!
860;My kids were riveted watching this movie.
861;it holds up so well over time and the themes are universal and ageless.
862;I loved this book ever since I read it in my 9th grade English class eons ago.
863;Gregory Peck is an impeccable actor.
864;he has class, distinction and great artistic expression.
865;The movie (also the book) presents an important part of US history in a way that makes it easy to comprehend or understand for younger audiences.
866;The movie is not violent but instead focuses on the legal aspects of racial segregation in the US and approaches them in an intelligent way.
867;Yes, it may be aged now but it's definitely worth the watch!
868;there are several good messages that all can learn by.
869;"This is true entertainment
870;Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is a beautiful and extraordinarily intelligent novel, and this is a beautiful and extraordinarily intelligent adaptation.
871;Almost everything about this film is flawless.
872;From the script and the acting, to the cinematography to the music, it deserves its status as a classic monumental film.
873;It's a stunning performance, and this performance alone will never become extinct in the legacies of motion pictures.
874;to Kill A Mockingbird stands on its own as a classic film.
875;motion opening and one of the best film scores I have ever heard, you know that this will be a film to remember for many years.
876;Lastly, and in a smaller form, it is a film about redemption.
877;It's pretty simple, but powerful stuff.
878;what I think is really distinct about this film is that the children's characterizations are treated with such sensitivity.
879;It could become easy to treat the daily nuances of a child's imagination and naivite as something silly or unimportant.
880;Their characters are aided by fantastic performances by the young actors, Mary Badham and Philip Adford.
881;Gregory Peck gives one of the most memorable performances I can imagine.
882;His portrayal is understated and touching, eventually leading up to his character's fierce determination in the final courtroom scene, where he lays out the injustices that have plagued his client.
883;It's one of the finest courtroom scenes in American film history, encapsulating both the strength of what the justice system of America represents and also portraying the fervent racial tensions that were dividing the nation at the time of the film's release (1962).
884;Some of the most poignant moments in the film were so subtle.
885;It was a really sensitive visual statement that conveyed a powerful sentiment about the perpetual state of race in America.
886;And I was crying big.
887;And the final scene, in which we find out the true personality of Boo Radley, was really suprising and touching.
888;It really makes you think about the how extraordinary the human spirit can be, and how making snap judgements about other people really doesn't pay off in the end.
889;The product came in a timely manner, and in excellent condtion.
890;Wonderful acting/good reflection of book.
891;But I watched it with new eyes .
892;It is an amazing movie .
893;pure simple with a powerful message.
894;This is a wonderful, wonderful movie!
895;That Oscar was well deserved!
896;And the bonuses are great too .
897;When you watch Gregory Peck playing Atticus Finch, he is so natural in the role, that you sense that he was born to play this role.
898;this film's screenplay adaptation of Harper Lee's book concentrates mainly on the courtroom scenes.
899;Though shot in black and white this does not rob the film of it's impact, indeed I felt the lack of colour gives the film a raw power all of its own.
900;At the Oscar ceremony Gregory Peck at long last received his highly deserved Oscar.
901;A fitting tribute to a man that many people have come to view as Atticus Finch himself.
902;very graping and powerful, well made in so many ways.
903;The family unit, the extended family, the dysfunctional family, the good and bad neighbor mix and the pressing points of idealism and the path of doing what's in your power to do.
904;that Scout burst on almsot every scence, in her wonder and take on the world and good ole Jem, following in the shadow of Actticu, courageous, bold, pushing the edge, defining acts and choices, a Mavrick of sorts.
905;I'd read Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird as a child, but seeing it brought to life through the medium of film was a wonderful new experience.
906;The acting, even of the children, is excellent.
907;A moving story following a young girl's life in segregated America during the Great Depression, To Kill a Mockingbird reminds us to rise above prejudice by showing us the problems it causes and also what it means to rise above them.
908;If you haven't seen this movie, you NEED to!
909;It has been years since Ive seen this movie and it is still a great movie.
910;Nice clear picture, glad they didnt colorize it.
911;This is one of those stories you should see many times throughout your life, as your own experiences will change your viewing capacity.
912;The images that I saw in my mind while reading the book are clearly adapted in this movie and it is a wonder.
913;I've watched this now with my son, and will watch it again when he gives me a grandson.
914;My favorite movie and my favorite scenes in a movie of all time.
915;Has all of the right massages.
916;One of the best movies ever done with one of the best actors ever to act.
917;To Kill a Mockingbird is a powerful, hugely well.
918;acted film that should be on everyone's Top Ten and should be in every film collection.
919;The book took me for a ride as a child, one of those rare books we were made to read in school that I could not put down"
920;"introduced us, also, to Robert Duvall, as he just began his film career
921;The `5.1 sound option' alone is worth upgrading to the """"Legacy Series Edition"""" and many fans will appreciate the new `extras' included on the new version."""
922;To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless classic, displayed in breathtaking imaginative and visual beauty whether you read the book or watch the movie.
923;Either genre brings to life the old south, its charm, its bigotry, its prejudice, its fear of the unknown, and ultimately its triumph of the human soul.
924;there is a beauty to both the movie and the book which seems to change as one grows older.
925;Scout's innocence reminds adults of their moral code and conduct in the movie, the book, and (surprisingly) in real life.
926;"She is able to center us on our own humanity as is witnessed in many scenes
927;Scout and Jem's journey is also our journey, one in which we all make.
928;Harper Lee's classic novel brought to life with Gregory Peck in the lead role of Atticus Finch.
929;As Atticus, he displays the kind of lawyer that you would want if you ever had to go to trial for anything.
930;He also displays a pretty good example to all us fathers on how to deal with our children.
931;There are some very good ideologies displayed in this movie.
932;This is a very satisfying movie that everyone, including your children, should watch.
933;The movie really hits home in alot of areas and is well worth adding to your movie library.
934;Adapted from the famous novel this film holds its own thanks to a stellar portrayal of Atticus Finch by Gregory Peck who embodied one of the most heroic screen personas because of his humility, his quiet strength, and his ability to understand others.
935;Adapted from Harper Lee's classic, this film has a lot of things going for it.
936;This includes a touching story and on of the greatest heroes of all time.
937;The only man willing to defend Tom Robinson is Atticus because he feels it is the right thing to do.
938;In probably his greatest performance, Gregory Peck portrayed a quiet yet courageous man, Lee had likened to her father.
939;Instantly we are drawn to this well.
940;It is easy to see why this film resonates with the vast majority who see it, and why it consistently gets mentioned with being one of the 100 best films of all time.
941;It is a rarity to have a film live up to a book, not only in its adaptation, but also how we visualize the story taking place.
942;Producer (Alan J. Pakula) and director (Robert Mulligan) put together a perfect version of Harper Lee's novel, from the mood, music score, cinematography, and cast, who all personify the characters in the book.
943;Gregory Peck was a perfect fit for Atticus Finch, as his taciturn manner, his stoic mood, and his unflinching attitude towards his principles is depicted with such precision.
944;The young children cast as Scout and Jem also give fine performances.
945;the film itself explores the theme of racial injustice and conflict in the South, but also the essence of believing and doing something because it is the right thing to do, and sticking with it until the end.
946;Jem and Scout experience a coming of age"
947;Also included is a fantastic documentary which examines the making of the film, as well as interviews with several of the actors, such as Gregory Peck.
948;In my school production I played Mayella, and I love her scene in the movie.
949;I really love the bonus disc that comes with it too.
950;It gives you an inside look on life in Maycomb County.
951;gregory peck was absolutely wonderful as atticus finch!
952;he deservedly won the oscar for best actor for that performance.
953;ray edtions of this wonderful movie.
954;All actors are outstanding, and of course Gregory Peck's understating acting is truly exceptional.
955;Not to mention the very brief, breathtaking appearence by Robert Duvall at the end of the movie.
956;Elmer Berstein's score is a true classic, simply marvelous.
957;"I just don't understand the obsession for getting rid of the celulloid grain, which was a natural part of movies for many decades
958;But it does seem Universal is getting pretty good at spoiling wonderful movies.
959;They are even proud of removing the natural celulloid grain, and, gee, that is really upsettting!!
960;Having read the book twice and now watching the film, it's nice to see that the film has actually done justice to the book in that it's successful in bringing out the actual message of innocence lost and about the difference between right and wrong, good and evil as seen from the point of view of 3 children and specifically the little girl Scout.
961;We all naturally love to support the underdog and this film tells the story of Atticus fighting for justice and teaching his kids as he does so by his actions as well as his words.
962;crafted film with excellent acting and an excellent screenplay.
963;Until that time, we can do no better than to sit down and read the book and then watch this perfect movie adaptation.
964;there are other great books and movies that cover the depression years in America.
965;Grapes of Wrath comes to mind.
966;Coming to the screen as it did during the rising cauldron of the Civil Rights movement, this film was a perfect mirror for the haunting specter that refused to shed its shadow over the south.
967;the audience watching this film in 1962 was familiar with prejudice but rarely had it seen a white man treat an African American with respect and a resolute commitment to seeking justice.
968;There are other sinister themes that rise to the surface.
969;the richness of the story gives depth and detail to the lives of Atticus Finch and his fiercely independent children as they explore their lives.
970;With several subplots swirling around the main trial, the audience is given constant stimulation in vivid colors of human drama.
971;Shot in black and white and blessed with a superb script, one of the greatest male actors in the English speaking world, a sublime musical score by Elmer Bernstein, two child actors who were so natural that they became Atticus's children in a real way.
972;this film is iconic in American cinema and for so many good reasons.
973;Perhaps Gregory Peck's greatest role, this film is unforgettable and has taken on a tinge of greatness that is entirely worthy of its craft.
974;If you must own one Peck film, this is the one.
975;It's been years since I first saw this movie, and I was so impressed with the acting, and of course the classical historical tale about growing up in the South in the 1950s.
976;Every actor gives a flawless performance.
977;Atticus Finch is Gregory Peck's finest roll and his performance lives up to character.
978;All the children are simply amazing.
979;Ms. Paxton draws together an astounding collection of emotions and releases them in one to the most intense and frightening performances I have seen in any film.
980;I remember seeing the film as a pre.
981;teen (when it was new), and Ms. Paxton's anguished, screaming face is the image that is most vividly burned in my memory.
982;There is clearly a very specific artistic reason Robert Mulligan chose black and white.
983;He made the right choice.
984;The sense of the dusty, dry, poor depression era is beautifully reinforced by the black and white presentation.
985;but the most amazing review was one person that said """"Racism still serves a purpose."""""""
986;Anybody (particularly any American) who can appreciate the finer things in life, and has any sensitivity to the complexities of human society, should watch this film.
987;And it stands up well to repeat viewing, as does any truly classic work of great art.
988;Following the recommendation of my oldest teenage son (a required class reading), I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it lived up to all my expectations.
989;I would recommend it to young and older readers as it spans generations with inspiration borne of commonplace strife woven into intriguing life lessons.
990;Great Classic, A Must See for all ages from very old to very young.
991;This book remains a classic.
992;It was poignant at the time and remains relevant today.
993;what can you say about a classic like this.
994;either you like it or you don't but is it well done
995;Set during a time of innocence and hardship (the Great Depression), this is a wonderful story.
996;This movie was a great movie.
997;One of the best movies of all time.
998;Excellent story, excellent acting, and excellent message.
999;You will fall in love with Atticus and his family all over again.
1000;Perhaps, this film is Gregory Peck's best performance of his illustrious career.
1001;It is also a favorite movie of many people in the legal profession.
1002;look no further than this film for the full measure of his talent, and a good glimpse at the kind of man he was in real life.
1003;While mortal in life, he is immortal in film.
1004;"The picture is beautiful, the sound is good, the ""making."
1005;"of"" retrospective is wonderful ."
1006;a must for your film library!
1007;It is as fine a two.
1008;hour distillation of Harper Lee's great American novel as you could ever ask for .
1009;a beautiful, elegant film that exactly captures the spirit and essence of time and place and character.
1010;Fabulous direction, photography, editing, writing, acting, and music come together seamlessly in a perfect, tight fabric.
1011;It is an astounding achievement in screenplay based on such a novel.
1012;Of course the novel is far better, more complete, but it is a great film on its own merits.
1013;"She shows us her disappointment in and revulsion of aspects of her white Southern heritage, while at the same time showing us her great pride in a culture that is so rich and so beautiful when it throws off the ugly cloak of hatred and discrimination (take note, all ye ""proud"" wavers of the Confederate battle flag)."
1014;They and I love it and are glad we watched it.
1015;As others have so adeptly pointed out, To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic American movie made from a classic American novel.
1016;If you already know and love this move, this presentation of it is unparalled.
1017;If you haven't seen it or if you haven't seen it in a long, long time, I assure you that are going to love it.
1018;A classic for all times.
1019;I want to share this with my granddaughter when she is old enough to understand it.
1020;A great classic that never loses it charm.
1021;Thank you Mr. Peck for being the best at what you do.
1022;I gave it as a gift.
1023;The person receiving it was very happy and thrilled to get it.
1024;One of his favorite movies.
1025;Everyone can relate to this magnificent story!
1026;"This movie belongs to the ""father knows best"" category."
1027;He braves the wrath of the town by giving the man an honest and competent defense and tries to get him acquitted.
1028;Having never read the book in high school or seen the movie I have to say I was surprised by it.
1029;My son had to read the book for his English class and I thought I would also read it to see what it was about.
1030;No wonder this is a classic.
1031;I was surprised that a book written in the early 60's that was based on a story in the 1930's could still seem like something that just happened yesterday.
1032;Some people will write reviews and tell you the whole story, but this a story that you need to see for yourself.
1033;I really think people should read the book first and then enjoy the movie.
1034;This is a story that everyone should know and for anyone who has read the book or seen the movie, you need to share this with your family and friends.
1035;This movie isn't old, it's classic.
1036;prize winning, bestselling novel by the same name, this original film is a good rendering of the book.
1037;Gregory Peck is fantastic in the role of Atticus Finch and you'll even spot a young Robert Duvall in his big.
1038;admittedly, the effects are dated compared to today's movies, but if you want to see the book come to life, this is a fine version.
1039;of course, the book is still better.
1040;But if you have the time, you really should read the book instead . . . the film has cut a lot of the novel's fine nuances!
1041;Duckie and I decided to begin watching the best movies.
1042;This was the first and it was a grand experience.
1043;Peck is magnificent in this film.
1044;I always loved his acting.
1045;This is a great movie.
1046;I read the book in seventh grade and I love this movie.
1047;I reccomend this movie to everyone.
1048;i am very well pleased with my AMAZON order!
1049;Great movie you want to watch over and over.
1050;Seller was fair with price and great with delivery.
1051;I had seen this movie many years ago and was happy to find it for an affordable price on Amazon.
1052;This is an excellent movie, thought.
1053;I would recommend this to anyone.
1054;I saw that it washaving an anniversary of 50 years,and thought it was about time I did both.
1055;I am glad I was able to watch it with outdistractions.
1056;Movies can entertain us, and they can sometimes make you think.
1057;Every once in a while, they can have an influence that goes beyond that.
1058;time favorite movie (and novel) and the reason I went to law school.
1059;After more than half a century, Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch still stands as a towering figure of decency, integrity and courage that we should all seek to emulate.
1060;Now more than ever, it seems we should all go back and watch it again for the first time.
1061;"To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the finest stories ever put on film
1062;But please note that my five.
1063;But the movie itself deserves the highest rating I can give it.
1064;It is a cinematic masterpiece that everyone ought to see.
1065;The portrait that Lee paints of life in the Depression.
1066;She is able to honestly portray the hardships of poverty and the evils of racism that she witnessed as a child without ever crossing the line into caricature, and without in any way undermining her nostalgic portrayal of the magical innocence of childhood.
1067;suited to be adapted for the silver screen, it was made into a major motion picture the following year, with one of the biggest names in Hollywood, Gregory Peck, as its star.
1068;But we are fortunate that the talented screenwriter, Horton Foote, was able to find the essence of the story in Harper Lee's novel and turn it into a brilliant screenplay.
1069;There are few people I can think of .
1070;He represents, at least in my view, the ideal father, the ideal lawyer, the ideal citizen, the ideal gentleman, and perhaps even the ideal human being.
1071;As a father, he sets a good example for his children, treats them with respect and kindness, nurtures them, allows them a measure of independence, encourages their curiosity, answers their questions as honestly as he can, tries his best to instill in them the right values, and gently explains things to them rather than lecturing them or yelling at them.
1072;As a lawyer, he has the highest possible standards of ethics and integrity, genuine compassion for his clients, a non.
1073;controlled, stalwart, courageous, and polite.
1074;And, as a human being, he is virtuous, kind, empathetic, hopeful, and wise.
1075;Not only is it a good story, with wonderful characters and a fascinating setting"
1076;You've simply got to see it for yourself.
1077;"The documentary ""Fearful Symmetry"", which tells the story of the real."
1078;life people and places behind the novel, and how the novel was turned into a movie, is pretty interesting.
1079;Great read from a one time author.
1080;I liked the book and try and capture some sytleistic form from Ms. Lee's writing.
1081;I loved the experience of entering that ideal family's world, especially the vivid atmosphere of the children's daily life in their town and era, and the subtle ways the children are led to discover the truth about some of their mysterious neighbors.
1082;at the end the way the viewer, through the children's eyes, himself discovers such a truth and experiences with them a moment of revelation.
1083;"The bending of rules at the end to protect one such mockingbird is utterly right and is justice
1084;it is to me a nearly perfect film adaptation, capturing the book's mood and spirit and meaning exactly.
1085;Both the book and the movie are very well done.
1086;~This is arguably the finest motion picture ever made about the Vision called America.
1087;It is an idealist recreation of small.
1088;town and rural United States.
1089;It explains the Great Depression, especially in the South, in a way that makes that ~ rendering of her book, its time, place and people.
1090;Fatherhood has never been so splendidly delineated, childhood so perceptively depicted, bigotry so thoroughly ~ see in the superb opening credits, each item being carefully taken from its place in an old cigar box.
1091;And finally, in the closing moments, we connect the title to the basis of this story's morality, much as Atticus Finch tells it to his son, Jem, when presenting him with a small.
1092;~ vision worth living up to, and seeing over and over.
1093;Peck won Best Actor, and Horton Foote best screenplay writer.
1094;The film won the British Oscar .
1095;for best foreign film, and Alan Pakula won BAFTA's award as best director of a foreign film.
1096;I use their media a lot and it was very handy for the convenience of how easy it is easy to access Amazon.
1097;I am mad at apple so this just works out fine.
1098;I enjoyed the movie very much.
1099;The acting was pretty good and it built up the suspense well.
1100;It also was described that the disc was in very good condition, which it was not.
1101;A true masterpiece that should be required reading by ever high school literature department in the Nation.
1102;highly recommended for everyone old enough to understand its message.
1103;I read this book over the summer and it is wonderful!
1104;The movie is a wonderful movie as well and it is one I would recommend to you, whether you have read the book or not!
1105;This is a timeless classic.
1106;The actors in this movie are excellent and it is a great movie to watch any time!
1107;It has always been one of my favorites.
1108;I bought this because I wanted to watch it with my 11 year old daughter.
1109;it opened up some very good dialogue about a lot of things.
1110;This is one of my favorite movies.
1111;Scout has always been my favorite character.
1112;If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made.
1113;I bought this movie on recommendation, never having seen it.
1114;this may be one of the finest films ever made.
1115;This great classic shows Gregory Peck at his best.
1116;Every character in the film is perfectly cast, and this is another case where the book was followed extremely well.
1117;I love to watch this film again and again.
1118;Harper Lee must have been proud when this came out.
1119;Even all these years later both the book and the movie are movie and in their own right: timeless.
1120;The movie and the book are wonderful, a true story and Gregory Peck gives the movie the right touch of being a true father, an honest man, a very good lawyer and peace [fairness to all].
1121;a Must See for all ages to learn about the time when the black people and women had no rights at all.
1122;Gregory Peck has been one of my favorite actors for a long, long time.
1123;I loved he and Brock Peters in this unforgettable classic.
1124;His character is an inspiration to all.
1125;Great writing, a wonderful story and tremendous acting all around.
1126;You can't beat this one and you will enjoy it.
1127;(I suspect, young reader, that you have succeeded far beyond Harper Lee.)
1128;or your life, which is what makes the portrait of Atticus Finch a true profile in courage, a Southern Gothic version of Sir Thomas Moore in """"A Man For All Seasons."""
1129;"To be fair, we should take a glimpse around several essential films in the recent past which depicted with notable crudeness this sensible theme
1130;The allusive metaphors to nocturnal and spectral visions are eloquent testimonies of the tenseness at the verge of the boiling point.
1131;Interviews with actors, writers, and set designers many years after this film was produced are extremely interesting and give added value to a great movie.
1132;It was great to get to watch the movie with him.
1133;The extra bonus features were a great bonus.
1134;It's simply a perfect film on every level.
1135;Deep, funny, literary, charming, haunting, frightening, mysterious, compassionate, graceful, hopeful.
1136;It carries the all the weight of adulthood and all the magic of childhood, and encompasses our darkest demons and our brightest angels.
1137;Although this is Peck's performance of a lifetime .
1138;all the character portrayals are spot on, especially the children.
1139;If this isn't enough, the wonderful music and cinematography make it an over.
1140;I see something new each time I watch it.
1141;A classic right from the start.
1142;This is the great American novel brought to the screen!!
1143;It deserves all the acolades it has received and more!!
1144;This story will truly stir your heart!!
1145;I love classics, Black and White Films and even slow paced Hitchcock films.
1146;wIth all the great reviews (due mainly because its a classic) will have you thinking this must be an amazing black and white film!Well if you expect that, especially with todays fast paced films where the camera cant stand still for seconds on a character, you will find this film unbelievably boring.
1147;This is one of the best book to movie adaptations I have ever seen.
1148;i first saw it as a child and 'Atticus Finch' set the bar so high as to what it meant to truly be a man that I don't think any living person will ever be able to match it.
1149;humility, honor, dignity, truth, integrity, justice, compassion, bravery and love.
1150;every moment of this film is executed with complete integrity and every actor, most remarkably the children, is to be commended.
1151;It is easy to see why so many attorneys will tell you that this film made them take up law.
1152;A proud and fitting legacy from a truly remarkable actor.
1153;This movie is one of my all time favorites.
1154;Now, I have it with me always and close to my heart.
1155;What is interesting is how ahead of its time it was.
1156;Even my daughters who cringe when you ask them to watch something in black and white managed to be captivated.
1157;Love that young Robert Duvall.
1158;The courtroom drama is quite good, but disproportionately emphasized, with the result that the simple charm and poignancy of the childhood narration is lost.
1159;its real acting andyou will watch this over and over again.
1160;this was a great price and arrived very quickly!
1161;Just a good oldie timey story.
1162;Will probably look at it 2.4 times a year.
1163;When I saw the film, I was first impressed on how up to date the production was.
1164;I was, of course, impressed with both the directing and acting.
1165;There is a sensitivity that underscores everything.
1166;Many many reactions are subtle.
1167;The pace is always moving, Camera angles portray strengths and weaknesses.
1168;Warm and insightful it was, and always interesting.
1169;i would recommend this movie to anyone with a hunger for good film.
1170;A simple story well told"
1171;I think it deserves a high rating because of that .
1172;it is simply and quietly a really good story well told.
1173;This is another rendition of an American classic.
1174;She watched it as a teenager, my wife watched it as a teacher and I watched it as a lawyer and, for tonight, at least, a part.
1175;No matter how often you have watched this in the past, you will find something new to admire when you watch it again.
1176;It started with the gift of Harper Lee's magical book, a gift to literature., indeed.
1177;Then came the movie, a gift to cinema that withstands the test of time.
1178;just look at the opening credits, quite possibly one of the most ingenious and modern looking segments in cinema over the last forty years.
1179;It's simplicity absolutely captures the film, while setting the magical mystery on its course, the world of children in a box.
1180;"then move on to Gregory Peck's most moving, strong, amazing performance
1181;His dignity shines through a dignified role.
1182;and then there are the kids, two unknowns, who do their best acting by just being themselves.
1183;Mary Badham is absolutely charming and stunning in her innocent portrayal of a terribly difficult role.
1184;but what shines most is the story.
1185;This movie captures the racial tentions in small town south.
1186;This is one of the best films ever made.
1187;A true classic with a poignant message accompanied by outstanding acting.
1188;we both loved it and she's become a huge Gregory Peck fan!
1189;My grandchildren found it very interesting.
1190;Great cast lead by Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch who won the oscar for best actor.
1191;I have lost count how mant times I have seen this movie but it is for sure the one movie I have seen the most.
1192;Atticus does a wonderful job of showing Tom could not have committed what he is accused of.
1193;A great speech which I feel shows Gregory Peck at his absolute best as an actor.
1194;There are many other outstanding scenes in the movie.
1195;You just got to take the time to watch this if the chance ever arrives.
1196;To Kill A Mockingbird just relies on human emotion and the power of the spoken word.
1197;Give it a chance however and I think you will get caught up in this movie.
1198;Set in a small town with racial divides there is a gem.
1199;a man who lives by conviction coupled by wisdom.
1200;It goes without saying that this movie is very important as a portrayal of how AWFUL bigotry was (and still is), especially in the south.
1201;I knew some pretty detestable white people, and I knew some very kind, loving, smart black people.
1202;The movie was a fine portrayal of how people thought in those days.
1203;A wonderful movie that brought back memories of what it was like.
1204;My family love this old black and white movie.
1205;With many movies, the blu.
1206;ray, was like a whole new experience.
1207;The depth of the tones in black and white, sets it apart from many color movies.
1208;The sound was crisp and clear, plus all the """"extras"""" were really extras worth watching."""
1209;It's totally worth every penny!
1210;got here just in tome for movie night, thanks for the speedy service and actually having a movie still wrapped in plastic.
1211;Better than most contemporary films, the action is developed by the actors and the writer.
1212;Great film with an powerful message.
1213;The camera work and the timing help build the story.
1214;This video has been cleaned up and can be enjoyed by a new generation.
1215;The interviews in the extras add a lot of insight into how major this work was to produce.
1216;It is timeless and will be enjoyed for generations to come.
1217;Wanted to share the classics with my 27 year old Daughter.
1218;This is one of my favorites.
1219;It is one of a few that I'll watch over and again.
1220;This is, in my opinion, my favorite movie.
1221;directing, acting, cinematography, editing and yes, music.
1222;The music is how scores should be.
1223;the children are outstanding (hard to find in a movie).
1224;You really get the sense of viewing this world through the eyes of a child.
1225;the courtroom scene is by far the best ever made.
1226;Gregory Peck's closing argument shows just how perfect he was for the role of Atticus Finch.
1227;It is great to hear two filmmakers actually talk about making films.
1228;"Modern day producers should listen carefully to the late Alan J. Pakula as he explains what a ""real"" producer should do on a film."
1229;"It just seems to hit on every level, from a screenplay artfully edited from the classic Harper Lee novel, to terrific and believable performances by everybody, especially the child actors
1230;A classic, and an essential film.
1231;the 50th anniversary repackaging is terrific .
1232;ray comes with a batch of making.
1233;And the booklet has essays by Peck's wife Veronique, by Harper Lee, and .
1234;this is especially nifty for actors out there .
1235;it's revelatory to watch the scenes in question with the script in front of you.
1236;An essential ressiue of an essential movie.
1237;She was quoting the story as it went along, it was great.
1238;The difference being"
1239;the remastering of this classic in Blu Ray is without a doubt one of the best I have seen.
1240;"it contains a number of extras
1241;town Alabama lawyer and widower father of two, does an outstanding job of acting in To Kill a Mockingbird.
1242;The lesson that he teaches is relived with every challenge that Atticus faces.
1243;The strength Atticus shows us in dealing with the community and retaining the friendship of a wrongfully accused man is tremendous.
1244;I would recommend this movie for families to watch as a family.
1245;There is a strong message that we all can learn from on how to better deal with racial hatred.
1246;I love Gregory Peck, he has always been one of my favorites, but I certainly did not like him in this picture, nor anything about it.
1247;This is probably the best story that has ever been written about courage and commitment in the deep South.
1248;Atticus sets a wonderful example for his children.
1249;This is a fantastic companion to the story, To Kill a Mockingbird the students like having a clear visual to watch after a good read.
1250;This is a fabulous package.
1251;After searching Universal Home Entertainment's website, I found a customer service page.
1252;A gripping story for its time.
1253;This is an excellent movie to watch and discuss later.
1254;In addition, it has funny and light.
1255;hearted moments as well, about being a kid.
1256;Loved the book, and the movie is wonderful as well.
1257;Even though it's been around for years, it is a classic and would suggest anyone of all ages to see.
1258;I teach this book in my special education English class and then we watch the movie.
1259;The movie is well done, follows the important events of the book, and teaches important messages.
1260;To Kill a Mockingbird (Universal Legacy Series)Such a great classic!
1261;It's well written, well acted and of course the debut of the great Robert Duvall.
1262;I love classic movies and books.
1263;This one is worth the price.
1264;Loved this movie growing up.
1265;Highly reccommend this movie to anyone who loves the classics.
1266;One of my favorite movies as a teenager!Now that my son is in high school, it is a required book to read.
1267;a classic to add to our shelves of movies!
1268;Great movie, Gregory Peck at his best.
1269;Great story line, simple yet made interesting.
1270;My mom has the book, and she always tells people that they need to read it.
1271;So when I saw this movie, I thought that it would be perfect for her.
1272;She doesn't like movies that are black and white, or have the old western show look to them, so I didn't know whether she would like this or not, but she absolutely LOVED it!
1273;So It is worth 5 stars.
1274;I'm sure this one is on several film critics top 100 pics.
1275;Gregory Peck is fantastic in it.
1276;Excellent storyline, directing and acting.
1277;The children are also taught to value other's lives no matter their race or social standing in life.
1278;An entertaining piece that leaves a person with something to think about.
1279;Every English teacher can tell you that the film is never as good as the book.
1280;winning performance, wonderful child actors, and a cameo from young Robert Duvall make this film a don't miss.
1281;deserved, for it's a rare movie that stands up to a sensational novel like Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird.
1282;This film is on many critic's Top 100 Movie lists, and it would be on mine.
1283;This disc contains a few extras, all of which are very good.
1284;length documentary are what make this worth spending the money.
1285;the commentary is by director Robert Mulligan and producer Alan J. Pakula, and offers many insights into making the film.
1286;Another minor drawback is that when not offering great information, Pakula and Mulligan are often complimenting each other and all involved on what a great job they did on the film.
1287;Alford and Badham spin great tales about their experiences making the film and appear to have no regrets.
1288;I absolutely was addicted to the movie from the beginning credits.
1289;I now read the book and watch this movie at least once a year.
1290;It is my favorite of all time!
1291;The movie does a pretty good job, in a lot of ways, of presenting a condensed version of the book, but the book is about soooo much more than just the racial issue.
1292;All kinds of themes are worked into the fabric of the book, and I am really glad I finally read it.
1293;watching the movie after reading the book seemed the natural way to go, and I hope anyone watching the movie who hasn't read the book will then read the book, because relatively minor changes do shift the flavor and import of the original work.
1294;Dated, but this still is powerful.
1295;Great application of a powerful story to film for reflection and a powerful impact.
1296;Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch is one of the greatest cinematic characters of all.
1297;As the title line states: the best motion picture .
1298;The story is compelling and truly haunting.
1299;It brings to life the best and the worst of which society and individuals are capable.
1300;Atticus is an amazing character of courage, integrity and modesty.
1301;His portrayal is so convincing that he is exactly the phenomenal gentleman Harper Lee wrote of.
1302;His conviction to justice and respect for all people is unwavering and the epitome of character we all should possess.
1303;As an adult I have a full appreciation for its perfection and a great admiration for the broad spectrum of life's lessons it brought to the screen.
1304;A must see movie, a must read book.
1305;Be sure to do both.
1306;I especially love the dialogue between the producer and director as they discuss each scene, as you choose them.
1307;The 50th Anniversary edition was such a wonderful surprise!
1308;Not only for the movie itself being one of the all time classiics but the extra bonus features were outstanding!
1309;Seeing cast members recall making the movie, interviews with Gregory Peck, details of the production are such a delight to watch!
1310;It was a very enjoyable long afternoon.
1311;It is a very special event.
1312;Alan Pakula, Robert Mulligan and Horton Foote have made an absolutely terrific movie of one of the greatest books in contemporary fiction.
1313;The three years covered in the book are compressed into one year in the movie, and almost everything of importance is kept in the film version.
1314;The acting is extraordinary across the board.
1315;The children are wonderful, so real that they hardly seem to be acting at all.
1316;Mary Badham is absolutely perfect as Scout.
1317;Phillip Alford is excellent as Jem, and John Megna is fine as Dill.
1318;I especially liked Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell"
1319;the three characters who didn't live up to their counterparts in the book were Miss Maudie, Calpurnia, and Tom Robinson.
1320;"Ms. Maudie is a very intriguing character in the novel, a ditzy, wise, funny woman of bedrock integrity
1321;Estelle Evans is a fine actress and deserved a bigger role to give her talent more scope.
1322;speaking movie debut is just right as Boo Radley, and Scout's recognition of her formerly scary neighbor, with her tentative smile followed by 'Hey Boo', is one of the most affecting moments in the picture.
1323;i still remember when Peck won the Oscar for best actor"
1324;The movie 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is a labor of love of bringing a timeless classic to the screen, and Harper Lee must have been very gratified at the results.
1325;I loved it then (I loved the book too) and have remembered it fondly ever since.
1326;It's a classic, what else is there to say.
1327;we are happy with the product, the condition it arrived in and the ordering process.
1328;To Kill a Mockingbird has always been my favorite movie.
1329;This is a terrific movie and it is as effective today as it was when it first came out.
1330;I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a beautiful story that has a beautiful meaning along with a wonderful story line and absolutely GREAT acting.
1331;It is rare that a book capture the hearts and minds of those who read it and becom what is considered an American Classic.
1332;gregory Peck gives a wonderful portrail as Atticus Finch, the single father of two children in the Depression Era south.
1333;this is a great movie and a must watch for anyone who wants to watch brilliant acting and brilliant characters.
1334;It has everything: suspense, comedy, drama, and one of the best scripts to be adapted from a fine novel.
1335;Worth seeing over and over again!
1336;Gregory Peck was entirely deserving of the recognition that he got for playing Atticus Finch (including the Oscar for Best Actor), the strongest role in the movie was actually that of Scout (played by Mary Badham).
1337;to Kill a Mockingbird is the film adaptation of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same title.
1338;The story deals with racism and morality in a very humanistic way.
1339;This is a story about race relations as well as community relations and in the end, about doing the right thing.
1340;"Somehow, the stories about the Radley home come together with the trial of Tom Robinson and the moment where Scout gently says, ""hey Boo"" is truly a beautiful moment."
1341;i could probably heap praise on this movie until my fingers can't type anymore, but I am simply going to end by saying this is a movie than anybody who wants to watch a great movie needs to see this.
1342;Both the book and the movie are truly American classics.
1343;What I will say is that the special features are outstanding and give you a glimse into what Gregory Peck was like as a man.
1344;Rare footage, behind the scenes and heart warming stories.
1345;All of this is packaged in a great looking case.
1346;The art of story telling is rare in film today.
1347;But on a rare occasion a timeless film is made that sets the mark of excellence.
1348;filmed in Black and White, although color was available then, the film captures the sleepy town of Macomb where tree lined dirt roads prevail, neighbors know one another and check in on each other, and the only thing a kid has to entertain himself is the endless miles of fields and a vivid imagination.
1349;With just a few exceptions the whole of this novel is kept and is well presented in the film.
1350;But Peck presence is only the glue that holds the film together.
1351;The true triumph of this film is in the casting of Mary Badham and Phillip Alford as the lead characters of Scout and Jem.
1352;this film also marks some early performance of Alice Ghostly and Aunt Stephanie the aunt of Del Harris who is based on the real life childhood of Truman Capote and the screen debut of Robert Duvall as Boo Radley.
1353;this film is a treat.
1354;also a perceptive, study of the relationship between two children and their single.
1355;Peck deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actor.
1356;The children actors were superb, especially the nuanced performance of the little sister tagging along.
1357;tO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD takes the cake!
1358;winning Harper Lee semiautobiographical novel, but if my nephew had written a similarly.
1359;structured script for his Walter screenwriting class at UCLA, it would have been thrown out!First of all, the film is divided in two parts.
1360;Sorry, but this is a film.
1361;The first half concentrates on Scout and really builds up her character.
1362;"It's almost like a thankless role, and yet he is the symbolic ""mockingbird"" of the tale."
1363;don't get me wrong, it is a most well intentioned film and well.
1364;I great movie, and had I not read the book beforehand, I would have liked it alot more.
1365;This movie is worth seeing again and again.
1366;It is a classic that everyone should see.
1367;It is almost as good as the book.
1368;time classic is even better with the Blu.
1369;Strong performances are from everyone.
1370;"If you've never seen ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" this is the time to do so."
1371;If you have seen it before, it's well worth another look.
1372;like appreciation for the attorney's defense.
1373;But every black character even the Finch maid and nanny, Calpurnia, is shown with respect and anonymity.
1374;This is a classic movie.
1375;It is well worth getting it and exploring all the extras.
1376;It's a wonderful, dramatic movie version of Lee's award.
1377;It won three academy awards and was quite daring and innovative for 1962 to talk about rape by a black man of a white teenager.
1378;The story takes place in a small Southern town in 1935, and highlights the relationships of children with the town, and the events are seen through their eyes, and of course, the white town's view of the black people.
1379;A fine review of what some of America's problems were in the past.
1380;It seems appropriate that I watched and reviewed the movie on MLK Day.
1381;My dad had introduced this movie to my sister and I when we were little.
1382;He always knew how to explain things so you could understand.
1383;This was one of Peck's best if not the best movies of his career.
1384;Robert Mulligan's film version of Harper Lee's classic is nothing short of excellent.
1385;It portraits a book in the best possible way.
1386;The story is about siblings Scout and Jem growing up in a small quiet southern town in the 30's with their father, a lawyer and widower called Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck).
1387;Peck proves why he's one of our finest actors in a very memorable court scene where he gives a long speach, summing up the case and proving why Tom was judged by the colour of his skin rather then for the proof that was brought into the court in his favour.
1388;To Kill A Mockingbird is a true classic and one of those films that you should have seen.
1389;Now my cinematc life is complete (or so I'd like to think).
1390;The commentaries are expert and the features informative.
1391;peck turns in a great performance (and so does robert duvall in his debut) in one of the most awesomely done black and white classics.
1392;amazingly contemporary cinematography and direction give way to a highly interesting and very well written story with tons of great characters.
1393;this movie comes very highly recommended as one to own.
1394;My granddaughter had to read the book for Honors English and I remembered how much I loved the movie and how certain parts of the movie has stayed with me throughout all the years.
1395;It was and is a great book and a great movie.
1396;Watch and enjoy, even better, read the book and watch the movie.
1397;i think it's a superb and great movie.
1398;I was impressed with every detail.
1399;the movie was excellent, the tape is in great shape.

1433;"To add to that, the casting is perfect
1434;The children were particularly impressive, making their characters realistic"

1521;The movie also has gothic music to create the horrifying or thrilling environment, when Jim and Scout were walking home after the Halloween Party and they had an encounter with Bob Ewells.

1557;the stark black and white images perfectly depicted the settings and the deprivation of this small town world.
1558;Yet despite their lack of material trappings, the children found plenty to amuse themselves, utilizing their minds and their imaginations.

1573;It treats with gentle irony and profound moral insight the legal, social and spiritual issues of cruel poverty and heroic moral courage when that poverty, together with stupidity and moral cowardice call for taking the right course even when there is no possibility of victory.
1574;It is a story of the triumph of decency and grace where both are out of keeping with old codes and evil assumptions.
1575;It is a call for courage and a call for courage.

1580;okay so that was the best movie ever.
1581;Lee is a true genious!
1582;Gregory Peck was outstanding in his portrayal of his character.
1583;Brings to mind just how far we've come and just how much further we need to go.
1584;"i like everything about this edition of the film
1585;in good condition and rec'd in a timely manner.
1586;It is truly a fine product.
1587;Its a classic novel turned movie that is heart wrenching and yet heart warming.
1588;It deals with racism and how one man can provide so many with hope and restored faith in humanity.
1589;And I found it on Amazon for a very reasonable price.
1590;Plus a version with some great additions.
1591;The book was a true classic and for the time this movie was too.
1592;Gregory Peck did a perfect job on Atticus Finch and actress who played Scout did an fabulous job.
1593;Stays relatively true to the original story line and tone.
1594;One our favorite books of all time.
1595;Read it first, then watch the movie.
1596;Released in 1962, To Kill a Mockingbird ranks #34 on the AFI top 100 movie list and shows clearly just how powerful a classic movie can be.
1597;the movie is a perfect window into events which were all too familiar during the Great Depression.
1598;She is a tomboy, eager to speak out and fight for her cause.
1599;She has strong ideals and is not afraid to voice them.
1600;And ironically, when her father is threatened, it is her willingness to speak up and say what she feels that helps to soothe the situation.
1601;He gives just the right touch to so many scenes.
1602;You can see in his eyes the mix of emotions as he stands strong on the steps before the mob.
1603;His strength in the courtroom, and his tenderness with his kids is just stunning.
1604;i have seen this movie many times, and I look forward to seeing it many more.
1605;THIS is how fine movies were made in this time period.
1606;This shows great acting, great dialogue, and a mix of characters who are authentic and interesting and respectful of their origins.
1607;He is a real human being.
1608;it is a minor, interesting note, that despite the movie seeming to revolve around women, they never talk with each other!
1609;highly recommended in the strongest possible words.
1610;Everyone should see this film.
1611;The book is a life changing book and the movie is almost as good as the book.
1612;If you have not seen this movie, in order to be """"culturally literate,"""" you must see this."""
1613;As an English teacher, I always want you to read the book.
1614;I also recommend watching the movie then discussing both with others.
1615;The amount of conversational topics will astound you.
1616;This movie definitely makes my top ten of the greatest movies ever made.
1617;There are many Bonus Features.
1618;The interviews with the actors are extremely interesting and entertaining.
1619;A true fan of the film To Kill a Mockingbird cannot go wrong with this set.
1620;Both are in English and French but surprisingly not Spanish and both have English, Spanish and French subtitles.
1621;I highly recommend this 50TH Anniversary Edition of the enduring classic film, To Kill a Mockingbird!
1622;A good movie to make you think about society and how beliefs form.
1623;The film gods must have sprinkled it with star dust because it is magical.
1624;The action and the plot flow.
1625;But more importantly, it sends a timeless message.
1626;And Robert Duvall is unforgettable as Boo Radley and he never says a word.
1627;i wager this movie will remain important in the year 2525!
1628;This movie is one of my all time favorites.
1629;I have truly enjoyed watching this with my family and friends.
1630;Love it and am glad I own it!
1631;even though the movie is over 50 years old it was very riveting and held your attention you are on the edge of your seat.
1632;LOVE IT My favorite movie
1633;I love this edition, very clear in black and white, an original.
1634;It clarifies, explains, and helps you to understand the backgound of the time and events of the novel.
1635;star edition and is highly recommended.
1636;This movie can break kids in on the harsh reality of the world in a positive way.
1637;It is a book worth reading and re.
1638;I like how the kids are always friends.
1639;A great movie about life in the South in the 1930's.
1640;It is a wonderful example of relationship among people of all ages and color.
1641;It was absolutely just fine.
1642;it is a tradition that I watch it every year.
1643;To Kill a Mockingbird is, in my opinion, absolutely the finest film ever made.
1644;Filmed in timeless black and white and perfectly cast, this motion picture is a work of art.
1645;"the performance of Robert Duvall as ""Boo"" Radley is, alone, worth the price of admission, but John Megna, as young ""Dill"" Harris, steals the film as far as I'm concerned."
1646;well, maybe you should have a close family member call the undertaker.
1647;this move is great but not for children.
1648;i still see this movie from time to time.
1649;This movie it is a classic and a wonderful one.
1650;Just a great movie to teach respect among all nationalities.
1651;At our bible class this past sunday we had an hour long lesson onlearning to respect all nationalities in the whole world.
1652;The father displayed good principles in his own life and taught his children values.
1653;it is in their minds in a distorted way.
1654;Just look around and you will see it.
1655;(In all fairness, I wasn't impressed with Citizan Kane and it's considered one of the greatest films of all time!)
1656;Hard to remember that we had to read this in High School, Every time I see it I so enjoyed more and more
1657;The movie is a classic, and even though it is in black and white, its authenticity to the book, except in just a few details, adds to itssignificance.
1658;robert Duvall played an excellent Boo in his debut role.
1659;It is interesting to note that the character of Dill was patterned after Harper Lee's childhood friend, Truman Capote, in her own words.
1660;Gregory Peck was outstanding in his role, as was the entire ensemble.
1661;This movie must be rated as one of the top 10 ever made.
1662;Brilliant work by all associated with this movie.
1663;One of the great movies of all time.
1664;The remastering is perfect for today's high definition viewing.
1665;The bonus features give history of this 50 year old movie.
1666;Am right now thoroughly enjoying reading my book.
1667;Harper Lee is a riveting writer!!!
1668;"This movie is an ""all time favorite""/ ""oldie but goodie""!"
1669;Gregory Peck is fabulous in this wonderful classic.
1670;Have enjoyed this movie since my youth.
1671;"This is an excellent film with fine script, acting, and music score
1672;see movie with Atticus Finch (Greogry Peck) at his best.
1673;I would rate his acting in this movie as flawless and the character Atticus Finch as my favorite movie character of all time.
1674;frankly speaking I was so involved with the character that at one time or the other I thought I should become a lawyer.
1675;as Lawerance (Lawerance of Arabia) another amazing performance.
1676;Mr. Gregory Peck does a superb job of playing a southern lawyer who defends a black man who is accused of rape by a white woman and her father.
1677;He instills good values in his children, shows tremendous courage and strength of character.
1678;He is a peerless man, in that everyone is his peer.
1679;This is a film whole families should watch together.
1680;mary Badham, Black and White cinematography, Original Score.
1681;it is beautifully shot and has a good score but a movie needs more than great photography and music.
1682;It needs great screenwriting (which is frankly excellent especially in the courtroom) but it also needs great acting and direction and that is what To Kill a Mockingbird lacks a lot of.
1683;gregory Peck is a star I just cant seem to warm up to.
1684;He was handsome and had a great speaking voice but Ive never felt like he became the character.
1685;Peck is fairly good in the quieter scenes like when hes talking to Scout and Jem but whenever a scene becomes tense or dramatic he never seems to loosen up.
1686;He has a habit of going into these self.
1687;on the other hand, many of the supporting players are superb.
1688;Alice Ghostly and Ruth White are excellent as the cantankerous neighbors Stephanie Crawford and Mrs. Dubose.
1689;Brock Peters is great in his one little scene as Tom Robinson, (especially his line delivery of I did not sir!)
1690;He knew in his heart he wasnt going to win this case since he was defending a black man against a white jury in the South but he still stood up for what he sincerely believed was the truth.
1691;A movie with a storyline as great as To Kill a Mockingbird deserves to have devoted fans so if you love it, be fanatical by all means.
1692;I enjoyed it"
1693;wise) as so many people give it credit.
1694;I wouldnt call it an example of terrific filmmaking but I do think its worth watching nonetheless.
1695;This movie is a classic, and for good reason.
1696;In addition to excellent acting and an excellent story line, it portrays history the way life was in America in the 1940s.
1697;There are some valuable lessons to be learned in this film.
1698;This movie is/was so important to our society at the time it came out.
1699;I also enjoyed the follow up with Mr. Peck.
1700;He must have been a very fine man with great morals.
1701;as to the movie, I've seen it dozens of times since I was 6 and it is one of the few movies that can touch the hem of the garment of the book (though it did change a few things, and leave some parts out.
1702;"It is a beautiful movie, despite the ugliness and three of the best played scenes are when the black minister tells Jean Louise Finch (Scout) ""stand up."
1703;The third and most beautiful was when the adult actress voiced over for Scout at the end and said she thought of those childhood times often.
1704;All in all, a touching movie with great performances that has stood the test of time.
1705;It speaks to the very core of humanity.
1706;Gregory Peck gave an outstanding performance.
1707;I had never read this book nor seen the movie so I watched it this weekend and it was excellent.
1708;Gregory Peck was excellent and the young girl who played Scout was terrific.
1709;Excellent movie for all generations to view.
1710;Actors were superb in their roles.
1711;Great for a family viewing and discussion.

1716;It's a visual feast with loads of photos peppering the wonderful memorabilia.
1717;But the real fireworks comes in the other two elements at play here .
1718;and the glorious new print.
1719;and the black and white cinematography of 1930's Alabama is fantastically clear.
1720;And the sound is rounded and clean too.
1721;the extras are equally superb .
1722;It's a feast for Peck fans .
1723;year old Peck is generous, charming, witty, responsive .
1724;there's footage of dinner with the President of France Jacques Chirac and his family .
1725;that old style Hollywood class .
1726;a talented giant who didn't have a mean bone in his body.
1727;It's joyful stuff to watch.
1728;Such was the power of the story .
1729;The performances by the children as innocents are particularly superb too .
1730;but it's Peck who dominates the whole thing with a gravitas and sincerity that few actors could match.
1731;His stand against bigotry is magnificent and filled with a quiet decency that has touched audiences for decades.
1732;and describe the great man himself.

1734;it's heartening to see Universal Studios finally throw some proper money at the preservation of its movie legacy .
1735;and be proud about doing so too.
1736;I for one will collect the whole series .
1737;and live in hope that other studios respect their past in the same glorious way.

1741;Both come with booklet and poster prints for each of the movies.20.
1742;Althought the book by Harper Lee gives more detail, this is one of the greatest Gregory Peck movies of all time.
1743;A very well done piece of cinematic tribute to an awesome story.
1744;This is probably my very favorite movie .
1745;in a time when we've all become accustomed to these panoramic epics which command a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars and seek to spell bind the audience with breath taking special effects, To Kill A Mockingbird succeeds without having to resort to any of these.
1746;And this is one of the important elements of this film.
1747;and it certainly was a very powerful one in 1963 when this movie was made .
1748;The conclusions we came to and how the events of our youth shaped our lives and made us the people that we are today.
1749;wonderfully played by a young Robert Duval .
1750;needless to say, Gregory Peck, who won the Best Actor award for his incredible performance of the decent Atticus Finch, was riveting.
1751;this wonderful movie was based on Harper Lee's best selling Pulitzer prize winning novel.
1752;this movie is one of those rare adaptations that actually adhered exclusively to the book and, as a result, was an artistic and commercial success.
1753;another wonderful contribution to this film was the soundtrack.
1754;both during the film's ligher moments as well as the terrifying moments(as seen through the child's perspective).
1755;It's a beautiful soundtrack and certainly merits inclusion in your collection.
1756;this movie had a significant and lasting impact on me as an 11 year old seeing it for the first time.
1757;There's a very good reason why the book is considered mandatory reading in many American schools.
1758;if you're a lover of great films, then this movie is essential viewing.
1759;"The novel ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is one of the most important, passionate, beloved, spiritual and moral works in the English language."
1760;To Kill a Mockingbird, the film, has become as beloved as Harper Lee's book.
1761;I would personally rank it in the top 2.
1762;the story is relatively simple.
1763;town southern lawyer, frequently taking livestock and vegetables in trade for his services.
1764;Atticus has many friends in town, and everyone who knows Mr. Finch knows that he is a man of saint.
1765;Scout and Jem do the things that children do.
1766;Atticus Finch keeps the lid on that pot.
1767;watch for this moment and you'll know what he meant.
1768;supporting performances perfectly compliment the transcendant one by Mr. Peck.
1769;Robert Duvall makes an impressive screen debut in an important role that doesn't appear until the final moments.
1770;To Kill A Mockingbird has done as much to advance the principles of fairness and justice as any single work of history.
1771;This film is a great film that records the strained and alienating relations of a dominant white society against African Americans in the 50s and the right for a trial and a plea for justice.
1772;While this film ends sadly, it nevertheless reminds us that injustice still exists today whether you are Mexican, Middle Eastern, or any other ethnic group that has suffered from the powers of white racism.
1773;There is so much to it.
1774;I bought this movie for my son.
1775;wow, very powerful and educational!
1776;EXCELLENT Film and a timeless novel.
1777;The movie is very close to the book and I actually use it with the novel for 8th graders.
1778;It's a great way to wrap up the unit after reading the novel.
1779;Great insight to Gregory Peck, his family, and his film history in addition to so many enhanced Mockingbird moments.
1780;The film has been a major essential for years, and I bought the 50th Anniversary Set to allow my grandson to view it with us.
1781;The actors did very well.
1782;in a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee, the small town of Macomb, Alabama is portrayed in the summer of 1932, during the deepest depression that the United States had ever experienced.
1783;Over the course of the next year and a half, events will burrow inside this sleepy southern town and the lives of its residents will be transported by actions, ideas, perceptions and convictions that will influence one and all in ways that will ring true for years to come.
1784;the performances throughout To Kill A Mockingbird are stunning.
1785;The children, especially Mary Badham, are siblings of more than a movie making venture.
1786;There is a noble demeanor to his bearing, and yet we are aware of the restrictions that blacks were held to in their relationships with whites at the time.
1787;robert Mulligan, the director and Horton Foote, the screenwriter, have presented us with a look into our pasts and faithfully etched a portrait of quiet and artfully rendered proportions that draw us into the canvas and the lives of those assembled.
1788;the cinematography by Russell Harlan and the set decoration by Oliver Emert carry us back through the courtesy of black and white to a depiction seen only in old photographs and clouding memories of those who lived in those precarious times.
1789;elmer Bernstein's film score carries us like an old friend and helps us to make our acquaintances with the characters held within this framework.
1790;He has achieved much with a simple theme and persuades us that said simplicity is fulfilled with less rather than more.
1791;to Kill A Mockingbird is beautifully haunting and having been made in the 60's, at the height of the Civil Rights movement, it garners our attention to stop and take the time to truly 'see' what the human race is all about and what it can and should be, if taken over the bumps in the road and onto a path of sincere honesty and purpose.
1792;see it and be amazed at what real moviemaking is all about.
1793;I watch this movie periodically and still enjoy it.
1794;From the beginning voiceover the tone of the movie is set, and true to the novel.
1795;Gregory Peck is the quintessential father figure and the children are superb in their roles.
1796;Good book and an even greater movie.
1797;Gregory Peck won an Oscar for his role in this movie.
1798;\A must see or a great collectable.
1799;This is done really well.
1800;Book was in good condition and served the purpose.
1801;No matter how many times we watch this, it's a thought provoking and wonderful movie.
1802;Fairly close to the book,and well acted!
1803;I watched this film in class (Im an 8th grade boy) and it brought tears to my eyes.
1804;Great movie for anyone and everyone.
1805;The most tounching film I have ever seen.
1806;The legacy edition is much better.
1807;really a tremendous piece of work in itself.
1808;After reading the novel it transcribes beautifully.
1809;A rare instance in which a movie is on par with the book.
1810;It's important for all generations to see this story.
1811;It's a tour de force of acting greatness in a story that quite simply provides incredible historical context for a shameful part of american history, while inspiring us to believe in the integrity and honor of man.
1812;Kudos to Universal and all involved in putting this 50th anniversary edition together.
1813;It's a staple for every English classroom and one of the most enduring films of its time.
1814;This version comes with a great many bells and whistles, like a digital copy and some time capsule.
1815;Very pleased with product and seller.
1816;the movie starts however with a seemingly unrelated event, the lives of Atticus Finch's two children.
1817;the acting in this movie (in black and white) is superb.
1818;I teach this novel to a 10th grade class and showing the movie is an integral part of the unit.
1819;To Kill a Mockingbird is my very favorite book and the movie is one of my favorites.
1820;the price was so good i bought a second to give away.
1821;It was a classic when I first saw it as a teenager.
1822;It was a classic when I read it back in school, and again when I recently read it.
1823;And it is still a classic.
1824;I love Gregory Peck as Atticus, he was perfectly cast.
1825;Awesome family movie for your movie night.
1826;Probably Walter Cunningham Sr. does is best, but he is dirt.
1827;in contrast, Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck), is kind, patient, analytical, discreet, approachable, humble, and courageous, providing an excellent example for his children.
1828;The main theme, played on flute, violins, then piano, is a haunting melody which probably speaks to the innocence of childhood and nostalgia for that innocence.
1829;Elmer Bernstein won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and was nominated for an Oscar.
1830;this film has a great story, great characters, great performances, and a great mood.
1831;The movie did stall a view times, so I refreshed, and I could view it much better.
1832;This movie steals the very heart and soul of every human being that watches it.
1833;This movie is a timeless classic that will never die.
1834;I loved the book when they made us read it about in Middle School.
1835;Since it's been ages since I've seen or read either I needed to get this video and I recieved it as a wonderful gift for Christmas.
1836;Her and her brother growing up with their father who's a lawyer.
1837;One story is of the family in general, the second one is the story of the kids wanting to know about their neighbor Boo Bradley.
1838;That scene in general was outstanding.
1839;It's easy to see that Gregory Peck won an academy award for best actor.
1840;Has a wonderful information on production notes.
1841;And the idea of an author (Harper Lee) loving a Screen Play is quite unknown so that just tells you how much this movie is loved.
1842;I hadn't seen this film in years, but it is still a real classic, and the performances really hold up.
1843;Gregory Peck is wonderful, but the kids, Jem and Scout are so natural and sweet it is refreshing.
1844;It still arrived before Christmas, and in perfect condition.
1845;Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch is simply wonderful casting.
1846;Read the book many years ago and picked the movie as a film class project and am glad that I finally got to watch it.
1847;To Kill a Mockingbird is immensely simple, echoing the languid mood of a small town, pre.
1848;Main character is Scout, a child growing up with older brother Jem who longs for manhood and her father Atticus Finch, a uniquely dedicated lawyer and good man.
1849;For anyone unsure of the value of movie and its story, this feature.
1850;length documentary is a wonderful introduction or alternative.
1851;one thing on which we all agreed was that the movie is a gem.
1852;The actors who portrayed them in the film differed greatly from what I imagined.
1853;what I Can Tell You:Wow, where do I start.
1854;I was completely floored with this movie.
1855;Gregory Peck performance is completely stunning!
1856;The fact that he won best actor for the role was not lost on me, completely worthy of it and one of the best acting I have ever seen.
1857;A gentle, kind soul, whose thoughtfulness and mannerisms bring out the best in those around him.
1858;He allows, after a gentle nudge to make their own assumptions and mistakes in life in hopes of becoming a better person.
1859;There is real love there and I was n awe of how much acting had to be done.
1860;Without the use of a soundtrack and a whole lot of dialogue these actors really have to ACT!
1861;i have so many favorite scenes:Scout saying goodnight to her father and asking what he has to pass on to her when he is gone.
1862;brock Peters taking the stand.
1863;He is such a gentle, caring man who obviously loves his children.
1864;ray, take time to watch the bonus features.
1865;to Kill a Mockingbird won Academy Awards for Best Actor (Peck), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Art Direction.
1866;Truly a classic and one that everyone should watch.
1867;Rarely has a film captured the innocence of childhood, the wonderful relationship of a father and his children, or the disheartening prejudice exhibited in this country.
1868;Within five minutes, one can see why Horton Foote's awesome screenplay won an Oscar, and why Gregory Peck won his only Oscar for his role as Atticus Finch.
1869;"Mary Badham, Philip Alford and John Megna as the children are priceless
1870;Estelle Evans as Calpurnia, the housekeeper, evokes the warmth and maternal kindness of a caring housekeeper, and Frank Overton as the sheriff has a fine moment in the end of the movie.
1871;Beautifully directed by Robert Mulligan with a fine score from Elmer Bernstein, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD remains a powerful and affectionate cinematic treat.
1872;This film should be required viewing for everyone who enjoys the truest of classic films.
1873;Atticus raises these precocious children perfectly,with the assistance of a black maid (Estelle Evans).
1874;It has all the elements of a perfect picture.
1875;While I loved my father dearly, this film helped me understand that he wasn't always right.
1876;All the elements are here, as seen through the eyes of children.
1877;This film awakens us to that fact.
1878;All of these lessons taught in a film of kids having fun.
1879;Oh man, I wish they still made tires big enough to ride inside of.
1880;crayons, marbles, pocket watches, oh the simplicity of what is fun in children's eyes.
1881;I really believe he'll learn something about life, and will have fun doing it.
1882;And despite what my neighbors may think, believing it right to do so.
1883;So what if the boys create a dirt figure 8 track for their toy cars right in the front yard.
1884;True to the novel from which it was drawn, this movie combines a number of stellar performances from a tremendously talented cast to produce what I think of as the quintessential American film.
1885;love, death, growing up and racism.
1886;The film, truly an American classic and, for my money, one of the 10 best American films ever made, is splendidly rendered here with a mint.
1887;among the revelations in the commentary is that production designer Henry Bumstead (Vertigo) masterfully recreated the children's neighborhood on the Universal backlot using houses that would have been demolished by the construction of a freeway.
1888;The main titles, by Stephen Frankfurt, with Bernstein's theme, manage brilliantly to capture not only the essense of the film but an essence of childhood, about which both Harper Lee's timeless only published novel and the film itself are very much about.
1889;In its stead, however, we have another evocation, that of Ms. Lee's voice in the rich tone of nostalgia and reminiscence with which Kiselyak infuses his own small but mighty masterpiece.
1890;This is the greatest movie every made.
1891;Harper Lee's magnum opus, masterfully set to the screen.
1892;The movie is a very close rendition to the book.
1893;Injustice, racism and cruelty and one man who stands up with the courage to defy it.
1894;It is a wonderful story of a little girl growing up in a very grown up world.
1895;She sees what is right through her interactions with Atticus.
1896;A brillantly written and acted movie.
1897;It stays true to Harper Lees book and is intense with a great plot.
1898;I gave this as a Christmas gift.

1908;I had loved the book of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and we were made to watch this film in English class.
1909;I found it very touching, owing to all the performances of the actors, particularly that of Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch.

1919;I especially enjoyed the added documentary .
1920;seeing the stars talk about their experience in making the movie.
1921;Still a great masterpiece and worthy of watching.
1922;It is great for the younger generation to see and learn from it and to get some idea of the greatness of performance of movie starts at the time when there was no special effects and advanced cinematography.

1930;The documentary on their restoration process is awesome!
1931;why go backwards in formats?Universal did an outstanding job on this particular release and I cannot recommend this blu ray enough.
1932;please Universal, treat more of your classics with this much respect.
1933;I watched to help my sister with her home work, so I was not that happy with the idea but after I finished watching it I was very happy.
1934;It is likely that most people reading this review are already familiar with the classic movie, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, so I'm not going to say much about the movie itself other than to say, if you have not watched this movie, you are missing one of the very best movies ever made.
1935;this is the Legacy Series edition of this movie and contains additional features for ardent fans of this incredible work.
1936;This disc also includes the making of the movie, which is an exceptional feature.
1937;If you don't already own this movie, I highly recommend this edition.
1938;The first time I played it, it froze about an hour in.
1939;It is a great movie to watch for an entire family and have a discussion over racism, segregation and discrimination which still persist in this country.
1940;I like the book better though.
1941;Meanwhile, Atticus's children are following with the trial and learning the mysteries of life, and trying to find out the truth about their next door neighbor, Boo Radley.
1942;to Kill a Mocking bird is a wonderful film that teaches you an important lesson.
1943;I hope that it is enjoyed and appreciated for years.
1944;Watching this film has something of the opposite impact.
1945;it makes one appreciate the depth of talent displayed and that writers, directors, and actors actually had to rely on the storyline and acting for films to succeed.
1946;This is one that did and does.
1947;"some of the ""special features"" drag a bit, but it is interesting to hear Gregory Peck talk about the film and to experience his wit and humor."
1948;It's about the heart and soul of the film, the characters and the actors who portrayed them.
1949;"While some kids might groan at the black and white images and lack of action,"" it's good family viewing."
1950;There's a lot to experience and a lot to talk about.
1951;this film is worthy of all its plaudits over the years.

1953;This is a fabulous movie.
1954;I found all of the interviews poignant and interesting.
1955;This is my favorite book and movie of all time.
1956;I reread it every few years and watch it at least annually.
1957;Truly all of the cast is phenomenal.
1958;As always, many of Lee's characters in this growing.
1959;This is a great addition for a classic movie collector.
1960;This is a classic, anyone who is into great films should see this movie.
1961;"Right on the cover it states that 12 reproductions of the original movie poster is included with this ""special edition."""
1962;This is a great deal for a cinema classic.
1963;It has a bunch of special features, which I'm excited to check out.
1964;The book and the movie both won major awards and any reader will quickly see why.
1965;Gregory Peck stars in this near perfection film adaptation of a magnificent novel.
1966;the film has to be considered one of the greatest dramas ever made, what makes the film even more enjoyable is that is family oriented.

1970;To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my very favorite movies.
1971;One of the best movies ever!
1972;A classic movie that is the ultimate for any library.
1973;This movie is the best at showing how life was in the south, it deals with racism and yet it shows respect for all people of color.
1974;It was easy to predict that Hannibal Lecter would be the top villain.
1975;I was genuinely surprised, and very, very pleased, that the top film hero named was, indeed, Atticus Finch.
1976;and, very simply, he thought it was the right thing to do.
1977;I think Atticus Finch's quiet devotion to his children, and his belief in doing what was decent and right in his life and profession, made this character a hero in my eyes.
1978;I always find it inspiring.
1979;this is a film I revisit at least once a year, and it never ceases to move and inspire me.
1980;Harper Lee must have been so proud.
1981;What I will say is this particular packaging of the Movie, was a wonderful bonus, and has increased my appreciation of the movie two fold.
1982;Like wise the interview with Mary Badham (who played Scout), provided me with additional enjoyment.
1983;I watched this over the weekend with my three year old son Jacob, kids today don't go out of their way to watch anything in B&W, but such is the power of this movie, that he sat wide eyed waiting for the final arrival of Boo Radley.
1984;I watched the same reaction in him, that I had all those years ago when I first saw Robert Duvall behind that door, the hairs even today, still stand on end!
1985;What a marvelous movie what a wonderful story.
1986;Also the post card sized movie posters included will look fantastic framed.
1987;Gregory Peck is the perfect Addicus,and the kids were so comfortable and real.
1988;sometimes things are not what they seem and we can be very surprised by the ending.
1989;I believe that this is a movie that suits kids of all ages.
1990;I am in my 20's and I still absolutely love this movie.
1991;Two thumbs up I have to say.
1992;Not only do you get one of the great films of all time, you also get the documentary about the film and its impact on the general public.
1993;This work is truly beautiful and has held up every bit as good as when it was first released.
1994;The film also follows the book very closely and does a wonderfull job of adapting the masterpiece.
1995;It is part of my personal film library and is truly a great addition.
1996;This is one of my personal favorite movies based on one of my favorite books.
1997;The cast has done a terrific job bringing the book to the screen.
1998;full of love for his children and worthy of their respect.
1999;The message will teach you to open your heart and mind to the world around you.
2000;Even though the book was fiction, it and the movie were the best work ever done concerning the lack of civil rights in America!The movie brought the characters to life and they were perfect!
2001;This movie (and the book) are classics.
2002;The acting and directing are excellent.
2003;I watched it the first time when I was a child and I have always loved it.
2004;It's a story of dignity as Atticus Finch, an honest God.
2005;in the meantime, we follow the lives of the three children during one summer, one who is a summer visitor and based on the life of Truman Capote, who was a neighbor of the story's author Harper Lee.
2006;45 years later the movie still stands the test of time for its acting, its story and proving once and for all there are lots of great movies and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of them!
2007;This movie is definitely a classic for everyone to watch!!
2008;One of the great movies of of the Golden Era of filmdom: important lessons for all ages, races, and times.
2009;gregory Peck, who'd started working on Broadway and in movies 20 years prior to this film, does a very stable and critically acclaimed (Oscar rewarded) performance as Atticus Finch .
2010;much of this 1962 movie, which incidentally includes Robert Duvall's film.
2011;"debut, is played out through the eyes of Finch's motherless children, ""Jem"" and ""Scout."
2012;"I recommend it highly to anybody anywhere, regardless of age and culture, as it contains no foul language"" or ""severe violence."""
2013;For all the viewer is aware, this could be a recreation of actual historic events, which it in a sense is.
2014;"dominated 1950's Ingmar Bergman pictures (such as ""Smiles of a Summer Night."")"
2015;There are also Spanish subtitles and a French audio track.
2016;Made a great gift for my husband who loves this movie.
2017;He was very happy with his gift on Christmas morning.
2018;Gregory Peck is perfection as Atticus Finch.
2019;And a then unknown Robert Duvall is unforgettable as Boo Radley.
2020;It is an excellent adaptation of Harper Lee's book.
2021;plot, Finch's children amuse themselves in the pre.
2022;There are the endearing interactions between Atticus and his children.
2023;Harper Lee portrays small town life during the depression with great detail and the movie brings this out.
2024;This is one of my wife's faverate movies so I got it for our 22nd annaversary.
2025;My wife and girls watched it together and they all just loved it.
2026;That is the greatest thing going on.
2027;This is a poignant and heart warming story told from the point of view of a little tomboy, Scout, and her older brother, Jem, of growing up in the South during the depression.
2028;The colorful neighbors, their antics and their opinions, show the audience just what stuff this family, especially Atticus trying to raise his children alone, is made of.
2029;I think this is a all time classic you can enjoy over and over.
2030;Apart from being a story about a family living at a time when black people were not accepted for their true worth, it also depicts an understanding lawyer and a couple (or 3) natural kids who asked questions and tried to understand the answers.
2031;This movie is a classic and well worth viewing.
2032;I watched it with my mom and 8 year old grand daughter and both loved the movie
2033;It is otherwise a great movie.
2034;this was the best iof the best i give it a 10+
2035;To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best American films I've ever seen.
2036;The acting is fantastic (including some of the most natural child performances you've ever likely to see), the score is magnificent, and the film is very well.
2037;This is one of the clearest and most beautiful transfers for a film of this age I've seen.
2038;The sound, while slightly held back due to this being a 50.
2039;year old movie, also fares very well.
2040;this release is packed many worthwhile and insightful extras, particularly a feature.
2041;a timeless masterpiece earns an equally impressive blu.
2042;It was nice to be able to see this when we thought it would be hard to find.
2043;Thank you for having a great selection of movies.
2044;I have always loved this movie and even though I have seen it a million times, I enjoy it each and every time I watch it.
2045;screen antics of Scout, Jem, Atticus and ultimately, Boo.
2046;LOVED the extra features, which is why I bought this version.
2047;to see the actors beyond the characters.
2048;"This is so much more than a movie
2049;raising a family, working two jobs, dealing with setbacks and disappointment, trying always to rise above the roadblocks, to make it all worthwhile, and even have some fun, along the way.
2050;I bought the film with high expectations, and all my expectations were exceeded by this masterpiece.
2051;This movie and the history behind Harper Lees work touched me so deep, that I went to imdb ([.])
2052;and gave it a perfect 10 rating.
2053;Fantastic acting and incredible story!
2054;Gregory Peck was one of the greatest actors of all.
2055;Watch this movie and be amazed!
2056;What an impressive story and movie.
2057;Gregory Peck is impressive and gives a great performance.
2058;I read the book years ago and was so pleased to see the movie is so well produced.
2059;Was great to watch with my teenagers.
2060;Peck will be remembered for this movie and his role in it.
2061;The great movie carefully preserved and restored with bonus materials.
2062;There is little deviation from the book and the cast are great.
2063;It is something that everyone should own.
2064;Besides, you absolutely have to keep an eye out for Robert Duvall.
2065;I had forgotten, what a meaningful movie this was and how wonderful and actor Gregory Peck was!
2066;I really enjoyed the movie"
2067;(I especially loved how the kids sat with the African.
2068;"Gregory Peck was the man's lawyer and really his ""advocate"" for justice!"
2069;It was truly a great story of UNDERSTANDING!!!!
2070;It is a great movie about prejudice, good and evil, and about how people with disabilities have been treated.
2071;I highly recommend the move for those who have not seen it, and for those who have.
2072;Even though the movie was set in the South, I felt a connection with these characters because my pre.
2073;So the connection was very intense.
2074;I immediately bought the book and read it cover to cover on my own and I loved the book even more.
2075;I think I bought it more for the extra features than the original movie since I had already seen it multiple times.
2076;The Special Features were tremendous.
2077;"To think that a movie that was so endearing and social relevant was actually filmed on the back lot of Universal Studios and was so ""movie fake"" was so good on the screen all bound together by one of the best movie sound tracks ever written is a testament to the creators of this motion picture."
2078;This work will be there through the ages.
2079;Gregory Peck did a superb job of portraying Atticus Finch and inspires us all to our better selves.
2080;Atticus Finch is a man for all times, a man of integrity who makes us believe we could all be better than we are, in our professional lives as well as in our personal relationships.
2081;everyone would benefit from viewing this movie not only once but periodically, for another dose of inspiration plus it is very entertaining and comical in places.
2082;able as well as inspirational.
2083;The product was recieved in excellent condition and was everything I expected it to be.
2084;The movie is a classic and I never tire of watching it.
2085;The acting was superb .
2086;Child actors that are convincing in their parts are rare these days and the children in this movie were very convincing.
2087;Gregory Peck is an excellent actor who never overplays his part.
2088;I would always recommend this movie.
2089;An excellent film with an extraordinary actor.
2090;One of the best loved novels of it's time, comes to life with power and force with no other than Gregory Peck.
2091;Robert Duvall and Alice Ghostley have cameos in the movie.
2092;Amazing work of art, story telling, and suspense.
2093;It takes a real good look at depression era deep south living, prejudice and moral values.
2094;The court room scene still makes me shiver and weep.
2095;One of the best movies ever made, and one of the best movies ever acted, by botht the child stars and a adults.
2096;I love how the movie portrays the tone of the town even better than the book.
2097;It can bring to focus so many identities.
2098;color, intelligence, gender, sexual preference, introvert.
2099;We can all relate to this classic.
2100;"I really enjoyed reading Harper Lee's book
2101;The film is wonderful .
2102;even though it does not follow the novel strictly, it still captures the essence of the story.
2103;the morality and strength of character that we see in Scout's lawyer/father is inspiring.
2104;The setting is filled with Southern Gothic magic.
2105;Both novel and film are highly recommended.
2106;This story is timeless How movies sd be made.
2107;Some great things that happened in the book are left out, but this is still a great movie.
2108;Peck is amazing as Atticus"
2109;Scout and Jem are pretty good, too.
2110;Time less, classic and great performances.
2111;There's very little to be said about this incredible film that hasn't been said before.
2112;I immediately decided it was my favorite film of all time, and, 40 years later, it still is.
2113;Horton Foote's brilliant screenplay accomplished a feat that is almost unparallelled: it reduced a complex, character.
2114;"Its profound effect on me has been a bit of a character builder for me
2115;I encourage all people with children in their life to show this to them.
2116;Kids often pay more attention to a film that's seen thru the eyes of kids.
2117;I've seen it happen to my own, and I, myself, am living proof.
2118;This is the best movie ever made.
2119;so ahead of its time and it was a great pkg for the price
2120;I was extra pleased to obtain and view this classic movie to help celebrate the 50th anniversary of the marvelous novel by Harper Lee.
2121;Although the movie cannot replicate the genius of Harper Lee's narrative, it is nonetheless one of the great films based on a novel.
2122;The Black and White Photography is clear, and the additional commentaries are interesting for those interested in learning more of this story, which happened to be Gregory Peck's favorite role of all the many motions pictures he starred in during his long and memorable career.
2123;This one does a particularly excellent job.
2124;and i own over 300 films.
2125;This movie is a classic and a must.

2136;thank you, me and my wife love it to.
2137;If you enjoy drama, classic holiywood, a great story and a great actor, this is a must have.
2138;Gregory Peck is at his dramatic finest in the vehichle.
2139;Even if you have seen before, watch it again.
2140;A wonderful and moving drama.
2141;This is one of the best movies that I have ever watched.
2142;The best movie every made.
2143;Best picture oscar deserved for sure.
2144;Extras for 50th Anniversary are great and unexpected!
2145;Recommend it for all to see.
2146;Watching the movie helped him understand what the book was about and he is learning the difference between watching a movie and reading the book and how the book always has much more detail than a movie.
2147;What is up with the digital touch up of Gregory Peck's face!
2148;To Kill A Mockingbird is a beloved classic, and also one of my favorite films of all.
2149;robert Mulligan directs this film.
2150;making is one I've come to appreciate and love!
2151;driven films that are much more heartfelt and personal, plus so much more enjoyable and satisfying to watch.
2152;developed characters are the essence of great films.
2153;same goes for stories, too!Harper Lee's classic novel was a huge success, mainly because of the unforgettable characters.
2154;He was a brave man who didn't have to use his fist or a gun to get his message across.
2155;He embodied goodness, justice, virtue, integrity, courage.
2156;all relative qualities that I associate with honorable men.
2157;As for the film itself, it's timeless.
2158;It will no doubt be cherished and enjoyed by generation of moviegoers to come.
2159;It's a gem and one that I highly recommend!
2160;Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch is one of those great film performances that one can never get enough of.
2161;Some of the best child actors ever seen on screen as well.
2162;And what has to be the best portrayal of a single father to date.
2163;time best films on any list.
2164;See if you can spot Robert Duvall in his film debut.
2165;Robert Mulligan directed this movie and kept it faithful to the book, which is always a surprise.
2166;It also shows how a wonderful book can fit on the screen like a beautifully hung picture.
2167;Gregory Peck's subdued performance underlines the character of Atticus well.
2168;All the acting roles are beautifully done.
2169;worth watching and worth putting on your shelf.
2170;Added this to my collection and I am proud to show it to family and friends.
2171;Gregory Peck and this marvelous group of actors brought a difficult and painful truth in our history to the screen in a gentle, but forceful way, which has left a mark on American cinema, and that of the entire world, as well as our hearts.
2172;See if you can spot who was playing Boo Radley before you look it up.
2173;received in a timely manner.
2174;i'm as happy as flea on a dog.
2175;I first read Harper Lee's Pulitzer winning novel when I was in the 10th Grade, and I watched the movie adaptation soon thereafter.
2176;There is much to contrast with our notion of lawyers today.
2177;The added director's commentaries and featurette are of tremendous value in further understanding this movie.
2178;This movie was a labor of love and will touch anyone who watches it.
2179;A great novel turned into an even greater film!
2180;Gregory Peck's usual wooden acting style is perfect here as Atticus.
2181;The three children are wonderfully natural, as are the other actors, but the real stars are the novel itself, Horton Foote's screenplay, Robert Mulligan's direction, and Elmer Bernstein's haunting score.
2182;and then of course there are the additional little nuggets of gold such as that the film includes the debut of one of our greatest actors, Robert Duvall as Boo and that Dill is based on a young Truman Capote.
2183;Then (without the children) go watch the film Capote with Philip Seymour Hoffman's mesmerizing performance as Capote with the help of Harper Lee and see what Dill grew up to be!
2184;And read it and read it and read it again!
2185;What a thrill to experience this awsome movie again!
2186;Peck was the perfect choice to play Finch and received an Academy Award for best actor for that performance.
2187;A widower with two young children, he supports himself and his family as an attorney in a small town in Alabama during the Great Depression.
2188;His eloquent appeals for justice and racial tolerance are directed to everyone in the town, not only to members of the jury.
2189;As directed by Robert Mulligan, all members of the cast perform brilliantly.
2190;Of special interest is the screen debut of Robert Duvall as Boo Radley, a mysterious recluse who eventually becomes significantly involved in the plot.
2191;Finch is as credible to those who see this film as he is to those in the town in which he and his children live.
2192;When making word associations with the name Gregory Peck, intelligence, integrity, and dignity immediately come to mind.
2193;Credit must also be given to Horton Foote who wrote the highly literate screenplay based on Lee's autobiographical novel.
2194;This is a great film primarily because it contains a great performance by Peck and because (through Finch) it makes a power appeal to the best that is within us, whatever the color of our skin may be.
2195;Probably one of the best movies ever made.
2196;Everybody in it is wonderful and the story is one that needed to be told.
2197;I think it worked as an eye opener to issues about racial relations and what kids live with growing up in the South!
2198;Gregory Peck is fantastic as always.
2199;This movie will live forever!
2200;The charactures in this picture are enthrallling, It's such a delight to see a picture that captures yourheart.
2201;I watch this movie about 4 times a year, Truely a masterpiece.
2202;This is one of the all time greatest movies.
2203;This is a classic that everyone, young and old should see AFTER reading the book.
2204;The casting was superb and the book was really brought to life.
2205;Just one glance at Robert J. Mulligan's 1962 film and you will see why it (unlike many of today's contenders) is a true American masterpiece.
2206;as the Anglo protagonist Atticus Finch, Gregory Peck delivers one of the most excellent character performances of his film career.
2207;as the town """"idiot"""", he is an enigma to the local children."""
2208;who spend a considerable amount of time in the film fascinated by the rumors surrounding this man.
2209;My highly diverse (racially, socio.
2210;economically) class struggled a bit with Harper Lee's diction early so this film provided an excellent complement to the novel.
2211;told this story from a cinematic perspective.
2212;Great stories can still make great movies, even without sex and explosions.
2213;Midway through this outstanding movie, Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) defends a black man accused of raping a white woman in an Alabama town during the Depression.
2214;This is one of the simple themes of the movie: all you have to do is confront and face bigotry, in order to eliminate it.
2215;tO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is undoubtedly one of the most important and most engaging movies of post.
2216;wWII America, and a cinematic emblem for the civil rights movement of that era.
2217;From the incredible opening credits, complete with Elmer Bernstein's heartbreakingly beautiful score, you know you're in for a great movie.
2218;But the aptly named Scout also sees something that most other children do not: the dark world of grown.
2219;In this way, she is a sort of foil for her father whose fighting spirit is internal, calm, but just as effective.
2220;TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is full of outstanding performances.
2221;Gregory Peck is appropriately understated, although passionate when the moment calls for it.
2222;this is a film to be watched on several levels but none more important than its stirring interpretation of childhood rapidly coming to terms with the adult world around them.
2223;It is simply one of the best books and movies that has been produced.
2224;This is simply the best of Gregory Peck by far.
2225;A movie that shows a single Dad that doesn't succumb to the norm , yet Quietly instills patience, honor,responsibility, respect for everyone, non.
2226;"To me this is the most beautiful film I have ever seen that dealshead on the great social issue
2227;It has every element of a true classic cinema.
2228;Great performance and a great story that will hold your attention all the way through.
2229;Black and White is a great format for this semi.
2230;Gregory Peck turns in a great performance in a timeless movie about the old south.
2231;Well worth the money to see it.
2232;Glad I found it on Amaz0n!
2233;line movie,and """"To Kill a Mockingbird"""" fits the bill."""
2234;The father figure, Gregory Peck, teaches his children, in very well chosen, thought out, loving words about the ugliness, as well as the beauty that this world can bring.
2235;The characters are real, the children so innocent.
2236;"This movie teaches us that we are all in this game of life together, and that we should learn to ""play fair"", respect and appreciate each other, for our diversities."
2237;God bless us, one and all(thanks Tiny Tim).
2238;This one of the greats and anyone who watches it will be touched.
2239;I will always love this movie and it is just one of the great classics.
2240;Gregory Peck's portrayal of Finch is astounding.
2241;It's a movie I shall watch many times.
2242;Truman Capote's influence is felt everywhere in both the book and film versions of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, Harper Lee's classic, beautifully haunting story of childhood, innocence lost, and of the cruelty that exists in people everywhere.
2243;Yes, Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch, and all of the players here inhabit their roles with grace, humor and gravity, but it is Mary Badham as Scout who steals the show, as it should be.
2244;The simplicity of a father's touch, of a rapist's grimace, of the wind gently blowing through the trees at dusk .
2245;everything in this movie evokes, from Scout's point of view, a time we each have in our lives that transforms us into adults.
2246;but the revelation carries with it a profound joy.
2247;Elmer Bernstein's score realizes each emotional chord of the film, and transports us without ever lambasting us .
2248;it is the best kind of movie score.
2249;You will be hooked from the opening credits, which are creatively brilliant .
2250;those crayons, the haunting and beguiling theme softly begins on the piano .
2251;through to the closing credits, at which point there will be well.
2252;This was my first time of reading to Kill a Mockingbird 50th Anniversary Edition and as with the other two times, I enjoyed coming back and revisiting it again.
2253;Gregory Peck, I felt, did a solid job portraying the character of Atticus.
2254;Scout's character carries the humor throughout this important film.
2255;While I am a big fan of the book, the movie is fantastic as well.
2256;THis movie is more true to the book than almost any other movie I've seen.
2257;Gregory Peck is incredible as the lawyer appointed to defend an innocent black man.
2258;The culture of that time period in the south is depicted very well.
2259;Prejudice is seen in more aspects of life than just between blacks and whites and the children participating and telling this story are growing up because of it.
2260;I would recommend this movie to anyone.
2261;The acting is first rate (by all the actors but especially Peck) and it is absolutely outstanding!
2262;This is one of the all time classics.
2263;It is an illustration of good vs. evil, the innocence of the young, courage, discrimination, prejudice and many more themes that have been missed by some of its critics.
2264;Ms. Lee's writing is a wonderful blend of child like innocence and the intelligent pen of a mature woman.
2265;Awesome this is one very good movie you just have to watch to enjoy every minute of this epic film
2266;To Kill a Mockingbird, the movie version of Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, will never cease to be a wonderful film.
2267;Peck, as Atticus Finch, is an inspirational movie hero who will stick with you for years to come.
2268;The character of Atticus Finch does an amazing job standing up for what he believes in regarding racial justice in 1930s Alabama, regardless of how it might cause others to treat him.
2269;Although black and white, the film's mystery, suspense and family drama keeps this movie intriguing and entertaining even by today's standards.
2270;She was incredibly convincing, and could show a wide range of emotions on her young face.
2271;Sagel Friendsmith wrote her Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment Test Essay on this legendary movie and earned the highest score in her entire school.
2272;She was able to recall important details about the story because they had made such an enormous impact on her when she saw it.
2273;I saw this as a child and really connected to it.
2274;It is one of the few movies I could recall in detail from childhood before seeing it again as adult.
2275;"I highly recommend this movie for absolutely anyone
2276;Both the book and the movie are so great individually that you can safely watch this before reading the book and still get so much from the book.
2277;The story is very good.
2278;Peck did a wonderful job as a father image.
2279;Reading the book with my 9th grade English class.
2280;It's interesting to discuss the differences of the book and the movie.
2281;This is my favorite book.
2282;So insightful on many levels.
2283;Great classic, always a good movie, love this edition, delivery and packaging were as promised, I would recommend as a gift.
2284;This movie can never be remade as this is one of the best movies ever.
2285;To Kill a Mockingbird it one of my favorite movies.
2286;gregory Peck and other cast members make this a great movie.
2287;gregory Peck comes across as a very dignified, handsome, moral character .
2288;who abounds in justice and strong paternal qualities.
2289;The true star of the show is Gregory Peck's daughter and her tomboy antics along with her brother and their friend.
2290;What is centre stage is the children and their vision of the proceedings and the danger they are placed in from those who hate Peck's advocacy of a black man's justice.
2291;the music and overall atmosphere of the film describing quiet southern town life evokes a bygone age of innocence, friendliness and charm .
2292;The music if very special.
2293;this film got several oscars including best actor for Gregory Peck.
2294;truly an American classic and the best aspects of humanity from a south US heartland.
2295;One of the best movies and acting performances of all time.
2296;Fantastic and raw look into our countries past.
2297;I will enjoy watching it many times.
2298;I like the movie very much.
2299;One of my favorite movies, a classic.
2300;I think it's nice to have both Blu.
2301;It moved me, for the first time, very deeply, and haunted me with it's quiet and unflinching look at racism, seen through the eyes of the purest of us all, children.
2302;I identified with Jem and Scout and Dill and wished I could go with them on the heart.
2303;stopping excursions to Boo's house"
2304;The setting is wonderful, the gifts in the tree from Boo are touching, and the feeling of sorrow when Mr. Radley fills up the hole is profound.
2305;Dill, the character drawn directly from Truman Capote, is one of my favorite characters, the old.young wisdom and mature vocabulary are a joy to watch.
2306;Calpurnia is solid and comforting in the fast.
2307;changing world of the Finch household, and you are glad she is there.
2308;room scene is riveting, as is the byplay in the balcony, where Jem, Dill and Scout sneak in and watch the proceedings.
2309;so thankful is he that Atticus, although losing the case, has nevertheless made a strong statement by virtue of the fact that he kept the jury out so long.
2310;Make no mistake, To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best films of all time.
2311;It is beautiful, emotional, and touching from beginning to end.
2312;The acting is superb (both Peck and the children) and the black.
2313;Add to that the screenplay adapted from Lee's great novel, Bernstein's evocative score, and thoughtful directing, and it is easy to see why this is considered a timeless classic.
2314;there are those who read the book and watch the film, expecting to see a movie that is an accurate incarnation of the book, and are dissapointed.
2315;For the film portrays the book almost perfectly.
2316;both the events and the theme and heart of the story.
2317;they are both masterpieces of their own mediums.
2318;Thus, it is important to look at the film without the book in mind, and if you can do this, you will undoubtedly be impressed by the beautiful film.
2319;The extras are pretty good, and the film is preserved in very good shape.
2320;Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus is inspired and brilliant.
2321;I thought Colin Wilcox was exceptional as Violet Ewell.
2322;(Badham still receives fan mail from all over the world from fans of her portrayal) She was perfect for the role as she was a real .
2323;life Southerner and, having never acted in films before, a complete natural.
2324;I loved the character of Scout in the book and I love her in the movie.
2325;Harper Lee must have been pleased with Mary Badham's performance which I think is a classic of it's kind.
2326;"Philip Alford is almost as good as Jem
2327;it's one of the truly scary scenes.
2328;Alice Ghostley is funny as Dill's Aunt Stephanie who warns sternly about the dangers of hanging around the Radley place.
2329;Brock Peters is terrific as Tom Robinson, and Estelle Evans is wonderful as the much.
2330;I firmly believe that the score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the most beautifully haunting of ANY score done for a film and totally appropriate to the movie.
2331;the story of Scout and Jem, and the summer they grew up.
2332;Well, when you write the best.
2333;That is probably why it was nominated for eight Academy Awards in 1962, including best picture, best actor (Gregory Peck), best actress in a supporting role (Mary Badham), best director (Robert Mulligan), best screenplay, best black and white cinematography, best black and white art direction and best original musical score.
2334;The movie won two of the eight awards, best art direction and best actor.
2335;If you consider that the book was written in 1960, this is not a minor point, but on the contrary it is a very powerful statement.
2336;The movie also does a great job in portraying the qualities found in the character of Atticus Finch, a father who is raising two kids by himself, after losing his wife, and is doing a splendid job at it.
2337;Second because there are passages of the book that were left out, and although they are not crucial to the story they give it a certain charm (for example the visit of Jem and Scout to Calpurnia's church).
2338;To be honest I was dreading watching this movie, didnt seem to be the kind of movie i enjoyed being it was an old, black and white movie.
2339;In my opinion, worth 5 stars!!
2340;story of this movie moved my heart.
2341;What a brave man the main character was!
2342;One of the best movies .
2343;All his movies are good.
2344;great movie for the family, definitely recommend for teenage studentswow loved this movie, and wish Amazon did not have this word countdown
2345;We shall say """"To kill a mockingbird"""" is a classic of the century that unfolds reality into film with profound simplicity."""
2346;Its character development along with the approach of realism supersedes many contemporary works of literature and film.
2347;The historic flavor of the film creates an impression of a southern community of America during the great depression.
2348;Its amazing reality of children's life that is so universal.
2349;It created a reality of vividing contention that helps the viewers to understand how the children see and think about the world.
2350;It also calls into attention of the activities that children by their vary nature involve in a family.
2351;For instance, Scout and Jem who are the central characters have enormous interests in scary yet joyful venture to Boo Radly's house even after being forbidden by their father.
2352;the phenomenal curiosity of children is almost inescapable from the viewer's notice in the movie.
2353;That gives us the idea of their emotional reopens to the world and family relationships.
2354;As you will see, if you watch the movie, their father atticuls who has been a significant moral authority to them.
2355;He has great influence on how they develop the ideas of people and differences of good and evil that remain in their fantasy world.
2356;the story of the movie has a unique way to tell you about a community and what is going on to its families.
2357;It takes us to the journey to reflect on our own childhood fantasy world and the adventures that still remains in our mind a thrill.
2358;time best movies ever made.
2359;The narrative is smooth and the screenplay keeps you on your edge.
2360;the story is set in Alabama during the Great Depression.
2361;there's some good acting although Gregory Peck's wooden oh.
2362;In the end, the courtroom scenes are perhaps the only engaging bit I would recommend this movie for.
2363;While I could have ordered this when my class began reading the book, but hey life gets in the way.
2364;The package arrived within a matter of days and was in great condition.
2365;A gripping story of blind racism in a Depression.
2366;era small town in Alabama.
2367;defining performance that earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor.
2368;Based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning best seller, the direction, acting, and the musical score enhances the story beyond the book (by giving flesh and blood to the characters).
2369;I thought it was a very good portrayal of the book and Gregory Peck was great!!
2370;I've seen it four times already, and it still holds up.
2371;It's considered one of the finest examples of family drama ever made.
2372;era Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, in history it still remains timeless.
2373;It's message still remains powerfully strong and resounding in our American society today.
2374;this message is just as very much important today as it was then.
2375;I recommend this to people of all ages.
2376;town Alabama lawyer and widower father of two.
2377;This is one of his best performances that got him the Oscar at the Academy Awards in 1962.
2378;They also overcome their fear of a mysterious, obscure and silent neighbor Boo Radley (Robert Duvall, in his brilliant screen debut).
2379;Some of the best classic lines from the movie when Atticus has a quiet moment with his children.
2380;because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy.
2381;what comes from this beautifully told film is a shining, intense drama that cleverly extracts the ideas of Harper Lee's heartfelt classic, a tremendously talented group of American actors brought together in one film and the magic of devoted artistry of screenplay and an outstanding score.
2382;It's strength has survived all the madness and complexity of today's so. called Hollywood cinema.

2391;The movie stays true to the story and has shortened the time frame of the story ingeniously.
2392;Gregory Peck is amazing as Atticus Finch.
2393;Some of the other cast members could've been better, but still an excellent movie.
2394;Its not a piece of great acting but its a really nice story and the little Girl Scott is really cute.
2395;If you want to see great acting, watch this movie.
2396;Gregory Peck's pressence in this film is awe inspiring.
2397;This is his greatest role in one of the best movies ever made.
2398;I honestly think this was one movie that made a difference in changing the course in the Civil Rights of all people at that time.
2399;Guess you can't please some people even if you do a fantastic job.
2400;Peck is superb as always.
2401;Bought as a gift for my husband, who loves musicals.
2402;He was excited to see it on Blu.
2403;I have seen the movie many times but ordered for my volunteer work at a Senior Care Home.
2404;One of the best films of all time.
2405;Gregory Peck is perfect in the role as is the entire cast.
2406;The subject is as relevant to today as when the film was made.
2407;The print is like you are seeing it in the theater.
2408;To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite movies of all time.
2409;As a film critic, I can appreciate the masterful directing and acting .
2410;Every movie collection should have this one in it!
2411;This item was a gift for Christmas, that my father .
2412;This is one of my favorite movies ever.
2413;A true classic based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Harper Lee.
2414;It's good to see a movie about family and life's lessons without seeing one single thing getting blown up.
2415;Nonetheless the plot and the theme still haunt our present lives.
2416;One of the great films in the history of cinema.
2417;I love a studio who respects their classics and Universal certainly got the job done with this title.
2418;It looks like it was filmed yesterday with great contrast and luminosity.
2419;It's a very pleasant experience to enjoy a classic like this in your home, I felt like I was somewhere in a movie theatre in 1962.
2420;I like the featurette showing how they restore the Universal classics, very informative.
2421;I loved the movie experience so much that I bought The Deer hunter also from that 100th anniversary of Universal studios.
2422;Same thing, the picture was amazing,very colorful and rich.
2423;It matched the book fairly well.
2424;I enjoyed the movie, but the book was definitely better.
2425;Watch it with your children several times.
2426;it is appropriate for adults and children who can handle stories involving racial prejudice.
2427;harper Lee, and everyone involved with this movie, have blessed us all with this gift.
2428;You can't create a perfect world, where all men are created equal.
2429;I watch it every year or so.
2430;This is a movie the whole family can watch and enjoy.
2431;Harper Lee was able to capture those magical and enchanted feelings that accompany nostalgic reminiscence of ones childhood, and the creators of this wonderful film manage to adapt this to the screen with elegance and brilliance.
2432;On top of that, it is accompanied by a great score by Elmer Bernstein and some fantastic acting, most notably by Gregory Peck who was exactly how I had pictured Atticus and portrays his dignity and virtue exquisitely.
2433;Fast and smooth transaction all the way.
2434;One of the best movies I have in my inventory.
2435;Now on to my review:First off, I've always loved this film and it was the story, acting and the photography that always captured me since I saw the film when it was released.
2436;now Universal has restored it and the print is great.

2440;def of the special features.
2441;for all the material on this marvelous set from Universal, a copy belongs in every home .
2442;i hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
2443;TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, based upon Harper Lee's wonderful book, is one of the finest films of all time.
2444;Boo is played by a very young Robert Duvall in his first major (albeit small) film role.
2445;like the book, the movie has genuine heart.
2446;Absolutely one of the best classic movies.
2447;A must watch and own movie for anyone's collection.
2448;The sound track music is beautiful.
2449;the external plot unfolds in the formative years of the children and has a distinct impact on their relationship with an ostracized neighbor.
2450;The plot ends when the children welcome Boo as a friend.
2451;to Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful story with a great idea: that growing up means overcoming prejudice.
2452;Overall the point of the story is well taken and appreciated.
2453;This movie is a fitting tribute to a terrific novel.
2454;Both of them are outstanding.
2455;This extremely well done movie colorfully depicts the Southern America in all its flavors, slow moving life, white trashes, racism and all.
2456;The movie is a pretty faithful reproduction of the original story except for the fact that it's centered much more around the lawsuit in which a young afro.
2457;Gregory Peck did a superb job of portraying the silent but forceful lawyer Atticus Finch, and the children, especially Scout was so natural, can't forget her expression of awe at Atticus picking up the gun and killing a rogue dog.
2458;The movie elegantly depicts the social values, mutual respect (and the lack of it between 'whites' and the then 'coloreds'), financial and moral struggles of the South of yesterday.
2459;I love the book To Kill a Mockingbird .
2460;"The movie is great
2461;I received this movie quickly and got it for a great price.
2462;In its time it was obviously cutting edge due to the content.
2463;The only parts that I truly enjoyed were when it got to the trial and from then on to the end.
2464;Again, one of my favorite movies of all time, which I decided I had to add to my collection.
2465;The love portrayed between the father and his children, and the contrast of the racial bigotry and hatred exhibited by the town is stunning.
2466;This is a movie that moves me to tears at the end every time I see it.
2467;the whole family loves this movie.
2468;This anniversary edition has lots of extras which the true To Kill a Mockingbird fan will enjoy.
2469;To Kill a Mockingbird has always been one of my favorite movies and the 50th anniversary edition is no exception.
2470;The movie and the bonus features are and always will be a treasured part of my movie collection.
2471;I consider this one of the best movies ever made and had to add it to my collection of favorite movies.
2472;timeless and moving no matter how many times you've viewed it !
2473;The cast is fantastic !
2474;The movie is amazing and follows the book very closely.
2475;My husband had never seen the movie and was riveted by it.
2476;Gregory Peck captures Atticus' demeanor to a t!
2477;While I would still not substitute the movie for the book, the movie was ultimately able to capture the essence of the book.
2478;An incredible movie in all the ways that make a movie good.
2479;I saw this film 50 years ago, and remember it like it was last week.
2480;I felt it was time that she saw the life breathed into them by this stellar cast.
2481;This movie definitely shows the talent of some of the best actors of all times.
2482;It is definitely something for the family to enjoy no matter what time of day or year it is.
2483;The film is a classic starring Oscar Winner, Gregory Peck, in the character that became his signature role.
2484;The supporting cast is equally stellar with the children, Jem and Scout.
2485;Scout is immortalized by her performance as a tough but sensitive young girl.
2486;The 50th Anniversary Edition of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a fantastic 2.
2487;disc set that gives this American classic the treatment it deserves.
2488;The film itself is crystal clear, the sound (and score) are magnificent, and the bonus features included in this package alone are worth the price of admission.
2489;of documentary, Fearful Symmetry, is particularly well done.
2490;This movie is superbly written and acted, there doesn't appear to be a wasted frame in the entire running time.
2491;The story here (much like its source material) is heartwarming, heartbreaking, tear.
2492;This movie has received a lot of attention and hype over its year, and it is all well.
2493;This has got to me, in my opinion, the best movie ever made.
2494;This is a must see movie for everyone.
2495;:)My husband loves this movie!
2496;Not only is this his favorite movie, it's also a collector's edition AND it has CC!
2497;I really appreciate Amazon's extensive movie selection.
2498;This is one of those rare cases where a great book is turned into a great film.
2499;The kids who played his kids did a great job too, especially the girl who played Scout.
2500;It is 50 years old but just as good now as then.
2501;This movie has it all: great acting, great script, great story!
2502;I just love the gentle fair.
2503;This movie is in black and white which gives it a dream.
2504;I think this movie is a masterpiece, has no dated feel to it, and if anything is impressive for it's genuis in American film making and the care, thought and artistry that went into it.
2505;Just hearing the first few seconds of the main theme can bring a smile to your face.
2506;The scene where the two children are talking about their mother while their dad sits alone in the swing will break your heart.
2507;I've watched this movie dozens and dozens of times and will continue to watch it from time to time simply because it is perfect.
2508;Everything worth talking about is in that one story: love, faithfulness, respect, reliability, honesty, integrity, courage.
2509;These things are woven into a canvas of delightful humour and beautifully simple but intelligent language.
2510;the film is remarkably faithful both to the written story and to the characters and values therein.
2511;He stands up for the defendant and is a good attorney.
2512;His voice was wonderful to listen to and he expressed his feelings in his special way.
2513;When he shows his love for someone you can feel it and bringing the son next to him is showing his strong feelings for his son.
2514;To see him on screen makes you see the kind of man that he really was.
2515;One of the finest movies ever made.
2516;Great promotion of the depression era.
2517;I watched this movie upon recommendation from someone I respect.
2518;Great movie to watch and learn along with kids.
2519;This movie is a classic that deals with human relationships in a challenging situation.
2520;It also deals with youth growing up at a dificult time.
2521;Imdb is also an excellent resource for information on the movie, particularly on Gregory Peck.
2522;movie evaluation, the movie is still awesome.
2523;This movie was Robert Duvall's cinema debut.
2524;Gregory Peck is amazing as Atticus Finch, the protagonist.
2525;Scout (Mary Bedham), Jem (Phillip Alford), and Dill (Lee's portrait in literature of her friend Truman Capote) are unforgettable characters, as well.
2526;american actors are extremely talented, too.
2527;The book is so much more enjoyable than the movie because the book has interesting pieces that were left out of the move (probably for time sake).
2528;it is a true classic and everyone should see and read it at least once.
2529;I decided they would enjoy it and perhaps some of the messages in the movies might be valuable.
2530;I never tire of viewing this classic, and I watch it at least once a year, if not more often.
2531;Gregory Peck is brilliant and so are all the other actors and actresses.
2532;How about the filming, directing, writing, plot, casting?
2533;Well, As good as it gets would be a suitable way of how I rate this movie compared to all others.

2543;Great message about life and who we are and how things are not always as they seem.
2544;Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between.
2545;luck pennies, and our lives.
2546;TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a classic, a masterpiece, and one of the best films of the sixties.
2547;Gregory Peck is at his best here, and although his character is the star, the film is told through the eyes of his two children.
2548;It's simply a great film.
2549;face meeting with Boo Radley nearly brought tears to my eyes.
2550;That is a classic moment in this classic movie.
2551;Family friend played Scout in a play and she did a great job in pertraying in 1963 Scout with Gregory Peck.
2552;He stood up for what is right.
2553;Of course it goes without saying that this is a classic .
2554;one of the best movies of all time!
2555;I teach this book in my reading classes at a community college, and it is very convenient to be able to order the movie as a digital download and bring it right up on the PC in my classroom to show on the projector.
2556;I was glued to this movie!
2557;Gregory Peck is a great actor and this movie was really good!
2558;I first read the book and loved it so when the movie came out I had to watch it.
2559;If you have read the book you will love the movie.
2560;The charters are so real.
2561;He really is a good man and would never touch a white woman.
2562;And Gregory Peck is wonderful as his lawyer.
2563;Top of the line movie.
2564;There is a lot of interesting differences between the present America and the one in years of 1930's that I have found after watching this movies.
2565;The film also teaches you what is the courage, how to be courageous and in what situation we need to be courageous.
2566;I am highly pleased with this product.
2567;To Kill a Mockingbird is every bit as relevant today as it was when it first came out.
2568;As a teacher, the movie is a great common experience that we can use to start the discussion of race, justice, and the societal impacts of poverty.
2569;This is my wife's favorite movie and novel.
2570;Gregory Peck captures the main character, Atticus Finch, to perfection.
2571;The Academy Award was richly deserved.
2572;Harper Lee was able to capture the mood of the time in this novel.
2573;Based on one of the world's great novels and that rare movie that rises to the level of the printed word.
2574;Atticas shows how to be a real man.
2575;A great movie, especially in black and white, it is so powerful.
2576;Good timing and disk played well!
2577;The packaging was meticulous and the item matched the description perfectly!
2578;One of the classic movies,how could you not love this?
2579;Would recommend this as an addition to any movie collection.
2580;This movie does a wonderful job capturing the issues Harper Lee brings up.
2581;however, Gregory Peck is truly amazing as Atticus Finch, bringing the character to life.
2582;I dare say, if I ever read the book again, I'll visualize most of these actors and actresses.
2583;It was actually a good movie and glad that I watched it.
2584;Though readers of the book will miss the many wonderful subplots, the movie is still delights and saddens in all the right ways.
2585;This anniversary edition is worth the investment for any movie collection.
2586;ray fan because I don't think they are worth the extra cost for all the hype.
2587;This version works for me.
2588;gregory Peck embodies Atticus Finch and the bonus features reveal such tidbits as his meeting of Harper Lee during filming of the movie began a lifetime relationship between her and the Peck family.
2589;Haper Lee was a notorious recluse, so this was quite an interesting bit of news.
2590;the 50th Anniversary edition includes 2 discs, one for the movie and one for the Bonus Features.
2591;So annoying!The best features are: A Conversation With Gregory Peck and Scout Remembers .
2592;These offer fun insights into filming and how cast members were selected.
2593;Plus it's fun to see Scout all grown up!
2594;Although his speech is quite insightful as to the man, given what he chooses to talk about.
2595;Fearful Symmetry is a good look at the overall making of the film and repeats a bit of what occurs in A Conversation With Gregory Peck and Scout Remembers .
2596;It's interesting in its own right regarding the general loss of film and importance of restoration.
2597;For those of us who love older movies, we can appreciate that the importance of restoration was discovered before more of the history of film was lost.
2598;A great perspective on the book.
2599;this is not only a great, great movie.
2600;brilliant script, direction and especially performances, but it comes with all the great extras.
2601;this is one of a handful of movies everyone should own
2602;This is a great classic and the story line has held up well throughout the years!
2603;A must have for movie buffs
2604;This will give you a birds eye view of how racism was in the old south.
2605;It was truly an excellent historical drama.
2606;This film has such an evocative title sequence we're amazed to learn that Saul Bass didn't do it.
2607;Mockingbird begins delivering in narrative, performance and craftsmanship soon enough, and it does so in beautiful black.
2608;Their tribute to the white man who defended a black one in a losing cause is unexpectedly moving.
2609;Another great movie that can be enjoyed by everyone in the family.
2610;It was great to see it again after all these years.
2611;This movie has my 8 year old and 6 year old captivated.
2612;It has such a strong moral direction.
2613;Even children understand the value of being fair to one another.
2614;I saw this movie when it first came out and enjoyed it almost as much some five decades later!
2615;Forget the fact that you can see the California mountains in the background and focus on the story.
2616;The film adaptation of Harper Lee's classic novel is spellbindingly wonderful.
2617;Gergory Peck is at his absolute best as Atticus Finch and the rest of the cast is equally impressive.
2618;digital transfer of the film is first rate.
2619;And despite the colored images on the box, the film remains in it original, glorious black and white.
2620;Sharper images and a classic retooled for the better.
2621;The extras are almost as great to watch as the original film.
2622;This film belongs to an era when craftsmanship was an important part of storytelling.
2623;The film is informed with the southern atmosphere but ironically was shot entirely on Universal's backlot in Southern California.
2624;"all treated with respect as to their view of the world makes ""Mockingbird"" an enduring classic that aged incredibly well."
2625;Like the best wines the rich themes in this film continue to resonate and intoxicate an audience nearly fifty years after the film was made.
2626;That's a testament to great filmmaking.
2627;While director Mulligan and producer Pakula would make a number of other notable and powerful films, this is the first pillar in their long careers and because of its strength the rest of their best films could be made.
2628;They should also be recognized for the exceptional job they've done with this re.
2629;The soundtrack is equally good with a top notch 5.1 new transfer as well as the original 2.0 mono soundtrack.
2630;the second disc features the bulk of the extras with two marvelous documentaries one of them brand new to this edition.
2631;Peck comes across with his usual sense of sincerity and is engaging.
2632;Interweaving that footage with location interviews with the people of the town that Lee wrote about in the book (where she herself grew up) , it's a fascinating glimpse into the fantasy vs. reality of Lee's world and how they intersect.
2633;Universal has done a truly spectacular job with this re.
2634;release to commemorate this classic film.
2635;If you have the earlier edition, this edition does offer the advantage of a new documentary, the lobby cards as well as a brilliant transfer of the classic film while retaining most of the extras from the previous edition.
2636;It's well worth visting with Atticas Finch and his family again.
2637;Not many will proably agree, but in a way, this is film noir, even though the subject material is touching.
2638;"Possibly one of the most perfect films with THE most perfect opening credits (these alone will set you into a fit of tears, especially if you know the story), ""Mockingbird"" has inspired generations and will continue to do so."
2639;SHould be a big hit.
2640;We read the book and then watched the movie and the kids loved it.
2641;I had a report due and i was able to watch this movie and do the report.
2642;this is america at it's finest and best.
2643;and to see a world through scout's eyes is a special and treasured thing.
2644;But it was worth the wait.
2645;town lawyer raising a boy and a girl to do the right things and think the right thoughts.
2646;Famous for many things, the movie features a child character based on Truman Capote, and a mysterious neighbor played by Robert Duvall in his film debut.
2647;The music and cinematography are both superb.
2648;We all know this is one of the finest films to ever be produced.
2649;Wonderful book by Harper Lee, strong adaptation by Horton Foote, perfect casting, starting with Gregory Peck, understated directing by Pakula, mesmerising music by Elmer Bernstein.
2650;Scout is the only other person involved that you see, and that was a wonderful extra.
2651;come on Hollywood, this is one of the best films ever made, you can give us more than this.
2652;winning novel by Harper Lee, a relative of Robert E. Lee.
2653;It is the story of a wise and kind man, Atticus Finch (Peck) raising a 10.
2654;old girl, Scout (Badham) in a small Alabama town in 1932, during the Great Depression with their friend Dill Harris, played by John Megna.
2655;Part of the reason I liked it was because it centered on kids.
2656;I think the acting was excellent.
2657;The children often seemed natural to me.
2658;I liked and admired Atticus, especially during his closing argument.
2659;James Anderson was good as a bigot, but I think his role could have been made more subtle.
2660;First of all the story is very compelling.
2661;One of the best novels about the south from back in the day.
2662;Very well written and masterfully perform by Mr. Peck and all the rest.
2663;It is hard to envision a better depiction of racial divides, bigotry, innocence, hidden love, and Finch as the ultimate Good.
2664;Despite its age, this film holds up well as a classic.
2665;While its focus is upon equal justice for all Americans, regardless of race, what comes through in Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch is the courage and nobility of character, in truth the heroism of his role without brovado.
2666;This is such a great movie it is my favorite.
2667;there are many fine reviews of this movie on this page.
2668;Even if you are not a fan of old school b&w, you will still love this classic film.
2669;The book is so much better.
2670;Robert Mulligan hardly directed any films of note, which is what makes To Kill a Mockingbird such a pleasant surprise.
2671;It is a stunning film, a fable of fear and prejudice told with striking visual flair.
2672;The haunting shadows and eerie hues of Russell Harlan's camerawork evoke the myths and nocturnal fears of childhood, and Elmer Bernstein's quintessentially American score supplements the imagery well, creating a film laden with atmosphere.
2673;The young Mary Badham and Philip Alford give excellent performances.
2674;the subject matter is bold for the time, and there is little evidence of the kind of bowdlerization that plagued many other films of the same, and an earlier, era.
2675;The heart of the film is very simple: It wants very earnestly to show us that prejudice and bigotry are nothing but those childhood fears, borne of ignorance, and resolved by those brave enough to step beyond the barriers, confronting their fears, and, in so doing, finding that differences are nothing to be scared of.
2676;We somehow got very fortunate in this country (look around in the world and you'll agree), we have a unique and fair constitution and enough honest, innocent and brave people who are willing to defend it against the dark forces of ignorance, prejudice and racism.
2677;This is a story about one of them, and a reminder of what a high price tag is paid when the dark forces prevail, even for a split of a second.
2678;I absolutely love everything about this movie.
2679;It's just so intriguing to me.
2680;It makes me want to go back and live in the Great Depression.
2681;executed vision of a classic novel.
2682;The movie carries all of the impact of the book, with a perfect cast bringing to life the familiar characters.
2683;Scout, Atticus Finch and Boo Radley all come to life in crisp black and white.
2684;challenging subject matter in it's time, the themes are still valid today.
2685;This movie, and the book it comes from, help ease the transition.
2686;This movie shows the truth of life and the unfair things that can happen.
2687;I love how this film shows that people don't have to succeed to be heroes.
2688;To Kill a Mockingbird , is a fabulous story.
2689;Gregory Peck and the Cast are perfect examples of superb acting.
