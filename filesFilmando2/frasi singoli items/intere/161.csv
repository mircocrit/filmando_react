id;spiegazione
1;forbidden Planet is a movie I saw with my fother when I was a kid.
2;i rate this seller excellent.
3;Forbidden Planet still excites me, even though I saw it as new in the 1950s.
4;although Robbie is a loveible character with one of the great lines in Sci.
5;the film is a big influence on Star Wars: George Lucas watched it constantly when writing the script and Star Trek, too.
6;Thank you for the happy memories of the best sci.
7;Most of the movie actually makes sense!
8;it was interesting to see how many of the cast/crew are still living.
9;Special effects are stunning for the time.
10;Sound and music was absolutely incredible.
11;It's interesting to look back at the early science fiction writers (mostly scientist) and see what they envisioned for the future.
12;Equally impressive is the conceptualization by Hollywood.
13;In an age where giant radioactive monsters attacked, and stalwart scientist/heroes battled alien menaces, Forbidden Planet stands proud as an A picture: A handsomely.
14;mounted interstellar adventure filled with intelligence, wit and wonder.
15;now's it's the 50th anniversary of this landmark MGM masterpiece, and sci.
16;fi fans (and movie lovers in general) are being rewarded with this deluxe 2.
17;Exploring the Far Reaches of Forbidden Planet is a great documentary, in which we are fortunate to see many surviving cast members.
18;You'll learn how the id monster was created, and see Bebe Barron discuss the film's electronic tonalities.
19;There's also a fun featurette on the creation and cultural impact of Robby the Robot.
20;Most impressive is the inclusion of the 1957 follow.
21;up film THE INVISIBLE BOY, featuring much of the Forbidden Plaent creative team and, of course, Robby the Robot.
22;But I encourage even those who aren't familiar with Forbidden Planet to add this to your collection.
23;It's a deluxe presentation of an acknowledged classic, one you're sure to enjoy for years to come.
24;It's a product worth the money and I had bought the forbidden planet disc but saw the additional disc and hadn't seen the other movies in a long time.
25;A masterpiece movie that has been greatly underrated and was/remain a strong inspiration for SF movies like Star Trek .
26;When I saw this film on cinema I wasnt at legal age.
27;fan and manage to get me in.
28;it was the scariest movie I ever seen at that time, but I loved it.
29;today its fun to relive that moment from the past.
30;thanks for putting it on Blu.
31;dr. Morbius had the perfect planet of pleasure all to himself with his gorgeous daughter until his subconcious came to life in monster form and almost broke through his barracaded ultra modern interior designed Jetson's style house.
32;the green sky of the pleasure planet matched the avacado green walls, and the rust red soil matched the carpet of his home.
33;Metal sculpture and sophisticated mid century modern sofas and chairs in metalic mauve fabric brought home the futuristic concept of this amazingly well done movie.
34;iV is, she/he does space age modern design very well.
35;this movie displays everything we were thinking about in the nineteen fifties as science fiction was just starting to come into reality with the excitement of Sputnik and UFO's orbiting overhead in the night sky and reflected in our new ultra modern design of our homes.
36;It was a time of great excitement about what might lie out there in space.
37;The charm of this era was captured gloriously in this amazing movie.
38;For the time, one of the best sic.
39;All my grown children enjoy watching it as well.
40;Nice package, the extras are fun,and a beautiful version of one of the best Sci Fi Films of all time!
41;Best sci fi movie of the era.
42;Got a lot of the science right.
43;Ending a little flat, could have been spiced up, but satisfying.
44;I believe that Forbidden Planet created the Space Sci.
45;If you like spcience fiction, Leslie Neilsen, or being shocked into silence, this is a must.
46;One of the classic sci.
47;fi movies worth watching over and over!
48;A terrific combination of plot , acting and special effects.
49;Forbidden Planet is full of TV and movie stars of my childhood and into adulthood.
50;The movie was made before all the computer genertated movies of today and has great special effects for it's time.
51;I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys SciFi.
52;This movie instantly captivates u and brings u back to the good ole days when u were a kid and looked up at the night sky and dreamed of outer space.
53;Great acting and an eerie and unique musical score help meld this movie's landscape and story into a classic that will live on forever.
54;This film will live on to represent mankind's vision of the very far future and how during the years, our views of the future change.
55;inspired imagination, today's films are commercialized and cannibalized to create profit.
56;Watching this film, you can see that it was very influential in the derivative Star Trek and Star Wars.
57;You can see that all other sci fi movies that came after this one were molded after Forbidden plant.
58;It's timeless just like the Day the Earth Stood still.
59;I tried to see it on prime and I was surprised there was a fee to see it.
60;This movie is definitely a classic.
61;It has elements that excite and intrigue.
62;I watched this for the first time the other day and was impressed with the level of detail, and the special effects they employed in the film.
63;The 'particle effects' used are still nice even to this day.
64;The story is good and true science fiction.
65;Over all it's a well done movie, and enjoyable for people of all ages who like SciFi.
66;Go ahead, rub your eyeballs, but you read correctly
67;So many of the best sci.
68;fi writers and movies made since Forbidden Planet were inspired to some degree by this movie, and it's easy to see why.
69;what makes the best movies so good is: Story (again, thank you Mr. Shakespeare), interesting characters (Star Wars epi.
70;I, II, and III: FAIL), and the interpersonal relationships (why?
71;because we're human, that's why).
72;way, the 'electricity monster' is visually scary still, even today, which is also amazing.
73;And the inclusion of the beautiful Anne Francis is just as good as (better?)
74;even though the star, Leslie Nielsen, is known for his (mostly) excellent later comedies (Airplane!
75;, The Naked Gun, etc.), he handles drama well enough (but does comedy better, in my opinion), and Anne Francis is beautiful and beautifully cast as the Mad Scientist's daughter.
76;Robby The Robot is worthy of mention, being one of the best robots ever to come from any science.
77;Even the secondary and tertiary characters are respectably acted and believable, however small the part.
78;All that you see on screen is in a state of equilibrium, and works.
79;i'd mention the changes and/or improvement in the Blu.
80;fi buffs, but everyone who enjoys a good story, good acting, and good visuals.
81;My highest recommendation of any movie, any movie type.
82;In a decade of giant bugs movies and ultra low budgets Forbidden Planet stands out as a film of wit, intelligence and impressive special effects.
83;The extras are a must for the person who likes the inside look of the film making process.
84;I could go on about the sterling qualities of this film:an intelligent plot, great acting by the lead characters (evenLeslie Nielsen in his pre.
85;fi filmever, but it certainly places in everyone's top ten.
86;Five starsand two thumbs up!
87;This movie is one of the great classic SCi Fi movies of all times.
88;Sound clarity is present, one can distinctly hear the breathing of the id monster as it approaches and ascends the stairs of the starship, even while the guards are speaking.
89;FP has it all, huge production value, strong classic story, incredible visuals, stunning special effects, electronic music, Roby the Robot, the Krell, Anne Francis.
90;I watch it about once every two or three years and it still holds up after all these years.
91;Truly an amazing film for its day and even now.
92;One of my top 10 fave movies of all time and to see it on wide screen brings so much more depth to the viewer, how can you not concentrate on the backdrops, props, and green sky with 2 moons.
93;fi movies, definitely took sci.
94;A brilliant film and a a great chance to see Leslie Neilsen play it straight (well nearly, at any rate).
95;The film is a classic and was, at the time, a fresh take on an even older classic (The Tempest).
96;up job (check out how clean the titles look) and has some interesting extras including a whole extra film (which is quaint but you wouldn't pay for it in isolation).
97;overall great fun, good value and a classic reminder of early evening sc.
98;handsome guy, beautiful girl way cool robot and deadly dangerous enemy.
99;It is truly amazing to see how much this film has influenced Sci.
100;Definitely recommend watching this movie.
101;It's wryly humorous to watch early Nielson, Holliman, etc.
102;For its time, the effects are well done.
103;We are glad to have this available to enjoy once again.
104;One of my favorite movies, this and war of the worlds from the 50's.
105;good, old fashioned sci fi at it's best.
106;Kids even got into it.
107;Really fun to see Leslie Nielson young and serious.
108;Love everything about this movie.
109;fi.you will love Forbidden Planet!
110;A five star movie because it was.
111;The extras are awesome (with documentaries, interviews and original trailers) and the restoration in High definition is perfect.
112;ray to every science fiction fan.
113;Quite possibly the best sci.
114;The effects were stunning for the era.
115;The soundtrack is pure Theramin.
116;Great color and sound on this digital re.
117;The movie itself is a classic on so many levels.
118;this particular package contains promotional items that the movie buff, at least, will find intriguing.
119;The film itself is surprisingly non.
120;The new color reproduction is great and nothing looks odd.
121;This movie is a classic science fiction movie.
122;I would recommend this movie to my friends.
123;I find it really interesting to watch these old sci.
124;Forbidden Planet, technically, is a marvel.
125;Im stunned that this film was made in 1956.
126;The visual effects are quite fantastic.
127;The film itself is decent, but the film does tend to drag a bit in the center, and the obvious tendency to throw in a love angle is kind of distracting, but the art direction is stellar and the iconic Robby the Robot is well worth seeing.
128;I wish that Walter Pidgeon would have done more with the role, since it was rather rich, but he comes off stale and in the end this becomes a decent at best sci.
129;fi film that is more memorable for its technical achievement than its story.
130;fi fan), and it would be even harder not to love it.
131;fi are represented, and the storyline is a very cerebral and provocative one.
132;and seeing a very young Leslie Nielsen in a heroic and romantic role is great.
133;and Anne Francis is very easy on the eyes as well, made all the better by being a strong and intelligent foil, not just there for the scenery.
134;something else ahead of it's time and a template for the Ripleys and the Uhuras that were to follow.
135;all of this depth and thoughtful story, and Robby the Robot too!
136;d2 and C.3P0 (George Lucas had to have had this guy in mind) adds cerebral value, some amount of menace, and even comedic relief to this overall staple of the genre.
137;The new digital transfer print of this classic sci.
138;fi movie gives the movie a new life for another generation.
139;Watching this gem you will be able to see the influence that it had on the directors of today, Riddley Scott, George Lucas, James Cameron and Steven Spielberg.
140;The clarity of the images printed on the tin box are amazing.
141;All up, a definitive version well worth owning.
142;region player had no problem with the region 1 enhanced coding.
143;Animation and special effects are provided by Walt Disney's Joshua Meador.
144;Robby's voice is Marvin Miller, best remembered as check.
145;He was primarily a chorister in musicals.
146;I always enjoy watching this Sci Fi movie.
147;robby Robot, lasers and other special effects!
148;Think this is my favorite all time sci.
149;Still the quintessential grand daddy of most of today's sci.
150;my suggestion is to watch the wide screen version, on the opposite side of the disk, turn off the lights and watch it on a large screen if you can.
151;It is well worth it!The actors are great
152;Anne Francis and Leslie Nielsen are great together and the Cinemascope does the rest.
153;This movie is great, always liked it as a kid when it was shown on Sunday afternoons.
154;Maybe they should just leave it alone as a great Space Adventure Classic.
155;It featured a plot that was far more sophisticated and thoughtful than most movies today, some impressive (for the 1950's) set designs and special effects, and a really weird score.
156;In the right hands (Ridley Scott would be a good choice),a remake could be quite a hit.
157;i still remember the tingle of apprehension I got the first time I heard Robbie say,Morbius, something approaching from the South West.
158;The eerie electronic score and sound effects also make this a film that stands out from the crowd of 50's Science Fiction,and the design of Robbie the Robot is so good it's still an impressive sight now.
159;The small Robbie is well detailed.
160;The house poster cards are a nice touch.
161;overall opinion I'm a happy chappie with this product.
162;With it's revolutionary electronic sound track and dated SP/FX, combined with a healthy portion of suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer, this movie can still be enjoyed for its quaint eeriness.
163;Robbie the Robot still steals the show.
164;It remains enjoyable after numerous viewings.
165;I like this movie first, because it clean and good for the whole family.
166;I like old movies and this is an oldie loving movie.
167;This one is not full of violence, although there are some, but the main story is a good story.
168;Im a pretty big fan of sci.
169;I found this to be quite a memorable film.
170;ray edition is most likely a fan of this classic film so I will answer your one question, yes it is well worth getting.
171;Let the laughs come from well.
172;Forbidden Planet is a great movie, if you really understand it.
173;As fun as this movie is, this is the sad truth and kids nowadays are impressed by video games and other stuff.
174;You will see so many specks and dirt on the picture.
175;All in all, this is a good movie, but you need to be the kind to enjoy it.
176;art at its cinematic finest: cool spacepeople, robots, spaceships and rayguns
177;A must see and have for sci.
178;fi fans of all ages.
179;core science fiction fan, and appreciative of it's Shakespeare, I can relate to the thought and care that this film enjoys.
180;The features added to the collection are great to view, with Robbie the Robot as the centerpiece of attention.
181;in all, I got a pretty good deal for the price, and am satisfied with the films.
182;still fascinating after all these years.
183;They go out and look around, and spot a vehicle coming toward them at high speed, kicking up a huge cloud of dust.
184;And all of a sudden, there's his daughter (Anne Frances), very young and sexy, and knowing nothing about men.
185;good, not great but good, movie.
186;Seen in the context of 1956, when it was made, it's really quite good.
187;But it's a nicely made film, and entertaining.
188;But dang it i love it.
189;I remember seeing it at an outdoor movies place.
190;And it is one of those movies you cant get out of your mind,,, Watch it you will love.
191;My husband likes these old time sci.
192;It was pretty good for what it was.
193;It is fun to see what they have to represent future technology.
194;It's still my favorite science fiction movie in terms of plot.
195;It was good the first time I saw it, even better this time.
196;And now I can see it any time I want.
197;Forbidden Planet is up there with War of the Worlds, and other classic sci.
198;the movie was great I watch it over and again.
199;This is a great box set.
200;It is well worth the price.
201;The little Robby is so nice plus the mini lobby cards.
202;I have been fascinated with this movie since I first saw it decades ago.
203;The special effects were especially good for that age of this film.
204;and a terrific cast with LEADING MAN OF ACTION Leslie Nielsen, beautiful Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon, Warren Stevens, Jack Kelly, Earl Holliman, and character actor Richard Anderson, plus:Freudian Psychology, a murder mystery, and a classic boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl love story with a white hot finish, and it's nothing less than the best science fiction movie ever made!!!
205;Great classic science fiction movie, one of my favorites.
206;remastered with great color and clarity.
207;fi fan as well as anyone interested in great story telling!
208;This package has it all.
209;The price was right, let your kids see what was real our vision of the future.
210;Great entertainment and great memories of younger days hahaha.
211;FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the seminal Science.
212;fiction movies ofthe 1950s, the decade in which ALL the cinematic sci.
213;channel presentations of the film's great andunique electronic score.
214;It is also represents a unique collaboration between MGM and Disney studios.
215;This accounts for much of the cartoon like look of the film which in its time was totally convincing wonderfully detailed world(maybe a little dated by todays standards ).
216;This is one of the few scifi films ever to present the aliens as as something other than monsters in our own image.
217;This represents the Krell music (haunting) it is very unique and distinctive (to Forbidden Planet).
218;Of special note is the much loved Robby the Robot.
219;The Tempest script device is an excellent one as is Walter Pidgeon as the Magician.
220;all in all this is perhaps the best of 1950's Scifi Films.
221;I can only hope there is a new restoration with commentary and other extras in the works.
222;The Collectable Robbie Action figure is wonderfully detailed (but careful it is fragile)!
223;Forbidden Planet is one of the greatest sci.
224;It is probably the best ever from the 1950's.
225;Its story is top notch, and its special effects are excellent, especially considering the limited technology of that time.
226;one of the sexiest women in ANY galaxy) alive.
227;An unstoppable, invisible entity is unleashed, tearing crewmembers to pieces, while absorbing their laser blasts into it's incredible mass.
228;Will Walter Pidgeon and Anne Francis live on to star together again in Funny Girl with Barbra Streisand?
229;Always loved the robot Robbie, and the tour through the inside of the planets vast power source.
230;It always tickled me how Robbie could make a dress in a few hours with gems on it.
231;One of my favorite movies of all time, period.
232;This is a classic that I have watched many times.
233;A very influential film on future sci.
234;This movie was made in 1956, but really holds it's own.
235;Terrific special effects for the period.
236;Totally impressed with the picture.
237;The story is the strength of the film.
238;A terrific plot that really keeps you guessing and makes you think.
239;Happily they discover a survivor, Dr. Morbius.
240;thus begins a journey into a very good movie.
241;Add to that a really interesting story with some top.
242;rate actors and you have one of the really classic and most important sci.
243;Great to see it on Blu.
244;The sets where great and acting very good.
245;Watching the film in 2013 is just as entertaining as it was at time of release.
246;The story line is also good.
247;fi, the kind which is driven by the defining characteristic of the genre.
248;It was much more impressive to me to realize that the whole idea of `Star Trek' was based on some of the `Forbidden Planet' premises.
249;`The Day the Earth Stood Still' comes to mind as a critically successful movie of the time.
250;Even if Robbie was controlled by a human at a console at the end of a long cable, I was still impressed.
251;Another aspect of the movie which clearly set it apart from the rest of the pack is the distinctive nature of the sound track music.
252;the very best thing about the movie was the sophistication of the `what if' premise.
253;The part of Caliban is played, with a major overhaul, by Robbie, of course.
254;The rather amusing little encounter between the stereotyped ship's cook and Robbie makes a bigger contribution to the story than these romantic interests.
255;The heart of the movie is the basic premise of the Krell, their fantastic power sources and machines built into the heart of the planet, their effort to free themselves from material form, and their distruction upon unleashing hidden powers from the very Freudian notion of the id, short for libido.
256;fi, after all, where time travel and faster than light travel are possible, so sit back and enjoy the ride.
257;The best sci fi movie ever.
258;It is a must watch.
259;Robby the robot made the movie as well.
260;The other great sci fi movies are The Time Machine and War of the Worlds (without Tom Cruse).
261;This movie is a must see for any fan of science fiction.
262;There are certain stories that become cultural icons, and Forbidden Planet is one of them.
263;the basic story is covered in numerous other reviews and I recommend you read those.
264;Get this: A great sci.
265;wide screen (2.40:1), electronically created soundtrack, dazzling color.
266;I would love to see this re.
267;Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), who lives with his daughter, Altaira (the beautiful Anne Francis), born on the planet, and his articulate, handyman robot, Robby.
268;crude, but amazing they exist at all .
269;and lots of interesting tidbits that will engage you.
270;The 1956 version stands the test of time quite well.
271;Their silence was deafening, which made Louis and Bebe Baron's incredible tonalities soundtrack all the more enthralling.
272;I was mesmerized again for the umpteenth time.
273;candy in front of them or yell at them once in a while to get their attention back.
274;this is one of the five greatest Sci.
275;Forbidden Planet is the ultimate story of all time and the probable fate of man.
276;The kind of films that don't go for cheap laughs with bodily function jokes but are thought provoking and enlightening while being entertaining.
277;a really great movie IN COLOR even though it came out in 1956Some of you older people will recognize a lot of the stars, as most of them made memorable movies themselves in later times.
278;Quite a surprise, it was very good.
279;Worth a watch, the music is the only hokey part.
280;Besides being a clever rewrite of Classic literature, the effects are good for its time and even hold up reasonably well into the 21st century.
281;Add The Thing, Day the Earth Stood Still, War of the Worlds, Them, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and you'll understand the 1950's.
282;This is an incredible movie that is more than 50 years old.
283;Some of the dialog is dated and some of the special effects are dated, but the majority of the special effects are actually amazingly good.
284;fi element it is actually a decent movie.
285;I watch this every few years.
286;There is a newer anversary edition that has more extras.
287;If you appreciate the creativity of when they built stages and painted backgrounds this movie is amazing!
288;The color ismagnificent
289;story is interesting and thought provoking in its presentation.
290;It is fun watching the cast members in this movie who would go on to become famous intheir own individual acting careers.
291;Especially the stop and go ones Will be ordering more old timeless movies real soon.
292;Astonishing special affects for the time plus the story was very interesting.
293;I remember the movie and special effects for the last 50 years and still love it!
294;One of the best looking flying saucer in movies.
295;to be a kid in the 1950's and to see this gem in the theatreon the big screen must have been the ultimate thrill.
296;Forbidden Planet is an incredible movie and no Sci.
297;The transfer on the 50th Anniversary and Ultimate Collector's Editions is incredible.
298;I've never seen the film look so bright, crisp and vibrant.
299;The included documentaries and bonus footage are very entertaining and not to be missed.
300;Definitely not worth the extra money I had to pay.
301;It's already established fact that Forbidden Planet is one of the best movies of its kind, introducing the concept of hyper drive, and measuring space travel time in parsecs.
302;I found the bonus movie, The Invisible Boy to be most entertaining,especially the end, and the discussion of Science Fiction films featuring George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, and Ridley Scott, narrated by Mark Hamill, to be quite good as well.
303;cornered opening as a characteristic arch of the Krell.
304;liner, the de Havilland Comet had sharp cornered windows which caused the fuselage to crack and go to pieces in mid.
305;actually I like this picture a lot and these quibbles are mainly in fun.
306;ray version of this classic did finally show up and I bought it and I'm very pleased with the upgrade.
307;Originally conceived as a B. movie the film has taken on a personality and a cult status that brands it as one of the most unique American films made.
308;The film has been the inspiration for Star Wars and Star Trek and just about every modern space opera references it.
309;the story is not a simple one and a great deal of Cyril Hume's screenplay is exposition that manages to take somewhat complex themes and make them accessible to a Saturday afternoon audience.
310;the story is a reworking of Shakespeare's The Tempest and the story hold up quite well after 52 years.
311;The special effects were amazing for the time period and the matte paintings used for the backgrounds still look fantastic.
312;The film was nominated for the 1957 Oscar for best special effects.
313;The picture, while not perfect, is quite good.
314;The trailer features a floating yellow scroll that was duplicated to great effect in the Star Wars movies.
315;get yourself some popcorn pop this one in and enjoy the golden age of sci.
316;And of course Robby the robot was a sensational hit.
317;I first saw this when I was 7 years old and I'm thrilled to say that my grandchildren ages 12 and 5 absolutely loved it.
318;It is as fantastic today as it was 56 years ago.
319;Don't get me wrong, the picture does not suck, it is good, just expected better for a 50th anniversary edition.
320;As far as the movie goes, and anyone who has ever seen it knows, it is just a really great science fiction movie for its time.
321;A Rotten Tomato favorite I'm certain.
322;Good for a laugh or education of the young.
323;After the Movie Metropolis this one brought Sifi in to the main stream of Hollywood movies.
324;A widescreen movie in full color and a few cheesy special effects.
325;Robbie is the Robot second best movie robot.
326;The woman robot from Metropolis is the Best one ever, but Robbie is more famous.
327;Love monsters from the Id.
328;fi genre collector's cult classic.
329;but it *does* have interesting moral and philosophical implications, as well as tons of fantastic special effects, especially given that this Sci.
330;It's a timeless fave, for the stated reasons.
331;I wish I had got the chance to see this movie in a theatre.
332;The special effects are fantastic, and remember this movie was made in the 1950s.
333;I am sure George Lucas got some inspiration from this movie.
334;`Forbidden Planet' has a great story, wonderful scenery, great special effects, and a good cast.
335;Leslie Nielsen makes a good feature film debut (it's interesting to see his early, more serious roles).
336;The history of the planet, with the ancient civilization, is very fascinating and the music is haunting.
337;It is a real masterpiece, a must.
338;A wonderful story and seeing the cast again and where they went in their careers is quite a hoot.
339;Loved it then and love it now.
340;Wonderful movie from the 1950s.
341;The special effects are really good for the time and the electronic music is really atmospheric.
342;A must see for all sci fi fans
343;Great golden oldie, special effects for that time were over the top.
344;Wife and I enjoyed it very much.
345;An all time classic film.
346;I can recommend this to any classic Sci.
347;This is still a favorite, that anyone can appreciate.
348;This a classic film, it is a must have for anyone that enjoys great SciFi action.
349;The space cruiser and Robby the Robot were great innovations for that time frame.
350;Perhaps one of the greatest science fiction films of the 1950s, after The Day the Earth Stood Still and The Thing from Another World.
351;The special effects, color, the sets and even the matte paintings are magnificent.
352;The iconic Robbie the Robot is great and at times a hoot.
353;The story is great, though a bit cerebral for lovers of B films.
354;What fantastic voices of Walter Pidgeon, Leslie Neilsen, and Robby the Robot!Terrific acting by fit, goodlooking actors!
355;a blonde beauty with a mole on her face!
356;Look out, Cindy Crawford!It's been over 30 years since I barely caught the tail end of this movie on a black and white tv set in Philadelphia, and it's still the best movie I've ever seen!
357;And it's one of only 3 movies I love to watch again and again!Here are the basics: the producers and creative team took Shakespeare's The Tempest, moved the story to the year 2200 A. d., created a soundtrack called electronic tonalities, cast Walter Pidgeon.
358;a veteran of over 100 movies.
359;Forbidden Planet is a beautiful movie, a textbook on how a movie should be made: have actors who look the part and who have good voices, write a great script, and use terrific music, props, and special effects.
360;But the best way to describe Forbidden Planet is to quote Leslie Nielsen's final line in the movie, It will remind us.
361;I love watching this and remembering my childhood days.
362;but I still love this movie.
363;The first serious SciFi Movie, and it was done very well.
364;At this time 20 out of 23 people found it helpful.10 Stars!
365;budget, risky venture at making the one of the finest Color Sci.
366;Unlike many of the low budget movies of the genre, FP remains to this day a very entertaining and captivating film.
367;even a well lit alley).
368;the sets were beautiful, the saucer flys perfectly (notice the shadows and the dust when it lands).
369;So much here that you simply must watch very closely to the detail, it really is worth it.
370;Speaking of detail, the Monster was pretty easy.
371;fi movie has been one of my favorites for decades, and I was pretty eager to see this again without TV interruptions.
372;This had a good story line to it.
373;This is a very crisp and clear restoration!
374;the first one to have starships, to talk about faster than light travel, and one of those movies that everyone reacted to for 50 (yes 50!)
375;But it stands up reasonably well, with a literate script stolen, er, drawn from Shakespeare's Tempest.
376;I love this show .
377;I was so happy to find it on amazon.
378;picture and sound is great
379;First, let me mention this is an excellent transfer and I did find the package a welcome addition to my video collection.
380;The included documentaries skim the surface of the making of the films.
381;The movie itself is very good.
382;It has a solid plot, and good acting.
383;I have always loved the old sci.
384;He likes the older science fiction movies and I am sure he will pick out another.
385;Always entertaining, great actors and a classic premise.
386;A scifi restaging of The Tempest with an evil genius, handsome hero, a damsel in distress, all with Robbie the Robot and a surprise monster.
387;good movies don't get old.
388;Very well crafted, the full color tin beckons you to the excitement within.
389;As a collector, you'll be pleased with the Robby die.
390;The artistic lobby card miniatures are another welcome bonus .
391;in order form for an original.
392;size theatre poster for a few bucks can't be beat .
393;With respect to content .
394;related works that are a welcome edition to the package.
395;The audio is stunning .
396;you'll enjoy the Barron's electronic tonalities score as never before with a fully re.
397;I personally think the extras are worth the price difference over the lower.
398;I'm really happy that MGM put FP on blu.
399;ray transfer is very good and you can't beat the price.
400;This movie is a true classic.
401;Great story
402;I love the acting and the characters.
403;Picture sound and video are excellent.
404;ray with a DTS soundtrack.
405;Forbidden planet is one of the best sci fi movies to hit the screen.
406;At the time the enhanced animation and graphics were cutting edge and still is a favorite because of these attributes.
407;A MUST SEE for any science fiction fan!
408;It is too bad that MGM felt that it needed spacy noises , but if your mind can block it out, there is a terrific presentation of fairly solid science and probability, if one believes in evolution, or even if not.
409;easily on of the best sci.
410;fi movies and a personal favorite
411;i finally saw this again on TV in my teens, and I loved it.
412;It is such an unusual piece of work that much if it gets right past the filters we install to protect us from whatever frightens us in the movies and goes straight for the id, if you know what I mean.
413;walter Pidgeon is a wonder.
414;there is something so wonderfully eerie about the entire production design.
415;This, most of all in the film, is what gets under your skin, disarms you, and leaves you open to the powerful images and themes that the film conveys.
416;this is a must see for anyone who is any kind of sci.
417;I watch it all the time and don't you love the soundtrack?
418;It's still one of the best monster concepts ever.
419;It all works so very well and is expressed as a complete thought.
420;Of course you need a decent LD player but I've got one.
421;in this humble reviewer's opinion, Forbidden Planet ranks with the great of this era which included, The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Incredible Shrinking Man, Them, The Thing, and War of the Worlds.
422;The 5.1 surround sound is terrific and the extras (including the film, The Invisible Boy) that are part of this 50th Anniversary Special Edition make for a great value.
423;That means the movie is clipped on the sides.
424;It's funny, me being a fan of science fiction and movies in general, why it is that it took me so long to get around to watching Forbidden Planet (1956).
425;This amazing discovery is certainly worth writing home about, and so Commander Adams begins having the men disassemble the ship to create a device powerful enough to send a message back to his superiors, and in the meantime, starts making time with Morbius' daughter, who's never seen a man outside of her father, and is uneducated in the ways of woo.
426;What the heck were these Krell up to anyway?Forbidden Planet is inspirational, in my opinion, because it presents an well developed and thought out story above and beyond the usual `scary alien' fare we saw in the early 50's.
427;Similar to The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), it brought a level of intelligence to the genre while managing to also entertain.
428;It also hallmarked the first film appearance of Robby the Robot, probably one of the most popular, recognizable, and enduring icons in science fiction film history.
429;The production value overall is lavish and indicates little expense was spared in bringing the story to life.
430;The special effects, even by today's standards, look remarkably good, and the realism in the matte painting backgrounds is truly spectacular.
431;I find it pretty sad that this film doesn't rate the special features we so often see on new releases.
432;Yet, the best of the bunch, for its literacy and production values, was undoubtedly MGM's first big foray into A level science fiction, Forbidden Planet, released in 1956.
433;the tale is simple, but elegantly constructed, and filled with humorous asides that leaven the forced `love story' aspect in the film.
434;a philologist, his gorgeous blond daughter Altaira (Anne Francis).
435;Morbius warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the Bellerophon party in their first year, yet he was immune to it.
436;All in all, it's a technically good film.
437;Only such films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris, Alien and Aliens, and the first two Terminator films, have really equaled or surpassed this classic in depth and effects.
438;it's worth knowing that, despite Forbidden Planet's `happy ending', there is the possibility that the MOTI is still dormant within Alta, as well.
439;The film also makes good use of narrative ellipses to condense the tale, something that far more realistic art films often fail to do.
440;Forbidden Planet is one of those rare films that both defines yet transcends its era.
441;behind machinery and technology of this ancient civilization are revealed, are mesmerizing.
442;I have always liked sci.
443;Receieved the movie in good condition, watched it and enjoyed the movie, but really expecting a little better picture in hi.
444;Leslie Nelson in a serious role!
445;If you love 1950's sci.
446;fi movies like I do, this is one of the better, well done movies of the gender.
447;The sound and picture qualities are very good when compared to other sci.
448;It is a must to add to your collection.
449;Great special effects and the introduction of Robby the robot.
450;This is a classic science fiction movie that contains an excellent plot and the special effects are still reasonably good even with todays capabilities.
451;I recieved this item well ahead of the estimated shipping date and was so happy when it arrived when it did.
452;Of course it may in fact be the best Sci Fi Movie ever made.
453;It helped inspire Gene Roddenberry to create Star Trek (which is obvious after you have seen this and the original Star Trek Pilot The Cage )But most important is just how perfect it is from the score, the design, the concept, the plot, the story, the actors THE ROBOT!Robby alone is worth price of admission.
454;In addition to the expected history lesson/making of which is great fun in of itself it has two extra feature films staring Robby the Robot, which I am excited to see.
455;Forbidden Planet is a truly great sci.
456;fi film which, despite the limitations of special effects technology in its time, remains fresh and convincing to this day.
457;The story is perhaps the greatest in the history of sci.
458;fi cinema, with a very intriguing twist ending.
459;Clearly, this movie is a true forerunner to the Star Trek universe.
460;This is a well made, thoughtful movie with really good special effects.
461;The cast is great to watch.
462;Leslie Nielsen, Jack Kelly and Anne Francis play the material very well.
463;This is one of the best of this genre and of its day.
464;great cast, but I thought the original play was better than the screenplay.
465;I remember watching movies and hearing the music coming through the walls from next door.
466;Anyway this was my favorite movie along with the Blob.
467;He loves outer space stuff too.
468;Sure, it benefits from the Tempest .
469;derived story line, and Walter Pidgeon is hard to top as the reclusive genius in charge of powerful and ultimately destructive technology, but this tale of danger and redemption stands up surprisingly well some six decades later.
470;the special effects showcase some clever animation and matte paintings, and are blended with some thought to the idea of less is more, which helps in the suspension of disbelief in most scenes (aside from the unfortunate pop.
471;But, for sheer entertainment, this film is at the head of the pack for 50's science fiction.
472;Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the journey to Altair iV.
473;fi flicks, I was one of those kids that saw Forbidden Planet in the drive.
474;I was also one of those kids that hid under the seat when the monster 'appeared'.
475;Forbidden Planet has held up amazingly well over the years.
476;MGM gave it a big budget with the best technical staff who got their ideas onto the sets.
477;It remains a very innovative movie, presaging much of what was to come in cinema and the real world.
478;Anyway its a great movie that should be seen by EVERYONE!
479;Forbidden Planet is one of the most influential science fiction movies of all time.
480;Unlike many of its contemporaries, the special effects are at least reasonable even today.
481;While so many science fiction movies relied on stories of alien races and monsters, this movie uses that type of story to complement what is a surprisingly good science fiction story.
482;It is a little odd seeing Leslie Nielsen in a serious role after all the comedies that he has done in the later part of his career, but he does a decent enough job.
483;The story combines action with a more thoughtful story, which undoubtedly has more to do with this movie becoming a classic than anything else.
484;The story also mixes is some humor more so than some of the other films.
485;Earl Holliman as the cook offers some humorous moments in his attempts to get Robbie to produce Bourbon, and then there is my favorite exchange between Altaira and Robbie:Altaira: Robbie, I must have a new dress, right away.
486;Those who know Star Trek, particularly the original series will find themselves on familiar ground in this movie, as it clearly had a huge influence on the show.
487;Don't let the lack of extras deter you though, this is one worth watching.
488;This has to be the absolute best science fiction movie of its era.
489;The effects are good but the story is great.
490;When you eventually see this monster remember that the animation was done by Disney artists.
491;A unique collection of bonus material to go with the sci.
492;fi classic, Forbidden Planet , makes this package a welcome addition to my growing film library of all time favourites.
493;I think there may be an even larger screen ratio to come
494;He dropped by a few weeks later and asked to see the spaceship landing one more time .
495;score is also unique in the sense that it is both the music and the sound effects.
496;All in all, the 50th anniversary edition of Forbidden Planet is a winner!
497;The story line was imaginative and compelling.
498;The execution of the screenplay was excellent.
499;All actors and the actress were enticing in their respective roles.
500;But heck, that's just the storyline.
501;There's much more: a whiskey synthesizing robot
502;and shot in Technicolor, it's just gorgeous besides.
503;The film has very high production values and the art direction and the special effects alone could (almost) carry it.
504;But the story is a conceptual masterpiece as well.
505;I hope they do a good job on it, and bring it back with 21st century graphics!
506;This movie holds up very well for it's age.
507;The story is one of the best of any sci fi movie ever made.
508;another interesting point is that this film clearly inspired Star Trek .
509;This is one of those movies that I love to watch over and over again.
510;There's just something about the movie that draws me to it.
511;is particularly funny when trying to look his most serious.
512;The story is excellent, although it was regarded as being too cerebral at the time of its release (with it's talk of the Id ).
513;Mindful of their viewing audience at the drive.
514;ins of the day, moviemakers eventually placed emphasis on Robbie the Robot.
515;Using their technology, he is able to harness the power of the mind and create anything from the nothing with a mere thought.
516;edge at the time and hold up surprisingly well.
517;Truly a remarkable movie given the technology limitations of the '50's.
518;The acting is absolutely first.
519;The story keeps the attention at a perfect pace while the story line develops to a reasonable ending.
520;On time and generally super service.
521;This is one of the early scfi movies and brought forward Robby the Robot wgich was used in later years in TV and movies.
522;Forbidden Planet will always be the best and most influential science fiction film of its era, the 1950s.
523;Comments from famous directors and special effects wizards express their debt to the film, admiration of this achievement, over half a century after it appeared.
524;ray is like discovering a whole new planet.
525;ray, but hard to be absolutely certain.
526;They are easy to implement, especially when any brand new Blu.
527;Forbidden Planet belongs in your science fiction film library along with other classics like The Thing From Another World, 2001, Solaris, and Blade Runner.
528;Then go out to a great coffee shop with your best film aficionados and talk about it for hours.
529;ray format is very good
530;The dialogue can be a bit silly sounding, and it is always amusing to watch the 50's idea of hi.
531;Leslie Nielsen was a very earnest Captain (again, a funny counterpoint to his later movies as hapless Frank Farmer in the Police series).
532;And it is always great to see a young Anne Francis in those wonderful short dresses!
533;Overall, a true classic of the time and genre and a movie that will be fun to watch forever!
534;This is definitely one of the science fiction classics.
535;This is a good reminder of what science fiction used to be like: down to earth and captivating.
536;The story is what really shines forth in this, along with the 50s style acting.
537;The menu is simple and easy to use, although certainly not glitzy.
538;all in all, it's worth it to science fiction fans.
539;I've always loved this film.
540;, Walter Pigeon, that cool space cruiser, the weird and imaginative musical score (experimental electronic music).
541;There's so much to like here, including a rather thoughtful storyline based on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST.
542;the BD transfer is first rate, and includes many extras including The Invisible Boy, a B. grade potboiler featuring Robby in another supporting role.
543;The sound on this transfer is great too .
544;the thrumming notes of the score, and the sound effects, are full.
545;great price on this disc too, considering all the extras you get on it.
546;I have always loved this classic Sci.
547;mastered transer has brighter scenes, better color, MUCH better sound, and a really cool Robby included.
548;If you liked Forbidden Planet, you should see this version.
549;But it was great seeing Leslie Nielsen playing a serious role.
550;This was cutting edge SCI FI in its time and surprising holds up rather well even today.
551;It is great to see this classic in such clean crisp form!
552;This is my absolutely favorite Sci.
553;Each of these actors we will see in movies and television in later years and parts of this set will appear in future sci.
554;For the time, this is a very beautiful and imaginative movie, tho I do find the idea of Earl Holliman as a space.
555;You will enjoy this film as it brings back fun memories of our history of good films.
556;the enhancement is terrific and will appeal to any one of you scy.
557;i highly recommend you add this to your library.
558;Skin tones and details are particularly revealing and fresh looking and do contribute to the drama.
559;The standouts are the sets and the special effects.
560;The outside night views of the ship against the sky and stars are stunning and I am still amazed at the beauty of the ship's entry into the atmosphere at the beginning.
561;The interior sets also look amazing
562;i am still impressed with how well this movie holds up after all these years.
563;Nice update of this classic old science fiction staple.
564;Good price on an ourstanding movie from the early sci.
565;Have not actually looked at it, but I know it's goung to be good.
566;This is a great sci fi movie.
567;Leslie Nielsen is great in this.
568;The special effects in FORBIDDEN PLANET were excellent in 1956, are still excellent in 2006, and will remain excellent for as long as the film is shown.
569;Rembrandt's Road to Emmaus was great in the seventeenth century and do you know what?
570;'Forbidden Planet' is an enjoyable science fiction film, even though the graphic and acting may seem dated.
571;As the film progresses, one will realize it is actually a study of human psychology.
572;See if you can spot Leslie Neilson.
573;Just as I remembered it as a kid, and with today's sound systems, well, turn down the lights, and you're back in the huge theaters of the 50's and 60's!
574;I must hand it to the production companies that do the work on the restoration of these classic gems.
575;disc Special Edition)Great movie, great transfer.
576;Still better than most science fiction movies out these days.
577;The colors are so vivid.
578;A fabulous movie, with Robby the Robot.

580;I was born in 1965.
581;I highly recommend this collection, which by the way is housed in a really cool colorful tin, with cover.
582;and us still as good as when it was first released!
583;Nearly fifty years later it is truly amazing how fresh this movie still looks and feels.
584;I have always believed the primary component of any lasting film is a great story.
585;The script is both highly intelligent and highly entertaining, with much more humor and believable horror than one would expect from a 1956 film.
586;The direction is polished and inventive, with arcing tracking shots and clever editing techniques strewn throughout the picture.
587;The acting here is very good, with a defining performance from Walter Pidgeon as Doctor Morbius, and a surprising dramatic turn from later.

589;The supporting cast all shine, each one containing more depth of character than is normally given to secondary roles.
590;A Master Race of beings create a machine 20.
591;Regardless, this is still one of the best Sci.
592;I first saw this film when it premiered in 1956 and it's as good today as it was back then.
593;He laughed when I told him I had only paid 20 cents to get in.
594;Anyway, this newly enhanced version is well worth the money.
595;I doubt there are many who have never seen it, but if you are one of them then you are in for a treat.
596;Having a member of Disney's special effects department work on the 'invisible' creature makes it even more impressive.
597;She continued to act (and be political) for her lifetime.
598;A retelling of  The Tempest, but done in a way that can be enjoyed on many levels.
599;this film, with its state of the art affects, adventure, robot and just plain fun, was the Star Wars of its day.
600;One that can be enjoyed over and over.

626;The detail of the sets and the expressions on the actors' faces are much easier to discern.

643;I have always enjoyed Forbidden Planet.
644;It seems a precursor for Star Trek and many other fantastic space oriented adventure series.
645;Great FX and an all star cast.

647;I saw this movies when it first came to theatres, I was about 9 years old and thought it was amazing!

649;The reason they were so great goes beyond the adventure and state.
650;Both these films had (as did the original Star Trek TV series) unusually strong characterization.
651;But the best thing about them, and here Forbidden Planet comes out No.1 of all time in sci.
652;Today we crave action, often mindless, with special effects far beyond what the 50s could generate, and that's fun.
653;But how many in today's audience could even understand the science of Forbidden Planet, let alone find mental satisfaction in it that surpasses the thrills of Star Wars by light years.

665;painting backgrounds, the story of inner monsters, a haunting electronic music score, and a humor.
666;This movie was (and still is) a remarkable piece of film making, along with The Thing (From Another Planet) and The Day The Earth Stood Still .
667;Science Fiction movies of the '50s were more often concerned with monsters and communist political subtexts than in more thoughtfully developed stories about the primordial instincts of all life.
668;This is a movie that wears well after many viewings, and even with our jaded Star Wars view of space movies, it remains a magnificent edifice to the film maker's art.
669;This will always be one of the all time classics.
670;For me it rates right up there with The Day The Earth Stood Still, and the original War of the Worlds.
671;It is a supurb story and just the right amount of special effects to enhance the story and not detract from it.
672;Naturally Robby the Robot, who was also a star on TV's Lost In Space, adds to entertainment factor.
673;A great movie for young and us oldsters alike.
674;this will be a classic 100 years from nowI love it more and more every time I watch itit has such a great space age vibe to itvery powerfulsee this movietruly a classiceven if it is 30 or 40 years old it shall stay a classic
675;A bit green and it shows.
676;Walter Pidgeon, an otherwise fine and gifted actor, was far past his prime by the time he did 'Forbidden Planet'.
677;guzzling Earl Holliman was inserted as comic relief.
678;the politically correct crowd will find a lot to gripe about with this film.
679;Worth watching at least once, if for no other reason because it's a classic.
680;It was a great sci.
681;Not like the ones we see today with all of the computer generated effects but a great film.
682;Starring many actors you will recognize even though they are much younger than we remember them.
683;Really worth seeing and encourage you to see it.
684;great classic scifi ,Leslie Nielson and Anne Frances ,his first film and she is a hotty.
685;great story ,lifted from Shakespeare.
686;if you like camp and high production values this movie is good fun .
687;magic become one of the most loved classics of all.
688;Forbidden Planet (1956) has some of those classic qualities.
689;In fact it gets better with age.
690;fi movies date pretty quick.
691;Attempts at realism backfire as tomorrow becomes today.
692;The special effects of Forbidden Planet were good for their day and certainly don't compare to today's CGI effects.
693;the surreal landscape effects and unique score set the mood for Forbidden Planet .
694;And the story is really something worthy of art house cinema.
695;at times the valiant spaceship skipper refers to Dr Mobius's enormous ego.
696;all of these issues raise the larger concern of human progress.
697;Forbidden Planet manages to keep those human elements to the fore and in a sense presents a morality play with an ageless extraterrestial background.
698;A hundred years from now when someone watches Forbidden Planet on Mars, it will still look as good.
699;I was a big fan of the Lost in Space TV show and other old sci fi flicks so I thought I would give this one a try.
700;I'm 22 years old, my 75 year old dad loves this movie and I see him watching it on TV when it's on so I took a shot and bought it on blu ray.
701;number one, AMAZING movie, especially for the 1950's.
702;The funky sound effects, set design, story, acting, very excellent for such an old movie.
703;Some older movies/shows I have on blu ray do not have widescreen, but this does, and it looks good.
704;Some parts you can tell the recording/mixing equipment wasn't up to where it is today, but it is still very good for the 1950's.
705;Also, this came with The Invisible Boy, a whole second movie in black and white with Robby the Robot.
706;a true Milestone for its time .
707;fi lover knows this one almost by heart.
708;One of the first wide screen and CinemaScope done.
709;LOVE the special effects of this movie, Is great for all times.
710;i saw it as a kid and continue to appreciate the story and the characters.
711;This show had exceptional stars and started a long career for Robbie and some of the new faces.
712;One of the all time classics.
713;ray version is better .
714;The film is exceptional, the acting is not typical of a mid century film, it is phenominal, the plot is intelligent and bordering the profound, altogether a superb film.
715;The aforementioned is said in relevance to a context most science fiction fans would understand, however, this film goes beyond science fiction, and is worthy for any 1950's or 1960's cinema fan.
716;Every few years I have to watch this movie.
717;My favorite character is the robot.
718;This was the first believable movie.
719;no, the effects aren't what you'd expect 45 years later from Dreamworks, but they are carefully crafted using the technologies of the day.
720;The plot leaves us exploring the gap between technical and psychological evolution (something done well in books like Daniel Quinn's ISHMAEL and Eisler's THE CHALICE AND THE BLADE).
721;thoroughly entertaining, the best of its genre for its time, this movie is not one to miss.
722;Well worth viewing, even if science fiction isn't your favorite genre.
723;If I'd seen more character development, I'd have given it a full 5 stars, but the conflicts and mysteries of the movie seem to lead to little growth.
724;(If you'd like to discuss this video or review in greater detail, please click on the about me link above and drop me an email.
725;I liked this movie back in the day [way back when it was released] Special effects have come a long way since then but it was enjoyable to go back in time.
726;Forbidden Planet is the first and best of all sci.
727;ray for the first time made for some slightly disillusioning moments, among many more of delight.
728;Even with the obvious nature of most of the movie's special effects (which, at the time, were groundbreaking), great storytelling still shines through so, regardless of the sketchy animation or occasional cheesy miniatures, I can still enjoy the film for what it is .
729;written, and totally entertaining Sci.
730;Sure, but I'll give this one a hearty recommendation nevertheless.
731;Interesting to see Leslie Nielsen in a serious role.
732;it's easily worth the $10 to watch it on a download and own it forever.
733;if you're a Twilight Zone fan, watch the definitive Blu.
734;Forbidden Planet is arguably the best sci.
735;fi movie to come out of the 1950's and maybe one of the best ever.
736;This is a great classic movie.
737;song that's the theme for Rocky Horror Picture Show states
738;A movie fun for kids and interesting for adults.
739;The visiting space captain is in love with the scientist's daughter, but the father/scientist is also in love with his own daughter, though he is not aware of it.
740;This was my first big screen show that I was able to get into.
741;It has this big robot, and this invisible monster, and what about those legs.
742;FORBIDDEN PLANET is an adaptation of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST that blends classic Freudian themes with innovative sci.
743;The movie has a great cast with Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis and of course Robby the Robot.
744;fi fan I enjoyed the attention to detail that George Lucas seems to have forgotten.
745;I also enjoyed the groundbreaking electronic music used in the score of the film.
746;The effects used in the movie were cutting edge at the time and still hold up fifty years later.
747;And as for this two disc set it has lots of cool special features including a feature length film THE INVISIBLE BOY and a short TV episode both of which star the iconic robot Robby.
748;This classic movie influenced many future sci.
749;fi films and is essential viewing for any fan of the genre.
750;This is perhaps the second good science.
751;Many of the ideas behind this movie ended up on Star Trek.
752;It helped shape our notion about what a space opera movie ought to be.
753;Amazon definitely does what it takes to ensure customer satisfaction.
754;lots of special features on the disk and also lots of goodies in the metal casing.
755;neverheless its a grand Special Edition wich will make you enjoy this movie to the fullest.
756;if you listen to actual nasa data of space noise, you'll see the movie is both ahead of its day and intellectually superior to anything else since then even 2001!
757;I was fascinated by this movie when I first saw it in the early sixties and amazed how well it still holds up today.
758;It inspired many SiFi movies and series including Star Trek.
759;you have to watch this movie with the understanding that it is a classic, and the era it was created in.
760;that baseline said, it's classically cheesey and typically introspective of the times.
761;Bonus points for having a story that actually makes sense and manages to be interesting, despite the movie being hilarious.
762;Still a great classic with a novel theme Monsters from the Id .
763;For its time, it was an outstanding film, and still merits my praise even if the equipment is rather outdated and clunky looking when compared to the new Star Trek movies, etc.
764;We've moved on, but this movie pays wonderful tribute to the science of it's day!
765;This is the ultimate Classic of all space Sci.
766;Get it, and enjoy it!
767;great special effects and a very interesting story line.
768;ray version of what is obviously the inspiration for Star Trek is a real treat for fans as the picture and sound qualities have been vastly improved.
769;The special features are very good as well with great documentaries and even the not.
770;good sequel featuring Robby the Robot The Invisible Boy which comes across more like a kiddy comedy than its much more serious and better prior film.
771;fi film, the birth of techno music for the score, the depiction of man travelling faster than light and exploring other planets and for fans of Star Trek like myself you get the feeling that you are watching the true pilot of Star Trek: TOS.
772;great story of the Tempest a la Sci Fi framework.
773;The robot is always the favorite part.
774;This is the film that established the foundation of modern space opera science fiction in cinema.
775;It is the template upon which Star Trek is based, and the tale of alien contact it tells is similar to that told in 2001 .
776;with a brilliant script based loosely on Shakespeare's The Tempest and layered over with Jungian and Freudian meanings as well as themes relevant to both the cold war and to the age of global warming, this film sports uncommonly strong acting, and possesses production values which are nothing less than beautiful.
777;In fact, it is one of the most visually beautiful films in all of movie science fiction.
778;A true delight for viewers of all ages, this film is essential viewing for sci.
779;fi fans and is strongly recommended for fans and students of superior cinema in general.
780;One of my favorite classic 50's si.
781;fi flicks Robby the Robots 1st movie, great cast, music, and electronic tonalities aka sound effects.
782;lol One of the earliest uses of a theremin in a movie.
783;cool effects no CGI some of the best matte painting to come out of Hollywood d ery cool scene's when Morbius shows Commander Adams and crew around a part of the huge underground Krell power generating complex.
784;The other area of interest was the technical representation of the craft.
785;If you like older science fiction films than this is a film you must see.
786;It has a good story line too it as well.
787;As a fan of old SciFi I really love this collector edition of Fobidden Planet.
788;For a 1956 film the primitive special effects still hold up today if you understand and accept it's an old movie.
789;The plot of the film is timeless too, struggles with the inner self.
790;This film is as entertaining and packed with surprises today as it was then.
791;But one does notice the changes in the roles of women since then.
792;A five star movie for sure.
793;This film has so many classic motifs, is well written, filmed, and acted.
794;The sound effects are amazing and groundbreaking, the visual effects are convincing.
795;i first saw this in my high school English class, as an example of how lighting and music can set the tone in a film.
796;This is a good old time great for those people who love science fiction and came in top class condition and within the specified time frame.
797;I've viewed this film in various formats since the 1960s.
798;ray transfer is by far the best version.
799;They put a lot of effort into making this picture look great.
800;But I definitely got my money's worth on Forbidden Planet.
801;as far as the movie itself goes, it's a clever premise and Walter Pidgeon knew how to act.
802;But the other actors are pretty stinko.
803;And with this excellent transfer the effort behind them really shows.
804;Early science fiction film with the classic requirements for the genre.
805;Themes of love, loyalty, jealousy.
806;FORBIDDEN PLANET is certainly one of the most influential films of the 20th Century, containing an unusual story line, some remarkable concept art designs, a superior musical score, and a special effects robot that set the standard for science.
807;fiction films for some thirty years and still continues to influence film makers today.
808;there are many marvelous things about the film.
809;is truly the single most enjoyable element of the film, with much of the film's best lines and a memorable personality to boot.
810;gives quite a remarkable performance as a beautiful young woman raised without knowledge of mankind.
811;The art designs, whether of the lost alien civilization, the home in which Pideon and Francis live, or Francis' costumes, are stunning.
812;Fans of classic science fiction cannot afford to be without FORBIDDEN PLANET, and most viewers will enjoy seeing it at least once, but for all its influence and visual beauty many may find that one viewing is enough.
813;word of Warning: make absolutely certain that you are purchasing the widescreen version of the film, for the pan.
814;scan seriously undercuts the film's visual appeal.
815;Robbie the robot is one of the best Sci.
816;Considering the time when this movie was made, the ideas and effects are very impressive.
817;A great cast, only hindered by the lack of women.
818;Audiences had never before seen such fantastic sets and mind blowing special effects.
819;nominated soundtrack was straight from the world of your strangest dreams, pure long.
820;hair electronic music played on one of the earliest true synthesizers, full of beeps and whistles and swoops and fear and rage coursing throughout the entire movie non.
821;Its 50th anniversary restoration in 2006 is masterful: all the vibrant colors have been restored, and its original mono soundtrack (stereo hadn't even been invented yet in 1956) has been creatively remastered into 5 channel surround sound.
822;This favorite film for Sci.
823;nicely done all way round.
824;great cast of some very well known actors of the period.
825;the great looking Anne Francis as the Girl who got a lot of attention from the crew of United Space Cruiser.
826;this is a top ten pick for 50's vintage sci.
827;You'll love it folks !
828;the power of ideas reigns supreme in good writing.
829;This film balances both very well.
830;and for a film made in 1956, viewing it today is every bit as powerful as the ideas conveyed in another classic, Metropolis, from 1926.
831;While there maybe elements that 'date' such films, the power of ideas clearly keeps these kinds of films relevant to today.
832;Because the ideas are timeless, the topics are the stuff of the human condition, which never changes, no matter the era in which they are portrayed.
833;and when a film addresses these deeper kinds of things, when done with intelligence and with care for the way it is presented, absent flavour of the moment distractions, such films are destined to become classics that withstand the test of time .
834;because the topics themselves are timeless.
835;Light years ahead of its time in story.
836;True Hard Science Fiction Describes realistic possible futures.
837;It was interesting to see how I felt about the movie compared to when I first saw it as a teenager.
838;Anne Francis is still one of the most beautiful women to ever appear in film.
839;I decided to find the older 1999 version that has both Widescreen and Letterbox format so I can watch either format depending on how big I want to see people's faces or the overall background.
840;fi film, complete with bonus material AND a neat storage box, complete with a model of Robby!
841;mastered and repackaged like this one!
842;fi classic such as plot, acting, cast members, special effects and many other subtleties, Forbidden Planet has renewed my interest in viewing the older sci.
843;fi movies with much enthusiasm.
844;from the opening sound effects of the simple disc shape spacecraft to the roar of the self generated monster from the ID, Forbidden Planet has it all!
845;He does a superb acting job making a very believable crew leader.
846;Walter Pidgeon as the slightly mad scientist along with Ann Francis as the innocent daughter do an outstanding job as supporting cast.
847;The story of the Krells and their incredible inventions is just fantastic piece of science fiction that supports the entire plot superbly.
848;You will love this movie!
849;There are so many ways to enjoy this classic mid.
850;all of which are pretty breathtaking.
851;Naively, as I saw it around its first 1956 release, it's an exciting space opera with dirty little secrets and still very handsome special effects, and one of the eeriest scores ever (it has as much of a sonic fingerprint as Psycho).
852;With a little more knowledge, it's a nice pulp streamlining of The Tempest, and if Anne Francis doesn't get to say, O brave new world that has such people in't.
853;Robbie, of course, makes a splendid Ariel (also nice that he escapes the apocalypse to assist Will Robinson).
854;Caliban never had it so good (or more powerful).
855;love to see a family snapshot.
856;old grandsons loved Forbidden Planet!
857;This early science fiction adventure movie features an amazing robot named Robby.
858;hearted and elicited just a few yucks!
859;I enjoyed this oldie but goodie film.
860;If you are a science fiction fan (of any age), you'll get a kick out of Forbidden Planet!
861;This movie is rated five because it tells a good story and pioneers many things we see in later movies and TV series such as Star Trek.
862;High definition really lends itself to this sort of visually oriented film, and it's just wonderfully done on this disc.
863;The special features, especially the Robbie one are first rate.
864;The special effects are great, especially given when the film was made.
865;I understand that Disney artists hand painted, frame by frame, most of the effects.
866;I won't spoil the surprise if you haven't seen it but rest assured it is 1950's sci.
867;One of the very best SF films ever made.
868;Original, expansive, truly great stuff.
869;name actors, incredible special effects, great music, an engaging story .
870;this is a movie that you will watch over and over again, it's strong from start to finish.
871;fi buff well knows the exalted place Forbidden Planet holds in the history of film.
872;The mystery of the appearance of the Krel is a primary aspect that separates this film from all others in the 1950s.
873;Forbidden Planet is really about the mysterious Krel, who were so advanced technologically they were able to gain control over the very essence of their material bodies.
874;fi buff you'll enjoy this early film (1956).
875;The special effects were quite good for the time.
876;One of my favorite movies of all time.
877;This is a great classic movie which Si.
878;Give it a try You won't be sorry you did.
879;I did, so it was worth the price.
880;The Robby figurine is just fine and the right size to sit on one's desk at work.
881;Another SciFi classic on Amazon prime.
882;While some may find it a bit clunky and campy , if you are a real Scifi fan and keep it mind that it was made in 1956 I am sure you will see its merit.
883;military crew members and sense of a ships routine (or SOP) seem right to me.
884;The detail of the props and backgrounds is amazing.
885;If you love the 1950's SF scene with it's beginnings of special effects, this movie is tremendously good.
886;Technology was logical, enemy was logical, scenes developed nicely.
887;I must say that I was very impressed!
888;The story was very interesting, and the plot really held my attention.
889;The characters were very well done, and the acting was superb.
890;But this movie is fantastic!The thing that surprised me the most was the special effects.
891;The sets and vehicles and backgrounds all looked so well done.
892;One of the good things about the special effects is that the movie didn't focus on the effects.
893;but the main reason that I will be watching this movie again and again is because of the story.
894;This is the kind of film that really makes you think.
895;It really held my attention.
896;The colors are stong and bold, without ever being overbright or intrusive.
897;And the letterbox presentation does a fine job of showing the film in the format that it was intended to be seen.
898;I watched this movie on TV as a kid and was dazzled by the special effects, the characters and the story.
899;The Blueray edition is spectacular.
900;and the blu ray version is amazingly clear and sharp.
901;Loved the bonus package, too.
902;This is a great old movie that is treasured.
903;This is watched over and over and will be viewed for many years to come.
904;but the story line is so interesting, Walter Pidgeon lends authentic gravitas, Anne Francis is such the innocent kitten, and Leslie Nielsen, even in a serious role, makes you smile .
905;and so, it all hangs together wonderfully with a theme that certainly feels like it could be Shakespeare, whether or not The Tempest actually inspired the script.
906;Product was in excellent condition when it arrived.
907;Setting the Stage for Future Science Fiction Movies such as Star Trek and Star Wars.
908;Now at 74 I'm still thrilled.
909;Although it is dated, with the special effects and scenery, it still makes a good story as to what the future may hold.
910;It has always been one of my favorite movies.
911;also Butterflies are free to Taxi Driver so I know great movies when I see them.
912;Childhood memory favorite, it was wonderful to enjoy this again and it brought me back to my childhood with happy thoughts!
913;This very modern looking and well.
914;made film stikes an emotional cord in many viewers and on multiple levels.
915;fi thriller from 1956 all the more convincing, there is an excellent cast and award winning special.
916;We have love, rage and fear all playing at the same time and it is something to experience .
917;as the story unfolds, with the help of excellent special effects, especially for 1956, we learn about the disposition of the rest of Morbius's lost crew and find that he has a daughter too.
918;Yes, this can be a scary film.
919;I thought so 50 years ago and still do today after hundreds of viewings.
920;sTARS IN 1956 and 2006This is from beginning to end and very compelling film that has aged very well and is still chilling to watch.
921;It is an excellent story, has a well played cast, modern effects and great pacing that leads to a dramatic conclusion.
922;But in addition we have a good script AND good actors
923;The movie also gives some background into human mind.
924;According to this model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends
925;At the time it came out, I was only 10, it was fantastic!
926;Still Robby is better than R2D2 or C3PO
927;A truly intelligent plot divulged here along with a moral line that's woven so skillfully inside.
928;the humorous portion of the film is also well underplayed with witty dialogue subtly woven into the action.
929;Leslie Nielsen gives us a small glimpse into his comedic side as the strong and handsome commander.
930;Walter Pidgeon is perfect in his role as the language expert who analyzes the powerful alien technology.
931;anne Francis is truly beautiful in this production, and plays her part with engaging enthusiasm.
932;She veils her hidden love for the commander Nielsen by mocking his I'll put more guards on the guards!
933;It's great!Robby the Robot is great .
934;with a perfect voice and a demeanor that never gets tiring .
935;What's still nice about this film is that the technology, while a major part of the story, really takes a backseat to the characters as you watch them try to deal with the invisible, but deadly 30.
936;there's the ship's cook who's rewarded with 60 gallons of his favorite hooch .
937;great costumes for all the actors .
938;and enough sound effects to make you feel like you're watching a Saturday afternoon matinee at your local theatre .
939;this is science fiction at its absolute best .
940;but it was a series with many, many wonderful stories .
941;my advice is to be an avid collector of both!
942;a stellar cast, high productions values, a fabulous script, a large budget, filmed in color, and cutting edge graphics for the day!
943;These sets are very impressive even by todays standards.
944;this movie is a must.
945;But in case you make to take the risk you are still on time to enjoy (although certain outdated special effects) an interesting proposal to watch and discuss.
946;This one gets my high eyebrow.
947;this movie is one of the all time greatest, beyond i expecktations, i would recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of movie, it,skiller good.
948;This movie collection will do just right.
949;Enjoy this piece if you get one.
950;The trailer was fun too!
951;This is a classic that I have been waiting and looking for a long time at the right price.
952;Got it for a good price.
953;Great movie for the time that it was made, in the 50's.
954;Great special effects for the time and plausible plot.
955;Some people consider this a classic of 1950s science fiction.
956;It is entertaining, and that is mostly what I care about when I watch a movie.
957;The captain takes a romantic interest in the daughter.
958;Richard Anderson and Earl Holliman are two more familiar faces.
959;fiction perfect to the central idea of this one, which is so subtly and so expertly pulled off.
960;a monster you can't see, and that you definitely can't stop.
961;WHY YOU SHOULD VIEW THIS:This is a very suspenseful and entertaining film.
962;It will appeal to both adults and children and with a G rating, makes for a great family video night.
963;Adults will enjoy the mature themes and will be compelled by the well.
964;Children will instantly fall for Robby the Robot and enjoy the special effects.
965;This is a great film to use to introduce children to the world of adult speculative fiction.
966;wHY YOU SHOULD PASS:Although a landmark film, this was still made in the 50's and as such, many of the characters are under.
967;For it's time it was a great movie.
968;Sound effects were the only cheesy thing but still the movie was great.
969;This is perhaps the best SF movie made in the 1950s.
970;With a thoughtful plot (inspired by Shakespeare's The Tempest ), believable characters, and special effects that still impress, this movie is a must.
971;It's interesting to see the many ways in which it clearly influenced most later SF films.
972;the first really good sci.
973;It blew away everything before it and sparked the imaginations of an entire generation.
974;Still, it was well written, well acted, and well directed with killer effects done by folks they borrowed from Disney.
975;Robbie was first put in a museum, then moved to storage, then finally sold at auction.
976;It is unquestionably a true classic.
977;Monsters from the ID with great special effects, this is science fiction at it's best
978;It got me hooked on science fiction books and movies.
979;This is one of the best sci.
980;This set is loaded with bonus features on both discs.
981;The Invisible Boy
982;The picture looks very good to begin with.
983;This and Robinson Caruso on Mars are my cult favorites.
984;This movie inspired Star Trek.
985;Want a great SF film?
986;forbidden Planet remains the best SciFi film ever made, and one of the greatest of all films.
987;This is definite a film worth seeing whether you are a sci.
988;It is one of the serious sci.
989;It is easy to be jaded when watching older sci.
990;Although I don't think it is as good (or holds up as well) as The Day the Earth Stood Still, this film is still very watchable today.
991;what I find funny is some of the reviewer of this film.
992;i probably should have knocked a half star off for the mediocre transfer, but still worth watching.
993;Transfer to Blu Ray is great.
994;I really enjoy the added features that are on the disc.
995;i especially liked the concept ideas for Robby the Robot and, how much of a movie icon he has become, since this movie came out.
996;ray version just makes the picture even better, the Blu.
997;It was really ahead of it's time when it was first released and makes you appreciate how they did special effects back then with out the use of computers in today's movie's.
998;The blu ray made a classic film even better.
999;Great movie for it's time with breakthru special effects.
1000;Interesting to see Leslie Neilson in a serious role.
1001;We hope to install and enjoy it as soon as we can!
1002;The story line was well thought out and believe able .
1003;As a matter of fact the story line was excellent.
1004;And the woman in this movie was beautiful and caring.
1005;I would tell a friend to watch it and I could watch it again.
1006;Walter Pidgeon's performance of Dr. Morbius is masterful and the plot is deep and complex.
1007;This movie also introduces Bob Kinoshita's .
1008;Robbie is nothing like the other robots of the 40's and 50's, and is arguably the best movie robot ever created.
1009;Invisible Boy and all the other material on the second disc of the two.
1010;I've always loved old time movies.
1011;Shakespeare's Tempest is the model for this exceptional science fiction film.
1012;I am now sixty seven years old enjoyed reliving that past.
1013;Tremendous special effects, and a great plot, combine to form a movie that is very watchable even today.
1014;fashioned, but the style is amazing.
1015;Absolute classic science fiction classic.
1016;Leslie Nielsen, Walter Pigeon, Robbie, and Ann Francis make for a truly believable and engaging story.
1017;First movie I remember that peaked my interest in SciFi when I very young.
1018;Also was shocked to find that a artist from Walt Disney studios help with the project.
1019;The science fiction was excellent for the time frame and the movie's premise still holds today .
1020;This is a thinking person's film while also being entertaining and visually stunning.
1021;The special effects still hold their own today as does the electronic music .
1022;I actually own the video as well.
1023;This is a true classic of the earlier scientific fiction films.
1024;It rates with The Day the Earth Stood Still.
1025;This is a classic sci fi movie.
1026;It the movie that introduces the icon of all science fiction, Robby the Robot.
1027;The psychological depth and action/adventure work great.
1028;Seeing Leslie Neilsen in an early leading man role is great fun too.
1029;One of my all time favorite syfy classics.
1030;Loved Robbie the robot when I was a kid.
1031;If you are a Robby fan, you should own The Invisible Boy, included here.
1032;star movie in a 4.
1033;Leslie Nielsen gives a star performace as does Walter Pidgeon.
1034;The story is grippingly suspenseful as well as giving a thoughtful look at human nature, with some fantastic comic moments and great special effects for the time.
1035;With the strange twist at the end it makes for compelling viewing.
1036;Have watched this movie many times and enjoy very much.
1037;It has a moral story(an idea that still is true even today), a little love interaction, interesting props and just a very well produced syfy movie for it's time.
1038;ins of the day but a well thought out intelligent story with a poignent theme.
1039;This movie is one of the all time classics and it never disappoints when watched.
1040;Introduces Robby the Robot (who went on to infamy in the TV show Lost in Space), and has some incredible special effects for its time.
1041;What a great movie with good actors.
1042;The robot is a good actor too!!
1043;This is a great addition on any collection.
1044;The packaging is very well done.
1045;A lot of information about the movie and how it started it all for true outer space science fiction.
1046;fi film with great special effects for the mid 50's that hold up very well today.
1047;I love the slow pan as the saucer approaches above the (quite realistic) glowing atmosphere of the planet.
1048;Forbidden Planet was always a science fiction favorite of mine due to it's outlandish setting, great acting, great sets, great characters, excellent science fiction and human element.
1049;It's pretty much everything good science fiction should be but too seldom actually achieves: intellectually stimulating, frightening, sexy, bold in story and look, fantastic, etc.
1050;Kudos to the makers and restorers of this classic.
1051;for those who haven't seen Forbidden Planet, it's been likened to Shakespeare's Tempest set in space, but it has interesting plot twists of its own.
1052;i highly recommend this science fiction classic, especially for the wonderful remastering.
1053;I bought this film because it has always been one of my favorite classic Sci.
1054;It has everything from monsters to sexy women.
1055;The film's use of Disney Studios for special effects was inspired.
1056;one of my top 15 movies.
1057;fi movie period is the 1950's and this movie is at the top my list.
1058;I have seen it 20.25 times over my life and still it rocks.
1059;Forbidden Planet is easily one of the finest science fiction movies ever made.
1060;Although released in 1956, it still compares favorably with much flashier movies from more recent years.
1061;fest in the Star Wars style, but blends modest action and beautiful hand painted special effects with a fascinating study of basic human nature.
1062;Also, one of the more memorable big.
1063;The movie also contains some of the best sci.
1064;To complement the attractive visuals and sounds is excellent casting, with Walter Pidgeon perfectly suited to the imperious Dr. Morbius.
1065;Fine performances by Leslie Nielsen and Anne Francis, among others, help create a dramatic tension you can feel as the film nears its climax.
1066;Monsters, mystery and a little humor make Forbidden Planet a genuine classic, which any sci.
1067;fi fan should take time to enjoy!
1068;It is one of the few movies that I would watch more than once.
1069;This is one of the great old sci.
1070;Whenever that happens all the effects they have used to enhance the original film disappear and you are left viewing the original source film, which I found jarring and decreased the enjoyment of the viewing experience.
1071;The movie was well done and has very good production values.
1072;There is one technical glitch with regard to continuit.
1073;For its time, well way ahead of it's time.
1074;Robots, energy weapons,aliens,all rolled into one, and the graphics aren't bad at all!I'm sure some of the scifi writers used this as an starting platform.
1075;i thoroughly enjoyed the movie!A must for any serious scifi buff!
1076;If you saw it when originally released, live it again.
1077;For those who have never seen it, stand by for a treat.
1078;The backup material in thiscollection is worth the price.
1079;core science fiction fan, Forbidden Planet (1956) is a must see movie!
1080;Great Science fiction move for any time.
1081;Robby the Robot is the centerpiece of attention and is timeless.
1082;Forbidden Planet has always been my favorite science fiction movie sicne I first saw it as a child at the theaters and on television.
1083;Morbius committed the ultimate sin
1084;Funny how the men from Earth spaceship C.57.
1085;He has gone beyond Earth's power and he wants to keep it that way.
1086;He is detailed, at his own request, to watch over Morbius and Alta, while the captain makes the ship ready to rocket back to Earth with Morbius and Alta in tow .
1087;At least Hollywood left that part alone and got most of it right.
1088;He has probably the most basic knowledge about how life is put together and thus he fills in the blanks in his knowledge with the bloody stuffing.
1089;the book is a good one and I recommend it for fans of the movie and for fans of science fiction.
1090;while I enjoy the movie still, I find myself looking for clues in what Hollywood decided should be on the screen for what was central to the book.
1091;Doc was much smarter than that.
1092;Morbius is alive and still on his feet at the end of the book.
1093;Picture never looked so good!
1094;See why Star Trek and Star Wars tip their collective hats to this stellar film.
1095;The movie that was the inspiration for Star Trek and Lost in Space.
1096;It is all here, in this 1956 masterpiece.
1097;A commander with a soft spot for beautiful girls, his friends, the doctor and the science officer, The saucer shaped starship, the weapons that vaporize their targets (here called blasters, not phasers) and the friendly talking robot.
1098;Its is a wonderful movie and have not lost its magic in all these years
1099;Great movie for the entire family!
1100;This all time classic if a must see for all, including age 8 and up.
1101;The kids will love it.
1102;This product was one of the BEST deals I have found to the most amazing package of this collectible Classic movie.
1103;It is truly a great collectible and a valued treasure for years to come.
1104;Amazing what a 'big budget' film and talented crew could accomplish in the 1950's.
1105;FP has Star Trek phasers and scenes resembling the interior of the Star Wars 'Death Star' . . . amazing.
1106;To occupy his time, he studies the vanished civilization that one lived on the planet and builds miraculous devices such as the robot.
1107;The story is fun, though, and Anne sure was pretty!
1108;Remember when our intelligence, our human values, and our belief in science held the ultimate promise for us: one day we will explore the universe?
1109;This one of my favorite films since seeing it as a kid originally on TV in and pan&scan.
1110;i highly recommend this upgrade at such a good price.
1111;The many extras alone make this edition worth owning.
1112;One of the golden years classics.
1113;I watched this movie the first time as a kid and still watch it from time to time.
1114;Forbidden Planet is first in rank in a great tradition of sci fi classics.
1115;all of these films deal with variations on the Copernican theme of seeing the earth as a speck of dust in the cosmos.
1116;But they do so in a way full of human drama
1117;This is the story of an alien race whose state of ultimate technology outlives the race itself, and of a handful of deep space explorers from earth who gradually come to realize, both by carefully studying the alien artifacts, and from their own interpersonal exchanges, that this is destiny of humanity as well.
1118;The plot is far more subtle, and far more powerful.
1119;the unique special effects and musical score make this film a special treat.
1120;They captivate the imagination in a way that really does justice to its plot.
1121;Also memorable are the visual shots of seemingly ant.
1122;a must see for sci fi fans
1123;In production values, way better.
1124;A science fiction version of Shakespeare's The Tempest, this film is one of the all.
1125;time classics, with a literate, intelligent script and special effects that were state.
1126;art at the time and still hold up astonishingly well.
1127;This film shows how smart science fiction can be.
1128;Than you for adding the streaming option for this great film, it makes it nice when you are on the road and you want to watch one of your favorite films.
1129;I recommend this sight and product.
1130;This is still the best 50's sci.
1131;ray version such as the 1957 feature b/w movie The Invisible Boy and the very well put.
1132;together the making of Forbidden Planet as well as Watch The Skies and other features.
1133;Well worth it to have in your collection of sci.
1134;Extraordinary movie that stands the test of time more than 60 years later.
1135;I am pround and happy to own the Blu.
1136;com's reviewer's excellent review of Forbidden Planet covers all the bases about this superlative science fiction film
1137;Surely Forbidden Planet inspired the great space operas which followed in the 1960's and beyond, from Star Trek to 2001: A Space Odyssey , and indeed, Star Wars .
1138;Walter Pidgeon is spectacular as Dr. Mobius, the film's version of Prospero
1139;The soundtrack with its theremin score is widely regarded as a classic of science fiction music.
1140;Without question, this film is an absolute must for fans of science fiction cinema.
1141;More than twenty years before you came along, the best science fiction movie of all time was made.
1142;it's Shakespeare), and better acting (way better acting).
1143;Even the special effects are good, extraordinary for the times.
1144;Always fun to watch this.
1145;The 1956 movie Forbidden Planet was as much a step forward in special effects in its day as 2001 in 1968 and Star Wars in 1978.
1146;Not only that, but it also had a great story line.
1147;Forbidden Planet is undisputibly a science fiction classic.
1148;The film itself is pretty simple.
1149;The character are excellent as well.
1150;Walter Pidgeon is great as the scientist Morbius and Captain Adams (Leslie Neilson in an unbelievably serious role) odviously inspires Star Trek's Kirk.
1151;This is a true classic.
1152;Not only is the storyline intelligent, the acting is excellent and the special effects are so much better than the average 1956 movie.
1153;This one has it all.
1154;As an extra, the model of Robbie the Robot is cute and very detailed, too.
1155;I love the classic sci.
1156;If you have never seen this movie, you are in for a big surprise.
1157;Even by todays standards it is a masterpiece of technology.
1158;I was about 13 years old at the time and thought it was the second best movie I had ever seen (Around The World In 80 Days being number 1).
1159;cool special effects for that time period.
1160;Today it shows it's age but the special effects were outstanding for their day.
1161;I hear a modern remake, this time a trilogy, may be in the works.
1162;Made in 1953, it was one of my favorites as a kid.
1163;i thought the boys might find the special effects a little hokey since they were brought up on CGI but after about 15 minutes into the movie, the 12 year old turned to me and said, This is a good movie, Grandpa.
1164;Ooh you'll get it good.
1165;All the stuff runs on mind power.
1166;Special effects are pretty good for 1956, as is the story itself.
1167;I love all the film trivia and cultural aspects they bring up on these tracks.
1168;as the documentary on disc 2 states, this is THE science fiction film of all time and the one that started it all
1169;I saw it the first time in the 50's on a regular theatre screen .
1170;fi with a thought provoking plot, for decades to come.
1171;This early science fiction movie was way ahead of its time in special effects and had the complete package, cast, script, plot.
1172;it truly did justice to the award.
1173;winning science fiction novel of the same name.
1174;This is one of the great classic scifi movies of all time.
1175;I love the contrast between scifi movies now and this one.
1176;This movie is still a timeless masterpiece off science fiction.
1177;Wonderful after 50 years and still going strong!
1178;Classic, loved this movie since I was a kid.
1179;Great story, will watch again and again.
1180;It was cutting edge in the day and very much a product of its time.
1181;It was also about the only time in the 1950's that a SciFi show had a good budget, production values and decent stars.
1182;Considering the year that this movie was filmed, the special effects are very sophisticated, and the story interesting.
1183;It is fun to compare the space exploration in this movie to what is going on today.
1184;This movie is one of the best older science fiction films of all time.
1185;the best monster ever, the first humanized robot and the first space romance!
1186;this is science fiction at it best for the time it came out .
1187;Amazing considering the 1956 technology used to make it.
1188;Unlike today the movie isn't dominated by computer graphics and has lots of actual acting as a major strength of the production.
1189;This has always been my favorite Sci.
1190;This is a great movie with excellent actors, with gorgeous sets, and COLOR!
1191;The special features with a making of, and the history of Robbie the Robot are just what I wanted.
1192;This is a story based on Shakespeare's Tempest play, and Warner Brothers studios didn't cut any corners on this movie.
1193;My husband loves this movie.
1194;He was talking about it just before Christmas so I got online to see what was available.
1195;Very nice gift set for the Robbie the Robot admirer!
1196;He loved it and sat right down and watched the movie.
1197;This is absolutely My All Time favorite.
1198;If you like Forbidden Planet, then this is a perfect way to enjoy it more.
1199;this is my favorite scifi movie.
1200;It's an adaptation of the Tempest, set on a distant planet, and handles things very cleverly.
1201;There's humor, romance, adventure, and cliches you'll be reciting for years to come.
1202;This is still good to watch even today!
1203;This movie is still my favorite.
1204;Forbidden Planet is truely a classic and will be enjoyed by any generation.
1205;The grand father to Star Trek and Star Wars, watching Robbie along with the tonalities is absolutely awesome!
1206;and this is by far the best picture and sound.
1207;Great addition to any collection (a must).
1208;I got this movie at the request of my husband.
1209;fi but it is still Classic early sci.
1210;This is a wonderful sci fi classic that has set the bar for every sci fi adventure film that has come out since and those still to come.
1211;There three films defined science fiction, as we know it today.
1212;IT has elements of a murder mystery, with hilarious subplots about a nave young girl and hungry boys lucked up in psace for a year.
1213;Yes, but it is fun to watch.
1214;Aside from being cheaper, this builds the suspense to an incredible level.
1215;Come on.you see Alien and you see a lanky guy in a rubber suit.
1216;But an invisible villain lets your imagination run wild, which can be wilder than anything Hollywood can ever make.
1217;Walter Pidgeon gives a masterful performance, and steals the show.
1218;the costuming and sets are superb.
1219;Most experimental soundtracks flop, but this comes off perfectly, since it is suggested that the music we a re listening to is actually Krell music.
1220;wide screen, wide screen, wide screen!Two parting thoughts:First, at the heart of this movie is a psycho.
1221;thriller that brings your mind to the edge as you are forced to look at yourself.
1222;This is the first of the best SF.
1223;Has the best of the past and the future GOOD movies learned from this one.
1224;Saw this movie 5 times in the theater as a kid and the monster from the Id scared me each time but I loved it.
1225;One of the best Science Fiction Movies ever.
1226;A classic science fiction film in all respects.
1227;The extras included are nice, including a complete second feature film The Invisible Boy , and several extras from the original.
1228;rate (man's difficulty with very advanced technology), and the acting and effects are good enough to bring it off well.
1229;Young and old should watch this together.
1230;Robby The Robot to this day still permeates our society as what a robot is and can do for man.
1231;Usage of humor, the lack of bad language and a great story equates this movie to one of the all time greats.
1232;Both come with lots extras, especially the metal Ultimate.
1233;as being made of a unique metal alloy.
1234;Overall, though, it's a beautiful package.
1235;One of the best super.
1236;The digital picture and 5.1 sound are a marvel.
1237;* Even on my standard ratio 480i home theatre it looks spectacular.
1238;Let's face it, you can only push the film stock of a 50.
1239;of special note on this set are two new documentaries done especially for the 50th Anniversary release: Amazing!
1240;They're worth the price of this set alone, IMO.
1241;For most this will be the first time these lost scenes will be seen.
1242;I have every confidence that this Ultimate Collector's Eition will receive high marks from both reviewers and fellow Forbidden Planet aficionados everywhere.
1243;All three magazines taken together give an extremely thorough history of FP's creation and production.
1244;I enjoy Star Trek next gen and this felt so similar to a good plot line form one of those.
1245;It also had respectful special effects to make it feel real enough.
1246;But mainly it was the good plotline that kept me interested to see where it was going.
1247;I was pleasantly surprised by this one.
1248;This film is pretty remarkable, considering it is from the 1950s.
1249;It's easy to see how it influenced later sci.
1250;Clearly, the propulsion method and overall handling of star travel inspired Rodenberry for Star Trek.
1251;until then, I'll keep checking out the original.
1252;fi film is viewable in the wide.
1253;It's clear that the full.
1254;screen, pan and scan format simply does not work for some films and Forbidden Planet is a prime example.
1255;Suspenseful, beautifully written by Cyril Hume (a descendant of the philosopher), and gorgeous to look at, this wonderful transfer restores and reveals the masterpiece that's been hidden for so long.
1256;This is one of the best science fiction classics of all time.
1257;make of this great movie with modern technology.
1258;The special effects made use of .
1259;but in usage are just fine to express the effects needed to carry the great plot.
1260;The actors and acting are grand.
1261;she appears with smooth curves and beauty very much like the first Barbie dolls .
1262;but she is lively, animated and expressive as well.
1263;effects all thru the movie are wonderful .
1264;It is all done so well that it is still quite alien hi.
1265;which have comparable classic virtues.
1266;I first saw this movie when I was a child and I loved it.
1267;This film is possibly the pinnacle of sci.
1268;this is the film that seemed to have inspired the original Star Trek series, both in theme and style.
1269;it has a Captain, a fair maiden, a stately scientist, a cadre of astronauts (who really act like WWII Navy men right down to the stereotypically undisciplined cook character,) a mysterious robot with unknown intentions, and a force that that threatens to destroy them all.
1270;this is one of the few science fiction films from the Fifties that is both entertaining AND intelligent.
1271;I would love to review this film.
1272;please, PLEASE release it world.
1273;I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it.
1274;Why can't I build one of those!Anyway, if you want a fun time with family, something everyone can enjoy then this is the movie for you.
1275;It has enough action, adventure and plus that old time charm that keeps me watching it.
1276;the outtakes were excellent, BTW.
1277;There are a handful of 1950's sci.
1278;fi movies that have a big reputation .
1279;When Worlds Collide, The Thing From Another World, Forbidden Planet, and The Day the Earth Stood Still.
1280;Part thriller, part drama, part mad.
1281;the actors are quite serious and for the most part are OK.
1282;Anne Francis is entertaining as the daughter who is initially somewhat innocent and ignorant of sex.
1283;An excellent piece of work with Leslie Neilson and a great choice of cast members.
1284;A great movie and I love the blu.
1285;Still a classic after all these years that belongs in any sci.
1286;As I grew older, it appeared on television and always rekindled those same scary feelings inside me.
1287;I watch it every year, usually around halloween.
1288;It was way ahead of it's time and still is.
1289;This movie reminds us of that.
1290;This must be the best value for money I struck in 2011.
1291;It contains both full screen and 16:9 widescreen formats.
1292;Fifty years after its theatrical release FORBIDDEN PLANET still ranks as one of the greatest sci.
1293;Of it's contemporaries, only 1951's THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL approaches its intelligence and depth.
1294;fiction film to take such a thought.
1295;provoking approach to the human condition.
1296;d, captained by a very young, very earnest Leslie Nielsen.
1297;morbius informs them that all is fine on the Forbidden Planet and bades them go on their way.
1298;honed, and the story moves along at a rapid clip (even for 1956), always keeping the viewer's attention.
1299;the dialogue is furiously funny at times.
1300;inebriated cook, who strikes up a satisfyingly one.
1301;dunk guaranteed to hold the attention of a typical heterosexual male viewer.
1302;A practice kissing sequence also made it into that film.
1303;Though Altaira is essentially a sex kitten role, she manages to imbue the character with dignity and humor, and gives a memorable performance.
1304;the sets are all posh and wonderfully futuristic (in a 1950s Swedish modern sort of way).
1305;(Yes, they look rather dated now, but considering they are fifty years old, they hold up surprisingly well against today's CGI.)
1306;with its balanced mix of science fiction, comedy, and classic drama, FORBIDDEN PLANET stands as one of the finest movies ever made.
1307;I always like his comedys and this one is a great one to get if you like his early work.
1308;This is a historically important film in both the SF genre and in film itself.
1309;It is certainly one of the best examples of what CAN be done when a little effort is put into a project, both in terms of the story execution, and the ideas that lay the foundation for the afterthoughts that the viewer takes away.
1310;witness the incredible depictions of the remaining Krell artifacts, the idea of the plastic educator, the brain booster, etc.
1311;Marvel at the beautiful set pieces.
1312;overall, just enjoy this great classic for what it is .
1313;thought provoking, intelligent, and fun.
1314;But this one is a cut above the rest by quite a lot.
1315;Obviously a lot of thought, time, and money went into this one and it shows.
1316;You can actually watch it and take it seriously (with a grain of salt), or you can just watch it as a great example of it's genre.
1317;The great thing about this edition are the extras.
1318;We weren't even aware of the other Robbie movie, and the story of Robbie is very interesting and makes the movie even more enjoyable.
1319;Some day it will probably be remade with up.
1320;date CGI special effects, but this classic still has its chops.
1321;But I remember seeing it and having my jaw drop when the Krell labs were revealed.
1322;The sheer sense of wonder!
1323;a. kind music by Louis and Bebe Barron was a daring choice back in the day.
1324;A true classic (1956) that raised the bar at a time when science fiction movies were stuck in the giant bugs and lizards theme.
1325;Excellent plot line following Shakespeare's Tempest.
1326;This is the first believable space movie, with excellent special effects, and who could forget Robbie the robot or that Invisible Monster!
1327;Cheesy effects by today's standards, but my favorite SciFifor years until Lucas rewrote special effects with Star Wars.
1328;Robby is still my favorite robot.
1329;It both fascinated and scared the daylights out of me, making several lasting impressions during the brief hour.

1332;including the likes of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Gene Roddenberry, and John Carpenter, to name a few .
1333;This provides the troubling, if not delectable irony that the monsters we find in space may well be the one's we bring with us, as inseparable companions in our journey among the stars.

1336;The women of that era had a knack for expressing paragraphs of unspoken thoughts with a simple Oh.
1337;Perhaps such is still true of today's women, but I delight in memories of those first women I know way back when.
1338;the extra features on the Blu.
1339;ray version are well worth watching.

1344;It is one of the original science fiction movies.
1345;But the concept of unlimited power corrupted by mosters from the id, is really rather unique and radical.
1346;While the look is dated it is wonderful, fun to watch, classic old.
1347;Great movie that proves that you do not have to use illiterate language (profanity) to get your point across, loved it.
1348;In fact, not as good as when watching this great flick on Turner Classic Movies.

1350;The extras are fine otherwise, including the Keep Watching the Skies documentary.

1354;but he understands that the attention span of modern audiences is as long as the latest pop single.
1355;NOT that Forbidden Planet is a good example of a great escapist sf movie.
1356;It's an old movie that I remember when I was younger,it's a classic.
1357;This is THE science fiction movie of the 1950's, and the prototype for the entire Star Trek series.
1358;Those are the two great ones
1359;Hey, most of us know that Forbidden Planet is quite likely the most influential sci.
1360;first, the Additional Scenes are priceless.
1361;Exploring the Far Reaches of Forbidden Planet featurette is a rather good documentary.
1362;Ann Francis looks amazingly good even to this day.
1363;fi Icon was an unexpected surprise and very entertaining.
1364;the TCM documentary Watch the Skies!
1365;so, there's an overview of the bonus features.
1366;A tremendous science fiction film!
1367;there is plenty to praise here.
1368;First, director Fred McLeod Wilcox is able to balance the cerebral themes with occasional humor and old fashioned romance, so that the movie remains above all else entertaining.
1369;Second, this production makes terrific use of matte paintings and a large cyclorama to illustrate the planet landscape of Altair IV.
1370;The composing couple of Louis and Bebe Barron brought forth here the first electronic music score to a mainstream film.
1371;Their music was groundbreaking and innovative.
1372;The eerie sounds have such character and give this flick a unique personality.
1373;All that said, Forbidden Planet is a smart mystery that excels in adventure and wonder.
1374;ray with handsome video, amazing audio and a plethora of extra features, which includes the outstanding documentary called Watch The Skies!

1376;That still stands my hairs up.
1377;I remember watching this when I was a kid.
1378;It's fun in it's simplicity and imagination.
1379;One of the best movies from the 1950's!
1380;Great cast and a classic story line!
1381;Great for the whole family!
1382;Great to have a favorite movie in my collection at long last.
1383;Made an afternoon of ironing a real pleasure.
1384;The visuals, the electronic music, Robbie the freak'n robot!
1385;This transcends being a classic.
1386;One of the best 50's science fiction films and a model for future films.
1387;If you still think Star Wars is the begining of modern Science Fiction movies see this one.
1388;Originality of concept, the music, and the visual effects were very imaginative for 1956, when this movie was released, silly as it may seem now.
1389;i just loved it and the fantastic special effects ( very good ones even by today standards ).
1390;anne Francis was a wonderful vision in her short dresses.
1391;It's all here: flying saucers, talking robots, force fields, alien monsters, psychic powers .
1392;The dialogue is surprisingly well.
1393;written and poetic, though like the plot it is jaw.
1394;The special effects have held up surprisingly well for a movie that is more than half a century old at this point.
1395;I would recommend this to any FP fan, but then most fans already have this I'm sure.
1396;I found this film tremendously entertaining and even enthralling when I first saw it as a teenager.
1397;It's held up surprisingly well for me over the years, and not all for nostalgic and sentimental reasons.
1398;The movie combines many intriguing themes and elements.
1399;to produce one of the great B sci.
1400;fi movies of the period, and one which really transcends the modest pretentions of that oft.
1401;And finally, the energy ray gun and the flying saucer spaceship are two very cool special effects.
1402;All in all still a great classic from the golden age of B science fiction movies and still worth watching today.
1403;Upon it he has chalked a diagram of the enigmatic pointed arches, Einstein's famous energy equation, other equations with possibly alien mathematical operators and symbols, and a drawing of the celestial sphere marking altitude and azimuth of something.
1404;overall, this movie is outstanding (5).
1405;Its story has mystery and an ample supply of wonder.
1406;Visually, the scenes on the surface of Altair.4 are believably alien.
1407;Forbidden PlanetGreat classic movie, Anne Francis very attractive, Leslie Nielson very young must be his first movie, Robbie the robot.
1408;One of my favorites from my childhood.
1409;Even the space ship makes it into a couple.
1410;Loads of fun is this movie.
1411;The plight of the Krell also gives us something to think about in our own automation evolution.
1412;I have been a huge fan of this movie for years and getting the chance to see it restored and on blu.
1413;ray made it all the more fun.
1414;There are some great special features on this disk also which are worth having a look at if your a fan of cinema or a fan of time period.
1415;Some of the effects may be dated compared to today's CGI but to watch the cleverness of the story unfold, and mystery of the Forbidden Planet unravel is always a treat.
1416;Have to love this movie.
1417;Disney did the special effects, which added a lot to the movie.
1418;If you like scifi this is a good one.
1419;One of the best sci fi films.
1420;Before there were special effects, there was a great story behind a movie.
1421;With that said, I was delighted to see his big screen debut on this sci.
1422;Forbidden Planet is a great movie, retelling Shakespeare's The Tempest in the Sci.
1423;An excellently arrogant Walter Pigeon has, through the use of alien technology, built for himself and his daughter, the beautiful Anne Francis, a virtual paradise, complete with robot servant and atomic.
1424;The rescue party, captained by a pre.
1425;The movie is still great 50 years after it was made.
1426;The BD transfer is incredible, the best ever.
1427;It's really clear and crisp, with just the right amount of film grain that's typical of 1950s sci.
1428;the sound is also great on this BD.
1429;Dialogue comes through cleanly and is well balanced against the sound effects.
1430;The robot almost steals the show.
1431;and as a love interest.
1432;if you watch it just to see the matte background paintings it will be worth your while, but you'll want to savor the whole thing.
1433;It's a vintage Sci Fi masterpiece.
1434;Forbidden Planet is probably the best work of Hollywood sci.
1435;Star Wars ranks up there, but this movie tops anything I have seen.
1436;the cinematography is great, and the special effects are almost epic for a movie from the fifties.
1437;The plot comes together quite well at the end, and though you'll probably have some idea towards the end about the resolution of the movie, it's still very enjoyable.
1438;It was he who wound up with the lovely Altaira.
1439;He faces the beast and denounces it, all the while knowing that he can no more disavow it than he could disavow his own inner demons.
1440;even after watching FORBIDDEN PLANET numerous times over the decades, I can still eagerly view it with each viewing, much like one of Shakespeare's plays, revealing a new facet to enjoy.
1441;The special effects, top notch as they are, are not what I take away from any viewing.
1442;What brings me back again and again to the fold is the realization that what is normally forbidden for anyone to make use of is under the right circunstances a license for brutality that can overwhelm the best of anyone us, including even the godlike Krell.
1443;fi classic on blue ray.
1444;You have got to see the transfer and the music and the sounds!
1445;I grew up in the '50s and this movie has influenced my visual and aural artistic sense over my whole life.
1446;So, I am very happy with the collector's edition of .
1447;The extra features and backround info about the movie are well worth the extra price if you are a fan of the film.
1448;Oh yeah, the transfer is exquisite!
1449;I first saw this movie when I was 8 years old and it still holds my attention and wonder.
1450;I love it: great cast, great sets, great colour, cod.
1451;It's not erudite, or genre making, but just a great piece of entertainment and escapism.
1452;when I bought mine, there was no European version (region 2) available, but the region 1 disc is nice (if you have a multi.
1453;A very literate story, with spectacular effects given the time of its production.
1454;Great performances by all involved.
1455;This is one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made!
1456;The movie may seem dated by today's standards, but it's a classic that can be watched over and over.
1457;Walter Pidgeon's role is great, He's perfectly cast .
1458;The special effects, costumes and scenery were outdated, but I enjoyed seeing movies as I did as a child.
1459;Good also to see famous actors when they were oh so young.
1460;Still true we outsmart ourselves.
1461;I am a big science fiction aficionado, and a massive Star Trek fan in particular.
1462;as a Trek fanatic, it was fascinating to see a film from 1956 which was so obviously a huge inspiration for Gene Roddenberry's original series.
1463;a United Earth space vessel that travels faster than light.
1464;brain scanners which impart huge loads of information directly into the minds of the recipientThese are but a few of the similarities, the most impressive of which might be the tonal similarity: the sense of seriousness and wonder at space exploration, mixed with just enough humor and sex appeal to keep things moving breezily.
1465;but more than just a preview for the Star Trek show that would emerge a decade later, we also get a good story with a fine emotional core, adapted very loosely from Shakespeare's Tempest .
1466;I won't spoil the secret we eventually learn about this scientist, but suffice it to say, it is an excellent science fiction concept which is well.
1467;the performances are all good, and the actors clearly took the material seriously.
1468;Leslie Nielsen cuts a fine figure as the square.
1469;the effects are also surprisingly good for a film of this day.
1470;Yes, we can tell with our modern eyes when optical effects, matte painted backdrops, and models are being used.
1471;The set designs are also terrific, with extremely detailed props.
1472;simply put, this is a seminal film, in the fullest possible sense of the word .
1473;it set an extremely high standard for the genre, and certainly gave birth to future greats like Star Trek.
1474;If you're a student of the genre, this is equally necessary.
1475;this is an interesting story with a lot of intelligence, but also a good amount of drama and heart.
1476;Just about anyone should be capable of being entertained by this .
1477;it's simply a good movie.

1479;Warner Bros. has scored again with a classic film transfer.

1498;I just pray the producers do it justice.
1499;This is one of those older movies that are worth watching over and over.
1500;I loved this movie so much that I wanted the collector's edition.
1501;Well worth the extra money.
1502;This is a fun movie and a classic.
1503;So much so you can see how it influenced later TV shows and films.
1504;which for its time had great special effects and a plot that could have been a Star Trek episode itself.
1505;A plot that not only drew from Shakespeare but toyed with the mind as well.
1506;Its also nice to be reminded that Leslie Nielson was not just a (brilliant) comedy buffoon but a slick dramatic performer as well.

1533;The psychology aspect ofthe movie is also very interesting.
1534;The story, ideas and impressive special effects hold up incredibly well today.

1536;It displays beautifully with vivid colors that draw the eyes.
1537;fi fiend friends will envy you for it.
1538;This classic science fiction movie is five star+ and always will be.
1539;It is one of my all time favorites.
1540;Being made before computers, it is classic.
1541;This is my favorite movie of all time.
1542;the package is excellent overall and good value.
1543;Forbidden Planet is probably the best representative of science fiction's golden age at the movies.
1544;The 1950's and 60's saw a generation of writers produce a series of excellent, though.
1545;And those with a keen eye will see how this movie heavily influence the original Star Trek.
1546;But this is still a treat.

1550;fi, you will love this movie.
1551;If you liked the recent flashy.
1552;But if you liked the original though.
1553;The first Sci Fi Movie I ever saw and still one of the best!
1554;Great movie, but it had a bad master.
1555;released this for a 50th anniversary with a restored master.
1556;all history of science fiction this is a must watch, however a modern audience probably wouldn't appreciate it unless they are fans of sci.
1557;it's the greatest sci fi film ever made.
1558;A great film that was ahead of it's time entertaining and thoughtful.
1559;for this time period the effects are surprisingly good.
1560;In the movie, you can see some effects that Star Trek used in its television show.
1561;The movie does have some laughs and tries to make a statement.
1562;I would recommend this movie to any.
1563;One of my favorites of all time!
1564;Not only does it offer a clever space.
1565;age interpretation of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST, the special FX are still eye.
1566;One of the best special FX in the film is, of course, Robby the Robot.
1567;He has become one of the most popular robots in the history of films and television, and as such, he has made cameo appearances in such movies as 1984's GREMLINS and 2003's LOONEY TUNES: BACK IN ACTION and on television shows like THE TWILIGHT ZONE and LOST IN SPACE.
1568;in addition to Robby, the three principal human actors in FORBIDDEN PLANET also contribute to the film's success.
1569;Leslie Nielsen is well known to film buffs as the comic star of such films as THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD (1988) and SPY HARD (1996).
1570;But here he does an excellent job in a serious role as John J. Adams, the commander of the spaceship, and for modern audiences, then, there is this added treat of seeing Nielson play one of the stodgy establishment types that he is now famous for parodying.
1571;voiced Walter Pidgeon is a masterful old.
1572;school thespian who is also a delight to watch.
1573;Here he makes his Dr. Morbius a devilishly pompous and pendantic patriarch, and the histrionics with which he does so are perfectly suited to the character.
1574;so the storytelling, the FX, and the acting all combine to make FORBIDDEN PLANET a compelling film that entertains but also makes you think.
1575;And to genre fans, that is science fiction at its best.
1576;For SF fans who want to add this piece of classic American cinema to their collections, the reasonable amazon.
1577;com price makes it easy!
1578;This movie should be required viewing for anyone interested in the science fiction venue.
1579;This is one of the best special edition packs yet.
1580;If you love everything Robby the Robot then this edition is for you .
1581;this is the best transfer yet and the added bonus of The Invisible Boy .
1582;well I would suggest getting it now.
1583;this was never one of my favorite films but Robby always one of the best and 'true.
1584;I was actualy impressed at how they did some of the effects for this.
1585;Even tho I can tell they where drawn is as a cartoon, they are done exceptionly well for a 1956 film.
1586;It was weird watchign him do strait acting, but after a while I got into it.
1587;I can see why it's a classic easily.
1588;It starts well, continues well, and ends well.
1589;All 3 elements of making a good film.
1590;With some respectable SFX thrown in for extra enjoyment.
1591;One of the extras is the Turner documentary Watch the Skies!
1592;: Science Fiction, the 1950s and Us and features mainly films from the first half of the 1950s, leading up to Forbidden Planet.
1593;Want to see the film enhanced?
1594;I received the Ultimate Collector's Edition for Christmas, and was extremely grateful.
1595;The movie is an absolute science fiction classic, worthy of FIVE STAR accolades, however, I highly recommend that anyone interested in the 50th Anniversary Edition consider the Forbidden Planet Two.
1596;please allow me to explain why.
1597;the Ultimate Collector's Edition comes with a second movie, The Invisible Boy which also stars the legendary Robbie the Robot.
1598;It's nice for the suggestion, but I don't think I've ever taken one of them.
1599;next, the tin package is cool, but it contains many other things you'll never really care about.
1600;It's a cat toy, truth be told, and if you remove it from the tin, you'll lose it.
1601;the package also comes with lobby cards for both Forbidden Planet and the movie you don't really care about.
1602;In terms of screenplay, special effects, art direction and music score, Forbidden Planet excels in comparison to the legion of sci.
1603;Though made a decade before Kubrick's 2001: A space Odyssey, Forbidden Planet visually offers a surprisingly realistic view of life in outer space.
1604;The psychological twist that solves the mystery of the invisible monster threatening the story's leads is one of the most creative ever conjured as well.
1605;Its a classic and timeless sci.
1606;I grew up watching this movie as a kid and still love it today.
1607;I was pleasantly surprised with the graphics of this movie.
1608;Also, I was better able to like and appreciate the story and characters as an adult since the last time I saw this movie was in my childhood.
1609;I recommend it to any science fiction fans.
1610;Good movie if your into old sci.
1611;great movie for it's time.1956
1612;The special effects are the absolute best.
1613;It had to have been quite a treat to go and watch this at a drive.
1614;it was probably the film's brightly colored Cinemscope, friendly robot Robby, and neat.
1615;The impact on Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek was substantial, right down to the costumes, the communicators, and, of course, the allegory .
1616;see for science fiction fans, if only because it is so recognizable in retrospect.
1617;sided, with full screen on one side and widescreen on the other.
1618;The print is perfectly watchable but not clean.
1619;As a bonus, there is another film on one of the disk and many many many extras.
1620;Very clear on my Kindle.
1621;it's from back in the day, but I still like it.
1622;This is a great product.
1623;The box is very cute but came slightly dented from shipping.
1624;The Robbie doll is cute also.
1625;While somewhat primitive based on what we see today, the special effects and sets created for this sci.
1626;fi classic raised the bar for the genre.
1627;to guy for comedic parodies, he was a serious actor and yes, this is a serious film.
1628;sure, the film has its share of cheese but it is easily offset by a more serious look at our inner selves.
1629;Perhaps more important is that Forbidden Planet took a serious look at science fiction in film and set the stage for Star Trek, Star Wars and others to follow.
1630;as an aside, the Blu ray package includes a terrific TCM documentary Watch the Skies!
1631;fi films of the 50's featuring interviews with the aforementioned Spielberg, George Lucas, James Cameron and Ridley Scott.
1632;These guys know their film history and really get excited about these science fiction classics.
1633;A favorite movie growing up and now I've introduced it to mine an they love it.
1634;This is an awesome movie to see for Science Fiction Fans, not as well known as many better known series like Star Trek, or Lost in Space that happen later, but concepts seen in this film look like where these interesting concepts, like the transporter, and talking robot came from.
1635;special thanks to Amazon for carrying this and many Classic films!!
1636;If you love the original sci.
1637;This wholly engrossing, action science fiction is a sleeper from the 50's.
1638;Although for certain the ego really doesn't look like this, nor operate exactly like this, the parallels of the movie are both instructive and powerful as an emotional approach to understanding the human condition.
1639;Besides, much spiritual wisdom equates an emotional approach as superior to a logical one.
1640;Think of Jesus and the parables.
1641;This is a wonderful set to commerate this movie!
1642;We enjoyed everything about it and all the extra features!!
1643;We bought three of them, one as a gift and one to open and enjoy and the thrid to keep sealed!
1644;This is our most favorite old SiFi, campy movie!
1645;Can't tell you how many times we have enjoyed it!!
1646;This set is a great collectors edition, a must have!
1647;It was interesting to see how science fiction movies have evolved since this one was made.
1648;A worthwhile movie to see
1649;It is amazing that after almost 50 years this movie still holds up.
1650;The special effects are pretty good by 1956 standards.
1651;The acting is actually good too.
1652;I could watch the whole movie just to see Robby!
1653;if you are a science fiction buff, then you should definitely add this classic movie to your collection.
1654;anyway, I LOVE this movie and I hope you will as well.
1655;I personally think it is great!
1656;Oh and his beautiful daughter, Altaira (Anne Francis).
1657;pidgeon is most famous for his series of films with Greer Garson, including the Oscar winner Mrs. Miniver.
1658;By the way he reunited with Anne Francis, sort of, in Funny Girl.
1659;the rest of the cast was up and comers.
1660;Most found their success in television.
1661;So as you can see, there are a lot of familiar faces here.
1662;The sets are great but they look like sets.
1663;The effects were state of the are for the 50's and extremely clean.
1664;They blend very well with the scene, they do not look at all fake.
1665;It would increase your enjoyment of the film to see The Tempest.
1666;Remembered seeing this as a kid and really enjoyed the campy sci fi, but now realize that it has a unique and interesting story line (though Shakespeare might be rolling in his grave) that is missing from many of today's sci fi films.
1667;After so many years and so many movies, Forbidden Planet remains a shining star in the science fiction universe.
1668;A solid story that is tight and well crafted with a stellar cast, Forbidden Planet is fun and has deep meanings.
1669;worth every single penny I paid for it
1670;This movie was ahead of it's time, the special effects were amazing and Robby the robot was an incredible feature
1671;For that reason despite 50+ years this movie remains a timeless classic.
1672;This blu ray is fairly sharp most of the time, colors are good and sound is good.
1673;Worth the upgrade just because of the improvement in picture.
1674;It's great to see a old.
1675;fiction movie from one's childhood.
1676;It's good to see all the actors in their prime of life way back when.
1677;One of the great 50s science fiction movies with very good actors.
1678;Excellent movie enhanced with lots of bonus features.
1679;Forbidden Planet is the grand daddy of todays blockbuster sci.
1680;An excellent hi definition classic!
1681;Fun for all and the color and detail is amazing.
1682;The disc worked fine in both of my players one being a PS3.
1683;One of the best s. f movies I have ever seen.
1684;A very deep message and together with the show of our real enemies .
1685;There should be more films like this.
1686;and has Leslie Nielsen in a serious part!Also comes with a second movie The Invisible Boy that features that robot again .
1687;The colors are vibrant and clear, the sound is excellent.
1688;This is a classic science fiction film that set new standards for special effects.
1689;It definitley has everything an old SciFi 1950's film has: cheesy dialogues/a beautiful woman/ great and simple special effects/monsters.
1690;Thanks Amazon for this great deal
1691;This outstanding movie was the forerunner of all big budget SciFi.
1692;A must see for viewing Robby The Robot, the first real movie robot.
1693;This is a MUST for you, an SF fan.
1694;Compare this movie with Michael Crichton's Sphere .
1695;Great writing, top actors,, the best special effects that could be had in the 50's.
1696;Put it all together and you have an entertaining, frightening, and campy classic, with a good detective story throughout.
1697;A truly groundbreaking film .
1698;There are some painfully dated elements, but overall a fine film.
1699;ray, how great is that?
1700;A really fun old movie to watch, I love this.
1701;The effects are amazing for its time.
1702;I'm a huge fan of Forbidden Planet, it has long held a place in my heart as one of the all time Sci Fi greats.
1703;The image sharply gets more detailed, or swapping to FX less detailed.
1704;A ground breaking movie as well.
1705;This one I have been trying to find locally but with no luck and was so happy to have found it one line.
1706;If you are a sci fi fan this is one for your library.
1707;This set was very well presented.
1708;The box alone makes a great collector's item.
1709;Still, it was interesting seeing Robbie in something else.
1710;The three documentaries were really fascinating, so sci.
1711;fi film buffs would love those.
1712;always good bring back old times.
1713;I saw this movie in 1956 and it was a sensation.
1714;This release explains why and it is a great rendition/restoration.
1715;I do enjoy old sci.
1716;I saw this movie when i was young and it scared me a lot but i was enthralled with the concept,s and the best thing about the movie i think was the sound affect,s they made it for me .
1717;fi horror in the best style and to date i have found few movie,s that have moved me in the same way apart from the dalek.
1718;The special effects were quite good, and for some reasom it reminds me of the old star trek tv show.
1719;This movie rates as one of the best sci.
1720;fi movies of all time, easily in the top 10.
1721;Certainly it is my favorite pre 1970's sci.
1722;The cinematography was truly memorable and story line captivating.
1723;It has everything, horror, action, great scenes and plot, and even a beautiful maiden.
1724;I can never get enough of this great classic.
1725;The transfer looks very clean and the movie is timeless.
1726;The special effects are great, but the sets and costuming are lavish, creative, beautiful, and show that MGM touch .
1727;servicing and still operational .
1728;all of the actors are well cast and the acting is far better than most sci.
1729;Robby is certainly the most successful robot actor on film.
1730;disney's The Black Hole, which I believe to be one of the most beautiful sci.
1731;fi films ever made, pays homage to Forbidden Planet.
1732;The next time you watch The Black Hole, think of the tour Morbius gives to Captain Adams and the view looking up and down the 150 or so stories in the underground Krell power plant.
1733;While, some of the special effects may look cheesy by today's standards, taken as a whole, Forbidden Planet remains a great and highly entertaining sci.
1734;The films, special features, and extras make it worth what I paid.
1735;This is an icon of scifi movies.
1736;A must see for anyone.
1737;A masterpiece of special effects for it's time.
1738;You will see many actors you will recognize.
1739;This is a ground breaking movie that still holds it own against anything Hollywood is releasing today.
1740;Watch this film and you'll have to agree.
1741;I saw this when I was young and marveled at the special effects.
1742;It has a great story line and I learned something from it.
1743;I highly recommend this for the whole family.
1744;Surprisingly good special effects for its age, and then there is Robbie the Robot's first appearance .
1745;I can see the ideas for Star Trek now and then.
1746;This film is one of the cornerstones of Science Fiction Cinema and something that any serious fan of the genre must possess!
1747;I remember seeing it for the first time at the drive.
1748;Still chuckle at that even after all these years.
1749;I really enjoyed seeing this movie again.
1750;Just kick back in the easy chair and enjoy it.
1751;the second movie The Invisible Kid, well YIKES.
1752;is the best I can say if I want to keep all my commments G rated.
1753;aware computer did bring a twist to the plot that at least made the flick watchable.
1754;For a change, I found the special features to be actually entertaining.
1755;Overall it's well worth the money and is a keeper you'll be glad to have in your library.
1756;Just got done reading 'The Tempest' for college lit class, and it was suggested that 'Forbidden Planet' was a modern.
1757;Great movie if you like science fiction.
1758;This widescreen (VHS) is the ultimate in viewing and listening pleasure.
1759;The colors are bright and the soundtrack knocks your socks off.
1760;One of my favorite all time syfy, watched in the late 60's still looks cool, especially in high def and late night!
1761;I got this dc set for my husband's birthady as it is his favorite movie of all time.
1762;This is one of the greatest Sci.
1763;The story line is great.
1764;It was done very well.
1765;walter Pidgeon plays his part very well.
1766;robbie, the Robot is an important part of the story.
1767;i've seen this movie many times since 1956 and it's still enjoyable.
1768;This movie is by far the best of the 50's Sci.
1769;A kind of spiritual pilot for the Star Trek franchise.
1770;serious but holds up better than most modern attempts to imitate it.
1771;The design of the robot tells you something about how long people have tried to imagine a mechanical man.
1772;This is what good sci fi is all about.
1773;Fun to watch and takes you back to simpler times with special effects.
1774;Everything about it is so well done!!!
1775;Invite some friends and make some popcorn, you'll be glad you did!
1776;The 1950's was the golden age of science fiction, many great films were made, that even now influence our lives and thoughts today.
1777;One such film is Forbidden Planet, and for me.
1778;It is still one of the best films.
1779;Not only that but it introduced one of the best great robots of all time .
1780;Robby, this robot is so iconic, it.
1781;now as for the acting skills of the performers, Walter Pidgeon is perfectly cast as Dr. Edward Morbius, you don't know wether to love him or pity him in his struggle with his Id, and over developed intellect.
1782;Then there's the lovely Anne Francis as Altaira, Morbius' daughter, beautiful, nave, and bright.
1783;Leslie Nielsen as Commander J. J. Adams, strong and heroic.
1784;unusual name, wise, intelligent, a close friend of the commander.
1785;A well balanced cast in my opinion.
1786;which is itself worth getting.
1787;well it worked with me, and looking at the metal box it came in, you can easily fit a 6 inch Robby figure.
1788;wouldn't you?All in all this 50th Anniversary Edition of Forbidden Planet is cool, and the film is my third all.
1789;fi film, and it's easy to see why.
1790;one final point, Forbidden Planet is pure science fiction at it's best for the era, and it still hold up today, this is science fiction as it was meant to be, this film set standards for future films to follow.
1791;The ideas of the future back in the 50's and 60's were mind stirring.
1792;This is another classic SciFi movie that brings back a lot of memories.
1793;Great cast , excellent acting and ( for its time ) amazing effects.
1794;That along with a great story line make this a movie I could watch every week.
1795;now that I'm older I appreciate the story line much more.
1796;every time it came on TV when I can catch it I watched it.
1797;now I can see it any time I like and my grown children as well.
1798;they like it too, it's a classic.
1799;It's one of the films (along with She, Island of Lost Souls, The Day the earth Stood Still, and a handfull of others) that transformed science fiction films, from their undeserved status as kids' stuff, to serious depictions of the human condition.
1800;iV
1801;It's also a damned good story, a powerful depiction of a man destroyed by his darkest subconscous obsessions.
1802;one of the most important reasons this film was taken seriously was its special effects.
1803;Many of them were, and still are, some of the best of their kind.
1804;Even by today's advanced standards, a good deal of the visuals are real.
1805;And even the soundstage set has its moments .
1806;well, Walter Pidgeon pretty much carries the film, which is really only fair as his character is the key to everything.
1807;Anne Francis, who would later go on to immortality in a lyric from Rocky Horror Picture Show, is very good .
1808;And Leslie Nielsen, a very funny guy who persists in doing unfunny movies, here does an admirable job with a role that was written to be one.
1809;The supporting cast perform their various script.
1810;even in spite of such obvious mistakes, Forbidden Planet is still a classic, a great film in any category, and will be loved by anybody who loves movies.
1811;Considering the time period the movie was made, the special effects are terrific.
1812;fi movies then this is a must have one.
1813;The little robot and the (small) lobby cards are worth having.
1814;Also the director really wants you to get how amazing techonology is!
1815;an homage to a stainless steel column stool a la a fifties diner.2.
1816;The first third of this movie is a nerds.
1817;This is probably the second best science fiction film, second only after The Day the Earth Stood Still, from the golden age of science fiction, when movies made you think.
1818;Acting and a good plot line today seems to have taken a subordinate role.
1819;The graphics on the Tin can that all this came is is beautiful.
1820;Forbidden Planet is one of the first adult science fiction movies with advanced special effects.
1821;Humor, a love interest, and an interesting view of the human subconcious, the ID.
1822;It is a study of human strength and weakness as well as science gone bad.
1823;I first saw this movie as an eight year old at a drive in with my family and enjoyed it again recently at age 61.
1824;It's influence on the gene from the 1950's right up to the present is well documented.
1825;fi picture done right!Here is my personal story.
1826;fi fare and even then this picture stood out as a favorite of mine.
1827;The story gave me a much better appreciation of the role 'science' could play in telling a story of human dimension and scope.
1828;there are few movies I recommend as highly as Forbidden Planet when asked for a Sci.
1829;also, to any budding radio and electronics's buff of the early 60's Robby was an absolute delight.
1830;It's worth very penny of the price.
1831;I loved the classic sci.
1832;Robby the Robot is awesome and my favorite character.
1833;If you want a classic science fiction flick, you'll enjoy FORBIDDEN PLANET!!!
1834;A true classic of Science Fiction and movie making in general!
1835;I has seen this movie when it first came out.
1836;I was a Cyril Hume fan an I wanted to see what he did with a movie.
1837;It has been one of my SF favorites ever since.
1838;It is somewhat crude in its special effects by todays standards but it is a solid adaptation of Shakespeare's play updated for a 50's audience.
1839;It is a thoroughly enjoyable movie with the evil being more subtle than in today's movies.
1840;Anne Francis, Walter Pigeon, Earl Hollister's comic relief and Leslie Neilsen's all turn in good performances.
1841;Also, Robbie the Robot's debut is a landmark.
1842;That character has evolved into an icon for SF fans.
1843;See why it has earned a niche in the genre of Science Fiction movies.
1844;Amazon had a great price and delivery was right on time.
1845;Faced with the first men she's ever seen, outside of Daddy and pictures, she responds with enthusiasm
1846;Pity the Creature from the Id has to crash the party and spoil her fun.
1847;I just love this movie, for old time effects its really good.
1848;still kind of creeps me out when I watch it today.
1849;This movie is considered by many aficionados of the genre to be among the top three science fiction movies ever.
1850;not to forget, Robby the Robot and, one of the most important things Science Fiction gives us, a look into the human psyche .
1851;I have always liked Forbidden Planet.
1852;It on one of my favorite science fiction movies.
1853;another thing the film brings back is the intense single minded love a woman has for a man
1854;i enjoyed this film when I saw it in 1954 and I enjoyed it in 2013
1855;as far as science fiction films go
1856;Many of the cool design features in these TV series were lifted directly from Forbidden Planet.
1857;gater on board said saucer, a glass domed device with a moving mini.
1858;it is the cool floor.
1859;story underground city, is lifted directly from the same construction of the Krell.
1860;I'm sure many of you can find even more things copied from this wonderful, ground.
1861;One of my all time favorite movies.
1862;The special effects are spectacular and the actors are all first rate especially Earl Holliman.
1863;This 50th anniversary edition I ordered is FULLY RESTORED!
1864;I really enjoyed it and the extra material with it.
1865;one of the best old classic sci.
1866;This is a classic movie.
1867;This is one of best sci fi movies I have seen for its time it is the best I have seen.
1868;A very good story line and the people to make it work make for a wonderful Sci.
1869;fi flick for the whole family.
1870;Considering when this movie was released, it HAS to be rated one of the most powerful and intruiging sci.
1871;The story line seems plausible and is enchanting (based on a well.
1872;known play), the acting splendid, and the special effects outstanding!
1873;And to view the video in stereo is the frosting on the cake.
1874;I first saw this movie in the theatre back in '56 or '57 when it came out, but with the new sound effects, the audio is amazing.
1875;And it's effect is superb.
1876;names', just beginning their acting careers.
1877;Anyone who is a sci.
1878;From Robby Robot's costume to the special effects by Disney Studios and the breakthrough music, it is an excellent movie!
1879;The special affects were pretty good also.
1880;A nice movie to add to your collection.
1881;The tin is a very nice collectors item.
1882;As well as the entire discussion of ego and id controlling our actions and emotions.
1883;Movie was great in that it held a suspenseful captivating experience throughout itself.
1884;The movie kept ones attention at all times making you wonder what was going to happen next.
1885;Absolutely one of the best science fiction movies ever made!It touches on some of the most relevant questions of our time: space exploration, our reliance on technology, the development of artificial intelligence, and the essence of what it means to be human.
1886;Classic is a term brandished about too frequently but Forbidden Planet is a film worthy of that recognition.
1887;This is an intelligent, well.
1888;written, and paced well with few lapses in action.
1889;generated wonders, are still impressive.
1890;walter Pidgeon, who during the 40's had starred in several popular MGM films, adds just the right amount of authority to his role as the enigmatic Dr. Morbius.
1891;a. kind listening experience, otherworldly and provocative.
1892;One of the great science fiction stories ever.
1893;Best way to enjoy a story without all of the fluff .
1894;It truly is a classic.
1895;It continues to be relevant through the years.
1896;The special effects may be a tad dated but they fulfill the need and continue to hold their own.
1897;The crew is much more at ease with each other than you see in most science fiction where there's a command structure.
1898;Then, we have the stunning Anne Francis who's got a face to die for.
1899;This is definitely a must see.
1900;The collectable character was sweet as well, and the Lobby Cards set it apart.
1901;or at least dropped it, and I was able to pull out the dent, but it is far from mint and collectable condition.
1902;Forbidden Planet is the best sci.
1903;The special effects are well ahead of their time (it was released in 1956).
1904;Scenes and plot devices were later used in Star Trek and Star Wars It is scary and dark with deep psychological themes.
1905;It also features one of the great robots of all time: Robbie the Robot.
1906;One of the most intelligent sci.
1907;she's only the love of my life.
1908;I got this deluxe package from her for Christmas.
1909;Assemble your Klystron Monitor and enjoy.
1910;This is one of the original Sci.
1911;Freeze frames are very pixelated and noisy, but look great otherwise.
1912;there are also some cool extras .
1913;If you're a classic SciFi fan, it's a must have!
1914;This has to be my favorite movie about space travel and alien life.
1915;The landing of an exploration spaceship is believable and the technology is also reasonable.
1916;they encounter a former explorer who has taken up residence and is a great scientist.
1917;a real plus, I think.
1918;How wonderful it was to see this movie again.
1919;maniacal scientist this movie has it all.
1920;A simple United Planet recon trip to a colony established some years earlier turns deadly.
1921;True, the love affair between the dashing captain and the lovely daughter of the recluse is a bit schmaltzy but the effects were first rate for their time and opened up many new possibilities in the film.
1922;I like it because its old school and I saw it when I was a kid.
1923;This has the early feel of classic Si Fi from a historical perspective it has a simple plot and special effects and gives the viewer a glimpse into the mind of the director struggling to tell a story with a limited budget in an age before modern technology.
1924;It is an interesting object to contrast how far modern movies with their mega budget have come.
1925;this was and still is one of the best big screen events many years ago, middle 50's I think, but all the special effects, roby the robot made his third appearance on this movie, the big winner was the sound effects they had i8n the movie, won a few awards that year.
1926;great writer's, great music score's and a great cast make this one of the best all around big screen sci fi movies of all times.
1927;Great story, fabulous casting, Disney special effects, Robbie the Robot debuts, therimin sound effects .
1928;It also comes with a second disc with rare footage and documentaries which feature big time movie business folk.
1929;please continue the fantastic operation we have all come to adore.
1930;This is a classic movie showing the future bright and hopeful with science and space travel being pushed to the frontiers.
1931;It is also a love story and Leslie Nielson gives an outstanding and professional performance as the commander of his crew.
1932;It shows he can be a serious actor.
1933;The perfect sci fi movie.
1934;It holds up and is definitely worth seeing.
1935;the difference between this and the washed out SD edition is amazing.
1936;That was before I found the surprise bonuses, a full version of the Invisible Boy, a movie I saw as a kid and loved.
1937;Great movie based on a true event,LOL kidding but a great movie before all the digital special effects have made movies just something to look at.
1938;fi movies this is a must own movie.
1939;It's fun watching all the first instances of situations that have become tropes for the genre.
1940;overall the movie was good, I thought this version would have had the interviews with the actors still alive concerning the movie
1941;I have enjoyed it for many years.
1942;It was truely unique for its time.
1943;I don' t want to spoil anybody's fun here (enjoy it, folks!)
1944;Forbidden Planet has three things going for it: The terrific electronic soundtrack, the sets and Robby the robot .
1945;who gives the only memorable performance.
1946;(Try to imagine Robert Wise as director .
1947;this is pure fairy tale, with all its innocent wonders, but also all its naivity and restrictions.
1948;fair enough to say that Forbidden Planet inspired numerous space operas and SF TV series, it even contains a shot that bears remarkable similarity to 2001: A Space Odyssee .
1949;this is the right stuff if you liked When Worlds Collide , This Island Earth or George Pal's movies.
1950;I really enjoyed this movie.
1951;i watched this with my 6 year old and he enjoyed it too.
1952;i highly recommend this sci.
1953;This is one of the best SciFi movies of all time (#1 being The Day The Earth Stood Still).
1954;The special effects are astounding
1955;The acting is quite good.
1956;Walter Pidgeon is perfect as Morbius.
1957;Leslie Nielsen as Adams does a credible job in a dramatic role (but you can't help slipping to Naked Gun).
1958;And, while I have seen the film at least 50 times, I still enjoy it and I still see something interesting in the special effects or the sets.
1959;more years than you need to know about!
1960;And it's still a great scare for the younger set, and keeps the older set still on the edge of their seats!
1961;And those of you who loved Leslie Nielson as the white haired hilarious cop, you'll be amazed at how incredibly handsome.
1962;I was very impressed at the speed of receiving this product.
1963;Also, after giving this gift to my fiancee we found that it included a wonderful full length movie, The Invisible Boy.
1964;fi and enjoyed both of these movies.
1965;Cheap props and bad acting makes for entertainment and all round good times.
1966;And both sides have some very good points.
1967;The acting is competent at best and mawkish most of the time.
1968;And, yeah, a lot of it does look clich now, especially if you're a big fan of Twilight Zone.
1969;But if you can think about it as a lot of tropes that had never, at the time, been seen before, you may be able to catch a glimpse of the magic here.
1970;paced and fun, if shallow.
1971;and the movie does still hold up very well after all this time.
1972;Bottom line, it's a lot of fun.
1973;This classic from 1956 shows its age a bit now but is still first rate.
1974;The special effects are excellent and the matte work by Disney's Josh Meador create an eerie mood that highlights and enhances the story.
1975;ray version is excellent and adds much needed depth to the proceedings.
1976;This is one of my favorite all time Science.
1977;It doesn't grab you like Invasion of the Body Snatchers (my all time favorite from this era) but you will be entertained by the excellent production values an the brisk pacing.
1978;altair 4 is a beautiful little green world 22 light years from earth.
1979;Millions of years ago it was the home of the Krell, a wise an noble race of beings that had been wiped out in a single night.
1980;I wonder how many generations of us will continue to enjoy the movie.
1981;Robbie the robot debuts here as well.
1982;This is one of those wonderful works of science fiction: it both stretches the imagination and reflects the time in which it was made.
1983;The survivors are served by a fantastic robot, Robby, one the original scifi creations that I remember as a child, who is far beyond the science of man to create.
1984;The solution to all the mysteries come together in a wonderfully unforeseen conclusion, which surprises as well as reflects the then.
1985;popular Freudian psychanalysis of the time.
1986;It is simply brilliant, both in its themes and its technical execution.
1987;This story will live in my imagination for my entire life.
1988;It is still worth seeing.
1989;enough said!The movie that inspired Star Trek!I would have loved to see a photo of the Krell.
1990;This is a great movie for 1956.
1991;It still holds up rather well to today's movies even tho it lacks the effects of today's stuff.
1992;I always enjoy this movie no matter how many times I have seen it.
1993;If you like classing Science Fiction movies this is a must see.
1994;This classic science fiction movie is well before its time in its visual effects and music to match its futuristic view of a planet that was the home of an alien race that had one fatal flaw before it vanished.
1995;One of the best sifi films ever made.
1996;In spite of being over 50 years old, it can hold its own against most modern sifi movies.
1997;In fact tmany of hese elements reminds me of Star Trek.
1998;i'm a big Robby the Robot fan so I love this film.
1999;It's a great film for '58.
2000;also I'd like to add .
2001;There are big difference between the two robots.
2002;the sets, the special effects, the soundtrack, the story, the cast ( Anne Francis is purr.
2003;As is well known, this is a Sci.
2004;although not working with an especially large budget, the makers of the film combined a good story with amazingly innovative set design and clever special effects to produce what is possibly the most satisfying film set in outer space film made during the 1950s.
2005;The shots of the interior of the former inhabitants' magnificent structures are some of the best model shots in film history.
2006;Even with today's special effects and CGI scripting, they are impressive.
2007;And Robby the Robot has to go down as one of the great screen robots of all time.
2008;Also among the all time greats, the invisible but nonetheless detectable monster from the ID is one of the most satisfying monsters one could imagine.
2009;part of the reason the movie works so well is the cast, which is a cut above average for a fifties Sci.
2010;Walter Pidgeon turns in the strongest performance in the film, as the brilliant Dr. Morbius.
2011;His voice alone makes many of the key scenes in the film work beautifully.
2012;Anne Francis is simply beautiful, and it doesn't take much imagination the effect she would have on a ship full of men who haven't seen a woman in several months.
2013;She manages to be incredibly sexy and completely innocent as successfully as any actress I have ever seen.
2014;one can overstress the Shakespeare and Freud connection, but this film does get my vote for the best use of psychology ever made in a Sci.
2015;It along with the extreme care given to every aspect of this film make it to this day one of the most durable Sci.
2016;Extras are great to look at and think of the way it was back then.
2017;This rates high among the classic's, not only suited for all ages but alsoleaves a good image and point the story tells.
2018;great movie at a great price hope to deal with again.
2019;woulg recommend this movie to everyone.
2020;As soon as I heard the electronic tonalities accompanying the opening credits, I knew this was going to be a great movie.
2021;it's often said that the script was based on Shakespeare's The Tempest, well maybe.
2022;But it was certainly a tightly written and logical story.
2023;the special effects were good for the time and still hold up OK today.
2024;Somehow I suspect that so much will have to be changed to fit in with today's ideals.
2025;I was certainly right about that!
2026;Great 1956 movie with Leslie Nielson and Anne Francis.
2027;Streaming, sound and color was perfect.
2028;He's one of a kind.
2029;Movie is worth the money.
2030;Theme is timeless and the acting is pretty good.
2031;But the old version will do for now!
2032;This is one of the best early sci fi movies made, especially considering the timing which was not long after a long string of films about killer tomatoes and monsters from planet x.
2033;Highly recommended for anyone who likes sci fi at all, or even just good entertainment.
2034;One of the first well done space Sci Fy movies using Disney for special effects coupled with a good story line and well know and seasoned actors many of the young actors went on to distingushed careers in both TV and Big Screen
2035;By today's standards probably kind of silly, but you must take it, in it's context.
2036;I recommend this as a great sci.
2037;very well re mastered
2038;When I was a boy this film was the drive in draw!
2039;Anne Francis was everything a beautiful heroine should be!
2040;Leslie Nelson who became a star again in The Naked Gun gives a good solid performance as the Captain.
2041;The film introduces the concept of hyperdrive as a means of traveling faster than light, and overall the story is thoughtful, and contains numerous twists that add zip to the story.
2042;this is a good science fiction movie when compared to many others from the 1950s.
2043;Before star wars you could count great space movies with one hand and have fingers left over
2044;fi movie of the 50`s and 60's to see how ingenious and original this was and how much care and attention was put into the making of it at a time when sci.
2045;In this day of CGI, and fast motion , sci.
2046;It was probably just a bad disk but as this is one of my favorite movies of all time I had to have a working copy.
2047;ray is great and I loved the extras on Robbie the Robot.
2048;This movie is a must see.
2049;The story is timeless based on the Tempest.
2050;I saw it several times at a downtown Columbus theatre that catered to kids and opened each summer season with this movie on a double feature with BLACKBOARD JUNGLE, another contemporary MGM blockbuster.
2051;today, it looks somewhat quaint, but is entertainingly nostalgic
2052;The special effects were great for '56, and the animated monster and futuristic score were really impressive.
2053;I offers a good good look at Leslie Neilsen before he was the goofball comic in his later years.
2054;enjoyed it and watched it over and over.
2055;This is one of the best sci.
2056;fi of all time, Spielberg wants to make again.
2057;This is one of just a few of my favorite SciFi movies.
2058;A classic tale with remarkable special effects, especially for the period it was produced.
2059;Just love this movie, at the time this was one best SiFi movie.
2060;The extras were very interesting .
2061;best to watch after watching the movie.
2062;ray was very, very good.
2063;disc transfer is fine, but to own a remastered version in 5.1 surround with all the special features is very tempting.
2064;Ranking along side pictures like: The Day the Earth Stood Still, (the original) War of the Worlds, (George Pal's) Time Machine, and the like.
2065;The story (based on Shakespeare's Tempest) is excellent, the acting is top notch, and the FXs hold up amazingly well.
2066;He may be the most enduring icon from the early sci.
2067;well, I suppose that's enough reminiscing.
2068;I've sold myself on this gem all over again.
2069;I was thrilled to finally own this sci.
2070;fi classic in the Blu.
2071;If you are a classic Science Fiction fan and don't already have Forbidden Planet, I highly recommend this one!
2072;Plus you get the nice collectors tin as well as the Small Toy Robbie!
2073;enjoyed seeing the movie again and in the new format with all the extras.
2074;The special effects were phenomenal for their day and the storyline actually has some social value.
2075;the film is enjoyable and a must add to your collection.
2076;Absolutely one of the best science.
2077;and one wonders really if any of its pseudo.
2078;One of the best early SciFi flicks.
2079;Good special effects for the time.
2080;love the robot and special efects,reminds me of Johhny Quest monsters.
2081;so this is a must for any collection
2082;Best looking copy I have ever seen!
2083;Anne Francis is stunning , and a very young Lesley Neilson star.
2084;It was fun watching the first real primo sci fi movie.
2085;this BD version was sharp and clear images with excellent sound.
2086;I haven't seen any other film from that time period that is as visually stunning and realistic.
2087;believable acting throughout the film, marred only by the stereotypical 50's style comic relief.
2088;It's one of the classics of Raygun Gothic.
2089;This is a classic sci fi flick .
2090;very cool set design,, many stars in this film.
2091;I love this movie as it was the first sci fi movie I saw which attracted me to science fiction
2092;Forbidden planet  is a very interesting science.
2093;A spaceship from the Earth arrives to his planet.
2094;As Shakespeare's play the film illustrates the perils of intellectual pride and isolation and that awful truth of  the dreams of rationalist minds provoke monsters .
2095;A concise direction
2096;effects and bizarre settings do of it one of the best scienci.
2097;it was in great condition My brothers b day present.
2098;he loved it and had been looking for it
2099;This is the best science fiction film of all time.
2100;its as much a showcase for 1950s culture as it is a scifi movie.
2101;The giant underground architecture of the Krell is fantastic!!
2102;You WILL watch it more than once, guaranteed.
2103;Very unique and imaginative for that time and even for now.
2104;The fact that one of the stars was one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen did not hurt.
2105;This is classic 1950's science fiction at its best.
2106;leslie Nielson, Walter Pigeon and Anne Francis put in great performances.
2107;Seeing a much younger Leslie Nielson in a more serious role is refreshing.
2108;world and really makes the movie.
2109;After you've seen the movie, check it out and you'll see what I mean.
2110;the story was fun, though definitely dated.
2111;If you enjoy old science fiction, then this is a good movie for you.
2112;This is a fun, entertaining movie from the 50'.
2113;this is a classic science fiction movie that I could easily watch again (several times).
2114;Truly a beautiful picture
2115;Expected B. list funny sci.
2116;fi, turned out to be very clever and well done especially for it's time!
2117;Good effects for its time.
2118;My daughters, 8 and 12, who have seen all the recent sci stuff still thought that this was pretty cool.
2119;living actors seen in the Amazing documentary?
2120;second: The main documentary, Amazing!
2121;This is Oscar Goldman, for cryin' out loud!
2122;sure, it's neat to have the film included, but that's purely a novelty at this point.
2123;all in all, it's still nice to have ANY kind of Special Edition of FORBIDDEN PLANET in your collection, and the packaging that comes with the tin case is suitably retro, colorful and fun to look at, but this new release could have been SO MUCH more.
2124;anyway the Blu Ray edition is great!
2125;The transfer is spectacular, it's almost like seeing for the first time.
2126;The special features are very good, even though a cherished 'myth' is shattered (I won't give it away.
2127;all in all I highly recommend the Blu Ray editon.
2128;This 1956 science fiction film is a known classic.
2129;But there is a malevolent presence on the planet, both mysterious and invisible.
2130;It boasts the first ever all.
2131;electronic score, that certainly adds to the eerie ambiance and adds suspense.
2132;It was a lot of fun to spot what possible inspiration spawned other favorite scifi technology, such as the Star Trek transporter beams.
2133;This classic is a must.
2134;see for science fiction fans, as it helped pave the way for future scifi.
2135;fi effects came from, watch this movie.
2136;It is a little slow sometimes, but the plot is very good.
2137;He is welcomed by the professor.
2138;for its best to watch for yourself .
2139;just know that this is a superb entry into the realm of Sci.
2140;FORBIDDEN PLANET offers the viewer an exceptionally intelligent script, fine direction and excellent acting by the entire cast who are threatened by a strange being on an exotic planet.
2141;for its day, the technical achievements for the film were astounding.
2142;The eerie musical score, the atmosphere, even the odd Eastmancolor all add to the film's immense enjoyment.
2143;The film is essentially (and rather ingeniously) a futuristic variation/fantasia on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST: an undeniably brilliant excursion into outer space and the inner mind.
2144;If anything it is better!
2145;This is a true treasure.
2146;i had heard Steve talk about this movie for years and went back and looked at it and indeed its one of the true classics along side the likes of The Wizard Of Oz,plus its a chance to see Leslie Nielson be a real serious actor.
2147;well Steve I,am glad you will finally get to see This Great Film your all time great pick and see it like it was meant to be seen on fabulous Blu Ray.
2148;Great special effects for its time.
2149;Originally filmed on giant sets this cult classic is again from when I was a kid watching it in B&W.
2150;I have seen this movie several times and I believe that it is one of the most well thought out and delivered sci.
2151;this film combines an intelligent story with lavish production and special effects.
2152;The answers, when they come, are logical and satisfying, and a second viewing will show that fair clues were offered all along.
2153;The film offers much for the eye as well (be sure to get the widescreen version): wide.
2154;open landscapes with green twilit skies, a sleek flying saucer of a starship, alien forests of otherwordly trees, Dr. Morbius's elegant villa (where I want to live when I grow up), Ann Francis's short skirts, and a huge, enigmatic, alien machine.
2155;Don't come expecting an adrenaline rush, fist fights, dismemberments, or explosions
2156;The electronic score is also decades ahead of its time.
2157;Violet DawnForbidden Planet is one of those unforgettable movies that remains with you for rest of your life.
2158;I loved this movie as a child, and I still love it today.
2159;A film I remember watching back in my teen years.
2160;A very well made film, good clean entertainment.
2161;As a collector of old movies, this is one I have wanted for a long time.
2162;Thank you for the movies I have gotten through you and thank you for being on the look.
2163;Forbidden Worlds is a classic Sci.
2164;The best thing about Forbidden Planet is the concept of the power of Freud's 'Id'.
2165;still the top of the genre, Alien and Star Trek II the Wrath of Khan.
2166;The best films of aliens or futuristic creations combined with earth settings, like Blade Runner, Solaris, Terminators 1&2, Starman, Dark City, or even the inner space of Tron from more contemporary times have a far more sophisticated resonance for repeated viewings.
2167;The best classic sci fi movie many wonderful actors and future movie built off it I love the background sets
2168;This is one of the greatest science fiction films ever made.
2169;Its even more remarkable for being over 50 years old now, as some of the special effects, if dated now, are good enough to make you think 'how the hell did they do that in 1956'?
2170;With an extremely intriguing plot.
2171;Excellent special effects for the period.
2172;for example, compare the original The Day the Earth stood still with its remake.
2173;I remember watching this movie on Saturday afternoon when I was growing up.
2174;This movie is a classic.
2175;It is one of the best sci.
2176;you will see many recognizable faces in the cast (if you are 40 years or older).
2177;it won awards for special effects and it introduces Robby the Robot.
2178;it is a great movie.
2179;I have 4 favorite sci.
2180;Forbidden Planet is one of my favorite movies.
2181;A B movie at its best.
2182;Colors and actopr commentary are neat look into the making of the movie.
2183;lesley Neilsen NOT in a funny role.
2184;holds up extremely well over time.
2185;the special effects were amazing at the time and still bring wonder.
2186;It's notable that there are many distinguishing factors to this movie: The spaceship is completely manmade, you never see 1 inch of Earth or anywhere from our native solar system, and there is no musical score.
2187;I found this to mold perfectly with the atmosphere of the movie.
2188;encompassing as When Worlds Collide, it was fascinating to see Leslie Nielson in this role, as he pulls it of famously.
2189;camp and greatly adds to the overall feel and mood of the movie.
2190;floor megalopolis
2191;all put together, Forbidden Planet delivers a solid sci.
2192;The information reveals and action sequences pace the movie wonderfully, with an ultimate revelation that is first.
2193;Be sure to drop in and see the wonders of the Forbidden Planet!
2194;Realized by many as the greatest sci.
2195;fi film of all time, Forbidden Planet comes in an amazing set.
2196;It has a ton of great bonus features like great documentaries, a wonderful show about the creation of the most iconic robot in history, Robby, and an episode of an old tv show in which Robby was the star.
2197;Forbidden Planet has never looked so good !
2198;The colours are incredibly vivid and the sound is amazing.
2199;fi sound effects are here, and are at there best here as well.
2200;Probably the best extra is the small, greatly detailed, Robby The Robot figurine that comes with the set.
2201;This is as good as it will ever be !
2202;One of the best sicfi movies of it's time.
2203;a must see for if you are into movies with great imagination.
2204;Oscar winner for special effects.
2205;Some movies made much later were not half as good.
2206;for a 50s scifi this is and will always be a great classic,a must for any serious collector like me,perfect story telling,the special effects are great for the time a must see picture
2207;Very well done for a 1956 period movie.
2208;Very good special effects also for that time period.
2209;Like all good film science fiction, Forbidden Planet keeps its concepts simple but their ramifications grand, which is just one of the reasons it is a timeless classic.
2210;(Its delightful production design is a seamless mix of colors, forms, and shapes familiar from those imaginative magazine covers.)
2211;Beyond great special effects and an innovative musical score, the film also engages a firm.
2212;was very worth the price and the wait.
2213;I would recommend this to all syfi buffs.
2214;All I can say a classic movie.
2215;Mystery, Romance, Science Fiction all wrapped into one, while special effects are top rate with no flaws.
2216;It is one of my favorite Sci Fi movies of all time.
2217;This remastered transfer of the film is breathtaking in it's clarity, detail, richness of color and sound.
2218;it is the best transfer of the film I have ever seen and gives one a glimpse of a film that must have been astonishing to see on the big screen in it's day.
2219;even by today's CG standards of special effects this film delivers.
2220;In fact it surpasses CG effects because it has a uniqueness and beauty that CG has not yet been able to capture.
2221;the beautiful matte paintings of the planet and Krell machine works are truly awe inspiring.
2222;The acting is very good and the most important thing of all, the story, is truly riveting and instructive in it's scope and moral lesson.
2223;i recommend all people see this film.
2224;This collector set has many extras including a cool little Robby the robot toy.
2225;What a truly remarkable film this is.
2226;Great science fiction films like Forbidden Planet don't just give a couple of hours of entertainment, but make us think deep thoughts.
2227;Two thousand years ago a unique man walked the earth, he spoke remarkable words and did brave things that lead up to his death but never backed down from what he said.
2228;But what God regards as evil intents and thoughts, man regards as natural and normal.
2229;thanks Forbidden Planet you have taught me a lot about myself.
2230;Though it can't help but show its age, it does so much more gracefully than most sci fi films of the 1950's.
2231;No, this one has an intelligent plot and excellent (for the time) special effects.
2232;the restoration of the film is excellent.
2233;disc version has a nice package of extras including THE INVISIBLE BOY, a pleasant, if unassuming movie featuring Robby the Robot.
2234;fi movie with a fascinating story about an advanced culture on an exo.
2235;time favorites of any genre.
2236;This movie and others of the same genre were such a part of my childhood I just love revisiting them and sharing with friends.
2237;FORBIDDEN PLANET is an eminently watchable flick in its own right and one of the essential science.
2238;There are others we love (I myself have a great and abiding fondness for I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE, and some folks swear by WAR OF THE WORLDS), but these five, though they did not exhaust the genre (as Hollywood understood the genre), certainly defined it during their decade and well into the 1960s, until 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.
2239;This film still represents the pinnacle of modern scifi.
2240;Intelligent and unsurpassed in its scope and imagination.
2241;Robby the Robot steals the show in this top.
2242;Superb special effects that STILL hold up 50 years later!FORBIDDEN PLANET(1957) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY(1968) are head and shoulders above all other Science Fiction movies.
2243;the Theremin music is super eerie, and very well done.
2244;The special effects, for the 1950's time period, are stunning.
2245;They still hold up pretty well by even today's standards.
2246;Great story line and the drama/suspense is well developed.
2247;Walter Pidgeion nails his role to perfection!
2248;I remember seeing this movie as a little boy.
2249;I view this movie and the 1953 release of War of the Worlds as true landmarks in the science fiction genre of movies.
2250;There has been talk for many years of Hollywood doing a remake.
2251;If it is remade, they will need to bring their A game, because the original still holds up very well.
2252;When the Monster from the Id materialized, I jumped behind the seat, but still managed to be captivated.
2253;50 years later, the movie is no less riveting and entertaining.
2254;fi classic helped inspire Star Trek, Star Wars and countless other film and TV titles.
2255;The bonus features tell the behind.
2256;scenes story with appropriate tributes to that lovable guy Robbie, the rest of the cast (Leslie Nielsen was so much older then), the pioneering electronic music, the cutting edge effects, and other details of the production process.
2257;There were a few classic sci fi movies from the 50's and this is by all considerations one of them.
2258;A masterful reworking of the Tempest, this movie broke new ground with cinematography and futurism, made even more amazing by a comparison with todays computer generated animation.
2259;On all levels this movie is a work of genius, from the set design (incorporating art from modernist masters), to the sweeping landscaping backgrounds (reminiscent of the artwork for contemporary sci fi novels), to the robotics (the famous Robbie the Robot), all of this accompanied by the brilliant score and music by Louis and Bebe Barron (and the eerie and soulful use of the theramin).
2260;at its heart, a simple morality play, but with many layers of human aberrant psychological fears, greed and hubris, this is an event best viewed in widescreen Blu.
2261;This is its charm, as its general theme can be accessed and understood by a modern contemporary audience.
2262;From masterful acting by Leslie Neilsen acting as a romantic hero lead, and Anne Francis as the virginal innocent/provocateur whos innocence and humility finally sets the scene for the resolution of mans arrogance and conceit as portrayed by Walter Pidgeon, this is a ensemble cast.
2263;i would recommend this to any lover of the genre.
2264;The special effects, the electronic music, the intelligent concepts, the dynamic characters, it's a classic!
2265;And definitately way ahead of its time.
2266;This is a movie that I have loved since I first saw it as a child.
2267;Although it is old, the special effects for that time period were outstanding.
2268;This beloved and memorable film is great.
2269;This is a great movie, evidence, remastered and popular.
2270;this is an oldie but goodie, a good plot for sci fi and we all loved it, back in the day.
2271;The special effects, at the time this movie was made, are comparable to todays technical Sci Fi creations, just years ahead.
2272;Enjoy the story, special effects and art work.
2273;Anne Francis was one gorgeous woman!
2274;It's nice to see a classic film like this in such a fantastic presentation.
2275;Not only do you get 1 film and a wide array of informative special features, but you get a second feature film in the form of THE INVISIBLE BOY.
2276;I don't know about you but this is one of the most enjoyable sci.
2277;fi movies of all time, get it with some hot popcorn and a soft drink and have forbidden fun with a great classical film.
2278;I am shocked that this movie was made in the 1960's and looked so amazing.
2279;Truly a classic science fiction.
2280;The effects were great for its time.
2281;the Video portion is just fine.
2282;Robbie is the star of this pic,hands down!
2283;this is in the days of cratoonish movies and many classics started to be made at this time like,THEM!
2284;fi classic is there ever was one.
2285;Great effects, especially for it's day, and a well done and interesting story line.
2286;Robbie the Robot was cool too.
2287;The special effects are very good (considering 1950's), exception Id monster, looks like childish animation.
2288;Great to see this movie in Blu.
2289;ray and on big screen TV.
2290;Good special effects for the time this movie was made.
2291;M. g. m was determined to show that when money was no longer an object a Space Movie could be done with intelligence and the highest production values possible at the time.
2292;This movie also made a star of Robby the Robot, and to this day he remains a cherished icon of the Golden Age of Sci.
2293;Forbidden Planet looks amazing on Blu.
2294;ray, and I recommend that if possible you see this on the biggest Flat Panel screen available, for maximum effect!
2295;Neilson before he began being a comic icon is very good as the ships captaon, but the movie is stolen an belongs to Robbie the Robot
2296;Forbidden Planet is one of the all time best sci.
2297;Beautiful graphics, wonderful music, good acting and in intelligent plot make this a classic all sci.
2298;i truly love the movie considering it is the second time i ever seen it .
2299;There are certain classic Sci.
2300;fi movies that I truly enjoy and Forbidden Planet is one of them.
2301;the plot is original and though the acting is a bit campy ( well more than a bit), it is a good story.
2302;Now, I can just enjoy the show.
2303;I have loved Forbidden Planet ever since seeing it as a kid years ago.
2304;I was excited to see it in the Blu.
2305;The film looks spectacular, and the special effects .
2306;robby the Robot, of course, came away from this film a huge star, and it's fun to see him again.
2307;this was well before his days as a comedy star in such films as Airplane!)
2308;Included in this release is the feature film, The Invisible Boy, a follow.
2309;budget epic, filmed in color, was MGM's first venture into the then emerging popularity of science fiction.
2310;This and War of the Worlds are the most famous and best color sci.
2311;It's great to see companies reviving marvellous classics like Forbidden Planet.
2312;it is arguably one of the best sci.
2313;Starring Leslie Neilson, Walter Pidgeon and Anne Francis, it makes for compelling viewing especially if you have the 50th anniversary two disc edition, where you have numerous features to explore.
2314;It still stacks up as a masterpiece, even in the twenty first century.
2315;Well worth a look if you are a movie classics or science fiction fan.
2316;It's been more than twenty years since I've seen this movie and the remake is absolutely awesome.
2317;I watched the film with my 10 year old grandson and he said the film was great.
2318;The color and graphics were great and the audio was very good.
2319;eminent work of 1950s science fantasy.
2320;It is not by any stretch of the imagination hard science fiction, but it is a thoughtful and intelligent offering in its own way.
2321;for those who haven't yet seen Forbidden Planet, I'd say first and foremost that this is a wonderful film that works perfectly well on the level of a straightforward adventure that a 10 year old could enjoy.
2322;one thing I do want to add before moving on is that this movie is well worth seeing just for the set design alone.
2323;okay then: so much for the film.
2324;Well, I'm happy to say it's awesome!
2325;But if you have any interest at all in classic science fiction, this is a film that you MUST see.
2326;I'm so happy I bought this movie, and the price was reasonable too.
2327;A classic that I've enjoyed from my youth.
2328;It is great to seeit again and to share with friends.
2329;I'm a huge science fiction fan.
2330;filmed in Cinemascope.,the color is great and so is the sound.
2331;The special effects for 1950ish movies was spectacular but of secondary importance.
2332;This movie won awards mainly because of INMO superb acting by all 3 main actors/actress and a fantastic plot.
2333;we also see a talking super strong robot called Robbie that was created by Morpheus after taking the brain boost.
2334;the beast is smashing into the home through steel plate and melts super strong Krell metal because of the unlimited power of the machine.
2335;lots of great action, a superb plot, and great special effects for a 1950ish movie.
2336;Robbie helps the boy Timmy become invisible and both go on a rocket to orbit the earth.
2337;The main big computer (who gains control of Robbie the robot) has developed self awareness and wants to take over the Earth and either enslave humankind or destroy them.
2338;If you like out of this world adventure, this space movie loosely based on Shakespeare's The Tempest is top notch.
2339;Walter Pigeon is most believable as the villain.
2340;Don't know which is better The Day The Earth Stood Still or Forbidden Planet!Forbidden Planet special effect,electronic music score,and wide screen give it the edge!
2341;fi afer watching the best!
2342;this film is a monumental achievement in cinema Science Fiction .
2343;you were starting from the best possible material.
2344;breakingly bold and as genre.
2345;OK, this movied is a favorite.
2346;It's a fun set though.
2347;Leslie Nielsen in an early dramatic role .
2348;The extra items included with the collection are priceless to me and the deleated and outtake scenes are a must see for real sci.
2349;It's a sci fi classic for a reason.
2350;It has a rich story line, particularly for the time when Fordbidden Planet came out.
2351;If the characters aren't fully three dimensional, they are interesting and principled.
2352;The backdrop of the story is rich.
2353;Set in the far future, the story assumes a huge, peacefull interstellar human civilization, with lots of interesting technology, used matter.
2354;The whole thing is an elaborate morality.
2355;the movie has held up well over the decades and is worth watching for any of the reasons above, or simply if you want to see Leslie Nielson back when he played dramatic roles (he was a very credible leading man in this one!)
2356;Just like the name says the look and sound of perfect.
2357;Great movie movie for the whole family.
2358;The special effects on this film were groundbreaking for their day and are very good even for today.
2359;I did not care for this movie, but my Dad loved it.
2360;Nice digitized update of a quintessential 1950's sci.
2361;I proudly display my Collectors Edition of Forbidden Planet I would definitely recommend this Edition to any and all Serious Collectors.
2362;The remastering of this film was excellent.
2363;It was a very good movie then as still is a sci.
2364;One of my all time favorite science fiction films and will watch it at the drop of a hat should it be on TCM or if I feel the need to watch it on a rainy day.
2365;Great plot, excellant special effects, super cast.
2366;all of which make it one of the most entertaining movies ever.
2367;this is great and i love some of these old syfy with robbie the robot and how they made these movie a neat for there time
2368;One of the best sci.
2369;A must see for everyone.
2370;This movie,for all its years,still stands out as a genuine classic which has been copied many times, but never equalled.
2371;scenes feature was as interesting as the movie itself.
2372;in fact it makes the movie more enjoyable.
2373;inch model of Robby the Robot which makes it a super package.
2374;For those interested in cinema history, For its day it set a standard for characterization and special effects.
2375;It legitimized sci fi movies as legitimate entertainment.
2376;the 1950s known as the atomic age led to successful series of SC.
2377;fI film before the Star Wars Era, Brilliant, A SC.
2378;fI film ahead of it's time, a masterpiece, See Forbidden Planet AMAZING!
2379;As far as the movie goes, I liked it very much.
2380;the dark void of space was crisp and vivid and Anne Francis' marvelous short dresses dazzle with color.
2381;colored suit as she started to emerge from the pond.
2382;I'll admit that I'm a young girl who loves sci.
2383;fi which is incredibly rare in my demographic.
2384;I've seen War of the Worlds (the original is the best), Logan's Run, Blade Runner, Star Wars, Star Trek, The X. files, Independence Day, Armageddon, I Robot (which is excellent), Cowboys and Aliens, and both V TV series.
2385;please realize I saw Star wars just a couple of years earlier in one of only three times my father ever took us to a drive inn movie, .
2386;and it was still cool with Robbie, the animated monster, and other worldly sound track.
2387;The extras on this are worth the price of admission.
2388;The first big budget Science Fiction movie, and one of the best.
2389;For years I wanted to watch this movie based on the clips I'd seen of it.
2390;Great plot and special effects for a movie from 1956.
2391;The acting is campy in parts, the special effects for the time are spectacular.
2392;described by others, but it may be worth mentioning that this film (and very few others, like When Worlds Collide and War of The Worlds represented the motion picture use of the BEST OF Science Fiction Illustrative Art.
2393;By employing fantasic background illustrations with high.
2394;painting, this film is the best at designing a believable futurama from it's generation.
2395;photographic, imaginary subjects like the Id monster required classical hand.
2396;Her sexploitation in this film ironically helped her become one of the first female action sheros on television nine years later in her gound.
2397;The Special Features included with this release are great.
2398;Illustration is the best manifestation of human creative thought and this film may have been the best of it's class.
2399;The acting was very good, the script tight and the action gripping.
2400;fi thriller that goes from heart.
2401;The action sequence when the creature is trying to get through the forcefield is one of the best for suspense, horror and effects that I have ever seen.
2402;The graphic art and matting is outstanding.
2403;And the excellent sound effects!
2404;The most professionally done sci.
2405;If you have a wide screen TV, you definitely need to get this and watch the whole movie.
2406;Now it brings back great memories.
2407;i would recommend this and the Blob, Them , and the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms to anyone with open minds for adventure and child like eyes.
2408;My whole family was amazed.
2409;A great classic on Blu.
2410;Packaged well and played great with no complaints.
2411;An excellent collection in the Captain Kirk library.
2412;This one came up in a discussion on sci.
2413;The restored color is vibrant and fresh.
2414;It is very corny but really fun and it did have some effects that were definately ahead of their time.
2415;and come on, this is the introduction of Robby The Robot!
2416;I would love to see this re.
2417;I've always thought the vibrant colors in this movie were awesome.
2418;Great sci Fi Classic so break out the popcorn sitback and enjoy
2419;I'm always watching films like this from a designer's standpoint (and as entertainment too, of course!)
2420;and honestly the more I see this thing the more it wows me.
2421;face design work done in sci.
2422;I'd say these days we're just better at filling a screen, replacing stimulating content with, well, just stimulation.
2423;Giger's work is certainly creepy (bones and spines always are in the near.
2424;immense underground works that defy analysis.
2425;Better than the Princess Leia bit in the original Star Wars.
2426;Pay close attention to everything about Robbie
2427;Everything about his design and function is stunning.
2428;This is the highest level of imaginative deign work and it's in a fifty year old movie.
2429;i'm in awe of nearly every detail in this flick and I always find more with each viewing.
2430;so that's a promo to watch it for the visuals.
2431;Otherwise it's a fun story that really vibes on WWII vintage guy culture and that's great fun too.
2432;Walter Pidgeon is wonderful as Morbius and it's fascinating how he breaks with film dialogue tradition of that time (and even now) and ums and ahs his way through his lines.
2433;It makes his somewhat pompous character human and infinitely more believable.
2434;He brought a lot of depth to a great role.
2435;there was more creativity evident in last season's Hallmark Card line.
2436;Very well put together for the technology of this era.
2437;This is a great old Si Fi flick.
2438;Funny to see the old actors being dramatic.
2439;Grew up with wholesome sci.
2440;always good to revisit classics and compare to today's high tech productions.
2441;The widescreen, letterboxed format coupled with your best sound system for the awesome all.
2442;Its worth watching just for the art direction .
2443;so far above the norm for the era.
2444;The transfer is crisp and full.
2445;I love this movie, and the copy I ordered just arrived from Amazon.
2446;In other words, it just opened right up.
2447;Forbidden Planet is a classic of science fiction.
2448;By todays standards the visual effects are antiquated but this movie was made over 50 years ago and with that in mind, the special effects are special.
2449;Also a great story of man's intrinsically evil inner self.
2450;And never played this movie.
2451;I was so pleased to see this old movie looking so damn good.
2452;I got a good price.
2453;I went with my best friend while we were in highschool.
2454;This science fiction movie is one of the top five made in the 1950's and is even superior to the original War of the Worlds made in the 1950's.
2455;The story is truly a superior work as the events portrayed are possible in theory.
2456;And of course, the resolution is vastly better.
2457;Great effects for the time it was made and the color on blue ray is very good.
2458;Of course Leslie Nielsen is his serious self and progressed into a fantastic comedic actor.
2459;the space shots of the ship are incredible with each star visible.
2460;the planet surface backdrops are finely detailed and quite realistic.
2461;morbius's home is finished in fine granites and woods.
2462;There is a discussion of the Blu.
2463;influential motion pictures, Forbidden Planet would be right up there with Birth of a Nation, Citizen Kane, and Psycho.
2464;Its influence on popular science.
2465;fiction film (it wasn't), nor that it was the first good science.
2466;fiction film (The Day the Earth Stood Still and Things to Come come to mind), but rather the lavishness of the production and the unbridled imagination behind it.
2467;Forbidden Planet catches the viewer right from the start, with a nifty flying saucer and the greatest robot in movie history, in just the first 15 minutes.
2468;(Forbidden Planet owes a great deal to written science.
2469;fiction, and little to comic strips or previous films.)
2470;effects extravaganza we expect modern science.
2471;stellar acting (Walter Pidgeon is the only A. list actor).
2472;His Robby deftly alternates among ironic/sarcastic {It promotes rust.)
2473;Fred McLeod Wilcox's direction has the depth of tissue paper and the subtlety of a steam roller, though its general briskness helps a film that's more talk than action.
2474;Leslie Nielsen's delivery of the final line, in which he not only butchers the line, but practically swallows it, is wholly Wilcox's fault.
2475;sharp as one might like.
2476;This is unavoidable, the price one pays for the rest of the film looking so good.
2477;These include the sequel, The Invisible Boy, an episode of the The Thin Man (which has a political twist surprising for its era), and several good making of featurettes.
2478;fi movies that I really enjoyed.
2479;A science fiction classic ahead of it's time.
2480;remember seeing it when it first came out.
2481;Although today manifesting the Freudian concept of the Id as a monster has lost a lot of appeal, but in the psychology obsessed fifties it was considered very cerebral.
2482;Sort of a Science fiction spin on Beowulf .
2483;I'm saving it for New Years Eve, and I'm looking forward to the Blu.
2484;To say that Forbidden Planet is one of the best, timeless classics of Sci.
2485;This is clearly the inspiration behind many of today's movies and television shows, and when one watches this great movie, it's not difficult to see why.
2486;With the characters, the setting, the romance, the special effects and the psychological over.
2487;tones of this film, this is clearly a movie that is well worth watching over and over and over!
2488;This is a science fiction movie with an actual plot/story line, good acting, and a real moral message!Throw in Robby the robot and you just can't loose!
2489;fiction films ever made, and my personal favorite.
2490;It captures the film's original brilliance with crystal.
2491;Offering both Widescreen AND Pan Scan (which extremelly diminishes the beautiful cinematography) as well as both English and French versions [NOTE: watching the French version with English subtitles can increase the viewer's feelings of superiority and overall pretentiousness.]
2492;Love this movie from the past.
2493;Very well done for the year it was created.
2494;ray package for one main reason.
2495;the entire movie soundtrack played out through my center speaker ONLY!
2496;This is a great Sci.
2497;fi classic that looks even better on Blu.
2498;To top it off, there are a lot of informative and interesting extras on the disc.
2499;There were science fiction movies before this (although aside from The Day the Earth Stood Still they were pretty mediocre), but this one is special.
2500;It is mentioned a couple of times, but that's as close as it gets.
2501;provoking premise brought up to date with grace and style.
2502;screen presentation is necessary to appreciate the movie's grandeur.
2503;In the sequel, the sky on the new planet contains a species of algae that produce hydrogen in a sac that allows them to float in the air.)
2504;This movie has been one of my favorites since I was a kid.
2505;fi flick this is a must to have.
2506;The special effects are great and the story and acting are top notch for a Science Fiction movie of this era.
2507;I've seen it three more times since then and here's what strikes me:For one, although Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is undeniably great, practically every primary aspect of Trek is present in Forbidden Planet, which was released almost a decade before the first Star Trek pilot episode was produced (!)
2508;sexy outfits, beam down/up (in a visual sense, at least), etc., it's all here in Forbidden Planet.
2509;The invisible id monster is truly horrifying when finally viewed.
2510;furthermore, Dr. Morbius' elaboration on the former inhabitants of his planet, the Krell, is fascinating to this day and the archaic special effects hold up well.
2511;in utter awe of her jaw.
2512;she was obviously playing a little coquettish joke on the Captain, to shock him and stir up his mounting desire (it absolutely worked!)
2513;Even dated it is a good movie.
2514;This is a great movie.
2515;The special features were interesting.
2516;I now have a very nice man cave with all the latest High Definition equipment.
2517;Then and now I love this movie.
2518;The story line is believable and the acting was well done.
2519;The creature in the laser beams when it attacks the ship is really cool.
2520;As it roared and bellowed!
2521;fi movies then this is a must see.
2522;it brought back a lot of fond memories of dear ole dad!
2523;Forbidden Planet is still fresh and entertaining after all these years.
2524;It was so well done that whatever may seem dated is very charming.
2525;the humor still holds up, and aside from a slightly silly looking space ship, the special effects were great.
2526;this movie is a classic worthy of any collector of great movies, shelf.
2527;fi franchises of all time (and two of my faves) is definitely worth a viewing!After growing up watching `Airplane!'
2528;I remember two particular scenes.
2529;Not only is it simply good entertainment, it works hard at integrating the genre.
2530;specific with broader movie qualities, and thus stands tall and proud in the genre.
2531;they're not, and they're often quite good.
2532;You'll recognize a number of things copied by later movies (even the later movies' wow scenes), which will ratify the legitimacy of the old stuff in comparison to the new, which so often gets a free pass based on its high.
2533;i'm a super scifi fan and I love this movie it has some of this bests effects for when it was made.
2534;It was a really old movie then but will always be a classic.
2535;It's the type of scary which leaves a lot to the imagination which makes it all the more frightening.
2536;It's about a crew of men in space who's ship gets stranded on a planet inhabited by a man, Morbius and his beautiful daughter Alterra.
2537;The planet was once home to a race known as the Krell who dissapeared and left behind their mysterious brain enhancing technology.
2538;My favorite part is when the 'monster' melts through the solid metal door and all the alarms are going off, talk about suspense!
2539;It's not a bloody or violent film compared to movies of today but it scares you on a much deeper level, proving that OUR MIND can be a greater enemy than any monster.
2540;It's a movie that is good for a wide range, both young and old and was made in a time when movies were smart and made you think and were more than just a money machine cranked out by greedy studios!
2541;This movie proves that no matter how far we evolve the nature of one's sub.
2542;Despite this unnecessary development of romance this movie has a great storyline with a fair amount of good acting.
2543;The film was nominated for Best Special Effects and you can see why.
2544;He's like a big metal genie granting every wish, much to the delight of James Dirocco, the cook.
2545;This is a great Saturday evening movie.
