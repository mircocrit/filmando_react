23;ray edition of this wonderful film.
24;I found myself with the remote in hand during the entire film so I could continually adjust, and then readjust, the volume, not exactly the best way to enjoy a work of art.
25;The remastered edition of this movie is flawless.
26;Half the time I found myself wandering mentally from the dialogue to focus on the picture itself.
27;The story itself is very good and the acting superb but I always find myself watching it again just to see cinematography.
28;Everything about this film is genius.
29;The acting is perfection Cotton is perfect as Harry Lime.

31;Valli is brilliant in her role as Anna Schmidt.
32;She is both distant and lonely for her departed lover and will always love the man she thought Lime was instead of the monster that he is.

35;And when welles slivers his hand through the grate your heart skips a beat.

40;The heat is on and so he needs alibis, and better a disappearance, staged or otherwise.
41;my expectations were pretty high since it has been named one of the greatest films of all time.
42;The story, the acting, the cinematography were flawless.
43;This film is visually stunning and should have been released in letterbox.
44;Carol Reed, Graham Greene and (as an actor only) Orson Welles are damn near at the peak of their talents in this stunning work.
45;If your only memories are of a faded video or 16mm print version, this will take your breath away.
46;The Third Man, a thriller set in post.
47;world War II Vienna, has been lauded as one of the best movies of all time, and Orson Welles's performance in the movie, which is largely confined to the last 15 minutes, is certainly great.
48;Watching the movie more than a half century after it was produced, it seemed well.
49;what I really liked about the movie was its story and the moral choice it presented.
50;the contrast in the way that these two characters respond to the friend is what gives the movie its power, and Wells plays the friend to perfection .
51;portraying a person who could produce such strong attachments and yet be so despicable.
52;Harry Lime is so mysterious!
53;He's such an awesome character.
54;i bet that Welles loved playing this role.
55;This is a great film.
56;all Welles fans should watch it!
57;Carol Reed is a great director, too.
58;The 3 things which make this movie so great are.1st: The zither music.
59;i love the part when Anna says about her anti.
60;and then the light shines on Welles' face.
61;That is a classic scene.
62;it's so great.3rd: the plot.
63;The whole sewers scene is wonderful.
64;watch this movie first, to gte warmed up to him.
65;These guys should look at 'Criterion Collection' how to present a movie properly.5 stars for the movie itself, not that many for the 'Studio Canal' product.
66;i'm only now starting to venture into the classics of film, but with movies like The Third Man by my side, I am fully assured I will have a thoroughly pleasant experience.
67;This movie, starting from its cheery introductory tune, completely broke those expectations.
68;I was never keen on detective stories, much less allowed myself to be absorbed by them, but this was simply an intriguing movie from the very onset.
69;time friend is worth five stars in its own respect.
70;Two things transform The Third Man from just a great movie to the greatest.
71;The incongruity is perfect counter.
72;the second is a scene in a Ferris Wheel, full of under.
73;and he imbues the movie with such charismatic danger, despite being in only a few scenes.
74;Which brings us back to the Ferris Wheel: his speech connecting the Borgias and cuckoo clocks is itself worth the time invested in this film.
75;experience The Third Man today!
76;When I first saw `Citizen Kane' I was completely smitten with Orson Welles and his brilliant performance.
77;"The other night I picked up this classic film for the mere fact that Welles was in it, and what I found was one of the tightest film noirs I've ever seen
78;writer Graham Greene and director Carol Reed have crafted a marvelous film noir in `The Third Man', a film that is so superbly constructed it will never leave your mind.
79;Reed's effective use of lighting and sound is marvelous, and the rich black and white just elevates the mood of the film.
80;That zither score is unique and, while at first I didn't think it would work, ultimately it proves to be one of the films greatest facets.
81;the film instantly draws you in to the characters that their situation and manages to keep you guessing and ripe with anticipation as you uncover, along with Holly, the tragic truths behind Lime's fate.
82;aiding Reed and Graham are the entire cast, Joseph Cotton stepping into the lead role of Holly Martins, and doing a fabulous job at that.
83;Cotton gives Holly a real sense of spark and determination, proving to the audience the importance within his motivations.
84;As the film spirals towards its dramatic closing we see the layers stripped away from Holly and are allowed to see his humanity battling itself, which is something I always love to see plaguing my actors.
85;Alida Valli is drop dead gorgeous as Anna, but she is far more than just window dressing.
86;She captures the struggle of a woman in love who cannot bear to accept all that her lover really was.
87;The single shot of her teary eyes is probably my single favorite scene in the film"
88;Trevor Howard also turns in a grand performance as Major Calloway, a man that is easy to dislike yet the only one you can truly trust.
89;He understands the true meaning of a supporting role, allowing Cotton to shine brightest yet never allowing his own character to suffer because of it.
90;handedly steals this entire film with a mere ten minutes or so of screen time.
91;When we first see him standing in the shadows (one of the greatest cinematic entrances of all time) we are intrigued, but when his character finally meets Holly face to face we are presented with Welles undeniable presence and ability.
92;He acts circles around Cotton and delivers a superb, undeniable performance that becomes the highlight of the film.
93;He is unforgettable in every sense of the word.
94;The classic use of shadows throughout creates a vibe of uneasiness that elevates the drama and helps instill in the audience a mystery that is slowly unfolding before them.
95;When you add to this the immaculate script and the sublime performances you have a film that is not soon forgotten.
96;I saw this movie for the legend that is Orson Welles, but I kept watching because of everything else that so perfectly creates a marvelous cinematic experience.
97;There are few movies that come along like this one, movies that cannot be improved upon.
98;The package of The Third Man with extras from the Criterion collection is a superior product.
99;The extra disc with British and Austrian notes on the making of the film with actual cast members and production crew is a must for the serious film historian or student.
100;One extra bit includes subtitles to translate some of the scenes with the porter and the landlady that were not translated (for artistic purposes) but are nice to have for people who don't speak German.
101;The history notes of actual life in Vienna at the time of the filming give the screenplay extra value in the complex mystery of who are the enemies and who are the criminals in this master work by Carol Reed.
102;The extra material also elucidates the care and determination the British took in keeping David O. Selznick from ruining the sensibility of an absolutelly top film for all time, not just post.
103;The Third Man is a work of art.
104;The black and white cinematography by Robert Krasker makes for beautiful, impressive and memorable images.
105;The music composed and played on zither by Anton Karas is even more impressive and memorable giving the movie an enchanting and even haunting effect.
106;also memorable and impressive are performances by Joseph cotten, Alida Valli, and Orson Welles.
107;This movie is a true classic.
108;You will want to watch it again and again.
109;"Lime is a classic sociopath, and yet the ""star"" of this Carol Reed picture?"
110;No, that honor must go to Mr. Cotten, who's in almost every scene and raises a fine movie to the level of a genuine classic.
111;original zither music by Anton Karas is unforgettable as is cinematography of war.
112;scarred Vienna, battered but still beautiful and at times forbidding.
113;Her unshakeable devotion to Harry defines blind love and makes this girl easiest to sympathize with.
114;Trevor Howard brings to his British major a perfect mix of business.
115;like military demeanor and well.
116;this noir classic well deserves its Top 100 Movie status.
117;The cast is well formed and everyone does their best, but the story isn't that engaging.
118;"on the plus side, it's quite well shot and directed with a realistic touch that sets it aside from a lot of films from that period and although the rumor that Welles had more to do with the direction than Reed did is false, Reed was certainly a ""student"" of Welles's technique."
119;"There is also some great dialogue in the film, including the ""cookoo clock"" monologue and Trevor Howard has some great ""irritated"" moments concerning his sir name, ""It's Calloway (not Callahan)."
120;I've just completed viewing Criterion's version of THe Third Man.
121;"For thier work in restoration, they deserve a 10
122;I still have vivid scenes of Vienna in my mind.
123;This was the first time I had ever seen this movie and I have to be brave and honest when I say that I am left with many conflicting feelings.
124;A good mystery, yes, but a thriller.
125;I NEVER felt a sense of danger or suspense throughout the movie.
126;I feel one of the main reasons for this is the wholly aweful and ever.
127;And as stated before, the camera work is visually breath.
128;minute feature documentary on the making of the film.
129;minute Austrian documentary featuring interviews with cast and crew.
130;Illustrated production history with rare behind.
131;scenes photos, original UK press book, and U. s. trailer.
132;This is my all time favorite movie.
133;To me, The Third Man is the greatest movie of all time.
134;now for the good news .
135;As I said, it is amazing that such a movie was made so way back in time.
136;Trevor Howard is very good too.
137;This is the quinessential thriller set in post.
138;war Vienna laden with love, deception murder.
139;Maybe not even a great deal of suspense because I could pretty much predict things along the way.
140;Just pretend that you're in the fourties and maybe you'll have a good time.
141;My hopes of maybe seeing technology in action in restoring an ailing print to a new found glory was shattered.
142;The audio and that unforgettable zither score is also very clearly captured.
143;I highly recommend this blu ray version for those who don't want to shell out the big bucks for the Criterion blu ray alternative.
144;Seems amazing that this is my first encounter with so famous a movie and/or book.
145;nation coalition of Americans, British, French and Russians, the Russians want to repatriate her, treating her as a member of the Soviet Union.
146;But that's fine"
147;I streamed this movie using Amazon's Instant Video.
148;All the actors are excellent and some of the scenes priceless.
149;This movie was riveting because of the story .
150;no special effects, no soaring soundtrack, just a really good story.
151;This is one of those films that everyone thought he/she saw.
152;Speaking about extras, one of the best extra is that of the abbreviated play being read voice.
153;When Holly arrives he finds he is late for Harry's funeral.
154;now it is up to Holly to clear Harry's name.
155;This movie is extremely entertaining and has great direction, one of the best and most famous scores in film history, superb acting, memorable dialogue and moody atmosphere, Orson Welles is in it too.
156;If you love movies this is a must.
157;The dialogue between Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten is memorable.
158;From a scale of 1.10 I give it a 10!
159;Probably the greatest location of political intrigue in the 20th Century was post.
160;The effect of having some characters speak in English and others speak in unsubtitled, untranslated German adds to the mystery.
161;The music adds to the drama.
162;"as a mystery filmed in black and white, ""The Third Man"" often finds itself on lists of films noir."
163;It is far better than the typical film noir, in that the cinematography is superior, and the plot is deeper (and not overly melodramatic).
164;it is definitely not what I expected.
165;This is well worth watching .
166;If you can only view or own a handful of film noir movies,this is the one you must have.
167;The story is now well.
168;shortened scenes, have been restored, adding to the enjoyment of this classic.
169;a fabulous film, now available in an equally fabulous version,and serious fans need to rush and get a copy of this newly restored version.
170;This edition presents a stunning digital restoration of perhaps century 20's most iconic and universal film.
171;The process was done painstakingly frame by frame as is demonstrated on one of the special features.
172;The result is a breathtaking, and the film should now be seen only in this version.
173;Briefly, the story is straightforward, deceptively simple, and morally and ethically bottomless.
174;investigator meets another on the trail: a British officer and criminal detective.
175;But director Carol Reed's vision and verve produced just that.
176;Of course, as is well known, every performance was by a major talent at top form .
177;And the script by the major British novelist Graham Greene has to rank as one of his unlikely but top life achievements.
178;Of course, there is a wonderful earthy gravity to the whole project, and viewers should approach it in that light and not as something with too many big words attatched to it.
179;You will have your own unique reaction and words after you experience it.
180;indeed half film noir, and with a gritty realism and a profound, but entirely unforced and unsentimental moral center.
181;After 50 years it retains the immediacy of something that happened just yesterday, nailed down by the last grand, silent take.
182;I was quite impressed with the blu.
183;The grain level varies throughout, sometimes becoming quite intense, almost overpowering, but that is part of the original film's elements, not because of the transfer.
184;Detail is quite excellent, revealing little details in people's clothing and hair, as well as all of the sets and locations.
185;The mono sound design is clean and clear, especially the dialogue.
186;One thing that is nice about the higher bitrate encode potential on blu.
187;This is definitely the best I've ever seen The Third Man look and sound, which made the experience all the more thrilling.
188;In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and peace.
189;This film is quite unlike anything by Hitchcock.
190;This film is superb in the way it presents these dilemmas.
191;Cotten is absolutely ideal as the weak, undecided, ordinary man, fascinated by those who are more charismatic than himself, and stumbling in his attempts to discover the right decisions to make.
192;the ending is exceptionally good, as the desirable woman walks straight past him, having come to her decision on purely emotional grounds, unaffected by the immorality, callousness or cynicism of the man she had committed herself to.
193;This is pure Graham Greene.
194;now that I've watched the really outstanding documentary on the second disc, with the commentary spoken by John Hurt .
195;layered meanings of Europe's two thousand years of history, culture and suffering.
196;thus begins one of the greatest films ever made and one of the greatest film characters ever created in the charismatic and brilliantly dangerous Harry Lime.
197;he brings the enigmatic Lime to life, his genius hanging over every frame of this wonderful Carol Reed production.
198;Joseph Cotten, a friend and staple in a lot of his films, is on hand as pulp western writer Holly Martins.
199;What follows is the most stylishly filmed noir in film history.
200;Harry Lime is almost amused by the chase and the proceedings.
201;His Harry Lime is unforgettable.
202;center mood for this film and is justly famous.
203;All the extra goodies on this Blu.
204;The most fabulous of these, for radio lovers at least, is Welles' portrayal of Harry Lime in one of the finest from that radio series.
205;every single part of this film works within the atmospheric framework to create a dark and exciting jigsaw puzzle you'll never forget.
206;orson Welles is great, and it's truly a shame he didn't appear in more movies.
207;he does an absolutely awesome job in this movie.
208;back with Citizen Kane is one of the best nights of movie watching I can think of.
209;wW2 Vienna as the stage, effective and intriguing.
210;But what struck me the most was the brilliant sound.
211;Somehow he plays the villain, but reels in the audience to be cheering for him in the fantastic finalee sewer scenes.
212;Reed plays the perfect and the most beautiful saddened soul.
213;"no question this is classic film, one that should be on everyone's ""Must Watch"" list."
214;And if you can, see the Criterion version on blu.
215;ray, visually and sonically stunning!
216;this film has great photography, strong sense of mood, great performances and direction, so what's wrong?
217;namely, a story that fails to engross and enthrall the viewer, and a score that is pointlessly unique .
218;in short, this is a film that you admire for its technique, but from a distance.
219;and since the best films engage your emotions thoroughly, this can't be considered in the same league as the greats
220;This film will undoubtedly be ranked as among the great films of the 20th century.
221;I was happy to see that Warner Bros. released the Blu.
222;The difference is small but it's definitely there.
223;Carol Read's directing (evidently much influenced by the work of Orson Welles) is superbly coupled to Robert Krasker's cinematography.
224;The look of the film is perhaps as much of a leading character as those played to perfection by Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten.
225;it all comes together in an absorbing story centered around the mysterious figure of Harry Lime (played by Welles), charming and treacherous.
226;The insistent zither background music is perhaps the most distinctive movie music soundtrack ever recorded.
227;The Third Man is one of those reputed classics of cinema that I'd always wanted to watch, and when I saw that it had been released on blu.
228;Really, it was an experiment .
229;Black and white film may have found its perfect accomplice in the interplay of light and shadow along its cobblestone streets, which in turn highlight the depths of characters as they dogde and dart and keep their true motivations to themselves for most of the film.
230;This is one of the most mature films from the 40's that I've ever seen .
231;(I also felt a striking similarity between the British police in 'The Third Man', and the authorities in Terry Gilliam's masterpiece 'Brazil'.
232;'The Third Man' deserves its classic status, if for nothing more than its cinematography (and definitely not for the zither music on the soundtrack.
233;ray I'll eventually get the chance to put some of them head.
234;ray, and if 'The Third Man' is one of your stellar films, then I'd certainly recommend it in blu.
235;4 famous scenes for good reason,, zither music perfect
236;His masterful performance as Harry Lime ranks with one of the most memorable film characterizations in cinema history.
237;Be sure and rewind to watch this scene again and again.
238;the haunting, lilting zither music by Anton Karros is another reason this film is a classic.
239;Rarely has music been so solidly integrated into a film's plot.
240;The Third Man is Carol Reed's tour de force and is truly one of the great films in history.
241;Others without the label blu ray work fine.
242;It is a sad that audiences today don't have the tastes like the ones from yesteryear, when movies could entertain you with just good stories and good acting, aided by beautiful photography.
243;"So, when a gem of a film like ""The Third Man"" is released in the Blu."
244;ray format, our hearts jump with joy.
245;This is truly one great cinematic experience, a movie that shall not be buried in history.
246;It is under these conditions that Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives from the United States to this beautiful city.
247;As a result, we are provided with delightful suspense, in which one surprise follows the next, aided by a penetrating soundtrack, great photography, and moments of humor.
248;"famed movie critic Roger Ebert is quoted as saying, ""Of all the movies I have seen, this one most completely embodies the romance of going to the movies."""
249;The Third Man was awarded an Oscar in 1949 for Best Cinematography (Robert Krasker), as well as the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.
250;This one is definitely a keeper.
251;Criterion once again has a great transfer of a film that is one of the best arguments for the drama of black and white versus color.
252;Carol Reed's exteriors and shadows of Vienna are unforgettable.
253;great script, great acting, great photography, great locations, great score.
254;"Graham Greene is a brilliant story teller and ""The Third Man"" is a fascinating, beautifully crafted tale that lends itself perfectly to the screen2."
255;He brings genius and energy to the screen even though his character is absent for most of this film.3.
256;It was eerie and fascinating to see this drama played out among the ruins that were quite literally a shadow of the catastrophic war that had preceded it.4.
257;The music in this film is amazing and I haven't encountered anything like it in any other.5.
258;I happen to love film.
259;"noire (except for Bush's speeches) and ""The Third Man"" is subtle, exquisitely refined film noire.6."
260;I am also interested in transpersonal psychology, so I always love it when stories mingle personal drama with larger than life events which this one did.7.
261;From a purely cinematic point of view (I'm no expert, this is just my opinion), this film is beautifully shot with not a single superfluous or disconnected scene.8.
262;The film contains wonderful ironies including the historical fact that post.
263;They are flawed and interesting in their own ways which makes them much more believable and fun to watch.10.
264;"I just saw ""Until Sunrise"" a few weeks ago, so it's fun to do mental comparisons between bombed."
265;Some people even pay with their lives pursueing good idealistic goals even in a balanced way.
266;And some people who get out of the trap almost fall right back in.
267;There are many films considered great.
268;"Most of these are great in one way or another
269;the story: A true mystery.
270;the script: From it first voice over introduction to it's voiceless end sequence The Third Man demonstrates brilliant screen writing.
271;The dialog is real, but it is more.
272;For one thing it is funny.
273;Not just 'fuuny' in the sense of comic lines, but in subtle ways"
274;They communicate the charactor's state of mind thud allowing a wonderful econmomy of dialog.
275;Brilliant!Symbolism: The Third Man can be thoroughly enjoyed as a simple mystery film.
276;But look a little deeper into the images and it becomes much more.
277;Notice how a small spoken revelation at the ride's apex changes the charactor's life from heaven to a decent into hell.
278;The fingers through the grate will tell you.
279;the Music: How can one 'simple' piece on a zither carry ALL the moods of so emotionally complex a story?
280;It is so perfect that a visual of the instrument being played is even used to meaningfully introduce the film.
281;Orson Wells' walk as he approaches the Ferris Wheel tells us more about the man then 20 minutes of typical expositional dialog.
282;Joseph Cotton is equally wonderful to watch.
283;It remains a classic of its genre.
284;Tense, exciting, great acting, filmed in the story's actual setting (Vienna) all go together to ensure this is still a great film.
285;please to notice the great cinematography of this film.
286;It's pretty well redundant to say that this is a wonderful movie, so let me just say that Criterion has given movie lovers a gift that will be appreciated forever .
287;they have taken a great work of art and restored it to its original pristine beauty.
288;Ah, what an excellent, entertaining little film this is!
289;as I said, I'd only recently seen the film for the first time, and I was very impressed by it!
290;The acting was amazingly good as was the direction, and the plot was sensational!
291;the film is also filled with incredible moments.
292;The appearance of Welles, which is probably the best reveal in movie history.
293;The chase through the sewers was VERY impressive and that alone makes the film worth watching!The movie was based on a story by Grahm Greene.
294;It's one of the best movies ever made, and worth every penny.
295;I enjoyed the movie only the VHS copy had flaws in it i. e., sections where no dialogue was heard and skips occurred.
296;ray version I was constantly distracted by the tremendous amount of film grain in the picture.
297;There are moments of absolute brilliance in this extraordinary morality play that explores the tension between loyalty to friends, self interest, and loyalty to the overarching moral code imposed by the social contract.
298;The dialogue between Wells and Cotten in the ferris wheel poses the moral dilemma quite vividly (do you really care about those little dots moving along the ground below?)
299;Also there is a great deal of suspense during this scene as to what Wells will do.
300;One of the great scenes in the history of film.
301;This option is compellingly portrayed and cannot be rejected out of hand.
302;greene's book has a far happier end, and I prefer it to the film's ending.
303;it is not an unrealistic Hollywood ending, is more upbeat given the moral stance of the story, and is consistent with the moral code of the girl that love conquers all.
304;It's not a nihilistic film and is a morality affirming film .
305;His work is truly great.
306;And Wells is perfect in his portrayal of Harry Lime.
307;He has a way of smirking that portrays Lime's moral stance as well as anything can.
308;the chase scene in the sewers of Vienna is also pure genius.
309;In fact, it's hard to sit through the first third of the movie without the advance knowledge that this is truly one of the greatest films ever made.
310;I love the time period this take place in .
311;Everything about this movie works.
312;And he realizes that Lime is alive.
313;joseph Cotten as Martins strikes just the right note of charm, inquisitiveness and weakness.
314;And what a great voice Cotten had.
315;Orson Welles, who could be so hammy, reins it in here.
316;But Lime's discussion of all those little dots goes to the heart of his character.
317;Alida Valli as Anna is terrific as a woman who loves Lime but has no illusions left.
318;I've always liked him, even in most of the later lousey movies he signed up for.
319;the ending is one of the most understated and powerful I've ever seen.
320;He obviously has feelings for her.
321;Anna, in the distance, walks toward him.
322;the Criterion edition is just as superb as the movie, and the extras are worth watching.
323;A fantastic story (Graham Greene wrote the screenplay), terrific acting and first.
324;class cinematography (full of camera shots that are utterly riveting) make The Third Man a must.
325;handed and obtrusive at times, but almost sixty years after its release, The Third Man remains a masterpiece.
326;This was a gift for my husband.
327;The movie was in excellent condition and arrived before expected.
328;now tour of where key scenes were filmed in the old city.
329;"Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"" is a superbly concocted film noir thriller filmed amid the ruins of post war Vienna."
330;penniless American writer Holly Martins, played by the vastly underrated Joseph Cotten arrives in Vienna at the behest of his long time friend Harry Lime, with an offer of employment.
331;cotten is eventually coaxed to capture Lime who actually faked his death.
332;this superb film culminates in an unforgetable chase through the bowels of Vienna's vast underground sewer system.
333;All of the technical aspects of The Third Man are superb, including the cinematography by Robert Krasker, and the memorable scoring by Anton Karas, whose zither music became a mid.
334;It's truly amazing how much emotion was wrung out of one very particular instrument.
335;It is a two disk package, and one of the best the company has produced since it went `lite' in its features, after adopting the semi.
336;"
337;As with his review of Angels With Dirty Faces, Polan is thorough, detailed, scene specific, and enthused to the point of never letting any dead spots break through his audio.
338;Overall, it's an excellent package.
339;the Third Man won the Grand Prix at the 1949 Cannes Film Festival, the British Academy Award for Best Film, and the Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography in 1950.
340;It deserved those honors and more, for, despite the claims of would be glad.
341;handers of the film, it was well above standard Hitchcockian thrillers.
342;It is also, along with Casablanca, often pointed to as an exception to the auteur theory of filmmaking, in terms of making great cinema.
343;But it is certainly a film noir, as Harry Lime is probably the best, if not most perfect, antihero that genre's ever come up with.
344;He is capable of cruelty and betrayal, but also decency.
345;But the best scenes, the ones that are remembered"
346;"Simply put: greatness in art does not spike out of nowhere
347;I know this is probably heresy, but I think Carol Reed's The Third Man is a better movie than Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.
348;It's easily the best movie Welles acted in, I think.
349;Graham Greene's screenplay deserves a lot of the credit.
350;If you want to enjoy great camera.
351;in addition to the fabulous cinematography, an unique feature of this movie is the music, which is very strange for a film noir.
352;all traits of Wells the director, are here to enjoy
353;angle camera shots, the way the plot twists and shifts who is covering up what and why is simply wonderful.
354;It is one of those rare movies that absolutely convinces you it is one kind of movie and ends up being another.
355;the always commented upon zither music does contribute mightily to the atmosphere of the film.
356;orson Welles, Jospeh Cotten, Alia Valli, Trevor Howard, and all the rest are wonderful.
357;And the way Criterion has done the transfer is magnificent.
358;this is a great disk.
359;You will want to see it every few months.
360;It is so rare that a double.
361;A wealth of new extras have been added making this a must.
362;He talks about Reed as an underrated director and herald's the film's atmospheric black and white cinematography.
363;view of filmmakers as well.
364;This commentary is like watching the film with these two guys in your living room .
365;This track is a nice contrast to the first as it is more scholarly in nature.
366;perhaps, the strongest extra in the entire two.
367;minute documentary on the film with visits to some of the original locations and archival interviews with key cast and crew members.
368;Many were in fact written and performed by Welles himself.
369;Also included is a radio play adaptation of the film with Cotton reprising his role.
370;Graham Greene: The Hunted Man is a rare 1968 BBC profile of this famous novelist and screenwriter.
371;Almost 60 minutes in length, it is an excellent look at his life and illustrious career.
372;star record for this movie, but here goes.
373;Ok, so the film has very sharp contrast and bizarre camera angles.
374;It's probably very interesting for film school students.
375;It's very hard to keep the mystery and suspense going with this monotonously happy tune blaring from the speakers.
376;I think the zither music in this film shows remarkable variety and expressiveness.
377;it can be lively and jaunty, or poignant, sad and haunting, it can express suspense, tension, anxiety, confrontation.
378;It's amazing how it can change to enhance and intensify the mood or action.
379;the final scene is poetic.
380;Any suggestions?It is enhanced by the poignant music, expressing regret at longing.
381;The scene is beautiful with the long lines of trees, as she walks down from afar.
382;And it shows the artistic creativity of Carol Reed.
383;One of the great classic movies.
384;They do not make movies like these anymore and the casting is the greatest.
385;The use of shadows and directional lighting is amazing.
386;But even beyond the look of the film, the plot and the acting are also excellent.
387;There is an unexpected surprise in the plot about two.
388;thirds the way through the film and it changes the entire direction of the movie and puts the main character, Martins in a perplexing moral dilemma.
389;Orsen Welles appears in this film and also delivers a memorable performance.
390;The sound is also impressive for a 50+.
391;I love this movie more every time I see it.
392;Joseph Cotton is perfect as the American everyman Holly Martins and provides the emotional core of the film.
393;Trevor Howard has amazing presence and style as the British police inspector.
394;The dialogue sparkles in its cynicism and the visuals of Vienna at night are striking.
395;Welles's entrance deep into the film is one of the greatest moments ever captured on the screen.
396;The final scene perfectly expresses the pain of unrequited love without a word being spoken.
397;Masterful work by director Carol Reed.
398;are excellent, with a great deal of enhancement and restoration to both.
399;The extra features include lots of production stills, a nice introduction by Peter Bogdanovich (sp?)
400;, and an alternative soundtrack with Graham Greene's story layered over the movie.
401;There are, in addition, a couple of Third Man radio broadcasts to listen to, along with a very nice newsreel clip of Anton Karas on the zither.
402;This is just a great movie.
403;I first saw the film on my way to Japan in 1949, I saw it again in the Tokyo USO for the second time to enjoy the music.
404;A great experience to watch the great talents and hear that exceptional zither.
405;takes someplace in the Los Angeles area, what a thrill that would be to see.
406;Really great film with a superb transfer, as can be expected by Criterion.
407;The setting is one which has always fascinated me: post.
408;And that's just for openers!
409;This excellent edition has numerous extra features which anyone who loves movies will appreciate.
410;The black and white cinematography is superb.
411;I wonder if anyone nowadays could do an original black and white film which could be so very memorable and to create so many strong images without simply copying from the work of filmakers in the 30s and 40s?
412;Joseph Cotton's performance deserves mention.
413;He played his roles in both films with naturalness and believability.
414;This movie is a prime example of classic film, if not the staple of perfection in not only the crime/noir genre, but in all of cinema.
415;The setting is breathtaking, the acting is marvelous and the script is superb.
416;Post WWII Vienna is a site to behold .
417;Speaking of characters, what a cast of characters it is.
418;The character Anna (Valli) is wonderful and smart, not a weak.
419;She has backbone and depth, something particularly impressive given the year in which this movie was made, let alone by today's standards.
420;The last five minutes of the film is a perfect example of this as Holly (Cotton) waits for Anna.
421;Holly is a humorous and sympathetic protagonist and Harry Lime (Wells) delivers quite a speech that, like the movie itself, leaves quite a lasting impression.
422;This is a must see for any Orson Wells fan.
423;If you've never seen it, do your self a favor.
424;Great story and movie, but I do love the old movies , That is what is so wonderful about Prime.
425;well, with our free shipping.
426;Winning the 1949 Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, the film would win a British Academy Award for Best Film and an Academy Award for """"Best Black and White Cinematography""""."""
427;but the film would also receive top honors with the film being selected by the British French Institute as the best British Film of the 20th Century, 57th on the American Film Institute's list of top American films and is regard by cinema fans as one of the great films made of all time.
428;"According to Criterion, ""The picture has been slightly windowboxed to ensure that the maximum image is visible on all monitors."
429;On widescreen televisions, black bars will appear on the left and right of the image to maintain the proper screen format.
430;Black are nice and deep but you can see a lot more detail in the surroundings.
431;The film just looks beautiful on Blu.
432;I personally enjoyed the cinematography of the film.
433;And Anton Karas's music sounds absolutely beautiful.
434;A commentary that is quite complimentary of the film and also discussing about the film and some factual tidbits.
435;An informative and entertaining commentary by the film scholar Dana Polan.
436;No slowdown, Polan is very good at describing each scene quite well.
437;(4:39) An introduction by Peter Bogdanovich about why he enjoys the film, a discussion with Orson Welles and more.
438;For the first time, both the US(1:23, featuring Joseph Cotton's voice.
439;"(56:25) A rare profile from 1968 of novelist and screenwriter Graham Greene which was shown on the BBC arts program ""Omnibus""."
440;For one, the talents were well.
441;cast, the cinematography and the amount of cuts and smooth editing was fantastic, the music was memorable and most of all the storyline was well.
442;because the film took place right after World War II, the destruction of Vienna and what was going on at the time with people having to sell their jewelry and belongings just to get bread and butter due to the heavy rationing at the time is captured.
443;so, in some sense, this film is also a snapshot of a time in history and why it remains so popular in the minds of many cinema fans but also a sign of pain for some who live in Austria and seeing how things were at the time the film was being shot.
444;Even many historians on Vienna's history are impressed of how much the film captures that difficult time in Vienna history and also has actual footage from that time.
445;but there are just so many memorable scenes that stick in my head.
446;There are so many moments in this film that stay strong in your head.
447;but what I found so fantastic about this release from THE CRITERION COLLECTION was the amount of bonus content.
448;"That's awesome to receive so much content for an older film such as ""The Third Man""."
449;Bonus content that actually is quite entertaining, especially when you find out how volatile things were behind.
450;"overall, ""The Third Man"" is a film and a Blu."
451;"THE CRITERION COLLECTION"" is highly recommended!"
452;"I'm not one to rave about ""glorious black and white"" cinematography."
453;Spring and a colorful rejuvenation seem remote.
454;And so the sharp black and white Oscar.
455;winning cinematography of Robert Krasker, imaginative and deeply evocative of a great city in darkness, was perfect.
456;but The Third Man is more than brilliant cinematography set to a haunting melody.
457;The script by Graham Greene from his novel of the same name is intelligent and compelling.
458;this is a great film because almost everything was done right.
459;The result is a work of art that invades and sets up permanent residence in our psyches.
460;I saw this for the first time as a boy many years ago and it remained in my memory as the most mysterious and eerie movie I had ever seen.
461;this is included in the film noir canon, and indeed it represents itself well there.
462;But The Third Man is better understood as a film of stark realism as well as a mystery in the tradition of an older genre that accepts the common standards of human decency as right and correct (as Catholic Graham Greene believed them) and does not give way to amorality or the success of evil.
463;Harry Lime is a man of charm and character, of intelligence and worldly wiles, but he is also a man with a sociopathic personality and a callous disregard for human life other than his own.
464;You hear something almost happy, but you know this can't be right.
465;All in all, this works profoundly to disorient the viewer in a most artful way.
466;the Third Man contains my favorite cinematic sequence of all time .
467;I won't give it away for those who might not have seen it, but the music simply makes it, and throws the entire genre to the wind.
468;We loved it and now have the movie as a remembrance of the tour!
469;This is in the top 10.
470;Orson Wells is just amazing, always but this.
471;The shadows and sounds and music are just wonderful.
472;All I can say is get it and watch it, again and again, we do.
473;I play the zither, beautiful music, NOT in this film, constant annoyance at any, and I mean any plot reveal.
474;the film was made in 1948 before the widescreen format ever came into fashion.
475;The Third Man ranks among my top ten movies of all time, yet most of the people I know have never heard of it.
476;This is an engaging, witty, well.
477;Everything comes together with a style and substance that is simply remarkably enjoyable!
478;The sets and locations make post.
479;Joseph Cotton shines as the naive Holly Martin.
480;From the moment you first see his feet, to the last you see his fingertips, Welles dominates this film.
481;You must see this film!Do you simply like movies?
482;The film is one of the most beautiful films ever shot.
483;This is deffinately one of the best movies ever made.
484;Terrific Graham Greene dark storyline, great cinematography in post.
485;war Vienna, superb casting and great performances by the cast.
486;Well worth seeing, even considering its age.
487;Others can review the absorbing and suspenseful drama.
488;Dedication to providing perfection of image and a wealth of background material just radiates from this item.
489;"To those achieving this perfection I say, ""Thank you so much for setting such a high standard for all of us who do indeed recognize and appreciate the ultimate when we see it!"""
490;As the professionals they were, they were totally convincing!
491;I liked the acting, the story line, and the cinematography.
492;I would recommend it to anyone who likes movies
493;japanese, French and Spanish, okay.
494;Definitely one of Graham Greene's best works.
495;Carol Reed's 1946 film is one of those texts that could justifiably be described as 'great.'
496;The cast is just brilliant, contrasting Joseph Cotten's brilliant Holly Martens with Trevor Howard's cynical officer, and Orson Welles' memorable cameo as Harry Lime.
497;The locations are equally memorable, redolent of a post.
498;The sequence taking place by the ferris.
499;wheel is just brilliant: Robert Krasker's atmospheric black.
500;even simple pleasures such as riding on the wheel .
501;"And then of course there's the score, with the memorable zither played by Anton Karas
502;But the film is really something.
503;It all combines in a magical goulash of sensory impressions, suspense, and thoughtful provocation.
504;All the little threads knit together seamlessly.
505;It is a film that relies heavily on style, but all of the acting is so nuanced, and understated.
506;This may be Joseph Cotton's best role, although Orson Welles is also a standout.
507;So many great lines:""""You were born to be murdered."""""""
508;"They have their five.year plans, so have I.""Here is a man loved by two people, his boyhood friend, and his most recent lover."
509;What is the nature of loyalty?
510;What does it take to bring a sword, instead of peace between friends and loved ones?
511;When the people we love are wolves in sheeps clothing.
512;and Why do you love?A timeless classic, suffused with the atmosphere of postwar Vienna.
513;The British Film Institute ranks it the best film of the 20th century.
514;As usual, Criterion has done a magnificent job not only with supplemental material on the disc but with the printed booklet accompanying the product.
515;the film itself, as most cinephiles will attest, is generally considered to be one of the finest examples of its kind ever made.
516;Brilliant direction by Carol Reed along with great performances by Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton and Alida Valli make this a must.
517;"So many great moments punctuate this gem and can be commented on but I will say that, personally, my favorite scene is between Welles and Cotton which takes place high above Vienna on the ""Prater"" wheel."
518;The dialogue between the two is unforgettable.
519;This has for 30 years been my favorite thriller or Film Noir.
520;With a script by the extraordinary novelist Graham Greene (who wrote it in novella form, not as a screenplay), exceptional performances, the atmosphere of a bombed out post WWII Vienna, and one of the most memorable scores in all film, its a must see.
521;The best thing about this movie which is kind of ugly but important because it filmed when Vienna was still in ruins so its always being mentioned to new generations .
522;the best thing is that when he was there, Orson Welles said to them .
523;ing them with loads of bad for you but crowd pleasing whipped cream so god knows what Orson saw when he was there.
524;This is early film noir with a classy European touch.
525;The real gem of the film, aside from brilliant acting, a terrific cast, memorable characters, an intriguing story, and fabulous cinematography, is the score: sort of quasi.
526;gypsy instrumentation that gives the film a genuine local flavor.
527;Rarely has background music made such a transcendent impact on a film.
528;going experience, but such is the case of Anton Karas's haunting zither in Carol Reed's 1949 dark thriller, a genuine classic of post.
529;The sparkling, sylphlike strumming makes an ironic, dramatically effective counterpoint to the foreboding atmosphere of a bombed.
530;There are many ironies embedded In the story, no surprise given that the screenplay is penned by novelist Graham Greene, whose best work reflects the pervasive moral ambiguities surrounding modern man and the moral ambivalence that complicates otherwise comfortable lives.
531;the intricate story focuses on Holly Martins, a semi.
532;"Problems for Martins are compounded by the political divisions of the city (Vienna was in four quadrants like Berlin)
533;graham masters the treacherous turns of the script with his trademark humanism and spirited wit, and Reed brings a cinematic style that recalls not coincidentally Orson Welles's masterpiece, """"Citizen Kane""""."""
534;Working to represent the perspective of the curious viewer, Cotten is terrific in his career.
535;Welles shows up late and elliptically in the film as the central figure in the plot, but he makes every moment count, especially the suspenseful chase scene through the Vienna sewer system at the end.
536;like sultriness that works, even though her thick accent gets in the way of some of Graham's deft dialogue.
537;another nod to Welles can be found in Robert Krasker's expressionistic cinematography full of deep shadows and off.
538;The lengthy, melancholic last shot summarizes the story perfectly.
539;white film, equally impressive audio, an alternate opening which includes more of Holly's first.
540;This is a genuine film noir classic well worth your time.
541;It has suspense, drama, romance, action and mystery.
542;Acted out by a top of the notch cast.
543;Joesph Cotton is a great actor.
544;Trevor Howard does a very good job as Major Calloway, the charming British police officer.
545;And Valli does a splendid job as Lime's lover.
546;Orson Welles plays one of his most unforgettable roles as the sinister, evil minded gangster, Harry Lime.
547;That's the best entry of any character into a film.
548;Extremely well done film, that music is great.
549;What an amazing film this is.
550;Killer direction and cinematography, a script that doesn't assume the viewer is a moron, and the remarkable post.
551;Joseph Cotton is solid, the supporting cast is Filini.
552;esque, and Orson Welles turns in a remarkable performance as the enigmatic Harry Lime.
553;see viewing for any student of cinema.
554;The application of the camera upon the storytelling process is a truly eye.
555;"opening experience
556;As well, Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles were at the top of the form here.
557;additionally, THE THIRD MAN should be cited as one of the films to best use location photography.
558;while there may have been hundreds of more entertaining film noirs made since THE THIRD MAN, keep in mind one simple fact when viewing it: this is the first, and all that followed pay homage to it.
559;ray version of """"The Third Man"""" is by far the best I have seen."""
560;The greatest tribute I can give is that I've watched it over a half.
561;brought to life so vividly in this film with expert writing, beautiful cinematography, and flawless performances by the actors.
562;Because the film is so grainy .
563;technically this requires a lot of digital bits to properly reproduce.
564;i love the look of the film and the people in it.
565;is such a classic that everyone should see this movie once, if only to hear Welles' speech.
566;With fine humour, hypnotic mood and plot, great actors, and off course an extra character Vienna (right after WWII).
567;A must see for anyone who appreciates a fine crafted story (screenplay).
568;A Touch of Evil is the film for you.
569;Fantastic movie, every time I watch it I see something new.
570;Great cinematography, acting is superlative and story is gripping
571;The Third Man is one of the most beautifully photographed films of all time.
572;This achievement is director Carol Reed's, and his alone.
573;The dominating force behind the film is Harry Lime, a name heard countless times before we are given a face to go along with it, this achievement is belongs to Graham Greene and Orson Welles.
574;The trust between celluloid and the audience comes from the film's hero, Holly Martins.
575;This achievement belongs to Joseph Cotten.
576;But its the atmosphere that is the most endearing aspect of this classic 1949 treasure of a movie.
577;This is film presents an engrossing experience from start to finish, and absolutely everything about it is pitch perfect.
578;Orson Welles delivers one of the best performances of all time, due partly to the scene atop a Ferris Wheel, and mostly to his absence, and the care taken by writer Graham Greene in creating a perfect character without ever actually seeing him.
579;He makes Holly Martins down to earth, brave, headstrong, and truly American.
580;Alida Valli is breathtaking, and because of her, Anna Schmidt is a character we take joy in watching, making Anna Schmidt one of the greater love interest in the Film Noir genre.
581;The photography is incredible, the city enormous and isolating, the characters are canon, the story is timeless, and the film is perfect.
582;Not quite satisfied, he does some of his own investigating and along the way meets his friend's beautiful lover (Valli).
583;noir fashion, The Third Man utilizes lighting and contrasting black and white cinematography effectively.
584;Furthermore, Orson Welles portrays a very intriguing character in Harry Lime.
585;"I disagree with those who have called this a perfect"" film, except to the extent that they mean its artistic satisfactions were perfect for them, which I can understand."
586;Indeed, many great films have flaws, and a flawless film need not be great.
587;Greatness is, in part, the result of the scope of the artist's ambitions, and I believe Graham Greene's and Carol Reed's high ambitions were largely achieved.
588;thereby illuminating the fleeing Lime.
589;But when the light in the opposite building goes on, illuminating the street and revealing Welles in the doorway beneath Anna's apartment .
590;in what Martin Scorcese has called one of the most thrilling moments in film .
591;Welles steals the show because of the dissonance between what we have been told of Lime and what we see: Welles, with all his dazzling charisma, charm, wit, good looks, and ironic smile.
592;"Indeed, it takes Callaway's ""magic lantern show"" to convince Martins, and us, that this irresistible character is a moral monster."
593;"Lime is a ""charmer"" in both senses of the word ."
594;a charismatic wit and a seducer, a deceiver .
595;he seduced Martins figuratively, and Anna literally, but he seduces both of them, and the audience, emotionally.
596;"Martins calls Lime the ""best friend I ever had,"" yet says in the same breath that he hadn't seen him since 1939 and only ""occasionally"" before that."
597;Lime radiates bonhomie and captures others by warming them with his counterfeit intimacy and enthusiasm.
598;He just made things . . . fun.
599;"appeals to friendship and ""old times,"" appeals for sympathy, thinly veiled threats, joviality ."
600;but it is the type of sleight of hand that, in combination with his indefatiguable good spirits and boyish enthusiasm, has always carried all before it for Harry, and by which he has always been able to keep the loyalty of those he needed.
601;For the same reason a vulture finds a carcass.
602;furthermore, Tuberacer: Yes, the film is funny, as well as serious, as well as tragic.
603;As for the zither, which many reviewers found intrusive or distracting: I think it adds to the film in a way that may be unique in films.
604;It has a presence and a sound that suffuses the film with an old.
605;The sound is like something we have never heard before that yet conveys something familiar, as if a piece of music perfectly captured the feel of the street upon which one lived as a child.
606;The principal theme music itself is adaptive to the film, with a strolling initial theme, a insistive, percussive second part, and a lyrical third section.
607;it adds an effect and I like it for that.
608;"It is idle to compare it to ""The Big Sleep,"" as Tuberacer does."
609;There is no hope for any of them.
610;It is a great film because, from the struggles of a handful of obscure people in a ruined city in the wake of war, it presents a rueful view of the sorrows, contradictions, and tragedy of human struggles and obligations.
611;A beautiful, atmospheric movie shot in post.
612;The film is graced with beautiful black and white cinenatography and with a haunting music score.
613;The long shot at the film's end of Valli walking toward the camera is breathtaking.
614;The Third Man is one of my favorite films of all time.
615;Really enjoyed having it back in my collection.
616;they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce?
617;it has been said thousands of times about the greatest movie entrance ever .
618;I think it is one of the greatest, too.
619;a beautiful mysterious girl with tragic past was in love with him and the unforgettable ending, so anti.
620;hollywood, so true to the film .
621;I am so happy that Reed won (I am sure millions of fans are, too).
622;That was the way to finish the movie and make it much more than just typical noir.
623;Makes the viewer think about love, friendship, betrayal, loyalty, the price one pays for them.
624;the restored version of the film shines.
625;There are two openings of the film available .
626;British and American, and a lot of extras.
627;"This film is one of the few truly perfect films ever made
628;Using the 3rd Man theme by A. Korda as the constant background, the action flow from scene to scene are smoothly choreographed.
629;This iconic film noir is laced with British dark humor and continous brilliant dialog.
630;James Cotton does a fabulous job playing a down and out 10.
631;The truley impressive thing about this movie is that in a few scenes Orson Welles out does Joseph Cotton in one of his best roles.
632;Playing an american in post war veinna Cotton is perfect.
633;The style and intrigue in this movie are overwhelming, yet Cotton holds his own.
634;A classic, not to be missed by anyone who loves movies.
635;Welles' last great performance, and Cotten is perfectly cast as the clueless American.

640;All I can say is to watch the movie.
641;Everything that makes a movie brilliant is here: Actors, script, cinematography, music.
642;He was one of those people who are always the center of attention and have everyone wanting to be around them because of the fun.
643;This movie presents questions about good and evil.
644;The subject of human nature and the black market is depicted well in this movie.
645;Filmed in black and white, it's use of lighting is excellent to convey mood and nefarious action.
646;Orson Welles and Joseph Cotton are true professionals.
647;This movie has it all: complex characters, a plot that unfolds with perfect timing, an intriguing setting, moral ambiguity, and a soundtrack you'll never forget.
648;war Vienna, and the sense of place that grounds the movie is incredible.
649;The prolonged final scene delivers a powerful punch every time I watch this movie.
650;thirds of the way into The Third Man, Harry's character is a presence that looms over the film from the first moments.
651;it is a film, certainly, but it is so much more than a mere movie.
652;'The Third Man' is where Shakespeare, opera, the novel, poetry, pulp fiction, fine art and music all collide.
653;they say you can see the hand of an auteur behind a great movie.
654;But I defy you to identify a single auteur behind 'The Third Man'.
655;It is a Viennese lifetime of symphonies.
656;And an infinite poem that begins where it ends.
657;one connected with it came close to doing anything as good ever again.
658;You can stand today in Josephplatz and touch the statues outside Harry Lime's apartment and hope to be moved by the magic.
659;and therein lies the confirmation of its status as art.
660;The music as well as the cinematography used blend incredibly well with the story line, making this a truly suspenseful film.
661;i was recommended this movie by my sister and this is so far one of my all time favorite movies.
662;the camera angles and the witty cracking dialogue and the wonderful graham greene storyline is what makes this movie so fantastic.
663;style thrillers than this one is the best
664;True masterpiece in every sense of the word.
665;Try it . . . You'll like it!
666;This film is one of the great movies.
667;It has a compelling plot, a marvelous and propulsive zither soundtrack (yes, a zither soundtrack.
668;they just don't make 'em like that anymore), breathtaking cinematography, and magnetic performances from Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles.
669;written by Graham Greene, this is the epitome of the spy thriller.
670;If you like this sort of modern movie, you should see this, since it's a classic and in many ways the foundation of the tradition of the spy film.
671;It will also appeal to fans of film noir.
672;As an added bonus, it features a strong and intelligent heroine, ably played by Alida Valli.
673;The Third Man is a marvel of good plot construction.
674;It has all kinds of other things going for it, too, but at bottom it's just a great story.
675;In fact, Lime's funeral is taking place almost at that very moment.
676;:All of the above is the set.
677;up for what the film is ultimately all about.
678;Now we are on to something!
679;Many reviewers rate """"The Third Man"""" as 5."""
680;"eMPTY GLASS:I felt exactly the same way about ""The Wild One"" with Brando and ""A Touch Of Evil"" with Welles."
681;"After contemplating this for a while, I realized that ""The Third Man"" is actually a lot like ""A Touch Of Evil"" and that Welles has really spoiled me with his sensational performance from start to finish in the equally."
682;"After accepting that, I can now appreciate ""The Third Man"" and see the film (as well as Welles' role in it) as a half."
683;Holly Martins embodies this common American attitude in the film and we should see the Viennese reaction to his character as the reaction toward Americans in general during this period in history.
684;Cinematographer [won 1950 Academy Award for Cinematography]BOTTOM LINE: 57th GREATEST 20th CENTRUY FILM according to the A. f. i. 100 LIST:This is an excellent film in the style of film noir.
685;Orson Welles is, as always, a delight when he's in the scene and is sorely missing when he's not.
686;First at all , the ravishing presence of Orson Welles is felt all along this movie in such level you may well state this film was four hands directed .
687;The powerful and menacing atmosphere that surrounds Vienna after the WW2 , the expressionist style , the superb photograph , the bitter and clever dialogues , the high caliber acting level , the somber passages under Vienna's streets , the sideral beauty and presence of Alida Vali , the extraordinary performance given by Joseph Cotten , the unforgettable zither music of Anton Karas and the dark secrets all along the story demands from you special attention.
688;This film won Cannes Festival 1949.
689;A Cold War spy classic.
690;There's an American quarter, a British quarter, a Russian quarter and a French quarter and a sort of organized chaos.
691;Director Carol Reed's classic tale of suspense, betrayal and murder is a gripping tale, made even better by the role of a bombed and ruined Vienna, haunted by its former grandeur that becomes a character in herself.
692;This is a superb film in every way.
693;This is one of my favorite post.
694;An unsettling story of intrigue and deceit follows with stunning black and white cinematography and a musical score with a zither (!)
695;predominating that is both distinctive and memorable.
696;Orson Welles as Harry Lime makes one of the most memorable movie entrances ever.
697;This classic film noir thriller plays on national loyalties during the Cold War.
698;Orson Welles is prefect as the manipulative Harry Lime, a black market drug dealer and Cotton does a great job as the quintessentially brash American.
699;The underground sewer sequence is extraordinary.
700;The film is scored with a haunting theme by Anton Karas on unaccompanied zither to an eerie effect.
701;"If you are a fan of 1940s black and white film noir you're in for a real treat with ""The Third Man."""
702;This film's cinamatogaphy is incredibly beautiful, as are the camera angles, the lighting, and music sound track.
703;Anton Karas provides the zither music for the film introduction and as edge of your seat accompaniment throughout the movie, which adds to the intensity of the story.
704;cast actor Joseph Cotten, arrives in Vienna on the promise of a job from his good friend, Harry Lime.
705;Martins meets Lime's girlfriend, Anna, as played by the beautiful Alida Valli, who has her own problems related to her status in allied occupied Vienna.
706;Orson Welles is quite sinister as Harry Lime, while maintaining a certain amount of charm which enables him to retain a touch of undeserved sympathy.
707;We are introduced to Orson Welles's character in a rather amusing and startling manner which adds to the film's noir appeal.
708;The film's ending is very unsettling for all concerned, but this scintillating and beautifully photographed work of art, nevertheless proves to be, at least in my opinion, one of most suspenseful and satisfying post.
709;I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen when it was re.
710;Seeing the widescreen version is truly sublime.
711;Robert Krasker's cinematography is stunning.
712;The Anton Karas score is haunting.
713;Cotten, Howard and Valli are great in their parts, but Orson Welles as Harry Lime steals the film .
714;he should have won the Oscar for his brilliant work here.
715;It would easily have been the best picture of 1949 .
716;possibly winning the Oscar over All the King's Men.
717;Still, Orson should have won the Oscar for supporting actor over George Sanders in All About Eve.
718;Orson shows why he truly was one of the greatest movie stars off all time.
719;The movie features Orson Welles as Harry Lime and some excellent filmmaking depicting a post war divided Vienna.
720;This is a great movie for the mystery/suspense addict.
721;The Third Man is one of the most satisfying movies I've ever seen.
722;I felt that way about it when I first saw it on a muddy tape, and over the years I've seen it a few times and loved it just the same .
723;The first accomplishment of this disk is that it brings the images back.
724;There's some newsreel footage of the real Vienna sewer patrols who show up in the film's final sequence.
725;The commentary soundtrack is very decent.
726;All I can say is, this is an intelligent, complex, satisfying movie, acted superbly.
727;It evokes history in a genuine way.
728;Seeing the Third Man for the first time ever on this brand new edition of The Third Man from the folks at Criterion Collection is a real treat.
729;Excellent dialogue, international locale, wonderful performances, perfectly flawed characters, Cinematically gorgeous, a plot without a single hole.
730;there are very few perfect movies, but if you want to enjoy one, The Third Man is it.
731;with one of the greatest scenes in movie history between Cotton and Wells in a deserted ferris wheel, this is a great, great movie.
732;For fans of noir, this is a great Euro.
733;It was was so great seeing this again that I watched it twice with a two day interval between viewings.
734;An American writer of western novels arrives here to visit of friend of his.
735;The film is a masterpiece of suspense and plot with a touch of romance.
736;Which one is better ?
737;Beautiful, haunting, funny, romantic, sad, suspenseful.
738;Criterion has done a fantastic job in refurbishing the old print and making it like new.
739;This is a black and white film, Orson Welles is said to have remarked that b/w is the actors best medium, and when you watch this movie you'll understand why?
740;The stars are uniformly excellent (with minor reservations noted below) .
741;As well, the contribution of the Austrian cast is crucial to the authentic feel of the narrative.
742;The Third Man is more than a mystery story, it's an epiphany.
743;This is the experience the protagonist has and is shared by the audience.
744;It's a trivial point, and certainly does not alter my opinion that The Third Man is one of the best movies ever made.
745;The VHS version has it all, thank God.
746;Great movie of intrigue in Berlin, Germany after World War II.
747;The Third Man is the number one classic film noir.
748;I enjoy owning the film so that I can see it when I want.
749;It is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
750;Life changing is the way I would rate it.
751;Suspense is the key in this fine drama.
752;Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
753;Certainly worthy of being considered alongside the greatest of movies.
754;This is also certainly one of Joseph Cotten's finest performances.
755;Lot of extras (I really love the old radio broadcasts) to complement your viewing.
756;What can be said about a movie that has stood the test of time, in that it still has the power to move, intrigue, amuse and simply entertain the viewer even *55* years later??!!
757;so much is clear from the date of the movie, and the very realness of the bombed out city within which the story is set.
758;I'm so grateful that this movie has never been colored up because that would have taken away the wonderful use of shadows and light.
759;There are so many truly awesome moments .
760;There is something about the way that Welles moves, and the interplay of shadow and light, that is just beautiful.
761;the actors are all magnificent.
762;There are such wonderful moments in the script.
763;That line, so beautifully delivered, always brings a tear to my eye.
764;This is one of the great movies of all time.
765;The directing, casting and photography .
766;Thank you for offering this priceless movie.
767;An impressive list of information pointing to a powerful man, wouldn't you say?
768;"No wonder filmgoers love this guy's films
769;Anna Schmidt, who faces a possible expatriation to the Soviet Union's sector of the city, provides few answers to Martins's questions.
770;The two sequences at the end of the film, the sewer chase and the funeral scene, will stay you with for eons.
771;The performances are magisterial, the dialogue transcendent, and the set pieces perfectly match the sordid storyline.
772;Repeatedly, memorable scenes march across the screen.
773;Just as memorable is Anton Karas's zither score, an odd choice for a noir film yet a tune that fits the story perfectly and will have you humming for weeks afterwards.
774;No one with an ounce of appreciation for the cinematic form, regardless of their personal favorites, can deny the beauty and power of this film.
775;Don't wait as long as I did to see this phenomenal picture"
776;He is certainly not an auteur, let alone in the same class as Orson Welles who has a key supporting role in this film.
777;Nevertheless, THE THIRD MAN is a masterpiece and certainly one of the best movies of all time.
778;the plot construction is bold and ingenious, and the dialogue memorable thanks in large part to Grahame Greene's exquisite screenplay.
779;I just loved the way the 2 cemetery scenes with Valli framed the action.
780;There is also the fantastic cinematography with it's expressionistic and surrealistic touches, great acting by everyone, especially Cotton (his best role), Valli, Welles, and Trevor Howard, great editing which includes documentary footage in the narrated opening sequences, and a unique score in which the orchestra is replaced by a single instrument, the zither, expertly played by Anton Karas.
781;All the diverse elements are incorporated in a perfect blend of action, suspense, mystery, romance, and humor.
782;As is typical of the company's releases, Criterion's version of The Third Man is definitive.
783;It's a beautiful restoration of both image and sound, supplemented by a wealth of interesting material about the making of the film.
784;(Just hearing the original film treatment read by a fine actor, for example, makes you realize again what a great storyteller Graham Greene was in prose, quite apart from the masterpiece of a script he crafted for this film.)
785;And what a film it is!
786;It's perfectly paced by director Carol Reed, memorably acted by Joseph Cotton, Orson Welles, Trevor Howard and many others (with wonderful layers of tension, humor and romance), and stunningly photographed .
787;by cinematographer Robert Krasker (for which he won a richly.
788;Even the theme music, composed and performed on the zither by Anton Karas, was a huge hit in both the UK and the US.
789;Surely one of the great film noirs of all time, The Third Man was also voted the best British film of the 20th Century by the British Film Institute.
790;if you love movies, you'll love this film.
791;This version is now legendary.
792;ray version, we see these streets in a wholly new way.
793;They have a beautiful sparkle and luminosity that shades into the deep nighttime blackness of the buildings and the atmosphere.
794;Surely this is what Reed and Krasner actually saw and wanted us to see.
795;"The set designs are more detailed to the eye
796;So this is not only a very fun version for fans of the film.
797;It's also by far the best version for people who enjoy the building blocks of movies .
798;the cinematography, the lighting, the art direction.
799;those are big advantages, in my opinion.
800;Therefore this edition has become breathtakingly expensive in the aftermarket.
801;I looked at it a year ago and it was selling for $100.
802;i don't regret it for a moment, but then again, I've loved this movie for years and I had a pretty good idea what a step up the Criterion Blu.
803;ray version of the film is pretty good, and may well be fine for all but zealots like me.
804;so if you've """"gotta, gotta"""" have the undisputed best version of The Third Man, in all likelihood this is it."""
805;But it's going to cost you.
806;that is how great this picture looks after more than 50 years.

812;The story is well told, and the minor players, save for a whining tot, all play their roles well.

815;white) is portrayed as a composed, genial, elderly English gentleman.
816;the cast is perfect, though I cannot understand why this movie is seen as being a star.
817;The performances of both Joseph Cotton and Trevor Howard are infinitely more polished and effective than that of Welles and it's hard to understand why he has been so lionized over the years as the star of the picture.
818;As to the production itself, while it's become something of a clich that filming in black and white enhances dramatic value, it must be said that in The Third Man, it is also quite true.
819;In fact, the effect is spectacular, and I cannot imagine that color would do anything but detract from the impact.
820;The photography is so evocative and so perfectly attuned to the story as it unfolds that it alone is worth the price of admission.
821;When Orson Welles finally appears during the last third of THE THIRD MAN, Carol Reed stages the scene with such panache that you sit there grinning with pleasure.
822;Naive, decent American Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives in post WWII Vienna broke and ready to take a job offered to him by his old friend Harry Lime.
823;But within an hour he finds himself in a cemetery attending Harry's burial.
824;Graham Greene's and Carol Reed's most fameous collaboration, as good a confection as any Vienna has to offer, has style, wit and excitement galore.
825;Even the cockatoo from CITIZEN KANE shows up during a scene that is a tribute to early Hitchcock.
826;The ending still thrills with its mixture of brilliance and bravado.

828;It is probably the greatest British film of all too.

830;Radical in it's cinematic concept and brilliantly shot by Robert Krasker, the film has more atmosphere than any film I have seen before or since.
831;in the opinion of this reviewer, this is Cotten's best film and though I've never been a big fan of his, he suits the role admirably.
832;I also believe this is Trevor Howard's finest performance.
833;Shot on the streets of bombed.
834;"Much of the film
835;the Criterion transfer is the sharpest I have ever seen and rather than being merely technically precise, really adds to the atmosphere of the film.
836;There was an enormous number of repairs made to the original print (something like 22,000, if my memory serves me correctly) and the ultimate product is almost seemless and has a beautiful grey scale.
837;It is extraordinary how much the zither adds to the film.
838;reckoned by many to be the finest suspense film ever made and containing more cinematic innovation than almost anything which came afterward it, until the arrival of the French New Wave, this film wants for nothing.
839;The acting performances are top notch, the pictures are beautiful and the plot is terrific.
840;A cinematic gem not to be missed and essential to any serious film buff's library.
841;time great mysteries, the excellence of this production is reflected in the talents of its key contributors: old Mercury Theatre colleagues Welles and Cotten, screenwriter Graham Greene, producers Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick, and director Carol Reed.
842;Together, they create a haunting, intricate thriller, with corrupted souls inhabiting decimated Vienna like so many vultures.
843;Man also features one of the best music scores in all film, with Anton Karas's original zither score adding to the ominous proceedings.
844;Stunningly shot on location, this is a must.
845;Viewing """"The Third Man"""" again brings back pleasant memories not only because it is a masterful movie, but because it helps to relive my personal experience in the Austrian capital."""
846;Seeing the streets I knew so well was a treat.
847;what makes this a classic motion picture?
848;the superb acting (particularly Joseph Cotton, Orson Welles, Trevor Howard, and Alida Valli), the flashes of humor (witness the Wilfred Hyde.
849;white scenes), the gripping black and white photography, the suspense, the chase sequences (especially the one with the little boy chasing and accusing the couple through the dark streets), the use of ominous shadows, the build.
850;up of the mystery of the third person at the death scene, the use of Vienna as a major player, and the innovative zither sound track.
851;also: the great direction by Carol Reed surpassing Hitchcock's similar work, the love interest, the enormity of Harry Lime's crime in human terms, the little insights into characters (Baron Kurtz and Dr. Winkel were probably lovers), the police procedural component (the British military police), and Graham Greene's great script based upon his novel.
852;Like other golden movies, it is able to draw you into its being so you get completely enveloped in it like a Venus fly trap.

860;It's a fascinating doc which includes some interesting revelations, including the admission by Greene, who admitted for the first time: """"Carol Reed was right."""
861;"he made a magnificent ending."""
862;I see our old friends the reviewers have told the whole plot as usual.
863;The fate of Harry Lime is a foregone conclusion as soon as the English officer tells his story.
864;The fate of the porter also as soon as Holly Martins mentions the third man to a third person.
865;I know nothing about the making of a movie, but I've got to say that this is the best directed picture I have ever seen in my life.
866;I thought it was better than Hitchcock.
867;I don't like Joseph Cotton and I don't like Orson Welles, but I liked this movie and thought Welles in particular did a wonderful job of acting.
868;saw this at school and about 5 times since, one of the few old movies worth watching
869;It's a great story, good acting, sharp directing, and the cinemaphotography?
870;It felt film noirish which is appropriate for a film based in post war Vienna.
871;Finally, the music, the Third Man Theme, haunting and perfect counterpoint to the telling of the story.
872;I've watched it a hundred times and see something new and interesting every time.
873;The Third Man is one of my all time favorite films.
874;I was glad to see that the criterion collection had brought this great film to high def format.

877;Lime was at the heart of Blackmarket operation in the city and his death is to good too be true in the eyes of the authorities.
878;The Third Man has some atonishing camera work for its time, who can forget the alley scenes and the long shadows coupled with a fantastic music score that stays in your head long after the movie is over?
879;Well worth watching just to hear the musical score and watch Harry Lime come out of the shadows.
880;The pq and the aq are just brilliant.
881;once again Criterion has cleaned and polished a classic movie.
882;keep up the great work Criterion.
883;This is an outstanding movie.
884;that said, this is still a classic film that people should have in their collection.
885;The Third Man is one of the all time great classics of cinema.
886;Fascinating performances, beautiful cinematography, a delightfully unique score, and an absolutely brilliant screenplay by the great Graham Green.
887;A must for every cinephile and even casual filmgoers.
888;The cinematography was good however.
889;A best friend of a corrupt man learns of his crimes, betrays him, and finally shoots him.
890;An amazing story from Graham Greene and amazing performances by Joseph Cotton, Orson Welles, and the rest.
891;wWII is a perfect location to symbolize the moral decay the story presents, the idea of manipulating a city in ruins following war.
892;"Welles's face in the doorway remains one of the greatest film ""shocks"" in history."
893;As other reviewers have noted, the film techniques .
894;There are very many odd or striking occurances, and the characters are all sharply drawn, even the lesser ones.

897;The Austrian actors are perfect .

899;This is film Noir!The Xither music still gives me chills.
900;In the hunt for clues Holly must sacrifice some of the virtues of affection, loyalty and honesty for the sake of others.
901;each character has personal struggles to resolve which are communicated with appropriate facial expressions that sometimes tell more than the words being spoken.
902;Every actor delivers a strong character performance.
903;i long assumed the movie was directed by Orson Welles but Carol Reed deserves the credit.
904;The use of shadows to signal an unanticipated intruder is extremely well done and heightens requisite drama and suspense.
905;The progressive revelation of an anticipated character by the affectionate cat, the shoe in the doorway and finally the white of the eyes peering from the darkness is spectacular.
906;This and the underground chase are my favorite scenes though there is much more to enjoy.
907;I could not even begin to imagine this masterpiece in color.
908;if you haven't seen it before, you are in for a treat.
909;If you've seen it once, watch it again.
910;If you viewed it twice there's more joy to be discovered a third time.
911;if you are a true romantic you must have this movie.
912;Luckily many of us can enjoy both simultaneously.

914;From the stories that I was told about the black market, and from what I saw as a child, this movie captures the time and the place perfectly.
915;the story, acting and camera work are all excellent.
916;I have given this movie as a present more than once.
917;It's a bit of a masterpiece and holds the viewer in a suspended state of suspense, heightening the tensions as it moves swiftly along.
918;But these scenes will be remembered forever especially the one where he and Joseph Cotton confront each other on a moving Ferris Wheel.
919;wells and Cotton are the stars of this film but the there's another star as well.
920;And then there is the haunting original zither music by Anton Karas, which became a top hit in 1950.
921;In a way this spoiled the suspense for me.
922;Freed from that however, I was able to concentrate on the details of the directional techniques and the cinematography.
923;This film is a winner.
924;"This is Sir Carol Reed's absolutely perfect film, ""The Third Man"", about a hapless American named Holly Martins (Cotten) who comes to postwar Vienna at the invitation of an old school chum, Harry Lime."
925;Cotten does a marvelous job as a clutzy hero, trying to solve a murder nobody else believes was committed and trying also to win his school chum's girlfriend Anna (Valli) on the rebound.
926;Excellent supporting cast including Trevor Howard as Calloway, the British officer in charge of the investigation, and a wonderful foreign cast.
927;The Third Man was filmed on location among the ruins of Vienna following the Second World War, and uses very sophisticated camera work to convey a world Harley just can't master.
928;One of the best films of the 20th century, without a doubt.
929;Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles are brilliant together in a thoughtful examination of morality.
930;The Third Man is a true classic, and worthy of its vote as #57 in the AFI top 100.
931;Even over sixty years later, the story draws you in and keeps you fascinated.
932;Into this complicated mix of cultures and emotions comes Holly, an American writer of cowboy stories.
933;Holly begins to fall for Anna, and assembling together the threads of a story.
934;the characters are great, and the cinematography is brilliant.
935;The movie gets better with subsequent watchings, as you sense the hidden motives and see the subtle touches, the hiding of the photo, the playing with the dice.
936;It's a powerful view of the world, and an insight into the way the characters view the world.
937;I love the discussion about how the quiet Swiss culture produced cuckoo clocks, while the violence.
938;laden Italian culture of the Renaissance created fantastic artwork.
939;while several AFI top 100 movies are good to watch just once for historical purposes, this one is well worth owning and rewatching several times.
940;I thought the storyline was good and kept my attention.
941;And war torn Vienna (I think they actually filmed it there) was gorgeous and ravaged at the same time.
942;Amazing cast in a classic suspense thriller set in postwar Vienna.
943;Usually reliable Criterion here does a great disservice to a classic movie.
944;"The music throughout was ""The Third Man Theme"" with the zither's upbeat circus."
945;war II Vienna, hoping to live with a childhood friend Harry (Orson Wells).
946;After Orson Wells appears there is more action and interest.
947;ups and angles give the film a touch of class as the mystery unfolds.
948;My favorite film, and one of the finest ever made.
949;What's really wonderful though are the few scenes featuring Orson as the unforgettable Harry Lime, a performance that proves how much of a presence the actor truly had during his lifetime.
950;The Criterion print looks and sounds the best it possibly could for this film.
951;This transfer really shows off the lush cinematography and the amazing soundtrack for the film.
952;The bonus features are also pretty nifty, and are definitely worth a look.
953;This is a rare film that is flawless in every respect.
954;It combines great acting and memorable characters with a fascinating story, taking place in an interesting setting and adding a creative musical score.
955;The Third Man is remembered for many things .
956;for Orson Welles' wonderful performance in his appearances as Harry Lime, for its wonderfully appropriate musical score, and for its nicely conceived plot surprises.
957;Adding to these is Joseph Cotten's fine portrayal of Holly Martins, which holds the rest of it together .
958;Martins sets out at once to prove his friend's innocence, getting into an immediate scuffle with the police, and it seems at first to set up a conventional plot about clearing the name of a friend .
959;but the actual story that follows is much deeper and much better.
960;There are some great scenes (the Ferris.
961;wheel confrontation being as good a scene as there is in classic cinema) leading up to a memorable climactic sequence, and a good supporting cast, with Alida Valli as Anna being very good in complementing Lime and Martins.
962;war Vienna and the distinctive zither score go very nicely with the story.
963;this is a fine, flawless classic, and while obviously belonging to an earlier era, it deserves a look from anyone who appreciates good movies.
964;Music, casting, acting and plot are all superb and often pioneers of subsequent movies.
965;And of course Orson Wells as Harry Lime is riveting.
966;the script and direction are excellent.
967;joe Cotten is superb as Holly Martins, Trevor Howard steals every scene he's in as the wonderfully cynical Major Calloway.
968;even supporting players like Bernard Lee and Wilfrid Hyde White give wonderful performances.
969;But the star of the show has to be Orson Welles.
970;he dominates the movie and gives the best performance of a great career.
971;the ferris Wheel scene and the cat in the doorway scene(Both with Welles) are quite rightly classics.
972;The Third Man has been lovingly restored by the Criterion collection with great picture and sound and an interesting set of extras.
973;wins: Black and White cinematography.
974;i found The Third Man impressive in terms of cinematography (for which it won a well.
975;deserved Oscar), camera directions and set design but rather unemotional.
976;I thought the acting was reasonably good although nothing outstanding.
977;He is neither very clever nor good natured or charming or even good looking.
978;His relationship with Anna Smith is as passionate, moving and engaging as a toilet paper commercial.
979;It repeats the main theme way too often and draws you out of the movie which is the exact opposite of what a film score should do.
980;He packs up and goes home.
981;take a look at some of the other films I've reviewed.
982;this Studio Canal issue is the only reasonably priced BD out there right now, and it really is quite good.
983;This is a clean and clear print that does justice to the film.
984;i was quite pleased with the soundtrack as well .
985;The dialogue comes out nicely, and the musical soundtrack is very well balanced, which is to say that the zither music isn't too loud and nearing distortion levels as it often seems to when broadcast on TV.
986;There's more sweetness to the zither's tone in this version .
987;the extras are enjoyable, especially the visual tour of Vienna which takes us to many of the landmarks and neighborhoods that served as locations for the film.
988;Absolutely flawless print, and great sound makes this an unforgetable cinematic experience.
989;Great special features, including production photos, overlapping narrative by author Graham Greene, a video of Anton Karas playing the zither, and a rare radio serial of Orson Welles as Harry Lime!The first appearance of Orson Welles in this film ranks as one of the greatest in cinema.
990;Valli is beautiful, and Trevor Howard has never been better.
991;"Carol Reed directed Graham Greene's script and the result is the sort of film that still shows up on ""greatest movie"" lists 50 years later."
992;He arrives just in time to hear about Harry's funeral.
993;holly discovers Harry's girlfriend, Anna, played by the enigmatic Valli, and he discovers that Harry was one of the dirtiest and most opportunistic of the black marketeers.
994;"harry Lime is played by Orson Welles, and the part has as much ""bang for the buck"" as any in cinematic history."
995;In the accompanying documentary Peter Bogdonovich recalls speaking with Orson Welles and remarking that Harry Lime was one of the great parts of cinematic history.
996;It's a great Mr. Wu part.
997;Harry Lime is one of those characters.
998;This is one of those movies.
999;this film has several of the most famous scenes of movie history.
1000;Roger Ebert writes that the appearance of Harry Lime is the most famous entrance in cinema.
1001;The ending surprised even the actors.
1002;Go with Holly Martin and Anton Karas' famous zither score.
1003;Fall in love with Anna.
1004;Smile with Harry and take your choice .
1005;The film constructs a picture of Lime through the comments of all those who knew him.
1006;Martins remembers Lime as a loyal friend.
1007;Annas unquestioning devotion paints the picture of Lime as a romantic.
1008;He shows Martins the effects of Limes work in a hospital full of children dying from the watered.
1009;this all makes for a fun, entertaining and intriguing thriller that may be implausible, but will keep you on the edge of your seat, anticipating all the twists that keep coming!
1010;There was a British zone, and others for Americans, French, and Russian.
1011;held image of a respected friend is mirrored by Anna Schmidt, a local girl who has loved Lime and finds it just as difficult to explain away a mountain of evidence against Lime.
1012;Complicating matters is the growing love that Martins feels for her.
1013;In fact in a film filled with gripping camera work, stark imagery, and an oddly jangling musical score, Lime creates an indelible impression of how one man could take the misery of others and transform that misery into a rationale for personal gain.
1014;THE THIRD MAN is a stark and grim reminder that we must look more deeply into the souls of those who promise heaven but instead deliver damnation.
1015;the film itself is brilliant.
1016;The best way describe the viewing experience of Criterion's edition is.
1017;it's like watching a 16mm print on a rickety old projector, but with excellent sound.
1018;But if you love this film and want the best print available.
1019;Joseph Cotton delivered some great one liners.
1020;The acting, the photography, the issue at stake.
1021;there as compelling today as when the movie was released.
1022;I once heard Roger Ebert say that this was one of the ten best movies ever made.
1023;Unlike modern day Hollywood where everything is done for you, this film makes you think and really gets you involved.
1024;The way this movie builds you up to the final scenes is a thing of beauty.
1025;This movie will forever stand on it's own.
1026;Its reputation turns out to be richly deserved.
1027;The movie is a tense, taught thriller, and the music is mostly happy major.
1028;On viewing it again, I was able to better tune it out/ignore it, but ocasionally I was still conscious of it, and still disliked it.
1029;Then again, the score obviously has its fair share of supporters who love it, so your mileage may vary.
1030;that said, the plot is crisp (and rife with paranoia), the sets/locations are fantastic, and the cinemetography was awesome.
1031;This is perhaps the best black and white film I have seen that plays to the medium: use of lighting and shadows was masterful.
1032;One of the nice things, though, was a segment showing the extent of restoration done to the film.
1033;Kudos to the team that handled repairs: this restored version looks great!Highly recommended.
1034;The soundtrack is exceptional for it's period.
1035;Worth viewing especially iy you are a visitor of Vienna.
1036;That is, one of those few films everybody that loves well.
1037;Directed by Carold Reed, and based on a script written by Graham Green, this film has action and a mystery, but also some romance, and a beautiful cinematography that you cannot help but admire.
1038;"But can knowledge be a dangerous commodity in post World War II Vienna?On the whole, I think you will love this splendid noir movie, and that you will be fully immersed in the mistery of ""The third man"" as soon as you begin watching it."
1039;I can promise you something, though: you will not find it boring!Belen Alcat
1040;I love this movie, it doesn't matter how many times I see it, it possesses a mystery like none other.
1041;Beautiful photography and the zither is another character in the movie, if not the star.
1042;Every supporting actor is perfect.
1043;It captures a time in history that dominates one's sensibilities and fills one with awe and wonder.
1044;But that zither music, it's just amazing how it creates the atmosphere, maybe of a culture that just got destroyed yet has beautiful ruins about it.
1045;I don't really understand it but I truly do love it.
1046;kept me guessing up until the last minute as to what was going to happen.
1047;The transfer is fine on mine.
1048;Superb film, great story, beautifully photographed and an amazing memorable score.
1049;what I do have to complain about is the region coding.
1050;Criterion should have made these wonderful discs region.
1051;Very very pleased with transaction.
1052;I have seen some other blu ray editions of older black and white movies and they are all pretty good.
1053;This one is also pretty good, however the print as pointed out before is grainy.
1054;The film itself is one of the cinemas most influential movies and is a true classic.
1055;The underrated Joseph Cotton also shines in this movie and it's one of his best performances.
1056;This movie is a masterpiece well worth owning in your collection but you can't expect the type of blu ray clarity that a modern movie has.
1057;I was so happy to have found a copy of this older film.
1058;Anyways, The seller did everything great!
1059;This movie is a classic from the zither music down to the camera angles and the story.
1060;The movie is a classic for a very good reason, it is a great film.
1061;What it does have is a great script, superb acting, tight directing, and an excellent plot.
1062;watching it today, over half a century after it came out, I'm still struck by how much better it is than most films made today.
1063;It not only holds up well after all these years, it's still one of the best suspense films ever made.
1064;Then we are taken on an exploration of this city and important questions begin to rise: is justice possible here and what is its nature?The Third Man, in its beautiful black and white depicts a city occupied by ally forces, shaken by war, and architecturally disheveled.
1065;an important highlight is Orson Welles' role.
1066;His monologue after the ferris wheel ride is simply magnificent.
1067;This film is beautifully shot, brilliantly acted, and memorable for its tension, conflicts, philosophy, and enduring plot that holds up against anything contemporary Hollywood can put out today.
1068;This is a true classic and pillar of cinematic vision.
1069;The dialogue is distinct and the musical score sounds great.
1070;Switzerland may have only given us the cuckoo clock, but Criterion has given us a new and beautiful at one of the greatest films of all time.
1071;technically, the film is flawless in ever way.
1072;The original screenplay by Graham Greene, the breathtaking direction of Sir Carol Reed, the haunting performances of Joseph Cotton, Valli, Trevor Howard, Orson Welles, Bernard Lee, Wilfred Hyde.
1073;white, Ernst Deutsch and others, the stunning noir photography of Robert Krasker (he won the Academy Award for it), and of course the unforgettable music of Anton Karas that becomes a Greek Chorus commenting on the tragic events as they unfold.
1074;"but what really makes this film stand head and shoulders above all others is the fact that it somehow manages to function on multiple levels (psychodrama, critique on art, political commentary, loss of innocence fable, exploration of ""reality"" vs ""fantasy"", the moral grayness of the world, etc.) while remaining on the surface level, a slick, captivating Hitchcockian thriller (although Hitchcock never made anything half so complex ."
1075;the film also abounds in subtle touches, that make successive viewings rewardable.
1076;This has always been one of my favorite movies and the video was everything I'd hoped it would be.
1077;On that note this is one of the Noir classics.
1078;It's won a ton of awards, including AFI's Top 100 and Britain's Academy Awards for Best Film.
1079;The American writer's optimism and sometimes blind loyalty to his friend contrasts vividly at times with the cynical Post War gloominess of Vienna.
1080;The musical score is strangely alluring.
1081;I enjoy a good suspense movie and especially enjoy the works of Hitchcock.
1082;When I finally had an opportunity to watch The Third Man, I was prepared to be delighted, having heard so many good things about the movie.
1083;the story itself is okay, written by Graham Greene who adapted it from his own novel.
1084;This movie is written and directed so well.
1085;Many scenes stand out in my mind like the Ferris wheel, and the sewer chase.
1086;Criterion collection has made this film enjoyable.
1087;The black and white scenes work to enhance the streets and the sewer along with cinematography.
1088;This is a classic and should be watched by anyone calling themselves a movie fan.
1089;Considering a good print of this film on VHS has cost [money] for years(I bought mine 6 years ago)this is such a deal conisdering all the great extras they decided to throw in for good measure.
1090;I fell in love with this film instantly a few years ago after first viewing amd after watching this film monthly ever since it hasnt lost a touch of its energy and brilliance.
1091;I always feel that film although has a very serious subject matter of selling poisioned medicine is almost comic in its lightheartedness.
1092;Who can deny the ending in the genuine sewers of Viennia is filmmaking at its height, and yes there is and extra of newsreel footage on the sewers alone and the police that patrolled them in Viennia after WWII.
1093;People who own Criterion Collection films know better!
1094;The Bogdonavich interview, the restoration footage, the voice overs, the photos, and the radio readings are just some of the fascinating highlights of this loaded disc.
1095;The Shadows cast in the final sewer chase are just breathtaking.
1096;I've always loved this film with its amazing views of Vienna and it's artistic, stylistic cinematography.
1097;The sequence where you see Welles in the light for the first time, as well as the climax in the sewer are two of the finest individual shots in the history of film.
1098;imho Orson Wells was miscast in this otherwise good story.
1099;Worth a collection piece though, as good film noire can be tough to find.
1100;Am delighted so many classics are being produced rather lost to all of us.
1101;The black and white photography is superb.
1102;One of the best movies ever made.
1103;I want to be able to distinguish my Blu.
1104;The Third Man could be considered one of the best movies ever made.
1105;"What the others say about this movie is true
1106;This film looks wonderful on Blu.
1107;i would highly recommend this to any serious collector.
1108;The Third ManMasterly direction and the performances of Orson Welles and Alida Valli excellent"
1109;For those of you who like a mystery, this is the tops.
1110;The acting is simply superb, conveying this sense of foreboding.
1111;versa, and so the story continues.
1112;Throughout this movie the music is played by Anton Karas on the Zither.
1113;The music is hypnotic and forceful.
1114;Karas had a major hit with 'The Harry Lime' theme, and there is a clip of him playing it.
1115;This movie is great, everything went well, wonderfully directed, acted, photographed.
1116;Joseph Cotten is Lime's best friend and totally unaware of the scam.
1117;The film is one of the post war cinemas greatest acheivements.
1118;but when it comes to the subtle things, this is one of the best movies ever made.
1119;the zither music is timeless and wonderful throughout.
1120;The camera work and direction are superb.
1121;Imagine going to art gallery and hearing background music for each piece of artwork that fascinated you.
1122;The scene is just one that's like a fine art painting with movement and sound.
1123;This is one of the most feature.
1124;The Third Man was on many a list of the best films of the 20th Century and deservedly so.
1125;The suspense leading up to his appearance is palpable.
1126;Lime is, at best, a morally ambiguous character.
1127;"Incidentally, if you like that scene, you might also enjoy Anthony Mann's ""He Walked by Night."""
1128;Ok, so I love the film and bought the first Criterion Collection edition.
1129;Bought it, though, and boy am I glad.
1130;length documentary on the making of the movie which is simply amazing, extremely creative, and ultimately worth the same repeat watching as you would give the Third Man itself.
1131;This package is two brilliant feature films, in one.
1132;I am so happy I bought this re.
1133;As usual, the Criterion Collection has issued a disc with some amazing and obscure Special Features you can't find anywhere else.
1134;, enhancing the beautiful and haunting noir photography.
1135;from the unique zither score to the tilted camera angles to the perfect evocation of postwar Vienna to Harry Lime's (Orson Welles) memorable entrance, this films stands as one of the best film noir thrillers ever made, and among my top five favorite films of all time.
1136;I've watched this movie a dozen times, and it is a cinematic masterpiece.
1137;The transfer is brilliant and the film itself is a great ride.
1138;To reveal much more of the plot would be a crime, but what follows is an engaging, dark mystery that takes Martins to the heart of blackmarket Vienna, which provides a beautiful backdrop of a wrecked European city.
1139;the film's score, by Anton Karas on the Zither, is haunting and memorable.
1140;British director Carol Reed carefully crafts his story and his direction and use of light, dark, the city, and it's sewers creates a claustrophobic atmosphere that few films can match.
1141;It is easy to see why this is considered the greatest British film of the 20th century.
1142;The extras include alternate opening voiceovers, a radio play based on the adventures of Harry Lime, and commentary from other directors on the beauty of this film.
1143;It is a grand achievement.
1144;do acquaintance in Vienna, Harry Lime (Orson Wells), sends him passage to this city of possible opportunity in which Holly envisions a lot of promise.
1145;The ambiance of the book/film is that of political intrigue combined with a murder mystery.
1146;i'll summarize this film up front: Here, we have yet another bizarre film associated with Orson Wells.
1147;"And it's clear that a huge priority for Orson Wells was to focus upon his personal ""surprised."
1148;his personal vanity ultimately dominates the story.
1149;finally, I DO need to point out that Joseph Cotten's performance in this film was indeed very good.
1150;I must have seen this film a hundred times in the past forty years and seeing it restored in this Criterion Edition is like watching an entirely new film.
1151;Besides that, any which way you look at it, this is a great film.
1152;Based on Graham Greene's novel of the same name, The Third Man is suspenseful and surprising.
1153;The Third Man is without question one of the greatest movies ever made.
1154;"The black and white photography contributes greatly to the ""blackness"" of the mood created."
1155;There are two versions of tbis movie, the American and the English.
1156;My wife and I took the tour this summer, and found that it helped a great deal in understanding the movie.
1157;My wife and I love classic movies, and Joseph Cotten was great in thrillers like Shadow of a Doubt.
1158;This was also billed as a great thriller, so we had high expectations.
1159;It absolutely RUINED the impact of many scenes that might have otherwise been powerful.
1160;i think the objective of the filmmakers here was mainly to make a unique film using unorthodox or untried techniques, as a way of getting the critics' attention.
1161;It does succeed in that way, I suppose, but I think it can only be really enjoyed by film students who focus on technique instead of a story line.
1162;I found both the photo collection with explanations and the Greene treatment particularly interesting and enjoyable.
1163;In fact it is Carol Reed's masterpiece.
1164;This is a movie that is enjoyable to film buffs and to more typical modern audiences.
1165;It is a mystery with a hook and surprising plot twists, and it contains a love story, or rather a story of love unreturned.
1166;The final scene following the second funeral when Anna walks toward the camera through falling leaves is perhaps the finest example of the poetry of the cinema that I know.
1167;I understand it is a classic suspense movie, but I just couldn't appreciate it for some reason.
1168;I just watched Wages of Fear, really enjoyed that.
1169;You will rarely encounter snappier movie dialogue, and the scenes of post.
1170;world War II Vienna are fascinating, particularly the climactic chase, which takes place (mostly) down in the city's sewer system.
1171;The movie's music and title theme are distinctive and famous, played by Anton Karas on an instrument called a zither.
1172;The sound is also superb.
1173;There are many other extras as well, actually too many to remember.
1174;Bravo to Criterion for their amazing work on this classic film!
1175;If you haven't yet eperienced Carol Reed's best work, do so now.
1176;orson Wells' entrance alone is worth the price of admission.
1177;Will return it and ask for a refund!
1178;"Film slipped alot and was ""fuzzy"" on the top."
1179;This is the good old days when movies had writng involved.
1180;Got to see The Power and the glory someday.
1181;If you are a movie buff you will love this movie.
1182;Creative cinematography and an interesting cast leaves indelible imagery and memorable characters long after viewing.
1183;Well worth watching this one!
1184;being a big fan I had to see what it was about.
1185;Professor's Comment: Great artistic performance and splendid cinematographic assets on a borning and very simple subject.
1186;A classical reference reflecting the evolution of movie making.
1187;it's extremely entertaining, it has a deep moral base, the acting is superb, it's visually awesome, and the music is like none other you've ever heard.
1188;I just want to add my vote to this totally satisfying film.
1189;The movie is preserved and a faithful adaptation of Graham Greene's novel.
1190;Welles gives a signature performance in his role and as a director an even better performance.
1191;It's really good and the music is terrific.
1192;The Criterion Collection manages to do it again and yet again.
1193;What a superb transfer of this film noir gem!
1194;The movie is superb, period.
1195;Need I say something more.
1196;But what makes this Criterion treat all the more special is a special digital transfer, an introspection on Carol Reed, multiple trailers, and so many other extras.
1197;The Third Man does have that, but also a lot more that modern audiences will still love!The story is that a fiction novelist travels to Europe to meet up with an old friend named Harry Lime.
1198;"Nope, instead ""The Third Man"" relies on a sensible screenplay (written by Graham Greene) and filmmaking of the highest class."
1199;white films much, but this movie's use of shadows and darkness brings an unusual clarity and suspense to the picture.
1200;The musical score is seductive and captivating (I believe a viola or zither of some sort is the key instrument).
1201;There is a love story that isn't melodramatic, but subtle and romantic.
1202;"Lime's girlfriend is a compelling character, and is everything Bergman's ""Casablanca"" character should've been."
1203;The dialogue is sharp, poignant, and sometimes humorous.
1204;And most of all, the chase and suspense sequences work perfectly!
1205;As for the Extras, they're all pretty good.
1206;Peter Bogdanovich's 5 minute introduction is pleasant to listen to.
1207;of documentary is very good.
1208;"The two commentary tracks are also excellent: one's by Steven Soderbergh (""Traffic"") and writer Tony Gilroy (the ""Bourne"" movies) which is more reflective and congratualatory ."
1209;insightful and easy to follow.
1210;That's the one everyone remembers, but in truth Graham Greene, a wry British post.
1211;This film is as good a European Film Noir as you'll find.
1212;The film glides effortlessly till the ending in the sewers under Vienna.
1213;Nothing is what it seems and Cotton is soon involved in international intrigue.
1214;gooders are not easy to complete without created cardboard characters, but there's no need to fear for The Third Man is damn near perfect, one of the best films ever made.
1215;ray edition of this great British film, not of the film itself.
1216;ray of an old classic, one of hundreds in the Criterion Collection catalog.
1217;ray will make the same difference with old films as it does with films made in the more recent past.
1218;Home video has progressed quite a bit in the past decade, especially with the advent of blu.
1219;ray truly makes a difference with old films.
1220;time exterior shots look quite good, the graininess in the close.
1221;Interesting to observe the changes between that and the final cut.
1222;I was really pleased to be able to get my hands on this movie now that it has been discontinued.
1223;This is great movie making that proves you don't need excess violence to create suspense.
1224;"A classic tale of suspense and intrigue set in post WWll Vienna, ""The Third Man,"" directed by Carol Reed, stars Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles."
1225;delivered in a conversational tone that is in itself unique compared to the usual cinematic narrative form.
1226;filled suspense begins to build from the moment Martins arrives, and is maintained by Reed until the denouement.
1227;beyond, right up until the final frame of the film.
1228;Outstanding performances, combined with the stark black white photography (for which cinematographer Robert Krasker won an Oscar).
1229;enhanced by Reed's artistic handling of the camera and his use of light and shadows.
1230;driven score by Anton Karas, makes this one of the most memorable mysteries ever filmed.
1231;cotton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as Martins, which provides a solid foundation upon and around which the mystery surrounding Lime develops.
1232;When he does appear, Welles embodies him in such a way that the mystique of this man that has been so cleverly and acutely developed is effectively maintained.
1233;Welles, in fact, with his naturally dominating countenance was the perfect choice to play Lime, and he certainly delivers.
1234;His few scenes with Cotton, especially one that takes place on a ferris wheel (which offers a telling perspective into Lime's character), are the most memorable of the entire film.
1235;"cotton's performance, however, is the real thread that holds it all together, and as Martins, he demonstrates his generosity as an actor
1236;The same can be said, as well, for the effectiveness with which the mystery of the woman in Lime's life, Anna (Alida Valli), is established.
1237;Again, Martins becomes the sounding board through which Valli's character reverberates so convincingly.
1238;Her performance is strong, but her interaction with Cotton allows her Anna to shine all the more brightly.
1239;It's a perfect example of having all the elements that go into the making of a film working together to produce a true classic in every sense of the word.
1240;The purity of the film is inspiring"
1241;"In the final analysis, this is simply a truly exceptional film
1242;Orson Wells got top billing in this Vienna thriller from 1949.
1243;As quick as he can blink, Harry disappears and the chase is off thru the beautiful streets of Vienna.
1244;This is a film Hitchcock would have loved to have his name on.
1245;This black white film is beautifully shot.
1246;lighting, intense shadows, old classic European architecture in the background, a larger than life ferris wheel, great cast, great acting.
1247;and a movie filled with suspense, love, and a whole lot of deception.
1248;but, Wells has such a huge presence on the screen that he steals the show almost every time.
1249;As good as Wells is here, I still believe Cotton's performance is equally on par with Wells.
1250;The extras include original trailers, old footage of the real sewer police in action, Third Man radio broadcast, and the treatment of the film being remastered showing before and after examples of photos and movie footage.
1251;'The 3rd Man' is a wonderful who.
1252;It is a gritty slice of life of European existence right after World War II.
1253;Too bad, since this is a great film.
1254;This is one of my fond childhood memories, and I sure enjoy it as an adult.
1255;Anyway, back to """"The Third Man"""", That was a great movie too."""
1256;The actors were great and so was the music.
1257;The score capturing every nuance of the cinematography with sound.
1258;This is a movie worth viewing many times.
1259;Good copy from a good print.
1260;A great performance by Orson Wells.
1261;"Well,Criterion has another release triumph here with ""The Third Man""."
1262;to top this all off is a 26 page booklet with several articles about the making and producing of the film which are quite intriguing,along with production credits,transfer specs,cast credits and much more.
1263;i won't go into the plot as it is very well known by most by now.
1264;they made a great transfer using a high grain positive master and took out thousands of extant marks,dirt,etc, to bring the print gloriously back to life.
1265;"i've always said that a great print can only add to ones enjoyment of a film and the proof is abundantly clear in this ""pudding""."
1266;"a classic of its' genre,""The Third Man"" is without doubt a very important film."
1267;The Third Man (Carol Reed, 1949)Pauline Kael once said of Citizen Kane that it was the most fun you'd ever have watching a great film.
1268;"but for me, its recipient has always been Carol Reed's The Third Man, one of the many fine Graham Greene adaptations that's made its way to the screen (there are some authors whose work seems almost immune from being destroyed by bad adaptations, and Greene may well be one of them
1269;No less an august body than the BFI called The Third Man the best British film ever produced.
1270;And for the record, they're Richard Eyre's Iris (#11), Alan Parker's Pink Floyd: The Wall (#33), and Harry Bromley Davenport's XTRO (#36).
1271;It's a movie that has everything"
1272;He manages to get to the funeral just in time, where he finds himself embroiled in a game of cat and mouse involving a couple of stiff.
1273;"But The Third Man is, as far as I can tell, unique in the way Reed unfolds the story
1274;It's Reed's visual language that takes this out of the realm of the good and into the realm of the spectacular.
1275;There's a reason is shows up in those best.
1276;ever TV shows all the time"
1277;The entire movie is chock full of incredible images like this.
1278;And if you happen to get caught up in the engrossing story and wowed by the acting, well, that's just icing on the cake sometimes.
1279;Graham Greene could turn out a mystery like no other, and The Third Man began the golden age of Carol Reed's career (aside from collaborating once again with Greene on the other best Greene adaptation ever, Our Man in Havana, he was also responsible for such classics as Trapeze, Oliver!
1280;One of the hundred best films ever made.
1281;One of the most striking generic traits of film noir is its iconography of the city.
1282;Distortion is produced through tilting of the camera lens and the expressive use of lighting.
1283;The theme music by Anton Karras is one of my favourites.
1284;"This is one of my all time 3 favorite films along with ""Casablanca"" and ""Chinatown""."
1285;this is though a minor quibble about a truly great film.
1286;Whether you are a student of film history or just like a beautifully made black and white thriller, this is a must see movie by one of the greats.
1287;One could make an exceptionally good case for this being the best film ever made by a British production company.
1288;Certainly, it is at worse one of the very best.
1289;Indeed, this film is a succession of stunning images and scenes: the first time we see Harry Lime (Orson Welles), lurking in the shadows of a doorway, hands in pockets, an ambiguous, almost apologetic yet amused smile.
1290;"The extraordinary ""Cuckoo Clock"" speech that Harry delivers as he and Holly ride the Ferris Wheel high above the ""ants"" below."
1291;"The unforgettable as Anna Schmidt (Valli) walks towards and then past Holly as Anton Karas plays utterly unforgettable zither piece known today as ""The Third Man"" theme."
1292;an enormous amount of great talent was involved in this picture, and nearly all were at the height of their powers.
1293;Graham Greene produced one of the great scripts the movies has seen, about an hack writer who has arrived in post.
1294;In talking with various friends, the friend, Holly Martins, discovers that the various stories told about Lime don't quite mesh with one another.
1295;Joseph Cottons turned in perhaps the finest performance in his career as the good natured, but always.
1296;Orson Welles was never better as an actor than he was in this film as the enigmatic Harry Lime, managing to be both thoroughly charismatic and completely reprehensible at the same time.
1297;Many, many of the minor characters turn in memorable performances.
1298;This is unfortunate, because he was a truly first rate director with many very fine movies to his credit (among which I do not include the hard.
1299;At any rate, regardless of the amount of attention his work as a whole received, this film incontestably remains one of the truly great films in the history of cinema.
1300;The Third Man is a flawless film of intrigue and suspense, a summit of perfection within the genre.
1301;It is one of the most literate thrillers ever made.
1302;It is superb1y acted by an ensemble working in an understated, effortless style.
1303;Its cinematography includes some of the best black.
1304;Rarely has a motion picture represented the collaboration of so many exceptional talents.
1305;The Third Man may be the greatest film made in Britain since World War II.
1306;"the night city terrain of ""The Third Man"" is unique: occupied postwar Vienna, baroque, bombed."
1307;these characters wander through rain.
1308;Its streets are always damp, and water rushes through a system of sweet.
1309;The Third Man meets the test of complexity.
1310;He is also capable of providing suspense in the tradition of Hitchcock.
1311;The Third Man is unique in the genre for its realism.
1312;Despite the complexities of plot, the characters are understandable, dimensional, emotionally genuine.
1313;a tribute to the fine ensemble playing and special, low.
1314;carol Reed was knighted for his excellence as a British filmmaker, and for a body of work that is notable for its good taste.
1315;Great picture with amazing use of shadowing and natural city elements.
1316;This has been one my favorite movies since the first time I saw it, and the years have not diminished its impact.
1317;Carol Reed's direction, the uniformly fine acting, the cinematography are all of the highest caliber.
1318;Even the sound is perfect, including the disorienting zither music.
1319;If you have never seen this movie, or if you've only seen the version which has been presented on American Movie Classics, I urge you to see this beautifully restored edition.
1320;One of the many charms of this movie is the wonderful atmosphere of post.
1321;Film buffs have a reason to celebrate.
1322;regarded film in world cinema is now available in a jaw.
1323;I doubt Carol Reed ever saw it in such a pristine condition!
1324;And the retro mono sound is sharp.
1325;This ultimate edition deserves a special place in the digital library.
1326;It is a tale that, on the surface, is about love, deception and murder.
1327;The dark trinity of great noir mysteries.
1328;but it is not so much the plot that makes this remarkable film so highly.
1329;regarded but rather the extraordinary sense of time and place.
1330;There's the brilliant black and white photography by Robert Krasker .
1331;And the audacious zither score by Anton Karas perfectly frames the mood and atmosphere of this unforgettable film that somehow burns itself into one's own experience.
1332;How do we know what's real and true and good?
1333;But whatever existential metaphors are embedded in the film, it is a hypnotically compelling exercise that is much more than the sum of it's masterful parts.
1334;Unquestionably a great film as well as art.
1335;the extras are generous and defined in the product description.
1336;As my title says, it is unforgettable.
1337;One of the best Orson Wells Films, black and white suberb movie,A classic film about cold war spying you have not to pass!Collectors Item!
1338;I found this movie overrated.
1339;It masterfully builds suspense wanting to find out who this Harry Lime character really is.
1340;Perhaps it works better on the big screen.
1341;By quite a margin, the best film ever made!
1342;From its location, cast andutterly captivating music score .
1343;this is the director, Carol Reed's undoubted masterpiece.
1344;Truly, one of the best films of it's genre, ever made.
1345;When you consider the year in which it was made, it is even more impressive.
1346;a wonderful man by almost everyone's estimate.
1347;His best friend, Holly Martin [Joseph Cotton], can hardly believe that such a great man has died in such an ordinary way, starts a one.
1348;there's a mysterious beautiful woman.
1349;The effects of lighting and angle are superb.
1350;This depersonalization of human beings plays into the film.
1351;'See those dots down there [meaning people].
1352;'The last scene, by the way, is very 'unHollywood' and is one of the great scenes in cinema.
1353;At least one reviewer distinguishes between film and movie, and this has to be considered a film.
1354;It's only days (or maybe weeks, or maybe years) later that you recognize, this was a great film, one of the few to call great.
1355;While watching it, it's just entertainment.
1356;just good crisp black and white with details in the shadows and no distractions from streaks or scratches.
1357;The Third Man must be ranked with Double Indemnity as the finest film noir ever made.
1358;It is an astonishing movie.
1359;The music is the first thing that catches and holds the attention of the viewer.
1360;At times the music dominates and controls the mood and enhances suspense as the story unfolds.
1361;the underrated Joseph Cotten (Holly Martins) has more screen time than any other actor and he does a creditable job anchoring the story line.
1362;The beautiful and mysterious Alida Valli loves Welles and to the end stays true to him.
1363;In one of the most creative and effective endings in the history of the movies, we watch and wonder what Valli will do as she leaves the cemetery that begins and ends the film.
1364;Like Cotton, we watch her as she approaches us.
1365;"This is a ""noir""
1366;i had seen The Third Man once before and thought I knew the story line.
1367;Perhaps because I had some remembrance of what was going to happen next, I was able to focus my attention on the skill of Carol Reed in telling his story.
1368;Perfection is the operative word for this magnificent film.
1369;Warner Bros. and Sony are doing outstanding work in releasing their classic catalog in ways that respect the classics that they are and you come up with this?
1370;the famous theme music and gorgeous photography of old vienna and of lovely Valli , as she is billed here, are only part of the story.
1371;watch also for the humor, provided by several wonderful character actors, especially the absolutely delicious wilfred hyde.
1372;white, with his impeccable comic timing.
1373;also, this film makes fun of itself, with several references to its similarity to a pulp western.
1374;and lots of other memorable moments.
1375;this is a film to enjoy many times over the years.
1376;by the way, for trivia buffs, .
1377;Graham Greene is one of the most acclaimed authors of the 20th century, and, unlike many such literary talents, he recognized the merits of film, and took work as a screenwriter for the British film industry, including several collaborations with producer/director Carol Reed, of which """"The Third Man"""" is the most famous."""
1378;It is also the high.
1379;"watermark for director/producer Reed, though he would only earn his Best Director Oscar some two decades later with the musical ""Oliver!"""
1380;The Third Man is one of the great achievements in film noir, and, perhaps, in film in general.
1381;the movie has several great performances, starting with Cotten as the 'very American' (in the worlds of Peter Bogdanovich) lead man, Alida Valli as Anna, Trevor Howard as Calloway, and an enjoyable comic turn from Bernard Lee (later M to the Connery, Lazenby, and Moore incarnations of James Bond) as Calloway's batman, a sergeant who is quite a fan of Holly's writing.
1382;This is an outstanding version of Graham Green's novel.
1383;Good performances by Cotton and Wells plus a very good supporting cast.
1384;I got this for a friend who loves this old movie.
1385;It was with great anticipation that I viewed The Third Man recently.
1386;the film is a surreal examination of the tension between loyalty, love, and friendship on the one hand, and truth and justice on the other.
1387;The American writer of simple westerns still is nave enough to care about friendship and truth, and follows both wherever they lead.
1388;ups of faces exaggerate their features.
1389;If you are a lover of cinema and not merely of movies, please get this classic.
1390;It richly deserves its reputation.
1391;He questions the porter at Line's apartment (Paul Horburger) who may have an opinion but is murdered before he can share it.
1392;orson Welles is excellent as the charismatic but poisonous Lime but the inflation of Welles reputation does rather lead to his contribution being overrated.
1393;Joseph Cotton was Welles' superior as an actor and Carol Reed, at his best, was something close to Welles' equal as a director.
1394;And as a writer Graham Greene really had no equal, this wonderfully murky, morally complex tale, being the most successful of many attempted translations of his dark imagination to the screen, with its magnificently intelligent and effective dialogue.
1395;Indeed it's almost impossible to fault this gem of a movie.
1396;The film was shot entirely on location, a choice the director had to battle intensely with the studio over.
1397;This was critically important to the entire character of the film, and is a rare documentation of the true destruction in Europe in a post war Hollywood film.
1398;The beleaguered city surrounds the characters in the film and adds to the depth of our understanding of them.
1399;the black and white cinematography and style of this film might remind the viewer of Citizen Kane.
1400;some call Orson Welles' mysterious entrance in The Third Man the greatest in all of film.
1401;Still, Welles' performance in The Third Man is easily equal to that of Citizen Kane, despite being a significantly smaller role.
1402;holly is something of a mirror image of Lime.
1403;In America Holly is a writer of pulp mystery and western novels and is well known even in Europe.
1404;Holly represents the innocence and relative naivet of America in his misunderstanding of the conflicting interests Lime and so many others in Europe surely faced both during and after the war.
1405;This easily one of the best movies ever made.
1406;The original is very good, though.
1407;ray version was fine, and the black.
1408;white cinematography absolutely apt for this story, set in bombed.
1409;"This offends Martins' narrative sense, and so he sets out to find ""the truth."""
1410;the big set piece of the movie is a climactic chase through the sewers of Vienna, a tense and marvelously filmed sequence, but I was drawn more to the restraint of the movie.
1411;There is some humor too: what looks like a car.
1412;and yet a sense of menace is communicated that fits in with the overall tone.
1413;One of the five greatest espionage stories ever filmed: Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten playing mental chess with each other, the superior script, and direction.
1414;"Everyone's seen war stories
1415;and keeps you entertained (that theme!)
1416;The movie doesn't even really need an audience, because it finds its own story much more interesting than I ever thought it was.
1417;The Third Man is the exciting and suspenseful European response to film noir, a genre often associated with America.
1418;Its visuals and narrative follow what we have come to expect from your typical noir, but its thematic content and musical score are distinctly European.
1419;this is a surprisingly efficient film, packing in a lot of plot for just a 100.
1420;The fast pacing keeps us engaged and fully immersed in the action taking place.
1421;The Third Man strikes a wonderful balance between European intellectual film and the excitement of an American noir.
1422;In my opinion this is Orson Welles at his best.
1423;Do you know those times when a musical score helps to define a movie and does it so well that the movie and its music become intertwined?
1424;It's also a movie for the ages.
1425;Soon a sinister plot emerges that involves a British officer, a mysterious girlfriend, and the demands of a desperate local black market economy.
1426;It's been said that Orson Welles first appearance in the film is the greatest entrance of a villian in cinema history.
1427;I'm not sure if that's entirely true but I will admit that his speech in the Ferris wheel is jarringly insightful .
1428;One of the great films!
1429;The subject, as well as the acting and direction gualify it as a must see classic.
1430;The creative use of shadow and sound in this film make it an example of the best in black and white film art.
1431;The plot is rich and the characters are classic film noir.
1432;It is a must have for artistic value as well as entertainment content.
1433;It will remain a favorite for years to come.
1434;heralded as a masterpiece, the only thing masterful about this movie is it does a good job of expressing the point of view of persons who think other persons who are moral, normal and physically plain make for a dreary world, while persons who are physically attractive, street.
1435;smart, daring, and often, morally compromised, make the world interesting, and life worth living.
1436;People who reject Christ's words look for ways to make life worthwhile, and many of them settle for all.

1438;the """"masterly"""" technique used here is simple ."""
1439;As she grows more striking, hapless Holly begins to look more and more the rube.
1440;eventually Harry, played by Orson Wells, is introduced to the audience.
1441;The audience, now panting for a male protagonist worthy of the fascinating female is refreshed with a long cool drink when Wells lights up the screen.
1442;Problem is, Harry, Well's character, is a deeply morally.
1443;He has the blood of hundreds, perhaps even thousands of innocent people, including small children, on his hands.
1444;He is also the woman's former lover.
1445;Harry, on the other hand, may be responsible for the death of infants, but doggonit, he is fascinating, and wouldn't he be exciting to have sex with him.
1446;something member of the opposite sex, packing a hidden STD.
1447;Voted the best British film of the 20th century, and regarded as the best film ever filmed in Vienna, The Third Man was the first of its kind in many ways: filmed in 1949, it was the first British film shot largely on location, it was also the first to focus on a single musician rather than an orchestra for its soundtrack.
1448;There is also a video introduction by director Peter Bogdanovich.
1449;"bogdanovich, in his intro, calls it the best ""non."
1450;Carol Reed is underrated, probably because his last films weren't so fantastic.
1451;Great black and white photography, the real star of the film, showing the wetness of the stones.
1452;"Name me one great performance in colour, I defy you."""
1453;The film is called daring and fast cutting, and Bogdanovich recommends the In Search of the Third Man book.
1454;Oh, I want to tell you about Holly Martens.
1455;"(man's voice) ""The Third Man ."
1456;The documentary shows cool morphs from modern Vienna to scenes form the movie, such as the cat scene, and the 300 km of sewers.
1457;There are also four very important lines cut from the end of the film:.
1458;Who Was The Third Man is a documentary in German by Austria's Wien.
1459;kanal, it starts with a jazz intro with the theme song.
1460;There's footage of Paul Horbinger talking about the film in 1979, and more discussion about the soundtrack.
1461;For the first recording, all that Anton Karas did was a first take, and for the first recording all he got was a blue suit, he was happy.
1462;Then there is a nice final shot of the long walk .
1463;"another documentary is Graham Greene: The Hunted Man, A 1968 profile of Graham Greene with Christopher Burnstall, which touches on nearly all of his work up until that point except for ""The Third Man""."

1465;Beginning and ending of a project is clear in its framework, then there's the mountain range in between the two and a hope for surprises.
1466;extras: Anton Karas in London, a snippet, beautiful, hypnotic.
1467;Orson Welles is always associated with Citizen Kane but even though his appearance is brief in the Third man as Harry Lime, he leaves a profound impact.
1468;Ruin and commerce, entertainment and love and just making do.
1469;With story and drama so good, you don't notice the stars.
1470;I bet you won't, but you'll enjoy it anyway.
1471;The black and white is beautifully done.
1472;Probably one of the best films ever made.
1473;this film is a great movie and has remained popular to this day.
1474;The signature piece of music the Harry Lime Theme is inarguably the most famous piece of music written for the zither.
1475;the Lux radio theater adaptation of the film, and an episode of the Harry Lime series based on the film.
1476;Cotten and Welles are a great on screen duo and give outstanding performances.
1477;The bonus features include a great comparison of the original English version and the American version of this classic.
1478;The amount of material on this disc is amazing considering it was made over 50 years ago.
1479;Six stars, if I could give it.
1480;Graham Greene's script, the acting, Anton Karas' compelling music, and Carroll Reed's directing come together in one of the great films of all time.
1481;Contributing to the film's tension and dynamic is Robert Krasky's stunning cinematography.
1482;In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and peace, and what did they produce?
1483;like Citizen Kane, this film deals with money and power, shattered idealism, and an elusive figure everyone knows *of* yet few people know.
1484;And last but not least, like Kane, it stars the great Joseph Cotten.
1485;the Third Man benefits enormously from being shot in post.
1486;"The locations are a ""star"" as much as any of the human players."
1487;He objected to the zither music.

1494;There are some extras, such as footage of Anton Karas performing on his unique instrument, documentary footage of the real Vienna sewers, the original trailer, the rerelease trailer, the alternate American opening, and fascinating production photos and commentary.
1495;Director Carol Reed's The Third Man , is a brilliant, stylish masterpiece that is often mentioned among the greatest films ever made.
1496;From then on, it's suspense, memorable characters and brilliance till the end.
1497;The Third Man is outstanding in so many aspects, but it's mostly remembered for a few things.
1498;Its use of tilted camera shots is a great little touch that really adds a lot.
1499;And of course there's the zither music, the cinematography and the look of post.
1500;The Third Man is full of classic scenes from Orson Welles' famous entrance to the scene with Orson and Joseph on Vienna's Giant Wheel to the tense and atmospheric ending in the sewers.
1501;It's a classic, no doubt about it, and its one of the greatest movies ever made.
1502;It's heartening to see that more and more classic films are being released in the Blu.
1503;ray format, which offers a crisp, sharp, High Definition picture and greater clarity of sound.
1504;one of the film's most memorable features is its all.
1505;In addition, the movie features a beautifully staged chase sequence that leads to the city's sewer system.
1506;The photography by Robert Krasker in this sequence is especially impressive, as long shots with bright light sources just out of sight throw elongated, distorted shadows, a characteristic of film noir.

1509;THE THIRD MAN is a classic tale of suspense and betrayal with a terrific performance from Orson Welles and one of the most unusual film scores ever.
1510;That is definitely the version to get and I am really looking forward to it.
1511;The film is one of my all.
1512;The movie was terrific, great story and performances.
1513;look at all the old films that tranfer beautifully!
1514;This is a magnificent article in almost perfect state.
1515;Very well done, and as good as when I watched it the first time, so many years ago.
1516;The second disc with all the extra stuff is so interesting, and just seeing how Caroll Reed made the movie, right after the war, is fascinating.

1518;reed's superb camerawork and beautiful, dark cinematography present a Vienna that is off.
1519;When coupled with a truly unique zither score, the combination of these elements give the viewer very unsettling and disturbing feelings, haunting you with questions as you try to figure out what has happened and why.
1520;as far as cinema goes, Orson Welles gives one of the best performances as a villain ever with Harry Lime.
1521;He created a character with as big a presence as Welles himself had, and that guy was BIG!
1522;Lime is right up there and belongs in the upmost echelon of evil.
1523;this is for my money one of the greatest movies ever made.
1524;Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) makes it his new agenda to find out what has happened to his friend, and is lead down wrong paths by the police captain, Lime's underworld connections, and Lime's partner, Anna Schmidt.
1525;this film is considered a classic for the way it uses shadow and sets to create suspense.
1526;Anton Karas creates the tense atmosphere with his famous zither score.
1527;The film won an Academy Award in 1951 for Best Cinematography, and this is best shown in the climatic sewer scenes.
1528;Included are such features as a photo gallery from oringinal production, trailers from both 1949 and the 1999 cinema re.
1529;It has mystery, excellent dialogue"
1530;Orson Welles plays the perfect role of Harry Lime, the primary character that the movie is all about.
1531;Alida Valli plays a superbly charming Anna Schmidt.
1532;on top of all of this, there is an amazing moodiness to this movie in both the lighting, music, and acting.
1533;a movie I watch all the time, it is one that has to be with your collection.
1534;From the very first notes of the ubiquitous Harry Lime Theme this film seduces with a combination of rich characterization, humor, action, and a plot that will have you going 'round in circles the first time you see it.
1535;I say first time because this is a keeper, it's a film you need to watch more than once.
1536;It's a film to be watched often, and shared with friends.
1537;it's a quirky piece, possibly the best film ever made by Carol Reed.
1538;The style pays some homage to German Expressionism in its starkness and odd angles.
1539;But all technical blather aside, what you have here is a story about loyalty, and the layers of a man's personality.
1540;One of my favorite movies with Orson Welles.
1541;Story is still great to this day.
1542;I'm not a huge fan of classical movies, but this is a great script and was shot well.
1543;On top of that a great addition to a book lover is the book version of this movie in audio form to go with the movie.
1544;"disc version which said, ""There have been few better movies in the history of the planet than The Third Man,"" well, that, of course, was convincing enough, right?"
1545;You've got to be kidding.Yeah, the cinematography is great, and film.
1546;And hey, it's beautifully lit.
1547;It was all so nicely, although somewhat dimly, lit down there.
1548;the fiftieth anniversary edition which I have has an interesting little featurette showing actual film footage of those sewers, and yes, I'm right, they're pitch black.
1549;Quite frankly, the way these scenes are, it's pure movie fantasyland.
1550;The main character is a dope who is a dope throughout.
1551;She's like a walking zombie when we first meet her, and she ends the same way (great shot though).
1552;Same mustache and with a good cigar.
1553;"He calls the dopes into his office to play, ""You Bet Your Life"":""Now Mr. Martins, say the magic word and you win a trip back home."
1554;a lot of reviewers rave about Orson Welles in this flick.
1555;Yes, he's got that wry Welles smile.
1556;I've read some saying there's layers of intrigue in this film.
1557;I'll tell you, that's what this film is about and I wouldn't doubt that it's one of the main reasons the movie made it to the top of the BFI's Best of the 20th Century list.
1558;The subconscious, after all, is a great ruler over our sense of pleasure.
1559;Try and address one of my complaints, maybe.
1560;April 16, 2002Yeah, that's right, 'The Third Man' is on my personal listof favorites that are commonly overlooked.
1561;it's no small trick making a movie that is quaint, charming,dramatic, and utterly perfect all at the same time.
1562;As forbeing utterly perfect, who or what in the heck can everarrange for that last commodity to come to a film?
1563;Joseph Cotton is wonderful as Holly Martins, an out of work writer of pulp cowboy novels who finds out from an old friend about a job that has opened up for him in 1948 Vienna Austria.
1564;The intoxicating atmosphere of this film noir gem owes much to the musical score laid down by zither virtuoso Anton Karas, as well as iconic scenes made possible by Vienna landmarks.
1565;There is also the intrigue of a city partitioned by the Allied powers in the fashion of Berlin.
1566;Carol Reed is the true hero.
1567;He made three or four outstanding films .
1568;'The Third Man' is easily the most popular.
1569;And it remains the film that seemed to capture the mood of post.
1570;All of this is ancient history, and yet 'The Third Man' remains wonderfully evocative.
1571;This film certainly has enough top reviews here, hence there is little reason to discuss storyline intricacies.
1572;Third Man has to rank in the top 50 films ever made and certainly it is in my top ten.
1573;5* for directing, 5* for cinematography, 5* for acting,One more proof that old classics are mach better then new best.
1574;Cool thing that what is considered as THE finest American film ever made (Citizen Kane) and THE finest British film ever made (The Third Man) both star Orson Welles AND Joseph Cotton.
1575;Lo and behold it arrived on Christmas Eve and I was able to give it as a present!
1576;Among the films I allow people to wake me up for at all hours, The Third Man certainly belongs.
1577;It is one of those movies that I've seen dozens of time and every time I was in awe of the beauty of it in every way.
1578;there are so many marvelous facets to this diamond, that it's hard where to begin.
1579;Graham Green wrote the original story and collaborated on the movie script as well, together with legendary Alexander Korda and rumor has it that even Welles himself had his input.
1580;the use of the camera and lighting is incredibly beautiful and one of the most magnificent examples of black.
1581;white photography, supreme film noir splendor.
1582;the acting is phenomenal of the entire cast, especially the main trio Welles, Cotten and Alida Valli.
1583;not much left to say except, just watch and enjoy and experience true movie magic.
1584;Carol Reed's The Third Man is his best known film, it was ground.
1585;breaking for many reasons, and it is one of the finest and most influential of all Film Noir classics.
1586;One of its hallmarks is the exceptional camera work by cinematographer Robert Krasker, for which he won an Oscar.
1587;It is one of the very few films in which a single instrument carries the entire score.
1588;Alida Valli portrays beautifully Welles' illegal actress.
1589;Old Vienna is wrapped in mystery and fog, full of suspicious people and suspenseful moments.
1590;The final chase through the sewers is among the most classic scenes in all of cinema.
1591;even though Reed did not receive the Oscar for Best Director for his masterpiece, he did win the Cannes Film Grand Prix, and proved his genius as a director.
1592;(1968), would again attract the public, and Oscar .
1593;this time with eleven nominations, taking home five including Best Picture and Best Director.
1594;Despite being in Black and White it captured my imagination.
1595;The best set ever, the real thing!
1596;Set in Vienna in 1947, filmed in Vienna in 1949, beautifully filmed, beautifully acted, Joseph Cotten, Valli, Trevor Howard and Orson Welles are all in great form.
1597;Oh and the music by Anton Karas is genius!
1598;carol Reed's brilliant film of Graham Greene's post.
1599;That transfer was crisp looking with considerable repair work done in the digital realm to the film while the transfer itself was sharper with solid blacks, great fine detail considering the age of the film and grain management wasn't over.
1600;"The Criterion had among other things a 90 minute excellent doucmentary that ""shadowed"" the making of this terrific film as well as the original treatment by Greene, a radio episode of Welles' excellent series ""The Lives of Harry Lime"", two exceptional audio commentaries for the film and press booklet materials and an hour program on writer Graham Greene."
1601;tHIS edition has an excellent commentary track featuring Welles biographer and actor Simon Callow along with assistant director Guy Hamilton and script supervisor Angela Allen.
1602;"It's a fairly lively and entertaining commentary track that covers everything from Greene's original script, issues they had shooting on location to working with Welles and Cotton (and disspelling some myths about Welles ""directing"" his own scenes)."
1603;It's the best special feature here and kudos to StudioCanal/Lion's Gate for assembling it.
1604;ray, this edition is a good second choice.
1605;still recommended but if you have the Criterion.
1606;He naively plunges into the morally ambiguous world of Vienna.
1607;the perfect answer to the Hollywood ending that has wrecked many films that otherwise may have been great.
1608;I call it a good, though not wise, investment.
1609;the Third Man is a rare perfect marriage of performances, cinematography and music.
1610;Cotten is excellent in his role as Martins, while the rest of the supporting cast (Especially Valli as Lime's ex.
1611;The Oscar winning cinematography of Robert Krasker is superb in the way it brings to life the darkness of Vienna.
1612;It brings a sense of depth and realism to the movie.
1613;A viewer feels like putting their hand on screen and touching the water soaked walls.
1614;But what the movie is probably best known for is Anton Karas's Zither score.
1615;Sometimes the music is happy and cheerful and other times we feel a sense of sorrow.
1616;The sound is perfectly clear.
1617;The supplements are also excellent.
1618;There are production notes that cover many aspects of filming the movie and have some interesting trivia.
1619;There is also an interview with director Peter Bogdanovich and an alternate opening voice over for the American release.
1620;they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce?
1621;A web of mystery, a begrimed adventure winding through shadow then light and back into shadow.
1622;She loved Harry and she morns his allure.
1623;The story unwinds compelling him to stay and discover that truth and justice take on a greater meaning.
1624;this is a great film with such atmosphere that old Vienna is a main character.
1625;Graham Green's great story and screenplay, Carol Reed directing at his finest and the best cinematography by Robert Krasker.
1626;the most famous line in the film is from Harry Lime (Welles) who, self.
1627;In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and peace.
1628;Orson Welles was a genius at adapting and creating films and radio broadcasts.
1629;He was also a great actor.
1630;Anyone who has net yet seen this cinematic masterpiece is in for a rare treat.
1631;The Third Man is both a brilliant achievement from the standpoint of superb black and white photography, with an Oscar being won in that category by cameraman Robert Krasker,and in dramatic storytelling with British fiction great Graham Greene delivering the premier screenplay of his notable career.
1632;American Holly Martens, played with an appropriate bumbling innocence by normally suave Joseph Cotten, leaves his middle class existence as a pulp fiction writer of westerns to fly to Vienna after an invitation from his longstanding friend, Harry Lime, played with a colorful ruthlessness by Orson Welles, to join him in a business enterprise.
1633;Eventually he learns that Welles is very much alive.
1634;The Third Man exudes effortless suspense from the opening scene up to the film's dramatic end.
1635;Needless to say, this film is very impressive, especially, its picture using the effect of light and shadow.
1636;I love this movie, must have seen it five times.
1637;and I love Anton Karas zither music in the movie.
1638;apparantly, Graham Green wanted a happy ending, but Carol Reed did not.
1639;Everything about this film is perfect.
1640;The mood, the music, the cast.
1641;all of it combines to form a rare jewel of cinema.
1642;It is easily one of the most suspenseful films I have ever seen.
1643;joseph Cotton is a captivating Film Noir leading man.
1644;Part of the tender charm of The Third Man is the humanness of the characters when confronted with inhumanity.
1645;Truly, Orson Welles steals the show in his brief appearances as Harry Lime.
1646;The addition of the Lux Theater broadcasts are very cool indeed.
1647;for good reason, The Third Man was nominated the #1 British film by the British Film Institute.
