I:512;1;"seriously
I:512;2;"The acting is brilliant
I:512;3;Child actor Ivan was amazing for his age.
I:512;4;So much emotion exudes from his little face and so much for a young boy to endure.
I:512;5;i doubt that I have seen a movie like this, tormenting, mysterious, and thrilling that provides such little detail.
I:512;6;The best one can do is pick up some clues from his behavior.
I:512;7;If you like outdoors or camping, this is must see for you.
I:512;8;There is some element of adventure in it.
I:512;9;You also get to explore Russian culture.
I:512;10;I saw around 18 films and this one is one best films that week.
I:512;11;It was filmed in beautiful locations, inside and outside the city.
I:512;12;However its more than that, in the end the director doesnt give you all the answers, and it will be up to you to figure out what happened, if it actually did happen at all.
I:512;13;You can see it as a religious film, as a film about the new and old Russia, or as a film about two brothers who never had a father and one day he comes back to show them important thing that will help them survive through life.
I:512;14;Great directing, great story, great acting and great photography.
I:512;15;I rated this film four stars, because I liken it to a well prepared meal that despite it's perfection, doesn't quite satisfy.
I:512;16;Camera work is superb, as is each character's portrayal by the fine actors.
I:512;17;The coming of age theme is punctuated with thought.
I:512;18;I believe the most significant point of this movie is no matter what paternal influence the viewer has experienced personally, it will touch a nerve.
I:512;19;This was a great movie.
I:512;20;You quickly become immersed in the story line and feel for these brothers and the dad.
I:512;21;he takes them to go together for a camping trip, where characters are open in full.
I:512;22;in all, the development of characters is very consistent.
I:512;23;A very fine first film by Russian director Andrei Zvyagyntsev.
I:512;24;The Christian symbolism is sometimes a bit heavy handed (with the father being a sort of devious Jesus figure), but otherwise this is a very fine movie.
I:512;25;factly, just what it is about this moving that touches me.
I:512;26;Some of my favorite films from that year took the time to explore facets of this `character'.
I:512;27;Young Ivan is the most affected, both before and after the trip, as he struggles with his own perception of this man he (begrudgingly) calls `father'.
I:512;28;What I found so beautifully moving about this film is that it never once tried to force our emotions.
I:512;29;By shying away from an easy answer (there has been a lot of talk about the ending being too ambiguous, but for me the ambiguity is what makes this film so poignant) a broader range of emotional entitlement is allowed.
I:512;30;Ivan is so clueless as to who his father truly is, but his anger, frustration, resentment and malice is all wrapped up in an undeniable love and affection.
I:512;31;Presenting to the audience an honest and emotionally gripping exploration of that bond between father and son, `Vozvrashchenie' nails everything needed to cement itself in the mind of the audience.
I:512;32;The flawless performances of the three leads are only illuminated by the beautiful camera work (the gritty realism brought to the stunning cinematography is hauntingly effective) and the poignant and provocative script.
I:512;33;This is an incredible film with layer upon layer of meaning and interpretation.
I:512;34;These are the prosaic reasons my wife and I came up with.
I:512;35;I now see as a brilliant revelation.
I:512;36;Again: it's genius that Zvyagintsev and crew have layered all this in and have us all talking and interpreting and re.
I:512;37;i had come here with the intention of waxing poetic about the acting skills of 'younger son' Ivan, as played masterfully by Ivan Dobronravov.
I:512;38;Now, that's a brilliant way to state it.
I:512;39;This film is shot with unsurpassed attention to beauty of the cadre .
I:512;40;Cinematography here is simply masterful, in a traditional way reminding of Visconti or Tarkovsky, as many observed, perhaps, but certainly nothing of the new wave.
I:512;41;It is amazing to think that Russian director obviously knew of this eternal picture.
I:512;42;The film is deeply enigmatic, as the treasure that the father dug out on the remote island disappears with his departure.
I:512;43;did i say itjust beautiful,the story,the landscapes the photography.
I:512;44;but just the surprising acting of the boys.
I:512;45;I thought it was a verysimple, but highly imaginative plot.
I:512;46;at times the film moves slowly but it's asleeper which climaxes brilliantly and leavesyou stunned.
I:512;47;the father is redeemed at the end andquestions about his love for the boysseem answered.
I:512;48;This might have been a disaster but ends up making the movie beautiful and haunting.
I:512;49;Again, this could have been annoying and distracting, but here it works in a terrific way.
I:512;50;the emotional aspects among this triois nail biting.
I:512;51;I like the creative originality of the director.
I:512;52;Be prepare to question a lot, especially in the end of the movie.
I:512;53;Shortly to say: this is the must.
I:512;54;I agree with a number of many viewers in other formums that this is a movie a need to be see every 5 years or so .
I:512;55;just to make you remember what is real values is a man's life.
I:512;56;One of the very few interesting post.
I:512;57;Wonderful acting of the late Volodya Garin.
I:512;58;Beautifully shot in an understated fashion.
I:512;59;Minimalism at its best: quite uncharacteristic of most of post.
I:512;60;I stumbled upon this 2003 Russian film and was pleasantly surprised by it.
I:512;61;It is done so well, I just had to watch it twice, for the sheer pleasure of the cinematography and compelling story.
I:512;62;stylish, solid and beautifully filmed.
I:512;63;The music and sound effects are hunting and the acting is spellbinding especially from the 2 kids.
I:512;64;It is a film by first time director Andrei Zvyagintsev, about a father and his two sons.
I:512;65;Absorbing, riveting, thrilling and leaving you with so many questions to ask.
I:512;66;But soon as the film was over, I watched it again, to find so many metaphors and references, it became a spiritual journey.
I:512;67;I am sure the young director is very much inspired by the great master of cinema.
I:512;68;The Return is nothing short of a masterpiece.
I:512;69;"Though at times resembling Madonna's ""Frozen"" video, the beautiful shots that linger a few seconds too long and the quiet, tense atmosphere that speaks loudly about the tension between the characters make for an intriguing film."
I:512;70;The mystery of the father's return also draws you into finishing the film through to the end, in spite of the lulls in the action.
I:512;71;I was greatly invested in the sons, wonderfully played by two very talented young actors, and wanted to see how their story played out.
I:512;72;But if you're looking for a beautiful postcard of Russia and a glimpse into the complicated workings of father.
I:512;73;son relationships, check this film out.
I:512;74;the movie was well directed and the acting was very good.
I:512;75;a very believable movie and insightful about human behavior, it is a sad movie with perhaps a message for all of us.
I:512;76;The acting by the younger boy in the movie is excellent.
I:512;77;That said, it's worth watching for the acting and the excellent visuals of the Russian countryside.
I:512;78;It has a simple storyline, spare dialogue, and long takes.
I:512;79;which is another way of saying that this is an art film.
I:512;80;(Albeit a gorgeously filmed and affecting one.)
I:512;81;"This is odd and poignant
I:512;82;And he was a compelling actor whose face is a fascinating canvas of stubbornness, humor, and hope.
I:512;83;(His brother, Ivan Dobronravov also gives a bravura performance.)
I:512;84;Filled with all the elements that a great film should have.
I:512;85;The two young actors were talented beyond they're years.
I:512;86;This movie beautifully, slowly, and deliberately builds the relationships between all three antagonists.
I:512;87;only when considered in these terms can one fully appreciate this movie.
I:512;88;Best summed up as a classic Russian tragedy.
I:512;89;What you have here is a real film.
I:512;90;And in steps the humanity of the project, whispering through your heart and tickling your intellect.
I:512;91;and, afterwards, if you want confirmation of the film's worth, simply watch the 'making of': a cast of dedicated professionals risking and working passionately at their craft.
I:512;92;A menacing and surprisingly uplifting film.
I:512;93;The youngest boy was superb in his role.
I:512;94;Everyone in this film was believable.
I:512;95;I regret I got it.
I:512;96;Well acted and beautiful scenery.
I:512;97;But,a very thoughtful and depressingly drawn out story.
I:512;98;It was very interesting story and seeing areas of Russia kept my intrest.
I:512;99;The story line was amazing and complex.
I:512;100;He found that he was held back by unresolved issues concerning his wife, his sons, and the money.
I:512;101;This foreign film was well done.
I:512;102;Love and hate draws a thin line in this haunting movie!
I:512;103;The guy that played the Dalai Lama was very good as well.
I:512;104;This is a well done true story.
I:512;105;The ending takes your breath away.
I:512;106;Lots to discuss and no easy answers.
I:512;107;There are subtitles, so it helps one's reading skills.
I:512;108;A dramatic slice of life in modern day rural Russia, characterized by exceptional child.
I:512;109;The other viewers that compare this to Tarkovsky and such are spot on.
I:512;110;This movie is an aesthetic experience, with a sparse plot, driven almost entirely by the actors' performances and the cinematography, both of which are sublime.
I:512;111;"Must have something to do with all that permafrost and vodka
I:512;112;Other people have come up with ideas that he was a hit man, a burglar, a Russian gangster.
I:512;113;"Call it tough love, it is necessary to survive in the real world, unlike the unrealistic and impractical American t. v. series, ""the Nelsons' or ""Father knows best""."
I:512;114;the end is open to interpretation, so i gave you my take on it.
I:512;115;The cinematography brilliantly draws the viewer into the film with visual art.
I:512;116;The script develops the characters with surprising twists.
I:512;117;The musical score has just enough influence to feel the emotions of the characters and the situation.
I:512;118;This film covers a slice in the time of the characters lives and leaves the conclusion to imagination.
I:512;119;It is a great film and I will watch it again to capture the more of the landscapes, buildings, and characters.
I:512;120;Let me start with the fact that I love foreign films.
I:512;121;This is one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time.
I:512;122;Everything about it was fantastic.
I:512;123;The stunning cinematography, the direction and the gripping storyline all make this one of the best films in the last few years.
I:512;124;line of this film is familiar.
I:512;125;The whole system sucks wind.
I:512;126;Many of us give up after so many years and move on with our lives.
I:512;127;You may see films as good as The Return but you will never see a better film, if acting and dialogue is what you prefer in the movie, along with a musical score that you never notice but the songs you have to have in your collection.
I:512;128;This movie is one of few movies that I give a grade above 95 and I do not give to many 90's.
I:512;129;It is breathtaking scenery, capturing the blues of grey Russia life after the fall of red communism.
I:512;130;A must see film for those who appreciate the art of motion pictures.
I:512;131;In many ways this movie reflects the classical Russian tragedy: the futility of love in the presence of miscommunication, the tendency for escalation and bravado, and that aching human desire to be accepted.
I:512;132;The ending will surprise you, and somehow you know that the boys will grow up a lot more wiser because of this trip.
I:512;133;Fabulous acting and direction, and the cinematography.
I:512;134;Brave directors take chances, and that is why they are the best, but sometimes at the expense of a mainstream audience.
I:512;135;Modern Russia, free Russia, is full of surprises.
I:512;136;We are a democracy and we are strong.
I:512;137;This film was beautifully done and very artistic.
I:512;138;The setting throughout the whole movie is dark and makes every move suspenseful.
I:512;139;in the movie, and in real life.
I:512;140;i had to watch this film for my Russian 410 class (film study) and I have to agree with other who posted that the youngest boy in this film can act!
I:512;141;A naturalistic (meaning grimly realistic) portrayal of the dysfunctional relationship between a stern father and his two young sons.
I:512;142;An excellent exploration of the psychology and thought processes of the characters.
I:512;143;Great show if you want to induce ennui and/or depression.
I:512;144;I would love to know how a first time director can take less than $500,000 and turn it into something as beautiful and haunting as this.
I:512;145;There are tons of directors out there who will work their whole careers and never come close to making a movie as good as Zvyagintsev has here and in Russia no less!
I:512;146;"He is a man of few words and strangely enough on his second day back he takes the boys out the road for a ""three"" day fishing trip."
I:512;147;It's better to let the tense mount, but I will tell you to watch the youngest brother played by Ivan Dobronravov.
I:512;148;He make the boy from THE SIXTH SENSE look like the red.
I:512;149;Good acting, weird story line, and with enough suspense to want to sit through it.
I:512;150;I thought that the acting was very good.
I:512;151;I especially liked the youngest boy.
I:512;152;I think he did a great job, a very believable angry kid.
I:512;153;It's a beautifully done film.
I:512;154;Psychologically astute, mysterious, the tension is unrelenting at times.
I:512;155;Ultimately a heartbreaking story, with strikingly beautiful images.
I:512;156;A story of two brothers and their brief chance at a relationship with a father, who had been like a myth for most of their lives.
I:512;157;After an absence of twelve years, Andrei and Ivan's father returns to take them to an unexpected camping trip.
I:512;158;the film was beautifully made and the director is so talented in the way he put the film together.
I:512;159;The actors were also amazing.
I:512;160;I highly recommend this film.
I:512;161;Interesting tale of the relationship between an estranged father and his two sons, with a surprising ending.
I:512;162;Good psychological tale with Oedipal implications.
I:512;163;year absence, the father of two young boys unexpectedly returns home.
I:512;164;what makes this foreign film so special is that it's a truly original experience.
I:512;165;director Zvyagintsev has given us a fine psychological thriller.
I:512;166;"The look and feel of ""The Return"" is something that we don't usually see in today's American thrillers."
I:512;167;The actors, especially the kids, have done a splendid job.
I:512;168;They actually turn out to look and act believable in their roles.
I:512;169;So rest in peace, Vladimir.
I:512;170;Low budget movie but still an excellent movie.
I:512;171;This is one of those films that the entire family should watch together.
I:512;172;I usually love Amazon because you can often get a good sense of something's worth from the reviews but I have to holy disagree in this case.
I:512;173;So we all look into movies like this with expectations to find wisdom and feel or understand better ourselves and the world.
I:512;174;A lot of art is created that leaves things unanswered and mysterious, but still delivers not just a beautiful landscapes and great music for the senses to enjoy, but also the patterns to be uncovered in one's mind.
I:512;175;What this move needs is the message that one can take home and reflect and learn something from.
I:512;176;A message that can transcend across the boundaries of our knowable world.
I:512;177;Something that tell us more who and what we are, and not just expose the pain that exists in the world (which one see whenever one watches TV news).
I:512;178;"So that one can see ""yes here is the pain, how do I live with it and break it apart and overcome it?"
I:512;179;I am talking about our human situation that Tarkovsy, for example, was able to masterfully represent and build upon it.
I:512;180;He may very well develop his style on his own and get out of Tarkovsky's shadow.
I:512;181;and most likely love this movie.
I:512;182;It's an interesting psychological drama and it has some nice outdoor scenery.
I:512;183;is interesting observe how his two sons reacts because they really don't know him aside from an old photograph want to go on a fishing trip.
I:512;184;as visual allegory, suspense, road movie, and on the deeper, more dramatic level of the father .
I:512;185;One day, the father returns after 12 year absence and on the next day, he takes the boys on the week long fishing trip.
I:512;186;the Return is an impressive debut by Andrei Zvaygintsev.
I:512;187;Dostoyevsky would've gone deep inside his character's soul and heart to give us the reasons for his actions .
I:512;188;poetic symbolism, magnificent indifference of nature, painful and honest dissections of the close relationships, and the return of the prodigal Odysseus.
I:512;189;this movie is along the same lines in regards to the suspense it creates for the ending.
I:512;190;Interesting portrayals and story line.
I:512;191;Lots of reflective Russian darkness in the mood and environment.
I:512;192;Interesting, poignant but hopeful, understated.
I:512;193;But you understand the message.
I:512;194;though subtitled I would recommend this movie.
I:512;195;In Russian in believe the story is very engrossing.
I:512;196;A very unexpected finish to this movie.
I:512;197;It was very well done!!!
I:512;198;Excellent role portrayal by all characters.
I:512;199;foreign movie lovers will enjoy.
I:512;200;Good for a long lonely night.
I:512;201;A beautifully delivered mystery but still vague in its message.
I:512;202;the entire film seemed stark, bare, and especially raw in appearance.
I:512;203;The visual aspects of the film lend its self well to the underlying loneliness and despair while capitalizing on the aggression between the children and their father.
I:512;204;beautifully filmed in wonderful locations with talented actors, the movie had potential if only it had a plot with a message.
I:512;205;if you watch this film be prepared to wonder.
I:512;206;THE RETURN is one of the most beautifully photographed, eloquent films about the influence of fragmented families this reviewer has ever seen.
I:512;207;Directed with extraordinary, understated, and sensitive perfection by Andrei Zvyagintsev, THE RETURN is a sweeping yet quiet epic story of a small family in Russia, fragmented by the father's desertion of them, and how the two boys and their mother cope with life alone and then with the unexpected arrival of the father after twelve years' absence.
I:512;208;Once awake the father menacingly tells the boys he will take them on a fishing trip.
I:512;209;But go they do, and begin a few days of quiet discovery that their long absent father is a creature to be feared.
I:512;210;there is much more to the simple story than meets the eye (even though the eye is romanced with some of the most evocative, minimalist, atmospheric photography of a lake in Siberia by cinematographer Mikhail Krichman).
I:512;211;The acting is of the highest order.
I:512;212;The musical score by Andrei Dergachyov quietly sets the mood to perfection.
I:512;213;This event makes this film an even more powerful mood piece.
I:512;214;This may not be a fast paced movie but it keeps you interested.
I:512;215;I have seen plenty of Russian films, and many of them have been slow and entirely reliant upon the emotional component.
I:512;216;Mikhalkov, for example, is a director who can do this.
I:512;217;I got the feeling that the cinematography and the colors didn't match the movie's theme and plot.
I:512;218;A man returns to his wife and two sons after a 12.
I:512;219;The film is shrouded in mystery, and the mystery itself adds to the film's ever increasing tension.
I:512;220;like discipline and genuine concern.
I:512;221;hollywood movies, which tells the story and stays on the subject.
I:512;222;I liked it because it kept me interested in.
I:512;223;this journey will be the big frame in which the complex dramatis personae will unfold.
I:512;224;the visual language is superb.
I:512;225;This young director conquered the admiration of great audiences around the world.
I:512;226;The film awarded several important Prizes.
I:512;227;it is magnificent in all orders.
I:512;228;A little gem of this promising and gifted filmmaker.
I:512;229;"I'm not sure how to rate this enigmatic movie: as far as cinematography is concerned it should be somewhere between 4 and 5 stars
I:512;230;Movies that challenge the intellect are certainly up my street.
I:512;231;What we have is a beautifully filmed narrative of two boys who are taken by their unknown father on a somewhat testing outing which extends itself to a few days.
I:512;232;Even though it wasn't what I traditionally watch.
I:512;233;I love coming across foreign films that sweep you away in the story.
I:512;234;It actually has meaning that is expressed very well by the actors.
I:512;235;The movie lets your mind imagine the history of the characters and their relationships and really makes you think about the father's hidden mission.
I:512;236;Yes comes from the feeling of belonging to the family, more so than appreciation of care and protection on the father's side.
I:512;237;Both love and need each other and still talk in terms of control and demand.
I:512;238;The acting was spot on and by towards the end I forgot I was reading subtitles.
I:512;239;The movie is very engaging and emotional.
I:512;240;brothers and their father, have shown fairly good acting.
I:512;241;A good movie about a father of 2 boys who came back to see them after many years.
I:512;242;They speak Russian in the movie, but the words are translated into easy to follow English on the screen.
I:512;243;And he decides to take them on a fishing trip in the back country.
I:512;244;All right because the elder son sticks to his father and tries to share this attachment with his younger brother, the two remaining close and sort of non.
I:512;245;and the return of the father to his sons will become the return of the sons with the fathers body to the mother, at first, and then without the fathers body, in the crucial moment when they should have loaded him in the homebound car.
I:512;246;a beautiful story about fatherhood and teenage especially because it is tragic, dramatic, traumatic.
I:512;247;And yet this authority is love, fatherly love and a child needs in their immediate environment these two sorts of love that have been systematically and wrongly associated to mother and father.
I:512;248;These two loves are love.
I:512;249;The story line was very good about a father who returns and expects everything with his sons to be normal
I:512;250;The two young actors played their characters very well.
I:512;251;The story, though depressing much of the time, was quite suspenseful.
I:512;252;This movie is unusual in that it has minimal dialogue, but that is just fine, because the directing and camera keeps the story moving.
I:512;253;"The acting is good, but not outstanding
I:512;254;The movie is worth 5 stars: it kept my attention and I noticed I was continually waiting to see what was going to happen.
I:512;255;This tense, mysterious and disturbing drama deals with the return of a father juxtaposed upon the coming of age concerns of the 2 brothers.
I:512;256;Very mysterious, subtle, ultimately tragic.
I:512;257;The relationship between the two brothers is very interesting too, much is unspoken, yet you can piece together the complexity of their feelings about their dad and each other.
I:512;258;If you have a universal PAL/NTSC player (most cheap Chinese players are universal these days) and you like this film, I recommend you get the European version.
I:512;259;The scenery and atmosphere alone are worth watching.
I:512;260;This film is quite good.
I:512;261;It is really refreshing to see boys acting like boys and neither precious wunderkinds or babyish.
I:512;262;This feels like an epic story of coming of age, or one generation finally giving up, and feeling that its job now is to import its knowledge to the next and nothing more.
I:512;263;The film moves so slowly as it draws us from civilization and mothering to the male world of hunting fighting and survival.
I:512;264;there is so much to like in this movie that if you can enjoy those parts and not be bothered by the shortcomings than it is well worth watching.
I:512;265;This riveting, assured debut by Russian director Svyagintsev is an unsettling psychological drama about the strained relationship between a father and his estranged sons, who undergo a series of endurance tests at his hands.
I:512;266;At the heart of the film is a mystery, but the tension builds around youngest son Ivan.
I:512;267;played with seething confidence by Dobronravov.
I:512;268;"Bleak and disquieting it may be, but Svyagintsev's ""The Return"" is an intriguing trip worth taking."
I:512;269;Maybe good if in the mood for a dark.
I:512;270;THE RETURN is unusual in that it captured and held my interest, then left me unfulfilled at the very end.
I:512;271;But Ivan's terror is so great that he eventually has to be rescued by his mother (Natalia Vdovina), whose faded beauty seems out of place in this desolate place.
I:512;272;thus begins a tense journey of non.
I:512;273;Towards his sons, he is, at best, remotely solicitous .
I:512;274;"reliant, strong men
I:512;275;It's wonderfully constructed around menacing, yet austerely beautiful, landscapes rendered more stark by a purposely washed.
I:512;276;If this is the sort of film that appeals to you, then enjoy.
I:512;277;(And you know who wins that contest!
I:512;278;It's a movie you see once, and never again.
I:512;279;The acting and filming of the movie seemed raw and unpolished.
I:512;280;"go
I:512;281;The younger kid was very good.
I:512;282;I usually don't watch foreign movies, but the visual part of this movie along with the subtitles made it okay to watch.
I:512;283;The Return was really one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
I:512;284;The characters are strong and interesting.
I:512;285;Really one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of watching in a long time.
I:512;286;Communication brings people closer, as shared information removes obstacles such as guessing and assumptions.
I:512;287;People know that the person is scared and it offers an opportunity for people to help the person overcome the fear in one way or another.
I:512;288;This displays why communication and why language is so essential for human existence.
I:512;289;cleverly, Zvyagintsev uses the mise.
I:512;290;Communication is also an essential part of cinema, as cinema is visual storytelling that can use dialogue and other auditory signals to promote a story.
I:512;291;The final lesson of communication that the film provides is in regards to our short existence on earth, which suggests that one should seize the day when the chance presents itself.
I:512;292;This is the beauty of art, as it leaves the audience with their own interpretations and thoughts, which maybe could lead to a revelation of some sort helping people with proper communication.
I:512;293;I also really enjoyed the Russian idioms.
I:512;294;director Andrey Zvyagintsev to the soul of the viewer, that is.
I:512;295;The story is moving, believable and deep on both psychological and emotional levels .
I:512;296;the cinematography, writing and pacing are right on target .
I:512;297;and the acting is as close to perfect as either a director OR audience can imagine.
I:512;298;lost father with just the right mix of strength, mystery and cool understatement .
I:512;299;his character would give many actors an excuse to overplay and draw attention away from the young men portraying the sons, the true centers of the film.
I:512;300;The balance he achieves here is a tribute to the care with which he pursues his craft.
I:512;301;the two young actors who play brothers Andrey and Ivan (Vladimir Garin and Ivan Dobronravov, respectively) turn in some of the most believable, moving performances I've ever seen from people their age.
I:512;302;The depths of emotion and commitment they give to their roles is extraordinary .
I:512;303;the fact that this is director Zvyagintsev's first feature film tells me that this is indeed a filmmaker to watch .
I:512;304;His talent is formidable .
I:512;305;the story unfolds at just the right pace .
I:512;306;The honors this film received at the Venice Film Festival were justified .
I:512;307;I can recommend it without reservation to anyone, whether they favor 'art house' cinema or simply a well.
I:512;308;made film telling a compelling story.
I:512;309;This one has a really nice documentary (63 min) included, a 'film about the film', a well.
I:512;310;made and informative look behind the scenes.
I:512;311;Beautifully filmed we see the boys taken on a painful and lengthy journey and in a manner of speaking, the journey represents their passage from adolescence to something else, not adulthood but something just before that.
I:512;312;it's beautiful and worth the effort.
I:512;313;without ruining the story line, this movie has a premise that is very real and worthy of more exploration.
I:512;314;"One of the beautiful aspects of Andrei Zvyaginstev's ""The Return"" is that it leaves open any interpretation."
I:512;315;The film is emotional, intense, mysterious, minimalistic, and filmed with grayish hues to set a mood of impending questions from the beginning.
I:512;316;the father is a man of few words and intense sad eyes.
I:512;317;He decides to take them on a trip to go fishing and camping.
I:512;318;YES IT HAS SUBTITLES, however this film is brilliantly directed, and it will make you wonder and ponder for hours.
I:512;319;There are some excellent performances in the small cast.
I:512;320;The one scene on the beach where he tells his father that he wants to love him and then tears off in the opposite direction is enough to rip your heart out and hand it to you on a platter.
I:512;321;The older brother Andrei played by Vladimir Garin does an excellent job as well.
I:512;322;So if you're a very patient viewer or one whose life is going so fast that you're looking for a way to slow down, this is the film that will do it for you.
I:512;323;I'll return again and again to The Return .
I:512;324;It is a simple, yet profound story, almost perfect in it's story andacting, showing us much about it's 3 main characters, but allowing the mysteries of people and life to bepuzzled over by the viewer.
I:512;325;"The acting was good
I:512;326;This film exposes the raw reality of the hard life of two boys who grow up fatherless.
I:512;327;Actually, everybody in this film leaves an old reality in pursuit of a nebulous, but enticing dream, maybe of wealth, maybe of love, maybe of what it would be like to have a father, what it would be like to have sons.
I:512;328;Definitely worth watching for the thoughtful viewer.
I:512;329;It's a simple story, beautifully filmed and acted, and it really makes you think.
I:512;330;The action is slow and the story requires patience, but it rewards you in the end.
I:512;331;The starkness of the Siberian setting is very appropriate to the starkness of the story.
I:512;332;A very scary story of a dream that turns into a nightmare.
I:512;333;This film's power is revealed in the contrast between the events as they play out and the questions generated by the enigmatic final moments.
I:512;334;It worked firstly as a mysterious, psychological drama, but once the film had ended, it fit the definition of the term allegory perfectly.
I:512;335;The Return makes a compelling case in favor of a poetically complex narrative over the expectations of 'The Hollywood Ending', where life eventually makes some kind of sense.
I:512;336;The absence of a father can create a psychological 'presence' for the family, both seen and felt in the emotional interaction of the children.
I:512;337;And the mysterious journey to an island, the significance of which changes them all.
I:512;338;but appear as symbols whose meaning is more poetic than literal.
I:512;339;In true Tarkovskian form the filmmaker has bled his symbols of specific reference and made them about the characters.
I:512;340;its a rare film, well worth seeing, if for no other reason than to marvel at the elegiac force of the story, the photography and at the performances that the director managed to coax from his actors.
I:512;341;Both the boys in particular are astonishingly subtle.
I:512;342;Reviewer Roland Zwick really said it all about this amazing, stirring story.
I:512;343;This is a mesmerizing study of the heartache that fathers and sons experience from enforced separation and how hard it can be to reunite.
I:512;344;people who find this boring have no real appreciation for deep and quiet probing of the human soul, and for the gradual but all the more excruciating buildup of tension that great art like this portrays.
I:512;345;It may be gold, or cash or jewelry or drugs, but it's valuable.
I:512;346;The Return is an amazing debut for the director.
I:512;347;"But neither is this a foreign film that Hollywood fans would sneer at
I:512;348;It had a good story line, well acted .
I:512;349;masterfully served and beautifully photographed .
I:512;350;"as far as my take on ""The Return"", it's one of the most haunting and moving films I've ever seen."
I:512;351;Cinematography was excellent and the story line could fit many families anywhere in the world.
I:512;352;There is something about this movie that sticks with you long after you have watched it.
I:512;353;You are moved, you are disturbed, and you keep thinking about it.
I:512;354;How refreshing and disturbing!It is a movie made by a Russian director, with outstanding Russian actors (the kids!)
I:512;355;"It is a ""universal"" story of a father returning to his wife and children after a twelve.year unexplained absence and taking his two sons ."
I:512;356;to whom he is a perfect stranger since he left when they were very little .
I:512;357;"from then on, ""unexpected"" is the guideline and you hold your breath."
I:512;358;the photography is beautiful, and the score at times adds real power to the images.
I:512;359;"see movie for cinema buffs, not for the average ""movie goer""."
I:512;360;it was gripping and yet a slow pace until the end.
I:512;361;It starts slowly and continues that way for quite some time.
I:512;362;The two brothers have a love for each other even through their bickering and fighting.
I:512;363;The Return is a powerful movie that speaks to themes of manhood and fatherhood.
I:512;364;It's beautifully shot and the characters are vivid.
I:512;365;One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
I:512;366;the two fatherless brothers from a Russian town, Andrei (Vladimir Garin) and Vanya (Ivan Dobronravov), are engaged in a brotherly fight the next day and chase after each other to tell their mother.
I:512;367;the mysterious father takes his sons to a fishing trip and their mother reluctantly accepts them to go with their father.
I:512;368;the climatic point of the film starts with Vanya's grand plan to steal his father's knife and confession to Andrei of his feelings and hatred towards their father.
I:512;369;old Russian director's, Mr. Zvyagintsev, creation to demonstrate the moving tension and simplicity of his characters evokes a psychological thrill.
I:512;370;The sacred relationship between father and son eludes the mysterious persona of the father's mission to get the box and taking his innocent sons with him arose more mystery.
I:512;371;The Return completes itself as a wonderful film filled with human actions with reasonable thoughts.
I:512;372;A new talent has arrived from this independent Russian film.
I:512;373;I really enjoyed this movie, it was so well done, and the young actors were amazing.
I:512;374;It is a bit gory and violent but still worth a look for sure.
I:512;375;The plot is very engaging, and the acting is super.
I:512;376;While I would have liked another ending, the overall movie is very interesting.
I:512;377;I had a little trouble in the beginning, because it is very rich with symbolism.
I:512;378;I will definitely watch this movie again!
I:512;379;It is destined to be remembered by film students as the best ever example of Alfred Hitchcock's MacGuffin device.
I:512;380;This looked like a good story: then we watched it.
I:512;381;It had a good beginning.
I:512;382;a group of boys trying to prove their courage and bravery.
I:512;383;"Beautiful
I:512;384;A trip, fishing, fighting, camping, and sailing.
I:512;385;One brother is a suck.
I:512;386;Just a memorable sight, the scenery realistic and eye.
I:512;387;This film is will captivate all viewers!
I:512;388;Director Vladimir Garin deserves much praise!
I:512;389;This would make an excellent addition to any movie collection!
I:512;390;The suspense built throughout the movie and the twists at the end were unexpected!
I:512;391;I was both angered and saddened during the film.
I:512;392;Then, as we watched the more a second time, you can kind of see the other side as well.
I:512;393;The boys acting is great, the filming is so non.
I:512;394;beautiful movie that works as a simple tale of boys meeting their father as well as an allegory about Russia itself, The Return has almost nothing wrong with it and many memorable scenes that linger in the mind.
I:512;395;I love Russian flicks, but this one, albeit dark, was very moving.
I:512;396;The younger boy, Vanya, wasa very intense actor.
I:512;397;I enjoyed it: missed some so don't know if they told you the reason for the trip with the father.
I:512;398;i drew my own conclusion, so if you do not mind having an ending that leaves it up to you.you will enjoy it.
I:512;399;The two boy actors are incredible.
I:512;400;There are many stories in stories and it all works in to an allegorical tale of human life, loss, grieving and regret.
I:512;401;Hope you enjoy it as I did.
I:512;402;great movie have wanted to watch it for a long time, but other things always got in the way.
I:512;403;you really should, if you can imagine cinema as an art form, not just as an entertainment for an hour or two.
I:512;404;This is Andrey Zvyagintsev's first feature movie, and it simply is a brilliant movie (rated 95% at Rotten Tomatoes, a stunning achievement for any film).
I:512;405;It's the first Zvyagintsev movie, and its almost perfect.
I:512;406;give a try to this wonderful movie.
I:512;407;my favorite for a while.
I:512;408;Sad but very well done tale of family life in a broken home.
I:512;409;I loved how the director used photographs taken by and finally of the boys to end the film because again how else could you possibly explain what took place over the course of the week that they are gone?
I:512;410;One of the absolute best films I have ever seen.
I:512;411;The Return is one of the best movies to have recently come out of Russia.
I:512;412;Director Andrei Zvyagintsev, who has been compared to Tarkovsky by quite a few critics, does a wonderful job, and so do the three main actors Konstantin Lavronenko (the father) and Vladimir Garin and Ivan Dobronravov (as Andrey and Vanya, the sons).
I:512;413;it is here under the grey skies that the story reaches its unexpected climax.
I:512;414;A lot of what the audience carries away from the movie are only suggested and never explicitly mentioned.
I:512;415;All these work together to transform this thriller into an unsettling psychological study seeped in Russian mysticism.
I:512;416;sweet and soft, intimate yet each son is unique.
I:512;417;I don't want to ruin the ending but I highly recommend this film to those sick of the usual fare from Hollywood.
I:512;418;this Russian film is one of the best!!!
I:512;419;I enjoy foreign films and really liked this because of the message that portrayed love and hurt and how hurt can turn into love.
I:512;420;Film buffs will find lots to like in this film.
I:512;421;Bleak and desolate contrasted with moments of sheer beauty.
I:512;422;What I wonder about is the box.
I:512;423;Somewhat gripping story, well acted, with none of the special effects and improbable twists of the usual Holywood film.
I:512;424;Enjoyable and memorable but not outstanding.
I:512;425;What was in the box, and what was in the father's heart, is secondary.
I:512;426;"And that's why I didn't give it one star
I:512;427;The Return, a breathtakingly austere masterpiece from the land that gave us Eisenstein, Pudovkin and Tarkovsky, is one of the most beautifully acted and directed films I have seen in years.
I:512;428;the film tells the tale of two brothers, Ivan and Andrei, who live with their mother and grandmother in a small coastal village in Russia.
I:512;429;One day, totally unexpectedly, the boys' father returns after a twelve.year absence.
I:512;430;every single moment of this film is a revelation.
I:512;431;Zvyagintsev beautifully captures the opposite ways in which the boys react to and interact with their father.
I:512;432;Of the two boys, he seems the most tuned into the kind of threat the father may pose to their welfare.
I:512;433;Through this intense interaction, the film emerges as a complex and profound study of what father and son relationships are really all about.
I:512;434;it is virtually impossible to put into words just how brilliantly the two young actors use their facial expressions to convey a wealth of meaning and emotion.
I:512;435;Konstantin Lavronenko is equally impressive as the boy's mysterious father, beautifully underplaying the part of a man who can appear sane and rational on the surface but who is a seething cauldron of untapped emotions beneath.
I:512;436;For this is, first and foremost, a great character study.
I:512;437;And this is how it should be.
I:512;438;"among other things, ""The Return"" represents one of the most impressive directorial debuts since Francois Truffaut`s ""The 400 Blows."""
I:512;439;Zvyagintsev's ability to draw great performances from his actors is only one of his many talents on display here.
I:512;440;His lyrical use of composition, as well as the way in which he makes nature and weather an integral part of his drama help to draw us so deeply into this world that it takes the viewer literally hours to get fully back to his own existence again once the movie has ended.
I:512;441;It reverberates for days afterwards.
I:512;442;"For as with any great film, ""The Return"" finds its way into the depths of one's soul and leaves the viewer a richer person for the experience."
I:512;443;"winner of the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival (2003), ""The Return"" is a true work of art and one of the outstanding films of the decade so far."
I:512;444;The moment this film opened I was overjoyed to be in the hands of a brilliant new film maker andfor any fan of serious film, this is a real thrill.
I:512;445;i can share one story that will illustrate its powerful effect.
I:512;446;When I turned around to observe the audience, they sat forward, riveted in unison to the screen.
I:512;447;It was the greatest compliment young people could ever give a great film.
I:512;448;They were with it heart and soul, and I'm sure you probably will be too.
I:512;449;it gives us hope in the future of film.
I:512;450;winning film about a father and two young sons on a fishing trip after twelve years of separation, there is the bleakness and moral ambiguity of Bergman's world, where people live isolated lives, often on remote islands.
I:512;451;"In its stark focus on three characters traveling alone together, it's also reminiscent of Polanski's early film, ""Knife in the Water."
I:512;452;Visually the film is striking with its slow but persistent camera movement and the washed out color that reduces some scenes to monochrome.
I:512;453;Meanwhile, the soundtrack music is spare and eerie.
I:512;454;And we keep watching the man for signs of his true character as he responds to the two boys, one of them willing to accept the man at his word, the other deeply suspicious and openly rebellious.
I:512;455;based on a simple premise, it's a brilliantly conceived story that holds the viewer to the end, leaving us finally with unanswered questions that provoke reflection on the loss of innocence and the uneasy relationship between family and self.
I:512;456;"First off, let me say that ""The Return"" is a stunningly gorgeous movie, magnificently filmed, well."
I:512;457;cast, with a gripping story superbly acted.
I:512;458;On those grounds alone, it is more than worth watching.
I:512;459;i will give the movie this: I can't recall ever seeing a movie that so completely took me off guard as to how it progressed.
I:512;460;Very real to life, except maybe the ending.
I:512;461;Interesting Russian made movie with English subtitles.
I:512;462;I had never seen a Russian movie and this was a quite enjoyable.
I:512;463;This is a very entertaining and thought provoking movie especially if you enjoy viewing foreign films.
I:512;464;a couple of young Russian brothers are being raised in a family absent the father.
I:512;465;A bare bones, mostly gray and stark movie about an estranged alcoholic father who comes to take his wary sons on a journey.
I:512;466;It is amazing how the Russian director manages to direct a masterpiece.
I:512;467;A very simple story about two sons and their father.
I:512;468;The kids are confused, delighted and suspicious all at the same time.
I:512;469;The Father offers to take the kids for a 3 day fishing trip.
I:512;470;At times, he ensures that the kids are wearing jackets for the nippy evening.
I:512;471;The cinematography is simple, but creative.
I:512;472;nine year old Ivan's acting is superb and is the the highlight of the movie.
I:512;473;Worst movie I've seen in a long time!
I:512;474;The boys did an outstanding acting job, that's about the one good thing about this movie.
I:512;475;Ivan wimps out and gets in a fight with his brother who joins their friends in mocking his cowardice.
I:512;476;What is more he is going to take them on a trip in his car.
I:512;477;At other times, it merely seems this is a fairly well.
I:512;478;this is youthful director Andrei Zvyganitzev's first movie.
I:512;479;All five of them look like pretty good news for Russian cinema.
I:512;480;Made for a tiny budget, this is a breathtakingly good movie: deep and beautiful and utterly unforgettable.
I:512;481;He sees a lorry approaching in the distances.
I:512;482;I grant you it certainly doesn't sound very exciting.
I:512;483;Just watch it: you'll see what I mean.
I:512;484;The Return, like a film that teeters between between being serious or being funny, or food that dangles between being sweet or salty, or music that can't decide whether to be primarily jazz or primarily classical, delights in not making up its mind.
I:512;485;That is all I have to say about this film.
I:512;486;This movie was okay at best.
I:512;487;Very well filmed, beautiful scenery of the Russian countryside.
I:512;488;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:512;489;this movie was very interesting, it kept me glued to the film following the story.
I:512;490;Great narration of the story.
I:512;491;Amongst all the adverse and strong moments, a beautiful journey has been captured through some splendid scenic spots.
I:512;492;She was stellar and flawless and very poised in a suppressed feminine sort.
I:512;493;She is a brilliant actress and she could have shined in timepiece roles like this one.
I:512;494;the film was captivating from the start and it proceeded to go deeper and deeper.
I:512;495;It is a great movie but it may make you cry.
I:512;496;I loved that it was unlike any other movies that I've seen before.
I:512;497;The story was exceptional and leaves you thinking.
I:512;498;took some time to get into it but once I did, it was a very, very good movie!
I:512;499;Very good movie about a young boy and a complex unpleasant situation.
I:512;500;It kept me glued with the story.
I:512;501;I don't understand why many people thought this was a great movie.
I:512;502;It was good up until the end.
I:512;503;I've seen many emotional films in my life, but I've never seen a film with as much emotional intensity as Vozvrashcheniye.
I:512;504;The insufficiency of words can also be described by the film itself .
I:512;505;The visuals seduce you into near.
I:512;506;The story was quite realistic.
I:512;507;The interaction between the father and his sons was very well done.
I:512;508;This is a great movie.
I:512;509;The movie is still one of the best.
I:512;510;He is commanding, stern, stoic: it seems as if he is incapable of expressing emotion, fascinating Andrei and Vanya nonetheless.
I:512;511;what remains strong throughout is the film's use of metaphor.
I:512;512;He maintains his stern disposition even when he inflicts both physical and emotional hardship upon his sons, both of whom barely know him, in turn taking mere slaps and yells deep to heart, judging his every action.
I:512;513;In addition, the intense human emotions demonstrated in the central relationship remain palpable, despite 'The Return' being obviously allegorical.
I:512;514;much of this emotion is well maintained as a result of strong acting.
I:512;515;Garin's Andrei is perfectly naive, balancing his character's symbolic and human natures.
I:512;516;I was impressed with his ability to completely draw me into his character's feelings, never black.
I:512;517;Coming out of Dobronravov's mouth, these words were meaningful and dug deep within my heart, as I was able to witness the dimensions in them unfolding, one after the other.
I:512;518;handled twist in the story.
I:512;519;As a result of Dobronravov's acting, the final third of the film carries an emotional weight on its back that serves both the film's metaphor and its human message well, elevating 'The Return' to a level you did not see approaching.
I:512;520;I applaud this child's performance, and it will undoubtedly end up on my short list for the year's best lead acting performances.
I:512;521;moving, but a performance by a child this dimensional, cinematography this gorgeous, a metaphor this well presented: it's all so rare, I cannot help but strongly admire director Andrei Zvyagintsev for giving us a film strong at its core, if not polished on its surface.
I:512;522;This is a truly great movie that is wasted on American audiences that are accustomed to the shallow themes, a truly beautiful movie for those who are deep and sensitive.
I:512;523;It held my attention throughout and this is very hard to do.
I:512;524;The picture was good and it looked interesting to me.
I:512;525;kids have incredible strength and survival skills.
I:512;526;the plot was totally cerebral.
I:512;527;and yes it is shot in stark beautiful locations.
I:512;528;i totally loved this film.
