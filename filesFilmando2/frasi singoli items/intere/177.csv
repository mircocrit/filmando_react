1;A man is trying to move forward with his life.
2;A lot of themes still apply today.
3;Marty's voluble speech betrays his nervousness, and his pleasure.
4;An elevated train runs in the background.
5;[There is humor in the conversations.]
6;There is more humor in their conversations.
7;The ending is open ended, as if to provide for a sequel or a TV series.
8;winning performance is a slice of cinema heaven.
9;This is such a sweet film, I could watch this movie all day long.
10;I love it and so will you, I highly recommend this classic romantic drama.
11;She's played by Betsy Blair, who had a fascinating biography in her own right as a black.
12;this movie won me over through its understatement.
13;The leading characters show their essential sweetness and humanity and the minor characters are also well.
14;this film was a giant of sleeper films.
15;it is definitely one of the greats of all motion picture history.
16;the sound was good too.
17;but inspite of that, i still give it 5 stars.
18;I like the main actor and I like the female actress so much too.
19;I loved this movie from a time that seemed less complicated.
20;It's really good storytelling and has wonderful acting.
21;Perhaps it is an idealized glimpse of another era, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.
22;This one emotionally draws in the viewer.
23;a genius of an actor who pulls off the character of Marty perfectly.
24;it is however, well worth the viewing.
25;Marty is story full of heart to which all viewers can relate to on some level.
26;Marty is such a heart warming movie.
27;Marty was a good movie.
28;The movie had a good plot of an Italian.
29;Overall, a good movie to watch.
30;Now my mouth is watering to see it.
31;`Marty' was, for me, a completely unexpected surprise of a film.
32;`Marty' is a treasure, and Borgnine's performance is just wonderful.
33;She has just been ditched by her blind date and is emotionally crushed, but when she meets Marty her night turns around and the two of them hit it off really well.
34;They talk and talk and talk and make plans to meet up again the next night.
35;could this be everything Marty has been waiting for?The great thing about `Marty' is that it remains feeling light and airy while giving unexpected depth to the central theme of loneliness, making some very profound observations.
36;The intersecting storyline concerning Marty's mother and her initial determination to marry off Marty and then her resolve to keep him single is beautifully fleshed out through a few key sequences and gives `Marty' a depth I didn't expect.
37;the cast is all equipped with the goods and delivers a beautifully paced film thanks to their wonderful performances.
38;"`Marty' hit me in all the right places
39;This is how good this movie really is.
40;I'm a classic cinema buff and """"Marty"""" is a must."""
41;esteem, a pushy Italian Mamma and a heart of gold.
42;The true mark of a masterpiece is when the viewer is inmersed in the story and emotionally connects with the characters on screen.
43;I have always loved this movie.
44;She meet him this year at a convention and got his autograph picture for me.
45;This movie classic, is a fabulous movie.
46;here is this sensitive, kind.
47;Nobody really wants him to be happy and have his own life, especially his mother, and his aunt.
48;"These two actors play their character parts perfectly, just like real ""battle."
49;It is hilarious and entertaining and very true to life.
50;I love watching this movie over and over.
51;A pretty good story line and Earnest Borgnine is a great actor.
52;If you have never seen Marty, you are missing one of the great movies of the '50s era.
53;Serious, funny, poignant and real.
54;I would have thought that winning Best Picture for the year would be a good start!Shame on whoever made this decision!The movie INTACT receives a full five stars and an exclamation point.
55;More often than not, I laughed so hard because I found everything about it to be uproariously hilarious.
56;What's sad and surprising about the theme is that it's absolutely alive today in the real world.
57;One interesting aspect is how people who develop so many unfounded opinions about something or somebody even though they hardly know it or the person.
58;"It's true with them that there is a saying, ""First impressions are everything."""
59;Anyhow, the film is surprisingly realistic and germane.
60;That's why I laughed so hard during Marty.
61;To come to think of New York pictures, I feel there is an interesting similarity between Marty and Tony Manero of Saturday Night Fever.
62;The incomparable Marlon Brando won it the year before in what is one of the most incredible performance ever.
63;What a wonderful feel good movie.
64;No wonder that the movie won Academy Award Best Movie for that year.
65;"Borgnine won an Academy Award for his performance in ""Marty"" and deserved it."
66;Ernest Borgnine is my favorite actor, of all time.
67;layered screenplay presents us with entertaining dialogue, but it is also more real, less 'Hollywoodized' without any snappy dialogue or catchy phrases.
68;There is also a secondary, more beautiful under.
69;mates, the idea that physical beauty is not that important and that people who have things in common are more likely to live a happy relationship.
70;But the thing that makes 'Marty' special, other than the timeless story, is Ernest Borgine's timeless performance as the lonely butcher with a heart of gold, he creates a unique character than anyone can sympathize with, his performance is the basic thing that keeps the movie going.
71;While not an American Classic, and to tell the truth it feels a little dated, it is an irresistible movie that leaves you feeling good about yourself.
72;Extras: this is the first film to win The Oscar for Best Picture and the Palm D'Or at Cannes for Best Film.
73;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 7!
74;i like it because it is funny, romantic and gives me just a good feeling.
75;Marty is a Movie for everyone.
76;We watch it when we want to feel good.
77;Paddy Chayefsky was a great screenwriter.
78;It's a very well done, poignant little drama, with a great feeling for the Bronx of the 1950s, where it's set.
79;This movies is old NYC Italian at its best.
80;It is great to show non glamorous actors finding love as this is the real norm.
81;You will love this movie.
82;"Poignant story of ""average"" people and the profound changes in their lives: loneliness, widowhood, fear, frustration, boredom, shyness."
83;All in the Bronx!Wonderful film that deserves its awards.
84;it is the same with Star!
85;Borgnine is really good along with the rest of the supporting cast.
86;Marty is one of our favorite movies.
87;Ernest Borgnine sure earned his Oscar for this one
88;It has real meaning, I love the old black and whites, the real good ones.
89;Ernest Borgnine peeled back the complicated layers of his feelings to enable him to finally find love.
90;Such a sweet and wonderful film.
91;I enjoyed it so much and definitely recommend it to anyone.
92;I enjoyed this movie about two lonely people.
93;I enjoyed the movie because I've lived it.
94;This is a great romance movie for all ages and Ernest Borgnine gives his best performance.
95;My wife and I loved this movie!
96;He still lives at home with his mother who keeps brow beating him into finding a nice girl and getting married.
97;This sets up the rest of the film for a very memorable evening between Marty and Clara.
98;The movie is a radical departure from typical Hollywood romances where the men are strong, witty and handsome, while the women are beautiful and charming, while both are usually impeccably dressed and typically members of high society.
99;This movie doesn't have any of that and is enormously effective as it shows an honest depiction of how true romance is in real life.
100;I thoroughly enjoyed this film and highly recommend it.
101;The sound is fine and the only bonus is a trailer hosted by Burt Lancaster.
102;I was very pleasantly surprised by a wonderful performance by Ernest Borgnine, and actor whom I have admired for a long time.
103;He plays a very gentle, kind butcher, unlike some of his other tough guy roles in From Here To Eternity and The Wild Bunch.
104;The movie is only 90 minutes long, and it is a very simple story about how Marty meets a girl.
105;It is very character driven, and I found myself identifying a lot with the prinicipal characters.
106;What a wonderful sweet movie!!!
107;The sincerity and emotion played by these 2 actors is beyond imaginable.
108;I strongly recommend everyone to watch this film, you will not be disappointed!!!
109;I remember clearly seeing the film in 1954, and loved it, as did a large segment of the population.
110;I loved it so much I bought it *lol* I would recommend this movie to see.
111;This film is top notch.
112;"What I think is so beautiful about this film is that you don't think about ""star personalites""."
113;There are so many touching scenes .
114;I highly recommend this film to those who would like to see an old fashioned romantic picture done simply.
115;This has been one of my favorite films for years, and my admiration for it only increases on repeat viewings.
116;Ernest Borgnine gives the finest performance of his career as the lonely butcher, Marty Pilletti.
117;It is one of the most multi.
118;layered performances in the history of film.
119;We see Marty as he appears on the surface, then Mr. Borgnine peels away layer after layer, like an onion, revealing the real Marty deep inside.
120;He calls himself a fat, ugly man but he has the most beautiful heart in the world.
121;The supporting cast is first rate, especially Betsy Blair as the plain.
122;The film explores so many issues, how people can ruin another person's happiness, how ideas and perceptions can change everything in a person's life.
123;This is a film of beauty, heart and soul, and I've never seen it equaled, and certainly never exceeded.
124;This movie which I stumbled over one day is a masterpiece.
125;I always liked him as an actor but the acting Ernie does in this film is some of the best I've seen by any actor ever!!!
126;still the film is funny and enjoyable,not depressing at all.
127;the last scene in the movie is the best acting I,ve seen anyone do ever!Watch Ernie's face as he listens to his brain.
128;ernest Borgnine will become YOUR favorite actor too!
129;I sent it to my son.
130;It's a great study of emotion, love, Italian/American culture, and working class New Yorkers.
131;I bought it for Gram .
132;I've never seen it, but she loves it.
133;She said if she ever had a son, she'd name him Marty.
134;a simple story but done magnificently.
135;ernest borgnine is great as is his co star betsy blair, who while not outwardly beautiful, portrays a woman with a beautiful heart and soul.
136;He was thrilled with it, and she and I watched it with him that night.
137;It was obvious why Ernest Borgnine won an Oscar for his performance in this wonderful old film.
138;Great Hollywood Classic, no complaints!
139;I enjoyed this movie very much.
140;it covers a weekend in the life of a lonely, overweight Bronx butcher named Marty Piletti.
141;It's intriguing to see how cultural mores have changed since both characters are considered over.
142;directed by Delbert Mann in his first time out at the helm, the production seems accurate in capturing the atmosphere of the mid.1950's lower middle class, and the dramatically effective setting allows Marty's story to take on a well.
143;The observant performances complement the treatment with Ernest Borgnine giving his career.
144;best performance in the title role.
145;Even though he is sometimes too robust to be completely convincing as a socially defeated man, he brings surprising force to scenes when his self.
146;It's a solidly modest film with no pretensions.
147;What a great classic movie to watch.
148;One of the better movies to watch.
149;Wish someone would make more movies as good as this one.
150;There is Marty's mother who is afraid of living her own old age alone.
151;When Marty meets her at a dance where she has just been dumped by a blind date, he finds they have a lot in common and they both enjoy the evening immenselyis great move
152;Marty is described as the most successful sleeper film of all time.
153;Indeed, having seen this film, I agree with the accolades the movie received by the Academy Awards, especially Ernest Borgnine, who gives a stellar performance as the films main character.
154;This deeply touching film deserves all fives stars.
155;If you're a dog can relate to Marty's situation, then this should be a memorable film for you.
156;Ernest Borgnine did a great job and i don't think there is one cuss word in the whole movie.
157;A great family movie too.
158;He deserved the Academy Award for best actor.
159;"life moment in time of an ""Ordinary Joe""living his supposed humdrum life and seeking happiness and love."
160;Brilliant acting, stunning writing, depiction of a Once Upon A Time in the Bronx that now belongs to the annals of yesteryear.
161;MARTY has become one of my all time favorite movies!
162;I highly recommend this movie to everyone!!
163;I love old movies and am a BIG James Dean fan.
164;His 3 films (East of Eden, Bebel Without a Cause and Giant) are timeless.
165;As great as Jimmy's performances were Ernie deserved the Oscar.
166;That's all I will tell you, see the movie you will love it.
167;This film is surprising because it shows that you don't need sex, non.
168;Because the theme is so universal and is identifiable to most people, you end up truly relating and feeling with Borgnine's and Blair's respective characters.
169;This also means that the film ages well and remains entertaining for adult audiences today.
170;this is a very enjoyable and heartwarming film but I'd recommend waiting for a restored, remastered version to be available and to avoid this particular version.
171;I enjoy reading reviews on Amazon just after seeing a movie, and this time i especially enjoyed how many favorite lines were quoted by everyone (I'm a fat ugly man!)
172;She makes a pass at him.
173;i laughed so hard watching this section and was quoting it the next day.
174;I watched this wonderful little movie for the first time in many years last night.
175;It is a fine film about real people with real problems.
176;The great Ernest Borgnine and the rest of the cast are terrific.
177;Love this black and white movie.
178;It is clean and wholesome entertainment.
179;I recommend it for people of all ages.
180;Ernie is great as usual.
181;I have recommended this movie to so many people and cannot find anyone who does not like it.
182;"One of my favorite parts is the conversation between Marty and his mother and her comment when she finds out Clara had gone to college, that such women are "" one steppa from the street"" !"
183;And I'm positive Gilda Radner based one of her characters on the aunt who goes to live with Marty and his Mother.
184;This movie won the Oscar for best picture in 1955.
185;Great acting and character development.
186;The ending is surprising and satisfying.
187;This is a potent, moving, powerful film about loneliness, sadness, love, and just wanted to have someone to share your life with.
188;This film is a deeply humanistic, caring work, showing Marty in a sympathetic light.
189;The film reminds me of Brief Encounter, David Lean's masterpiece, on how modern audiences would howl in laughter at the protagonists in that film, and the ones here.
190;Paddy Chafvesky and Delbert Mann have crafted a really moving work here, one that still resonates today.
191;A sweet,simple story about a lonely, shy butcher who grapples with balancing family and work.
192;one night at an upscale nightclub Marty meets a kindred spirit: Clara, an intelligent, plain girl with dreams of her own.
193;over many cups of coffee the two share heartfelt conversation and reveal their dreams to one another.
194;Still, friends and family judge.
195;an uplifting gem with a timeless message.
196;It was such a lovely scene and the movie is not that lengthy to start with.
197;In fact, it's my dream to see a 4 disc or a last 2.
198;one of the best movies ever filmed!
199;deserved Oscar for best picture and Borgnine for best actor!
200;This work meant, in the middle of this bleak and turbulent decade, the most intimate familiar portrait filmed.
201;somehow this film has several common issues with It's a wonderful life.
202;The best proof I can argue is the double cross that sealed that decade.
203;unforgettable acting of Borgnine who won deservedly the Academy Prize as Best Actor in 1955.
204;An excellent example is an early scene in which Clara (Betsy Blair) appears at a night club.
205;the later scenes involving Marty and Clara ring so true in their simplicity.
206;layered film that also has a powerful emotional kick.
207;MARTY is straight forward filmmaking at its best.
208;law with their respective mothers and mothers.
209;It is a classic in the form of the film.
210;this film is all the more important because it is on such works that Marshall McLuhan built a whole theory about hot and cool media.
211;The cinema is hot because of the high definition, the wide screen and the wide shots, whereas television is cool because of the low definition and the image concentrating on one character if not a close.
212;it is funny to read all that theory built on such a film and the black and white television with an oblong screen.
213;If you really want to see the difference with todays TV you watch the series Lost: high definition and big screen permit wide pictures, a lot of action and numerous characters with a lot of detail.
214;But Television enables the director to use a lot of flashbacks and flash.
215;Pulp Fiction is one rare film that does not follow a timeline within the plot but cut it up and jumbles the pieces.
216;But it is one film, even one exception.
217;this film here demonstrates how important it is to have a logical timeline.
218;And the film can easily have the punch line it has.
219;Very human and real plot that many viewers can identify with.
220;Would enjoy seeing it over and over.
221;but even such thoughts are strictly forbidden by your religion.
222;this film won 4 Oscars and the Best Picture of 1955.
223;This film captures the very heart of what it is to be lonely, find love, and sacrifice.
224;I like the fact that this new relationship mirrors his life as to what it is.
225;and he can get a clearer picture of it and make the change.
226;This is a great movie and I highly recommend it.
227;This film is a true gem.
228;All performances are great and the writing is superb.
229;The present day Hollywood should take a lesson from a film like Marty.
230;This is how to make a REALLY good movie.
231;"If ever there was a male version of the ""chick flick"", this film fits the bill."
232;Marty is one of those movies that everyone can appreciate because it has such a universal message.
233;Every time I watch this sleeper hit it makes me cry because it's uplifting and a little sentimental.
234;Mr. Ernest Borgnine was amazing as the lonely and self.
235;It was especially riveting to watch the transformation as Marty shifted from his everyday persona to his passionate and private self.
236;Marty still lives at home like a good Italian.
237;When he builds up the confidence to ask a lady to dance she politely declines.
238;Anyway, it goes without saying that Marty took her in his arms and it was love at first sight.
239;She held her breath and had such a look of anticipation (like a woman gets in her 10th month of pregnancy.)
240;He yells to his friend Angie (Joe Mantell,) in perhpaps one of the most honest revelations and thought.
241;provoking displays of honesty ever depicted on the big screen: All I know is I had a good time last night.
242;If we make a party on New Year's, I got a date for that party.
243;Marty is a significant film for a myriad of reasons.
244;It's perhaps one of the first pictures of its type that displays the social and personal problems from a guy's perspective.
245;"It's also an important movie because it showcases both a ""modern"" or a ""young"" way of thinking (Marty's/Clara's) as well as a very traditional or archaic way of thinking (by Marty's mother and aunt.)"
246;"I also really enjoy this movie because it has such a positive message
247;incidentally, Mr. Borgnine is still very much alive.
248;He is actually the oldest Oscar winner and in July, his autobiography,Erniewill be published!
249;Ernest Borgnine won best actor and shows a tenderness toward the leading lady and his family but ultimately challenges his friends and their approach to life and dating.
250;A good film well worth watching.
251;This is 1955's best movie.
252;would recommend this movie to anyone, even newer generation who need to see good movies.
253;Written by the vastly talented Paddy Chayefsky, who'd go on to script """"Network"""" two decades later, """"Marty"""" is a sweet, perceptive film about two lost souls who finally find each other."""
254;Borgnine, a skilled character actor and supporting player, won the Best Actor Oscar in 1955 over several more photogenic leading men, and the film itself.
255;a playhouse gem from television's golden age.
256;won for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay.
257;A unique and irresistible film romance.
258;This is a simple, unadorned but effective mellowdrama.
259;"He is a ""mama's boy"" and is approaching middle age, alone."
260;marty realizes that this is his last best chance for love and happiness.
261;He's found a woman who sees beyond the physical and really likes him.
262;He makes the right choice with a heartwarming finish.
263;But the next day the pressures of Marty's life.
264;this is a wonderful film which captures the loneliness and self.
265;rate and the dialogue is memorable.
266;As others have said, you will lose sight of the fact that these people are actors, they make the characters so real.
267;And realize that at one time, we made good movies in this country and at one time our cities were livable and people actually dressed up to go out in public instead of looking like a bunch of homeless people.
268;It is a great movie and a glimpse of an America that we let slip away.
269;the great screenwriter paddy chayefsky came to prominence with this movie about a night in the life of a lonely 35ish butcher from the bronx.
270;ernest borgnine had the role of his career, reflecting a man wrestling with his loneliness in the face of expectations of himself and from others, with strong supporting work from the rest of the cast.
271;It is a fine film, exploring the lonliness of plain people who would like to love and be loved.
272;The motivation, acting, and casting are all superb.
273;The writer understood human nature, and it showed.
274;"She is certainly not a ""plain"" girl, as cast."
275;She is really quite beautiful, and in fact in real life is Gene Kelly's wife.
276;But they made her as plain as possible, with makeup (or lack of same), and she played the part beautifully.
277;As far as that goes, Borgnine himself was an attractive man at that age.
278;i enjoyed the show, and thought it an excellent study in human nature and self.
279;A wonderful story with great acting.
280;i absolutely love this film!!!
281;Ernest Borgnine is perfect in this role as a middle aged bachelor (still living at home with his mother) who has pretty much given up on ever finding that special someone to share his life with.
282;When he finally meets his match, (a plain, sweet and somewhat mousy schoolteacher), at the local dance hall, it is as if his life has just begun.
283;Of all the films I've seen about falling in love, and I've seen plenty, this one appeals to me on all kinds of levels.
284;Yes, I'm a soggy sap of a chap but I love a good love story.
285;Said it was for Regions 2 and 4.
286;Outstanding film and Ernest Borgnine deserved his Oscar.
287;He did a great job as the average joe who everyone gave a hard time to because he wasn't married when all his younger sisters and brothers were married.
288;It's fantastic when he decides what they think does not matter its what matters is what he thinks and feels.
289;This is a very sweet movie.
290;"You'll enjoy viewing it ""with the girls."""
291;which is important to me.
292;He's been looking for a girl every Saturday night of his life and always gets his heart broken.
293;It really is as good as the hype.
294;It's a national treasure, in that it captured the lives of common folk in 1950s New York and it's very interesting to see how society has changed since then.
295;What isn't gone is the universal agony of loneliness and Ernest Borgnine portrays this beautifully.
296;"He's loveable, profound, and makes acting look effortless
297;All of the supporting cast is outstanding, especially the two ladies who play Marty's mother and aunt.
298;Bring your hankie"
299;"Not many stars can convincingly call themselves and their supporting actress ""dogs"" and still win an Academy Award."
300;to find a nice young woman and get married.
301;Borgnine delivers a powerful performance on lessons in non.
302;"costar Betsy Blair's name appeared in the ""Red Channels"" during the McCarthy era, effectively ending her acting career in the early 50s."
303;Against all odds she won the role of a lifetime in this 1955 cinematic classic MARTY after dance legend Gene Kelly, her husband of 17 years (1940.1957), threatened to stop shooting pictures for MGM if she wasn't allowed the lead part despite the blacklist.
304;it is a movie i can watch over and over again!
305;"All your brothers and sisters, younger than you, they get married and got the children.Ernest Borgnine's Oscar winning performance as the title character in ""Marty"" is so captivating that you might forget the real star of this film is writer Paddy Chayefsky."
306;"the telecast of ""Marty"" made Chayefsky one of the greatest writers of television's ""Golden Age,"" second only to Rod Serling (""Patterns,"" ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"")."
307;Two years later Chayefsky and director Delbert Mann reunited in Hollywood to make a 90.
308;minute film version of the story, which was expanded masterfully by the author as he explored the pain of being unwanted.
309;What makes their rejection painful is that they are both decent people, who come together because they are able to recognize their own decent qualities in each other.
310;I certainly think his performance is both convincing and compelling.
311;esteem and sense of confidence has been completely eroded away by friends and family.
312;"most Romantic Lines: These might not be overly romantic, but they are great Chayeksky dialogue: (1) ""All right, so I'll go to the Stardust Ballroom."
313;I'll put on a blue suit, and I'll go.
314;"A big night of heartache""
315;You see, you're not such a dog as you think you are"""""
316;"Really a nice face""
317;The reason I tell you this is because I want to see you again .
318;I want very much to see you again."""""""
319;Because they all tell love stories in which love comes relatively late in the game for people who believed it was never coming at all.
320;Written by the gifted Paddy Chayefsky, this is a memorable film, deftly directed by Delbert Mann.
321;That it has a stage.
322;She takes her cue from her sister, Marty's Aunt Catherine, who is living with her son and daughter.
323;Consequently, she is going to move in with Marty and his mother.
324;Clara, a well educated, nice plain.
325;as the film peels the layers from Marty, the viewer meets the sensitive, kind man who lives within the unattractive exterior.
326;Aunt Catherine's ouster from her son's home, as the older, unwanted woman with few options in life, also makes an impact on the viewer.
327;all in all, this is an excellent film.
328;Those who enjoyed this film should also seek out another Paddy Chayefsky film, The Catered Affair , starring Bette Davis and Ernest Borgnine, which is a bitter sweet film about another Bronx family.
329;It is just as or more important than a review of the movie itself.
330;I was so surprised the first time I watched this movie.
331;It is heartwarming, and a slice of the human condition, no matter the year.
332;The acting is a bit old fashioned, and the script a bit predictable at points, but a sweet lovely story.
333;A movie that the whole family can watch together.
334;Just an old fashioned good time.
335;It's a simple story but it is so real that I felt I knew Marty personally.
336;There is Marty's mother who is afraid of living her own old age alone.
337;When Marty meets her at a dance where she has just been dumped by a blind date, he finds they have a lot in common and they both enjoy the evening immensely.
338;in spite of the film being made more than 46 years ago, it was still fresh and real.
339;Paddy Chayefsky was a master with dialog.
340;And the audience just gets it .
341;It's about family and love and simple things in life.
342;The acting was so real that I forgot they were actors.
343;I loved it and give it one of my highest recommendations.
344;And strange to say, it is!
345;Marty was a modest movie that made a big splash at the theatres back in the 1950s, and even garnered top honors at the Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Ernest Borgnine.
346;"This causes a passionate outburst from him, about his own physical deficiencies among other things, winding up, ""So I'll put on the blue suit and I'll go to the dance."
347;It's a very honestly depicted scene, and one that will resonate all too deeply for anyone who has ever felt unlucky not just in love, but in getting any attention they crave from the opposite sex.
348;It's very well done and the audience can't help but feel for the two people tentatively putting their emotions on the line, hoping for acceptance at last.
349;"i hadn't seen ""Marty"" in many years before viewing it again, and I can say it really hits home today."
350;Every dog sure has his day!

357;this is one of his finest movie role's ever and how very well he did it.
358;what A Wonderful movie and it's a welcome addition to our collection.
359;It was great to see Marty back away from the peer pressure to do what is right and connect with the love of his life!
360;Nevertheless, this motion picture is a great example of how little the human condition has changed.
361;marty is a great dramatic film, the special effects are superb acting and writing.

381;Ernest Borgnine shines in this story, and I'm impressed with his acting every time I watch it.
382;Excellent film they dont have the guts to make em this good anymore, this movie reminded me of my friday and saturday night singles dance years, i always felt like marty in the movie, i even met a girl like the one he met in the movie, a very realistic portrail of how people operate.

391;No matter,it is still a great movie with excellent characters and story.
392;Great acting from Mr. Borgnine that won him the Best Actor award.
393;Marty is an oddity in Academy Award winning history.
394;It is the first and only time a movie based upon a popular television show has won Best Picture.
395;"Her concern over her son's bachelorhood is quite comical, referring to girls as ""tomatoes"" and suggesting that her son ""pluck one"" that is ripe for the picking at a local dance."

399;The audio is mono but exceptionally well balanced.

406;Except, this film is truer to life in that it has real ups and downs.
407;"Many people lead happy lives with hardships and trials similar to Marty
408;like behavior, see Marty: it's brief (the shortest Best Picture winner, in fact), well.
409;Lets forget just for a momnet the fine performances of all of the cast in this picture.
410;the thing that makes this this movie great is the Italian family and how they are written.
411;is about as real as it comes.
412;one of the most real movies you will ever see.
413;He also did the screenplay.
414;It is a relatively short film but it packs a powerful message.
415;Joe Martell is very credible in the role of Marty's buddy Angie.
416;the movie walked off with several Academy Awards in 1955 receiving Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Delbert Mann), Best Actor (Ernest Borgnine) and Best Screenplay.
417;Anna Magnanni won the Oscar for Best Actress in that same year for her appearance in THE ROSE TATOO.
418;Marty is a great movie!
419;The lesson of this movie is: companionship and connecting with someonedoesn't always start with the visual.
420;It's all about how that person makes you feel when you're with them!
421;Marty is such a charming and enchanting film.
422;Ernest Borgnine definitely deserved his best actor Oscar for this film.
423;This film won the academy award for best picture so it must have been mainstream in its day.
424;Its just amazing to think that a mere 60 years ago that life could be lived this way in New York City.
425;The attitudes about marriage and woman are amazing in this film.
426;It is also entertaining in its own quaint way.

428;his best friend who had to spend Saturday night by himself, and his loving mother, who fears what will happen to her if he gets married.
429;the film is a success that still rings true today because of its truthful simplicity.
430;See it and get back to basics!
431;It gave me a definite warm and fuzzy feeling.
432;I just loved the way the story ended up and the couple in the movie just warmed my heart.
433;It's a great love story!
434;I will have many enjoyable moments.
435;Great performance from Frank Sutton too!
436;If you like the classics, you'll love this one.
437;The movie MARTY was great.
438;It deserved to win Best Picture Ireceived the package in 48 hours.
439;Since the days of silent pictures, Hollywood has given us stories of beautiful and glamorous women who are romanced by dashing heroes with magnificent profiles.
440;Their movies make for pleasant escape fare and have given us all unwarranted expectations: I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.
441;Marty is one of the rare movies that tells about real people and what really matters in human relationships.
442;But they are good and decent people who luckily find each other one night, while Marty's friends fixate on Mickey Spillane's way of handling dolls, wild nurses who are drunk, and whatever on earth is on 72nd Street and Union City.
443;the acting is first rate, start to finish.
444;While this is no """"date movie"""" that would appeal to the dim bulbs of the world, it is a top notch film in every respect."""
445;Simple story which captures pain of the everyday single man.
446;Ernest Borgnine was a fantastic actor, and we were all on his side when he finally broke away from his friends and went after the girl.
447;One of the few movies in which the man and woman were not handsome and beautiful, but they found happiness just the same.
448;He brings an awareness of his own plainness that never leaves his face.
449;I highly recommend this to people who like small films.
450;this is a great movie and I gave it 5 stars.
451;Marty is not only one of the great American films of the 20th Century, but the greatest American romance ever made.
452;He's a sweet natured guy with a good heart, stocky build and not so perfect looks.
453;He's feeling pressure from customers, friends and family to get married.
454;This is the brilliant plot twist in Chayefsky's screenplay.
455;"this is a great film
456;Within Chayefsky's simple character study of a South Bronx Butcher is a deep multileveled examination of love and the human condition.
457;On the surface it looks like Marty's family and friends are interested in his happiness by pressuring him to get married.
458;Miserable and dissatisfied with their own lives.
459;They secretly want to take away Marty's happiness!
460;While Marty represents courage, drive and character to Clara, something she desires in her own life.
461;Both inspire each other to make the changes in their lives to find happiness and self.
462;I love this movie!Production values are amazing on this movie.
463;Filming on location works to great advantage for Director Delbert Mann.
464;As a lifelong resident of the South Bronx, it was a delight to take a trip through time and see places I go to shop and hang out on the weekends like Webster Avenue and Fordham Road looked like over 50 years ago.
465;paddy Chayefsky's Oscar Winning screenplay is a work of art.
466;Plain and simple it is brilliant.
467;Every line has a purpose"
468;The dialogue feels real, the storyline tighter than a drum It is the work of a master of his craft at the height of his prime.
469;the acting here is some of the best I have ever seen.
470;Ernest Borgnine is powerful as Marty.
471;He brings warmth, humanity and love and compassion to the character.
472;He deserved his Oscar for best actor.
473;Betsy is beautiful as the dowdy schoolteacher Clara.
474;She has great chemistry with Borgnine and brings out the inner beauty of her homely character.
475;Joe Mantell is great as Marty's buddy Angie.
476;He felt just like a neighborhood guy from that era.
477;"aged women sit in the house contemplating their lonely futures is one of the best scenes in the movie
478;Marty took a stand and appears to have a happy ending.
479;Have loved this movie for a long time.
480;Bought this used disc in great condition and it plays like new!
481;Ernest Borgnine stars in this delightful character study of a butcher who yearns for love and family among the well.
482;Paddy Chayevsky's tightly woven script provides sparkling dialogue as Marty discovers a woman who, in a sense, completes him.
483;We are not the dogs everyone thinks we are, is a gruff but authentic sentiment that pervades the entire film and offers an uplifting spirituality of love and discovery in a cynical world.
484;the joy of this film is its simplicity.
485;and yet it manages to pull at the heartstrings with the joyful reality that comes from the emerging recognition of true love.
486;This movie is an essential for anyone who considers themselves a lover of film.
487;Beautifully shot in black and white, Marty offers an intimate story of a forlorn man, giving up on the idea of love until he meets a woman in much the same situation.
488;ernest Borgnine is fantastic in his portrayal of Marty the lonely butcher, a role that earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor.
489;This is a very sweet love story that never bothers with convention or cliche, and is a must.
490;I see why he won the Oscar for his performance!
491;Does this make a great movie?
492;In other words, if the scriptwriter and director manage to assemble a cinematic work that refrains from making any false steps during the course of 90 minutes, does this along cause the movie to be a great movie?
493;thus, the above list represents certain qualities that pertain to a chunk of the American populace.
494;But what makes this film a successful one, is that the sterotypical story is skillfully presented.
495;mr. Borgnine's goal of obtaining domestic bliss is occasionally threatened.
496;Actress and dancer Betsy Blair provides the love interest.
497;But these work to Mr. Borgnine's advantage, because he has the same qualities which, in a similarly encumbered counterpart, can ignite the chemistry of love.
498;thirties man, in his quest for domestic bliss.
499;In this case, Mr. Borgnine's quest is to find a wife, and also, to rise above his role of being an ordinary butcher, and to own his own butcher shop.
500;The movie provides a skillful account of the """"drama queen"""" personality."""
501;The three of them are exceptionally skilled at getting into arguments with each other.
502;"Similar ""drama queen"" type bickering can be found in ABOUT SCHMIDT, with Jack Nicholson, and in the film, AMADEUS."
503;A continual theme in MARTY, which adds charm to the movie, are the Italianisms, which take the form of broken English, pride for Italian things (Mr. Borgnine expressed pride in Italian meat for his butcher shop), and Sunday mass.
504;An excellent counterpoint to MARTY is the film, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, starring Anthony Quinn.
505;"Unlike MARTY, REQUIEM is a very unusual movie, with intriguingly unique characters, for example, a female gangster named, ""Ma Greenie."""
506;Everyone in the world is looking for love.
507;Husband and wives long to love each other.
508;The movies are filled with this universal search.
509;MARTY is one of the most rare films ever to come out of Hollywood.
510;mARTY is a very heartwarming, honest, sincere romantic movie.
511;It was made 50 years ago, yet it still resonates with audiences still today.
512;"The film is very true
513;It touches at the core of our soul and stirs are hearts.
514;It is a truly moving movie, yet one that isn't sentimental or sappy.
515;ernest Borgnine won a Best Actor Oscar and his performance is well deserved.
516;Very seldom has an everyman been captured so well on film.
517;Chayefsky's writing is pure genius and is the essence of what makes the film work.
518;besides winning the 1956 Academy Award for Best Picture and just being a great, moving movie, MARTY is also signifcant for several other reasons.
519;It is the only movie to have won both the Best Picture Oscar and the Cannes Palme d'Or.
520;Although this movie predates me by many years, I enjoy watching it.
521;You take the walk with him as he finally finds a woman to love besides his mother.
522;It was clear to see why Borgnine received the best actor award for his performance in this movie.
523;He was outstanding along with the movie.
524;Beautiful film about two misfits that meet at a dance hall and discover they have more in common than they could have imagined.
525;Great movie, good transmission, very clear, sharp.
526;thankfully, Borgnine portrays himself with good heart and a sense of curiosity in this film that even young men who have not had much experience with dating and relationships can say.
527;I could relate a lot to the character's emotional periods and sense of humour.
528;done effort and I hope more people within the interest of film and television catch this little gem."""""""
529;Amazing acting and a good story of the old days in America, the more innocent days in this country, the days when one could walk the streets of any large city and not worry about getting yourself killed.
530;Marty came out when I was ten, and still too young to think about dating, but this tale of how unattractive but decent people hooked up in '50's big city America still resonates with those of us who are not photogenic, slim, or sexy.
531;A movie as good as they used to make'em in the good ol days,Watch it an have a great fun
532;A 4 Oscar movie classic and possibly Ernest Borgnine's best work.
533;Even this abbreviated version is well worth watching but a full version would, of course, be even better.
