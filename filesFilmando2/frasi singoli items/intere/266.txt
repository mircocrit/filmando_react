I:14626;1;Not a true retelling of Thermopylae but a fantastic movie just the same and an excellent adaptation of Miller's graphic Novel.
I:14626;2;The choreography of the fight scenes is some of the best I have ever seen.
I:14626;3;Couple this with some well done special effects, and a good old fashion good guy bad guy plot line and this is a definite must own.
I:14626;4;I mean common, it was based on a comic book people!
I:14626;5;I laugh at the reviews saying it was not true to history and that it was a Gladiator rip off.
I:14626;6;I went to see this movie with a group of men simply just to see some action/killing.
I:14626;7;And for Gladiator, I watch that once every two days.
I:14626;8;There are plenty of better movies out there that will keep you interested.
I:14626;9;But when that primal instinct for action comes over you, just watch key scenes from 300 and you will be okay.
I:14626;10;"[He and our sons are fans/critics of graphic novels, comic book officianados/collectors/commentators who had anxiously awaited the film's release
I:14626;11;HOWEVER, I was absolutely stunned by this movie.
I:14626;12;it is captivating, artistic, motivational, and NEVER dull.
I:14626;13;eye, but the sheer choreography of this movie throughout makes it worth viewing multiple times.
I:14626;14;sensual as well as visual .

I:14626;16;"mo"" sequences, with the graphic novel effects, especially complemented the film's genre and delivery
I:14626;17;The whole presentation was a work of art, w/ a masterfully rendered musical score contributing even more to the emotion of each scene .
I:14626;18;The portrayal of dignity and peace, even in death, was phenomenal.
I:14626;19;"while I do know enough of ancient history to understand there were deviations from the truth, it was opportune that the History Channel chose to air the ""real"" accounting of events of Thermopylae/the 300 several times during the premiere week, so it was an excellent way to set the record straight in my mind."
I:14626;20;and maybe I'll share it with my husband!
I:14626;21;So, enjoy 300 with your buddies.
I:14626;22;If you have speedos, perfect.
I:14626;23;What you then do is wrestle, one on one.
I:14626;24;The winner of each match goes on to play a winner from the opposing side in another match, until you have your champion.
I:14626;25;The winner will be king, ruler of you all, for the rest of the day.
I:14626;26;'300' is a bloody epic that combines the best of the old and new.
I:14626;27;Sporting sweeping cinematography that is partly colorized and partly bleached, the film has the effect of being a glorified version of an older film.
I:14626;28;Sensuality from barebreasted women to men is sweeping red capes and loinclothes is up front to mix with the bloodbath of killer war scenes that artfully show hand.
I:14626;29;"Sometimes the story is narrated
I:14626;30;The political developments help to deepen the story and keep us from a continual overdrive.
I:14626;31;I never watched this movie, but my son said it was pretty good.
I:14626;32;Great prices and received fast.
I:14626;33;as a history geek I loved the movie because frankly, a documentary isn't as exciting.
I:14626;34;Action, adventure, drama, epicocity, and pure unadulterated awesomeness.
I:14626;35;I am a fan of both the graphic novel and of the movie.
I:14626;36;ray disk for things that would make use of the intense graphics.
I:14626;37;300 is a perfect example of what Blu.
I:14626;38;Wife saw it first time other night, we loved it.
I:14626;39;Total dude flick but worth it.
I:14626;40;Indulging, entertaining and highly tragic.
I:14626;41;Very rewarding for the individual who enjoys a taste of history combined with the remarkable blends of fantasy.
I:14626;42;Rich in every cinematic scene you feel swept away to another world that does not dwell on the common ground of history or reality, but it's own plane of the artistic subconscious.
I:14626;43;I love Zack Snyder's surreal special effects on all his movies.
I:14626;44;The movie is very entertaining, the soundtrack by Tyler Bates goes great with every scene, and Gerard Butler is great, but this is where I fell in love with Michael Fassbender.
I:14626;45;Many of the graphic novel elements are kept, as well as some historical facts.
I:14626;46;Not much is known about the spartans, and this is not an historically correct movie either, but some facts are kept, some are changed, either way, I really enjoyed this movie, and now I can enjoy it in amazingly high.
I:14626;47;This movie will look good regardless of what format its on.
I:14626;48;It's one of the coolest movies of the past few years.
I:14626;49;Even if you don't like the plot, you'll enjoy the slick effects (CG done right for a change) and wicked action.
I:14626;50;ray player, this is why you bought it.
I:14626;51;I'm used to getting a nicely polished package (double.
I:14626;52;ray disc itself is excellent.
I:14626;53;The bonus features are fine.
I:14626;54;I still like this movie and have watched it several times.
I:14626;55;I thought this movie aesthetically amazing.
I:14626;56;Again, I thought this movie was great.
I:14626;57;Tyler Bates constructed a soundtrack that is as amazing and striking as the rest of the film.
I:14626;58;300 is the most amazing combination of violent destruction and graceful elegance I believe I have ever witnessed on the big screen.
I:14626;59;The damn thing was so intense I wanted to be *in* the film.
I:14626;60;As a film in the purely entertaining role I think it deserves a 5 star rating, it is riveting, very well crafted and a very good adaptation of Miller's graphic novel.
I:14626;61;That's all I can say about this movie.
I:14626;62;It's a great adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel.
I:14626;63;Now, that's exactly what it is: a movie based on a graphic novel which is based on actual historical events.
I:14626;64;Anyone who is a fan of Miller's work will thoroughly enjoy this.
I:14626;65;This is meant to be an epic story with great drama and fantastic acts of bravery.
I:14626;66;This is my pick for best movie of 2007.
I:14626;67;The special edition has deleted scenes and a documentary of the real spartans, as well as all the behind the scenes footage plus the training the actors went through.
I:14626;68;300 is one of the best movies to view on blu ray disc.
I:14626;69;Good acting if you like the gladiator movies.
I:14626;70;300 is a visually stunning combination of Sin City and Gladiator.
I:14626;71;Let your eyes feast on the graphical masterpiece alone and you'll be impressed.
I:14626;72;Immerse yourself in the well.
I:14626;73;if you think this film is for you, you'll love it.
I:14626;74;If you haven't seen it yet, watch it.
I:14626;75;This is a great movie.
I:14626;76;The extras are very good.
I:14626;77;300 is as much about the telling of the tale as it is about the tale told.
I:14626;78;the sword and sandal epic.
I:14626;79;Except that all sets are CGI, and that is where the movie excels.
I:14626;80;it is gothic for two reasons.
I:14626;81;It is quite curious, though, that this movie gets the greenlight at a time when the US is at war with Iraq.
I:14626;82;It is all quite curious, but Great Entertainment.
I:14626;83;This movie is classic gladiator and deserves more than one viewing to capture it's genuis.
I:14626;84;I've enjoyed the movie's special effects and fight scenes.
I:14626;85;"So, be brave as the SPARTA'S and see 300 with a open mind, then you either can become one of the two viewers which is those who ""get it"" or those who don't."
I:14626;86;Take this film unique style for what it's worth.
I:14626;87;I finally got around to seeing this film after so much talk about how awesome it is, and so many spoofs and parodies done about it.
I:14626;88;After studying film, I enjoy that this movie, although very CGI (but you couldn't pull off even 1/20 the visuals without it), this movie takes you into the mystical and inspiring world of ancient Greece, and tells of the legendary 300 spartans.
I:14626;89;Spartans, what is your profession?HAWOO!
I:14626;90;Gerad Butler is awesome and just a well written movie.
I:14626;91;The action love and passion make this a great flick.
I:14626;92;Amazing movie, but a litte bit science fiction, but anyways it's pretty good.
I:14626;93;I'd even go so far to say that this is the best gladiator film I've ever seen.
I:14626;94;"The cool visuals, the Spartans' unstoppable onslaught against the Persians, the booming score
I:14626;95;See it on the big screen while you can, you won't be disappointed!
I:14626;96;I think this reflects the idea that dark somehow equals serious and adult, so that for example Superman is given a brown and dark blue costume rather than one in the bright primary colours which suit him best, and insecure adults who worry about such things can be assured that although what they're watching is a fantasy, and/or based on a comic or children's book, it's worthy of their attention.
I:14626;97;(Snyder also has a curious penchant for setting things on the edges of cliffs.
I:14626;98;the sequence at the beginning of the film, in which a young Leonidas kills a huge wolf by tricking it into a narrow space, is a terrific piece of filmmaking, summing up and foreshadowing the conflict to come.
I:14626;99;One of the best graphic novel type films.
I:14626;100;Thoroughly enjoyable and Gerard Butler gets the line that will be one of the top great remembered lines in cinematic history.
I:14626;101;Doing the right thing with character even in the face of dire consequencesspeaks of conviction, honor, principled discipline and a willingness to serve others above self.
I:14626;102;Oh, for such men today, as the religion of me.
I:14626;103;the film itself is excellent and deserves the big screen treatment.
I:14626;104;The battle of the Thermopylai is one of the highest point of Valor in the Western tradition.
I:14626;105;like heroes, the Persians represent everything debauched and capricious and the Spartan ideal of Tirtaeus, beautiful indeed is dying in the first rank permeates the entire movie.
I:14626;106;I loved everything about this movie.
I:14626;107;It's the style of the movie that gets you.
I:14626;108;the battle scenes were fun, fun, fun.
I:14626;109;The special effects were good and so was the ending, even if you knew what was going to happen.
I:14626;110;This is just way too much fun and will probably be a classic for this genre in the years to come.
I:14626;111;This us a well done adaptation of an epic chapter in history.
I:14626;112;I was impressed with the cinematography.
I:14626;113;While small parts were over the top for dramatic effect the story was well told and we'll played.
I:14626;114;I love this movie and I liked the fact I got the movie for 5cents!
I:14626;115;This is a great movie.
I:14626;116;Great choice if you want a refresher before going to see the sequel.
I:14626;117;roduct DescriptionThe epic graphic novel by Frank Miller (Sin City) assaults the screen with the blood, thunder and awe of its ferocious visual style faithfully recreated in an intense blend of live.
I:14626;118;And moviemaking with a cutting edge.
I:14626;119;the film does have it entertaining moments in the movie i love the gore scenes that really get into the movie.
I:14626;120;frank miller is very good at creating stories full of blood and gore and violence.

I:14626;122;It was good, I enjoyed watching it.
I:14626;123;best movie if there ever was one.
I:14626;124;This movie is an absolute spectacle.
I:14626;125;Some parts are very violent and perverse, but the overall message is spot.
I:14626;126;This is one of my favorite movies of all time and a must.
I:14626;127;Perfect blu ray, fast shipping and great product!
I:14626;128;Brand new as described, highly recommended!
I:14626;129;Cannot beat the price, best deal I've seen!
I:14626;130;The movie is incredible, one of the most remarkable epic movies of all times.
I:14626;131;The facts are twisted in order to bring the most spectacular story possible.
I:14626;132;Always enjoy the clarity of Blu.
I:14626;133;The movie is really intense, and it is gory, but if you are a guy you will probably really enjoy it.
I:14626;134;"Every frame is a painting worthy of hanging
I:14626;135;Visually appealing, the sepia tones lend support to the mythology aspect.
I:14626;136;Overall, a very entertaining bit of escapism.
I:14626;137;I rated the movie a 3 to balance the weak story telling with the stunning visual display.
I:14626;138;I enjoyed the movie but found it to be highly fictional and it took many liberties with history.
I:14626;139;My husband and I can watch this movie over and over again.
I:14626;140;This is a great story.
I:14626;141;Not only does it illustrate the conviction of being principled but that a few good men can make a difference if they stand together and fight as one for what is right.
I:14626;142;beautiful graphics good story, and great acting.
I:14626;143;300 is one of, if not the, best comic book movie ever made.
I:14626;144;I thought it was beautifully shot, well.
I:14626;145;all of that aside, I was happy to be able to show a friend a great movie!
I:14626;146;Awesome movie, but I think I liked the first one better though.
I:14626;147;The ship fights were pretty cool and the female villain was good.
I:14626;148;Great movie and to get it in high def was totally awesome.
I:14626;149;I enjoyed watching my husband's face light up when he saw this title.
I:14626;150;I got this movie for the entertainment value, not as a history lesson.
I:14626;151;I really enjoyed watching it.
I:14626;152;Good story line, good action but not excessively bloody.
I:14626;153;Yes, I will watch this one many times.
I:14626;154;Yeah it's campy at times, almost a cartoonish flavor.
I:14626;155;but it's one of my all time favorite movies.
I:14626;156;Fantatic acting by some wonderful actors and actresses.
I:14626;157;This is a must see!
I:14626;158;I love it, it's a guy movie, 1% fact, 99% lie and great action packed movie.
I:14626;159;I recommend this movie for anyone's collection.
I:14626;160;Still a theme for today.you realize the parallels in modern America and its simply shocking!
I:14626;161;The best review I can give it is the fact my Dad even liked it.
I:14626;162;I don't go for gore movies but this story is amazing and well told.
I:14626;163;The visuals are amazing and the acting is mostly above par.
I:14626;164;Gerard Butler offers an amazing performance.
I:14626;165;While 300 is by no means a historical account of the epic battle of Persians v Greeks, it is great fun!
I:14626;166;I loved every gory vibrant scene.
I:14626;167;See the movie for the visual splendor and engaging story.

I:14626;169;"300 / B000Q6GX5Y*Spoilers*As a spectacle fighting movie, ""300"" is a joy to behold."
I:14626;170;The fighting sequences are beautifully choreographed, and the camera work is superb.
I:14626;171;Special effects merge flawlessly with the rest of the action, and it is a delight to see what a big budget and talented cast can produce when they put their minds to it.
I:14626;172;Even the soundtrack and soothing narrative overlay are gorgeous, combining to make the frequent and varied battle scenes a feast for the eyes and ears.
I:14626;173;"And the stunning visual effects aren't limited to the battleground

I:14626;179;as a final note, having owned both the Blu.
I:14626;180;ray version is worth shelling out the extra money.
I:14626;181;First of all, I watched this movie in the theatre before it came out and thought it was an excellent movie.

I:14626;183;ray movies such as apocalypto and planet earth.
I:14626;184;because director Zack Snyder stayed true to Frank Miller's graphic novel, all of Miller's research into the historical battle appeared in the movie.
I:14626;185;That's black humor that is part of the military ethos to this day.
I:14626;186;When their swords broke, they used their nails and teeth.
I:14626;187;"The tenacity, ferocity, and courage of the Spartans is why we still know their names today

I:14626;189;the movie itself is beautiful, hyper.
I:14626;190;That the heroic nude is a cornerstone of the art world?
I:14626;191;The plot is simple because the idea at the heart of it is simple.
I:14626;192;historical movies don't have to be documentaries, and the success of 300 is proof of that idea.
I:14626;193;The great concepts don't have to be diluted in melodrama and politically correct casting choices.
I:14626;194;This movie was simply spectacular!!!
I:14626;195;The depth and darkness of the movie makes it simply beautiful and powerful to watch.
I:14626;196;It's haunting as well as chilling, but heart.
I:14626;197;This movie was just simply spectacular.
I:14626;198;I could defiantly say the best movie so far of the year!!!
I:14626;199;This is defiantly a movie to own!
I:14626;200;other bits of artistic license are cool, though.
I:14626;201;The movie is fun to watch and you get to see my rock hard body on these guys.
I:14626;202;It was a good movie, not a great one.
I:14626;203;The CGI is impressive at times but never really excellent.
I:14626;204;300 is a fun movie which if you don't know what it's about I suggest that you look up a synopsis at [.]
I:14626;205;"it"" factor of the movie it is definitely top notch."
I:14626;206;There are also quotes from the real battle used in the movie.
I:14626;207;these quotes show the amazing bravery of the Greek fighters.
I:14626;208;this is a very engaging dreamlike account of a relatively small group of fighters who helped make a BIG difference in the history of Europe.
I:14626;209;For anyone who loves or even just respects Democracy, what happened at Thermopylae should be of high interest.
I:14626;210;I hope that this movie inspires people to read what is actually known about this heroic event.
I:14626;211;I bought this movie for my boyfriend because he loved it.
I:14626;212;It came in great condition, and in a very reasonable amount of time!
I:14626;213;The key to any superhero comic movie (because these Spartans can't be human) is for the hero to be endearing to the audience.
I:14626;214;"His lines range in depth and complexity from ""SPARTAAAAANS!"
I:14626;215;His effort to hoist a shield and thrust a spear is almost heartwarming in its attempts, yet Leonidas haughtily says that since he can't raise his shield high enough for long enough, he can't fight in a phalanx (which is particularly ironic, since the Spartans never fight in a phalanx in the entire movie save for the first battle.
I:14626;216;a lot of movie cross.
I:14626;217;I will say first and foremost that if you are looking for an absorbing and well told story, as in engrossing plot and tightly woven script, then this is not the movie for you.
I:14626;218;While I can't say that it is as fulfilling as `Gladiator' I can say that it is far more entertaining then recent swords.
I:14626;219;"sandals fare like `Alexander' and will at least leave you very much entertained
I:14626;220;what is important to remember when considering watching `300' is that it is based on the graphic novel written by `Sin City' author Frank Miller.
I:14626;221;Gerard Butler looks amazing (he looks as if he could break my neck with his abs), as does his army and they all fight masterfully.
I:14626;222;The fight sequences are phenomenally done, intense and gratuitous.
I:14626;223;We were promised some impressive action scenes and we receive them in spades.
I:14626;224;After watching CGI slowly erode films like `I Am Legend' I was half expecting this to be a complete mess with corny special effects and ridiculous enemies, but everything looks and feels real and amazingly detailed.
I:14626;225;"Like my friend told me after the movie ended
I:14626;226;I really Liked this Movie.
I:14626;227;this movie is very well done.

I:14626;233;This movie is a must see!
I:14626;234;Full of action and easy to follow.
I:14626;235;My 14 year old son has never seen this flick, as a huge fan of the movie I felt it was my job to share.
I:14626;236;Maybe the story is not completely historically accurate, but this movie is a work of art.
I:14626;237;The mood, the motion, the emotions, every part of it gets you in.
I:14626;238;good graphics a must see movie will keep you on the edge and great story line !
I:14626;239;This was such a welcomed surprise!
I:14626;240;The story was incredible, special effects were perfect, and must I mention Gerard Butler's stunning physique?
I:14626;241;Bought this for my mom for a Christmas gift and she is more than happy!
I:14626;242;well worth the money and i would watch it again in a heartbeat.
I:14626;243;Everyone should see this movie at one point
I:14626;244;I love the special effects of the film.
I:14626;245;300 will keep you entertained through the movie with action all the way through.
I:14626;246;This is a really good flick.
I:14626;247;The PIP extra feature is also very cool.
I:14626;248;The movie was pretty cool.
I:14626;249;This movie is a gripping masterpiece not only because of its action but also because of the way in which if is filmed.
I:14626;250;Gerard Butler plays this role perfectly.
I:14626;251;The film turned it into a bloodfest of epic proportions .
I:14626;252;but it was also a triumph of a small group who held a pass long enough for the main army to get settled and eventually kick some Persian butt.
I:14626;253;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:14626;254;I watched this movie before but I wanted to check out the features so I watched it with the directors cut and It really gives you an insight on how its done!
I:14626;255;Who cares about how realistic a movie should be, this film is all about how legends were told to inspire others to stand fast and hold to what they believe in.
I:14626;256;If you want a movie about realism, then this isn't for you, but if you, like me, enjoy allowing ourselves to dream, then this is a must see.
I:14626;257;The effects, music and atmosphere captures the legend that was spawned for this act.
I:14626;258;One of the best movies that I have seen.

I:14626;267;With that out of the way I was able to watch and enjoy Zack Snyder's film adaptation on its own terms without the criticism of historical accuracies looming dangerously over my head.
I:14626;268;300 deserves the label of being the first event film of 2007.
I:14626;269;frank Miller's 300 was at its time an interesting depiction of one of history's greatest military last stands.
I:14626;270;Zack Snyder took this graphic novel and painstakingly stayed true to the visuals Miller and his colorist wife, Lynn Varley put on paper.
I:14626;271;Snyder and his crew of art directors, cinematographers and CGI.
I:14626;272;artists were successful in translating almost every page of the graphic novel onto the screen.
I:14626;273;Like Robert Rodriguez's adaptation of Miller's Sin City, Zack Snyder's 300 pretty much brings the graphic novel to moving life.
I:14626;274;the story is quite simple and just takes the basic summary of the historical event itself.
I:14626;275;culture of never surrendering and seeing death in battle the greatest glory for a Spartan to achieve.
I:14626;276;Indeed, this film and its original source material would've worked even better without the extra filler Snyder and his writers added to give the film more depth.
I:14626;277;One thing I have to say about Zack Snyder as a director (his remake of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead better than what detractors have made it out to be) is that he knows how to film action and with special mention to bloody and gory action.
I:14626;278;The speed up and slow down of the sequences also gives the fight scenes a certain rhythm that once an audience picks up on will follow it through to the end.
I:14626;279;Gerard Butler does a great and convincing job as the Spartan King and his conviction in confronting Xerxes and his army with so few seem very believable.
I:14626;280;Lena Hedley is radiant as his partner and Queen.
I:14626;281;Really, the performances are just done good enough to keep the acting from becoming too campy or too serious.
I:14626;282;It's an action film and with enough action going on in the movie I could forgive the writers (both Miller and the screenwriters) from scrimping on character build up.
I:14626;283;all in all, Zack Snyder's film adaptation of Frank Miller's 300 succeeds in bringing the book to moving life.
I:14626;284;emphasizing certain colors to set a certain mood.
I:14626;285;This is what 300 will be best remembered for.
I:14626;286;It's technical use of CGI to paint the environment in unrealistic but beautiful ways which gives the scenes a 3.
I:14626;287;The film really is a painting come to life and it shows once again how computer technology has now afforded directors in making what used to be impossible logistically to something that could be done with the limit being the artist's imagination.
I:14626;288;It will entertain and pull its audience into a living and modern retelling of a legend.
I:14626;289;For those who are not quick to fall to the hype given the film I still recommend it for the epic spectacle Snyder and his band of filmmakers have put on the screen.
I:14626;290;The movie was action packed and emotion filled.
I:14626;291;Amazing movie in every way.
I:14626;292;Gerard Butler is a fabulous Leonidas.
I:14626;293;I thought this movie was pretty weak in regards to actual plot, but the cinemetography is absolutely amazing!
I:14626;294;It is beautifully filmed, and is action.
I:14626;295;packed from beginning to end.
I:14626;296;300 (Full Screen Edition)Hmmmm What can I say about this movie without having to write a whole page about it.
I:14626;297;This movie is packed with tons of actions.
I:14626;298;It also has a great story behind and it's true too.
I:14626;299;the music is great and so are all the actor's.
I:14626;300;My Queen , My Wife , My Love,.
I:14626;301;Awesome fight scenes and amazing sound!
I:14626;302;This movie is a must watch movie of the year.
I:14626;303;Great for any addition of epic battle movies.
I:14626;304;Wife and I enjoyed this very much.
I:14626;305;Good story line, good acting, good action scenes, good soundtrack.
I:14626;306;What can I say, this is my favorite movie.
I:14626;307;Gerard is superb and the scenery just gets better from there.
I:14626;308;finally history that appeals to women and can be viewed as often as I like.
I:14626;309;By far Gerard Butler's best movie, it is well known this is also a fictitious graphic.
I:14626;310;comic adaptation so there is a whole lot of Hollywood license being taken, but i think it is still one of the best Epics of all time and one of the best movies I've seen since Gladiator.
I:14626;311;great price, very happy with it, just as described.
I:14626;312;Thanks again, im very pleased, thanks
I:14626;313;worshipping comic geeks and drooling drama queens into one satisfied audience, and for that, this film is a landmark.
I:14626;314;headed enough to be a warrior.
I:14626;315;It's not clever, or even well.
I:14626;316;written, but it has you cheering right with the Spartans as they rip the Persians to shreds.
I:14626;317;The video is excellent and is identical for both High definition formats.
I:14626;318;I have both High definition versions and both are great.
I:14626;319;Blood, guts and amazing bodies.
I:14626;320;I really enjoyed the special effects.
I:14626;321;Grab you popcorn and a friend and watch.
I:14626;322;I thought this was a great movie.
I:14626;323;ray edition to under $15.00 I bought it.
I:14626;324;Well done and the action and acting is superb.
I:14626;325;Remember this is an actual event that kept the cultural axis firmly in the west rather than the east.
I:14626;326;That what you fight for is more important than the fight itself.
I:14626;327;i saw many frames in this movie (and shots) based around the comic book which i enjoyed, as will most other frank miller fans.
I:14626;328;just about the first 5.10 mins is the only well descriptive, well thought out and properly portrayed part of the movie.
I:14626;329;i still really liked the movie and will order it for future viewing, I cant help though and struggle to see what is so epic about this movie with other people.
I:14626;330;Its possibly a great film.
I:14626;331;I really enjoy the battle scenes and the queen is an awesome character.
I:14626;332;Definitely happy I bought it.
I:14626;333;A must for fans of this film.
I:14626;334;I am an avid Molon Labe follower and I love this movie.You really can't beat the story line it is truly epic
I:14626;335;Political Correctness strikes yet another symbol of virtue and strength.
I:14626;336;This is a Hollywierd romance.
I:14626;337;Great graphics as is expected of american films today.
I:14626;338;I don't know if this is Amazon or the production company, but the music is SO loud and the speaking is extremely quiet.
I:14626;339;This movie just kicks @ss.
I:14626;340;Each line Butler gives is better than the last, the action is brilliant, there is honor, bravery, loss, courage, revenge, betrayal.
I:14626;341;But wow, what a ride this movie is.
I:14626;342;i dont think you can talk enough about how perfect this movie is, the right amount of story telling and action!
I:14626;343;instant classic for a reason!
I:14626;344;300 told a nice story and was really a great movie overall.
I:14626;345;This is a pretty cool movie.
I:14626;346;Definitely fun (if not repetitive) to watch.
I:14626;347;I finally got around to seeing 300 after hearing about the film earlier in the year.
I:14626;348;The way 300 was described by reviewers made it sound like a cross between a historical adaptation and a video game.
I:14626;349;The first thing I noticed, as did so many others, is that these frames are a visual feast.
I:14626;350;The battle scenes were absolutely outstanding.
I:14626;351;Gerard Butler makes for an excellent King Leonidas and David Wenham cast as Dilios was another magnificent decision and one which will hearten fans of The Lord of the Rings because his work as Faromir was near.
I:14626;352;His role here becomes larger and more brilliant as this film rolls forth.
I:14626;353;All of us will soon be dust but to retain our honor, virtue, and liberty in the process.
I:14626;354;well, those are the acts of an immortal.
I:14626;355;"My contemporaries will do well to remember Leonidas and hope that one day someone may say of them that it was ""an honor to have lived at your side."""
I:14626;356;to me it lacked a decent plot, nice scenery shoots and good acting these guys were like statutes.
I:14626;357;300 is a awesome movie.
I:14626;358;the special effects on this movie is awesome.
I:14626;359;everything about the movie is awesome.
I:14626;360;The movie is great and I recieved the product on time and in shape, but like I said.
I:14626;361;While the history is cut and dried, the Graphics are beautiful.
I:14626;362;This is a montage of battle in the fashion of the Matrix.
I:14626;363;A new age has come, an age of freedom.
I:14626;364;And all will know that 300 Spartans gave their last breath to defend it.This is easily the best film of 2007 thus far, and quite possibly the best in the last twelve months.
I:14626;365;Even for those who dislike violence, this is a heroic and outstanding movie which must be seen.
I:14626;366;The lighting and colors give this historic tale a dark aura, which brilliantly coincides with the story.300 is ferocious, amazing, and influential .
I:14626;367;going friends with moving cars out of the wild snow, just like the Spartans helped each other on the battle field.
I:14626;368;300 is like that cute blonde girl who works at Abercombie and Fitch.
I:14626;369;She may be interesting on a purely physical level, but nothing else about her is all that interesting.
I:14626;370;The Dark Knight Returns, Ronin, his Daredevil work, and Sin City are all classics of the genre.
I:14626;371;what are important is the action sequences, which are simply gorgeous in a blood splattering, slow motion sort of way.
I:14626;372;i enjoyed 300 on a purely visceral and violent level, but I have to comment on the lack of any real back story or strong acting.
I:14626;373;Plus there are some profoundly homoerotic themes.
I:14626;374;This movie ranks along side Kill Bill Vol.
I:14626;375;I would recommend this movie for a good time and a visual treat.
I:14626;376;Try to see it on IMAX if you can, because all of the gory action and violence is larger than life on an IMAX screen.
I:14626;377;This is a great movie.
I:14626;378;Love the action scenes and there are some great one.
I:14626;379;At that time, the Spartan soldiers were considered the best in the world, comparable to today's top Special Forces soldiers.
I:14626;380;This movie does an excellent job of portraying the superiority of the Spartan soldiers.
I:14626;381;After leaving the theater I felt an immediate need to go to the gym.
I:14626;382;The battle scenes are some of the best you will ever see for this era.
I:14626;383;I really loved the very stylish cinematography.
I:14626;384;It's dark and drab, but perfectly fits with the story.
I:14626;385;The music was great and also fits the movie like a glove.
I:14626;386;They guy makes a perfect Spartan.
I:14626;387;All in all, this was one of the best movies of the year.
I:14626;388;Fantastic telling of Frank Miller's graphic novel.
I:14626;389;If you've read the novel then you'll see many scenes directly lifted from it.
I:14626;390;CGI is all over this movie well done and brings all the characters to a larger then life scale.
I:14626;391;The blue Ray look amazing.
I:14626;392;I definitely need to go to the gym after seeing this.
I:14626;393;Stirring epic which brings to gut.
I:14626;394;level view the heroic resistanceof 300 Spartans against the Persian hordes, led by colorful Xerxeshimself.
I:14626;395;"The comraderie, discipline, fighting skills, etc. exhibitedare truly wonderful
I:14626;396;the special effects too are extraordinary and must be seen tobe believed.
I:14626;397;Used the amazon instant video app on my samsung smart tv and am very happy at the overall movie experience
I:14626;398;dont be mind washed by this movie so Americans are more willing to go to war with iran.
I:14626;399;I watch 300 each time with wonder and awe as King Leonidas and the 300 battle the Persians in this awesome movie.
I:14626;400;The non stop action with a purpose, and excellent acting made for a great movie that you could not turn from for a minute.
I:14626;401;The special effects were top notch.
I:14626;402;A bribery that will enslave,doom and free warriors and a nation.
I:14626;403;I have to say, I completely understand why.
I:14626;404;It was an entertaining story with good flow and the characters fit perfect.
I:14626;405;I made his week ordering it!
I:14626;406;Perhaps the story wasn't as good as say Gladiator, but I just loved the dialogue in this movie.
I:14626;407;Our arrows will block out the sun!
I:14626;408;Oh my goodness, it was just an awesome movie!
I:14626;409;Once again Frank Millers graphic novels are brought to the big screen and once again the product was very enjoyable.
I:14626;410;The production values of the film are top notch, the direction solid and the visuals a feast for your eyes.
I:14626;411;"Also the use of slow motion to almost freeze frame during the massive (and frequent) fight scenes, helped to get that ""comic"" feeling."
I:14626;412;the cast also performs well.
I:14626;413;He has the same accent, the same funny way with s's, the same understated comedic delivery of insults to his opponents and he displays a great physique.
I:14626;414;historically inaccurate as it may be, it is still a very entertaining film.
I:14626;415;And then again, who takes their history lessons from the cinema?The storyline is simple and dosen't wander, yet it is still very compelling and it grips you very effectively.
I:14626;416;Throwing in this great movie just about made everything perfect.
I:14626;417;One of the best movies ever made.
I:14626;418;It's right up there with Gladiator and Braveheart.
I:14626;419;The content of the film itself is precisely what it aims to be and it is beautifully rendered in Blu.
I:14626;420;tuning my LNT4671f I was able to mute the effect substantially from the out.
I:14626;421;ray movie (I have several).
I:14626;422;This movie is a classic tale of self sacrifice for the greater good, of being a part of something more than yourself and laying it all out on the line.
I:14626;423;Honor, duty and heroism are celebrated virtues in this movie.
I:14626;424;without looking into the plot or themes too deeply, this is just an all around excellent film that is a blast to watch.
I:14626;425;If it is entertainment you want, this is your film.
I:14626;426;I couldn't be happier with this news, this is a bright young director and though I would like to see him continue to put out more original work, if Superman can bring the same mainstream success to him which Batman brought to the brilliant Christopher Nolan, I am all for it.
I:14626;427;ray collector frankmiller brings his visual style back and is very entertaining!
I:14626;428;The lore and story behind the battle of Thermopolae is already amazing enough.
I:14626;429;But the movie makers really capture and accentuate everything visually.
I:14626;430;ray, this movie is really a treat for the eyesYou first have to realize this movie is being told to the viewer by one of the 300 soldiers.
I:14626;431;It's his take on a historic event.
I:14626;432;the audio commentary is great, the extras are great, and the movie itself is wonderful.
I:14626;433;hallucinatory 2007 film '300' is a visual treat not soon to be forgotten, it's like experiencing history through the eyes of Salvador Dali.
I:14626;434;To make the viewing experience even more impressive is the inclusion of a highly intelligent script with dialogue that resonates with the audiences intellect and emotions.
I:14626;435;As the brave 300 battle against insurmountable odds a profound Spartan philosophy of war is lived out before your eyes and one comes to understand and embrace what they are doing and the reason behind their willingness to die for the greater good.'
I:14626;436;It's an absolutely astonishing cinematic achievement!
I:14626;437;The first time I watched this movie, I actually watched it two times in a row.
I:14626;438;The effects in it make it like a live action comic book.
I:14626;439;The fight sequences are fun and the dudes are all diesel.
I:14626;440;it kept me glued to my seat until the end,lots of action and a little humor at times but a great story and presented very well.
I:14626;441;It's big, it's loud, it's a movie opera if you will.
I:14626;442;It's a visually stunning masterpiece in the same vein as Sin City (another Frank Miller adaptation).
I:14626;443;The narrative story line, special effects, and soundtrack make 300 an experience in which your mouth will fall open in awe.
I:14626;444;, but it is much better than a majority of the big summer blockbusters.
I:14626;445;flying scenes are vividly crisp.
I:14626;446;my favourite feature is the bluescreen picture.
I:14626;447;When you see the amount of work that went into the movie, you'll definitely gain respect for its makers.
I:14626;448;acquaint myself with the movie as well as show my girlfriend.
I:14626;449;This is a movie that mainly men would appreciate so I would not recommend it to most women but it had a lot of action and fight scenes that were very entertaining to say the least.
I:14626;450;"It has a nice political plot and I enjoyed that the woman are not ""second class"" to men."
I:14626;451;It's has a nice political plot and it isn't lame.
I:14626;452;It goes well with the story.
I:14626;453;"The ""blood"" is amazing and how they cut the body parts up and all."
I:14626;454;in the end, it's a great movie that you just have to watch in the future.
I:14626;455;it's got all the battles for the guys and plenty of eye candy with a love story for the girls.
I:14626;456;Great story, great acting, great effects.
I:14626;457;Super gory move but great story, loved this movie and Gerard Butler.
I:14626;458;Great action and battle scenes, and amazing to watch.
I:14626;459;Visually great to see with great use of CGI and special effects.
I:14626;460;If you love action movies, you'll love this one.
I:14626;461;300 was everything and more.
I:14626;462;Great action with fantastic actors.
I:14626;463;I like it a lot.
I:14626;464;"It is very entertaining in a ""fast food"" kind of way."
I:14626;465;"A movie all about an unrealistic battle, but plenty of adrenaline and slaughtering
I:14626;466;I love history especially ancient history and this was one of the best ways to illustrate an era of history which is so distant that most don't care for it.
I:14626;467;So despite this being based on a graphic novel(they are hit and miss, mostly miss)it was well done and even though you know what happens in the end, it still captures your attention while getting thereThis brought one thought to mind: An Ancient Greek Braveheart!
I:14626;468;The graphic violence and sexual content are much more than necessary to tell what is already a great story (many good movies are made without resort to this type of cheapness).
I:14626;469;"The ""Hollywood"" writhing of the beautiful actress was too much considering the atmosphere."
I:14626;470;This is very much a guy flick, but is worth a watch for almost anyone.
I:14626;471;Enjoy it every time we watch it.
I:14626;472;Lots of action,a few memorable quotes.
I:14626;473;A great action film .
I:14626;474;I liked the scene in particular where they battle the man giant.
I:14626;475;Really liked the movie, but this Blu.
I:14626;476;This is an absolutely amazing pack.
I:14626;477;The video is brilliant and to have it in a pack with the collectible helmet is just a dream.
I:14626;478;The CG is awesome like comic book pages coming alive.
I:14626;479;To an extent war and violence is beautiful, depending on how it is portrayed and 300 is one of them films that portrays war in its greatest beauty.
I:14626;480;The defending of a kings family and home against an army who he is unconcerned of its size is simply beautiful as it tells of the human nature of self sacrifice to save those we love.
I:14626;481;This is certainly CGI friendly with pretty much 80% of the whole film setting being in CGI.
I:14626;482;the acting is dramatic, the action is intense and Gerard Butler makes a spectacular King and is a great leading man.
I:14626;483;He seems to express a passion and charisma that you don't regularly notice in a role like this.
I:14626;484;This is an exceptional visual comic book like fantasy movie, but not factual.
I:14626;485;"This is visually and FX wise a treat, but it doesn't have the depth, truth, or feeling that ""The 300 Spartans"" has."
I:14626;486;"I love ""Heavy Metal"" and FX as much as the next person."
I:14626;487;"Both have there special merits, but for owning, I think ""The 300 Spartans"" is better."
I:14626;488;The music needed improvement as well.
I:14626;489;Does it have some good acting and great effects?
I:14626;490;It is good, just not that good.
I:14626;491;The battle scenes are as groundbreaking as The Matrix and as breathtaking as The Lord of the Rings.
I:14626;492;I was wowed by the shots of all three hundred Spartans fighting in force to push back the hordes of Persians attacking them and if that had be how all the fighting sequences were it would be an equal to any recent action movie, but the really amazing part of this movie was the super slo.
I:14626;493;as good as the action in this movie was I could not whole heatedly give this movie five stars.
I:14626;494;Again I will stress how incredible the fighting in this movie is.
I:14626;495;I honestly LOVED this movie and would recommend it to any action movie lover.
I:14626;496;"the Scot has made a deep resume since the 1999,biopic ""Attila"",and this film earned it's iconic status."
I:14626;497;"This is a fun popcorn movie
I:14626;498;And in this case that is enough.
I:14626;499;As a huge fan of Gerard Butler,I see all of his movies.
I:14626;500;i was lucky to view it first on an IMAX screen.
I:14626;501;it is so beautifully filmed.
I:14626;502;i love the way the battle scenes were slowed down and sped up.
I:14626;503;gerard gave an outstanding performance.
I:14626;504;lena Headey was so good,actually all performances were great.
I:14626;505;also,the musical score fit the movie perfectly.
I:14626;506;While war and violence are morally wrong in the abstract human philosophies, shifting cultural sensibilities, and our (USA) pampered day to day existence, It is still part of who we are and it seeps out through our art into our society.
I:14626;507;Our art, video games, TV, media, and films serve it up.
I:14626;508;important, and egotistic views represented by the people I know within the word I live.
I:14626;509;This film was great, pure and simple.
I:14626;510;It is the sublime beauty of war that Joseph Campbell mentions in his works.
I:14626;511;Frank Miller has been an artist I have admired since I was a young boy.
I:14626;512;Real artists do not push political dogma, they represent what is in their soul and hearts.
I:14626;513;as grand and spectacular as 300 is, it's still just entertainment for popular culture.
I:14626;514;a critique for the critics by a true film goer and viewer.
I:14626;515;"This movie dont promotes ""freedom fighters"" or some kind of race against race battle or ."
I:14626;516;please, be my guest and read a History book.
I:14626;517;It's gorgeous to look at and the action sucks you into the movie.
I:14626;518;ray format for this movie and in general.
I:14626;519;It is easy to navigate and you find what are you looking for.
I:14626;520;the better, I do feel obligated to say a few things about 300's self.
I:14626;521;He is a great actor.
I:14626;522;He can do any part in any movie he puts out.
I:14626;523;And he does it perfect.
I:14626;524;Because Mr Butler gives his best in any movie I seen him in.
I:14626;525;I actually bought two as I have two stepdaughters.
I:14626;526;I don't know where this movie came from all of the sudden, but it is surprisingly good.
I:14626;527;The action is fantastic and the special effects as well.
I:14626;528;The story sounds like a great fantasy epics that was made up by somebody just to make a movie out of it.
I:14626;529;I had read the graphic novel, and it was amusing I suppose, Not a big fan of Miller or the movies based on his works.300 really made my evening, seriously, I havent laughed that hard at a movie in years, well laughed that hard at a movie that isnt supposed to be funny.
I:14626;530;I love Gerard, but he doesnt make the best choices when it comes to roles.
I:14626;531;They watch the commercials with their eyes wide open and literally believe everything they hear coming at them.
I:14626;532;Okay, so all I can say is that the storyline is great, and the dialogue is okay.
I:14626;533;They mix some legend and myth together and throw in the details that are widely known.
I:14626;534;That being said, the film is entertainment particularly targeted to adolescent males and young men.
I:14626;535;Thus the film will have an archetypal appeal to young males who sense the ever creeping social constraints upon individual action and who wish to strike back with heroic action.
I:14626;536;the film is a visual treat even if there is much violence and bloodletting.
I:14626;537;top, almost operatic in its use of grand gesture.
I:14626;538;act in a film that is attempting to push limits and provide an operatic grand statement.
I:14626;539;gerard Butler is excellent as Leonidas.
I:14626;540;He is the finest visual example of the archetype of the Greek King from Greek Mythology that I have ever seen on film.
I:14626;541;He is supported by beautiful Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo.
I:14626;542;These two lead actors are surrounded by a cast of virile men, revealing much of their beautiful bodies.
I:14626;543;teller Dilios does a fine job (you will recognize him as the tragic Prince Faramir in the Lord of the Rings films).
I:14626;544;He is an excellent actor (see him in the Horatio Hornblower series as a mentally disturbed sailor).
I:14626;545;top as the homoerotic giant King Xerxes.
I:14626;546;He appears almost nude in every scene, conveying a sense of both masculine and feminine power.
I:14626;547;It is visually striking entertainment.
I:14626;548;It is testosterone driven so as to appeal in particular to young men.
I:14626;549;However woven into the matrix of the film is a dream.
I:14626;550;Long before this film came out, there was Frank Miller's superb graphic novel (still in print, by the way, and well worth the read), and I was a great fan of it.
I:14626;551;Miller's graphic adaptation was an artistic and narrative triumph, creating a great deal of care for the characters and setting the work in a golden, rocky version of the Greek countryside.
I:14626;552;Much of Miller's artistry is reproduced here .
I:14626;553;costumes, colors, even individual panel illustrations are featured with loving care and dazzle the eye.
I:14626;554;Additionally, the fight scenes are brilliant and rival any previously filmed.
I:14626;555;I bought this item as a gift.
I:14626;556;Director Zack Snyder (The Watchmen) and Graphic Novelist Frank Miller (Sin City), have, however, done a great job of bringing the ancient legend to the silver screen.
I:14626;557;king Leonidas: Yes, my lady.
I:14626;558;He must conquer his fear so that he can fight with a clear head.
I:14626;559;said sweet ThermopylaeI give my dying Kiss .
I:14626;560;"what a message""The Bottomline is that 300 can be enjoyed strictly as an action film, with lots of thrilling battle scenes to get the blood pumping, but it is also a very vivid and graphic telling of an ancient tale that is referred to often by poets, such as Lord Byron, T. s. Elliot, Sylvia Plath, A. e. Houseman, and Emily Dickinson."
I:14626;561;It is a very inspiring story, and centuries later, King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans at Thermopylae are still remembered.
I:14626;562;Consider the beautiful land you so vigorously defend.
I:14626;563;and I enjoyed every single moment of it.
I:14626;564;I give it 6 stars!!
I:14626;565;But I do always love to go with my husband and friends to see great action and drama.
I:14626;566;The graphics and special effects were amazing.
I:14626;567;The second time, I loved it even more.
I:14626;568;law is a huge comic and graphic novel expert and absolutely loved it (also liked it more the second time around).
I:14626;569;My b. i. l says that the movie is a great rendition of the graphic novel, keeping true to much of the original feeling that the novel conveys.
I:14626;570;I would highly recommend this film to anyone .
I:14626;571;If you can get through Kill Bill and see it for its artistic beauty, then you can certainly do the same for this movie.
I:14626;572;It is a beautiful film!
I:14626;573;for me though the cinematography was good.
I:14626;574;It is a geniusly orchestrated and well directed movie, full of action, romance and aesthetic beauty.
I:14626;575;but I will tell you I bought the Blu.
I:14626;576;ray expecting it to be an even more breathtaking experience but was HORRIFIED from the result.
I:14626;577;Crystal clear and absolutely breathtakingly crisp picture.
I:14626;578;A movie as good as 300 deserves better than that.
I:14626;579;Hi, I am delighted with the product and all its contents especially with the movie, the book of photos and images is a beautiful presentation.
I:14626;580;Many times, the scenery look so obviously created by computer graphics that it clearly shows the low budget of this film.
I:14626;581;Great movie and this package contains lots of information surrounding the story of Sparta.
I:14626;582;The movie looks great on Blu.
I:14626;583;"the film adaptation of Frank Miller's ""300"" is a compelling and graphic rendition of the battle of Thermopylae Pass."
I:14626;584;A clear reminder of how skill, tactics, and the concept of fighting for freedom are more powerful than even the largest and mightiest foes.
I:14626;585;age combat, but also a visual feast of action and adventure.
I:14626;586;Admittedly this is a very surprising move to make and it was exceptionally well pulled off.
I:14626;587;This could very well be a herald of what we can expect in not too distant future films.
I:14626;588;This film demonstrates the power that a great plot can put to any film.
I:14626;589;An epic tale of life, death, honor, glory, and most importantly.
I:14626;590;One of the greatest movies ever!
I:14626;591;Everyone in the entire family enjoyed it.
I:14626;592;This copy is a gift for friend.
I:14626;593;A must watch for anyone that likes the gladiator style movies.
I:14626;594;If you enjoy good storylines you will like this movie also.
I:14626;595;One of the most visually impressive films I have ever seen, 300 is based on a comic book's interpretation of the battle between the Spartans and the Persians in 480 B. c. the life of a Spartan is that of a soldier.
I:14626;596;That is the story of King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), who has ruled over Sparta with tremendous strength and courage.
I:14626;597;But forces are stirring beyond their borders and a messenger comes to inform him that the King of Persia, Xerxes, intends to claim these lands as part of his ever.
I:14626;598;driven movie and may as such appeal to primarily men, I found much to enjoy about it.
I:14626;599;the acting is quite good and so is the hair styling and the make.
I:14626;600;The music is slightly familiar but wonderfully dramatic and it's easy to like the warriors.
I:14626;601;there's a fair amount of nudity, sexuality, and gore.
I:14626;602;The religious symbolism is striking, particularly in the parallels between Xerxes and Satan.
I:14626;603;It's not a happy story by any means but it is inspirational in the sense that it is all about courage.
I:14626;604;"The amount of behind the scene footage was just great
I:14626;605;I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.
I:14626;606;Visually stunning, like a graphic novel, with strong character development and epic battle scenes.
I:14626;607;I confess that the first time I played the Blu.
I:14626;608;Awesome from start to finish.
I:14626;609;I use my own judgment and watch the movies myself.
I:14626;610;ray, the film is very grainy.
I:14626;611;It is not at all the type of film I normally flock to or enjoy, but I was more than pleasantly surprised at how much I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
I:14626;612;this is probably one of the most visually appealing movies I have seen in a long time.
I:14626;613;"The acting was excellent
I:14626;614;He was a physically imposing warrior, leading his men to battle, yet there were surprisingly tender and human moments as well.
I:14626;615;Lena Headey managed to portray Queen Gorgo as a strong, powerful woman, while maintaining extreme femininity.
I:14626;616;A powerful man, who referred to himself as God, was made complete by his large size and deep voice.
I:14626;617;There were even a handful of touching moments that made me weepy, another unexpected.
I:14626;618;The music was another unforeseen enjoyment.
I:14626;619;It flowed seamlessly from hauntingly beautiful chant like choruses to powerfully driven techno beats.
I:14626;620;I liked the music so much, that I remained after the movie to watch the credits and find out who did the soundtrack.
I:14626;621;is this movie historically accurate?
I:14626;622;I went to see a movie based on a comic book, loosely based on history and that's what I saw.
I:14626;623;He has watched it at least 3 times a week since we got it.
I:14626;624;And the price was well worth it.
I:14626;625;I feel this feature is bound to be one of the best, of it's era story line.
I:14626;626;Gerard Butler and cast made this feature the success it is.
I:14626;627;I recommend this movie to all adults.
I:14626;628;It's a must see, again and again.
I:14626;629;Keep these great features coming.
I:14626;630;Love this movie and wanted to see it again before watching the sequel.
I:14626;631;"If you like ""gangsta"", this is the one."
I:14626;632;So many people reviewed this movie well before it came out, I thought I'd review it AFTER I actually watched the blue.
I:14626;633;Lots of action sequences .
I:14626;634;actually the entire movie is like one large action sequence.
I:14626;635;The battle scenes are filmed in a realistic manner.
I:14626;636;the same type of lofty ideals of freedom, liberty, inundate the movie.
I:14626;637;Lots of grandiose speeches that can tug at the most unpatriotic heart.
I:14626;638;And of course the fight sequences were amazing.
I:14626;639;The makers of this movie certainly set a high bar for anyone else who is thinking about producing a movie of this caliber.
I:14626;640;in my opinion, the beauty of the movie lies in the detail and the cinematography.
I:14626;641;On a purely ascetic level, this movie is brilliant.
I:14626;642;ray movie I've watched on my PS3 so take my review for what its worth.
I:14626;643;but I thought it was great.
I:14626;644;I mean the detail was superb.
I:14626;645;ray is well worth it.
I:14626;646;All and all I am very satisfied with my first blue.
I:14626;647;ray and this movie looked great to me.
I:14626;648;"I enjoyed watching the TV snow on my 25 year old 20"" tube TV then watching 300 Blu."
I:14626;649;Being a Marine, we very closely identify with this film as we are considered modern day Spartans.
I:14626;650;But for a true motivating kick, and understanding what true loyalty means as a brother.
I:14626;651;arms, this film hits the spot.
I:14626;652;I defintely recommend this film who love action,adventure,history and just the best fight scenes ever!!
I:14626;653;the whole cast did an awesome job!!
I:14626;654;the one to watch is Gerard Butler!
I:14626;655;Amazing visuals in this film, with intense battle action based on actual historic events.
I:14626;656;driven fantasy in which all men are fearless warriors, driven by the need for battle and bloodshed.
I:14626;657;type could hope for, with every soldier being the epitome of strength, courage, and physical brute force.
I:14626;658;"Emotional bonding, sensitivity, and compassion don't even come into play
I:14626;659;"But straightforward and mainstream, ""300"" is not
I:14626;660;driving escapism, from the frenetic battle sequences to the elaborate special effects to the over the top performances.
I:14626;661;In this sense, it's absolutely brilliant.
I:14626;662;"also utilized for another incredible Miller adaptation, 2005's ""Sin City""."
I:14626;663;"The work paid off
I:14626;664;It's the perfect look for war story of this caliber, something so grandiose and overplayed that you can't get enough.
I:14626;665;They are taught the fine art of combat.
I:14626;666;"This is probably because each sequence was beautifully photographed
I:14626;667;They were appropriately crafted as one.
I:14626;668;"But in this case, it works quite well
I:14626;669;Quite the opposite: despite being simplistic, the story is quite strong, especially when a couple of subplots are factored in.
I:14626;670;edged masculinity that shines through despite a deceptively soft voice.
I:14626;671;"Yet he always gives a perfect delivery, and that only strengthens the appeal of ""300."""
I:14626;672;This is in a world all its own, a world dominated by battle cries, sword fights, and bare.
I:14626;673;It's all thanks to Frank Miller, whose creative vision has allowed for a truly unique theatrical experience.
I:14626;674;A little grainy, but it still looks great.
I:14626;675;Pederastic (they loved their boys, and often, depsite the movie which has them dissing on Athens for that particularity).
I:14626;676;in that is succeeds wildly.
I:14626;677;The acting is pretty damn fine (as are a few of the Spartans).
I:14626;678;this is a film about war, about violence and in many ways about beauty.
I:14626;679;Don't even try to think of it as anything else, and you'll enjoy it just fine.
I:14626;680;A must have for collectors of great action movies.
I:14626;681;written story with excellent cast and music.
I:14626;682;300 is a Fantastic Action Movie, courage and honor!
I:14626;683;Congratulations to Frank Miller with this action packed 'ancient Greek' movie!!
I:14626;684;i like seeing where movies and the actors in them go.
I:14626;685;the cast is really good.
I:14626;686;She has always taken on interesting projects.)
I:14626;687;The choreography and blocking are dramatic.
I:14626;688;"for a good history closer to the truth, check out the BBC documentary, ""The Spartans"", narrated and written by Bettany Hughes."
I:14626;689;As a very contrived story very loosely following the truth, I liked this movie because it is a little interesting.
I:14626;690;This was the GREATEST movie I have ever seen!
I:14626;691;It's filled with action and inspiration and it actually pretty accurate to actual history.
I:14626;692;And I was wrong, they did a great job, it is Hollywooded up, but it's awesome!!
I:14626;693;But the point is to entertain, and yet even as Frank Miller twists it as he does, he still does an amazing job depicting it already.
I:14626;694;Its an amazing movie, and still depicts the truth.
I:14626;695;A queen gives an address to a council that is all melodrama .
I:14626;696;As I said, this is a fantasy on historical themes, and the additions are often interesting.
I:14626;697;this is a fun movie to watch.
I:14626;698;Frank Miller himself admits that he likes to be inaccurate if he can.
I:14626;699;The movie is over the top, dramatic, outlandish, and visually stunning.
I:14626;700;It's just like a comic book, which it is based on.
I:14626;701;It's simply fun to watch.
I:14626;702;ray disc is generally good.
I:14626;703;The clearest, most detailed blu.
I:14626;704;ray movie I've ever seen is still Corpse Bride.
I:14626;705;english film I've ever seen.
I:14626;706;the reason for that is because those movies concentrate on the themes of freedom and fighting for what you believe in.
I:14626;707;American movies make fun of Canadians, French, English, Australians, etc., but you don't hear about those countries banning our movies.
I:14626;708;If you want a good action movie, get it.
I:14626;709;Out of all movies out there there isnt one that depicts a King doing his duty , This movie is a dipiction of a Real King
I:14626;710;The moment I received it in the mail I popped it into my not yet one month old blu.
I:14626;711;Okay, I'll start off by saying I actually did enjoy this movie.
I:14626;712;The plotline was decent enough to keep me entertained.
I:14626;713;And please, can we not have anymore medieval matrix.
I:14626;714;so i decided to spend the extra 5 or 6 bucks on it, and get it on blu.
I:14626;715;I am so glad that I did because the special effects are so smooth and blend in more with the movie.
I:14626;716;It is a great movie and is even better on blu.
I:14626;717;FIRST OFF: before you read any of the other reviews, please let's clear up a few facts.1.
I:14626;718;The extreme colors and strong graphic visuals are in many cases very much based on exact pages from the book.2.
I:14626;719;The movie itself was one of the most amazing adaptations of a graphic novel I have seen to date.
I:14626;720;Read the book then watch the movie, the way certain shots are matched are amazing.
I:14626;721;This is a great action film, very good visuals and some superb violence.
I:14626;722;This is a great movie for anyone who has not seen it.
I:14626;723;"Not being familiar with the Frank Miller ""graphic novel"" (which is really a fancy term for ""expensive comic book""), I approached this story with a clean slate and an open mind."
I:14626;724;candy to fuel many masturbatory fantasies for both men and women alike.
I:14626;725;This is one gorgeous movie!However, don't be fooled.
I:14626;726;this is also one heck of an ultra.
I:14626;727;It is, after all, a battle story.
I:14626;728;"type violence
I:14626;729;The action scenes are intense and beautiful.
I:14626;730;motion and one can fully appreciate the quasi.
I:14626;731;"The movie itself is OK
I:14626;732;is clobbering all competitors at the box office, seen varying reviews, and wondered if it was worth it.
I:14626;733;In a word, absolutely!The plot is true, and well.
I:14626;734;The photography, enhanced by computer graphics, is shockingly beautiful.
I:14626;735;The dialogue and acting is terrific.
I:14626;736;"There is an excellent extensive female part, and it would be a mistake to think of this as just a ""guy's' movie""."
I:14626;737;There is even some definite humor.
I:14626;738;You WILL be drawn in and emotionally involved.
I:14626;739;It is a genuine epic with many fight scenes.
I:14626;740;The film editor never uses the same camera angle twice, and the combination of color and shading makes for an absolute beautiful vision.
I:14626;741;But in 300's case, it wants to be entertaining yet have depth and emotion and pathos too.
I:14626;742;Problem is everything kind of lessens it since it's made in a videogame.
I:14626;743;when I first saw this in theatres, I had to admit that I was quite impressed with the look of the visuals.
I:14626;744;Shot on a digital set where the backgrounds are replaced with CG, I thought the film had a great look.
I:14626;745;This is combined with the film's want to be epic and grand on the level of sand.
I:14626;746;as far as the acting, it's kind of appropriate.
I:14626;747;"Characters say lines with words like ""honor"" and ""victory"" a lot, look cool and fight while showing off their muscle.y bodies."
I:14626;748;The one leading this is Gerard Butler and on 2nd viewing I liked him more when before he seemed like an action figure that's skilled in battle and yelled a lot.
I:14626;749;But this film wasn't meant to win awards but at least Butler does an admirable job.
I:14626;750;granted there is some great visuals here including a nice love scene, an oracle dancing to puffs of smoke and the landscapes of Greece but everything else I wasn't a big fan of.
I:14626;751;As far as the movie goes, it is an absolutely awseome action packed film.
I:14626;752;so action films because the battle scenes just come to life off of high def.
I:14626;753;After weeks of waiting till release day, it has finally arrived!
I:14626;754;Picture and sound are extraordinary and is something that every blu.
I:14626;755;Great job on the transfer!
I:14626;756;It had a good price and you could not beat the shipping.
I:14626;757;Thank you very much for the good service.
I:14626;758;ray, because I had been told that it was a really good movie.
I:14626;759;Everything about it was great.
I:14626;760;I like this movie and i got it very fast and the shipping was perfect!
I:14626;761;If you go into watching it with that in mind, it will be much more enjoyable.
I:14626;762;The story itself was wonderful and beautifully done as well.
I:14626;763;"Worrying that it would be ""just another action flick"" but I was so amazed and happy with it afterwards."
I:14626;764;this is one of the most artistically wonderful movies I have seen in a long time.
I:14626;765;It is, indeed, based off off the Battle of Thermopylae, which is marvelous.
I:14626;766;But I loved the fictional elements very much.
I:14626;767;This movie was absolutely beautiful and stylistic.
I:14626;768;i heartily recommend this film to anyone looking for something original and visually amazing.
I:14626;769;Would highly recommend to both men and women
I:14626;770;Once I shut my brain off, this was a great movie to watch.
I:14626;771;This is no gladiator, but worth a look.
I:14626;772;Finally saw it last night after anxiously awaiting its arrival for well over a year and I came away from the film being somewhat impressed by certain features of the film, but by no means is this one of the greatest films ever made since it leaves much to be desired.
I:14626;773;acting wise '300' works, if only slightly above average.
I:14626;774;aesthetically speaking, the movie is a masterpiece.
I:14626;775;Many of the scenes were quite breathtaking and looked incredibly realistic, and I say this because everyone may not know that the entire film was shot in front of a blue/green screen, so all the nature shots and sweeping cinematography of various architecture was all digitally animated or super.
I:14626;776;Many of the monsters, leppers and hunchbacks were digitally enhanced as well, some were completely done by CGI, and it's easy to tell.
I:14626;777;The wolf scene, which was pivotal as foreshadowing, is a prime example of this.
I:14626;778;story wise it was very straightforward.
I:14626;779;The fighting choreography was excellent, no doubt about it.
I:14626;780;throughout the film the score was relevant, helping to accentuate certain moods and themes, and at times it was completely captivating.
I:14626;781;The mix of more modern rock music during battles was appropriate while the more classical compositions better suited the moments of silence or reflection of a scene's message.
I:14626;782;despite all of it being CGI, the cinematography was of high caliber.
I:14626;783;A very grand scale was at the heart of the technique and I must say it is impressive how far the technology has come.
I:14626;784;all elements considered, this film feels more like an epic poem and the execution was poetry in motion, words put to very fluid action and a rapid, almost non.
I:14626;785;For me it's not the kind of film I will see again and again, but it's definitely worth watching at least once.
I:14626;786;the whole movie is set on a green screen.
I:14626;787;All the scenery, other than the few houses, are on the green screen.
I:14626;788;Greeks with their robes and Persians with head wraps and colorful clothing.
I:14626;789;Most of the fight scenes are more of a dance than a battle.
I:14626;790;"It's that type of ""man"" movie."
I:14626;791;"i would really recommend watching ""The True History about 300 the Movie"" by the History Channel."
I:14626;792;a movie I do recommend is Meet the Spartans.
I:14626;793;This movie has some of the best cinematography that I have ever seen in my entire life.
I:14626;794;Other than the few unrealistic additions from Miller's graphic novel, I found this movie to be one of the most enjoyable man's movies in years.
I:14626;795;the computer graphics and the dizzying battle scenes are breathtaking only to be somewhat reigned in by scenes of the politicking led by Queen Gorgo, played by Lena Headey, back home in Sparta.
I:14626;796;The film is an impressive exercise in the use of CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) and was made on a relatively small budget.
I:14626;797;Technically the film is an extraordinary achievement but artistically it's somewhat lacking.
I:14626;798;First of all, there have been phenomenal technological advances in which we have the advantage.
I:14626;799;While the Persians were creating an empire by conquering one nation after another and amassing an enormous army, the threat that we face is significantly smaller in number.
I:14626;800;This is something that is truly frightening.3.
I:14626;801;He is told that he is forbidden to go to war and Leonidas realizes that if Greece is to survive in its present form then he must take the western world's fate into his own hands.
I:14626;802;The Greeks are viewed as being muscular, heroic, Herculean figures of honor and duty, but the Persian army (which consist of Asian, African and Middle.
I:14626;803;There's also a strong homophobic atmosphere (much like the works of Nietzsche).
I:14626;804;If this is what we are to become, what our modern society is born of, if these are the values that we embrace then the future is indeed bleak.Yet with all of these things in mind I can still recommend 300.
I:14626;805;also recommended for those interested in learning about the historical events that inspired this film:The HistoriesRepublicThermopylae: The Battle For The WestThermopylae 480 BC: Last stand of the 300The History Channel Presents Last Stand of the 300 .
I:14626;806;i think this was the best movie of 2007 by far a great action flick and actually a good movie
I:14626;807;If you were a fan of the movie, the special edition is worth getting for the extras.
I:14626;808;There are some interesting documentaries about the making of the movie, the graphic novel, and the history.
I:14626;809;This movie is a lot better than I had heard when it was first playing in the theaters.
I:14626;810;National film critics weren't kind to it, but the public liked it.
I:14626;811;That's usually a good sign and it was in this case.
I:14626;812;It is just stunning to look at from start.
I:14626;813;That's what held my attention.
I:14626;814;This movie simply was fun to ogle, with all it's incredible scenery, outrageous monster.
I:14626;815;i've seen a number of films with a lot more action than in here.
I:14626;816;A few of the elements in this telling do have an historical basis.
I:14626;817;is it a fun movie?
I:14626;818;Think barracks and you will be closer to the truth.
I:14626;819;Still I enjoyed Queen Gogor's treatment of Theron at the council.
I:14626;820;It is quite satisfying and not overdone.
I:14626;821;(Theron is a fiction, by the way.)
I:14626;822;It is a bloody film that is fun to watch if you are in for that sort of thing.
I:14626;823;It has some amazing effects.
I:14626;824;I kind of enjoyed its lack of realism.
I:14626;825;It is amazing that a few thousand Greeks (not just 300) held off the vast army of Xerxes for even three days.
I:14626;826;That is an inspiring story and to the extent that is here, the movie works very well for me.
I:14626;827;If you enjoy blood, sex, and comic books, this movie is for you!
I:14626;828;This is a great movie that is full of awesome graphics and a very interesting storyline.
I:14626;829;Anyone who loves the gladiator era will love this movie.
I:14626;830;I got home from work on Monday and there was my package.
I:14626;831;It's straight out high octane, high level testatrone, adrenaline rock 'em sock 'em manly movie.
I:14626;832;1 my of top 5 favorites.
I:14626;833;ray disc I've bought, and first time seeing this movie.
I:14626;834;If you can get more out of it than that, you must be a genius.
I:14626;835;So he returns to Sparta and gathers up 300 of his best soldiers and heads towards the Hot Gates where he plans on using the mountainous terrain to funnel the Persians into them.
I:14626;836;And when all was said and done Leonidas honored his word and proved that even a God.
I:14626;837;And the cast was very good Gerald Butler, Rodrigo Santoro, and Lena Headey were excellent.
I:14626;838;There are monumental fight scenes and plenty of memorable quotes.
I:14626;839;I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes an action packed movie with great visual effects.
I:14626;840;Exciting, great effects and stunts.
I:14626;841;On a brighter note, first off the special effects are freaking outstanding!
I:14626;842;I mean the main charcter just continues to become a ruthless S. o. b. Finally the story line is pretty dam cool especially considering how it ends.
I:14626;843;Im not gonna spoil it.you have to see this flick and make sure the volume's all the way up!
I:14626;844;What a great experience thank you amazon for being so convenient.
I:14626;845;I am definitely a happy customer :)
I:14626;846;the art direction is phenomenal and the Spartans, led by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), are imposing physical specimens of perfection .
I:14626;847;The scenes of brilliantly choreographed combat are equally memorable, filling the screen with beautiful brutality, and images of desperate courage.
I:14626;848;It looked like the living comic book of a heroic tale when viewed without the story and when viewed in absence of the on.
I:14626;849;Reality, in this case, is more amazing than fiction.
I:14626;850;There is no doubt that King Leonidas undertook one of the most inspired, brilliant, and courageous last stands in the history of warfare.
I:14626;851;peace statement deriding our own present.
I:14626;852;This is about one of the few greatest movie adaptation's of a comic book out there.
I:14626;853;If you put aside the history and look at the fact that this movie was made from a comic book you will understand the story better.
I:14626;854;Best comic book adaptation into a film made.
I:14626;855;I have never seen extras this good before.
I:14626;856;This was a great action packed movie and Gerald Butler is my favorite actor.
I:14626;857;Shows the true bravery of those 300 men.
I:14626;858;This has to be one of my favorite all time movies next to Phantom of the Opera.
I:14626;859;So it was the artistic vision of Frank Miller combined with the director that gave this film it's gritty, grimy look and feel.
I:14626;860;The picture is crisp and the art is as stunning as the movie appeared in theaters.
I:14626;861;In depth interviews with the director, cast, author (Frank Miller) and most importantly, historians.
I:14626;862;It is refreshing to see that the creators of the film clearly state that this work is not meant to be a historical presentation but a mythological one, an explanation that is well.
I:14626;863;If you enjoyed 300 for what it was, a mythological re.
I:14626;864;I love this movie, and with the Blu.
I:14626;865;ray picture and sound technology, its makes the viewing even more special.
I:14626;866;Crystal clear pictures, really adds great depth to all the scenes and with the soundtrack to the movie, with the drums just sound much more alive.
I:14626;867;Really a great experience watching it like this.
I:14626;868;it takes talent to ruin a perfectly good premise, but in this case the film makers managed to.
I:14626;869;If nothing else, this movie is good for a laugh.
I:14626;870;the movie itself was great, the story behind it was really interesting and the battle scenes are amazing.
I:14626;871;300 is a movie that works much like the old He.
I:14626;872;man cartoon used to, appealing to the same demographic and that demographic's secret desire to watch well.
I:14626;873;I saw the new movie before this one but still blown away by how well the movie was done!
I:14626;874;After I bought and read the graphic novel, I sort of enjoyed the movie more.
I:14626;875;"I also couldn't help but yell with one of my friends, ""%&#$ing right doggie!"""
I:14626;876;I like the odds that these soldiers put themselves up against.
I:14626;877;This is one of my top favorite movies of all time because it was put together in the best of ways.
I:14626;878;Visuals looked good, but 300 was shot a certain way with grain.
I:14626;879;still a lot of fun.
I:14626;880;Unbelievable film, this goes right up there with the Rocky movies and so many other inspirational, get pumped.
I:14626;881;This is truly a classic, and if you don't see the message in it or in the least, feel something great from this film, then watch it until you do.
I:14626;882;"This movie is full of heart, courage, and perseverance
I:14626;883;Thank You for your time.
I:14626;884;whoa, the action of the movie.
I:14626;885;after that day I measure how much I enjoyed a film comparing it to 300.
I:14626;886;The movie is action packed with adequate acting and rivers of human blood.
I:14626;887;If your contemplating the movie a again, it'll be just as good as the first time.
I:14626;888;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:14626;889;Apart of the comic book mood, certain scenes remind us of the epic works of the neo.
I:14626;890;The film is an undeniable accomplishment.
I:14626;891;If that's what you're looking, for this is a 1 star movie, move on and save yourself a couple hours.
I:14626;892;The film is absolutely beautiful and seemed to me to capture the graphic novel perfectly.
I:14626;893;It was disappointing but the stunning visuals made this far more worthy of my $10.
I:14626;894;I treated it like an amusement park ride.
I:14626;895;This film had a lot of hype behind the trailer, which was one of the best in recent years.
I:14626;896;The action is beautifully choreographed, albeit gory at times.
I:14626;897;This is an awesome movie starring Gerard Butler.
I:14626;898;It has great video and graphic effects, and Awesome storyline.
I:14626;899;Only a few would enjoy this type of movie.
I:14626;900;I received this item as advertised in EXCELLENT condition and time!
I:14626;901;One of my favorites and would definitely recommend it to all movie lovers.
I:14626;902;Very entertaining good action and easy to follow.
I:14626;903;I would rate to very close to Brave Heart.
I:14626;904;Like so many others, I saw the high definition trailer for this movie and was hooked.
I:14626;905;Must go see the movie!
I:14626;906;so that was it?For despite its enormously powerful graphic design and action.
I:14626;907;the first and foremost is as entertainment.
I:14626;908;In between the enthralling CGI.
I:14626;909;The best parts of the movie are basically already in that high definition trailer.
I:14626;910;was she a proud Queen trying to save her city.
I:14626;911;oK, so we know that Frank Miller has this thing for them, especially together with beautiful semi.
I:14626;912;And so the triumph over the Persians would be followed by the Peloponnesian War, the Corinthian War, etc., etc.
I:14626;913;states in the peace treaty.
I:14626;914;"so with all this talk of ""freedom"" in this movie, the truth is that freedom was for the Spartans only."
I:14626;915;Brave and loyal to each other and their cause, yes, defenders of their slave.
I:14626;916;owning ways of life yes, but defenders of freedom, absolutely not.
I:14626;917;While the director and writers took liberties with history, they did so to give the audience an entertaining popcorn movie with an amazing and visually pleasing look that sets the mood for the entire movie.
I:14626;918;"the story is centered around the Spartan King played by Gerard Butler, probably best known for his role in ""Phantom of the Opera""."
I:14626;919;With a brilliant plan to halt the overwhelming numbers he faces, the king takes his men to a pass that will allow the men to fight the invaders on a more level playing field.
I:14626;920;The Queen knows that she is fighting the clock, and her husband and his men will need help to eventually rebuff the onslaught by the huge Persian army.
I:14626;921;The golden hues of wheat in the fields, the dark gray skies, the coldness of winter are all visually pleasing and the special effects are well done.
I:14626;922;While none of these actors will win accolades for these roles, they nonetheless turn in good performances in the first really entertaining action movie of the year.
I:14626;923;the thing i love about the morons who rate this a one star or hate it because it isnt based on history is hilarious.
I:14626;924;its a fun battle movie, its good interesting characters and gerard butler was excellent.
I:14626;925;stop taking everything so seriously and enjoy a movie for what it is.
I:14626;926;this is a much better movie than sin city (another frank miller creation) and democrats should pay attention to the message of the movie, sometimes doing the right thing isnt popular.
I:14626;927;300 is a very good action movie.
I:14626;928;It kept me on the edge of my seat and I was able to root for the good guys (unlike many of the flicks coming out oif Hollywood).
I:14626;929;pricing was incredibly worth it for the entertainment value I recieved.
I:14626;930;the best jaw dropping, ear splitting, heart beating, movie ever.
I:14626;931;extremely inspiration and epic graphics.
I:14626;932;Great movie give it 4.5 stars.
I:14626;933;This was an excellent movie.
I:14626;934;"I approached ""300"" with a great deal of trepidition."
I:14626;935;To my surprise it works on a video game level.
I:14626;936;A guilty pleasure for sure but I bit.
I:14626;937;Great movie to drink beer with guy pals and put your brain on mute.
I:14626;938;"I really liked the ""300"" film."
I:14626;939;It is a very odd and unique film in terms of being classified as a fantasy, action film that is loosely based on ancient history.
I:14626;940;Putting any historical inaccuracies aside, I think the film was still very enjoyable with all of its visual splendor and over the top mythological villains.
I:14626;941;"I liked the ""washed out"" colors look with some touches of red as contrast colors."
I:14626;942;"I wasn't really much of a big fan of ""Sin City"", but I think the unique look works really well and better in ""300"" instead of ""Sin City""."
I:14626;943;"Images of my box set are in the ""custom images"" description above."
I:14626;944;really a fantasy piece that takes a shit from a high place onto history.
I:14626;945;One of the best movies of the year, both graphics and over.
I:14626;946;You gotta give Snyder and the whole crew credit for the effort put into this.
I:14626;947;Plus the transfer onto Blu.
I:14626;948;Watch the scene where the greeks are captured in the storm and you'll swear you are there on the cliff with Leonidas.
I:14626;949;All i can say is vivid.
I:14626;950;Listening to LCPM it is incredible.
I:14626;951;The musical score sets everything up, sweeping across the room setting the tone.
I:14626;952;The mix is excellent, you will hear everything from individual voices, to arrows, swords clashing to men screaming.
I:14626;953;Awesome movie and it looks great on blu.
I:14626;954;heck, even VHS for that matter!
I:14626;955;I love this movie, and I'm not exactly a fan of Frank Miller.
I:14626;956;He's generally a bit too mean spirited and hopeless for my taste, but this here's the very best comic book to film translation I've ever seen.
I:14626;957;The story is compelling, the action is amazing and the graphic look of the film is a stunner.
I:14626;958;All around a really landmark movie in many ways.
I:14626;959;"I'm very interested in seeing Zack Snyder's version of the Watchmen (which I think is a way overrated graphic novel and very dated)
I:14626;960;Tough decisions confront those with creative control over art used in furtherance of big business.
I:14626;961;the REAL reasons for their valiant showing at Thermopylae.
I:14626;962;Had the filmmakers opted instead for the courageous pathway of historicity, they could have achieved a cinematic spectacle beyond imagining by depicting the REAL Spartan battle arrays and the magnificent coordinated action that made them work in the face of a both numerically and technically superior force.
I:14626;963;who was pitted in his youth against a wild animal to ensure that only self.
I:14626;964;picking history buffs, truly rocks.
I:14626;965;I've enjoyed this product very much.
I:14626;966;I also will tell others about it.
I:14626;967;And will continue to enjoy it in the future.
I:14626;968;300 is a rare movie that succeeds as pure entertainment, as fairly accurate historical fiction, and as a movie with important messages for our times.
I:14626;969;I'll take these in turn.
I:14626;970;It has a long and noble tradition.
I:14626;971;It is a film depiction of a comic book that was in turn based on the battle of Thermopylae.
I:14626;972;"The best lines come, not from Frank Miller, but from the contemporaneous history written by Herodotus in the 5th century B. c. (when told that the arrows of the Persians will blot out the sun, the Spartans are said to have responded ""Then we will fight in the shade"")."
I:14626;973;If it's good enough for VDH, it's good enough for you.
I:14626;974;finally, the movie entertains, even moves, but in so doing teaches us about ourselves and our future.
I:14626;975;The movie is exciting as all get out.
I:14626;976;If the West is to remain free, the we will do well to keep alive a memory of men like Leonidas, the 300 Spartans and the other Greeks who gave their lives the narrow pass of Thermopylae.5 stars
I:14626;977;i bought this with the idea that it would be a substantial improvement in sound and video.
I:14626;978;I had high hopes for this film before I went to see it.
I:14626;979;"The director Zak Snyder impressed me with his remake of ""Dawn Of The Dead""."
I:14626;980;The battle scenes in this movie are amazing.
I:14626;981;They are really choreographed beautifully.
I:14626;982;The scenery is also beautiful .
I:14626;983;Every Spartan soldier has a regulation six pack (most definitely added afterwards !)
I:14626;984;I also enjoyed some of the monstrous creatures led into battle by the Persians by chains and set loose on the Spartan army.
I:14626;985;Mind you, if you are squeamish, stay away.
I:14626;986;A good action movie showing what happened during one of the battles of the Persian empire era.
I:14626;987;action packed from beginning to end.
I:14626;988;Such a good movie, such an amazing visual style.
I:14626;989;ray, such as extra features, but one of my old ex.
I:14626;990;roommates stole it and sold it for drugs or something a few years ago.
I:14626;991;There was some skipping during a crucial part of the movie but besides that it was good!
I:14626;992;This movie is one of the most perfect adaptations of a graphic novel put to film ever produced.
I:14626;993;I recommend anyone who is interested in a great movie to see this.
I:14626;994;It is on my top 5 list of all time greatest movies made.
I:14626;995;The movie is good (6/10), and the visual style bumps it up to 8/10.
I:14626;996;The direction, the memorable lines, and the comic book style are all perfect.
I:14626;997;And Gerard Butler is spot.
I:14626;998;on as a strong and brave king.
I:14626;999;Best movie I have seen ever, really.
I:14626;1000;300 is an amazing effects film aswell as an amazing film in it's own right.
I:14626;1001;Great acting, suspence loads of blood, true battle fury and excellent epic battles.
I:14626;1002;This movie is a true classic.
I:14626;1003;great story great special effects.
I:14626;1004;Plus I'm a fan of Gerald butler
I:14626;1005;I just love the way Gerard looks in his costume.
I:14626;1006;i thought that the movie 300 was the best movie ever made about ancient mythology and folk lore.
I:14626;1007;Amazing Acting, action, special effects.
I:14626;1008;I absolutely love this movie.
I:14626;1009;This is by far the best adaptation of one of Frank Miller's graphic novels.
I:14626;1010;I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good war movie or something historical.
I:14626;1011;ray is mostly absolutely fantastic.
I:14626;1012;Not for everyone, but if you love films that have action, adventure, and strong visuals, this is your movie!
I:14626;1013;Movie is great came with so many features to watch and packaging was great loved it.
I:14626;1014;Loved it lol love it.
I:14626;1015;if your a greek methodology fan then you will also enjoy this movie its very exciting and will make you watch the new one that comes out in 2014
I:14626;1016;I agree that the costumes of the Persian envoys thrown into the well, are more relevant to the appearance of the Immortals than the costumes they have in the film but the real purpose behind these oddities is probably to terrify the modern viewer and place him in Spartans' shoes, making him/her feel the real terror and excitement of battle.
I:14626;1017;The film uses some famous historical phrases said by Spartans men and women (as Herodotus and other historians reproduced them) but also takes some liberties regarding certain details.
I:14626;1018;I was ready for a decent story line and some shocking scenes and it didn't come close.
I:14626;1019;I love a good battle scene as much as the next person but this show was basically a battle scene with a few other scenes thrown in.
I:14626;1020;This was actually a pretty fun, very campy movie.
I:14626;1021;Tailormade for making jokes about as you're watching, but also pretty darn entertaining.
I:14626;1022;I ordered the movie 300 for my son as a gift from Amazon.
I:14626;1023;but it's a good thing I kept watching.
I:14626;1024;So Leonidas takes 300 men for a walk.
I:14626;1025;there's intrigue back home as the Queen tries to send reinforcements, but mostly, it's battle scenes.
I:14626;1026;the cinematography continues, with the colored filters and a somewhat dizzying switching between slow motion and fast forward.
I:14626;1027;I've since discovered that 300 is based on a graphic novel that's based on a movie that's based on history.
I:14626;1028;the cinematography gave it that stylish, surrealistic feel that fits with the graphic novel.
I:14626;1029;so, 4 stars, but if I'd known what to expect, I'd probably have enjoyed it a half.
I:14626;1030;this movie made me sit on the edge of my seat and actually made me hold my breath at certain scenes, the last time this happened, i was watching the matrix!this movie is going to set a precedant for future epics, just wait a see.
I:14626;1031;do yourselves a favour and watch this movie, just brilliant!
I:14626;1032;If a movie has blood and guts and action and beheadings and fighting and glory and heroism and at least one hot babe I'm gonna enjoy it.
I:14626;1033;"And I just have to have a Spartan helmet
I:14626;1034;this is visual entertainment at a graphic, artistic level.
I:14626;1035;good stuff (for a guy).
I:14626;1036;From film to special features, 300 delivers, again and again.
I:14626;1037;Sparta never looked so good.
I:14626;1038;This movie is one of the best when compared to other comic .>
I:14626;1039;The action, story, cast and special effects were all made for the big screen.
I:14626;1040;It looses a little coming down TV size but still well worth it.
I:14626;1041;For those people with big screen TV, plasma or projectors you will enjoy showing off your equipment with this movie.
I:14626;1042;Wonderful story line of strength and courage!
I:14626;1043;And came right on time as promised.
I:14626;1044;respecting man should own), but I want to say a couple things about the fact that is a Blu.
I:14626;1045;300 is a stunning depiction of one of the most famous battles in all human history.
I:14626;1046;I am not a fan of graphic novels but the vivid stylization and surreal backdrops of this film make it by far one of the most visually captivating films I have seen in at least a decade.
I:14626;1047;300 is not an epic fairy tale of Lord of the Rings or Gladiator proportions, but rather a brilliantly perceived historical telling masterfully produced with modern appeal.
I:14626;1048;Though not wholly accurate, this version of the battle of Thermopylae is definitely exciting and inspiring.
I:14626;1049;As long as it gets a history book opened somewhere.]
I:14626;1050;Breathtaking photography sets the stage for a group of actors so well congealed even the real Leonidas would be proud.
I:14626;1051;A steely ride through the depths of human passion, greed, desire, honor, lust and even humor.
I:14626;1052;It's amazing in the shade.
I:14626;1053;"*In regards to all the critic comments of a film for, ""male posturing and bravado"", this is one woman Spartan enough to call you out on those statistics."
I:14626;1054;"**Somewhere I envision a tattoo of the words, ""The Twenty."
I:14626;1055;300 Is a good movie.
I:14626;1056;But at its core 300 has a good story that is just being told in artful and unique way.
I:14626;1057;It is a good watch.
I:14626;1058;And the blu ray steel book is always a plus.
I:14626;1059;Excellent visual style really brings the comic feel to a big screen.
I:14626;1060;"Quite a few scenes reminded me of ""Savage sword of Conan"" comics I read in my younger years.2."
I:14626;1061;Great audio, listened to the pcm 5.1 track, excellent use of surrounds and bass effects.
I:14626;1062;Much Blood as in a video game with affects that are unique.
I:14626;1063;Butler is great the Queen is great and the Legend teller is fabulous
I:14626;1064;A friend of mine talked me into watching this movie and since supposedly its visually stunning I decided to get it on BlurRay.
I:14626;1065;You can accurately predict the whole movie along with the ending after the first 10 minutes of it.
I:14626;1066;I thoroughly enjoyed this film, from the mesmerizing effects to the wonderful display of muscles, especially those of Gerard Butler.
I:14626;1067;paced action that will keep your attention.
I:14626;1068;Wonderfully cast, excellent score, excellent everything.
I:14626;1069;Nice job Mr. Snyder, hope to see more good things from you in the future.
I:14626;1070;300: AN OPPORTUNITY BUNGLEDHere was an opportunity to convey a genuine message about liberty, resistance to tyranny and self sacrifice in the cause of freedom.
I:14626;1071;now, after 2,500 years, Hollywood has managed to trivialize one of the great turning points of civilization.
I:14626;1072;from the 1930s to the 1950s Hollywood turned out hundreds of fine movies every year.
I:14626;1073;Even the so called B (for budget) movies were generally intelligent, entertaining and often inspiring.
I:14626;1074;Today it would be miraculous if Hollywood managed to produce two or three such films a year (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List and Something the Lord Made come to mind).
I:14626;1075;to mention only a handful of the great films of the past.
I:14626;1076;for a really worthwhile movie about Leonidas and the Battle of Thermopylae see The 300 Spartans (1962, starring Richard Eagan).
I:14626;1077;"Not a great movie
I:14626;1078;It was awe inspiring to me.
I:14626;1079;This film uses all of them.
I:14626;1080;300 gives you a wonderfully historic accounting of the Spartan way of life from birth through the training of the male youth for military service.
I:14626;1081;up for thefilm is complete.
I:14626;1082;The King of Sparta Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his Grecian Army of 300 Spartans battle Persian King Xerxes's ten thousand foreign slave fighters (Rodrigo Santuro) at the Strait of Thermopylae is the premise of this epic film.
I:14626;1083;"Director Snyder of ""Dawn of the Dead"" fame utilizes the some of the same cutting edge CGI graphics techniques that ""Sin City"" (Frank Miller novel/film) encased upon and in us."
I:14626;1084;The green screen gives the director creativity control of mind blowing proportions that relate with Frank Miller's imagination.
I:14626;1085;Imagination brought to life as we read and see it.
I:14626;1086;At times it bordered on the fantasy realm.
I:14626;1087;I'm a big fan of the HBO series Rome, and i have studied the history as well.
I:14626;1088;And to do so for something higher than one's self and for the belief in your country, family and friendship.
I:14626;1089;This movie with the deep thoughts of the war on terror we face today.
I:14626;1090;followed by the perfectly synchronized moving of their shields into one inpenetrable shield.
I:14626;1091;gerard Butler is Fantastic as King Leonidas.
I:14626;1092;He has absorbed the heart and soul of the man, and brought him to life so beautifully and heroically, that you leave the theater a little bit in love with the man he is showing you.
I:14626;1093;vincent Regan delivers a memorable performance as his captain, actually all the performers have done a beautiful job, as well as the director, Zack Snyder.
I:14626;1094;"in addition to the beautiful acting, the scenery was like a constant work of art, and the movements of the warriors were truly, as one person described: ""a warrior ballet."""
I:14626;1095;The music was a perfect compliment, deepening the emotionality.
I:14626;1096;i would just like to thank the people who brought us this fabulous movie.
I:14626;1097;first the action . . . well filmed and choreographed combat scenes of close in hand to hand combat is thrilling and chilling.
I:14626;1098;A heroic stand it certainly was.
I:14626;1099;still, this is a great movie!!!
I:14626;1100;I had high hopes for this movie.
I:14626;1101;All my friends raved about it.
I:14626;1102;300 is an action movie's action movie.
I:14626;1103;Great Movie, Good ActingSome of the special effects as to the misshapen characters of the evading army are a little to Lord of Rings looking and totally take away the reality of this having been an actual battle.
I:14626;1104;But what they forgot is to make a meaningful movie the way Gladiator did.
I:14626;1105;so does wisdom wish us: she is a woman, and never loves any one but a warrior.
I:14626;1106;"Even today these opposing energies infuse our daily lives and charge us with the necessity of choosing one or the other
I:14626;1107;"For me, Bush rarely even displays grammatical correctness never mind the greater intellectual prowess necessary for successful international dialog
I:14626;1108;The passionate totality of birth, life and death are here, but yet still one asks `What is the point?'
I:14626;1109;There are only two main female characters in the movie, first the lush and exotic oracle girl, and the queen and wife of Leonidas and who unfortunately is placed in the position of bargaining for her husband's life with her sexuality.
I:14626;1110;But here again the emotional and domestic rivalries and disputes reflect those on a national and international level.
I:14626;1111;This is a movie by men for men and many of the scenes linger on the rich musky sweat of bold masculinity.300 is incredibly sharp, I struggled to breath in the last sequence with king Leonidas standing against a mighty army of thousands with his little band of men.
I:14626;1112;The lossless audio is fantastic.
I:14626;1113;This one of my favorite movies and I absolutely love it.
I:14626;1114;The artistic value will never cease to amaze me.
I:14626;1115;The audio is great, the vidio is great and watching it with the PIP commentary gives you a much better understanding how each and every least scene was done.
I:14626;1116;really love , doing something good for their people , it's a very good policy.
I:14626;1117;they try to make a miracle.
I:14626;1118;But take from them everything!
I:14626;1119;"This movie is a WOW"" with all the Glory."
I:14626;1120;The booklet is beautifully done .
I:14626;1121;it is well worth the extra money.
I:14626;1122;I love the way color is used in the film.
I:14626;1123;That and the fantastic combat sequences make this an exciting action film to watch.
I:14626;1124;Gerard Butler simply looks awesome and amazing as the king!
I:14626;1125;Before 300 I always thought Gerard had the potential to be a big movie star and I'm glad he is one now!
I:14626;1126;It certainly gave us a colorful, action filled, balletic vision of hand to hand combat.
I:14626;1127;My lack of satisfaction with it in purely cinemagraphic terms was the absence of the kind of tension, the constant uncertainty as to outcome, both individual and collective, that marks the best combat scenes on film.
I:14626;1128;I liked the acrobatic techniques but never felt for a moment that these could be real people fighting a real battle.
I:14626;1129;we see the Persian gold pouring out his tunic (neat trick that) when she deals with him later.
I:14626;1130;what would I recommend: if you like choreographed, colorful display (by one party to hand to hand combat), and splashy camera work painting a portrait of war, this should suit you.
I:14626;1131;The makers of the movie obviously knew their history, and there are some subtle allusions to historical fact, IF you're willing to look closely.
I:14626;1132;Nobody knows whether this is historically accurate or not.
I:14626;1133;In any case, this scene is a nice symbolic representation of that episode.
I:14626;1134;now on to the the most interesting aspects of the film.
I:14626;1135;"Gerard Butler is terrific as the gallant Leonidas
I:14626;1136;honor and very focused on his objective.
I:14626;1137;It's also nice to note how the film points out how Spartan women had more rights than elsewhere in the ancient world.
I:14626;1138;the battle scenes are well done, and the very first battle scene is likely the closest as cinema will ever come to re.
I:14626;1139;do it, whether it's made next year or 500 years from now.
I:14626;1140;In my mind, this film has something for everyone.
I:14626;1141;Historians will like it because it provides an impressionistic representation of what happened @ Thermopylae in August of 480BCE.
I:14626;1142;i loved this film, and I hated the guys who screwed it up.
I:14626;1143;This film had truly great potential with a far deeper plot than Braveheart, greater scope and even greater armies than Lord of the Rings.
I:14626;1144;"In terms of filming, it is a triumph like nothing I've ever seen
I:14626;1145;So many things in there are still that good that I totally recommend it.
I:14626;1146;I just doubt it will be the best watch of your life.
I:14626;1147;You will be distracted by many of the special effects and brought to the threshold of a migrane.
I:14626;1148;This movie is great, everything about it is great, its like Zack Snyder saw Frank Millers graphic novel 300 and just decided to make it into the best movie a man can watch.
I:14626;1149;One of the top three movies of allllll time.
I:14626;1150;Yes its that good, it makes you want to jump out of your seat, grab a shield and a spear, and win the fight yourself.
I:14626;1151;zack Snyder is a talented director.

I:14626;1153;muscled man candy to keep the giddy female viewers interested.
I:14626;1154;He hit the nail on the head for this movie.
I:14626;1155;"For all of its corn and cheesy cold war overtones, this movie is still superior to ""300""."
I:14626;1156;The sort of people who'll enjoy this film.
I:14626;1157;most of them good folks.
I:14626;1158;styled god and ruler of the world.
I:14626;1159;"the stand by the ""300"" at the ""Hot Gates"" is dramatic, epic, and incredibly gory, but also a rousing display of defiance by the free warriors of Sparta and their allies against a Persian Army composed of slaves."
I:14626;1160;"minded queen
I:14626;1161;this movie is highly recommended to those with an interest in a remarkable, graphically original rendering of an ancient story with a moral still valid for the present day.

I:14626;1163;If you like a lot of action this is the movie for you!
I:14626;1164;Great animation and plenty of villains throughout the movie too!
I:14626;1165;It's right up there with Braveheart and The Emperors Club.
I:14626;1166;An incredible story with some great acting/screenplay and special effects.
I:14626;1167;The acting was great and the battle sequences were freaking awesome!
I:14626;1168;Was a pretty good movie.
I:14626;1169;I got this for christmas.
I:14626;1170;But this movie was good.
I:14626;1171;Even the special features were interesting and the clip about the history of the movie and how it was based on true events.
I:14626;1172;An inexpensive addition to your blu ray collection and a very good movie.
I:14626;1173;Some pretty bloody scenes and some adult content as well.
I:14626;1174;Wonderful movie, great story, superb action and effects.
I:14626;1175;Loved every minute of it.
I:14626;1176;Definitely one of my all time favorites.
I:14626;1177;Watch this one before you go to the theaters to watch 300:Rise of an empire.
I:14626;1178;And yes the sequel is really good too!
I:14626;1179;Even if it's probably exaggerated, the story is still an inspiring one .
I:14626;1180;"and the adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel ""300"" is a stunning one ."
I:14626;1181;literally stunning, since it bombards the viewer with larger.
I:14626;1182;life characters, smashing visuals and tight direction.
I:14626;1183;It goes a bit too fast for its own good, but it's a truly epic film that takes the historical war movie to another level .

I:14626;1187;so Leonidas takes out three hundred of his best men, along with their nervy Arcadian allies, and begin trouncing the Persians.
I:14626;1188;They respect and care about each other, and Leonidas is as kind as he can be even to Ephialtes, the traitor.
I:14626;1189;and it's done in a manner appropriate to its comic book origins .
I:14626;1190;The battles are shockingly good, and full of fantasy.
I:14626;1191;But we also get some beautiful visuals as well .
I:14626;1192;"top at times, it's hard not to be moved by dialogue that can be darkly funny (""It's just an eye."
I:14626;1193;butler and Headey are simply great as Leonidas and Gorgo .
I:14626;1194;they're both strong, passionate and fearless, and they both do a great job in their separate storylines.
I:14626;1195;But the movie is filled with good performances .
I:14626;1196;300 is a unique, stirring, stunning movie that pushes the action.
I:14626;1197;movie envelope, and gives a thrilling edge to a real.
I:14626;1198;life story of overwhelming power.
I:14626;1199;I'm funny about Hollywood messing around with ancient history so you may not want to use me as a guide for this review of 300.
I:14626;1200;i will say the battle scenes are well done and the acting is pretty decent which is why I decided to give this three stars instead of two.
I:14626;1201;My Greek and Roman Tragedy professor even liked it.
I:14626;1202;This movie is great because of the effects and action.
I:14626;1203;I've never seen a movie that looked like this, my kids loved it!
I:14626;1204;This movie was an amazing visual spectical with a very interesting way of using the narrative to flash back and forth from the stark reality of the battle field to the honor virtue and lore of the Spartan society and the resounding trembling of their glorious battle.
I:14626;1205;With hazy colouring, sepia tone, and freeze frame action sequences.
I:14626;1206;this movie was a sheer delight filled with freaks, amazing fighting and tons of gorey bloodshed.
I:14626;1207;And to back up all those joys this movie also has amazing cinemetography and an interesting story line.
I:14626;1208;I would advise seeing this movie it is definetly one of the most enjoyable and fun films I have seen in a while.
I:14626;1209;The action and special effects were awesome!
I:14626;1210;My fiance and I were very impressed.
I:14626;1211;Tremendous fun and absorbing eye.
I:14626;1212;exquisite female nudity, as provided by the pubescent girl (17?
I:14626;1213;The battle scenes were relentlessly entertaining and at turns unintentionally funny in just how overdone and hyperbolic they were.
I:14626;1214;"generated
I:14626;1215;"I did a Google search for ""history of Sparta"" and found out many very interesting things."
I:14626;1216;We Americans eat up all of our government's propaganda telling us how wonderfully free and democratic our nation is, and this is true only relative to countries like North Korea and Cuba, but beyond those extremes, when compared to say Sweden or Canada or Germany the US is really best described as a corporate plutocracy that happens to be very adept at manufacturing consent on the part of its citizens for this status quo.
I:14626;1217;Directed with technical flourish by Zack Snyder, this visually elaborate 2007 action film is a fictionalized retelling of that momentous event as it was vividly envisioned in Frank Miller's1999 graphic novel.
I:14626;1218;The problem is that Snyder keeps painting the story's mythological aspects with broader and broader brushstrokes.
I:14626;1219;It takes a certain artistry to provide grace and power to a story mythologized from a real event, but it appears most of the filmmakers' efforts lie on the surface.
I:14626;1220;Disc One has the best extra .
I:14626;1221;There is no doubt Snyder did a lot of research, and he is extremely forthcoming with the behind.
I:14626;1222;scenes details, which in this case, is very helpful.
I:14626;1223;Disc Two contains a lot of small extras, the most prominent being the mostly intriguing 24.
I:14626;1224;This is the first movie that I went to see twice in a theatre, since Star Wars!
I:14626;1225;Yes, I'm in my 50's, but thoroughly enjoyed this macho adaptation of the true story of Thermopylae.
I:14626;1226;It was a great movie.
I:14626;1227;I strongly recommend it to people who love fight movies.
I:14626;1228;well, it cut out 4 times.
I:14626;1229;There's fighting, there's more fighting, and still more fighting.
I:14626;1230;well, thankfully I bought it on sale.
I:14626;1231;So take that for what it's worth.
I:14626;1232;But I still managed to watch it mostly as its own story.
I:14626;1233;"like action poses
I:14626;1234;Every time a cool pose is achieved the action slows down so we can get a nice look, then it speeds up again so we can get to the next cool pose.
I:14626;1235;I liked the way I could see how the warriors killing ballet worked out, but I was longing for a sense of the action in real time.
I:14626;1236;"In my opinion, the ""real"" story of Thermopylae is a more complex and enthralling tale than this fantasy."
I:14626;1237;"If the goal was to recreate the look and feel of the comic
I:14626;1238;When I watch a movie (fantasy or otherwise) no matter how surreal or fantastic the environment, I want to believe I'm there.
I:14626;1239;Everyone did a decent job accept Faramir (David Wenham).
I:14626;1240;I thought Quasi was a pretty clever idea.
I:14626;1241;Sound and picture are good enough.
I:14626;1242;Watching this film and evaluating how I felt about it were a little more complex than I thought (since this is a pretty simple film).
I:14626;1243;For the price for all this it was a great but.
I:14626;1244;Good movie and extra stuff are cool.
I:14626;1245;This film is a visual splendor, the continuing growth of creative talent in unique styles.
I:14626;1246;The production values are amazing.
I:14626;1247;The actors are talented and believable, and not all are familiar faces although I expect to see more of them!
I:14626;1248;The script is powerful, and the Spartans face an ethical challenge.
I:14626;1249;Their battle is poignant and inspiringly courageous.
I:14626;1250;The Spartans kept their honor, lifestyle and ethics at the price of their lives, and are a shining example of integrity.
I:14626;1251;which is a vote of confidence and pride in their men.
I:14626;1252;A fabulous film, watch it and be inspired!
I:14626;1253;I'm a history buff and will be interested in seeing the classic story of the Battle of Thermopylae retold.
I:14626;1254;this one is definitely one that some will watch because of the great fight scenes and others will watch for the landscape.
I:14626;1255;this is a beautifully told story.
I:14626;1256;i always considered this an interesting story, but i've never heard a better version.
I:14626;1257;Very gripping story that kept our attention even on a night when we were both exhausted.
I:14626;1258;The acting is also compelling.
I:14626;1259;I was very pleased with the movie 300.
I:14626;1260;I think it portrays the times well.
I:14626;1261;It wouldn't be good for small children but I enjoyed the historical backgroung.
I:14626;1262;ray, the spirit of the movie is the same as in the cinema version, beautiful images.
I:14626;1263;all around good flick that I would certainly recommend watching.
I:14626;1264;Audiences are intelligent enough to realize that this is a movie based on a graphic novel, not an accurate depiction of what actually happened.
I:14626;1265;Yes, it's that simple!The movie itself is a stunning piece of art.
I:14626;1266;"Gerard Butler shines as Leonidas and his fierce outcry ""Spartans, tonight we dine IN HELL!"""
I:14626;1267;It's a movie about heroes and sacrifice, about magic and war, about love and loss.
I:14626;1268;of Butler an his warriors dressed in codpieces and capes, HOT darn it!It's amazing entertainment done well by everyone involved.
I:14626;1269;I heard that Snyder's new project may also include Mr. Butler and that's wonderful news!
I:14626;1270;"But in a good way!This is ""300"", a movie adaptation of a comic book version of a historical event."
I:14626;1271;300 mentions most of the key events around the battle of Thermopylae.
I:14626;1272;Miller's imagery presents very well on the big screen through Zack Snyder's direction.
I:14626;1273;It's from a comic book, so everything is larger than life.
I:14626;1274;The use of color was brilliant, and shapes the mood of the viewer with remarkable grace.
I:14626;1275;This movie overwhelms with vignettes of image, each more powerful than the last.
I:14626;1276;I was particularly impressed by the imagery of the Spartan phalanx, capturing the power, beauty, and lethality of a coordinated team that has been trained and forged into a whole greater than the sum of its parts.
I:14626;1277;This story is well told.
I:14626;1278;It is also the story of Queen Gorgo, and one of the few cultures of the time that treated women with the respect they deserve.
I:14626;1279;The Queen was a powerful woman of integrity, and the treatment of her piece of 300 is respectful, well told, and shows the whole woman.
I:14626;1280;world impact: I am amused.
I:14626;1281;The President of Iran's response to this movie is very telling.
I:14626;1282;It's from a comic book!
I:14626;1283;Still, regardless of the reason, his demands to suppress the arts speak volumes about his vision for Iran and the world.
I:14626;1284;as a source for leadership vignettes: pretty darned good.
I:14626;1285;core porn, it is pretty even.
I:14626;1286;handed and diverse in its nature, especially in Xerxes' tents.
I:14626;1287;"in all, I enjoyed ""300"" and was moved by the final scene, where the entire story is placed in context by the narrator."
I:14626;1288;It's not for everyone, but it is very good for what it is.
I:14626;1289;It was one continuous uproar of men grunting, screaming, beating their chests, waiving swords in the air, and directing general carnage.
I:14626;1290;sculpted, ripped young men and women, spouting the virtues of freedom, democracy, etc.
I:14626;1291;Because it's one heck of a ride!
I:14626;1292;OK, so it goes over the top several times, but the battles are huge and blood.
I:14626;1293;Possibly, but I had a lot of fun doing it!
I:14626;1294;A small amount can move mountains.
I:14626;1295;This movie will keep your attention throughout.
I:14626;1296;And lots of nakedness to go with it.
I:14626;1297;pretty good movie id say.
I:14626;1298;One of the best gladiator movies out.
I:14626;1299;Action and CGI in this film along with the storyline absolutely rock.
I:14626;1300;One of my Fav movies.
I:14626;1301;telling of the Battle of Thermoplyae, takes you into the darker side of that historical conflict.
I:14626;1302;High production value, moderate over.
I:14626;1303;defined space (also suitable for video games!)
I:14626;1304;in sum, I view this film as an interesting technological experiment in working with computers, possibly with good applications in future video games, and/or adjuncts to future films.
I:14626;1305;And as such, it's a pretty good cartoon (I particularly liked the 3.
I:14626;1306;As a film, with a believable plot, believable dialog, interesting character development, etc, etc, it's pretty much a bust!
I:14626;1307;It was an incredible movie at the theaters and should look just as good in the living room on Blu.
I:14626;1308;picture while watching the final product with director commentary.
I:14626;1309;I'm usually not one to enjoy extra features too much, but this disk is filled to the brim with great extra and bonuses.
I:14626;1310;"i was highly, highly impressed, and this will be my new ""go."
I:14626;1311;"They keep saying that ""300"" is historically inaccurate, and that it's either for or against homosexuality (due to the excessive violence, the physical appearance of the Spartans, and Xerxes in particular)."
I:14626;1312;enact the battle between the Spartans and the Persians, through Frank Miller's stunning vision.
I:14626;1313;It's all about the action and the fantastic visuals, so it's basically a visual feast.
I:14626;1314;So try to ignore the critics, and enjoy this wild spectacle: full of action, blood, and some chilling music.
I:14626;1315;My son and I are waiting (patiently) to see the continuation.
I:14626;1316;Fans will thrill to the carnage and get blood.
I:14626;1317;it was a fantastic price, it arrived very quickly and it's in perfect condition!
I:14626;1318;The most interesting piece for me was explaining what was fiction and fact concerning the Spartan people and what made them unique in the Greek/Persian world of that era.
I:14626;1319;This telling is unlike any film I'd seen before.
I:14626;1320;as an artist, I thought it spectacular.
I:14626;1321;Though it's bloody, the color of it is nearly black, giving it an artistic edge.
I:14626;1322;action photography is amazing, the choreographed battle scenes are amazing, and Gerard Butler is AMAZING .
I:14626;1323;his best, in my opinion.
I:14626;1324;greek mythology has been an interest of mine since grade school, and while I saw the 1960's film which is very good, this version is modern, fresh and very entertaining.
I:14626;1325;Best story at most points based on historical fact.
I:14626;1326;excellent rendition of a comic book script to a movieLoved it
I:14626;1327;This movie is one of my favorites.
I:14626;1328;It was a fine balance between the Sparta's history, comedy, love, devotion and commitment.
I:14626;1329;The director did a great job to put this together so it flows and keeps you at the edge of your seet and you eyes glued to the television.
I:14626;1330;Great graphics, very heroic, fun.
I:14626;1331;Still, I would recommend the film for some grand entertainment.
I:14626;1332;Its quite possible that I may go see it again.
I:14626;1333;I was amazed at the Frank Miller's amazing vision and how he created this cinema production and CGI effects which tricks our eyes into seeing a much greater scope of bigger.
I:14626;1334;I adore Gerard Butler's expressive voice and eyes and how he commands the story with his convincing role as King Leonidas.
I:14626;1335;of course, well worth the result when you watch the fight sequences.
I:14626;1336;This review will not speak to Director Zach Snyder's excellent handling of the superb (Frank Miller graphic novel) source material, nor will it speak to the tremendous job done by the cast of highly skilled, excellent actors.
I:14626;1337;Every environment in the film, while intensely stylized and computer.
I:14626;1338;The score is sweeping and majestic, the dialogue is pinpoint tight in it's aural focus and delivery, and the battle scenes deliver a brutally visceral audio impact so intense it made this reviewer shriek and gleefully erupt like a little Spartan girl (which is incredible, given that the reviewer is actually a little boy, and not a Spartan).
I:14626;1339;I loved this movie when it first showed at theaters.
I:14626;1340;The movie itself is great (as long as you're not too squeamish about blood).
I:14626;1341;Excellent movie I saw it twicw once in the regular then in IMAX amazing story!
I:14626;1342;I went to see the movie twice.
I:14626;1343;This movie was fun from the beginning to the end.
I:14626;1344;I really loved the way the movie looked, it looked like nothing I have ever seen before.
I:14626;1345;If you want a movie that has great action, and great fun.
I:14626;1346;Like I said the movies awesome Always loved it but when I got it today I noticed the case has a huge crack running along the back of it which is why I gave it 3 out of 5 but the movie itself 5 out of 5
I:14626;1347;This is a stark, powerful, and profoundly disturbing film.
I:14626;1348;The action scenes are shot with great skill and the computer generation is up to date.
I:14626;1349;The message is most important.
I:14626;1350;"You will learn that ""freedom"" means personal honor rather than responsibility toward others."
I:14626;1351;You will learn that a great person is one who kills without warning or reason and a great nation is a nation that destroys and dominates other nations.
I:14626;1352;"You will learn that everything should be sacrificed to the military and to war
I:14626;1353;You will see propaganda worthy of Hitler and Mussolini, who also commissioned art like this.
I:14626;1354;This is a good warrior movie and gives some historical information which is interesting and is well made and the new web special features are nice, but the movie is certainly not for general family viewing even adults.
I:14626;1355;300 is a fantastical telling of an otherwise true and historical event, that event being the Battle of Thermopylae.
I:14626;1356;This movie has simply stunning visuals and excellent choreography.
I:14626;1357;Its worth seeing for those reasons alone.
I:14626;1358;its fantasy aspects aside, this movie has a surprising amount of historical accuracy.
I:14626;1359;An enjoyable action movie with a good story, incredible battle scenes, and bit of a history lesson.
I:14626;1360;I've always been a fan of epic battle.
I:14626;1361;type films, and this one sure doesn't disappoint.
I:14626;1362;The effects could've carried this film, but surprisingly, the performances are just as exciting.
I:14626;1363;And the guys in this film made me want to hit the gym after seeing it.
I:14626;1364;Perhaps a bit too unidimensional to be an award winner, but certainly worth watching.
I:14626;1365;First off I want to say that I enjoyed this movie very much and I was completely entertained, and that's why I go to the movies after all, is to be entertained.
I:14626;1366;"And yes, ""300"" is visually stunning, however, I felt like I was watching a CGI video game."
I:14626;1367;"I believe that many of the critics that bashed this film did so due to the fact that the ""artsy"" look of the film takes away from the human realism of the movie's characters."
I:14626;1368;"The ""hunchback"" Spartan that wanted to walk in his Father's shoes and die for his King is completely computer generated, but he still puts in a stellar performance!"
I:14626;1369;god , King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) that has the height of a true giant, and the hands the size of a car's hubcaps is totally awesome.
I:14626;1370;The film achieves it's goal by catching it's audience's attention from the very beginning and holding it to the very end.
I:14626;1371;"these are just a few feelings that I had concerning the movie, and is why many of us write ""reviews"" in the first place."
I:14626;1372;To share our experience of a particular film, whether good or bad, and to recommend seeing it or avoiding it.
I:14626;1373;"I highly recommend seeing this movie to fans of similar movies such as, ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and Colin Farrell's ""Alexander,"" which takes the viewer on a fantastic journey into the world of the real and the unreal."
I:14626;1374;"Again I truly enjoyed this film
I:14626;1375;Bravo to the special effects crews, who without them, this film would look like something from either late 1950's Hollywood or today's History Channel.
I:14626;1376;"clich rhetoric, lines such as ""Remember this day men!"""
I:14626;1377;There is plenty of eye candy for those who enjoy gratuitous slow.
I:14626;1378;It's just the kind of movie that does well at the box office and that the masses eat up and praise vehemently.
I:14626;1379;"This is the most glorious fight ever"" and on and on."
I:14626;1380;There is a strong attempt to make this story come to life visually and artistically the way it was written.
I:14626;1381;entertainment for entertainment's sake: that's about it.
I:14626;1382;"Some will love it
I:14626;1383;Movie is one of the greatest movies i ever seen love everything about it, i would strongly recommend this movie on blue ray to any BD user ,,,
I:14626;1384;The artistic style of this film is a perfect match for blu.
I:14626;1385;This movie is an amazing thing to look at.
I:14626;1386;Those with an interest in Art Direction and Cinematography will have plenty to keep them interested.
I:14626;1387;The action is beautifully filmed .
I:14626;1388;and you CAN describe these bloody sequences as beautiful.
I:14626;1389;"The attention to detail in following the source Frank Miller comic is striking, and the team succeeded in their stated intent to ""bring the book to life""."
I:14626;1390;This film stands with Blade Runner as a milestone .
I:14626;1391;many future projects will use what 300 has brought to the table from a visual perspective.
I:14626;1392;The camraderie is genuine, and informs the performances of the actors involved in the battle sequences in a way I haven't seen since Saving Private Ryan.
I:14626;1393;There is also a tremendous weight placed on the perception of events from the Spartan point of view.
I:14626;1394;The fanciful nature of many of the creatures encountered during the battle made a. lot of sense to me .
I:14626;1395;the greatest strength of this film is also it's greatest weakness.
I:14626;1396;a beautifully filmed and unusually crafted war film.
I:14626;1397;I found it inspirational as well as entertaining, and will enjoy watching it again
I:14626;1398;having it avalable at amazon was great.
I:14626;1399;"Zack Snyder's film adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel ""300"" is impressive."
I:14626;1400;Gerard Butler and the rest of the cast do a great job.
I:14626;1401;And whatever Gerard Butler does with his jaw and teeth throughout the movie is fascinating.
I:14626;1402;Provides an interesting take of the alleged Persian/Sparta fight with King Leonidas albeit a bit graphic.
I:14626;1403;It is entertaining with very little dead spots.
I:14626;1404;Such a great movie I was compelled to have a copy especially in Blu Ray for viewing during trips etc.
I:14626;1405;"It was about an entertaining story, as Miller described,""the best damn story I've ever gotten my hands on"" and impressive, arresting visual style."
I:14626;1406;I am all for fun and entertainment.
I:14626;1407;I love action movies, I am a fan of Comic books adaptations .
I:14626;1408;many entertaining movies were successfully adapted from the comic books.
I:14626;1409;This was an awesome movie!
I:14626;1410;The filming was very unusual and creative, the music was excellent, effects were terrific, and it was super action packed with lots of great fighting!
I:14626;1411;"ish
I:14626;1412;pounding, or emotionally or intellectually engaging, or even technically innovative about any of it.
I:14626;1413;"this is the sort of film that appeals almost exclusively to the ""Man, that is WAY cool!"""
I:14626;1414;There's more to telling an interesting story than blue screen effects and using CGI to touch up the abdominal muscles of the cast in an effort to make them look extra.
I:14626;1415;The depiction of ancient Sparta is factually correct and brings great substance to the need to go to war against Xerxes and the Persian Empire.
I:14626;1416;300 is a awesome movie.
I:14626;1417;It's hard to describe why this film is so visually compelling.
I:14626;1418;just something you have to experience I think.
I:14626;1419;But combine that with the intriguing story and terrific performances.
I:14626;1420;and you've got two thumbs up.
I:14626;1421;better than Troy, and as good as Gladiator.
I:14626;1422;This movie was visually stunning and had a gripping, thrilling storyline.
I:14626;1423;This is a good movie.
I:14626;1424;"Having seen the 1962 film,""300 Spartans"",and though a comic book admirer, this newer, graphic comic."
I:14626;1425;take on the last stand satisfies only modestly.
I:14626;1426;"Both films share a fictional rendition, though ""300"" has a unique visual stamp to its efforts."
I:14626;1427;created Pompeiian town in detail, the film never makes an attempt to wrap the action in historicity.
I:14626;1428;"The History channel's ""Last Stand of the 300"" is the real take on this incident."
I:14626;1429;I bought it as a gift for my Boyfriend, he wanted to see it without the censorship that regular TV enforces.
I:14626;1430;This was one of the best action flicks of the year to date.
I:14626;1431;Great story, great special effects, great actors and most of all great director.
I:14626;1432;One of the best movies ever made!
I:14626;1433;The set locations are so beautifully depicted and the guys are so easy onthe eyes.
I:14626;1434;This turned out to be a great copy.
I:14626;1435;Looks so good on a high def tv.
I:14626;1436;The movie is very well done.
I:14626;1437;the acting is very good and the story line is great.
I:14626;1438;i have watch the movie over couple of times and see something new each time.
I:14626;1439;Only bought this because of Amazon's incredible low price during the black friday sale of 2007 and it didn't dissappoint me, the battle scenes are pretty good and the look of the film is obviously one of a kind.
I:14626;1440;In the great spirit of sin city.
I:14626;1441;Great retelling of the classic story at Thermopolae.
I:14626;1442;Great character development of Leonidas by Miller.
I:14626;1443;Great Movie Looks And Sounds Excellent On Blu RayA Must Have !!!!!
I:14626;1444;this is one of the best, most original films I've seen in a long time!
I:14626;1445;I have just a couple of things I'd like to mention.
I:14626;1446;That's because, in the eyes of the Spartan narrating the story, he is.
I:14626;1447;I'm saying it was the narrative point of view to the story, and integral to understanding the point of view for the Spartans(in the movie).
I:14626;1448;if you like action (good action), and great cinematography, and useful dialog.
I:14626;1449;visual candy, amazing sound, originality, and the feeling that the people making this film actually put some time, and effort into giving a good show, then check it out for yourself.
I:14626;1450;me, I love this MOVIE!
I:14626;1451;Gerard Butler held his own as the lead actor.
I:14626;1452;It is a very motivating and inspirational movie.
I:14626;1453;I would recommend everyone watch it but beware the two nude scenes if watching with kids.
I:14626;1454;My husband and I enjoyed Sin City and this movie as well!
I:14626;1455;Great special effects which is a great talent of Frank Miller's!
I:14626;1456;fast paced action with more emotion than you'd think.
I:14626;1457;with a very excellent soundtrack.
I:14626;1458;both stories have more more entertaining depictions of asymetrical warfare.
I:14626;1459;please let me know if there is any problem with the order?Regards,Gavin
I:14626;1460;Fancy computer graphics and a nice soundtrack do not a movie make.
I:14626;1461;and perhaps some young viewer will be inspired to learn more about the pre.
I:14626;1462;whether '300' becomes in time a classic of blue screen technoloby, a legendary work of cinema art, a cult film for a few forever.
I:14626;1463;It surpasses 'Sin City' in its message and 'Gladiator' in its visuals and therefore both as a work of art.
I:14626;1464;This is as Miller wrote it, a comic book version of history as told by a pop culture story teller, and the details are not important, nor is verisimilitude, because these things exist in the imagination of those who care to listen.
I:14626;1465;but what a tale it is!
I:14626;1466;his tomb is pointed to with pride, and so too are all his children,And his children's children, and afterward all the race that's his.
I:14626;1467;If you like action movies this is a great one.
I:14626;1468;Its a good action movie that's not overflowing with all kinds of mushy stuff like most are.
I:14626;1469;Just has a lot of fighting scenes with lots of blood and guts.
I:14626;1470;Take Sin City for example, Robert Rodriguez took the source material and made it exactly look like the graphic novel, and along with that he gave us interesting characters with awesome action to go along with it (without slow.
I:14626;1471;The battle sequences are pretty good, but it is an average movie, overall.
I:14626;1472;300 is one of the best movies based on a comic.
I:14626;1473;The effects are terrific and truly believable.
I:14626;1474;If you haven't seen 300 I suggest you get it now because it is one of the best films of 2007.
I:14626;1475;A more intense shot of testosterone you will not find in any film.
I:14626;1476;"Equal parts bravado, guts and glory, ""300"" is simply the most exciting film to come out this year ."
I:14626;1477;To his credit director Zack Snyder is blessed with and uses a cast every bit equal to the challenge of competing with Miller's dark fantastic take of the Spartan's greatest story.
I:14626;1478;His passion and intensity is matched by a splendid performance by Lena Headey as his wife, Queen Gorgo.
I:14626;1479;Though a dutiful wife and a woman in an age when being such was near equal to slave status, she is, in her way, as bold and fearless as her husband/King.
I:14626;1480;while there is blood and gore aplenty, the film also happens to be emotionally satisfying and I found myself with tears welling up in my eyes more than a few times, as well as wanting to raise my fist in the air along with the jacked.
I:14626;1481;While a macho stoicism pervades their attitudes, there are, to be sure, signs of a greater humanity beneath those ripped abs of Sparta's army .
I:14626;1482;"While this provides an interesting commentary, I heartily recommend leaving that baggage at home and appreciating ""300"" on its own and embracing its escapism."
I:14626;1483;"larry Fong's cinematography ensures that ""300"" is eye."
I:14626;1484;poppingly glorious from start to finish .
I:14626;1485;a magnificent feast for the eyes while Tyler Bates's score is guaranteed to keep your adrenaline pumping as it matches .
I:14626;1486;frame the visual intensity presented on the screen.
I:14626;1487;While critics are divided on this one, audiences are flocking to it and cheering.
I:14626;1488;"For good reason, too: ""300"" is magnificent old."
I:14626;1489;fashioned story telling wed to the very best 21st century filmmaking has to offer.
I:14626;1490;Yet every film made deserves the attention of a well.
I:14626;1491;rounded examination and with that in mind this viewer offers the following thoughts.
I:14626;1492;at a narrow gulch at Thermopylae supported the courage of the mighty buff Spartans to have a logistical advantage.
I:14626;1493;But of course Xerxes' legions of rhinos, elephants and warriors ultimately kill all the Spartans: it is a story of heroism in the face of extraordinary odds.
I:14626;1494;with the exception of a few moments at the beginning and a few well placed breathers through the long two.
I:14626;1495;Yes, it is a successful cinematic transition of a comic book, but the real story of history being told is so much more moving.
I:14626;1496;The action packed movie with an artistic slant ranks a 5 out 5 for me, despite being a self proclaimed history buff.
I:14626;1497;this film is great,plenty of fighting scenes,this film is well made,i recommend this film to everyone.
I:14626;1498;lets hope they make number 2.
I:14626;1499;They rate it a 1 without even seeing the movie on BD, just because they are anti.
I:14626;1500;Never really knew of Gerard Butler, but he is perfect for this role.
I:14626;1501;Not to mention the great movie it is or the fantastic filming or the special effects.
I:14626;1502;Wouldnt want this movie in any other format unless they got something more clear than this!
I:14626;1503;I love action and fighting movies and history.
I:14626;1504;I thought this movie had a chance to be great.
I:14626;1505;The extras are amazing as well.
I:14626;1506;Even if you aren't into the comic book world this movie is still great.
I:14626;1507;I truly enjoyed this movie visually.
I:14626;1508;Ground breaking effects, and amazing battle scenes.
I:14626;1509;a must see if you are even romotely interested in ancient history and filming technology!
I:14626;1510;Overall, an excellent video experience.
I:14626;1511;This is a very graphic movie.
I:14626;1512;Wow a movie without a politically correct message.
I:14626;1513;a generation spoon fed p. c. bs finally gets to see a movie that speaks to the heroic ideas born within.
I:14626;1514;the special effects are very good.
I:14626;1515;Great service and shipping by amazon.
I:14626;1516;Hands down the best movie of 2007!
I:14626;1517;Saw it again in blu.
I:14626;1518;def television in the comfort of my living room.
I:14626;1519;"This is definitely a ""must have""!"
I:14626;1520;300 is an amazing conversion of a graphic novel to the screen.
I:14626;1521;In these days of corporate control and marketing, it is amazing that Frank miller's incredible work has made it to the screen in such a faithful version.
I:14626;1522;stream movie, it is required viewing for all film fans, and I'm sure will also be used as training material in film schools all over the world (every frame is a work of art).
I:14626;1523;The extras disk will tell you all you need to know about this great film.
I:14626;1524;This movie is great, and the special features are killer for history buffs and Frank Miller fans
I:14626;1525;This title was as enjoyable at home as it was in the theater.
I:14626;1526;The 300The 300 is based on the epic novel by Frank Miller.
I:14626;1527;Highly recommended for fans of up close and personal blood and guts warfare.
I:14626;1528;This movie is a great must own.
I:14626;1529;This is a GREAT movie!
I:14626;1530;This Epic tale is a must have and definitely a staple of every collection.
I:14626;1531;Highly recommended and one of my personal All.
I:14626;1532;Movies like this can do great harm when viewed and cherished by the great multitudes of parochially educated, culturally and historically ignorant people that populate most of our world.
I:14626;1533;Of course, everyone knows this is a fantasy movie.
I:14626;1534;I'd give the trailer a genuine five stars, really.
I:14626;1535;There is a lot of colour in this film which I like.
I:14626;1536;It has the most interesting of starts and I liked it more when I went back home and spoke of it with people.
I:14626;1537;I loved the Rugby like battle formations.
I:14626;1538;"(I mean, give me a break) ""Lord of the Ring"" fans will sit back and smile at each other after watching 300."
I:14626;1539;motion and amazing combat, this is the movie for you.
I:14626;1540;Lord of the Rings was fantasy, filming it as such was the right thing to do.
I:14626;1541;The Battle of Thermopylae was a real event and deserves to be portrayed that way.
I:14626;1542;"But I'll give him some credit
I:14626;1543;The other thing about a movie is its entertainment value.
I:14626;1544;Since I can't watch it, I give this movie 1 star.
I:14626;1545;It's no wonder the Walton family are so rich.
I:14626;1546;all the classic lines from the story.
I:14626;1547;300 is a man's man's man's flick and is a muscular love poem which celebrates the ideals of honor, courage, sacrifice, and standing up for your beliefs.
I:14626;1548;Of these, the legendary Battle of Thermopylae is the most dramatic and is the mother of all last stands.
I:14626;1549;I first heard about the Battle of Thermopylae (480BC) and the 300 Spartans way back when I was in high school, and I thought it a nifty story from the very first.
I:14626;1550;A few years ago, I read Frank Miller's graphic novel 300 and enjoyed it tremendously, not caring at all that he altered things here and there as he opted instead to focus on the story's artistry, its sense of grandeur, and its mythological aspects.
I:14626;1551;This young man is Leonidas, who will become the king of the Greek city.
I:14626;1552;we pick up decades later as a Persian emissary pays a visit to King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his proud, beautiful wife and Queen, Gorgo (Lena Headey).
I:14626;1553;washy Spartan council, Leonidas gathers the 300 most capable soldiers in Sparta and, armed with a clever strategic plan, marches away to take on the vast hordes of the Persian invasion.
I:14626;1554;end SPOILERS.300 is bold in its scope and relentless in its take.
I:14626;1555;It is a sweeping and sumptuously stark visual feast and would've made Frank Frazetta cream on his canvas.
I:14626;1556;If 300 is based on Frank Miller's work (and it is), then Miller's art has to have been influenced in some ways by the great Frazetta.
I:14626;1557;motion (yeah, I think that's the technical term) bits are nicely executed and result in more thrilling battle scenes.
I:14626;1558;But a manly ballet, with hair on it.
I:14626;1559;And, I don't often mention music in relation to films, but composer Tyler Bates truly adds an extra dimension of thrills with his thundering, pulse.
I:14626;1560;With his compelling and righteous performance, with towering machismo sweating out of his pores, he out.
I:14626;1561;"or (my favorite) ""Give them nothing but take from them."
I:14626;1562;Yet, his fierce and uncompromising temperament and his joy in battle are tempered by the obvious love and respect he holds for his wife.
I:14626;1563;As Gorgo, Headey works hard to be fierce, dedicated, intelligent, and realistic.
I:14626;1564;The actress is successful as I never doubted for a sec that this resolute woman is a Spartan to the very core.
I:14626;1565;I'd place it at the same excellent level as GLADIATOR.
I:14626;1566;The story is unmatchable in its timelessness and resonance, the action is non.
I:14626;1567;stop and visually compelling, the images are oh.
I:14626;1568;memorable, and the lead characters are mezmerizing.
I:14626;1569;Unique characters and an interesting story line.
I:14626;1570;Movie was well done and is an enjoyable action adventure film.
I:14626;1571;This is by far the best epic movie of all time (along with Braveheart).
I:14626;1572;It has great action and excellent special effects.
I:14626;1573;The storyline is also top notch.
I:14626;1574;This item work very good.
I:14626;1575;You have to keep in mind that it is based on a comic book so the coloring and graphics are going to look exactly like a graphic novel, which is actually one of the best parts because it is so unique.
I:14626;1576;Also, while you are watching it, you can see a lot of intentional parallels with America and its involvement in the war in Iraq.
I:14626;1577;So this movie is actually oddly relevant.
I:14626;1578;this movie will have you rooting for the 300 spartans and will have you on the edge of your seat.
I:14626;1579;stop action and fairly historically accurate.
I:14626;1580;"It also follows the graphic novel to a ""T""."
I:14626;1581;I highly recommend this for any history fans, graphic novel fans, and fans of war and actions movies.
I:14626;1582;Very interesting from a historical standpoint.
I:14626;1583;Lots of action, drama and adventure.
I:14626;1584;If you enjoy historical dramas it's for you.
I:14626;1585;It may do well by the graphic novel it is based on, but for anything else.
I:14626;1586;A wreckless work for all mankind.
I:14626;1587;I don't like violent films but this was so well done I didn't mind the blood.
I:14626;1588;Not a historically correct portrayal of the Spartan war against the Persian empire, but a visual treat for those who love the lore, gore and mythical aspects of Greek history.
I:14626;1589;A fantastic feast for the eyes .
I:14626;1590;"dropping and creates magnificent, surreal battles, humans, and ""creatures""."
I:14626;1591;Every minute is filled with tension and excitement and most should be credited to Gerard Butler whose appearance and ferociousness as Leonidas, the Spartan king actually make us believe the few 300 Spartan soldiers may have stood some chance at glory .
I:14626;1592;he is indeed mammoth and engaging.
I:14626;1593;his voice alone is carries the weight of a charging army and he has the charisma of a rock star on screen (as he has been in life).
I:14626;1594;in my opinion, 300 is more engaging than Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, or Alexander the Great.
I:14626;1595;as we are a sensitive audience in the middle of a war.
I:14626;1596;its the best action film I have seen in years.
I:14626;1597;Shows you the definition of strength and why you should never give up.
I:14626;1598;Well, this is the best movie of 2007 for me.
I:14626;1599;I recommend this movie really high.
I:14626;1600;Today, certain things are still worth fighting for.
I:14626;1601;this is one of the best movies ever!!
I:14626;1602;300 is done perfectly, i loved it.
I:14626;1603;gerard butler was a great king leonidas, all the 300 wore great uniforms.
I:14626;1604;a small but strong unit going against a huge tyrant.
I:14626;1605;i let out a tear or two, it was gripping and very emotional what one man and his friends would do for their land and their freedom.
I:14626;1606;he was strong, smart, but also in love and that had me in awe.
I:14626;1607;great film, i loved it.
I:14626;1608;It was word of mouth that brought me to the theater to see it on the big screen.
I:14626;1609;The artwork and special effects were unique and worked as part of the story rather than as just stuck in there because it could be done.
I:14626;1610;This film is interesting for one reason only .
I:14626;1611;Great action movie with excellent direction and story line, make up and special effects.
I:14626;1612;"The last decent Greek epic Hollywood ever made was ""Clash of the Titans"" back around 1980."
I:14626;1613;As far as the movie, the story is great, the style and the colors are great, the effects are great, the only thing I don't like is the exaggerated grain.
I:14626;1614;This was a great movie and we should learn from history, when the Persains told them to throw down their weapons, they replied come and take them.
I:14626;1615;That being said my expectation was lowered (always a good thing) and 'lo and behold I loved every second of this wonderful movie.
I:14626;1616;Similarly styled to Sin City (and in my opinion Sin City had more style than content) but full of fantastic action scenes that make it worth every cent.
I:14626;1617;There is a storyline and its engaging enough.
I:14626;1618;Now that i've seen it, it is perfectly clear to me.
I:14626;1619;this is one of the most epic films i've ever seen, hands down.
I:14626;1620;"Right off the bat in this movie, you can tell what kind of movieyou're in for
I:14626;1621;Now, I had heard that this movie was simple minded, and well,it's not, it's actually a really compelling and inspirational story.
I:14626;1622;"They are superb
I:14626;1623;this movie surprised me, on SO many levels.
I:14626;1624;Visually stunning, masterfully directed, and bringing a graphic novel to life,300 manages to tell a fairly simple story, but it's delivery redefines the historic action genre and comic book movies alike.
I:14626;1625;There is nothing bad to say about this movie or the fact that it is a blu.
I:14626;1626;it is amazing and that is all
I:14626;1627;the effects in this movie are amazing with VISUALS I have NEVER seen in other movies.
I:14626;1628;#3: The movie is basically REAL ancient history with a fictional twist.
I:14626;1629;it seemed a little corny with the acting, but the entire plot was beautiful!!
I:14626;1630;I was expecting all 300 men to be alive but of course it would be to good to be true lol I love it!
I:14626;1631;very thrill art book with a lenticular
I:14626;1632;I was looking through all the products I have reviewed and I was amazed to see that I had yet to review my favorite movie of all time!
I:14626;1633;The film also portrays the culture of Sparta, especially as it relates to their superstitions and their notion of the Spartan supremacy.
I:14626;1634;The battle scenes are excellent and the special effects are second to none.
I:14626;1635;my teenagers love this action packed movie and watch it all the time.
I:14626;1636;Look no further if you want to watch the best action movie of the last few years.
I:14626;1637;the acting is good, the story is great, and the special effects are among the best ever created!The movie is based upon the Spartan's brave stand at Thermopylae against the Persians , and captures the great fighting spirit of Western Civilization against a barbaric , aggressive Arab onslaught ( sound familiar to today's situation?)
I:14626;1638;i highly recommend this great movie !
I:14626;1639;Every time a big movie like this comes out my friend whips out his Blu.
I:14626;1640;is a visually striking, though loosely interpreted, telling of the now.
I:14626;1641;the Battle of Thermopylae is a timeless tale of valor and honor.
I:14626;1642;To most people familiar with Italian Renaissance art, this legend conjures in their minds the great statues by Donatello and Michelangelo.
I:14626;1643;any David who would have a chance of felling the monstrous Philistine had better be credible.
I:14626;1644;Bernini freezes his hero in motion: Taut, fierce, and grimacing, Bernini's magnificent figure conveys both the intent and the execution of his bold, violent act.
I:14626;1645;the genius of 300 lies in Snyder's and cinematographer Larry Fong's ability to dramatize that same highly stylized sense of kinetic energy and unfreeze it.
I:14626;1646;"many reviewers have touted 300's ""comic book"" visual sensibility."
I:14626;1647;In fact, anyone familiar with Frank Miller's striking illustrations will note the same qualities in those works.
I:14626;1648;Using a color scheme of burnished tones, 300 manifests a sophisticated visual unity that owes much more to Jacques.
I:14626;1649;The rich, gorgeous Technicolor prints further intensify the viewing experience.
I:14626;1650;up and wrestler Hulk Hogan in leather briefs.
I:14626;1651;pack abs and bulging biceps on these Spartans are real, the product of a grueling five.
I:14626;1652;piece battle scenes, Snyder gives us relentless, in.your.
I:14626;1653;He conveys with blinding clarity how the Spartans could pull off such a sustained, concerted defense against a numerically superior force.
I:14626;1654;What repelled so many of our literati is also the source of its unexpected devotion among mainstream movie fans, (to the tune of $421 million in gross receipts, as of this writing): Miller and Snyder invest 300 with the stuff of mythical legend.
I:14626;1655;Trust the gods, Leonidas, the governing council cautions him.
I:14626;1656;The epic tone of the story is further realized through the narration of Dilios (David Wenham), the one.
I:14626;1657;eyed warrior who returns to Sparta to relate Leonidas's story of courage and bravado to his own soldiers, firing them up to do battle again with the invading Persians.
I:14626;1658;as Leonidas's wife, Queen Gorgo, Lena Headey gives a stirring performance.
I:14626;1659;"The queen fires back, ""Because only Spartan women give birth to real men!"""
I:14626;1660;"In a quiet scene before Leonidas heads off to war, she bolsters her king's confidence: ""Spartan: Come back with your shield."
I:14626;1661;Its grand sweep and awesome storytelling had me cheering Leonidas's fearless warriors.
I:14626;1662;To a man, these hardcore warriors personify the qualities of character exemplified by Leonidas and his hoplites: heads held high, rigorous discipline, physical prowess, intransigent certainty, moral courage, the ability to face reality at its most grim.
I:14626;1663;this movie is one of the best movies I ever seen, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone 13 and older.
I:14626;1664;This movie is very unique.
I:14626;1665;This is definitely Gerard Butler's (King Leonidas) breakthrough role!!
I:14626;1666;If you are a fan of the graphic novel by Frank Miller or of history in general you will love this movie!
I:14626;1667;Gerard Butler fans will be very pleased.
I:14626;1668;great movie to laugh on and have a good time.
I:14626;1669;Great movie, awesome special effects!!
I:14626;1670;"The heroics of the 300 Spartans is one of the truly memorable ""last stand"" in military history."
I:14626;1671;It does not look like other blue ray movies, it dit not look that great as expected, overall the movie is great.
I:14626;1672;Lifted pretty much from the comic book, and there's the rub.
I:14626;1673;Filmed in similar fashion to Sin City but in my view this is a far far better film.
I:14626;1674;Good story, good character's and good acting too.
I:14626;1675;"In a nut shell I highly recommend the movie and enjoyed it a lot more than I expected, lives up to the hype and has the edge over the similar movie ""Troy"" also."
I:14626;1676;The Shipping speed is fast, The Blu ray came completely unopened and the price was great.
I:14626;1677;From beginning to end, I was riveted to my seat.
I:14626;1678;There are a lot of naysayers who complain about historical inaccuracies in the film.
I:14626;1679;This movie is about a real historical event and many of the roles were of real people who participated.
I:14626;1680;a mixture of fact and fiction.
I:14626;1681;And, I got what I was looking for.
I:14626;1682;I was totally immersed in the action when a film.
I:14626;1683;It did take some enjoyment away from the film as I confess to spending some of my time looking for other flubs (Rolex watches, etc.).
I:14626;1684;goer, I'd have rated this film a solid 5.
I:14626;1685;"If you love war movies with alot of blood and action, then I highly recommend ""300."""
I:14626;1686;The intensity of this movie will leave you begging for more as the credits come down.
I:14626;1687;Blue screen utilization results in a wonderfully color grated, artistic presentation.
I:14626;1688;Sly camera work and editing finesse aid to remarkably beautiful scenes fueled by powerful acting.
I:14626;1689;The story is enchanting in a dark way, the characters are immersive and eery.
I:14626;1690;Even more fun that on Showtime/HBO.
I:14626;1691;ray really shines through and the CGI/storyline make it all worthwhile.
I:14626;1692;lasting impact that would last right up to modern times.
I:14626;1693;all that aside, the story as told in the film is a moving one and it meets all the marks.
I:14626;1694;Although visually stunning and filled with action, just about every tenet of National Socialism is covered in this film.
I:14626;1695;It is not historicaly accurate, but is entertaining and fun to watch.
I:14626;1696;Cool story, and great action.
I:14626;1697;Loved every sec of it!
I:14626;1698;Things to remember: Honor is worth more than life.
I:14626;1699;everyone has a part to play, which part is up to you, how you influence others around you can make the difference between a traitor or a supporter.
I:14626;1700;This was a great gift, my son.
I:14626;1701;in law will enjoy watching it, thank you Amazon for making my Christmas shopping easier.
I:14626;1702;Movie is excellent, packed with action and loved the fight scenes.
I:14626;1703;My husband always likes a good action packed thriller and I have to admit there is a part of me that does too.
I:14626;1704;I also thought the visual effects in the movie were interesting and even though parts of it seemed to be over the top I think that is what made the film interesting.
I:14626;1705;Didn't get tracking with this package, but just got it today in the mail!
I:14626;1706;Product is in great condition, and the packaging was great.
I:14626;1707;Thanks so much for selling this item!
I:14626;1708;This one is great, witty and fun, full of action that is not boring or cheesed out.
I:14626;1709;One of the best action film adaptations ever.
I:14626;1710;Excellent casting, plot, cinematography, CGI etc.
I:14626;1711;I highly recommend taking a look at the special features to see what these guys went through to train for the film.
I:14626;1712;they are actually ripped and did their own stunts/fighting.
I:14626;1713;My wife (who normally isn't interested in any kind of gory action flick) was genuinely entertained.
I:14626;1714;Even if the history is exaggerated (that history being hundreds of years of oral history before being captured in print), what an inspiring story.
I:14626;1715;Anyhow the movie was good.
I:14626;1716;visually this moves stunning, truly capturing the comic book, the only problem is that it captures it so much that it forgets that it's a film as well and films are time based, that the audience has to watch and wait for every shot not like in a comic book where you can move thought images giving the comic your passing.
I:14626;1717;But I do have to give credit to the female character in the film.
I:14626;1718;She's actually interesting and well worked, why there no slow shots to give her emotion they actually wrote her lines and situation that have emotional backing behind them.
I:14626;1719;The only reason I give this film 2 stars is because how pretty it is.
I:14626;1720;This is one of the most visually amazing movies I have ever seen.
I:14626;1721;It is a bold action film with minimal plot, but outstanding visual effects and action sequences that keep you gripped to the very end.
I:14626;1722;this is a must see for everyone who loves action and wants to know where the future of action movies is headed.
I:14626;1723;Seeing the original and then watching this update, viewers will immediately see the difference.
I:14626;1724;The first is candy coated and offered to entertain audiences holding a box of popcorn.
I:14626;1725;This movie with it's spectacular visual panorama, violent action scenes and overall dramatic effects, will cause you to hold your breath.
I:14626;1726;Gerard Butler, is impressive as King Leonidas.
I:14626;1727;This film may have originated in comic pages, but it explodes on the silver screen as iconic art.
I:14626;1728;This version is sure to inspire some to visit the site of the heroic last stand, but may also inspire others to delve into the history books.
I:14626;1729;Nevertheless, if you don't mind, these and a few other inaccuracies, the film will astonish you with its movie magic and I predict, will imprint itself as a Classic.
I:14626;1730;I'm sure I could come up with 300 great reasons to own this classic.
I:14626;1731;A great adaptation of a comic story based on one of the world's most historic events.
I:14626;1732;It has hypnotic sights and sounds including a fantastic score.
I:14626;1733;In a year where I couldn't wait for Spidey 3, Transformers, and Pirates 3, it was 300 that soared to the top of my list as best movie of the year.
I:14626;1734;This movie was, a masterful and faithful rendition of that epic battle at the Hot Gates.
I:14626;1735;Some people say that this was not accurate, it was too cartoony, but I say brilliant.
I:14626;1736;Short of the National Geographic specials, this is the best telling of the Battle of Thermopylae.
I:14626;1737;Overall this is a great movie and tells the story of King Leonidas and the battle of Thermopylae.
I:14626;1738;And you get a extra features that are pretty cool.
I:14626;1739;It's just good old fashion mass fighting, with very, very, very muscular men.
I:14626;1740;I thought that this movie was a classic and perfect example of a 'popcorn' flick.
I:14626;1741;It's riveting, gets the senses going and is a true visual feast.
I:14626;1742;Great fun, and easy to watch on repeated viewings.
I:14626;1743;the whole movie was intense and epic in scope.
I:14626;1744;The visuals were incedible and the sound draws you into the movie in a big way.
I:14626;1745;"If you're a person that loves those sword fighting movies like ""Troy"" or ""Gladiator"" then you'll love this movie."
I:14626;1746;"It does have characters of fantasy in it and doesn't try to be a historical film, but I think it adds much to the movie and gives it a ""Lord of the Rings"" feel."
I:14626;1747;any guy should enjoy this film immensely if they like action.
I:14626;1748;"Who are all these whack jobs talking about ""Oh, the historically accurate depiction"", and ""cuts to the core of what is coursing through the veins and psyches of any man in touch with his human soul""?"
I:14626;1749;"assery ever captured on film""."
I:14626;1750;This is just absolutely the ulitmate guy movie and makes you wanna go punch puppies and kick down trees afterwards.
I:14626;1751;Just go see the movie.
I:14626;1752;If you're familiar with the comic book adaptation movie genre, ala Sin City, you'll recognize the same approach in 300.
I:14626;1753;It's a good movie to watch once or twice, but its not one that I'll go back to time and time again.
I:14626;1754;It is a great movie, but instead of the usual 'looking for the non.
I:14626;1755;Those parts were impressive, I must say.
I:14626;1756;so many great quotes and dialogue in this movie.
I:14626;1757;"i love how it engages the audience with what I would call ""male Drama""."
I:14626;1758;Brotherhood, community above self, honor, loyalty, verbal quips and some sarcasm of male humor in really not so funny situations if taken out of context.
I:14626;1759;it's a guy movie all the way.
I:14626;1760;the guys are ripped, so women interested in seeing some buff bods would enjoy.
I:14626;1761;It's a fun movie, great lines, and plenty of super slow.
I:14626;1762;Give it another year and the Blu.
I:14626;1763;hardware wise both are dropping their prices to try to capture the enthusist market, in turn get us to sell it to our friends and family.
I:14626;1764;This has got to be the best movie i've ever seen.
I:14626;1765;The adaptation is great besides de FX and the strength of the actors.
I:14626;1766;Went to watch it when it came out at the movies, its pretty much all action from beginning to end with epic battle sequences.
I:14626;1767;300 is perhaps one of the most enjoyable movies that I've seen.
I:14626;1768;300 is a screen adaptation of a graphic comic and, in that context, it delivers exactly what you would expect.
I:14626;1769;The plot and the charachters are shallow but excellent in their simplicity, as is the everything else about 300.
I:14626;1770;there is a small taste of accuracey to be had in 300 but primarily it is more of a visceral ride than a historical account.
I:14626;1771;Already knowing what the Persians have in mind for him and his people Leonidas is motivated to march 300 of his best to certain death rather than face slavery at the hands of the Persians.
I:14626;1772;"so, with his decision made Leonidas takes 300 of his best men and meets the Persian army at the ""Hot Gates""."
I:14626;1773;But ultimately 300 keeps the focus on Leonidas's force of 300 and thier role.
I:14626;1774;visually, 300 is a beautiful peice of work.
I:14626;1775;Much like the comic the visuals are simplistic and muted with occasional vibrance for effect (primarily this is in the form of the Spartan's crimson uniform and the blood they are spilling).
I:14626;1776;A mixture of film is employed throughout the fight sequences including a fair amount of slow motion and camera closeups.
I:14626;1777;After watching action movies where the action scene assails the viewer with chaos I enjoyed again the simplistic nature of 300's fight scenes.
I:14626;1778;You are up close with the combatant immersed in the smooth choreography and pristine CGI.
I:14626;1779;the sounds and musical score are also appropriate for the theme of the movie (no, I didn't find anything wrong with the guitar riff at the climax of action, it felt appropriate for the movie I was watching).
I:14626;1780;Not realistic, but very appropriate for the film.
I:14626;1781;The script is basic, to the point, and consists primarily of stirring statements that are used to up the pulse of the movie.
I:14626;1782;The actors are in no way pushed to bring anything across as the movie, as a whole, builds everything and as much as the audience is the actors appear to be swept up in it.
I:14626;1783;in the end I can that 300 is a movie that I will certainly add to my collection and one that I will find myself watching a lot in the future when I want some simple entertainment and an action movie that focuses on one thing: ACTION.
I:14626;1784;If you like action please watch this movie.
I:14626;1785;The acting, stunts, and comic like special effect's are awesome.
I:14626;1786;macho graphic novel of the same name, is a huge success.
I:14626;1787;soaked Battle of Thermopylae to the attention of the viewing public.
I:14626;1788;lively art to cinematic life.
I:14626;1789;The Spartans themselves, who laugh madly at danger and welcome glorious death.
I:14626;1790;Noble King Leonidas is the wise Spartan strongman.
I:14626;1791;"In an objective case of the aphorism ""less is more,"" the film oversaturates us with fighting, noble manliness, dehumanized enemies and treacherous friends."
I:14626;1792;"It often comes ""this close"" to becoming a self."
I:14626;1793;that said, many of the film's artistic touches were wonderful.
I:14626;1794;It's from these ironies that many an academic thesis is built!
I:14626;1795;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:14626;1796;A small band of brave men struggle against enormous odds, battling a superior force, and though ultimately they are defeated their sacrifice becomes a source of inspiration and hope that rings out like a clarion call through the pages of history.
I:14626;1797;To make it a fair fight, Mike enlisted the help of battle veterans Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy.
I:14626;1798;300 is a movie based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller published by Dark Horse comics in 1998.
I:14626;1799;This a historic battle depicted as a comic book with Hollywood moxy and juiced with testosterone and a shot of pure adrenaline.
I:14626;1800;This CG stylized action flick is full of with quick witted dialog and epic battle scenes that will please the carnal beast hidden in every man, (and some women.)
I:14626;1801;One of the things that was surprising to me was the acting in it is quite good.
I:14626;1802;It has it's heart felt moments that added depth and emotion to the story without being sappy or heavy handed.
I:14626;1803;The dialog was very true to the original graphic novel as well as many shots in the movie were pulled right from Frank Miller's comic page.
I:14626;1804;This movie honors the spirit of Miller's book much like Sin City did, and is a true testament to the respect that Frank Miller is given to his master works from Hollywood Producers and Directors.
I:14626;1805;Zach showed great skill and pulled out all the stops and new tricks in digital film making.
I:14626;1806;The look of the movie was vivacious, visceral and visually appetizing, much like the graphic novel.
I:14626;1807;This film is more like Lord of the Rings than Braveheart, so make sure you know what your about to watch.
I:14626;1808;King Leonidas is played by Gerard Butler (who played opposite Christian Bale and Mathew McConaughey in 2002's Reign of Fire) now proved that not only can he hold the screen in a leading role but he can do it with intensity and charisma.
I:14626;1809;"He transformed himself into this character for this role and knows when to play it soft or blow your pansy little socks off by roaring ""This."
I:14626;1810;The other notable performances were by the Queen of Sparta played by the ravishing Lena Headey.
I:14626;1811;the other members of the supporting cast holds up and add many dynamic characters and personalities to the movie.
I:14626;1812;This movie hold up as one of the best of the early films of 2007.
I:14626;1813;It's one of those movies that is just a blast to see on the big screen and just escape into.
I:14626;1814;All in all it's a very strong film that I must go see a second time.
I:14626;1815;"I find it funny how people sit here and type pages about a movie taken from a comic book or ""graphic novel"" and expect it to be a perfect representation of the battle of Thermopylae."
I:14626;1816;pack abs and all the women were sexy and beautiful.
I:14626;1817;The Spartan ideal of the best way to die is in battle so your name will live on in glory.
I:14626;1818;Freedom is worth any sacrifice.
I:14626;1819;"Great movies like ""Henry V"", ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" and ""Braveheart"" use the same themes."
I:14626;1820;the movie delivers just what you expect from the previews.
I:14626;1821;"I thought ""Sin City"" a better movie, but I had fun watching 300 and it in some ways exceeded my expectations."
I:14626;1822;"This is an incredible movie, and the Hi Def is stunning shown on my 42"" Sharp Aquos."
I:14626;1823;Not only that, but this movie has a great story!
I:14626;1824;I watched it twice back to back it was that good.
I:14626;1825;This is a very good action movie, it does stray from the historical points of the battle at Thermoplae, but over all very well made film.
I:14626;1826;It has all the elements of a summer movie.
I:14626;1827;And may I point out the oddly warm conditions of the majority of America.
I:14626;1828;it certainly took advantage of the droves of people suffering from cabin fever.
I:14626;1829;And what a ride 300 presents to our sun starved eyes.
I:14626;1830;often times movies as these reflect the times.
I:14626;1831;Good ol' raiders of the ark kinda movie.
I:14626;1832;But fun all the way.
I:14626;1833;Frank Miller's stylish piece of a graphic novel gets an equally stylish treatment on screen.
I:14626;1834;"Lets start with the photography
I:14626;1835;The slightly washed out color gives it that look of an ancient time and place.
I:14626;1836;With so much emphasis placed on the beauty of the scenery as well as the tactical nature of the battles, you loose yourself in the movie.
I:14626;1837;It's impressive stuff, especially when you see the tactics actually being used so effectively during long camera shots of these Spartans trouncing their enemies even though they are outnumbered.
I:14626;1838;as I said, the plot may be based in history, but the dramatic license takes it way out of the factual environment and puts it in the realm of fantasy.
I:14626;1839;The relationship between King and Queen, the proud nature of the Spartans and their resistance to being conquered.
I:14626;1840;Butler gives a powerfully over the top performance and pulls it off without a hitch.
I:14626;1841;gerard butler is outstanding in this film.
I:14626;1842;the entire cast is exceptional.
I:14626;1843;I don't care about such things, personally, but it was a gift and some people like their cases to match.
I:14626;1844;Great action packed movie, with historical reference.
I:14626;1845;I got bored for a couple of minutes but the action is great.
I:14626;1846;the acting and the dialog could have been better though but the transformation of the actors in this movie was quite amazing.
I:14626;1847;Gerard Butler appearance in this movie reflected how hard he must have worked to transform himself.
I:14626;1848;The underrated Stephen McHattie was great as the loyalist who helps the queen gain access to the Council.
I:14626;1849;As such, and as the countless movies made based on battles, you will see exaggerations.
I:14626;1850;Other than that what can I say this movie was great!
I:14626;1851;Mr. Snyder did an excellent job.
I:14626;1852;mr. Butler is an excellent actor and one of the few who can convey emotion through his eyes.
I:14626;1853;i saw this movie three times with my husband and we both enjoyed it immensely all three times.
I:14626;1854;It is entertainment and should be taken as such.
I:14626;1855;A queen, a king, some god, and a lot of people who fight.
I:14626;1856;I know honey, you prefer us to beat each other up and have our own blood bath, and I know it's worse to ask this, but can we have sex?
I:14626;1857;I go to work, fairly clean place, and yet I come home from the factory with dust, yet all these people fight and no blood.
I:14626;1858;This has been the least impressive BRD acquisition for myself, so far.
I:14626;1859;Snyder is great, and I'm looking forward to Watchmen.
I:14626;1860;This movie has a very stylized look going on, so don't panic when you see the grain.
I:14626;1861;best movie line of 2006.
I:14626;1862;300 is bound to take its place as one of the great movies of all time.
I:14626;1863;Every frame is a work of unforgettable art.
I:14626;1864;He doesn't just act it, he looks incredibly heroic, as does the rest of this extraordinary cast.
I:14626;1865;You become enmeshed in the thrilling story.
I:14626;1866;How this movie was made, its origins and its eventual fruition into this masterpiece would make a wonderful coffee table book.
I:14626;1867;"I've added this movie to my collection of masterpieces and it sits right there with ""Gone With the Wind,"" ""Dr. Zhivago"" and ""Metropolis"" as among the filmic masterpieces of all time."
I:14626;1868;One of my most favorite movies.
I:14626;1869;"Sure it's a little gorey, but it has FANTASTIC special effects and awesome screenplay with music to match!A definite ""must see"" for action lovers!"
I:14626;1870;Just an amazing movie and even better on Blu.
I:14626;1871;Highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes this style of film.
I:14626;1872;down, one of the best collector's editions I've seen!
I:14626;1873;The value/buck here is incredible!
I:14626;1874;As a history buff, I enjoyed the dramatization of an infamous battle between ancient cultures.
I:14626;1875;They loved their families, their land (property), and freedom.
I:14626;1876;For these reasons I felt 300 was a politically conservative movie.
I:14626;1877;"I prefer the term: ""freedom."
I:14626;1878;"loving"", I think it is more appropriate."
I:14626;1879;In the biblical book of Esther, Xerxes prays to God, praises God's wisdom and submits to God's sovereignty.
I:14626;1880;The movie portrays Xerxes as a king styled like pre.
I:14626;1881;"This adaptation of Frank Miller's depiction of the Battle of Thermopalye is guaranteed to get your heart pumping with its stirring battle scenes and talk of ""Freedom""."
I:14626;1882;For you historians, some winking and nodding must be done to Miller's version, but it is still a a lot of fun.
I:14626;1883;Contrary to what the queen says, you will enjoy this!
I:14626;1884;With all the gushing blood of a horror movie and the scope of a classic epic, the second film from Zack Snyder (who helmed the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead) is an impressive visual spectacle.
I:14626;1885;strong army against Xerxes's army of millions.
I:14626;1886;Though there are scenes that demonstrate the humanity of the characters, 300 is undeniably about bravery and blood, and it succeeds because of the stylish depictions of both.
I:14626;1887;300 is one of my all time favorite movies!
I:14626;1888;It's a great story with great actors and wonderful costumes.
I:14626;1889;I love seeing hot guys fight and that's the primary goal in this film.
I:14626;1890;It's also very interesting with the mythical creatures and all.
I:14626;1891;Nice spin of a true historic event.
I:14626;1892;There have been more than a few movies about this battle, but this one is the best of all.
I:14626;1893;and this film does it justice, with great action sequences, unbelievable graphical imaging, and dialogue that definitely holds your interest.
I:14626;1894;Exciting yet sensationalized battle scenes.
I:14626;1895;More like a dream sequence than a depiction of an actual battle.
I:14626;1896;The film is more of a fantasy than Gladiator or Brave Heart.
I:14626;1897;It does have scenes that seem like they came right from both films though.
I:14626;1898;For instance the very end is exactly like the end of Brave Heart and like Gladiator you have those dream like sequences of fields with people walking in them with wind blowing in their hair.
I:14626;1899;offs from other movies this film works great on it's own.
I:14626;1900;It's exciting and super cool and hard to keep your eyes off it even when heads are flying around.
I:14626;1901;Plus even if Butler channels Crowe's performance from Gladiator it's still an impressivle performance.
I:14626;1902;movie, Sin City, the packaging alone is worth it.
I:14626;1903;"i liked the original film ""300 Spartans"" much better."
I:14626;1904;All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.
I:14626;1905;i'm sure my Uncle Randolph felt that way as a paratrooper in World War II as he watched Japanese soldiers jump to their deaths to avoid capture.
I:14626;1906;My 5th Great Grandfather Robert in the Revolutionary War.
I:14626;1907;That sometimes pivotal events take place, and we can act.
I:14626;1908;The East has never successfully invaded the West.
I:14626;1909;The movie is basically shot scene for scene based on the graphic novel, and all of the backgrounds are done on blue screen.
I:14626;1910;unlike Spiderman, which had some of the worst transitions I've ever seen, this movie is so visually stunning you are compelled to watch every scene.
I:14626;1911;the actors are captivating as one facial expression says more than an entire monologue.
I:14626;1912;The one liners are excellent and add a comic element to what is often a serious moment.
I:14626;1913;lena Heady as the Spartan queen is as beatiful as she is strong, and Gerard Butler plays a handsome Leonidas who needs few words as his expressions say it all.
I:14626;1914;One thing I did find striking was the bold differences between good and evil, between the Spartans and the Persians, and this is a story of good versus evil.
I:14626;1915;to be honest, even though I thought the telling of this story would be superficial, I still wanted to see it.
I:14626;1916;What I found instead is a movie where it's so visually stunning, with acting that's well done, and every element in the movie contributes to a fair, accurate, and deep story telling of a serious subject for a movie.
I:14626;1917;this is movie making at its best, and I hope Hollywood will take note.
I:14626;1918;Although graphic at times, the graphic sexual and violent elements contribute in a meaningful way to the overall telling of the story.
I:14626;1919;This time, it's being told on a deeper, richer, and more meaningful level.
I:14626;1920;i recommend this movie is for anyone who understands the high price of freedom and knows it must be paid.
I:14626;1921;For those who don't get it, like the story of Huckleberry Finn, it can still be enjoyed as just another larger than life story and a truly great movie.
I:14626;1922;I saw this movie in the theater and it was great !
I:14626;1923;Zack Snyder directs this faithful adaptation of Frank Miller's (Sin City) graphic novel about the storied Battle of Thermopylae, a conflict that pitted the ancient Greeks against the Persians in 480 B. c.
I:14626;1924;The actual movie deserves a 5/5!
I:14626;1925;Great movie, got it for my husband.
I:14626;1926;Not sure we will use the BD live feature.
I:14626;1927;"This is a Great source material for a ""R"" rated game software."
I:14626;1928;rays I have, this is definitely one of the best looking.
I:14626;1929;Sorry I expected this to be the best looking thing on my bravia.
I:14626;1930;Based off the amazing graphic novel of the same name, this movie does a tremendous job of bringing all of the intense action of the story to life.
I:14626;1931;All the characters and acting are over the top, but that's part of what makes this movie so much fun to watch!
I:14626;1932;And it looks amazing on blu ray!
I:14626;1933;butler is amazing leonidas, and watching him speak thru the underbite that makes his lip curl in the sexiest way ever, was more than worth the entry fee.
I:14626;1934;rest of the cast also pretty good, with exception of a few exaggerations, like the guy playing xerxes.
I:14626;1935;music went well with the film, directing was commendable, battle scenes amazingly well done (matrix in sparta :)), both in terms of choreography and directing.
I:14626;1936;dOP did an amazing job, and it is he whose contribution is most visible.
I:14626;1937;It was so much more everywhere else (about 15.00 more!)
I:14626;1938;It was delivered in 3 days and in perfect condition.
I:14626;1939;You're great Amazon, thanks a million!!
I:14626;1940;I saw this movie at the theatre and absolutely loved it.
I:14626;1941;It is definitely a guys movie.
I:14626;1942;Heck, pretty much every woman in the movie shows her breasts.
I:14626;1943;the movie is one of the best, the blu.
I:14626;1944;This movie is one of the greatest of all time!
I:14626;1945;I loved the movie so freakin much, I returned the special edition 2 disc set so I could have THIS ONE!
I:14626;1946;The more 300 I can get .
I:14626;1947;I saw the movie in the theatre on opening night and the picture was clearer on my screen at home.
I:14626;1948;the effects, though artsy are incredible!The acting is solid, they manage to put enough comedy into the film to keep it light, and though this doesn't add any points to the film, this is best watched without thinking about anything.
I:14626;1949;but it's a fun movie, start to finish and absolutely entertaining.
I:14626;1950;This is a great remake of 300 Spartans.
I:14626;1951;The original was really great, but this version has the special effects and lots of violence.
I:14626;1952;This is a great story yet a bit graphic.
I:14626;1953;Really loved this movie and a great addition for collectors.
I:14626;1954;It was an enjoyable film because there were excellent battle scenes between the Spartans and the hordes of Persians.
I:14626;1955;I love movies like Braveheart that have huge battle scenes between historic armies.
I:14626;1956;as for the historical accuracy, even the well.
I:14626;1957;Still, the action was great.
I:14626;1958;The perfect mix of blood, violence, and Gerard Butler!
I:14626;1959;one of the greatest action movies ever made.
I:14626;1960;I know many people that are Persian, and they are all very nice family oriented people.
I:14626;1961;I love this movie and on blu.
I:14626;1962;ray it is even better.
I:14626;1963;Item received as ordered and within time promised.
I:14626;1964;Movie is highly recommended, great acting, great scenery you will not be disappointed.
I:14626;1965;I figured the price was to good to be true.
I:14626;1966;And moviemaking with a cutting edge.
I:14626;1967;"The movie ""Gladiator"" was flawed but was vastly superior and far more enjoyable than this flick."
I:14626;1968;I was pleased that they got the Spartan training right, yet what was up with this film?
I:14626;1969;Am I watching the re.
I:14626;1970;The real story of the Battle of Thermopylae is one of the greatest from the ancient world, with real characters that still inspire people to this day.
I:14626;1971;The art will hold your interest.
I:14626;1972;Good looking women are a reward.
I:14626;1973;"in the epic, graphic masterpiece ""300""."
I:14626;1974;can draw from the well of battle history in order to remain a true fighting unit under one commander.
I:14626;1975;It struck a chord throughout the world, echoing universal themes that are held dear.
I:14626;1976;Seen it many times and I can't get tired of it.
I:14626;1977;The rest of it was spectacular.
I:14626;1978;They make this movie great.
I:14626;1979;Took way to long to upload the movie which waisted my time and money but the movie 300 is a great movie
I:14626;1980;All I can say is thank you to both men for having the courage and excellent artistic craft for telling such a spellbinding tale about free men battling against an evil empire inspite of impossible odds.
I:14626;1981;300 is one of the most realistic films I have seen depicting Ancient Greek civilization, especially in its successful effort at humanizing the valiant, war.
I:14626;1982;"The cast is superb, with Gerard Butler as a memorable King Leonidas and David Wenham as Dilios (He's probably best known for his portrayal of Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.)"
I:14626;1983;This is one of the finest war movies I have ever seen, which not only shows the horrors of war, but more importantly, explains why it is necessary sometimes to fight .
I:14626;1984;which is depicted realistically .
I:14626;1985;"a brilliant and unique action epic based on a graphic novel by the creator of ""Sin City"" Frank Miller brings a big screen piece of historical fiction in a glorious way."
I:14626;1986;"Zack Snyder (of ""Dawn of the Dead 2004"" fame) faithfully brings the instant classic graphic novel to life thanks to excellect diretion, good acting and tons of spectacular visual effects mixing the film in live."
I:14626;1987;It rocks your senses with awesome non.
I:14626;1988;stop action and gore galore and epic battle sequences that even rival's LOTR's action sequences, totally one of 2007's best movies and a mesmerizing movie you'll never forget.
I:14626;1989;"The effects are great
I:14626;1990;I thought it was great!
I:14626;1991;This was a gift for my son.
I:14626;1992;i havent seen him so pleased since he got his first electric train.
I:14626;1993;This is of course a reenactment of an actual event in history however a bit over done in special effects to suit my taste but all in all an excellent film.
I:14626;1994;true stories are what I enjoy most, dramas or reenactments or even documentary type presentations appeal to me most.
I:14626;1995;I want a great movie, period.
I:14626;1996;That is what I received in the Blu Ray version.
I:14626;1997;the movie looks great and its one of many that have brought my attention and its and amazing movie .
I:14626;1998;Oh I've never seen so many specimens of manhood bound up in one movie.
I:14626;1999;During the battle scenes I enjoy pulling on my nipple rings and bending myself over the coffee table for a spanking.
I:14626;2000;Xerxes was a fine fine girly man.
I:14626;2001;In fact I'm curious now to see how long it will take XBOX to release a 300 game.
I:14626;2002;King Leonidas has a spear, a shield, muscles, and a penis.
I:14626;2003;But the actor forgot that he actually had to act to make a convincing hero.
I:14626;2004;And his face on the box cover is just so intimidating and heroic.
I:14626;2005;the action is actually decent, but then we have the incredibly important political sub.
I:14626;2006;The sex scene was also absolutely essential to the plot.
I:14626;2007;I was happy when the Spartans finally died.
I:14626;2008;For people that enjoy the action, I can understand that, but the people that think it's epic and a great story with excellent plot, what is wrong?Since when is this garbage an excellent movie?
I:14626;2009;I give this 5 stars for artistic achievement.
I:14626;2010;this movie translates the artistic style of a comic (story board) successfully to the screen.
I:14626;2011;This becomes a master class in scene composition.
I:14626;2012;This movie is truly epic!
I:14626;2013;From story, to visuals, to acting, and sheer scale, there is no better word than epic!
I:14626;2014;"The movie is shot beautifully
I:14626;2015;300 is a masterpiece work, flawless in execution.
I:14626;2016;The story is tight and well paced, perfectly balancing a drama that shows a human side to the characters, mixed with a little political intrigue, and an intense action flick!
I:14626;2017;It has so many extras you will want to watch it again and again.
I:14626;2018;But overall good movie, done well and worth the time.
I:14626;2019;Greek legend and myth come alive on screen in Frank Miller's adapted graphic novel 300.
I:14626;2020;the body count is high,heads,limbs and appentages alike fly about and the graphic blood and gore is surely to meet all adrenaline/testosterone junkie's expectations out there combined with fantastical story telling, incredible action along with top notch visual effects intermixed with art and design.
I:14626;2021;i would hope that 300 becomes a contender for next years Oscars,the content of this film and the ammount of work and effort put into it to bring to the screen certainly earns 300 a close look and considerible consideration.
I:14626;2022;brought about the first lasting democracy.
I:14626;2023;Excellent mix of acting and state.
I:14626;2024;Highly recommend it, and am looking forward to seeing the sequel showing in theaters today.
I:14626;2025;one of the greatest movies i have ever seen, i would like to take this time to say if anyone has not seen this movie, id recommend it, especially in blue.
I:14626;2026;ray version is pretty much crippled in terms of extra features.
I:14626;2027;picture Version (the raw footage as shot) with commentary.
I:14626;2028;I'll be very, very, very much more simple like them: 300 deserves five stars, even a sixth, because it's an spectacular MOVIE.
I:14626;2029;It's more than obvious that the production is one of the best.
I:14626;2030;300 is a great piece in any movie collection.
I:14626;2031;This special edition has very interesting features.
I:14626;2032;The interviews are really good, so as the pictures, the box.
I:14626;2033;This remarkable and inspirational film is a literal tranlatrion from a visual novel or comic book format novel based on the famous stand of Leonidas King of Sparta and his small army of volunteers at the pass of Thermopyle.
I:14626;2034;As in the original artwork, non.
I:14626;2035;important details of background, character and plot and even of situation, are eliminated, and this elimination of detail allows us to focus all our attention on the power of the story.
I:14626;2036;"And, it becmes all the more powerful because the story is true
I:14626;2037;"That kind of magnificence fiits the Greek tradition which says that proud nakedness is a sign of courage
I:14626;2038;Although it was made three or four decades ago, it was a well made Hollywood technicolor film and is an excellent and realistic re.
I:14626;2039;"But, nothing described by anybody here can adequately convey the power of the story
I:14626;2040;It is a celebration: At a time of so many ignoble compromises, a triumph.
I:14626;2041;interpretations more reliable for a comic book.
I:14626;2042;300 is the best movie for me of this year.
I:14626;2043;minded, and the whole enterprise felt like a video game.
I:14626;2044;This is a good movie.
I:14626;2045;It has a lot of action.
I:14626;2046;Disappointing portrayal of an important historical milestone.
I:14626;2047;Looks great, the blue/green screen and extras were actually worth taking the time to watch.
I:14626;2048;One of the best action movies that I've ever seen.
I:14626;2049;Battle scenes are some of the best out there.
I:14626;2050;Although there wasnt CGI in ancient times, it makes for a lot of fun battles.
I:14626;2051;Even though a few will gripe about the grain effect in the picture, this movie is visually stunning, and the sound is made to be pumped loud.
I:14626;2052;As for the movie, it's a great action packed film designed to do just what it does visually suck you in.
I:14626;2053;certainly everyone has realized that by now.
I:14626;2054;This film is extremely stylistic, with a heavy use of green screen to simulate dramatic lighting and employ heavy amounts of CGI (there are plenty of ridiculous CGI blood splatters that simply vanish into thin air).
I:14626;2055;And yet, as much as I want to laugh at it and dismiss it as stupid fun (which is easily done with the sequel, Rise of an Empire), this is actually an excellent film with some amount of depth to it.
I:14626;2056;no, King Leonidas probably didn't fight a giant CGI wolf as a boy, but this film is extremely successful in conveying the mindset of the ancients.
I:14626;2057;their perceptions of an enemy, their need for honor and glory, their dedication to their nations, their struggle to understand the world around them, and their devotion to camaraderie and brotherhood.
I:14626;2058;The style used in this film helps, rather than hinders, the conveyance of an ancient Spartan worldview.
I:14626;2059;that the movie managed to convey these themes while being entertaining, quotable, heavily stylized, and overall cheesily awesome is what makes it a success.
I:14626;2060;I loved the art direction and style of Sin City so this was a no brainer.
I:14626;2061;Even after watching the latest summer blockbusters of 2007 (ie.
I:14626;2062;Most people enjoyed this movie and recommend it.
I:14626;2063;Special effects and battle scenes are cartoon style.
I:14626;2064;"to his few good men, and we kindly replies ""That's cool Spartan, but you're in a video game!"""
I:14626;2065;300 is one of the most anticipated films of 2007.
I:14626;2066;He manages to recruit 300 of his finest warriors to battle against a million.
I:14626;2067;He says good bye to his beautiful wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) and his young son.
I:14626;2068;review:In the technical department, 300 will probably please most of its younger audience.
I:14626;2069;"like environment where the story takes place gives us the ""look and feel"" of the epic graphic novel."
I:14626;2070;something that fans will probably enjoy.
I:14626;2071;The battle scenes are intense and well choreographed with plenty of slow motion, computer gore and eye candy landscapes.
I:14626;2072;It is all about the action and the CGI cinematography.
I:14626;2073;All in all I felt like I was watching a comic strip on film.
I:14626;2074;ray provides an awesome viewing experience.
I:14626;2075;it is definitely in that special group of movies that benefit tremendously from Blue.
I:14626;2076;I thought I was in for some decent historical non.
I:14626;2077;A movie like 300 is a must for High Definition players.
I:14626;2078;The movie is stylistically wonderful.
I:14626;2079;Cinematography in this movie is spectacular and innovative.
I:14626;2080;One of my top 10 favorite movies I own.
I:14626;2081;This version was taken from the comic series but captures the valor of the Spartans.
I:14626;2082;Xeres and his massive army are formidable which make the bravery and skill of the Sparatans even more memorable.
I:14626;2083;I wanted visual excitement, it's what I got.
I:14626;2084;Overall, I liked the movie and I thought the cinematography and stylistic visuals were great.
I:14626;2085;"Lots of fantastic action scenes
I:14626;2086;To tell you honestly saw the movie thrice and actually enjoyed it, not for its historical accuracy, but for its brazen retelling of the battle at Thermopylae: a brave new world in film making.
I:14626;2087;Awesome graphic effects, outrageous costumes, cool battle scenes choreography, etc. never, never a dull moment!
I:14626;2088;They look convincing in this movie.
I:14626;2089;Part Yul Bryner, part drag queen.
I:14626;2090;Caught in the battle, perhaps?Having said all these, I will still give this movie 5 stars and congratulate Frank Miller and Zack Snyder for a job well done.
I:14626;2091;Remember famous stories made into Disney movies: talking gargoyles, singing teacups, etc?
I:14626;2092;though not an outstanding film, 300 delivers a visual feast of coolness and beauty.
I:14626;2093;The extras are okay, they give you a broader picture of the production and a little bit of facts and legend about the spartans, pretty cool!
I:14626;2094;There's also a strategy game where you play the role of Leonidas.
I:14626;2095;Gerard Butler, in one of his greatest movies, he also plays in Law Abiding Citizen which is a good movie too.
I:14626;2096;the best movie based on a comic.
I:14626;2097;full of action and epic battles, color and sound spectacular and sublime music.
I:14626;2098;This is one of the movies you must have.
I:14626;2099;full of adrenaline and inspirational.
I:14626;2100;The 300's courage of death in the name of freedom is remembered for all time.
I:14626;2101;The animation is top notch in this movie and to the people who complain about the graininess of the picture it is this way in the theater.
I:14626;2102;this movie is pure action at its best.
I:14626;2103;There were plenty of them, that's for sure.
I:14626;2104;"Somewhere between Gerald Butler sputtering inspirational lines and endless bloody battles, Zack Snyder's adaption of Frank Miller's graphic novel happened to cross the line and not only beat ""Troy"" for the spot as the best epic war movie, but also beat ""The Matrix"" movies and take the gold as the best action movie ever made."
I:14626;2105;"While the action sequences seem original with their bloody slow motion swordplay and a red sky, they are actually expansions on what we saw in ""The Matrix"" films."
I:14626;2106;"Yet in a way the battle sequences seem so original, maybe because we've not seen stuff like this in recent epic movies like ""Troy"", ""Gladiator"", or ""King Athur""."
I:14626;2107;"In the end, the world saw a complete masterpiece from Zack Snyder, who directed the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake."
I:14626;2108;As an added bonus to the spectacular motion picture, Warner Bros. has included a wonderful two.
I:14626;2109;On the first disc, Snyder has a sole yet very informative commentary.
I:14626;2110;On disc two, there are many great making.
I:14626;2111;Astoundingly visually stunning in it's entirety and completely surreal with every last scene of beauty accentuated by a 50ft IMAX screen.
I:14626;2112;This film, done with the magic of the green screen, was created to bring to life the infamous Frank Miller graphic novel, not to illustrate a point in history.
I:14626;2113;Powerful acting and as far as the battle scenes go, positively some of the most intense and detailed war scenes I have ever seen.
I:14626;2114;It is a wonderful .
I:14626;2115;better at home than theater.
I:14626;2116;Because I am a woman and found thetheater a bit public for this film.
I:14626;2117;this will be a classic film.
I:14626;2118;Awesome portrayal of battle tacticts that were invented and proven to be the best by the Spartan's.
I:14626;2119;Zack Snyder is a great director proven through this movie.
I:14626;2120;From the slow/still screen movements speed up to real time is a fantastic way of special effects for this movie.
I:14626;2121;Very entertaining and full of fun sound bites.
I:14626;2122;Visually, it's a gorgeous movie, as is standard with Zack Snyder.
I:14626;2123;It's always good to view a movie with love and honor.
I:14626;2124;I loved the movie 300.
I:14626;2125;Even more than I loved the graphic novel on which it's based.
I:14626;2126;What I do know is that the movie follows the graphic novel pretty much word for word (except for the business with the queen)and it's a kick.
I:14626;2127;butt graphic novel and a truly breathtaking work of art, not to mention one of the best times I've had at the theatre this year.
I:14626;2128;For some reason, when this movie is played, there is a grain pattern throughout the whole picture.
I:14626;2129;I watched this in the Theater and it was a great movie to watch.
I:14626;2130;Very Reasonable price for that.
I:14626;2131;i just have to laugh at the Blu.
I:14626;2132;s. Watched Transformers today, MUST SEE, it was great.
I:14626;2133;ray version because the entire movie is digital anyways, so it didnt really make a difference.
I:14626;2134;I've been a BIG fan of this movie ever since it hit theaters, and as soon as the 2.
I:14626;2135;but I'll always have to wonder what exactly it is that I paid for.
I:14626;2136;Everything they give you could have fit easily onto a single disc.
I:14626;2137;depth look at how the unique and often stunning visuals in this movie were created.
I:14626;2138;I was eager to see some of the scenes before computer effects were added, and to watch more in.
I:14626;2139;depth interviews with the cast and crew about the process of putting together this highly entertaining film.
I:14626;2140;Not only are they fantastic to watch on their own, but I believe they're the main reason this film was so successful.
I:14626;2141;But who cares, it's great fun over and over again.
I:14626;2142;Excellent performances by all cast members.
I:14626;2143;Great show of Courage and love.
I:14626;2144;It was a great gift idea for my boyfriend!
I:14626;2145;A true dissapointment to me.
I:14626;2146;one of the best photography and graphics created.
I:14626;2147;Best movie and top of my list.
I:14626;2148;As far as the stylized action goes, the computer.
I:14626;2149;generated blood looks cool as swords impact flesh, but every drop of blood dissapears before it reaches the edge of the screen .
I:14626;2150;Good storyline graphics and costume design made u feel like you were at the battlescenes.
I:14626;2151;MOVIE: The name Frank Miller has become rather well known over the past few years to a wider audience.
I:14626;2152;The result was a gritty film noir tale that utilized its style to create vivid and entertaining movie.
I:14626;2153;What they did was in fact take the graphic novel and stick into a movie and I can say right here that the visual style is amazing.
I:14626;2154;So, did Snyder make a good film with 300?
I:14626;2155;The tale is known to all, 300 Spartan soldiers take on one million of the Persian empire in order to defend their nation.
I:14626;2156;The film is not emotionally engrossing or exciting because we don't care about these characters.
I:14626;2157;The movie is one crowning achievement in visual style, but for what purpose?The only commercial appeal this movie has is its visual style, which sole credit goes to Frank Miller and Frank Miller alone.
I:14626;2158;He even resorts to pure rock and roll at certain points in the film.
I:14626;2159;There was a lot of Black Hawk Down in that score and a lot of Harry Gregson.
I:14626;2160;aCTING: The film boasts a relatively unknown cast.
I:14626;2161;David Wenham is probably the most recognizable since he played Faramir in Return Of The King.
I:14626;2162;Gerard Butler plays the king of Sparta and he does have a strong presence.
I:14626;2163;Even though the movie is all shouting he does a good job as the anchor of it all.
I:14626;2164;He is from Scotland so at times I felt like I was listening to a young Sean Connery, but I liked him in the role.
I:14626;2165;Zack Snyder has proven he can make something look good with a computer, but he hasn't proven that he is a good filmmaker yet.
I:14626;2166;A must see movie great!
I:14626;2167;The story itself is based on the Frank Miller graphic novel of the same name and it stays more true to that than history of course.
I:14626;2168;In fact, it is a very dedicated adaptation of Frank Miller's work.
I:14626;2169;The battle is perhaps the most famous last stand in history.300 really is an astounding production.
I:14626;2170;Considering a budget of $60 million, the film looks amazing even though teetering on over.
I:14626;2171;sized animals puts the movie in such a unique frame that it almost gets away with all of the cliches.
I:14626;2172;It gives you everything you want in a blood soaked action epic.
I:14626;2173;Gerard Butler, who plays Leonidas, is actually very good in his role, while at the same time he carries a presence worthy of his character and all of his men who inevitably die beside him.
I:14626;2174;this is a unique film with a visual style that will make it unforgettable.
I:14626;2175;This is the best example of CGI, I've ever seen.
I:14626;2176;The historical interest of the film, is fascinating.
I:14626;2177;The way in which scenes are filmed are incredible.
I:14626;2178;The 2nd disc, is worth watching.
I:14626;2179;This is one of the few perfect movies in existance.
I:14626;2180;This movie is simply amazing in every aspect.
I:14626;2181;The directing is beautiful along with the visulas.
I:14626;2182;The acting is great, the FX are great.
I:14626;2183;And knowing what this battle did for us in reality just makes me love the movie even more.
I:14626;2184;And it's a great guy movie.
I:14626;2185;First off, I think this is one of the greatest films ever made.
I:14626;2186;Braveheart had a pretty good indepth documentary about Wallace history and explain the freedoms they took with his history and why right on the same disc with the movie.
I:14626;2187;I think for some of those who want the history, 300 will jump start their interest.
I:14626;2188;I knew the story prior to seeing the movie, but it didnt make the movie wack.
I:14626;2189;the movie was super creative, visual, and to the point.
I:14626;2190;The plot did not seem drawn out and it was perfectly filled with action.
I:14626;2191;I hope we can expect more creative films like this.
I:14626;2192;It's always good to see people trying new ways of telling stories.
I:14626;2193;I think this movies deserves a 5 simply because it is a movie you will watch again and again with family and freinds.
I:14626;2194;Book came in great condition, price was amazing.
I:14626;2195;High action film based on the Frank Miller graphic novel starring Gerard Butler.
I:14626;2196;This is a great movie especially if you enjoy action movies in the style of Gladiator or Lord of the Rings.
I:14626;2197;It is a cinematic interpretation of a Frank Miller graphic novel and right now Frank Miller movies are on a roll.
I:14626;2198;If you didn't get a chance to catch this movie in theatres you are in for a real treat.
I:14626;2199;Oh yeah, we may be a violent species, as one eloquent reviewer put it, we are also a sexual one.
I:14626;2200;In an age where we are brainwashed into thinking out of shape women can parade in public in bikinis and men, even specimens like David Beckham, has to be covered up in veils, this movie is a breath of fresh air.
I:14626;2201;Great motivational clips for teams.
I:14626;2202;Of course its full of noble words about high ideals.
I:14626;2203;A full package of behind.
I:14626;2204;scenes documentaries, interviews, games, downloads, and super cool blue.
I:14626;2205;The story is told from the Frank Miller graphic novel and with this approach (Hulk movie tried this with just a sliver) is able to really bring a lot of epic scenes to life.
I:14626;2206;Regardless of what is happening throughout the film, it is splendid and fun.
I:14626;2207;Overall a fantastic theater experience and I do not regret attending this film.
I:14626;2208;The PQ of this movie is far superior to Blu.
I:14626;2209;ray, along with the added extra features that Blu.
I:14626;2210;This film has style, heroic characters and a gripping narrative.
I:14626;2211;The music, actors, writing and visuals are such so engrossing.
I:14626;2212;Pretty accurate as far as historical details including some lines which were actually spoken, eg.
I:14626;2213;First time I watched I was glued to the screen and watched it again the next day.
I:14626;2214;"The movie ""300"" is obviously an embellished tale, but it was told so well in this motion picture that it makes for excellent fiction in an historical setting."
I:14626;2215;the best features for me where the perfect coloring and lighting, the action and stunts, the story and plot, and the great acting performances.
I:14626;2216;I just don't think it could have been done better, and I think it is as good as the best films out there right now.
I:14626;2217;They are so vivid and imaginative.
I:14626;2218;"I found myself thinking, ""those colors are really cool."""
I:14626;2219;This is just great work.
I:14626;2220;second, the action and stunts are quite fabulous and should excite anybody who liked The Matrix, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, or similar action movies.
I:14626;2221;While 300 doesn't quite compare with The Matrix in terms of overall mastery of action sequences, like I said, its scenes should still excite action fans nonetheless.
I:14626;2222;This, of course, accentuates the action sequences and plot.
I:14626;2223;Both are great for the most part, but we see some very minor glitches.
I:14626;2224;god, provokes the pride of Sparta's king by giving him the simple choice: give me what I want or be destroyed.
I:14626;2225;"In great fashion, the Spartan king says ""up yours,"" in so many words."
I:14626;2226;He does this in the name of Sparta, his family, his beliefs, and for what is altogether good.
I:14626;2227;the plot is simple: grand martyrs championing the cause of free men .
I:14626;2228;but with a lot of blood and contrasting color schemes!
I:14626;2229;"Simply put, if you love the story about the Alamo (especially the romanticized version of it), then the movie ""300"" is for you, my friend."
I:14626;2230;"And might I add, if you prefer the John Wayne version of the Alamo, then you will DEFINITELY love ""300""!"
I:14626;2231;still, each main character plays a strong role (headstrong, for sure), including the queen.
I:14626;2232;the supporting cast (the soldiers of the 300) are almost exact replicas of their king: brash, manly, unfearing, brave, disciplined, cavalier, and ultimately patriots.
I:14626;2233;Their banter is so perfect for this kind of movie in that any weakness in manhood would ruin the entire show.
I:14626;2234;If you want a modern day Alamo plus gore and graphics, you got it.
I:14626;2235;You see a lot of American ideals and culture propagated here.
I:14626;2236;star movie, and I recommend it for everybody who wants a romanticized tale about manliness.
I:14626;2237;I would gladly recommend this as an addition to anyone's personal home collection!
I:14626;2238;I loved the movie when i had seen it in the theatre.
I:14626;2239;The added plus of a second video shows the magic that happened behind the scenes.
I:14626;2240;It is a great movie and a must in any gladiator fans library.
I:14626;2241;drenched and fanciful account of Sparta's heroic albeit doomed stand at Thermopylae against the Persian hordes.
I:14626;2242;Great movie at a great price!
I:14626;2243;Thank you amazon for the cool deal!
I:14626;2244;"300 is based on a graphic novel by comic ""it"" man, Frank Miller."
I:14626;2245;Miller based his graphic novel on a series of truly heroic events that happened during the battle of Thermopylae.
I:14626;2246;That's what makes this film so great at times and so mundane at others.
I:14626;2247;Director Zack Snyder knows how to guide an epic speech, as is done on a number of occasions in this film by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler).
I:14626;2248;He also knows how to make a battle scene look really cool.
I:14626;2249;Despite knowing the fate of the Spartans, I cheered them on during their battles with the Immortals and others.
I:14626;2250;fi yarns of today, Snyder uses visual stylings and CGI effects as a crutch.
I:14626;2251;I enjoy comic book films as much as anybody.
I:14626;2252;screen adaptation, it works very well.
I:14626;2253;like voice is sort of funny.
I:14626;2254;The weapons, the armor, the helmets, and even the animated beasts from Hell all look excellent.
I:14626;2255;Heck, even if you do know about the real events and people involved with this story, you'll enjoy this movie as an action yarn.
I:14626;2256;I highly recommend it to fans of comic book movies.
I:14626;2257;"I also recommend it to history buffs, but the ""razzle."
I:14626;2258;I never really sat down and watched this movie until I got a great price on it during Black Friday week.
I:14626;2259;but this is a stunningly beautiful movie.
I:14626;2260;I'm just commenting on the visuals, which I found absolutely worth five stars.
I:14626;2261;300 is visually stunning if not completely factually accurate.
I:14626;2262;paced action with an incredible story behind it that will keep you interested and entertained from start to finish, 300 will work for you.
I:14626;2263;also, I should mention that I think this movie might just be the perfect date film.
I:14626;2264;Men will be entertained by the story of guts, glory, and honor, and women will be entertained by the man candy around every turn.
I:14626;2265;It's the best of both worlds.
I:14626;2266;The picture is very grainy for a modern Blu Ray rendition of a rather popular movie.
I:14626;2267;"I really enjoyed seeing what was ""real"" vs. what was ""computer generated"" for this movie."
I:14626;2268;(And for a few dollars more, the Combo disc is so worth it.
I:14626;2269;however I ALWAYS have been, and ALWAYS will be in love with the VERY talented and INCREDIBLY sexy Gerard Butler, so he saved the movie in my opinion!
I:14626;2270;"I am not a fan of these ""type"" movies but this is in a class by itself."
I:14626;2271;Plenty of action with a good story line.
I:14626;2272;Great movie about teamwork and focusing on goals.
I:14626;2273;This was a good movie.
I:14626;2274;But the part I liked most was the visual style.
I:14626;2275;So if youre looking for a simple action film that has a real cool visual style than this is for you.
I:14626;2276;The production it self was fantastic, Very well done!
I:14626;2277;There are times in film (few) where you are just overwhelmed with the spectacle of it all.
I:14626;2278;The merger of vision, story, and technology that can immerse you in a world, or a moment, or an emotion.
I:14626;2279;waltz sequence in the Fisher King.
I:14626;2280;All of those moments take you someplace else, and impress the circumstance and emotion on the viewer at a deeper level.
I:14626;2281;300 is notable, if for nothing else, for stringing more of these moments together in a more timeless manner than in any other movie I have ever seen.
I:14626;2282;A presentation that will likely stand the test of time as opposed to the some of the special effects sequences mentioned above.
I:14626;2283;"We're immersed in the mastery of the craftsmanship, and awed by the vision
I:14626;2284;"And this works because 300 isn't about the ""history"", 300 is a celebration, a dreamlike amplification of the legend."
I:14626;2285;the blue screen soundstage shooting gives the performances the closeness of a stage production, but also adds the ability to paint anything, anywhere, at anytime.
I:14626;2286;A significant improvement over other recent attempts at the technique.
I:14626;2287;As a result, you are always where you need to be, always at the right vantage point to fully enjoy the story.
I:14626;2288;This contrbutes greatly to how incredibly well paced the story is, maintaining its energy and message throughout its length.
I:14626;2289;The buildup, the battle, the intrigue, the defeat, and the ultimate victory all laid out masterfully, rollickingly, and enjoyably.
I:14626;2290;"(And hey, if the Iranian government is against it on ""cultural"" grounds, then sign me up!)"
I:14626;2291;You can learn more about that history in any number of places, and I'd encourage you to do so.
I:14626;2292;But it's impossible to find a more impressive, awe.
I:14626;2293;The movie is thoroughly entertaining, violent, but unreal enough for it not to be disturbing.
I:14626;2294;There is so much CG that the whole thing really does have more the look of a drawing than a photo.
I:14626;2295;Knowing that gives one the perspective to value the story and the visuals for what they are.
I:14626;2296;My ramblings are still good.
I:14626;2297;at least it brought out my emotions more.
I:14626;2298;this would make a good video game,that is about it.
I:14626;2299;"maybe I just wasn""t in the right mood at the time?Heck."
I:14626;2300;i liked King Arthur with Clive Owen better than this.
I:14626;2301;This movie is not great because the story was told so well, it's great because east clashes with west and the west wins.
I:14626;2302;Post 9/11 the message is beautiful.
I:14626;2303;300 European men stood off your vast army, won a mighty victory in the subsequent war and ended Bablylon in favor of the rise of the western democracies.
I:14626;2304;Great movie and great pack.
I:14626;2305;and the service very very good.
I:14626;2306;spaaaaarta!gerard butler,cercei lannister and the great frank miller!!
I:14626;2307;The 300's brilliant imagery is inspired by Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name.
I:14626;2308;The blood splatter was breathtaking.
I:14626;2309;It was brutally beautiful with gorgeous gore.
I:14626;2310;the fighting style and Phalanx), but overall the movie stays fairly close to the reality.
I:14626;2311;chested celebration of abs and flying body parts.
I:14626;2312;He and his valiant men were able to hold back the Persian invasion for two days in what is referred to as the Battle of Thermopylae.
I:14626;2313;the actors were outstanding considering they worked with a blue or green screen behind 100 percent of the time.
I:14626;2314;King Leonidas is portrayed by Gerard Butler, an actor with a voice so powerful that everyone in the theater should be convinced to join him in battle.
I:14626;2315;The gorgeous Lena Headey plays Queen Gorgo with style and throws down two of the best lines in the movie.
I:14626;2316;Backing up our heroes is an efficient cast of actors such as Dominic West, David Wenham and Rodrigo Santoro.
I:14626;2317;this is the classic story of the little guy versus the known world with a clear message that freedom must be earned .
I:14626;2318;Honor, glory, heroes, true men.
I:14626;2319;Thats who the 300 Spartans were, and this movie captures it.
I:14626;2320;Watch it, learn it, love it, and live it.
I:14626;2321;The cast led by Gerard Butler, is great.
I:14626;2322;"The directing by Zack Snyder (who also directed ""Dawn Of The Dead"" (2004) and the upcoming ""Watchmen"" (2008) is excellent."
I:14626;2323;"The screenplay (based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller (who is also known for his other creations, such as Daredevil, Elektra, Batman, and Robocop), who also wrote the graphic novel ""Sin City"" (2005) and co. directed the movie with Robert Rodriguez and Lynn Varley) by Snyder, Kurt Johnstad, and Michael Gordon is excellent."
I:14626;2324;"The music by Tyler Bates (who also did the music to ""Dawn Of The Dead"" and the upcoming ""Watchmen"") is excellent."
I:14626;2325;The cinematography by Larry Fong is excellent.
I:14626;2326;"nominated production design to ""Good Night And Good Luck."""
I:14626;2327;"pierre Paquet (all three also did the art direction to ""The Fountain"" (2006) is excellent."
I:14626;2328;"The set decoration by Paul Hotte (who also did the set decoration to ""The Fountain"") is excellent."
I:14626;2329;"The costume design by Michael Wilkinson (who also did the costume design to ""Babel"" (2006) is excellent."
I:14626;2330;"This is an excellent movie that is faithful to the graphic novel, just like Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" adaptation was."
I:14626;2331;Very intense with extreme fighting scenes.
I:14626;2332;Just all around great period movie!
I:14626;2333;300 is based on historical events and seeks to portray Spartan culture as well as the actual battle.
I:14626;2334;I marvel at the strength of the Spartan queen as well as the loyal warriors who march with Leonidas and die with him.
I:14626;2335;this movie has a powerful, oppressive empire (the Persians) and an underdog.
I:14626;2336;It has those with honor and those with none.
I:14626;2337;There is one steamy scene with the King and his Queen, as well as plenty of bloody battle action.
I:14626;2338;ray movies and this is the best looking movie I own.
I:14626;2339;ray version looks even better than in the movies.
I:14626;2340;Despite historical inaccuracies and my embarassment at someone my age liking this kind of movie so much, I loved it!!
I:14626;2341;Definitely not a 'chick flick', but overall this is a great movie.
I:14626;2342;Keeps you entertained from start to finish.
I:14626;2343;All things considered, overall this is a great movie.
I:14626;2344;it was soooooooooooooo worth getting dragged out to watch it i loved it great details, picture was great along with storyline .
I:14626;2345;love the movie and was a very nice addition to my collection.
I:14626;2346;was a fantastic value at this price.
I:14626;2347;Beautiful cinematic styles and shots.
I:14626;2348;The costumes and the fight scenes were mesmerizing.
I:14626;2349;It's raw and wild and exciting and heroic, and at times it feels absolutely epic.
I:14626;2350;And then there are the visuals, which are raw and dream.
I:14626;2351;life characters, villains that are fun to hate, heroes that are fun to root for, and a climax that'll melt your skin off.
I:14626;2352;This is a fantastic movie.
I:14626;2353;ler the best!He is an awesome actor and it showed in the great epic tail based on a true story about King Leonidis and his warriors!
I:14626;2354;Great special effects and editing!
I:14626;2355;Awesome movie, way worth the $20 to $30 price tag!
I:14626;2356;This is a keeper, even our teenage son liked it alot as well as my hubby, who thought it was really great too!
I:14626;2357;I have seen it twice!
I:14626;2358;I loved all of the Clash of the Titans and expected this movie to be somewhat in the small ball park.
I:14626;2359;After everyone recommending this movie to me I finally caved and ordered it.
I:14626;2360;Great war scenes but the story line needed help.
I:14626;2361;Normally I don't like super violent movies, but the graphics with this one makes it one of my favorites.
I:14626;2362;If you liked the style of Sin City I highly recommend 300.
I:14626;2363;The soundtrack to this movie is unexpected, but awesome!
I:14626;2364;I saw this movie and plan to see it many more times before it's available to own which I will do also.
I:14626;2365;This is the type of movie that both male and female can enjoy.
I:14626;2366;It's just pure fun to watch and you cannot help but get into the characters and story.
I:14626;2367;It is very riveting and intense and the battle seens are outstanding.
I:14626;2368;The soldiers work together in the movie and perform like a well oiled machine and it's amazing to watch!
I:14626;2369;Gerard (Gerry) Butler is outstanding in this role and really gives a strong depth to King Leonidas that no one else could have pulled off.
I:14626;2370;All of the cast were outstanding!!
I:14626;2371;The reviewer who refers to pixels blinking in the background is pretty spot on.
I:14626;2372;I'm a pretty big advocate of blu.
I:14626;2373;I have a strong affection for the marching music in the film and the shot of Leonidas leading the Spartan phalanx for the last time, plus an enduring sense of injustice at the Persians dispatching the last Spartans by wave after wave of cartoon arrows.
I:14626;2374;modern art, but that still counts as art in a world where computers are as important as cameras when making a movie.
I:14626;2375;"i was quite pleased the overall ""300"" met my expectations."
I:14626;2376;I want to see what is happening in order for the scenes to become memorable to me.
I:14626;2377;The net result may well be the best comic book movie to date, despite the fact the hero is a historical figure and not a superhero.
I:14626;2378;The story of the 300 Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae is that of the first great last stand.
I:14626;2379;This film recreates the events that led up to the battle at Thermopylae, the battle itself, and its aftermath.
I:14626;2380;Spartans were known for their highly developed physical attributes and their well trained phalanx of fighting men.
I:14626;2381;the general story is well told, and the cast is superlative, giving excellent performances.
I:14626;2382;Also noteworthy is the beautifully nuanced performance of Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo, wife to King Leonidas.
I:14626;2383;In her hands, the queen comes alive as a vibrant, intelligent, helpmate to the king, unafraid of voicing her opinion and capable of doing what is necessary to ensure that the King is well.
I:14626;2384;Lest anyone think that contemporary norms are what drive her portrayal, one need know that Spartan woman held a position of respect in their culture.
I:14626;2385;"Of course, the film is based upon the graphic novel, ""300"", by Frank Miller, which is pretty much a hardcover comic book, and it appears that the director of the film stayed to true to the source of his inspiration."
I:14626;2386;the battle at Thermopylae, however, is one of history's great stories, and it is a shame that it had to be reduced to something simulating an arcade experience.
I:14626;2387;No matter which side of the divide in which one may find oneself, one will, undoubtedly, enjoy this well.
I:14626;2388;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:14626;2389;The cinematics helped suck me in, obviously, and so did Gerard Butler at his finest (after Phantom of the Opera).
I:14626;2390;This will definitely be considered a classic decades from now in its own right.
I:14626;2391;This is an excellent family movie.
I:14626;2392;Although is may not be a family movie, this film is excellent and well done.
I:14626;2393;Not just for the obviously hot Gerald Butler, but the groundbreaking visual effects (I'm stealing the 'Oracle dance' for a video I want to do) and just the the sheer and surprising visceral joy I got from watching the movie.
I:14626;2394;"I find myself watching it over and over and completely thrilled with this ancient world ""special forces"" almost manga."
I:14626;2395;and i can say that it was Worth Every Penny.Yeah its that good.
I:14626;2396;IMHo the best of 2007.
I:14626;2397;its got an amazing visual style and the special sequences are simply awesome.
I:14626;2398;audio was also excellent.5/5 without a second thought.
I:14626;2399;if you're into blood and gore and you want a really well put together action movie that looks really nice, then watch this movie.
I:14626;2400;300 is a movie based on the legendary exploits of Spartan King Leonidas and Persian King Xerxes.
I:14626;2401;300 is a new adaptation directed by Zack Snyder and based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller.
I:14626;2402;without doubt, this is one of the more beautiful films that have graced the screen.
I:14626;2403;the battle scenes and phalanx were choreographed with attention to detail.
I:14626;2404;Good fun movie, very violent so keep that in mind.
I:14626;2405;Spartans, the greatest military minds of ancient greece and perhaps the greatest military force that ever existed, their swords where swift and their shields strong and anyone who stood in the way of their conquest fell in a pool of their own self assurance and derision.
I:14626;2406;This movie, besides its ovbious fictoral representation, portrays the spartan life style in good detail and engages the viewer in a world of fearless warriors who fealt pain as being the journey to the road that leads to glorious death in battle.
I:14626;2407;I love this movie because it captures the attitude i always imagined a spartan warrior would have, cocky, determined, and above all, a little crazy.
I:14626;2408;The terror the Spartan army instilled in their enemies was that they came on slowly in perfect step, inexorably, to the accompaniment of flute music.
I:14626;2409;A good blend of history and entertainment.
I:14626;2410;The visuals are stunning and the action intense.
I:14626;2411;I have always been a fan of Greek mythology and history.
I:14626;2412;The graphics in this movie are amazing.
I:14626;2413;I love the storyline and it is a great mix of sci.
I:14626;2414;, Vincent Regan, David Wenham (Faramir from LOR), and the rest of this exceptional cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!
I:14626;2415;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
I:14626;2416;Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!The setting, the music, the special effects and the dialogues, are all wonderful!
I:14626;2417;300 is a movie about honor, real men, and real heroes who fought and died in the name of Sparta, Greece and Freedom.
I:14626;2418;strongly recommended along with Steven Pressfield's best.
I:14626;2419;selling novel Gates of Fire and the 1962 classic film The 300 Spartans.
I:14626;2420;the cast is filled with all those actors that always play supporting roles.
I:14626;2421;And as with Gerard, I hope this movie brings them bigger and better movie roles.
I:14626;2422;all in all, this movie is superb, visually stunning and at times heart.
I:14626;2423;The Ugly Truth the whole movie is friendly to watch plot of story was strong.
I:14626;2424;I'll be sure to watch it.
I:14626;2425;Love, Love the collector's set to 300!!
I:14626;2426;Very quick delivery of product!
I:14626;2427;But, in general, it's inspiring and gripping.
I:14626;2428;A fun movie, if you accept the fact that it's *not* fact.
I:14626;2429;If you haven't seen this already, you have to!
I:14626;2430;Gerard Butler is excellent and the fast.
I:14626;2431;paced action keeps you excited throughout the movie.
I:14626;2432;Have watched it many times before and will watch it again.
I:14626;2433;Although this story is soooo sad, the movie is sooooo good!
I:14626;2434;In my opinion, anything with Gerard Butler is worth watching but this is a great one.
I:14626;2435;Husband likes it for the fight scenes and brief nudity.
I:14626;2436;there was a bit of blood, but i really enjoyed 300, i never new this part of history in such detail, now i do!!
I:14626;2437;I'm sure it is a great movie I have only watched it once so I really can not comment for a good rating.
I:14626;2438;Other people said it is a great movie so I will take there word.
I:14626;2439;This is a great movie, for the most part.
I:14626;2440;splashing takes away from an incredible story.
I:14626;2441;Historically, this movie for the most part stays the line.
I:14626;2442;"I'm a huge fan of ""300"" and I just had to have the ""collectors edition"" to include in my memorabilia."
I:14626;2443;see movies of the decade so far, this would be one of them.
I:14626;2444;There is much to learn in this tightly.
I:14626;2445;"acted historical drama that says in simplest form, ""In order to continue to be free, we must stand against the odds and continue to fight for that freedom."
I:14626;2446;In choosing Gerard Butler for this lead role, the producers added much to the statement.
I:14626;2447;"Butler epitomizes the stance of standing outside the crowd and succeeding there, and anyone who has seen his interviews knows the role is both ""him"" and enough unlike him to be an honest acting role."
I:14626;2448;They picked an actor with the talent to both fit the part and to make it his own.
I:14626;2449;along with the skill of the actors involved, the artistry of the movie is something rarely seen in mainstream cinema today.
I:14626;2450;It was exceptionally filmed, dramatic and scenic and vivid without an excess of gore, and with enough humor to bring occasional relief from the drama.
I:14626;2451;When it came to family, honor and integrity, 300 men were the first to stand in what they believe and were taught to always keep as their priority.
I:14626;2452;300 men, and 300 alone stood up for their lifestyle and fought to protect their ways.
I:14626;2453;If you want to see what loyalty is all about, definately view this movie, as you will see.
I:14626;2454;Action packed, meaningful and unforgettable, scene by scene, you will see the amazing strength of the Spartans' morals
I:14626;2455;screen adaptation of graphic novel legend Frank Miller's GN of the same name.
I:14626;2456;Miller is talented and leans toward the dark side.
I:14626;2457;The film 300 is imbued with a certain magic that stems from the excellent directing and cinematography.
I:14626;2458;And Xerxes himself is the icing on the cake, an androgynous man with many piercings and an impossibly deep voice.
I:14626;2459;He is so charismatic, his army so overwhelming, that you actually find yourself wanting to just give up and join him.
I:14626;2460;strong heroes upon whom rests a literally impossible task.
I:14626;2461;My son has seen this numerous times and just loves it.
I:14626;2462;Having read about the battle of Thermopylae and seen documentaries on the subject I was surprised at how much this movie had in common with the actual occurrences.
I:14626;2463;amazing action sequences and yet still has some heartfelt moments.
I:14626;2464;This movie is glorious fun.
I:14626;2465;while it's not the worst movie ever, it is pure fantasy, and not great fantasy at that.
I:14626;2466;Very gruesome war scenes yet a good movie.
I:14626;2467;I absolutely love this movie.
I:14626;2468;It has awesome battle sequences, tons of action, and great special effects!
I:14626;2469;This helped me to really enjoy the experience.
I:14626;2470;The color is the first thing that catches the eye.
I:14626;2471;The battle scenes take on artistic beauty and you look for the details around the edges of the frame.
I:14626;2472;The dance by the woman is beautiful and it takes you time to notice that she is nude.
I:14626;2473;No it is flowing and artful.
I:14626;2474;A mastery of film making.
I:14626;2475;I did enjoy it though, especially(or mainly because of) the action, stunning visuals, and cinematography.
I:14626;2476;Honestly, i would love to see The Matrix and the 300 fans battle it out in a Destroy All Hype contest.
I:14626;2477;Btw, another credit i'll give to the movie is it peaked my interest even more into the subject matter to the point i ordered the 60's(?)
I:14626;2478;The 300 Spartans(saw a little on tv once, kinda liked it), and the History Channel's Last Stand of the 300 documentary to go along with this.
I:14626;2479;Several years ago I boughtGates of Fire: An Epic Novel of the Battle of ThermopylaeThis book was history in a real way, and it was most enjoyable to learn about the Spartan life.
I:14626;2480;"For me, the film ""300"" might be the most amazing theater experience I'll have this year."
I:14626;2481;"Miller's had a lot of success, notably with ""Sin City"", and the films made from his books are faithful to the original material and feature over the top special effects, CGI, and an artist's eye to the total, sumptuous visual landscape."
I:14626;2482;He bribed and won over several of the Greek city states to his cause.
I:14626;2483;There are love scenes (and some gratuitous female nudity early on in the film) that help advance that feeling between them.
I:14626;2484;(And yes, there is the most amazing display of male 6.
I:14626;2485;pack abs ever displayed on film).
I:14626;2486;There is the grittiness in the feel and the dirt of the life of a soldier.
I:14626;2487;The hordes of the Persian army are of epic proportion.
I:14626;2488;the battle scenes, yes, the entire film is stylistically colored in sepia and earth tones, and the violence fills up every frame.
I:14626;2489;The cinematography here, and even in the quiet parts of the film, is amazing.
I:14626;2490;"the ""300"" is one man's vision of a historical event, magnified by today's technology, and assembled for the screen to depict how important it is to fight for freedom, even if you do so at the cost of your own life."
I:14626;2491;right down to watching the film in it's original blue screen glory!You've seen the film, I know.
I:14626;2492;Wanted to see this and then see the new one in theaters .
I:14626;2493;Do I need to say anything else?Great action movie and also a very moving movie.
I:14626;2494;If you like movies that are gruesome this is the one for you.
I:14626;2495;"I went to IMAX theater to watch this film: even it wasn't IMAX experience, i enjoyed it a lot since it's a ""titanic"" production an it needed ""gianourmous"" screen."
I:14626;2496;the unique style of shooting laid a surreal cast to the (mostly and amazingly) accurate representation from historical events.
I:14626;2497;The book, the plastic encased photo, the cards.
I:14626;2498;All in a beautiful box.
I:14626;2499;This is just a great flick all the way around: Great story, great visuals, great action scenes, great pace.
I:14626;2500;It's one of those movies I can always watch over and over.
I:14626;2501;300 puts you right there into combat, as well as a dream world type Sparta.
I:14626;2502;Truly one of a kind, breakthrough film.
I:14626;2503;Saw it twice, in fact.
I:14626;2504;But everyone that was cast in their parts did a fantastic job.
I:14626;2505;Hated to see him go.
I:14626;2506;zach Snyder did a superb job here.
I:14626;2507;this movie will surely catapult him to top director status.
I:14626;2508;I much prefer the fullscreen to the widescreen edition for non.
I:14626;2509;The movie itself is really great .
I:14626;2510;so nice to see a story about an unconflicted hero who makes a choice and sticks to his principles without whingeing and complaining about it the whole time, like some other comic book superheros we know and love.
I:14626;2511;It's not Shakespeare, nor is it a particularly accurate history lesson, but it's good fun with awesome special effects (esp.
I:14626;2512;he reminded me of that Monty Python skit about the guy who likes to shout), add enough blood, guts, and dismemberment to satisfy Mel Gibson, and there you have it.
I:14626;2513;What makes the film rise above a two star rating is the artistry of it.
I:14626;2514;Frank Miller's artistic sense shines through in some gorgeous, but often gruesome, scenes.
I:14626;2515;A feast, as it were, for the eyes and limbic system.
I:14626;2516;It's fun, lightweight amusement, and a good way to vicariously relieve yourself of any anger you might have against your boss, teacher, sibling, or spouse.
I:14626;2517;I absolutely LOVE this movie!
I:14626;2518;It's like Shakespearean drama meets comic book style and the results are amazing.
I:14626;2519;It's the kind of movie that needs the big screen.
I:14626;2520;This is an action film at its best, and it has something for everyone.
I:14626;2521;This is one of those movies where it's very simple: You know before you watch whether you will hate it or love it.
I:14626;2522;"don't expect ""Best Actor"" skills from Gerard Butler, but do be prepared to be stunned by the visual genius of Frank Miller."
I:14626;2523;The fighting cinematography is revolutionary.
I:14626;2524;ins at exactly the right moments, the battle sequences themselves are things of legend.
I:14626;2525;Great price and I received a free streaming version while I waited for it to arrive.
I:14626;2526;Which was nice since this was a gift.
I:14626;2527;one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:14626;2528;The movie itself was well done .
I:14626;2529;good acting and cinematography, etc.
I:14626;2530;He played the role so over the top and so flamboyant, I was giggling throughout.
I:14626;2531;some of the digital animals used were fun to watch .
I:14626;2532;and they all seem to be incredibly into each other .
I:14626;2533;"eastern sounding background score so that Western audiences can go ""Oooh, how authentic""."
I:14626;2534;Its going to be great, thank you Toshiba for this 1st class video format!
I:14626;2535;Those who like Sin City will like it a lot, those who like the first Conan will like it a lot, and those who like both Conan and Sin City will love it.
I:14626;2536;I knew it was a movie I wanted to see and so this weekend, I invited five of my female friends to see it for a girls afternoon out and I am pleased to report that we all enjoyed it thoroughly.
I:14626;2537;300 is a visual masterpiece with amazing battle sequences, an engrossing story and well drawn characters.
I:14626;2538;Most 'action' type movies come off with clunky dialogue and a poor storyline but Zack Snyder does an impressive job of casting little known (excepting Gerard Butler) but well respected British actors and filming almost completely on blue screen without sacrificing the storyline or losing its historical significance.
I:14626;2539;"driven films come off as unconvincing and some laughably fake, ""300"" comes off as a visually stunning and eye."
I:14626;2540;This is a film that successfully blends art and action.
I:14626;2541;In many ways, Zach Snyder is a visionary filmmaker and a worthy successor to the likes of Peter Jackson and George Lucas.
I:14626;2542;another strength is in the story.
I:14626;2543;i will not pretend that everything in this film is historically accurate but I was actually surprised that it came pretty close.
I:14626;2544;This is an adaptation of the graphic novel by Frank Miller, who depicts the Battle of Thermopylae in his book of the same name.
I:14626;2545;the casting is topnotch as well, eventhough they are not A. list names.
I:14626;2546;Gerard Butler (King Leonidas) carries the film but there are also standout performances from Lena Heady (Queen Gorgo), David Wenham (Dilios .
I:14626;2547;and Faramir from 'The Lord of the Rings'), Michael Fassbender (Stelios .
I:14626;2548;all tall, muscular and powerful.
I:14626;2549;the action scenes are fast and furious, and there is a great deal of blood and violence.
I:14626;2550;The fight scenes are full of energy, with a mix of slow.
I:14626;2551;"The Return of the King"" and it is absolutely thrilling."
I:14626;2552;When the barrage of arrows from the Persians block out the sun and the Spartans push the Persians to their death at sea, it is both beautiful and awe.
I:14626;2553;"in summary, ""300"" is a movie that a wide range of audiences can enjoy."
I:14626;2554;History buffs will enjoy it because it is a fair and (for the most part) accurate depiction of the Battle of Thermopylae.
I:14626;2555;Fanboys and comic book fans will enjoy it because of its Frank Miller roots and Zach Snyder's vision.
I:14626;2556;And most everyone else will enjoy it because it is an entertaining, engrossing film.
I:14626;2557;the visual effects of the Spartans fighting is amazing as the Director slows down a sequence of the fighting.
I:14626;2558;if you enjoy Historic films or films about true life Warriors you have to watch this movie its amazing !
I:14626;2559;What I received was the original movie.
I:14626;2560;It looked great from that point on.
I:14626;2561;An interesting and amusing action film, fantastic in its genders: Comic,historic, action.
I:14626;2562;"Hold ""300"" up to the light and you can see right through it's glorious, silk."
I:14626;2563;300 is, indeed, a beautifully rendered film, but much like the planes of the most gorgeous mirror, the only substance you will find to look at is the reflection of your own ideologies and assumptions.
I:14626;2564;"This film is ""about"" the Battle of Thermopylae, and its plot boasts battle twists, betrayal, political intrigue, corruption, and self."
I:14626;2565;I was, in fact, tempted to give it five stars simply for its sumptuousness.
I:14626;2566;cute son standing in waving amber fields.
I:14626;2567;She looks moodily out to the vanishing distance, and suddenly the theatre is filled with a crooning, Enya.
I:14626;2568;They serve here not just as fissures in the energy and heart of the piece, but also as eye.
I:14626;2569;rolling attempts to reflect in Gorgo's gorgeous eyes and body a courage at least as powerful as that of her hunky hubby.
I:14626;2570;"at one point, one of the Spartans utters the following line: ""I never got a chance to tell him I loved him."""
I:14626;2571;Because all I expected were astonishing battle sequences, vistas painted with adrenaline, acid, and ambition.
I:14626;2572;I've loved 300 since it came out in 2007.
I:14626;2573;I'd recommend it to anyone who likes cool special.
I:14626;2574;The acting was pretty good.
I:14626;2575;I had very high expectations from this film the second that I saw it's trailer.
I:14626;2576;put humor in all the right placesCons:.
I:14626;2577;"some of the ""creatures"" almost made you laugh, and question if they were actually necessaryHonestly that's the only negative to say about this movie."
I:14626;2578;It's almost a perfect mix between Gladiator and Lord of the Rings.
I:14626;2579;So if you like those two movies, you'll love this movie!
I:14626;2580;If you like Gerard Butler and action, this is the one for you!
I:14626;2581;Plus its based somewhat on a true story!
I:14626;2582;The acting was fine because it fell true to the graphic novel.
I:14626;2583;real, the approach here was to achieve an artistic vision.
I:14626;2584;A beautifully crafted film that looks great on Blu.
I:14626;2585;One of the most breathtaking movies that I ever seen.
I:14626;2586;A visual treat with a fine cast.
I:14626;2587;This movie makes you want to stand and cheer to it's last minute.
I:14626;2588;The 300 Spartans last stand at the pass in Thermopylae is movie making at it's best!
I:14626;2589;the battle scenes are awesome, this is Gerard's breakout performance
I:14626;2590;liked the female role models (although not for young kids!)
I:14626;2591;I love the actors, especially Gerard Butler who played his role to perfection.
I:14626;2592;As a woman I enjoyed the sight of all of those men half clad and looks so fantastic.
I:14626;2593;I like my history served up with lots of interesting sights and sounds.
I:14626;2594;This is an entertaining movie to a point.
I:14626;2595;Would I recommend this movie.
I:14626;2596;excellent movie bad format to view in
I:14626;2597;Spoken by King Leonidas as the Spartans form phalanx as a single mind.
I:14626;2598;the movie is visually stunning, once you get past its being a moving graphic novel, not a moving watercolor (which was the style of Lord of the Rings).
I:14626;2599;The Spartans are truly Spartan, in their words, their costumes, their sets.
I:14626;2600;The fight between 2 Spartans and some ridiculous number of Persians is wonderful to watch.
I:14626;2601;bottom line: 300 was definitely watchable.
I:14626;2602;a great story about the spartains.
I:14626;2603;Well played and the perfect cast.
I:14626;2604;This is a must see
I:14626;2605;mo fight scenes, so beautiful.
I:14626;2606;you need suspension of disbelief and let yourself enjoy it.
I:14626;2607;gerard butler is fantastic, he blows guys like william wallace in braveheart etc out of the water.
I:14626;2608;Love it and cant wait for the next one!
I:14626;2609;This is perhaps one of the best ever action movies, of all time.
I:14626;2610;Breathtakingly stunning visual effects, and some cool as hell battle sequences that are on par with special effects like the matrix.
I:14626;2611;Otherwise this is one fantastic movie, that goes on my list as a best, favorite!
I:14626;2612;But what I saw instead was such a vastly improved upon style.
I:14626;2613;Sin City was done on an amazing budget with un.
I:14626;2614;This lives up to and exceeds my expectations many fold.
I:14626;2615;Obviously lots of digital effects, but wow what a story!!!
I:14626;2616;I loved it in the theatre and will watch dozens of times again.
I:14626;2617;Take a look at the Wikipedia definition of 300 and read the story before you see the movie or even to reflect on what you saw.
I:14626;2618;Very cool story of bravery .
I:14626;2619;that part was definitely true to form.
I:14626;2620;My cousin was in town and wanted to see this film.
I:14626;2621;I was (or still am to some extent non regarding his turn to fanatical right wing opinions) a fan of many of Frank Miller's graphic novel and comic works, and also was curious about the hype.
I:14626;2622;It got more and more scary the more I thought about it.
I:14626;2623;But there is something sinister about a lot of these elements when played against one another.
I:14626;2624;Just getting ready for the new one good history better then sitting in a class yes they keep true to life
I:14626;2625;I got this movie on blu.
I:14626;2626;If you like action then you need to see this movie!
I:14626;2627;One of the better ones out there right now!
I:14626;2628;"I was really looking forward to seeing this flick, mainly because I loved the movie ""Gladiator""."
I:14626;2629;oh, and for those of you who think this movie is Soooo great .
I:14626;2630;With all the fight scenes and pure action this movie brings it is a must see for any action fan.
I:14626;2631;This movie by far is one of my favorite movies of the year and another great Frank Miller movie.
I:14626;2632;So if your a fan of his work you have to see this movie.
I:14626;2633;A pretty good storyline too about honor and the value of freedom.
I:14626;2634;Yes quite unrealistic but still an entertaining film nevertheless.
I:14626;2635;amazing underlying foundation to this story.
I:14626;2636;I love when big strong movies do NOT have sexy airheads in the leading woman/romantic interest role.
I:14626;2637;The Greeks must be so proud to be immortalized in movies like this!And the 300.
I:14626;2638;It may be a man's man's movie but it won my heart to the fullest from start to finish.
I:14626;2639;Absolutely wicked movie and I could watch it over and over and never get tired of the strength, the passion, the epicness.
I:14626;2640;and yes, the guts and the glory!
I:14626;2641;I saw this movie in a theater the first time and it's a great guy.
I:14626;2642;ray disk and a movie well worth having in your library.
I:14626;2643;It's the kind of movie that you can watch over and over and the timeless theme stands up well in future viewings.
I:14626;2644;This movie embellishes the epic story of the Spartans during the Battle of Thermopylae.
I:14626;2645;It is done in a comic book style similar to Sin City.
I:14626;2646;For the guys there are epic battles and beautiful women.
I:14626;2647;The story is told really well like a grandfather or father telling his sons.
I:14626;2648;The imagery is beautiful and gory.
I:14626;2649;Have not read the graphic novel but I still enjoyed the visual style and ass kicking that went on.
I:14626;2650;When I saw this movie in theaters I thought it was going to be just another gory war flick, but it has turned out to be one of my favorite movies.
I:14626;2651;It has a rich plot and characters you respect right away.
I:14626;2652;The cinematography was beautiful and the music was unexpected and great.
I:14626;2653;I took all my friends to see it and pre.
I:14626;2654;You will love this movie!
I:14626;2655;I love this movie its filmed in an interesting way its based on historical happenings the guys are hunky and hardcore .
I:14626;2656;The fight scenes were awesome and overall good on graphics.
I:14626;2657;I absolutely LOVE this movie.
I:14626;2658;"I will be honest, and say that I hesitated, and did not see it in theaters, because I thought that the computer graphics were going to be ""too"" heavy, ""too"" unrealistic."
I:14626;2659;I just enjoy this movie so much, I watch it over and over!
I:14626;2660;I love the narration, the VERY VERY preciseness of the storytelling is pure genius!
I:14626;2661;It keeps your heart pounding!
I:14626;2662;I can surely see the time that was put into the thoughts and emotions of this movie.
I:14626;2663;I am so glad we have these minds at work out there, with the awesome talents surrounding them, to create the wonderful movies they do!!!
I:14626;2664;I love movies that much!
I:14626;2665;gerard Butler is an attractive man.
I:14626;2666;They did an awesome job making ALL the soldiers EXTREMELY attractive!
I:14626;2667;(CAG, their physique, and costumes) Nothing like so super hot, courageous men!
I:14626;2668;i think I have made it clear that I love the movie!
I:14626;2669;This movie is an epic event, just amazing and a stunning film to be put into high defintion.
I:14626;2670;Both formats should be happy to have such a great movie on their format.

I:14626;2675;After that, it's nice to be fighting for something other than, oh, bragging rights about who has the biggest spear.
I:14626;2676;And that's what this movie really is: a super.

I:14626;2680;Also, some highly imaginative creatures were created to add a bit of mythology to the film.
I:14626;2681;"Overall, my rating for the 2006 film ""300"" is 5 out of 5 stars and is highly recommended."
I:14626;2682;Great movie that represents the battle between the Spartans and the Persians well.
I:14626;2683;Will be adding this one to my home movie collection.
I:14626;2684;Action packed, good plot, and based on true events.
I:14626;2685;Enjoyable entertainment with a good cast who performed well throughout the movie.
I:14626;2686;top melodramatics don't support the action.
I:14626;2687;300 Is One of The Greatest Films Ever MadeFrank Miller's interpretation of the tale of 300 lone Spartan warriors fending off hordes of Persian invaders is hands down one the best films ever made.
I:14626;2688;300 is unabashed in its representation of the highest ideals of man, of clear cut good and evil, of right and wrong, and of a heroic defense, to the death, of freedom, justice, and reason.
I:14626;2689;The movie invokes and justifies feelings of empowerment and a renews your idealism, giving you the moral and spiritual fuel for your struggles for the good life by witnessing one of the most spirited defenses of ideals humans have ever accomplished.
I:14626;2690;"A beautiful Hellenistic sculpture glorifies all the highest ideals of man
I:14626;2691;humanization, the destruction of ideals and values, brought into permanent physical form.
I:14626;2692;art, according to Aristotle, is in it's best form a representation of man as he ought to be, not as he is.
I:14626;2693;the proper form of art in a philosophy based on reason, reality, and life as an ethical standard is one that encourages a life based on reason, which can be tangibly connected in a meaningful manner to the reality of the witness to the art, and which advocates and promulgates a ethical system which holds life as it's standard.
I:14626;2694;"consider then, what great art is, and understand that ""300"" is probably the greatest concretization of human ideals in visual media ever created."
I:14626;2695;But if you want a documentary, turn to the History Channel.
I:14626;2696;300 is a moral epic told against a historical backdrop, containing real historical figures but representing them as profound human beings we can all look up to and admire, in situations and stories indeed conceptually similar to the factual historical reality.
I:14626;2697;"in classical Greek fashion, Frank Miller was not presenting Sparta (and man) as he is or was, but as he *ought* to be
I:14626;2698;King Leonidas is no barbarian robot, but a passionate lover to his wife, and passionate fighter for justice.
I:14626;2699;He respects and cherishes his wife, who is as morally strong as he, and he fights and dies for her freedom, not wishing to see her condemned to a life of slavery, while she fights to save his life.
I:14626;2700;Where movies had disco sound tracks and nihilistic themes, coming out of the 70's Vietnam protest and moral relativism era, Star Wars came along to tell an inspirational and uplifting grand heroic moral epic with a classical and powerfully emotive sound track.
I:14626;2701;I can not recall the last time I heard people cheer at a movie, and it wasn't just the style of the movie, it's the message as well, presented in a good style, that resonates strongly with people.
I:14626;2702;I for one find myself filled with a little more hope for America since a movie like this did so well in the box office.
I:14626;2703;This movie appeals to our innermost capacity for idealism and invokes feelings of empowerment and justifies them.
I:14626;2704;It brings us moral and spiritual fuel for the struggles for a good life we undertake.
I:14626;2705;The great works of literature last not because they are historically accurate, they rarely if ever are, but usually because they convey great human moral truths in a powerful story and in a manner which people can objectively connect with.
I:14626;2706;If you were to make a movie glorifying extreme nationalism and dictatorial rule, Nazi Germany is an optimal setting because it contrasts the concept of freedom embraced by much of the world, if you are making a movie defending and glorifying freedom and reason, Ancient Greece is an excellent setting as it contrasts the prevalence of slavery and tyranny which dominated every other ancient civilization.
I:14626;2707;"the very concept of ""freedom"" had to originate somewhere for it to develop into it's modern form."
I:14626;2708;No, every salient step toward freedom should be celebrated, and the Ancient Greek city states steps took the first and most important steps in that direction, and at the battle of Thermopylae and in the greater context of the Persian wars, would come face to face with the greatest threat that ideal would ever encounter in a victory whose repercussions resonate throughout the world for thousands of years.
I:14626;2709;Though this is a historical inaccuracy, I cite it because the accurate story was thematically much more powerful.
I:14626;2710;This, to me, deviated from the intense passion and love of values that Leonidas showed at all other times with his wife and the Spartans embraced.
I:14626;2711;additionally, Frank Miller appears to feel that true heroism is sacrificing ones life in the name of a higher ideal.
I:14626;2712;Sacrificing ones own life for a higher ideal, for something that is more important to someone than their life, is noble and just, but only when it is the last and necessary course of action.
I:14626;2713;Fighting for ones highest ideals, perpetually and indefinitely through the whole course of one's life, is far more difficult and far more admirable.
I:14626;2714;Good stories transcend the backdrop they are performed on and speak to people of all eras because they speak to an important ideal.
I:14626;2715;It is a theme not only of moral courage but also of perseverance and overwhelming tenacity, of struggling through the most tremendous odds for what you know to be right, even if you face death along the way.
I:14626;2716;Where your passion and your goals drive your life and your friends and lovers are fellow travelers in your journey.
I:14626;2717;But be sure your goals are sound and ideals are good, fancy clothes and big houses do not necessarily make a good life, and pursuit of the irrational may actually damage the things you do value.
I:14626;2718;When you are exhausted and battered, think of the 300 Spartans facing millions of Persians, fighting for freedom and justice and reason, think of their courage and tenacity and find strength in yourself that they as fellow humans found and that you know you have in you.
I:14626;2719;Always fight for your ideals and the things you value in homage to Leonidas and the 300 and your own highest potential.
I:14626;2720;This is one of the greatest movies ever made, see it, enjoy it, feel it, love it.
I:14626;2721;Super great movie and story.
I:14626;2722;Casting was spot on and the dialogue was great.
I:14626;2723;"It was to be a gift for a ""300"" enthusiast so I had to find another gift for him."
I:14626;2724;I have tremendous respect for Frank Miller, having been exposed to his reimagining of Batman at an early age.
I:14626;2725;Miller infused Batman with mature dignity, heavy with grief over what he was doing but doing it anyway.
I:14626;2726;minded director to subsume his own inclinations and stay true to Miller's material.
I:14626;2727;well the end result was a theater packed with kids, who, five minutes into the film, become utterly silent.
I:14626;2728;It's everything cool about Gladiator's war against the barbarian tribes, everything amazing about Achilles' fighting style and six.
I:14626;2729;pack abs in Troy, all the special effects of Clash of the Titans brought up to date for the modern age, everything terrifying about the villain from Stargate, and a whole heap of the Lord of the Rings' saber rattling wrapped up into one glorious, bloody fight to the death.
I:14626;2730;300 doesn't just show you death, it rolls around in it and makes it beautiful.
I:14626;2731;"Men joke as they skewer their helpless enemies, make fun of Athenian ""boy lovers,"" and keep a running murder tally for who can rack up the most kills."
I:14626;2732;My brother loved the movie.
I:14626;2733;My pregnant wife loved the movie too.
I:14626;2734;The special effects in this movie are great.
I:14626;2735;This is the rarest of all movies, a riveting, compelling action movie.
I:14626;2736;I was thoroughly impressed with the acting, the story, the spellbinding cinematography, the dialog, the sub.
I:14626;2737;It's a great capsule of the human experience that you must see to believe.
I:14626;2738;my favorite line (in a movie filled with great lines) is the Queen telling the man she just stabbed (and who raped her shortly before) mocking his earlier lines: You will not enjoy this.
I:14626;2739;This is a great movie, worthy of your time.
I:14626;2740;View it and have a good time rooting for the good guys!
I:14626;2741;In the movie, the Spartans are fighting for freedom, yet what kind of freedom do they mean.
I:14626;2742;the freedom to own slaves, the freedom to murder, the freedom to molest children.
I:14626;2743;I loved the movie to begin with.
I:14626;2744;it's one of the few I've seen multiple times.
I:14626;2745;I think it is the most epic Romantic period piece ever, and it is fairly closely based on a true story, which makes it even more awesome.
I:14626;2746;I really enjoyed all the special features on the disc, and legitimately learned some new things.
I:14626;2747;This is one of the best movie of the century.
I:14626;2748;You've got to see it.
I:14626;2749;I have to say, this is a great movie, and the blu.
I:14626;2750;ray version makes it even better.
I:14626;2751;ray is far more clear and vibrant.
I:14626;2752;It is beautiful to look at and is worth seeing for the visuals alone.
I:14626;2753;The cast of relative unknowns does a good job in bringing life to the characters.
I:14626;2754;stop action movie that I highly recommend.
I:14626;2755;We both enjoyed the movie in the theatre so I know he would love it.
I:14626;2756;If you have seen this movie, it's worth getting it to add to any home collection.
I:14626;2757;If you haven't seen it yet, it is a really great gladiator style movie that men will love.
I:14626;2758;The only thing I do recommend is if you are ordering before Christmas, make sure you do so well in advance, because they ship USPS and they are much slower than UPS or FedEx.
I:14626;2759;Grecian King (King Leonidas) is fighting for his country, his love and his honor.
I:14626;2760;As the fate of Leonidas and his 300 Spartians is decided, you will be entertained by the plot, cool costumes and great special effects, which all lead to a decent and entertaining movie.
I:14626;2761;Women for babies, boys for fun.
I:14626;2762;homosexuals come in huge variety, and most of the types are interesting human beings, as Brokeback Mountain and Philadelphia demonstrated.
I:14626;2763;This could have been a really good movie.
I:14626;2764;somehow got stamped onto elite warriors.
I:14626;2765;the narrator voice I even found a bit much.
I:14626;2766;This is an awesome example of the way a movie in BD format should look like.
I:14626;2767;In fact, it shows amazing black level, incredible contrast, awesome detail and color.You will be able to see every hair in Leonidas' beard, perfect detail in the water and overall beautiful photography.
I:14626;2768;This is a truly great transfer.
I:14626;2769;Also, the sound is impeccable.
I:14626;2770;As a movie, 300 is near perfect.
I:14626;2771;300 is one of my all time favorites.
I:14626;2772;The movie is so intense and follows a great battle story of the Spartans vs. the Persians.
I:14626;2773;Zack Snyder shoots the movie in such a cool way that it is hard to take your eyes off the screen.
I:14626;2774;From the opening scene of being born into the Spartan culture to the ending scene where it pans out showing a gigantic Spartan battle formation, the movie is breathtaking and very original.
I:14626;2775;It also has a pretty awesome soundtrack to go along with the various fight scenes.
I:14626;2776;I actually took some pictures of this film from my theater and put it on my profile page.
I:14626;2777;so, a good movie, one of the best so far in 2007, some of the images are straight out of the horror genre, and there is a ton of action to go along with a visually beautiful film.
I:14626;2778;Director Zack Snyder compares the pre cgi enhanced version to the finished film.
I:14626;2779;webisodes: Go on set with the cast and crew.
I:14626;2780;pick your favorite scenes: Assemble your favorite clips and create your own montage.
I:14626;2781;Facing insurmountable odds, the Spartans' fierce resistance inspires all of Greece to unite against the middle eastern invaders.
I:14626;2782;He is one of my favorite comic book artists.
I:14626;2783;The action is fantastic and the costumes and real.
I:14626;2784;life sets are very well done.
I:14626;2785;While not much effort is put into the acting, the actors and actresses all do a good job with their roles none.
I:14626;2786;Hopefully, Frank Miller will be pleased with the film's outcome and it was rightfully a blockbuster at the box office.
I:14626;2787;300 is the single greatest movie ever made by any human and/or huminid within the last 8000 years
I:14626;2788;While it is based on an actual event, it is an adaptation of a graphic novel version of the story.
I:14626;2789;If you are looking for an action movie with great visuals, good fight sequences, and good (but certainly not great) acting, you will probably find this to be entertaining.
I:14626;2790;Personally I think the best performances in the movie come from Dominic West and Lena Headey.
I:14626;2791;If you are looking for movie that is an accurate representation of the Battle of Thermopylae pass this by, but if you are looking for a good action movie that looks and sounds great on Blu Ray, then this will be a good addition to your collection.
I:14626;2792;But it's all for honor and being righteous.
I:14626;2793;The special effects are cool, the action is ok, and opinion can either be based on being intelligent or no.
I:14626;2794;See any of the Lord of the Rings films instead.
I:14626;2795;"But take from them everything!"""
I:14626;2796;This was a great movie and if you saw it in the theaters Blu.
I:14626;2797;ray is a great way to watch it at home.
I:14626;2798;The Action is great there are some good features.
I:14626;2799;Overall, it was a great film!
I:14626;2800;It was a treat for a New Year's Eve party with close family and friends!
I:14626;2801;those gams are great, but it's also a story about great heroism .
I:14626;2802;My eye [the one that can still see] .
I:14626;2803;They were very nice, Greekmmm err Spartan boys .
I:14626;2804;great companion piece to this saga!]
I:14626;2805;300 I found to be an entertaining timewaster, as well as fun eye.
I:14626;2806;Zach Snyder may not be the best in terms of story and plot but I can always count on him when it comes to great action and great visuals.
I:14626;2807;He also does some great music here and there.
I:14626;2808;While he is not good at coming up with his own unique stories, he is great when it comes to adapting other peoples work.
I:14626;2809;For what 300 was I was entertained.
I:14626;2810;the story is fairly simple.
I:14626;2811;Even though this was a historical event this film is based on a comic first.
I:14626;2812;I found the style enjoyable because I had not seen many films with this style before this.
I:14626;2813;The action scenes were really good as well.
I:14626;2814;He is definitely the character everyone is drawn to and Gerard Butler does a good job performance.
I:14626;2815;overall, 300 is style over substance but I found myself entertained.
I:14626;2816;If you are looking more an entertaining action film with good visuals then you should enjoy this.
I:14626;2817;This is one of the top best movies of all time.
I:14626;2818;I cant afford a player yet though).
I:14626;2819;Now that I've actually got the disc working better.
I:14626;2820;I just watched 300 again with the split screen feature that shows you the regular unprocessed footage along with the regular movie and it is very, very cool.
I:14626;2821;I liked it a lot.
I:14626;2822;Each time I see it I discover new things.
I:14626;2823;On a large multiplex screen it is good, but just WOW!
I:14626;2824;And I loved this film!
I:14626;2825;And I loved Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, another artistic masterpiece.
I:14626;2826;Fighting, blood and death in the hands of a great cast and director makes for a great time at the movies.
I:14626;2827;Like a great battle painting, you want to visit it often.
I:14626;2828;300 has a rousing story to tell, based on a true event.
I:14626;2829;outstanding in the role of King Leonidas, Gerard Butler, owns the screen whenever he appears.
I:14626;2830;When he stands on the battlefield eating an apple, as the warriors finish checking the last of the Persian dead and dying, it is an iconic moment.
I:14626;2831;headley's Queen is fierce and strong, and has her revenge on the villian of the piece, Theron (Dominic West).
I:14626;2832;It brings applause and/or cheers depending on which audience you see the film with.
I:14626;2833;the battle scenes are amazing.
I:14626;2834;The one long tracking scene of Leonidas in battle killing about a dozen men as they charge down the field, is heart poundingly great.
I:14626;2835;Thank you Zack and Gerard!Just leave your cares and have a great time at the movies.
I:14626;2836;From 1940 on this is the kind of film that makes fans of youth for life.10/10
I:14626;2837;"The action was good 
I:14626;2838;Watch it if you want to see some Spartans do their thing.
I:14626;2839;as for the movie, i did see it when it was in theaters and loved it.
I:14626;2840;awesome picture and the sound is unbeatable.
I:14626;2841;MUST have 5.1 system to fully enjoy
I:14626;2842;This is a good guy movie, I enjoyed it I like history and I think its worth watching.
I:14626;2843;"In ""300,"" director Zack Snyder's hyperkinetic, adrenaline."
I:14626;2844;macho adaptation of Frank Millar's hyperkinetic, adrenaline.
I:14626;2845;This a film that attempted to embody the bravura of pure cinema, and it got close.
I:14626;2846;"Drenched in the vibrant visual style of ""Sin City,"" Snyder's and cinematographer Larry Fong's battle scenes synthesize their style from a variety of sources, such the ferocious close combat sword jangling found in the ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the blood."
I:14626;2847;But they add their own innovative wrinkle as well, aggressively pulling the camera back on ground level to take in the jarring effect of sword and spear meeting flesh.
I:14626;2848;Throughout the film, they draw you in to this dramatized, and more than likely fanciful, Spartan culture, one that is fierce and fraternal.
I:14626;2849;It's enthralling, if not exactly historic.
I:14626;2850;"If it is a purely exciting and engrossing cinematic experience you are looking for, look not further then ""300."""
I:14626;2851;this movie is quite impressive, despite the special effects that at times looks animated, it blends well with the environment and its actors.
I:14626;2852;if you love Braveheart or Gladiator than this is the movie for you.
I:14626;2853;good:Extremely violent with lots of body parts flying, lots of action, a bit nudity, and a few sex/rape scene.
I:14626;2854;top extreme comic book action movie.
I:14626;2855;It gives it an edge over others.
I:14626;2856;the story is line is decent even though the characters were rushed.
I:14626;2857;The main focus really was on King Leonidas and few of his top people.
I:14626;2858;If you love Braveheart or Gladiator than this movie is for you.
I:14626;2859;overall, most of my male friends and male co. workers rate this movie top 3 best action movie of all time.
I:14626;2860;Many female friends agree that it's a great movie too.
I:14626;2861;It's good to see a movie tailor for real men again.
I:14626;2862;It's all about hacked and slash.
I:14626;2863;Just watched the movie today, I loved it.
I:14626;2864;Great story line, good special effects.
I:14626;2865;Great movie cant wait to the second movieThumbs up!!!
I:14626;2866;Gerard Butler is HOT and all those ripped men are fabulous to look at.
I:14626;2867;The cinema style is great, the action and humor rock.
I:14626;2868;It's a great guilty pleasure.
I:14626;2869;After some amazing trailers and about a years worth of hype I finally witnessed 300 this morning.
I:14626;2870;Gerard Butler sheds The Phantom of the Opera mask and unleashes a powerhouse performance.
I:14626;2871;The film is visually beautiful to look at and should earn some Oscar nominations next year in the technical department.
I:14626;2872;If you liked Gladiator and Sin City, you will love this movie, for it is roughly a combination of the two.
I:14626;2873;OK I understand young people's admiration for this movies' explosive and riveting action sequences.
I:14626;2874;Pound for pound this movie is a knockout!But all those people who fantasize the notion that this was a deep and meaningful depiction about human spirit and triumph, please watch it again.
I:14626;2875;This has to be the first movie ever to depict an entire historical civilization as subhuman.
I:14626;2876;This is noir film making at its best!!!
I:14626;2877;It also came very close the history of King Leonides and his 300 taking their last stand at Thermopylae.
I:14626;2878;There is a lot of symbolism used here.
I:14626;2879;Gerard Butler did an excellent job of King Leonides, I could not imagine anyone else playing him, and the rest of the cast were excellent.
I:14626;2880;I am so happy that they did not use the world's most famous actors, as I truly think that the film would have suffered for it.
I:14626;2881;And THANKYOU Zack Snyder for not changing the ending and having King Leonides and his 300 live and walk off into the sunset (think of Paris and Helen walking off into the sunset in Troy thanks to the over inflated ego of Wolfgang Peterson and his screen writer) For that is what I am most grateful for that this film has stayed true to the simple story of those Spartan Soldiers making their last stand at Thermopylae.
I:14626;2882;Simply, a great film adapted from the visionary Frank Miller brought beautifully to the big screen.
I:14626;2883;i am a fan of frank miller graphic novels and enjoyed Sin City alot.
I:14626;2884;This was a incredible movie!
I:14626;2885;The look of the film was awesome.
I:14626;2886;The effects are still spectacular and the story is still intensely played out to the viewer.
I:14626;2887;it's well worth the money, whether it's Blu.
I:14626;2888;sit back and enjoy the determination of King Leonidas and his 300!
I:14626;2889;Excellent film, very enjoyable my wife and I enjoyed it very much.
I:14626;2890;thankyou Amazon for an excellent service.
I:14626;2891;The only character to impress me with credible portrayal was the courageous Queen of Sparta.
I:14626;2892;viewed treasure to me, while the 2007 Blu.
I:14626;2893;"If you loved Sin City, you're going to love ""300."""
I:14626;2894;The sepia tones and white diffused combinations are just beautiful.
I:14626;2895;The graphics are great, and the fighting scenes are well choreographed.
I:14626;2896;Plus, it has a good plot/story behind it.
I:14626;2897;You're going to love it.
I:14626;2898;"personally I loved 300, I went in with the expectation that it was going to be bloody, action packed, stylish, and fun
I:14626;2899;The fight scenes are what I enjoyed the most.
I:14626;2900;The action slows down so you can see them fighting CLEARLY, which adds to the tension of battle and gives you a sort of adrenalin rush.
I:14626;2901;Entertaining show as I fancy the genre.
I:14626;2902;One of the best movies I've ever seen, and blu.
I:14626;2903;ray gives you such detail u can count the abs of actors at the back of the set and blood splatter oh so beautiful
I:14626;2904;The film does have an interesting look and the characters seemed to be leaping off the pages of a graphic novel.
I:14626;2905;win and an awesome movie to boot.
I:14626;2906;This combo disc is the one to get, I can play it anywhere.
I:14626;2907;All these guys you see in this movie.
I:14626;2908;Hope you enjoy the movie =)History is fun.
I:14626;2909;The women are hot but the various battles which take place throughout the film get increasingly better and somewhat astounding.
I:14626;2910;I can't wait for this to come out!IMPORTANT NOTICE: This disc is a high.
I:14626;2911;I am so happy I did.
I:14626;2912;This is a great movie.
I:14626;2913;"It places numbers into perspective, showing 300 elite trained spartans ""best of the best"" battling with thousands and thousands of persians."
I:14626;2914;Lots of blood spashing everywhere, lots of clever tactics 300 men working as an immense force!
I:14626;2915;"Ok this will give you a taste of what your in for, enjoy and look out for the ""WALL"" you will know what i mean when you watch it!"
I:14626;2916;300 is not the greatest movie ever made.
I:14626;2917;Let's make that perfectly clear from the get.
I:14626;2918;It is, however, visually breathtaking and filled with depth and clarity and lots and lots of fantastic images.
I:14626;2919;god Xerces, Leonidis manages to hold his own with the Sparta brand of killing.
I:14626;2920;Taking it for what it's worth, 300 is a highly stylized piece of entertainment.
I:14626;2921;And a hunchback with a funny hat.
I:14626;2922;All that is compacted into a visually stunning epic of Spartan magnitude.
I:14626;2923;If you came to see 300 expecting the new version of Citizen Kane, well.
I:14626;2924;Fantastic story and Gerald Butler was perfect for the movie!!
I:14626;2925;In the style of the Frank Miller (Sin City) comic books it works very well.
I:14626;2926;The action scenes are very well done and the story is a damn good romp.
I:14626;2927;I got this for my son who is 19 and thinks this is the best ovie ever!
I:14626;2928;It has great computer graphics.
I:14626;2929;but the story is great and has a good moral!
I:14626;2930;More of an artistic interpretation of an historical event, told from the Spartan point of view.
I:14626;2931;tall transvestite, but the casting of him as one was entertaining.
I:14626;2932;The most impressive part of the film was the visual stimulation via costumes, characters and cinematography.
I:14626;2933;The Spartan men were quite beautiful to look at, and the creative interpretation of the various Persian warrior's attire, while being historically completely off the mark, were imaginative and interesting.
I:14626;2934;In summary, the whole movie was visually stimulating, albeit extremely liberal in its historical interpretation of the actual event.
I:14626;2935;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
I:14626;2936;the movie itself is a truly great one.
I:14626;2937;Even if youre not a big fan of action movies, you should really watch this movie with an open mind and see just how much crazy stuff they can do and make look so great.
I:14626;2938;I definitely admire this movie.
I:14626;2939;If you accept that this movie is based on a graphic novel and that it's main purpose is to provide eye candy (not historical accuracy), then you will love it.
I:14626;2940;This is just pure eye candy.
I:14626;2941;Watch it and be awed by the cinematography.
I:14626;2942;Taken for what it is, 300 is a very enjoyable piece of entertainment.
I:14626;2943;Fantastic special effects, good acting, decent plot, and gory battle scenes make this a winner!!
I:14626;2944;Gets better every time I watch it!
I:14626;2945;This was a good movie.
I:14626;2946;PS Gerard Butler is sooooooo amazing!
I:14626;2947;Ladies you could watch this movie on mute and be just as happy!!!
I:14626;2948;Would recommend this movie to other adults.
I:14626;2949;Wanted to refresh my memory before going to see the new movie.
I:14626;2950;This was a great movie .
I:14626;2951;Many, me included, can produce.
I:14626;2952;That's why I compare it to The Last Samurai, its spectacular lighting, and the use of color are unmatched!I knew the movie was based on a fiction, and I'm fine with that.
I:14626;2953;But please dont take it as history.
I:14626;2954;I will laugh my *** off if this movie wins any award.
I:14626;2955;Great movie to watch over and over.
I:14626;2956;Enjoyed the historical part of this movie and the actors are great.
I:14626;2957;It was a good movie and I would recommend it to others.
I:14626;2958;based on Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name, 300 is an eye.
I:14626;2959;popping film about the ancient Battle of Thermopylae in which a vastly outnumbered Spartan army of only 300 men took a heroic stand against the powerful invading force of millions of Persians, commanded by the supposed god.
I:14626;2960;from the casting to the costuming and special effects, it's clear that the creators of this movie deliberately sought to draw the audience in and keep them riveted until the end, and at that mission they have succeeded.
I:14626;2961;This is a supremely entertaining film.300 tells the story of Sparta's king, Leonidas (played by Gerard Butler), from the brutal training he received as a young boy, to the isolation he experienced as a youth in the wilderness fighting for his life, to his triumphant return to his home, his coronation as king, and subsequent battle against the Persians who sought to dominate his people.
I:14626;2962;There's some nudity and sexuality, lots of blood, and a whole lot of death to contend with.
I:14626;2963;It's a battle epic, one that vividly depicts the barbarity of life in times of ancient war, including stylized impalements and decapitations and more.
I:14626;2964;But also be aware that there is a message of truth woven into this story, for those intrepid enough to look.
I:14626;2965;Because of the producers' loyalty to the comic book format of Miller's original story, the special effects are captivating.
I:14626;2966;it looked more like a beautifully painted work of art.
I:14626;2967;No doubt about it: the creators of 300 deliberately crafted this movie as an impressive display of visual artistry, and they succeeding in that aim.
I:14626;2968;There is a portrait of good here .
I:14626;2969;though granted it is a portrait that's a little fuzzy in places .
I:14626;2970;xerxes (portrayed with a bisexual flair by Rodrigo Santoro) is a formidable picture of evil, a stark contrast to Leonidas' goodness and bravery.
I:14626;2971;but Leonidas, a real man's man, sees right through Xerxes' lies.
I:14626;2972;He loves his wife, leads his soldiers, and doesn't shy away from even the gravest threat of danger.
I:14626;2973;His life's example was a huge inspiration and influence to the nation of Greece.
I:14626;2974;Because of her love for her husband, she makes an unwise decision that leads to death and betrayal.
I:14626;2975;in all, I was very impressed by both the artistry and storytelling of 300.
I:14626;2976;class battle epic movie without naked women and with understated violence.
I:14626;2977;"This is an entertaining and beautiful epic with a message, but the ""ballet of blood"" may be too graphic even for some grownups."
I:14626;2978;This is an incredibly focused movie: 300 soldiers fighting for freedom(pretty strait forward).
I:14626;2979;The backbone of the movie is the motivation and emotion of the spartan king.
I:14626;2980;So, while it has tons of slick CG action, the characters carry the movie to a fantastic finale.
I:14626;2981;One of the best action movies ever!!!
I:14626;2982;Great movie I enjoyed ever minute of it!
I:14626;2983;It was engaging and entertaining to watch.
I:14626;2984;300 is a spectacular action flick, one of the best movies to come along in a long time.
I:14626;2985;and perhaps that's why I can happily state that I was caught up in the frenzy and excitement and visual splendor of 300 from the opening scene to the touching ending.
I:14626;2986;king Leonidas (brilliant performance by GERARD BUTLER), is the Spartan King who must send his brave warriors to fight the huge Persian army.
I:14626;2987;He found many facets that humanize this ferocious King with an appetite for battle and he makes the most of his every moment on screen.
I:14626;2988;Snyder certainly lucked out in finding exactly the right man for the role.
I:14626;2989;and others around him are fine too.
I:14626;2990;LEONA HEADEY makes an interesting, spirited Spartan Queen, with a beautiful face and a lovely commanding presence of her own.
I:14626;2991;She's especially good in her scenes with the conniving DOMINIC WEST, as the two argue over sending a larger army against the Persian hordes.
I:14626;2992;Their final confrontation is a shocker.
I:14626;2993;visually, the film is an artistic achievement that makes stunning use of the CGI and blending it with the studio shots in a way that resembles murals and famous works of art.
I:14626;2994;This is one aspect of the film that is easily guaranteed to earn Oscar nominations in technical categories.
I:14626;2995;Snyder has done a fantastic job.
I:14626;2996;Frank Miller's comic properties have become ripe for the picking lately (Sin City was a smash with a sequel on the way, and Ronin was just optioned as well), and his epic dramatization of the Battle of Thermopylae is brilliantly brought to the screen by Zack Snyder (2004's Dawn of the Dead, the upcoming Watchmen) with enough style to spare.
I:14626;2997;With it's innovative blend of live action and CGI effects and techniques, 300 manages to stay surprisingly faithful to it's comic book material (including shot by shot references to Miller's artwork) while Snyder adds a political sub.
I:14626;2998;The visual style is worth seeing 300 for alone even if you're not a fan of Miller's graphic novel, and the cast (which also includes the narrating David Wenham and The Wire's Dominic West) is great as well.
I:14626;2999;"I've got to hand it to Zack Snyder
I:14626;3000;Movie was exactly what I thought it would be: a story put to film.
I:14626;3001;The story is based on a deranged comic book writer who views history from an us versus them point of view and somehow decides that Greek culture is western culture.
I:14626;3002;it is basically a comic book made into a film and should appeal to those who view death and destruction as a past.
I:14626;3003;Story line and fight scenes were done well.
I:14626;3004;Such a great movie, it's definitely a gem for history buffs.
I:14626;3005;By far the greatest movie ever made.
I:14626;3006;The Spartans are portrayed as freedom loving men who must fight to the last man against the Persian hordes who intend to enslave them (although this portrayal has been claimed to be somewhat historically inaccurate).
I:14626;3007;The rest of the film involves the subsequent battle that ensues, in which the 300 must fight to the last man, greatly outnumbered.
I:14626;3008;hardy Spartans, who easily defeat them.
I:14626;3009;this movie is a decent film that reflects on the history of ancient Greece.
I:14626;3010;The imagery is unique and it is probably worth watching for that alone.
I:14626;3011;While the movie may be slow in parts, in that it is simply one battle scene after another, it probably deserves to be watched simply for its imagery and for the historical value.
I:14626;3012;stunning, like the critics said.
I:14626;3013;Also an important movie depicting a history.
I:14626;3014;What a breath taking movie.
I:14626;3015;Each time I see it, It continues to capitivate me.
I:14626;3016;interesting view of a true historical event.
I:14626;3017;buta cinematic pleasure to the eye
I:14626;3018;Everything about it was good.
I:14626;3019;I thought the movie was action packed and warriors and special effects were awesome.
I:14626;3020;The movie showed love,compassion and loyalty for a common cause.
I:14626;3021;Not sure how historically accurate or true to the original story this is and not a fan of fight/war films, but that aside, this is a sight to behold.
I:14626;3022;"Have you ever watched a movie with an epic battle and said to yourself, ""wow that was great I wish it were abit longer though."""
I:14626;3023;I always thought that with the battles in Return of the King and Gladiator.
I:14626;3024;Do not sit down to this movie thinking you will get a history lesson about the intricacies about Spartan culture.300 is very stylized, very graphic, very slick in it's presentation.
I:14626;3025;If you have not seen this movie get ready for a wild ride.
I:14626;3026;The history behind the story is miraculous.
I:14626;3027;If you are in the mood for a lot of violence, and prefer fantasy to history, then this movie is a lot of fun.
I:14626;3028;It is based on a comic book, and you can almost see the comic book frames in the movie, for example in the fight scenes which alternately speed up and slow down, and in the otherworldly processing of the colors.
I:14626;3029;There is a lot of testosterone.
I:14626;3030;The movie breaks up the epic battle scenes with scenes of political maneuvering back in Sparta.
I:14626;3031;ray did the best parts of 300 justice: felt like we were in the theater again.
I:14626;3032;up thrill ride of a movie, 300 gets the blood pumping.
I:14626;3033;The movie's much more concerned with fidelity to Miller's graphic novel (at least visually) and being a great spectacle.
I:14626;3034;Go into it hoping to be entertained, and you'll leave happy.
I:14626;3035;the visual achievements of this film are inspiring, and Gerard Butler completely sells the role of Leonidas.
I:14626;3036;The Spartans have been fabled as some of the best strategic and well trained soldiers in all of Greek history.
I:14626;3037;line it, this really brings you into their way of life.
I:14626;3038;If you're expecting something that will just blow you away with superb acting, deep characters and a thick and juicy plot.
I:14626;3039;in short, this is a very energetic revival of the fabled Spartans with a lot of help from 21st century technology.
I:14626;3040;300 is an example of a Director so obsessed with the technical aspects of the film that he forgets the most important ingredient, that of the performances.
I:14626;3041;the acting in the film is dire.
I:14626;3042;Young Directors in love with Technical craft seem unaware of the Actor and his all important performance.
I:14626;3043;like commentary by Zack Snyder gives the game away.
I:14626;3044;Very good action film, well worth a look.
I:14626;3045;It works fine on my EU PS3.
I:14626;3046;Visually, this movie is stunning.
I:14626;3047;Every scene is eye candy for the audience and it is that.
I:14626;3048;more than anything else that holds your attention.
I:14626;3049;For the first time, Dominic West put in a good performance.
I:14626;3050;good show though) Gerald Butler was excellent as well as Santoro.
I:14626;3051;Overall: good entertainment, but like I always say.
I:14626;3052;gerard Butler leads the cast as King Leonidas who must balance his love for his men with Spartan ideals of courage and freedom.
I:14626;3053;All actors, save one (played by Andrew Tiernan), have gorgeous faces and bodies.
I:14626;3054;Butler and Heady are suitable in their roles, as is everyone.
I:14626;3055;He is gorgeous, but bombastically (and intentionally) overblown.
I:14626;3056;At first inspiring awe, his eight foot tall stature and deep voice over soon invoke laughter.
I:14626;3057;"dominic West, as the duplicitous ""realist"" Theron, is a standout."
I:14626;3058;fight scenes are exciting, visuals are gorgeous, and dialogue is full of lame but arguable catchy one.
I:14626;3059;300 had elements of intrigue, amazement, beautiful cinematography, and despicable death scenes to boot.
I:14626;3060;This version of the historical story of the 300 Spartans from Sparta is the most modern up to date film loaded with CGI (computer generated imagery) special effects.
I:14626;3061;300 was made by Warner Brothers Pictures in association with Legendary Pictures and Virtual Studios.
I:14626;3062;"The music for ""300"" was beautifully orchestrated and perceived by Tyler Bates, who is fairly new but is on his way to bigger and better films."
I:14626;3063;He has the drive and potential to be up with other big names on a high award level.
I:14626;3064;It was nominated in roughly 5 categories in the MTV Movie Awards and won for Best Fight for Gerard Butler's King Leonidas battle with an Immortal creature.
I:14626;3065;I sense his masterpiece in music is yet to come.
I:14626;3066;The only other element this picture had, other than its great use of blue screen and green screen, was its gorgeous locations and cinematography.
I:14626;3067;It is award worthy for its amazing special effects but I can't get myself to say anything worthy of this movie more than that.
I:14626;3068;First, this film, made visibly on a great scale, was shot in just 60 days.
I:14626;3069;In order to efficiently present themselves as a well.
I:14626;3070;Also, in the well shot and planned scene of the Oracle and its elegant flowing effect was oddly accomplished by filming the actress underwater.
I:14626;3071;First this is a pretty good movie, especially if you like action movies with a fare amount of gore.
I:14626;3072;Word of their bravery and strength spreads throughout the Hellenic Empire and their story becomes a legend.300 is a modern classic, a violent and beautiful tale of men who refuse to surrender to a totalitarian regime.
I:14626;3073;It is a war movie with a surreal feel, it is a story that is steeped in mythos, and every chapter of this tale is lavishly brought to the screen in a movie that is as visually stunning as it is compelling.
I:14626;3074;"Gerard Butler is bold, butch and brilliant as Leonidas
I:14626;3075;In addition, David Wehham's narration superbly knits together epic battles, traitors and political corruption.
I:14626;3076;in short, 300 is a visually stunning classic that is filled with brains and brawn.
I:14626;3077;Saw it at the theater.
I:14626;3078;The actors are hot, the story is great, and I love the battle scenes!
I:14626;3079;Definitely on my list of classics!
I:14626;3080;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:14626;3081;so glad I got it at a great price.
I:14626;3082;I highly recommend this movie.
I:14626;3083;Watched it twice the day he got it.
I:14626;3084;wanting to watch the movie on high resolution bought this blu ray disc but in return i got grainy picture.
I:14626;3085;Neither is it especially realistic.
I:14626;3086;what 300 does present is an action.
I:14626;3087;snobs will hate it (and I am a history snob so don't bother flaming me) but 300 is still appealing on several levels.
I:14626;3088;"most striking was the cinematography
I:14626;3089;As for plot . . . well, the story is what it is.
I:14626;3090;It's a great story even without all the special effects and fanciful heroics.
I:14626;3091;I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.
I:14626;3092;It doesn't have the best story and acting, but if you like that type, this is the best of the genre.
I:14626;3093;The documentary portions discussing ancient Greek culture were fascinating as well.
I:14626;3094;took a little long to get here but I did recieve it and its in good condition thank you!
I:14626;3095;This is the most beautifully filmed, stunning movie I have ever seen.
I:14626;3096;true to the comic, I was in awe of this when I finally saw it.
I:14626;3097;I was blown away by this film, as a photographer I thought it was spectacular to look at and the acting was passionate and genuine.
I:14626;3098;An amazing blend of fantasy and history, action and drama.
I:14626;3099;The battle scenes were amazing the oracle scene was just gorgeously visualized and the plot kept you cheering for the Spartans from beginning to end, even though anyone who knows the true story knows how it ends.
I:14626;3100;The greatest movie ever made!!!!!!!
I:14626;3101;latest masculine action movie I've seen.
I:14626;3102;Overall, an entertaining reminder that war is part of humankind until the end of time.
I:14626;3103;my friends and I who went to see this really ended up laughing through most of this film.
I:14626;3104;the Spartans are the reasonable people in the world, fighting for freedom and justice.
I:14626;3105;Many of these things, I'm sure, are pretty accurate concerning Spartan society.
I:14626;3106;Movie arrived on time and was excellent.
I:14626;3107;LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie and all that it represents: LOVE, RESPECT, VALUES, PROTECTION, HONOR, AND TRUST!
I:14626;3108;This is a movie I will keep in my archive!
I:14626;3109;I loved the movie in the theaters, I really do believe they have improved the movie with this Blu.
I:14626;3110;always a fan of the greek movies this is right up there with troy and clash of the titans instan classic
I:14626;3111;300 may perhaps be the most blatant and pure expression of Fascism from the US film industry in the last 10 years, which is saying a lot.
I:14626;3112;And thoughtless hero worship is the political substitute for government.
I:14626;3113;"To be fair, in pursuit of the graphic novel feel, 300"" does look good."
I:14626;3114;And that is exactly what this movie is, a cinematic display of the essence of Fascism.
I:14626;3115;In fact, a group of soldiers two rows in front of me at the theater understood the film's political message quite well.
I:14626;3116;What else can I say, also has great sound.
I:14626;3117;All around, it is a great movie for the eyes and ears.
I:14626;3118;My friend loves this movie.
I:14626;3119;She has watched it over and over.
I:14626;3120;Movies are supposed to be entertaining and 300 delivers.
I:14626;3121;It will create an interest in history, something that is missing from today's youngsters.
I:14626;3122;I bought this for my nephew for Christmas and He was thrilled to get it.
I:14626;3123;But every frame of the movie is just beautiful.
I:14626;3124;Everybody looks cool in a cape!
I:14626;3125;It is a great motivator and pick.
I:14626;3126;All of the blood and gore are tempered by the great filming style of this film .
I:14626;3127;anything he is in I will watchHe is a man mangood actor all that is required for a good show
I:14626;3128;I ordered 300 widescreen edition.
I:14626;3129;In order to shock or thrill, does each new action movie have to top the previous?
I:14626;3130;Certainly Kurusawa films STILL have more exciting and imaginatively shot scenes, with only a fraction of the blood.
I:14626;3131;Today, these cinematic video games are the main fare of American movies!
I:14626;3132;If you want to see a much better film, a fantasy film full of graphic violence, but also with fine acting, dialogue, direction, photography, editing, costuming, music and non.
I:14626;3133;cGI special effects, treat yourself to John Boorman's 1981 Arthurian epic, 'Excalibur' (and skip any of the recent Arthurian movies, and Beowulf).
I:14626;3134;The visual effects, and the color scheme do look good.
I:14626;3135;It's pretty faithful to the book, which I loved, so I really wanted to love this as well.
I:14626;3136;I would give it 0 stars if I could.
I:14626;3137;Well it was awesome, and the action/fight scenes in this movie are breathtaking.
I:14626;3138;Inspirational, full of action and captivating film.
I:14626;3139;Gerard butler is amazing as king leonides.
I:14626;3140;Awesome sound effects, thrilling scenes and dialogues.
I:14626;3141;Butler was well buffed for the part, and his stunt work was amazing.
I:14626;3142;It was so well done and the colors came right off the graphic novel.
I:14626;3143;Thanks Zack for having confidence in Gerry!
I:14626;3144;You both did a great job!
I:14626;3145;First time I watched it I laughed at it a lot.
I:14626;3146;The true heroism of those Spartans was completely destroyed by this film.
I:14626;3147;There you will have a more realistic approach, fantastic documentary.
I:14626;3148;ray and I have to say it's one of the grainiest Blu.
I:14626;3149;don't get me wrong, the movie is great.
I:14626;3150;I've seen it a million times and it's always entertaining but I'm just reviewing this movie from at Blu.
I:14626;3151;Saw this originally and loved it.
I:14626;3152;love the actions and drama of the movie!
I:14626;3153;Looks good and places well happy with everything about it and it got here on time which is always a plus.
I:14626;3154;And you should see it that way, too, if you have the chance.
I:14626;3155;the one with the awesome home theater system.
I:14626;3156;But IMAX also offers superior sound.
I:14626;3157;If you try to make the comparisons to the great movies in this genre, you will be off base.
I:14626;3158;300 was a set of books, well a set of graphic novels (there is an important distinction), by Frank Miller which he wrote as his adaptation of the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC.
I:14626;3159;In graphic novels, often times you watch it happen.
I:14626;3160;And it is not always violence, but there is a greater degree of grown.
I:14626;3161;It looks like an exciting movie about a few battles with 300 men in peak physical condition.
I:14626;3162;Oh, and there is an incredible amount of (computer.
I:14626;3163;Go see it and enjoy it as much as I did.
I:14626;3164;ray version of the movie with my 13.
I:14626;3165;Yeah right,I'm sure that's exactly what people said back then.
I:14626;3166;Like Troy and Beowulf, here was the opportunity to create a solid movie on an interesting story.
I:14626;3167;Pizza and popcorn worthy move.
I:14626;3168;Fast moving, decent to good acting and easily enjoyable.
I:14626;3169;but if you can see past that, or rather, see the sheer beauty and artistry in every shot, than you'll be able to really appreciate this movie a lot more.
I:14626;3170;Because all this is mere eye candy to help express the underlying character sketch of a lost society where honor, freedom, courage, and human dignity were the pillars.
I:14626;3171;Where the citizens walked free and proud under the sun, unafraid.
I:14626;3172;if you live in a society that believes in freedom and fights to defend it and to ensure that those who live under slavery and fear are liberated, that is the purpose of our society.
I:14626;3173;that ideology combined with the incredibly inspiring story of these 300's bravery in the face of overwhelming odds is what makes this movie so personal.
I:14626;3174;"Am I going to let it take away my freedom?"""
I:14626;3175;Because let me tell you, if you let your circumstance control your actions or your faith and belief in yourself, you have made yourself it's slave.
I:14626;3176;There are so many elements that I love about it.
I:14626;3177;As aforementioned, the artistry is incredible.
I:14626;3178;In fact, I think it's the best performances I've seen from either Gerard Butler (Leonidas) or David Wenham (Dilios, the narrator).
I:14626;3179;I especially loved Lena Headey's character (Queen Gorgo).
I:14626;3180;I loved how she is just as personally strong as the soldiers to show that the strength was a part of the entire society, not just the military.
I:14626;3181;She is treated with respect out of love: the citizens don't drop to the ground as she passes them in the street, but they acknowledge her with respect as a human being.
I:14626;3182;Great way to show that manly men don't need to keep their wives under their thumb.
I:14626;3183;And also that great men usually have a great woman behind them.
I:14626;3184;There are so many incredible lines full of inspiration and truth.
I:14626;3185;What must a king do to save his world.
I:14626;3186;driven guy movie full of blood and boobs.
I:14626;3187;But it is so much more than that.
I:14626;3188;packed story, unbelievable artistry, and a moral that will inspire you to greatness, then Spartan, prepare for glory!
I:14626;3189;"This movie was as good as ""triumph of the will""."
I:14626;3190;"it was as enjoyable as watching ""The Birth of a Nation""."
I:14626;3191;"in that kind of way!Quote:Frank Miller's graphic novel into film that the mass of ""Asian hordes"" facing the brave 300 in the movie were depicted as retards, at times half."
I:14626;3192;animal, at times plague faced, and, yes, at times black.
I:14626;3193;This in contrast with the impeccably gorgeous, athletic, free.
I:14626;3194;"spirited, and brave white men that make up the members of the ""300"" speaks volumes."
I:14626;3195;"another oneQuote:""It's funny how modern politics can usurp and transform our understanding of history/myth."
I:14626;3196;"Sparta was painted as the evil ""communist"" empire and Athens was the land of freedom, democracy and all that stuff."
I:14626;3197;High drama, generally amazing effects and a fantastic back story.
I:14626;3198;Then kind sir listen to me!
I:14626;3199;It doesn't interst me at all,but he loves it.
I:14626;3200;Very few times does film do justice to literature.
I:14626;3201;The Battle of Thermopylae is history at its best when ordinary men do the most extraordinary things and become what Legends are made of.
I:14626;3202;"This ""history"" was written in a ""comic book"" format which became ""300""."
I:14626;3203;He told me I HAD to see this movie!
I:14626;3204;"I always did like my history ""Ancient""."
I:14626;3205;the first time, the sheer spectacle of the movie's photography took my breath away.
I:14626;3206;The third time I began to pick up the play of emotions on the cast's faces and interplay between the characters.
I:14626;3207;All I can say is so far, we've watched it 7 times and each time see things we missed.
I:14626;3208;After the first time, we bought the movie as a permanent addition to our collection.
I:14626;3209;"But if you are of sterner ""adult"" stuff, you NEED to see this movie."
I:14626;3210;"gerard Butler ""TimeLine"", ""Reign of Fire"", and ""Phantom of the Opera""(new)makes an impressive King Leonidas even with the Scottish lilt to his voice."
I:14626;3211;"if you liked those others, you'll LOVE ""300"" as well!"
I:14626;3212;This is a movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen.
I:14626;3213;For those of us that had seen Robert Rodriquez's rendition of Sin City, 300's presentation is arguably more poetic or romantic with its brown grainy hue.
I:14626;3214;Every frames seemed to be well defined and planned and they are achingly beautiful to watch.
I:14626;3215;top masculinity of this movie.
I:14626;3216;Gerald Butler once again proves his versatility in playing varying and memorable roles.
I:14626;3217;David Wenham, an Australian is effective as the narrator to this movie.
I:14626;3218;Kudos go to the whole team for being able to come out with such a slick production especially when the actors and actresses are only been given a backdrop of green or blue screen and imagination to bring 300 to the fore.
I:14626;3219;Highly recommended and an unmissable experience!
I:14626;3220;This is the best history in the movie.
I:14626;3221;i'm not going to write one of those 10,000 word reviews to defend every point, but I have read more about the Spartans and the Persian Wars than any other military subject, and this is my favorite movie and yet I know that could have been several times greater because the actual history is that much more impressive.
I:14626;3222;Yet it is pulled together in a balance of weight and seriousness, and the elements of escapism and brutality actually complement each other here.
I:14626;3223;Were it all highly detailed and painstakingly realistic, it might be too laborious to view (unless you wanted a visual history), and were it more fantasy based it would belong in the Star Wars section (and no 'non.
I:14626;3224;I cringed occassionally at the obviously digital effects on screen, but as a whole this was a VERY interesting movie that I definitely enjoyed watching and would watch again.
I:14626;3225;the characters were respectable, believable and dignified, even though they are made to entertain us.
I:14626;3226;the digital effects and scenery were rich and artistic, while being dark and non.
I:14626;3227;dreamy effect that played on the imagination and senses and made the viewing experince more rich, without the need for over the top tricks or scenes.
I:14626;3228;this is a very sensuous film, all sexual elements aside.
I:14626;3229;product arrived safely and in excellent condition.
I:14626;3230;Which is what it was supposed to be like and it did it very well.
I:14626;3231;while I can't recommend it to anyone looking for substance in a movie, I can recommend it for a someone looking for mindless, gratuitous violence and a good laugh.
I:14626;3232;Its a good movie, but it came in bad conditions, it looks like it was touched with something hot, because it is melted in the front cover.
I:14626;3233;If you've never heard the true story of the battle of Thermopylae, then by all means watch this movie.
I:14626;3234;You'll enjoy it, you may even love it.
I:14626;3235;Once you know the true story, it's impossible to fully enjoy this movie.
I:14626;3236;intense battle seqences!Nicely done visuals.
I:14626;3237;overall: This is a great movie if you're a woman, since pretty much the whole movie consists of nothing but muscular Greek men running about half naked.
I:14626;3238;And if you've never heard the true story, then you'll probably enjoy this movie.
I:14626;3239;"Gladiator""Brave Heart""The Last Samurai""The Mummy""The Mummy Returns""The Scorpion KingOverall Rating: 1.9 starsWith that said, come back, MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000)."
I:14626;3240;In fact 300 freely borrows its soundtrack, dramatic presence and iconic imagery from that film.
I:14626;3241;Stirring story, good battle sequences and solid acting.
I:14626;3242;The film carries itself like a true Spartan .
I:14626;3243;Nothing to dislike about that!
I:14626;3244;on nail porn star wannabes.
I:14626;3245;The queen has a realistic bosom and even a few faint lines on her face!
I:14626;3246;It's nice to be able to see ourselves.
I:14626;3247;Interesting CGI, giving the movie a deep, dark, from.
I:14626;3248;There is lots to enjoy in the cinematography.
I:14626;3249;there's plenty in here for us, too!
I:14626;3250;300 goes for the entire deep end and gives us an over the top, glorious, OPERATIC, no.
I:14626;3251;holds barred depiction of being an ancient warrior.
I:14626;3252;top, and utterly insane depiction of war that will appeal to any guy's inner warrior.
I:14626;3253;This is as simple as a depiction of war you can get.
I:14626;3254;These men are made to kill, and protect their country with honor, and nothing else.
I:14626;3255;Yeah, it's occasionally silly, and it's definitely not a movie to be taken seriously.
I:14626;3256;anyway, 300 is essentially a fanciful, operatic re.
I:14626;3257;What is largely an ordinary war story is brought to life in honor, a fantastic, stylized, epic re.
I:14626;3258;imagining, filled with monsters, lot's of blood and thunder, bombastic musical scores, high use of stylized violence, and beautiful, sepia.
I:14626;3259;The feel is a bit hard to describe, and I can metaphor this with everything from God Of War (awesome game series by the way) to Clash of the Titans, but it wouldn't matter anyway.
I:14626;3260;All you will have to do is see for yourself and you'll know what I mean.
I:14626;3261;everybody knows what makes 300 stand out is it's style.
I:14626;3262;screen visuals are visually stunning, that shine with a golden glow, heightening the operatic and bombastic style of the film.
I:14626;3263;edge, visually dazzling elements, eye candy as the best kind.
I:14626;3264;The score is a bit varied, but it's always colorful, operatic, and animated to make this movie as over the top and crazy as possible.
I:14626;3265;It's mostly hand to hand combat.
I:14626;3266;Spartans must have been quite a pretty crowd.
I:14626;3267;(OK, I made that last part up .
I:14626;3268;I enjoy a good blood bath now and then.
I:14626;3269;i thought this film had remarkable artistry and vision that left the viewer in awe.
I:14626;3270;One notable scene is a seamless shots of the protagonist steadily advancing through 20 opponants.
I:14626;3271;this is the world I have created.you'd better believe it and you really do.
I:14626;3272;It came in perfect shape and it works great.
I:14626;3273;it is a very good movie and we saw it in the theater when it came out.
I:14626;3274;It is very well done.
I:14626;3275;This movie is very well done, but relies heavily on special effects.
I:14626;3276;The cinematography is very comicbookish with some kind of digital effects throughout most of the movie.
I:14626;3277;That said, this movie is fantastically done and is very entertaining to watch.
I:14626;3278;It is the classic story of right, might and corruption in politics with the selfless sacrifice triumphing over evil.
I:14626;3279;For folks who are fascinated by this film and wonder how it is done, this is an excellent edition.
I:14626;3280;Particularly informative are the features on the Spartans themselves and how the actors were transformed into fighters of that ilk.
I:14626;3281;The commentaries from the director and Frank Miller are interesting, especially for artists and budding filmmakers.
I:14626;3282;"The ""plot"" made most Falcon films seem deep."
I:14626;3283;He loves this movie and went nuts for it on Blu.
I:14626;3284;This was the first time that I had tried watching something on my kindle and it was great.
I:14626;3285;Action packed and thrilling all the way through.
I:14626;3286;The movie is beautiful and while it isn't a very deep movie, you will enjoy the ride!
I:14626;3287;Much much better than both the Alexander and Troy movies (1 stars movies) .
I:14626;3288;nevertheless, it is a good movie and entertaining which should inspire people to read about the history and how the Persian Wars were key to the outcome of Western civilization.
I:14626;3289;and it was a great deal that got here FAST.
I:14626;3290;This movie was great in the theater and even better on my plasma.
I:14626;3291;The movie is based on true historical events and possesses those timeless aspects of love, betrayal, honor, courage, bravery in the face of insurmountable odds, and oh yeah .
I:14626;3292;kick *ss fighting for the good cause, that make a story great.
I:14626;3293;I found the stylized cinematography of the movie suited it perfectly, and in fact ramped up the drama.
I:14626;3294;It has a rock 'n roll edge, but with lots of substance and heart.
I:14626;3295;The actors were perfectly cast and delivered outstanding and powerful performances that move you.
I:14626;3296;I also really liked Queen Gorgo, a very strong female character who her husband admires, adores, and listens to, and who does what she can to fight for her family and her people.
I:14626;3297;See ladies, this movie's got barrels of enjoyment for you, too!
I:14626;3298;"
I:14626;3299;This is the kind of gift that art/entertainment can bring that makes it so important .
I:14626;3300;it inspires us to aim high, to make our lives meaningful and to never settle, never give up, never give in.
I:14626;3301;A modern classic that engulfs you
I:14626;3302;I watched it 3 times in the theatre, once in IMAX, and now I have it in Blue Ray.
I:14626;3303;The picture is amazing, as is the sound.
I:14626;3304;300 is a war/action movie portraying the struggle of free men against a God King tyrant.
I:14626;3305;A comic book brought to life.
I:14626;3306;This is the best movie ever.
I:14626;3307;sure its not Casablanca or the Godfather, but honestly, while those are great dramas, and well watched for the content, 300 as a movie is the pinnacle of the action genre.
I:14626;3308;Its pure entertainment, and will leave you gasping, panting and hungering for more.
I:14626;3309;if movie companies want to make movies that epitomize a genre, they should look to 300's pureness of spirit as a beacon to light the way.
I:14626;3310;If one rates this as a comparison to Frank Miller's graphic novel by the same name then the director/producer did a pretty good job.
I:14626;3311;That would be a good movie.
I:14626;3312;A movie like 300, which is known for it's amazing cinematography fantasy effects, should be blowing you away.
I:14626;3313;I originally had a bad disc, but Amazon was very quick to ship me a new one out and it works great.
I:14626;3314;Its commentary on the War On Terror is, I think, unintended.
I:14626;3315;the look of the film captures the feel of the comic artistry, its straight forward storyline fallows that of the limited series with the same title (loosely based on the Greek/Persian Wars).
I:14626;3316;"It much more effective than Miller's other comic translated to film, ""Sin City"", because this film has both a heart and a meaningful message."
I:14626;3317;As I said above it is frame.
I:14626;3318;You also feel the love and camaraderie of the soldiers to each other and Leonidas to his wife.
I:14626;3319;And most importantly, their dedication to what is right versus what is easy.
I:14626;3320;with all the wonder creative and computer artistry in the film, they couldn't have come up with a better design?
I:14626;3321;"With all the said, I still salute director Zack Snyder's effort and plan to see ""300"" at least one more time on the IMAX screen."
I:14626;3322;I love the movie and have it on Blu.
I:14626;3323;When I got it, I played it a half.
I:14626;3324;this movie is truely a Frank Miller comic come to life.
I:14626;3325;the extra pip feature showing the film as shot in studio compared to the theatrical release is well done.
I:14626;3326;I personally wanted to see the movie about one of the best known battles in human history and the bravery of the Greeks from Sparta.
I:14626;3327;Battle of Themopylae has ben immortalized in history, myth and legend.
I:14626;3328;In this film, I liked the sly humor of these manly man.
I:14626;3329;There are portrayed not only as a brave and selfless soldiers, but they get to show us that they are smart and witty too.
I:14626;3330;Their women are strong and there is a sense of purpose to their lives .
I:14626;3331;The movie (and the actual historical event) is about fight for democracy and ideals at any cost, it is a lesson to humankind and its protagonists rightly so deserve their place in history.
I:14626;3332;I personally loved the movie, but I would say that it is intended for mature audience.
I:14626;3333;"It is a great story and they had a solid cast to work with
I:14626;3334;this movie is all about the Battle of Thermopylae, and is relatively historically accurate.
I:14626;3335;the story at home is also well done, and i love the queen standing up to all the morons in the council.
I:14626;3336;lots of killing, good sex scene, constant action.
I:14626;3337;Leonidis shows his leadership skills an how when you fight as a united unit you are strong.
I:14626;3338;I just got back from seeing a 7:15 screening of this movie, and I must say.
I:14626;3339;It was the best movie I ever saw.
I:14626;3340;Now, it's up to him and his army of 300 brave men.
I:14626;3341;this is ultimately an epic story told on a SWEEPING scale.
I:14626;3342;The visuals are cool, the cinematography is amazing, and the story is apocryphal with an ending with King Leonidas' self.
I:14626;3343;Stii one the most action packed movies I've seen the last few years.
I:14626;3344;Acting was great, the download never lagged and it was just a great movie
I:14626;3345;For those of you who haven't seen this film, and want to know if the trip is worth it: The Answer is YES!
I:14626;3346;The film is an amazing achievement for popcorn flicks, epics, and visual effects alike.
I:14626;3347;The digital backdrops are worth the price of admission alone, and the battles have enough flying limbs and gore to make a butcher cringe.
I:14626;3348;This is an action film aimed at mixing amazing visuals with stunning fights.
I:14626;3349;This is a great theatrical experience, and will not dissapoint if you know what to expect.
I:14626;3350;There are mutants, gods, and other mythical creatures from the comics!
I:14626;3351;"if you enjoy epic action films like ""Gladiator"" or ""Lord of the Rings"", unique visual films like ""Sin City"" or the recent ""Fountain"", or just want a fun time with some friends, ""300"" will be the right choice for you."
I:14626;3352;This film is brilliant because it succeeds so well at what it tried to accomplish, and that is being a stylish action film.
I:14626;3353;Go see it, have fun, and then see it again.
I:14626;3354;300 may well have been based on actual historical events, but it certainly isn't about historical accuracy.
I:14626;3355;"This is a really, really beautiful movie to watch, and as a piece of cinema, is infinitely more rewarding than ""Sin City""."
I:14626;3356;It's more creative, more lush, and far more confident in its execution.
I:14626;3357;"but once the battle scenes at Thermopylae begin in earnest, the incredible skill of Director Snyder at showcasing the beauty and artistry of Bissel's and Wilkinson's work kicks in, and ""300"" works best during these sumptuous, grisly battle sequences."
I:14626;3358;Also, the Harry Potterishness of the Wolf notwithstanding, the special effects are really excellent, and set a whole new standard with what can be accomplished outside of the totally computer.
I:14626;3359;back, they'd have found more success as devices with which to forward the plot .
I:14626;3360;which brings me neatly to the acting .
I:14626;3361;"i can't recommend ""300"" as a really great movie ."
I:14626;3362;I certainly did during those bits.
I:14626;3363;The famous director Howard Hawks was once asked for his definition of a good movie.
I:14626;3364;300 generally makes the grade , but the charging Rhinoceros thing just gave me a big belly laugh.
I:14626;3365;The Death Throes of the brave 300 is well done and is the coda to the entire film.
I:14626;3366;It is entertaining and well made.
I:14626;3367;Acting is good considering the limitations of the source material and it is well casted.
I:14626;3368;My wife and I are middle aged and we liked it , it's guilty pleasure , throw some extra butter on your corn and relax, it's a pretty good movie.
I:14626;3369;They make some good points.
I:14626;3370;"Without the digital copy, the special edition really isn't worth the extra expense even with the ""extra"" material."
I:14626;3371;If you just want to watch the movie and don't care about out takes and the documentaries about director's vision (you can see the director's vision when you're watching the final cut of the movie), stick to the regular edition of the blu.
I:14626;3372;It's the same great sound and picture as the special edition, but less expense.
I:14626;3373;This is by far one of the best movies I have ever watched, this is art in motion.
I:14626;3374;I wholeheartedly enjoyed 300 because the movie works on so many levels.
I:14626;3375;It has the action, stunning visuals, and most importantly a story that sticks with you long after the credits roll.
I:14626;3376;Who wouldn't enjoy a movie about freedom, sacrifice, loss, honor, nation, and all the ideals that our western civilization is based on.300 is quintessentially impassioned film making that actually has something to say about society and I highly recommend it.
I:14626;3377;This is a movie that will stand the test of time.
I:14626;3378;Parts of it are almost dream.
I:14626;3379;like, in a very beautiful way.
I:14626;3380;Very, very good, well worth owning.
I:14626;3381;This is the best movie of all times.
I:14626;3382;There are two sides to this.
I:14626;3383;the movie is done well and the story telling is epic.
I:14626;3384;In fact it looked perfectly fine.
I:14626;3385;loaded look at the Battle of Thermopylae, one of history's most lopsided and impressive battles, as 300 Spartan elite soldiers, supported by others, held back the Persian invasion forces for days, allowing Greece to prepare its greater forces to repel the invasion.
I:14626;3386;It's light, if gory, action fare, and I found it enjoyable, and it also inspired me to hours of refreshing my recollections of the Greek and Persian Wars, which were very interesting to me when I was much younger.
I:14626;3387;I think it is a decent movie if you like history/war movies and also comic book adaptations.
I:14626;3388;The image was much improved even using an Onkyo up converting to 1080i.
I:14626;3389;The sound effects are great on 7.1.
I:14626;3390;The battle scenes sounded top notch.
I:14626;3391;And of course Gerard Butler half naked definitely helps keep your attn.
I:14626;3392;The Cast brings the story of 300 that Frank Miller wrote to life.
I:14626;3393;It's story of Freedom inspires you to watch even the most drenching parts.
I:14626;3394;Well written, exceptional action, good plot that appeals to men and women with some love story storyline and a good amount of well done fight scenes.
I:14626;3395;This is an awesome action.
I:14626;3396;Still, this has riveting and gory battle sequences that should not be missed!It is said that this battle saved Democracy and Europe.
I:14626;3397;the film uses a lot of CGI, and I mean A LOT.
I:14626;3398;Gerard Butler is very good as King Leonidas, and many of the other characters come through also.
I:14626;3399;The phalanx fighting is quite good, although there's a fair bit of sword play as well.
I:14626;3400;all, pretty good but not perfect by any means.
I:14626;3401;300, the latest entry into the genre of futuristic films, is another adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novels.
I:14626;3402;Still, 300 accomplishes what Zach Snyder set out to do, and that is create a visual masterpiece.
I:14626;3403;gerard Butler gives a solid performance as King Leonidas, the man who leads 300 Spartans into battle against 250,000 Persians led by Xerxes, a king who fancies himself a god.
I:14626;3404;overall, though 300 is simple, it accomplishes what it sets out to do, and is the most beautiful film (to look at, that is) I've ever seen.
I:14626;3405;300 is unabashedly violent, and takes advantage of the viewers' excitement during the battle sequences by making half of the film slow motion fight scenes.
I:14626;3406;300 is witty and exciting, one of the most enjoyable films of the 21st century, and makes 2 hours go by like 2 minutes.
I:14626;3407;The story of the Spartans comes to life in this awesome blu ray.
I:14626;3408;The movie is great but it would have been nice if I could share it with my father.
I:14626;3409;I recommend it to all action fans.
I:14626;3410;Visually stunning and thoroughly entertaining.
I:14626;3411;inspiring graphic novel 300 with a groan.
I:14626;3412;"frame"", and I got even more excited."
I:14626;3413;I figured we were in for something fantastic.
I:14626;3414;Nine months or no, an hour into this movie, I knew I was in the presence of greatness.
I:14626;3415;The majority of this movie is fantastic.
I:14626;3416;A lot of the ideas that were extended also worked.
I:14626;3417;When you kept the movie on the battlefield, it was great.
I:14626;3418;More important is the fact that the entire development.
I:14626;3419;Then came Ubermortal, and, well, you blew it.
I:14626;3420;but man, let's take a look at the way that message fits in with everything else in that scene, and let's examine (a) the way Frank Miller equates sensuality with evil in the graphic novel.
I:14626;3421;sensuality theme coupled with the injection of a scene of Leonidas and Gorgo making love, smile a bit sadly, and move on.
I:14626;3422;They know what to do with their sharp claws!
I:14626;3423;"You even keep in that bit of Dilios' voiceover after Gorgo delivers one of my favorite lines in the novel: ""Spartan!"
I:14626;3424;So this disc you can pack up and watch it over at your best friends house on his 27 inch CRT TV that he bought for $1200 in 1990.
I:14626;3425;the movie is worth the cost of this disc.
I:14626;3426;Xerxes throws everything he has at them, including The Immortals, his most powerful warriors.
I:14626;3427;A deformed traitor proves to be his undoing though, and shows Xerxes a way around the pass and behind Leonidas.
I:14626;3428;the Spartans revere physical fitness above all and are said in battle to come home with their shields or upon them.
I:14626;3429;The actors here in 300 are all very buff, especially having great abs.
I:14626;3430;director Larry Fong did an admirable job filming this great semi historical epic story.
I:14626;3431;The Movie is great and watching it on blu.
I:14626;3432;ray makes it even better.
I:14626;3433;Love the art style of the movie and recommend it to people new to the movie and those who have already seen it.
I:14626;3434;The good men and woman of theatre are in line around the block to sign a petition demanding the exile from the creative arts of the sanitation engineers and deli owners and bus drivers (not meaning any explicit defamation of the above, but deli owners should stick to salami) as well as the dentists who financed this monstrosity.
I:14626;3435;yet they burned their talent at the altar of special effects.
I:14626;3436;Fun to watch from start to finish, awesome action, graphics and battle scenes.
I:14626;3437;I thought that the book was a bit much, but it was still a very nice package.
I:14626;3438;I first saw 300 in an IMAX theatre, and was amazed.
I:14626;3439;The 300 BD has many ways to view the movie.
I:14626;3440;If you liked this movie, and you are looking for the best version, this is worth the price.
I:14626;3441;There are many superb BLU.
I:14626;3442;The key of Zack Zinder's epic style of film was to take the action event and turn it into a mythology.
I:14626;3443;He wanted to get to the essence of the Spartans, and to show us the story of a handful of soldiers willing to risk all for a larger western concept of freedom and liberty.
I:14626;3444;300 is an interpretation of a complex historical event, the collision of cultures that continues to this day.
I:14626;3445;"They fight as a specialized unit (""That's the source of our strength!"")"
I:14626;3446;Ready your breakfast and eat hearty.
I:14626;3447;"both the Spartans and Samurai warriors were comparably fierce and passionate (""No prisoners!"
I:14626;3448;king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) was a legendary hero, somebody special.
I:14626;3449;He was very powerful, very thoughtful and perhaps in the film far more human than he is even in the graphic novel.
I:14626;3450;what I loved about Leonidas was his needs, in his moment of indecision, of a back.
I:14626;3451;up, maybe a second opinion, some assurance of his wife Queen Gorgo.
I:14626;3452;So we see him, both times, looking to his wife.
I:14626;3453;She was sexy and beautiful and above all tough and aggressive.
I:14626;3454;There was intensity, elegance and ability in her.
I:14626;3455;Also a kind of femininity in her nobility.
I:14626;3456;Spartan women were special anyway, they were incredibly beautiful and Sparta was the land of beautiful women.
I:14626;3457;They were not repressed and were considered incredibly potent.
I:14626;3458;Gorgo's one love scene with Leonidas and the dialogue beforehand, was powerful: It is not a question of what a Spartan citizen SHOULD do nor a husband, nor a king.
I:14626;3459;"Brutally violent and completely faithful to Miller's work, Zinder's 300"" is inspiring, brave, and bloody artistic film."
I:14626;3460;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:14626;3461;Loved it on the big screen then loved it again in blue ray my big screen at home.
I:14626;3462;Also received the digital copy when I ordered from Amazon and was able to watch on my Kindle Fire.
I:14626;3463;And you have one terrific movie on your hands.
I:14626;3464;So why all this talk of freedom?
I:14626;3465;I enjoyed the movie very much.
I:14626;3466;It was a good movie overall.
I:14626;3467;however, having said all of this, it's a thoroughly enjoyable and visually engaging testosterone flick.
I:14626;3468;"I give it four stars for keeping me unable to take my eyes from the screen for the whole film and for being a generally "" cool "" movie."
I:14626;3469;Although paralleling the main events of this battle some 2500 years ago, sans one star since the movie makes up things and presents a sci.
I:14626;3470;definitely worthy of watching and enjoying.
I:14626;3471;this is a great movie.
I:14626;3472;still,considering they fought against 150.200,000 persians,this still a monumental achievement).
I:14626;3473;Where is a decent storyline, some attention to the actual events, etc.
I:14626;3474;"if the reader is seeking a film that pays some attention to the actual events I recommend the 1962 ""300 Spartans""."
I:14626;3475;Again, this is for kids, and adults who read comics (graphic novels, but just a fancy word for the same.)
I:14626;3476;If you like over the top entertainment without any thought process then this is the film for you.
I:14626;3477;I guess it's true that everything old is eventually new again.
I:14626;3478;directors rarely ventured outdoors to film even their most epic.
I:14626;3479;This was seen as a great leap forward for the movies both as an art form and as a business.
I:14626;3480;The Spartans, trained from childhood to be professional fighters, ended up losing the battle but not before inflicting heavy losses on the Persian army and becoming a symbol and a source of inspiration for all those unafraid to march into battle despite tremendous odds against them.
I:14626;3481;All the Spartans, including their leader, King Leonidas, are light.
I:14626;3482;skinned, ignoble barbarians, whose general, King Xerxes, comes across as a lisping, mincing, make.
I:14626;3483;"For the look of the picture is what ""300"" is clearly all about, and on that level, the movie succeeds spectacularly."
I:14626;3484;scapes, massing armies and storm.
I:14626;3485;300 is an interesting enough experience as a one.
I:14626;3486;The movie is excellent for those who've already seen it.
I:14626;3487;The price I paid for a brand new two disc special edition was great.
I:14626;3488;I like this movie enough I added it my collection to watch it again.
I:14626;3489;Great storyline in typical Miller style.
I:14626;3490;Gotta love some of the great one.
I:14626;3491;300 is a classic film, a work of art, a kick@$$ action flick and a piece of effective political propaganda.
I:14626;3492;In the book Miller constantly reiterates that the battleis one of democracy, freedom and justice against oriental tyranny,sensuality and slavery.
I:14626;3493;"i totally disagree with the editorial review that claims that the ""300"" is more engaging than ""Troy""."
I:14626;3494;It may be more engaging to those who enjoy comic books but those who enjoy adult fare will like Troy far better.
I:14626;3495;those who know little of Spartan society and the Battle of Thermopolae may enjoy this cartoon.
I:14626;3496;This movie takes incredible liberties with the battle against the Persians.
I:14626;3497;Leonidas, a very religious man, realizing that he was facing a life.
I:14626;3498;A King must die, she prophesied.
I:14626;3499;Leonidas, King of Sparta, reckoned the King was him and determined to go out in real style.
I:14626;3500;"Initially ""the 300"" got it right by showing a battle that was as more of a pushing match than a sword fight."
I:14626;3501;The fact that they last three days is a testimony to group cohesion and discipline.
I:14626;3502;"Skull Rack and ""Hummingbird God""."
I:14626;3503;"the movie ""300"" is an adaptation of comic artist Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name."
I:14626;3504;It tells the story, albeit in a fanciful way, of one of the greatest battles in history.
I:14626;3505;On the one hand, it is an excellent example of the benefits of training and discipline, and of the excellent tactical use of terrain.
I:14626;3506;On the other hand, it is a shining example of dedication and sacrifice, of free men volunteering to give their lives to protect their homeland, their people, and their way of life.
I:14626;3507;", and the ""Go tell the Spartans."""
I:14626;3508;the combination of history, heroism, and fantasy makes this movie a wild ride and a must.
I:14626;3509;Yes, a lot of the stuff is not strictly historically correct but it is still a good movie.
I:14626;3510;It has great action and a good message.
I:14626;3511;Remember, this is a movie made from a comic book.
I:14626;3512;Some of the cornpone dialogue was unintentionally funny too.
I:14626;3513;there were some great moments in 300.
I:14626;3514;If you watch the movie as nothing more than a very loosely based, vivid comic book rendering of one of history's great battles, and can put up with the frequent slo.
I:14626;3515;To that end, it is nearly perfect.
I:14626;3516;The colors, the shots, the visceral visual show is amazing.
I:14626;3517;easternism, this tale's time for retelling has come.
I:14626;3518;"300 lauds the Spartan ""warrior ethic"" without irony, lovingly depicting the progression of children into efficient killers (a good wolf."
I:14626;3519;"It could be a good modern ""Triumph of the Will"" ."
I:14626;3520;the casting and costumes were great.
I:14626;3521;A thrilling story of a heroic band of warriors taking on invaders to their homeland.
I:14626;3522;So happy i bought it.
I:14626;3523;very good graphics, fast moving, great story.
I:14626;3524;Gerard Butler is super in the lead.
I:14626;3525;Great picture and surround sound in blu.
I:14626;3526;came in good time and in good condition, but this is the 300 movie, how could it be bad
I:14626;3527;Good screen work and acting.
I:14626;3528;will be interesting to see the prequel.
I:14626;3529;Love the how this movie was directed.
I:14626;3530;I also love old time battle movies with a passion.
I:14626;3531;This is still my favorite movie.
I:14626;3532;Amazing fight scenes, artistically filmed.
I:14626;3533;far superior to Lord of the Rings battles.
I:14626;3534;Everything except that was great.
I:14626;3535;if you know NOTHING of the history this is based on though you will like it, good romp action film so to speak.
I:14626;3536;Visually very interesting with innovative special effects.
I:14626;3537;The movie, directed by Zack Snyder and employing a visual look inspired by Peter Jackson and graphic artist Frank Miller, is a phenomenon.
I:14626;3538;which is far superior .
I:14626;3539;"sure, comic book movies have scored since the original ""Superman."""
I:14626;3540;The cloth from which it's cut might be absurd and remarkably unaware, but it's immensely attractive.
I:14626;3541;it's the Spartan, who embraces a beautiful death, against the defiled, deranged Persian, who toils as a slave.
I:14626;3542;They got the perfect actor to play in this movie I mean action and adventure from start to finish Yahoo
I:14626;3543;This movie is an inspiring man movie that my husband had wanted to add to our collection for awhile, it arrived in decent time and was in the exact shape that was in the listing which made for one happy husband and wife in our household :)
I:14626;3544;My son (age 39) loves this movie and watches it several times a year.
I:14626;3545;I like this movie and that is unusual for me.
I:14626;3546;I love this movie and have a mad crush on Gerard Butler .
I:14626;3547;the Spartans of Greece want to keep to their ways, keep their freedom and land and way of life without the interference of the Persians.
I:14626;3548;This allows for adequate display of the eye candy (the main reason for the movie).
I:14626;3549;Some of the scenes have the surreal feel of a Calvin Kline add.
I:14626;3550;For the photography, which is actually quite well done.
I:14626;3551;Historically, 300 is all about the last stand of Spartan King Leonidas and his personal bodyguard of 300 soldiers as they protect the strategic pass of Thermopylae.
I:14626;3552;from an invading force of Persians under Xerxes I. Visually and artistically, 300 is second.
I:14626;3553;cut: its aesthetic value as it relates to what you see.
I:14626;3554;Above all else, it's the visual treat that 300 is from start to finish.
I:14626;3555;This movie redefines the concept of aesthetics by being psychologically enjoyable to take in.
I:14626;3556;and been a better film because of it.
I:14626;3557;a. doorknob dialogue really lowers the pleasure of 300 in some parts!!!!
I:14626;3558;"These idiot, revisionist films from lib Hollywood are always mismanaged if they draw from historical material
I:14626;3559;300 shows the Greek soldiers (called Hoplites, by the way [sidenote: there's a sophisticated and all.
I:14626;3560;Let me tell you, my social.
I:14626;3561;In fact, I award her Nero Demerits and rate her a 3 for her SAGGING efforts!!!!
I:14626;3562;"disc version, which got me the ""bonus"" disc with behind."
I:14626;3563;"For instance, throughout his little feature, Miller relentlessly admits to not accurately representing the facts surrounding Thermopylae or even Spartan culture, yet he downplays it as his right to do because he's allegedly just an ""artist"" ""re."
I:14626;3564;the parallels are just breathtaking!
I:14626;3565;This movie is quite barbaric but really tells the story well.
I:14626;3566;The cinematography is spectacular and provides unique visuals.
I:14626;3567;300 was a good movie.
I:14626;3568;The CGI was used extensively and it was well done.
I:14626;3569;ray was a good transfer and was worth the price.
I:14626;3570;Excellent story, actors and special effects.
I:14626;3571;I feel no shame in enjoying this movie.
I:14626;3572;the rest is Great and Highly Recommended!!
I:14626;3573;300 is a Movie that I really enjoy!
I:14626;3574;If your a man and an action fan this movie has it all.
I:14626;3575;based on historical fact,this movie gives you a glimpse into the warrior way of life.
I:14626;3576;one of the greatest civilizations of all time.
I:14626;3577;this movie will have you cheering them on.
I:14626;3578;"It's based on a ""graphic novel"", which I know can be a legitimate literary form (""Road to Perdition"" was excellent), but this is more like a comic book for grown."
I:14626;3579;Still, I know this movie has its fans.
I:14626;3580;"Zach Snyder's ""300,"" an adaptation of Frank Miller's glorious graphic novel, tells the famous tale of the battle of the Spartans against the Persians at Thermopylae."
I:14626;3581;accurate rendering of the battle, but a highly artistic, surprisingly refined imagining of one of Western civilization's most cherished stories.
I:14626;3582;Even today you can see the stone memorial chiseled in their honor, with the Spartan King Leondidas' epitaph still legible.
I:14626;3583;Gerard Butler heads a strong cast .
I:14626;3584;dominated by men, naturally .
I:14626;3585;Indeed, the poster for this movie gives away its a. historical bent .
I:14626;3586;Nobody with a brain, that's for sure.
I:14626;3587;This is a pure entertainment.
I:14626;3588;300 is that type of movie.
I:14626;3589;"The Spartans wage war with their souls, and ""300"" captures that martial spirit."
I:14626;3590;"plot somewhat tacked on, but ""300"" remains a thrilling, chilling, mesmerizing movie that goes into the recordbooks as one of the top 10 action movies ever made."
I:14626;3591;Exciting with a sense of heroism that inspires those who are brave at heart.
I:14626;3592;While the historical accuracies of this movie are debatable, it's more of a tribute to the comic book series.
I:14626;3593;It's a purely enjoyable movie.
I:14626;3594;well except if you're Persian.
I:14626;3595;First of all looks great on BR.
I:14626;3596;Not many movies like that and this one shines from the narration to the CGI .
I:14626;3597;It is an example of one of the finest action movies ever made.
I:14626;3598;It was received in perfect condition.
I:14626;3599;ordered this movie a month before its release date.
I:14626;3600;One of my favorite movies!
I:14626;3601;If you are into action movies, Frank Miller is awesome.
I:14626;3602;300 is an effects extravaganza, with a visual tone reminiscent of Sin City .
I:14626;3603;another successful Frank Miller graphic novel adaptation.
I:14626;3604;The production design is to be applauded on all counts as this film looks remarkable throughout.
I:14626;3605;This is powerful stuff in many ways but it's not particularly enjoyable to watch.
I:14626;3606;I bought this 2 disk set as a gift for my husband.
I:14626;3607;this movie is worth every dime!!
I:14626;3608;Probably one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:14626;3609;Loved the action packed movie and it was just as they said it was.
I:14626;3610;Brand new still in original package and how can you beat the price?
I:14626;3611;Amazing direction, fabulous acting by everyone, settings, characters and above all, phenomenal visuals.
I:14626;3612;My wife and I watched this film last night and found it to be both entertaining and moving, exciting and emotional, passionate and touching.
I:14626;3613;One of the best we have ever seen (maybe that's why we love THE WARRIORS so much).
I:14626;3614;The visuals, the driving score, the realistic yet comic style, over blown violence of battle, the love story, the betrayals.
I:14626;3615;So crisp you can see the sweat comming from the pores on the spartans.
I:14626;3616;"i also LOVE ""King Author"" with Clive Owen."
I:14626;3617;epic adventures about one's honor and fighting to uphold it and do what's rite.
I:14626;3618;I had not seen the film in the theater either and I very much enjoyed it.
I:14626;3619;I always wantto work out after seeing this!
I:14626;3620;I wanted this particular edition because it has a lot of the extras that gives you a lot more insight to the history of the Spartans and the making of the movie.
I:14626;3621;I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of this movie.
I:14626;3622;I loved him in PS I love You and Law abiding Citizen he can play any part and do it great.
I:14626;3623;I love all his movies!
I:14626;3624;Although it was a very violent movie it provides non stop action.
I:14626;3625;I just love all the fighting action and the narration that goes along with the movie.
I:14626;3626;One of the great battles in our history.
I:14626;3627;This is one of mine and my husbands favorite movies.
I:14626;3628;Impressive graphical storytelling, true to Frank Miller's original graphical novel work.
I:14626;3629;Amazing visual effects that made this download a treat for the eyes.
I:14626;3630;Reminds me of when I first saw the Matrix and thought this movie would be a fan favorite for years to come.
I:14626;3631;Certainly the best action film I have seen so far in 2007, and that's including the summer blockbusters.
I:14626;3632;I would have liked to have seen a bigger final battle scene, but alas, this version works just as well.
I:14626;3633;Young men loved this and made it a blockbuster mainly for the special effects and the blood and guts.
I:14626;3634;OKMature men loved it for the traditional male things of honor and glory and lets beat the bad guys.
I:14626;3635;Yes, the special effects are eye.
I:14626;3636;Yes, the story (although not strictly historically accurate) is a classic tale of sacrifice and honor to which any thinking person will respond to with pride and sadness.
I:14626;3637;Yes, Gerard is gorgeous and the perfect King for his time, but he is more: he is the personification of the noble warrior, the reluctant warrior, who would rather make love to his wife and raise his son than fight the invaders, but does what a free man has to do to stay free.
I:14626;3638;this is a film that grows on you.
I:14626;3639;A film that is better at the 2nd viewing and will surprise you with things you missed at the 3rd viewing.
I:14626;3640;It's not for everyone but, if your mind is open, you can enjoy it on whatever level works for you.
I:14626;3641;This film is a about a great director and 1 good actor.
I:14626;3642;Butler is great as usual.
I:14626;3643;The director's shots are simply stunning.
I:14626;3644;Great effects, excellent story line.
I:14626;3645;I got the Steelbook edition so love, love the packaging!
I:14626;3646;The story of the battle of thermopylae is rightly one of the most enduring and important last stands in history.
I:14626;3647;It also has all the elements of a heroic tragedy.
I:14626;3648;it is therefore a perfect battle for a good Hollywood film.
I:14626;3649;the end result is a beautifully wrought imaginary epic, loosely based on actual events.
I:14626;3650;The film was shot on blue screen with studio sets, and this shows.
I:14626;3651;All this would have felt cheap if it was intended as a historical film, but because it was essentially a fantasy, it all somehow worked, and allowed some beautiful cinematography.
I:14626;3652;nevertheless this is a great film.
I:14626;3653;Instead I enjoyed a thoroughly entertaining action film, and would recommend it to anyone who likes action films of any type.
I:14626;3654;I first saw it in an IMAX theatre and was blown away by the visual effects and the action.
I:14626;3655;The reduction in sloth is worth the price of admission on this one.
I:14626;3656;If so, watch it via projector and large screen.
I:14626;3657;I was pleasantly surprised by some great cinematography, a reasonable plot and a whole bunch of rather impressive fight scenes.
I:14626;3658;I adored the dark comic art rendition and over.
I:14626;3659;A well done piece of art, if you can stomach war being your entertainment alongside your daily news coverage.
I:14626;3660;That said, the message of tyranny and suppression of expression speaks loudly from history into the present.
I:14626;3661;one of the poorest, most presumptuous films I have seen.
I:14626;3662;To watch this movie you must leave your amateur historian tendencies behind and just enjoy what is a very good story, done in a very entertaining way.
I:14626;3663;And the graphic novel comes to life via the excellent direction of Dawn of the Dead's Zack SnyderDawn of the Dead (2004 Widescreen Unrated Director's Cut).
I:14626;3664;She is played by Lena Headey who takes on the tough.
I:14626;3665;the action in 300 rarely let's up, and when it does you're glued to the screen by stunning visuals and captivating acting.
I:14626;3666;much of 300's graphic novel look and feel are preserved in the screen adaptation.
I:14626;3667;What a fun movie to watch.
I:14626;3668;But the truth of the real history behind this is incredible.
I:14626;3669;But what a fun movie to watch.
I:14626;3670;The special features are robust.
I:14626;3671;That's what so cool about it.
I:14626;3672;The special edition has a ton of extra content, as well.
I:14626;3673;I loved this movie and it is definitely not my kind of movie.
I:14626;3674;I was expecting to dislike it and was pleasantly surprised.
I:14626;3675;The cinematography is absolutely stunning.
I:14626;3676;The action is fierce and in.your.
I:14626;3677;This is a movie that I will watch over and over again for years to come.
I:14626;3678;It's unfortunate that I have to write a required amount of words to say, yeah I liked it, but then I like a world where logic rules.
I:14626;3679;Alot of the movie is fuzzy and semi.
I:14626;3680;get it in regular form it is a great movie.
I:14626;3681;, and I like Frank Miller's work.
I:14626;3682;Okay, it's not for the squeamish, it's not exactly historically accurate, but it's a lot of fun, and is beautifully filmed in these odd sepia tones that I think add a lot to the film.
I:14626;3683;"frank Miller is one of the great graphic artists of our time, and so far the cinematic adaptations of his work (""Sin City"" and this one) have been right on the money."
I:14626;3684;I hope we see many more.
I:14626;3685;a note on this edition.
I:14626;3686;in short, a great, chest.
I:14626;3687;thumping MAN movie that I really enjoyed.
I:14626;3688;One the whole, I still find this to be a very good release.
I:14626;3689;Fantastic movie and superb acting by Butler.
I:14626;3690;Already a great movie, now has all the stuff that comes with it!
I:14626;3691;And it came protected and perfect!
I:14626;3692;The person I got this for is going to FREAK!
I:14626;3693;exciting, entertaining, special, best of 2007 and needs to have more US coverage so more can enjoy the outstanding performances especially Gerard Butler
I:14626;3694;Gladiator had a good story, acting, directing and was well made.
I:14626;3695;If they were to be more acurate with the true story hire better actors, a better script and director who has alot of experience with doing action movies.
I:14626;3696;But for the price, you cant ask for much!
I:14626;3697;For one brief moment I believed that 300 was the best movie ever made.
I:14626;3698;300 is actually better than that.
I:14626;3699;If you were to place all 175,693 feature films made in order from the very worst at position 175,693 (which would be Shock Treatment) and the very best at position 1, then the movie 300 would be at position .1, consistent with its status as better than the best movie ever made.
I:14626;3700;The logical but shocking deduction from these facts is that 300 is actually BETTER THAN ITSELF!
I:14626;3701;So the second best movie ever is an infinite number of places down on the list!
I:14626;3702;the repercussions for our culture are astounding.
I:14626;3703;Now this next part is very important.
I:14626;3704;Protect family by putting country above family.
I:14626;3705;Multitasking is a myth: In order to be truly great, you must specialize.
I:14626;3706;Absolutely mind blowing cinematography and action.
I:14626;3707;Personally, I sought action and I got it .
I:14626;3708;and if you seek a thrilling, action packed, cinematically mind blowing movie .
I:14626;3709;All 3 times I was absolutely spellbound by this movie.
I:14626;3710;300 tells the amazing story of how an informal Spartan army of only 300 men held off the massive Persian military force until they were betrayed by an exiled Spartan and decimated by King Xerxes.
I:14626;3711;The story was incredible, and told very well.
I:14626;3712;motion photography also detracts from the credibility of the film .
I:14626;3713;This film has all the pleasures .
I:14626;3714;of a skillful comic book.
I:14626;3715;The astonishing graphics resemble by design those in the original picture novel, and much of the gripping battlefield action .
I:14626;3716;It's important, I'd argue, to evaluate a film in the spirit in which it was conceived, in this case history as filtered through the somewhat distorting lens of an action (graphic) novel.
I:14626;3717;One of the most visually stunning action films ever made.
I:14626;3718;The visuals are amazing and only 3 parts of your body are needed to enjoy this film, your heart, your gut and your eyes.
I:14626;3719;This is not to say 300 is plotless but the very simple idea of free men fighting against a tyrant is what has made the tale of the 300 Spartans and the Battle of Thermopylae resonate for over 2000 years.
I:14626;3720;And in this day and age a little old fashioned bravado can be fun!!!
I:14626;3721;Like many, I had briefly studied the history of the battle of Thermopylae, and found the story intriguing.
I:14626;3722;The cinematography is absolutely amazing, and the stunt fighting is so well choreographed and executed that you really leave the story with a renewed understanding of the dominance of the Spartan military.
I:14626;3723;although not technically historically accurate in places (though it's hard to be sure of history that occurred more than 2000 years ago), 300 does do a good job of communicating the ideals of Spartan culture.
I:14626;3724;gerard Butler, with his intense and moving screen presence, was the perfect choice for King Leonidas (and also, amazingly, had the strength and fortitude to perform all of his own stunt fighting).
I:14626;3725;"lastly, it deserves mentioning that the actors playing the Spartan warriors represent the pinnacle of physical fitness
I:14626;3726;In short, 300 is recommended for anyone.
I:14626;3727;From what I did get to see it was a good movie.
I:14626;3728;that said, this movie is exciting, interesting, sexy, and action packed.
I:14626;3729;The strength of the love, commitment, and nationalism that is portrayed by the main Spartan characters is awe inspiring while the evil and betrayal of others is more than a fair match for the Spartans.
I:14626;3730;This sets up the classic good underdog verses the evil overlord scenario which is played out to the end.
I:14626;3731;If you are over 18 and if you like action movie, this is it.
I:14626;3732;If you like big time action movies, I think you will absolutely love this film for its pure entertainment value.
I:14626;3733;The film does more or less follow the storyline of the Battle at Thermopolaye as told by Herodotus, but Frank Miller uses a great deal of artistic license as he tells one of history's most famous military tales where a small, well.
I:14626;3734;the Spartans presented as the perfect male warriors, chisled with long flowing hair, fighting for truth, justice and the Spartan way, while the Persians as the monsterously predatory attackers, seeking to assimilate everything in its path while decimating any resistance.
I:14626;3735;the actors give solid perfromances and the action is incredible.
I:14626;3736;The film style provides an ancient feel as well.
I:14626;3737;i have read a great deal of criticism of the film for its historical inaccuracies, and certainly there are probably many.
I:14626;3738;The film delivers that story in incredible fashion.
I:14626;3739;Amazing graphics and the story line made me want to read about the true story.
I:14626;3740;It is aa must see movie.
I:14626;3741;The grain appears not to be present during the majority of the film and good detail can be seen throughout.
I:14626;3742;There is excellent use of your entire audio system, including the LFE channel, with much use of discreet audio from both fronts and rears.
I:14626;3743;bottom line, the audio is the highlight of this BR transfer and is certainly Demo worthy.
I:14626;3744;I really liked this movie when it came out.
I:14626;3745;The director really did a nice job with this flick.
I:14626;3746;One of those movies you can watch anytime.
I:14626;3747;Good movie with fantastic special effects.
I:14626;3748;For an action movie it gets 4 stars.
I:14626;3749;For an epic it gets 2 stars.
I:14626;3750;The imagery was great, the effects were a lot of fun.
I:14626;3751;The action was a sight to behold.
I:14626;3752;300 is one of the most unique movie experiences.
I:14626;3753;The combination of historical fact with comic book.
I:14626;3754;style visuals and creatures creates an exciting, powerful film about the heroic stand of the 300 Spartans at the battle of Thermopylae in 480 B. c.
I:14626;3755;A terrific cast, outstanding battle scenes, powerful imagery, and an outstanding orchestral score combine to create an exciting and emotionally.
I:14626;3756;"Historians, comic book aficionados, and action fans will find plenty to like with ""300!"
I:14626;3757;I love a film that excites, entertains, educates, and motivates me.
I:14626;3758;The battle is epic, graphic, and emotionally charged.
I:14626;3759;I was entertained for the entire length of the film as both the action and the actors are outstanding.
I:14626;3760;It is rare to find such compelling acting and actors in a war film such as this (consider the rather weak, but still entertainingTroy).
I:14626;3761;while I am well aware that this is a fictionalized account of a true event, it did realistically recreate the era.
I:14626;3762;I am a student of the ancient Greek culture as I teach Homer'sThe Odysseyto my 9th grade Honors English students and I can say fairly that this film really got it right.
I:14626;3763;"A prime example is the raising of a ""professional"" army by Butler's character."
I:14626;3764;I was glad to see these added scenes that realistically represented what might have happened back at home during this war.
I:14626;3765;other than my one criticism noted above, this film is flawless as it accomplishes all it set out to do and then some.
I:14626;3766;This was film making on an epic scale and it even rose to an art form with its stylized photography, graphic images, and direction.
I:14626;3767;own film for those that love this genre.
I:14626;3768;SPOILERS FOLLOWGerald Butler is in strong form in this action.
I:14626;3769;This is truly an epic film.
I:14626;3770;Ok, first to justify TWO stars: the CGI effects were pretty cool and the sepia tones were a nice 'historical' touch.
I:14626;3771;based monarchy and that part of the intense social engineering of Sparta was to create homosexual pair.
I:14626;3772;Visually impressive, this film captures the comic book elements of its source brilliantly.
I:14626;3773;"They are ""drawn"" (perhaps visually enhanced is a better way of putting it) with muscles on top of muscles and they are courageous and dauntless to a man."
I:14626;3774;There is certainly no record that he was the sort to get out in front and, centuries later, when Alexander crushed the Persians, their king stayed well back from the front and only fled when Alexander broke through.
I:14626;3775;The whole picture here of Xerxes is fantasy.
I:14626;3776;"i suppose ""300"" accurately portrays the comic book or ""graphic novel"" it was based on (at least it seems to do this visually) and that is an accomplishment of sorts."
I:14626;3777;cheek (but more fun, for that).
I:14626;3778;This movie was very well done as far as the CGI and the green screening goes.
I:14626;3779;This is Frank Miller's powerful storytelling mind at its best.
I:14626;3780;Miller brings the visual artists approach to the film and the director stayed true to his graphic novel.
I:14626;3781;Great yarn and stunning visuals.
I:14626;3782;I love the movie, It has great special effect and great acting and the movie has an interesting story line.
I:14626;3783;There is also a very good documentary about the 300, which I saw a few months ago (Sorry forget the name of it).
I:14626;3784;It was kind of like they took lord of the rings and merged it with a historical story, sorry best way I can describe the look, feel, music and storyline.
I:14626;3785;the most important thing to remember is that 300 is based more on Frank Miller's novel than historical facts.
I:14626;3786;using Special FX and computer graphics 300 shows warfare beautifully and in surreal colour tones.
I:14626;3787;Watching a movie as this one wonders whether in reality the battles were so perfect.
I:14626;3788;loving Spartans were the best of fighters or killers able to dispatch enemies with almost fatal single blows.
I:14626;3789;gerard Butler as Leonidas did a splendid job though.
I:14626;3790;some other last stands are noteworthy to be mentioned.
I:14626;3791;It's not Oscar worthy, but it's entertaining to the last.
I:14626;3792;Testorsterone aplenty, this film has great action scenes and cartoony blood (to keep with the original look of the comic and to avoid a harsher MPAA rating), but is staged well.
I:14626;3793;Men, your women will enjoy this movie as much as you, at the very least from an eye candy standpoint (for the ladies' enjoyment, natch).
I:14626;3794;Testosterone fueled fighting and killing coupled with striking visuals and a carefully crafted transformation from page to screen makes for some great entertainment.
I:14626;3795;Don't quote me on it, but either are a good choice if you have the means.
I:14626;3796;This is one of my favorite war movies ever created.
I:14626;3797;This movie is a must see for all!
I:14626;3798;It is very original and has great dialouge.
I:14626;3799;Whether this movie was based on actual events or not, it's beautifully made and the action was cool.
I:14626;3800;I agree with some of the other comments about how grainy the movie is.
I:14626;3801;My husband and I very much enjoyed this movie.
I:14626;3802;It has a good plotline, though the main point of the movie is about violence.
I:14626;3803;Amazing surprise to find, that the days of glory on the big screen hasn't been drowned in political correctness.
I:14626;3804;Anyone who just has a minor knowledge of the history of the western world knows that the battles between the free world and the east reaches back as far as the eye can see, so it is no use anyway to try to neglect it, and the big products of USA has allways hailed heroism .
I:14626;3805;so it is grant, that the historylessons keep up.
I:14626;3806;Great intro into classic hirtorywriting .
I:14626;3807;This is one of the VERY best movies I have seen!
I:14626;3808;I gave it 5 out of 5 stars and recommended it to everyone I know.
I:14626;3809;Looks absolutely perfect, sounds absolutely perfect.
I:14626;3810;This movie's action is brilliant.
I:14626;3811;Also, the story and the narration is superb.
I:14626;3812;This is a gorgeously shot movie.
I:14626;3813;It will take you in on scenery alone.
I:14626;3814;I found the History Channel treatment of the real events (including more than just a passing scene on the naval strategics) to be a much more satisfying and interesting story.
I:14626;3815;I am sure it's magnificent to look at.
I:14626;3816;This movie was intense and true to the time period.
I:14626;3817;The cast was exceptional, the graphics were spectacular, the story line was very emotional.
I:14626;3818;I give this movie two thumbs up!
I:14626;3819;How director Zack Snyder made a movie so gory, so violent, yet so beautiful to look at is beyond me.
I:14626;3820;smart laconic quips the Spartans were famous for.
I:14626;3821;This is a movie event that finally delivers .
I:14626;3822;dropping, magnificent spectacle that will reinvent the old swords.
I:14626;3823;actually it's more than a victory.
I:14626;3824;Great film about banding together.
I:14626;3825;While the story is well done, I find that the visual presentation of the film striking.
I:14626;3826;Very much looking forward to the next film.
I:14626;3827;and I love it long time.
I:14626;3828;I really liked this movie.
I:14626;3829;It reminded me a lot of Lord of the Rings with all the creatures in battle.
I:14626;3830;I am a female that loves warrier movies about the outnumbered winning in battle.
I:14626;3831;Hollywood used special effects and that is fine with me.
I:14626;3832;"I thought the film was very good as it had a kind of ""mystical"" qualiity that tranferred the viewer to another dimension that maybe (or not) we would not mind living in."
I:14626;3833;i thought he did a great job.
I:14626;3834;overall, the film was quite artistic and very good for people who enjoy this type of adventure.
I:14626;3835;We saw this and it was a great movie.
I:14626;3836;a little gory and intense, but it was also really well done.
I:14626;3837;300 is a great movie.
I:14626;3838;"Good movie
I:14626;3839;As a comic book brought to life, I can appreciate how cleverly it's done .
I:14626;3840;the way the action is sometimes slowed down, so that one gets the impression of succeeding frames in a comic book, and the whole stylised method of presentation.
I:14626;3841;so, great for comic book fans, who can accept the format, not so good for others.
I:14626;3842;and from what I've seen in the trailers it is a fantastic rendering of FM's graphic novel.
I:14626;3843;If nothing else it has added greatly to my knowledge of this ancient warrior culture.
I:14626;3844;Great movie with much action you will be shocked at the graphics.
I:14626;3845;A really good look at the power of 300.
I:14626;3846;300 is a very stylized movie that shows all of the gore of an epic battle.
I:14626;3847;ray disc was just like seeing the movie at the theater, with crystal clear detail.
I:14626;3848;But, if you are interested in what life could have been like in ancient Greece, and you can handle the action, it's great entertainment.
I:14626;3849;"I believe ""300"" to be one of the best action movies I have seen in some time."
I:14626;3850;This was an amazing movie with visual delights galore.
I:14626;3851;Definitely not for young kids but was visually stunning and a good story running through out.
I:14626;3852;I added it to my personal collection and have shown it to many that have the same response.
I:14626;3853;If you liked Gladiator, you will love this.
I:14626;3854;charged rush of fantastically stylish visuals, colossal battles, and gratuitously fulfilling bloodshed, 300 manages to ground itself with enough genuine heart and solemn sincerity to propel itself into epic entertainment not confined only to audiences of masculine design.
I:14626;3855;300 is the first must.
I:14626;3856;see film of 2007, a mature, visually arresting cinematic fantasy thrill.
I:14626;3857;based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, 300 closely follows the writer's often historically inaccurate, though unquestionably imaginative, retelling of the extraordinary Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B. c.
I:14626;3858;Miller's story is as compelling as it is entertaining and the effects used to translate his artwork to the screen only enhance his tale of honor and bravery.
I:14626;3859;Superbly adapted from Miller's drawings and Lynn Varley's coloring, the stunning imagery created perfectly captures each panel of art and realizes the unseen action in between.
I:14626;3860;stylistic melding of digital creatures, backgrounds, and effects with Miller's characters and Snyder's flair for storytelling create an experience unlike any else.
I:14626;3861;Imagine the slick, kinetic visuals of Sin City combined with the exciting, epic battles in Lord of the Rings, then throw Gladiator.
I:14626;3862;masterfully drawing upon the artistic influences of Miller's original graphic novel, the movie also creatively expands upon its premises by adding several characters and events.
I:14626;3863;Extra insanely crafted villains like the Uber.
I:14626;3864;immortal and Rhinoceros heighten the already incredible adversaries the Spartans faced, and the intensely vibrant visual style Snyder has created often outshines its source material.
I:14626;3865;with so much imagery filling every frame, one might assume character development would lose out to action, but the talented cast utilizes every scene to reveal their characters' intentions and unspoken emotions with fervent vitality.
I:14626;3866;"Gerard Butler confidently portrays the noble Spartan King with measured reserve and a powerful, commanding presence
I:14626;3867;Lena Headey exudes an assured sexiness and an authoritative demeanor as the dignified Queen, and even the villainous Xerxes matches his exotically terrifying appearance with deceptively calm delivery and menacing poise.
I:14626;3868;and well it should, for this is stylized violence at its finest, a necessity in conjuring the apprehension and admiration required to effectively recount this remarkable tale of bravery and survival in the face of insurmountable odds.
I:14626;3869;"i give 300 a ""10"" not just because it so flawlessly realizes Miller's vision and expands upon it, or that it so effortlessly entertains with wave after wave of ever intensifying visceral imagery, but because it so adequately lived up to my expectations of displaying in unrestrained glory, abundant slow."
I:14626;3870;motion, and free flowing, gorgeously bloody art exactly what I wanted to see in an epic story recounting the valorous last stand of the world's finest warriors .
I:14626;3871;a feat few other films could hope to accomplish.
I:14626;3872;top, intense images and a stylized manner of acting in which performers are given to shout and bluster, delivering every line as if it were vitally significant.
I:14626;3873;But the movie is fun, if only for the wild visuals combining live action and CGI animation and the film's muted color palette.
I:14626;3874;"In its clear demarcation between good and evil, ""300"" is hardly subtle and in many ways is a throwback to films of the 1950's when the audience knew from the get."
I:14626;3875;telling embellished with breathtaking visuals, the true attraction of the movie.
I:14626;3876;"disc Special Edition along with the new documentary, ""To the Hot Gates: A Legend Retold,"" a look at the process the filmmakers followed to take a graphic novel's treatment of an ancient legend and realize it as a feature film."
I:14626;3877;I will stick with the 60s original THE 300 SPARTANS with Richard Egan.
I:14626;3878;If you like action, this is the movie for you.
I:14626;3879;ray, you get the special effects and the sounds.
I:14626;3880;A grand violent artful epic war story that will rank with Braveheart and Gladiator.
I:14626;3881;This is the Frank Millerized version of the great Greek tragedy, with a modern message of freedom grafted on top.
I:14626;3882;Is Frank Miller making an editorial on the War on Terror as well?It's a fascinating movie.
I:14626;3883;it is best seen in a theater, ideally an IMAX.
I:14626;3884;if you only have a player for one format, be happy with that format and leave the other alone.
I:14626;3885;there are two formats and it is going to stay that way.
I:14626;3886;First of all the first hour is setting you up for the second hour of fighting.
I:14626;3887;Sin City is a much superior product.
I:14626;3888;Instead, what makes this work sort of fascinating as a phenomenon, and meaningful to review at all, is that it's an excellent example of the extreme contrast between modern and traditional thinking, and of surface versus content.
I:14626;3889;The fight scenes are spectacular.
I:14626;3890;An awesome display of the power of not having fear.
I:14626;3891;It's a huge inspiration to me to be strong and think on my feet.
I:14626;3892;Thank you in advance because i will be watching this on a semi.
I:14626;3893;But for me, the gory reality of it was breathtaking:)
I:14626;3894;If you can stand the killing, this is a visual adventure worth taking.
I:14626;3895;You'll definitely want to see it more than once.
I:14626;3896;"300, the new film based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller (""Sin City""), is easily one of the most interesting and visual films I have ever seen."
I:14626;3897;Lots of time and effort went into creating a unique and stylized look for the film.
I:14626;3898;"director Zack Snyder (""Dawn of the Dead (2004)"") has also adapted an interesting and involving story from the celebrated graphic novelist's work."
I:14626;3899;Surrender to him and you can keep your kingdom.
I:14626;3900;"Dilios (David Wenham, ""The Proposition"", ""Lord of the Rings""), a warrior who also serves as an oral historiographer, narrates the story and helps to ensure the legend will live on."
I:14626;3901;"written and directed by Snyder and based on Miller's story, ""300"" has one of the most interesting, and consistent visual looks I have ever seen in a film."
I:14626;3902;"The filmmakers have gone to great pains to recreate the look of Miller's art
I:14626;3903;Throughout the film, this adds a touch of drama to the look and feel of the story.
I:14626;3904;The wolf, a creation of CGI, is, nonetheless, very fearsome.
I:14626;3905;As they battle, we see brief snippets of their confrontations with various creatures, all of which is depicted in a way that can be rightfully described as beautiful.
I:14626;3906;"As much as a film with so much violence, blood and gore can be, ""300"" is a beautiful film to watch."
I:14626;3907;"I loved ""Sin City""
I:14626;3908;Because this story is basically based on a legend, this style fits.
I:14626;3909;"I am happy to say that ""300"" has these elements."
I:14626;3910;And he had every right to be.
I:14626;3911;300 follows the legend of King Leonidas and the events leading to the Battle of Thermopylae.
I:14626;3912;Maybe, but it has become more of a legend or myth at this point and the story is grand enough to fit the subject matter.
I:14626;3913;The film begins with Delios recounting the birth and childhood of the boy who would become King Leonidas.
I:14626;3914;And Leonidas dispatches the messenger in a pretty spectacular way.
I:14626;3915;But there are many key elements in this section which give the film depth and interest.
I:14626;3916;the battle is interesting because they face a variety of foes, almost as though Xerxes sends in one team after the next, to see who will win, not really expecting he will have to have an all out battle.
I:14626;3917;As each of these groups battles, the action is filmed in a unique way.
I:14626;3918;like look and feel to the battles, further adding to the beauty of the overall film.
I:14626;3919;the acting is full of shouts, grand gestures and broad movements, strangely fitting for a myth or tall tale.
I:14626;3920;Gerard Butler almost always shouts, growls or grimaces, with every line, giving him the air of a man with a lot on his mind.
I:14626;3921;He clearly loves his wife and son, but has the fate of his people in his hands.
I:14626;3922;Lena Heady is very good as Queen Gorgo.

I:14626;3924;David Wenham's Delios provides narration in the beginning and end and at periodic moments throughout.
I:14626;3925;300 is a rousing film, filled with beautiful imagery and an involving story.
I:14626;3926;Bought this as a gift for my son.
I:14626;3927;He loved it and the packing is great.
I:14626;3928;And Gerard Butler is a favorite!
I:14626;3929;Throughout the movie there is a visceral, masterful, and dark projection of physical power, unyielding will, and personal conviction unto death.
I:14626;3930;"These are woven artfully in ""300"" into a thrilling, inspiring, and desperate story that keeps you highly."
I:14626;3931;strung with anticipation, even though you've known how it will end ever since you first read the story.
I:14626;3932;Fortunately, there wasn't too much of this, either, but it definitely cheapened the effect of a genuine battle when these things appeared.
I:14626;3933;King of Kings, and a human god, looking depressingly like today's urban dum.
I:14626;3934;all this said, if you are willing to suspend your disbelief, and if you enjoy a heart.
I:14626;3935;pounding ancient war epic, I recommend this movie to you.
I:14626;3936;"It was great to see and hear the voice of David Wenham again (""Faramir"", in Lord of the Rings)."
I:14626;3937;"Vincent Regan, as ""Captain"" provides as powerful and as emotionally."
I:14626;3938;charged a supporting role as you'll ever see in a movie of this kind.
I:14626;3939;Even with its faults, I mostly enjoyed the movie, and I admired the concept of a band of brothers who would fight to the death against a tyrant, and that's the true meaning of Thermopylae, in any depiction.
I:14626;3940;300 is a visually stunning film adaptation of writer.
I:14626;3941;artist Frank Miller's graphic novel 300 which is essentially a retelling of an important historical event during the Greco.
I:14626;3942;"To me the ""so called"" battle wardrobe that is present in the movie is a plus especially if you're a woman or an appreciator of the physical beauty of the well toned male form."
I:14626;3943;This movie delivers on the blood.
I:14626;3944;This movie also features plenty of well choreographed battle sequences.
I:14626;3945;This is topnotch stuff equal to Mel Gibson's work in Brave Heart, Wolfgang Peterson's work in Troy, or Peter Jackson's work in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.
I:14626;3946;There are larger than life heroes featured in the film to be captivated by.
I:14626;3947;Men who are loyal, brave, selfless, strong, well.
I:14626;3948;trained, and honorable and a queen who is as equally strong as her husband King Leonidas.
I:14626;3949;There are also well done special effects which create this ancient.
I:14626;3950;dangerous world in a stunning fashion that is sure to please many.
I:14626;3951;It also allows the Spartans to use their much smaller army in the most efficient way.
I:14626;3952;Their wonderful military strategy naturally leads to heavy losses on Xerxes side so he sends out his best against them, his personal bodyguards the immortals (who in the movie appear to be masked creatures).

I:14626;3958;The movie content itself is awesome and I recommend seeing the movie to anyone who hasn't already.
I:14626;3959;Man, this is could very well be the most awesome manly movie since Predator!
I:14626;3960;This film is an absolute feast for the senses, and the Blu.
I:14626;3961;It's a straightforward tale of bravery and manliness where 300 free men stood against the thousands of pawns of a deranged tyrant.
I:14626;3962;This is a great film, do not miss it!
I:14626;3963;One of my favorite movies ever!Totally recommend!!!
I:14626;3964;I had to watch the screener while deployed to the desert, but all in all it was amazing.
I:14626;3965;I loved this movie in the theater so it's going to look great in hi def blu.
I:14626;3966;What is great on this movie?
I:14626;3967;The actual frames on movie matches the comics slides.
I:14626;3968;story is quite simple, but it is simple as Batman or Spiderman or any other comics.
I:14626;3969;It is the basics of comics, so focus on the creativity of the creators of the movie.
I:14626;3970;"I don't eat my tofu fried, I said, ""I eat my tofu raw!"""
I:14626;3971;This is madness, she exclaimed.
I:14626;3972;That Saturday the three of us met up with a friend of mine from Boston.
I:14626;3973;He brought four people with him.
I:14626;3974;"To which my three friends replied ""I, O."" ""You see,"" I said, ""I brought more alcoholics than you."
I:14626;3975;At least that's how I pictured my life after seeing this movie.
I:14626;3976;"Right now you're probably thinking to yourself, well, you already made fun of the historical inaccuracies and the dialogue, but I really just came to the movie for the action."""
I:14626;3977;That's all fine and good except for the fact that even the action sucks.
I:14626;3978;They know they will all likely die, but fight like wild animals nonethess.
I:14626;3979;this film reminds us of what honor, committment, and country before self are all about.
I:14626;3980;This movie will entertain and enlighten you like no other.
I:14626;3981;Great movie if you still pine for the glory of your high school locker room.
I:14626;3982;Greatest visual performance in movie so far!Perfect adaptation!Great music.
I:14626;3983;first class action!Simple and entertaining plot.
I:14626;3984;this movie is more than your regular movie,it was done in such a beautifull and strong artistic way that you can't help but just be stunned by it.
I:14626;3985;this is one of the most visually stunning experiences and it goes further than anything you've seen before.
I:14626;3986;i admit that's saying quite a lot,but that's the truth.
I:14626;3987;300 tells the story of the Spartan people and the thirst for defending their country.
I:14626;3988;there was only 300 Spartan and over a thousand Persians and there wasn't much hope,but they gave the Persians a great fight.
I:14626;3989;while it isn't historically accurate and was never meant to be,300 remains impressive in its own right.300 doesn't have much of a story,it has one but it is quite simple : 300 Spartans making their last stand fighting for their land.
I:14626;3990;it is an epic story about the ancient Grece and it makes a great hommage to the Spartan people.
I:14626;3991;office hit(well I say that but we never know)it's just amazing.
I:14626;3992;king Leonidas(Gerald Butler is impressive and gives a truthfull and honnest performance of the character that can only impress you)chooses 3000 hundred Spartans to go to war and conquer the Perse territory make the glorious name of the Spartan a famous and respected one.
I:14626;3993;its a true story of dedication and hope,the warrior code the Spartans had is respected in its entirety here even making us wonder if it really is true as it seems like too much.
I:14626;3994;historians will know right from the start that this ain't accurate history but will still love it for all the historical references and how they manage to make a great movie related to history.
I:14626;3995;it is also interresting to see the power that the queens had and how they were respected,most of what you see in movies are slave females so it is nice to see one who has power.
I:14626;3996;troughout all of it,there is also love,friendship and betrayal of their country wich adds a more human touch.
I:14626;3997;chest so you do have to see that quite often.
I:14626;3998;the acting in the movie is quite convincing and is nothing to complain about,every actor does a great job here.
I:14626;3999;the movie is mostly focused on visuals and the amazing battles it had rather than actual script.
I:14626;4000;the battles are outstanding and very well executed with lots of action in them.
I:14626;4001;every battle is stunning and seems yet so realistic for a movie.
I:14626;4002;that is one great thing about 300,it looks very real.
I:14626;4003;the final comfrontation and the ending remains touching and made the Spartans look proud of what they have achieved.
I:14626;4004;to conclude,how can you not like this movie?You can but you can't deny that its is a piece of art and a fine masterpiece.
I:14626;4005;there is something to like about it for everyone wheter it's the fight scenes,the impressive artistic result or the overral story.
I:14626;4006;"it reminds me a lot of the ""The Gladiator"" wich was similiar to 300 in some ways,but this is much more impressive.You have to admire the overral perspective and direction of 300."
I:14626;4007;people may make fun of this but it remains gold.
I:14626;4008;"it follows a lot from the 1961 movie ""The 300 Spartans"" and it is interresting to compare with 300."
I:14626;4009;Wow, this movie is fantastic.
I:14626;4010;This movie is visually stunning and action packed, and will suit any sword and sandal fan.
I:14626;4011;I don't mind movies with good fighting scenes, and not opposed to there being violence in a movie as a by.
I:14626;4012;product of a good movie.
I:14626;4013;The Matrix is a great movie, with an incredible story line, and very intelligently thought out.
I:14626;4014;This is the second movie that has come this way from Amazon.
I:14626;4015;Awesome detail, luved the fighting scenes!
I:14626;4016;A great STORY (that's what too many people fail to remember) and a great movie.
I:14626;4017;There is no doubt license has been taken with this piece of history, but as a whole, the film is a fine work.
I:14626;4018;Bloody and beautiful, 300 delivers from start to finish.
I:14626;4019;A stunning piece of filmmaking.
I:14626;4020;This movie makes you feel for the characters and never lets up with intensity.
I:14626;4021;With the new on coming out, I had to get a fresh copy of this one.
I:14626;4022;The love between the king and queen is amazing.
I:14626;4023;A must watch movie to see.
I:14626;4024;Superb special effects, great acting.
I:14626;4025;Got this as it seemed to be a good price.
I:14626;4026;I find it entertaining and the videography and effects interesting.
I:14626;4027;Movie tells a fictionalized story of an actual event.
I:14626;4028;Warriors full of heart against insumountable odds that realize victory does not always include winning.
I:14626;4029;A gory, action packed movie with a nice story behind it.
I:14626;4030;Great movie fun, very imaginative, but the Spartans were heavy infantry soldiers and did not go into battle bare chested.
I:14626;4031;sit back and enjoy this movie.
I:14626;4032;An Epic Epoche to play on words.
I:14626;4033;300 was nothing short of breathtaking.
I:14626;4034;If I were on the academy, I would definately nominate 300 for best cinematography.
I:14626;4035;The script is wonderful, using just sentences to relay emotions.
I:14626;4036;With spots of humor, the dialogue is amazing even using lines from the greek stories themselves.
I:14626;4037;With a heavy tone that still hits you where it counts it also portrays the feelings of the Spartans when they as warriors cannot express them.
I:14626;4038;"exposed ""movie stars"" the cast was great."
I:14626;4039;He was the apitome of brilliant in every scene.
I:14626;4040;This part that he made his, in every way shape or form to make King Leonidas one of the 21st centuries best characters yet.
I:14626;4041;The film also gets a few jibes in at religion.
I:14626;4042;The real story itself remains largely intact.
I:14626;4043;In fact, 300 is perhaps the most hopeful of all of Miller's works.
I:14626;4044;the movie is a visual feast of cinematography.
I:14626;4045;The color palette and overall visual look of the film is breathtaking.
I:14626;4046;Turn the sound out and cut out most of the action scenes and 300 would still be a stunning work of art.
I:14626;4047;The battles are well choreographed and take their cue from a wide variety of modern action films, such as THE MATRIX and THE LORD OF THE RINGS.
I:14626;4048;Many Spartan films top this flick, as corny as they come,close to history but to much hollywood effects,it a great story without the smoke and mirrors.
I:14626;4049;Some history buffs have concerns with the film, but that's because it's a graphic novel with some faint connections to history.
I:14626;4050;This film is about the amazing personalities of 300 men.
I:14626;4051;It is an inspiration to all of us warrior out there fighting to succeed in life, metaphorically.
I:14626;4052;speaking of words, Frank Miller is one of the most incredible dialogue creators of all time.
I:14626;4053;300 has balance like the spear.
I:14626;4054;so we have an excellent script and source.
I:14626;4055;Gerald Butler has earned the medal of one of the best action stars of all time.
I:14626;4056;He deserves so much more credit and he needs a role besides a P. s. I Love you romantic.
I:14626;4057;So I will make it short and sweet.
I:14626;4058;Frank Miller's graphic novels will always make amazing movies if he is involved.
I:14626;4059;If you enjoyed this film you must also see SIN CITY.
I:14626;4060;These two films are a couple in my favorite movies of all time.
I:14626;4061;300 is a classic of our time.
I:14626;4062;First off, I love the movie and have watched it more times than I care to admit.
I:14626;4063;It's a perfect blend of action and artistic creativity.
I:14626;4064;The commentary itself is okay.
I:14626;4065;It will take you to an interesting short clip about the pre.
I:14626;4066;productio process of the film, featuring Frank Miller and the pre.
I:14626;4067;I liked that this easter egg was an actual feature instead of a three second blooper bit of an actor making a funny face which is normally what I find.
I:14626;4068;disc #2 has some neat features as well, but again leaves me to wonder what I am missing with the Blu.
I:14626;4069;the first feature: 300 Spartans .
I:14626;4070;As well as interviews with the filmmakers, this has two historians who obviously like the film but politley separate it from fact.
I:14626;4071;And concentrates more on the Spartan culture.
I:14626;4072;I liked both of these features the best.
I:14626;4073;the third is called The Frank Miller Tapes and it's a nice little homage to the author of the graphic novel on which the film is based.
I:14626;4074;Maybe I'm spoiled, but I like watching the casting and the post.
I:14626;4075;Very down to earth and makes me look forward to her next film.
I:14626;4076;anyway, those are my thoughts and I hope they help.
I:14626;4077;Accept it as a piece of entertainment that loosely tells a story.
I:14626;4078;Read about the battle of Thermopylae first, or after watching the movie, but know that the movie is a highly dramatized hollywood version of an actual historically important event.
I:14626;4079;I think this was a good movie if you look at it for what it is, superheroes and super villians.
I:14626;4080;It is based on the Frank Miller graphic novel/comic book and that is exactly what it is.
I:14626;4081;i found the movie entertaining but I don't think it is a great history lesson or anything like that.
I:14626;4082;Just a good action/superhero movie.
I:14626;4083;Frank Miller has always been one of my favorite comic book writters.
I:14626;4084;He is a great narrator and imaginative story teller.
I:14626;4085;The breakthrough green screen filming is what totally did it for Frank Miller's story and now it was time to bring another of his masterpieces to the big screen.300 is such an incredible specticle.
I:14626;4086;The story is brilliant as well as the cast.
I:14626;4087;The bullet time fighting sequences are mind blowing.
I:14626;4088;But if you saw this movie on the big screen you will enjoy it either way.
I:14626;4089;Though I am a girl, I do enjoy violent brutish movies just as much as any guy.
I:14626;4090;wise it was pretty cool, though I couldnt help but notice similaries to certain other films (ahem, LOTR, ahem).
I:14626;4091;All in all, it was a fun sorta film but definetely overrated.
I:14626;4092;But a great show of patriotism and grit.
I:14626;4093;300 was a huge success, due largely in part to the splendid CGI backgrounds and limitless display of bloodshed.
I:14626;4094;"I was caught up in its success for several months before I watched it a few more times asking ""is it really that good?"""
I:14626;4095;I can see how this works as a graphic novel, but the same style just can't come across as excellence on screen.
I:14626;4096;Gerald Butler was great in this intense movie.
I:14626;4097;A must see movie for those that like action!
I:14626;4098;Ya'll have a nice day.
I:14626;4099;this is a really good movie but is it blu.
I:14626;4100;ray worthy.YES this movie looks great on blu.
I:14626;4101;Worth to have it your Hometheater Rack.
I:14626;4102;They are available from Amazon and are much better.
I:14626;4103;Spartans were very proud fighters and were extremely proud of their armor.
I:14626;4104;The Greeks and Persians were proud people.
I:14626;4105;300 is a action movie with a great plot and great battle scenes and lots of blood and guts basically a guys film and some ladies too =) who aren't offended by violence this is how action movies were made when I was a kid growing up in the 80s and this is how action movies need to be made again today
I:14626;4106;Incredible action in this movie.
I:14626;4107;Love this movie and look forward to the sequel.
I:14626;4108;amazing movie, i bought the disc because to me it is one of those rare movies which I want to watch again after every 6 months or so, haven't seen the extras yet but i'm sure they can't be anything but cherry on top
I:14626;4109;with that said, I will say that it was beautifully made, the effects are breath.
I:14626;4110;"This Blu Ray truly is a ""Complete Experience""."
I:14626;4111;This edition is something truly to behold with its inbuilt booklet and extras.
I:14626;4112;What a fabulous motion picture .
I:14626;4113;And that's not all the brave Spartans from this film underwent to tell us this tale of courage.
I:14626;4114;now that is truly brave.
I:14626;4115;Well, to admire the fabulous visuals, of course.
I:14626;4116;a wonderful tummy f**t. Well, this movie is a dream come true for anyone who has ever taken joy in a tummy f**t. From beginning to end, a stream of torsos, just begging to be blown against parade themselves before your very eyes.
I:14626;4117;novel visuals, two stars for the plot and acting, which evens out to three stars.
I:14626;4118;A bonus star for the dental work and torsos brings it up to four stars.
I:14626;4119;Making it a fantasy adventure, and the soldiers super heroes, takes away from the real people and the real event.
I:14626;4120;so, intermingling the incredible facts as we know them from Herodotus and others, we have other darker elements: like a decadent and diseased priesthood, mutant man.
I:14626;4121;There is nothing of the happy, sun.
I:14626;4122;They were a very honest, outdoor people that were taught to tell the truth from an early age.
I:14626;4123;Most of it was created via blue screen and computer, much like Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow.
I:14626;4124;But it goes far beyond Sky Captain, because Miller has created a powerful vision in his novel that holds Snyder's film together and gives it a look.
I:14626;4125;It is also quite sensual, and is a study in flesh as well as blood, both of which are shown quite prominently.
I:14626;4126;storywise, 300 is over the top: a cross between sci.
I:14626;4127;fi thriller and military epic.
I:14626;4128;leonidas, who is introduced to us as he teaches his son to fight, is played super.
I:14626;4129;"on military leader who knows how to inspire his men to ""do their duty,"" so that we believe he truly is Leonidas."
I:14626;4130;As the perfect action hero who can also act, he has taken his career to the level of stardom with this one.
I:14626;4131;also memorable are Lena Headey as Leonidas' gorgeous wife Gorgo (appropriate name) and Rodrigo Santoro as the affected king.
I:14626;4132;Persian art is very well documented.
I:14626;4133;There are even statues of King Xerxes, so we know very well how he looked in an official capacity.
I:14626;4134;"Again, it is a departure from historical fact
I:14626;4135;Like Apocalypto the previous year, this is a ground.
I:14626;4136;As a theatrical piece and as cinematic art, it is memorable.
I:14626;4137;The extra features on the two.
I:14626;4138;disc special edition support this view.
I:14626;4139;You can't do that and end up with a great film.
I:14626;4140;300 gets one star from me for the interesting graphics.
I:14626;4141;This movie is so epic and influential.
I:14626;4142;It looks great on Blu ray.
I:14626;4143;The cgi is a ground breaking achievement
I:14626;4144;It keeps your attention and at times pulls at your heartstrings and also can make you feel a wide range of emotions.
I:14626;4145;Gerard Butler was excellent as Leoniadas as was the rest of the cast.
I:14626;4146;I cannot personally rate this product, but the member that received it really enjoyes it.
I:14626;4147;Expecting just a slash and kill gorefest, I was drawn into a well done and fast moving tale of bravery, and fidelity.
I:14626;4148;Myself and two friends went to see this film, and we 40 something year olds were surrounded by 18.20 something year old women enjoying it as much as we, so girls don't be put off by what you may think a sword and sandel slasher.
I:14626;4149;This is an action movie you and him can both enjoy.
I:14626;4150;This isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it is quite captivating.
I:14626;4151;The cinematography and stylized coloring set this movie apart from your average epic action movies.
I:14626;4152;I do believe that in 5.10 years we will look back at this film and view it like we look at the Matrix.
I:14626;4153;This style will be copied for years to come.
I:14626;4154;if you liked the way Sin City was filmed, you will like this film.
I:14626;4155;If you like Gladiator or Braveheart you will also like this film.
I:14626;4156;Ordered it , got it in my two day shipping [prime member] time frame , popped it in my [high end] blue ray player , would not load.
I:14626;4157;Took my oldest, slightly scratched, grand.
I:14626;4158;I had trouble seeing eyes, and sharp details.
I:14626;4159;300 is another highly faithful graphic novel adaption of Frank Miller's, the first being Sin City.
I:14626;4160;I give it 3 stars primarily because of it's incredible CG work and the fact that despite it's general lack of a good script and poor dialogue, it still entertained me and kept me watching until the end.
I:14626;4161;A surreal film with action galore.
I:14626;4162;Buff guys everywhere for the gals to watch and the leading lady is a beauty.
I:14626;4163;Ok, I gotta be honest, I loved 300 movie.
I:14626;4164;For those who enjoy action coupled with character and bravery, this is both entertaining and inspiring.
I:14626;4165;this is the best action movie of 2007.
I:14626;4166;I love this movie and searched this site for it.
I:14626;4167;Fast delivery and well packaged.
I:14626;4168;300 is a movie unlike any other I have ever seen.
I:14626;4169;It has a modern resonance that is beyond what entertainment is.
I:14626;4170;I believe there are only 3 movies that are perfectly made in the history of films which are, Gone with the Wind, Lord of the Rings and 300.
I:14626;4171;in overall perspective and theme of the movie, this film just totally rocks and is a hardcore excellent film.1.
I:14626;4172;The script is spectacularly amazing, effective and full of impact.
I:14626;4173;It not only is true to the original comic but it captures effectively the characters, the mood, the theme.2.
I:14626;4174;the film is enhanced with the digital, artsy.
I:14626;4175;comic style embedded in the movie.
I:14626;4176;The look of the movie is stunning in itself, surrealistic (as it should be) and very modern.3.
I:14626;4177;Very unique, very effective, just astoundingly above the standards of hollywood directors.
I:14626;4178;He perfects commercialism combined with artful discretion.
I:14626;4179;Unlike most action war battle scenes in most commercial movies, the fight scenes in 300 are not chaotic, effortlessly (or so it would seem to the audience) beautiful and effectively captures the strength, the weakness, the inevitable force of the film.5.
I:14626;4180;Can't wait to see the new film.
I:14626;4181;300 what a great movie to watch more then once
I:14626;4182;300 is a spectacular motion picture, especially on Blu.
I:14626;4183;What I was truly surprised by was the magnificent sound using the uncompressed PCM 5.1 sound track.
I:14626;4184;I would recommend it to anyone.
I:14626;4185;At this point everything seemed fine the staff were great, smiling and pleasant, I thought this would be a nice opportunity to ask the usher if he would take a photograph of the four of us sat in our row to which he replied I haven't time at the moment I am serving ice cream .
I:14626;4186;Instead, it is a feast for the eyes and the ears with a fantastic cast, great soundtrack, and probably the best visuals of the new millennium.
I:14626;4187;"I know, I know, for about 10% of the male population (and about 90% of the chickies out there) this will be basically porn: the best bodies this side of the WWE, pumped and oiled, wearing little more than leather thongs, but Gerald Butler's amazing dramatic abilities (along with a great supportive cast) take this film from the B level cheese fest that was the very sorry ""Troy"" and turn their tale into true art."
I:14626;4188;"The dialogue is very solid and strong (almost ""Braveheart"" like, which is a very high compliment), and while there are surely many embellishments, the main story stays pretty close to history."
I:14626;4189;I finally got it to work but only on my computer where you have the option to change regions.
I:14626;4190;You feel the honor and repect for their country and people.
I:14626;4191;if you never seen this movie before, you will be entertained!
I:14626;4192;300 is a very accurate account of the famous 300 Spartans and their King.
I:14626;4193;Again the movie is perfect.
I:14626;4194;I'm admitantly a fan of this type of Movie, but this exceeded my expectations.
I:14626;4195;It had a simple tale told in a way that kept you on the edge of your seat throughout.
I:14626;4196;I would highly recommend this Movie to anyone interested in this era.
I:14626;4197;But this one looked pretty good.
I:14626;4198;the storys sposed to be true.
I:14626;4199;I figger that makes the Sparta men Americans.
I:14626;4200;theres a lot of fightin and a lot a blood flyin ever which way.
I:14626;4201;The fightin got me boilin.
I:14626;4202;I had real strong dreams about Jack for a coupla weeks.
I:14626;4203;when the Sparta boy got his head cut off I wanted to stomp the Persia guys into the ground.
I:14626;4204;the Sparta men lose but they figure they really won because they stood up for what was right.
I:14626;4205;I liked it when the Sparta king said he woulda died for any of his men.
I:14626;4206;alma Jr knows a lot a things.
I:14626;4207;So the older guys had sex with the younger guys until the older ones got hitched.
I:14626;4208;But they loved their country.
I:14626;4209;And they loved each other as friends.
I:14626;4210;He must have been a wonderful person for you to have loved him so much.
I:14626;4211;He woulda liked this picture too.
I:14626;4212;A good action film that is never boring.
I:14626;4213;although the box's corners are a little bent in, the actual disc and features of this movie are top notch.
I:14626;4214;This movie is going to become a classic for all times as it uses modern cinematographic methods to retell an ages oldtale of courage, devotion, dedication and the will to die to protect your country in the face of certain death.
I:14626;4215;I had very easy access to the movies I wanted to see.
I:14626;4216;the streaming was seamless and very instant.
I:14626;4217;I had enjoyed the film in the theatre and wanted a copy for my own.
I:14626;4218;ray looked sharp and true with excellent sound.
I:14626;4219;Included is a nice array of extras on the disc, you will learn more about the 300 experience from behind the camera, the cast, and others who contribute to the 300 experience.
I:14626;4220;The book includes some interesting shots from the film and provides a sturdy protective case for the blu.
I:14626;4221;Compare to Frank Miller's Sin City, 300 is obviously more violent and lavish in production, even though I know most of the landscapes and sets are CGI.
I:14626;4222;The film is pure thrill and it's very popcorn entertainment.
I:14626;4223;Still, the film continue to be a captivating experince with so much bloody and gruesome fight scenes with monsters and imortals.
I:14626;4224;top Hong Kong kung fu movies, so the fight scenes here came across as dull but it's intended to be as realistic as it was meant to be.
I:14626;4225;He's very good at delivering all those very macho and angry expressions and his battle scenes are pretty convincing.
I:14626;4226;packs and bulging chests effortlessly stole the show.
I:14626;4227;I was very impressed with the visuals overall, and some of the makeup and wardrobe were quite amazing, especially those piercings all over Rodriguez Santoro who played the Persian King.
I:14626;4228;This was simply a great movie.
I:14626;4229;The images, the emotion, the story, the artistic feel.
I:14626;4230;The Persians took losses, but kept right on down the Greek coast to Athens and burned it in one piece.
I:14626;4231;Please remember that Frank Miller is a masterful comic book artist, not a scholar of classical Greece.
I:14626;4232;He's sown a few seeds of fact and reaped a huge harvest of entertainment, so his result may resemble history as much as an oak tree resembles the acorn that it developed from.
I:14626;4233;That's fine too.300 succeeds completely as a comic brought to the screen.
I:14626;4234;It's big, bold, and bloody.
I:14626;4235;The movie really finds itself in the larger.
I:14626;4236;meisters truly bring the comic alive.
I:14626;4237;It's a grand spectacle, driven by comic.
I:14626;4238;It works at every level that it attempts.
I:14626;4239;i was wondering how a good movie can be sold for less than $9.
I:14626;4240;This is a great movie, Blu.
I:14626;4241;definitely a movie I'd see twice .
I:14626;4242;Loved certain parts of the movie.
I:14626;4243;Highly recommended for teenagers and adults.
I:14626;4244;Nothing seems real in the movie.
I:14626;4245;A true shame to one the greatest battles in the history of the world.
I:14626;4246;This is a movie adaptation of Frank Millers graphic novel, 300.
I:14626;4247;thats right, a comic book!
I:14626;4248;If you want a history lesson, the history channel has a great documentary on the subject.
I:14626;4249;But please, if you are a history buff, please write a review on a non.
I:14626;4250;awesome movie with a good cast.
I:14626;4251;I recommended to those who like Greek history or fans of Spartans!
I:14626;4252;He loved the extras .
I:14626;4253;He really liked the books and cards.
I:14626;4254;He said that it was one of his favorite collector's editions.
I:14626;4255;i see this edition is similiar with reguler edition.
I:14626;4256;This Limited Collector's Edition is perfect.
I:14626;4257;I totally recommend this edition for the fans of 300.
I:14626;4258;I'm a big fan of this era, so my opinion is bias.
I:14626;4259;This movie is near perfect.
I:14626;4260;I love the style of the film, the actors.
I:14626;4261;All these men obviously worked very hard to get into amazing shape for this movie.
I:14626;4262;Without question this is one of the greatest movies of its time.
I:14626;4263;I recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys action, a bit of history, and any film lovers!
I:14626;4264;Being a fan of Roman style gladiator films, I've seen quite a few and this one I put at the top of my list.
I:14626;4265;Three hundred also holds true to history, for all you historical nuts, which I can attest to because of A. in Western Civ.
I:14626;4266;In my opinion it was one of the best movies in terms of cinematics and story line.
I:14626;4267;This transfer is amazing and the extras are incredible.
I:14626;4268;The movis was fantastic, very entertaining.
I:14626;4269;If you want a good action flick get this.
I:14626;4270;300 is a very entertaining movie.
I:14626;4271;Its battle scenes involve modern techniques, with CGI and eye popping effects.
I:14626;4272;The movie itself is recommended for a fun two hours.
I:14626;4273;Its 300 in all its glory on the best format available.
I:14626;4274;well frank miller is good at movies like that.
I:14626;4275;anyhow I loved this movie only a little.
I:14626;4276;The best parts are the action sequences.
I:14626;4277;the way the blood spreads around everywhere is fantastically done.
I:14626;4278;I absolutely love this movie!
I:14626;4279;It's just an overall great movie.
I:14626;4280;The visual effects were spectacular.
I:14626;4281;It's a very captivating movie and many would enjoy it.
