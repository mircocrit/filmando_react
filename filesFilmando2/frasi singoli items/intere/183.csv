1;"Few words can describe how I feel about ""Road to Perdition""."
2;but I will tell you what makes it, in my opinion .
3;a masterpiece of modern filmaking.
4;It is absolutely beautiful, brilliantly orchistrated, and emotionally satisfying music.
5;It has been several years since I have heard music so perfect.
6;another very important technical aspect to film.
7;making is this movie's visually stunning cinematography.
8;Although dark and dreary in much of the movie, the concept of using water to signify death (this being the director's trademark) is absolutely brilliant.
9;I remember feeling breathless at several moments in the film.
10;the costumes and sets fortunately do not draw our attention away from the story, rather add to the flavor.
11;one final note: I would like you to take a hard look a this movie's poster.
12;in one hand, Tom Hanks holds a Tommy gun, in the other, the hand of his son.
13;The music was a minimal but suited the film perfectly.
14;my Comments:This is a remarkable movie.
15;It is just an all around wonderful movie.
16;There is one scene in particular that was just so well done that I'm still amazed.
17;i was thoroughly impressed with the story.
18;It seemed completely logical and plausible and worked very well.
19;And, the setup to the story is superb.
20;overall, I loved this movie.
21;But, you'll probably still be entranced by a very compelling and touching story.
22;it appears that the writing team sat around to imagine the most shocking ideas for a story, and found the money to film it.
23;"on character speaks of a killer as ""gifted""!"
24;I like a lot of movies, but one of my favorites has always been the gangster films.
25;"He witnesses his father and Rooney's son killing a man and that leads to Michael protecting his son from his other ""family."
26;This sounds like a good story, but in reality, the way it plays on screen is far from the truth.
27;a. heart character into the role of Sullivan, but it never really works.
28;I guess after giving five great performances in a row .
29;The rest of the acting is good though.
30;Paul Newman is both charming and sinister in his all.
31;There really are some beautiful scenes and great acting, but some truly confusing/laughable scenes.
32;"The ""corner boys,"" Irish and Italian mainly, of 1930s Great Depression Chicago though, as portrayed in the film under review, The Road to Perdition, make all that other stuff seem ""punk"" by comparison."
33;"Equally true is the fact that there are always more ""hungry"" guys than the market can bear which leads to two things."
34;And that is the heart of this story.
35;In the end though Tom Waits is right in the opening line from Jersey Girl.
36;pleasing 1930s period piece and what turned out to be a great farewell performance by the late Paul Newman.
37;This movie makes your mind swarm with thoughts and anticipation.
38;If you pay close attention you can predict what is going to happen.
39;Even in it's predictability you will love this movie.
40;Tom Hanks is incredible in his role as a gangster hitman.
41;Jude Law gives a wonderful performance as a wierdo.
42;road to perdition is exciting and new and even if gangster is not your style you will enjoy this movie.
43;"Road to Perdition""Road to Perdition"" is really a story of father and son."
44;It's easy to figure out what the basic story is based on the trailer.
45;All he knows is that he goes on dangerous missions for him, and that he carries a gun.
46;Connor spots the young Michael and that's where the real story begins.
47;:)This story also shows the right of passage for Michael Jr.
48;One of the most poignant scenes in the film is when Michael Jr. is left in a reading room to wait while his father took care of some business.
49;what follows next are carefully crafted moments for the father and son to bond.
50;One of the funniest scenes in the film is Michael Jr. learning how to drive.
51;the plot for this film is easy to follow and action sequences abound.
52;But the real meat of the story comes with the interaction Michael Sr. has with his son Michael Jr, AND that of Michael Sr. with Mr. Rooney.
53;"Michael Sr. has to pause a moment and say ""I love you both the same."""
54;As a father he has to do the thinking and be the rock.
55;And maybe that's a good thing.
56;i believe teenagers to adults will enjoy this film.
57;4.5 (well written, wonderful cinematography of the 30s)E (Erotica) .
58;With such a gripping story, great acting, cinematographic excellence, and the genius interpretation of Thomas Newman, you'll understand my enthusiasm.
59;Kept moving and kept your interest.
60;Another perspective for Tom Hanks to play and he did it well.
61;Great back when I was a kid Same kind of awareness as Stand By Me or Firestarter
62;Both he and Tyler Hoechlin, as his son, are excellent in confronting the bonds and choices facing them.
63;"Paul Newman, what can you say
I:9607;64;This movie is rather slowly paced, but largely makes up for it with excellent performances from most of the actors, a first rate musical score, and absolutely gorgeous locations and cinematography (the only movie I know of which visually represents the period as well or better is """"Miller's Crossing"""")."""
65;He is however somewhat type cast as a good and decent guy and it was hard to picture him as a killer or a gangster.
66;the son played by Tyler Hoechlin did a great job and I found the Jude Law character to be fascinating and well acted.
67;"all that being said, that the acting was terrific, I should say that this is one of those ""thinking and feeling"" type movies much more than it is an action, adventure or gangster film."
68;"It has a few surprises (the kind that are only fun to watch once) and since it is not a Bruce Willis or Clint Eastwood shoot 'em up movie it may not have the same ""watch it over and over"" appeal that some might expect from the previews."
69;"Here is an actor who earns his bread and butter playing nice guys (as in ""Forrest Gump,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" etc.) However, he brings redemption to the character of Michael Sullivan."
70;well, not to give too much of the movie away, but Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a hit man for a crime boss John Rooney (the great Paul Newman).
71;Jude Law also puts in a great performance Maguire, a sadistic photographer/hit man who is on the trail of Michael Sullivan and his son.
72;"McGuire has to be one of the best movie villains I have seen this year
I:9607;73;Stanley Tucci also has a nice small part in the film, as does Daniel Craig, who plays Connor Rooney, the weasly blood son of John Rooney, who envies Michael Sullivan because of his father's love for him.
I:9607;74;the scenery and sets in the movie are great also.
I:9607;75;Mendes uses odd camera angles and shots in some scenes, and the rain and snow really add to the overall mood of the movie.
I:9607;76;i was a great fan of """"American Beauty,"""" but Sam Mendes has outdone himself."""
77;At first when I saw this movie, I thought.
78;I believed that Tom Hanks was pretty good but not outstanding.
79;Paul Newman deserved his Oscar nomination and Jude Law was especially chilling.
80;Although, I do beleive that some of the scenes were incredible, namely the beach at the end.
81;Speaking of the end, that was the best and most moving part of the movie.
82;The ending will be loved by everyone, if they can stay awake to get to it.
83;"Much like the Coen brothers in 1990, Sam Mendes made a wonderful Gangster movie that was trampled over by an inferior one
I:9607;84;Truth be told though, `Road to Perdition' is much more controlled, complete and enjoyable than that scattered mess Scorsese campaigned for a Best Picture nomination.
I:9607;85;the film centers on Michael Sullivan, a strong arm for an Irish mob in depression era Chicago.
I:9607;86;When Michael's wife and youngest son are murdered at the hands of his `family' Michael and his Michael Jr. travel down the road of revenge, vowing to set matters straight.
I:9607;87;but it is far from an easy journey.
I:9607;88;emotionally, `Road to Perdition' has a lot going for it.
I:9607;89;Michael Sullivan is a man going to hell, but his only desire is that his son makes it to heaven.
I:9607;90;While it seems like a simple enough morale, the way in which Mendes transfers it is deeply moving.
I:9607;91;but the film, above all else, is a technical marvel.
I:9607;92;`Road to Perdition' is visually stunning, a sublime directorial piece by Mendes.
I:9607;93;It reminds me a lot of his recent `Revolutionary Road' in the way he was able to really connect with the era, not just the story.
I:9607;94;Everything is so clean and so authentic"
95;The score and the glorious set pieces also help in that regard.
96;Another testament to Mendes's impressive direction is the performances he gets from the ENTIRE cast.
97;This is one of the strongest ensembles of the year, for each and every player, no matter how small, adds so much to their scenes.
98;One that is truly impressive is Hanks, who I am vocally NOT a fan of.
99;It was such a realistic and ultimately heartbreaking transition because we saw him become a father for the first time.
100;This had a lot to do, I'm sure, with Mendes's instructions, and his pacing of the film (while some may find it slow) truly helped establish this man's emotional journey.
101;Paul Newman is the films standout, without question.
102;His paternal conflictions are so reaching and so moving, especially as the film draws to a close.
103;Even bit parts like Stanley Tucci's or Jennifer Jason Leigh's or Anthony LaPaglia (who was cut from the film only to make his way back if you catch the right `version') are all spot on.
104;the film is still stunning in many areas and a very, very engrossing and entertaining film.
105;I highly recommend this to any fan of the genre or the actors or the director (I am really impressed with his small yet diversified resume), for they are all at the top of their games.
106;He is a man of few words, and Hanks gives real depth to what could otherwise have been a flat personality.
107;He loves his family and saves his son, and via this we see the man has a real soul despite being a killer.
108;I was really surprised by the Dolby 5.0 soundtrack.
109;I have a full home theater system and this disk's audio really shone.
110;The occasional gun fight made full use of the rears and shots seemed to shoot around the room.
111;Both were great, and the film was slow but well done.
112;"If you look the word ""perdition"" up in the dictionary you will see that it means loss of the soul or eternal damnation."
113;In this movie, it is also the name of a small Illinois town.
114;Thus begins a dark, often touching, often disturbing movie about the Irish Mafia in depression.
115;tom Hanks is outstanding as Michael Sullivan, the father, a hit man for mob boss John Rooney, played by Paul Newman.
116;All is going well until his son secretly goes along on a mission one night and witnesses Sullivan making a hit.
117;His father appeals to the mob boss to spare him and is assured such will be the case.
118;"the cinematography is outstanding in this darkly photographed movie where there is more rain than we've had since ""Angela's Ashes."""
119;"hearted killer who is also a loving father, who lifts this above the rest of the summer movie fare.You won't get the action or dazzling glamour of ""The Godfather"" but you will get a good film noir movie that showcases Hanks, gives outstanding scenes to Newman, and tells a story that keeps you riveted to the screen."
120;This is no hype, this is a great, great movie.
121;A dream cast, literally flawless down to the smallest part, tells a tragic tale of loyalties betrayed and of bonds broken and bonds established.
122;Conrad Hall's cinematography is casually stunning and every production detail is meticulous and authentic.
123;The past is captured with intelligence and care.
124;sam Mendes has found a way to tell this tale of violence and murder with great style and grace.
125;His choices throughout the film are brilliant, whether in unexpected closeups or thoughtful and unusual camera placement and angles.
126;With this, only his second film, he has established his place in the forefront of today's filmakers.
127;Paul Newman nails the contradictions in this charming but deadly old gangster.
128;And Daniel Craig makes an impression as the envious son with the constant smile but no laughter in his eyes.
129;Stanley Tucci does a nice small part and all the minor characters are fine.
130;But, the great work are the scenes between Newman and Hanks and Hanks and Hoechlin.
131;A welcome relief from the hyper noisy and busy popcorn movie season.
132;this is as fine a piece of filmmaking as you're likely to see in a while.
133;First rate in all departments.
134;I have a very high opinion on Tom Hanks and a serious fan.
135;Great Film with Tom Hanks playing against type.
136;Although it's not as stellar as BEAUTY, it is still a magnificent film.
137;What 'Road to Perdition' PERDITION is stylishly presented and showcases excellent performances.
138;Along with providing Sullivan with a father figure he has given him all of the opportunities possible, and by the time the film opens he has progressed to becoming Rooney's right.
139;ultimately this is a film about relationships, more than a gangster film where gun.
140;Thankfully Tom Hanks' depiction of Michael Sullivan is an understated one.
141;He plays Michael with an element of coldness, one that befits a murderer, but one that also displays the reality of his relationship with the younger Michael.
142;Hoechlin manages to bring contradictions together in his role maintaining quietness engagingly and the energy of youth when required.
143;Michael's surrogate father, Newman is as exceptionally well played as his surrogate son.
144;His natural son is also equally well played by Daniel Craig.
145;'Road to Perdition' is an intelligently made gangster film that has an epic feel filled with a coldness that can only remind you of the 'Godfather'.
146;The acting is strong across the board with performances being detailed and well.
147;Admittedly the film may be a little predictable, but essentially it is the beauty in the telling which makes this one to watch.
148;Whatever Sam Mendes does with his camera, we follow him, in awe, in delight, in utter respect of his inventive architectural zooms and shots.
149;"Fathers and sons, husbands and wives, all melodramtic idealistic soap operatic themes are found in ""Road to Perdition""."
150;"Mendes, infamous for the amazing cultural landmark ""American Beauty"", doesn't soar to the brilliant dysfunctionalism he creates, but still pushes forth a brooding collection of A. list stars (Hanks and Newman), and underlying human emotion."
151;Whatever somber surrealism Mendes has in mind he uses it amazingly, and creates a breathtaking Oscar.
152;caliber film, visionary, dark, and filled with delicacy.
153;I've read a lot of reviews for this movie stating that it is an excellent film and some even call it one of the best movies of all time.
154;When I see Tom Hanks, I see him in Big.
155;The only thing that gives this film some merit is its stellar cast who bring a mediocre script up to their level.
156;The legendary Paul Newman comes off best but Tom Hanks, arguably the finest actor in movies today comes close.
157;Jude law steals practically every scene he is in.
158;Tom Hanks is worth watching in almost anything though and he makes the film worth one star for me.
159;What we do and teach our kids in life is so important in their well being.
160;Though its clear that Mike Sr. (Tom Hanks) loved his son and shot Jude Law to spare him the torment of living with killing a human being.
161;saps the film's life away.
162;No, it has many good offerings, including Jude Law's own hitman creation.
163;many will enjoy and celebrate RTP.
164;I will anticipate more successful projects from all involved.
165;One of the best gangster movies ever, without over the top graphic violence.
166;Every frame tells a story.
167;"As if this isn't bad enough Sullivan also soon finds his own ""Family"" have issued orders for a hit on him."
168;paul Newman deserves a mention as he is sensational as Hanks's father and mentor.
169;The pace is a bit slow in parts but Conrad L. Hall's stunning cinematography more than makes it for it.
170;My title reflects my first reaction when I heard about this movie some time ago.
171;More reserved, subtle, and allows other actors, esp.
172;his son, to share in the limelight.
173;Another great performance to put on his resume.
174;With the beautiful scenery and wardrobes, I was unconsciously comparing it to The Untouchables throughout.
175;Mendes does a great job directing, and has already established himself to be a director worth watching.
176;Newman is also great in it, as is Jude Law (in by far his creepiest role) and the sons, Newman's and Hank's.
177;acted movie of the year thus far.
178;I know there will be some Oscar nominations for those involved, and the nominations will be well deserved.
179;I think this is a really great movie for adults, and would highly recommend it.
180;Perfectly cast but the best one of all may be Tyler Hoechlin.
181;He gave the best performance by a child actor that I ever saw.
182;My favorite Tom Hanks movie will always be Forrest Gump but this is a close second.
183;"It's made an affect on you, therefore it is moving
I:9607;184;You've felt it and experienced it.
I:9607;185;if a movie can make you feel, if it can make you physically express that emotional in which it brings out in you, it is moving"
186;It's a part of you and it is undeniable.
187;Only a few movies you will ever see in your life will do this to you.
188;But Road to Perdition has managed to affect me in both ways.
189;This is a movie about the life of gangsters, in a way, but what this movie really is about is the relationship between fathers and sons.
190;Blood or no blood, it's the bond the two men have together.
191;But I will say that all the actors, Tom Hanks and Paul Newman especially, did an excellent job.
192;The story is amazing, the directing is topnotch, the cinematography is wonderful.
193;This movie has the ability to question parts of you that you're afraid to, but also soothes the parts of you that can feel empty or scared.
194;"It's actually an adventure
I:9607;195;Go see the movie and understand what I'm trying to convey.
I:9607;196;Tom Hanks is in my opinion one of the best actors alive he has outstanding performances that make you smile, cry, or simply laugh, this movie was grand Paul Newman played a really great supporting actor as Mr. Rooney and Jude Law did okay at playing his part over well this movie is good a drama thats not worth missing has alot of action as well mixed into it
I:9607;197;It shows, overall, that at the heart of every mob movie, there is a heart.
I:9607;198;Hanks's motivation is at the heart of this movie.
I:9607;199;Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are excellent actors, but their performances here cannot be considered career highlights.
I:9607;200;The deleted scenes are nothing special, but the """"Making of"""" documentary is enjoyable enough."""
201;The second film from director Sam Mendes is, in my opinion, a vast improvement on American Beauty.
202;Where American Beauty really had no characters that were compelling and all of them seemed to be caricatures straight from Hollywood's neurotic suburbia playbook, Road To Perdition brings us into the world of complex people driven by honor, duty and filial love to do things that ordinarily they would never think of doing.
203;the vocation of Michael Sullivan provides an interesting and subversive twist on the old father/son bonding motif.
204;There are also great moments of genuine warmth and humor woven in between the violence and action.
205;The ending is a suprise and is more thoughtful and intelligent than I expected.
206;the best parts of Road to Perdition are: the performances by Hanks and Newman, the cinematography and costumes.
207;Hanks and Newman perfect the roles they have and literally become the characters and look as if the family troubles that form the backbone of the story are written on their faces and in all of their movements.
208;The cinematography and the costumes/sets are, quite simply, amazing.
209;The viewer is literally transported into the 30's, and that's just about the best comment anyone can give to such a work.
210;i read the book first, and parts of the book I think are better.
211;Tom Hanks is fantastic in this movie and the acting is superb by all.
212;The action is great, and the music score adds to make this movie one of the best!
213;I bought the full screen edition but still I really like this film and was surprised despite what the hardcore reviewers out there say.
214;It has action and has story but first as a good film always starts is the relationships and the connections amongst the people of the community and what is occuring at the very moment due to actions and threatening revolution from the past.
215;If you can't waith for Once Upon A Time In America to come out yet or already have the untouchables than you should look at this film cause it is a good one.
216;This was an excellent film.
217;It is the best mob film since Goodfellas.
218;Excellent, this is the kind of film that critics love.
219;intentions: Seems as if Mendes wanted to make something to compare with The Godfather Saga and, IMHO the superior, Miller's Crossing.
220;As expected, Hanks pulls it off beautifully.
221;The acting is solid throughout.
222;Paul Newman is brilliant as an older version of Sullivan.
223;Regardless, the film is well worth seeing: besides the acting, the costumes and set designs are fantastic, the relationship between Sullivan and his son unfolds beautifully, and Sullivan's bobsled ride to Hell is painful, yet totally engrossing.
224;This is a stunning movie of unusual power and grace, an intelligent minimalist movie made once again from the ranks of one of our fastest rising art forms: Graphic Novels.
225;"These novels are fast rising into the mainstream of our culture, and it should not be long before they are accepted by more than filmmakers and fans of ""picture novels."""
226;He half succeeds, killing Michael's wife and youngest son, but his other son Michael Jr. escapes, and the ambush he sets up for Michael fails.
227;and flesh and blood wins out, to his own chagrin.
228;Though he hates his son for his actions, he cannot give him up, and doing so costs him the adopted son he loves, and admires.
229;winning AMERICAN BEAUTY, with Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening, this is a movie of stunning power combined with restraint.
230;Dialogue is sparing, and when it occurs it serves as an effect in and of himself.
231;He loves to talk, to gab, and his banter belies his sinister, perverse nature.
232;"And in one terrific scene, when he is injured by exploding glass, he carries with him a glittering, permanent mark of his true iniquity.Yes, Law stands out
I:9607;233;Newman of course is outstanding, but when is he not?
I:9607;234;Tom Hanks is a true surprise, though he'd played dramatic roles before inPhiladelphiaandForrest Gump, he had not ever played a disagreeable, ultimately evil man.
I:9607;235;one interesting fact I read concerned Tom Hanks, who asked Mendes to make sure to reduce the violence in the movie.
I:9607;236;There is one amazing scene that is quite important in the film, an extremely violent scene in which many people die, yet it is accomplished SILENTLY.
I:9607;237;even the music is muted, and the effect is unique, even ghostly.
I:9607;238;It is an interesting choice: well.
I:9607;239;see ROAD TO PERDITION if you're interested in a thoroughly engrossing, serious, thoughtful movie, one of lasting significance.
I:9607;240;at first, I was excited to see that Hollywood finally made a new entry into the """"Road"""" films."""
241;"But I thought to myself ""Tom Hanks is a good actor, as is Jude Law, and they likely wouldn't attach themselves to a bad film"" and I also figured that it would be refreshing to see the first ""Road"" movie since ""Road to Hong Kong"" and we all know that one wasn't the strongest of the series."
242;So, I decided to go into this film with an open mind.
243;What was great about Hope's character was that he never knew when to shut up!
244;It makes one wonder why the director even chose to make this film.
245;"I recommend that fans just count ""Road to Hong Kong"" as the final ""Road"" film and just forget that ""Road to Perdition"" was even made."
246;Great casting makes for great movie.
247;acting: 5/5 Great acting from Hanks, Newman, Jude Law and Harry Groener.
248;overall: 4.5/5 Great movie, see it.
249;i liked it a lot.
250;It is an exciting trip from start to finish.
251;The gun battles are equal in intensity as a father's emotional struggle with honor, loyalty, love and family.
252;First, this is the most artistically rendered gangster film I've ever seen.
253;The theme is fathers and their sons, where fathers may lead their sons and how that can come back to haunt them.
254;He does a fine job.
255;The boy who plays his son does a terrific job too.
256;Some may complain that this has some mawkish or overly sentimental moments but the whole of it is so well done that I can't really complain about them.
257;This is my husband's favorite movie.
258;Would and have recommended it to several people.
259;A superlative drama with enough suspense, pathos, criminality and humor to keep you involved over the entire span of the film.
260;ray disc I've viewed on my new Samsung Blu.
261;I never heard of this movie, saw Tom Hanks in description on TV said has to be good.
262;This film is arguably the best film of 2002(only Gangs Of NY and the Two Towers are even close).
263;Tom Hanks is brilliant as the loving father/mob hitman.
264;next up is Tyler Hoechlin, turning in a magnificent performance as one of Hanks' sons.
265;paul Newman got much deserved credit with his Best Supporting actor nomination, but Hoechlin steals the show.
266;i see nothing but good things coming from this young man in the future.
267;Jude Law turns in a haunting performance as the hitman.
268;this is a truly great film that was overlooked for Best Picture.
269;Sam Mendes is quickly becoming one of the best directors in Hollywood.
270;Tom Hanks's killer is a quiet, solemn man who is a devoted family man.
271;"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time
I:9607;272;The strong acting of all the actors, Hanks in particular, made this movie much better than the it would have been with other actors.
I:9607;273;I keep seeing time and time again how great an actor Hanks is, and this film was no exception.
I:9607;274;The excellent drama was lambasted by the humorous scenes that either precede or follow them.
I:9607;275;Remove the humor, and you've got 'Once Upon a Time in America', or better.
I:9607;276;fantastic film, one of Tom Hanks best films,Gripping from the startIf you like Tom Hanks films this is a must.
I:9607;277;talented, A. list essemble of actors.
I:9607;278;I'm glad to say that I made a wise choice.
I:9607;279;mY OVERALL THOUGHTS: First of all, the acting was mezmorising and all of the actors had great chemistry.
I:9607;280;Paul Newman is amazing as usual, and Jude Law was wonderful in a smaller role.
I:9607;281;The supporting cast, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Daniel Craig, Liam Aiken, etc. all did great jobs as well.
I:9607;282;Hence, I think the real star of this film is Tyler Hoechin, a young unknown actor who brilliantly portrayed the tough role of Michael Jr.
I:9607;283;He was the one that needed to bring the film together, since the story is seen from Michael Jr.'s eyes, and he did a superb job.
I:9607;284;The dialouge and storyline were amazing.
I:9607;285;Sam Mendes did a terrific directing job.
I:9607;286;The cinematography, sets, costumes, sound, and original musicical score are all stunning and absolutely gorgeous.
I:9607;287;it's always raining, snowing, or it's nighttime in this film!"""""""
288;, well that's because those weather elements help to show the emotions of the film.
289;"In my opinion, ""Road to Perdition"" is one of the best films of the year!"
290;If you like mob films, then this is definitely for you.
291;Also, if you like a film where father/son must struggle with their relationship, then you will probably enjoy it.
292;"But ""Road to Perdition"" is definitely a powerful film."
293;"It's a real ""art.y film"" and an ""actor's film""."
294;It is available in both wide screen and full frame formats.
295;I like to write fiction in my spare time and the writing in this movie is superb!
296;had me coming up with all sorts of responses and Tom Hanks showed the world what a brilliant actor he was by saying nothing and let it show in his eyes!
297;This is definitely one to own!
298;I'll start off by saying that I don't know much about the director or some of the other actors in the movie, but I figured that the movie would be good because Tom Hanks usually does some great movies such as Cast Away, Saving Private Ryan, and Green Mile to name a few.
299;During the movie, Mr. Rooney's jealous biological son, Conner (Daniel Craig), rashly murders Michael's wife and youngest son, setting Michael on a course of revenge in the belief that his surrogate father has betrayed him.
300;Father and son, bound by sorrow and a sense of guilt, grow closer as they elude an assassin and put into effect a clever plan .
301;Watching it in Blue Ray changed my perspective and made the viewing experience much more pleasurable.
302;Finally, I got the chance to see it and I have to admit: I was disappointed.
303;ok, it is a story about a mobster's son who discovers his father's true profession .
304;I was enthusiastic about seeing this film.
305;The cast and story really held a lot of promise, and reviews I had read up to that point were promising.
306;charged piece of entertainment, the pace is slow and methodical.
307;The Road To Perdition is an outstanding movie.
308;Just in short words, go see it!
309;It's worth every bit of the money.
310;The great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on.
311;He did himself proud as this is one of the best.
312;Huh?As good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is, the real star of this film is cinematographer Hall, who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens.
313;He can play any part great.
314;He makes a great gangster.
315;I will leave the actual film review up to others.
316;With an industry that pays so much attention to detail, why do they release products like this?
317;The Road to Perdition is a fine film, but for a film of such cinematic beauty, it feels very hollow in the center of it.
318;Tom Hanks is always a great screen presence as well as Paul Newman, but even with their combine star power, the movie falls flat with out some kind of internal dialog.
319;"Road to Perdition does an outstanding job capturing the violence and the ""code of ethics"" of the mob scene for this era."
320;Tom Hanks (Mike Sulivan) and Paul Newman (John Rooney) give very convincing performances in their roles.
321;Jude Law (Maguire) does an outstanding job playing a morbid but interesting hitman/photographer who is hired to kill Sulivan and his son.
322;The plot moves quick enough to keep you on the edge of your seat but also alows some pauses to show the human side of all of the characters.
323;This is rare in most mob movies where the characters are usually made out to be monsterous villans.
324;The cinematography greatly enhances the already emotionally charged plot.
325;I fell in love with the soundtrack and how it complemented the beautiful scenery.
326;I thought Tom Hanks did a great job as Michael Sullivan and Paul Newman was his usual outstanding self.
327;got better each time I saw it.
328;otherwise, it is a very interesting and well done film.
329;It keeps you in suspense through out the movie and the ending is very unexpected.
330;"Probably the best ending since ""6th Sense""."
331;both Hanks and Newman do a great job and the supporting actors are fine also.
332;The period scenary is fabulous transporting you back to the 30's.
333;This movie is so absolutely heartbreaking, the ending did nothing to lighten the mood of the film.
334;Even so, Road to Perdition is a wonderful movie of how one mans decisions can decide the future of his family and those surrounding him.
335;tom Hanks is wonderful as the hitman working to feed his family while keeping his two boys from finding out what he does.
336;What transpires between these three is the height and ending purpose to the entire movie.
337;jude Law, on the otherhand, is delightfully menacing.
338;The rest of the cast holds their own as well.
339;This was one of the finest works of literature I have ever encountered.
340;era Chicago, forced to go on the run with his young son, after the son sees Sullivan and Connor Rooney, the son of a powerful Mob.
341;The book and movie echo the classic Japanese Manga Lone Wolf and Cub, as father and son face incredible odds, leading to a fateful climax that will decide the boy's future.
342;Jude Law is excellent as the Homicidal crime.
343;scene photographer sent after the Sullivans, and Stanley Tucci does his usual great job as Frank Nitti.
344;Overall, it's a very good movie, but as usual, the book was better.
345;Director Sam Mendes' highly anticipated follow.
346;"winning masterpiece
I:9607;347;The film boasts an Academy Award.
I:9607;348;winning team both on and off screen.
I:9607;349;what follows is a wonderful tale of love and survival, in which Sullivan and his son must save their lives.
I:9607;350;the reunion of Sam Mendes and legendary DP Conrad Hall gives the film an unprecedented visual flair, a true feast for the eyes.
I:9607;351;The grayish monochromatic cinematography, the reflex of rain on the faces and walls (in a Sam Mendes film, rain marks the anticipation of death) and the touching Thomas Newman score are all works of genius.
I:9607;352;Not to mention Hanks' remarkable performance of a mysterious and mythic father figure.
I:9607;353;in my opinion, the scene of the murders in the rain is one of the best shot scenes in recent film history.
I:9607;354;It has all the elements of a great film yet ultimately it has no resonance for me.
I:9607;355;Tom Hanks is excellent as the hitman on the run from his former employers.
I:9607;356;Paul Newman, in the twilight of a great career, is even better as the mob boss.
I:9607;357;The few scenes that Hanks and Newman share are pure cinematic dynamite.
I:9607;358;Tyler Hoechlin as Hanks' young son is a natural.
I:9607;359;Jude Law delivers another good character performance as the hired gun/free.
I:9607;360;In smaller roles Daniel Craig, Dylan Baker, and Stanley Tucci also do good work.
I:9607;361;The direction by Sam Mendes is crisp and the story moves pretty good.
I:9607;362;The art direction and the cinematography are breathtaking.
I:9607;363;These criticisms aside, the film is worth checking out for all the things that do work.
I:9607;364;Loyalty between criminals is a myth as Road to Perdition makes abundantly clear.
I:9607;365;Sullivan is something of a stepson to Irish mob boss John Rooney (Paul Newman).
I:9607;366;He is also Rooney's number one enforcer and hit man.
I:9607;367;Connor murders Sullivan's wife and youngest son.
I:9607;368;Director Sam Mendes superbly brings us back to the year 1931 and the action is non.
I:9607;369;stop interspersed with riveting dialogue.
I:9607;370;There are occasional lapses in logic, but the incredible acting of the cast members allows you to overlook these minor difficulties.
I:9607;371;Road to Perdition is geared for an adult audience and easily earns five stars.
I:9607;372;Loved this movie the first time I saw it.
I:9607;373;Loved all of the cast.
I:9607;374;It is a classic that can be easily compared to the GodFather, and Good Fellas.
I:9607;375;Sam Mendes has crafted a beautifully haunting and visually spectaclar look at a local crime family in 1931.
I:9607;376;This is one of Hanks's best performances.
I:9607;377;In the first fifteen minutes of the movie he manages to do a considerable amount of outstanding acting without saying very much.
I:9607;378;paul Newman is wonderful as the family patriach.
I:9607;379;The script is top notch with a compelling storyline.
I:9607;380;The movie has an excellent supporting cast that includes Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Jude Law, and Jennifer Jason Lee.
I:9607;381;The are two other stand out performances by theactor that portrays Paul Newman's ambicious and jealous(of Tom Hanks)son, and the young actor that portrays Tom Hank's oldest son.
I:9607;382;if you are a fan of movie cinema.
I:9607;383;You will love this picture.
I:9607;384;Tom Hanks delivers his best preformance since Forest Gump.
I:9607;385;I won't do a long review here, but just to say this film was definitely worth the money and the time to watch it.
I:9607;386;The acting was very good and you are rivited.
I:9607;387;The director did an absolutely amazing job with camera placement and lighting to create some haunting and absolutely perfect shots that, I am sad to say, are not appreciated by most viewers.
I:9607;388;this movie comes with my highest recommendation.
I:9607;389;Really very good scenes that would have added to the story.
I:9607;390;Road to Perdition is a simple, gangster movie about fathers and sons.
I:9607;391;Tom Hanks, Paul Newman and Daniel Craig give great performances.
I:9607;392;The cinematography is beautiful, and the musical score feels of the period (early 1930s).
I:9607;393;The movie is beautifully shot, and, were I judging it based on the merits of its cinematography, would be inclined to give it five stars.Yet the movie fails utterly in its plot.
I:9607;394;This is no study of amorality like the much more entertaining and thought.
I:9607;395;It's absolute a riveting tale of what it truly was like for the criminal underworld.
I:9607;396;The main charachter Mike Sullivan, played by the talented Tom Hanks, is a hitman who works for the elder Rooney(played by Paul Newman) who has to hunt down Connor after his wife and one of his sons is murdered.
I:9607;397;Sullivan Sr. also has to protect his older son and now only surviving child, Michael Sullivan Jr. and prevent him from living a life like his father is.
I:9607;398;the conflicts in the movie truly bring out alot of emotions and create lots of suspense and emotions.
I:9607;399;The ending is very moving and will bring you to tears.
I:9607;400;by far one of the best movies and it truly deserves getting at lease on Oscar Award.
I:9607;401;*** Will the director have what it takes to rise above this pitfall?
I:9607;402;You'd think that Sam Mendes, whose direction of """"American Beauty"""" showed remarkable narrative and textural depth and admirably original ironies, would be one of the guys who could redeem themselves after such a palpably weak introduction."""
403;Tom Hanks, ever likeable, plays (oooh!)
404;year old son, forming a one.
405;Road to Perdition is so ambitious that any flaws it may have are made irrelevant by the film's grandiosity of vision, technical brilliance, and unique sensibility.
406;director Sam Mendes, legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall, brilliant composer Thomas Newman .
407;What they do share is a sense of boldness, narrative voices that are unique and distinctive.
408;hall's photography is once again superlative .
409;and the larger, more elegiac tone of this film allows him even more room to dazzle with his visual magic.
410;Thomas Newman's score is inscrutable, once again so intrinsically woven into the fabric of the film that it becomes a seamless part of the whole, enhancing the action rather than sticking out from it.
411;the acting as a whole is wonderful.
412;"Paul Newman still has the ability to ignite the screen with a look
I:9607;413;defined one for a good 45 minutes, and his repressed performance doesn't help.
I:9607;414;A good thing, for the film's emotional impact hinges on him, and from this point on he acquits himself well.
I:9607;415;Nonetheless, Hanks works well enough, even if he's one of the flawed elements.
I:9607;416;melting cinematography tends to keep you from becoming disengaged.
I:9607;417;one of Road to Perdition's greatest strengths is that it is unlike any other gangster film in history.
I:9607;418;Just for that, I'd recommend it as essential viewing.
I:9607;419;And there is more to be discovered.
I:9607;420;The """"Road to Perdition"""" is a film about relationships, family, ethnicity, community and very much about America."""
421;More specifically, it is a story about a son, one of two, and his father.
422;It is film with a lot of drive that gets it from the action in the story, more than from the dialogue.
423;Overall, it has an honesty that comes across from the direction, the actors, the costumes and the scenery/locations.
424;"The acting in the film was superb in that the ""stars"" (Paul Newman, Tom Hanks, Jude Law, Daniel Craig) were wonderfully balanced, resulting in an almost ensemble effect."
425;I think the appeal here is that I've seen the graphic novel of this movie, and I like Tom Hanks.
426;The mood was a little retro, a little dark, and Hanks definitely knows how to put some emotion and sympathy into a performance.
427;He was certainly a twisted character and played to perfection by Law.
428;to see this one at the theater!
429;This is a good example of a film noir.
430;What Michael does for a living isn't clear at the start but it soon emerges that he is a hit.
431;Nitti therefore himself hires another hit.
432;In a supporting role (though receiving star billing), Paul Newman gives an Actors Master Class performance, Tom Hanks, the star, bulked up to increase his menace, subdues it to businesslike killing, while the rest of the cast is exceptionally good.
433;While nothing is outside the stereotypes set by 1931, the plot and tone of the film are redolent of the contemporary mood.
434;If the genre appeal to you, this is a worthwhile way to spend your time.
435;Craig and Law are worthwhile in their roles as quirky, irredeemable psychopaths, but get so little screen time it's tough to develop an appreciation for the nuances of either.
436;I was a little skeptical at first about Tom Hanks playing a gangster, but he did a very good job of doing so.
437;At the climax of the movie I couldn't help but wonder why I ever doubted it, it was terrific.
438;For some reason I'd not seen this film when first released not long before Paul Newman's death, but in all respects I found it to be entertaining, with fine acting and included a pre Bond Daniel Craig sporting a convincing American (well, Bostonian) accent.
439;ROAD TO PERDITION was an incredible movie.
440;It is about a hitman in the 1930's, played by Tom Hanks and his family.
441;He, fearing for his life and that of his remaining son, Michael, go on the run.
442;Tom Hanks does an incredible job, along with Paul Newman, Jude Law, and the rest.
443;This, perhaps, is one of Tom Hanks' best accomplishments.
444;This is a morality play about two intelligent men that consciously and willingly made a pact with the Devil, trading temporal riches for their immortal souls.
445;technically the movie is excellent.
446;The weather, the times of day for certain scenes, uses of shadow, the music and the sound track give the movie tremendous depth.
447;The director cleverly intersperced scenes that developed the movie's characters with action scenes that developed the plot.
448;Great Drama and full of suspense.
449;Humor and truth to every part of it.
450;I love movies telling a story.
451;era gangsters with Tom Hanks outside his normal genre and doing an excellent portrayal of a mob hit man.
452;"Anyone who has ever met me can be asked what is Dwights favorite movie and they will all reply ""Road to Perdition""."
453;This movie is in every way a masterpiece.
454;"No to exclude other hits like ""Apollo 13"" and ""Philedelphia"", but ""Road to Perdition"" is the best movie he has ever did."
455;Jude Law pulls off the early 30's Chicago accent perfect.
456;The film, which is based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, tells the story of a family in a small mid.
457;Sullivan provides for his family and tries to shield his sons from the life that he leads.
458;this movie, at its heart, is the story about a father and son developing a relationship.
459;Mendes, director of American Beauty and Skyfall, is known for his carefully crafted films and gorgeous cinematography.
460;Mendes takes the time to introduce you to the Sullivans' world and the state of Sullivan and Michael's relationship at the start of the movie.
461;the direction and cinematography are wonderful, and film score, composed by Thomas Newman, is dark, searing, and hauntingly beautiful.
462;The acting in this film is also excellent.
463;Whoever cast this film did a great job.
464;As the movie progresses he grows and changes, and some of his scenes were so raw and emotional that they still move me to tears.
465;And Tyler Hoechlin, who grew up oh so nice, gives a moving performance as Michael, the boy who is forced to come of age and reconcile with his father during a time of violence and danger.
466;this film is one of my favorites because I love the time period, the actors all give incredible performances, and at its core, the story of the bond between a father and son is so powerful and moving.
467;Michael Sullivan is a hit man, a member of a large, extended family, the loving protege of Paul Newman's Mr. Rooney, a man so powerful that a wake for a fallen soldier whom he had whacked is cause for elevation of Rooney's soul.
468;The sets were constructed of the fine, dark polished wood one sees in older home construction, the rainy weather lends a metaphoric pall over the proceedings, and the scene where the Sullivans arrive in Chicago suspends disbelief entirely.
469;"The music is transporting
I:9607;470;Hanks performance is terrific and underated against his other work"
471;Mendes has done it again.
472;"down since it's directed by Sam Mendes, responsible for the masterful ""American Beauty."
473;This film is certainly very skillful in all the usual departments: acting, editing, script, cinematography.
474;distance distance and more distance.
475;the two main themes here are, fate and father/son dynamics.
476;Tom Hanks is always 'stellar'.
477;Asked for and got a refund on Amazon.
478;This film is beautifully shot.
479;Conrad Hall certainly deserved the Oscar for best cinematography, because this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies I've ever seen.
480;"One night, Sullivan goes to ""just talk"" with Rooney's son to one of his gangster cohorts."
481;What a wonderful follow up to American Beauty.
482;"With ""Road to Perdition"", we now have New Master getting to work with Old Master."
483;after so many years in the biz, it was great to see that somebody in Hollywood is wise to try and give Old Master some meaty roles this late in his career.
484;"While he himself was a rival to Redford for ""Hunk"" title, Old Master has always been the one who was the master of the craft of acting."
485;New Master takes on this role, but adds depth to it.
486;the plot is decent, in that we have New Master worrying about leading his son into the life he has chosen.
487;The fact that he has worries about his son proves he has doubts about whether he himself correctly chose the profession.
488;But it is the interraction between OM and NM that make the movie worth seeing.
489;also good is the filming itself.
490;Well, this movie is full of this.
491;Road to Perdition (Full Screen Edition)I really love this movie.
492;The unspoken love of a dad for his son and the adventures they experience, though frightening, bring them closer together up to the sad ending that suprised my family and I.
493;Well the day finally came and I sat down to watch this much anticipated movie.
494;He's just a great filmmaker.
495;The shots and camera angles he thinks up are amazing.
496;The cinematagraphy is also VERY well done.
497;Loved Tom Hanks and the rest.
498;The shootouts feel very real and draw you in.
499;This film is an instant classic in my book.
500;And will definitely be remembered in the oscars.
501;Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are fantastic in it, the cinematography is absolutely captivating, and the story line has everything between a battle against fate to Biblical overtones.
502;Rooney's son Conner (played by Daniel Craig) complicated things by plotting to push Sullivan out and Sullivan decides to take the boy (played by Tyler Hoechlin) to the safety of a relative's house in a town called Perdition, a fancy word for Hell.
503;More compellingly, the battle between Sullivan and Rooney's son Conner recalls the story of Cain and Abel.
504;The film ends like it begins, on the brightly lit beach .
505;heaven near the house in Perdition.
506;the brightly lit ending is particularly noticeable because of the gritty cinematography that makes most of the film feel almost as if it was shot in black and white (and more black than white).
507;In the end, it won only the award for cinematography in a year so weak that the rudderless Chicago won best picture and the formulaic Gangs of New York and that year's installment of the Lord of the Rings (Two Towers) were much better received.
508;"You do not get what you paid for
I:9607;509;The recently deceased Conrad L. Hall, known for his breathtaking cinematography in the classic Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and the more recent American Beauty, has filmed the most beautifully shot movie of the year.
I:9607;510;I expected to find this film dull and my interest level unsustainable, but it was unexpectedly dark and unexpectedly interesting.
I:9607;511;Sullivan goes on the run with his older son, both seeking revenge and seeking a surefire way to protect his son's life and prevent his son from traveling the same path he has.
I:9607;512;The film was well handled, subtly suspenseful and never dry, which helped it exceed my expectations.
I:9607;513;Having enjoyed """"American Beauty"""" immensely, I decided to see """"Road to Perdition"""" because I expected Sam Mendes' biting social criticism and intelligence."""

516;"The ""fantastic"" cinematography of the film consists of an overuse of the color brown, and water everywhere."
517;To start off this movie has to have the best cinemetography of recent movies.
518;The lighting and camera work by Conrad Hall is the some of the best I have seen in the neo.
519;This along with a great musical score by Thomas Newman who also did the music for the neo.

521;Listening to just the soundtrack gives the audience the impression of what is happening throughout the film.
522;The acting is beautiful as far as Jude Law, Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are concerned.
523;One of the only roles that Tom Hanks has played a bad guy and he plays it with much depth.
524;With being this cold blooder killer he also has a heart.
525;Sam Mendes, the director of American Beauty succeeds again with a brilliant direction of going through this tragedy from beginning to end.
526;At the end you feel for the characters with its bittersweet ending as in American Beauty.
527;noir movies this will take you back to the place when they first started in the 40's and will amaze you how lighting and camera work alone can make a film that much more beautiful than the drama and tragedy happening on the screen.
528;One of Paul Newman's best films ever.
529;plus a outstanding performance by Tom Hanks.
530;If you like old type gangster movies this is the film to watch.
531;Another Oscar worthy performance by the king of the big screen.
532;Everything about this movie was amazing.
533;I predict this being the Best Picture of 2002.
534;Arrived quickly, and is one that I enjoy viewing.
535;Road to Perdition is Greek.
536;Tom Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a mob enforcer who works for John Rooney, played wonderfully by Paul Newman.
537;What comes about is the film's central theme, and question: Is it possible for fathers to spare their sons from the costs of their sins?The film has some great performances, particularly from Newman, and Jude Law who plays a dispicable hitman/crime scene photographer.
538;Yet what stands out is the amazing cinematography from the 'Master of Darkness,' Conrad L. Hall.
539;Each shot presents a visceral chill that reverberates throughout the film.
540;"And in his sophomore effort following the acclaimed, ""American Beauty,"" Sam Mendes proves that he is a master craftsman."
541;Road to Perdition is a good film and worth watching, but there is something about it that prevented the film from being great.
542;Tom Hanks is an exceptional actor, but he is miscast in this role.
543;Road to Perdition is a still a good movie and definitely worth a look.
544;Nothing I can say about this great movie hasn't already been said, but I love it so dearly I must write about it.
545;"He knows he is less in his father's eyes than Michael is
I:9607;546;We see Michael in the role of enforcer only twice, and neither instance comes off as planned, but it is also clear that this is a man canny in the way of his profession and who knows exactly what needs to be done.
I:9607;547;michael has worked for John Rooney all his life, and has been rewarded with a good living and a nice house.
I:9607;548;He is married to a lovely woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh, in a small but effective role) and has two boys, Peter and Michael Jr.
I:9607;549;He witnesses something traumatic that he should never have seen, and sets in motion an epic journey as his father realizes the boy must be removed from the attentions of those who are running the show.
I:9607;550;the acting in this film is superb all around.
I:9607;551;Thomas Newman was nominated for a score that is haunting and beautiful .
I:9607;552;and which complements the film perfectly, creating an evocative, atmospheric audio background without being overpowering.
I:9607;553;There are great smaller roles"
554;"hire
I:9607;555;the film benefits from an excellent script and great direction from Sam Mendes.
I:9607;556;age, I absolutely loved it.
I:9607;557;There is some attraction to that kind of material.
I:9607;558;Its esthetics, however, is quite colorful : it may not be a very interesting movie, but it's really beautiful.
I:9607;559;tom Hanks, as an Irish mafia hitman, is dependable as usual.
I:9607;560;The movie is wonderfully acted, and the visuals, as Ebert says, are a limbo of darkness, shadow, night, fearful faces half.
I:9607;561;Tom Hanks is an excellent actor, and he portrays with uttermost skill the complex inner world of a gangster who must protect his son.
I:9607;562;The production set is very nice, and the pace of the movie, while deliberately slow, manages to engage the audience well.
I:9607;563;He's got way too much conscience.
I:9607;564;Road to Perdition is an elegant and restrained drama about the bond between fathers and sons.
I:9607;565;michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a well known hit man, working for John Rooney (Paul Newman) in Depression.
I:9607;566;david Self's script is simple, subtle, and straightforward.
I:9607;567;It presents some interesting issues concerning redemption, fathers, sons, and violence.
I:9607;568;Despite the script being occasionally predictable, Sam Mendes's superb direction allows for quite a bit of tension.
I:9607;569;the performances in Perdition are fantastic, particularly Hanks and Newman.
I:9607;570;Hanks's performance is one of his finest, to date.
I:9607;571;His performance ranks alongside the great Al Pacino performances.
I:9607;572;Like Pacino, Hanks is able to show a great deal of emotion through total silence.
I:9607;573;Jude Law leaves quite an impression, for having such little screentime, as Hanks and his son's pursuer.
I:9607;574;apart from great performances, Perdition boasts stunning set and costume designs, a grand musical score, and deliberate"
575;Based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, which was in turn based very loosely on various factual stories of the 1930s, THE ROAD TO PERDITION tells the story of Michael Sullivan, a family man and thoroughly nice guy who also happens to be an enforcer and hit man for the Irish Mob.
576;Sullivan strives to keep his homelife separate from his work.
577;"Determined to both protect his son and have revenge on the mob boys who have suddenly turned on him, Sullivan goes on the run with Michael, and in the process finally ""finds his heart"" through his determination that young Michael will never walk his road."
578;there is a great deal to like about this film.
579;The cinematography is astonishingly beautiful and extremely well supported by the editing, which is among the best I've ever seen, and the soundtrack, which lends the story a meloncholy depth.
580;Many of the cast members are also exceptional, most particularly Jude Law, who creates perhaps the most chilling killer seen on screen in a decade.
581;This was quite an original idea, and very intriguing, so I was doubly frustrated when the film took yet another predictable twist that effectively negated that rather large chunk of film time.
582;Hanks is an extraordinary actor, and the role of a hitman seemed a unique opportunity for him to blow off the super.
583;likeable parts for which he has become famous.
584;when all is said and done, what is left is a film that essentially holds you by virtue of sheer cinematic technique.
585;THE ROAD TO PERDITION has an amazing sense of style and creates an amazing visual portrait of the era, and that.
586;held my interest to the end.
587;Now, this film has garnered many fans, and I say if you can get something out of it, more power to you, and it will be well worth the investment.
588;That a movie with gore events can ultimately be summed up as an aesthetic work can be largely attributed to the magnificent work of cinematographer Conrad L Hill and to the script as well.
589;Deaths are shown in the eyes of a young lad, in the reflection of a mirror, through the glass of a window, while jazz music is entertaining people in the next room.
590;'Depression' can be constantly felt throughout the film .
591;be it weather, be it light, be it Tom Hank's face.
592;The brilliant music of the movie (by Tomas Newman) interestingly keeps a well maintained distance from the ongoing carnage on the screen.
593;Its truly wonderful music, can be termed as an asset of the movie.
594;that the entire episode of six weeks is observed and told by a young boy is another new angle to a gangster movie.
595;Still the very manner this movie narrates the story is something new.
596;To the contrary, I felt that he played the role perfectly.
597;The great thing about Tom Hanks is that like Harrison Ford he does a good job portraying an ordinary person.
598;I found this movie to be very touching and down to earth, exploring both the relationship of father and son and the hurt of lost loved ones.
599;Much closer to the Hanks of Saving Private Ryan than to the Hanks of Sleepless in Seattle that some might always view him as.
600;Still, the sheer craft displayed herein makes the film remarkable.
601;The performances are all perfect, the score, while perhaps overly conventional, is powerful and emotive, the cinematography is consistently stunning and the period detail is utterly convincing.
602;Again, this is a world we've seen before, but it's more fully realized then ever before, and it makes the film nearly mesmerizing even in the scenes where little is actually going on.
603;Also, there's one scene late in the film, a firefight in the streets during fierce storm, which is simply breath taking.
604;It's definitely one of the most powerful examples of pure cinema I've seen in a long time.Yeah, that's it.
605;Just a stunningly well made film.
606;A great performance by Tom Hanks, and one of the best story lines in the last 20 years.
607;also Jude Law added to the suspense.
608;This Mafia film gives good insight into this tenuous type of living of the 1930's, and Chicago was well.
609;paul Newman and Tom Hanks were outstanding, nearly at their best in their careers.
610;Though Newman is depicted as a smart.
611;He is totally serious, awe.
612;inspiring, and a heartless betrayer.
613;And while Hanks was a good.
614;"spirited, evil, and heartless person to be feared
I:9607;615;To recapitulate, this Mafia movie was well done, good acting and action were found, there were good gnostalgia effects, and an excellent insight into the gangster type of lifestyle was present.
I:9607;616;What a way to start a day.
I:9607;617;I saw this in a typically sun shiny morning and I can tell you if you are up for a depressing yet wonderful film to jumpstart your day, I suggest Road to Perdition.
I:9607;618;Sam Mendes and the writers managed to excellently blend a father.
I:9607;619;Paul Newman as the aging mob boss was great as well.
I:9607;620;One minute you hate him for betraying his loyal right.
I:9607;621;Yes, he was spot on with his performance too.
I:9607;622;the best scene in the entire film would probably be when Michael Sullivan ambushed John Rooney and his mob thugs drenched in rain.
I:9607;623;Very poetic scene to be remembered for ages.
I:9607;624;To date, this is the best picture of the year (of course, the end of the year's biggies are yet to be released).
I:9607;625;Combining the awesome power of Conrad Hall's exquisite cinematography, the heart.
I:9607;626;pumping melodramatic sound of Thomas Newman's score, the top notch acting of Hanks, Newman and Law (as well as the rest of the cast), Director Sam Mendes has provided us with a 2nd consecutive great film.
I:9607;627;In addition to a great story, one that is simple and easy to follow, Mendes has woven a film that says more with silence, facial expressions, long shots and music than I have seen in a long time.
I:9607;628;Hanks is one great actor.
I:9607;629;Newman is a treasure (best supporting actor for 2002?)
I:9607;630;Tyler Hoechlin is very good.
I:9607;631;And the film has one of the best endings I've ever seen that uplifts your soul after being so down just a few minutes before the end.
I:9607;632;Go see this movie more than once.
I:9607;633;You'll be moved and inspired even more the second and third times.
I:9607;634;Two great actors at the top of their games .
I:9607;635;newman is just unflinchingly believable and exudes charm and power and lethality.
I:9607;636;All of the actors are amazing .
I:9607;637;the cinematography is astounding (maybe a bit too beautiful for the topic).
I:9607;638;Now that's a good mob movie set in the 1930s, only done in a very artistic and entertaining way.
I:9607;639;if I could give it more than 5 stars, I would!
I:9607;640;Nice guys truly do finish last, is the appropriate phrase for this guy.
I:9607;641;After an interesting yet overhyped directorial debut with American Beauty , Sam Mendes returned with this flawed sophomore release that again tries to give some insight into a darker american way of life .
I:9607;642;While Road to Perdition has some good cinematography, convincing acting (Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law), a well.
I:9607;643;done score and an impressive photography going for it, the plot is too predictable, unsurprising and replete with overdone cliches.
I:9607;644;I`m still curious about his next effort, though, and truly hope it will be above this so.
I:9607;645;tom Hanks is capable of way better stuff than this.
I:9607;646;Fascinating scenario, wonderful screenplay, some marvelous performances and beautiful to look at.
I:9607;647;which seemingly has most of the elements of a great picture .
I:9607;648;There are, to be sure, some wonderfully riveting performances by an almost uniformly excellent cast, but these performances feel like they belong in another, more deserving, and ultimately better movie.
I:9607;649;Not the most action packed of the ganster genre, but one of the most beautiful to watch since Miller's Crossing.
I:9607;650;it is one I shall watch again at least once a year.
I:9607;651;Tom Hanks and Paul Newman were great in this movie.
I:9607;652;Because of what part he played.
I:9607;653;The whole story line to this movie was fantastic.
I:9607;654;I was eager to see this movie when it came out a year ago"
655;But I have to admit: the reason that made me look forward to it was Tom Hanks's presence.
656;"He's always been one of the actors I have adored the most during the nineties
I:9607;657;And one of the best things about him is that while many actors submit themselves to the """"one for the purse and one for the heart"""" rule, he's one of those few actors who make movies that are both excellent artistically and make big bucks at the box office."""
658;He's both a great actor and a movie star.
659;Sean Pen is a great actor, Pacino is a great actor, De Niro, Duvall, Hoffman, Spacey, these guys are great actors.
660;Tom Cruise is a movie star, Bruce Willis is a movie star, Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan, Sandler, Schwarzeneger, these are movie stars.
661;Tom Hanks is both, and right now I can't think of someone else who is, except Jack Nicholson.
662;"Hanks has an enormous screen presence and an extremely spontaneous acting style: he can play melodrama without resorting to melodramatics
I:9607;663;it suddenly dawned on me that I actually wrote a review about Hanks and not about """"Road to Perdition"""", but frankly, Tom's play was the best thing this movie brought to my attention."""
664;Sam Mendes is truly a genius, visually in particular because he's worked side by side in his only two films with the late Conrad L. Hall to attain Best Cinematography Oscars for each of them.
665;Hanks handles it superbly and is very credible.
666;The strory is also very touching.
667;The complicity that develops between the father and the son due to the circumstances is handled with an intriguing care.
668;A great moment of cinema.
669;All this accompanied by nice views throughout the movie and a beautiful music had me spend a marvelous couple of hours that I expect from any movie.
670;Great story of a man torn between two worlds, something I think alot of people can identify with.
671;Good gangster flick with a good underlying story.
672;His character sucks you right into his pain.
673;Newman, Tucci and Law turn in solid performances as they always do.
674;It's a great teaming of stars that no one thought would happen.
675;Newman is excellent as the aging Irish crime lord whose son is jealous of the foster father.
676;newman and Hanks are outstanding in their roles, they are two of America's finest actors.
677;Is there really a good guy in this movie?
678;Our sympathies certainly are with Hanks.
679;The story is a little thin and this is why I gave the rating that I did, but the bottom line is the movie is entertaining.
680;I went to see this movie with great expectation of the director, actors, and more.
681;I was blown away by the beauty of it all.
682;One must realize that this story is a dramatic ensemble that follows the development of a father.
683;He lets you see how his home.
684;The boy in the video does a great job throughout the film.
685;All of the other actors (Jude Law, Paul Newman, etc.) pulled off a great performance that completed the story.
686;This film is a delight to watch.
687;It truly is the most cinematically beautiful film I have ever seen.
688;With this great film projecting in front of you, it's the music that pulls you all the way into the story and times.
689;I have never seen such a great work of art.
690;It truly is a Sam Mendes work where the fight scenes are shot like love scenes and the love scenes are shot like fight scenes.
691;"Ranking alongside ""Signs,"" ""Gangs of New York,"" and ""The Two Towers,"" ""The Road to Perdition"" is one of 2002's very best films, and one that wil be remembered and cherished for years to come."
692;breking indictment of the criminal life, and a love story between father and son.
693;"Hanks is stellar, as usual
I:9607;694;The Road to Perdition is easily one of the best 'mafia' films ever made .
I:9607;695;Truly, this film speaks to the soul.
I:9607;696;I watched this an was amazed at the great cinematography that made this story much more powerful than I expected.
I:9607;697;I then read how the cinematographer had won the Oscar for this film.
I:9607;698;The Road to Perdition"""" offers a gripping drama of 1930s gangsters, in which Tom Hanks adds to his already prodigious resume by playing a hit man."""
699;Tom's character, Michael Sullivan, is a team player in a gangster organization and is well loved by the boss, played by the still great, aging Paul Newman.
700;Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant.
701;I thought the pace was perfect.
702;And when an atrocity occurs, he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge.
703;They rob abanks and much more and build a bond.
704;Hanks does a great job as always as well as Jude Law who plays his creepy role to perfection.
705;This drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the 1930s were.
706;I rank it one of the top 10 among 300 movies I have been.
707;"Road to Perdition is a serious movie
I:9607;708;Road to Perdition is one best of this kind.
I:9607;709;The theme is great: I have never seen any other movie that tells so much and so well about father's love for son.
I:9607;710;The plot is thrilling: once you start you cannot put it down.
I:9607;711;The music is wonderful too.
I:9607;712;Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, and Jude Law all give excellent casting.
I:9607;713;Sam Mendes, the director, should be given full credit too, because the directing of the movie is perfect.
I:9607;714;One of the best movies ever!
I:9607;715;Great acting, good lines and good story.
I:9607;716;it is a great cast and the acting is great.
I:9607;717;father who has to take his son and run for their lives after his wife and other son are killed by one of his partners , is a good plot.
I:9607;718;Both Tom Hanks and Paul Newman acted their parts well.
I:9607;719;If you really enjoy the 1930's Mobster Era, you will probably like this film.
I:9607;720;I have always been a Tom Hanks fan and I think that this is a very good movie.
I:9607;721;This film portrays the character of Tom Hanks as the dichotomy of the caring, loyal family man who is also a top enforcer for a faction of the gangsters akin to Al Capone.
I:9607;722;You are able to see what Tom Hanks' character sees when he is betrayed and members of his family are executed.
I:9607;723;He must protect his last remaining son and himself from those that wanted to kill his entire family.
I:9607;724;this is another fine performance for Mr. Hanks.
I:9607;725;Watching this film you will once again be entertained by his performance.
I:9607;726;every shot in this movie is breathtaking, from mob hits (especially the last one, my jaw was to the floor), to the first glance at chicago city, it is a work of art.
I:9607;727;Tom Hanks doesnt smile once in this, or show much expression at all, but when he does, you can see just how good of an actor he is.
I:9607;728;Paul Newman gives a powerful preformance as well.
I:9607;729;This oddball of a hit man steals the show, and reassures the fact that Law will always play """"the creepy guy"""" and should be remembered in the oscar race."""
730;However it is still the best film of the year so far (along with Minority Report and Insomnia), and is well worth your money.
731;"Sam Mendes' ""Road to Perdition"" is for sure the most incredible motion picture of the year."
732;Jude Law and Paul Newman gave exceptional performances as well.
733;packed, special effects thriller, rather a slower moving, yet still very interesting piece of art.
734;One more film about the end of prohibition and Al Capone.
735;One more film on the mafia, both Italian and Irish.
736;He protects him and takes under his wing another man, Michael Sullivan, to transfer his paternal love onto someone worth it.
737;Unluckily a detail one night brings the son of this latter man, Michael Sullivan Jr., into the act of witnessing the son of the mafia boss killing another good man on the spur of his anger.
738;As far as I am concerned this is the first real gangster film since 1992's CASINO and if you have ever seen the two masterpieces that are the best movies in American history (Godfather Parts 1 and 2) you know that almost without exception mob movies are always great.
739;I don't know what Hank's character is named but I am fairly sure he was a real man and of course Capone is real as well.
740;everyone is great in this movie.
741;Of course Paul Newman is great.
742;The costumes are also exceptionaly well done.
743;The lighting is good (one thing that made the Godfather).
744;The plot is very interesting and sort of glorifies the mob and brow beats it all the same time, another element of the Godfather.
745;the bottomline is with Star Wars, Spider.
746;This makes the title great and sort of a subject of conversation.
747;can this movie have the impact of the Godfather?Can it be as good as the Godfather?Will it be fun?Will it be an Oscar.
748;This is a great film that's well.
749;written (that's not to say it doesn't have some issues), perfectly directed, and beautifully filmed.
750;The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen and some of Conrad Hall's best work.
751;He definitely deserved the Oscar that he got for it.
752;Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, and Jude Law are fantastic.
753;Daniel Craig and the kid are okay.
754;Overall an excellent film and one of my favorites.
755;The director's commentary is very insightful.
756;This movie deserves accolades and applause for being one of the best movies made last year.
757;star cast, Jude Law, Stanley Tucci, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and including the amazing Paul Newman who plays his role with dignity.
758;He is an actor, first and foremost, and he can carry off any role he plays.
759;but let's get to the real reason this film is amazing.
760;Bringing back a 30's gangster drama, with a strong emphasis on drama.
761;Sure there is a lot of killing and death in the film, but it is vital and relevant to the plot.
762;It's a very strong story, as Hanks needs to do what he needs to do to carry out his new mission in life.
763;From the moment the film opens to the closing credits, it's strong and real.
764;While it is slow, it is the characters that drive it that speed, and spending every second with them is an amazing experience.
765;the true star of the film, though, is the incredible direction of Sam Mendes, and the absolutely beautiful cinematography.
766;This is a film to be cherished, relished like a fine wine.
767;Each scene is perfectly crafted to convey its purpose and meaning to the highest degree.
768;It almost seems like you can watch each frame with the sound off, and it still resounds with strong emotional impact.
769;Mendes has set a high bar in the art of filmmaking with his newest contribution.
770;the road was an incredible journey from start to finish.
771;Sit back, relax, and enjoy this cinematic masterpiece.
772;the road to Perdition is one favorite in my collection i watch over and over yearly.
773;I will say that Tyler Hoechlin did a fine performance and I hope we will see him in other films as he becomes mature as an actor.
774;"It was good to see Paul Newman in a movie again even though he does play a ""heavy""."
775;"Seeing Tom Hanks as a ""heavy""/father sends chills up my spine, however one of his early films, he did play a murderer."
776;Best to watch this film in the standard version.
777;One of the best movies that I have seen this year.
778;From the beginning to the end you will stay on the edge of your seat.
779;This is a must see movie.
780;blooded killer on one hand, and a loving family man on the other.
781;paul Newman delivers a high.
782;caliber performance as the mob boss that Hanks works for.
783;I can't think of anyone who would have fit this role better than Newman and his performance is incredible.
784;"It's not just his incredibly bad teeth in this movie that makes him creepy
I:9607;785;This was a good change of pace for Tom Hanks.
I:9607;786;He was able to show his versatility .
I:9607;787;And, of course, Paul Newman was wonderful as he always is and, of course, he got ripped off at the Academy Awards .
I:9607;788;It's a very good picture .
I:9607;789;But if you want some wonderful acting and a good script .
I:9607;790;this is the picture for you!
I:9607;791;Depravity need be no more exciting than piety, nor need it be easy to digest, and for those those reasons """"Road to Predition"""" shines."""
792;It explores the darkeness that exists within conflicted characters in a more subtle and complex manner than the average movie goer obviously can handle.
793;Road to Perdition was a fantastic film.
794;It's connection to family was really what the movie's objective was.
795;It had a good acting cast and a herat felt soundtrack.
796;My eyes were glued to the screen the entire time.
797;I enjoyed it very much and would give it a 3 and a half star rating if I were a newspaper critic.
798;Remember how delicious it looked, and you knew, from the packaging, that it must be tasty and you would be working on it for a good two weeks?
799;Sam Mendes (American Beauty) new film Road to Perdition, based on the graphic novel of the same name, manages to illicit the same feelings and thats about the only feeling it creates.
800;character into the most memorable one in the film.
801;like last years A Beautiful Mind, Road to Perdition smacks of Oscar grooming.
802;Road to Perdition is beautiful and tasty, but its all fluff and style with zero in the substance department.
803;written, finely acted, and beautifully filmed.
804;A couple of the characters are a little too thinly filled out for my liking, but overall, this movie is wonderful to watch.
805;actually, the story of the father coming to realize how much he means to his son .
806;Tom Hanks and Paul Neuman both fill their roles completely, making it easy to believe that they truly are the men they portray.
807;The young man who plays Hanks' son is excellent as well.
808;I don't often give a movie 5 stars, but this one deserves it.
809;Perfect cast, perfect cinematography, perfect script, perfect score, perfect direction, You've got Cool Hand Luke, James Bond and Forrest Gump in the same movie.
810;But the star is a 12 year old.
811;"A masterfull piece of work by the new great filmmaker Sam Mendes, director of ""American Beauty"" (1999)."
812;"This is the 2nd best gangter movie of all time which is ""Road to Perdition"" (2002)."
813;It also sure is one of the best looking movies of all time, great look!
814;"Conrad L. Hall's spectacular cinematography is sure to win a oscar, Tom Hanks is yet again great
I:9607;815;rate"
816;"And the one other great thing about this movie is the great production design
I:9607;817;the film is dark on subject matter, which it could be hard to watch at times, but it is without a doubt a masterpiece.
I:9607;818;I forgot about the music!
I:9607;819;The musical score by Thomas Newman is fantastic, the music will definately get an oscar nomination.
I:9607;820;Sam Mendes and Steven Spielberg (who directed one of my favorite films of the year """"Minority Report"""") will have a face."""
821;Sam Mendes really knows what he's doing!
822;Michael Sullivan (Hanks) is the right.
823;hand man for crime boss John Rooney, played superbly by veteran actor Paul Newman.
824;This fills Michael with rage and revenge against his former crime family, but also fills him with a new.
825;found sense of love and responsibility for his son Michael Jr. the acting throughout the film is excellent.
826;Hanks turns in one of his best acting performances as Sullivan, while timeless Paul Newman is wonderful as John Rooney.
827;Jude Law is also a standout as Maguire, a chilling hit man/photographer.
828;I would rate this film on the level of other Hanks films such as Saving Private Ryan and Forrest Gump .
829;You must watch the film carefully and let the story develop, but the ending is worth the wait.
830;Retribution is sought and Sullivan recruits his son to help him carry out a plan to do so.
831;The scenery and the sets are detailed beautifully for the period and Newman and Hanks give very solid performances.
832;There are a lot of Father son dichodomies in this movie.
833;I first heard about this film way back in the summer of 2001, and had been itching to see it for a whole year 'til I finally saw it in theaters exactly a year ago.
834;And we most certainly can't leave out the superb acting by the very talented Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Daniel Craig, and of course Jude Law.
835;And newcomer Tyler Hoechlin I was actually impressed with.
836;I've known for years that he's a very talented and versatile actor, and when I heard he'd be playing a disturbed crime scene photographer who moonlights as a hitman, I could not wait to see him in this film.
837;I knew he would be perfect for the part, and I knew he would bring such an incredible and enormous presence to the movie.
838;I really think he made Maguire interesting and appealing enough to have the storyline delve into some more character development on his part.
839;He was just so great to watch.
840;all in all, wonderful film.
841;A very nice comeback from Sam Mendes after winning the Oscar for 'American Beauty' 2 years prior.
842;It's got some interesting deleted scenes, excellent director commentary, and an HBO first look documentary.
843;Tom Hanks delivers in this film.
844;Just another great movie starring this actor.
845;A must see if you enjoy his movies!
846;Go see Road to Perdition.
847;That's pretty much all I have to say.
848;I'll go on about all of the top.
849;notch acting, cinemetogaraghy, production design, music, etc., but the point here is to see it.
850;Anyway, the acting is the best I've seen this whole year, with stellar performances by Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Jude Law, and Daniel Craig.
851;The scenes between Tom Hanks and Paul Newman were great.
852;Of course, it's always great to see two phenomonal actors on.
853;More importantly, the chemistry between Tom Hanks and Tyler Hoechlin (his son in the movie) is wonderful.
854;the production design is also very noteworthy.
855;The music is also great, giving an epic, but sad, look at the movie.
856;all in all: Road to Perdition is a modern masterpiece, complete with phenomonal acting, great music, fantastic production design, and heart.
857;The movie was well done and the story line, truly touching.
858;This is one of Tom Hanks best movies yet.
859;tom Hanks was spectacular and mob characters were very believable to me.
860;Paul Newman was also excellent as a mob boss.
861;the mob mentality is a chilling one and it was portrayed well in this film.
862;even worthy of not being seen.
863;"reflected morality from some of the key characters
I:9607;864;i truly believe this to be one of the best films shown in 2002.
I:9607;865;It will stir your thoughts, twist at your mind, and ultimately bend your views on morality, loyalty, and a commitment to family, whether they're right or wrong.
I:9607;866;Te Road to Perdition is a very good movie.
I:9607;867;I believe it to be one of Tom Hanks's very best.
I:9607;868;The acting is outstanding and the story itself is superb.
I:9607;869;The Road to Perdition has a great cast, a good script and high production values, although its ironically expensive, Depression (1931) setting seems oddly out of place in post.9/11 production.
I:9607;870;Tom Hanks, fresh from the remarkable HBO production of Band of Brothers , seemed to nudge Perdition into Oscar nomination territory by the sheer resonance of his transportable, good.
I:9607;871;he's too good for the role of Sullivan, a family hit man who works for Mr. Rooney , the latter played with great depth by an appropriately wizened Paul Newman.
I:9607;872;the Perdition story's undertow goes essentially like this: Your puppy is fine .
I:9607;873;This is a great movie!
I:9607;874;Would highly recommend it to any one!If you liked good fellas, then you will love this movie, (specially in H D blu.
I:9607;875;Hanks is a beloved husband, and hit.
I:9607;876;man, an amusing stretch I know.
I:9607;877;He works for Irish mobster boss Paul Newman, Hanks' 12 year old boy sees a gangland hit he shouldn't forcing the two on the road after the murder of the rest of Hanks' family.
I:9607;878;There were some nice cinematic touches like the Tommy gun flashing out of the shadows during Hanks and Newman's final showdown in the rain.
I:9607;879;This movie ranks in my top five of all time.
I:9607;880;Great acting, great story, great directing and beautifully shot.
I:9607;881;beat performance in this one.
I:9607;882;Beautiful cinematography does not a great movie make.
I:9607;883;One of the most overrated films of all time.
I:9607;884;Though Rooney has an adult son, Connor (Daniel Craig), he regards Michael with the affection reserved for the son he wishes he'd had.
I:9607;885;Sullivan himself has a wife and two boys.
I:9607;886;This is a powerful tale of the dynamic that exists between fathers and sons: John and Connor, Michael and Michael, Jr., and John and Michael.
I:9607;887;This is a Guy Story to be sure.
I:9607;888;Much of the magnificent cinematography is done in the dark, brooding atmospheres that one could expect in the Male's Cave.
I:9607;889;star of yesterday, and Hanks, the mega.
I:9607;890;star of today, play a piano duet (for real).
I:9607;891;But the sentimental favorite of ROAD TO PERDITION has to be the former, and I foresee a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.
I:9607;892;Newman's blue eyes continue to shine out of a face that age (and perhaps cosmetic surgery) has only made more striking.
I:9607;893;Moreover, Paul's Rooney expresses more raw emotion in his relationship with his son than Tom's Sullivan can manage in his.
I:9607;894;Perhaps this was an intentional part of the script, or perhaps it's a reflection of the accomplished old pro that Newman is and Hanks has yet to be.
I:9607;895;And Law is especially good as the sinister and creepy Maguire whose hits provide fodder for his day job.
I:9607;896;i liked this film a lot because it focuses on the nature of the father/son relationship, something which Tinseltown usually ignores.
I:9607;897;This is likely to be one of the better films of 2002.
I:9607;898;Road to Perdition was hands down one of the best movies of 2002.
I:9607;899;In a year that saw most of the movie going publics dollars being taken by bad super hero movies and stale romantic comedies ROAD stood above it all.
I:9607;900;this is perhaps Tom Hanks best role.
I:9607;901;But the movies itself is incredible.
I:9607;902;I loved tom hanks and the whole cast, even though it's kinda violent.
I:9607;903;It has quite the cast of characters.
I:9607;904;I immediatley noticed that camera shots in this movie reminded me of a comic book.
I:9607;905;The camera angles the director used were all revealing and unique.
I:9607;906;I thought that the graphic novel must have helped the director out alot.
I:9607;907;The two Sullivan's ride across the country robbing banks to make money while Michael tries to avoid getting killed by the hitman, played smartly by Jude Law, and avenge his wife and child's death.
I:9607;908;The conflicts within the story make for some great action and suspense as well as some emotionally moving moments.
I:9607;909;The ending is just great.
I:9607;910;It is a sad ending but it is well deserved considering the build.
I:9607;911;The director did an excellent job and all the actors gave powerful performances.
I:9607;912;The film, which is based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, tells the story of a family in a small mid.
I:9607;913;Sullivan provides for his family and tries to shield his sons from the life that he leads.
I:9607;914;this movie, at its heart, is the story about a father and son developing a relationship.
I:9607;915;Mendes, director of American Beauty and Skyfall, is known for his carefully crafted films and gorgeous cinematography.
I:9607;916;Mendes takes the time to introduce you to the Sullivans' world and the state of Sullivan and Michael's relationship at the start of the movie.
I:9607;917;the direction and cinematography are wonderful, and film score, composed by Thomas Newman, is dark, searing, and hauntingly beautiful.
I:9607;918;The acting in this film is also excellent.
I:9607;919;Whoever cast this film did a great job.
I:9607;920;As the movie progresses he grows and changes, and some of his scenes were so raw and emotional that they still move me to tears.
I:9607;921;And Tyler Hoechlin, who grew up oh so nice, gives a moving performance as Michael, the boy who is forced to come of age and reconcile with his father during a time of violence and danger.
I:9607;922;this film is one of my favorites because I love the time period, the actors all give incredible performances, and at its core, the story of the bond between a father and son is so powerful and moving.
I:9607;923;I bought this for my son because he loved this movie.
I:9607;924;He was very excited to receive it as a gift.
I:9607;925;But my son loved it.
I:9607;926;THis was well acted drama.
I:9607;927;well look at the cast!
I:9607;928;I kept it to watch again some day.
I:9607;929;Road to Perdition (2002) comes to us from director Sam Mendes, the man who brought us """"American Beauty"""" (1999)."""
930;the film is set during the Great Depression Era, about 1931.
931;An underlying theme emerging throughout the movie deals with the nature of father/son relationships.
932;The cinematographer, Conrad Hall, won an Academy Award for his work on this film praising the creation of vitality through visual symbolism.
933;Despite Sullivan's loyalty, Connor takes matters into his own hands for covering his tracks.
934;After sending Sullivan to certain death, Connor kills Sullivan's wife and son, Anne and Peter, believing Peter is Michael Jr., the witness.
935;laundering banks with the help of his son, Michael Jr., driving get.
936;i bought this movie as a gift for my brother, its one of his favorite movies.
937;Its a very well done movie and the actors are phenomenal, and it gives a realistic feeling often lost in these sorts of movies.
938;If these are things you or someone you know like to explore, I'd recommend the movie.
939;Sam Mendes' The Road to Perdition is an elegant mix of a good story, with evocative cinematography, and excellent acting making for a haunting period piece.
940;the Road to Perdition is really a son's story about his father and how he got to know him in a six week period.
941;He goes off to work everyday and provides for his family.
942;And a rather good one at that, he's the right hand man, enforcer for Paul Newman's mob boss, John Rooney.
943;After which Hanks' Michael Sullivan uses all the tools and skills at his disposal to avenge his family's murder to reach a conclusion that defies expectations and most clich s. the acting is all around excellent, from Paul Newman's Oscar nominated performance as John Rooney.
944;Tom Hanks is surprising in this role, Michael Sullivan is essentially a hitman and Hanks plays to type, he may not be the smartest but he is good in his job.
945;Jude Law turns in an excellent performance letting himself look and be ugly as Maguire, a death photographer who if his subject isn't quite dead isn't above finishing off the job.
946;based on a graphic novel by Max Collins, The Road to Perdition stays true to graphic novel origins.
947;A lot of the shots are taken right from the pages of the graphic novel and it doesn't look gimmicky, as a matter of fact it sets the tone for the nostalgic feeling the fictional storyteller is telling, the story of his father.
948;It also gives the movie a somewhat unique feel and in certain cases makes it a more interesting movie.
949;It's a really good movie.
950;All of the actors turn in good performances, particularly Hanks, Newman, and the young man who plays Hanks' son.
951;This was a surprisingly good movie.
952;Road to Perdition is THE best movie of the summer.
953;funny movie with Hanks, again, not being the character you thought you knew.
954;The mood is somber, the 1931 period effects are beautiful.
955;The sound track is haunting.
956;The eerie, silent scene where Sullivan takes down Rooney's crew all around him is a masterpiece.
957;That seems to be very true as this 1930's era gangster melodrama starts to unfold.
958;In the eyes of the mob, Sullivan and his whole family must pay the ultimate price.
959;on the other side of the equation is the Mob's patriarical boss (masterfully played by Paul Newman) and his own hateful, grown son(Daniel Craig), who has started all this trouble.
960;both fathers must now protect their sons (physically and spiritually).
961;director, Sam Mendes (of American Beauty fame) has masterfully crafted a morality tale (written by Max Allen Collins and Richard Piers Raynor) that seems to touch all emotions.
962;everyone in this cast is at the top of their craft.
963;tom Hanks is wonderful in his reserved and studied reading of the hitman/father.
964;Paul Neuman gives one of the best performances of his career as the torn mob boss.
965;this movie is just so well done in every way.
966;the cinematography of this film is fantastic.
967;The late Conrad L. Hall, won the Oscar in Cinematography for this picture and he roundly deserved it.
968;It is a amazing looking movie (check out the beautiful, yet violent scene, where Hanks finally confronts Newman in the rain).
969;also well done are the costumes, set design and art direction.
970;they totally complete this artful film.
971;This film is definitely Oscar calibur material in my eyes.
972;If you are a fan of good drama then I would highly recommend this well made film.
973;This is a wonderful movie.
974;All of the characters are well developed.
975;Very much like a comic book, it tells its story mainly through visual images, rather than by character development or dialog.
976;Comic book dark characters, or heroes for that matter, rarely have much depth, so the development of the plot is mainly accomplished by creating mood and scenario.
977;The success of those in this film is mostly a product of cinematographer Conrad Hall's talent.
978;Hall was a distinguished veteran whose roots track all the way back to the 1960s Sci.
979;Many of its best episodes were shot by Hall.
980;This story is told almost exclusively via visual image, like the best of the 1920s silent films.
981;It will be interesting to see if and how this new genre might be developed in the years to come.
982;I saw Road in theaters during it's original run and loved it.
983;Road to Perdition uses cunning cinematography that enhances the moments of crucial significance in the story.
984;The film offers a dark heartfelt cinematic experience that offers both contemplative work and fascinating entertainment, which fan the sense of suspense and action.
985;the actors are as good as always.
986;the story is just beautiful.
987;one of his children is rather curious and his curiosity costs his entirefamily's life .
988;Paul Newman's no Godfather, just a guy who makes his living as a criminal, and a respectable nicely polished well.
989;"The movie changes from an exploration of the 1930s Irish mob scene to a ""Road"" movie with father and son running for their lives."
990;This movie is a good crime thriller, some great actors and a plot that keeps you well into the movie itself.
991;All in all, a good flick.
992;as is usual for Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, they both deliver exceptional performances, despite a weak story.
993;Jude Law delivers a very good performance in this film, which is par for the course for him.
994;Tyler Hoechlin's performance is quite admirable for a young actor.
995;highly acclaimed American Beauty director, Sam Mendes led the reigns on this film and sets a beautiful tone for the film, which is thematically rich with the exception of the story itself which I found lacking.
996;The Cinematography was superb, they did a magneficent job recreating depression era Chicago.
997;This is a great movie, even though it is no Godfather it is still a great accomplishment and well worth your viewing
998;"Both are deservedly up for Oscars for this 2002 film because ""Road to Perdition"" is ultimately pictures and music."
999;"Hall died last month and won his second Oscar for his previous film, ""American Beauty,"" and it will be interesting to see how those two factors affect the voters, but this is a gorgeous film."
1000;Instead of feudal Japan the story is set in the Great Depression in and around Chicago.
1001;"The final pivotal scene of ""The Road to Perdition"" represents the film perfectly: I knew what was going to happen but it was photographed beautifully."
1002;Talk about going out at the top of your game: a beautiful legacy.
1003;although set in the 1930s the style is modern and the sequences paced to entertain.
1004;It opened today (and I went to NYC and saw it with friends)The photography is stunning.
1005;The acting is amazing .
1006;The story is wonderful and complex.
1007;"I agree with the NY Times reviewer who said ""Road to Perdition is a visual poem."""
1008;It's a really good maybe Academy Award.
1009;Totally believable from his slight brogue to his hawk.
1010;He speaks when spoken to.
1011;Every image, every still, is memorable.
1012;The misty snowy sets, almost in black and white with 1930's cars and streets is Edward Hopperish in mood and tonality.
1013;another friend noticed the camera work.
1014;But every note enhances the mood!
1015;I also felt the music rise with my adrenalin .
1016;the music pushes the viewer's mood into the plot, into the scene.
1017;everything about this fabulous gangster movie is the best I've seen in years.
1018;"All I knew before I went to see it was that 1) it featured Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors
I:9607;1019;But now that I have actually seen it, now that I have had the great fortune to sit through two hours of such an engrossing movie, all I can find to say is this: what an incredibly well.
I:9607;1020;Seconds after Sullivan and his partner.
I:9607;1021;crime do their dirty work, it is discovered that Sullivan's son, also named Michael, saw the whole thing.
I:9607;1022;Rooney and his son are doubtful that young Michael will be able to keep this dark secret under wraps, so Rooney orders Sullivan's family to be murdered.
I:9607;1023;This sets the rest of the movie in motion .
I:9607;1024;tom Hanks, again, serves up another great performance.
I:9607;1025;Paul Newman is electric .
I:9607;1026;the screen crackles with energy every time he is on screen.
I:9607;1027;sam Mendes, who also directed the standout movie """"American Beauty,"""" does another fine job behind the camera here."""
1028;The cinematographer is also wonderful .
1029;from the gray and black hues that wash over the screen, to the way the rain cascades down windows and reflects onto characters' faces and walls, to the way candles light up a room, this movie is simply gorgeous to look at.
1030;"He is developing quite a reputation for himself, with such great scores for ""American Beauty"" and ""The Green Mile."""
1031;The score he produced for this film is terrific, and it has all the trademark Newman aspects in it.
1032;I liked this movie a lot more than I thought I would .
1033;there were scary elements, there was humor, there was a heartwarming portrayal of father.
1034;"do yourself a favor and check out ""Road to Perdition."""
1035;It is definitely worth your time.
1036;"Road to Perdition proved that the success director Sam Mendes enjoyed with his first feature, ""American Beauty"", wasn't a fluke."
1037;Cinematographer Conrad Hall won an Academy Award for his work on this film, and once seen, one can hardly argue he didn't earn it.
1038;Since there are a multitude of reviews detailing the virtues of the film itself, for the purposes of brevity I'll focus on the technical aspects of the Blu.
1039;paramount has provided an absolutely perfect transfer of this film for its debut on Blu.
1040;The transfer is extremely sharp on detail and aids in the overall beauty of the film, whilst still remaining entirely faithful to the original intentions of the director and cinematographer.
1041;The jewel of the two new special features included with the Blu, this is an outstanding piece covering the illustrious career of Hall, which not only contains interesting bits about his work but also sheds a little light on the man behind the camera.
1042;There are plenty of expressive photographs and film clips, as well as copious interviews with other crew members that worked with Hall as well as his own son (who is also a cinematographer).
1043;This is a sort of informative, interactive photo gallery that contains text covering historical curiosities of the era and information about the production of the film.
1044;There was great effort placed into this and as a result it's one of the better photo galleries I've seen on Blu .
1045;"length Film Commentary with Sam Mendes""Road to Perdition"" is a modern masterpiece with an incredibly talented cast, a profoundly moving story, and hauntingly beautiful cinematography."
1046;ray release for one of the true cinematic gems from the last decade, giving it a gorgeous five.
1047;"Quite simply, I offer my highest recommendation for ""Road to Perdition"" on Blu."
1048;Serious, intense, moody gangster drama set in the 1930s, with Hanks as quiet hit man Mike Sullivan who must go on the lam with his one surviving son, after his wife and other son are murdered (an unfortuanate scene, but it sets the story in motion).
1049;A few twists make it slightly more intelligent than most genre films of this type, and the period, acting, and characters are vivid and believable.
1050;Leigh has a thankless role, but Law is chilling as a murderous photographer.
1051;The script adaptation by David Self (while it alters Max Allan Collins original script for the excellent graphic novel upon which this film is based) is fine.
1052;Mendes handles the gangster film with taste and style, and in the midst of all the bloodshed there is actual humanity.
1053;"studded cast in this film, directed by Sam Mendes of ""American Beauty"" fame."
1054;And there's some excellent cinematography.
1055;It's about gangsters in the 1930s, with emphasis on father.
1056;I was prepared to enjoy it.
1057;All the acting is wonderful.
1058;On every level, Road To Perdition is a complete work of cinema art.
1059;The care and attention to detail through an artists brush.
1060;The performances out rank on the Godfather level.
1061;A winner all the way.
1062;This was a fantastic movie.
1063;"This has ""Oscar"" written all over it for Tom Hanks and Paul Newman."
1064;This is by far Tom Hanks best performance to date.
1065;Let me start off by saying that this is one of the best gangster movies that i have seen in my lifetime.
1066;It has a amazing cast with performances from Tom Hanks who plays Mike Sullivan, the father and mian character of the story, Paul Newman as John Rooney, Jude Law, and a single performance by Tyler Hoechlin.
1067;What makes this film stand out is the cinematography by Conrad L. Hall who won an Oscar for his work.
1068;The world of the 1930's mob citys and country sides takes your breath away as you get immersed in this world of violence, betrayal, and a bond between father and son.
1069;What follows is betrayal, death, and a great ending to an excellent peice of work.
1070;It's an excellent movie, stellar cast, and dark story will keep you watching til the end.
1071;I own this great movie and you should as well, if you don't already!
1072;The story line reminded me of the movies of yesteryear.
1073;Just a strong story with strong actors.
1074;Paul and Tom carry their understated personalities well.
1075;basically a revenge, and 'good wins out over evil' movie.
1076;It's well acted, though sad to see Paul Newman so along in years.
1077;mendes earned, with his reputation, the right to work with some of the best in the business.
1078;Hanks always rises to perform as a master when surrounded by a talented ensemble, and particularly with an actor/actress of Newman's caliber.
1079;His scene at the piano with Newman, and his victory in the rain against Newman's men are both masterful displays of acting prowess.
1080;He's not alone in these scenes, and Newman is memorable here .
1081;easily slipping from engaging man among men to fearsome patriarch to a father torn by anguish over competing responsibilities to family .
1082;"should he value his own flesh and blood more than the ""son"" who is his by demeanor, ability and character?Young Hoechlin, as Mike, Jr., is either one of the finest young actors we have seen, or, more likely, a truly successful student of Mendes/Hanks ."
1083;"strong performances make memorable characters, but the plotline of ""Perdition"" is thin."
1084;The sound and the lighting capture the suspense .
1085;both are almost visceral in the violent sequences, and the cinematography of Conrad Hall is evident in the transition of camera shots .
1086;the film manages to feel like a series of artistic masterpieces wound together as a film.
1087;The Godfather unfolds over two decades.
1088;for adult moviegoers this summer, it is a quietly powerful film choice, beautifully made.
1089;I thought this movie was surprisingly good given that it's based on a graphic novel, so I didn't expect it to have the depth and subtlety of something based on a novel.
1090;But it's a fine movie nevertheless.
1091;And a movie starring both Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, as well as Jude Law, is certainly one to make one sit up and take notice from the standpoint of the cast.
1092;Sullivan's life up till then has been a priviledged one, especially for the Depression era.
1093;his family lives in the biggest house on the block, and he is relatively prosperous.
1094;"He is said to be respected by his cronies and a couple of times people in the movie compliment him on his doing ""good work."""
1095;At that point the danger lurking beneath the otherwise highly polished surface of his comfortable life becomes evident.
1096;Also there are comments on the making of the movie that I found interesting.
1097;They finally found a manufacturer who was able to do a special order for them so it was basically custom made for the movie.
1098;I was born in Chicago so I had a little interest in that.
1099;Overall a fine movie that does justice to the original graphic book.
1100;I really love crime/gangster films and didn't know what to expect with this one.
1101;It's a crime film that concentrated on father/son relationships both with the main actors and Newman/Craig (in a fantastic performance).
1102;You can tell a few minutes into Road to Perdition that this is a Big Film, or at least that is the hope.
1103;son thing, which is fine.
1104;It is very good movie.
1105;Thanks again and have a nice weekend 2!
1106;This is great movie where Tom Hanks delivers a solid performance along with Paul Neman.
1107;is Mike Sullivan a good man, and upon reflection, what is the nature of goodness?
1108;Everything about this movie works.
1109;The score is pretty amazing, too.
1110;as a big tom hanks fan , this was favorite move in the 2000 's a story about father an son's highly recommended
1111;I was surprised how good this film was.
1112;Tom Hanks is a marvelous actor, and he was very convincing and touching in this role.
1113;The style of the movie was visually a treat.
1114;acted story out of the thirties filmed as if it were a great painting.
1115;One of the all time great films.
1116;filled story of hitman Michael Sullivan, directed by Sam Mendes, has as much style and cinematic brilliance as his American Beauty, though it is much darker.
1117;conrad L. Hall, to whom the film is dedicated, uses photography to its fullest advantage winning a posthumous Academy Award for his cinematography.
1118;Shot in winter, the film preserves the flavor of early black and white films, with sharp contrasts, and the use of dark, somber colors, when colors are used at all.
1119;He keeps the scenes simple, often focusing on individual characters in contexts which reveal their emotional states.
1120;newman is terrific as an aging mob boss, playing his part with just the right mix of frailty and cruelty (for which he was nominated for an Academy Award).
1121;old Mike, Jr., reveals his fears and vulnerabilities at the same time that he shows his satisfaction as the center of his father's attention (winning Best Young Actor from the Broadcast Film Critics Association).
1122;Jude Law, made up to look like a true, wild.
1123;period music adds style to the film, and original music by Thomas Newman (and the title song by John Williams), mostly piano and strings, preserves the period tone.
1124;This movie displays a stunning preformance from Tom Hanks that ranks among Saving Private Ryan and Forest Gump.
1125;jude Law and Paul Newman also bring their hall of fame skill to the table.
1126;This movie is entirely deserving of it's Academy awards and deserved at least two more.
1127;the Road to Perdition is a masterpeice and is vital peice to any true movie lover's collection.
1128;"Paul Newman does a decent job at his role of the mob boss who ""regretfully"" makes a few decessions."
1129;I liked the characters for what they were.
1130;"Road to Perdition is brilliantly conceived by director Sam Mendes [""American Beauty""] and stunningly photographed by the late Conrad Hall, whose illustrious career garnered him two Oscars and ten nominations."
1131;One of those nominations is for this film.
1132;Tom Hanks, Paul Newman and Jude Law, among others, give great performances.
1133;Prohibition has spawned a nation of thugs and gangsters.
1134;headed heir, and his adopted son, Michael Sullivan [Tom Hanks], is his enforcer.
1135;A great rivalry exists between the two sons.
1136;What he witnesses forever changes his life, puts the rest of his family in mortal danger, and gives John the perfect opportunity to rid himself of his rival.
1137;the movie is beautifully rendered in dark tones, giving it the look of a nightmarish dream.
1138;This is appropriate because the story is told from the boy's point of view and is a memory from his childhood.
1139;It, like the graphic novel it is based on, is a fantasy.
1140;From a commercial point of view, it might have benefited from a bit more levity, but I admire Mendes, a true artist, for keeping his vision consistent and true.
1141;Conrad Hall's cinematography, from the meticulous lighting to the unforgettable compositions, is outstanding.
1142;The kind you want to see in Blu.
1143;the best thing about this movie is the acting.
1144;Tom Hanks plays his part well, and we come to like him as a solemn, not so much stoic, but humble man.
1145;His son is the farmer type, as seen in the movie.
1146;The movie rolls straight up a hill, and stays that way.
1147;I loved the ending as much as the middle of the movie.
1148;This is one of the best movies of 2002.
1149;Things are somber yet smooth until Sullivan's son witnesses a hit.
1150;The status quo is destroyed.
1151;No one is really comfortable with Sullivan's son being alive to tell the tale, yet Sullivan is like a son to his boss, John Rooney.
1152;this is really a beautifully done movie in about every respect.
1153;The first striking thing is Tom Hanks cast as an Irish hit man.
1154;There is something about Tom Hanks that is mesmerizing on the screen, something extremely watchable.
1155;It is a great piece of casting, setting Hanks against type as a man of violence, and it works in spades.
1156;Newman brought just the right blend of authority, power, and Irish melancholy to the role.
1157;The relationship between Sullivan and Rooney seems so believable, so understated and sincere, it is one of the most moving things about the movie.
1158;this film is about fathers and sons, and there are three father/son relationships at stake here: Sullivan and his son, Rooney and his son (played with crazed zeal by Daniel Craig), and finally the relationship between the boss and his prime enforcer.
1159;the other striking thing for me was the interesting and unique way the film dealt with violence.
1160;sacs were at a minimum in this movie, and the scenes were so much more powerful for it.
1161;"I believe this scene just as innovative as any of Sam Peckinpaw's ""ballet of death"" scenes from the late 60's and 70's."
1162;A great film with a gripping, well.
1163;Clean and perfect all the way.
1164;Tom Hanks is awesome as usual.
1165;He play completely out of character in this movie and it's great.
1166;This is one of the most amazing films ever made.
1167;tells a classic story about Michael Sullivan, a father who works as a hit.
1168;town mob and whose son is put in grave danger when he witnesses his father on the job.
1169;the acting is brilliant with Tom Hanks as Michael Sullivan, Jude Law as Maguire.
1170;Tyler Hoechlin, who plays Michael Sullivan, Jr. has a terrific acting ability and I hope he gets to share his talents more in the future.
1171;The cinematography is excellent, giving the movie an overall feeling of suspense and action.
1172;this is an excellent movie that, even if you're not a fan of Godfather.
1173;related films, many people will still love this epic film, which, without a doubt, will one day be considered a classic.
1174;"Sam Mendes' ""The Road to Perdition"" is a film about family: extended, brother against brother, father and sons and ultimately father against sons."
1175;Mendes tackles big ideas here: the sanctity of the family, a father's love of family, a father's right to protect his family and a natural versus an adopted son's place in a family (the right of succession).
1176;But Mendes uses the small details of life to develop these themes so that his lofty ideas have a pervasive as well as persuasive effect on the viewer.
1177;michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a family man (2 sons, Michael Jr. and Peter) who works for John Rooney (Paul Newman) as a bodyguard and hit man.
1178;John has a son, Connor (David Craig)who is intensely jealous of his father's relationship with Michael.
1179;this proves to be the turning point in the film and the event that sets the remainder of the film in motion: can Michael Jr. be trusted to keep his mouth shut?
1180;one of the most impressive set pieces of the film is a showdown between Michael and John Rooney and his henchman on a public street at night in the pouring rain, shot with absolutely no sound nor blood in sight.
1181;"Conrad Hall has shot the film in a dark, grayish, almost colorless palette very similar toThe Yards,"" also coincidentally a film about a family involved in crime."
1182;The music is also extremely effective and evocative especially since Mendes has shot large portions of the film without dialogue.
1183;the acting is top drawer with Tyler Hoechlin as Michael Jr. almost stealing the picture away from the always effective Tom Hanks, Jude Law and Paul Newman.
1184;sam Mendes has fashioned a film of the utmost purity and beauty: a tone poem to the family and to the father.
1185;Dark, moody and tragic, ROAD TO PERDITION is a masterfully made and engrossing film.
1186;It's ultimately chilling and fascinating in its execution.
1187;tyler Hoechlin shines as Michael's young son who witnesses his father at work in the execution of a member of Newman's brood.
1188;Stanley Tucci is superb as Frank Nitti, Al Capone's henchman.
1189;tom Hanks is excellent, too, as a father who hasn't taken the time to know his son, and whose life of killing catches up with him.
1190;Watching him grow in his love for his son makes for some emotionally devastating scenes, and the ending is powerful.
1191;class film making, beautifully filmed and scored.
1192;I found it to be very moving.
1193;tom Hanks is a loving father with a beautiful wife and two children.
1194;Peter, the youngest, and Michael, the oldest.
1195;He is also a hit man for mob boss, John Rooney.
1196;What they didn't realize was that the son, Michael, had hid inside the car and was able to see everything.
1197;And that he never has to lead the life that he has.
1198;this was such a fantastic movie.
1199;The direction and acting was outstanding.
1200;The cinematography was also very impressive, indeed.
1201;I also enjoyed the score to the movie very much.
1202;"tom Hanks breaks away from his tradtional ""nice guy"" roll and is able to show us his darker side."
1203;hard Hanks fans, but a true actor should be able to break away from traditional roles.
1204;He does a great job in bringing depth and heart to his character, as well as bringing a sort of darkness and burden.
1205;Still, it is such a sight to see.
1206;It is a magnificent picture, overall.
1207;i am glad I finally got to see this.
1208;I really did enjoy it, and look forward to seeing it again soon.
1209;"Just know this, ""Road to Perdition"" is one of the best films of 2002."
1210;This is a unique role for Hanks, and a unique plot as well.
1211;A lot of great actors, twists and turns, definately worth a view.
1212;My feeling is that this was an excellent story .
1213;Hanks is good enjoyed the movie.
1214;film adaptation process, so I know quite well there have to be differences.
1215;Having recently read the graphic novel on which this excellent flick is based, I have to say it succeeds very well in its own right .
1216;driven character of Michael Sullivan very nicely.
1217;Tyler Hoechlin carries off the son pretty well, too .
1218;That was a very strong, very pointed element of the boy's development in the book.
1219;And the photographer, played beautifully by Jude Law, was an excellent addition.
1220;Some good scenes, like the driving lesson, and Sullivan's words to the first bank manager, were indeed taken almost without change from the original story.
1221;This movie is great on all levels: acting, directing, cinematography, script.
1222;And talk about craftsmanship: in one of the special features, they describe how the costumes were specially woven to capture the heavier cloth of the period, because modern cloth would not hang on the bodies of the actors in the right way.
1223;What I saw was good.
1224;Road to Perdition, based on the 1998 graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, is the first film for director Sam Mendes since his Academy Award winning film, American Beauty.
1225;The film is also a first for one of its stars, Tom Hanks.
1226;The film also features some other big stars outside of Tom Hanks.
1227;Set in early 1930's in the city of Chicago, Sullivan works for Mr. John Rooney.
1228;Now all grown up and having a family of his own, Sullivan's life changes in many dramatic ways.
1229;His oldest son, curious of what his father does for a living, sneaks into the back of his car the night of one of his jobs.
1230;This sends Michael Sullivan on an unpredictable journey to the town of Perdition as he tries to save the life of his son and seek revenge on the people he once called family.
1231;Road to Perdition's story is very well done though long.
1232;the acting is top notch in Road to Perdition with the all.
1233;star cast advertised very prominently.
1234;One can make an argument for either side but it can be said there is a middle ground for his character.
1235;Paul Newman gives one of his best performances as the head of a mobster family.
1236;His lines are probably the most memorable in the entire film not because of where they are featured but for the emotion he uses to say those lines.
1237;"Jude Law is well placed as the ""Reporter"", though I believe his character wasn't as necessary as most of the other characters in the film."
1238;Other supporting characters were well done but not hugely outstanding in the film.
1239;road to Perdition is a good film but not a great film.
1240;The dialogue was good and the story was interesting but there are some conflicts with what happens in the film.
1241;Also, some of the characters, including the boy who plays the son of Michael Sullivan, seem pretty dull and don't really do anything to show a hugely exceptional performance.
1242;Outside of those small scrabbles, the film is very well presented especially with the beautiful sets and the great use of cinematography.
1243;When I had first heard of this film, I knew that I just had to see it.
1244;I did go, and I was incredibly moved by the experience.
1245;"One night, Mr. Rooney's son, Connor (Daniel Craig), is told to go and ""talk"" to one of Mr. Rooney's friends who began to mouth off at his brother's wake."
1246;He is informed that Michael Sullivan (Hanks) is to go with him.
1247;the movie is definitely worth the price of admission, although I'm not so sure that it should be compared side by side to classics such as the Godfather series.
1248;It did earn the five stars that I'm giving it, and it's a powerful drama that is worth every penny to go see.
1249;It's Tom Hanks most internalized acting performance.
1250;It's Paul Newman making a rare, and much needed, return to the big screen.
1251;like in his previous film, Sam Mendes gives away the fate of his main character within the first couple lines of dialogue.
1252;"Although, to be fair, the final outcome appears more in doubt here than in that last effort, even with all the gangster talk about ""the life we chose"" and ""none of us will see heaven."
1253;Visually, Mendes knows how to frame a scene.
1254;This is the moment that sets the film down its road.
1255;Watch how this scene, with its over.
1256;Scored only by the powerful rhythm of the ocean, which sounds like the breathing of a giant, and bathed in white light, whereas the earlier scene was set on a rainy night, the emotional resonance of this scene is heartbreaking.
1257;It's a skillful cinematic moment, made more impressive when one realizes it was filmed by a man making only his second movie.
1258;Sure, he shows prodigious talent at his job.
1259;And he gets to stomp around armed with a cool noir get.
1260;His eyes do much of the work here, replacing the charm that he usually uses to get through big parts.
1261;jude Law has a fairly enigmatic part.
1262;Best known for works where he is the definitive male object of desire, here Law sports a thinning hairline, unkempt fingernails, and rotting brown teeth.
1263;dimensional, Law manages to bring him to life.
1264;A cast full of fine actors supports them.
1265;Stanley Tucci is reserved and business like as Capone right.
1266;Jennifer Jason Leigh, an actress of stunning power, has absolutely nothing to do here.
1267;And young Tyler Hoechlin doesn't do anything outstanding as Young Mike, but that's probably for the best.
1268;Hoechlin plays it close to the chest and it works.
1269;"on, and unrealistic in a film rife with harsh reality, ""Road to Perdition"" is a fine technical piece of work."
1270;While something intangible keeps it from becoming a great film, one that you can clutch to your bosom as an example of the human condition writ large, it still manages to be very, very good.
1271;In his selection of good men's roles, Tom Hanks has being able to personify men with integrity, decency and impeccable moral.
1272;It's incredible that he still can continue transmitting those qualities while assuming the role of an assassin in Road to Perdition.
1273;This man, whose power is compared with God's, has served like a paternal figure for the Sullivan family.
1274;each element of Road to Perdition reflects a unified vision and meticulous attention in the details, from the wardrobe, props, to the magnificent cinematography and artistic direction which try to relive the Depression era in the United States.
1275;His humanity, demonstrated in the relation with his son, smoothes the character to such points that sometimes we forget he is a ruthless assassin.
1276;newman&Hanks do really well even though this film is figured out by the first hour.
1277;This film is very strong.
1278;"ites.Your basic Martin Scorsese fan will love movies like ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"", ""Mean Streets."""
1279;"They will watch and enjoy films like ""Donnie Brasco,"" ""Heat,"" and ""Training Day."""
1280;"ites will watch the Sopranos religiously and enjoy TV series such as ""The Shield"" and ""Kingpin."""
1281;"a Francis Ford Coppola fan will, on the other hand, be a fan of films like ""The Godfather"" and it's sequels."
1282;"These films are `tone poems,' and ""Road to Perdition"" belongs in this category."
1283;Road to Perdition is an art film, no doubt about it.
1284;The storytelling is surrealistic and quite removed from reality, as told through a child's eyes.
1285;It's really quite cerebral, and will give gritty, hard.
1286;"Based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, ""Road to Perdition"" is a unique movie in many regards."
1287;On the surface it is a gangster film, but the heart of the story has much more to do with the exploration of father/son relationships.
1288;On the other hand, Sullivan is a family man, with a beloved wife and two young sons.
1289;Along the way, as father and son must work together to survive, we see the initially strained relationship between Sullivan and Michael develop into something deeper and more real.
1290;The plot is cohesive, thought.
1291;provoking, and holds one's attention throughout.
1292;The climax of the story is powerful, and gives the film a sense of resolution, but the brief denoument somehow didn't quite seem to fit.
1293;Nevertheless, I do think this is one of the better films of 2002.
1294;every single actor turned in an excellent performance, making this film surprisingly powerful and compelling.
1295;Yet at the same time he manages to convey a compassionate, human side to the man, which we see manifested in the love he feels for his son.
1296;Paul Newman also does an outstanding job, as is to be expected.
1297;Jude Law's character will positively make your skin crawl.
1298;And newly discovered child actor Tyler Hoechlin is impressive as young Michael, giving a very genuine performance, rare for most actors his age.
1299;Road to Perdition is also a great artistic success.
1300;The use of light and darkness gives a great effect.
1301;The soundtrack (by Thomas Newman) adds the final finishing touch.
1302;All originally composed for this film, the music is truly beautiful.
1303;driven, it conveys an additional depth of emotion that makes the movie feel complete.
1304;It seems like every film he comes out with is a hit.
1305;This triangle of actors just works.
1306;The costumes and scenery are also great elements that added to this film's greatness.
1307;It really makes the audience believe that they were really in the 1920's.
1308;Every element that contributes to the success of a film was exceptional.
1309;Road to Perdition is an epic movie with the best of them, and one that gets you doing a bit of thinking as well.
1310;Enjoyable on a range of levels, the movie is one of the most memorable I have seen.
1311;Brilliantly shot and acted, this is one of the greats, in my opinion.
1312;michael Sullivan (Hanks) is an enforcer for an Irish mafia boss, (Newman), with a simple ethic in life.
1313;He also has an abiding fear that his sons will grow up just like him and follow him into the business.
1314;as mentioned, the cinematography is excellent, with some amazing scenes that are truly artistic.
1315;The filming was excellent, and matched by the great acting from Newman, Hanks, Law and many others.
1316;Portraying hard men in a hard lifestyle is something they all did very well.
1317;overall, this film is without doubt a very memorable one and one that is worth sitting through a number of times.
1318;Something new will be gleaned from each viewing, adding to one's appreciation.
1319;I loved it and still watch it when I have the chance.
1320;I really enjoyed the film the first time I saw it in the theater and again on Blu ray.
1321;the film however is a true classic with Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, Daniel Craig and Jude Law.
1322;I definitely will share this film with my son when he is old enough!
1323;One of the many Tom Hanks films that is just excellent!
1324;A truely great engrossing film!
1325;Having watched part of this film in UK, I wanted to get it and watch it with my friend ( who is a big Tom Hanks fan )while staying with her in U. s. a. I easily found the film on Amazon and the delivery was prompt.

1340;He finds that his mob family has taken the life of his wife, and their youngest son.
1341;Sullivan now realizes that he's in a race to not only avenge his family, but save his only son Michael Jr. from the life that he's lead.
1342;"It is a natural law
I:9607;1343;Expressively we see as Sullivan's character undergoes a major change.
I:9607;1344;Sullivan and Michael Jr. bond as he teaches him to be observant, how to drive, and how to rob banks.
I:9607;1345;Michael Jr. now knows the love, and fear that his father has in his heart.
I:9607;1346;With all of that said, ROAD TO PERDITION is a beautiful movie about the love that is between each father and son.
I:9607;1347;Hanks gives one of his better (but not his best) performances as he tries to against his typical good guy roles (a la an Oscar winning Denzel Washington), but in the end he comes out being a likeable character nonetheless.
I:9607;1348;Paul Newman (in an Oscar nominated performance) chews up as much screen time as he can, but his best moments are when he and Hanks share the screen together.
I:9607;1349;The standout performance however, goes to Jude Law as a picture taking hitman sent after Hanks and son, and while his screen time is limited, Law is simply chilling and gives us the film's most memorable role.
I:9607;1350;the acting is solid, with Hanks doing a better performance than in Cast Away and Green Mile and Newman coming back of the acting grave and put the almost unrecognizable Jude Law that make a great performance, the kid was good and the others of the cast were great.

I:9607;1353;Sam Mendas, along with the cinematographer of the century Conrad Hall creates one of the most beautiful cinematic experiences ever on celluloid!
I:9607;1354;I CRIED AT THE END!
I:9607;1355;and that's a good thing.
I:9607;1356;All of it is in tune with the times.
I:9607;1357;The music, the way people act, their apparel, the guns, the business.
I:9607;1358;A family is murdered, and now the surviving father and oldest.
I:9607;1359;But there is an interesting take here.
I:9607;1360;the husband and father of the murdered (Tom Hanks) is that mob boss's (Paul Newman) best friend/right.
I:9607;1361;tom Hanks' quest for revenge is visceral, sometimes funny, and mostly memorable.
I:9607;1362;The struggle here is fantastic and literally carries on to the very end.
I:9607;1363;In between are the stories of the chaos Hanks' is causing in the ranks of the big.

I:9607;1366;One review saw it as a modern epic.
I:9607;1367;In a time when movies appeal to the masses and have to give people a happy ending, Road to Perdition fits in well.
I:9607;1368;I am upset that I paid to see this movie and added to it's success.
I:9607;1369;Jude Law is also a great actor.
I:9607;1370;It is a great movie though.
I:9607;1371;I just have to say the scenery was spectacular, for me personally.

I:9607;1383;Sam Mendes' latest effort, The Road to Perdition is nothing short of fantastic.
I:9607;1384;He works for Mr. Rooney who is like a father figure to him.
I:9607;1385;He decided that he has to kill Michael, in effect choosing his own son over Michael.
I:9607;1386;the details in the movie are astounding.
I:9607;1387;Much like the rose petals in American Beauty, rain is a constant theme in """"Perdition."""
1388;Upon seeing this movie, we are faced with one very interesting question, Michael Sullivan was a gangster.
1389;See the movie and see who is going to be going home with an armful of Oscar's in a few months.
1390;Gangster movies are one of the most popular genres for the movie going public (see the Godfather movies and Goodfellas for classic examples).
1391;Throw in the nostalgia of 1930's America and cast stellar actors like Paul Newman, Tom Hanks, Jude Law and one can't help but feel that this movie should be something special.
1392;It is quite well done.
1393;Arrived on time as ordered watched it the day I got it.
1394;"tom Hanks is a good enough actor to rise above his real and personified usual casting as a good boy
I:9607;1395;He plays the aging but still powerful Capo di Tutti Capi, faced with terrifyingly divided loyalties between the weak and useless son who is his by blood, and Hanks, the strong and loyal 'son' who is his by love, affection, and admiration.
I:9607;1396;spectacular, and there's a great cameo bit by Jude Law playing the creepy weird sort of groupie photographer of crime scenes.
I:9607;1397;In a stunning meld of cold.
I:9607;1398;hearted mafia revenge and the emotional development of bonds between a father and his son, Road To Perdition manages to be both startlingly picturesque, and emotionally captivating at the same time.
I:9607;1399;Virtually every single actor/actress in this movie (regardless of the size of their role) is completely believable and emotional.
I:9607;1400;The viewer often understands them the most when they aren't saying a thing.
I:9607;1401;the characters are complimented by a host of suitable settings, many of which manage to be both grungy and beautiful at the same time.
I:9607;1402;Use of the weather and uniquely selected camera angles helps bring things to life.
I:9607;1403;The realism of the times is very accurate.
I:9607;1404;While many scenes were wisely left without background music, the music that is there is wonderful.
I:9607;1405;It is one of the greatest pull factors which keeps drawing me to this movie because I can't get it out of my head.
I:9607;1406;As a fan of mobster movies like The Godfather and Goodfellas I was extremely happy with this movie which managed to add a uniquely powerful shade of emotion into the mix along with the usual betrayal and murder.
I:9607;1407;This is the heartwarming story of a father and son growing closer together in the face of adversity.
I:9607;1408;Mike Sullivan is a successful hit.
I:9607;1409;Mike's 12 year old son, believing his father to be a secret agent for the government, hid in his father's car to watch him on a secret mission.
I:9607;1410;Mike's wife and youngest son are murdered but Mike and oldest son survive.
I:9607;1411;Thus begins their journey of reconciliation and revenge.
I:9607;1412;Incensed, the mob engage the best hit.
I:9607;1413;This fellow is a psychopath that likes to photograph his victims as they gasp their last breath.
I:9607;1414;truly, the feel good movie of the year.
I:9607;1415;We enjoy this movie greatly.
I:9607;1416;It is one of the few movies we can see more than once and still get more out of it.
I:9607;1417;But he also sees the """"bigger picture"""" of gang warfare during the prohibition."""
1418;And to be honest, he sees the horrors of guns in this.

1421;Let's face it, for all the art.
1422;one of the best performances by one of the greatest actors of our time, Tom Hanks.
1423;Each of these men is so charming, if left alone, it takes some effort to make them look as bad as they did here.
1424;Newman gets away with more because he is still so handsome and he doesn't have as many scenes as Hanks.
1425;He does a wonderfully elegant fall though.
1426;Some movies are just so beautifully filmed that one can watch the movie over and over despite a lack of plot or good story.
1427;Road to Perdition is the rare example of a movie that has a compelling story with excellent cinematography.
1428;Road to Perdition came out during the middle of the summer when the average movie consisted of action movies having large budgets and even larger explosions.
1429;Road did fairly well at the box office with Tom Hanks/Paul Newman's star power but many people who came to see this intelligent movie were probably tired of brainless action movies.
1430;"Field of Dreams had this motif as a baseball movie, while ""Star Wars"" couched the motif in the middle of intergalactic warfare."
1431;Much praise should be given to Thomas Newman's beautiful score in the film as well.
1432;"Overall, ""Road to Perdition"" is probably Mendes most underrated work, while `American Beauty' stands out as his most `overrated.'"
1433;This is a wonderful film, with excellent performances, beautiful cinematography and direction, and superb writing.
1434;It explores their relationship, the sins of the father and his dreams of the son.
1435;realistic images of the illustrated novel it comes from.
1436;He's likely to win an Oscar for his work here.
1437;"Watching it with her, I think it's perhaps his best movie since ""Forrest Gump""."
1438;The relationship between Tyler Hoechin and he is phenomenal!
1439;The overall tone of a hitman trying to do good with his son after the rest of the family is murdered may seem cliche, but this one is heartwarming.
1440;Part of me was even hoping they would make it in the end.
1441;all in all, wonderful movie if you like dramas.
1442;Although you may already guess the ending, the actors keep you paying attention.
1443;There are many resemblances to emotions in Saving Private Ryan , The Green Mile and Big , so it is not at all surprising that Tom Hanks fits the lead role perfectly.
1444;blooded deeds, but that is good to feel compassion.
1445;well, you will have to see it yourself.
1446;It can seem a bit long/boring at short times, but overall it's powerful and well made.
1447;Definitely one of Tom Hanks' better roles.
1448;I sat and watched this with people who thought it was the best thing since sliced bread.
1449;The gangster angle, entertaining as it is, is simply backdrop for the actual theme: the love that exists between fathers and sons.
1450;that's why the gangster scenes work so well.
1451;I think that's why his performance is so brilliant here.
1452;He plays Michael Sullivan as a family man, as much as a father and husband who provides for his family in the employ of local Irish mobster Mr. Rooney, the other father figure in this piece.
1453;Paul Newman is incredibly effective here, both as surrogate father to Michael and actual father to his own child.
1454;both Sullivan and Rooney obviously are willing to do whatever they can to protect their sons.
1455;The gangster angle merely gives these characters more interesting tools to tell the story with.
1456;once again, director Sam Mendes manages to find the heart of this tale, and capture it brilliantly.
1457;The pallate of color and directorial choices lend more to Leone's Once Upon A Time In America, visually, than Coppola or Scorcese.
1458;"even the bank robberies are well handled, not because Mendes does anything new here, but because they are a device to illustrate not just Sullivan's strength of Character (he tells bank managers that he only wants ""dirty money"") but to also chronicle the growing bond between Michael and his son."
1459;"Hoechlin actually has talent
I:9607;1460;The choice he makes at the end brings it all home without relying on melodrama at all.
I:9607;1461;there are no perfect characters in this movie.
I:9607;1462;Everyone in the film are absolutely well.
I:9607;1463;Mendes creates a phenomenal piece of work.
I:9607;1464;p. s. the scene where Michael tries to teach his son to drive is so authentic, I found myself remembering my dad trying to do the same thing.
I:9607;1465;Mike Sullivan (Hanks) is a faithful strong man for crime boss John Rooney (Newman).
I:9607;1466;Still, great cinematography, direction and wonderful performances by Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, and Jude Law make this a film you don't want to miss.
I:9607;1467;Given that this is a Tom Hanks movie, you know from the start that it will be an exceptional movie.
I:9607;1468;And it lived up to that expectation.
I:9607;1469;A very serious movie that you can laugh during some scenes with one of the best actors out there plus an excellent storyline equals a classic.
I:9607;1470;One of the biggest surprise endings of any movie and it's amazing to think that this is the same actor who played a slow southern boy from Alabama, a man in love with a mermaid, a BIG little boy, and a man stranded on a deserted island can once again completely change the view of the audience as he is a new kind of character in this movie.
I:9607;1471;Tom Hanks is an incredible actor and once again his skill is portrayed.
I:9607;1472;This is one of my favorites, since it was filmed partly in my state.
I:9607;1473;They viewed the dailies at a local theater.
I:9607;1474;Besides all that, this is a great film about gangsters and getting even.
I:9607;1475;Paul Newman and Hanks work great together on screen.
I:9607;1476;A perfect blend of old acting talent and new ones.
I:9607;1477;The Road to Perdition, is a highly stylized gangster movie that succeeds as a theatrical motion picture, but will probably leave fans of the quick cut to cynicism untouched.
I:9607;1478;Mr. Mendes is a fan of the long take, and he uses it to great effect.
I:9607;1479;The local crime lord's son spurs the events, and therein we have two fathers, two sons, and the extremes of fathers' protecting their issue.
I:9607;1480;For the Sullivan's, a redemptive road trip to the village of Perdition"
1481;"Along the way there is enough violence, blood, and gore to keep us all happy
I:9607;1482;Paul Newman, with relatively little screen time, is a wonder to behold, and his work is a fine addition to his later career.
I:9607;1483;The Road to Perdition feels good without being a feel.
I:9607;1484;good movie, and the reason it feels that way is because the road is steep, and the redemption is hard.
I:9607;1485;Perhaps it was because I liked Sam Mendes' first film, American Beauty, so much.
I:9607;1486;and it is actually a very good story.
I:9607;1487;After his younger son and wife are killed, he sets out with his eldest son to find a new life for them both.
I:9607;1488;His character early on seems almost to lead a double life: a relatively normal life with his family, and his business life as an enforcer for his mafia associates.
I:9607;1489;And yet he plays both sides well.
I:9607;1490;In his work, he is businesslike and professional.
I:9607;1491;In the end, he's simply good at what he does.
I:9607;1492;His struggles are real, and they are palpable.
I:9607;1493;I was impressed and pleased by his performance.
I:9607;1494;Where American Beauty was a story told with flourishes and idiosyncrasies, as befit the theme of the film, Road to Perdition adopts a much simpler, more straightforward tone.
I:9607;1495;There are moments of beauty and moments of brutality, to be sure, but only as much as fits the events of the story.
I:9607;1496;The scene in which Hanks guns down a number of his old associates is strikingly graceful, handled with a light but serious touch.
I:9607;1497;Without giving the end away, I can say that the final scenes were among the most perfect in the film, and leave the audience thinking about the conclusion long after the credits have rolled.
I:9607;1498;all this sounds like I really enjoyed the movie, and basically, I guess I did.
I:9607;1499;I certainly don't regret spending time and money to see it, and I definitely enjoyed it while I was there.
I:9607;1500;Technically, it's a strong story, skillfully put together.
I:9607;1501;The acting was good all around.
I:9607;1502;I think that in the end, it wanted to be a movie that moved the audience in some way, that made them feel.
I:9607;1503;It's funny, because I had the same problem with American Beauty, and the only difference there is that I don't think American Beauty was trying to make you feel .
I:9607;1504;In that sense, it was a success.
I:9607;1505;I admire many things about it, from a technical perspective and a storytelling perspective.
I:9607;1506;Rather than manipulating them with music or powerful visuals as other directors tend to do, he leaves the emotional side of the story to what the audience chooses to invest in it.
I:9607;1507;The audience makes the film, Peter Weir has said in the past, and perhaps this is Sam Mendes' theory as well.
I:9607;1508;Road to Perdition is a good film, and worth seeing.
I:9607;1509;Perhaps any other judgments on it are best reserved for the audience to decide for themselves.
I:9607;1510;This movie has many, many great things to recommend it.
I:9607;1511;The cinematography and art direction are first rate.
I:9607;1512;The casting is very good, I think.
I:9607;1513;He does his job because its what he owes to his boss, who was like a father to him, and its what keeps his family living a nice life.
I:9607;1514;He works hard to keep his family insulated from what he does for a living, and Hanks is right for the part.
I:9607;1515;In this film, he leads a double life.
I:9607;1516;And that is a bit jarring for us, the viewer.
I:9607;1517;paul Newman is terrific as the boss.
I:9607;1518;He's a """"gentle"""" soul with the true heart of a killer."""
1519;Newman is a master of underplaying.
1520;His eyes tell us almost all we need to know, and the rest is conveyed in his husky voice.
1521;We should all age as openly and gracefully as Paul Newman!Jude Law plays a hit man hired to track down and kill Hanks.
1522;He's a killer WITHOUT a gentle side.
1523;This is one of the questions I think the movie quietly explores.
1524;It tells its story with respect for storytelling, rather than a need to have shooting all the time.
1525;Yet there is plenty of action and there are many tense moments, particularly between Hanks and Law, who have some memorable confrontations, particularly when they are in a crowded diner together, and Hanks realises who Law is and what he has been sent to do.
1526;"He and his son have several ""wacky"" bank."
1527;holdup scenes, with Hanks being very amusing with the bemused bank tellers, and his young son being funny learning how to drive by being the getaway driver.
1528;The scenes are fun.you can imagine Speilberg directing them.
1529;it's one of the 10 best of the year, I think.
1530;graphic novel, which provides the actors more depth of character and complexity with which to work, even though the finished product is still an abridgement of the original.
1531;The Road to Perdition is sensitively directed by Sam Mendes, exquisitely photographed by Conrad Hall, finely acted by everyone in it, with particular cudos for Paul Newman, Jude Law, and Daniel Craig.
1532;Costumes and set designs are also superior in recreating Chicago and environs during the early 1930s.
1533;happy idiot he's stuck with (beautifully portrayed by Daniel Craig).
1534;"loved ""adopted"" son Hanks or the boy, since the boy, though a witness to murder, is hardly going to rat on his own father (or on Newman's own son, also involved, which again would lead back to Hanks)."
1535;a viewer must have to accept the premise that sets the film into motion, and this viewer cannot.
1536;If a viewer can climb over such hurdles as the two mentioned above, there is a great deal to recommend the remainder of the film in every category mentioned above, particularly the growing relationship of Hanks and son as they continue to thwart danger.
1537;Road to Perdition (Sam Mendes, 2002)After Sam Mendes won Best Director for American Beauty, he basically had his pick of stars for film #2.
1538;He lined up the hooks, set the bait, and they bit in spades.
1539;"That makes Road to Perdition somewhat hard to absorb oneself in
I:9607;1540;while Tom Hanks and Paul Newman got the big billing on the marquees, the real star of the film is relative newcomer Tyler Hoechlin, who has been since making a name for himself on TV series Seventh Heaven.
I:9607;1541;Sullivan and Rooney's son, the sadistic dilettante Connor (Daniel Craig, recently of Enduring Love and Lara Croft: Tomb Raider), are dispatched to talk to Finn about his accusations.
I:9607;1542;Michael Jr., curious about his father's job, hides in the car, discovering that his father is, in fact, a hit man.
I:9607;1543;he wake, which covers roughly the first ten minutes of the film, is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.
I:9607;1544;More good performances crop up here, all of which consist of very little screen time for some very big names, including Jude Law and Stanley Tucci.
I:9607;1545;The film has good points and bad points both, but finally, the good points win out by a slim margin.
I:9607;1546;Road to Perdition is worth seeing, especially when one considers that it is part of the rapidly.
I:9607;1547;I really enjoyed this film.
I:9607;1548;I enjoyed the father son relationship, tom and his son.
I:9607;1549;And Mr Newman was great.
I:9607;1550;But the thing that got me was the look of the film.
I:9607;1551;It's dimly lit as it really was in those days, well acted, and a good story.
I:9607;1552;but they dress real nice.
I:9607;1553;with the greatest non actor of them all pauly newman.
I:9607;1554;with just a hint of an irish brogue there.
I:9607;1555;As I then viewed the film, I assumed that Hanks accepted the role because he liked the script, respected director Sam Mendes, and wanted to work with Paul Newman.
I:9607;1556;Hoechlin is among the most talented of younger actors, female or male.
I:9607;1557;In this film, he skillfully portrays a doting and devoted son who inadvertently becomes centrally involved in his father's career in crime.
I:9607;1558;The situation is exacerbated by the fact that Rooney sees Michael Sr. as his """"true"""" son."""
1559;This film is set in the 1930s.
1560;"He reports to a ""corporate headquarters"" located in Chicago, headed by Al Capone."
1561;Special credit to David Self for an extraordinarily clean and crisp script, and to Conrad L. Hall's cinematography which earned for him an Academy Award.
1562;In years to come, it will be interesting to observe the course and direction of his career.
1563;The acting was fairly good.
1564;I bought this product for a gift.
1565;If you like the mafia movies, this movie is a good option.
1566;This is an extraordinary movie about fathers and sons, a rarity in this politically correct world.
1567;In a sense, this is true.
1568;It is a father's mandate to help his sons grow up to be men and to have a moral center.
1569;not only does the story draw me back again and again, the pure beauty of the cinematography makes watching the movie an enjoyable event.
1570;there is an unspoken theme that weaves itself through this film, namely, the judgment of God.
1571;As he assembles his gun, there in the background is a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
1572;As Sullivan turns and talks to his son, the picture remains with us, just over Michael's shoulder.
1573;Best Tom Hanks move ever !
1574;This was a ganster move alright , but it was also great story telling.
1575;If you like a little more thought provoking material in your ganster flick than you will enjoy this movie.
1576;Excellent pacing is what makes this movie unique and brialliant.
1577;Also, kudos to the acting which is excellent.
1578;"in ""The Road to Perdition,"" Sam Mendes' excellent follow."
1579;"winning ""American Beauty"" from 1999."
1580;that of Michael Sullivan, a family man with two young boys who also happens to work as a hit man for crime boss John Rooney, an aging father figure who raised Michael as one of his own.
1581;Sullivan's children, Michael Jr. and Peter, are in the dark as to just what it is their father does for a living, but when the older boy, Michael, witnesses one of his dad's on.
1582;The Road to Perdition deserves immense praise for featuring a less.
1583;savory figure as its central character.
1584;complexities of the character with which it is asking us to identify.
1585;Ironically, these truths are also reflected to a certain extent in the chilling relationship between John and his own ruthless son, Connor.
1586;These two relationships provide some intriguing parallels and contrasts which help to enrich the overall theme of the work.
1587;One scene, in particular, in which the older Michael is ambushed in a hotel room, is extraordinarily suspenseful, executed with assured, split.
1588;second timing by director Mendes and editor, Jill Bilcock.
1589;Mendes shows himself to be a master of the subtle moment as well, since the other great scene in the film involves a late night chat between father and son, a near.
1590;wordless encounter that underlines the growing love and respect that father and son are developing for one another.
1591;The quiet, hushed tone of the scene provides an effective counterpoint to all the rat.
1592;Newman creates a stunning portrait of an old man who can seemingly operate on two contradictory levels at the same time: one as a man capable of immense warmth and filial devotion to those he cares for and the other as a man ruthless enough to maintain his grasp on the life he's made and the position of power he's attained at any and all costs.
1593;Jude Law achieves a perfect creepiness as the steely.
1594;But the real acting honors go to young Tyler Hoechlin who manages to upstage even these seasoned professionals as Michael Jr., conveying in his every move, gesture and facial expression the innate innocence, warmth and intelligence of this 12.
1595;Hoechlin understands the quiet power that can be achieved through a look and a glance.
1596;mendes does an exquisite job capturing the bleak nature of the film's early.
1597;"Beautifully crafted and brilliantly acted, ""The Road to Perdition"" is a quietly powerful film that draws us into its world in a most interesting and persuasive way."
1598;Great crime drama with excellent acting.
1599;I would recommend this movie.
1600;Tom Hanks and Paul Newman are great together.
1601;The supporting acting is brilliant.
1602;Before I start I would like to clear things up and say this is a overall good movie.
1603;His directing is spot on with every scene of the movie alive and jumping with action and color.
1604;I would go out on a limb and say he is one of the best movie makers around, and I wait for his next movie.
1605;I was expecting a fast moving, thought provoking gangster epic.
1606;Film is a visual medium for crying out loud!
1607;For the price of tickets is high, and there are other films to choose from.
1608;A man, a good man, a family man, and also probably a murderer several times over, an arm breaker and enforcer and a father of two boys, is forced to run for his life from his old boss, and take his young son with him.
1609;And he has his son.
1610;I think it's a marvelous lens through which to look at many things that are both very human and very American at the same time.
1611;the movie is absolutely studded and glistening with wonderful performances.
1612;Hanks' deep Catholic faith is juxtaposed with his ingrained warlike nature .
1613;But this is a wonderful, beautiful film, and one that everyone involved can be very proud of.
1614;The visuals are beautiful, the acting is wonderful, the music and sound are stunning, and yet I feel like it did not live up to it's full potential.
1615;Tom Hanks is better than he demonstrated in this film, and the script seemed to suffer from a lack of interesting dialogue.
1616;So, I didn't really enjoy it the first time around.
1617;Its a beautifully suspenseful movie with a brillant cast.
1618;If you enjoy movies that are deeper then just the regular action movies, then this is the movie for you.
1619;Everyone I've given a copy to, especially the elderly have loved it !!
1620;"Road To Perdition is a fine Saturday matinee for adults
I:9607;1621;I think of the Coen Brothers' """"Miller's Crossing,"""" a stylish movie only enjoyable on the first level and not the second, whereas this vehicle has deeper and darker shades upon which to ruminate."""
1622;Hanks has two sons and a wife, and Newman has his son and is a widow.
1623;they do, sure enough, and all would be well if one of Hanks' son weren't there to see it.
1624;"That's the illogic of the mafia
I:9607;1625;This idea is considered nicely in our introduction to the character"
1626;This is the best looking film of the year.
1627;I'd like to credit director Sam Mendes, and I will, but only because he allowed the cinematographer, the departed Conrad L. Hall, the freedom to be a virtuoso.
1628;But its place on the list of many movie fans will linger, because there's much to ponder.
1629;What we have will have to do, but this was an outstanding film.
1630;Tom Hanks is brilliant in his role, along with other well known/famous actors.
1631;On top of having an awesome story, it has the very best of the best actors and actresses who along with the best producers, writers and all the others who worked together to bring this story to life, and in my opinion they totally aced it!
1632;Film is obviously a great seducer with the ability to create dramatic effect with all the great cinematic effects and music, not to mention the faces we've all come to love.
1633;This movie has plenty of all that.
1634;Some of the scenes are really gorgeous to look at.
1635;Road to Perdition is easily the best film of the summer.
1636;This ultra dark movie brings up a lot of morals, thoughs, and about how crime doesn't pay.
1637;Plot wise is near perfect!
1638;nevertheless, this is not supposed to be based on reality, it's just a movie and it does entertain brilliantly.
1639;i give an easy pass to the aforementioned flaws since this movie is based upon a graphic novel so, obviously, the visual takes presedence over other aspects and the visual is quite impressive.
1640;As in any comic book, he has few things to say.
1641;Paul Newman is portrayed as a physically frail yet mentally strong mob boss.
1642;In fact, everybody as brief lines consistent with a graphic novel.
1643;the scenes of old cars careening through country roads or Chicago streets are highly artistic.
1644;Likewise, many of the city scenes are done in a art deco manner and are very cinematic.
1645;the best thing about this movie is it's visuals.
1646;Every scene is meaningful, every shadow has it's purpose, every sound advances the plot.
1647;Just like a comic book, every scene is punctuated and that is what makes this movie so great.
1648;the tone of the movie, the visuals, the characters are all over.
1649;top stylish and that is why I find this movie to be such an entertaining piece of art.
1650;When you bring together such talent as Paul Newman, Tom Hanks and Jude Law, it is almost expected that the movie will be a masterpiece.
1651;Tom Hanks alone, whose body of work includes such incredible performances as Philidelphia, Forrest Gump and Castaway, is an exceptional talent whose abilities are unmatched in Hollywood today.
1652;He possesses the rare gift of truly suspending disbelief by completely immersing himself in the role he plays.
1653;But what makes this a great film isn't its similarities to the other forementioned classics, but its bold stance to humanize the face of a mobster.
1654;Hank's character is likeable, exhibiting a humanity and a vulnerability not normally portrayed in the hit.
1655;His relationship with his son is a pivotal part of the plot, as he must balance his hunger for revenge with the need to protect his boy.
1656;paul Newman also brings a level of depth to the movie which makes him a complicated and difficult character, someone audiences will both pity and hate, and he is played with a level of intelligence and believability that makes him a delight to watch.
1657;still, this film deserves the highest rating that I gave it.
1658;It is a first class collection of performances built on a very engaging storyline of power and corruption in 1930's mob manipulated America.
1659;A great performance by Tom Hanks and a very good filmmaking effort by Mendes.
1660;Some films just resonate with the viewer and this one did that for me.
1661;It is a perfect period film and Hanks and Newman have never been better.
1662;The story is riviting, it holds your attention from start to finish.
1663;Director Mendes really hits his stride here, and the young actor playing Hanks son is quite a talent.
1664;Much of the film is set in the winter and you can feel the chill in the air, the weather is a ominious presence.
1665;The interection between Hanks and Newman is electric, the scene when Hanks is at the piano and Newman comes over is one of the best acting I have ever seen on film.
1666;If you appreciate great movies, then you will thoroughly enjoy this film, a true work of art.
1667;what else do you need to make a great coming of age film set against the gangster lifestyle of the 1930's.
1668;Tom Hanks is an enforcer, Newman's strong arm, who tries to lead a normal home life with a wife and two sons.
1669;Hanks and his son go on the run and eventually become a huge thorn in the side of Capone's business interests as Hanks exacts his revenge.
1670;all of the performances are stupendous, especially Newman who chooses his flesh and blood son over the adopted son he really loves, and Jude Law as a really sick hit man who specializes in taking pictures of dead people.
1671;Also amazing is the cinematography, which has the feel of a black and white film even though it's in color.
1672;Many of the shots could be framed as art, and they are actually art because this movie is based on a graphic novel.
1673;the director sets the mood and tone from the outset with his camera work and the excellent score by Thomas Newman.
1674;really, this is a story of a father and a son that just happens to be in the context of a gangster movie, and that's what makes this movie really special.
1675;To protect their children they will do anything, and that is always admirable, even when the father is an enforcer for the mob.
1676;"i'm very surprised it wasn't nominated for best movie, it's much more solid and attains what it sets out to do, unlike ""Gangs of New York."""
1677;real emotions of many variations and dynamics, great character acting, awesome visuals and a fanastic score.
1678;It may not be the kind of movie you'll want to watch over and over, but it's definitely worth a first look.
1679;the soundtrack is hands down one of the greatest I've ever heard in a movie and the story, although somewhat slow at times, is still both intriguing and intense.
1680;Simply because he is a good director.
1681;He brought us American Beauty, and this film, Road to Perdition, and just because of those two I will not forgot that name.
1682;"Being his second ""big"" film, Road to Perdition shows a similar technique as American Beauty but expanding his directing abilities to fit this new genre."
1683;The end product is amazing.
1684;The score, by Thomas Newman, fills every scene with emotion which affects the viewer immensely.
1685;Newman has created a breathtaking score which magnifies every scene, especially the dreamlike shooting sequences in the rain near the end of the film.
1686;With this, the pair of them succeed admirably.
1687;The developing relationship between the two is a highlight, it is never overexposed, but it presented gently enough to make an impact.
1688;They are closer than Newman is with his real son, which sparks jealousy (which fuels the murder).
1689;the story makes more of an impact because through a lot of it we connect through the eyes of the innocent boy.
1690;He is dragged into a life he is not, and his actions are powerful, moreso because of the great acting of him.
1691;Jude Law also makes an appearance in this movie, a role which is surprising to see him in, to say the least, but works incredibly well with.
1692;This is a good technique, but in return, there are some moments which would have had a larger emotional impact if we had not seen them coming (namely, the final scene in which one of the characters die).
1693;I also thought the voice.
1694;overall, Road to Perdition is definitely an amazing movie which deserves it's place in your shelf.
1695;Of course, the movie itself is also something I would not want anyone to miss, it is a beautiful tale with amazing direction, lighting, music, the whole works.
1696;Sam Mendes has another masterpiece in his hand, and I look forward to seeing what else comes from his hands.
1697;tom Hanks is as always in superior form.
1698;The story is well told, suspenseful and well acted by all.
1699;But kudos to the director and producers for an extremely realistic portrayal of a family man involved in the mob circa 1931.
1700;Tom Hanks once again gives a great performance as Michael Sullivan.
1701;Paul Newman gives a well deserved Oscar nominated performance.
1702;But, I really enjoyed the music to this film.
1703;Probably the best use of music in a movie in the last few years.
1704;Sam Mendes' attention to detail takes away a star, but it's still a great sophomore effort by the Academy Award winner.
1705;One of my all time favorite movies.
1706;This is a great movie.
1707;I mean it's no masterpiece, but it's a really good movie.
1708;Jennifer Jason Leigh, well, she's my favorite actress (Unite ladies!)
1709;I keep forgetting my favorite actress is in this movie.
1710;What a legend, and a real rare gentleman from what I'm told.
1711;this is an Oscar winning film, as the stunning cinematography was recognized.
1712;And rightly so, because this is a beaut.
1713;when 1930's hitman Michael Sullivan, played by Hanks, finds that his son Michael Jr, played by Hoechlin, had witnessed him and Collin Rooney, played by the most recent Agent 007, Craig, the son of his father figure gangster boss John Rooney, played remarkably by Newman, finish a job, he knows that his family's life as well as his own is in danger.
1714;He carries out the job of finishing Sullivan and his family succeeding in killing his wife, played by Leigh, and younger child.
1715;hearted killer creates a special bond with his son, and slowly redeems himself.
1716;Sullivan realizes that he must do all he can so his son will never follow in his footsteps.
1717;perdition is an awesome film, with incredible cinematography, a heart.
1718;warming storyline, and great performances by the entire cast.
1719;Keeps your attention through the whole movie.
1720;And it is always good to see Paul Newman
1721;"Sam Mendes' turgid adapation of ""The Road to Perdition"" embodies much of what makes modern American cinema so one note."
1722;looking but surprisingly popular lead Tom Hanks plays what has become a contemporary archetype: hit man with a heart.
1723;and who wears a funny hat .
1724;"Ultimately, ""The Road to Perdition"" may best be remembered as the film that showed us a pre."
1725;There are many better choices this year for the Oscar Best Actor nomination.
1726;I love Tom Hanks, but forget about him this year.
1727;This movie got rated R for violence and language.
1728;this is a fine example of what the studios can achieve when reformatting a film to Blu Ray and this really is a great remaster.
1729;While the Standard Def version was not bad, you will see a greatly improved color balance and a significantly sharper contrast in the Blu Ray release.
1730;The biggest difference between formats is that there is so much more to the details in the Blu Ray version.
1731;Mbps rate tended to average in the mid thirties so this disc really has a relatively higher bit rate than most.
1732;There is a good deal of discreet directionality to the sides and rears when appropriate though it contains quite a bit more audio for the front stage and center than anything else.
1733;The extra I most enjoyed was an exploration in a historical sense of the life and times of many of the gangsters portrayed in the film as well as other aspects of the time.
1734;Newman is unbelievable, Hanks is outstanding, and that little boy is amazing.
1735;This is one of the best films of the summer, and should win every Oscar that it gets nominated for.
1736;All of the performances were superb, the direction, the music by Thomas Newman, everything about this movie was great!
1737;It was a wonderful father/son story.
1738;He is a great actor, and should win another Oscar.
1739;Paul Newman was great, too!
1740;The Road to Perdition was a marvelous movie with the exceptional cinematography.
1741;I must say it had a violent theme but nonetheless the beauty of the way it was crafted, was extraordinary.
1742;It is not a masterpiece like the godfather series due to the simplistic story line.
1743;The surviving Sullivans escape and embark on a journey of revenge and survival.
1744;Hanks is an incredible actor, but he's also a movie star cast against type in this one.
1745;Cinematographer Conrad Hall is a genius, especially when it comes to filming rain.
1746;The sets are gorgeous, the feeling of depression.
1747;era America is well captured.
1748;This is a wonderful looking film, and that's both the best thing and the worst thing about it.
1749;it's a story about paternal love, sibling rivalry, generational change, final acts of redemption and, of course, the path to destruction.
1750;Paul Newman stands out amongst the cast, giving his best performance in years.
1751;his cinematography is magnificent, even if misapplied to this material.
1752;It's usually the visual rendering of a story which has caught the director's eye, and everything else in the production gets subjugated to recreating that.
1753;it's one of the best looking films in years, but not much else.
1754;It is a film that plays it safe and simple.
1755;Conrad L. Hall's terrific cinematography ensures that the audience is always looking at a pretty picture and the cast is outstanding.
1756;Additionally, it is always a treat to see Newman perform and he brings a quiet but powerful dignity to all of his scenes.
1757;Road to Perdition is one film that I saw three times in the theater last year, and that's very rare.
1758;I was got up in the story, the mood it created, and the acting.
1759;The acting was perfect on almost all counts.
1760;The cinematography is beautiful and haunting.
1761;This is director Sam Mendes' second movie, and it vastly improved upon his overrated film debut American Beauty .
1762;Road to Perdition , however, is cinematic heaven.
1763;This movie is the first movie I saw Tom Hanks play a serious role.
1764;He is a great actor and plays the role of Michael Sullivan so well.
1765;this movie takes place during the Depression era and is about a man and his son on the run.
1766;So grab yourself some popcorn or chips and some thing to drink and enjoy this movie.
1767;Great cast with a collection of stars that make you expect a lot more than this movie offers.
1768;Stately, elegiac and beautifully photographed Road to Perdition is a tale of redemption and revenge.
1769;it is worth the price of the ticket just to see Newman and Hanks interacting.
1770;Newman has the dramatic role of anguished love for his adopted aide, a lilting Irish charm, and a deadly coldness.
1771;stealing role of assassin McGuire is a marvel of slithery, oddly graceful pop.
1772;Stanley Tucci is a splendid suave, civilized Frank Nitti.
1773;Overall, Road to Perdition is an amazing experience of mood, originality and visual artistry
1774;The Godfather is more of a large complex story of many years that includes many characters to tell the story.
1775;While the Godfather is the best movie ever in my opinion Road To Perdition is right behind it.
1776;Unlike the Godfather it is a small easy to follow mobster movie that has Tom Hanks as a one of Capone's hitmen.
1777;It is a heart warming story from start to finish with the usual mob scenes in between.
1778;It's all romantic comedies from now on, Pal!
1779;The story is great the acting is great and you really get into the movie and will not get up to go to the bathroom or anything like that you will stay sitting down staring at the screen until the movie is over
1780;This is one of those 'makes you cry, makes you laugh all at the same time' kind of flicks.
1781;Daniel craig, Jude Law, and the other supporting actors definatley pull their weight as well.
1782;So, basically, this is just a great movie and its a must see.
1783;Road to Perdition may be the vehicle that gets Tom Hanks (in my opinion the best damned American actor of the past 15 years) out of his 'nice guy' role, but it should most definitely rope him an Oscar for Best Actor.
1784;the film, as you most certainly already know, details the story of Sullivan and his son attempting to seek revenge for the murders of Sullivan's wife and youngest son.
1785;there are moments that will stay with you long after the film has passed.
1786;Even the melancholy and maddingly sorrowful film score will stick deep inside of you, as composer Thomas Newman did an absolutely wonderful job of capturing the essence of the story in his music.
1787;The moral dilemmas of Mike and his son are quite evident, and the killing in the film all has a feeling of necessity to it, there are no scenes of gratuitous killing, every death has a purpose.
1788;"all in all, this has to rank with ""Gladiator"" and ""L. a. Confidential"" as one of the best films to be produced in the last 5 years."
1789;wrenching, bloody, violent, emotional and unforgettable are all words you could use to describe this masterpiece.
1790;Road to Perdition, a film that only comes along once a lifetime.
1791;See why Tom Hanks took the role for yourself.
1792;tom Hanks stars as Michale Sullivan, a hit man who works for an older man named John Rooney [Paul Newman] in the early 1930's.
1793;When Sullivan's oldest son [Tyler Hoechlin] witnesses an unplanned murder on one of Sullivan's mob hits, Sullivan is determined to have his son keep it to himself.
1794;The main plotline is both Sullivan and his son on the run, looking for a new safe place to live.
1795;So many great actors, one movie that will assure you the acting will never get dull.
1796;His interaction with Hanks in the diner is chilling, telling Hanks what he thinks of his line of work as a photographer as he loads a camera [and also a gun under the bench.]
1797;The ending is surprsing [At least I thought so] and a powerful message from the son gives this movie a 5 star rating.
1798;the extras include commentary by the director, Sam Mendes, and also some of the actors.
1799;"Deleted scenes, with alternate commentary, a photo gallery, and also HBO's ""Making of Documentary."""
1800;His first main feature, American Beauty was an exhilerating tale that on one level was a satire of surban life, while also a dark, melancholic depection of the meaning of life and how beautiful each small essence of it can be.
1801;Road to Perdition , his next feature, has a simlar tone to it and is a film that is layered similar to an onion.
1802;tom Hanks is good (yes, only good.
1803;Road to Perdition is a powerful tale that captures the essence of the extraordinary possibilites presented in a father.
1804;It is a film that shows the corruptness of the business world at the time (the film was depicted around the time of the depression), but ultimately unfolds as a journey about vengeance, redemption, and love.
1805;this is a film that subtly transcends themes of revenge and instead gives us a timeless tale of a father's love.
1806;Some of the 20's period cinematography was pretty but not worth a movie on the small screen.
1807;In the 1930s, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is a family man living in the suburban mid.
1808;His secret is safe and life continues on as usual until one day, his son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), witnesses his father execute someone.
1809;Sullivan and his family are targeted for elimination and only he and his son manage to escape to Chicago, where he plans his revenge.
1810;As with most films based on a novel, the story here is top notch and very well written.
1811;Tom Hanks is the premier actor of our time, a man who will be remembered for centuries, but was he really the right choice to play Michael Sullivan?
1812;Road To Perdition was a tremendous story and was full of award winning actors, but the star power was more important to the producers, then finding actors who fit the characters as they were written.
1813;Aside from that and a painfully predictable ending, that you have to see coming, this was a pretty good film.
1814;I loved the setting and how dark it was, as well as the originality of a film that takes places nearly 60 years ago.
1815;I just find it ironic that in a cast full of Academy Award winning actors, it's a kid who steals the show.
1816;Road to Perdition is a very good drama, documenting a father and son's six.
1817;tom Hanks is Mike Sullivan, hit man for an important businessman until his son witnesses him commit murder.
1818;He is wonderfully heartless and unemotional, not flinching as he kills men in cold blood.
1819;It is a very good drama, combining your typical mafia movie with big.
1820;As with Michael, he finds that this life is his destiny and becomes on eof the best in the business.
1821;Hanks is brilliant in a role he deserved an Oscar nomination for, playing the Vito Corleone.
1822;He is convincing in this manner, showing that this life was the one he chose, but hadn't wanted for his children.
1823;road to Perdition is a very good movie, as you would expect when Tom Hanks is involved.
1824;A solid storyline, strong casting, and the 5.
1825;I liked the cinematography, the style in which in the movie was shot and the long.
1826;shots coupled with some real spiffy camera work.
1827;He's stared death in the face a number of times yet always manages to end up still alive.
1828;developed character played by Jude Law.
1829;The script was screaming SETUP as soon as the 'happy ending' music played as Sullivan and son took a stroll along the beach.
1830;Back then, I thought the movie was pretty good.
1831;themed story, liked the bits of character development throughout, and enjoyed the overall aesthetic feel of post.
1832;I was particularly engrossed by the parallel relationships shared between father and son through all forms: Sullivan and his son, Rooney and his son, then Rooney and Sullivan Sr.
1833;son pairings make for some very quaint and believable bonds, while still managing to make these characters empathetic.
1834;Tom Hanks is in top form as Sullivan Sr. with outstanding support performances by Daniel Craig, Stanley Tucci, Jude Law, Tyler Hoechlin, and the late Paul Newman.
1835;Oh well, regardless of Oscar snubs, I'm happy to say this is definitely a new all.
1836;time favorite for me now.
1837;4.5As mentioned, Road to Perdition won an Academy Award for Cinematography, and with good reason.
1838;Colors are subdued, with a lot of grays, charcoals, and solid blacks being the focus.
1839;But despite the photography, they look as good as can be.
1840;Blacks are super deep and inky, with some especially excellent line and shadow delineation amidst the many, many darkly.
1841;The image is one of the finest I've seen on BD to date.
1842;Aside from that one little mishap, the picture is essentially perfect.
1843;Directionality and separation offer all kinds of goodness from proper placement to panning, to flawless mixing between dialogue and music.
1844;Every subtle sound, high and low, front, left, right, and back are handled with a great amount of care and detail.
1845;The dialogue is always pitch.
1846;perfect and never distorts through the center, while the occasional background noise, street crowd, blowing of wind, and car engine add a good deal of depth to the city of Chicago.
1847;Thomas Newman's score (another shocking fact to know he hasn't won an Oscar yet) sounds wonderful and emotionally stirring, propelling the drama on.
1848;wise, but have a particularly great moment during the passing of a subway train when we first meet Jude Law's character.
1849;This is definitely reference material.
1850;And the commentary by Mendes is as good as they come.
1851;Next to Michael Mann and Christopher Nolan, this one of the best commentaries I've heard.
1852;He's very into the explanation of the film, both from a technical and literary viewpoint, and really gets in.
1853;depth with a lot of the explanations concerning what he wanted to convey on.
1854;New to the BD is an introduction by Mendes to this new and impressive Blu.
1855;ray edition, a retrospect on the life and career of the film's master cinematographer, the late Conrad L. Hall, and an interactive library explaining some of the period elements of the film.
1856;And I have to say, after seeing the feature on Mr. Hall, my interest in the man has really peaked now.
1857;Before seeing this film, I knew photography could make a world of difference in the way a movie feels.
1858;As for the new library archive, I found it very interesting in terms of content, but the tiny screen thing was a problem.
1859;For what it is, though, it's full of some pretty good, albeit sparse, information.
1860;4.5I thought the movie was pretty good when I first saw it.
1861;But knowing what I know now, and with the help of Blu.
1862;ray, I have to say I really love the film.
1863;It's a character drama that's full of heart and really draws a lot of empathy from me, personally.
1864;The A/V specs are definitely the pinnacle of BD technology, and it's nice to even get a blessing from Mendes himself (an admitted skeptic, initially).
1865;Add to that a great set of special features, and you have yourself a must.
1866;the performances are, by and large, excellent.
1867;Hanks turns in a good performance, certainly didn't phone it in.
1868;Paul Newman is excellent and the transition from hearty gang boss to broken old man as the film progresses works well.
1869;Jude Law is excellent (damn his good looks and his talent and his fashionable wife) and the part where he is fiddling with his camera in the diner in a truly model bit of business.
1870;And it's got Stanley Tucci in it .
1871;It looks really, really good.
1872;Well beneath the good looks and the performances, it's not actually a particularly good film.
1873;The actors probably give the script more than it deserves to be honest.
1874;Basically, it's a very average film, lifted by the heroic efforts of the cast and director.
1875;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!!
1876;The plot is beautiful and the actors are great.
1877;I am not a big fan of mob movies but this one is great.
1878;This movie is great on all those points.
1879;The movies overall production, content, and theme were stupendous!
1880;I was never really into movies till early this year until I saw the overrated Lord of the rings, and then I caught up with movies, from Casablanca to Braveheart, I watched all the good ones, and let me say this, this movie is almost as good and moving as The Shawshank redemption!
1881;It is a beautiful movie, atmosphere, plot and cinematography.
1882;And Thomas Newman(The Shawshank Redemption) provides another excellent score, It would be an understatement to say This is the best movie music I've ever heard, in fact, the only way to do justice to this music(and movie) s to see it and hear the wonderful work of thomas newman.
1883;Mike Sullivan works as a hit man for crime boss John Rooney.
1884;Sullivan views Rooney as a father figure.
1885;Tom Hanks does a excellent job.
1886;This is a great movie.
1887;The time taken to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the superb performances, the stunning lighting and cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack.
1888;was a good movie about fathers and sons.
1889;"The movie is directed by Sam Mendes, who directed ""American Beauty', his first feature film."
1890;family drama Road to Perdition directed Academy Award winning direction Sam Mendes (American Beauty) and starring Tom Hanks, Paul Newman, and Jude Law has something in common with the likes of The Crow, Hellboy, and Batman, but the truth is they're all a part of the same family of movies.
1891;trip movie, and stirring father.
1892;the acting is as good as an audience could expect from this all.
1893;A change from the graphic novel that phenomenally increases the human drama of the film is that Michael Sullivan has come to hold John Rooney as a father figure.
1894;In return Paul Newman treats Sullivan as a surrogate son.
1895;Newman truly saved one of his career's best performances for last in his illustrious career.
1896;even more essential to the film's success than the outstanding performances from Hanks and Newman is its cinematography.
1897;Road to Perdition is an incredibly stylish movie, but not in the same way the graphic novel was.
1898;Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall changes the story from an American set Samurai movie to a timeless portrait of American culture.
1899;The Oscar winning cinematography is easily Road to Perdition's greatest strength.
1900;Director Sam Mendes said that after the Best Picture winning American Beauty he wanted to make a film that focused more on telling its story through visuals instead of dialogue and he succeeds.
1901;up to the Best Picture winning American Beauty.
1902;Most all of these complaints seem to have died down over the years, but a large percentage of the population seldom acknowledges the film on the basis that it stars Hollywood nice.
1903;Road to Perdition is a familial drama which happens to have gangsters in it.
1904;The movie is an outstanding example of writers should adapt a source material in such a way that the heart of the story is kept intact while still offering something delightful and new for those who've already read the graphic novel.
1905;son relationship, which was the true heart of the graphic novel, remained completely intact, and in some ways was even improved upon in the movie.
1906;While movies such as From Hell (2001) were the first attempt at bringing graphic novels to universal attention, Road to Perdition is the film that sealed the medium's identity as an art.
1907;For that reason Road to Perdition is perhaps the most important movie in the history of movie adaptations of graphic novels.
1908;instead it is also a tale of fathers and sons, family and obligations.
1909;For Hanks it is easy, though he is caught between his loyalty to his family and his long time mentor.
1910;road to Perdition is a well thought out, adult and intelligent film.
1911;It takes its time to develop a story and treats the viewer as an intelligent observer.
1912;Tom Hanks is excellent as an Irish Catholic mobster and family man for whom his profession is a job.
1913;Newman does a fine job himself as the gang boss/mentor to Hanks.
1914;The writing in this film is also to be commended.
1915;I love all of the old cars and the styles.
1916;This is another film of great subtlety where I think Tom Hanks really plays one of his most daring roles as a father of two boys that also works for the mob during prohibition era.
1917;the directing and lighting are absolutely flawless, and when I first saw the climax scene in the theater, I was amazed at how the silence and darkness were used to make such an atmosphere.
1918;I enjoyed this movie when it was first released and am glad to have a good copy to view when I want.
1919;Great perfomnances, a stunning direction, gorgeous music, a fine screenplay, and real entertainment!
1920;When you find this factors in a movie you can only say its a perfect one.
1921;This was a very well acted film with a strong cast.
1922;The film has some great visuals and sound as well.
