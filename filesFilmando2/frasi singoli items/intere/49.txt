I:74;1;Duck Soup is a great classic from the Marx Brothers.
I:74;2;if you pay attention to this movie you'll see the magic of Marx Bros' comedy and how bits and pieces of it have made it into films made by the likes of Monty Python.
I:74;3;Definitely the Marx Brother's best movie ever!
I:74;4;They never said a vulgar joke, and, oh yeah, all of them are legends and created some of the funniest movies of all time.
I:74;5;"well, ""Duck Soup"" is the funniest movie that the Marx brothers ever did."
I:74;6;The movie is packed with hilarious dialogue, wacky scenes, unforgettable comedic sequences, and smart satire.
I:74;7;You name it: it has slapstick, satire, physical gags, smart one.
I:74;8;liners, smart elaborated jokes, musical humor, etc, etc, etc.
I:74;9;Notice how every bit of dialogue Groucho has is a wise.
I:74;10;Duck Soup is a comedy those not familiar with the Marx Brothers will enjoy.
I:74;11;It may turn you into a fan.
I:74;12;You'll be so impressed with the wise.
I:74;13;line: One of the fastest comedies of all.
I:74;14;The Marx brothers are at their zany best.
I:74;15;One of their best films!
I:74;16;This wonderfully hilarious Marx Brothers movie is considered a classic of the genre, and is sometime held up as the best movie that the Marx Brothers ever made.
I:74;17;if you like a funny movie, then regardless of your age, you will like this movie!
I:74;18;Even though it was made in 1933, the humor holds up excellently, making the movie a riot to watch even now in the twenty.
I:74;19;Watch a classic, watch Duck Soup!
I:74;20;This is such a great movie to watch, it's a shame it's not longer.
I:74;21;Groucho is superb as Rufus T. Firefly, I think this role probably suited him the best of all his films.
I:74;22;His sharp wit is most evident in this film.
I:74;23;If the war scene was longer, then I would have given it 5 stars, because the ending seemed somewhat anticlimactic, but still an excellent picture.
I:74;24;DUCK SOUP is arguably the most famous of the Marx Brothers films and contains much of their most well.
I:74;25;No such padding exists in this film and the result is one of the best they ever made.
I:74;26;While there are examples of that, some of the funniest material comes simply from the Marx Brothers' usual blend of slapstick and quick wit.
I:74;27;The satire and the Marx Brothers together in one film make for an extraordinary feat.
I:74;28;This is one of the funniest films I have ever seen.
I:74;29;It's a film that stands up to multiple repeated viewings, so you'll be watching it again and again.
I:74;30;Weak ticket sales, combined with disputes the family had with the studio, led to their movie contract's non.
I:74;31;These scenes are among the most classic moments in the Marx canon, but with DUCK SOUP we are denied such pleasures.
I:74;32;edged wit and his interactions with both bewigged brothers are top shelf.
I:74;33;And of course, Maggie Dumont is at the top of her game as Groucho's comic foil.
I:74;34;If the world and the war was this fun.
I:74;35;This is my favorite Marx Brothers comedy.
I:74;36;"Freedonia's Going to War and everyone is singing about it!There are so many great bits in this one: Harpo and Chico battling the lemonade vendor
I:74;37;"can't you see what I'm saying, I love you!"""
I:74;38;arguably their best,this effort didn't do well on release.
I:74;39;But, it is just plain funny with some of Groucho's best lines and some of the best interplay between the brothers, and without a lot of the shmaltz and corn and musical interludes.
I:74;40;The Marx Brothers hit their full stride in this hilarious comedy.
I:74;41;liners make this movie a top pick.
I:74;42;there is singing, there is dancing, there are spies, intrigue, romance (sort of), and something for everyone willing to be dragged through the manic.
I:74;43;Deep Thoughts5 stars all the way.
I:74;44;this is the Marx brothers at their best.
I:74;45;Sure this gem sometimes changes places with Monty Python and the holy grail in the thick underbrush of my mind but the point is, like MP&THG I laugh EVERY time I watch this.
I:74;46;world War II physical comedies, but I find the Marx Brothers fascinating.
I:74;47;Their humor was more cranial and challenging than that of their peers.
I:74;48;The name of his character alone, Rufus T. Firefly, will make you laugh.
I:74;49;This is light, happy stuff and that's exactly why their films will be treasured forever.
I:74;50;This is the Marx Brother's best film.
I:74;51;Groucho Marx was one of the funniest men alive, I would have liked to meet him in person.
I:74;52;The amazing thing is that the whole family was born with a wacky sense of humor.
I:74;53;Groucho has the funniest dialogue, every time he opens his mouth it's a guaruanteed laugh.
I:74;54;From a scale of 1.10 I give this movie a 10!
I:74;55;`Duck Soup', starring the four (4) Marx Brothers is hands down the Marx Brothers' best movie and has been named the fifth best comedy of all time by the American Film Institute.
I:74;56;In fact, the Marx Brothers, expecially Groucho, is one of the seminal, most influential comedy acts in the 20th Century.
I:74;57;I believe that every major comedian, especially skit and physical comedy acts can trace influences to the Marx Brothers.
I:74;58;The movie is also distinguished by the fact that while in most other films, Harpo is merely funny, in this movie, his business has an edge bordering on the manic.
I:74;59;the movie is also distinguished by including what is perhaps the very best visual comedy skit ever seen on film.
I:74;60;He's right, you've got to take up the tacks before you can take up the carpet!
I:74;61;I even enjoyed the musical numbers(especially.
I:74;62;sheer Marx Brothers irrevrancy at its best.
I:74;63;please save ur $2 dollars that this movie is really worth.
I:74;64;Old movie I have always loved.
I:74;65;bought as a gift for my boss.
I:74;66;i agree, this is the greatest Marx Bros comedy of all time because it is timeless.
I:74;67;Those MGM films which at the time, and for some time later were considered the Brothers best work.
I:74;68;sit back, relax , and enjoy.
I:74;69;I am not a huge fan of the Marx's, but this film is certainly their best (closely followed by A Night at the Opera ).
I:74;70;It's perfectly simple, but at the same time is pretty accurate when you think about how most wars start.
I:74;71;The brothers knock off just the right mix of slapstick (Harpo), stupidity (Chico), smart.
I:74;72;It features enough gags for six features, but one this good is enough.
I:74;73;I have always been and will continue to be a BIG fan of anything Groucho!!
I:74;74;If you are into the Marx Brothers at all, you'll love this!!!
I:74;75;especially Duck Soup which perhaps is the best Marx Brother film.
I:74;76;There are many classic lines.
I:74;77;But the best I like Duck Soup is its sense of anarchy .
I:74;78;it is also the film that the Marx Brothers are at their peak, especially Harpo who is just magical .
I:74;79;the scene when he answered phone call with all kind of odd instruments and the mirror scene are just memorable.
I:74;80;a classic without a doubt.
I:74;81;"The 1933 comedy ""Duck Soup"" is arguably the finest effort of the Marx Brothers as they successfully bring their zany vaudevillian antics from the stage to the screen."
I:74;82;After 73 years this hysterical film holds up incredibly well.
I:74;83;The arrival of the two immediately rachets up the mayhem as they both brightly shine in their comedy routines.
I:74;84;while the film is a laugh riot interspersed with some musical numbers there are some segments that are notable for their comedic excellence.
I:74;85;Well, here we are with another wild and hilarious Marx Brothers farce, this time with Groucho taking over a small country and winding up in war with a neighboring one.
I:74;86;Many times their movies were vehicles for their vaudeville acts of funny lines, slapstick gags and musical talent.
I:74;87;Zeppo has a number of lines.
I:74;88;fantastic dialog makes this version one of the best of them all.
I:74;89;this is a really nonsense picture but it gets four stars because it really is a good comedy.
I:74;90;Margaret Dumont is the rich widow .
I:74;91;Zeppo was in it but not very remarkable.
I:74;92;The film was the last one featuring Zeppo and has some of the Marx Brothers most famous bits such as Groucho and Harpo's great mirror act, Harpo and Chico with the lemonade vendor and their none stop animated action combined with complex and humorous dialogue.
I:74;93;You can even see that Groucho's mustache is actually a wide splash of grease paint.
I:74;94;I recently saw this film at the local rep theater (AFI Silver) and the crowd laughed harder than they do at most modern comedy films.
I:74;95;the nice thing about comedy is that you don't need to explain a lot of things.
I:74;96;They are all wonderfully inept at what they do and the two countries slide hilariously into war.
I:74;97;there are so many classic highlights in this film.
I:74;98;There's also a Paul Revere parody with Harpo that is quite mature for the times at what it is suggesting.
I:74;99;The whole film is great, but the last half hour of Duck Soup may be the funniest sequence in American film.
I:74;100;Duck Soap is the Marx Brothers at their funniest, often their most political, and also at their most surreal.
I:74;101;Duck Soup was ranked number 5 in the AFI's top 100 funniest films of all time and the rating was well deserved.
I:74;102;(Margaret: I sponsored your appointment because I feel you are the most able statesman in all Freedonia.
I:74;103;Groucho: Well, that covers a lot of ground, Say, you cover a lot of ground yourself.
I:74;104;"Groucho: ""I'm fighting for your honor, which is more than I can say you've ever done!Unlike many ""modern day"" comedies, with the Marx Brothers, you actually have to pay attention to get the gags."
I:74;105;A perfect night of fun for me would be Duck Soup, Night at the Opera (you can fast forward through the musical scenes) and Horse Feathers.
I:74;106;All Hail Freedonia, land of the brave and free and funny!
I:74;107;Even after seventy years, the Marx Brothers' first film is still a classic.
I:74;108;Basically plotless, the film preserves for ever some of the group's most wonderful routines: the mirror sequence involving Chico and Harpo is quite simply brilliant.
I:74;109;As the 'president' of Freedonia, Groucho has great fun with a script that positively crackles with one.
I:74;110;"The film is also notable for one of the few screen appearances of Zeppo
I:74;111;I checked my usual places.
I:74;112;If you love the Marx brothers, or need to learn to love them.
I:74;113;this movie is a great place to start.
I:74;114;Thanks Amazon and those who post their wares with you.
I:74;115;This is by far the best of the Marx Brothers.
I:74;116;This crazy comedy keeps you laughing throughout the movie.
I:74;117;If you like what you see, consider getting the box set, though this is by far the best movie.
I:74;118;This film is truly hilarious and a piece of history in Cinema.
I:74;119;Great to watch with friends and have a great time.
I:74;120;Duck Soup is just about one of the funniest movies i have ever seen and the Marx Brothers are probably the funniest group i have ever seen.
I:74;121;the whole movie is an anti.
I:74;122;He enlists the help of a wily woman as well Chico and Harpo who are spies.
I:74;123;This would be the last film with Zeppo but the other brothers would move onto MGM and keep their career going.
I:74;124;This film is good but upon seeing more of their films I would say I appreciated A Night at the Opera more.
I:74;125;purpose delivery for every single joke: fast.
I:74;126;If you want an example of classic comedy intertwining elegantly with a story watch a Chaplin or Keaton movie.
I:74;127;If you enjoy comedy this movie is for you.
I:74;128;The Marx brothers bring you a surplus of belly laughs.
I:74;129;Enjoyable viewing for young and old.
I:74;130;Despite the fact that this film is over 70 years old, it is still absolutely hilarious, and one of the greatest comedies ever made.
I:74;131;Its pointed satire on war, idiotic government, and idiotic people is still potent, and probably always will be.
I:74;132;It is only 70 minutes long, but it has more laughs than 10 modern comedies combined.
I:74;133;i love the Marx brother's movies and this one is my favorite.
I:74;134;"the movie has in it among other marvelous routines the famous and often duplicated ""mirror scene""."
I:74;135;the musical number that follows the declaration of war is a joy.
I:74;136;This sublime masterpiece is funny , innovative , ridiculous , outrageous , savage , silly and caustic .
I:74;137;Four brothers each one with his own profile make it possible the corporeity of this symphony in gagtime orchestrated by one man and performed by a whole army .
I:74;138;specially the ravishing presence of Zepp , who despite his straight character is perhaps the most important part of the team .
I:74;139;"He was an expert gagman (remember the mirror sequence 
I:74;140;Leo Mc Carey present the Marx Brothers in their best , purest and most consistent and imaginative work , which meant a real delivery of nonstop series of gags over this film breakneck seventy minutes .
I:74;141;So if you state the world in that age the metaphor is overclear .
I:74;142;And that triggers one of those famous puns that will live forever and ever through eternity.
I:74;143;I have got a good mind to join the club and beat you over the head with it.
I:74;144;That's deep, profound, inspired, admirable, isn't it.
I:74;145;And since we are on that line, the line of compassion, sympathy and empathy, meditate on this one.
I:74;146;But the answer of the newly appointed Roman tyrant is astounding.
I:74;147;When the creative intelligentsia of a country is able to bring together in one of their comedies both racist remarks and anti.
I:74;148;The western world, when they do things in the bloody line, they know how to inundate the earth and the soil and the fields with good warm human blood and fertilize the crops with hot human ashes.
I:74;149;But that was many light years ahead of their antics.
I:74;150;Duck Soup by the Marx Brothers is probably the best comedy ever produced.
I:74;151;I doubt it, because this film is funny after repeat viewings.
I:74;152;full of laughs and lampoons.
I:74;153;This is high praise, indeed in the 21st century.
I:74;154;stop freneticism, as well as some of their best gags, slapstick, and one.
I:74;155;liners, including the lemonade seller confrontation and the mirror pantomime, make this movie such a classic.
I:74;156;Duck Soup really showcases the best of the zaniness, acerbity and jaundiced eye the Marx Bros. approached their comedy with.
I:74;157;Margaret Dumont is at the top of her game as their foil and the country of Freedonia is genius.
I:74;158;the boys are aided to a great extent by a brilliantly witty script provided by songwriters Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, with contributions from Arthur Sheekman and Nat Perrin (who wrote the Marx Brothers' radio sitcom Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel, adapting many of its best gags to the Duck Soup script), all held together exceptionally well by the improvisational.
I:74;159;"with so many great scenes
I:74;160;"You won't see Chico and Harpo's piano and harp solos here, but you do get a good dose of Groucho's eccentric singing and dancing, as well as his wonderful ""love scenes"" with That Woman, the eternal dowager, the exceptionally, note."
I:74;161;timers did it here, and indeed how contemporary a lot of Marx Brothers humour actually is (Can you name a single comedian today who is as totally original, completely nuts, and somehow lovable as Harpo Marx?
I:74;162;"Marx humor was forever after wonderfully bizarre, improvisational, and strangely beautiful in its glowing originality: the type of thing that could only have developed over years and years of wild, wicked experimentation on the live stage and thankfully preserved forever on film
I:74;163;liners and sight gags coming at you so fast, this wallow in pure Marx Brothers is sure to make you laugh and laugh.
I:74;164;Hail, Hail, Marx Brothers, Duck Soup is their.
I:74;165;time classic, and the Marx Brothers' best.
I:74;166;Quoting from it liberally will earn you a spot among the cognoscenti as well.
I:74;167;The slapstick and humor of these movies is what generated the Loony Tunes humor we grew up on.
I:74;168;i highly recommend this movie as a beginner's introduction to the Marx Brothers .
I:74;169;deep into their brand of humor.
I:74;170;If you keep a sharp ear peeled for the one.
I:74;171;liners and you appreciate the subtlety mixed with the slapstick, you'll find a real gem.
I:74;172;The Marx Brothers were perhaps the funniest performers to ever appear in American film and Duck Soup, directed by Leo McCarey who had a far greater talent for comedy than their previous director Sam Wood ( You cannot make a directer out of Wood, as one of them .
I:74;173;once quipped), is their funniest film.
I:74;174;As usual, nobody seems to know what to do with Zeppo but they seem happy to have him around.
I:74;175;Anyway, this film contains many classic bits that will be familiar to fans of the Marx Brothers and comedy in general.
I:74;176;Though all have been endlessly redone by imitators, they all remain hilarious in the hands of the originals.
I:74;177;Along with Groucho and Chico's vaudevillian wordplay, this film also contains Harpo at his most wild.
I:74;178;It is this film that firmly establishes the central Marx Brothers relationship .
I:74;179;a relic from a previous age), the film ultimately builds up to Groucho declaring war on his enemies.
I:74;180;It also shows that the humor of the Marx Brothers was, for all of its seeming elitism and disregard for all other sensibilities, a truly populist expression.
I:74;181;A classic film and, most importantly, proof that wild comedy need not be stupid comedy.
I:74;182;Over half a century later, new audiences have finally realized the sheer brilliance and downright brutal nature this film has to offer.
I:74;183;felt presentation, recognizing themes of oppression, anti.
I:74;184;war ideals, injustice, greed, etc. and injecting such with biting humor.
I:74;185;Such scenes, like the mirror sequence, must have been hell on the crew as well as the actors, and the final result is a very entertaining, very majestic classic which parallel's even the finest pictures regardless of genre.
I:74;186;Got this as a gift for my husband's sister and was suprised to see how good the condition was good product for the price.
I:74;187;The leader of the neighboring country sends intelligence agents (Chico and Harpo) into Freedonia to keep an eye on Firefly.
I:74;188;Hum. . . Harpo and Chico are intelligence agents. . . how's that for a spin on military intelligence?
I:74;189;Then again, Groucho once said that Military intelligence is to intelligence what military music is to music.
I:74;190;Groucho shoots his own men (and then covers it up: Here's $5. . . Keep it under your hat.
I:74;191;Better yet, keep it under mine ), Secretary of War Chico joins the other side because the food is better there, and Harpo is combing the countryside (battlefield) for recruits.
I:74;192;The slap stick humor is done with a style that can only be accomplished by the Marx Brothers.
I:74;193;The mirror scene is a classic Hal Roach silent movie bit. . . possibly done by Chaplain, I believe.
I:74;194;It is a Great comedy classic.
I:74;195;As a matter of fact, it was recently voted one of the top ten comedy movies of the 20th century.
I:74;196;So, go out a own a piece of history!
I:74;197;I alway LOVE the Marx brothers.
I:74;198;the scenes with the popcorn vendor are priceless, as well as the multiple Groucho scene .
I:74;199;DUCK SOUP is the second movie of the Marx Brothers that I have seen, and I thought it was wonderful.
I:74;200;Made in 1933, it was sure to have all the wonderful pieces of a great, old time movie, and it did.
I:74;201;groucho Marx stars as the leader of Freedonia, who is superb at his funny and fast.
I:74;202;and they also do a wonderful job through the rest of the show.
I:74;203;besides that, the war scenes were wonderful, the special effects wonderful, and the setting great.
I:74;204;So here we have what is arguably one of the best from The Marx Brothers in their heyday.
I:74;205;"I'll let others address the movie in traditional ""reviewer"" outlines and just let you know what this film means to me."
I:74;206;Once I got over the pain in my ribs from laughing so hard over things I didn't see as a kid, I realized, like many of my contemporaries, this movie was an hilarious and penetrating anti.
I:74;207;fire dialogue, theyre sure to enjoy the physical humor and prevailing sense of anarchy.
I:74;208;On one level a biting denunciation of war and fascism, the movie also stands as one of the screen's top comedies.
I:74;209;The zanniness, the quirkiness, the pure anarchy of this are all so wonderful.
I:74;210;this is a movie well worth seeing, and if you like it the first time I gurrantee you'll like it again and again.
I:74;211;There is a reason why this is labled as one of the funniest movies of all time.
I:74;212;The styles of humor used in this movie are timeless.
I:74;213;day comedians like Jim Carrey and Tom Green.
I:74;214;It is fast moving, visually and verbally ingenious comedy.
I:74;215;It is a short and sweet pep up that must be experienced on a periodic basis.
I:74;216;Nothing has beat it yet, almost a century later.
I:74;217;You'll have to watch this film to truly experience the greatness of their comedic genius.
I:74;218;These two are excellent four.
I:74;219;This film has Groucho giving many of his best one.
I:74;220;Chico, although giving no piano performances, has excellent scenes, too, with taht excellent mock Italian accent.
I:74;221;There is a brilliant comedy sketch in which Chico and Harpo disguise themselves as Groucho in order to fool Margaret Dumont to get ahold the plans for war with a rival country.
I:74;222;There is a neat mirror sequence where no one spekas for about five minutes.
I:74;223;Magnificent, triumphant, and neatly shot war sequence which is the climax of the picture in which Groucho appears puzzingly in so many uniforms.
I:74;224;Top 10 funny film of all time!
I:74;225;esque accent and virtuoso piano playing skills, Harpo's side splitting dialogue.
I:74;226;less humor and props also ironically an effortlessly incredible harp player, and the sometimes member Zeppo who often portrays the bachelor or the average guy, who his brothers would always torment in any way they can.
I:74;227;Duck Soup is the foundation of comedy in cinema.
I:74;228;What is obviously a parody of modern 1930's high society and American politics, Duck Soup is the Citizen Kane of comedies and has a high re.
I:74;229;If you like the Max brothers, you will like this one.
I:74;230;if you've never seen a Marx brothers movie,this is a good one to start out with.
I:74;231;You willneed to like slapstick comedy to enjoy it.
I:74;232;If you need a laugh, the Mard Brothers will always provide it.
I:74;233;Truly the best Marx Brothers movie.
I:74;234;A brilliant combination of their typical humor while still poking with satire at government and it's functions.
I:74;235;Truly war, in the able hands of the Marx group, becomes hilarious.
I:74;236;as always, Groucho manages to be hysterical.
I:74;237;Chico is quite funny and Harpo pratfalls.
I:74;238;Zeppo is always excellent as what he was: straight man.
I:74;239;And speaking of that, the always marvelous Margeret Dumont is also here.
I:74;240;some brilliant sequences include, the spoof of thirties musicals(We're Going to War), the battle sequences, Harpo and Chico working over the salesman, the trial scenes, and one of the funniest scenes ever filmed: the brilliant mirror routine.
I:74;241;In short, one of the funniest movies ever made.
I:74;242;It is definitely the best (and last) Marx Brothers movie with Zeppo, for what that is worth.
I:74;243;"
I:74;244;Duck Soup was helped by several factors.
I:74;245;The Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby screenplay does one of the better jobs of integrating the various comic routines into the overall story.
I:74;246;And, as always, please remember that the correct pronunciation of Leonard's stage name is Chick.
I:74;247;"The term ""duck soup"" means something that is incredibly easy."
I:74;248;In Duck Soup, Groucho Marx takes comedy which seems to be easy, but is actually quite talented in its slapstick and its double meanings.
I:74;249;Duck Soup certainly did the trick.
I:74;250;It's a political satire that talks about how men woo women for their money, how countries switch sides as it becomes convenient, how people are overlooked because of the way they look or act.
I:74;251;there are a lot of fun gags in here, from the famous mirror scene to the confused.
I:74;252;By the end of the movie they are going full wild with every military costume known to mankind and over the top gags.
I:74;253;"Through all of it is the reminder that war isn't exactly sane and that people can get riled up if the ""conductor"" knows how to play them right."
I:74;254;certainly the movie is meant to be light.
I:74;255;"Little kids under the age of 10 will hoot in delight as the ""mirror images"" dance with each other."
I:74;256;still, sometimes that's how comedy can shine.
I:74;257;It can draw all ages in with its light message, and get them to absorb the underlying conversation while they're there.
I:74;258;Incredible that one family would have four comedy stars (actually three .
I:74;259;I loved watching Groucho's quiz show many years ago and all their movies.
I:74;260;"Though I love ""A Day at the Races"" (there's something very sweet about it), and many of their films from the 1930s, ""Duck Soup"" is my favorite."
I:74;261;There are more lines of wit and irreverence here than in perhaps any other film .
I:74;262;Groucho is in top form, and the plot is everywhere (a good thing) from the classic mirror sequence, to Harpo in bed with his horse, to Freedonia basically going to war for the hell of it(!)
I:74;263;I was browsing some lists of Best Comedies of All Time, and this one popped up on more than a several.
I:74;264;I know the Stooges, on the whole, are a dumber, more violent group of comedians, but I also liked them more as people.
I:74;265;I know I'm making a fine point here.
I:74;266;the unstoppable jerk is often a staple in entertainment .
I:74;267;but this movie is pretty much based on their unstoppable jerk.
I:74;268;But there are also quite a few that are absolutely brilliant.
I:74;269;Enough to make me pause the movie until I'm laughed out.
I:74;270;Duck Soup remains an excellent example of the fast paced screwball comedies of its time.
I:74;271;The Marx Brothers, Margaret Dumont and the rest of the cast turn in convincing performances for this story of two countries that may not always get along very well.
I:74;272;The timing is excellent and this helps the comedy along, too.
I:74;273;The war scenes offer many opportunities for the Marx Brothers to do the comedy that only they can do best.
I:74;274;The slapstick scenes with the peanut and lemonade vendors show amazing forethought and meticulous attention to the details of exactly how each actor must behave in order to make the scenes funny.
I:74;275;the cinematography remains solid throughout the picture.
I:74;276;"The characters are framed nicely within the screen
I:74;277;The scenes in which Firefly presents himself to the wealthy aristocrats of Freedonia demonstrate excellent choreography as well.
I:74;278;overall, this Marx Brothers picture remains one of their finest efforts.
I:74;279;Oh sure, some gags work better than others, but I agree with people who write that this picture offers us an excellent introduction to the four Marx Brothers.
I:74;280;The actors give convincing performances and you will laugh out loud all throughout the movie.
I:74;281;"there will never be another comedy team as brilliant as The Marx Brothers were
I:74;282;People who enjoy slapstick screwball comedies from the years of early Hollywood will also love this film.
I:74;283;this is as good as it gets!!
I:74;284;the greatest ever marx brothers movie!!
I:74;285;This is a FANTASTIC movie .
I:74;286;The motorcycle and sidecar gags alone are worth the price of admission.
I:74;287;One of the best anti.
I:74;288;types, make it thoroughly enjoyable.
I:74;289;the Declaration of War is an outstanding highlight, especially when the boys use the military helmets as instruments.
I:74;290;it is a movie that has stood the test of time (nearly 70 years) and sounds as funny and fresh as if it were made but recently.
I:74;291;a very funny, sardonic, movie
I:74;292;Too often these days are the Marx Brothers overlooked as one of THE main influences of modern comedy.
I:74;293;They set comedy standards, copied and used by everyone during their time, as well as today, in every effort made during their long careers.
I:74;294;sharp wit (often adlibbed during the actual filming of their movies.
I:74;295;man delivery, his twisting and turning of phrases, and his talents at the keyboard.
I:74;296;gag and mime (not to mention his incredible prowess, and superb execution on the harp!)
I:74;297;The bros are fun to watch, to say the least!
I:74;298;You can see it in any one of their films!This film is a joy for all of the aforementioned reasons!
I:74;299;Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo pull out all of the stops in this, one of their very best films.
I:74;300;"DUCK SOUP,"" a pointed political satire, is pure comic genius, and one of the Marx Brothers' funniest, and most insane efforts, containing many of the Brothers' famous sequences: the lemonade stand scene (a masterpiece of ""slow burn."")"
I:74;301;"
I:74;302;directed romp has achieved its proper reputation as the quintessential Marx Brothers classic!
I:74;303;If you've never seen a Marx Brothers film, and you want to giggle and laugh your posterior off.
I:74;304;Duck Soup is a masterpiece.
I:74;305;If you're a comedy film buff, you simply must see this one.
I:74;306;And it was nice to see the handsome Zeppo.
I:74;307;This is an absolute classic.
I:74;308;DUCK SOUP is the most famous and arguably the best of all the Marx Bros.' movies, though audiences at the time of its release were confused and disappointed.
I:74;309;But the comedy sketches are unforgettable, and the audience is treated to one unforgettable, side.
I:74;310;"Groucho said many of his best lines here
I:74;311;"Much has been made of the political satire present in this movie
I:74;312;time comedy classic, but the truth is that these days, far more people have seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail than any of the great Marx Bros. movies.
I:74;313;There is some brilliant moments in Duck Soup and there are some not so brilliant moments, I enjoy crazy but I like it better written as in Thorogood's crazy books in the Bigfoot Littlefoot and West series.
I:74;314;suffice to say that this is a classic comedy that will suit a limited audience.
I:74;315;Look carefully at his manner, especially during the early stages of the film.
I:74;316;time Marx viewer it is the thing that surprised me most of all.
I:74;317;Many of the jokes were still funny.
I:74;318;The acting was atrocious, as was all acting in those days, but the brothers were brilliant.
I:74;319;The Marx brothers are a very funny group and this movie contains some really special moments particularly the mirror routine one of their finest.
I:74;320;How this movie is rated one of the top 5 comedies of all time is beyond me.
I:74;321;still any film with Groucho and Margaret Dumont attacking the English language is a treat to the eyes and mind.
I:74;322;"The greatest comedy troup of all time
I:74;323;Start with Groucho and his acerbic wit.
I:74;324;Chico offers the role of the person who finds new ways to mangle the English Language and misinterpret whatever you tell him.
I:74;325;The way they play off each other is fantastic.
I:74;326;This is humor that can be appreciated by all ages.
I:74;327;com and received it on Mon Feb 09 09 via USPS.
I:74;328;Great service from Amazon,cosmo_a_good_name_2_know and the USPS.
I:74;329;Everything was done very well.
I:74;330;Of all the comedy acts in the history of film, the Marx Brothers are my favorite.
I:74;331;This is almost universally regarded as the Marx Brothers best film, and I would agree with that, while qualifying it.
I:74;332;probably the earliest talking film that is still widely watched, it definitely has some nice moments.
I:74;333;awesome sketches, and has the boys at their anarchic best and contains many, many famous lines.
I:74;334;"the first half is extraordinary
I:74;335;loads of fun, more great skits, but, again, musical numbers and romantic intrigue that just gets in the way of the nuttiness.
I:74;336;their last first rate movie is, again, harmed by romance and music.
I:74;337;The dance numbers and romantic scenes are opportunities to run and get something to drink, or a chance to rush to the restroom.
I:74;338;Did filmgoers in the 1930s enjoy the non.
I:74;339;This is one of the funniest movies ever made and I believe the Marx Brothers finest movies.
I:74;340;Still, as in all Marx Brothers movies, there are some fantastic comic scenes.
I:74;341;"Even great scenes like the famous mirror bit lack
I:74;342;His antics with Edgar Kennedy are hilarious and make this movie worth watching multiple times.
I:74;343;Franklin D. Roosevelt.1933's Duck Soup is Marxism at its best, and seems to be a fine Marxist send.
I:74;344;Rufus T's ginned up fight with Sylvania was zany.
I:74;345;Director Leo McCarey dispenses with the extra baggage and focuses on nonstop anarchy in this classic political satire.
I:74;346;This is one of the funniest comedy I've ever seen.
I:74;347;And I've seen lots of comedies.
I:74;348;"I debated over which Marx Brothers movies are the funniest and I believe this one and ""A Night at the Opera"" run neck."
I:74;349;This one has enough witty lines and gags to keep you in stitches.
I:74;350;All kinds of hiliarious mayhem hit the fan on both sides.
I:74;351;"some of the funniest lines is when Mrs. Teasdale greets Firefly in the Freedonia meeting hall as he enters: Mrs. Teasdale: ""As chairman of the reception committee, I welcome you with open arms."""
I:74;352;"Chicolini: ""I'll tell you what I'll do: I'll take five and ten in Woolworth."""
I:74;353;Duck Soup is one of the classic rammed.
I:74;354;For me, I prefer the slapstick of Woody Allen's earlier films, but the Marx brothers are well up there as classic comic producers of all time, so who am I to say.
I:74;355;I just found lines such as: 'Keep it under your hat, no, tell you what, I'll keep it under my hat' didn't ring many comedic cherries.
I:74;356;I think this picture was very acceptable and the sound near excellent for pre.
I:74;357;"this movie, along with ""a night at the opera"", are the two best marx bros movies and two of the best comedies of all time."
I:74;358;it will surely put a smile on your face!
I:74;359;ending piano piece, and Harpo doing what he does best .
I:74;360;"stick comedy there is a plot
I:74;361;"this gets so surreal you'll spit up laughing)
I:74;362;Priceless, timeless and always watchable.
I:74;363;Very well we'll take up new business.
I:74;364;Duck Soup is Marx Brothers comedy at its finest.
I:74;365;The satire is sharp, the physical comedy is perfectly timed, and the quips come fast and furious.
I:74;366;Groucho is hilarious as the reckless and incompetent leader of Freedonia and Harpo Marx and Chico Marx are terrific as a pair of bumbling spies.
I:74;367;The supporting cast is filled with good sports with Dumont, Louis Calhern, and Edgar Kennedy turning in some great work as the victims of the Brothers' humor.
I:74;368;You get nutty musical numbers (some of which you need to read up on to understand the nuances of), fine physical comedy (the two scenes Harpo and Chico do with the lemonade vendor are instant classics), and the film is well known for its nutty mirror scene.
I:74;369;"Harpo is less funny in this film, as his humor is all spoken and is often rude and flippant
I:74;370;The plot is zany .
I:74;371;One of the film's funnier points is often overlooked .
I:74;372;it's a fascinating story about how the film initially wasn't popular at all, but has come to be regarded as the greatest of the Marx Brothers films.
I:74;373;Groucho undeservingly gets put in a position of prime importance by a rich widow and two bums are around that always seem to get in his way.
I:74;374;Firefly somehow manages to win the war though, even though for a while he unknowingly shoots at his own men.
I:74;375;Here are some great highlights from the film:.
I:74;376;"I still think ""A Night at the Opera"" is better."
I:74;377;this classic comedy bridges the gap between stage play and blockbuster.
I:74;378;duck Soup is a movie that tells a serious story in a very humorous way.
I:74;379;that is the genius behind this old fashion gem.
I:74;380;Duck Soup is one of the funniest movies ever made.
I:74;381;anyhow, Duck Soup is an absolutely hilarious film.
I:74;382;Full of excellent dialogue and very clever humour, it will have you in stitches everytime.
I:74;383;this movie has the most hillarious comedy has a nice plot.You will never stop laughing.
I:74;384;A day at the Races is above it for Marxisms as the Rockies above the endless plains.
I:74;385;and best of all, Margaret Dumont returns after a two film absence.
I:74;386;to play the kind of high society snob the Marx Bros. love to hate, and make fun of, brilliantly so.
I:74;387;Yet it has stood the test of time, and still stands as one of their best, if not their best, films.
I:74;388;I had always know that this film is one of the greatest comedies ever made and after seeing it for the first time, words cannot even describe how amazing this film was.
I:74;389;It makes me feel like I have been a Marx Bros. fan from the very beginning because Spielberg truly modeled the style of humor that the Marx Bros had and channeled it to these incredible animated characters decades later.
I:74;390;Groucho Marx is in peak form, and some viewers may notice where Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce got some of his antics for the MASH television series.
I:74;391;by all means, give your kids a hefty dose of humor and some cinematic history at the same time!
I:74;392;"The wacky ""Duck Soup"" is often viewed as the ultimate Marx Brothers movie and it's certainly their most outrageous in terms of the humor of the film and a great political satire as well."
I:74;393;This is, like the previous version, the original theatrical version.
I:74;394;universal used the most readily available best film source at the time when they first released this in 2004.
I:74;395;"A five star movie with a less than five star presentation ""Duck Soup"" manages to hold up remarkably well 70 plus years on."
I:74;396;Watch this movie and you will see the archetypes of most of the movie and TV comedy Schtick we go ape over today.
I:74;397;well, Zeppo may be a bit blah, but there has to be a straight man somewhere, and the Marx brothers keep it in the family.
I:74;398;"watch this one (own it, really) and then view Peter Sellers in ""The Mouse That Roared."""
I:74;399;"Both are absolutely hilarious movie comedy classics, but I'll be surprised if you don't come away thinking that ""Duck Soup"" edges out ""The Mouse"", even though its decades older."
I:74;400;And, since you'll want to see it again and again over the years, you just have to own it.
I:74;401;And, as always, Amazon's delivery and price is unbeatable.
I:74;402;How many of today's comedies will still be loved in 80 years?
I:74;403;but here are the Marx brothers, as well loved today in 2013 as when 'Duck Soup' came out in 1933.
I:74;404;sounding dialect humor, Margaret Dumont's straight.
I:74;405;and, it's still safe for kids.
