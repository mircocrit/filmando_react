1;Fight Club is a metaphor for embracing our humanity, in all its gory glory, in the face of crushing modern pressures to settle for sterilty and comfort instead.
2;It's been a ride ever since.

4;It made me rate the movie from 4 to 5 stars.
5;The whole ending was just amazing.
6;This movie was remarkably well done.
7;It's hard to say much about it without ruining the movie, so the best I can say is that it is a wild ride that takes you through the life of a person at his breaking point.

38;Fantastic movie based on a fantastic book.
39;wise), but all the changes were good adaptations to the media difference.
40;Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both play their characters perfectly.
41;is an essential starting point for understanding the perspective of this film.
42;I want you to go on to picture the enlightenment .
43;ok, i must admit that this is a good movie.
44;the actors are excellent, and the amazing direction by david fincher is just that.
45;the movie barely touched on these issues.
46;the movie was a thriller that surprised us at the end.
47;the movie really butchered many scenes, and excluded some really important plot details.
48;the book has much testosterone as well, but it is more important to the plot.
49;i recommend reading the book after seeing the movie to see what i mean.
50;The Video Transfer of This Film is Simply Amazing, And The Sound Is also Great.
51;Sound picture are excellent, but that's to be expected.
52;depth look at the filmmaking process.
53;It also makes good use of the angle and audio button on you remote, (yes, those two .
54;All other features, notably the public service announcments, are very good.
55;If you like movies with a twist, this movie is a perfect match.
56;The well known actors do a phenomenal job and if you have not seen this movie, you are missing out!
57;This is probably up there in the top 100 movies of all time.
58;Its in my personal top 5.
59;True, it wasn't a movie where they go around beating people up, but there was a good amount of harddcore fighting.
60;Yet, it also managed to keep an incredibly interesting plot throughout, with a surprise ending as good as that in the sixth sense.
61;Yet, on top of all taht, it's funny!
62;Yes, there are some truly funny parts in this movie.
63;Fight Club is the best picture of the year.
64;Most films of this nature never receive immediate praise, but become classics nonetheless.
65;David Fincher is quickly becoming one of the best directors we have.
66;It is great to see that someone's not afraid to take risks in film.
67;Also, Edward Norton is fantastic
68;He's real, interesting, and fun to watch.
69;This film does have an odd twist, which I'll admit, is tough to swallow, but if you show patience (and an open mind) Fight Club will certainly pay off.
70;After watching this on FX, I absolutely loved it!
71;I recommend this film to any David Fincher fan.
72;The best reason I can think of to see this movie is just the fact that you've never seen anything else like it.
73;more to the point, Fight Club is simply brilliant.
74;Brilliant that is, for the right audience.
75;the film moves so fast, you need to see it twice to take it all in.
76;Excellent acting, superb dialogue, incredible direction (David Fincher is one of the up and coming BEST in the business), and, finally, it's FUNNY.
77;It may not be for everyone, but if you want a good, unique, intelligent and bumpy ride, give it a look.
78;It is better understood the second time around.
79;Just give this movie a chance.
80;but give it a chance.
81;Steller performances and a great job filming make this movie one of my best.
82;It's such a great movie and there is so much going on that I could write pages on it.
83;But I'll do my best to keep it short.
84;In my opinion this is one of the best movies, not just of our time, but of all times.
85;The story is so full of political, social, and philosophical statements and themes, and there is so much going on in every scene that you can't just watch it once or twice or even three times.
86;To start with we have one of the best directors of his generation: David Fincher.
87;I've no doubt that he'll one day take his place among the greats: Hitchcock and Kubrick.
88;It has two of the best living actors, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, who so fit their character that it is easy to forget that they are not Tyler Durden and Jack.
89;carter is heartbreaking in this movie.
90;The set design, wardrobe, and special effects are spectacular, but without overshadowing the story itself.
91;This movie ranks with Citizen Kane, North By Northwest, and the Star Wars trilogy as the best movies of all times.
92;First of all whoever designed the packaging did a brilliant job.
93;Disc One contains four commentaries.
94;The first is David Fincher alone, and his commentary puts so much insight into the film you have to watch it again immediately after the commentary.
95;The third commentary is the novelist, Chuck Palahniuk, and screenwriter Jim Uhls.
96;And it is especially nice to hear Palahniuk's take on the movie.
97;The final commentary contains five important members of production.
98;all in all this is a smart movie that everyone should watch (and let's not forget, this movie is hilarious).
99;Every single moment of this film is extrodinary.
100;Edward norton is the best actor out now.
101;I recommend you guys to get this movie.
102;I just watched this movie for the first time and I loved it!
103;The movie came looking like I just bought it from a store and it worked wonderful.
104;While in 'Fight Club', on the other hand the ending is seemingly happy .
105;The fighting and action was crazy, but watchable.
106;Edward Norton is a very good actor, and he's so damn cute.
107;He has a great scene, where His Boss Enters the room, and he starts to kick his own butt.
108;I loved the character He played.
109;She was quite intriguing to say the least.
110;Now it has move from the basements on to the surface, a full army packed with a lot of soap and a solid Idealistic view of human life.
111;Mundane existence and the hunter essential gathering of sh., they don't need, those are their essential enemies, also the life style of the rich and famous but, that's another story.
112;the audacious and keen artisan, David Fincher, narrates with a fine eye and straight style the anarchical story written by Chuck Palahniuk, of this underground fighting clubs, and how its individuals develops a revolution of idealistic breakthrough, towards self freedom.
113;Of course, Palahniuk takes it to the extremes, and Fincher portraits it with humor and deep understanding of its concept and message.
114;Brad Pitt as the anthological Tyler Durden, brings credibility and force to this character, a very good performance, Edward Norton as The Narrator (also known as Cornelius, Travis, and other stupid names), conveys both fragility and moral strength to his excellent work, both actors and the director as a team are simply magnificent.
115;Helena Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf are great two.
116;an accurate and psychologically intone photography adds a lot to the film's content, also the excellent music by the Dust Brothers, brings more humor to the humoristic scenes and more power to the Fight and moral exposure scenes.
117;The premise of the film is pretty simple, no one talks about Fight club etc.
118;The violence is somewhat brutual but hey Pitt's body is nice to look at.
119;Good movie but not a masterpiece.
120;WOW, what a kick in the teeth, interesting, and fast moving journey into one man's mind.
121;The path this movie takes is fantastic.
122;norton and Pitt are perfectly cast, and supported by a crew of fight club members that make for a well.
123;al. are great in support as the members/followers of the leads.
124;Helena Bonham Carter has the only real female role in this film and is perfectly cast.
125;Unconventional, with a great twist at the end, the whole movie kept me on the edge of my seat.
126;In the end, I would just classify this as a great film.
127;If you saw it once, see it again.
128;It has a major twist at the end and a fair amount of action, but it is Tyler Durden's outlook on life and quotes that really make this movie.
129;This movie is one of my top ten favourite movies, I love the way every character in the movie performs.
130;There are many of us out there who enjoy a movie for entertainment's sake, and do not wish to use our over.
131;In life we become so concerned with what we own and how much we make
132;Fight Club beautifully portrays a decaying society, and in the process throughly entertains the viewer.
133;Then came The Game, a disappointment, but with the intriguing premise of a bottled.
134;up and unemotional man who in the course of his nightmarish game learns to live again.
135;This is also Fincher's first literary adaptation.
136;Fight Club comes to us via the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk.
137;ordered furniture, and a respectable position in a firm, yet he feels like he is missing out on life.
138;This bonding and emotional intimacy leads to catharsis and release, especially when he weeps between Bob's ample breasts.
139;things are moving along great.
140;Norton stays with Durden and the two continue to pummel each other.
141;as with anything purely physical (and make no mistake that is exactly what it is) Durden decides to up the ante a tad and create a full.
142;Fight Club is technically brilliant.
143;Brave and stylistic, Fincher plays with our tale being told by Norton's narrator.
144;Durden explaining his story is hilarious and twisted.
145;The energy is infectious and the acting by all the principles, especially Norton and Carter are top.
146;ray transfer comes out very well.
147;this is in my top five of all.
148;Honestly one of best movies I've seen and one of my personal favourites but first rule is you don't talk about it
149;The best movie of it's genre.
150;With a high powered acting ensemble, you are taken on an amazing ride inside the head of an over worked sales rep. in the end it is a story about burn out and wanting to stop everything to start all over again.
151;FIGHT CLUB is one of those rare films that cannot be fully judged until several years from its release.
152;BLADE RUNNER was hugely influential and changed film in many ways.
153;It is the ultimate guy film.
154;I was fortunate enough to see this in the theater and I wish this had done better at the box office, because it deserved it.
155;Ed Norton and Brad Pitt do career work here, as well as Helena Bonham.
156;David Fincher has crafted a masterpiece of timing and precision.
157;They are incapable of expressing themselves in other ways.
158;It just shows how it honestly is.
159;As the box set says, it is the first film of the new millennium.
160;love it or hate it, FIGHT CLUB is required viewing for anyone who considers themselves a film fan.
161;Brad Pitt and Ed Norton have great chemistry.
162;but Fight Club forces the viewer at the very least to challenge his or her own thought process, in a clever, visceral, sometimes outrageous way.
163;there are so many amazing aspects about this film that its hard to pin this one down or that one.
164;the great supporting cast that includes Helena Bonham Carter as a support group tourist and Meat Loaf as a guy with, er, breasts, in his best role since Rocky Horror.
165;See the movie, be impressed by how a Hollywood film can actually break the odds and actually mean something greater than the sum of its parts.
166;I had gotten this for a gift for a friend and they already have it, so i kept it.
167;Someone please let me know.
168;The rich story full of twists and turns matched perfectly by Edward Norton's narration makes this film into a artistic masterpiece.
169;This is a must see for any movie fan.
170;most people don't think the same, but i believe that this one it's an original never seen before movie.
171;It's visually and styilistically impressive.
172;There are many great shots, like when the main charecter is seen walking through a catalouge, or the entertainment brought by the icey cavern and the penguin who encourages Norton to slide!
173;And the sciript is full of great lines, like tyler's well done prophesy of the new world orderHowever, the film falls on some levels.
174;And the film just has a somewhat, iwrong/i feel to it, in an indescribable way.
175;Of course, that could have been what they soughtHowever the style of the film is great.
176;The film is one of the best ones that I've seen, and possiblily the best postmodern film and novel that's out there.
177;The film will surprise you in the end.
178;Fight Club is the type of film that provokes two types of reactions, the first one being that you have just enjoyed the last two hours immensely, and the second being that underneath the facade of seemingly mindless amd gratuitous violence, there lies a luminiscent core which ultimately constitutes a witty and incisive satirical of modern life.
179;fight Club is engrossing, humourous, thrilling, raw and primal
180;And while it goes along with this task, it is vastly entertaining.
181;The movie grips you from the start and maintains its hold until the ending, which, while I'm at it, is actually quite a stunner.
182;the chemistry between the two protagonists, acted to perfection by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, is very appealling, and the antithesis of what they fight for is personified by the character Marla, who serves to turn this film into a neat, contrasted and well.
183;The director ensures that the film is immensely watchable during the whole 2 hour excursion, and when the end comes, it leaves a puzzling yet strangely attractive aftertaste which eventually causes coagulates into the realisation that Fight Club is a great movie.
184;It is the definitive edition of a superb film that, while not soaring to the great heights attained by the best films of the 90s, manages to reassure us of Hollywood's capability for manufacturing something that is worth watching for what it is.
185;Ever saw happy and content people living their meaningful lifes?
186;Let me translate it for you.
187;In human language it means .
188;I love my home so much!
189;it's affordable, sensible and contemporary.
190;It will take you years to learn the right moves.
191;what is so charismatic about Brad Pitt's pissing.
192;Want to share a room with her and listen to that .
193;Fight Club guides you where the real excitement is.
194;No one is strong and wise enough to be above .
195;and the touch of conspiracy theory is added, the much.
196;one of the funniest things is the club's franchising at it's branding stage.
197;are you willing to contribute your time and cash?
198;Although I have seen it hundreds of times and know the outcome, still get on the edge of my seat.
199;Now that I got on blu.
200;ray, it is even better.
201;The story is very clever and has a great ending.
202;The special FX are some of the best I have seen to date, and the 2nd disc with extra features on is very interesting.
203;Pretty much the best Guy movie ever made (my opinion).
204;Durden is everything this man isn't, attractive, charismatic, muscular.
205;Artistically, this movie is astounding, making use of brilliant visual effects.
206;THe actors are talented and David Fincher is an incredible director.
207;The four commentaries are brilliant as well.
208;This shockingly honest, brutal movie will suck you in until it finishes.
209;It tells the truth about the meaningless existence of the average person, and the end will hit you harder than if you were a member of the club.
210;Not only that, but it is hilarious, too.
211;Yup, wow pretty much explains it.
212;You're actually drawn to the main character and its very easy to become completely involved with the movie.
213;Though stylish and well crafted, it would be hard to find a more disingenuous, manipulative, and hideous movie than Fight Club.
214;Imagine a film that showed beautiful people eating a fabulous, decadent meal, savoring every luscious mouthful .
215;inspiring hypocrisy of Fight Club, a film that purports to be a cautionary tale about violence but is in fact a tutorial in it.
216;the basic premise, that urban man has lost touch with his inner Neanderthal, is an interesting one, and would have served as the basis of a good movie.
217;a much better movie) has certainly studied.
218;Kubrick's chilling adaptation of the Burgess novel came complete with skinheads, one of many similarities between the two works.
219;Beautiful, intricate, inventive filmmaking until the climax .
220;But still absolutely worth seeing for the knockout performances, great writing, awesome cinematography and ferocious momentum of the plot.
221;Skates brilliantly along the edge of reality .
222;down one one the best of 1999 (along with Election and The Limey).
223;It is also one of the most sophisticated movies to come out of Hollywood in years.
224;norton's character is an existential shell of a man, living in a Pottery Barn apartment, and spending his free time checking out the self help circuit just to connect with the outside world.
225;so see this film, then see it again.
226;All of the acting is phenomenal, including Brad Pitt.
227;It's one of the few films of our generation that actually challenges the audience.
228;The overall plot and filmography of the movie was top notch.
229;The actors chosen portray the characters perfectly.
230;FIGHT CLUB is a tremendous movie.
231;first into the conclusion that it would be about some macho guys fighting to determine who was the most macho.
232;force he can only find peace by attending self.
233;On a business trip he meets Tyler Durden, an easy.
234;Another excellent job was done by Meatloaf.
235;I loved it, I loved being held hostage by it, and I am grateful to the artists who made it.
236;David Fincher is my favorite director.
237;If you walk talk and breathe and live in reality this is a must see!!!
238;The movie is well put together.
239;day conveniences and desires to live a posh lifestyle of wealth, self advancement, and comfort.
240;improvent and perfection shed light and warning on values of the American public.
241;Brad Pitt plays an excellent role.
242;One of his best acting performances I have ever seen.
243;it's nice to see a movie that doesn't pull its punches, and it was refreshing to see that this movie was nothing like what the title would imply.
244;the directing was fantastic, showing quite a bit more originality and creativity than that provided by a bed of rose petals, and the acting was spot.
245;and, oh yeah, I nearly peed myself, I laughed so hard.
246;This was just a fun, in.your.
247;As will all BD, the pic and audio is superior.
248;If you love this movie as much as I do, this is a must.
249;This is a real mind bending movie.
250;A real must see if you are into psychological films!
251;Call me crazy, but I consider Fight Club to be one of the greatest movies ever made.
252;I'll start off by saying that I am a girl, and this is definitely a guy movie.
253;And, even though I have never really liked Brad Pitt, I thought even he was perfect in this movie.
254;He plays Tyler Durden, the wild and crazy man Edward Norton's character meets on a plane.
255;disc set is all I could ever want and more: Great commentary by the director David Fincher, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, and there is even commentary by Chuck Palahniuk who wrote the novel the movie is based upon (I also recommend that you read that .
256;Plus there are a ton of deleted scenes, public.
257;I always tell them I love it because the acting is great, the mood of the film is great, it's funny, it's tragic, it's.
258;The movie was beautifully filmed, many scenes have a 'trippy' feel to them and I think you only really start to appreciate that the second time you watch the film.
259;The lead actors are incredible.
260;I am no fan of Brad Pitt, but he did a tremendous job.
261;Two discs worth of insane Fight Club goodness including 4.
262;Brilliantly shot, excellently acted, and wonderfully twisted.
263;This movie takes you on a gritty and surreal journey of a man's self.
264;Great extras and a really great movie overall.
265;I recommend it to everyone who loves a great movie with plot twists.
266;While the novel is more detailed, hollywood didnt change up the story very much to make it into a film.
267;The characters were perfectly portrayed by the actors, and the look of the film fits well with the gritty nature of the story.
268;This could be the best move ever.
269;It has a great natural flow.
270;Good acting, good story, good dialogue, good directing, good sets, good soundtrack.
271;This movie is a must see guy movie.
272;This is one of the best films I've seen in the last 15 years.
273;The surreal 'superficial violence' addiction that seems to capture the characters of the movie is simple and yet still shockingly powerful.
274;conscious state into an amazingly visceral and electrical feeling of living.
275;Just remember, the movie is not about fighting, it is about awakening and living your life in the here and now instead of the 'someday.'
276;I knew the plot since it is a classic, but that didn't detract from the story.
277;I enjoyed the acting and the mayhem.
278;I emailed customer service, as required, and they were supposed to get back to me within 12 hours.
279;Fight Club represents a virtuoso performance from all three of its principal actors (Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter), as well as in the cinematography and direction that transform it into a surreal experience more meaningful than a first glance might reveal.
280;Edward Norton is well know for the depth his brings to conflicted roles (Primal Fear, American History X), but the surprise here is in how effectively Pitt assumes a persona both supremely irreverant ( God hates you, he says at one point) and with the spiritual gravamen of Nietzche's Zarathustra.
281;Nietzche is a powerful spectre over the entire film, and the brilliant and diorienting skills of Jeff Cronenweth keep you from ever truly pinning down the truth.
282;but even as Fight Club examines questions that deal with the very soul of mankind, it still appeals to the casual viewer.
283;The mystery of the story envelops the viewer, drawing us into a seemingly normal life that rapidly spirals out of control into a mesmerizing sequence of revelation and epiphany.
284;Moreover, those squeamish of violence with enjoy this movie no more than Last of the Mohicans: a good movie with far more violence than this one.
285;but as long as you can take a little blood on your way to the ending, do indulge yourself in the brilliant tour de force.
286;consider it a philosophy lesson and rollicking trip at once.
287;The dark and compelling story is complemented perfectly by Pitt and Norton's acting and taken even further by Director Fincher's unique vision of the modern world.
288;If you are looking for a well made and well acted film that will provoke thought then this is for you.
289;In the tradition of Physcho , Magic and other nut films, this one ranks right up there with the best of them.
290;Fight Club, for many reasons, was one of the best films of 1999, and disappointingly overlooked.
291;Their roles are woven together incestuously as their characters are developed and unfolded through Fight Club.
292;Have I successfully avoided giving away the important bits of action and revelation?The most significant thing about Fight Club is how shakingly close to home the subject matter hits.
293;i was captivated by the anti.
294;hero, and although I obviously don't approve of his methods, a lot of what he had to say is true.
295;some parts were funny, some silly and many bloody and violent, this movie was well acted and I do recommend it to those that like this sort of long winded tirade against modern life.
296;I wouldn't recommend it as a date movie, and while I enjoyed watching it once, I can't really recommend it as a library film, the I can get the message again without sitting through a long film.
297;It is a film for anyone who has ever really thought about their life, and life in general.
298;If you are wondering how a film could feature barechested men in toughman fights sans gloves and any padding or protection at all as well as explore the fundamental question, Am I special, unique or wonderful in some grand, metaphysical way?
299;, well, this is your film.
300;See the movie, then read the book.
301;It is well worth it.
302;It give a much needed message while providing excellent, though dark, entertainment.
303;I highly recommend it for anyone who needs to grow a pair!
304;Fight Club is honestly the most underated movie of the 90's.
305;After I first viewed it in theaters I was completely in awe.
306;Very violent, hence the name of the movie, but it is excellent.
307;A work of art in its own right.
308;for a movie that attacks a value system that is partially reasponsible for its production is the sweet irony that made me reflect upon myself when the timing was absolutely perfect.
309;fight Club is a perfect addition to your Blu.
310;It's as awesome as I remembered it!
311;I haven't seen fight club in a rather large number of years so it was a pleasant surprise to be able to view it so easily on my kindle!
312;A violent, creative cult classic in the noir style that will do much more than entertain.
313;Really funny prank on the menu!
314;Great Addition to my Movie Collection!
315;Everything about it is amazing!
316;ray is just the cherry on top!
317;it's got some good points, about money controlling your life.
318;You have to give up, and realize that one day you WILL die.
319;If you only saw the previews, I recommend you watch this.
320;I originally saw the movie only because of Edward Norton, who in my opinion is an outstanding actor, but afterwards, I was incredibly pleased with the result.
321;This is vivid proof that there's still some intelligence left in Hollywood: a daring straight.
322;face story, Fight Club is an outstanding film that takes no concessions whatsoever towards the viewer, becoming a cult film years after its release like often these type of films do, Fight Club is flawless, from the performances to the cinematography to the well blended special effects.
323;Not since Stanley Kubrick a director has been so bold in talking about these subjects of alienation and the nature of violence in the consumer society we live in.
324;It's worth more than one look.
325;It is a mesmerizing story with lots of memorable moments (both funny and dramatic), and it is well.
326;It has some interesting thought.
327;provoking content, including some comments and themes about consumerism and capitalism.
328;Characters are strong
329;Acting and writing are excellent.
330;There are some interesting special effects, most of which hold up to this day.
331;Photography is solid, and the editing style is interesting.
332;It all works together to create some distinctive imagery.
333;Production design (sets, props, costumes, sets) is excellent.
334;Music is really interesting (performed by the Dust Brothers).
335;The picture is very sharp and detailed, with excellent color and contrast.
336;There is a fine layer of film grain
337;My copy came with a cool slipcover that can fold open.
338;there is also a nice little gag with the menu screen.
339;The screen will flicker, and the real menu will appear.
340;This was an amazing movie.
341;The other reviewers of this film have done a fine job of telling you what this movie is about.
342;Prepare to get in a dark mood when you watch it.
343;if you liked this movie you are an intelligent person who understood the message it presents.
344;Good acting, score, and quite funny jokes for those who think enough to get them are all great aspects of this film.
345;This is one of my top favorite movies.
346;I have a lot of respect for Chuck Palahniuk's work, and this movie is VERY well adapted from the novel.
347;It's gritty, sexy, and thought.
348;This is a film that should be first.
349;Desite the bizzare and rather brutal fight scenes the movie is excellent.
350;The acting and camera angles are amazing.
351;Thae actings great and the plot one very unexpected.
352;For a while, people have kept telling me to see this movie, saying that it is amazing, and it will change my life, so I went into it with some really high expectations.
353;i don't know
354;This movie was truly spectacular and moving.
355;quenching film on all of it's thought.
356;I saw this film thrice and loved it every time even more than the last!
357;And for all for all you Brad Pitt or Edward Norton fans , you shall also be impressed with Norton's usual greatness, and Pitt's previously unseen side of acting in this film.
358;see masterpiece which will invoke many thoughts and emotions within any open.
359;I agree that there is a powerful message, actually there are several.
360;I will break from the norm and avoid touching on what I thought the film meant.
361;I will say that the dialogue in this movie is fantastic, sometimes funny, sometimes scary.
362;The supplemental disk has some really cool features, notably the PSAs and deleted scenes.
363;If you like memorable characters, smart, funny writing, plot twists, and on.
364;Best existentialist movie ever made.
365;Have watched this movie a few dozen times and is in my favorite collection of videos.
366;One of the best movies I have ever seen.
367;David Fincher is definitely a great Director, his first movie was ALien 3 (Maybe the worst alien made), but not for that is a bad movie.
368;The he made Seven, one of the most succesfull thriller movie made, the game, a good film but not terrific.
369;The plot is inteligent and the same time full of irony, Brad Pitt made one of his best work doing Tyler Durden, but who take the show is Edward Norton his perfomance is brilliant, perfect, and definitely his has to be nominated to an oscar, and win it.
370;The movie is anamorphic and look terrific, is THX certified and is one of the best video transfer I ever see, except Bugs Life that is a digital direct transfer.
371;The sound is Amazing definitely one of the most interactive sound, I think that for that was made th 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround.
372;This special anniversary edition of Fight Club is a MUST HAVE edition for those whose enjoy David Fincher and his master piece.
373;This is a movie unlike any I have ever seen, and a story unlike any I've ever heard of.
374;he is one of the best (if not the best) actors of his generation.
375;Helena Bonham Carter is wonderfully trashy, quite a switch from the beautiful women of period films she's known for playing.
376;So brace yourself if you need to and check out this fabulous movie.
377;Violent, yes, but also (and moreso) intelligent, creative, and actually often hilarious.
378;made and most beautiful movies that I have ever seen.
379;I was amazed at the brilliant fight scenes.
380;this is one of those movies that you have to see to believe.
381;If you enjoy complicated, beautiful.
382;violent movies, this is perfect for you.
383;Very entertaining from beginning to end.
384;This is a must see.
385;if you don't have the movie yet pick it up, definitely a great addition to blu.
386;This is one of my three favorite movies of all time, and it looks that much better on Blu.
387;This movie is part of a golden list of classics that everyone should own.
388;profundity is kept simple enough for the masses to digest .
389;When I decided to give it a full viewing, it turned out I was spot.
390;Being that so many people hold this movie to be both sacred and clever .
391;I thought it would be a lot more creative.
392;I enjoyed the contrast between the gritty fight club Superman version of the narrator, to his Clark Kent .
393;This movie is brilliantly put together as far as actors go, Brad Pitt makes the movie.
394;go and beat the [.]
395;out of someone, receive a kick in the teeth yourself and you'll become happy.
396;The film tells us that there is more to life than your everyday breakfast.
397;it gives the feeling of freedom, it gives hope, it gives the sense of deliverance from the weight we carry on our shoulders (everyone has his own).
398;the movie is entertaining and serious at the same time like other works of David Fincher (Se7en at least) so it's the perfect opportunity to have fun and food for thought in one film.
399;A lot of people like this movie.
400;No doubt though that the acting was really good.
401;It has its humor, it has it's dark appealingness to it.
402;I simply loved this movie and has stayed at my #1 movie favorite since I saw it in the theatres.
403;smart, witty, well written and directed, acted.
404;if you like well made movies and don't mind watching violence this movie is great to watch and own.
405;Amazing movie even better book but the movie is amazing edward norton does an outstanding job and so does brad pitt.
406;It is one of my favorite movies I have seen.
407;This movie is a must see!
408;I recommend to you all to see this movie.
409;Fight club contains great plot twists and every scene is AMAZING.
410;notch and David Fincher (director) keeps the same satire.yet.
411;A must see for everyone.
412;Cool, noir atmosphere, beautfiul dialogue, great acting, beautiful action, interesting theme.
413;Yet the book managed to stay true to life and believable because of the blase manner in which it is presented and the foggy atmosphere of the book.
414;The ending was a standard Hollywood Everything's gone and done now, let's be happy and party!
415;This is one of the rare occurrence that movie is actually better than the book.
416;I like the movie ending and presentation better than the book's.
417;She won't say what it was but it was enough to get her to sit there through the Fight Club's entirety.
418;i, on the other hand, loved Fight Club so much I went out and bought the book.
419;So kudos to the screen adaptation.
420;very talented job in re.
421;i love the social commentary and how true and well it fits into today's society.
422;Fight Club is an excellent dark comedy with the message to fight the power that the media has on our psyche.
423;Do the tough and challenging things that make us feel alive.
424;If we need to ask what those ways are then the movie is correct in its assessment of how far removed we are from our true and simple selves.
425;We survived for thousands of year without SUVs, BMWs, the latest bikes and bike gears, the Versace dress shirt, that beautiful dress or those high heel shoes.
426;If you really enjoy the fight scenes check in with your favorite local therapist.
427;on and the actors were superb.
428;Norton is very talented and Fight Club should have been to him what American Beauty was to Kevin Spacey.
429;pitt shows maturity and range in this film.
430;he has been doing a lot of great works via Twelve Monkeys, the Seven Signs(?)
431;Overall a Fight Club is a great film and will probably become a classic.
432;so u thought the end twist in sixth sence was the best twist in the tale u've ever seen.
433;hit me as hard as u can.
434;the beauty of it is .
435;u can call it a surprise ending.
436;but then this isnt a 'makes u feel good'sortov film.
437;The best movie I've ever seen with Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.
438;Like no other, better than any other movie that I've see on this planet you got to see this movie
439;for once we see a great movie that summarizes heindigger's philosophy concerning technology.
440;in any case this is a great movie that is both funny and enlightening.
441;if u enjoy watching a good down to earth movie then this is the movie for you.
442;i think norton did a great job, as well a pitt.
443;the movie is a bit graphic but its necessary to show the true impact of what is being told.
444;and devoured it: film, commentaries, extras, everything.
445;Great detail, a boost in depth, color and blacks (especially the blacks) and the audio tracks are perfect.
446;The full package was already there.
447;Very affordable and one of the best blu.
448;This is my favorite movie next to Star Wars .
449;It's brilliant and has a major twist at the end.
450;She made that movie perfect.
451;If you havent seen it, i highly recommend that you do.
452;I love the twist at the ending.
453;It's a classic you must have.
454;I freaking love this movie.
455;This movie will move you, as will the book, but this brings the book to life.
456;And what a life it is.
457;I loved this film when I was younger.
458;Others see it as a protest against consumerism.
459;This is a really great movie, one of my faves.
460;The acting is on point and the plot is amazingly unpredictable.
461;This is one of the funniest movies that I have seen in years!
462;It is relentless in the way that it bombards the viewer with surprises and nonsequiters.
463;This is actually a character study of some very interesting people.
464;But this is one that you have to see for yourself.
465;personally fight club is one of the best movies that I've ever seen.
466;I think its a little funny because a lot of women love to see shirtless ripped men.
467;beyond the who likes what part, we come to the actual movie.
468;This movie is based on a book (of the same name) that is intense and well thought out so anyone who thinks this movie might be a scriptwriter's weekend off mission, you should once again think twice.
469;Edward Norton (my favorite actor: American history X, primal fear, etc.) and Brad Pitt give one of the most insane duo performances ever.
470;David Fincher (my favorite director: se7en, the game, panic room, and sadly alien 3) does in outstanding job of making this movie dark and hard to swallow.
471;AND an excellent movie to watch in general.
472;remark the cowardly reviewers who mock this brilliant piece of fiction.
473;Excellent bit of postmodern stitching.
474;Shows that holywood can actually throw around a bit of literature when they put themselves to task.
475;I was 18 when I first watched this movie, and it has been one of the most important philosophical lessons of my life.
476;In a world where people mentally torture themselves over trivial consumer pursuits ( The things you own, end up owning you. )
477;It provides a reset button and a sense of perspective on what you value and why you value it.
478;It starts with a chance meeting between Tyler Durden and the Narrator on a flight which through a series of odd events leads to the narrator giving up his middle class lifestyle in favor of moving into a derelict building in a run down part of town.
479;The presence of a true adrenaline rush stress has makes office politics and other non.
480;Its dictates are fruitless, and will always leave you feeling incomplete and insufficient.
481;thank you Chuck Palahniuk for writing such an amazing book.
482;Watch it once, twice, or even four times until it sinks in and THEN AND ONLY THEN, diss it or recommend it.
483;The story is so unique and mysterious that you will have no choice but to watch it all the way through.
484;Definitely for the testerone driven real men out there.
485;Pitt and Norton both turn in excellent performances and you even get a piece of Meat Loaf with boobies.
486;This is an enjoyable movie, and the many reviews here shed plenty of light on its details, I'm sure.
487;It has a very original story line, and is well acted.
488;This was entertaining as a movie, but the idea of kids actually forming their own fight clubs in real life is totally STUPID.
489;pounding thriller and a thought.
490;But once you fully understand the plot and take it all in, you'll be astonished at the brilliance of this film.
491;The acting is superb (particularly from Edward Norton, who plays Jack).
492;The film is full of explosive ideas as well
493;If you enjoy this movie read the book it is a mind opening experiance.
494;Calling it a movie is an understatment.
495;The fight scenes and the overall affects are Great.
496;Delivery was fast and sent right away overall Happy with everything.
497;FIGHT CLUB is one of those rare films that has warranted its huge cult following.
498;Whatever your opinion of the film it delivers a wallop of intensity and thought.
499;This film is very unique and one that many die.
500;But was it worth the wait?
501;darks take new form, colors are vibrant.
502;There are many unique scenes and backdrops in this film.
503;ray you see even more clearly what the director wanted to portray.
504;At times you can hear a pin drop and the expected explosions are so realistic you will be dumbfounded.
505;And all inbetween brings the film to a bigger reality.
506;The impressive cast led by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter is astounding and the lead three give performances so creative, so unique and so intense that they rival the best in their careers.
507;The same is true for director David Fincher .
508;this is truly his masterpiece.
509;i highly recommend this movie in any form but particularly on the superb blu.
510;This film is so well done it is in no way dated.
511;One of the best films ever made shown to its greatest potential.
512;This movie is just brilliant.
513;Read the other reviews for more in depth examination, but as a film lover and always preferring relevant films, this one stands with the best commentaries on american mores and standards like The Godfather and Boogie Nights .
514;As a fan of great cinema I was flabbergasted.
515;I own all of Fincher's films and he ranks as one of our most important voices.
516;As a man watching a film about being a man in today's society I was shaken to the core of my being.
517;The previous reviewers are all good people who obviously love cinema.
518;honestly, folks, what is it about?
519;The acting and cinematography are excellent.
520;Which is the only part of California technically located in Iowa.
521;if you like this movie, you'll love Triumph of the Will.
522;Just get real with your inner self.
523;No joke, the second time is so much better than the first, kinda like getting high.
524;in reality, this is one mind numbingly great movie.
525;My friends and I dont even refer to Brad Pitt as himself anymore, we call him Tyler Durden because this was obviously one of his best performances.
526;That who cares i do what i want personality is portrayed perfectly on Pitt's part, and Norton, what an underrated actor.
527;filled, relentless racist in American History X. He's one of the best character actors around.
528;If you don't watch it twice, it probably wont be as good.
529;And dont, for the love of god, watch it on TV.
530;All in all, this movie is a classic cult flick.
531;Watch it with an open mind.
532;they do a great job and the twist at the end!
533;great movie start to finish!
534;this is one of my all time favorite movies that i can watch over and over again!
535;so many classic lines .
536;there's just about everything i like in a movie!
537;If you liked David Fincher's Se7en as much as I did (and I liked it a lot), then you will be able to experience these emotions again when you view this wonderfully chaotic masterpiece: Fight Club.
538;Again he continues with witty social commentary, chewing and spitting out the middle class urban and suburban lifestyles.
539;For others, like myself, Fincher and Chuck Palaniuk combine to reinforce my beliefs in a most astounding way.
540;When I'm looking at the Top Ten list's of America's critics and the nominations of the DGA,WGA and all the other guilds and press associations, I terribly miss David Fincher's outstanding film Fight Club , which is possibly the best film of 1999.
541;not only is the film visualy stunning, it is also very thought.
542;provoking, wickedly funny and, above all, extremely entertaining.
543;Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are brilliant in the leads and the soundtrack by the Dust Brothers fits perfectly to the images.
544;In fact, he invites us to form our own opinion, like Stanley Kubrick did in A Clockwork Orange .
545;Fight Club is one of the best films critisizing western type life of today.
546;but someone told me this was a love story.
547;This is an absolutely original movie, unlike anything else.
548;Designed to encourage thought rather than to just entertain.
549;I'm grateful somebody's making intelligent films like this and we get a choice and an occasional change of pace.
550;This is quite possibly the weirdest mainstream movie out there and extremely worth the viewer's trouble.
551;The 3 leads are fantastic and they all do a top.
552;I read the book after seeing the flick and I'm glad I did it in that order.
553;But hey, what can you expect from the amazing directing of David Fincher of SE7EN?
554;Dialogue can be very clear and ingenious if listened to carefully.
555;Watch this beauty with full attention and surely more than once.
556;This film mainly works as a black comedy and as a social comentary.
557;director David Fincher shows kinetic visual style and offers up some bone crunching entertainmant.
558;This is easily one of his better movies.
559;Edward Norton holds his own and Helena Bonham Carter as Marla is great.
560;classic film, gotta love fight club man.
561;The underlying meanings and criticisms of society are their, but the entertainment value is matched by non other.
562;I believe the ending was a piece of pure genious.
563;If you've seen Fight Club, you know how great it is.
564;When I saw Fight Club in theaters, I witnessed a truly disturbing and intriguing movie.
565;The movie twists and turns into some somewhat unrealistic turns, but the audience gets an amazing glimpse of the human psyche and the dark recesses of the soul that are hidden to society.
566;This movie came out when i was in my late teens and it was amazing.
567;i'll remember it forever as an amazing show
568;This is a beautifully constructed piece of art that hammers against your senses from start to finish!David Fincher has an excellent track record with Alien 3 and Se7en and you can almost taste the darkness he brings to this story.
569;This is the best I have seen both of them.
570;Brad shines like a light as the muscular, taut alter.
571;It is wonderfully packaged and you actually get two discs.
572;the final rule of this movie is that if you are going to make a movie, make it one that shakes everyone up and gets them arguing amongst themselves.
573;something male living in 'middle' America and from what I see
574;Children are rampaging through schools with shotguns reenacting scenes from Quake and the consensus solution is .
575;Obesity is at an all time high in this country, and it serves as a flawless metaphor of America .
576;At one point during the dialog, Ed Norton says that when he read the script
577;Neither movies nor their reviews can completely cover complex concepts in a nice simple package.
578;I need more than star power to see a movie.
579;I believe its very hard to advertise for without giving away anything that makes it so unique.
580;I love movies that suprise me, and this one did.
581;This was the best movie of the year, with American Beauty right behind it.
582;Fight Club tells you to do what you want, do what makes you feel good.
583;There is a fight in everyone's life, the fight with themselves.
584;The point I am trying to make is whatever you want to do to make yourself happy do it, I loved this movie because it helped me to understand that.
585;I give this movie the highest rating I can, and I urge you to see this movie, mopre than once to get the overall feel and emotion it was intended to put out.
586;This is a movie that truly EVERYONE can gain something from.
587;The impact hit me like a ton of bricks.
588;This is the most mind.
589;(consumerism, I know) but trust me, it's certainly worth it.
590;This is definitely one to own.
591;It looks most impressive once you get to the house on Paper Street.
592;I watched it with DTS 5.1 and could hear every drop of water, wail, stomp, punch and explosion in glorious surround sound.
593;The 4/5 stars I give this more of a really like it .
594;OK so you have to suspend your disbelief a little, it's a movie!
595;Together they form a new type of therapy for men who feel discarded from society.
596;fight Club is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
597;All of the actors turn in superb performances (even Meat Loaf!)
598;There's a lot of great black comedy throughout.
599;If you like movies like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, or The Usual Suspects you'll probably enjoy this one.
600;An absolutely brilliant thrill ride of a movie.
601;Its one of those mind benders where the more you think about it, the greater it gets.
602;Its funny, brutal, sadistic and a true masterpiece.
603;Fight Club is really about personal liberation, and genius that osolates into insanity.
604;He is a tourist, and at first, a very sound sleeping one.
605;Marla is much better at this game than he is.
606;She walks in traffic, realizing life can end any moment.
607;She outwits her rival tourist, and soon, he is back to sleepless square one.
608;this raises one of several major points in the film.
609;ego, which is really his ideal self.
610;Usually, we see our ideal selves as another person, devorced from us.
611;now, if we believe our heros version of events, he has gone quite mad, but on another level his madness is genius.
612;He just externalized it, and probably came closer to getting free form his chains then most of us will.
613;fight Club makes more keen social comments.
614;two other points about violence stand out: First, the one time he takes a fight to far and disfigures a fellow member, it is at a point in the film where he is about to go over the edge
615;regardless, Fight Club is a funny, entertaining, thought provoking film, its points much more nuanced than the title and fight scenes indicate.
616;type of movie than Fight Club is for you.
617;It's a story of a man who's life falls in shambles but after he meets a stranger on a plane he buddies with him and the chaos that the two combine are able to brainwash every male being in their perimeter of contact.
618;The cinematography is really good in the film and you can even see some surprising pop.
619;This was one of the funniest films of last year while also having another layer beyond a bunch of guys beating eachother up.
620;Edward Norton gives another great performance as the narrator and Brad Pitt is hilarious as Tyler Durden.
621;The directing by David Fincher is imaginative while not being too flashy.
622;Although misunderstood by hundreds of highschool students (who think the movie is f. n cool!
623;One for the movie and one for extras.
624;The transfer and sound are also top of the line.
625;I've got to keep this short, since I've written so many reviews on it, but this movie is so full of surprises.
626;I've seen it over 40 times and it is still my favorite movie.
627;It has all these special features on it.
628;This film has it all: comedy, drama, romance, conflict, horror, the perfect recipe for a great movie.
629;This film starts out with an interesting premise about a guy who's searching for meaning in his ordinary, boring life of conformity.
630;It could have been a thoughtful film.
631;I'm tempted to say that it is the best film of the past 20 years.
632;Ed Norton is his usual brilliant self, and director Fincher is the best thing to hit films in a decade.
633;Fight Club BD viewed on a Panasonic 50 plasma via a Panasonic DMP.
634;some soft scenes, but some revealing things from viewing the BD .
635;So I finally took the plunge and picked up a Blu.
636;although brutal along the lines ofGoodFellas, Fight Club is smart, funny, and exceptionally dark.
637;It also has at its heart a (very) surprisingly good love story starring Helena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd).
638;I also think this is one of Carter's strongest roles.
639;parcel to the entire components of the film and its incredibly awesome story structure.
640;In 1995 they did the excellent filmSeven.
641;If you enjoyed that film, you'll absolutely fall in love with this one.
642;Fincher loves to play mind.
643;It was HOW the reveal was pulled off that made the film so amazing.
644;and many reviews like that can easily be found.
645;They will absolutely ruin the film for you.
646;Kind of like a surprise punch to the face.
647;Another great film in the list of good Brad Pitt movies.
648;He made a great career change starting with Seven and has yet to dissapoint.
649;Norton also gives a great performance, which is par for the course with him.
650;This is an wonderful film.
651;Intelligent, well directed, great acting, and deeply symbolic.
652;tyler clearly has a world view that many, particularly young ( perhaps predominently white ) men feel these days.
653;Lack of purpose, no worthwhile goals ( other than a cool new car or nice furniture ), a society that trys to create our opinions for us.
654;This film gives insight into the human condition of many young men in the modern world and, like that view or not, it may help you to understand some of things that drive people to the edge.
655;Now it's no coincidence that they played stranger than normal characters, but they also made them believable.
656;I think, that that is the mark of a terrific actor.
657;As a collector of movies, everything has to look good.
658;products of a life style obsession.
659;He was beautiful, and in general, preying on the weak and easily influenced.
660;Better yet, finding a way of removing any reason for them to go down to the the basement in the first place.
661;Perhaps something much more real and important .
662;I saw this movie for the first time back in 2000 after hearing great reviews from my friends and a warning that it was both funny and enlightening.
663;The cast is fantastic especially Edward Norton as he falls continuously into the confusion and deceit of daily life.
664;There are always going to be people in the world who claim that they don't like a movie because of its violent content.
665;The Sixth Sense is a mediocre movie with a great ending, The Fight Club is a great movie with a mediocre ending.
666;~ one of those cutting edge movies from the 70's.
667;It's as shocking as Taxi Driver was in its day and every bit as good.
668;totally and delightfully twisted, this movie is so completely over.
669;top and original, it's more fun to watch the second time than the first.
670;a man gets addicted to attending group therapy sessions.
671;This film is an example of just how strong the media these days is controlled by conservative morals.
672;Of course, as is par for the course with them, conservatives lacked the intellectual depth to see the true meaning behind this film, the metaphor of the desolation of a modern existence.
673;for the controversy alone this film generates, and for its determination to become a succesful cult smash in light of the recent pathetic Victorian morals backlash, this is one of the defining films of my generation.
674;This film is a classic.
675;end Wilmington, Delaware office job, is lured upon the burning of his apartment into the dangerous and complex world of Tyler Durden.
676;time viewer curious about this remarkable film.
677;edward Norton and Brad Pitt are a dynamite pair, and it was wise casting to accentuate the close friendship these two share in real life.
678;David Fincher's directing style has ushered in a slew of copycats, the true mark of an impactful, brilliant director.
679;There's a reason she won Best British Actress at England's version of the Oscars for this role.
680;I'm not a fight fan so I resisted viewing this film for years.
681;The cinematography is awe inspiring and creative and some of the fight scenes are incredibly graphic and certianly are not for the squeamish.
682;Fight Club is an unflinchingly stunning and stylish film that sucks you in and propells you along its high octane trajectory.
683;If you're a fighting fan you'll forgive its flaws and love every minute of it.
684;I hear the book is better.
685;Highlights: Direction
686;lover, and honestly appreciate filmmaking, you will observe the violence in Fight Club as an essential aspect emphasizing the overall relentlessness of the film.
687;Edward Norton and Brad Pitt's chemistry is as electric as the fight scenes of the radical Fight Club members
688;Ed Nortan's corporate drone is the perfect persona to set off Brad Pitt's wonderfully witty and outrageously glam character Tyler Durhem who lives life on his own terms.
689;Helen carter Borham is the single female presence and matches the fellas in her own delightfully twisted way, and has a bedroom scene with Brad that is as intensly violent as it is hilarious with a killer one liner.
690;A high concept cinematic treat handled with twisted humor , high octane energy and comic book graphics .
691;this one is definitely one of the best movie's that came out the last 10 years totally original and brilliant and it could never been better but i disagree with some people saying that the last 20 minutes was like any typical action movie, well the hole movie is great and i totally agreed with there msg .
692;If you like movies that make you think and leave you feeling uneasy, this is for you.
693;If you can't handle abiguity this movie will really irritate you.
694;Watch this movie twice and again, pay attention to the dialog.
695;the reviewer wfparish (sorry if i spelled that incorrectly) hit the nail right on thehead, quite possibly the greatest aspect of this movie is that it WILL make you think, make you question how you live, and quetion the benefits of society, especially the one in which we live.
696;Fight club provides them with raw emotion, and they take this to be happiness.
697;It attacks the media, and their attempts (quite often successful) to make us conform.
698;whether or not you see this as true,is up to you and you alone.
699;what matters is that you see this movie, which is unbelivable.
700;It is extremely entertaining, David Fincher has yet again done a tremendous job, and David Uhls brought the book to the screen splendidly, retaining much of the comedy that lightens an otherwise rather dark movie.
701;Ed Norton, and Brad Pitt both give amazing performances, as does Helena Bonham Carter.
702;I loved Seven and the Game so I knew i'd at least like the movie, but I could never have predicted how much.
703;It is perfect in every sence of the word.
704;Saw this movie last month.
705;Sort of a go for the gusto premise.
706;The Service has a bottomless list of opportunities for young men to prove themselves, often in the manliest and most noble way possible, and it's all just a phone call away.
707;okay, enough with the commercial.
708;I just shook my head at the end of this movie and thought to myself, what was the point??
709;One of my all time favorites.
710;It's fight club, the best movie of all time.
711;The darkness of the film and the soundtrack by the Dust Brothers makes for an unforgettable movie experience.
712;Every time she talks, its like .
713;Suburb acting, great dialog, gritty story.
714;The detail that was in the book and that got put into the film is amazing.
715;I give this a 4 star rating just because of that.
716;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are great together in this movie.
717;If You loved the book, you will love the film just as much.
718;And yes, it helps to watch it at least twice.
719;The political message it sends is one fitting of the times, and may make you think twice about what you are doing with your life.
720;brad Pitt and Edward Norton each give one of their best performances as the main characters.
721;Pitt is, I believe, one of the best actors to play a crazy person (see also: 12 Monkeys, Kalifornia).
722;And Edward Norton is perhaps the best actor of his generation, although he doesn't seem to get credit for his work.
723;The plot is very engaging, as long as you're not offended by anti.
724;It would be worth your time to watch the whole movie with the commentary on.
725;Consisting of a handful of great actors, an incredible audio experience (thanks to the Dust Brothers) and visual effects which, in my opinion, rival The Matrix, Fight Club has captured the very essence of a non.
726;Brad Pitt's character portrays the ideal alter.
727;This movie's complexities will keep you from realizing the truth until the very end.
728;Definitely a testament to the enormous talent of director David Fincher.
729;This is a very odd movie, but a great one.
730;When the fight scenes appear, you hear the cheering all around you, and the punches bring in alot of bass.
731;This has to be one of my favorite movies ever!
732;This movie ranks right up there with Pulp Fiction and Fear Loathing In Las Vegas.
733;It is a cult classic that has grown to be a favorite.
734;Ed Norton is an amazing narrator and Brad Pitt is the face of unabashed constructive insanity.
735;This was the most inventive, and definitely the best film of 1999.
736;The narraration of the film by Edward Norton is an excellent twist to the movie, and the plot takes many turns, but the plot flows beautifully.
737;The concluding twenty minutes of the movie is breathtaking, and the ending is spectacular.
738;The directing of David Fincher, always reliable, stands out here as his best work to date.
739;This dethrones Seven as his best movie.
740;And Brad Pitt is excellent as Tyler Durden, Edward Norton's best friend and enemy at the same time.
741;first off, let me establish that i admire fincher as a director, (SEVEN was excellent), this film is well shot, and as usual edward norton is excellent, along with brad pitt.
742;but please, if i have to listen once more to spoiled, rich actors decrying the capitalist system that they themselves have exploited.
743;gee, thanks for that guys.
744;one last thing, the ending, far from being clever, cheapens all that has proceeded it, and is akin to an it was all a dream episode from countless sitcoms.
745;as for the the film itself I thought it was interesting and entertaining.
746;There's a lot of interesting camera work and unobtrusive computer graphics.
747;The story is interesting and the screenplay is funny and dark.
748;In the commentary the two actors mention the director's habit of underlighting scenes.
749;i was totally surprised by the twist and thought it was very well done and satisfying.
750;It's good to see Brad Pitt and Edward Norton criticizing Rosie O'Donnel.
751;this is a good value and a good movie, I don't think it is as important as Edward Norton or some critics seem to think it is but it wasn't the signal of the end society either.
752;It was just a pretty good film.
753;A movie with a fresh storyline.
754;Acting is very good and you really never know where the movie is going because it is not predictable.
755;An enjoyable movie with many plot twists.
756;Keeps you guessing throughout the movie.
757;Good acting and good plot make this movie a must see.
758;The surprise as a first.
759;thirds of the film, prior to and including most of the story involving the actual club, is absolutely brilliant, crackling with wit, insight, and great one.
760;I will certainly give Fight Club credit for its originality.
761;And again, it is brilliant in the extreme for its first two.
762;Certainly not recommended for anyone under 18, nor for the squeamish of any age, Fight Club is worth seeing for its clever camera tricks and editing, for its social commentary, and mostly for the remarkable prose of the words put into the actors' mouths by screenwriter Jim Uhls, based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk.
763;Wow,what an incredible piece of cinema.
764;my hat goes off to David Fincher for puttin together,one of the greatest fight movies since Rocky.
765;Dark, Hilarious, and visually stunning.
766;Great performances from Pitt, Norton, and Carter with the incredible directing from David Fincher.
767;This is THE Cult film.
768;Fincher brings such great style with Palahniuk's story.
769;The way he uses CG is fantastic.
770;I watched in horror as they laughed their heads off and marvelled at the cool parts, which happened to be the parts that contained the most disturbing advances in the plot.
771;the amazing twist at the end didn't make a whole lot of sense either.
772;I witnessed something very close to that with a pretty good cross.
773;He knows what he wants and he is more than willing to take it.
774;Durden is his perfect doppelganger, he is the self image of what Norton's character wants to be, yet can not bring himself to become.
775;singer becomes like a mirror image of Norton's character, the self he he abuses, but secretly loves.
776;He realizes that humanity is much more than an instrument for the fortune of other, and that he, himself and not Durden, should be the master of his own fate.
777;Norton learns to love himself, and by extension the mirror image of himself Marla, and even as the material world crumbles he is able to be at piece with himself and the love he has found.
778;He is very honest and straight forward!
779;Fight Club is a movie that deserves far more credit than it received at original theatrical release.
780;It is an addicting story that adds to itself as it goes.
781;In this film the unnamed protagonist gets his only meaning for life through a world that is special and unique to himself.
782;As he goes through his life, he meets two very interesting characters, Tyler and Marla.
783;These two change and add to his life in the most profound ways.
784;The clincher at the end of this film ties these three together beautifully.
785;The background score supplied by the Dust Brothers adds the perfect final touch to this movie experience.
786;Fight Club is a movie that should be viewed with an open mind.
787;It is a wonderful film that will make you think and reexamine your life.
788;A great movie, running up only up against the movie, American Beauty, Fight Club is a much more dark and slightly less realistic story that gets across the same message as American Beauty: Life isn't so bad.
789;It's actually much more in depth than that simple statement, but any movie that can actually CONVINCE you of that statement, is amazing.
790;It's a great movie and it gets across an amazing message that is both simple and complex, happy viewing!
791;Amazing dialogue, very quotable and the acting is superb.
792;It is a rare occurrence when one finds a movie that can captivate a viewer and suddenly and without warning turn everything around to the point where the person says, Wait a MINUTE!
793;David Fincher's masterful and exciting film FIGHT CLUB does more than simply entertain.
794;Tyler is the epitome of stylish, cool, and without a doubt the one man who can do anything.
795;Together, they discover a certain animal pleasure in fighting.
796;Edward Norton gives a phenomenal and mesmerizing performance and establishes himself as one of the best young actors of our generation.
797;Brad Pitt is simply amazing as Durden, playing a role that only a gifted actor could accomplish.
798;Helena Bonham Carter gives a surprisingly powerful performance as Marla and gives the character tons of dimension.
799;paced, humorous, and spectacular film whose most incredible and surprising twist near the end will knock you off your seat!
800;Fight club is just a epic movie, if you have seen it you know why.
801;The movie was so powerful to me that I wanted to see if there was more.
802;the flashes of people and places that add to the sense of the surreal life the insomniac main character is living.
803;This whole movie has such an incredible look to it, very stylistic.
804;A lot of the dialogue is almost directly from the book.
805;There are a few tracks of commentary, including Chuck Palahniuk and the main stars and those are interesting to listen to.
806;scenes features are amusing and I'm so glad that make.
807;i'm a big fan of the movie so I guess I'm a bit biased, but I do think that the actors are amazing, and the plot is just so wonderfully twisted that I can't see how someone couldn't enjoy this movie.
808;I loved Fight Club the first time around.
809;I was mesmerized by the visuals, the story, the mystery, the fine acting and the surprise at the end.
810;see it, if you haven't.
811;And if you have, see it again.
812;If you liked Pulp Fiction, you will probably enjoy this movie.
813;There was a clever twist involved.
814;Any movie which stirs up as much thought and reflection as seen in these reviews is doing something right.
815;I've got a smart television and it had a hard time with some of the frame splicing.
816;This movie is a must see!
817;Best movie of the 90's and probably ever (that's right).
818;Brad Pitt's performance is so memorable that it shows you he is underrated as an actor.
819;This movie captured my interest from the beginning, by the time the movie ended, I realized that I now had a brand new movie to watch !
820;very well written outstanding casting, direction and production are just a few of the compliments attributable to this movie.
821;This film is an exploration of a mans mind.
822;It is very well done.
823;If you like brutality this is one for you.
824;If you like intelectual films this is a film for you.
825;If you like cool well made films this is a film for you.
826;If you have seen Fight Club, you got that.
827;ed Norton plays the narrator, a nameless character who's dissappointed by his professional life, his love life, and the world he lives in.
828;Tyler is a man who is dangerously smart, and even more dangerously charming.
829;but Tyler encourages a generation of disenchanted men to embrace their aggression, to channel it, and to make use of it.
830;I am a huge Chuck Palahniuk fan.
831;I bought this for the extra content (because I own the first blu.
832;ray release) and it was definitely worth the money.
833;The movie is much larger than that.
834;The story is great, acting is great, filming is great.
835;I will say this though, the movie is unusual.
836;An the ending is one of the best I have ever watched!
837;You really should give this movie a watch.
838;Yes, it is a great action film with great fight scenes.
839;Yes, The music is great.
840;Yes, the apocalyptic regime known as Project Mayhem is led by an anarchistic genius.
841;This film will ring true always because of one simple fact
842;I love the dialogue, the acting, the direction, the editing, the music.
843;But what I really love is the underlying truth that is layered throughout the film and brought to the surface without any pomp and circumstance.
844;this is a great film in every way, and Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham.
845;The supporting cast, including a then unknown Jared Leto, Meatloaf (yeah, the singer) who shines, and several other familiar faces, was phenomenal.
846;As a hollywood blockbuster, this film had it all.
847;but, more importantly it had something deeper.
848;so, live a little, and watch this movie.
849;It has to be one of the greatest films I have ever seen in my whole life for so many amazing reasons.
850;portrayed, beautifully captured, complex masterpiece that was easily the film of 1999.
851;You'll soon see that special effects aren't everything and that all you need is a mind.
852;blowing script like the one on display here to make a seismic impact.
853;paced way of life makes a big impression on Jack.
854;He has one main motivation in life: to disrupt social ethics and the way in which we live our lives.
855;Fight Club is formed, a secret underground society where men meet, one.
856;helena Bonham Carter is really fantastic as Marla, who is another fake visiting social victim groups when she meets Jack.
857;The genius at work, director David Fincher, has created an intricate and glowing masterpiece that unfortunately gained a reputation as a guy.
858;It's anything but, and I encourage anyone who enjoys films such as American Beauty to watch it .
859;not for the violence, but for the lesson you'll undoubtedly learn from society's fabrication.You can't really watch this film without seeing how beautifully.
860;Filled with dark and brooding colours and tones of blues and blacks, we get a perfect view of the society in which Tyler and Jack inhabit.
861;down city just reflects the storyline completely.
862;candy on offer: I don't want to sound clich , but Brad Pitt is just so beautiful in this film!
863;The film makes an impact right from the start and Jack's smart narration is a part of this completely.
864;I haven't revealed the twist that this movie contains, but it's really smart and very well.
865;View it for what it is: a sharp and bright look at society and the ways in which we are told to live.
866;Fight Club is one of the bravest films of the 90's, it is also one of the best.
867;The previous edition was near perfect, this one improves upon it in every way.
868;The picture quaility is much better.
869;And Also, their are loads more special features on the second disk.
870;This one is among the best.
871;Now let me get to the best part.
872;I'm a sound freak, and I appreciate great sound.
873;If you have a good sound setup with 5.1 surround, you'll love Fight Club.
874;They did a great job on the mixing board with this one.
875;Great movie, I thought from the title and knowing nothing about this that this movie would really suck.
876;What a delightful suprise, one of the better movies i have seen in a year or so.
877;The film transfer and sound are excellent.
878;First I watched the film, then again with the commentaries, and found them very usefull in appreciating this unique motion picture.
879;First of all this film is easily easily one of the best films I have ever been fortunate to see.
880;besides the insightful themes the viewer will also be delighted with the superb performances of both Norton and Pitt.
881;I have seen all of Norton's work and the majority of Pitt's and I can declare without a doubt that their performances in Fight Club is by far the best of both their careers.
882;Great cast and production all the way around.
883;here's a film that is stylish, smart, often preposterous, and makes me want to pay a lot closer attention to the career of director David Fincher, because he's a guy with some true artistic vision.
884;It also has some of the most hysterical OFF.
885;screen sex scenes I've ever heard!
886;It has so much intersesting stuff on it.
887;This item was shipped to me within a few days, nicely packaged, in perfect shape, Worked wonderfully, no scratches, did not skip at all.
888;Its a good movie and very well worth what I payed for it.
889;This movie is for sure one you should pick up and play.
890;it has action,fighting,and a script in which you have to listen.
891;Men are often at their best when they are in conflict, and for a great many men, the modern world is one of cubicles, shopping malls, and feminine nagging.
892;In this mode, his moral yearnings are satisfied by fair trade marketing gimmicks so enjoyed by the upwardly mobile.
893;The club grows into a spiritual movement centered around wreaking the soul.
894;The climax of the movie is a mind.
895;this movie has inspired a great many men to re.
896;The United States has been at war for more than a decade, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved with fighting.
897;In this regard the movie should be seen as an inspiring call to arms rather than mere complaining.
898;Yes, it is very original and definitely has it's moments but it is totally slick and glossed over.
899;burn themselves with cigarettes and call themselves human buttwipe.
900;there are many other things but just one I have to mention is the ending which is absolutely PATHETIC!
901;i will say that some parts of this movie are excellent but the entire film had the potential to be unbelievably amazing.
902;You have probably heard of Fight Club, the 1999 film that is regarded has a cult hit and one of the most quoted and re.
903;Not only is it a popular film, but it is also an amazing one.
904;the Narrator is played to perfection by Edward Norton.
905;He brings the character to life, and playing some one depressed, that is a hard job.
906;Brad Pitt is amazing and could be his best role.
907;When you watch Helena Bonham Carter you'll see why she always play roles like these
908;The twist at the end of the story is famous, and the plot is smart and instantaneous, keeping viewers hooked.
909;David Fincher has exceeded all, and so has the cast.
910;Both Pitt and Norton are very good here as well.
911;carter, who is quite effective in that role.
912;The actual fighting was strangely hypnotic and not boring like I thought it would be.
913;Fight Club is definitely my favorite flick of 1999.
914;I recommend this film to everyone, but the easily offended.
915;Mainly because he can cry openly and because it's amazing how much people are willing to listen to you if they think you're dieing .
916;There is also a very unexpected suprise ending!
917;Norton is a great actor he is one of the best around that is for sure.
918;Despite the violence, this satire and social commentary is highly entertaining.
919;carter plays this role extremely well.
920;So well does she take on this character that this may be one of her strongest performances on film.
921;Because they may experience genuine emotion should they open themselves to each other.
922;so many themes emerge in this fast paced film.
923;For in beating the hell out of each other men release their aggressive impulses and the genuine physical pain is far more real and preferable than any inner existential pain.
924;The fight club is a gift for these men.
925;Organized sports and game hunting come to mind.
926;Such odds and ends are woven throughout the film.
927;I'm a rock climber so I know what rocks 'n this rocks a whole lot.
928;If you ever felt like a slave to society and realized how messed up some of the practices humans involved themselves in every day or ever felt like rebeling against it, then you will love this movie.
929;It's witty, brilliant, and amusing.
930;The actors and actresses are amazing and play their characters perfectly.
931;This is by far one of my favorite movies.
932;See the guys with testicular cancer.
933;Fight Club has carved such an integral niche amongst the great psychological masterpieces ever put on the screen.
934;there is a great deal of fighting going on in this story though.
935;with all the intricate layers, this is a movie you can watch repeatedly and always pick up something new.
936;It really has developed a cult following.
937;interest in terms of our collective primal requirements.
938;The logical conclusion of Fight Club is that people will only be able to lead an honest and fulfilling life when the instruments of late mature capitalism are destroyed.
939;From the opening sequence of Fight Club, you know you are in for a wild ride.
940;It takes you right inside a brain, synapses firing, fear response triggered.
941;You know it is CGI, but it looks like you are right inside the old grey matter.
942;They came, they saw, they liked, they sprang.
943;It wasn't as if he wrote it with the idea of selling the film rights, but certain people with rare vision could see it had potential.
944;The studio wanted to cut this, but it got big laughs at test screenings.
945;She felt it was a tremendous piece of literature, but not necessarily a great movie.
946;Our Great War's a spiritual war.
947;our Great Depression is our lives.
948;Edward Norton was an inspired casting choice.
949;The novel Fight Club is largely an interior monologue taking place inside the narrator's head, and voice over can sometimes not go over so well in a film, where you want to show rather than tell.
950;perfect for someone who would answer the door wearing a yellow rubber glove.
951;He really understands Tyler Durden and delivers with gusto.
952;I think that Fight Club is some of his best work.
953;He approached Fight Club level as the killer Early Grayce in Kalifornia, but Tyler is such a rich and complex character that it leaves all of his other roles in the dust.
954;Helena Bonham Carter makes a great Marla Singer.
955;She was perfect as Marla Singer.
956;marla Singer: There are things about you that I like.
957;You're smart, you're funny, you're.
958;They are both also very talented musically, but have a lot of stage presence in films.
959;She celebrated with confetti and streamers, as if she thought that Britney was now going to forsake all men and join her team.
960;It is also a masterpiece of film making, and even the author, Chuck Palahniuk, thinks that the film version actually improved on the novel.
961;The director, David Fincher, really took the somewhat fragmented ideas in the text and fashioned out of the shards a bold cinematic vision.
962;This movie is absolutely amazing!
963;My favorite Edward Norton movie.
964;If you don't mind a little violence then I would highly recommend this movie.
965;This film is both underrated and overrated.
966;I've discovered that, in most cases, if Brad Pitt is in a film then it is probably a good movie.
967;there are quite a few fight scenes and they are genuinely authentic fighting scenes.
968;A truly detached movie watcher can probably figure it out and yet still be fully entertained by it.
969;If you get sunk into the movie, though, you will be well into it before you understand what's happening, and the epiphany delivered is absolutely the tops.
970;A genuine work of art.
971;It's a far deeper idea than it would appear on the surface, and it's far more rewarding than most films could ever be.
972;it's a five star film.
973;This is a movie with a great surprise ending.
974;Great performances by the actors, incredible and believable.
975;Fast moving, oh and did I mention the great ending?
976;Alright, alright, so everyone knows now that this is a really good movie.
977;So maybe I can change a few minds with this review.
978;Fight club is the grossest, weirdest, most confusingly brilliant movie I've ever seen.
979;Fight Club is a great film that not only satirizes self.
980;Apart from the direction, acting, and technical achievement of the film, all of which are first.
981;She challenges his little fantasy.
982;salesman who's fed up with modern existence.
983;well, let's just call it a men's self.
984;Their solution to this myth.
985;burgeons across the nation, sprouting unauthorized fight clubs.
986;what a great and classic film.
987;This has become one of my favorite movies of all time.
988;this movie is outstanding and makes powerful statements about society, and especially men today.
989;If you are a generation x man you must see this.
990;this movie is very well acted by Edward Norton, and Brad Pitt, and very well directed.
991;I thank my lucky stars that Show Girls paved the way for Fight Club and now I can enjoy both on any drag.
992;an interesting oak tree once spoke to me.
993;So i polished his leaves instead.
994;Great film and even better special features.
995;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton form an awesome duo.
996;A masterpiece of cinematic editing too.
997;It is in my opinion the best of 1999's three great American films (the others being the Matrix and American Beauty) Still relevant to young people today.
998;I like it because of the higher knowledge.
999;It is a great movie I recommend it to everyone who likes a action movie
1000;This movie was absolutely awesome.
1001;Brad Pitt plays a great villain, and Edward Norton does a great job as Mr. Rational.
1002;A lot of reviewers who like this movie tell people who didn't like the movie to read the book.
1003;I would highly recommend to anyone who likes movies that actually make you think.
1004;Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are awesome in this.
1005;I recieved the movie in a timely manner and it came as was described.
1006;while the emotional intensity of the movie is very very high, you don't want to think about the plot changes too much about 2/3rds through the movie.
1007;i recommend keeping this out of the hands of any emotionally disturbed, but otherwise, an excellent choice to experience a type of anger vicariously, but safely from your living room.
1008;the entire movie is such an extreme morality story, maybe a real ending that fits this dark comedy couldn't be done for public consumption.
1009;still, a very interesting movie.
1010;redux), and was fast paced and exciting, with good acting, i gave it three stars.
1011;the plot goes funny (odd) in the end.
1012;One of the most intense movies that I have seen in a while.
1013;One of the best sci.
1014;Whatever the case it is a very enjoyable movie to watch but you have probably made that decision already.
1015;(also good in 2CH stereo)The extras are also very interesting.
1016;The commentary tracks are all worth listening to, offering an insight into the thematic choices made (Fincher, Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, Helena BC track, Screenwriter/author track, Fincher solo track), the special effects(Track 4, Fincher solo) and just some funny stories from the set.
1017;It offers a number of insights into how special effects were used to dramatic effect.
1018;Very attractive and also functional.
1019;fight Club has every element that defines a classic movie.
1020;The complex satirical plot is well developed although
1021;The plot is enhanced drastically by a witty and comical dialect.
1022;In order to be an epic film, acting performances must be impeccable, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both delivered all.
1023;star performances and every supporting actor or actress was cast perfectly to fit their parts.
1024;Above anything else it is the motifs, the ideas being presented, and the way in which they are being presented that makes the film the masterpiece that it is.
1025;Tyler is able to show Edward Norton's character that Raymond's life will be better.
1026;Every breath that he takes will be sweeter than most people can ever imagine.
1027;fight Club has every aspect of a great movie, yet many people do not like this wonderful film.
1028;up and often brutal satire to portray intense ideas, and some viewers may have trouble understanding these ideas.
1029;To this day, and forever, I believe it is one of the most ingenious films ever made!
1030;Ultra cool, ultra violent, and the characters are well developed!
1031;Admittedly it had some interesting concepts and was well acted but how it came together bothered me.
1032;It probably works much better in its book format.
1033;A fairly normal job, you'd think.
1034;(Just one of the many brilliant quotes from this movie).
1035;That is, until Marlo shows up .
1036;The movie has a surprise at the end, which I won't spoil.
1037;But it's got a great story line, plenty of great quotes and two great actors (Brad Pitt and Edward Norton).
1038;If you can get past the violence then you will love this movie.
1039;trust me and get the movie and enjoy!
1040;It's also VERY funny, very stylish, mischevious and the acting (Bonham Carter just gets better every time you watch it) is transfixing.
1041;Its about men's primal instincts, and fight for self respect, and for spiritual freedom.
1042;Its about the longing we feel to escape from the materialism of the world, about anarchy and the price it brings.
1043;But suddenly, at the end, it all came together and made sense!
1044;It explores philosophies on life and has a deep and intricate plot.
1045;It has a superb storyline (which I won't ruin) but the jist of it is exploring both sides to someone's personality.
1046;The film is also very well scripted, with extra bits that the book didn't have.
1047;But this is a true and justifiable interpretation of the novel.
1048;another great thing about this is the acting.
1049;the truth is that he is a very good acter, not just some guy with a cute ass who has wormed his way into your sister's heart.
1050;Pitt has the famous name which is perhaps why he is portrayed as the lead character (its kind of a cross between him and Norton really) but Norton is the narrater and he plays his part best in my opinion.
1051;But all three of them are fantastic.
1052;the only pitfall is that the conclusion is not very well explained as it was in the book, but this does leave the viewer asking questions which is a good thing.
1053;all in all this has everything .
1054;a great storyline plus great acting, directing and soundtrack to drive it through.
1055;Truly one of the best films I've ever seen.
1056;I have always enjoy this movie.
1057;And seeing it on Blu.
1058;ray is so much better than any other way.
1059;You got great actors, with a great director and brilliant style of this film theme.
1060;I have a strong bias for this film .
1061;it *is* my favorite .
1062;the video transfer is superb.
1063;the audio is superb (THX).
1064;the presentation material (booklet) has positive and negative reviews, in keeping with the attitude of the film.
1065;If you like the movie even a little bit, then you must experience this .
1066;great movie, it was in good condtion, no complaints here, thank thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks
1067;This is one of those rare films that keeps getting better every time you watch.
1068;Smart, subversive, funny, and just plain brilliantly crafted, Fight Club is one of the best movies of the 1990s.
1069;There's a sublime twist at the end, and it took me several viewings to catch all the subtle nuances that hinted throughout the movie that things are not as they seem.
1070;Both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt do a fantastic job in conveying a sense of hopelessness and nihilism and their violent reactions against society.
1071;scenes, production notes, and a slew of goodies on two discs.
1072;Still one of my favorite films.
1073;Fight Club is the best movie I've ever seen, but I didn't know that the first time I watched it.
1074;While the movie appears to be about the struggle of real men against the emasculating forces of modern society (most namely the scourge of Scandinavian furniture), it is actually about the struggle within one particular man ( Jack ) to discover himself.
1075;It is witty, original, and facinating.
1076;The more you watch it, the more you see and understand of both the plot and the underlying theme and purpose.
1077;Oh yeah, Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are flawless as well.
1078;It is chocked full of special features, the best of which being the commentary track including David Fincher, Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter.
1079;I could spend lots of time detailing all of my favorite features, but I can far more easily just say that they're all very cool.
1080;we begin, however, with Ed Norton's emasculated Jack, an insurance appraiser whose unchanneled emotion has made him a sag.
1081;The first half is the film is sharp black humor as Jack and Marla begin their bizarre courtship.
1082;packed urban condo and moves to the seedy edge of town near a malodorous paper mill.
1083;minded friends, both on the run from capitalistic values and their commodifying effect on human beings as well as a male.
1084;As a 30something, he's the right age.
1085;It reflects Christian mythos as well, since the scar from Jack's burn resembles one of Christ's stigmata.
1086;Their central characters are willing to pay a high price for freedom.
1087;These characters' failures and disconnections lead to a kind of endearing macho campiness, and many will be lead to sympathize with their male malaise.
1088;The movie suggests that only after this confidence and swagger is achieved can a man be a fit companion for a woman, meeting her considerable sexual and emotional power with a brand of power all his own.
1089;well acted by Pitt, Norton, and Carter
1090;Yet, this movie brings to life, on the underside, the trials and tribulations that the 20.
1091;something males of this world, and this country in particular, face from day to day.
1092;quite simply, I find this to be an absolutely amazing movie and I loved every second of it.
1093;see for everyone, particularly the younger males of this world.
1094;This is an amazing role by Norton and Pitt in which the fight between inner happiness and pleasing others.
1095;Trust me, the name tells you there is fighting, this is a fun movie that will keep you guessing the whole way through.
1096;I love their sense of humor.
1097;The characters are so finely drawn that you don't realize that nothing 'exciting' happens for the first 2/3rds of the movie.
1098;It is however a great date movie because of its slow pace (wink wink).
1099;You DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB!A brilliant translation of the book, and the special features are a treat for anyone interested in filmmaking.
1100;It is very well done and a classic (as far as I'm concerned) for any movie lover's collection.
1101;Brad Pitt also gives a great performance.
1102;It was good to see Brad and Ed act together and define the plot twist at the end genre style of movie.
1103;it's also quite interesting looking at Brad Pitt's performance as Tyler.
1104;He is capable of doing some good films, he just sometimes picks the wrong ones.
1105;In this film he kind of plays that friend you always despised in high school that grew up to be a smartass: he has answers for the questions you never ask and comes off as a know.
1106;Edward Norton gives also a good performance as almost mouse.
1107;and it's about time David Fincher starting working with effects because they're quite good.
1108;the film is quite good to watch although half the time you might not make sense of it all or criticize certain things.
1109;It sounds nice but most of us will just watch our good movie.
1110;brad Pitt has a line about guys his age being a generation of men raised by their mothers.
1111;Ladies and Gentleman, there's nothing to understand: Ed Norton is terrific, Brad Pitt is OK and you'll cringe when you see what they've done to poor MeatLoaf.
1112;analysis is going to help you understand this movie.
1113;It has to be seen.
1114;If this is the first review you've read, do yourself a favor and don't read anymore.
1115;This movie is a testament to the fact that Hollywood is running out of things to make movies about.
1116;The only thing dumber that this movie is the kids who imitate it by beating each other up.
1117;The darkness and weirdness in the film will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.
1118;that would defeat the viewer's purpose and expectations.
1119;I really enjoyed Norton's narration
1120;Brad Pitt's portrayal of Tyler is excellent.
1121;I also enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter and Meatloaf's supporting roles.
1122;Nevertheless, the film will shock you into consciousness.
1123;Fight Club is a film which explores the possibilities that our minds are capapable of, and the absolute realm of how it can go.
1124;Another startlingly genuine performance by him as well make this a movie not to be missed.
1125;This is movie making at it's best.
1126;Edward Norton and Brad Pitt take you by the shirt and hurtle you into a incredible thrill ride that will excite you from your head to toes.
1127;Using his incredible cinematrography skills to really bring the film alive, David Fincher also uses very talented actors to make 'Fight Club' a work of art.
1128;He finally finds a release within cancer groups.
1129;the film is a graphic depiction of many things, male aggression, clever humor.
1130;Clever Humor, is a big thing in this movie.
1131;Watch carefully for certain things that are pointed it out, if you don't catch them the first time (which is highly likely) watch it again, and again.
1132;In my opinion, the greatest movie ever made.
1133;Terrific casting, acting, the whole nine yards.
1134;This is not a mindless fighting movie like mortal kombat or bloodsport, it has real themes, intriguing story, and so much adrenaline that after 2 1/2 hours I didn't want it to end.
1135;Definetly the best movie of the year (possibly decade), second is Bringing Out the Dead.
1136;If the Oscars were not voted by idiots David Fincher would at least be nominated for best director.
1137;On a technical basis it is perfect.
1138;The photography and editing are flawless with the ambient Dust Bros. giving a catalyst of a score.
1139;As far as performances go Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter are great.
1140;One of the strangest movies I have seen.
1141;I will say that it did keep my attention to the end.
1142;knuckled and disfiguring confrontations with other sympathics from all walks of life.
1143;This irony leaves the intelligent viewer asking, So what is the answer?
1144;Never have I seen a movie so thought provoking, so intelligent, so dakr, or so funny.
1145;A brilliant satire, with quotable dialogue, fun and interesting characters, and a plot that'll leave you thinking for days.
1146;Simply put, 'Fight Club' is the best movie I've ever seen.
1147;And I think it's the first classic of the next century.
1148;I recommend that everybody watch this movie at least once.
1149;This is a very underrated movie that can only be challenged by the book itself.
1150;This movie is a great example of good acting in action, an incredibly humanistic message, and also a type of movie that should reach everyone.
1151;Nevermind what people say that the fights seens and the eye candy of Pitt and Norton are its one saving grace.
1152;The film in and of itself holds itself up for anyone who is open to a great message and a great story.
1153;fight club is the best, most thought provoking story ever.
1154;it is my favorite movie of all time.
1155;If you love movies that have an amazing script watch this.
1156;if you love movies that have an amazing story watch this.
1157;if you love movies that have amazing special effects watch this.
1158;if you love movies that are thought provoking and deep watch this.
1159;if you love hillarious movies watch this.
1160;if you love wierd movies watch this.
1161;this is just the best movie ever made.
1162;But still a fun ride, if you don't think too much.
1163;Everything comes together in a surprising ending that will leave you shocked and surprised.
1164;Watch the movie first, so you dont ruin the surprise.
1165;It goes much deeper into the characters.
1166;And David Fincher, as a director, knows where to put a camera to get the best angle on a scene.
1167;The packaging is excellent and the picture and audio are superb!
1168;This movie delves extremely deep into the general concensus of the working class mind and produces a fanatical satire of grand proportions.
1169;The bloogy fight are just an added bonus.
1170;This is one of the most daring films I have ever seen, including tiny details that cannot possibly be dissected or understood until the second time you see it.
1171;If you like this, go see: Requiem for a Dream, Donnie Darko, Pi, Memento, The Cube and Minority Report.
1172;Now, I think Fight Club is a great movie.
1173;I'm all for everyone having their own opinions, but personally I think it's great.
1174;Effective use of the media to control people?
1175;this movie is an experience of its own, and it is probably one of the only movies that literally changes the way you think about things.
1176;The extra stuff is great.
1177;Fight Club is a Ok movie with a great disc full of extra stuff.
1178;This was a gift for my husband.
1179;We absolutely love this movie.
1180;Its twist antics make it a must see.
1181;I bought this movie cheap, it got shipped, it arrived, it works.
1182;The disk was is new condition as advertised, and plays well.
1183;Hands down one of the best testosterone.
1184;fueled cult classic flicks ever.
1185;The fake blu ray menu intro idea is smart too
1186;An insomniac, he's found the perfect support group: Fight Club.
1187;At the heart of this support group is pure smooth.
1188;Ultimately the film is strong social commentary
1189;This is a film best seen unprepared, and I can strongly recommend it to anyone.
1190;Bought this as a gift for my husband.
1191;The movie edition is the special edition with all the special features .
1192;The movie itself is great, and the special features are very deep with several commentaries and loads of behind the scenes extras.
1193;I recommend this version for anyone who likes Fight Club considering the Steelbook edition is cheaper than just the regular special edition.
1194;He likes feeling special for once.
1195;a pretty clear statement about male and female aggression.
1196;But that's pretty much all one can say to describe Marla.
1197;Marla is truly a nothing character, despite Helena Bonham Carter's fascinating performance.
1198;Tyler is muscular and good looking in a rugged way as opposed to Edward Norton's sniveling dweeb.
1199;Tyler works at his own pace
1200;The two then get into a fight, find the experience exhilarating, and start a literal fight club in the basement of Tyler's dilapidated house.
1201;Soon, scores of men across the unnamed city they live in start showing up to beat each other up.
1202;gatherer sense of worth, and thus picks apart the biological foundation which gives worth to the male mind.
1203;This is a movie more about depression, loneliness, and desire for human connection with both friends and a lover.
1204;The gritty color, interesting characters and of course the lovely Marla Singer.
1205;I went to go see this movie because I admire the work of David Fincher very much.
1206;I must admit that, despite the graphic violence and facism involved, I truly enjoyed the movie.
1207;An interesting and disturbing take on postmodern corporate America.
1208;there are a lot of fun effects throughout this movie, and Brad Pitt and Ed Norton do a great job, as does Helena Bonham Carter.
1209;The comments on the consumer culture are the most valuable in this one, and it's clear who the writer thinks the real enemy is .
1210;Great story line with excellent actor performances.
1211;Thought provoking while still very funny and so unexpected at the end.
1212;This is proabably close to my favorite film I've ever seen.
1213;It's just spendidly done and very well crafted, you just lose yourself in the film from open to close.
1214;It also gets credit for being one of the only films (next to 'mystic river') that follows the novel so well.
1215;all until he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who is oddly stunning in this film, mixing well her 'come.
1216;hither' good looks with her 'go.
1217;beautiful if that is possible.
1218;Everything is fine and dandy until Marla rears her attractive head and soon all hell brakes loose in a rollercoaster of a film that will leave you dazzled.
1219;Its the kind of movie that plays with your head and makes you think and makes you feel.
1220;I liked it, but I didn't get it.
1221;The second time I began to see the subtle intericusies and ironic twists about the movie that I missed the first time around.
1222;its a clever movie that has reached cult level status and it deserves it to.
1223;but if you give it half a chance and watch carefully, you will watch a good movie that makes you think about where America is heading.
1224;A truly terrific movie with enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat.
1225;Edward Norton does a wonderful job of portaying a lost soul out of place in today's society.
1226;Brad Pitt is wonderful in a performance that could have been so easily over the top.
1227;this is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time.
1228;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
1229;it is very high on the list.
1230;Brad Pitt gives such a convincing performance as the do.
1231;The acting is down right convincing and is helped by the unbelievable screenplay.
1232;Then they take it a step further and, well, I shouldn't say more because of the ending.
1233;It will not make sense at first but then you can see it.
1234;They are the reason that this movie is beyond your minds capacity.
1235;So just watch it again and you will find it.
1236;It has so many interesting and provocative points on life, women, men, society, leaders, brothers, government, movies, homosexuality (this might take some time to figure out), heterosexuality, puberty in your 30's, and the list is endless.
1237;If you thought that those are some odd points, wait till you see the movie.
1238;this film is dark and always in your face.
1239;A note to everyone: Go see this movie with an open mind.
1240;This movie has all of that in one.
1241;Another point is that this plot has so many stories hidden within the obvious that you will HAVE to see it again.You should love this movie's forceful views on society.
1242;It is a hidden masterpiece that will never cease to entertain the viewer.
1243;What we have in this movie is another variation on Quentin Tarantino's style.
1244;Will the extras make an average movie worth including in my personal library?
1245;I loved the twist at the end.
1246;I waited a long time to watch this movie but it is definitely a must have.
1247;For me this movie was the most entertaining flick of 99.
1248;Well, fc is as good, you bet!
1249;It's hilariously funny and thought provoking.
1250;The acting is great and the direction is fantastic.
1251;All in all it's one of the best films I have ever seen.
1252;David Fincher did a great job translating the marvelous and twisted mind of Chuck Palahniuk's masterpiece into a living legend.
1253;This film brilliantly portrays a man losing his grip.
1254;Violent yet beautiful, dramatic yet comic.
1255;Excellent performances from one of the best actors around, Norton, and also from Pitt.
1256;Should have won academy awards being one of the top 2 movies last year.
1257;Fight Club is one of my favorite films, and certainly one of the best films of 1999.
1258;I needed this for a movie about possible psychological disorders for school, so this worked great especially because my group decided to do this movie.
1259;This movie is a watch for anyone to see two sides of people and how to further enjoy your life.
1260;I recently rewatched this movie for a philosophy through film class, and was quite intrigued with the underlying messages.
1261;Whether or not the director intended it, the movie has very interesting ties to Buddhism, making the movie deeper than I initially had thought.
1262;Overall, it's just a really unique and interesting movie.
1263;the film's ending was unquestioningly impressive.
1264;ness, I found it rather inobtrusive, and unpredictable, giving the film very satisfying closure.
1265;carter to be incredibly sublime, and the cinematography to have a real gritty feel to it.
1266;star film in my book!
1267;Its a gritty, violent cut of the life of a middle of the road 'suit'.
1268;The story will blow your mind and the philosophy is amazing.
1269;This is one movie you must see.
1270;he has a job, a condo, and all the things a person needs to be who they want to be.
1271;fight club was an original and thought provocing journey into the human mind and emotion.
1272;if you have already seen this film, which im sure most of you have, the special edition adds so much more.
1273;on top of the 133 minutes of film you receive an extra 45.60 mins of behind the scenes, making of, and even some deleted scenes.
1274;1960's Art Deco swanky san Juan tourist trap with fast cars affluent inner circles and gorgeous flirty blonde angels pop up everywhere.
1275;To enjoy this movie you have to be the kind of person that's able to let go and find the fun in life n
1276;Firstly, director David FINCHER, along with his art director, has created a unique artistic vision of Edward Norton's sick point of view.
1277;Fincher, with a few arty effects and very good monologs, is able to create very quickly uneasiness and tension.
1278;This movie is a classic, and I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.
1279;It was going to happen eventually, a movie that lived up to the book so well.
1280;The packaging along was worth my 20 bucks.
1281;The booklet has positive AND negative reviews of the movie!
1282;Cut scenes, commercials, trailers, special effects shots, behnd the scenes.
1283;If you've read the book, the movie is, for once, pretty close to it!
1284;This is one of my absolute favorite movies!
1285;this has to be Dave Fincher's best work yet.
1286;Fight Club is one of the most beloved movies of all time.
1287;It weaves a tapestry of cinema that simultaneously constructs two realities.
1288;It's a movie truly deserving of second viewing just so you can observe how intricately constructed the film is, particularly in ways you might not have noticed the full way through.
1289;As a thoughtful movie, it is a poseur, continually touching on philosophical issues without delving too deep.
1290;Hollow though it is, Fight Club is still a great movie.
1291;If you think this is a great film, I recommend you read the book and really think about it.
1292;If you still think it's a great film, well.
1293;Pure and simple great film.
1294;Brad Pittt is excellent in this movie.
1295;This is Fincher at his best.
1296;Even in Alien 3 you could see the man has more talent than the rest of Hollywood combined.
1297;Every movie keep getting better.
1298;Seven and The Games hinted at what we see in Fight Club.
1299;a Brilliant movie by a brilliant director.
1300;The disruption of the social ethic is his prime motivation.
1301;Consequently, the Fight Club is formed, a secret society of like.
1302;But, the first rule of Fight Club is that you don't talk about Fight Club , and with the movie it's true too: here I depart from plot details.
1303;Hoisted up to greatness by Fincher's incredible vision and by career best performances from both Norton and Pitt, it is one of those rare films that is quite unlike anything that has preceded it.
1304;It is intelligent, funny, ultra.
1305;throw aside your expectations, Fight Club is a modern masterpiece of the dark fantastic.
1306;I can't relate to this but I can understand it.
1307;This film presents very frightning ideas to the American culture.
1308;And that idea is freedom in its purist form.
1309;focused our energy away from shopping at the Gap and conentrated on say, health care issue, or cancer research.
1310;our great depression is our lives.
1311;It is a story that provides a way to combat the people that provide the comforts that we don't need.
1312;Suberbly shot, edited and performed, this is a text that film students will be studying in the near future as I'm sure it will eventually achieve classic status.
1313;this film has a great first act and shows signs of becoming a first.
1314;rate indictment of our commercial culture (never mind the irony that it comes in the form of a big Hollywood movie).
1315;One of those few movies that you will enjoy watching and get you thinking at the same time.
1316;I read somewhere that if you are an anarchist, you will love this film.
1317;Maybe I just prefer a good old fashioned Bond film with some style and ahem, good looking women as opposed to.
1318;David Fincher definitely has guts.
1319;It is a film director's dream come true.
1320;They are perfect counterparts, one out of touch with his own manhood, the other a man who wallows in it.
1321;Everything is going fine until a woman named Marla (Helena Bonham Carter, sexy and snake.
1322;But the fine points of the plot never really matter.
1323;The performances are all top.
1324;The twisted sense of humor of writer Jim Uhls and the fluid, breathtaking direction of David Fincher makes this film more like a rollercoaster then an endurence test.
1325;You're retching but laughing all the while.
1326;literally days worth of extras are packed onto the two discs.
1327;The plot/story line shifts several times throughout this movie, keeping it interesting.
1328;There are a lot of cool lines and funny situations (eg.
1329;The book was good, the movie was better.
1330;I had to watch the movie 'Panic Room' the other day, since it was also directed by David Fincher.
1331;This is also one of those movies you can't get out of your head.
1332;this movie is for you.
1333;One of the greatest films I've ever seen.
1334;If you get off on seeing guys beat each other up, you love old Arnold, Sly and Bruce Willis movies, if you spend your entire day on Sunday in front of the TV watching football .
1335;this movie is above your head .
1336;breaking and funny at the same time.
1337;1999 was the best year for movies in a long time.
1338;We had 'The Sixth Sense', 'The Matrix', 'Being John Malkovich', and the best of them all, 'Fight Club'.
1339;The sets, subtle computer animation, and brilliant editing combine to create a masterfully produced picture.
1340;I especially enjoyed the special effects documentaries.
1341;This movie is a love story.
1342;This movie is smart, funny, horrible, sad and clever.
1343;One of my personal favs and one of the few books that was translated perfectly to the big screen (Misery with Kathy Bates is another).
1344;I absolutely love this movie but I can't tell you why.
1345;The late director, Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, Clockwork Orange is a better movie than Fight Club.
1346;Fukuyama argued a few years ago that perhaps our society will evolve to the point where we have essentially accomplished all that can be hoped for in satisfying our essential needs.
1347;I usually dislike movies with a strong anti.
1348;This is the economic system which has greatly improved the lives of many throughout the world.
1349;the Italian Fascist, Benito Mussolini, had a deep intense hatred for logical thinking and the values of democratic civilization.
1350;This superb study of British hooligans who relish beating up innocent people at soccer games complements Fight Club.
1351;It was a very complex film with an amazing twist that just seemed to make sense.
1352;Suave and stylish direction gave this film a raw edge.
1353;Gets better with every viewing!
1354;I love the actors involved.
1355;Fight Club is the Taxi Driver of our times and Ed Norton is the DeNiro of his generation.
1356;they're are some wonderful ideas in the film, ie, when Pitt tells Norton that soap was created by the ashes of heroes.
1357;There's more but that's all I'll say on that.
1358;It's just well presented here.
1359;I also got the soundtrack.
1360;fight Club is destined to become a cult classic like Taxi Driver.
1361;I'm just throwing my coin of best movie ever into the best movie ever pot.
1362;One of the best films ever made!
1363;Dark, brutal, funny and totally unforgetable.
1364;got it in good time and is a great movie.
1365;Blood, Guts and Gore!Now that I've got your attention, here's the ultimate fight movie with more twists than an Olympic gymnast.
1366;Two great young actors, in Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both could have competed for screen presence in an attempt to out do each other.
1367;The end result still is a great movie
1368;hearted, but one that will make you think about and question your place in society.
1369;it will question whether you can really escape that, create another kind of society that will actually work, which it doesn't.
1370;the stability of the soul.
1371;i'm going to hold back on saying over and over again that this is the best movie to come out of the '90s and will have a cult following the likes clockerwork orange has only seen .
1372;Fight Club is pretty much one of those movies that is a must have for anyone who loves movies.
1373;The bonus features on this disc are simply fantastic and provide both casual and hardcore fans of the movie a chance to see behind the curtain and all the work going into this masterpiece.
1374;I recommend this to anyone who loves this movie and hasn't yet made the leap to Blu Ray.
1375;very happy with it thank you very much!
1376;Very excited to give this to my boyfriend when he gets home in a week.
1377;The film opens into a surprising perspective, but it was not a film I really enjoyed watching.
1378;This is a Classic and my son wanted it on Blu Ray as a gift.
1379;No issues, plays great, Quick Shipping and nice packaging for the Anniversary edition.
1380;Best price here on Amazon compared to local retail.
1381;First, the commentary tracks are superb and offer insights into many aspects of the film ranging from its meaning to its construction.
1382;The commentary with David Fincher, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter is especially enjoyable and makes you feel as if you are in the room watching with them.
1383;At some points it feels as if Helena Bonham Carter's dialogue is injected which leads me to believe that her comments were recorded seperately and that detracts from the comradarie a little bit, but it is still well worth listening to.
1384;The track with David Fincher is very interesting as well especially if you consider, as I do, this man to be among the best directors working today.
1385;He goes into detail about the trials of converting his vision into reality and it is a wonderful insight into the craft of filmaking.
1386;The track with Chuck Palahnuik is very good as well, he seems just tickled to see the movie and is delighted with how well his concept came across on the big screen.
1387;Not that this movie says it's a good idea to go out and punch someone in the face, but it definitely does challenge you to think about a few things.
1388;He works for an auto insurance company and spends most of his time and money building the perfect 21st century apartment, complete with all the essentials
1389;bike, a personal home office unit, and plates with little bubbles inside them, not to mention a wardrobe that was almost complete and getting very respectable.
1390;These support groups become his new life, and for a time he finds happiness with them.
1391;That is, until another faker, Marla Singer, starts going to Jack's beloved support groups as well.
1392;Tyler agrees to meet Jack for a drink, and the 2 of them engage in the first of many philosophical discussions throuoghout the movie, the basis of this one being whether or not Jack is better off without the apartment.
1393;Tyler agrees, but with one condition
1394;The 2 continue fighting, and eventually involve others who gather around them.
1395;Jack finds the same release he found through crying by fighting, and is very taken by his new found interest.
1396;speaking from a strictly cinematic standpoint, this is a truly remarkable film.
1397;The directing, the writing, and the acting are all top notch.
1398;Norton is absolutely incredible as Jack and shows that he will most likely go on to be remembered as one of the greatest actors in the history of film.
1399;His expressiveness is amazing and he brings the character to life like no one else could have.
1400;Pitt is also great as Durden and brings a mesmerizing presence to the screen.
1401;Watching Tyler rant about the demasculinization (I hope that's a real word) of men in modern society is fantastic.
1402;Helena Bonham Carter is also impressive as Marla, the only female character in the movie.
1403;She was a great choice for the character.
1404;Fincher's direction is also phenomenal.
1405;The camera work is great and the dark lighting sets a very fitting mood for the movie.
1406;The dialogue is clever, original, insightful, and anything and everything else good dialogue should be.
1407;this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
1408;It's creativity is outstanding and the performances are magnificient, plus it never gets boring and the plot twists are great.
1409;I reccommend this movie very highly to anyone who appreciates originality and creativity in cinema.
1410;UPDATED REVIEW 16/01/2013One of the best movies ever made: An exercise in visual philosophy, using all technical resources to illustrate and narrate a mental imaginary and machinations based plotline.
1411;He shows him how to escape from fear.
1412;This masterpiece exercises and puts forth visual philosophy, displaying what would be a modern version of Zen enlightenment exercises or Koans.
1413;fighting is a start
1414;Crazy, unorthodox yet effective, and more important in a movie: entertaining.
1415;finally, Jack evolves towards love, the main driver from the start.
1416;The movie is a love story.
1417;He develops his personality and is able to express caring for a female and start a relationship and integrates his psyche, destroying his overpowering superego.
1418;a beautifully aesthetically stunning crafted movie, fluid as our thouth processes are.
1419;From the start it displays a voyage through the brain's fear center.
1420;As a fable that it is, the use of special effects and creative, aggressive, edgy cinematography suspends your disbelief into a journey in a very human experience, a tale about our war.
1421;Interwoven masterfully are the elements of a man's struggle with this disease and fighting our war.
1422;Director David Fincher, who brought us into the extraordinarily depraved serial.
1423;killer world of Se7en (1995), fires up the shock cauldron again with this high testosterone examination of our primal need to seek adrenaline highs through physical violence.
1424;meanwhile he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) a handsome and virile beauty soap salesman who is quick with the banter and has the confidence of a demi.
1425;They become best buds (and a bit more) after Durden introduces him to the full.
1426;The strange thing is a lot of the scenes are funny!
1427;breasted Bob Paulson is excellent.
1428;Norton's confused and determined whimsy is nicely off.
1429;The story plays out well with some nice surprises and some good tension.
1430;A return to the jungle (for example, by watching this film) energizes us and reminds us that part of our nature is largely incompatible with civilization.
1431;Fincher's primary intent is to shock, and he works hard at that.
1432;When one of the bags holding human fat gets snagged on a barbed wire fence, it bursts, dripping it contents onto the Narrator.
1433;Fight Club is clearly one of the best movies that came out in 99.
1434;Brad Pitt and David Fincher team up again succesfully for a very pop cultured film with plenty of action and fight sequences.
1435;popular Horror Film wave that comes along every few years.
1436;Rarely does a film with such depth and wonder come along.
1437;it is rare that such a film would be widley accpeted by the masses.Yet Fight Club has accomplished all this and so much more.
1438;The use of cinematogrpahy, costumes, symbolism, the acting, the direction, the dialogue, the screenplay, and just about everything about this movie truly reaches maximum potential.
1439;the movie follows Edward Norton through his most unusual journey to enlightenment and freedom.
1440;And trust me, I've watched it hundreds of times), and a fantastically well done twist at the end (which makes you want to go back and watch the movie again and again until you've discovered all the aspects that now seem to make so much more sense in light of the end twist), Fight Club gives us a dark, disturbing, satirical, and often hilarious view of the society we live in.
1441;the spectacular performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonhem Cater show how incredible these actors can really be and have resulted in my undying respect for them (a respect that, before this movie, was highly underdeveloped or non.
1442;It gives spectacular insight into the making of the film, the message of the film, and much more.
1443;I also recommend the book Fight Club by Chuck Phalahniuk.
1444;Let me tell you why you should own this film: 1) It ranks at the high end of the re.
1445;This is a great movie starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.
1446;The performances are great and the twists are unexpected.
1447;One of the most fun and entertaining movies I've seen.
1448;I love this movie, totally worth the 9.99 blu.
1449;He took the two best actors of this generation and made a perfect blend.
1450;he made a great satire of the modern american way of life.
1451;It is very hard to find in the movie history a contreversal movie with the best picture award.
1452;i guess i'll just enjoy it knowing that this movie is the best picture of the year.
1453;this is a great movie .
1454;great story and a must own!
1455;I bought this for my husband but I love it as well.
1456;This is such a great story, I recommend this movie!
1457;A great story and a good partner for tales like Bobcat Goldthwait's excellent God Bless America.
1458;The illusion of reality appeals to me, which is why I so thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
1459;And the catalyst to said enlightenment is Norton's unique friend Tyler (Brad Pitt is terrific), who of course is the unnamed protagonist's alter.
1460;ego (the articulate and ingenious invisible friend we all have).
1461;FIGHT CLUB is clever, grotesque, insightful, often funny, yet as it builds towards its inevitable over.
1462;Helena Bonham Carter as a gothic nonconformist girlfriend fits right in, and even Meat Loaf swings a pudgy arm in metaphorical tribute to this delightfully quirky film.
1463;A surprise film defined: just when you think you know what's going on.
1464;Director David Fincher (Se7en, The Game) does another psychological number on us with this one.
1465;From a technical standpoint, the cinematography was great.
1466;the angles alone made for an entertaining film to watch.
1467;edward Norton (Rounders, Primal Fear) gives a captivating performance as a basic white.
1468;The story is mostly narrated by Norton which is useful in giving us a little more background than we might have had otherwise, and it works well.
1469;pitt also performed well, and was enjoyable in this role when he was being something of a visionary as well as when he was just downright devious.
1470;Carter does an excellent job in this role and definitely seems to have shed any traces of her previous period work.
1471;another surprise in this film was Meat Loaf in the part of Bob, a guy with testicular cancer that you end up really feeling for thanks to Meat Loaf's performance.
1472;But the film has so much more to it that you can't help but be fascinated anyway.
1473;Happily, the film actually holds up to the accolades.
1474;ride, Fight Club soon distinguishes itself, at first by its performances.
1475;key conviction scores again
1476;Director David Fincher remains one of those directors who could use the limited Pitt effectively, and Pitt is great in this film .
1477;using his impressive physicality to the max, staying within his range, and working like a charm.
1478;Thankfully, Fincher concocts another visually impressive, visceral ending to bring life back into the film, and Norton in the final reel is a delight as he struggles with his identity crisis.
1479;Having seen two of the three and discovered that both hold up technically as well as narratively and dramatically, I'm looking forward to Being John Malkovich.
1480;Thankfully, I'd bought the double.
1481;the movie itself is a triumph, a nice little send.
1482;The Narrator (henceforth referred to as Jack) lives a comfortable life: a good job with a major car company, a large apartment, plenty of cash, IKEA furniture .
1483;as films go, this is probably in my top 10, definitely in my top 25 films of all time.
1484;Fincher does an amazing job directing, using CGI in inventive, sparing ways.
1485;Brad Pitt continued with his success on Se7en and pulls off a great Tyler.
1486;Ed Norton plays the perfect begrudged IKEA.
1487;to be honest, I hated, despises her character the first time I saw this, but I find her more likable with each watching.
1488;The real surprise of this movie was Meat Loaf, who play sensitive bodybuilder Bob .
1489;as for special features, this is a pretty darn nice collection.
1490;two special effects shots for the ending) which are interesting.
1491;The fashion designs are .
1492;the real gem of the second disc, at least, is the Publicity Gallery.
1493;I doubt I'll be allowed to repeat Tylers's, but Jack says, out of the blue Remember: NO ONE has the right to touch you in your bathing suit area!
1494;disc edition contains everything on the first disc, which is pretty much the commentary.
1495;Fight Clubs evokes passionate responses
1496;Fincher is, without a doubt, a talented director with a visual style all of his own
1497;handed, relaying its meaning and themes with blinders on.
1498;among relatively new directors, Fincher is at the head of his class
1499;It's a treat to see, for example, how well he combines CGI techniques with traditional camerawork in this film.
1500;But his direction is far from perfect.
1501;While it's not a fault of the film by any means, my other problem with Fight Club is the mythic status it has attained among specific segments of the movie.
1502;i am jack's happy consumer.
1503;jack and Tyler use the word, clever in a conversational irony, at first meeting, that is a thought provoking glimpse to the audience, which hints the nemesis in the movie's content, and the trigger of unleashing Jack's suppressed emotional entrapment.
1504;It was smart, well intended, yadda yadda yadda .
1505;To me it conveyed a very similar message with more creativity, more mystery and more raw energy than American Beauty could even imagine.
1506;was excellent and HBC was brilliantly freaky and vulnerable at the same time.
1507;Gotta love that Valley of the Dolls reference when she walks out of the house!
1508;If you like watching guys fight, you'll love this film.
1509;Includes many memorable lines on breaking free from the bonds of societal expectation.
1510;highlight: Norton's oh so funny cubical chats with his boss.
1511;And it said it with such a punch!
1512;fist matches and tough guy antics.
1513;David Fincher is one of the masters of modern cinema, this is by far, one of his best works.
1514;norton and Pitt perform flawlessly.
1515;Fight Club has to be one of the best films I have seen in years.
1516;A complex, well acted, beautifully flimed drama about one man's descent into madness, it is alive with dark humor, violent action, emotional turmoil, skillful plotting and really insightful commentary on social life and society at century's end.
1517;ed Norton and Brad Pitt are exceptional.
1518;an edgy give and take that is at the heart of the film's exciting dynamic.
1519;Meat Loaf, in a surprisingly touching characterization, brings more to the screen .
1520;But it is worthwhile to point out what the film is not
1521;Fight club gives its members confidence, provides a chance for them to express their anger and aggression, creates contact and bonding, fills the emptiness and gives them purpose.
1522;there is lots of savage humor in this film.
1523;Many of Pitt's lines and a lot of Norton's voice.
1524;over narration are both memorable and funny.
1525;If you've got the stomach for it, this is one great entertainment and a fine serious film at the same time.
1526;Tyler seems untouchable, surrounded by his aura of confidence and an army of fanatics.
1527;The twist just made the movie more interesting psychologically, and the action afterwards was great, very intense.
1528;Some very humorous bits, some great camera tricks, and some great action, plus psychological thrills and an interesting philosophy.
1529;Fight Club is that piece of modern art in a museum that everyone hates transformed into the form of a movie script.
1530;The many innovative features and designs in the spirit of the movie, such as hidden message during the 'Anti.
1531;The movie is just incredible, and if it does not justify it yet, the bonus features are intense.
1532;just one private note .
1533;It's a rapidly escalating thrill ride that never hesitates to crank the dial a bit further, and the progression from droll normalcy to vulgar aggression to unsettling calm in the face of a genuine revolution is stunning.
1534;On top of all that, the film's wit is off the charts, still intelligent and amusing after two dozen viewings
1535;smeared musings on the nature of modern masculinity remain timely even today.
1536;I actually get shivers every time I revisit particular scenes, with the biggest one coming .
1537;That's what I call an impressive parting shot.
1538;A smart, funny, thrilling, unpredictable modern classic that never takes the easy road.
1539;What I got was one of the strangest films I've ever seen, with a perfectly dark world of no.
1540;ed Norton fit perfectly into the role of the disaffected yuppy and Brad Pitt was absolutely amazing as the outspoken and maniacal Tyler Durden.
1541;The interaction between the two was perfect.
1542;Rarely have I seen an on screen duo with the chemistry that these two portrayed.
1543;the plot to this film was responsible for making it such a masterpiece.
1544;top seemed logical, and, at times unavoidable offshoots of the original concept of a Fight Club.
1545;i also have to mention the cinematography.
1546;The boldness of the cinematography is what makes it so perfect.
1547;fight Club is a haunting masterpiece, a warning against our own material obsession and our primal pursuit of freedom.
1548;It forces us to accept this duality in our nature, and vividly depicts the eternal ultimatum of denying or listening to our inner voice and the chilling results of either choice.
1549;Maybe one of the best films of the last 10 years.
1550;But in reality, it's a modern day parable about consumerist culture.
1551;The fact this film is also very funny, will probably pass unnoticed by many.
1552;The movie Fight Club is a very respectable movie.
1553;It puts you inside the mind of a psychopath who doesn't know what he's doing when he goes to sleep.
1554;I would have given 4 stars but I'm satisfied with the 3 and a 1/2 stars it received.
1555;the film gently escorts the viewer along with the premise that the average life is awful so lets start fight clubs and hit each other.
1556;the harmless fight clubs have the same form and structure as the terroristic Project Mayhem, so the film tries to convince the viewer that if Fight Clubs are good, terroristic Project Mayhem is good.
1557;The film doesnt even make sense in its own perverted world view.
1558;It's part action film, part satire, part comedy.
1559;A strange and unique blend that really works.
1560;If you haven't seen Fight Club, be prepared, it's a movie that definitely has to grow on you.
1561;Then I read the book by Chuck Palahniuk, and began to find myself really liking the story.
1562;Fight Club is a very dark film with a lot of deep dark tones.
1563;the Sound: Fight Club features truly fantastic 5.
1564;l Dolby Digital audio track which is used very well by both the movies sound effects and the excellent score by the Dust Brothers.
1565;the Extras: Fight Club is so packed to the gills with special features, I found myself spending as much time watching the special features as I did the movie.
1566;There are so many layers to this film and these two tracks really flesh out many of the subtleties and meaning which make Fight Club such an amazing movie.
1567;Of special note are the Fight Club Internet Ads which are extremely entertaining as well as 2 PSA's which are just hilarious.
1568;The world given to us in 'Fight Club', Tyler's world, is one, at least to me, of hope: When we are free of our comforts, when we are free of the sofas, and the televisions, even our money, when the only thing left to value is ourselves and the other living creatures around us, only then can we truly know emotion and feel for those 'closest' to us.
1569;I deeply connected with its anti.
1570;capitalist message, in that money sucks away true emotion.
1571;And this movie is an effective prophet of that concept .
1572;this movie, and the book(which is absolutely brilliant and flawless), have completely changed my life, and opened my eyes to the underlying meaning beneanth the things in my existence.
1573;Watch this movie, open yourself, and let go.
1574;This is the best movie ever!!!
1575;After years of watching this movie repeatedly, I finally got the collectors addition.
1576;Worth every 1 of the 10 dollars I spent!!!
1577;Be honest with yourself, did you notice the Brad Pitt Blips the first time?
1578;whether you did or not, this movie is one of the best.
1579;this comedy is pitch black and brought to you by Director David Fincher as an adaptation of a novel by now famed writer Chuck Palahniuk.
1580;Ed Norton and Brad Pitt give a most incredible performance made sharp by the script and sweet visual effects.
1581;He eventually meets Pitt's character on a plane ride home.
1582;In my opinion, the greatest movie ever made.
1583;Terrific casting, acting, the whole nine yards.
1584;Interesting surprise towards the climax but at that point I just wanted everyone to die anyway.
1585;Watch it, you'll like this movie.
1586;And be sure to pay attention at the surprising end.
1587;It is the best movie ever.
1588;The film starts out with plenty of excellent ideas, but by the time it's half.
1589;If a movie that has a balance between brilliant cinematogaphy and story is what you want, watch any Ridley Scott or Francis Ford Copolla film.
1590;Like I said, Fight Club has plenty of good ideas, but it's just not done right.
1591;The man and his imaginary friend get into a lot of fights and fall in love with a pretty lady.
1592;If you like movies you might enjoy this film.
1593;This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.
1594;This was a gift for my future brother in law and he LOVED IT!!
1595;This is one of his favorite movies, but he did not own this edition.
1596;I would definitely recommend this for anyone who loves the movie or anyone who has never seen it.
1597;Knowing that he hangs with creative, rebellious inciteful people, I got a copy.
1598;The movie challenges socially constructed ideas of masculinity in several ways.
1599;this is a disturbing movie, but well worth the time to watch .
1600;But remember, it's just a movie, as the characters keep reminding us.
1601;I ask myself why it is that we dont act as the movie tells us.
1602;Well i suggest you to watch it and listen to Durden words of wisdom.
1603;This will be one of my favorite movies always, my review is just for all the bonus material that you receive.
1604;It's great for the price.
1605;Fight Club features Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in what must be one of the best movies of their careers.
1606;carter is the explosive, volatile Marla, who the protagonists meets at support groups.
1607;Edward Norton's character explores this question as he struggles with his own demons.
1608;Fight Club's powerful plot will keep you on the edge of your seat until its painful, climactic ending.
1609;Much more than just another flashy action flick, Fight Club delivers more wit and energy than the last five movies you've seen.
1610;This is an amazingly kinetic experience, and credit must be spread generously: Stars Norton (as the burned.
1611;modern James Dean) are both excellent
1612;pieces that only seldom seem gratuitous
1613;Not really an ode to mindless nihilism, it is more thoughtful and sophisticated than the fight.
1614;power diatribe some people make it out to be
1615;I even thought it was uplifting in its own way.
1616;From the opening scene to the end this is a film that stands out and says: funny, intelligent, thought provoking and memorable .
1617;a fascinating little picture of a journey towards wholeness.
1618;This is the best movie ever made.
1619;So cool, and I love the twist.
1620;Definitely worth the 3 dollars I spent 3
1621;But that difference was good .
1622;This is my favorite movie to date, and it never fails to captivate the audience with every showing.
1623;Forever a must see, and forever in my heart, with brilliant acting and writing.
1624;I recommend this seller to everyone.
1625;I'm sorta taking the middle ground.
1626;This movie deals with what I call easy philosophical ideas.
1627;On the flip side the film is very witty and has a strangely liberating ending.
1628;I'm giving the film 2 stars because it's showcases the talented directoral efforts of Fincher who is an excellent visual composer.
1629;Seven is a far superior and thrilling film.
1630;David Fincher really does stay true to the spirit of the book .
1631;the x. generation's own bible in a mind.
1632;one holds the movie, while the other holds really cool extra features and makings of.
1633;it is a must to all of you guys out there who saw the film and liked it.
1634;Fight Club which is stared mainly by: Edward Norton, Bradd Pitt and Hellna Bonham Carter, is one of the best movies that been made in past few years.
1635;its because of the idea behind its plot, the plot of the movie is the kind that developed with mach thought throughout the movie.
1636;in conclusion i recomend this movie to anyone that likes to watch good movies.
1637;I really enjoyed Fight Club.
1638;Edward Norton does an absolutely excellent job portraying our narrator ( Jack ).
1639;with price tags on everything visible.
1640;I just loved this movie.
1641;I give it 5 stars.
1642;It has got so many extras on the supplemental disc .
1643;I am so glad I bought it.
1644;but please, please, see Fight Club for yourself and you decide.
1645;I liked Fight Club when I saw it in the theater, but the main plot twist frankly took most of my attention.
1646;With each viewing it seems more impossible that any major studio would even touch this movie!
1647;The main commentary track, with Norton, Pitt, Carter, and Filcher, is the most interesting, and the one I'd suggest you listen to after watching the movie a few times.
1648;Packed with tons of special features, easy interactivity from pop.
1649;the story is subtle, complex, and comes crashing by like a runaway train.
1650;every one from the camera man to the cast is simply incredible
1651;At the end of the day, this movie is about truth in self.
1652;So take it all in, breath it in, and ask yourself do I conform or do I act on my own?
1653;It's kinda like an introspective documentary, seasoned with blood sweat and tears, wrapped with banality, and with side orders of dark humour and fist.
1654;Think again and then see this movie.
1655;It will take you and a journey into the darkest reaches of the human psyche that you may scare yourself when you realize how much you are enjoying this movie.
1656;fight Club is the story of pure disturbing genius.
1657;this movie is so much more than just the story of some guys who get together and beat eachother up.
1658;I'd say that it is destined to achieve cult status, with myself strongly in tow.
1659;Fincher does an excellent job of keeping to the heart of the book and each actor, not a single exception, does an incredible job of fleshing out their character's dramatic and humorous potential.
1660;This is one of the truly good films of the Nineties.
1661;This movie is so good.
1662;Its thrilling, its full of action, and it has a point.
1663;This may have been one of the best movies ive ever seen in the aspects of what this movie is doing.
1664;The plot was very good with a lot of detail and build up.
1665;This is a a thinker movie.
1666;Fight Club is a one of a kind movie to my knowledge.
1667;It's a highly entertaining film if you don't mind violence and a bit of blood and brutality.
1668;edward Norton delivers another outstanding performance in another off.
1669;Brad Pitt's best performance since 12 Monkeys as he portrays another character that will have you hooked.
1670;Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of the freakish girlfriend will have you laughing and staring wide eyed
1671;meat Loaf was a great addition to this movie.
1672;His small role as Bob adds a great bit of comic relief and understanding to the film.
1673;You won't fully appreciate it until you get to the shocking ending, but this one is worth more than one viewing!
1674;The cast backs him up with intensity and bravado.
1675;appointed morality squads, or for those interested in mere entertainment.
1676;but others hit you like a bullet between the eyes.
1677;These scenes, though humorous at times, touch on deep felt longings and feelings in us all.
1678;His own shallowness, reflected through her, becomes a thorn in his side.
1679;social life, pursuing answers and meaning in a world ruled by capitalistic emptiness.
1680;And the two set out to be free men by casting aside most things society holds dear.
1681;The results of their soul.
1682;It works good and arrived on time and in great shape.
1683;Those who wanted to see Brad Pitt saw Brad Pitt and paid little mind to the brilliant story brought to us by one of the finest new American authors, Chuck Palaniuk.
1684;some wonderful things about this movie, not giving anything away, are that the characters that are fighting the above mentioned institutions are also willing participants in making them as successful as they are, and the body count is as low as a big budget Hollywood film has been in years.
1685;as a film, it stands out as one of the most creative and beautifully shot movies this year.
1686;David Fincher, not being bound by convention, made one of the best adaptations from novel to screen ever with Fight Club.
1687;this film will speak to everyone.
1688;To others it will touch a place you never knew you had in you.
1689;See the movie for a demonstration.
1690;Interesting things about the nature of our commercial identities and more.
1691;Yet also fun and good action, and plot with twists and turns.
1692;This is bold, bruising humor alright!
1693;It's a bit complex to explain anything about this movie since it's one of those psychological comedies.
1694;The therapy shockingly works for Jack and the whole system is topped with rules.
1695;The bottomline is that this movie delivers no remorse with pure style.
1696;Booming with a soundtrack by the Dust Brothers and a concept so worth picking the title up for.
1697;Both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give terrific performances.
1698;My favorite scene has got to be when Jack beats himself up in front of his boss.
1699;This film is without a doubt one of the most stylistic and smart films I have seen, and is definetly Edward Norton's best film.
1700;This will make him happy right?
1701;And thus, an insomniac is born.
1702;It's the mental breakdown of Norton, and his split personalities that I found totally original in the film, and how this is brought to a conclusion that floored me.
1703;The ending of the film is one of the best I have ever seen.
1704;A great film, and highly recommended.
1705;Fight Club is regarded by some as one of the greatest films of Norton and Pitt's careers.
1706;Now that I finally own it
1707;It's really neat because it also flips open to reveal more art.
1708;The menu has a nice gag placed by David Fincher.
1709;Fight Club is my favorite movie of all time.
1710;Intelligence (actual intelligence), romance, sadness, comedy, and suspense (in a way).
1711;Ed Norton and Brad Pitt have such a chemistry, it's amazing.
1712;Two incredible actors together in one of the most twisted, yet awesome story lines.
1713;This is one of those movies that you either love, or you hate.
1714;Which is one of this charms.
1715;Watch it, and watch all of it, or you'll be confused beyond all belief.
1716;This movie has become my favorite.
1717;view a few years ago, and found it so interesting that I watched it three times that day.
1718;i like the fact that the movie has so many layers.
1719;Its in your face but its also subtle.
1720;Yes, this movie has profound moments.
1721;Edward Norton and Brad Pitt combine to make one spectacular half of a movie.
1722;Jack and Tyler Durden are superb characters that everyone can relate to in one respect or another.
1723;while his early stuff is good, very little stands out in his later career other than this!
1724;Easily one of my favourite films of all time.
1725;The cast is amazing, the story is strangely relatable but otherworldly, and the twist was perfectly mind blowing!
1726;i just wanna say this film is really good.
1727;i like twist in flicks and this got best u will meet.
1728;Yes the fars for I've seen the enemy and he is our cologne so we must fart and watch this wonderful movie.
1729;I loved the movie, but I thought the price for amazon instant stream is a little on the high side.
1730;Based off of Chuck's book by the same title, Fight Club is a masterful blend of action, thrill, psychology, romance, comedy, and critique on American consumerism and what it does to those of us that can't seem to break our norms.
1731;a fantastic movie for all who just want to wake up and smell the nitroglycerin.
1732;And what a club it is.
1733;In a movie where all the morals go out the window
1734;It has laughs, thrills, and even psychological misfits.
1735;A perfect love traingle story with men beating the crap out of each other.
1736;but if you are interested in passion and poetry, being fully alive while you've still got a pulse, this movie is worth checking out.
1737;That pretty much captures the theme of Fight Club, a film about a man with insomnia who sleepwalks through his empty life and well.
1738;But it's also pretty funny in parts.
1739;This is really more a film about the human condition, and mind.
1740;ed Norton's narrative in this movie is truly hypnotic, as are the visuals.
1741;It's a well written, well acted, beautifully filmed thought provoking movie.
1742;establishment message, but I throughly enjoyed the movie nonetheless.
1743;There are a lot of thought provoking comments and moments in the movie that might just make you rethink certain elements and behaviors in your own life.
1744;it's an interesting look at how we perceive ourselves, how we cope, what we value, and what we disregard.
1745;the plot jumps around a bit and some of the story elements of the movie are a bit tough to swallow including the major plot twist of the movie.
1746;Overall, This is a very unique movie, and well worth seeing.
1747;I always notice cigarette burns at the theaters now.
1748;Taking the Choose life, anti.
1749;conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it.
1750;He's an insomniac slave to his IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self.
1751;It provides him with an escape from his sleepless nights.
1752;lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air.
1753;In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive.
1754;David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of Seven and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of The Game and assembled his strongest effort to date.
1755;right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame.
1756;corporate message but how it delivers said message.
1757;Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree.
1758;even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works.
1759;Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening.
1760;Like he did with Kalifornia and Twelve Monkeys , Pitt grunges himself down and disappears completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree.
1761;It is an incredible performance .
1762;If Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator.
1763;It's a deceptively understated performance as the last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly.
1764;He is clearly our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry observations on our consumer.
1765;obsessed culture are right on the money.
1766;They are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the notion that we are what we own.
1767;The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, win.
1768;And it is these thought.
1769;provoking ideas that makes Fight Club a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.
1770;From the opening sequence to the final shot,this movie will keep you glued to your seat and your eyes fastend to the screen.
1771;this is one of those rare films that blends action,suspense and comedy beautifully and effectively,not to mention the on.
1772;The screenplay is great the acting outstanding.
1773;Edward Norton is,as always, perfect.
1774;Brad Pitt shines in his best role to date.
1775;Neo finds the Matrix, Lester finds beauty in the world, Peter steals from his company, while The Narrator and Patrick turn to more primal methods of coping.
1776;fight Club and American Psycho are the perfect companions for each other however, as they both contain all the above themes, and both deal with primal remedies that deal with madness and insanity in a world that inevitably breeds madness and insanity.
1777;He travels and gets to see America, but it's all the same to him.
1778;But since she is a distraction, his life is messed up again, so he takes the philosophical route.
1779;The Narrator has just found the ultimate form of societal rebellion.You see, The Narrator/Tyler Durden sees society as a bunch of wimpy zombies.
1780;He's been working for a way to free society from being zombies, yet he's created an ultimate army of zombies.
1781;A figment of an imagination.
1782;The tale of a man so numb, he took punches just to feel something, and wanted the rest of the world to be free.
1783;But with freedom comes a price, and a price that defeats the freedom in first place.
1784;put together, brilliantly written, stunningly put.
1785;together, perfectly acted, hilarious, memorable, and most of all, thought.
1786;first off, I call this movie the ClockWork Orange for Generation X. I love the film.
1787;And, yeah, I'll admit it, I loved the '90s Ultraviolence.
1788;All this and it's a damn good movie.
1789;`Fight Club' is a superb filmmaking achievement.
1790;It is brutal, innovative, raw, realistic, and extremely powerful.
1791;Edward Norton once again portrays a psyche in delicate imbalance with potent and believable intensity.
1792;Brad Pitt moves to the far side of diabolical and excels in making his character both warped and charismatic.
1793;`Fight Club' takes some of the most pernicious elements of societal dysfunction and wraps them up into a single imaginative well crafted and entertaining film.
1794;How utterly cool and hip!So now comes the twist.
1795;It is clever and technically superb but philosophically and socially bereft.
1796;`Fight Club' is a brilliant but dangerous film that begs the question.
1797;As a flickjunkie I must stand in awe of it as a filmmaking accomplishment.
1798;I've watched it many times because its such an incredible journey into the lives of some very interesting people.
1799;Once you do, it stays with you long after its over.
1800;The characters are all brilliantly acted.
1801;The story is one that will become a classic.
1802;Its the story of a seemingly ordinary young man who hooks up with the enigmatic Tyler Durden.
1803;Together they start the fight club, a club full of guys who beat the crud out of each other.
1804;Helena Bonham Carter is great in this film because she plays a rather strange and deranged young woman so well.
1805;All three of the actors makes this film so great.
1806;I think Ed Norton is one of the best new actors to hit the screen in years.
1807;His portrayal of this mad character was superb.
1808;It really makes you see another side of life and it makes you see civilization in a way that few films do.
1809;Its violent but done in a way that is just incredible.
1810;Its madness, chaos and a wild trip into a frightening subculture.
1811;Its a film I watch quite often!
1812;Misunderstood by many critics and despised by a good portion of the viewing public upon it's initial release, David Fincher's film of Chuck Palahniuk's novel Fight Club, remains of one of the best films of the 90's and one of the hippest, most subersive movies in recent memory.
1813;brilliantly acted and directed (Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham.
1814;And, most importantly, irresistable to women.
1815;Fight Club take this concept to an extreme level and emerges as one of the funniest black comedies in decades.
1816;Your ability to suspend disbelief is powerful enough to believe Brad Pitt actually taking a bath.6.
1817;I'll have to admit that Fight Club deserves credit for generating so much discussion.
1818;But I agree with the person who said the giddy reviews are a lot scarier than the movie itself.
1819;This is definitely the most amazing movie I have ever seen, period.
1820;Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter and Brad Pitt put on great performances.
1821;The movie poses a lot of questions, and certainly is one of the most thought.
1822;provoking and gripping films I have seen in a long time.
1823;the fighting was a way for the men to feel alive, just feel after being numbed by corporate america.
1824;Fight Club is a fantastic film, worth many viewings.
1825;Fight Club has definetly got to be one of the best movies ever.
1826;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are awesome in this movie, and play their roles extremely well.
1827;I didn't like the movie the first time I watched it, because it was kind of hard to understand and comprehend it all at first, but after a 2nd and 3rd viewing I took it all in, and I believe it to be one of the best movies ever.
1828;I still am not sure what the true meaning of the movie is, but even past that, it's still a great movie.
1829;This movie is much more than you might expect.
1830;Darkly hilarious, it mercilessly takes swings at our materialism and artificial way of life in this post.
1831;Fight Club has all the right messages, but it delivers it in all the wrong ways.
1832;Even though this movie was made 10 years ago I still have fun watching it.
1833;Fight Club the movie was, in my opinion, an excellent film.
1834;Whether or not you like the picture itself is up to you.
1835;You pay a little more for this second disk but believe me, it is worth every penny.
1836;It contains music videos, internet and tv spots from the advertising campaign for Fight Club (nearly all of which I missed the first time around and some of which are downright hilarious), the presskit (also hilarious), a long interview with Edward Norton, deleted scenes, explanations of the subtle and efffective special effects, and more!
1837;With the commentaries and all the other extra features there is at least another dozen fresh hours of entertainment and insight into the film.
1838;The video and audio transfer is among the best I have seen.
1839;An excellent film from one of the most innovative, visually stylistic directors around.
1840;the extras and beautiful packaging make it a must for collectors.
1841;He wants you to think about 'Fight Club'.
1842;from the opening scene Fight Club is full of ideas and principles and logic.
1843;way through many of those ideas have either meshed together to form something greater or collided with a bang/thud .
1844;and still formed something more substantial.
1845;The ideas still make sense but we're so immersed in the story of Jack and Tyler that we can't stop and think about all this logic.
1846;In fact, it's a great thing.
1847;fight Club is brilliant and the critics never gave it the respect it deserved.
1848;Not only is the film full of ideas, but it's extremely well acted by the entire cast, offers some breathtaking imagery (much of which is CGI but rarely noticeable), and startling and frank scenes of violence and uncontrolled mayhem.
1849;Kudos to David Fincher for assaulting us .
1850;nobody could have done it so well.
1851;If you like Matrix, you have to watch this film!
1852;The edition of this movie is art, the picture is perfect, and the story knocks you down.
1853;At it's best it resonates the observational rapping of best stand up comedy and it's brilliant sense of humour makes one forgive it's missed opportunities.
1854;The dyed spiked hair and anarchist posturings of Tyler Durden recalling you.
1855;Very spooky movie with subtle clues as to what is really going on.
1856;If you miss the clues the first time, see it again and enjoy them.
1857;This is a true 21st.
1858;century masterpiece, not only because of the shockingly realistic violence, but also because of it's philosophy etc.
1859;It actually features many of the best sides of my favorite movies
1860;This is a true masterpiece, wich should be rated as one of the most important social movies to date.
1861;You don't bump into many of these in your life, I got to tell you.
1862;This truly was a great movie.
1863;The cinematography and effects are also very well done and contrary to popular opinion (those who haven't seen the movie) the movie is NOT at all bloody or terribly violent though there are 3 or 4 fights that last about a minute if not less.
1864;Characters are fully developed and the dialogue is funny and deep.
1865;A must see for fans of modern film.
1866;But for me the fantastic shots, complex storyline, satire and humour make it a classic.
1867;A good to look at film, with tons of speedy direction from David Fincher (the guy who brought us Seven.
1868;for which we should be very thankful) with lots of cutting and some hefty decent special effects.
1869;It really is a smart film, with tons of decent dialogue and a truly knock.you.
1870;feet ending, which you will have the hardest time guessing.
1871;but the best thing about the film is the two lead performances.
1872;Edwards Norton's paranoid, exhausted narration is fantastic to listen to, and it's wonderful to have a film centre around such a neurotic guy.
1873;Brad Pitt is fabulous as Tyler, literally a personification of rebellion and freedom.
1874;it's a work of genius, a visual treat, and a mind.
1875;Is it a commentary, a love story, a cry for help or just pulling your leg?
1876;moderation, self awareness, goal seeking, focus, and adopting healthy male models of behavior?
1877;in a sense you laugh along, in another you wonder who they're really making fun of here.
1878;as for the acting
1879;Brad Pitt is having fun.
1880;Ed Norton is having fun.
1881;The cinematography is wonderful, as is the sense of gritty dispair.
1882;the soundtrack is quite good too.
1883;That having been said, this movie is one of the my favorite movies ever, and it's a pity that it wasn't given a better reception by critics and fans alike when it came out.
1884;from a strictly filmmaking point of view, Fight Club uses a variety of interesting storytelling tehcniques that help build the story, and carry the unreality of what we're seeing.
1885;The ending makes you want to go back and see it again, just to figure out what you missed, and yes, it does all fit together when you watch again, in fact it fits in so well, you're amazed you didn't see the ending coming.
1886;The video transfer is damn near perfect.
1887;if you think you see blotches on the screen every once in a while, look again.
1888;:) The colors are a bit dark, but is done intentionally, and helps keep the mood.
1889;Great use of all 5.1 channels.
1890;but, it's packed to the gills with extras features!
1891;It is by far the best thing to come out of Hollywood in many years.
1892;I laughed, I cried, I punched my best friend in the parking lot afterwards.
1893;This movie not only speaks to a generation.
1894;I for one, will be on my seats edge.
1895;Both Brad Pitt and Ed Norton play their parts beautifully along with a comical, interesting script and some rather interesting facts and ideas.
1896;in every sense, 'Fight Club' excels.
1897;It's visually stunning, the cast is superb, the screenplay, directing, Fincher's fingertip touch of adapting the book, the novel itself
1898;Fight club works in every way
1899;as an important forum of discussion .
1900;with a mind blowing conclusion, this film cannot get any better, but remember .
1901;For me, the combination of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt together in a film is amazing.
1902;Both very solid actors that have proven they can hold their own, and carry others if needed.
1903;Both played their own strong characters in this movie, as well as playing off one another with great timing and poise.
1904;the movie itself, is also amazing.
1905;The directing is also as good as it gets.
1906;One can tell a lot of caution was placed in constructing the story and how to go about telling it.
1907;I also take back everything I said about the hype surrounding it, because it really is one of the best movies of the time!
1908;This movie is a Buddhist message.
1909;Believing in FREEDOM is supporting that which you hate as well as that which you love.
1910;when one can extend this message completely throughout his life .
1911;My progressing understanding of what I may be and the way my awareness works has brought me increasing levels of depression.
1912;in my mind the best movie ever made .
1913;Much of this is due to its message but its presentation is first rate.
1914;It is remarkably consistent, rich and if you give it a chance will change what you are.
1915;but I still go to that job.
1916;If you can stomach some violence and get past the gore, it's a as awesome movie, with such an interesting plot that you will want to watch it again right afterwards.
1917;It follows the plot of the Chuck Palahniuk book pretty closely, and Ed Norton and Brad Pitt do some great acting.
1918;and his character is pretty cool too.
1919;The director of SEVEN and The GAME obviously knows how to make good movies.
1920;Norton assured that he is one of the five best.
1921;actors nowadays and even Pitt is convincing.
1922;, does a wonderful turn as Tyler Durden in this purile film.
1923;And Bonham Carter, Norton, and Meatloaf are all good as well.
1924;Try this for gifts, worth the money, quick delivery, pure entertainment!
1925;I love this for Christmas gifts for someone who has everything!
1926;This movie keeps ur interest for sure .
1927;Humor is a bit dark, I thought it was a decent movie.
1928;this is a great movie and glad I did get the 10th anniversary edition ( Blu.
1929;ray ) highly recommend this movie and 100% please I did get this Blu.
1930;One of the best movies of all times.
1931;This movie is a must see, if you haven't seen it yet.
1932;This is one of the best movies i've seen in the last 5 years.
1933;even if you try, you can't get deep into all the nuances in the first view, and you must see the movie again to get it right.
1934;In my opinion the shock level reminds The sixth sense , but here it is much more complicated, and better developed after the shock.
1935;The actors are great, mostly Brad Pete, who flicks at the begining of the movie a few times as a reminder for the more to come.
1936;the third rule of Fight Club is you should watch this movie and honestly Think.
1937;It will twist within you, ideas may writhe and cause you a measure of discomfort.
1938;fincher has done an amazing job with this film.
1939;OK, we all know that Fight Club is a great movie.
1940;The audio is outstanding and will make anyone with a surround sound system go insane.
1941;It was worth a couple of delays to get to this finished product.
1942;I bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew .
1943;If you are a fan of this movie and you like to listen to commentaries, you will definitely appreciate this one.
1944;Brad Pitt reveals his intelligent side as he discusses how he prepared for the role.
1945;David Fincher is also good.
1946;Ok so let me reply for the people who thought this movie was good, well acted and means something.
1947;Leave the energetic well executed films for us boys and girls who have some life in our lives.
1948;Is this the best film ever made?
1949;i saw this film a few years ago on a friends wide screen T. v.
1950;If your into brand names and conformity then this film will do one of two things.
1951;Fight Club is and incredible movie about living outside of what we are broughtup to believe.
1952;The society in which we live is very materialistic and we areraised believing that material possessions are essential to our survival and ourhappiness.
1953;His ended up with a new form oftherapy that he and his friend created.
1954;In order to be happy he would haveto live on his own and go his own direction.
1955;There is an element of humor that isundeniable.
1956;The film is notonly a serious abstract commentary, but a comedy as well.
1957;if one walks away from Fight Club with anything, it should be an open mind,the idea that what we are told may not be correct, and a laugh.
1958;And David Fincher definitely creates some of the most striking visual images you'll see on film.
1959;I especially liked when Norton was walking through the Ikea catalog that was his apartment.
1960;carter, and especially Pitt give powerful perfomances.
1961;The comforts of modern society prevent us from feeling truly alive.
1962;The movie is great, but if that isn't enough you get a whole disc of extras.
1963;You can watch the movie while the actors and director comment,which is cool.
1964;This is a dark film, incredibly well made and acted and photographed and directed.
1965;You actually need to see it more than once to appreciate the dialogue, the philosophies of the characters, and just how amazing and innovative some of the visual effects are.
1966;along the way, you'll be treated to some great one.
1967;liners, some twisted yet well.
1968;thought out philosophies, and some great acting by both Norton and Pitt.
1969;for anyone who appriecates the style of an independent movie with a mainstream budget and cast, then this is right up your street.
1970;One of the most entertaining things about Fight Club is the intelligent well thought.
1971;With unforgetable charaters (Helena Bonham Carter gives a spectacular performance, that's slightly out of her routine acting kitch), cruel but very funny situtions and grim set pieces.
1972;And he is, at least and certainly in terms of sheer audacity and breathtaking filmmaking.
1973;I bought this movie because i seen befor, was please and decided that the movie would be a good one for my collection, thanks for movie tike this
1974;This is entertainment at its finest: brilliant script, incredible performances, expert cinematography and skilful direction.
1975;Edward Norton is completely believable as your ordinary everyman who longs for something more than his cookie.
1976;Brad Pitt delivers his usual strong performance, full of swagger and bravado, as the man who can (and will) change everything.
1977;And believe me, in this film it's true .
1978;talk about a surprise ending!
1979;I recommend listening to the one featuring the director (David Fincher) and the principal actors (Norton, Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter).
1980;It's hilarious and makes you appreciate a lot of the subtleties of the film (and why Edward Norton dislikes those new VW Beetles).
1981;Disc 2 adds deleted scenes and alternate takes (with immediate comparison to the actual takes and notes explaining the choice), promotional materials (theatrical trailers, TV spots, even the mock PSAs done by Norton and Pitt), and some amazing making of footage with multiple.
1982;I saw this in the theater, and I thought it was brilliant.
1983;I didn't like the last third of the film (the twist didn't really work for me), but the first 2/3rds of the film is amongst the best filmmaking I saw during the 90's (not a great decade for films).
1984;This is a film about the hollow lives of men during the booming 1990's, except this film really looks at them with a sharp wit and real, hilarious satire.
1985;This is great satire, dripping with sarcasm and real irony, not the Gen X irony that permeated the decade.
1986;The film also came out in 1999, the best year for films in that decade.
1987;Pitt and Norton are superb in their roles, and Fincher's direction is very self assured.
1988;Fincher is one of the more interesting and talented directors working today.
1989;There is real brains behind this film (and its source material, the brilliant novel by Chuck Palahniuk), and there is depth here that was missing in the 1990's.
1990;Fight Club is a film awaiting true rediscovery.
1991;Soo glad I discovered this!
1992;just make sure you watch it in order!
1993;hour of Fincher's commentary (all I had time for before it was due back) I bought it, and now it is my new favorite movie!The four commentaries are simply amazing, peeling back the layers of the movie like a big onion, revealing hundreds of beautiful little touches that are easily missed in a casual viewing.
1994;The solo Fincher track is engaging in its own right, but when you add Norton, Pitt, and Bonham.
1995;carter it really provides a well.
1996;rounded view of the relationship of the characters.
1997;The extras (on their own separate disc) are equally fascinating, covering special effects and CGI that appear so seamless I didn't even realize they WERE special effects.
1998;Even the packaging of the disc is entertaining, with the inclusion of mostly negative reviews of the film (not a very orthodox marketing ploy, yet very in keeping with the spirit of the film.)
1999;This disc is a must.
2000;ray, this movie gets more intense, more visceral and more dark.
2001;Judging from the majority of reviews posted on this site, 'Fight Club' is a wickedly subversive piece of art that deserves to be canonized.
2002;According to their ridiculously linear perspective, it represents a cinematic blueprint that both established and emerging directors should aspire to.
2003;Ahh, the sheer depth and plethora of Fincher's thematic exploration, the philosophical implications of the script, the erudite dialogue that provides the viewer with relevant insights into the nature of the operation of modern day society and the psychological effects it has on the average individual.
2004;will no doubt feel compelled to reach the conclusion that I `missed the point' or `didn't get it', to you I present the following challenge: .
2005;For the purpose of `clarifying' my intentions of this review, this is directed at those who either take this movie relatively seriously or alternatively, believe it's a cutting edge social satire.
2006;Recommendations: Social satire with depth(BRAZIL), pertinent analysis of the modern human condition and the search for a happier mode of existence (THE IDIOTS).
2007;post scriptum: 'F. c' is a great film IMO.
2008;To explain the profound effect the film has had on me would be herculean, but I will do my best.
2009;It is a brilliant, blunt, and beautiful re.
2010;examination of all we've come to believe.
2011;The story is captivating, thought.
2012;With raw, believable, and unforgetable characters perfectly portrayed by actors including Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, Fight Club will shake you, shock you, and provide you with hope and a new look on life.
2013;Some of us flew into it and found a liberating maddening purity for brief moments.
2014;This movie takes me right back there on the schoolyard dirt.
2015;Seeing this film is like getting in a fight.
2016;go, experience this film and get ready to fight.
2017;Fight Club is one of the best movies made in the past five years if not the best.
2018;it is funny how when one's world view changes so does the perceptions of a work of art.
2019;this was a movie that was made with love as David Fincher has filled it with all sorts of visual details.
2020;The music by The Dust Brothers is exceptional and the lyric of the last song of the movie is very much in line with Buddhist teaching.
2021;the movie is part meditation, part social commentary, part action movie , part comedy (a strange mixture of the varieties of black and light comfortably coexisting,) part love story and from my perspective a very hopeful film.
2022;I see the movie as being great art that is open to numerous interpretations.
2023;In a way it is somewhat of a cinematographic Rorschach test.
2024;the movie begins with the introduction of a character who is sometimes referred to as Jack (played by Edward Norton).
2025;This is our first inkling that Jack is on a spiritual journey.
2026;The banter between Jack and Marla is priceless.
2027;Tyler is cool: he talks cool, he dresses cool and is probably everything poor clean cut Jack wished he was.
2028;After leaving the bar at the request of Tyler they engage in a fight that both finds cathartic.
2029;a triangle forms between Jack, Tyler and Marlabut it is as much of a philosophical triangle as it is a love triangle.
2030;rather than Tyler coming across as a megalomanic he seems to symbolize the power of one individual in possession of a unique idea with the will to carry it out.
2031;it caused me to reflect more on the movie.
2032;Still the scene of collapsing skyscrapers in NYCunfortunately takes on a whole new meaning in this post 9.11 world.
2033;He is a man who against the odds helps to lead his generation out of the banality of their lives and restore the American dream.
2034;Tyler is a visionary and an idealist.
2035;In the end it is a hopeful movie.
2036;the movie is rated R and I agree with that rating if it is applied the way it is stated .
2037;Ideally what is meant by that rating is that the said adult is more than just a warm body that is over 21.
2038;a movie well worth seeing and owning.
2039;Subliminal messages in movies is just another of the complex twists in this hilariously intelligent movie.
2040;The collector's edition has an additional disc and is well worth the few extra dollars.
2041;What it's really about is two guys who devise a plan to f**k up the system .
2042;The first disc, in addition to the movie, has four commentary tracks, the most interesting being the one between Fincher, Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter (it also explains why they had to beat up a Volkswagen Beetle.)
2043;Although the film's prescience is perhaps better attributed to Chuck Palahniuk, it is still remarkable for the insights it provides into the psychology of the terrorists we face today.
2044;Fight Club, based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel, is an excellent adaption of his book.
2045;There are so many themes, feelings and human sensitivities touched upon it can be a bit overwhelming at first, making it a good film to watch more than once.
2046;Yet I can see where some of the younger, macho crowd might think it's cool, dude and associate the film's title with the fight scenes alone, making it worth their while.
2047;ultimately Fight Club grows on you and creates sympathy for the characters in the film, moving you to cheer them on inside.
2048;Pitt and Norton were great choices for the cast leads.
2049;it's an interesting and thought provoking story, something you don't see much in film today honestly.
2050;It questions our values, family structures, religions, and touches our inner.
2051;If you are going to watch a film made in the last 3 years, watch Fight Club, highly recommended.
2052;i would actually rate it 3.5 stars if I could but Amazon only lets me rate whole numbers.
2053;The main theme of the film is that life is a constant struggle to discover who you really are.
2054;The director David Fincher has been very successful with his great two movies prior Fight Club , which are Seven and The Game .
2055;He's known to go to extremes and manage to keep the suspense and thrill combined with a good story all through the movie.
2056;And this was the same issue with his earlier two movies but back then he managed to pull the movie together with an amazing shocking ending.
2057;Fourth, what is it to enjoy in this film?
2058;If you have never seen this movie, it is a must!
2059;I'm not a Brad Pitt fan, but this movie is probably his best.
2060;He was excited to get the movie.
2061;The menu is always good for a laugh too for people who haven't seen it before.
2062;Fight Club is a great movie!
2063;It is also very well acted by Norton, Pitt, and Carter.
2064;Norton delivers once again with a wonderful portrayal of the nameless narrator.
2065;Pitt is very good as the crazy Tyler.
2066;It is defiantly a must see!
2067;so fresh when it came out, and still so.
2068;Man, the action, the comedy, the drama.
2069;Ed Norton has a very controlled, boringly normal, compulsively square life.
2070;it had to be said) steps into his life.
2071;I don't want to give away any twists or turns, but I will just say that while a little violent, the movie is amazing to watch.
2072;It's so well acted, and adventerous, and like nothing else you'll see.
2073;Ed Norton is perfect as a suit and tie guy who just gets sick of his mindless consumerism.
2074;He meets Tyler, played to perfection by Brad Pitt, who inspires him to take his life into his own hands and they begin exorcizing their own demons through cathartic underground fight clubs.
2075;And be prepared to view it again and again.
2076;An underrated gem whose cult only grows bigger as the years go on.
2077;The service I received was amazing.
2078;Deeper than The Matrix and richer than American Beauty, Fight Club was simply the best film of 1999.
2079;You must watch carefully this film.
2080;but if you really are sincerely and above all free of all kind of ancestral prejuices, welcome.
2081;this a very clever journey far beyond some life aspects you avoid talking in a conference, for instance, not even a social meeting.
2082;This films walks minute to minute on the knife's edge.
2083;It bothers you, it inquires you, it challenges without a minute of rest.
2084;nietszche stated once that smart thought: Do you want to clim?
2085;brad Pitt shows once more his actoral gifts , and so well Norton and that nature's force this monumental and versatile actrass Helen Bonham Carter.
2086;watch this film with people able to make an intelligent discussion after.
2087;and welcome to the fight club!
2088;This movie is just asbsolutely brilliant.
2089;Of course one does wish more of it could be genuinely informative, but that doesn't stop the movie as a whole from being a beautiful work of art.
2090;It's informed by Noir [eastern] philosophy, presents itself wonderfully with its own great new vision.
2091;The voiceover allows for communication with the audience the internal poetry of the movie that otherwise would be awkward or impossible.
2092;takes, deleted scenes, storyboards, concept art, etc.
2093;Well, Fight Club is probably one of the best movies of all time.
2094;The performances are excellent from all cast members.
2095;The direction absolutely perfect, the writing.
2096;The best thing about this film is the soul it has, for as much violent content as is shown the themes expressed are that of living and enjoying life.
2097;the SPECIAL FEATURES are a must to WATCH.
2098;I will HIGHLY RECOMMEND seeing him in PRIMAL FEAR with RICHARD GERE (who is very good).
2099;I definitely advise anyone and everyone to watch it.
2100;He figured that this movie would somehow make me think more about that type of thing.
2101;But man, when they made their Fight Club I suddenly tuned right in!
2102;As you can probably tell, these fight scenes were by far my favorite parts in the movie.
2103;Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Tom Arnold is also in the movie, but he has a really big deformed chest.
2104;One of the best movies I ever seen, great to watch over and over.
2105;I am Nik's enjoyment of this movie.
2106;This is one of the most underrated movies of all time (and I thought Seven was one of the most overrated movies of all time, so I was completely unprepared for how great this is).
2107;Bravo David Fincher and everyone involved.
2108;provoking, incredibly original and just plain beautifully made.
2109;Better yet, sit back with some frozen orange juice concentrate and order up a signed first edition to read when the lights go out.
2110;The movie itself is one of the best ever and the extras help bring it to legendary levels.
2111;Actually, a ton of explainations that would impress anyone who thought about making movies.
2112;The one with the stars talking is as entertaining as most things on TV.
2113;And the internet promos PSAs behind the scenes text drawings make it a full volume of ready info on the movie.
2114;Even the case it comes in fits the feel of the movie.
2115;Plus, the makers are realistic .
2116;touching on the fact that many critics abhorred the violence in it when it was less violent than many 1 hour cop dramas.
2117;And if you don't, they explain to you why they, and a huge cult following, think it's one of the best productions ever.
2118;this film is something all should watch.
2119;Every scene, moment, line makes sense.
2120;And once you see that this movie is about fighting .
2121;but not beating men down with fists, you get the understand that this is a deeply psychological film.
2122;A thinker's film with a modern flow.
2123;look for the happy face.
2124;This movie is one of the best movies to come out in 1999, along with Dogma.
2125;This movie is really thought provoking and makes you wonder if the writer of the original novel lived through something like this because this seems so lifelike.
2126;It's very farfetched, but for some reason it's still very believable.
2127;The plot never gives away it's next surprise.
2128;Every once in a while, a movie comes along that smacks you right in the face .
2129;a film that shakes to the cores some of the basic assumptions by which we lead our lives.
2130;David Fincher's brilliant adaptation of the Chuck Palahniuk novel packs more philosophical punch than practically any big.
2131;Further, this movie is replete with memorable quotations, and would be worth purchasing for that reason alone.
2132;A Film that dared to ask all the tough questions, answer them, slap the audience across the face, and ask more tough questions, Fight Club is one of the greatest psychological thrillers/social commentaries of all time
2133;David Fincher is the best director of the 21st century.
2134;I believe that David Fincher should've receive the nomination for Best directing.
2135;The packaging it comes in is really one of the best and suits the movie very well.
2136;rOM, take a snapshot and read it.
2137;Take a sober look at your life!
2138;carter's acting is perfect, Edward Norton's acting is perfect, Meatloaf's acting is perfect, and Brad Pitt's abs are perfect.
2139;I give it 4.9 stars out of 5.
2140;This one is quite simply the best I have ever seen.
2141;it is packed full of food for the mind, soul, and body.
2142;A movie you must watch, and then watch again, and again.
2143;I RARELY watch the same movie twice.
2144;the movie is an intelligent view of what we have become as consumers.
2145;Disc one is the movie in all it's glory, with several commentaries that are very worth listening too.
2146;The second disc is a varitable candy store for fans of this movie.
2147;perfect for the film, and the script translates the idea of the book to the screne admirably.
2148;The book, on that thought, is also really wonderful.
2149;Though the movie differs from the book slightly, if you enjoy one you'll undoubtably enjoy the other.
2150;ray was a wonderful treat.
2151;This was a great movie.
2152;When I realized what was really going on I couldn't believe it and I had to watch the movie over again from my new perspective which made things all the more funny!
2153;Some of the material was a bit graphic but very realistic and kept me believing that the fights were real and that what was happening could really happen and may actually be happening as well.
2154;I loved Brad Pitts role in this movie and think that his character was chosen very nicely.
2155;I also loved the character that Meatloaf played.
2156;An amazing story of the human subconscious in its yearning to break free from confinements of how one identifies self.
2157;I'm a little bit older and wiser and after watching it over 100 times, I still find little intricate details that make the movie one of the best of all time.
2158;I really enjoyed the humor built into the menu system alone with the false menu and whatnot.
2159;Great stuff and it keeps the vibe of the film going from the moment you pop in the disc until you've finished the film all the way through the special features.
2160;The whole premis of the movie is great and i think everyone should own this movie,just because it is so great.
2161;This is an excellent movie(usually classified as a guy movie)that can possibly open up your mind to what previously might have been invisible to you.
2162;Brad Pitt is excellent in it and so is Ed Norton, I did not like Helena Carter in this.
2163;Its definitley a revolutionary type movie and I thought David Fincher did an excellent job directing it(as always)and I reccomend anyone watch it that likes action in their movies and like watching movies w/a message!
2164;this movie, fight club, has so much ability.
2165;it has the ability to make you shut up for 133 minutes and just sit back and take in this beautiful movie.
2166;it has the ability to make you do things that have just been in the back of your mind, you didn't know they were there.
2167;it is elite and that my friend is true.
2168;Wow, violence exists, people can fight and they can get hurt and learn things about themselves!
2169;A nice performance by Norton, but nothing else to recommend it.
2170;Is this due to pure chance, or earned respect?
2171;Watch it and you decide.
2172;Ed Norton and Brad Pitt team up to create an extraordinary film.
2173;Once realizing what he's gotten himself into The Narrator has an entertaining journey of discovery which leads to the establishment of a new life.
2174;fight Club is both entertainment and social commentary.
2175;And a distinct wonder of what you really can accomplish.
2176;all told this is a great film, with a fascinating if bizarre story.
2177;The cast is perfect in brining the dysfunction of the world to the forefront of your mind.
2178;There's a lot that can be said of Fight Club, first that it is not a movie for people who are perfectly content with society, or who frequently shop at IKEA or love their Starbucks.
2179;it throws materialism in your face, taunts you with your own petty desires, and shows you the root of humanity, what it is to be human.
2180;the message of Fight Club is, simply this: you are a willing slave.
2181;hands down, my favorite movie of all time.
2182;The movie is unlike any other movie.
2183;This is truly in excellent movie, a rarity among a lot of the .
2184;Even if you dont like the movie its worth seeing the general message of the movie is worth hereing about.
2185;See the movie youll either hate it or love it, I loved it, its definately a guy thing, This movie is the complete oppisite of a chick flick.
2186;Fight Club and Seven stand out the most, The Game was fantastic, and Panic Room was certainly suspenseful.
2187;Fight Club was such a great role for Edward Norton.
2188;Fight Club was an unforgettable film with unforgettable elements.
2189;As a whole, Fight Club is one of the most amazing films that I have ever seen and I strongly recommend it, especially for fans of anyone in the cast or of David Fincher.
2190;So all I am going to say is that this is the best film ever and definitely a film you will watch over and over and over.
2191;dang, that there moving picture shore was sumthin'.
2192;steel towers, yuppified apartment complexes, light, and motion.
2193;style photography and text descriptions.)
2194;which works fine, until he discovers Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) another voyeur like himself.
2195;(He's clued in by her appearance at the testicular cancer group.)
2196;Tyler, who offers trenchant criticisms of capitalism and corporate society, seems like a charming flake, until the narrator gets home to find his apartment a blasted ruin.
2197;Needing a place to stay, he calls Tyler, and the two of them begin to form a special bond, culminating in a bloody fistfight outside a local bar.
2198;Exhilarated by the atavistic thrill of hand.
2199;Pretty soon other patrons start getting in on the action
2200;day drudgery by allowing them a chance to beat the snot out of one another.
2201;fIGHT CLUB has a new and unique energy to it, galvanized by Fincher's energetic photography and the throbbing music of the Dust Brothers.
2202;But what I really loved about this movie is the way it turns the tables on the Tyler Durdens and Gen. x whiners of this world.
2203;But this message is still delivered with wonderful, wonderful humor.
2204;In its own way, FIGHT CLUB was the best comedy of 1999.
2205;This film on a visual and 2 dimensial face is entertaining and moves on quickly enough so that you don't get bored.
2206;on a deeper level it has mesages about soical and economic life in america.
2207;this is a thoroughly entertaining film, especially when you watch it with your girlfriend!!!
2208;It will blow your mind with amazing directing from David Fincher and excellent performances from Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.
2209;This movie deserves to be in everyone's collection, and looks fantastic on blu.
2210;More people should love it.
2211;It's an intelligent movie and it's not just about a bunch of guys wailing on each other just for the sake of fighting.
2212;It's got a great director, great cast, great acting and a great storyline.
2213;This is his vacation, this is his addiction.
2214;As Tyler and Jack fight, they also bond.
2215;they move the club to the basement of the bar and that's were they have their weekly fights.
2216;Tyler gives his weekly sermon about our life and our jobs.
2217;How we were thought to believe growing up that one day we would be rich and famous and happy.
2218;disc has more features and commentaries from almost everyone involved including the writer of the book Chuck Palahniuk.
2219;Fight Club is the best movie that is out there right now.
2220;Not only is it so keen on its timing, but everything that is involved with it is superb.
2221;Edward Norton is one of the best actors in the world right now and he plays his part brilliantly.
2222;Brad Pitt is funny and gives life to his character.
2223;Helena Bonham Carter is great as the eccentric womam who just doesn't care.
2224;Another aspect of this to be examined is that Fight Club was directed by the best director in show business, David Fincher.
2225;He is a genius and this movie only hightens that status.
2226;Every frame of Fight Club is interesting to look at.
2227;In the end (and I won't spoil that for you) Fight Club is a smart, brilliant, funny, and suprisingly moving black comedy that only a few will be able to recognize the intensity of this movie on a higher level.
2228;Almost every other guy at my university has a special place in there heart for Fight Club.
2229;ray has great new special features that I really enjoyed.
2230;Must own for fans of the movie.
2231;David Fincher, hands down is one of my favorite Directors working in film.
2232;Finchers style fits Palahniuk's visions perfectly from Novel to Film.
2233;These tracks are highly entertaining and informative, especially the track from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt (listen for the classic 'streets will be safer' line from Norton).
2234;the commentary tracks only scratch the surface of the extras here, but for me are the most worthwhile .
2235;disc edition, it's still good value.
2236;disc set is, the deluxe packaging is brilliant and the content exhaustive.
2237;I read the book after watching the movie and was impressed by how closely it followed the book.
2238;This is a really good movie despite what you might think it is about.
2239;okay, so what is it about.
2240;Women always complain about not understanding men, see this and you get a glimpse.
2241;When I first heard this, I didn't know quite what to think, but as time went on, I understood it perfectly.
2242;Fight Club sets a new standard for ambitious and dark modern filmmaking.
2243;After their meeting Tyler and Norton's character find that enjoy fighting for the sheer fun of it.
2244;They begin to do more than fighting, as Tyler's power grows ever stronger.
2245;Fight Club is truly one of the most creative (as well as shocking) motion picture experiences ever created.
2246;Edward Norton, who is definitely one of my favorite actors, has never been one to shy away from bold and contraversial roles, and this movie is no exception.
2247;Brad Pitt plays the brash and cocky Tyler Durden to perfection, and really helps to enhance the overall feeling of the movie.
2248;This movie explores human existence, as well as the human mind, on an entirely new level.
2249;This movie is a perfect statement for the so called lost generation of people that comprise Generation X.
2250;This movie forces you to examine your views on life, and if nothing else is a powerful statement of cutting.
2251;Fight Club is rife with action, suspense, and a wonderfully sardonic sense of humor.
2252;This movie is also good for multiple viewings, as each one will reveal more subtle nuances that make the film that much better.
2253;The bottom line is this: Fight Club is truly a statement to a new generation of people, a movie that simply blows you away.
2254;ed norton is his friend and one of the first members.
2255;even by the respectable reviewer, Roger Ebert.
2256;david Fincher has made his second best film here, next to SE7EN.
2257;And he's made it better than the novel.
2258;Hours and hours of extras!
2259;It's a all time great movie one of Brad Pitts earlier movies that really stretched his acting ability it's a must see
2260;every time you watch it, you see something new, or get a new insite.
2261;Edward Nortan plays one of the most convincing screwed.
2262;up characters in recent memory.
2263;well, I had lost hope for him after Seven, but he turns in a character performance worthy of being compared to Hannible Lector.
2264;that is, unlsee you're into that sort of thing.
2265;I suggested they watch it again.
2266;there are a lot of layers to this movie, to be sure, and if you watch it several times, you'll probably still find new things to appreciate about it the next time.
2267;This movie is a comedy.
2268;A thick, sludgy, DAAAARRRRRK comedy.
2269;but if you're into that sorta thing, it's absolutely hilarious and brilliant.
2270;salesman with a penchant for anarchic practical jokes at his many part.
2271;bending and hilariously twisted journey.
2272;Not a whole lot of new extras, but it's worth it for the tech.
2273;upgrade (and the amusing new menus).
2274;The disk software is also as unusual and entertaining as the movie itself.
2275;The color and contrasts are beyond peer as exceedingly rich: the grime and dirty look of project mayhem's headquarters, clothing, faces, are most strikingly clear and heavily detailed and 'pop' out to you.
2276;The DTS sound track provides the best separation and dynamic range than anything broadcast or streaming delivers as of this writing.
2277;This movie is increbibly deep.
2278;This movie adds comedy to a powerful, insightful, and dramatical story line.
2279;In 1999 we were all spoilt with some of the best films Hollywood had to offer.
2280;Amongst this soup of fantastic film came a movie so odd, deranged and fantastic that it found immediate success.
2281;The result was fantastic
2282;the performances are great Edward Norton is shining as ever and Brad Pitt is fantastic as Tyler Durden.
2283;Their perfomances make 'Fight Club' a great film, that could have been a sub.
2284;See it again if you have, and see it for the first time and become hooked.
2285;The story, along with Pitt and Norton's performances make this movie well worth seeing and one of the most rememberable movies I have seen in quite a while.
2286;One of the greatest cult movies of all time!
2287;Totally mismarketed for its initial run in theaters, this film is the stuff of legend.
2288;face o. m. f. g subversive fun as any Tarantino movie.
2289;If they know, they will give you a wicked little smile, and say, Oh, yeah , as they suddenly flash back to their favorite scenes.
2290;Got a liitle long in parts but overall a very entertaining film.
2291;Lots of complex stuff going on so you have to pay attention.
2292;It's a cute film .
2293;This movie is a great modern day cult classic with Brad Pitt in one of his roles as a tough character and not the normal pretty boy role.
2294;Edward Norton is just as great as their characters duel it out to create a fantastical masterpiece.
2295;the reviews for this film certainly do swing from one extreem to another.
2296;I figured it was because of Brad Pit that she enjoyed it so much.
2297;In a world of possessions, i think i learned the most valuable lesson that can be taught, from a movie called Fight Club.
2298;happines is not your clothes, toys, cars or amount of zeros in your bank account, happiness comes from your life, and what you make of it.
2299;Watch the movie, think about it, and Watch it again.
2300;it will make you think.
2301;This film is absolutly amazing from the outset.
2302;From the credits onward I knew that this movie was going to be a rollercoaster ride from start to finish.
2303;edward Norton has established himself as The Man for the new millenium I expect a lot more from him in the next few years.
2304;With an intricate plot and superb special effects Fight Club is the film that sums up the last millenium.
2305;Most of my friends loved the movie.
2306;Still, the movie is able to work really well on several levels:First, the movie examines the character of the Narator and the schism of his personality.
2307;Norton and Pitt are phenomenal.
2308;Generally the movie works well as a 'character piece'.
2309;second, the movie has some great action, humor and gore.
2310;This is a great movie for college.
2311;The fights are well done, the general mayhem and sexuality are in line with this style of film.
2312;finally, this is a pretty decent social commentary type of picture.
2313;The ideology of the film: conformity v. anarchy is classic, but the movie definately brings some new thoughts to the table.
2314;overall, the movie said a lot of fun, interesting, funny and scary things without confusing its message or its plot.
2315;The movie was great to look at, as well.
2316;While I agree, the mystery of her character is somewhat essential to the plot.
2317;This film is without a doubt a masterpiece beyond words.
2318;one of the ten best films ever created.
2319;The whole way it's put together is just amazing.
2320;But the second viewing you understand it better, and that makes the story go smoother.
2321;stop action, great acting, and maybe little, (if any) storyline.
2322;This brutal honesty as Norton puts it, help him release all his feelings, and can rest.
2323;And just when you think that the move is great.
2324;it kicks into over drive and blows you away!
2325;But after the amazing opening credits (both music and visuals) which pan out from electrons bouncing around inside Norton's confused brain, out through a bead of sweat on his head, where his narration begins to explain why the camera ends the pan along the barrel of a gun, I knew it was going to be quite a ride.
2326;Forget the awesome music throughout the film and the creative opening
2327;wise, Pitt was inarguably perfect: born to play Durden.
2328;He was once quoted complimenting Chuck Palahniuk for writing the best part he's played.
2329;Oscar winner, Ed Norton doesn't hold back either.
2330;The complementary roles not only play well to the movie's theme, but provide for a surprising twist at the end.
2331;One layer deeper, it's about the proletariate rising up against the ruling class.
2332;The onion makes the movie appeal to a broad range of admittedly male audiences, but a very well.
2333;threaded twisted love triangle helps round out the appeal to other demos as well.
2334;But it was worth the wait.
2335;It comes with everything you could ever want on a 2 disc set including cuts, interviews, a full Making of feature, and trailers.
2336;Stealing Fat , by the Dust Brothers is incredible.
2337;I owned it a long time ago and it's such a cool movie that somebody stole it from me so, I got another one.
2338;The movie kept me on the edge of my seat the first time, the second time and yes, even the third time.
2339;Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are a dynamic duo.
2340;I HIGHLY reccomend it to anyone!
2341;This movie captures the inner landscape of isolated, emotionally.
2342;I especially recommend this movie to people who are fascinated by cults (because that's what the Fight Club truly is).
2343;One of the best movies ever.
2344;The special features are awesome and having it on blu ray is just money.
2345;ray edition brings you the movie you love with better blood, better bruises and better fist to face clarity.
2346;Everything you love about fight club is here and enhanced to pure awesomeness.
2347;Everything about this item is better from the case to the title screen and cut outs.
2348;I knew I had to do something.
2349;A son will always make that deal with his father, by the way.
2350;The difficulty of raising a son or being a son in the modern world is displayed brilliantly.
2351;In the end, he needs both characters blended into one capable man.
2352;One of the best movies ever, plot and actors are in line always.
2353;Fight Club was an excellent movie.
2354;The supporting cast really helps in adding to this cinematic classic as well.
2355;First off, this movie hands down has the one of the best endings, I have ever seen.
2356;Norton is incredible (as always), and Pitt's Tyler Durden is lovably psychotic.
2357;But, the real star here is Fincher who has directed his best movie since Seven.
2358;The soundtrack is great, the direction is spellbinding (look close for the subliminal flashes of human genitals), and the plot twist is one you will never guess.
2359;This is a very good movie, but if you can't stomach violence and look past it to the deeper meaning of the film, then don't watch it.
2360;The movie is very well cast and very well directed.
2361;The story is entertaining and fast moving.
2362;It has a strict anti.
2363;this is a great movie .
2364;it should have won best picture if the Academy had any guts .
2365;Most of you know that Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give outstanding performances that will have you applauding.
2366;Most of you know that the production values are up there with the best of them.
2367;Most of you know that the script is brilliant, mostly because it is adapted from the best novel of all time.
2368;And most of you know that David Fincher is a genius.
2369;The D stands for digital (obviously).
2370;And now that movies are finally coming out to own on the format, we can see them in high definition.
2371;Well, it's certainly good enough to take a look at.
2372;The image here is even better.
2373;One thing you'll notice right away is how the colors are perfect.
2374;The image is so life.
2375;It stood up to the best and held its own (even against powerhouses like Star Wars and Gladiator).
2376;With an absolutely perfect video presentation and a hard.
2377;hitting Dolby 5.1 mix, this is perfect for those just now getting into D. vHS and want to see if it's worth the investment.
2378;This movie is good on many levels, the story is great (adapted from a truely fantastic novel), the translation to film was very carefully crafted and it's artistic translation perhaps delivers the message to those who need it most.
2379;You are not a unique a beautiful butterfly The movie is crafted well, it's brilliant and nothing less than a piece of art.
2380;This is just the best movie of all time and this 10th Anniversary Blu.
2381;ray is full of interesting easter eggs.
2382;pump it up, guys, if you're gonna do it right, or cut it, please.
2383;The acting is superlative, however.
2384;Edward Norton is one of our truly great younger actors and Brad Pitt is amazing, for Brad Pitt.
2385;They are both perfectly cast, and Helena Bonham Carter is terrific as the desperate soul who hooks up, lost as well, with Norton and Pitt in this intriguing study of what happens when modern society cannot nurture us, instead forcing a response from some of us that might be deemed over the edge in every way.
2386;The film that is Fight Club carries itself from the start to the final climax.
2387;This film goes deep into the soul and questions the very thought of who you are and why you are here.
2388;David Fincher's work as a director keeps snowballing as one of the top in the business right now.
2389;Backed with the awe inspiring soundtrack by the Dust Brothers, the feel of the film and sound swept the viewer in and didn't let go until the point was made and visualized consciously.
2390;One of the best films of 1999, Fight Club is one tough cinematic pleasure.
2391;Fight Club starts out as a dark comedy and ends as a thrilling drama, which along the way takes you through a wonderful begining and a supriseing climax.
2392;the beginging of this movie is so inventive(right now at 3:37am im at a lack for better words.)
2393;now we get to the good stuff.
2394;this is one of my favorite movies of all time, right up there with Rudy and Pulp Fiction, but why only 4 stars you ask?
2395;This is a very Capitalistic venture by a very anti.
2396;So that takes away 1/2 of a star.
2397;The visuals display and filming is amazing it adds to the feel of the movie.
2398;It is one of those must see movies if you like movies like The Game (If you have not seen this one it is another one worth seeing) you will enjoy this movie.
2399;you probably are not gonna want to watch this one with the kids but it is rather enjoyable.
2400;ray transfer is absolutely outstanding.
2401;well worth the asking price.
2402;if you can get past teh violence and look to the real movie's meaning this movie has the ability to change your life.
2403;Has to be one of my favorite movies of all time.
2404;Norton, Pitt and Carter are perfect as the dysfunctional couple (you have to read or see it to understand that) and Meatloaf Aday is excellent in his role.
2405;The overall message is about freedom, from ideas and material things, and about anarchy.
2406;The story itself will cause you to do a double.
2407;brad Pitt and Edward Norton give intense performances.
2408;This intensity adds to the graphic nature of the violence in this movie.
2409;the movie also has Helena Bonham.
2410;This film is one of director David Finchers' best.
2411;The screenplay is unnerving with the way the movie shoots sequences at you.
2412;And the perverse dialogue borders with such great films as Pulp Fiction and Hannibal.
2413;society masterpiece told with marvelous suspense!
2414;brilliantly directed, photographed, and with amazing performances and charachters (Norton, Pitt and Carter at the top of their games), Fight Club has it all for you movie buffs out there.
2415;Oh and the soundtrack by the Dust Brothers also perfectly fits the movies dark tone.
2416;Instead it challenges the viewer to take a good hard look at their own life.
2417;The cult classic Fight Club has been a favorite of mine for quite some time, and I eagerly awaited its release on Blu.
2418;It is a must for any fan.
2419;He starts going to several self.
2420;help groups every night and soon discovers his bliss.
2421;Our Narrator meets Tyler on a plane trip home, where he soon discovers that Tyler is something special.
2422;Durden shows our narrator how truly exciting life can be, and the two soon develop a great friendship.
2423;They both share the views on life as a prison for their minds, and together they form a secret society where men take out the aggressions of everyday life on each other.
2424;With four, yes four, feature length commentaries, this is a truly extraordinary package.
2425;On disc two, there is a mind.
2426;boggling list of features, the most interesting being the behind the scenes footage of Fincher and crew at work.
2427;Perhaps one of the most visually entertaining parts of the special features is the exploration of the title sequence.
2428;For people who want a taught, thought.
2429;I forgot how awesome this movie is!
2430;I loved watching it and the extras included.
2431;A perfect movie to get you through a quarter life crisis.
2432;I highly recommend reading the book after seeing this movie (really .
2433;this is a rare exception).
2434;I ordered this for my husband because he loves this movie.
2435;this is a great movie!
2436;Edward Norton as always is marvelous.
2437;this film also has an ambitious visual style.
2438;You will see Brad Pitt's character pop on the screen for a single frame in several spots in the movie.
2439;This movie keeps you interested from start to finish.
2440;This movie starts fast, and doesn't slow down until the credits roll.
2441;See it, see it again, and again, and.
2442;well you get my point.
2443;Brilliant, clever, thought provoking, and overall, could be considered a masterpeice.
2444;Then you will know the true definition of a great film.
2445;It is an artistic treat of excellent acting, an excellent story, a nice industrial score, and strange funkyness that never ends.
2446;Not necessarily, although it does feature some fine acting and a great soundtrack.
2447;subtle religious commentary of Dogma.
2448;Kubrick's masterpiece and more contemporary pieces such as Mike Leigh's Naked offer far more thought.
2449;provoking commentaries on the human condition, with the viewer holding as much responsibility as the director for figuring out what the problem is and how to solve it.
2450;Edward Norton plays the part of the business drone at the perfect pitch and pace, allowing his hidden mean streak to slowly but surely emerge to the surface.
2451;As for Brad Pitt, well he manages the near.
2452;Most will return to their 9.
2453;With a heavyweight class including Edward Norton (American History X, 25th Hour), Brad Pitt (Se7en, Inglorious Basterds) and Helena Bonham Carter (The King's Speech, Big Fish), Fight Club is sure to deliver a lethal unexpected right hook sure to knock you on your ass.
2454;Through a new form a therapy that includes viscously brawling with strangers, the values of our society are addressed.
2455;This idea of consumerism taking over is something that most, if not all, of us can relate to.
2456;i would not recommend this movie to anyone with self.
2457;The film is filled with ultra.
2458;This film is something much more than that.
2459;for those who have never been in a fight, those who do not want to die without any scars or anyone who has recently developed insomnia based upon an unfulfilled lifestyle dedicated to collecting various consumer goods, I truly recommend this film.
2460;A fast paced film that hits you and hits you nonstop and does not quit until the end when you are forced to tap out, question your beliefs and values and, experience premature enlightenment, Fight Club is a truly remarkable and unique film.
2461;The film can change your entire idea about the life you lead.
2462;This is the best movie in the world!!
2463;boppers and the sequels to movies unfit for original production, Fight Club is a refreshing alternative.
2464;studded cast, Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, provide the perfect chemistry for this deceptively brilliant critique of the modern man.
2465;David Fincher, who also collaborated with Pitt in the movie Seven, captures the essence Chuck Palahniuk's novel with beautiful cinematography.
2466;Palahniuk, very cleverly, illustrates how disillusioned and materialistic society has become.
2467;underneath the comedy, the drama, and, at times, the brutal violence, lays an exceptional social satire.
2468;They both laugh and express their sympathy for people following the path of superficial self.
2469;I thought that was a goal films
2470;Now it's moved out of the basement.
2471;It's known as Project Mayhem, and the first rule is you don't ask questions.
2472;Things get very interesting when Jack is suddenly pulled away from his meaningless existence (thanks to a blown.
2473;Jack and Tyler find freedom and salvation in violence and Fight Club spreads like wild fire.
2474;This movie blew my mind the first time I saw it!
2475;Its an awesome movie with awesome acting.
2476;but as i started to understand exactly what was going on in my head, i realized that this movie is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen.
2477;if you don't think this is your kind of movie, you are WRONG!it's a movie that everyone can watch: it's funny, violent, romantic (in a twisted way), action packed.
2478;one of the best movies of our generation.
2479;a rollercoaster of mentally intriguing situations, conversations, ideas, forshadowings.
2480;This has been a heavy favorite movie for myself and my group of friends since the time it came out.
2481;its so well done and even funny at moments .
2482;Looking to see a great movie?
2483;I saw Fight Club because I admired Fincher's earlier work and enjoyed the source material by Palahniuk.
2484;Fight Club is one of the best films of all time.
2485;Propelled by amazing visuals, a riveting soundtrack and an undeniably haunting underlying philosophy, Fight Club will forever remian at the top of my favorites list.
2486;The commentary tracks are all great, the sound is great, the video transfer is beautiful, and the extras are great.
2487;The packaging is even cool.
2488;as for the film itself, it is certainly one of my favorites.
2489;Which is understandable, as I feel Chuck Palahniuk is a superior author to Anthony Burgess.
2490;The Fight Club story works on so many levels that you get a bit delerious at times.
2491;yoiu begin to see what the movie is actually about.
2492;This has been one of my favorite movies since I saw it in theaters my senior year of high.
2493;I am very pleased with this Blu.
2494;ray edition and for [.]
2495;It is loaded with special features, and is truly a new experience in watching this great movie.
2496;Anyone questioning if it's worth the upgrade, I say yes!
2497;This is my favorite movie.
2498;I've never enjoyed a non.
2499;adrenaline movie as much as I did this one.
2500;Edward Norton's performance is wonderful.
2501;Norton is believable in every second of the movie.
2502;The story is also brilliant.
2503;I read the book a while later and loved it, although I think I would be less pleased with the movie if I'd read the book first.
2504;The man is a genius.
2505;Survivor, my absolute favorite novel of all time, is satire at its best.
2506;At the end of the movie it was instantly my favorite movie of all time.
2507;He has the right dining sets that define him as a person, the right furniture that looks clever in his perfect little apartment.
2508;He goes to work and does his job well because is expected to.
2509;The 9.5 office job, his near.
2510;perfect wardrobe and his clever yin.yang designed coffee table become too much for him to bear.
2511;You may disagree with its message and find its violence repulsive, but in my opinion it is a fascinating look into the human mind.
2512;You can have many opinions on this film, but see it first and make your own opinion.
2513;On every other level, though, this movie shocks and surprises the viewer, and it is one of the few films in recent years that makes you think, rather than treat the viewer like a mindless zombie.
2514;Ed Norton and Brad Pitt are great together in this movie.
2515;a great surprise ending and a plot that seems terrorist for an American Militia.
2516;a must own for fans of either actor or Down with the system!
2517;packed with so much it should make any collector grab it.
2518;About the film itself, this has shown me that Hollywood can occasionally let out a masterpiece when it stops thinking about demographics and being 'politically correct' (or modern censorship).
2519;This film is gorgeously shot and lighted, the production values are stellar.
2520;I am always impressed with directors who use film as a visual art rather than just sticking a camera on actors.
2521;chosen, extremely subtle and natural.
2522;The script is magnificent, light and thoughtful.
2523;It brings across its ideas in a funny way and avoids dwelling and preaching.
2524;It explores many of the same themes and issues that were brought up in American Beauty, but in a far more risky manner.
2525;From the trailer I had no idea this film is a comedy, a very funny film (my idea of a comedy is a strong story with some really funny moments, NOT a string of punch.
2526;After the film I remembered the humor and the ideas, not the violence.
2527;In order to release their own repressed hostilities, Norton and Pitt begin to fight each other.
2528;i found that though the story was dark and the world within most inhospitable, I would very much enjoy a holiday in this world that Pitt and Norton carve out for themselves.
2529;realistic mirror up to our own world and gives one pause.
2530;I went to see Fight Club the first Saturday it opened only because Ed Norton was in it and I was impressed with his contribution to Rounders .
2531;The movie is purely symbolic .
2532;The story is actually about the 'Feminization of the American Male' and the movie is a very effective though cloaked response.
2533;There are DOZENS of subtle, not so subtle, and hilarious symbolic offerings.
2534;It simply explores how slowly moving cultural attitudes can catch the less circumspect off guard and, well, drive them nutz .
2535;fight Club ranks in importance with A Clockwork Orange as social commentary but, in my opinion, is much more subtle and sophisticated.
2536;This is my favorite movie of all time.
2537;It goes away from the book occasonally, but it is still great.
2538;This is a great movie and should be watched by everybody at least once (but you'll want to watch it again, trust me).
2539;I know you already seen thousands of good reviews about just how great this movie is.
2540;I love this movie because I agree with it and I understand if you don't agree with it but not for stupid made.
2541;I'm a woman and I found this movie great!
2542;Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are wonderful, and Helena Bohnam Carter is sensational as the neurotic Marla.
2543;The fight scenes are so real I wanted to jump up and yell stop!
2544;This movie is a gem and a must see.
2545;All the wild signs point to one man.
2546;This movie is a must see!
2547;This film is not just a highly successful book to film adaptation, (not to mention put Chuck Palahnuik on the map as a respected author) but manages to execute it's dark, witty, clever dialogue in such a timely and entertaining fashion that it remains quite memorable and very satisfying.
2548;The technical part of my review will be saved for the last so I hope you will pace yourself.
2549;Enough said, I will begin.
2550;As a result, Norton's derives a substantial amount of pleasure indulging in magazine catalogs and purchasing various collector set items such as trendy furniture, fashionable dish sets with all the small intended imperfections, tread mills, coffee tables, and other novelties.
2551;Tyler Durden is a very clever, knowledgeable and highly entertaining salesman in the business of selling soap.
2552;He is filled with arbitrary useful facts about potentially explosive household items, history and even philosophy to some extent
2553;There on screen chemistry is highly plausible and works to perfection in every scene.
2554;the narrator and Tyler Durden embark on a dark journey that reveals the truth about themselves and about society as well
2555;The corporation persistently produces this potent and profound feeling of emptiness that strips the narrator of his individuality by artificially organizing it for him.
2556;ok, onto the technical specs of this masterpiece because that is what this film is and looks like, a masterpiece.
2557;I did a thorough compare and contrast and it was worth every minute of to see the nice upgrade make it to my home.
2558;cinematically, this is a very dark film indeed that manages to seamlessly and effectively intertwine with the nature of the material presented.
2559;Black levels are incredibly deep and consistent that allow some of the more bright colors to filter through quite nicely, particularly in the underground garage scenes.
2560;Pay attention to the vibrant and lively green neon reflections when the camera rapidly spirals down into the garage to expose the detonated explosives.
2561;Flesh tones are real and appear very natural and lifelike throughout the entire film whether it is during the abundant night shots, the interior house on paper st, the underground garage, or the massive corporate buildings.
2562;When Edward Norton attempts to deactivate one of the sets of explosives in the white van pay close attention to the sweat drops on his forehead or Brad Pitt's light facial hair, amazing.
2563;The Dust Brothers will immerse you in it's highly unusual and nerve racking industrial score.
2564;All of your speakers will given the royal treatment with this one, I can assure you on this.
2565;I can also rest assure you that your subwoofer will not be left alone in the dark either as explosions will vibrate your floor while the heart pounding score will add a nice touch to the unsettling atmosphere.
2566;this by far one of the most superior and worthy Blu Rays out on the Market.
2567;great delivery time, worked perfectly, full film plus bonus features, i highly recommend it to any one who likes fight club
2568;I've owned this movie in ever special edition format released.
2569;There is so much going on in this movie.
2570;Commentary on society, dark humor, solid action, great acting, incredible camera work.
2571;Really, top to bottom, this is one of the best movies ever.
2572;If you have and for some reason, don't own it, please see my previous remark.
2573;U cant beat the price.
2574;It was one of the best, well written, well acted movies of 1999.
2575;It was one of the best I'd ever seen.
2576;The direction was good, the angles were good.
2577;You name it, it was good.
2578;If you're going to watch any Brad Pitt or Ed Norton movie, make it this one.
2579;They say a great movie is one that makes you think.
2580;Yes, there is an extraordinary amount of violence, but after you watch it you'll want to watch it again to fully take in the storyline.
2581;This has been one of my all time favorite films.
2582;I can admit that the performances in this movie were very well acted and I can see how some people do like this movie alot, however I am not one of these people.
2583;fIGHT CLUB is stunning and ultra.
2584;The solution, he believes, is to fight and give up being perfect.
2585;There is one scene that is especially grotesque and beautiful in illustrating the paradox of FIGHT CLUB.
2586;CGI is very effective throughout.
2587;very surreal and fun to look at.
2588;Fincher did a great job.
2589;The looks from the crowds and people he encounters become clearer and you understand that he is beating himself up and obviously talking to himself the entire movie.
2590;but rather, the psychological aspects of it that make your mind flutter throughout the movie.
2591;Brad and Edward's performances cap off the incredible symbolic and idealistics that set this movie apart from others.
2592;I thought it was an insightful look at a lost generation and how they have to outlet their frustration.
2593;Edward Norton is always watchable.
2594;I liked the film because it gave a particular viewpoint of the book.
2595;I also very much enjoyed the book and most of the time, I don't enjoy the movie version of books I enjoy.
2596;this is honestly the best movie i have ever seen!
2597;After watching it many times you start to see the simple wisdom hidden in it.
2598;tyler is pushing Ed Norton to wake up and see things as they really are.
2599;this is a great film, not simply guys fighting.
2600;you can view the movie with the director, actors, scene designers, and writers.
2601;It is truly one of a kind.
2602;As I see it a story is good if it can be real.
2603;inside young person will like, with a message to thirty year olds (like me) and older who see the consumerism running rampant in our culture, and the danger is presents to the identity of the consumer.
2604;It shows the world where they are heading and is unintentionally humorous by how it shows the truth directly.
2605;In a way, this movie inspires us to re analyze our own lives.
2606;It made us ask the question, are you happy?
2607;It tells us to stop complaining and do what you want.
2608;The direction is wonderfully done.
2609;Fight club is a classic.
2610;One of the best and most thought provoking movies of our time.
2611;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton bring this movie alive and you can't help but laugh at the parts involving Meat Loaf.
2612;I thought this movie looked dumb, but then one of my friends saw it and said it was awesome and was able to convince me to go see, which I did.
2613;I loved it so much, I saw it again, which is very rare.
2614;What more can I say, you know the first two rules.
2615;at least it is social commentary in the tradition of A Modest Proposition and at most it is high art.
2616;Director Fincher uses rich visual cues and subliminal techniques that seap into your conciousness.
2617;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton deliver dynamic performances that they trully enjoyed delivering.
2618;This special feature suits this film very well and the information shared by the director and stars is fascinating.
2619;I thoroughly enjoy watching this film over and over again and hope that you will too.
2620;I like to refer to it as fashionably late actually.
2621;He recommended it and loaned a copy to me.
2622;Then, in the same moment he got it, I got it.
2623;I honestly never saw the twist coming and I was still stunned days later when trying to unravel it all.
2624;I think this is gonna be one of those watch it again now that I understand it all kinda movies.
2625;But I highly recommend this one if you are fashionably late like me.
2626;The packaging itself reflects the creative, self aware and at times self mocking element that is certainly akin to this movie's spirit.
2627;This is a movie for everyone.
2628;Feel the fury, reach deep inside, and find the Fight Clubber in you.
2629;Fight Club is like Seven in an important respect: it shows a lot of human bodies being mistreated.
2630;uNfortunately, this movie is much more funny and entertaining than Seven.
2631;It's even insightful about what people do when their life has no meaning or purpose.
2632;simply watching this movie is a self.
2633;It is seductive and entertaining, while inciting hatred for good, productive people.
2634;the movie itself is the cinematic incarnation of Tyler Durden himself.
2635;It appeals to your inner criminal.
2636;sadly, it is extremely well executed.
2637;The film is a technical masterpiece, worthy of study by future directors.
2638;This is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.
2639;notch job by Fincher)
2640;Also, the tone is lightened quite a bit by the 'dark' comedy present throughout.
2641;anyway, just watch it with an open mind.
2642;And realize it is, to a great extent, a satire of both our consumer culture AND nihilism.
2643;It is something far greater.
2644;namely, the most perfect portrait of modern society ever set down on a plastic sheet.
2645;Part of its greatness lies in the fact that it is a true antiestablishment film, which have been quite rare since the Sixties, and being recognized by the establishment would have been rather contradictory.
2646;in short, Fight Club is the most important and the best film made in the past several years.
2647;While I have heard that the film only appeals to GenX'ers, it is also extremely powerful for those like me in the 25 and under category, who are also seeking philosophical foundations in a hypocritical, apathetic, cynical, and indeed, wholly unpleasant society.
2648;what starts out as suburban white guys whining about how they can no longer assume as a given a life of effortless wealth, privilege, and power turns into something much more elemental.
2649;the movie is well made, well acted, and visually interesting.
2650;It makes important points about the amorality of megacorporations and the inadequacy of consumer capitalism as a substitute for independence, worthwhile work, and fulfillment.
2651;and nobody's life is fun every minute of every day.
2652;Fight Club is still a movie about picking fistfights and blowing stuff up, of course.
2653;His frustration for his career is so vivid (and not played for fun, ala Office Space), that this is possibly Norton's best performance (considering his body of work that is really saying something).
2654;He was born to be Tyler Durden.
2655;Pitt is phenomenal as Durden and commands each scene he is in with such charismatic force, he forever erases the pretty boy tags that have been unfairly cast upon him.
2656;while they are often overlooked (in the midst of powerhouse performances by Norton and Pitt), Helena Bonham Carter's Marla Singer is a sympathetic and integral character, as is Meatloaf's Robert Bob Paulsen.
2657;while Fight Club is a masterpiece.
2658;last Thought: The best line in Fight Club, This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time is a classic one and, while will never enter pop culture mainstream the way lines from Scareface or Sudden Impact, have it certainly hits home and has more personal relevance than many other tired and overused quotes.
2659;Anyone who's seen it knows what I'm talking about on this one.
2660;This aside, it needs to be said that Fight Club is absolutly unlike anything most people are prepared to see, and this is why it is so excellent.
2661;disc set maked it nice for anyone who just wants to see the movie and no nonsence.
2662;But I'm a big fan of fighting movies so when I saw this, it blew my mind.
2663;paying career, a lavish lifestyle, and goes to disorder meetings for comfort (even though he is perfectly normal), the other is satisfied without material posessions, lives in an abandoned house, and has a great knowledge of explosives.
2664;While I learned something new about how the human psyche works, I also regained a new love for fighting.
2665;I recommend this movie whole heartedly.
2666;This is by far one of the best films to come out of our so. called Generation X (I loved their first album).
2667;It is a mantra for our lost souls, it shows us the truth about consumerism and materialism.
2668;Fight Club helps this process along considerably.
2669;Besides that, Ed Norton is one of the most versitile actors working right now and is performance is EXCELLENT.
2670;It has now achieved cult status.
2671;While on its surface it appears to be a celebration of male violence it is much more than that.
2672;fight Club is a modern allegory which deals with redemption and salvation, although turning these concepts on their head.
2673;Edward Norton does a great job as the disillusioned male filled with self loathing searching for the meaning of what it is to be a man in the mordern world.
2674;As Pitt's character observes in a memorable line, This is your life and it's ending one minute at a timeBrad Pitt does a great job of portraying the glib charismatic one dimensional proto.
2675;It sounds odd to me but it works in the movie.
2676;helena Bonham Carter hands in a good, but not great performance, as the female foil.
2677;this is a movie that you have to watch until the end.
2678;There are plot twists and surprises which are epic.
2679;This is one movie that is better the next day as you turn it over in your head.
2680;But what I really like about this movie is that unlike many of the shallow and flat movies that never strive for anything more than entertainment, this movie reaches higher and manages to hit the high notes enough that make it worth the experience.
2681;pleasant point in his life, and the film flashes back to a time shortly before Narrator meets Durden.
2682;Though it evidently pays well, (based upon his very well.
2683;While at first he denies that was the intent of his having called him, he finally gives in and asks Durden if he'd mind.
2684;Durden returns the punch and they end up both 'going at it.'
2685;Much to his surprise, Narrator finds that the fight was absolutely exhilarating.
2686;And thus begins a very strange, but very well.
2687;it's got a strong plot, strong ideas, and the truth of this film is undeniable, unless you wish to lie to yourself or others: men are violent and should accept it.
2688;In my case, I found the plot and characters very interesting.
2689;But Fight Club's director, David Fincher (Se7en, Alien 3) does what he does best in creating a dark, creepy setting, full of plot twists and clever dialogue.
2690;In the beginning, Fight Club is full of humor.
2691;PS: For another good thriller that makes youthink, I recommend the Usual Suspects.
2692;More to this movie than meets the mind, at first watch.
2693;A movie about what we do with the time we have.
2694;The film is a definite must!
2695;ignore the gory effects, focus on the details, enjoy, think, and at the end of the day .
2696;This is possibly the best movie to come out in the past 5 or 10 years.
2697;This was one of the most underatted movies of the year.
2698;The movie is soo good, that immidately after watching the movie, you want to see it again.
2699;Brad Pitt really fit the part of Tyler Durden and Edward Norton was great.
2700;Filled with dark humor, crucial points and one of a kind directing from David Fincher whose made another classic movie, Seven, as well.
2701;I found Fight Club to be an excellent movie, as the title of my review suggests.
2702;Although ultraviolent, this movie is also well crafted with spot on direction.
2703;It's also a visually stunning movie with cleverly interweaved effects.
2704;David Finch's direction, Brad Pitt is hilarious and great, Edward Norton magnificent, Helena Bonham Carter too.
2705;The art direction is beautiful.
2706;The real fight, here, is personal.
2707;There are making off of most interesting scenes, lots of commentaries, a funny faux products catalog and other things that'll keep you entertained for many times.
2708;A daring film by Fincher, Pitt, and Norton.
2709;This disc is one you'll not only play again and again for its stunning visual effects and twisting tale turns, you'll have it running on you big screen as background art for your next party performance.
2710;The constellation of outstanding writing, convincing acting and daring direction make this movie a work of tremendous accomplishment, often under.
2711;I've read the scores of comprehensive reviews of this extraordinary film here at Amazon.
2712;Just right.4) The Sixth Sense style revelation about four.
2713;It takes a second disc to fit them all.
2714;Nuff said.6) The amazingly funny scenes.
2715;8) The great packaging, colorful and eye.
2716;Meat Loaf were all perfectly in tune with the material and made us totally believe in them, despite the crazy situations in which they found themselves.
2717;And Meat Loaf accomplished that while wearing large female breasts for the duration of the film!
2718;outstanding performances by Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, and Helena Bonham.
2719;This movie is the best directed movie I've seen and is definitely in my Top Ten.
2720;This movie is very well.
2721;directed, and has a very clever and twisted plot.
2722;I have to say that I loved this movie!
2723;It is funny,exciting, and filled with fights.
2724;This movie is my favorite.
2725;It ended up being a great choice for Independence Day.
2726;Consumerism can be a soul taking action once people begin to equate what they own with who they are.
2727;As many of my generation I grew up with the wonderful electronic babysitter.
2728;Raising an issue to provoke thought.
2729;From begiining to end this visually stunning and superbly directed film takes you for one wild ride.
2730;Beneath the bare fisted brawls and raging choas sprawls an intense web of deep philosophical meaning.
2731;A profoundly moving yet visceral film, Fight CLub delivers.
2732;I give this movie five big stars.
2733;I also highly recommend the book, by Chuck Palahniuk for a thoroughly enjoyable read.
2734;The script is sharply perceptive, with a mean wit.
2735;director David Fincher imbues the film with a style that's very fresh and modern without resorting to hackneyed tricks like quick edits (although there are a few choice ones.
2736;Fincher manages to film them beautifully.
2737;ed Norton is great as the narrator, but hey, he's great in everything.
2738;Great, ballsy performance by Helena Bonham Carter as an unlikely ingenue.
2739;I hate to say it, but he was really really really good.
2740;Odd story line, but caught my attention, and held it
2741;And that's just on disk 1!
2742;It's been ten years since Fight Club helped redefine American cinema.
2743;It's aged well, and it's still frighteningly relevant.
2744;Really, it's all about the flick.
2745;David Fincher is at the top of his game.
2746;He is albe to keep the film moving forward in an interesting way while Tyler and Jack continue to examine their role in a society that cares more about the rich and famous than the other 99.9% of the world.
2747;The adaptation from Chuck Palahniuk's book is excellent.
2748;All in all the movie is engaging while at the same time extremely fun to watch.
2749;Well, this is one of the BEST movies I've ever seen.
2750;When you watch it, you WILL feel something, and you will think about it.
2751;So like i said, when you watch it, you will feel it.
2752;The movie itself is very underrated by many critics and viewers.
2753;The performances are very good, especially Helena Bohnam Carter and director David Fincher manages to create a moody surreal atmosphere that is both beautiful and horrific.
2754;a real american classic, i absolutely love the story and the depth that this movie has.
2755;I would recommend this to anyone!
2756;Who thought director David Fincher would ever be able to best his career over the amazing Se7en?
2757;But it was more than good.
2758;This film was turned out to actually be masterful, hip and expertly crafted.
2759;brad Pitt and Edward Norton are both confident and experienced actors.
2760;Here they prove that they will carry on to be some of the most watchable character actors of our time.
2761;Helan Bonham Carter also proves she is one of the most capable British actresses at the moment.
2762;prepare to be blown away with this incredible flick overflowing with brains and thrills.
2763;amazing, disturbing, riveting, strangely funny (nervous laughter), and utterly can't.
2764;A perfect commentary on the hyper.
2765;I love this movie and immediately bought a copy.
2766;If you are in your late twenties, early thirties you will feel all warm and cozy after this movie.
2767;It is the movie of our generation.
2768;It is a crazy ride and you must watch it twice to truly appreciate its strangeness.
2769;I hope for your sake that you don't know the bizarre twist because it makes it even better.
2770;The movie itself is a rare masterpiece by one of America's most innovative young filmmakers, although many critics were too short.
2771;Everything about the movie is excellent: The innovative plot, the acting, the settings, the cool CGI special effects, the subliminal messages, the disparate interpretations on just what the movie's message was.
2772;anyways maybe it's just me but this movie really got into my head.
2773;tyler durden's ideas and beliefs really make me question society and the lives of people around me.
2774;that song still sends shivers up my spine every time i hear it.
2775;i almost forgot the girl in the movie marla is the most beautiful girl i've ever seen.
2776;Immature young men will be deliciously provoked by this movie
2777;he won't allow us to simply absorb what we're seeing
2778;old boys who will make a cult phenom of it, forever placing it in the ranks of the Cool Movies.
2779;Other than that everything was perfect.
2780;This is still to date one of my favorite movies to ever be created.
2781;ray just made it even more epic.
2782;Fight Club is an excellent portrayal of what happens when men face up to the stupid, mean, and vulgar degredation they put up with as cogs in the machine of modern life.
2783;It is a very possible reaction to Radiohead's OK Computer, the best musical elaboration of the post.
2784;Nietzsche's ideas are so novel and challanging that most fans of Fight Club can overlook the nonsensical climax and enjoy the social commentary.
2785;david Fincher is a exellent director showing off superb Camera work from start to finish.
2786;Acting is also pulled of extremely well by the likes of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.
2787;This movie keeps you interested the entire time, and throws you for a loop at the end.
2788;I would recommend that everyone see this film.
2789;This may be a great movie to watch if you have not seen in it a long time.
2790;It is a black comedy featuring social commentary and revolutionary visuals.
2791;It also features one of the greatest acting talents of our time, Edward Norton, as well as one of the most underrated actors, Brad Pitt, in a fantastic journey through the dark heart of american men.
2792;The cinematography, direction, sound and computer effects are all outstanding.
2793;Well, it started as a novel, and it was quite consistent and faithful to the original.
2794;I personally thought the ending was fantastic, and gave the film a second layer where before there was but one.
2795;This movie requires your full attention and an open mind.
2796;Simply enjoy the world it creates and don't judge.
2797;And as this film tells us, we have to fight against that urge to conform to what our society would otherwise tell us to embody: a productive worker.
2798;This Movie was easily the greatest movie I have ever seen.
2799;This movie told you to think outside the box, so natuarally those who cling to the inner walls of the box will resent the message in this movie.
2800;While Fight Club is a film because it certainly did not make money, it also gives the world a message about your world and how to percieve it.
2801;Dark, humorous and totally bizarre, with interesting characters played by an awesome cast.
2802;I saw this in the theater in 1999, and watch it religiously 15 years later.
2803;fights to see the brutal beauty of what this film is.
2804;This film (as well as the novel it is based on) are like Hemingway on steroids, but with more intelligence.
2805;this is an excellently acted, directed and produced film.
2806;Can one appreciate great acting based on a bombastic self.
2807;There, right there, is the reviewer's dilemma.
2808;The beautiful chain smoking beauty that comes between tham, and the underground bloody mayhem of Fight Club.
2809;this is a great movie, well cast and superbly acted.
2810;There's a lot going on underneath the surface, clues to the excellent twist at the end.
2811;So, we've got cute guys, shirtless and beating each other up as a form of therapy, a psychological twist that will make your head spin and lots of mayhem on the side for fun.
2812;A formula for a witty and thought.
2813;(Even if the only thoughts that are provoked are: Wow, Brad Pitt is really really cute! )
2814;I loved the weaving dynamics of the story, and it's dichotomy of societal issues and personal growth.
2815;As with most great movies, this one was hated.
2816;Kudos to you, 20th Century Fox.
2817;A riotous mixture of philisophical wanings, whimsical musings, and technical meanerings, this was one of the highlights of my days for a FEW days.
2818;I do however recommend watching the publis service announcements.
2819;So in conclusion, I rate this a four star product.
2820;I don't even like violence, but this is one of my favorite films.
2821;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were both excellent in their roles.
2822;bop heart throb, which I always believed was an unfair description.
2823;i respect the way the film followed the book closely, and I think it actually worked even better on the sceen.
2824;It contains lots of nifty extras, that are very entertaining all alone.
2825;Fight Club treats this world with stylish, comedic objectivity.
2826;They create a substrata free of social affectations, or more accurately replace these with their own.
2827;There is a sinister side to this subculture in the flesh, exemplified in gangsters, hooligans, skinheads and wall street raiders
2828;The film is very well acted.
2829;The message is its all around you, seeing it is just a question of attitude.
2830;Fincher loads on the music, the witty voice.
2831;over and superbly placed visuals.
2832;Best movie in the history of ever.
2833;Seriously one of my favorite movies of all time.
2834;it is such a psychological trip.
2835;The more times you watch it, the better it gets.
2836;Immediately he begins to find some relief and makes a new friend named Bob who is suffering from testicular cancer.
2837;But he also finds an intriguing young woman named Marla Singer who also enjoys frequenting support groups.
2838;After a series of possibly unfortunate events, he finds himself staying with a very new friend named Tyler Durden.
2839;After an open invitation to fight one another outside of a bar one evening, the two develop a special bond and begin Fight Club.
2840;with an ultimate cast of Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf and director David Fincher, this amazing adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's book is definitely worthwhile for anyone looking for a psychological thriller that will keep you in search of the answer until the last few scenes.
2841;This is definitely one of those movies where you must sit through start to finish to fully understand.
2842;After watching it the first time, viewers will be able to pick up on little hints throughout the film which make every time an enjoyable experience.
2843;I'll be honest, the first time i watched this movie, i hated it.
2844;this is one of those movies that needs to be viewed twice, and i know reviews usually say something along the movies plot line, but to do that with Fight Club might risk giving something away.
2845;A great movie with an interesting story.
2846;Excellent acting, Ed Norton was SUPERB.

2849;The 'plot' is simple, (yet you WILL want to see it at least twice!)
2850;good' context), because these only feature in a small portion of the film.
2851;Yes, it is violent, but moreover it is also hilariously funny and often extremely poignant.
2852;I have never seen this movie till a friend told me about it!
2853;These are the kind of movies I love!
2854;Great addition to my library.
2855;My god, this movie kicks.
2856;It is needless to say that this movie is great.
2857;I'd like to thank people who made this good movie.
2858;I bet you'll enjoy this movie.
2859;army, and the ending of the film is one of the most surprising twists ever in a movie.
2860;Surprisingly, Meat Loaf (that's right.
2861;this movie is destined to be a classic.
2862;Powerful dialogues, breathtaking performances, suspense at every scene, and a study in sociology and humanity, only a few movies have reached the intensity of Fight Club.
2863;It's a film that demands to be analyzed and seen many times for pleasure or observation.
2864;I was really excited about seeing this, too, being a big fan of Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter.
2865;the majority of the movie was really great, it kept me watching because of the great mixture of drama, comedy, and violence.
2866;the second time, I enjoyed it even more.
2867;The acting is amazing, the story line is great, but it has a deeper ending than you would come to expect from a movie about a Fight Club.
2868;It's a piece of art, very well done for what it set out to do.
2869;It has a lot of good messages about what life is and how it needs to change.
2870;It makes you think which is good.
2871;I actually watched it for a class at Seminary.
2872;The debasement of the flesh, which many Saints throughout the century took on as a way to get to the spiritual is a theme in the movie.
2873;David Fincher (in my personal opinion) is the personification of what is truly great about film making today.
2874;Fight Club is a perfect example of how intelligent, beautifully shot films can make it in mainstream Hollywood.
2875;I was telling everyone it was the best film of all time.
2876;I was under the influence or brilliance, and genuine originality.
2877;vaporizingly Magnificent Fargo was, i would have probably enjoyed it immensely.)
2878;I needed to be able to discuss it with her, and i felt uniquely qualified, or at least willing to help her watch it.
2879;It evolves from a editorial on modern materialism to a true psycologial odyssey.
2880;Had to watch this movie for a class I was taking, but really enjoyed watching it.
2881;This is in my opinion, one of the best movies of last year.
2882;The acting is superb and so is the writing.
2883;Yeah, so there is a lot of fist fighting, but for the exception of one fight, everyone is a good sport whether they win or lose.
2884;I'm sure a fight could be a liberating experience because most of us go through life trying to avoid confrontation for whatever reason.
2885;Even better at this price.
2886;The acting was amazing: boy, has Brad Pitt really come a long way from his Cool World and Thelma and Louise days.
2887;he was absolutely wonderful as the psychotic Tyler Durden.
2888;i keep gaining more and more respect for this actor.
2889;Ever since his debut in Primal Fear, he has proven that he is one of the best actors in hollywood today.
2890;All I can say,is David Fincher, you are a genious!
2891;I do recommend that everyone sees this movie.
2892;also, check out the soundtrack.
2893;it is amazing and full of energy!
2894;movie translation of this title is by far the best rendition I have ever seen.
2895;fight Club is really a piece of art, and the actors and directors did a great job.
2896;Now that I have, my personal reaction can be summed up in this way: I respect the film's skill and style, but how were so many people sucked into swallowing this film whole?Yes, this film is very well.
2897;Director David Fincher is a virtuoso film stylist, and he brings his hard.
2898;It is his unrelenting but occasionally exciting style, as well as the good performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, that carries you along through most of the movie: this is a movie that vibrates with fever and energy, and the first half.
2899;hour of the movie really does draw you into the Narrator's dead.
2900;(The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is often strikingly gritty.)
2901;In its own way, FIGHT CLUB is a gripping visceral achievement.
2902;Did people really actually take this film's big twist SERIOUSLY?
2903;David Fincher is undoubtedly a talented filmmaker.
2904;but this film is basically a triumph of style over substance.
2905;No words can describe how great this movie is :x This is a David Fincher Master piece that can never be topped.
2906;Edward Norton is the greatest actor of our time.
2907;This is his best role since 'American History X'.
2908;This was Brad Pitt's best role ever.
2909;Hands down, the best movie I have ever seen.
2910;Watch it and then watch it again.
2911;Based on the novel, Fight Club is a true cinematic masterpiece!
2912;One of the best movies I've ever seen.
2913;There's fighting, drama, philosiphy, sex, an intricate storyline, and the power to bring hordes of people together.
2914;While the critics hated it, this is one of the greatest movies ever made!
2915;haha Gotta love it so much.
2916;The kind of movies that retain a certain level of theatrical magic the big movie houses hold.
2917;He takes an excellent book, and makes it even better with the additions of Ed Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham.
2918;(Can you tell I liked it?)
2919;When Pitt's character criticizes the image of mans toned physique in a CK ad on a bus, one has to laugh.
2920;The point of the movie, the message, is still retained.
2921;If you seek a more fulfilling life as did Ed Norton's character, you can relate to this movie.
2922;Yes!All of your questions are answered!
2923;Every once in a while, you see a film that actually gives you something to really think about long after you leave the movie theater.
2924;Brad Pitt's and Edward Norton's superb performance will captivate you through this unabashedly anti.
2925;And add to that a script where the writer is willing to challenge just about everything we take from granted in our urban societies, and you've got something that will keep your mind twisting for a long time after you see this film.
2926;And if you thought that was all, check this out: the film has a storyline with completely unexpected events that just keep getting more shocking towards the end of the film.
2927;Among the many things this film will give you to think about is what kind of minds came together to produce this absolutely twisted and yet remarkable piece of work.
2928;i enjoy this movie quite a lot and have been waiting to get a new copy of it since my old one was destroyed.
2929;Edward Norton a mealy mouthed insurance inspector runs into his antihero, a wise smart mouth punk, who knows what ails today's men.
2930;Surprisingly clubs spring up everywhere.
2931;This is really a great film if you're planning to be part of the new revolution
2932;Fight Club is by far one of the best films that I have ever seen.
2933;It has a fantastic premise and you never really know what is going to happen next.
2934;The characters are fantastic and the message itself will make you think quite a bit.
2935;After seeing it once, you will want to watch it again.
2936;My only complaint at all for the movie is the bit of hypocrisy in the message of the film.
2937;Besides that, Fight Club is still one of the greatest.
2938;The price was great and the movie was even better.
2939;Fight Club is a powerful film, on all levels, but most importantly it displays the power of the mind to overcome all obstacles.
2940;the more times you view this film the more you will learn, and so I would highly recommend purchasing it.
2941;but just understand that the movie is intense and simply awesome.
2942;Get it and see for yourself.
2943;I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
2944;which means this is an awesome movie!
2945;Very enjoyable movie, subject matter was inspired.
2946;He suddenly has the answers to the chicken and the egg question.
2947;Ed Norton is terrific he should have won an academy award for his part.
2948;This is a complex, layered, multi faceted plot delivered in a crisp visually stunning manner.
2949;What's great is all of these pieces, a wounded romance, anti.
2950;even setting aside the very original plot, the movie itself is just great to look at.
2951;The pacing, presentation, acting, and foreshadowing are all perfect.
2952;loud, original, technically impressive, and fun with a mind game ending that makes you analyze the entire film again.
2953;When I saw this movie at the theatres, I was absolutely riveted, and was shocked when I read the slams it got from the critics.
2954;This is one of the best films of last year, and it was hardly recognized.
2955;edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter are amazing in their roles.
2956;This movie is absolutely hilarious, and the dialogue is wonderful (most of it coming from the book, which I also recommend highly).
2957;this movie shows what our society has become, and what we, as people, are becoming.
2958;So why did so many people love Amerian Beauty so much?)
2959;I believe that Fight Club is one of the greatest movies of our time.
2960;Not only is it superbly acted and directed, the story line is just cool.
2961;The novel was great, but the movie is in a way better because of all of the visual effects that were supplied.
2962;I would give this movie more than five stars.
2963;Fight Club was a great movie.
2964;just all around a very interesting flick .
2965;Davis Fincher packs a wallop of criteria with a riveting twist ending that will wash you out.
2966;Is the only thing in this life that you must own and to be proud of it(Ofcours Mr. tyler Durden will be oposite to this).
2967;do you want to dedicate your life to win this ideas that the modern world wants to record in our minds?
2968;did you bring the soap with you?
2969;The movie is excellent, supurb, a masterpiece.
2970;The commentary is the best ive heard in awhile.
2971;gleefully funny, yes, and as with all of Fincher's movies, beautifully shot, Fight Club is great.
2972;Norton and Pitt are two of their generations greatest actors and Helena Bonham Carter is also quite good.
2973;You can see from the packaging that Fox really put an effort into making this a package worth owning.
2974;With numerous videos showcasing the making of the movie and photo galleries and lots more, the extras are very very good.
2975;It makes you wonder what kind of people really do this sort of thing to each other.
2976;It's in my top 10, and I've seen THOUSANDS.
2977;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are both so brilliant in this, and they both play so brilliantly off each other, that it's all just.
2978;One of the best movies EVER!
2979;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are a great pair .
2980;this movie is definitely a classic!
2981;It's one of thosemovies that stays with you.
2982;It was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
2983;watching it again makes me realize how ahead of its time it is.
2984;I still think this is Fincher's crowning achievement and Brad Pitt's finest performance.
2985;1999 was truly a exciting time for the film medium
2986;Give this puppy a few decades and it will be seen as perhaps the finest celluloid expression of millenial ennui/nihilism.
2987;knuckle brawling, and its visceral point hits home hard.
2988;In the anesthetized homogenized consumerist vacuum of a culture that we call home, it takes at least a few solid shots to the jaw to begin to wake up from our American Dream/Nightmare.
2989;This is one of the most subversive major studio films of all time, intelligently deconstructing modern film and the entertainment/distraction industry in general.
2990;so many hidden details, so much black humor (the Ikea lifestyle catalog scene is brilliant), three excellent lead performances, tremendous writing (Palahniuk must have been thrilled with the adaptation), a wild score, state of the art editing, sets, and direction, and so much more.
2991;The underlying themes are incredible and so true, (which have to be credited to their creator, Palahniuk, who is also amazing).
2992;I read the book after I saw the movie and I definitely enjoyed the book a lot.
2993;But this movie was incredible.
2994;Also, I've said it before: Edward Norton is a fantastic actor.
2995;He was perfect for that role.
2996;was by far one of the best I've seen this year.
2997;It stands out as one of five great scripts that we'll ever see transformed onto the screen from this past year.
2998;Each of these writers are geniuses in their own right.
2999;This movie grabbed me by my shirt and beat the **** out of me with it's raw feel and it's dark, witty, inventive script and direction.
3000;So I sat through another hour and 30 sum minutes and enjoyed the hell out of it!
3001;The first half of this film is breathtaking in its pacing, cinematography and narrative style.
3002;while not always completely intelligent it carries its message well.
3003;deserves more credit than it got
3004;The product itself is very good.
3005;It has great packaging, great supplementary, and four great tracks.
3006;the movie has a great theme.
3007;That theme is backed with great acting by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, two great actors.
3008;This is the best movie I've seen in years, both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt were amazing.
3009;It is very well made and the cinematography is great.
3010;This is by far the most original movie I've ever seen.
3011;All I can say is go and see it with an open mind and just sit back and enjoy the ride!
3012;I've seen this movie about 400 million times so it's fair to say I like it.
3013;I am Jack's impressed brain.
3014;Speedy Delivery, perfect condition, and overall a working product that you get what you pay for.
3015;Great job as always by Amazon with packaging and such.
3016;This has got to be my favorite movie ever made.
3017;This film also shocked me with frank but intelligant philosophy, stunning performances credited to Helena Bonham Carter and Edward Norton, and original.
3018;while this is all well and good, his encounter with the vivaciously.
3019;Collectively, this film was amazingly written, directed, acted, filmed, and produced to create one of the most misunderstood and underrated films of the decade.
3020;See this film for everything it can offer you.
3021;This is easily in my top favorite movies of all time.
3022;There is a great story line and has a wonderful soundtrack
3023;There is little I can say about this film that is worthwhile.
3024;The reason that I rate it as a two star film is for the twist ending, which was really very clever.
3025;Overall though, this is a wonderful example of pop cultural trash being hailed as high art .
3026;If you want to see something in a somewhat similar spirit that IS worthwhile check out Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange .
3027;a film that has value.
3028;haha Seriously, my teen son loves this movie.
3029;Sooo, I bought him this for a couple bucks and goodbye Netflix .
3030;this movie is very stylish, which is something I appreciate in movies.
3031;On top of some pretty cool fight scenes, the humorous parts of this movie are very funny, the most memorable for me was when Tyler Durden and Norton's nameless character steal from a liposuction clinic.
3032;It has just the right amount of action, comedy, and one incredibly weird plot twist.
3033;About 14 times later, I think the movie is brilliant.
3034;The menu screen is very funny when you first pop the film in.
3035;I would recommend people to watch this flick.
3036;This is a great a movie.
3037;I really like the quirky film.
3038;Tyler Durbin is an interesting character!
3039;The extreme fights, the terrorism on conformists, and the fresh performances by Brad Pitt (who is absolutely outstanding), and Edward Norton are a few things that make Fight Club one of my favorite films of all time.
3040;If anything, you should see this film to see the surprise ending, and to see Pitt and Norton go out on a limb in their careers.
3041;But in this film he made a change that was absolutly amazing.
3042;and I think that this film should receive more credit.
3043;But with his job he is actually happy.
3044;and he is also content with letting go of everything just to reamin happy.
3045;recruits are brought in, the house becomes a safe place for these guys to enjoy what they like.
3046;THis is an excellent movie.
3047;Kinda gruesome in parts but wow, what an awesome movie.
3048;One of those with the trick endings that you just have to watch several times over and have all the aha!
3049;My boyfriend literally watches this movie on a weekly basis and love the interviews that the second disc provides.
3050;Great present with a great value, I couldn't ask for more!
3051;i think the focus of any review of this film should be meat loaf's extremely skilled and realistic acting.
3052;respect for his skills as a performer and as a stage and film actor should be the mainstay of the perception of his career.
3053;i have so much respect for him that i sat through Motorama just to view his small part, yet he is so good that i have watched fight club on numerous occasions.
3054;it took a career spanning from films such as roadie to gain the respect he deserves as a serious actor.
3055;fight club was a fantastic and intelligent movie whose casting directors had the brain to cast this extraordinary actor in a part that allowed him to showcase his abilities.
3056;Like 1996's Primal Fear, Fight Club is a film that must be watched repeatedly in order to fully comprehend its cinematic brilliance.
3057;Clues that lead the viewer to the plot twist near the end of the film can be seen throughout the movie, which makes it necessary to see this movie more than once.
3058;What is so convincing about it, however, is that we can all somehow relate to Edward Norton's character, who finds himself trapped in the machinery of modern life.
3059;consumer status because, after all, people like him are the ones who make the world go round.
3060;This was a great film, with original ideas and frightening points about the lives which we all find ourselves living.
3061;Stays true to the storyline and is still an awesome movie.
3062;The real star of this movie is director David Fincher, the editor and the screenwriter.
3063;Norton and Pitt are very good, as usual.
3064;But the story is so well.
3065;paced and startling in its originality that .
3066;well, you just have to see it.
3067;One disk is the movie, the other is bonus footage of deleted scenes, interview with actors and crew and a lot of other cool stuff.
3068;This was a Christmas gift for my grandson.
3069;He was very happy with, so I'm very happy with it.
3070;The best thing about David Fincher's masterpiece is that you can take away what you want from this film.
3071;That is sort of the theme and the beauty of this film because that is how real life is.
3072;Being able to watch this film and draw your own conclusions it what makes this film so special.
3073;Additionally it is probably one of the most well photographed and edited films ever.
3074;Stars Brad Pitt and Edward Norton form the Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid for a new generation.
3075;They perfectly represent a generation that does not want to be told where they are going, they want to find out, but are not sure how.
3076;You have a good concept here.
3077;Just rein it in and give it some focus.
3078;Because this film is still great, and is now commonly known as a cult classic.
3079;the movie is still watchable and the movie has stood the test of time.
3080;So enough drooling over the film itself, lets shift focus to the 10th Anniversary Blu.
3081;if this is your first time watching this film I think you will enjoy it.
3082;I recommend this to everybody and I will watch this with my future children and hopefully my Grand children as well.
3083;There are so many nuances and delightfully dark humor.
3084;A work of storytelling art.
3085;This movie is really well done.
3086;I found that I could enjoy it even after reading the book.
3087;I really thought that the first 2 hours of this film were terrific, I loved the humor, acting{Brad Pitt and Ed Norton amaze me},, cinematography, dialogue, and social commentary aspect that it really posseses.
3088;Okay, Brad Pitt did a good job.
3089;And what an ironic, happy ending, watching buildings blow up and holding hands with the one you love.
3090;A comic book movie suitable for twelve year olds.
3091;With the combination of action, dark humor/satire, drama, a bit of adventure, and wicked turns on love and heartbreak, this movie tests the boundaries over critics and other directors.
3092;I love how this film is so deep and has layers that the audience needs to understand.
3093;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton did a fantastic job!
3094;I received the movie in three days and was very pleased it arrived so quickly.
3095;ed Norton is one of the finest actors around today and it's amazing that he didn't receive an academy award nomination for this role.
3096;He acts with his whole body, knowing just when to wince or open his eyes in rounded wonder.
3097;We see his character shift back and forth, experience pain, pleasure and fear as well as all the nuances of emotion that a human being is capable of.
3098;brad Pitt's performance is more one dimensional but he also gives a fine performance.
3099;smoking woman in their lives has a small but significant role.
3100;David Fincher, the director, brilliantly shot the fight sequences shadowed in darkness, but still full of blood and gore.
3101;I couldn't help thinking about it later and I expect I will continue to do so for a long time.
3102;So be prepared for the discomfort as you enjoy some good filmmaking.
3103;I bought all this in the book, because Palahniuk's fevered first.
3104;And when the surprise is sprung, nobody in the audience so much as gasps.
3105;The book is a modern horror story about how populist fascism can flourish here, and about why this is the perfect time for it.
3106;Unbelievable film with lots of violence, twists, and wonderful acting.
3107;Deserved much better box office numbers than it received.
3108;But when a friend recommended it and I saw it, I loved it.
3109;I am very happy with my movie.
3110;the movie begins with the content and theme of a fair.
3111;middling Dilbert comic strip .
3112;suburban white guys whining about how they can no longer assume as a given a life of effortless wealth, privilege, and power.
3113;americans, and the working class.
3114;Tyler's solution is to reclaim their masculinity.
3115;by picking fistfights and blowing stuff up.
3116;granted, the movie is well made, well acted, and visually interesting.
3117;Granted, it makes points .
3118;about the amorality of megacorporations and the inadequacy of consumer capitalism as a substitute for independence, worthwhile work, and fulfillment .
3119;Anyone intelligent enough to contemplate such issues doesn't need them pounded home with a sledgehammer.
3120;and *nobody's* life is fun every minute of every day.
3121;(or something), Fight Club is still very obviously a movie about picking fistfights and blowing stuff up, and not much more.
3122;I sat still through the whole thing, from the opening credits in the cerebral cortex to The Pixie's Where is my mind in the end.
3123;the dialogs are incredible and you will be blown away by how seemingly small and even funny remarks can sum up deeper concepts.
3124;carter hits the perfect tone playing Marla Singer and Edward Norton's performance is worthy of awards and standing ovations.
3125;I was completely immersed in the story and feel the same every time I watch it.
3126;the film's editing is also worthy of attention, because it managed to bring the story together without destroying the director's great work.
3127;A really successful cinematic acheievment.
3128;i highly recommend it
3129;It's very clever, and really makes you think at times.
3130;It's got humor, and suspense, and action, and Brad Pitt, so its all around a great movie.
3131;I love this movie, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are fantastic.
3132;The way the story keeps twisting can really keep you interested.
3133;If someone picks a fight with you, will you run .
3134;Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) offers men a chance to get in touch with their confidence.
3135;Completely free from the Hollywood blockbuster formula, the movie offers laughs, black humor, and some serious questions about masculinity in the modern age.
3136;level character Marla who survives the trip and lives to tell about it.
3137;They took a 'Pulp Fiction' twist and made a root canal more enjoyable.
3138;Pitt has done it again !
3139;Pitt does it best when he plays less than normal people and scruffy looking like he did in 12 Monkeys and Legends Of The Fall.
3140;After the clean and normal Meet Joe Black this flim is a blast.
3141;In fact the violence makes fun of macho male films by Van Damme and John Woo.
3142;She is 6 times nuttier than Mel Gibson's Hamlet !
3143;I bought this for a friend and he loved it!
3144;The packaging is great and the movie is a classic.
3145;All the commentaries you could want, and they're all great.
3146;The actor's commentary is at least as entertaining as the film.
3147;Fight Club does have a great deal of violence, it is true.
3148;If you take that as a given, then you ready yourself to see some very important questions that this film brings into focus.
3149;I believe another part of this film has to do with men.
3150;I believe the philosophy expressed can be one that all can hold whether male or female.
3151;i think the film has a great deal to offer all people.
3152;all of the actors were well cast and should be applauded.
3153;The writers and director should be praised for creating a worthwhile film, one that makes people think, and this, certainly needs to be rewarded!
3154;This is a film that totally and completely shows the need for a post.
3155;Edward Norton and Brad Pit give amazing performances.
3156;Helena Bohnom Carter is truly a gifted actress.
3157;A well written script, good direction, and fine performances from all three leads make this a great movie.
3158;A great movie about men finding out what they are, separated from any trappings of modern civilization.
3159;It goes a lot deeper than you think at first glance.
3160;The extras are good and gives the viewer a little more knowledge of behind the scenes filming and special effects production.
3161;If you like stories with a biting sense of humor with a pinch of violence, this is the movie for you.
3162;I liked everything this film was TRYING to say.
3163;I hold Ed Norton as one of the finer actors of his generation.
3164;Fincher is an able director.
3165;Brad Pitt can make sparks fly in the right hands.
3166;Still, FIGHT CLUB remains a rarity: a thinking person's film.
3167;It is great to hear one cry against our numbing consumerism, and that I champion.
3168;I just wish the film had been a smashing success instead of a beautiful but amputated statue.
3169;Pay close attention to the beginning SPOILER You can actually see visions of Brad Pitt come up when Norton is talking with people within the first half hour
3170;This is a classic movie.
3171;This is easily within my top 5 films of all time.
3172;I love the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.
3173;I'm so glad I got such a great deal.
3174;This is perhaps my favorite movie of 1999.
3175;The characters are cast well, everything is visually spectacular, the soundtrack was brilliant, the plot took me by surprise.
3176;Anyhow, this movie is great and I think the entire violence and anarchist themes the media criticizes are overblown.
3177;this is a good movie and deserves a viewing at the very least.
3178;edward Norton (Narrator), one of the great actors of our generation (X), shows his comfort and unique take on playing Everyman's Bipolar.
3179;Brad Pitt is Nortons perfect foil.
3180;and yet beautiful, nothing spectacular but does her job and advances the plot.
3181;david Fincher (Director) creates a mesmerizing and visually stunning, albeit gory film (The squeamish are warned).
3182;the story is disturbing with a nice twist, which really lets you now that you are not just watching a formula movie.
3183;Yes the film criticizes consumer culture, but by stripping of the packaging and lowering the volume and showing us the underlying mechanism.
3184;This film is one of those types of films where you can watch it every 10 years and catch something you missed the last time you viewed it.
3185;An awesome display of both Camp and Violence wrapped in a script of potent dialogue and stealth Acting.
3186;I am proud to announce I am on viewing number 9 and upon each sitting I consume a new unseen morsel.
3187;Pass the gravey and SLIIIDE!
3188;Captures the pathos of the modern male extremely well.
3189;Two great actors working together.
3190;I was surprised by the ending which usually doesn't happen!
3191;At this point, I feel that these two films must share that honor, as both were ground breaking on multiple levels.
3192;Some people will understand the comedy and enjoy it.
3193;This film is a wild roller coaster ride, and as with the real thing, it will thrill and excite some, while just making others sick.
3194;the level of detail in Fight Club is remarkable.
3195;Ricky recognizes Jack and just has this wonderful smile appear on his face that looks like a combination of surprise, delight, and respect.
3196;This happens in the edge of the frame for a second or less.
3197;First, the depection of a couple of the beatings is pretty graphic, and the makeup work is very realistic.
3198;Also, the sound effects of the punches are superbly realistic.
3199;This is the best movie of all time.
3200;I love this movie, and it was great getting to see it in Blu.
3201;The extra stuff that came along with it was pretty awesome, too.
3202;The movie is good, and it's pretty close to the book.
3203;To explain the profound effect the film has had on me would be Herculean, but I will do my best.
3204;It is a brilliant, blunt, and beautiful re.
3205;examination of all we've come to believe.
3206;The story is captivating, thought.
3207;provoking, and at times humorous.
3208;This movie challenges the viewer to take a good hard look at their own life.
3209;products of a life style obsession.
3210;satisfied life we live today.
3211;in reality, this is one mind numbingly great movie, after letting it sink into my mind and giving it a second viewing, it was just amazing.
3212;That who cares I do what I want personality is portrayed perfectly.
3213;Jack (Edward Norton) is like a slave to his deadening job at the office and has a cynical view of the world.
3214;guy, who is exceptionally convincing and confident and who has everything figured out.
3215;what starts out as suburban white guys whining about how they can no longer assume as a given a life of effortless wealth, privilege, and power turns into something much more elemental.
3216;it gives the feeling of freedom, it gives hope, it gives the sense of deliverance from the weight we carry on our shoulders.
3217;This is a fantastic movie!
3218;They connect to their primal rage in some of the most awesomely graphic bare knuckle fighting you'll see in a movie.
3219;I've been a solid fan of both Norton and Pitt since they made this flick and it sits as kind of a perfect little treasure out of the late nineties.
3220;For those of you who have never seen it, give it a whirl if you can handle some bloody fist fighting.
3221;If you haven't seen it in a few years I recommend you watch it again
3222;if your into gross fight scenes with humor and a story that keeps you at the edge of your seat.
3223;This is the film for you.
3224;But this story about an alienated loser who creates a violent cult of similarly inclined young men who weekly beat each other up and then plot to destroy society's institutions, although perhaps not great, is still pretty good.
3225;But Ed Norton is a fine actor, and he turns in an excellent performance here, and he is certainly one of our best up.
3226;All in all, a pretty good flick with some interesting ideas, some fine acting by Norton, and a dramatic ending, and I'd actually give it 3.5 stars if I could.
3227;My adult son recommended American History X, a movie I would never normally watch, but he reommended it so highly that I watched it and loved it (violent, yes, but such a great story and so well done).
3228;Stop everything you are doing and go see Fight Club, then see it again with pen and paper.
3229;both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give a tour de force performance
3230;You cannot help but to empathize with both characters because they reflect our conscious and subconscious desires.
3231;Their underground, anarchic lifestyle, existing at the edges of society affords them the ultimate freedom to live with impunity.
3232;The direction is sleek, the cinematography is graphic and the sex scenes are downright salacious.
3233;go see this movie, it will change your life.
3234;David Fincher's Fight Club is a very well made movie it pushes the limits in every way and the ending is just out of this world.
3235;Tyler introduces him to what he finds is really important, and it's not the way the narrator's life is.
3236;The humor is also great at some points.
3237;Definetly a rare type of movie.
3238;I loved this Film from start to end and I don't even remember how many times I have watched it !
3239;This Movie rocks man !
3240;Edward Norton is outstanding and no one could have done this Role without him.
3241;He was just amazing !
3242;Helena Bonham Carter gave an Amazing performance too !!!
3243;She was Hot and Cold at the same time and tuely, this is one of her finest performances.
3244;he is Awesome into infinity !
3245;he is truely the Sole of the Film and he keeps on putting more and more Life to the Film every time he comes on Screen.
3246;This is a MusSee and I am telling you, you will enjoy this Film to the Fullest !!!
3247;FIGHT Club is a great great great great movie.
3248;It has fantastic characters, a well written story, a disturbing theme, fantastic ideas, dark humor, and a mind.
3249;Watching this movie a second time, with the knowledge of what the ending is will only make it better.
3250;Tyler Durden played by Pitt is one of the best characters I have ever seen in a movie.
3251;Fight Club tells us why it is so important to live, and what it means to take control of your life and scream to the heavens that you matter.
3252;I don't want to tell you more, but rest assured that the dialogue is crisp, insightful, and wonderfully real.
3253;The story is crystalline, full of metaphor, nuance, and irony.
3254;The cinematography is lush at times
3255;The directing is a wonder.
3256;films rarely are this good
3257;fight Club includes a surprise twist that may make you think of other movies like The Sixth Sense or The Crying Game.
3258;Edward Norton does a beautiful job with the lead role, convincingly embodying both sides of the conflicted young man
3259;carter provides just enough vulnerability to make her sympathetic by the movie's end without compromising her character.
3260;insofar as it focuses on the narrator's eccentric quest for human connection, Fight Club is a brilliant film.
3261;Its rawness, edgy humor, and exciting performances easily compensate for the late failures of the plot.
3262;Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to watch something besides your typical mainstream movie!
3263;Both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are amazing actors.
3264;After seeing this brilliant, definitive.
3265;Instead, I was riveted, amused, and left quite shaken by the experience Fight Club unleashed upon me.
3266;David Fincher is simply the most exciting, risk.
3267;taking director working in mainstream Hollywood, and it really surprises me that a major studio was willing to shell out big bucks on a project this risky.
3268;brad Pitt and Edward Norton make an incredible team here, and it's good to see Helena Bonham Carter playing a characer without an English accent.
3269;the way the movie indicts materialism as a form of security and satisfaction is a statement more true than many figures in Hollywood are willing to accept, no doubt.
3270;Norton's anonymous everyman is easily accessible for comparison with ourselves, and his deadpan narration perfectly encompasses his losing fight with the modern world as his sanity drifts.
3271;the filmmaking technique is dazzling despite its considerable grunge (a Fincher trademark).
3272;A lot of scenes are carried out with incredible innovation and originality in Fight Club (Norton's direct.
3273;all in all, if you allow Fight Club to suck you in, you'll go away from the movie shaken, high, and absolutely exhilarated.
3274;When I saw this movie, one thought came to my mind: Take the best of Pulp Fiction, Natural Born Killers, The Usual Suspects and The Matrix
3275;the great thing about this movie is that it provides you with an incredible insight about the two sides of the human soul: the dark side (never mind Darth Vader) and the good side.
3276;This is a classic for movie lovers, it was awesome some years ago now, and it continues to be so.
3277;Tall guys are good fighters ).
3278;In any event, i was very surprised at the end, and everything made sense.
3279;He is funny and does a great job in his role.
3280;No question this is one of the top 10 movies of all time.
3281;This is far from just a fighting movie it will really make you think and is a must have, if you have the time I strongly recommend the book as well.
3282;probably it would make it to the top 10 movies for a lot of people.
3283;I considered it a master piece.
3284;Watch it twice to see if you pick up on the clues the second time around
3285;well at the time i saw this movie i was in college.
3286;YOu can tell that i liked it.
3287;Trust me you will wided your mind with this one.
3288;it is the psychodelic drug that feeds your breain and it is all perfectly legal.
3289;thanks for reading this far.
3290;David Fincher's best film so far is violent, hilarious, disgusting (verbally and phyisically) and fun.
3291;Soon, this sport has now developed all over the country.
3292;overall, a very good movie.
3293;rated brilliant films I've seen in a long time.
3294;The directing and editing style is top notch that keeps pace with the interesting characters and ever.
3295;Fight Club is a wonderful satire in the age of Men are from Mars.
3296;A great story, snappy dialogue.
3297;plus, Edward Norton continues to demonstrate himself to be one of the greatest actors of his generation.
3298;this movie is a must.
3299;see for anyone who loves movies.
3300;Fight Club has an excellent script.
3301;well written and very exciting.
3302;The actors were well picked as each performance seemed realistic.
3303;I really enjoyed seeing, Fight Club .
3304;exciting and thrilling
3305;It is now one of my favorite movies.
3306;There is so much more to it than violance.
3307;It's about life and bordem, pain and fun.
3308;If you want to think for awhile, this movie is for you.
3309;Oh, yeah, and be prepared to watch it at least twice.
3310;the acting was amazing and the premise horrifying.
3311;One of the best movies of all time!
3312;I love how it keeps you guessing until the very end of what going to happen.
3313;Brad Pitt does a great job and really gets into character.
3314;I love this movie now as much as I did the first time I saw it.
3315;There were a lot of movies in the 90s that were excellent (though relatively few compared to the piles and piles of crud churned out), but Fight Club was the best of them.
3316;no other movie really pulled in all the right elements to deliver a fantastic end product.
3317;In Australia it came and went in a matter of days, and most people never heard it even existed.
3318;there seems only two schools of thought on the movie, people who loved it absolutely, and people who loved it except for the unbelievable twist at the end.
3319;personally, I found the twist to be only a slight stretch, since it was just an exaggerated example of something everybody does, and the story is made more brilliant because of it.
3320;Just kidding, we can talk about it.
3321;But really, this movie's fantastic.
3322;Helena, Brad and Edward are fantastic in this flick.
3323;Even the commentary is worth watching.
3324;This is a great movie.
3325;Easily on my top 5 list.
3326;Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both do an amazing job in this.
3327;I am a big fan of both actors, cult and indy films, and most creative exercises in cinema.
3328;frame shots of him before he actually appears in the film.
3329;Does this impress most viewers?
3330;David Fincher is a master.
3331;After Seven , I didn't think it would be possible for him to create better, but he certainly has done just that!
3332;Just keep reminding yourself how great Seven was.
3333;A bracing, mesmerizing, bitterly funny and deeply unsettling fable about disaffected, emotionally emasculated young men whose search for meaning leads straight to their inner bare.
3334;chi soap he sells to high.
3335;end boutiques, while our office peon's bag is packed with papers.)
3336;But Palahniuk nails the searing alienation and directs it into something simultaneously horrifying and logical (not for nothing is he regularly campared to J. g. Ballard)
3337;He also gives Pitt and Norton the room to deliver what may be the best performances of their careers to date
3338;I loved this movie, I saw it for the first time only recent and I know now why it is a cult classic.
3339;It is now one of my favorite Blu.
3340;I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Chuck Palahniuk's works, whether by book or film.
3341;It's a wonderful film for Brad Pitt lovers as well.
3342;The acting was flawless, I love the camera work, and just everything!!
3343;The Novell, which I read after seeing the movie was just as good, was great to begin with!!!
3344;And the movie just brought everything to life!
3345;I taped it, I bought the video, I bought the book, read it in about three days, and was not the least bit dissapointing.
3346;the movie is a great conversation starter too, because it leaves alot of doors open, but it doesant leave the audience puzzled.
3347;GO see it, what can I say, greatest film ever!!
3348;from the first scene to the end I was hooked, especially after the first plot twist.
3349;If you are not offended by violence and sexual situations this movie is worth a shot, but pay attention to details.
3350;This is one of the great movies of the past decade.
3351;Can't wait to share it with a young friend.
3352;It's important to watch it.
3353;This 10th anniversary release of Fight Club is staggering, and a testament to how a high.
3354;up scenes and background is solid throughout.
3355;it buries the original completely.
3356;You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life.
3357;Tyler Durden is one of the best film characters of all time!
3358;Combination of darkness and humor.
3359;My husband and I have seen this movie before and we love it!!!
3360;He wanted the anniversary edition on blu.
3361;ray so I this was his Christmas present.
3362;This movie has an awesome twist that will knock you out!!!
3363;This was one of the most clever and entertaining films I have seen in my entire life.
3364;It was filled with wonderful performances and interesting twists in the plot.
3365;Because Edward Norton's character is never named, I will call him Ed.
3366;The club becomes very popular, and the men in the group form a sort of cult.
3367;For some weird reason, everyone keeps mistaking Ed for Tyler.
3368;This is one of my favorites, and I reccomend it to anyone who can appreciate a brilliantly made film.
3369;Well written, brilliantly acted, and full of meaning and subtext.
3370;This is easily the greatest film of all time.
3371;One of the reasons for being so great are the great preformances from Ed Norton and Brad Pitt.
3372;And this one of the things that makes the film so clever and witty.
3373;The amazing plot devlopment at the end is just amazing.
3374;This film contains many new style visual effects and the mis en scene that is created by the greatest director around at the moment is just fabolous and makes you feel like you are in the dark place where the narrator is.
3375;This I think is one of those films either you love it or you hate it.
3376;You have to read the film correctly, it is a black comedy thriller.
3377;The comedy is very subtle but also very funny.
3378;The screenplay has been very well adapted from the book exluding of course the ending.
3379;YOu have to see this film, and even if you don't like it you can still appreciate it for it style.
3380;In ten years time this could be the most popular cult film of all time.
3381;There are deleted scenes included and you can actually choose the angle at which you will view some of them.
3382;The case is a cool matte finish and it folds out neatly.
3383;i genuinely enjoyed this movie.
3384;Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are truly remarkable together in this movie and they each seem to be irreplaceable in their respective roles.
3385;This film appeals to the primal part of most people.
3386;The fight club doesn't represent the corruption of the characters, it is their salvation!
3387;The fact is that wherever or whenever you go, a real economy of human relations will have certain basic traits:it will be relatively small (50.200 people),it will have a hierarchy based on ability and needs, it will be efficient and it will be intimate.
3388;Brad Pitt is proving himself to be the James Dean of our generation.
3389;The catalyst that ties the whole movie together is the director, David Fincher (also of SE7EN).
3390;His work ethic of perfection pays of greatly in the end product of this film.
3391;Pardon the pun, but its a knockout of a movie.
3392;Violence in society is at the forefront of today's news.
3393;one day, The Narrator comes up with a plan.
3394;He starts attending support groups for people with various mental and physical afflictions.
3395;This works until he meets the chain.
3396;He moves into Tyler's derelict house.
3397;Soon, the charismatic Tyler commandeers the basement of a seedy bar and transforms it into a fight club, a place where other frustrated males can beat each other senseless.
3398;A few months later, there is a string of clubs across America.
3399;Tyler becomes a hero of mythic proportions to the members, and The narrator is always right by his side.
3400;Regardless of whether of not you agree with Fincher's assessment, the fact remains that this is a brilliant movie.
3401;Norton and Bonham Carter have excelled in everything they have ever done, and Pitt has his best role since Legends of the Fall.
3402;First of all, I'm going to keep this clean.
3403;It is, in my opinion, quite simply, the greatest movie ever made.
3404;Every time I watch it, I like it more.
3405;It shows a life that has hit bottom, that has lost fear, and can accomplish anything.
3406;These are probably the same people who think that 'Starship Troopers' was primarily an action movie, and that Jet Li is the greatest martial artist in the world.
3407;Not only did it have an incredible plot, but the writing was fantastic, too.
3408;There are so many lines that make me shiver when I hear them.
3409;Adored by some people and abhorred by others, Fight Club is a wonderfully complex and compelling film.
3410;Ok, so Pulp Fiction is, but this is right up there.
3411;Pitt and Norton are great.
3412;I've seen this dozens of times and holds up on every viewing.
3413;It's very dark and has great effects and camera movement, as you would expect from Fincher.
3414;Fight Club is a totally unique, underrated movie.
3415;the movie itself is so incredible due to the plotline, which has you moving in one direction and then throws you such a curve that you'll be blown away.
3416;With some dark humor thrown into the mix and plenty of action, I think Fight Club is a real winner.
3417;It also features one of the best fight sequences in movie history.
3418;The movie: I love Fight Club.
3419;It's one of the best American films of the past 20 years.
3420;the performances are all quite good .
3421;Edward Norton before he started believing his own press, Brad Pitt, well, being Brad Pitt very well, and Helena Bonham Carter in the perfectly cast role (if not typecast at this point) are the highlights.
3422;well, my prayers were answered.
3423;This is a DARK movie, and the blackness is well represented, with deep, rock solid blacks.
3424;Shadow detail is great, though, with loads of information present in the shadowy near.
3425;The making of and retrospective features are a mix of old and new.
3426;in summary:This disc is a worthy upgrade.
3427;This one is superior in just about every conceivable way.
3428;It is unquestionably superior and should be the disc anyone serious about this movie owns.
3429;This is an excellent movie, no doubt about it.
3430;I love it even more now that it's on BD.
3431;The dialogue is so clear, the impact of punches, kicks and explosions is so real, you really feel like you're listening to the action live.
3432;the menus are also very clever.
3433;Get this movie and enjoy it again and again.
3434;Fight Club is a wonderful movie when you see it the first time.
3435;Tyler Durden is by far my favorite when it comes to movie characters
3436;products of a lifestyle obsession.
3437;The movie takes you on a wonderful roller coaster of feelings and emotions, towards both Narrator and Tyler Durden.
3438;i believe this is one of Brad Pitt's best roles ever and I think a lot of people, when they think of Brad Pitt they also think Tyler Durden.
3439;Fight Club is one of the best films ever made.
3440;It has everything a film needs, and I highly recommend it.
3441;ALways a good story, still very compelling story.
3442;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton show why they are two of our best actors today
3443;its just great and the cover would be anythin to catch anyones eye.
3444;Now the movie has to be the best movie ever made, its just hilariously funny and smart.
3445;If your into dark comedies this has to be the one for you.
3446;It has such a great plot and such memorable lines that just crack you up laughing.
3447;She received her gift and she was happy.
3448;This movie is so good, it's still being hotly talked about and analyzed 5 years after it's release.
3449;How do you fight the decaying morality of modern civilization
3450;And the narrator and Tyler face each other again, like in the beginning.
3451;one of the greatest endings ever.
3452;Once in a while a film comes out which is timeless.
3453;Conformists and prudish sorts will dislike this film.
3454;If that's you, get Eagle Eye or something and enjoy a bunch of nice safe hollywood violence :)
3455;This Movie was a suprise, and it is one of the best movies i saw in a long long time.
3456;well worth your time to see this one.
3457;stylized, complicated movie that deals with the issue of existentialism through the eyes of a nameless character deemed Narrator (Ed Norton).
3458;On first watch, the film is very confusing, but once you watch it a second time or at least ponder it within your mind for an extended period of time you begin to piece things together in the very complicated plot.
3459;Mainly, though, it is a movie about self discovery and strength.
3460;inspiring Kubrick masterpiece '2001: A Space Odyssey'.
3461;There are actually some surprising similarities between these two standout films .
3462;both are a visual and psychological journey that will leave the viewer amazed and disturbed.
3463;Their work, a blend of techno and atmospheric ambience, feeds perfectly to the chaos and brooding terror of 'Fight Club'.
3464;I should also mention that Tom Waits also appears, as well as the best and siglemost inspirational band of all time .
3465;not only are the special affects outstanding and the dialogue so complex that you need to watch the movie multiple times to catch all the subtleties, but the plot line itself has lays upon layers of meaning!
3466;If you want a love story, you've got one, if a strange and fairly disturbing version
3467;And may I state a second time that the special effects are beyond reproach, which is a very high compliment coming from me.
3468;the movie is so amazing for the multitudes of messages that it portrays, messages that I believe every single person on this planet needs to be hearing right now!
3469;i would recommend this movie to anybody, whether they enjoy violence or not.
3470;but this is truly a good movie.
3471;But Fight Club is absolutely brilliant, with a unique plot, fantastic characters, and a perfect mixture of depressing, horrifying, and hilarious moments.
3472;This is a truly unconventional movie that deserves many accolades, and it's a lot of fun to watch.
3473;Which is how I ended up viewing this movie.
3474;If you're into psychology at all or beautifully unpredictable movies, you'll love this one.
3475;Fight Club is my favorite movie.
3476;For years my favorite movie was Terry Gilliam's Brazil, but Fight Club has managed to remove it from the mantle and take it's place as what I consider to be the finest film ever made.
3477;for a proper viewing of this film.
3478;Go to the bathroom, unplug the phone, and be settled to watch a great movie 3) turn off the lights, you'll like the movie a lot better in darkness.
3479;wait two weeks and watch it again.
3480;They had an impressive movie theater, so I thought I'd unwind from my 10 hour interview by taking a film in.
3481;I had just enjoyed one of the most incredible theatrical experiences I had been through in a very long time.
3482;As soon as I go back to San Diego I took three friends to see the movie.
3483;I was so excited for them to see it and to hear their reaction.
3484;Finally all three broke the silence and thanked me for taking them to one of the best movies they've ever seen.
3485;I saw that movie 4 times in the theater, because I wanted all of my friends to see it.
3486;but all were happy they saw it.
3487;Either way, you should see it.
3488;finally, you can make a great Trilogy if you watch three movies in this order.
3489;tough, gripping, and cynical, Fight Club asks us to step aside and take a look at our own consumer culture and ask ourselves if we like what we see: That is the real message at the heart of the movie, and it is conveyed through the nihilistic icon Tyler Durden.
3490;even if you'd rather overlook the deep philosophical subtexts within the film, Fight Club is an enjoyable, fast.
3491;help groups' adds on newspapers gives clues about aspects of urban life and social interactions in highly industrialised societies.
3492;Obviously, this scene is a good example of commodity fetishism.
3493;Individuals' cars, furniture, houses, wealth and even type of credit cards are the chief indicators of their prestige and status.
3494;The terms such as urban alienation and commodity fetishism are clearly displayed in some specific scenes of the movie.
3495;This is a brilliantly conceived, written and acted examination of the age.
3496;This movie is a lot more than a series of punch.
3497;I believe it will make you think, and that's a good thing!
3498;I personally have never watched this, but my brother loves the movie.
3499;David Fincher is a funny guy.
3500;cue plot twist and jump back to the first scene of the film.
3501;laced with irony, wit, and sharp dialogue this is David Fincher's Pulp Fiction.
3502;it is a must see film.
3503;Interesting tale of what happens when white collar worker get bored.
3504;With nothing better to do, two guys have a fight and it draws a crowd.
3505;This movie is definately the best of the bunch.
3506;awesome, in your face, bloody, brutal, brillant, sometimes over the top, bashing, gory, nasty, comical, disturbing.
3507;David Fincher's second best film next to Se7en.
3508;and theres a lot of sex and moaning in this one as well and some big juggs on Meat Loaf.
3509;This has to be one of the best movies ever made!
3510;The naration given by Edward Norton is powerful and haunting, and it makes the suspense and terror seem that more realistic.
3511;The ending is one of the best I have ever seen in a movie since Usual Suspects.
3512;This is a powerful movie which will make you believe that chaos can end all existence.
3513;It is gruesome and violent at times, but it's worth it!
3514;It really should be 100 stars, or even more!
3515;Fight Club is without a dobt one of the best movies ever made!
3516;Maybe it is a generational thing but I really disliked this movie.
3517;Fight Club is an astonishing movie, the cinematography is brilliant, the acting is teriffic, the story is delightfully bizzare, incredibly funny, and incredibly clever.
3518;You see this film has an ending that like Sixth Sense, will most likely be an incredible suprise.
3519;This is one of those movies that you just HAVE to see in letterbox format, and that fact that it comes that way standard is fantastic!
3520;It is, in my opinion, the best home translation of a film I've seen to date.
3521;The story boards, the deleted scenes, the special effects footage. . . it's all great.
3522;fight club is the best adaptation of a novel made into a motion picture that i have ever seen / read.
3523;the novel, by chuck palahniuk is an intense, terrific, well written mind bomb of a story and should be read by anyone who liked this movie.
3524;blah blah blah as if my review in this sea of reviews will persuade you.
3525;Not only was the acting superb, but the whole story was so slick and original.
3526;Also check out David Finchers other movies (Seven, The Game, and the new one, Panic Room) great movies.
3527;ray, I was so happy to finally see it appear for pre.
3528;I said to myself, Oh great some kind of macho action movie where Brad Pitt runs around topless to attract women and beats up Edward Norton to attract the guys.
3529;It's a wild ride with meaning and fun.
3530;It will make laugh, squirm, and think.
3531;The movie is amazing from beginning to end.
3532;It's funny in a twisted kind of way, acting is great, and the story moves along perfectly.
3533;Beautifully photographed and exquisitely directed, David Fincher's Fight Club is a full.
3534;The chance meeting between these individuals will forever change his life as he is propelled into a grimy world of support groups and bare knuckle fights.
3535;Bonham Carter is devilishly good as the snooty Marla and Pitt is a fireball as the macho Tyler Durden.
3536;But again, it is Ed Norton who propels the film along.
3537;The rich plotline and the subtle symbolism place YOU in the movie.
3538;The score to the movie, all pieces by the Dust Brothers, is excellent as well.
3539;I highly recommend that you see this movie.
3540;it got to me in about 2 weeks.
3541;great movie of its time.
3542;This has to be one of my favorite book adaptations in the world.
3543;This film is most definately on my top 5.
3544;Taken from the book of the same name, this is perhaps slightly better than it and is full of brilliant lines and great peformances.
3545;The commentaries are the best, with not just Director's Commentary, but stars and also the writer and screenplay writer's views.
3546;You pull out the inside sleeve to find a lot of amazing artwork and a booklet with various interviews in it.
3547;It's all great and the menus are displayed wonderfully.
3548;It combines a unique blend of comedy, action, drama, and even a great mid.
3549;movie plot twist to form, in my opinion, the greatest movie of all time!
3550;Norton's character is especially cool .
3551;GO SEE THIS MOVIE, and take your friends and family with you!
3552;The acting, concept, and just theoverall appearance of the film is done to perfection.
3553;It was shot and edited really well.
3554;I thought the humor was great.
3555;And the acting of Edward Norton was outstanding.
3556;It goes so much beyond that.
3557;And I think that's what makes this movie so cool.
3558;Anyways, Fight Club is one of the best movies I have ever seen and everyone needs to see it!
3559;This is my favorite all time movie.
3560;There is a gun pointed straight into our mouths and for a second, we see nothing but.
3561;He lives in a very respectable apartment with some very respectable clothes and furniture with a very respectable job.
3562;I am Jack's life, and I'm ending one minute at a time.
3563;Jack starts attending as many of these sessions as possible in an attempt to feel the world around him.
3564;Next to us, a man spouts his incredibly cynical, yet subtly brilliant views on the world.
3565;tyler and Jack have an interesting conversation for the rest of the flight, and Jack leaves and arrives home to find his apartment in flames.
3566;outside the bar, Tyler discusses things that Jack can do to help himself, including offering Jack shelter at his home.
3567;I am Jack's thoughts:Fight Club is one of those rare films that was recommended to me by some friends of mine, who told me how cool and mind.
3568;This film is sheer brilliance, and it sends a very strong and clear message to everybody: One needs to accept their life as it is and do what they can to make it better for themselves and others around them.
3569;The film is great also, but I am so happy with the total package and all it includes.
3570;its the perfect backdrop for a story about young guys so fed up with the ennui of these times, their only relief comes from knocking one another senseless.
3571;And the Beat Goes On with fight clubs forming all over America.You would think Pitt would be the lead here, but its Ed Norton handling the narrative, the voice.
3572;So much for the love interest.
3573;the movie is a guy thing you see.
3574;I can barely remember what the climactic scene at the end is about.
3575;It has an enormous effect on me.
3576;david Fincher is a great visual stylist, infatuated with his director's palette.
3577;He uses every trick in the book here, and consistently stops just short of going over the line of good taste.
3578;And to me, that's what makes this movie so special.
3579;hour plus movie chock full of special effects and visual magic, that's an astounding feat.
3580;The scene where he fights himself in his boss' office is both funny and frightening.
3581;And Brad Pitt is just perfect here.
3582;The character needed to be charismatic, rebellious, intense, funny, very physical and especially very beautiful.
3583;These two actors work extremely well together.
3584;witty, spacey, and crackling with life while doing a dance of death .
3585;and you get an excellent triumvirate of lead actors.
3586;There are just so many good things to talk about.
3587;this is the most overated movie of 99
3588;Fight Club is one of the best novel to movie translations i have ever seen.
3589;The plot moves at a nice pace, the actors nail their respective characters, and Fincher's directing sets the mood for the film perfectly.
3590;But I really enjoyed this movie.
3591;so much sothat I bought it for my best friend from college.
3592;Ithink its one of the most creative, symbolicallyloaded mixture of male angst and social commentaryI've ever seen.
3593;It's funny, scary, witty, creative, dark,and utterly thought.
3594;This BR comming with a nice cover.
3595;but, this movie is one of my favorites, so i enjoy it so much :D
3596;Fight Club is the kind of film that you will watch and then see it again.
3597;It has so many hidden layers of social criticism that I was just impressed and fascinated with what the director intended to convey in this (beautifully shot) work of art.
3598;The direction is perfect, the acting is flawless (even Meat Loaf and Jared Leto put on some wonderful performances), the storyline is twisted, intelligent, and carried out at the right pace.
3599;Another one is its call for intelligent anarchy, one which seeks to awaken the modern man from the robotic position that social norms have designed and assigened to him.
3600;Its depiction of violence as an art and a release from modern stagnation makes this movie, without a doubt, one of the best flicks of the past decade (and, certainly, of all time).
3601;The original and artsy packaging is just one reason.
3602;fight Club is a dark and nihilistic saga about the life of average men, at the brink of a new century.
3603;Pitt is very convincing as the relentless Tyler
3604;I have read the book as well so I enjoy watching it on film too.
3605;The actors and directing is great!
3606;Seen this movie countless times.
3607;He was happy to receive it!
3608;This is one of my favorite movies.
3609;And the story is even better.
3610;but it still kicks ass.
3611;The two soon become friends and develop the concept of underground fight clubs.
3612;fight Club is one of the best films ever made in my opinion, and if I had make a list consisting of my five favorite films, Fight Club would definately be on it.
3613;The film provides an interesting premise taken from the novel of the same name written by Chuck Palanhiuk, as well as constant laughs, hard hitting action, and incredible performances from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt.
3614;Both Norton and Pitt have great on screen chemistry together and appear as if they could be friends in real life.
3615;The fight scenes in this movie are extremely well choreographed and come off looking very realistic.
3616;They offer a savage and raw style of fighting that makes most fight scenes you will see pale in comparison.
3617;Perhaps my favorite aspect of Fight Club, is the story behind the film taken from Chuck Palanhiuk's novel.
3618;The issues of the story take an honest and humorous look at consumerism and the way that society is obsessed with defining themselves based on what they own.
3619;overall, the acting, interesting and humorous premise, and fantastic fight scenes all come together to create a fantastic film.
3620;An amazing mind bending movie.
3621;it's a great movie and one of the Marvels.
3622;This movie is entertaining and makes you think.
3623;Quite a twist toward the end!
3624;Still includes extras/commentaries that many Blu.
3625;it's a good laugh the first time, but in 10 years I won't know what it means.
3626;Not only is it a great movie, the special features are awesome, director cast commentary insightful (although Helena Bonnham Carter's was obviously recorded elsewhere and edited in), there are cool special features on the second disc such as deleted scenes and alternate scenes.
3627;it also occupies my mind frequently, because there is such a strong message in that film, with so many intelligent and accurate things to say that it has kept my mind working for months.
3628;not for the outstanding and innovative direction, the perfect performances or the witty and clever screenplay.
3629;this film is darkly funny, with wonderful characters, and i have never watched a filmn which made me feel so pumped up wih adrenaline.
3630;i also think that this is one of the most important movies to have been made for a long time.
3631;that the constant emphasis on appearances, consumerism, and our celebrity, spectator culture has made us all forget how it actually FEELS to be alive, to experience soimething real and be a part of something, ourselves.
3632;the fighting isn't about violence, it is about feeling something primal.
3633;this is something i think about all the time and i want everybody to see this film so that it at least gives them food for thought.
3634;this is the most amazing film i have ever seen.
3635;This movie is truly one of a kind.
3636;This film is great in several ways.
3637;The cinematography was exceptional, the cunning allusions to real events were amusing, and the originality and intelligence of letting a character giving a voice.
3638;This movie is truly and completely absolutely eccentric.
3639;i loved it my wife hated it.
3640;something is up with that we usually have similar taste in movies.
3641;also bob has man boobs.
3642;i was told Fight Club was a very good film, but I had been told lots of films were very good.
3643;This film was very good and then some.
3644;The adapted screenplay was perfect, the direction was stunning and the acting was brilliant, unfortunately it was rudely underrated.
3645;Well Even though they say that, I still watched it and rather enjoyed it.
3646;Other rules to viewing and appreciating and enjoying Fight Club:There are NO rules to it!
3647;This movie should bombard you with images, sounds, ideas .
3648;and many of them will probably be UNACCEPTABLE to you.
3649;This movie gets in your face and under your skin.
3650;This story twist was all I really enjoyed in the movie.
3651;First of all the promotion package of the movie was one of the greatest I've ever seen (unfortunately these things only reach the US or at least they don't reach Greece), such an inspired catalogue, kind of reminded me of [.]
3652;The rest of the bonus material was good as well, but what was really worth it, was watching the film for the second time.
3653;Plus, I forgot about the blood and fighting and paid more attention to the excellent humor the movie has.
3654;The more you see it, the more you discover.
3655;A fascinating, stylish and incredibly brave film that has touched a nerve amongst a generation brought up to work in useless jobs for 12 hours a day, this film is great if, like me, you've ever wanted to just smash something, anything, into a million pieces and laugh at the mess.
3656;it's a dark comedy of contemporary society, filmed in a dazzling, incredible style, and acted with panache by a series of people who portray ennui compellingly.
3657;Edward Norton is fantastic .
3658;weary, especially in the few moments of office.
3659;the music is great, too .
3660;Neizche elements
3661;Okay, so there's fighting but there's definitely a lot more to it.
3662;Both men manage to fight out their pent.
3663;up aggression and Norton almost manages to forget about the enigmatic Marla.
3664;the movie poses several important questions about the nature of society and the nature of the self, comparing the rules and order of society with the rules and order of the self.
3665;Certainly on this level it should be applauded as being in a recent rush of intelligent Hollywood movies, and this is definitely one of the best of the lot.
3666;With regards to acting it's a real gem, with Norton proving once more that he is capable of just about anything a director can throw at him.
3667;As Tyler, Pitt adds to all those annoyingly unnoticed superb performances that he's notched up and Helena Bonham Carter plays against type marvellously.
3668;it's also beautifully shot, demonstrating the characters' lust for violence well.
3669;provoking and at times absolutely hilarious viewing.
3670;This coupled with an overwhelming desire to see it again, and you have a serious state of confusion.
3671;As a regular viewer, I find this to be a truly unique film.
3672;satisfaction and rise of cults.
3673;If you have and IQ in the low 60s you may want to go out and get in to a fight, and it is to you that most movie critics felt a responsibility when panning the film, to the rest of you see this film, and then see it again.
3674;It is so rich that you can't possibly catch all of it in one viewing, so many ideas tossed around that you can debate, if that is your thing.
3675;On the other hand this u. turn provides it with yet another sub.
3676;That makes , that rarest gem in movies.
3677;Brilliantly acted, an incredible plot, you can almost feel the characters pain.
3678;The originality of this movie itself baffles the mind.
3679;If you watch it once and then watch it again you can truly appreciate the twist ending and the originality of the cinematography.
3680;While the performances in the film are first rate, it is the direction of David Fincher that elevates the gritty and moody scenery to a supporting cast member.
3681;If you've ever wondered what your life would be like if you simply did whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted to do so
3682;This is an excellent Blu.
3683;ray title and excellent movie in general.
3684;Many times when an older (only 1999) movie comes out on BD you can't really get much benefit from the higher resolution but they did a great job with this one.
3685;It really adds another layer of depth to the characters and makes you appreciate David Fincher for his attention to detail.
3686;This is a great movie based off of an equally great novel.
3687;The movie's cast put on great preformances about the unmasculization (if thats a word) of modern men.
3688;It is only when you give up everything are you able to do anything.
3689;Brilliant words that directly address everything our society today deals with.
3690;With the media and advertisements revolving around us every single day, this movie presents the possibility of want versus need.
3691;What is truly necessary in life, and to get rid of what isn't.
3692;It is a great movie, but can be dangerous for any socialites out there, it might make them think critically about their lives.
3693;this is the closest thing you will get to having a truely good movie today.
3694;Fight Club has to be recognized as possibly the best psychological thriller of all time.
3695;David Fincher has a history of great films, but nothing of this caliber.
3696;ride rollercoaster intro, throught to the explosive final sequence, this delievers on every level an then some!
3697;Pitt and Norton are both on top form as is Bonham Carter.
3698;The film's twist at the end beats the hell out of The Sixth Sense's!
3699;I was a bit of a David Fincher fan after The Game and Seven and I really like Edward Norton, who in my opinion is the finest actor of his generation, but I still thought who really wants to see a movie about people knocking lumps out of each other for 133 minutes?
3700;And it's not just a guy movie either, I watched this with my wife and she loved this movie as much as I did and at the end she turned to me and said one word wow!
3701;This is an incredibly powerful movie that pulls one surprise after another.
3702;It has an incredibly original script, excellent direction and wonderful acting.
3703;award winning performance) and Meat Loaf.
3704;Yeah, Meat Loaf in good film, understated, funny, good acting shock!!!
3705;That's how good it is!
3706;Does it have a deep and meaningful message?
3707;It was completely unlike anything we'd ever seen before, and completely, well, awesome.
3708;Acting, writing, directing (I *heart* you, David Fincher) .
3709;plus viewing, it's still AMAZING.
3710;And, of course, the moment of revelation is unforgettable.
3711;this movie is the best ive ever seen.
3712;norton is off the hook, and pitt is great, as usual.
3713;Fight Club is certainly not a monumental film, but it struck a chord about the modern condition.
3714;The comedy is of the blackest variety and you will have to suspend any squeamish.
3715;But all the roles are skillfully played, especially by Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden, and underlying the banality of blood and mayhem is a message.
3716;life can be what you make it.
3717;just be carefully you do so thoughtful with positive human regard and a degree of clarity.
3718;The movie has some real Momento moments, so I won't try to delve into the story.
3719;Their chemistry and interplay is terrifically authentic and dead.
3720;confident hipster that makes soap.
3721;This movie is worth a pass.
3722;Watching the film, Fight Club you are taken into the dark underworld of fighting for respect and honor.
3723;Overall, the movie is pretty good.
3724;The acting by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt is great (not to mention Brad Pitt's physique), and the movie really pulls you in to lives of the characters.
3725;For the ending alone, watch this movie!
3726;This one is always hard to watch because there is so much bloody violence but it has a good twist to it.
3727;Both actors are good in their roles.
3728;These two together is quite a duo.
3729;Love the movie and the concept.
3730;It is twisted and unpredictable.
3731;The flashes of things on the screen is interesting also.
3732;As always, both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt pulled great performances, but I question why they chose to do the film as its lasting value is very slight.
3733;I think that Fight Club is one of the best movies of the last 10 years.
3734;This movie is a good movie because the story line was very well written.
3735;It kept me on the edge of my seat, and at the times when it was supposed to, it gave me chills.
3736;On top of the great story line, the actors made the movie connect well with me.
3737;It gives you sympathy for people with multiple personalities disorder.
3738;great movie and even better as a gift.
3739;played well and was brand new.
3740;great if you are into blu rays
3741;On the contrary: Fight Club has the most original and engaging script of 1999 (except for maybe Being John Malkovich).
3742;This is one of the greatest movies of all time.
3743;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton do a great job.
3744;I easily think its the best movie i've ever seen!
3745;it's still worth the a watch, and this Blu.
3746;ray edition is the version to see.
3747;one of Pitts and Nortan's best performance, although admittedly I am not a film critic who will over analyze everything.
3748;Makes a great addition to your Blu.
3749;It's just a sexy concept that these men who seem to have lost so much can latch onto.
3750;this film is also deliciously incisive with its dark humor.
3751;Fincher's direction is superb in every aspect, from his limited use of CGI to the minute details, and I mean MINUTE (subliminal Tyler, anyone?)
3752;Jim Uhl's adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's killer 1996 novel is both faithful and filled with new scenes that you swear you read in the book.
3753;The editing is seamless, and again, the special effects never overthrow the story yet add a new dimension to many parts of the film.
3754;As for the music, the Dust Brothers create the most original soundtrack of the decade, refusing to play the game safely and instead making a sonic companion to the film's feel, which takes more talent than most would think.
3755;overs provide some of the biggest laughs in recent memory, but in his actual live.
3756;Instead it delivers a comedic and intelligent critique of both consumer culture AND its extremist alternatives.
3757;than its nay sayers care to give it credit for.
3758;Fast delivery, movie was in excellent condition.
3759;Overall very satisfied with my transaction.
3760;The title pretty much sums it up.
3761;I won't waste time with the storyline, you can read about it in the Amazon review, but what I will say is that director David Fincher has come quite a long way since his directorial debut helming the dreadful Alien 3, the way he seamlessly infuses CGI with the film is amazing.
3762;Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter give knockout performances.
3763;Norton's narration throughout the entire movie is unexpectedly hilarious at some parts and chilling at others.
3764;While yes, the film is quite brutal, but it is nowhere as violent as perceived to be, and I love the package design (the fact that negative reviews of the film are featured in the booklet is genius), and the commentaries and deleted scenes are worth owning the movie alone.
3765;I felt really strange but in a good way.
3766;Repeated viewings of the movie are still really interesting from what new things you pick up.
3767;It really helped to make edward norton one of my favorite actors.
3768;From start to finish, it's really a guessing game of what will happen next.
3769;This movie is definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but it is arguably one of the smartest, savviest satires of its kind.
3770;edward Norton proves himself, yet again, as one of the finest talents of his generation and Brad Pitt keeps up with him every step of the way.
3771;all while satisfying the studio's expected beefcake quota.
3772;Helena Bonham Carter, upon multiple screenings, displays incredible restraint in a seemingly over.
3773;not a film to be taken at face value, definitely worth studying.
3774;Fight club is a psychological thriller with twists and turns a plenty.
3775;Fight club is filled with dark humor, it is a cult classic and of course it is an anarchical view of our society.
3776;Fight club is a great film, and I must recommend to any and all who are willing to watchStaring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, it is about a man's internal struggle that he pushes to his real world.
3777;His struggles with his self confidence, insomnia, and an addiction to self help groups slowly destroys what life he has (Norton).
3778;All is well, or as well as it could be until an eccentric woman played by Helena Bonham Carter, gets in the way.
3779;Fight club is a cult classic, it is the cream of the crop when it comes to movies.
3780;conformist tone and unique political stances is what makes fight club a cult film.
3781;this is most assuredly not a film one would want the kids to see, Fight Club is a film respected and recommended by many a critic.
3782;With its dark humor, ultra.
3783;I'm not into violent movies, but with this one the end justifies the means.
3784;it's brutal, it's bloody and it's very good.
3785;brad and Eddie give sterling performances in this action flick and I won't give the game away.
3786;[lol]There's a brilliant twist in events, see if you can spot it before it happens [I didn't]
3787;This movie was probably the most intriguing film I have seen since Sixth Sense.
3788;David Fincher has impressed me for the third time,( Se7en and The Game)proving his place in making movies with a twist.
3789;Chuck Palahniuk's novel captures the growing discontent with consumer.
3790;Fincher's adaption is excellent, as are the performances of Norton, and Pitt.
3791;One major theme being the nihlism of modern society .
3792;In most movies, to a certian extent, you have to put realty on hold and enjoy it for what it is.
3793;part of you can't help but think, WOW, this is so true.
3794;Ultimatley, he comes to realize that everything in life you own, in return ends up owning you.
3795;Fight Club is an amazing film based on fantasy turned reality.
3796;Somewhere, inside all of us, we have the same feeling and intuitions that Ed Norton experiences in this excellent movie.
3797;Although dark and graphic at times, you will find that this movie is one that will soon become a classic.

3799;It is important to look past the brutality and appreciate that the movie is focused on giving dissatisfied men a reason to feel alive.
3800;The film does differ in some ways to the novel, but it is a unique viewing experience with an at times humorous and surprising narrative.
3801;This film easily keeps up to par with such movies as The Matrix or The Usual Suspects.
3802;Once you fully understand the movie, you will question some of the most basic things you do in daily life.

3816;a great modern film from the director of the astonishing Se7en, Fight Club is a love or hate film.
3817;see at least once for everyone, as it is filled with action, dark humor, and suspense.
3818;Great acting from both Norton and Pitt, as well as several supporting actors.
3819;you'll experience from watching this flick.
3820;When I walked out I had a broad smile and a lot of hope for the future of film making.
3821;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton Sink into their roles and relentlessly deliver their characters into reality.
3822;My hats off to a brave and (most importantly) hillarious film.
3823;Jack is like a slave to his deadening job at the office and has a cynical view of the world.
3824;guy, who is exceptionally convincing and confident and who has everything figured out.
3825;at this point the movie starts to change into a psychological thriller, which makes it so good.
3826;The twist at the end is unexpected and is a very strong scene.
3827;I guess that, and the superb acting of Norton and Pitt, is what makes people want to see it again and again.
3828;By feeling pain and being able to hold no grudges against the inflictor of this pain, one is able to dry the tears of self.
3829;Industries revolve around fantasy worlds created in our minds to escape reality.
3830;Just like many cult movies of last 3 decades, this has unusual dialogues, situations, and yes, acting.
3831;When the movie is over, you still keep thinking about it.
3832;The book is much better.
3833;as usual, Brad Pitt gives an exceptional performance as Edward Norton's make believe other half.
3834;This is an excellent movie and book.
3835;Very entertaining and although the ending was a little disappointing to me (shooting one's head up the side works wonders), I still fully recommend it.
3836;totally cool story about the mind being screwed up and conjuring images.
3837;I've seen it a few more times since, and each time it gets better and better.
3838;There is a lot that a first.
3839;time viewer wouldn't pick up on and it's great to go back and pick those things out.
3840;and MEATLOAF) is fantastic, as is the direction and the effects.
3841;the message of the movie has stayed with me ever since I first watched it .
3842;it is a fantastic commentary on our consumerism.
3843;driven culture as well as our lack of originality as a whole and our fear of deviating from the path of least resistance.
3844;i want to laugh at someone who deserves it, and question the status quo, and.
3845;Watch it, live it, love it.
3846;It makes you want to fight, it makes you want to overthrow the government.
3847;This is without a doubt the best movie of all time, it shows the natural human emotions and physical desires for the rush of adrenaline I absolutly loved it
3848;A classic featuring Pitt and Norton.
3849;both then in their early roles, and both exhibiting peak performance.
3850;coming twist, thanks to the way it was directed.
3851;What does is that with all its good points, there's still something missing that you can't quite put your finger on.
3852;It's throughout the whole film, and you just can't define it.
3853;great actors good story great plot one of my favorites movies i recomend this movie if you havent seen it
3854;It was a complex movie.
3855;For those who want a wonderfully weird, HILARIOUSLY funny, bizarre, smart movie that disturbs you repeatedly but leaves you cheering in the end, I STRONGLY recommend Fight Club!
3856;It was a wonderfully complex vision of the inside of aman's mind.
3857;one of my personal favorite touches in this movie is Tylers brief appearences in the movie in the ealy scenes.
3858;Tyler has many jobs in this movie, and among them a film projector runner.
3859;normally I hate Brad Pitt, but his performance as Tyler is perfect.
3860;It is a daring and fun ride through the the human mind.
3861;It is a psychological and daring thriller that says a LOT about our society and doesn't blind us from the truth.
3862;It is also one of those movies that puts you in it's world and doesn't let you out until the ending credits.
3863;Probably the most extensive special edition I have seen!
3864;Fight Club has been described by detractors as overly slick and heavily macho, but its fans find it clever and visually stunning, with moments of real brilliance.
3865;I think the fans have got it right: there are some moments of brilliance, and if you can deal with the explicit violence the movie is beautiful to watch.
3866;In an effort to feel connected to something.
3867;It is with Tyler that Norton's character finds a new, seemingly meaningful way to feel connected: the two men fight.
3868;It makes them feel up, it makes them feel real.
3869;And who, exactly, IS Tyler Durden?The decaying interiors and dark exterior shots that abound in Fight Club are wonderfully filmed in a manner slightly reminiscent of Blade Runner, and the truly fine acting by Norton and Pitt sends out sparks.
3870;Pitt is dark and charismatic, and yes, he looks great, even in Tyler's hideous bathrobe and other unappealing garments.
3871;this film is not for the weak of stomach, and the conclusion may be disturbing for those who were in New York for 9/11, but it's a genuinely interesting creation.
3872;It may not be as deep and thought provoking as its most avid fans proclaim, but it is a fine piece of work, definitely worth at least one viewing.
3873;Fight Club is an absolute masterpiece of American cinema.
3874;Think of the storyline, and you'd understand that's done for a very good reason.
3875;This is without a doubt one of the most memorable movies I have seen.
3876;This movie is simply honest about violence.
3877;Fight Club has found its way into my top three favorite movies of all time and it will likely stay there for many years.
3878;One of my favorite books and movies!
3879;First impressions count, they last, and I think they explain the overwhelmingly positive reactions of the Amazon readership to this film.
3880;The first hour of Fight Club is truly, exquisitely, brilliant: patiently (if acidly) observed, witty and deadpan, and the punches it lands .
3881;are of the purely figurative kind.
3882;But it was so good, so clever, and so funny that I really didn't mind whether I did or not.
3883;so, on the strength of that, sans doubte, five stars: Norton is beautifully understated as the nameless narrator, Helena Bonham.
3884;kitten side of herself that previously I could only fantasise existed, and Brad Pitt, always arch and aware, is as charismatic and magnetic as anyone I've seen on screen.
3885;Because he's so cool you tend to overlook the fact that he's an extraordinary actor as well.
3886;the game could have gone any one of a number of ways
3887;Problem here is that the twist completely undoes all the good work done in the first hour of the film.
3888;A picture that was making some clever points in a pretty palatable way all of a sudden just doesn't any more.
3889;And all of a sudden there are lots of guns and lots of punching.
3890;and I'm not sure the twist even works (I'd have to watch it again, and to be honest I can't be bothered): the point of a twist is to give you a set of facts and imply that they should be interpreted in a certain way, and then to reveal the critical piece of information which reveals that everything must actually be viewed another way.
3891;this was all immensely disappointing, because this could have been a great film .
3892;I still think the first 60 minutes is a great film, but I guess if they had stopped there then, on account of the lack of fighting, they couldn't have called it Fight Club.
3893;This movie is by far one of the best movies you will ever see.You have to have an open mind, and if you like movies with a twist, this movie is for you.
3894;and definetly after you watch it over again you begin to see things that make more sense.
3895;brad Pitt and Edward Norton definetly work well together on this movie.
3896;there is also some comedy in this movie and quotes that you will be sayin over and over.
3897;again, this is one of the best movies i have ever seen,hands down.
3898;pretty boys without shirts for the girls to enjoy, and explosions and anarchy for the boys.
3899;Now, if you enjoy suspense, this movie has a good deal in it.
3900;this film is not gonna be enjoyed by everyone, this isn't a film you watch with the family, it is a good psychological drama more than an action film, highly recommended.
3901;The best part of this film is the whole anti.
3902;i'm a huge fan of psychological thrillers (Memento is very similar to this) and Norton is one of my favorite actors.
3903;These things combined solidified its spot in my top five movies.
3904;if you love it you'll rewatch it several times to catch everything you missed and be more deeply engrossed in the realityof this world.
3905;But I'll bet you'll at least be recommending it to friends.
3906;as for the author of the book of which this is based on, Palahniuk is amazing.
3907;I've never been one to reread a book but his are worth it.
3908;He's gritty, raw at times, and outside of the box.
3909;I think that it is really good but I don't think that it is as incredible as other people say.
3910;i think that the story is interesting and demands more than one viewing.
3911;It's really interesting how you view Fight Club the first time and then how you view it on repeat.
3912;The acting is great and believable.
3913;moving on to the blu.
3914;The packaging is pretty cool looking but it's an eco.
3915;case is it's the new re.
3916;The movie looks very good for a movie that was released in 1999.
3917;Also, the plane scene sounds incredible.
3918;i rate this movie an 8/10 but I rate this blu.
3919;this is the best movie that i've ever seen.
3920;it is funny, exciting, and interesting.
3921;But the director did it with his heart.
3922;He has come to stay.
3923;I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to other people who like this type of crazy.
3924;Don't get me wrong
3925;the themes here will make you question everything except the immediacy of the moment, the here.
3926;in his saying,You're the all.
3927;She mirrored his farce
3928;This is one insane movie.
3929;But then the movie goes from entertaining to absolutely crazy!
3930;If you want to know why you'll have to see the movie.
3931;Anyway, this is like a movie version of the Twilight Zone and I loved it.
3932;This cult fav seems to appeal to the outsider and the peculiar.
3933;I watched the movie once and couldn't make any sense of it but I knew there were a lot of people who do like this movie so I decided to give it another chance and watch it again.
3934;the book's end is about taking power back for yourself.
3935;The book is way better, and if you see the movie, you should read the book twice so you understand where Chuck is coming from.
3936;Fight Club is one of the most original and ingeniously written, directed, and acted films that has come along in a very, very long time, and its ultimate message about society is far more intelligent and responsible than the critics and censors even tried to give it credit for, but would have if they'd just *paid attention to it*!
3937;The initial story of Jack and Tyler is utterly hilarious in its shocking tastelessness
3938;You will find yourself, by turns, both amused and horrified at the ideas and images presented in this provocative film, and you WILL remain constantly engaged.
3939;The surprise ending definitely warrants at LEAST a second viewing, but I don't feel that it holds the whole story together as sensibly as it should.
3940;though it does do a pretty understandable and consistent job around 95% of the time.
3941;you'll be surprised at how interesting and responsible it ultimately is.
3942;The performances of Norton, Pitt, and Carter are absolutely first.
3943;rate, and their dialogue is utterly brilliant.
3944;I love this movie and I think Norton is the best actor of his generation!
3945;All his movies are fantastic !
3946;fight club is one of my favorite's.
3947;an outrageous claim, i know, but this is one outrageous movie.
3948;as many reviews will have you believe .
3949;Yes, there are some rather graphic scenes of fists and blood, but this is merely one part of the complex story that makes up this sensational bit of cinema.
3950;Without going into too much detail: Ed Norton [brilliant] is having serious trouble sleeping, and this is the basis for all the mayhem that ensues.
3951;with a generous dosing of laughter, shock, violence, and stabs at society .
3952;builds up to a mind.
3953;And that is the best part.
3954;Up until the end this film is excellent.
3955;And then it becomes brilliant.
3956;To sum up a long review, this movie is briliant, my personal favorite, and worth viewing many many times, dont miss it, it's a classic(in my opinion at least).
3957;As a story, Fight Club takes a more cerebral approach to ones thought processes.
3958;While many may finish the movie in total confusion, mostly everyone will agree that Fight Club is a unique movie experience.
3959;Whoever created the graphics on the cover and throughout the booklet has a very active imagination.
3960;it is quite funny** Disc one offers you your usual chapters choices with 'moving' scenes (like The Matrix), audio setup for Dolby surround for both a 2 speaker setups and 5.1 setups in English and Spanish.
3961;Disc one also gives you the choice of several audio commentaries to listen to throughout the film, including David Fincher, Bradd Pitt, Ed Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, the novelist and the screenwriter, the Director of Photography, Visual Effects Supervisor and a couple of others.
3962;Overall, the picture is moody and dark with beautiful blacks and wonderful color detail.
3963;It is beautifully photographed with incredible shadow detail and crystal clear highlights.
3964;The sound has beautiful detail, with stereo separation being impressively realistic and the music and dialogue recorded incredibly well.
3965;Surround detail is amazing with some scenes having deep bass that will make the neighbors call the cops.
3966;behind the scenes of the production, the visual effects and on.
3967;notch, but the graphical elements and the supplemental materials included are fantastic and incredibly entertaining.
3968;What can I say that hasn't been said except that for the 10 year anniversary it is awesome to see a movie that holds up.
3969;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton do such an awesome job of bringing this story to life, and the chaotic message that underscores this movie is just as important today as it was when the movie came out.
3970;Fight Club is one of those rare movies that appears only when the right combination of forces behind it give everything they've got to the cause.
3971;It takes a gutsy director, a clever screenwriter, a brilliant cast, and one hell of a production crew to get a film of this power and importance made and made well.
3972;Because of this, we are strapped into a dizzying ride through the pristine psuedo.
3973;This has to be one of the best most underrated movies ever made.
3974;Every detail in it has been scrutinized, every motion done naturally deliberate.
3975;It is funny, it is frightening, and if this movie doesn't make you think about your life, then you are one of those most in need of a Tyler Durden.
3976;in my opinion, this is the single finest disc produced to date.
3977;And it is the presentations of these that really make it stand out above the crowd.
3978;The transitions are second to none, everything is very clean.
3979;I want to start out by saying Fight Club is one of my favorite movies and every time I watch it I cannot turn away or do anything else until it's finished as it is so captivating and ingenious.
3980;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton I feel were robbed of an Oscar as I think they both gave the best performances of their careers.
3981;And the writing was so crisp and engrossing you will lose track of time.
3982;fight club is a movie that will challenge you're perceived outlook on life and society, so maybe it's not for everyone, but this is the most underrated movie ever and unquestionably David Fincher's, Brad Pitt's, and Edward Norton's best film to date.
3983;I have seen alot of movies this year, and this by far tops them all.
3984;david Fincher is a genius i loved seven and the game and alien 3.
3985;his movies just keep getting better.
3986;anyone that says this is rubbish dont listen its great!
3987;This film has defined an entire generation of corporate.
3988;working, material junkies whose spiritual path got cluttered with Ikea tables, television infomercials, and ball.
3989;Paul Palanuik's novel is perfectly adopted into an innovative visual masterpiece by David Pincher (who was at the height of his career, just came off of his other masterpiece .
3990;Best movie ever made, best actors, best script.
3991;ray version is absolutely amazing.
3992;The visuals are great and the sound, wow just wow .
3993;my ears loved it in 5.1
3994;This movie has a right to be considered a must see.
3995;This would definately have to be the best of Brad Pitt's films.
3996;I believe that movies are made to entertain.
3997;I basically enjoy all kinds of movies.
3998;But every once in a while, a movie comes out that does more than entertain, it makes you think, it makes you question and it changes your perception about various things.
3999;This is in my opinion, one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood.
4000;He finds solace in attending those self.
4001;It is then that he meets Tyler Durden, this cool, smart talking dude in a plane.
4002;i really have to say this movie really fascinated me so much with it's intelligent ideas and dialogue, partly because deep in my heart, on some level.
4003;It challenges us to think about things in life, for example our view of success.
4004;Everybody involved in this movie did a fantastic job but extra credit has to go to the director, writer and the actors.
4005;I am a huge fan and I've seen all his work, Aliens 3, Se7en, The Game and more recently Panic Room.
4006;Kudos to the actors involved too.
4007;The talented Edward Norton was excellent in his role as the Narrator.
4008;He so accurately resembled the average guy that it was scary.
4009;His voice has a perfect tone for narrating the story and he reminds me of a young Kevin Spacey.
4010;If only he gets better roles, he may very well go down a legend in Hollywood.
4011;Brad Pitt has always acted in likeable hero roles as well as feel good movies and he has managed to pull it off but in many of those roles, there was nothing special or extraordinary.
4012;In this movie, he was fantastic.
4013;like he really lives his life that way and it's what he truly believes.
4014;Any other person might have made it less exciting but Pitt nails it.
4015;And last but not least Helena Bonham Carter as Marla was also a really good choice.
4016;she delivers with a fine performance.
4017;there was a lot of bad publicity about this movie and although I admit this movie may not be for everyone, I loved it and so did most of my friends.
4018;I HIGHLY recommend this movie.
4019;It's movies like this that sets the bar higher for American cinema.
4020;Meat Loaf Aday as Robert Paulson had a small role in the film but, it was well played and well used to support the story.
4021;the screen play was decent but, it lacked some details that helped you understand some things in the movie.
4022;overall, they did do a really good job with the movie but, I still recommend you read the book as it builds upon the story and you will actually get a pretty good sense of how the story would really unfold.
4023;Fight Club was one of the most enlightening and incredible movies I have ever seen.
4024;It opened my eyes about everyday life, and it offers a unique perspective of life from a charater to whom most people can relate.
4025;The camera work and everything else about the movie was outstanding.
4026;the film itself is a great piece of cinema.
4027;Edward Norton, Jr. is one of the greatest actors today and does not disappoint with his performance in this movie.
4028;Brad Pitt, Helena Carter and others perform excellent acting jobs in this memorable film.
4029;breaking acts with no police reaction, the Fight Club's contacts in every business in the city, etc.) and enjoy the film for the great piece of cinema it is.
4030;An ending that ranks right up with The Sixth Sense as far as surprise finishes.
4031;But if you want a movie that's full of dark black humor and lines that will stay with us forever then you're in luck.
4032;Along the way he runs into Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt's best role since True Romance) and that's when the fun really starts.
4033;The commentary is great with Edward Norton and David Fincher (Brad is pretty witty himself) but I could do without Helena Bonham Carter's commentary.
4034;The internet promos are cool, the public service announcements are to die for, plus the Spanish adds are cool.
4035;You can even see a few adds they geared towards women.
4036;Most of the Fight Club reviews posted here focus on the brilliance of the film and it's message.
4037;I, on the other hand, would like to focus on the challenges it provides to it's audience.
4038;Having been a fan of Stanley Kubrick for years, I must compliment David Fincher as being the only director working today with a similar passion for filmmaking.
4039;Films are a director's way of communicating an art form, and Fincher has managed to do that with each of his releases.
4040;as human beings we should have a thirst for challenges, and Fincher provides that to his audience with his cinematic creations.
4041;to truly love films we must be willing to suspend our belief systems and accept a difference of opinion.
4042;Because of this, Fight Club is worthy of the highest rating.
4043;These people are more and more more insane for mood!
4044;They have the beat themselves about the face and bleedings so much, and they always continue to be made the joke!
4045;Fight Club is such a literate, well.
4046;acted, visually impressive movie that you could easily miss the fact that it doesn't have a singe interesting thought in its head.
4047;the movie is visually stylish, and the fight scenes pack a punch, but ultimately the whole thing is emptier than Fincher's previous work: Seven and the underrated Alien3.
4048;he hasn't seen it yet but I know he'll love it!
4049;One of the greatest movies of our generation, hands down.
4050;An exquisite blend of sociopathic behavior, psychosis and dark humor.
4051;the fight clubs and any violence associated with them are very ancillary to the main story.
4052;Whether you choose to seek this or other allegorical interpretations of the film, it is enjoyable on many levels, not the least of which is the story of the Narrator and his descent into madness and redemption.
4053;the vehicle which propels the movie (the relationship between the Narrator and Tyler) will be the subject of some discussion as the vehicle that carried the movie Memento was and is.
4054;Even knowing the major plot twist, I have enjoyed it many times since.
4055;It is a great film and further, stands as a great adaptation of the book.
4056;Even the author thought the adaptation added to original.
4057;They were really well cast and the feeling is that Director David Fincher really got them to bring the original characters alive on the screen.
4058;Ed Norton in his portrayal of the Narrator, is a perfect foil to Pitt's Tyler Durden.
4059;I loved this movie, I have seen so many movie lately but none compare to this!
4060;Anyone with an open mind should see this movie and find out what I am talking about.
4061;Yes, that is a bold statement, and yes I've seen more of the so. called classics than say most people (Due to an exponential amount of free time), but this film is truely great.
4062;The characters are complex, and the plot is thick.
4063;The Narrator(Norton) is kind of humorus in the fact ol' Chuck's idea while writing the book without and name for the main character was to make this possibly about anyone, any average Joe.
4064;every actor is perfect, David Fincher is perfect, and the ideas behind it are.
4065;All great works are like that, controversial.
4066;One of my most favorite movies EVER!
4067;Tyler Durden (Pitt) gives them meaning and the kind of macho comradery all men want, but he uses that to take advantage of them.
4068;i like David Finchers work as a director, this is his best movie.
4069;His dark style compliments the dark humor and mood of Fight Club VERY well.
4070;Edward Norton was also well cast and did a great job, but Pitt made this movie shine.
4071;fight Club has fantasticly twisted dark humor that takes shot after shot at our culture.
4072;If you like dark humor like me, you will love every moment if this movie.
4073;Not many women will enjoy it!
4074;it's easier to see it as a smart, committed and complex piece of filmmaking.
4075;David Fincher once again dazzles with his direction, which is as intelligently energetic as the acting of Brad Pitt and, especially, Edward Norton.
4076;What's really impressive, however, is the way that the film manages to flirt with an anti.
4077;but watch closely in the movie's second half and see how subtly and hilariously Fincher undermines this: the anarchists begin to chant management.
4078;Here's the thing, this is a good movie.
4079;The acting is really good, the story is interesting, and the narrative is cool.
4080;I guess most people like their movies deep entertaining.
4081;Personally, I like face value entertaining and only really consume on face value.
4082;This movie is so amazing, I don't think I have enough words to describe how awesome this movie was.
4083;a classic movie everyone should see.
4084;but if you want a movie about a man who is struggling with his life, finds something that makes him happy and a friend, but everything just completely goes wrong in a psychological thriller, this is for you.
4085;This movie also makes you think about the world around you.
4086;Edward creates Tyler Durden who is someone he sees himself as, someone with confidence, someone who takes risks, and most importantly someone who is a leader and knows where he is going!
4087;This movie will surprise you with the clues it gives you during the whole movie, yet you never seem to come to terms with what is really going on untill the end when you discover that the two lead charaters are actually the same person.
4088;The thing is that it is really gritty but most good movies of the 90s were like the Tarintino films.
4089;But what made its so interesting was the camera work in three frames they sliced in Brad Pitt.
4090;On watching this classic again, at that same scene, I thought: Ah, back when payphones still existed.
4091;Despite it all, FIGHT CLUB remains a timeless classic, as relevant and entertaining now as it ever was.
4092;The comedy is priceless, the action is entertaining, and the characters are enthralling.
4093;I thought it was going to be a macho movie about guys beating eachother up.
4094;i finally saw it, and it's one of my all time favorites.
4095;the way it's filmed, edward norton's performance, the thoughts and ideas expressed, everything.
4096;i'm a girl, and i enjoyed this movie very much!
4097;First of all this is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen, it is so incredibly original, yet true.
4098;I mean everyone was all wrapped in the matrix hype, including me, but this movie actually has a lot of truth.
4099;It has awesome directing, great acting and a killer story, what else can i say?!
4100;The deadpan comments on our society are spot.
4101;on, hilarious, and a bit unnerving.
4102;At this point in time, please refer to Rule #1.
4103;if you are still reading this, refer to Rule #2.
4104;The extra materials included (though not exactly the wealth one would expect) are worth the watch2.
4105;the movie, without a doubt is definitely worth what you pay for but the packaging was a downer.
4106;But, I still recommend this product.
4107;This is simply a classic!!
4108;Fight Club is elegant and brutal, sophisticated and terrifying.
4109;It grabs our values by the throat and demands that they answer for themselves.
4110;Beautifully photographed, the movie is dark and disturbing in hopes that you will not lose the point.
4111;It's about loyalty, leadership, and the mentality of the pack.
4112;I watched it and i loved it.
4113;Its really thought provoking, and i feel like it has really changed my life, so to speak.
4114;It's a great movie, that I thought about for hours after seeing it.
4115;Also the extra's are great.
4116;This is the Ed Nortons best performance by far.
4117;The ending is also spectacular.
4118;Although it was rudely ignored at the Oscars it gives a great representation of how society makes us think that we are going to be rich and famous,but were not so we might as well enjoy life as much as we can(Tyler's words coming out of my mouth).
4119;A truly brilliant film with great performances all round(if I could increase the stars to 6, I would)
4120;great story, very interesting plot, and oh yeah a stampede of Tyler Durdenism.
4121;the acting in the movie is good.
4122;The philosophies of Tyler Durden might be a little depressing and can make one feel worthless, but very interesting nonetheless.
4123;It's basically about a person determined to change our materialistic and commercialized world with the help of a stronger person to latch onto.
4124;Then it moves onto something greatly larger.
4125;Super fast, and super easy to work with.
4126;Very happy and can't wait to watch it, thank you do much
4127;Fight Club is one of my favorite movies for excellent directing, acting, script, story, etc.
4128;ray is an excellent version.
4129;The video and audio are excellent.
4130;brad Pitt delivers a comical and raw role as a free spirit intent on exposing the true horror and misdirection this material world brings.
4131;He loves to move place to place, and to mutilate the body, to invoke a state of complete freedom and valance.
4132;After a series of business trips, he finds a witty friend and finds that he is his new best friend.
4133;The dialoge was absolutely intelligent and witty.
4134;This movie is absolutely excellent, a psychological masterpiece, and a joy for any movie lover.
4135;after watching the movie and finding that it was indeed based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, I (who hardly ever reads) picked the book and read it, and loved every word in it.
4136;Still, I'd say they have done a very, very good job.
4137;And most descriptions in the book truly come alive in the movie.
4138;brad, Ed and Helena have all done a very terrific job at their roles, and I must commend the casting director .
4139;just feel compelled to add that if you already have the brown.
4140;This is an excellent film .
4141;This movie is full of witty dialogue, great characters and strangely perfect ending.
4142;Each actor fits there role extremely well.
4143;This film is about a thinking, feeling, individual's quest for self.
4144;In the modern world, traditional values such as love, honor, devotion, patriotism, even faith are being subverted by slick marketing of desire attachments (BMW?)
4145;And you'll think about guy things.
4146;The masculine, logical mind has a tremendous burden in each generation.
4147;Thus, people seeking a romantic movie are appalled, and people seeking an adventure are pleased.
4148;this is why I bought it in the first place on Blu.
4149;In truth, human activity after 5 in America is diverse.
4150;Yeah, Brad Pitt is believable as a handsome, cocky, cool guy.
4151;It kind of scary in a this is too familiar way but it also has humor.
4152;His character is kind of cool but a little retarded and whacked out psychologically.
4153;it reaches you on a deeper level without being deep or wishywashy/sappy.
4154;Yeah, it's that kind of a movie.
4155;Well, let me just start by quoting a line from this masterpiece, How much do you know about yourself, when you've never been in a fight?
4156;I am sure this movie would make J B Say quite happy for that point.
4157;the dialogues in the movie make the movie worth watchin many times over.
4158;the casting is just perfect.
4159;the actors never give you the impression that they are acting, which is how it shhould be.
4160;Brad Pitt, Ed Norton and Helena Bonham deliver the performance of their lives.
4161;Fincher is one of the best directors of Hollywood.
4162;well, credit goes to Jim Ulhs for the awesome screenplay and Chuck Palahniuk for writing the great book with the same name.
4163;the ending is poetic, with a mind.
4164;blowing song from The Pixies enthralling you while saying  Where is my mind, so apt!!!
4165;This movie brings great joy and great pain at teh same time (that awesome feeling).
4166;well, let me finish with a line from the movie  Its only after you lost everything, you are free to do anything.
4167;I thought this film was rather good entertainment for an evening.
4168;It has a good story and has an interesting twist near the end.
4169;Ed Norton's best performance to date and Brad Pitt plays an excellent supporting role.
4170;Although the blood is a bit intense at times the story line and dialog kept me glued to the screen.
4171;A nearly flawless film that takes viewers along for the rush.
4172;No words can explain the joy of watching this film.
4173;This truly brilliant satire expects a lot from a viewer.
4174;It's been a while since a film lets go and lets the audience catch up.
4175;This was the best film of the decade, even better than Pulp Fiction.
4176;This film is the ride.
4177;this movie is definitely addictive.
4178;it will haunt you for weeks and have you questioning everything that has ever made sense to you in your entire adult lifetime.
4179;Must watch more than once.
4180;This is the best movie by far.
4181;So many good quotes and such a good movie.
4182;but it was VERY entertaining.
4183;Nice to see Pitt with his pants down around his hips.
4184;Only the best movie ever, written by the best author ever, Chuck Palahniuk.
4185;Almost all of my female friends LOVED it, and almost all of my male friends HATED it.
4186;The basic plot of a mentally imbalanced man searching for what he wants in life helps extrapolate the myriad themes present.
4187;Also, one completely intriguing aspect of this film that many dislike is its absence of complete closure.
4188;I notice that people often enjoy a movie better when they are dictated what they are supposed to take from the movies message and what they are supposed to understand happens.
4189;To do this well is to create art.
4190;The Chuck Palahniuk, and the cast and crew that made Fight Club a movie did this well.
4191;Finally, one more surprising turn is taken, and the film turns into a tightly wound psychological thriller.
4192;The film exceeds at all these levels, but not fully so.
4193;but the flaws were overpowered by a strong script, strong characterizations, great acting and photography, and many great moments.
4194;The idea of the fight club is inventive and highly fascinating.
4195;This really shines on Brad Pitt as one of his greatest, if not, his greatest job of acting, as the multi.
4196;Edward Norton is absolutely unstoppable as the narrator, and Brad Pitt combines a certain sexiness and bad.
4197;boy sensitivity to create Tyler.
4198;David Fincher has created a masterpiece, and after Fight Club, you won't look at the world in the same way.
4199;I heard so many people saying this is a great movie.
4200;The only potential element of redemption I foresaw in it at all, was my appreciation for Edward Norton's extraordinary talent.
4201;What instead unfolded before me was a divine delivery of unusually witty dialogue, biting dark humor, exceptional acting (surprisingly, even from Brad Pitt), hilariously insightful narration, a remarkably original script, phenomenal directing, ingenious filming and inventive imagery, as well as a wonderfully complimentary soundtrack, collectively juxtaposed in rare harmonic perfection.
4202;Cleverly shocking, Fight Club unravels as a brilliant satire of modern civilization as well as a disturbing poke at the mundaneness of a consumerist existence.
4203;Iconoclastic in it's portrayal of our cultural conventions and values, the philosophy entertained in this movie challenges our most basic beliefs and assumptions about reality.
4204;great movie, and it was used but not a scratch on it.
4205;its not one of those movies that replaces good plot with half naked girls like the mass majority of movies now, it is actually quite a decent story.
4206;He has had a busy year, he is an insomniac, he goes to several anonymous meetings just to keep himself busy.
4207;Every meeting he attends, a beautiful woman named Marla always follows him.
4208;She even attends the testicular cancer one (LMAO!)
4209;It's only a matter of time before Jack becomes confused, and things spiral out of control!THOUGHTS: This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
4210;It is packed with special features.
4211;I love the style of writing, the political satires, the dark imagery, the characters.
4212;One of my favorite books to date.
4213;Overall, the movie is fantastic with amazing acting jobs and great imagery.
4214;If nothing else, read it for the interesting end, and the sharp, witty writing of Chuck P.
4215;In my opinion this is the best movie of all time, to me it is even more than just a movie.
4216;Edward Norton and Brad Pitt played to of their best roles of all time.
4217;I also would like to thank the director David Fincher for putting together such a great spectacle.
4218;And everyone else who worked on it , thank you all for this great gift to america and human spirits alike.
4219;Not only is the adaptation to film brilliant, but the added scenes and ideas seem as though they were meant to be in the original novel.
4220;There are also T. v spots, trailors, commentaries, and various other fun stuff.
4221;I think the ending to the movie is better than the ending to the book.
4222;Pitt and Norton are in fine form.
4223;Under the incredible violence is a well acted, directed, and very thought.
4224;Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are surprisingly good in lead roles.
4225;This movie was billed as being about fighting, but its really about the human soul and the box of conventionality in which we keep it locked.
4226;The great war is a spiritual war.
4227;The great depression is our lives.'
4228;For Durden, consumerism and the American dream is the enemy.
4229;He brought to this film, a street wise, who gives a damn attitude that made this film what it is.
4230;Edward Norton, well I have been a fan of his for a while.
4231;So that was an even and great match to me.
4232;the film has so many twists and turns that it will keep your head spinning.
4233;I went in to this film, awaiting a hoorid movie, and came out thinking what a great job.
4234;If you do not understand the plot, it is as simple as that.
4235;hoped I helped you either way,R__Y__A__N___A__N__
4236;goers, even the best and the brightest adults I know cannot fully incorporate this movie into thier minds, understandable.
4237;the very beggining of the movie is a honest sight on the flaws of modern corporate society.
4238;however most guys will jump all over this because it's cool regardless of it's meaning.
4239;This puts the Modern Nihilistic view in a more balanced light.
4240;All in all this gives an objective view of nihilism and allows men to have a chooice in what kind of life they want to lead and how they want to control it.
4241;it is alot to swallow in 140 minutes and take many viewings to take it in entirely, therefore i recommend a second viewing if you thing you really didn't quite get it .
4242;Hear me now and believe me later: this movie is one of the most important movies you will ever watch.
4243;Not only is it a great movie in it's own right, but the message it espouses is something everyone needs to hear.
4244;materialism theme rings loudly throughout the movie, and it's something everyone should think about.
4245;If anything, the movie has a Communistic flavor.
4246;The party works together for the betterment of the people working in it.
4247;And as the group demonstrates in the scene with the Chief of Police, it is the working class, everyone around you, that is responsible.
4248;The other themes and messages are important as well.
4249;Not only that, but it's just a darn good movie, with a great surprise ending.
4250;Whatever you need to do, this movie is important, and everyone should experience it.
4251;This movie was so brilliant!
4252;I also like the fact that David Fincher directed this movie, he did a very good job in fooling the entire audience, much like he did for the film Se7en and The Game.
4253;Fincher will probably never top this film in the rest of his career, this is his masterpiece.
4254;Meatloaf also has a role in the film and luckily he doesn't sing, his character is actually very amusing.
4255;This movie works on so many levels, a rarity in films these days.
4256;There's the strong sense of homo.
4257;Another great aspcet is the surprise twist, ala The Usual Suspects .
4258;With all of these great cinematic layers, and more that there is not enough room to mention, this is a movie that forces you to watch over and over and actually think!
4259;I thought this movie was brilliant at the theater.
4260;I enjoyed its black humour.
4261;I found the story, and the cinematography just beautiful.
4262;so the movie itself was great.
4263;one of the best features of the movie is the commentry by Fincher, Pitt and Norton.
4264;With their humour and their insight into the ideas of the movie.
4265;the features that show off how the movies SFX will just amaze.
4266;I love computer graphics, and this stuff REALLY shows what you can do.
4267;David Fincher directed this film perfectly.
4268;his use of camera angles,shaking the camera,and blurred shots fit so well with the tone of the film.
4269;brad Pitt was an excellent choice for the role of Tyler Durden the man who makes and sells soap for a living,but is extremely complex.
4270;this is Pitt at his best.
4271;Fight club is the most well made movie i've ever seen.
4272;in addition to that it is the most insightful movie I know of.
4273;Favorite film of the 90's, Stellar cast.
4274;:) Good action, great psychological thriller, with some pro.
4275;Just a modern classic movie.
4276;there is plenty of kick ass fights and quirky enough to still keep your interest.
4277;Has great performances by Brad pitt and Edward Norton.
4278;Plus it has Meat loaf!
4279;Great movie, cool story.10 years from now this will be considered one of the greatest underground classics of all time.
4280;Does it make you feel better?
4281;i finally got a chance to see the film on my recent flight over to China.
4282;But, it is well shot, with great performances from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Elizabeth Bonham.
4283;A chance meeting with Brad Pitt's character sets things in action, and the two men form a bond through fighting, and then by setting up a fight club.
4284;but, I would recommend it, as something to watch and then ponder.
4285;It was scary, terrifing, troubling, funny, sensative and basically the same emotions that is held in each one of us.
4286;Basically i bought this movie because i'm a big Ed Norton fan.
4287;He's the finest that Hollywood has but at the end of the film every emotion that i have ran thru my body in a scary.
4288;Fight Club is raw and real.
4289;The acting is the best.
4290;The extra information that are on the disks is the best.
4291;It's a real mans movie even though many women like it as well.
4292;i truly hated it and yet liked it.
4293;Fight Club is truly in a class by itself.
4294;It is a film that you would not want to take a date to, nor is it a film that will entertain you.
4295;The story centers around the relationship of two people, Pitt and Norton, and the enjoyment they get from beating the heck out of each other.
4296;but it definitely is one film like no other.
4297;I really think this film is so iconic of this style that it will be a classic to which all others are compared.
4298;This movie was top 20 on the IMDB list of best movies of all time.
4299;So i ordered the movie to watch, and it defiantly deserves where it is on that list.
4300;This is one of my favorite movies to date.
4301;to all the kids who started their own fight clubs, and you'd be surprised at how many actually did.
4302;i say this: actually read into the movie.
4303;david Fincher, Pitt, and Norton deserved Academy Awards.
4304;Probably the greatest social analysis in film of any generation.
4305;The rest is just delicious garnishing.
4306;This movie was really incredible.
4307;It completely captured the GenX disillusionment with our pop.
4308;The dialogue is witty and intelligent.
4309;Having watched the movie a few times now, I enjoyed picking out elements throughout the beginning half of the movie that supported Jack's revelation later.
4310;They definitely provide enough great stuff to warrant a 2 disc set.
4311;What I got was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, partly because it was so unexpected.
4312;This movie is completly unique, the only way to compare it to anything is to imagine Clockwork Orange with Mel Brooks as an editor.
4313;A nearly perfect movie, thoughtfully directed and wonderfully scored, which is marred only by a weak finish (minus the shocker.
4314;sense which is dropped on the viewer during the final scene).
4315;Like many great films, it artfully blends suspense, action, comedy, and a quirky kind of romance to create a tapestry that keeps the viewer engaged.
4316;This movie is worth seeing many times.
4317;After you've watched it three or four times, you'll undoubtedly want to share the experience with your friends.
4318;sutra scene) and all the way to the final scene, this movie will stun you with its masterful use of editing, photogrammetry, and several other cutting.
4319;During the movie I found myself slamming beers and shots of whiskey!
4320;It reminded me of the intense male comraderie I felt during my time in the Marines!
4321;It was incredibly shocking and in my opinion very original and gratifying.
4322;It's unfortunate because it really is an intelligent male.
4323;Highly recommended to those with brains and a love of fiction.
4324;That's funny, I didn't see any.
4325;best list (a quick run.
4326;esque fascination with brand names (excepting, of course, the wonderfully clever scene in which Fincher populates Norton's character's condo with catalog pages), but once I realized that Palahniuk was actually going somewhere with his brand.
4327;The dialogue and the narration were both clever, witty, and in places laugh.
4328;Durden is everything the narrator is not
4329;More surprising was the film's comedic aspect
4330;It all comes together perfectly, the archetypal modern tragedy brought stylishly down to the level of metatheatre during the film's climax.
4331;, setting, cinematography, it was all fantastic.
4332;note 9Dec2013: Dario Argento, David Cronenberg, John Frankenheimer, William Friedkin, Alfred Hitchcock, Sidney Lumet, Takashi Miike, Yasujiro Ozu, George A. Romero, Martin Scorsese, B la Tarr, Orson Welles, and Billy Wilder (thirteen, if you dont feel like counting) are all represented in the Top 100 by two films apiece.
4333;this is a movie for intelligent people who have some angst about the way things are going under the mismanagement of the business as usual political parties, and for those who question the gerbil on a wheel existence that most jobs offer.
4334;i found it completely absorbing and very worthwhile.
4335;Everyone i took to see this movie, females included, wanted to see it again, at least once.
4336;The dialoge is brilliant, the cenematogrophy is better, the casting is perfect, the soundtrack is pumping and, i don't care what anyone else says, the ending is JUST COOL.
4337;If you ever wondered what its like to be a skizoid insnomiac sociopath with violent tendencies, see this movie.
4338;A preacher once prayed, Lord, please give me a good sermon to go with this joke.
4339;meet The Narrator, played masterfully by Ed Norton, who is a deeply troubled young man working for a major auto manufacturer assessing whether recalls on defective auto parts will exceed the cost of all the lawsuits that could result.
4340;He's rugged, handsome, and very bold with his words, spouting off the post.
4341;And thus is born the Fight Club.
4342;They all live in Tyler's dilapidated house and perform various assignments from destroying corporate art and franchise coffee bars, to urinating in restaurant.
4343;What director David Fincher (Seven, The Game) and writer Chuck Palahnuik have created is in my opinion art for the sake of being artistic.
4344;They can rest assured that it will appeal to at least one underground coterie.
4345;and, alas, Fight Club, while containing some good one.
4346;liners and excellent acting, never gets off the ground despite taking a giant leap.
4347;there were certainly some clever aspects.
4348;does this sound like the movie of a true reformer or a good ol' boy looking for fun on a Saturday night?
4349;Fight Club, for me, is the masterpiece of David Fincher.
4350;The edition have some special features.
4351;The best, no doubt, is the commentary tracks.
4352;Gave it as a gift and as far as I know there have been no issues with the blu ray.
4353;And I knew I really loved Edward Norton.
4354;Eventually, by meeting Tyler Durden (Pitt), he joins the Club that gives him the best sense of belonging.
4355;A club of men who fight, who are insanely violent to one another, who are bound together by an oath, yet secret as they are, they become incredibly popular.
4356;And this is the purpose ofd fighting for its own sake.
4357;What makes us feel alive?
4358;a film that also espouses a kind of nihilistic tendency .
4359;this film is open and honest, brutally honest, in telling you where such a belief could very well take you.
4360;One can believe that Durden is a realistic character.
4361;In some ways I liked it because it was as shocking, or even more so, than the ending to The Sixth Sense.
4362;And I like to be shocked.
4363;One of my favorite pieces of 90s cinema.
4364;Some differences from the novel ( of course ) but it complements Chuck's novel well.
4365;it's a great movie and now i own it on blu.
4366;The pivotal plot twist (after the Sixth Sense twist.
4367;fight Club is beautifully shot, has a great script and appropriate background music.
4368;And they were right, this is one of those I've got to see this again movies.
4369;it's just the path to show you something.
4370;It started ok, as the one redeeming feature (Norton's acting)was pulling it thorugh.
4371;This is definatly a must see movie!
4372;The movie is arresting, with good performances, but it is basically shallow and manipulative.
4373;I loved fight club so much I saw the film three times.
4374;If you like Brad Pitt and Edward Norton you will love this film.
4375;And also read the book I did and it was just as good as the MOVIE.
4376;Every so often a movie bursts upon our cultural shores with direct hits on so many levels that it overwhelms our ability to completely absorb all the content in one viewing.
4377;After all the signs, symbols, philosophies and twists have been deciphered there are still the detailed production values and crackling acting to keep us entertained.
4378;The screenwriting is precise, detailed, and hits the targets dead center.
4379;contained completeness may eventually cause the movie to drop from my fascination radar but until that day, I enjoy the benefit of some well.
4380;i don't recommend this movie to anybody.
4381;And this is the point of the movie, to make you think rather than to make you love it.
4382;The movies tells things in a way that is unrestricted, which makes everything more vivid and more powerful than if it had been made around the aspirations of the audience it wished to draw into the movie theater.
4383;And although people will certainly have their opinions, I believe that this illustration of the freedom of movie making puts it right up there with cult classics like Blade Runner and others.
4384;first off, the Script is a thing of beauty.
4385;Not only is it filled with very dark images all set in a comedic tone, but it also illustrates perfectly the message that the movie is trying to portray.
4386;Fight Club itself is part action, part black comedy, part mystery, part thriller, and part insanity.
4387;the acting is also top notch.
4388;Brad Pitt is, out of all the characters, the one who holds the screen the best.
4389;Then there is Helena Bonham Carter, who shines as the crazed and slightly neurotic love interest of Pitt and Norton.
4390;Although her presence in the movie isn't huge, her placement in certain scenes is vital to the forward motion of the plot and the entire movie in general.
4391;If you love to see the insides of a movie and find out more about why the director or the producer or actors did certain things then you'll love all these extras.
4392;Director David Fincher's look at the underground world is both slick and startling and anyone who calls him or herself a movie buff has to give this movie a chance.
4393;Fight Club provides an alternative perspective on the world we live in .
4394;I was too fascinated to leave it alone so I saw the movie many more times, each time seeing it in a new light.
4395;Brad Pitt's character wishes to be delivered from clear skin and perfect teeth, meaning these things are not truly important entities in life.
4396;Even though this movie is a challege to watch and endure, the message it delivers is worth it.
4397;I love the dynamics of it!!
4398;The story line just progresses so smoothly.
4399;I loved Brad Pitt and Edward Norton is a freak!
4400;This movie is definitely a mind trip.
4401;I know this movie is almost 15 years old now, but it's still my favorite movie.
4402;It's one of those macho man movies that we all can relate to.
4403;this is a must on a macho alpha collection, LOLthis version even have a bonus with the commercials and tv spots,
4404;Elements like this are true signs of the 15 minute fame mark.
4405;I just finished viewing the video and had to come here to see if everyone else loved it as much as I did.
4406;It's packed full of extras including extensive behind.
4407;And the packaging is great!
4408;`Fight Club' becomes one of the first movies to actually address the issue, bluntly and directly.
4409;As far from his barbaric ancestral roots as any man worthy of the label can be, Jack has turned to haunting feel.
4410;driven values has created for him.
4411;overdue theme, it insidiously lures us in to the glamorous excitement of the fight scenes themselves.
4412;influenced, perfectly coordinated apartment and the self.
4413;This is the genius of the film: it makes us just as cognizant of the compromises we ourselves routinely make to social norms as it does Jack.
4414;Having set up this fascinating premise, `Fight Club' decides, rather inexplicably, to go the sci.
4415;It is true that the dark comedy flavor that runs throughout the film does create a world where the improbable can be made possible.
4416;special note should indeed be made of the extraordinary performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.
4417;Pitt, in one of his finest roles to date, conveys the macho hard.
4418;Norton always keeps his character focused and life.
4419;sized, allowing Tyler to exploit these inner yearnings yet remaining enough on the outside to continually question the validity of his actions.
4420;The film provides some real food for thought and, in all honesty, how many movies can you truly say that about?
4421;The script was tight, the theme fascinating, the acting incredible (especially Edward Norton, as one might expect), the direction inspired, and the cinematography stunning.
4422;It is one of those films in the past few years that deserves to be seen several times.
4423;Norton was nominated for best actor.
4424;I loved this film from the first time I knew that it existed.
4425;It has loads of comedy!
4426;I admit it's not Naked Gun, but there is subtle and blatant humor throughout the film.
4427;It is truely enjoyable to watch.
4428;In short, if you give this movie a chance (3 or 4 viewings) you will discover the true beauty behind this masterpiece and it will change your life, for the betterment of mankind.
4429;Thanks for the second chance Amazon!
4430;I hate to say it, but the man is an extremely talented actor.
4431;fight Club is the best movie ever made.
4432;But seriously, I have picked up something new that makes the plot even more extreme each time I have watched it.
4433;I am so sad.3) It's brilliant.
4434;4) Edward Norton is my favorite actor.
4435;It's just a piece of the puzzle.
4436;Wow, now that is conviction to your career.5) The soundtrack is the finest soundtrack that any movie has put out.
4437;You'll see what I mean.8) David Fincher is brilliant.
4438;It's got some interesting audio commentaries (at least two of them are with director David Fincher), a boatload of publicity (including some fake PSA's with Ed Norton and Brad Pitt), and great behind.
4439;scenes segments, wrapped up in a package that stands out from its competitors.
4440;Aside from that, the movie is a rather stunning trip that obviously isn't meant for everyone.
4441;The performances are great, from Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden (a sick philosopher.
4442;This movie was unsettling, both visually and verbally.
4443;Is it a great movie that'll be remembered in 20 years?
4444;This is the first movie I have seen that used violence as a flashpoint to deliver the movie's message and I found it brutal but acceptable.
4445;I recommend this for thought, not for light entertainment.
4446;try the book then rewatch the movie, so much fun.
4447;A classic commentary on manhood in crisis
4448;This is one of the most interesting Hollywood films I have seen in a long time.
4449;It explores some very troubling themes.
4450;the cinematography is stunning and uses a techique employed by the character Tyler Durden in the film: Tyler, in his job as a theater projectionist, splices pornographic one.
4451;frame shots into the films he runs.
4452;and that's another great aspect of this film.
4453;social humor, which will not appeal to all tastes, but which is brilliantly carried off.
4454;Just seeing Brad Pitt in his filthy bathrobe with the appliqued coffee cups all over it is funny.
4455;pitt's acting is wonderful, so is Ed Norton's.
4456;and the two of them together make a synergy which is very powerful.
4457;It is daring, provocative, and very funny.
4458;Outstanding movie with a terrific ending, how many people actually noticed the subliminal Tyler's?
4459;My buddy pointed out the one in the doctor's office, and I found the other's.
4460;Besides the slick little tricks like that, this is an outstanding movie that's actually very subtle for being so in your face.
4461;If you hate your job, or your life in general, this movie will put in it in a whole new light.
4462;The acting is superb, the script well written and the atmosphere, sets, camera.
4463;work and pacing are all excellent.
4464;David Fincher has created an amazing movie.
4465;It's well worth your time.
4466;Has anyone noticed the amazing similarities between fight club and American Beauty?
4467;both movies are very alike, yet one of them was nominating for best picture.
4468;The movie was also beautifully shot.
4469;All of his movies including Aliens 3 have a vision all on there own.
4470;I highly recommend this movie for love of film and for the love of a great movie, thank you david fincher.
4471;One sentence should sum it's brilliance up quite nicely.
4472;This movie is truly a great film.
4473;Covering all the genres, Fight Club is funny, sad, violent, mellow, suspenseful and most importantly great all throughout from beginning to end.
4474;Keeping pretty true the book by Chuck Palahuniuk, Director David Fincher did a really great job portraying it.
4475;This is my favorite movie of all time!
4476;It's definitely one that's aimed toward guys but it's a sophisticated and well put together movie that I feel anyone could enjoy.
4477;There's points in the movie that may be too 'touchy' for females but the story well then makes up for it.
4478;The case is awesome just as well.
4479;It very well may be the best movie David Fincher ever directed.
4480;This movie made my top 5.
4481;I love the fact that you can watch it over and over again and get something new from it each time.
4482;It really makes you feel for Tyler and It is definitely a must have for any movie collector.
4483;I would recommend it to anyone.
4484;Even after 20 times of seeing it I still love it.
4485;This probably ties with Se7en for Brad Pitt's best performance and is a great step for Chuck Palahniuk, the author of Fight Club, to gain light on his interesting style of narration.
4486;extremely relevant to the modern American culture, Fight Club is a dark comedy which acts as a cautionary tale about what happens to society when its men are emasculated, devalued, and robbed of any meaningful role as men.
4487;they are essential to the main idea.
4488;channeling their masculinity in creative and constructive ways.
4489;A homeless guy with a digital camcorder made it, and its SO well done its crazy.
4490;like atmosphere, so dont expect a thrill ride.
4491;Tyler's wisdom is freakishly true.
4492;That is the true meaning of the story.
4493;Watch the movie, and you will soon understand the point of FIGHT CLUB !
4494;This movie would have to be one of the best ever.
4495;It not only offers entertainment like never before but it also educates us to some extent.
4496;This is original and stays true to the novel.
4497;These are just a few of the reasons this is a great movie.
4498;The cast was excellent and they played their roles without fault.
4499;Edward Norton is the real star in this movie, you will realize this in the first 10 minutes.
4500;Some of the greatest dialogue is heard in the first 10 minutes and continues all the way through.
4501;One of the best movies of all time.
4502;Once you watch it a few times you start to see it more and more.
4503;I must say after watching the Fight Club, I found it one of the most interesting films ever.
4504;The story, camera and acting of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were excellent.
4505;Absolutely one of the top 20 films of all time.
4506;They bond and Jack is invited to live with Tyler.
4507;Things start happening that affect Jack profoundly.
4508;The common line is we are a generation of men raised by women.
4509;The Club turns into a rowdy group, causing chaos across the city.
4510;The ending is a big twist and begs one to see the movie again to see where the twist should have been a known during the movie.
4511;Edward Norton's narration is perfect and I watch the movie to listen to his narration as much as anything else.
4512;Brad Pitt has the ability to portray the Alpha male to a tee and his personal style exemplifies Tyler Durden.
4513;An amazing movie in amazing Blu.
4514;Brad Pitt/Edward Norton: two awesomely talented actors (Edward Norton much more multitalented, but Brad Pitt excellent at the kind of supporting role that he was nominated for in 12 Monkeys) teamed up as a match made in heaven.
4515;I read the novel before seeing the movie, and the screenplay adaption is brilliant, leaving out and/or adding things, and making other people say certain lines along with mixing around events, excluding the unneeded and adding the lacking.
4516;Amazing cinematography mixed with awesome CGI sequences that look very real.
4517;Great editing and SOUND EFFECTS EDITING (Oscar nomination).
4518;In the book, it is explained in a way that makes sense.
4519;From the astounding themes to the directing style of David Fincher, this is now one of my favorite movies of all time.
4520;I think this is the one of the best movies ever created .
4521;just crazy intense and so much stuff to learn from this movie .
4522;I particularly enjoyed the special features.
4523;The participants are awarded a red hat upon completion of their first fight.
4524;Anytime you see an old lady wearing a red hat you should definitely ask her if she got that in fight club.
4525;care soap maker and they form an underground fight club that evolves into something much, much more.
4526;I immediately rewound it and began it again, giving it the attention it deserved.
4527;After it was over, I rewound it again and watched it.
4528;Similar to the opening of The Sixth Sense: pay proper attention, and the solution is easily predictable.
4529;knuckle fighting (with draws connections to Brad Pitt's role in Snatch).
4530;It serves simply as a method of finding people who meet certain characteristics to perform certain activities.
4531;It is a jarring, thought.
4532;provoking satire on society in the 90's, and it's consistently sharp observations about men and their search for lost identity is something that is easy to admire.
4533;David Fincher does a masterful creating both a visually and mentally compelling picture.
4534;Edward Norton is good, but Brad Pitt is simply astounding as the fearless sociopath.
4535;course, and detracts from it's overall credibility.
4536;That's too bad, because if it wasn't for that, this could of easily been one of 1999's most brilliant film.
4537;This movie is one of those types of movies that has to be seen more than once to fully appreciate.
4538;And if you haven't seen this film yet, do so!
4539;And view it more than once . . . I'm out
4540;This film will have a lasting impact, and, as the text inside the packaging points out, is indeed probably the movie by which all others of the 21st century should be compared.
4541;After seeing it for the first time, at the last frame I proclaimed to myself This is the best movie anyone has ever made.
4542;It is beautifully rendered and simply chock full of complexity that takes multiple viewings to appreciate.
4543;At least you'll be trying to hit rock bottom, and that's a start right there.
4544;Be wowed by its imagery and chuckle as it pulls all these tricks on your mind.
4545;It is, in fact, that good.
4546;Aside from the typical morbidity of David Fincher, I was pleased by the originality of the film and the performances of the two leads.
4547;Pitt and Norton are excellent but this film is definitely not for everyone.
4548;Judging from the final box office take of the picture, most people indeed felt the same way.
4549;I kind of feel bad I enjoyed it as much as I did.
4550;Not only was it a great movie, but a great cinematic experience as well.
4551;I feel this film deserves a second viewing to catch it all.
4552;A movie that truly speaks for itself.
4553;The great chemistry between Norton and Pitt is explosive.
4554;every frame of this film is a photographic work of art.
4555;also, the soundtrack is incredible.
4556;The atmospheric effect with the Dolby 5.1 system really draws you into the movie.
4557;\m/When the fight begins withinhimself, a man's worth something.
4558;This isn't one of those films it can be watched numerous times and you won't get sick of it and you will catch something new everytime you watch.
4559;This is the best book to movie adpation I have ever seen Chuck Palahniuk brought us into the demented world of Tyler Durden and David Fincher hit the nail on the head with this film.
4560;this Blue Ray edition has the best.
4561;Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter give it their best shot amid the narrative disintegration.
4562;Regardless of what type of person you are, you will have a powerful reaction to what you see.
4563;Some movies are made to simply entertain and make money but Fight Club is one of those rare movies that will leave you pondering a few things.
4564;In this way, Fight Club is similiar to such classics as A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver.
4565;Most men will love Fight Club because, well, all men have a Tyler Durden inside.
4566;I'll bet you see some of yourself in the movie.
4567;spirited, though it certainly is the latter for much of the film, but because many people just don't get it.
4568;Most of these comments boil down to, It made fun of me!
4569;, in which case one may certainly be right.
4570;The film is thoughtful and violent on a much deeper level than quasi.
4571;philsophical fare like The Matrix, but it's ultimately optimistic.
4572;There's a lot of parody to the movie, but there's also a lot of serious social commentary.
4573;An eerie similarity in the 'resignation' scenes in both of these movies proves that point.
4574;The violence here is painful, that's true, but I much prefer the honesty of Fight Club's non.
4575;This is, again, the perfect companion peice to American Beauty.
4576;The first time watching this movie I was totally caught off guard, but I loved it.
4577;There's lots to love about this movie, from the fight sequences to the back stories and even the scenes without much plot.
4578;O yeah it also had a twist at the end which was unessasarily stupid.
4579;Others see it as discussion about the emasculation and alienation that men face in our modern culture.
4580;for me, the whole film can be seen as metaphor for the search for equilibrium.
4581;The entire film is about Jack's integration of these competing impulses, and it's also about how the entire world stuggles to deal with the same issues.
4582;on perfect as Jack integrates himself achieving peace and order, through the violence and chaos of shooting himself.
4583;It's very Zen, and I loved it.
4584;Best movie I've seen in years.
4585;Hands down Ed Norton is one of the most talented actors working today.
4586;He brings a film to a new level with his superb acting, even if the film itself may be lacking (i. e. Primal Fear, Rounders, and American History X).
4587;disc set the bar is set extremely high.
4588;The beauty of this film is that it is at its heart a romantic comedy.
4589;At its heart, this movie wants to make you laugh, and it constantly hits its mark.
4590;The jokes (often darker and darker as the film progresses) are fast and furious and the ending is not so much the narrartor overcomming Tyler, but realising that Marla (Love) is what makes his life worth living.
4591;The exploration of Nihlism, buddism, anacrchism are just diverting sidebars in what should be viewed as the funniest black comedy ever (ok there is Dr. Strangelove but what is so funny about the end of the world?)
4592;Fight Club is THE most original film released in the 21st Century thus far.
4593;Brad Pitt has shown us his best with a character that he was essentially born to play.
4594;Edward Norton is one of the most talented actors around and Fight Club only exemplifies this.
4595;This credit goes to a sharp script and an even better director, David Fincher has finally proven himself as a future legend.
4596;Rebuild us into something bigger and stronger?Many of the laughs are guilty laughs.
4597;edward Norton is a compelling actor, and the disc set really provides everything you would want.
4598;The commentary is useful and powerful.
4599;It's the kind of movie that really makes you think and better yet, it's a movie that you can watch over and over again.
4600;I'd also like to point out that Ed Norton was amazing!
4601;Meatloaf is pretty interesting as the bodybuilder who has grown [breasts] as a result of testicular cancer.
4602;surprise ending is sort of interesting, but can't make it up to you for sitting through an otherwise over.
4603;Great movie, fast shipping, and finally in blu ray.
4604;This is my favorite movie ever!
4605;Brad Pitt and his cray shirts win me over.
4606;I reccomend this to anyone who likes movies that end with a twist, this is the ticket.
4607;ass job of being a manly.
4608;I mean, it'd be great to see him in drag too, but I'm just fine without it!
4609;and then I remember seeing her in Harry Potter that summer and thought of how good she was there too!
4610;Great movie night choice., any night of the year, watch it!
4611;This is a Legendary Film .
4612;Cult movie once in life time .
4613;Well I love Chuck Palahniuk's work and this is an awesome transition from a novel to a film.
4614;Dialogue still intact, even though the story line is slightly altered.
4615;Actors succeed in bringing Chucks' characters to life and so does the Director in creating the world of Tyler Durden.
4616;Amazing book that leads to an amazing movie
4617;This is a movie with serious counter.
4618;It relentlessly criticizes the system, social norms, and popular beliefs.
4619;It achieves all that with a brilliant narrative style and clever dialogues.
4620;The plot, seemingly simple, delivers one of the best surprise twists at the end.
4621;This movie will remain to be one of the highest.
4622;rated films of all time and I suspect its popularity will grow even bigger with each generation.
4623;being the one that knows the film word for word and watching the one who doesn't know the rules is intense and exciting.
4624;Fight Club is an awesome movie.
4625;This film made a splash because it taps into modern man's inability to find a venue to properly express frustration and anger.
4626;When a friend told me that this was by far the best movie he had ever seen, I was quite skeptical.
4627;The underlying social commentary in this brilliantly written story/movie was truly fascinating and captivating.
4628;I found a great mix of humor, action, and creativity.
4629;I have since become a great fan of this work and others by the author of the book.
4630;I'd recommend this movie to anyone, anytime.
4631;rated (and misunderstood) film is one of the best films of the 90's.
4632;From the stylish, gritty, flashy direction of David Fincher (Se7en, The Game), to the career.
4633;high performances of Oscar nominees Brad Pitt, Ed Norton and Helena Bonham Carter, to the devilishly conceived story (very faithfully adapted from the brilliant Chuck Palahniuk novel), this is a film that should be in absolutely everyone's collection.
4634;the most often misunderstood facet of this film is its intention.
4635;It is a scathing, intricately woven social satire.
4636;And the score (composed by the Dust Brothers) is one of the most unique and effective you will ever hear.
4637;This is the definitive story of a true nihilist.
4638;Try it you may like it.
4639;Although you may or may not identify with the protagonist, if you are open, you will learn something about your self and possibly the human soul.
4640;The twist at the end is of course famous, it will make you want to watch it again.
4641;Fincher is the perfect director for this, just as he was for Seven, and he really knows how to get the most out of his actors.
4642;The editing skips and jumps in perfect synchronicity to the pulses and beats of the techno driven sountrack, and the flawless cinematography and production design combine to create a vision that seems plucked from the dark and twisted imagination of HR Giger.
4643;In short Fight Club is work of genius.
4644;if you think you can take a beating.
4645;I think it is one of the best movies ever made.
4646;Its one of those rare movies that must be seen twice.
4647;It arrived within 5 days in perfect condition.
4648;I was extremely satisfied with the speed of delivery and the convenience of the service.
4649;It is, actually, a film about the chaotic descent into madness and clarity by the main character.
4650;It is about the schism of personality that occurs not only with manic depressives or schizophrenics, but on a smaller scale with each and every one of us, every day, as we question our purpose, our reasons for fitting the mold when all we want to do is break free, and our intense and inward reactions to the immense pressures of culture and society.
4651;in this phenomenally directed film, we watch the main character, Jack, played by an intensely baggy.
4652;he meets the charismatic and unfettered soap salesman Tyler Durden, played by Pitt, and he returns to his condo to discover that his precisely coordinated IKEA.
4653;Thus begins the strange world in which men beat each other up seemingly just for the pleasure of it.
4654;tyler, with Jack always a few steps behind him, builds an underground network of fight clubs, where men come to test their strength and feel alive.
4655;It's a deeply funny, deeply thoughtful film about the roots of violence, and the possible need for violence amongst the displaced men of today's culture.
4656;or at least something that feels powerful.
4657;It taps into the rage men feel at being promised and denied a spot as a demi.
4658;rest assured, you'll be able to discuss and debate this movie with your friends for countless hours, and each time you view it, you'll find something new to contribute to the conversation.
4659;desirable Pitt (I call him Pockmark), as it now holds strong at #2 on my list of favorite movies of all time.
4660;David Fincher has created something truly stunning out of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, and the acting performances by all involved are hilarious, dynamic, utterly natural and completely absurd.

4668;Recipient was happy with this .
4669;Fight club is one of my favorite movies.
4670;Well done movie and the casting was perfect.
4671;Chuck's novel was depicted in a creative way that allows you to get into the mind of the lead character without any problem.
4672;It also has a great storyline, cinematography, and a GREAT ending.
4673;Some scenes are graphic, but this movie's flow and storyline more than makes up for it.
4674;One of the best studio movies I've seen in a long time.
4675;The book to movie translation has to be one the best translations ever done.
4676;See it, read it, and do it all over again.
4677;Watch the movie, and you will understand what I am talking about.
4678;I realize that this issue has been discussed to death already but it's important to understand something.
4679;it uses the strongest poetic imagery because it is covering an important topic.
4680;It's for those of us who watched Instinct and enjoyed the first part of the movie, but not the second.
4681;well made, well acted, well done.
4682;David Fincher made a great movie.
4683;the most important ingredient for me in awarding stars to a movie is that it was a realistic film.
4684;Look at some of the movies that I've given high marks to.
4685;Even 1997's Starship Troopers earns high marks.
4686;Because the director pulls you in with adult situations where the players all act like adults
4687;in Fight Club the acting is good.
4688;it even boarders on great.
4689;The twists and turns are unexpected and brilliantly executed.
4690;So taketh away from my experience and ability to walk away with an above average experience.
4691;fred Durst may have seen the Fight Club about 28 times, but I have and will see it just once.
4692;It was a good movie with fast moving action.
4693;fincher's resume is full of good movies.
4694;my expectations are, clearly, high.
4695;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton deliver thier best performances in this flawless epic.
4696;Wonderfully directed by David Fincher, Fight Club delivers delivers non.
4697;For those who have never seen it, this is a must watch movie.
4698;love the twistes in the plot.
4699;But because I'm a huge fan of Edward Norton I went ahead and bought this film.
4700;Everything is going well until a tourist to this groups comes in and shatters everything, this girl (played oddly by Helena Bonham Carter) and Edward Norton make a deal so they can share their support groups.
4701;The only person he has to turn to is Tyler, the man he met in the plane.
4702;After meeting up with Tyler, he stays at his Tyler's house and they start up a group that fights so they can get their tension out.
4703;FIGHT CLUB!This movie is very freaky, very funny, very violence, very provocitive, and very good.
4704;This movie reminds me of a Stanley Kubrick film.
4705;Edward Norton of course, is great as always.
4706;This is surely one of the most startiling films I've ever seen.
4707;This is going to be a cult film, I'm pretty sure.
4708;This weird critique of modern culture suceeds artistically.
4709;norton and Pitt are superb and so is Helena Bonham Carter.
4710;The music is interestiing and cool.
4711;Whether you take this as the portrait of an interesting psychotic break or go with the notion that people need violence in order to feel alive, this story provides a refreshing departure from traditional films.
4712;writing hilariously witty in some places and profoundly philosophical in others, and to top it all off probably the most innovative (albeit difficult to believe) surprise ending in film history cement Fight Club as a cult classic with a multi.
4713;layered, complex message that would make it perfect for a University student review essay.
4714;written script replay in your mind because they're just THAT memorable, but that its message is so timely, relevant and resonant to modern life with many people that it's still talked about today.
4715;exploratory discussion that to this day is still ongoing.
4716;I own many, and this one contains the most extra material including but not limited to extensive commentary, Fight Club paraphernelia, a couple hilarious PSA's and a cool music video.
4717;about classics of all time.
4718;pitt and Norton are superb in this movie.
4719;Watched it with my wife.
4720;a wild, wild ride of a movie.
4721;thought he did a god job!!
4722;Great acting, interesting plot, weirder than any of our lives will ever get yet universally honest.
4723;Fight Club is possibly the most surprising thing that has ever happened to me.
4724;While the subplot of two men starting an underground movement where anger and aggression is released through physical conflict IS present in the movie, Fight Club is a much more intricate web of human emotion.
4725;This is a very ugly movie, and yet, it is strangely beautiful.
4726;Director David Fincher is known for making cheerless yet compelling movies, and this is his finest.
4727;The weekly fighting sessions begin to attract more people, and this escalates to the point where the fighting actually begins to become an organized activity.
4728;Throw in a suicidal girlfriend, Meat Loaf, a twist ending, a barrage of innovative visual directing techniques, and the Pixies, and you have yourself one killer movie, without a doubt the best film of 2001.
4729;disk special edition version of Fight Club is possibly the best overall release to come from Fox EVER.
4730;The widescreen anamorphic transfer is flawless, the 5.1 surround is exceptional, and the features are.
4731;On a more comedic note, there's also some hilarious publicity material, and an outtakes reel.
4732;He begins attending sessions for terminally diseased patients speaking out.
4733;One day, he meets this very well dressed, well spoken, and handsome man named Tyler Durden.
4734;but the story's got so much hidden secrets.
4735;The movie will end leaving you in complete awe and you'd want to watch it again!The fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed.
4736;And the stylish directing of David Fincher, the genius behind Se7en, brings back the noir.
4737;ish grizzly theme of his previous and present films back to your own viewing pleasure.
4738;this movie is highly recommended.
4739;It is also a sardonic look at the American society and the mechanical agendas we keep day in and day out, working towards our ultimate goal which is the immortal sin: materialism.
4740;What could be more fun?Even though I'm a woman and this film literally slanders the female counterpart, I was able to look past that to see that the story does make a significant and amusing point in all its glorified madness.
4741;the camera work is creative, flashy and strewn all over the place, the story moving with the emotional adrenalin of its characters.
4742;none other than David Fincher could have done the movie justice with its dark, surrealistic mood and spectacular performances from its leading men.
4743;the picture has an awesome gritty grain to it.
4744;I'm quite serious when I say that this is the best movie of all time.
4745;NOTHING is more visually striking, involving and fast.
4746;It has ideas and talks about them.
4747;And then it goes and adds a psychological twist, that I think, does not negate the picture but adds one more layer.
4748;I can't begin to express my admiration for this film, so I'll say this(again): Nothing is as wonderful as this and I highly doubt that anything ever will be.
4749;Fight club is one of my favorite movies.
4750;I have seen it soo many times and can always watch it again.
4751;It is just a fun movie to watch.
4752;A dark sense of humor helps.
4753;But I think that it is good.
4754;It is also done very well.
4755;It is seldom that a movie comes along that leaves such an impact.
4756;This is why I believe that Fight Club is one of the best movies ever.
4757;The story is layered, and all elements to the story hold significance.
4758;Marla plays a much bigger part in the story than even Marla (and the audience) knows.
4759;The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions and begs to be viewed many times.
4760;Audience members may draw their own conclusion on Fight Club.
4761;Ebert thought this movie was silly, Berardenelli called it a modern day Clockwork Orange.
4762;Not everyone will understand, but the ones that do will love this movie.
4763;Nice package of the original movie with three commentaries and a good selection of special features that give the background information on the movie.
4764;Fight Club is one of the most important movies ever made.
4765;making wise, it is brilliant: Sharp slick camera work, well controlled computer effects, an original plot and most importantly, beautiful performances from a perfect cast.
4766;wise, the movie touched on the very basis of modern human existence.
4767;Anything that causes such applause and condemnation is glorious in my opinion.
4768;This is quite simply an excellent film with a plot which will quite simply knock you back and I recomend you watch it, this is one of bratt's best achievements to date, proving he isn't simply a man of muscle but truely can act and can do it well!
4769;fetched in my opinion, but it is entertaining and subtly funny.
4770;a great satire on modern american culture.
4771;superb on on every level.
4772;should have been awarded the Oscar for best picture of the year.
4773;clearly one of the best of the last ten years.
4774;Ed norton is the best in this Flik!
4775;The best description of the movie I can think of is this: Walter Mitty meets Apocalypse Now.
4776;Superbly acted by some greats.
4777;Norton, Pitt, and the the always wonderful Helena Bonham Carter (who is quite believable in her difficult role).
4778;gritty acting with a dark, well.
4779;written story that examines modern life.
4780;This movie is by far the best 1999 had to offer.
4781;every shot is perfect and meaningful to the story.
4782;but this is his masterpiece.
4783;Great acting, great screenplay, great concept, great musical score, and a haunting movie that will be remembered long after you see it.
4784;Fight Club is an intelligent, abrasive and complex story of a young man who's driven mad by the hollowness of his materialistic existence.
4785;this movie is constantly entertaining to me: the humor is sly, non.
4786;The technical achievements are first.
4787;The action sequences are exciting and cringe.
4788;The actors are entirely believable in their circumstances.
4789;the best thing about this movie (more so than the book its based on) was that it led me to re.
4790;assess some of my beliefs about success and achievements in life.
4791;This is a film unlike any film that I have ever seen before!
4792;the cinematography is Oscar caliber, and the performances are excellent!
4793;I think it comes down to the dark comedy and the strong script, coupled with excellent performances from Norton and Pitt.
4794;This is a cool world to experience, but I wouldn't want to live in it.
4795;the story seems perfectly traditional at first.
4796;Jack returns home to find that there's been an explosion in his apartment, so he calls Durden and eventually asks to stay at his house for a while.
4797;The two fight on the street and decide to recruit members and form Fight Club, believing that it's an expression of freedom.
4798;He enjoys letting his inhibitions go and listening to the members speak about their illnesses.
4799;He challenges the authority of his boss and stops worrying about his appearance and the latest IKEA catalog.
4800;He regularly shows up for work with fresh cuts and bruises.
4801;Jack finds that he enjoys his new image.
4802;fight Club is set in a gritty world and makes the viewer feel unclean while watching it.
4803;Fincher is good at creating unsettling worlds and this one is similar to those found in The Game and Se7en.
4804;fight Club contains a major twist and I won't reveal it for those who haven't ever seen the movie.
4805;Subsequent viewings are enhanced because you'll notice little details you may have missed the first time.
4806;It's clever how everything ties together.
4807;The ending annoys some viewers, but it works perfectly for me.
4808;The final sequence is set to one of my favorite Pixies' songs and is probably my favorite scene in the entire movie.
4809;i'm enjoying this project and got more out of Fight Club on yesterday's viewing than I ever have before.
4810;Above all things, it must be said that Fight Club is a very fun movie.
4811;It will probably be noted as an important cult film in the future, although I have to disagree with anyone who is predicting classic status.
4812;Director David Fincher has given us an effective thrill ride, to the point where approximately no one will care that the material could have risen to much greater heights.
4813;He has sacrificed the potentially fascinating nature of this story to the gods of MTV.
4814;All of the exuberant camera work and tricky shots that Fincher pulled off, while entertaining, do not amount to good directing because they are essentially meant to hide the film's material, not strengthen it.
4815;The film's cuts are moving so quickly and with such a breathless gusto that Tyler Durden's catchy quotes sound prophetic and brilliant, simply because our minds do not have the time to process them.
4816;It takes multiple viewings to realize how clich and nave Durden's wisdom actually is.
4817;a masterpiece adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's novel would have been a simultaneous ironic endorsement and searing indictment of the characters' ideals .
4818;The best way to treat this movie is to let the MTV.
4819;bred fanboys have their fun and just let it go .
4820;Our war is a spiritual war, our great depression is our lives.
4821;I thought it was just adolescence, but I still feel that way at 24.
4822;The federal government has pretty much waved the white flag on the war against drugs.
4823;And with the increase in multiple technologies we have everything at our fingertips these days.
4824;Violence for the sake of feeling like life has a challenge.
4825;Raised with the wool over our eyes by a society that would have us believe owning a yin yang coffee table makes you one step closer to perfection.
4826;Included in this masterpiece are: crazy plot twists, great action, wonderful plot and many more!
4827;I would definitely recommend this to anyone with some free time.
4828;I thought this movie would be another hollywood flick where you get a guy girls will drool over and he beats up poeple.
4829;wRONG!This movie is so much more than that.
4830;but it brings up a lot of good poins about how messed up our society is.
4831;This film is an almost perfect example of how to thwart convention in film.
4832;work to the 'herrings' throughout it allows you to be both entertained and challenged throughout.
4833;Fight Club is a excellent movie, with great acting, great effects and most important of all, a great story.
4834;Fincher shows how great movies are made.
4835;This is Finchers best movie by far and is very UNDERATED!
4836;It also shows the talent in Norton and Pitt.
4837;Its Edward Nortons 2nd best performance(American History X being 1st).
4838;I think that Everyone should see this movie more than once to actually get the story!
4839;TRUST ME this movie has everything to be a classic movie!
4840;I don't know where the story came from (I assume somebody somewhere must have written something) but the director, and Brad, and Ed and Helena turned it into a great movie.
4841;Kudos to the director, and Brad, and Ed and Helena.
4842;This was a beautiful flick.
4843;After the movie there is that chat of what really happened, and understanding it is what the fun part is.
4844;Words and sayings used in this movie are very clever and complex, but very intresting and fun.
4845;The ideas and thoughts put behind this movie keeps it very intresting to watch.
4846;If you have the time, watch the commentary, it will help it make more sense.
4847;This has become a well established cult classic and I hope it never fades away.
4848;Fight Club does an amazing job of anaylyzing the state of soceity and questions mans place in soceity through impressive visulas and witty dialouge.
4849;Fincher creates a fascinating look at the internal reality of a schizophrenic and the external reality of those who follow him.
4850;these people need to take a deep breath, count to three, and watch the movie over again.
4851;Fight Club is one of the best films I've ever seen.
4852;Beyond it being one of the finest novel.
4853;screen adaptations ever, it is simply an astounding film.
4854;What's interesting is that the film not only provides a counter.
4855;This helps him to confront death and despair in a tangible way, and appreciate the fact that he's alive, curing his insomnia.
4856;Something about Tyler is magnetic to the Narrator, and through a series of events the two come to live together, and create the eponymous Fight Clubs.
4857;to tell anymore would spoil the movie's many delights
4858;provoking, thrilling and consistantly entertaining.
4859;Fincher's direction takes major risks and constantly manages to succeed, and the thought that's been put into every frame is evident.
4860;The cinematography is excellent, the Dust Brothers music hip and appropriate, the writing stylized and snappy, capturing the novel's tone without being overly derivative.
4861;Fight Club is a masterpiece, the best Hollywood film in a very long time.
4862;Enter with an open mind, and you'll come out singing its praises.
4863;It motivates you to say: Once more to watch.
4864;Unique premise, Justified performances, Precise writing, unpredictable twists, and leaves you to take on a reality check, again.
4865;One part scathing social commentary, one part intro to abnormal psychology and throughout a work of genius, Fight Club is a must.
4866;to be driven by your heart, and inner compass or to be herded along with the rest of the sheep?
4867;Fight Club hones into this feeling and the fears that produce it, as a result the film, while geared towards a cult audience is a modern classic.
4868;In many ways the film is more effective than the novel.
4869;funny, cynical, satirical, a bit violent.
4870;love the look of the film, and the anti.
4871;marketing marketing, but the content is what makes it.
4872;satisfied life we live today.
4873;Up there with Taxi Driver on the Movies that changed my life list.
4874;the story of The Narrator in the film's first act is hugely compelling, an involving and eye.
4875;popping introduction into a properly original film world.
4876;the leaps in time and space are dazzling and allow for the creation of an unsettling and vaguley surreal comic.
4877;The novel he made this film from is stuffed with ideas and is structured around a dizzy pin.
4878;Cowards!See the film anyway, because the technical achievement of the film is enourmous
4879;Fight Club Is the most impressive movie that I see in my life, you even need to see this movie in slow motion.
4880;This is my favorite movie.
4881;Good price, quick shipping, killer product.
4882;As advertised, I got my fresh copy of the movie, and even quicker than expected.
4883;Exactly what I wanted, sweet!
4884;I first thank Chuck for writting this amazing novel.
4885;This movie is incredible from opening to credits.
4886;The one last thing I must include is that every time I have been to the theater to see Fight Club, the hipocritical audiance has laughed and very obviously loved the honest humor in the begining of the film.
4887;The simple realization that this movie is making fun of everone in the audiance.
4888;Look deeper and see the self realization we all need.
4889;This book is an opening to paradise as you see it!
4890;It was worth the wait!
4891;Weird, wonderful movie, great story, presented brilliantly with suspense building, layers upon layers of meaning that don't become clear until the end, and most of all terrific performances by Bonham Carter, Pitt and the extraordinary Ed Norton.
4892;Love the book and love the movie.
4893;I thought It was a great movie probably the best of 1999.
4894;materialist message came at just the right time.
4895;It's a complete joy hearing Ed Norton and Brad Pitt relive the film and show how much fun they had and how they really loved how the film turned out.
4896;the Film is a cult classic, it's violence and values grab america by the throat and demands attention.
4897;Taking the Book and making more sense out of it.
4898;This is one of my top fav films ever.
4899;If you don't claim your humanity you will become a statistic.
4900;I thought Fight Club was very well written, directed, and acted.
4901;there are so many little things that are in this film that are meaningful and for that, Fight Club is the most inventive, most brilliant, most creative film that I've seen by far.
4902;It's much more than that I guarantee you.
4903;overall, Fight Club is a surprising masterpeice that's funny, thrilling, and original.
4904;The defining film for the dislocated, young, generation of today
4905;What Fincher has crafted here is a brilliant and witty contemporary masterpiece using stunning visuals and hilarious irony.
4906;Without question, it is definitely worth it.
4907;outside of that 'Fight Club' was a daring art house movie and I am grateful that it finally came out in a medium that almost equaled what I saw when it first came out.
4908;Except for the great transfer, audio and extras.
4909;Anyone who has watched 4 year old boys in a sandbox knows that aggression determines who keeps the shovel.
4910;Given that caveat, it succeeds as entertainment because it doesn't try to entertain.
4911;Anyone who has watched 4 year old boys in a sandbox knows that aggression determines who keeps the shovel.
4912;Given that caveat, it succeeds as entertainment because it doesn't try to entertain.
4913;As far as making a statement, I give it no stars, but for entertainment value, it's a five.
4914;Every time I see it (three so far) I am equally amazed and amused.
4915;It's really over the top.
4916;Best brad Pitt movie of all time.
4917;Psychological thriller up until the last minute.
4918;Watch more than once to pick up the signs
4919;If you have any brain cells at all, it's easy to look past the violence and fighting and read between the lines.
4920;The commentary it makes about modern society is powerful and real.
4921;All the visual effects, sound, etc. of the movie are awesome as well.
4922;This is one of my favorite movies, and I'm a chick.
4923;Save it for when you're in a more philosophical state of mind.
4924;This film is strictly for the X box generation.
4925;Now that's advice worth taking.
4926;The first rule of fight club is that you love it.
4927;Bored insomniac meets wild charismatic salesman.
4928;It gives them both a high they have never experienced.
4929;You will want to watch it again and you will want to talk about it to someone irrespective of whether you think it is clever or peurile.
4930;And that is what entertainment is all about.
4931;Fincher again proves he is, by far, one of the great new visionaries of film.
4932;It's an action movie, a love story, a comedy, and a social commentary all at the same time.
4933;Nay sayers be damned, this is a superb film.
4934;this is the most unreal and amazing exploration of the real world ever committed to celluloid.
4935;Norton's hero, no name, big problems, shoots himself, brilliant.
4936;pitt's Durden, hard, fast, funny, evil, shoots himself, brilliant.
4937;Meat Loaf, has huge breasts, beats guys up, brilliant.
4938;David Fincher, makes it all look fantastic and move nicely, brilliant.
4939;Beyond the film itself the 2 Disc set has 3 commentaries and several special features.
4940;the performances by Pitt and Norton are Oscar worthy as is the film itself.
4941;Most of the important production materials from the 2.
4942;The acting was great and the story was original, and for that I give this movie 2 stars.
4943;I consider this to be an amazing movie and I will leave it at that since there are already so many great reviews out for this.
4944;This movie has an awesome premise and simply has a very surreal and eerie atmosphere to it.
4945;Its the story of a man who is ruled by his own posestions and must have everything perfect.
4946;He attends meetings every night so he has somewhere to go.
4947;Ontop of all that it is full of action scenes which get pretty gruesome.
4948;This is a top notch film and definitly warrants a purchace.
4949;This film is pure genius.
4950;Edward Norton is just amazing.
4951;It's his show, despite the top billing given to Brad Pitt.
4952;The first night I watch the movie, and the second night I watch with the excellent commentary with Norton, Pitt, Bonham.
4953;One of my top 5 favorite films.
4954;If you like dark comedy this is for you.
4955;It was totally not what I had expected, and the last 20 minutes of the film were simply amazing!
4956;This is by far Fincher's best work, ever better than seven, which was also a great film.
4957;Brad Pitt, who I despise, was really great as Tyler Durden, and Helena Bonham Carter was totally cool as Marla.
4958;Edward Norton, who made the poor American History X film, truly redeems himself in a fantastic starring role.
4959;The film also boasts a PHENOMENAL soundtrack by The Dust Brothers, and I highly recommend that you pick it up if you liked the film.
4960;I think that fans of the movies Roadhouse , and Lionheart will enjoy this, but be aware that this film is ten times more complicated than those two put together.
4961;Worthy of a second viewing.
4962;Fight Club, directed by David Fincher (Seven, The Game), is a visually stunning film with an incredible beginning and a wonderful cast.
4963;depressive named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), the greatest character of the film, who graces the screen in dollar dresses that were once worn at funerals and weddings.
4964;The beginning so is amazing, that if Tyler Durden were not in the film, this could have been an incredible film.
4965;The movie shows you why you don't need a woman in your life and embraces living life and escaping your shell
4966;Director David Fincher uses boldly creative filming techniques that produce an innovative, flashy movie that has the adrenaline rush of skydiving on speed.
4967;It combines valuable philosophical insights about our consumer society and its ills with outrageous foolishness about both the extent of those ills and the solutions to them.
4968;conceived twist hurts the credibility of what is otherwise a bold and daring cinematic creation.
4969;cinematically, Fight Club is bold, flashy, and innovative.
4970;Ed Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, and even Meat Loaf contribute performances worth watching.
4971;step meetings in order to make himself feel better.
4972;This is all in their benefit because it will set them free from their sad lives.
4973;A movie for my generation.
4974;Brad Pitt plays The Orange Duke to Ed Norton's static: Highly recommended, one of my favorite films of all time.
4975;Those who found something existentially important and life.
4976;hudson, NY asked and shall receive.
4977;we are emerging from an incredibly politically correct time, and the biggest victims of that period are the very people whose fathers victimised others: men in general, white men in particular.
4978;We've tested the water and it's warm.
4979;This leads to plenty of plot development and twists, in addition to.
4980;the philosophy and the assumed answers make this movie a pleasure especially for those searching for answers.
4981;Besides the violence you see in the title and advertisements, Fight Club is an insanely intelligent movie.
4982;nauseous aunt thought it was great.
4983;This is a masterpiece of drama and action, with a dark twist.
4984;It probes the depths of the human psyche, and does so in a very entertaining way.
4985;ray transfer is very good: of course, this movie is not so old that the transfer would be in doubt.
4986;Fight Club is a masterpiece of film making that challenges the viewer in a lot of ways, but never dares to present a moment that doesn't thoroughly entertain.
4987;Awesome movie especially for guys and people who like a twisted storyline.
4988;It has some wild cinematography, which may or may not have been needed, but whatever visuals it might have had are completely overcome by the message of the movie itself.
4989;It is funny, and initially feels like it could be the smash breakthrough brilliant film of 1999.
4990;It continues strong through the 2/3 mark, at which time audience members are on their seats with excitement at just how well done everything is. . . and then comes the crash.
4991;This is simply my favorite movie of all time.
4992;The actors are great, as well as the lines.
4993;It had a great impression on me.
4994;While it helps this group of men feel better and take back their lives, it eventually gets out of control and becomes something that Tyler calls Project Mayhem.
4995;I genuinely feel that they put all the effort they could into this release.
4996;And there's even a prank on it when you first turn on the movie.
4997;the sound and video are great.
4998;This is about as near to perfect as you can get.
4999;This is a great movie.
5000;Good plot line, sexy ripped Brad Pitt
5001;This is a must see for most!
5002;As for each of the elements: the actors are done very well, the music is absolutely perfect for this film.
5003;and perfect by itself on the soundtrack.
5004;But quite the contrary is true.
5005;That is all I can say about this one.
5006;, it is nice to see some work that has substance.
5007;Everything about this movie is new, from camera work to the plot, this movie rocks!
5008;The chemistry that these two have on screen is amazing and makes for an entirely enjoyable movie.
5009;One of the most original I have seen in a long time.
5010;It takes you through the life of average white.
5011;It really is a great movie for anyone troubled, or just looking for a funny, bruising, life.
5012;contemplating, movie that will have you in it.
5013;And has plenty of quotes and scenes you'll remember.
5014;Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter are fantastic together.
5015;There is actually some humor in it.
5016;The point is: Watch the entire film, let it simmer on your brain for a while, then make your opinon
5017;We watched it together yesterday and she really liked the collectors version.
5018;She has watched it twice since Christmas.
5019;by it, that they decided it wasn't there?This movie is the flipside of American Beauty, another great film in which anarchy is used as an escape from the drudgery of life.
5020;The answer may be quite simple: Beauty actually encouraged such behavior, appealing to the modern mantra if it feels good, do it.
5021;Because there's a message involved.
5022;What I don't understand is how a film like Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, is considered a challenging, thought.
5023;provoking classic, when it's even *more* disturbing and over the top.
5024;everything involved in this movie is top notch, from Edward Norton's bored, cynical narration to David Fincher's visually stunning direction.
5025;Indeed, this film has such a bizzarre energy, warping in and out of speed and giving new meaning to the phrase extreme close.
5026;There's enough here to please most people looking for something new in film.
5027;the most wonderful thing about this movie is the witty, literate screenplay by Jim Uhls, based on the equally stunning novel by the Vonnegut.
5028;Mixing humor, action, and subtle (and not.
5029;Wonderful for fans, this movie gives some wonderful behind the scenes material and stories.
5030;Viewed under the right conditions by the right person, this movie is an absolute treat.
5031;That said, I viewed this movie under optimal conditions and with an open mind.
5032;As a result, I stumbled upon one of my favorite films of all.
5033;brad Pitt and Edward Norton really strut their comedic stuff in this movie, as both are brilliant in their roles.
5034;Helena Bonham Carter and Meatloaf also manage to steal scenes throughout this perfectly cast film.
5035;The entire cast walks the comedic line brilliantly without ever becoming campy, a feat for which David Fincher can take a significant amount of the credit.
5036;Although Fincher's version neglects some of Palahniuk's fundamental vision (the ultimate futility of nihilism, in particular), he captures the overall spirit of the noval and makes the story linear enough that movie audiences can follow the character from IKEA.
5037;i have viewed the film with a number of other people, and my observation has been that people under 40 tend to view the film as brilliant and visionary, while people over 40 tend to take it too literally.
5038;Fincher gives tremendous insight into the details of making this film that are interesting and pertinent enough to captivate anyone, from the most serious film student to the most casual viewer of films.
5039;Pitt's one of Hollywood's golden boys and Edward Norton has always impressed me.
5040;It was a brilliant satire, of self.
5041;Their fun began with her convoluted interaction with Norton and took off after Norton moved in with Brad Pitt's character
5042;to that point it made me laugh several times.
5043;up to this point, one of the funniest, and most worthwhile portions of the film was to see Edward Norton beat himself up!
5044;It was hysterical, and got him out of his work with benefits, a little like Kevin Spacey's character getting out of his job in American Beauty.
5045;One of the great cult classics.
5046;This is the BEST movie I've ever seen.
5047;It has the best TWIST at the end that forces you watch it again.
5048;The Camera angles are unbelieveable and the song track is good, if you like the PIXIES it has the song, Where is my mind.
5049;It's full of Pharses and Quotes that are unforgetable and Eye opening.
5050;Forget whether or not this is a great movie .
5051;I really hope this sets a new standard for how movies are presented .
5052;a brilliant, hyperadrenal shotgun blast into the face of dead end, ant farm, postmodern american pseudo.
5053;this film puts the black into black comedy with some of the most mean spirited and hilarious comic touches of all time.
5054;seamlessly directed and flawlessly acted, fight club is a movie everyone should see.
5055;it most certainly is told from the perspective of the immasculated male, and is clearly targeted towards same.
5056;however, at the same time the film deftly pokes fun at just that kind of mentality, sometimes with subtlety, sometimes, quite frankly, with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer (including an undeniable and roaringly funny homoerotic subtext that made me laugh so hard i very nearly vomited).
5057;well, actually, this is a half.
5058;This film is beautifully shot, beautifully edited, beautifully produced, and very well acted.
5059;what I found most disturbing about the film, ultimately, was the fact that it seemed so completely certain that it had some kind of serious message to impart, something about masculinity and power and fascism.
5060;Combine this with the overall intensity of the movie and a handful of ingenious and clever effects and there doesn't seem to be much wrong with Fight Club.
5061;but in spite of this, it still manages one of the best twists of the year.
5062;all in all, Fight Club remains a very very good movie, but not a great movie.
5063;Since then I have seen the movie many times and I still love watching it.
5064;If you are not a Brad Pitt or Edward Norton fan, you still will be amazed at their performances.
5065;I recommend this movie to anybody.
5066;If you have not seen it you definitely should.
5067;The whole movie confused me and I loved it.
5068;Its one of those rare movies you want to see over and over because you keep learning more each time through.
5069;David Fincher ( Seven and The Game ) directs this vioristic captavating picture.
5070;Hold on to this film in the end it's a keeper.
5071;it seems to be the whole purpose of the movie .
5072;Helena Bonham Carter's performance was masterful, in an over.
5073;I've never been a Norton fan (except for in The Honeymooners) but I do respect his talent, and it shows here.
5074;This movie is very unique, from the characters to the plot twist.
5075;It includes a man who goes to support groups for entertainment, a soap making business, interesting characters and lots of fighting.
5076;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton do an excellent job with their characters.
5077;An occasional film gingerly will step on the toes of audience sensibilities.
5078;Yet, it is so unrelentlessly and quirkily original, so pathologically tantilizing.you will LOVE it.
5079;of castrated testicular cancer victims, to the mesmerizing and deftly parlayed 3.

5081;induced reluctance to communicate it, in RULE #1.
5082;ray!Looks great and the extras are great.
5083;it's even better when you read the book.
5084;It came out when I was in high school, its got amazing rewatch value and is ultra quotable.
5085;Masking this cluelessness was done very well and explained properly in the end.
5086;The two main characters were first rate and I really came to appreciate Brad Pitt for more than just a pretty boy after seeing this as well as 7.
5087;The movie is a superb piece in itself and the amount of effort that went into creating the final product is evident.
5088;minded, and has time to watch it again.
5089;brilliant story line, never gets old.
5090;Can't afford to blink while watching it because there are so many subtle flashes of imagery.
5091;He finds out that she and he both have a lot in common and they spend a lot of time together.
5092;While touring, he meets an enigmatic young man named Tyler and after a short conversation both become fast friends.
5093;Soon word gets around about their fights, and lots of young people also get interested.
5094;Both start spending a lot of time and both also make lots of money.
5095;Fight Club an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece.
5096;corporate message but how it delivers said message.
5097;Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree.
5098;Also a technically brilliant film that crafts a surreal and vicious atmosphere.
5099;One of my favorite movies of all time.
5100;I loved Fight Club from start to finish.
5101;Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are fantastic.
5102;the fight sequences are the best, most realistic I have seen and as well crafted as Raging Bull.
5103;Simply put, they look incredibly real.
5104;This one is totally absorbing.
5105;This is a movie that will keep you interested and invested from start to finish.
5106;This is a cocktail of it all and you're in for one hell of a hangover.
5107;The sarcastic, bitter, angry voice of Edward Norton that plays over the events helps a lot in driving the atmosphere of the film into it's audience, but it also adds to the humor of the film.
5108;So then why the slick visuals?
5109;Why the sly, cool tone?
5110;Nobody in the real world talks like these characters, and it seems pretty obvious that the film knows this.
5111;As I said before, David Fincher is a technical talent.
5112;Edward Norton's performance here is one of his best, as is Helena Bonham Carter.
5113;I definitely wouldn't call this his best performance.
5114;The music in this film works equally as well.
5115;The film just has a tremendous spirit, though I can't say that I actually enjoy watching it.
5116;This is also a very very homoerotic film, not just in the fight scenes but also in the way the male characters act around and toward each other.
5117;Their mannerisms, as well as their quick little quirks and playful flirtations, get pretty weird after a while.
5118;None of these things where what I originally loved about this film, however, and the film itself still works great as a comedy.
5119;The fight scenes in this film are also excellently choreographed and the gore effects in these scenes are wonderfully done.
5120;The final shot of the film may, at once, be considered by some to be an amazing and rebellious shot, but I laugh just thinking about it due to another very brief image in one frame of the shot that occurs just as the credits are appearing.
5121;so overall, Fight Club is still an entertaining film.
5122;It's funny, it's dark, and it provides a very honest depiction of mental illness that very few films have the balls to explore.
5123;Would I recommend it to everyone?
5124;I will say that it's most worthwhile audience would be people who are interested in films about insanity.
5125;It's one of the best ones you'll find, or at least one of the best ones that was released in the past couple of decades.
5126;The film has developed a strange cult following, reminiscent of the cult audience surrounding American Psycho.
5127;Watch it knowing everything that you know now about politics, science, religion, and humanity.
5128;Fight Club is the best movie of all time.
5129;It has two of the best performances ever by an actor.
5130;Edward Norton is my favortie actor of all time and Brad Pitt is one of my 15 favorite actors.
5131;They make this movie come alive so well.
5132;Henla Boham Carter is also very good.
5133;She is also one of my favorite actress.
5134;Suprsingly Meat Loaf did a good job,which was unexpected.
5135;The best stroy line and the best plot EVER!
5136;Probly the best job ever done by a director.
5137;David Fincher is the best director of all time.
5138;He is my favorite director.
5139;everything about this movie is great.
5140;All the features are great.
5141;I can watch it all day every day!
5142;This movie is a new cult classic that follows in the tradition of Pulp Fiction and Se7en.
5143;If you have seen the previews of this movie it is nothing like that, this is a thrilling action, drama, love, comedy.
5144;This movie is an instant classic in my opinion.
5145;It has everything that makes up a great movie (i. e., action, strong characters, great acting, a solid plot, and a twist ending).
5146;There's more to this movie than just fighting.
5147;Pitt and Norton do a fantastic job in this dark movie about an insomniac who inadvertently starts a movement.
5148;the external box visual , booklet,everything, and of course the movie!
5149;the defiant nature of the inner and much suppressed anarchist within all of us.
5150;The movie is a tour guide through the darkest aspects of nature.
5151;It is witty and cynical in a way that you will find yourself laughing at things that should never be humorous.
5152;But thats the beauty of it all.
5153;As Jack decends into madness, his vulnerability allows his alter.
5154;the captivating directing is raw and graphic but necessary to the film's charisma.
5155;The dialog is interesting, fluid, witty and intellectually stimulating.
5156;All in all, its master piece.
5157;It masterfully sustains suspense till the very end.
5158;This film was beautifully shot.
5159;The acting was superb
5160;The film is rather interesting and quite intriguing, though the issues the film raises are nothing new (anyone read Plato anymore
5161;There are a lot of fairly graphic hand to hand fight scenes, lots of language, and some sexual images as well.
5162;This is already my favorite movie.
5163;ray has definitely hit the spot.
5164;The opening to the movie is hilarious.
5165;some of it is interesting, but I expected more from deleted scenes.
5166;And that confrontation reminded me how great this film is, and I went online and bought it with my babysitting money.
5167;shirtlessness aside, Fight Club is the type of film that burrows deep into one's soul and wrenches out the Babylon.
5168;The story moves and has impact at every step of the evolution.
5169;Edward Norton is excellent in acting and narration.
5170;home mom/upper middle class community volunteer.
5171;My business husband and my movie/literature/anime/classics/science buff teen college student found it very worthy of discussion and watching as well.
5172;everyone should see this movie.
5173;The direction is amazing, as is the writing.
5174;It is worth watching at least twice in a row, I know I did.
5175;A new aspect will be noticed each time you watch it.
5176;The characterization is wonderful, as is the writing, and the very basis.
5177;Keep your eyes open, it's an experience.
5178;everything about it is great from the performances(pitts best since seven,norton adding another one to his resume, and bonham carter who is so darn sexy) to the great music to the best twist ending ever(forget sixth sense).
5179;there was a lot about this film that I loved.
5180;The fight sequences are gritty and at times gruesome.
5181;And let me tell you, NO MOVIE has affected my life quite like this one.
5182;The book is very well written and the movie is true to it, this is definately David Fincher's best so far, Pitt and Norton deserved Best Actor Nominations.
5183;Forget American Beauty, watch a real movie that tells it like it is.
5184;This movie proved to be unbelievably excellent.
5185;This was Brad Pitt's Edward Norton's best performance ever.
5186;David Fincher has never been so perfect.
5187;I read the book, bought the poster, read the websites, and took up smoking.
5188;This film is much more than that.
5189;Yes, this was the best film of last year, but to really apprectiate it you must understand it.
5190;The film is about the society we live in, the society that tells us to spend our money until we are happy, to gain as much as possible to be succesful.
5191;They do this because in a fight you are the focus of the attention and you are in control of your life.
5192;The men in this movie want to feel they have worth, that they have a power that can't be taken away.
5193;Fight Club is a very fun interesting movie that is nowhere near as violent as people make it out to be.
5194;There is actually very little fighting in the entire movie.
5195;Do yourself a favor, check it out, and you will see what an amazing movie it is.
5196;This movie has excellent realistic fight scenes, its a deep movie, and some of you people obviously can't see the overall genius of the movie.
5197;Excellent movie, no doubt about it.
5198;The first half of the movie is funny as hell.
5199;It was so good that i watched it with my sis,who generly doesn't like these kind of movie one of my all time favorites.
5200;If you won't cause of what u heard u are way wrong this is an American classic!
5201;If you enjoy movies, you'll love this.
5202;It is entertaining from start to finish and has a great twist
5203;The film shows true potential and is one of a kind.
5204;The acting is awesome, the direction is marvellous, the screenplay is ingenius and the editing is pefection.
5205;This film is a big hit with the critics and one of the few films that deserves all the praise it gets.
5206;fight Club is so awesome and so breathtaking that it is now ranking at #20 in my top films.
5207;For all of those (viewers and critics alike) who gave this future classic poor reviews because they couldn't see past the violent, and at times graphic content, be prepared to eat you words.
5208;This movie may seem like your typical guy flick, but within this well written and well acted film lies societal comments and stinging humour that invoke thinking and discussion long after the film has ended.
5209;This movie is ahead of its time and will be appreciated in the future, as do all great things.
5210;It is a journey into the human mind as well as the social mind.
5211;It is perhaps the most surprising movie I have ever seen and one you should just see instead of read about.
5212;the comedy, which was completely unexpected, is worth the price alone.
5213;Virtuoso performance by Pitt and pretty close to the book.
5214;And it shines while it moons us with its smart remarks and its egotystical masturbation.
5215;This film is a satirical masterpiece.
5216;child embraces from their local support group.
5217;It questions us about our directions, our goals, our passions.
5218;If we have all these dreams to become so great, to impact the world, to make a difference, than why don't we?
5219;Also included is a hilarious compilation of quotes from both opposers and likers of the film.
5220;I can't say I was much of a fan of Brad Pitt, but he shines here.
5221;This movie kicks some major ass.
5222;I love the three leads: Bonham Carter is amazingly good as the neurotic girlfriend, Edward Norton is a convincing tormented nerd, and Brad Pitt is an amazingly good lounge lizard.
5223;There are some excellent touches throughout, and Meat Loaf's role could make you choke with laughter .
5224;It gets a bit hard to believe, but wraps up convincingly enough.
5225;It is simply the best.
5226;I think the balance was beautifully done.
5227;One of the things that made the movie truly great was the balance of violence to the tender message of the human condition in this era of history.
5228;I liked this one better for it's continuity and cinematography.
5229;This disk is a beautiful work of art.
5230;Two disks, one with the main feature and the other with bonus materials.
5231;The main disk is in Dolby Digital 5.1, and the sound is great, thanks to the THX enhancments.
5232;Other than that it is great.
5233;David Fincher squeezes the maximum out of the cinematic medium in the briliant take on Palahniuks novel.
5234;notch, Fincher is the true star here.
5235;both cinematography and music are the tops, a true blend of the mediums, forming a beautiful visual surface.
5236;candy are matched by the excellent and mindtwisting content.
5237;Edward Norton and Brad Pitt give spectacular performances in this dark comedy action thriller.
5238;If you haven't seen this movie then you are missing one of the best movies of all time.
5239;This is nice piece to add to my small and very selective collection.
5240;this is an excellent movie for all good movie lovers.
5241;The product is very good as well, the blu.
5242;blowing trip to the dark side.
5243;For a movie that seems to be a violent from the title or on the first viewing, a second viewing picking up the points gives a chance to understand a the true esseance of the underlying message.
5244;OK, blend Matrix, Guy Richi, and Osama Bin Laden and you get a masterpiece?
5245;A funny comedy, not more.
5246;Fight Club is brilliant in the beginning with all that satire, but when it gets philosophical, I felt like I have seen this before.
5247;okay, lets get to the point.
5248;the first is that the message and tone and personality of the movie is that we are living in a comsumerist society and everything is manufactured including who we are.
5249;This is the best movie ever, and every man needs to see it.
5250;the hubby loves this movie, I just really love the boys in it!!
5251;The sound and visual effects were great.
5252;Brad Pitt is the best when it comes to brain twisted movies.
5253;I admire its satire on pretentious commercialism of America.
5254;Brad Pitt does a fairly good job with his masculine violence but Edward Norton has to the most talented actor in Hollywood right now.
5255;key acting which is quite naturalistic.
5256;Edward Norton deserved an Oscar nomination.
5257;fight Club is a great film which I will admit is a lovely satire on American values.
5258;We are drugged on our culture!
5259;Great Movie, with a great plot.
5260;Ed Norton and Brad Pitt kick ass in this movie!
5261;Good copy the blue ray version is good I like the movie it really shows you how s*** work we should start a fight.
5262;it represents the themes of the film quite well about the deceptive surfaces that we perceive all around us.
5263;Fight Club like a lot of Fincher's movies is an acquired taste but for those willing to join in and watch this combination of drama, action and satire, it's a worthwhile but bloody journey.
5264;Although not often discussed Fincher along with Chris Nolan is one of the few filmmakers who routinely challenges our assumptions about storytelling in films tackling a number of difficult stories, themes and manages to combine the artiness of someone like David Lynch into structured storytelling.
5265;ray for Fight Club looks marvelous with a sharp, detailed presentation dominated by the yellow/brown color scheme and lighting of neon that has dominated his films since Se7en.
5266;Blacks anre colors are solid throughout with nice skin tones that fit within the color scheme of the film.
5267;Audio sounds terrific with an immersively 5.1 lossless presentation.
5268;We also get multiple angle behind.
5269;scenes vignettes with commentary, deleted/alternate scenes, trailers/TV spots, PSA's, a music video, promotional and art galleries making this, perhaps, the ultimate edition of the film on home video.
5270;Fight Club is Highly recommended on Blu.
5271;I can't even describe how amazing it was and how it made me rethink a lot of my own personal opinions.
5272;The music performed by the Dust Brothers fits the style completely, consider trying out the soundtrack as well.
5273;to spend the rest of your night telling people what a great movie it was.
5274;This movie was one of the best ive ever seen.
5275;It had an extremely orignal plot, incredible acting, and a script that made you think if you really did have another side to yourself.
5276;The underlying mesage in this movie is great.
5277;Under all of the blood and gore is an extremely well done picture which can make you think, cringe and never forget this movie.
5278;I have seen this movie numerous times and it never gets old, Brad Pitt's performance is stellar to say the least .
5279;one of my all time favorite movies!
5280;Okay, so this is about as `guy' as guy movies get, but, hey, I'm a guy, and I loved it.
5281;as an adaptation of Palahniuk's novel, Fight Club fits the bill in a first rate way.
5282;naked men grappling, groping and twisting together.
5283;The feeling is that of extreme intimacy, which, thematically, works well, but also lends itself to more alternative lifestyle explanations.
5284;to me, the movie works better, in most ways, than the book.
5285;but, as stated earlier, this is a top notch adaptation of a mostly cerebral novel, and the cast and crew should pat themselves on the back in congratulations of a job well done.
5286;A movie that I've watched dozens of times, and expect to watch dozens of times more, Fight Club makes me cheer, makes me laugh, makes me cringe, and makes me almost like Brad Pitt.
5287;The directing is top notch, Brad Pitt gives one of his finest performances, Edward Norton rocks.
5288;The writing is superb, along with a great score.
5289;Plus this movie just gives you such an adrenaline rush just from watching it.
5290;At critical points, it grabs you by the shoulders and just shakes up everything you thought you knew, and once you think you figure it out again, there it goes and shakes some more.
5291;Its totaly twisted and rocks.
5292;One of the best movies out and you can't beat blue ray right now!!
5293;Great twist in the movie!!
5294;One of the best movies ever made.
5295;Entertaining with lots of plot twists.
5296;one of those movies you'll discover all your friends have all seen and loved for years
5297;one might still raise that obejction, but a second viewing (on Blu.
5298;Further, what is hidden up to that point is thematically and psychologically consistent with the rest of the story.
5299;this is a film you have to experience and absorb on your own.
5300;it is absolutely /not/ about the (presumed) pleasure men take in beating up each other (though the title unfortunately suggests that).
5301;It is, as most great American films, an attack on American society and values.
5302;Fight Club will someday be recognized as one of /the/ great American films.
5303;navigate BD I've yet viewed.
5304;although the women do enjoy brad pitt in this movie.
5305;overall this is a cool movie, it makes you wonder if this could happen to you.
5306;Deleted scenes and funny commentary by the Fincher, Pitt and Norton are my favorites.
5307;, the movie is visual perfection.
5308;Fincher films this creative and intriguing story in a such a way that it combines biting narrative and chaos.
5309;and you see his life, almost too.
5310;normal life that is, and the message is clear: we all live single.
5311;i won't get into the storyline (you can read a summary somewhere else), but if you indulge in great acting (Norton is phenomenal), inappropriate humor (which just makes it more hilarious), and filmmaking that is just hands.
5312;down beautiful, Fight Club, regardless of all the invalids that didn't like the movie because they didn't get it, is one of the best films you can ever experience.
5313;He's about my age
5314;Like me, he wonders if it all means anything.
5315;They upset the applecart, and together, all three end up forming a strange triangle that will lead to a darkly comedic world of mischief, mayhem, and .
5316;asks Durden, and he's right.
5317;Our great war is a spiritual war.
5318;Our great depression is our lives.
5319;It is a means of providing that great test of character in miniature.
5320;In it, Fight Club evolves into a full.
5321;even people who did not understand Fight Club could sense something powerful in it.
5322;base and largely negative review that at least grudgingly acknowledges the film's solid cinematic technique.
5323;disc set, with lots of goodies .
5324;and this is by far the most important point .
5325;we needed something to give us direction, to unite us in a common cause, to develop our character as a generation.
5326;Every 10th year anniversary blu.
5327;what can i say it's bold , intense , imaginative , original , enteraining uuummmmh i definitely think it's a classic and one of Brad Pitts better roles FightClub is a little bloody and violent at times, so this film is for adult only having said that i must say it's worth the journey, a must have laterz folks.
5328;This is such a steal.
5329;Such a fantastic cult classic.
5330;Kind of a twister, but exciting every time.
5331;This is, without any doubt, the best film made since, well, probably Seven.
5332;But what we'll never get is such a complete, perfect package.
5333;But the thing is, if you love the film you've already got it.
5334;I don't really plan on joining the intense debate surrounding this film about it's value,because I think that the debate itself is the greatest testament there is.
5335;great art can,and should be provocative,and challenge our views on things,and in these homogenized,P. c. times films like Fight Club that come out swinging and go out on a very long limb in the spirit of free thought are of tremendous significance.
5336;it has a stellar cast:Brad Pitt,rugged anti.
5337;hero charisma personified,Ed Norton,the best pure actor of his time,and Helena Bonham Carter,blasting free of her Merchant/Ivory corset with abrasive vigor.
5338;director David Fincher,the visionary wunderkind behind Alien 3 and Seven presents the hallucinatory smart.
5339;case and two discs full of goodies,including special effects sequences,art work,tv spots and illuminating commentary by the director and cast.
5340;highly recommended to fans of the film,and those who like to watch something that actually makes them think and feel.
5341;FIGHT CLUB is one of my favorite movies of all time.
5342;great acting, great cast, great story(very inovative).
5343;i recomend you to see FIGHT CLUB for yourself, i guarantee youit will be one of your most memorable movies you'll ever see.
5344;One of the best movies.
5345;This movie is pretty crazy the first time you watch it.
5346;But really good from beggining to the end.
5347;A lot of twists in the movie.
5348;Really great movie, DEFINATELY check this movie out.
5349;This is one really quirky movie with some really great acting.
5350;I really don't want to say to much to avoid giving away the plot but if you like movies that leave you wondering what the heck is going on right up to the end
5351;Wow, was I misled by reviewers on this.
5352;Fight Club is one of those rare, precious movies that has the power to rachet up your consciousness to a new level .
5353;Okay, we'll give you a social promotion out of kindergarten.
5354;This is the timeless, universal challenge of every human who ever lived, spirit trapped in flesh, learning to ride rather than fight the suffering and thus to live exuberantly every moment.
5355;As such, it has a lot of interesting things to say about bonding, identity and social standards.
5356;Because of this, I found the first half of the movie absorbing and witty in a dark kind of way, full of grim humour and cutting observations.
5357;I didn't know, and I got the impression that the movie didn't know, either.
5358;the acting is actually quite good, and a _Sixth Sense_ type plot twist towards the end goes a long way towards redeeming the middle portions of the film but doesn't quite manage it.
5359;The first disc contains the movie with fun stuff like the commentary tracks (FOUR .
5360;count 'em, FOUR commentary tracks) and dubbing in French (watch part of this just to see how great dubbing is these days), and the second disc features tons of engrossing stuff like behind.
5361;scenes featurettes, a music video, storyboards, trailers, and much more.
5362;Anyway, i would recommend this to anyone who is intrested in artistic film making and the depths of the human mind.
5363;All they do is deliver witty (but uninspiring) dialogues.
5364;Not very good, I think.
5365;He's here to Jack his life!!!
5366;Tyler Durden is a bigger, larger.
5367;He could easily steal any one of Bond's potential bed.
5368;up and dump the whole Because I choose to.
5369;You will develop a liking for red leather.
5370;You will start sizing people up everywhere you go.
5371;One of the better mainstream movies to have come out of Hollywood in recent years.
5372;This is an excellent movie, arguably one of the best movies ever.
5373;There's moments of comedy, romance and action, as well as excellent twists and turns in the plot.
5374;The movie itself is very influential and the film itself is quite visually stunning.
5375;I recommend it to anyone.
5376;ed Norton is turning out to be one of our most gifted thespians.
5377;Fight Club is an awesome film already, but this version comes with loads of extras.
5378;Great movie and even better special features for a true film fan.
5379;Now I bought this for the movie great as always, but I would have loved for it to have some extra content being the 10th anniversary edition.
5380;What they think of the movie after all these years and how it's affected them and their careers.
5381;Yet, in an exception to my personal rule, this movie is so incredibly well.
5382;made that it easily vaults onto my favorite movies ever list.
5383;minor Spoiler Alert: This is a movie with a twist ending.
5384;but in this case that is a good thing!
5385;The film is so deep on a sociological, physical, and emotional level that you'll almost feel a little wiped off from thought after viewing.
5386;Norton and Pitt provide a nice compliment to each other, while Helena Bonham Carter is interesting in a role that actually has much more significance to the film than one might originally perceive.
5387;Years later, I watched it again (this time from the knowing perspective) and was still blown away by its deep themes and interesting concepts.
5388;I could probably watch it again and still catch new things.
5389;It is, in fact, by far one of the most unique and eccentric films that I have ever had the pleasure to witness.
5390;And a true pleasure it undoubtedly was.
5391;This is a film that sets about redefining the style of filmmaking
5392;Every moment, visual, line, and character is a forward leap in filmmaking that never fails to inspire and impress.
5393;first of all, before you ever realize how psychologically deep it is, you'll find it hilarious.
5394;With great attention to the idiosyncratic clash between civilized culture and the counterculture that opposes it, Fight Club satirizes every institution to great depth.
5395;It is a story and a set of characters that pulls you into a new world and makes you seriously question the one that you have lived in for all of your life.
5396;Edward Norton is always great, but offers a multi.
5397;faceted performance that rivals his more appreciated works.
5398;Brad Pitt is perfect for the role
5399;and that's what makes her great.
5400;The direction is ambitious and enthusiastic, both heavily to the film's credit.
5401;By being so eccentric, the direction obviously sets and then expands upon the mood from the opening credits to the very last shot.
5402;arguably one of the greatest concluding shots in film history.
5403;and so all of this culminates into what has now become one of my all.
5404;There are just so many great ideas offered, so many interesting characters and perversely fascinating images, and moreover such a psychologically profound story that one cannot help but become enthralled with this masterwork of new age filmmaking.
5405;Fight Club stands as one of the most unique and inspiring films of the 90's.
5406;It certainly deserves your attention and respect.
5407;This one of the best movies I have seen in recent memory.
5408;The movie, unlike what the title displays, is much more than fighting.
5409;Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were absolutely brilliant.
5410;Fight Club keeps the audience on its toes, with its many changes and variations.
5411;If you like movies that will mess with your mind, then I recommend you check out Fight Club.
5412;Furniture from Ikea, colorful ties, support groups, big breasts, small breasts, xerox, aviator sunglasses (pink), and all of these come to an end in an underground boxing club.You fight, you become free, your teeth gets knocked out, you're a hero.
5413;Fight Club is really a simple, albeit captivating, story of one man's journey to find himself.
5414;In the process, he has to fight a lot of demons .
5415;It's an indulgent work of beautifully shot violence!
5416;It's a work showing great promise and brilliance with a cop.
5417;Just scan through a few of the reviews and you'll see these and many other opinions and interpretations of this movie, all of them strong in their conviction that they are right.
5418;Some of the greatest works of art inspire this sort of reaction.
5419;i am willing to weigh in on the side of this being a great work.
5420;I found it captivating, inspiring, and chock full of personal significance.
5421;For me it was a movie about beating complacency and finding how you are most alive, not sweating irrelevancies and getting to the heart of what you find fulfilling.
5422;Meanwhile, she moved into my building and then broke up with me and soon was dating one of my roomates.
5423;This really helped me relate to the message that no one's just gonna give you something, you gotta do something yourself.
5424;I contemplated this as I lived a life of single.
5425;With Fight Club, David Fincher was able to put on screen what is probably the most powerful and hypnotic social satire of the 90s.
5426;Fight Club is a noteworthy exception to this.
5427;As a matter of fact, this movie asks the viewer to think.
5428;The sincerity of the movie is in this
5429;Brad Pitt gives a somewhat surprisingly excellent performance, and Edward Norton is absolutely fantastic, proving again he's probably the best young American actor today.
