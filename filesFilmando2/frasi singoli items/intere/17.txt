I:8440;1;this film boasted much talent, but I bet the one you remember best is Bette Davis.
I:8440;2;In this film, she played an aging but still extremely talented actress, which wasn't a stretch.
I:8440;3;There was a whole lot of talent in this film.
I:8440;4;Newcomer, I presume, same as her character.
I:8440;5;"I've seen Audrey Hepburn in one film, her debut in Roman Holiday, and she was ""the talent."""
I:8440;6;A deliberate contrast, you see, because I believe she'd eventually steal Bette Davis' man and her job.
I:8440;7;Not new, okay, but fine.
I:8440;8;We've got the talent, and they can play their roles easily enough just by remembering similar experiences.
I:8440;9;Perhaps no film has been more lauded than All About Eve , the delightful, Oscar.
I:8440;10;winning, 1950 dramedy starring Bette Davis.
I:8440;11;Joseph L. Mankiewicz's script is brilliant and witty, his direction unmatched.
I:8440;12;Yet what elevates All About Eve above most other classics is its unmatched cast, led by the simply magnificent Bette Davis.
I:8440;13;Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill, and George Sanders also turn in excellent performances, while Anne Baxter skillfully and subtlely plays the snakey Eve.
I:8440;14;And if nothing else, see the film for the brief but hilarious turns by Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe.
I:8440;15;Every classic film fan should know all about All About Eve .
I:8440;16;Scene: Rich and talented people talk so damn witty and sharp tounged you wish real life was this crass and spicy.
I:8440;17;Baxter in turn does everything to steal Davis'life and friends and stage roles.
I:8440;18;Thank heavens mankiewicz never shows us Baxter's performance and he leaves it up to the imagination.
I:8440;19;perfect film and the perfect message for everyone who thinks life isn't fair this film let's you know it's not supposed to be!
I:8440;20;normally, i don't favor Bette Davis, but in this film she gives one stellar performance.
I:8440;21;what a great ensemble of actors assembled in one film.
I:8440;22;"this film was voted ""best picture of the year"" at the academy awards ceremony, and deservedly so."
I:8440;23;it seizes the viewer's attention and maintains it throughout.
I:8440;24;This is truly one of my favorite classic movies of all time.
I:8440;25;bette Davis was robbed of the Best Actress Oscar that year.
I:8440;26;this movie succeeds on all levels .
I:8440;27;Thelma Ritter, as Bette's companion, is a whoot, with lines witty enough for even today's audience to relate to.
I:8440;28;dramatic as Eve, has her moments when you want to just smack her!The definitive classic, from one of the classic's most definitive stars!
I:8440;29;All About Eve keeps the status of classic mainly for two reasons: an excellent screenplay and magnificent and unforgettable performances.
I:8440;30;The movie is entertaining from beginning to end, each scene presents great dialogues, the characters have huge depth, and if someone asks for more, Marilyn Monroe appears in a small role.
I:8440;31;All About Eve is recommendable for those who enjoy good stories and classic films.
I:8440;32;Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 6 time Oscar winning film is my pick for one of the best black comdies of all time.
I:8440;33;"It is one of the wittiest and most well paced comedies of all time as well (Though ""His Girl Friday"" is up there as well)."
I:8440;34;To me, a good comedy is one that has wit, charm, and of course is actually funny.
I:8440;35;Everyone in this movie acts perfectly alongside each other.
I:8440;36;George Sanders is just great as Addison De Witt, the man who brought Eve and Margo together.
I:8440;37;He also happened to win an Oscar for best supporting actor.
I:8440;38;And the rest of the supporting cast is terrific also.
I:8440;39;Thelma Ritter, Celeste Holm, and there's even room for Marilyn Monroe to make her first screen appearance!
I:8440;40;Mankiewicz, to me was never able to make a film as wonderful as this, and will always remain to me as his best film.
I:8440;41;Here we have a well thought out tale of intrigue, greed, envy, and just pure hyperbole as we get a lesson in how to success in theater with out trying (or trying to hard).
I:8440;42;And a few moments of pure melodrama (Davis' love life or lack of it).
I:8440;43;Funny, it took a movie to give wide scope to this little slice of Broadway life.
I:8440;44;All About Eve excels on so many levels it's hard to keep track of them all.
I:8440;45;It won eight Oscars and was nominated for 14 (a record that wasn't tied until Titanic ).
I:8440;46;seeming young ingenue slowly worms her way into an older actress's heart and takes her career away from her is now fifty years old but is as fresh as if it were filmed yesterday.
I:8440;47;The performances are outstanding across the board, and feature Bette Davis as star Margo Channing, Anne Baxter as usurper Eve Harrington, Celeste Holm as Eve's best friend, Thelma Ritter as Eve's live.
I:8440;48;This is a film to treasure and to enjoy over and over.
I:8440;49;I'm a huge classic movie fan.
I:8440;50;I love the glitz and glamour of the 30's and 40's.
I:8440;51;the mannerisms, the clothing, the Trans.
I:8440;52;Eve Harrington is such a fabulous villain because she is so very real.
I:8440;53;she just wants your life.
I:8440;54;Mankiewicz was an incredible writer .
I:8440;55;This screenplay has to be one of the most clever, barbed, and literate of the mid.
I:8440;56;George Sanders is delicious (as ever)as the classy, superior, cobra.
I:8440;57;Marlowe is appropriately naive, but Ms. Holm is brilliant, as the well.
I:8440;58;"heeled, Vassar grad who is far from the simple ""happy housewife"" she seems."
I:8440;59;I love just about all of her movies.
I:8440;60;In other words she know her work very well and would not just take any script.
I:8440;61;i love this movie,and Betty Davis was one of My fathers favorite actress!
I:8440;62;Brings back some great memories!
I:8440;63;"As my review title would suggest, this movie is all about the dynamic acting talents of Bette Davis
I:8440;64;If she had done no film other than `All About Eve' she would still go down in history as one of the most iconic film actresses of all time.
I:8440;65;This singular performance alone ranks as one of the greatest (I believe it falls in around number 5 according to Premiere Magazine) and rightfully so.
I:8440;66;As Margo Channing (no, Davis doesn't play Eve) Davis is extraordinary, barreling through every range of emotion with stamina and grace.
I:8440;67;Young Eve Harrington will do anything to get a shot in the movies, and when she is introduced quite unexpectedly to the famous Margo Channing it seems that she may get her chance.
I:8440;68;Anne Baxter is splendid as Eve and George Sanders (who won the Oscar) is superb as Addison DeWitt, the critic who supports Eve's rise to fame.
I:8440;69;"the actors don't have to do all the work on their own though
I:8440;70;Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz adapts Mary Orr's `The Wisdom of Eve' with wit and class, serving up a delightfully entertaining film from start to finish.
I:8440;71;My wife, who has testified plenty of times to loathing films made pre.90's absolutely loved this film, so much so that we watched it a second time the following night.
I:8440;72;It brilliantly balances the need to be important with the need to be entertaining.
I:8440;73;There are few films that can match `All About Eve' frame for frame, and that alone solidifies its very necessity.
I:8440;74;One of Bette Davis , great films , Personally, It is my favourite of that era .
I:8440;75;But main the transfer is excellent , it looks like it was yesterday , I wish more companies use the , Book format or Digibook is the correct name , The cover speaks for itself .
I:8440;76;Fans of the greats , this title is a must .
I:8440;77;This is the rare perfect combination of an excellent script, and a great director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, (who both wrote and directed,) and an unmatched cast.
I:8440;78;a fascinating look at the New York theatre world, the film concerns the conflicts of an ambitious young actress, (Anne Baxter,) and an established star, (Bette Davis.)
I:8440;79;This perfect gem of a movie is a high point in the careers of everybody involved.
I:8440;80;an insightful and literate script, top.
I:8440;81;notch performances and a first class production resulted in the film winning several well.
I:8440;82;One of the great films of all time.
I:8440;83;this movie has something for everyone.
I:8440;84;All About Eve is one of those classic films that you will never forget.
I:8440;85;Like Citizen Kane or Gone With the Wind, you are left breathless at the talented cast, superb direction and magnificent screenplay.
I:8440;86;the film begins with Eve Harrington receiving an award for best actress.
I:8440;87;She is surrounded by all of her friends, but none of them seem enthusiastic for her, and the rest of the film tells you why.
I:8440;88;The story, written by director Mankiewicz, is lots of fun and the cast .
I:8440;89;"the film's premiere, and its winning Oscars, a Holiday Magazine Award and a Look Magazine Award
I:8440;90;The second commentary features Celeste Holm, director Mankiewicz's son (being painfully candid about his father), and Kenneth Geist, the director's biographer.
I:8440;91;"The emphasis on the second track is how life imitated art: Bette eventually married Gary Merrill, her film husband
I:8440;92;These commentaries, along with the AMC Backstory, are really great.
I:8440;93;If you love this film, you will thoroughly enjoy these informative and fun behind.
I:8440;94;The film can be seen in English, French or Spanish, and subtitles are available in English or Spanish.
I:8440;95;"This is one that really deserves the genre classification ""classic."""
I:8440;96;I've heard about it for many years, seen clips of it, mostly of some of the best lines Bette Davis ever had, and been aware of the general story line.
I:8440;97;It was worth the wait.
I:8440;98;She's very quiet and self.
I:8440;99;next thing you know, Eve has become Margo's right hand, sort of social secretary, dresser, maid and what.
I:8440;100;And believe me, he knows.
I:8440;101;one relatively small part sparkles in this movie.
I:8440;102;Miss Casswell, starlet looking for a break, is played by Marilyn Monroe.
I:8440;103;"Remember this is 1950
I:8440;104;Still, she does a great Dumb Blonde imitation.
I:8440;105;Bette Davis had said many a time she should have got the Oscar for it.
I:8440;106;But the film was good .
I:8440;107;Oh yes the music sorce is wonderful also.
I:8440;108;ALL ABOUT EVE is an amazing film whose story stands the test of time.
I:8440;109;But the class and A++ production that went into this film luckily makes it still deliver a wallop.
I:8440;110;Most of this credit goes to the writing and the superb acting.
I:8440;111;But with this movie she certainly earns the status.
I:8440;112;She holds back here and gives the character strength and vulnerability at the same time.
I:8440;113;For me this performance is the most raw Bette has ever been on film and through it her talent and star power shines.
I:8440;114;The entire cast holds their equal with her, especially Anne Baxter.
I:8440;115;But take it from me this film more than benefits from the enhancements blu ray provides.
I:8440;116;Luckily the combination of the soft focus scenes and the intense crisp scenes that pop off the screen is seamless.
I:8440;117;To watch the parties and wardrobes and look at the dresses and fur coats down to each gems sparkle is beautiful.
I:8440;118;Is the blu ray a worthy investment.
I:8440;119;This film has been handled with loving care.
I:8440;120;There is frequent background noise and dialogue is always crisp and clear.
I:8440;121;We are presented here with a pristine blu ray presentation of a film classic.
I:8440;122;A classic whose message and story is still strongly relevant today showing the lengths to which people will go to gain star status.
I:8440;123;This was my favorite of the Betty Davis movies I watched to do my paper.
I:8440;124;Will be watching it again!
I:8440;125;but has there ever been a more brilliantly written backstager/backstabber film?
I:8440;126;Hard to imagine Claudette Colbert in the role, but Bette Davis, in her last truly great film, (note: she made some great characterizations later on, just not in great films) and in the role that she and she alone was born to play.
I:8440;127;the sterling supporting cast is spot.
I:8440;128;in many ways, this very may be the film that ruined her career, so perfect is she in her role.
I:8440;129;this is prime Davis, circa 1950, yes, but most importantly it is shatteringly clear script wrting at it's tightest, finest and most superb.
I:8440;130;A brilliant essay on the theatre and those that inhabit it (or want to).
I:8440;131;Wants her part in play and gets it.
I:8440;132;This is a fantastic movie that is packed with zingers and witty dialogue that crackle with brilliance.
I:8440;133;marilyn Monroe is a hoot as Miss Caswell, and with a historical perspective they obviously didn't have back then, downright eerie.
I:8440;134;Anne Baxter is completely convincing as Eve Harrington.
I:8440;135;"Discovered Celeste Holm while watching ""Broadway: The Golden Age"" and had to see this movie."
I:8440;136;This Is Simply One Of The Very Best Pictures Of All.
I:8440;137;The superlative writing, the ascerbic, cynical wit given to so many of the lines of Davis and also George Sanders (who plays Addison De Witt, the critic) is what really makes this picture shine so brightly.
I:8440;138;"like voice
I:8440;139;It's a truly memorable movie.
I:8440;140;It won a bunch of Oscars, including Best Picture, and rightly so.
I:8440;141;an aging actress, a young and beautiful wannabe, the actress' entourage, and the drama over how one intertwines with the other.
I:8440;142;The resulting fireworks, and the enjoyment for the audience, have seldom been matched!
I:8440;143;See it in it's catty, uncut, fully restored glory.
I:8440;144;This classic film is Bette Davis' masterpiece.
I:8440;145;She is absolutely right on target as the aging theater legend being threatened by an up and coming young actress.
I:8440;146;Bette just REVELS in this juicy role.
I:8440;147;As the young actress, Anne Baxter is stunning.
I:8440;148;What a fine actress she was!
I:8440;149;George Saunders is wonderful as the acerbic theater critic, and Thelma Ritter gives a bravura performance as Bette's secretary/dresser/confessor.
I:8440;150;This movie is filled with fine acting and witty dialog.
I:8440;151;It really makes you feel that you are part of that wonderful theater world .
I:8440;152;If I could I'd give it ten stars!
I:8440;153;Beside having so little Marilyn Monroe All About Eve was a wonderful picture.
I:8440;154;It was worthy of its Academy Awards, every minute was enjoyable.
I:8440;155;You can always put that award where your heart ought to be.
I:8440;156;Classic lines, classic script, classic actors.
I:8440;157;This is the movie where I learned that one smartly phrased quip could chill a person to the bone.
I:8440;158;bette Davis proved that she hadn't lost her step and holds her ground with a classic ensemble cast that garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations and won six including Best Picture.
I:8440;159;This is the ULTIMATE film to watch.
I:8440;160;The story sums up my whole work experience with her and her co. hort.
I:8440;161;I sure hope she watches it.
I:8440;162;All About Eve is perfect in every way.
I:8440;163;Once you have seen All About Eve you will know it is true.
I:8440;164;My favorite actress is Bette Davis and she is exceptional in this film.
I:8440;165;Anne Baxter is also great.
I:8440;166;As the story always goes.
I:8440;167;Betty Davis gives one of her signature performances and it's great to see Marilyn Monroe in her first feature role.
I:8440;168;Great character study start to finish.
I:8440;169;This is a classic (hold onto your seat belts, it's gonna be a bumpy ride).
I:8440;170;I consider this Bette Davis's finest role.
I:8440;171;The film is a masterpiece!
I:8440;172;Its perfect cast (with special praise to Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, Celeste Holme, and Thelma Ritter) works as a skillful ensemble, ensnared in Eve Harrington's devious fight for Broadway stardom.
I:8440;173;The dialogue is sharp and witty, the repartee worthy of Noel Coward.
I:8440;174;The film is wry and sparkling, funny and biting, a total gem.
I:8440;175;here too is a chance to see a youthful Marilyn Monroe deliver a consumate portrayal of the blond bombshell, clawing for an acting position.
I:8440;176;"Surely one of the greatest and most accomplished films of the 20th Century was ""All About Eve."""
I:8440;177;Produced and released precisely halfway through the Century in 1950, the film is a classic of awesome proportions and deservedly earnt 14 Oscar Nominations (the most ever for a single film) and won six.
I:8440;178;star cast and some of the most intelligent and witty dialogue in movie history, this film is without a doubt a classic in its genre.
I:8440;179;It simply is a black and white motion picture masterpiece that saw Bette Davis at the pinnacle of her career and also gave a worthy screen debut for a bright new actress who would go on to become a legend in her own right, and earn her title as the most famous screen actress in history.
I:8440;180;Eve tells her tragic life history and soon worms her way into Margo's life.
I:8440;181;She appoints her to live with her as a sort of assistant, and soon the pair become great friends.
I:8440;182;She's pushing on into her 40's and new, younger flesh is coming up and giving her a ride for her money.
I:8440;183;it's not hard to see why this film is such a classic and won so many Academy Awards when you have Anne Baxter and Bette Davis in their respective roles as Anne and Margo.
I:8440;184;Baxter is ideal for the role because of her charming and photogenic appeal.
I:8440;185;She is such a cute and seemingly innocent little girl that even when you realise underneath that exterior she's an evil and conniving madam, you still wait for her to change back to the ideal.
I:8440;186;The two roles fit the actresses perfectly live gloves, but it's Davis who really propels this film into the timeless movie stratosphere.
I:8440;187;Her honesty and devotion to the role is incredible .
I:8440;188;As if all this wasn't enough, a fresh.
I:8440;189;It's amazing to see this young 24 year old on screen in such a small role as Miss Caswell, and to think of what she would go on to achieve over the next 12 years of her superstar lifestyle.
I:8440;190;Everything is filmed in black and white and 90% of the film is talking, but this is precisely the best part.
I:8440;191;The characters are so believable in their roles that they completely absorb you and keep you focused on them, as you forget the surroundings and grip onto the groundbreaking (at the time) storyline that is unfolding.
I:8440;192;Who cares for special effects when you have such masterful dialogue like this?OVERALL GRADE: 10/10I cannot stress enough how enjoyable and brilliant this film is.
I:8440;193;Funny, yet sad at the same time.
I:8440;194;This is screen writing at its height, with a story that just grabs you and takes you along with it.
I:8440;195;new Special Edition of ALL ABOUT EVE offers a fantastic insight into one of the most influential and refreshing films to have emerged from Hollywood in the 1950s.
I:8440;196;Still as potent and as darkly hilarious now as when it was first released, ALL ABOUT EVE tells the story of a seemingly.
I:8440;197;Eve soon makes herself indispensable in Margo's circle of friends and eventually becomes her understudy on stage as well as in life.
I:8440;198;to eclipse Margo as the greatest star on Broadway.
I:8440;199;anne Baxter and Bette Davis delivers consummate performances as Eve and Margo.
I:8440;200;Baxter is so convincing as the down.
I:8440;201;She is simply that good.
I:8440;202;"Celeste Holm (riding high following her Oscar win for ""Gentleman's Agreement"") is a delight as Margo's best friend Karen Richards."
I:8440;203;Thelma Ritter scored an Oscar nomination for her role as Margo's wisecracking assistant Birdie Coonan.
I:8440;204;Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe are fine as the men in the lives of Margo and Karen.
I:8440;205;It won six trophies including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders), Best Screenplay and Best Director (Joseph L. Mankiewicz).
I:8440;206;Baxter was supposed to have been nominated in the `Best Supporting Actress' category, but insisted she be put into the `Best Actress' competition, feeling her role in the film of equal importance to Bette Davis'.
I:8440;207;"There is also the informative ""Backstory"" episode on the making of the film (featuring wonderful interviews, filmed in 1983, with Anne Baxter and Bette Davis)."
I:8440;208;do they see anyone in this movie engaging in any homosexual conduct???
I:8440;209;If you like black and white movies, this is definetly one of the greats, and to me Bette Davis best movie.
I:8440;210;This film brought Davis' career back from the brink and set up a very productive second act in her career.
I:8440;211;As Margo, Davis throws some of the best tantrums of her career.
I:8440;212;I recommend this to every one who loves the old movies.
I:8440;213;I just loved this, she's such a brilliant actressArrived quickly and great packaging.
I:8440;214;"This movie is a fantastic classic film
I:8440;215;The ending is fantastic, and Anne Baxter gets what she deserves unsuspectingly.
I:8440;216;It is a classic, well.
I:8440;217;written work that captures the true nature of the Theatre.
I:8440;218;I have always loved it.
I:8440;219;It remains a monumental film.
I:8440;220;One of the best movies ever bette davis at her best.
I:8440;221;Anne baxter one her most stellar performances.
I:8440;222;This is probably the best film ever made and in Blu.
I:8440;223;"Awesome idea putting it in ""book"" form."
I:8440;224;If you are a Bette Davis fan you must see this movie,many consider it one of her best preformances.
I:8440;225;the movie won the Oscar for best picture in 1950.
I:8440;226;eve not only steals Margo's role but disrupts the lives of Margo's director borfriend (Guy Merrill)& her other friends in this delightful drama You will also seeGeorge Sanders,Celeste Holmes with a short but fun appearance of Marilyn Monroe.
I:8440;227;One of my ten favorite films of all time, this one is a marvelous exercise in the brio of the written word.
I:8440;228;Joseph Mankiewicz's script/direction is flawless, and this is easily his finest hour.
I:8440;229;"So many scenes are memorable, and far beyond comic
I:8440;230;"Bette Davis's Margo Channing may be the prima ""prima donna,"" but her simultaneous vulnerability makes her character very much loved."
I:8440;231;(In this respect, the film is remarkably ahead of its time.
I:8440;232;Now actresses in Hollywood are considered old at the age of thirty.)
I:8440;233;I wish Davis had won the Oscar this year (it would've capped her wonderful, albeit bumpy, career), but, as it is, this is probably her signature role.
I:8440;234;It is one of the last great, old.
I:8440;235;Bette made some terrific films.
I:8440;236;"this is one of my personal favorites along with ""Mr. Skeffington"" and ""Now Voyager""."
I:8440;237;It is fresh and few flaws are visible on this version.
I:8440;238;"I saw the new version of ""Sunset Blvd."" just after seeing this film, and though ""Eve"" was made the same year, it looks far cleaner and crisper than ""Sunset"" does."
I:8440;239;Bravo to the restoration crew here!
I:8440;240;What made this great movie the way it is?
I:8440;241;crafted script and the tour.

I:8440;249;bette Davis demonstrated greatness as a 40.

I:8440;251;Her suspicion and temper bespoke her serious reflection in love .
I:8440;252;did Bill, 8 years junior, love her as an great actress or as a woman?
I:8440;253;And fate has been very kind to her.
I:8440;254;"But we saw Margo's bigness off the stage
I:8440;255;She moved on gracefully, exuding a quiet confidence as a contented woman befittingly would.
I:8440;256;celeste Holm (High Society, A gentleman's agreement) has much to be applauded for her excellent portrayal as Karen, Margo's devoted friend.
I:8440;257;Karen's greatest mistake was, out of good intention, orchestrating Margot's absence from one performance, which Eve exploited to the fullest extent and her greatest advantage.
I:8440;258;Witness Celeste Holm's subtle deliverance in the build.
I:8440;259;the directng and script are simply flawless and intriguing to the last minute.
I:8440;260;minute recap was touching yet ironic.
I:8440;261;The movie ended with a master stroke .
I:8440;262;a sweet revenge perhaps and demonstration of the circle of life.
I:8440;263;Written and directed by the same hands, meticulous to the finest details from beginning to end, Joseph L. Mankiewicz deserved full credits.
I:8440;264;The movie delivered and the dialogue was so tailored made that the stars nailed their parts perfectly.
I:8440;265;Thelma Ritta's role was impressive but much smaller in comparison.
I:8440;266;Celeste Holm was a strong contender and deserved to win.
I:8440;267;a great movie like this (Best Picture, Best Director and Screenplay for Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Best Supporting Actor George Sanders, Best Sound, Best Costume Design) can be watched many times and still be amazed by the bits and pieces one might have overlooked.
I:8440;268;It won many awards at many festivals, and was nominated for fourteen Oscars.
I:8440;269;This film garnered six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (for Mankiewicz), Best Screenplay (for Mankiewicz) and Best Supporting Actor (for Sanders).
I:8440;270;Despite that, All About Eve is a great way to spend a few hours, and a shining example of classic Hollywood at its best (nearly).
I:8440;271;All About Eve is probably one of the best written movies in American film history.
I:8440;272;stage on this one, watching Anne Baxter transform herself from one person to another is amazing!
I:8440;273;Bette Davis and Anne Baxter (one of the prettiest discoveries ever made by Hollywood) give their best on this film, where the first one plays the role of a mature actress who struggles against a young and beautiful ascending star .
I:8440;274;the movie has the look of a dramatic play.
I:8440;275;It's oversaturated with dialogue and relies on the energy and talent of the actors more than a clever plot and cinematography through most of the film.
I:8440;276;But in spite of these critical comments, its obvious to recognize the greatness of the performances in this film.
I:8440;277;There were also several intense dramatic scenes near the end of the movie .
I:8440;278;I wasn't sold on the final scene, but that's only a minor blemish on an impressive movie.
I:8440;279;This film won an Oscar for Best Picture in 1950.
I:8440;280;I wasn't totally in love with 'All About Eve', but overall, I certainly have a lot of respect for it.
I:8440;281;notch for a 55 year old film and the sound is also above average.
I:8440;282;Bette Davis is classic in this film.
I:8440;283;One of the rare American masterpieces awarded by the Film Academy.
I:8440;284;58 years later, this movie still delivers.
I:8440;285;Book with pictures was nice.
I:8440;286;All About Eve is one of the greatest films released in 1950.
I:8440;287;It deservingly garnered a record 14 Oscar nominations (tied only by Titanic ) and won four, including Best Picture.
I:8440;288;Its plot adaptation from the original TV special is brilliant.
I:8440;289;Its theme of a middle.
I:8440;290;The various narration lines are a brilliant way to accent the events and the characters' emotions without the annoying repetition.
I:8440;291;Every event and word expressed keeps the necessary emotions intact.
I:8440;292;Bette Davis proves as always that she's one of the top 10 greatest actresses in cinema history.
I:8440;293;Anne Baxton portrays admirer Eve Harrington wonderfully.
I:8440;294;Davis and Baxton deservingly received Oscar nominations for Best Actress for their roles.
I:8440;295;George Sanders won his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Addison Dewitt, which he performs brilliantly.
I:8440;296;"All other actors also perform their roles wonderfully
I:8440;297;All About Eve is the ultimate film experience for those looking for a classic.
I:8440;298;This is sure to continue pleasing audiences for many more years.
I:8440;299;Fans and those looking for more should also watch Jezebel (1938, starring Bette Davis), and Chicago (2002, explores more show.
I:8440;300;The writing, direction, and and acting are about as top.
I:8440;301;Bette Davis, in what I feel is a departure for her, gives a sympathetic turn as the aging and besieged Margo Channing.
I:8440;302;In one of the great supporting turns of all time, George Sanders delivers as the intuitive theatre critic Addison DeWitt.
I:8440;303;A young, and surprisingly svelte, Marilyn Monroe also acquits herself well as DeWitt's arm candy.
I:8440;304;"Also in 1950, Monroe did a nice abbreviated bit in John Huston's classic, ""The Asphalt Jungle""."
I:8440;305;A treasure trove for cineastes alike.
I:8440;306;this is the best film ever made.
I:8440;307;Bette Davis at her wicked best.
I:8440;308;so fasten your seat belts.
I:8440;309;it's going to be a bumpy ride.
I:8440;310;"Copy and paste either of these numbers into ""Search"" cell above and you will get the relevant product."
I:8440;311;In All About Eve we have before us the talents of 6 principles and several supporting actors!
I:8440;312;Acting truly at its greatest!
I:8440;313;The movie may be named All About Eve in title but its really all about Davis' talent charisma, and originality of style.
I:8440;314;Beautiful and talented yet not quite the diva Davis and Crawford were in their prime.
I:8440;315;George Sanders is deliciously sinister, and commanding as the theatre critic Addison Dewitt as he helps to launch Eve Harrington's career while he puts Margot Channing's career in jeopardy with the use of his poisoned pen .
I:8440;316;great movie, great script,brilliant characters, all in a black and white movie .
I:8440;317;Bette Davis, who in my opinion is one of the most talented female actors in Hollywood history.
I:8440;318;Despite to numerous unforgettable characters she has given life to, for me Bette Davis is and always will be Margo Channing.
I:8440;319;Hollywood's best doing their best all in one movie, what more can one want.
I:8440;320;With its brilliant story, exquisite writing and impeccable performances this truly is the smartest and the most remarkable films I've ever seen.
I:8440;321;with a depth that makes you feel the characters are fully three.
I:8440;322;dimensional and the story is just like life, if perhaps more intense.
I:8440;323;I'm always a Bette Davis fan, but this is her again doing her greatest work.
I:8440;324;The storyline is beyond presumption and will truly keep you guessing at every character.
I:8440;325;In my opinion, the best Bette ever.
I:8440;326;Snappy dialogue, amazing acting by everyone in the movie.
I:8440;327;I love everything about it.
I:8440;328;Davis was wonderful as always and that part, her acting, was a pleasure to watch.
I:8440;329;I absolutely adore this movie.
I:8440;330;All About Eve, starring the divine Bette Davis, is one of my all.
I:8440;331;time favourite movies and this Blu.
I:8440;332;I'm so happy to finally be able to watch this classic in high definition.
I:8440;333;When I was a kid I would go to the second.
I:8440;334;It was all wonderful to me (although I would hide bashfully behind the seat during the love scenes).
I:8440;335;the first adult movie that ever really held my interest though was All About Eve.
I:8440;336;Such is the power of the all too human story and how directly and clearly it is told from a celebrated script and some sublime direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz.
I:8440;337;I sat with fascination, understanding perfectly how and why she had insinuated herself into Margo's life, and on the edge of my seat to find out what would become of her.
I:8440;338;Yes, a child may well know of such matters, and it is to the credit of Mankiewicz and everyone involved in the production that a movie could be made that would inform and fire the imagination of a ten.year.
I:8440;339;old boy while at the same time intrigue and entertain adults.
I:8440;340;law, the upstart and the established talent, the new and the old.
I:8440;341;bette Davis is excellent of course, and the role fits her like a glove.
I:8440;342;The script, resplendent with some very sharp one.
I:8440;343;Mankiewicz won Oscars for both his script and his direction, and Sanders won for Best Supporting Actor while the movie itself won for Best Picture over such fine films as Sunset Boulevard and Born Yesterday.
I:8440;344;bottom line: one of the great stories of the theater, a classic Hollywood film not to be missed.
I:8440;345;The blu ray of this film is excellent it never looked so good.
I:8440;346;I notice black and white movies are very sharp .
I:8440;347;Bette made the night a success.
I:8440;348;Biting, satiric comedy of the New York theater world.
I:8440;349;Incredibly witty script by director Joseph Mankiewicz is acted to the hilt by all, especially Davis and Baxter and, in standout supporting roles, George Sanders as a bitchy critic and Celeste Holm as Margo's loyal, long.
I:8440;350;As most classics are, it is dated but it is so well acted that you don't even care.
I:8440;351;One of the greatest movies of all times.
I:8440;352;I remember as a little girl watching this movie with my grandmother.
I:8440;353;Betty Davis delivers a stunning performance.
I:8440;354;This is THE movie that show so many levels of her talent.
I:8440;355;Story line is pretty interesting with a well deserved twist at the end
I:8440;356;the black and white cinematography is bold, beautiful and perfect.
I:8440;357;She definitely deserved the Oscar that year.
I:8440;358;Who cares in a portrayal this good.
I:8440;359;the direction, writing, acting .
I:8440;360;davis is brilliant here .
I:8440;361;one of the best female perfomances ever.
I:8440;362;Margo Channing is a force to be reckoned with!
I:8440;363;Baxter is appropriately cunning as the ingenue, Sander is delciously snarky and Thelma Ritter continues to display her status as a national movie treasure.
I:8440;364;a fun, witty, wicked and bumpy ride.
I:8440;365;Although it is an old classic the story line is still true today.
I:8440;366;Would recommend it to everyone especially if you are a Bette Davis fan.
I:8440;367;This movie is such a favorite of mine.
I:8440;368;Written with intelligence, wit,snap,sentiment and very true human emotions.
I:8440;369;If effectively allows you to understand about each character in a short amount of time.
I:8440;370;"Then, Fox released ""All About Eve"" and while I have never watched it before, I had heard and read excellent reviews about it."
I:8440;371;All About Eve is one of the greatest films ever made.
I:8440;372;It may not have epic sequences, grand locations and action but Joseph L. Mankiewicz's script is one of the best ever written.
I:8440;373;The dialogue is really witty, smart, funny and kept me invested in the story all the way.
I:8440;374;Of course with an excellent script comes an outstanding cast that helps All About Eve be the masterpiece it is.
I:8440;375;Of course, Bette Davis steals the show as Margo Channing, is a masterful performance and one of the greatest I've seen.
I:8440;376;and I was completely amazed of how good she was.
I:8440;377;all About Eve remains a timeless classic thanks to Mankiewics's excellent script and direction and the masterful work of his cast especially Bette Davis who was and remains a true star.
I:8440;378;This is my first B/W BD and the result is spectacular.
I:8440;379;Blacks and whites are really balanced, contrast is sharp and there is no sign of edge ehancement, flecks, specks, dirt and other problems.
I:8440;380;"Also is good to see that the film hasn't been scrubbed excessively because it maintains a fine ""film"" look that has a thin layer of grain."
I:8440;381;driven film and every voice, word or sound is crisp and clear without any noise or distortion.
I:8440;382;of documentary, a documentary on the real Eve and another on the Sarah Siddons Society, promotion featurettes, awards ceremonies and a theatrical trailer, so you got a lot to enjoy here.
I:8440;383;My only problem with it is that it is a little delicate and that is larger than a normal BD case so part of it is exposed in my shelf making it look weird, but aside from that everything else is perfect.
I:8440;384;all About Eve is a masterpiece that everyone should see.
I:8440;385;With stunning video, great audio and a healthy collection of bonus material, Fox has treated this classic as deserved.
I:8440;386;All About Eve is one of the best movies ever made.
I:8440;387;The writing is top rate.
I:8440;388;I believe to be Bette Davis's best movie!
I:8440;389;this movie rocks and rolls!
I:8440;390;Sanders and Ritter were exceptional.
I:8440;391;In the story, Orr gives the girl a more ruthless character and allows her to succeed in stealing the career of the older actress.
I:8440;392;George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Hugh Marlowe, Barbara Bates, Gary Merrill and Thelma Ritter also appear, and the film provided one of Marilyn Monroe's earliest important roles.
I:8440;393;Overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics upon its release on October 13, 1950 at a New York City premiere, many Oscars and other prizes.
I:8440;394;The film's competitor, Sunset Boulevard, released the same year, drew similar praise, and the two were often favorably compared.
I:8440;395;From the standpoint of story, script, acting, cast, direction, photography, this is one of the greatest films in movie history.
I:8440;396;just good acting and fine development.
I:8440;397;This movie reminds me of the old saying, Keep your friends close and your enemies closer .
I:8440;398;I choose this movie because I have seen real life people commit the most horrendous acts to climb up the success ladder.
I:8440;399;Lessons learned about trusting what a person say, perform a background check.
I:8440;400;Bette Davis is of course as genuine and outspoken as ever, and I remember reading somewhere the acting man she's in love with in this movie was a real life romance.
I:8440;401;According to the playwright character in this film, great stars never age.
I:8440;402;"Such is the case with director/screenwriter Joseph Mankiewicz's ""All About Eve"", one of the wittiest and most entertaining movies about backstage shenanigans in the theater world."
I:8440;403;And thus a legendary performance was born with Davis' diva posturing perfectly balanced by her curdled insecurities and acid.
I:8440;404;This is movie acting of the highest order.
I:8440;405;All the women in this film are uniformly excellent .
I:8440;406;defining performance as the acid.
I:8440;407;mankiewicz's script contains so many classic scenes that it's hard to pick which one is best, a nice dilemma for a viewer to have, though one of my favorites is Margo's astute confessional to Karen about being a woman.
I:8440;408;The use of multiple narrators works perfectly as they piece together Eve's climb to stardom providing consensus to the perception of what a shrewd manipulator she is.
I:8440;409;The ending seems a bit extended to show how such ambition seems almost genetic and successive in character, nonetheless, the film is a deserved classic.
I:8440;410;The extras include an informative half.
I:8440;411;This film has great stars and a great story of a young woman's comeuppance on broadway.
I:8440;412;Bette Davis is brilliant as Margo Channing, who has one of the best lines of the film.
I:8440;413;ray edition of All About Eve has a new fabulous, super clear flawless print, and incredible stereophonic sound.
I:8440;414;The movie itself is a classic, one of the ten best movies ever made, with Bette Davis giving a once.
I:8440;415;The new print is much clearer than any earlier versions and the sound has been improved over the years from extremely muffled (VHS) to this incredibly clear and excellent sounding transfer.
I:8440;416;Now 52 years old, this movie still sparkles with wit and brilliance!
I:8440;417;A real masterpiece, All About Eve is a must.
I:8440;418;see which features a great sarcastic script (lots of one.
I:8440;419;liners) and fantastic performances from a star.
I:8440;420;It also is a true reflection on what the theater is all about.
I:8440;421;anyhow, this movie is still as fresh, original, and relevant as if it had been made yesterday.
I:8440;422;With great performances from Davis and Baxter and a sarcastic, biting script, this movie is a must.
I:8440;423;Get it soon and enjoy!
I:8440;424;about the inner workings of actors (stage), their careers and their games.
I:8440;425;But the video is impeccable and will definitely be cherished by my family for years to come.
I:8440;426;George Sanders plays an excellent villainous character, Gary Merrill also stars and more.
I:8440;427;Although this is not my favorite Bette Davis film, this is her best performance by far.
I:8440;428;"Considering the legend of Bette Davis, that's like saying ""this is the best Picasso ever did""."
I:8440;429;if that wasn't incentive enough, look for a cameo by a major legend in the making in the middle of the film.
I:8440;430;This role was Davis'best bet for a comeback and a Best Actress Oscar, yet she sadly lost it to Judy Holliday.
I:8440;431;honored in all Oscar history, garnering more than 12 nominations.
I:8440;432;the ensemble acting is literally some of the best any film has ever offered.
I:8440;433;scenes featurette: the making of the film is as interesting as watching it.
I:8440;434;Her acting was powerful, passionate and convincing.
I:8440;435;Plot was great and held my attention throughout the movie.
I:8440;436;Actors had great chemistry, especially between Bette Davis and Gary Merrill.
I:8440;437;Eve Harrington impresses and deceives a group of theatre people in order to make a career for herself.
I:8440;438;A film for the ages.
I:8440;439;Great dialogue and great acting from Bette Davis and excellent support from the rest of the cast make for a classic film that is unique in film history.
I:8440;440;An Oscar winning film that deserves its' Oscars.
I:8440;441;After nearly 60 years the humor is still fresh,sparkling,and beautifully written.
I:8440;442;The cast is first rate and varied.
I:8440;443;The supporting actors shine just as much as the leads in this behind the scenes drama of the theater.
I:8440;444;The dialogue is crisp,biting,and as sharp as a razor.
I:8440;445;Among the greatest dramas ever written, this brilliant film elevates an outstanding script with extraordinary acting.
I:8440;446;It received 14 Oscar Nominations in 12 categories and won 6 including Best Picture and Director.
I:8440;447;When Margo's best friend Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) invites her in to meet Margo it begins a relationship that is destined to turn into a typhoon.
I:8440;448;With duplicitous and cunning ambition, Eve maneuvers her way into becoming Margo's understudy.
I:8440;449;The resulting tension between Margo and Eve is electric, with power plays, blackmail and conniving at every turn.
I:8440;450;john Mankiewicz was one of the most prolific and gifted auteurs of the studio era.
I:8440;451;His accomplishment in this film is gargantuan, with a powerful script and forceful direction of a talented cast.
I:8440;452;The dialogue is fantastic, with snide humor and barbed innuendo that cuts like a stiletto.
I:8440;453;Bette Davis appeared in over 100 films in her 58 year career, nominated for 11 Best Acting Oscars and winning two.
I:8440;454;This was one of her very best performances and it escapes me why she did not win the award that year.
I:8440;455;Davis is a whirlwind of dramatic power in a riveting portrayal of the tempestuous Margo.
I:8440;456;She imbues Margo with a gigantic ego and equally enormous insecurity, which yields some of the best and most bitter tantrum spewing ever been put on celluloid.
I:8440;457;the supporting actors were also superb.
I:8440;458;George Sanders won a best supporting Oscar for his haughty performance as Addison De Witt.
I:8440;459;Celeste Holm was nominated for a supporting Oscar and was terrific as Margo's well meaning, but meddling friend.
I:8440;460;One of my favorites was Thelma Ritter (also nominated for Best Supporting Actress) as Birdie, an unrefined and blunt woman with extraordinary perceptiveness about Eve's true nature.
I:8440;461;There is even an early look at Marilyn Monroe in a small part as Addison De Witts ditzy date.
I:8440;462;this is one of the best dramas ever made and among my favorite films of all time.
I:8440;463;It is required viewing for classic film buffs.
I:8440;464;Cunningly, Eve steals Margo's role, smashes Margo's best friend, Karen Richards' (Celeste Holm) marriage, and becomes the toast of Broadway!
I:8440;465;I don't know if the film would have worked as well without the suave and sophisticated performance by George Sanders (Rebecca (1939), he is truly remarkable as the story's narrator and Broadway critic, Addison DeWitt.
I:8440;466;This film also marks the screen debut of legendary beauty, Marilyn Monroe, who plays a bit part as Addison's lovely date at Bill's welcome home party.
I:8440;467;Even here Marilyn's astonishing screen presence and simmering sensuality (of which she would later ride to fame on) is clearly evident.
I:8440;468;"All About Eve has been hailed as ""One of the smartest pictures of all time."
I:8440;469;"a picture for any era"" by the L. a. Times, and Variety put it simply best as ""Captivating!"""
I:8440;470;It's interesting to see Bette Davis and co. starring romantic lead, Gary Merrill (who play's Margo's lover Bill Sampson) play out their scenes together, for in real life they actually marry and similar odds ends their relationship.
I:8440;471;"Anne Baxter and Celeste Holm are featured in the interviews and give some interesting insights on the film and it's ""behind the scenes"" antics."
I:8440;472;"** ""All About Eve"" is now available in a fantastic 2."
I:8440;473;Lots of extras and loads of fun!!
I:8440;474;She is able to meet a great Broadway star (Bette Davis) as well as her close circle of friends.
I:8440;475;This ambitious girl finally convinces one of Margot's friends Karen (Celeste Holm), to let her be an understudy.
I:8440;476;And so when Margot is detained the night of a show, Eve gets her chance at the big time.
I:8440;477;Through her manipulation, she meets a famous critic (George Sanders) and wins an award.
I:8440;478;This film was pretty good and featured a good cast including Thelma Ritter and a young Marilyn Monroe.
I:8440;479;One of the most intelligent scrips ever produced, this film is a delight to watch.
I:8440;480;"For a film to pip ""Sunset Boulevard"" to the best picture Oscar of 1950 it must be a pretty darn good one and ""All About Eve"" doesn't disappoint."
I:8440;481;"With ""Sunset Boulevard"" it's the movies while with ""All About Eve"" it's the theatre."
I:8440;482;The casting here is also inspired with Bette Davis putting on a great performance although I would have given the Oscar for best actress to Gloria Swanson who just pipped it for me for her role as Norma Desmond the psychotic silent film star.
I:8440;483;ray that an even better restoration with Surround Sound options included is released soon.
I:8440;484;this is a brilliant film and I highly recommend it to movie buffs.
I:8440;485;ray version is incredible for a number of reasons.
I:8440;486;The booklet alone is worth the sticker price and I wish all blu.
I:8440;487;ray releases could come this beautifully packaged.
I:8440;488;definitely worth the upgrade and hence very highly recommended!
I:8440;489;The extras alone are worth the price of the set.
I:8440;490;length commentaries (the 2nd is the superior).
I:8440;491;Then there's the 2nd disk with wonderful insights into the people involved in the movie, the personal interactions, the lives of the cast and crew.
I:8440;492;Heck, the 2nd disk alone is worth the price of admission.
I:8440;493;worth, and join the chorus of praise for this magnificent specimen of The Golden Age of Hollywood, in which Fortune favoured Twentieth.
I:8440;494;"Instead sheer luck caused Joseph Mankewiecz to gather a perfect storm"" of a cast for this ""bumpy ride"" in his witty scenario of an aging temperamental Broadway Star and those who are forced to deal with her tantrums, because of the constraints of a putting on a theatrical production: Bette Davis as Margo (arguably her best role)
I:8440;495;In assembling and directing this stellar cast so brilliantly, Mankewiecz has created cinematic magic.
I:8440;496;"Sanders and Holm deservedly won Oscars for their portrayals
I:8440;497;It's only a movie about theatre, and an outstanding one at that.
I:8440;498;Love it in Black and white.
I:8440;499;If you love Bettie Davis you will love this movie.
I:8440;500;By most accounts the set was unusually explosive, with Davis proving as tempermental as the role she played and directing most of her fury at co. star Celeste Holm.
I:8440;501;But as they say, what counts is what you see on the screen, and ALL ABOUT EVE emerged as one of the most honored films of all time, racking up an unheard.
I:8440;502;But the razor sharp script offers a showcase for a cast of brilliant artists at the height of their talents, and they skate across the screen with such exceptional skill that all criticism seems negligable.
I:8440;503;etched crystal: hard, sharp, and brilliant from top to bottom.
I:8440;504;One of the great classics.
I:8440;505;She is this movie all by her self.
I:8440;506;betty davis does so good in this movie.
I:8440;507;its like she makes her movies come alive.
I:8440;508;stabbing her way to success.
I:8440;509;It is a very good movie starring many excellent actors (although whether George Sanders deserved his Oscar win is debatable .
I:8440;510;stabber but a great deal of her success, particularly at the start of the film, is due to the occurrence of serendipitous events (for example, the pregnancy of Channing's understudy leaving an opening for Eve) rather than on her scheming and that is where the story falls down.
I:8440;511;overall, I recommend this film for its themes, acting and cultural significance, but I do not think that it was worthy of its six Oscar wins including Best Picture and Best Screenplay.
I:8440;512;This is easily my favorite film of all time.
I:8440;513;This is Bette Davis' greatest performance, and her lover in this film (Bill) is a man unparalleled.
I:8440;514;The story is bittersweet and real, the acting so good it isn't acting, and I can't get over the script: whoever wrote it, full of wit, genius and truth, deserves an Oscar.
I:8440;515;a beautiful film, unveiling what a woman's heart really desires, and showing the scruples and vanity of other females who forget that they ARE women.
I:8440;516;a film that should be owned, not just viewed.
I:8440;517;This, in my opinion, was one of the best of Bette Davis Movies.
I:8440;518;The supporting cast, George Sanders, Anne Baxter, and Celeste Holm were all excellent too!
I:8440;519;A well known actress as Bette Davis return onscreen with a performance long remebered.
I:8440;520;Ann Baxter as a young star,gives a strong performance of a ruthless actrice on her way to the top.
I:8440;521;For Bette Davis fans, this story is special since she plays the part of an established Hollywood actress.
I:8440;522;Ever so slowly but surely, Margo's young fan carefully works her way into the inner circle of the seasoned actress.
I:8440;523;You are on the top of the hill one day.
I:8440;524;You can have real talent.
I:8440;525;The scope of this film and perhaps its long lasting appeal is that the viewer can easily identify with it and draw parallels to this narrative in their own life experiences.
I:8440;526;This a great film in my humble opinion.
I:8440;527;I truly love this picture and have seen it like over 25 times now and can never get enough of it.
I:8440;528;As a writer I cannot even begin to figure out just how Mankiewicz so giftedly came up with such superb theatrical dialogue and situations that evoke the true spirit of life in the theater.
I:8440;529;The character of Addison DeWitt is truly remarkable.
I:8440;530;This film is both funny and serious, thus serving as the perfect mixture for any great picture.
I:8440;531;The humor comes from Davis and Ritter in their smart cracks about this and that and who can't chuckle at the remarks Sanders makes about Eve, the theater, and life itself, particularly when he says that he leaves all loves to Louisa May Alcott.
I:8440;532;When I first saw this film back on a cold, rainy and dismal Sunday morning in December of 1996 and unable to make it to church I just popped this into the VCR because I had just bought it the day before, simply because it is one of the greatest achievements to ever come out of Hollywood.
I:8440;533;The magnificent blend of humor and drama has the power to banish all doldrums in life and this film does just that and more.
I:8440;534;No film before or since has ever come close to the magic of this one, which shines with a great cast assemblage and rising Marilyn Monroe to everlasting fame in her small role at the party in the film.
I:8440;535;All theater buffs and fans of the stage should see this film and learn from it, as should filmmakers.
I:8440;536;It's no wonder it won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1950.
I:8440;537;My family and I truly love and treasure this film as did my cousin who truly loves the theater and has played Anne Frank on the stage.
I:8440;538;No video shelf should be without this classic, for it so vividly represents Hollywood at its very best.
I:8440;539;I had no expectations about the movie, but I was pleasantly surprised about how good it was.
I:8440;540;The entire cast clicks throughout and Bette Davis delivers the best one liners of her career.
I:8440;541;Davis is at her best and Ann Baxter ,George Sanders,Celeste Holmes and Thelma Ritter match her all the way.
I:8440;542;it,s a great story,very well acted and has a great ending.
I:8440;543;"Joseph L. Mankewicz (who would go on to direct the infamous 1963 epic""Cleopatra"" and the 1972 mystery ""Sleuth,"" starring the greatest stage and screen actor ever to inhabit the Earth, Sir Laurence Olivier) writes and directs this witty film about Hollywood (the other film which worked like this was the 1952 classic ""Singin' In The Rain"")."
I:8440;544;"Bette Davis, Celeste Holm (Best Supporting Actress for the classic""Gentleman's Agreement""), Anne Baxter, Guy Merrill and George Sanders (who would win Best Supporting Actor) star in this classic film."
I:8440;545;and now getting it on Amazon streaming is just great.
I:8440;546;Indeed, in 1970 this film became a musical and won Lauren Bacall a Tony for her role as Margo.
I:8440;547;bette Davis, Celeste Holm, George Sanders, Anne Baxter, Thelma Ritter, Gary Merrill and Marilyn Monroe all have memorable lines and turn in good performances.
I:8440;548;good movie if youre into old ones :) it was interesting and i would recommend it to anyone really!
I:8440;549;The superb and smart script deals with the universe behind the scenes world of the New York theater.
I:8440;550;a superb classic, one of the most towering films in the Fifties, one of the ten best American films in any age, an everlasting cult movie, a living lesson of how to make a good picture, robust and incisive dialogues, exceptional cinematography and an obligated reference for the viewers of yesterday, today and future make of this an absolute must.
I:8440;551;without discussion, the glorious masterpiece of Joseph Mankiewicz.
I:8440;552;"as George Eliot's Middlemarch is to readers
I:8440;553;Celeste Holm and George Sanders are particularly delightful, and when Ms. Holm laughs in one memorable scene where the elite meet .
I:8440;554;well, her laughter is so infectious that it is impossible but to join in and howl at the irony of the moment.
I:8440;555;The wit alone makes it worth watching.
I:8440;556;Such sharp dialogue and biting repartee.
I:8440;557;I love the dry humor and satirical outlook.
I:8440;558;Bette Davis was so phenomenal in this piece it makes me want to see more of her stuff.
I:8440;559;But it was a great role to shine in.
I:8440;560;George Sanders really shone in his role as well.
I:8440;561;This movie really ages flawlessly with time.
I:8440;562;I loved this movie it really touches on a lot of things that are present in today's society.
I:8440;563;If you've ever been stabbed in the back by someone you trusted or betrayed by anyone, you'll love this movie.
I:8440;564;I prefer more visual movies (Hitchcock, Welles, Hawks), but every now and then I like to watch a movie that's got perfect dialogue.
I:8440;565;"And, having seen it for the first time in a long while, I forgot how much I loved ""All About Eve."""
I:8440;566;Firstly, it appeals to my cynical nature.
I:8440;567;But, secondly, each character is so sharply defined, the dialogue so perfectly tailored to each actor that you just have to marvel at Joseph Mankiewicz' screenplay.
I:8440;568;"All About Eve is a brilliant, caustic and cynical movie that centers around the disparate personalities of three women, though it hardly can be called a ""chick flick."""
I:8440;569;All About Eve instead gives the viewer a double.
I:8440;570;More than just a woman, Margo is a force of nature.
I:8440;571;Eve knows enough about human nature to climb over corpses on the way to the top, but to do so without even having to lift a finger.
I:8440;572;This is the genius of Manckiewicz's crafting of her character.
I:8440;573;tell you that women can be much more vicious than men, and this screenplay gorgeously fleshes out this observation.
I:8440;574;From the start, Eve wraps playwright Lloyd Richards (played by Hugh Marlowe, in his best role) around her finger, and finagles a leading role in his new play at Margo's expense.
I:8440;575;headed realist with a heart, Karen (Celeste Holm) immediately sees right through her ruse.
I:8440;576;"All About Eve is the Great Black Comedy, because of the ironic observation that Eve didn't even need to use her treachery and backstabbing ruses to get to the top
I:8440;577;All About Eve is a textbook on economy of dialogue, sharp wit and well.
I:8440;578;writing was a highly polished one, versus the casual, aimless grunt.
I:8440;579;"And ""All About Eve"" is the most brilliant of gems."
I:8440;580;One of the best Betty Davis movies ever.
I:8440;581;"I watched it many times on TV
I:8440;582;ALL ABOUT EVEGive Bette Davis her due, this is one of her best films.
I:8440;583;who is all but blind sighted by the young, lovely and insinuating Anne Baxter (who is by the way Frank Lloyd Wright's granddaughter in real life).
I:8440;584;With a great supporting cast, it is a wonderful evening's entertainment and wears well for repeat screenings.
I:8440;585;Saw All About Eve in 1950, loved it then and it hasn't aged a bit.
I:8440;586;Fine, intellectual script, entertaining and great performances.
I:8440;587;no wonder it was awarded best picture of 1950!
I:8440;588;I have always been a fan of this film.
I:8440;589;Two of the films supporting stars, the snide Thelma Ritter and the sarcastic George Sanders (who won an Oscar for his role) are superb.
I:8440;590;Repeated viewings do not dull the shine of this excellent movie.
I:8440;591;She tears into the character (and every scene) with relish.
I:8440;592;Gary Merrill is very good as her younger director.
I:8440;593;Celeste Holm is her calm, understanding best friend (a playwright's wife), and she's terrific, especially in scenes where she communicates a lot with simple reactions.
I:8440;594;George Sanders is at his very best and steals many scenes as the sharp tongued critic who sits back and manipulates the events.
I:8440;595;Thelma Ritter is right on target as Davis' all.
I:8440;596;But special praise should go to Anne Baxter as Eve, the conniving young lady who insinuates herself into Davis' life.
I:8440;597;Joseph Mankiewicz's script is simply perfect, from its narrative construction with the opening framing device, to its witty, mature, quotable dialogue.
I:8440;598;This is one of those films where you just sit back, smile, and marvel at the excellence each time you view it.
I:8440;599;The gloriously written script by the master of the screen, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, made this the best of all of Bette Davis's movies.
I:8440;600;Her talent develops a personality that is both ruthless yet sensitive, as she plays Margo Channing, a well established stage actress who accepts, then regrets, a young fan, played by Anne Baxter.
I:8440;601;Margo's tantrums, while spoiled as they are, are ear candy, putting her whole strength into every word.
I:8440;602;The contempt, spite, betrayal, and pure 100% sacrasim weaves a tapestry of a humorous satire on the lives of people of the theater, which will never be duplicated to a higher level.
I:8440;603;All About Eve for a long time held the record for most Oscar nominations with 14.
I:8440;604;Of particularly ironic interest is the fact that up and coming actress Anne Baxter possibly pressured the higher ups to market her for a Best Actress Oscar rather than Supporting Actress.
I:8440;605;This has lead people to believe that the Academy's vote was split between her and her costar Bette Davis, allowing Judy Holliday to win the Best Actress Oscar for Born Yesterday.
I:8440;606;Eve proves herself humble and idolizes Margo, and due to her past hard life, and the fact that she has nowhere to go, Margo moves her into her home and hires her as an assistant.
I:8440;607;Slowly Eve begins to move her way in with Margo's friends and colleagues and eventually tries to take her position on the stage.
I:8440;608;all About Eve is constantly listed in the greatest movies lists (#21 in Entertainment Weekly, #28 in American Film Institute, #85 on IMDb) and with good reason.
I:8440;609;This is one of those rare occasions where everything comes together to create the perfect storm.
I:8440;610;The script provides us a brilliant look backstage at the theater, using it to parallel the still somewhat newer form of film at the time.
I:8440;611;While everyone speaks highly of the performances given by Baxter and Davis, and they are extremely brilliant performances, the one that stands out to me is George Sanders as Addison DeWitt.
I:8440;612;Equal parts savvy and slimy, he commands and controls every scene he's in with a flair for control.
I:8440;613;It also helped launch Baxter's career as a leading lady after a decade in supporting roles, as well as Marilyn Monroe who was a relative unknown at the time.
I:8440;614;"This is a film of many pleasures including one of the greatest lines of dialogue of all time (""Fasten your seatbelts."
I:8440;615;If you haven't seen this flick I highly recommend you pick it up and give it a try!
I:8440;616;Celeste HOlm is still very much alive and kicking.
I:8440;617;$30 and absolutely nothing extra.
I:8440;618;Turner should take a lesson from Universal which is doing a magnificent job re.
I:8440;619;This move includes outstanding dialogue, great acting on behalf of Bette Davis, and the movie is filled with delicious drama!
I:8440;620;The dialogue is an absolute marvel and so is the acting from all the cast members.
I:8440;621;Great acting by the aging Bette, and the rest of the cast, especially Sanders, who with mannerisms and an aspect of superiority excellently plays a semi.
I:8440;622;The performances are very good.
I:8440;623;One of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8440;624;One wonders how Mankiewicz could keep the egos of all the Oscar winners in check and still turn out this multiple Oscar winning film.
I:8440;625;Baxter is terrific in her role as a phony, trying and succeeding in winning over Davis, then sailing past her into stardom.
I:8440;626;One can see Davis on screen nearly frothing.
I:8440;627;merrill and the underrated Holm do their best to keep the peace.
I:8440;628;Add an ironic ending and there you have it.
I:8440;629;Like only a few other movies, this film brought together a cast of performers at their personal peaks.
I:8440;630;Certainly, Bette Davis never surpassed her performance as Margo, and is best remembered for this part.
I:8440;631;George Sanders was at his sarcastic best in a performance he never again equalled.
I:8440;632;a fun film to watch with a big bowl of popcorn and an appreciation of these performers, most long gone.
I:8440;633;Thank God for the magic of recording!
I:8440;634;Just as the final sequence rounds off our understanding of the real Eve Harrington, it also reveals that there will always be those who reach the top in the theatre world and those who aspire to reach it.
I:8440;635;Critics and audiences, ever since, have always rated it amongst their favorite films.
I:8440;636;it is great to see Betty Davis upstaged by a person more evil than her!
I:8440;637;This is an outstanding film with a stellar ensemble cast headed by Bette Davis!You want more?
I:8440;638;It was nominated for 14 Oscars and won six .
I:8440;639;Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, Supporting Actor, Costume Design, Sound!
I:8440;640;That should tell you something.
I:8440;641;there is a plethora of special features .
I:8440;642;and the presentation package is exemplary.
I:8440;643;"if you enjoy a film filled with great character development, acerbic wit, and human drama, ""All About Eve"" is for you."
I:8440;644;Eve is the wolf in sheep's clothing, a comer with just enough talent and cunning to penetrate Margo's inner circle and catch her when she's vulnerable and feeling her age.
I:8440;645;Davis gives the best performance of her long career, and young Baxter is outstanding.
I:8440;646;George Sanders also impresses as jaded critic Addison De Witt, the only soul wise enough to see what Eve is up to.
I:8440;647;All About Eve is one GREAT FILM.
I:8440;648;It is fast paced and very smart.
I:8440;649;It also has a walk on by Marilyn Monroe.
I:8440;650;Both Bette Davis and Anne Baxter were excellent in All About Eve, but this was Ms. Davis' movie.
I:8440;651;The dialogues were sharp and witty, and even today, nothing can come close to the great performances of these two very fine actresses in this movie classic.
I:8440;652;If you like great movie entertainment with wit, biting and sarcastic dialogues, and superb performances by all, then by all means see All About Eve.
I:8440;653;A truly great movie and a classic in American cinema.
I:8440;654;and the ending will leave you breathless.yes, that good!
I:8440;655;Amazing film with brilliant acting!
I:8440;656;The dialogue is scintillating characters.
I:8440;657;perfect and production as fine as anything 20th Century Fox turned out in Joseph L .
I:8440;658;winning for best picture .
I:8440;659;The cunning Eve maneuvers her way into Margo?s Broadway role , becomes a sensational and even cause turmoil in the lives of Margo?s director boyfriend (Gary Merrill 1915.1990) , her playwright (Hugh Marlowe 1911.1982) and his wife (Celeste Holm 1919. )
I:8440;660;Only the cynical drama critic (George Sanders 1906.1972) sees through Eve , admiring her audacity and perfect pattern o deceit .
I:8440;661;Thelma Ritter (1905.1969) and Marilyn Monroe (1926.1962) co. stars in this acclaimed classic , which won six Academy Award and received the most nominations (14) in film history .
I:8440;662;The screenplay alone rates five stars!
I:8440;663;Bette Davis gives one of her most amazing performances as a bitchy stage diva who finds her life slowly being stolen by a younger, ambitious actress.
I:8440;664;"(It's kinda like ""Showgirls"" only, you know, good.)"
I:8440;665;"(""Everybody has a heart ."
I:8440;666;This bracing movie with razor.
I:8440;667;sharp dialogue is still as fresh today as when it first opened over 55 years ago.
I:8440;668;And, whatever that particular performance's (many) other merits, it's also a very interesting performance, as it looks in both directions: it has shades of the younger, more alluring Davis in the star's mannerisms and delivery, but also looks forward to the emerging older, seasoned woman whose most energetic (and predatory?)
I:8440;669;This transitional aspect of the role, which functions as Ms. Davis' final goodbye to being one type of star and welcoming, perhaps reluctantly, the new type of personality Hollywood needed her to be, adds a whole layer of interest and richness to the movie.
I:8440;670;But I guess it's film history and still worth seeing.
I:8440;671;This memorable, supremely entertaining film gets an unqualified recommendation.
I:8440;672;Top notch writing, ensemble acting, directing and character development.
I:8440;673;George Sanders steals the show.
I:8440;674;The perfect script, the perfect role AND she ended up with a husband at the end of it all!!!
I:8440;675;As cinematic masterpieces go, this movie would be difficult to top.
I:8440;676;Superb casting from Bette Davis (with her claws fully extended), Anne Baxter (watch your back, Bette) to the delightful Thelma Ritter, Celeste Holmes, Gary Merrill and George Sanders only to mention the leads and major supporting cast.
I:8440;677;This is simply the greatest movie in American Cinema History.
I:8440;678;The acting is superb, especially Davis and Sanders.
I:8440;679;bette davis and george sanders 'genius' in this film is unlike any other!!!
I:8440;680;even marilyn monroe was absolutely wonderful!!!
I:8440;681;This is probably Bette Davis's best and most famous film.
I:8440;682;She is at her best here and has a great supporting cast.
I:8440;683;A treat to see Marilyn Monroe in a brief appearance in this outstanding film.
I:8440;684;Excellent performances by a great ensemble cast, including a very young Marilyn Monroe, playing to type, but very effective.
I:8440;685;Considered by some to be one of the most literate movies ever made.
I:8440;686;It certainly contains some of the best acting ever done on film.
I:8440;687;Everyone does a wonderful job .
I:8440;688;Marilyn Monroe has a small part and is lovely in it.
I:8440;689;If you want to see a great vintage classic film with wonderful acting pyrotechnics get this one.
I:8440;690;The bonus material always gives added incite.
I:8440;691;This classic is one of the best movies ever.
I:8440;692;"Thelma Ritter doing what she does best and George Sanders in the perfect role for him as the ""critic""."
I:8440;693;Everyone who enjoys movies will love this one.
I:8440;694;Bette Davis will kick you in the guts, pull out your liver, stomp on it and smile the entire time with a cigarette in one hand and a martini in the other.
I:8440;695;, which she is, but with good reason.
I:8440;696;lots of great supporting actors, including a few small scenes with Marilyn Monroe.
I:8440;697;crafted script with stinging wit and conversations.
I:8440;698;"I have seen this film many times and still I get that ""thrill"" whenever a clever line is uttered."
I:8440;699;This is my favorite Bette Davis movie.
I:8440;700;The information presented on the second disk added to the enjoyment of the movie.
I:8440;701;also played with such believable passion.
I:8440;702;"tongued Thelma Ritter as Margo's first companion, Birdie (wonderful performance, my favorite)
I:8440;703;The recipe for theatre success is simplified.
I:8440;704;Meet Eve, the most ambitious parasite you are ever likely to encounter.
I:8440;705;Margo Channing (Bette Davis) has everything any outsider would envy: a successful career, close friends, a younger man who loves her.
I:8440;706;"She also has a 'fan' named Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter), who manages to worm her way into Margo's life, in order to ""study her like a blueprint."""
I:8440;707;Eve forfeits true friendships .
I:8440;708;One of her greatest films!
I:8440;709;Great story, lots of famous people.
I:8440;710;Marilyn Monroes cameo almost steals the show!
I:8440;711;Its witty and actually a good story about.
I:8440;712;I loved this movie,and would recommend it to anyone interested in old films.
I:8440;713;Although I am twenty, I love the old actresses and this film is one of my favorites.
I:8440;714;I believe that the character Margo Channing, captures much of the real Bette Davis.
I:8440;715;What else can I say, try this old movie it truly is a classic.
I:8440;716;Exceptional movie that was very well acted!
I:8440;717;I love the storyline the most as it deals with flattery and backstabbing in order to advance in one's own life/career.
I:8440;718;the ending of this movie is truly the best part as it only shows what goes around comes around!
I:8440;719;This is one of my favorite black and white movies.
I:8440;720;The players all have such talent!
I:8440;721;Bette Davis is one of my favorite actresses, her interesting voice, and the way she carries herself makes her an icon of American Movies.
I:8440;722;This movie shows you why.
I:8440;723;"the basic plot is Ms. Davis is quite a star of Theater
I:8440;724;this movie practically oozes with great insight on life, both in Theater and in general.
I:8440;725;"One of the lines Ms. Davis has become famous for is in this movie, Fasten your seat belts
I:8440;726;The movie is almost worth having just to watch her deliver that line.
I:8440;727;"George Sanders is stunning in this movie
I:8440;728;In fact, I recommend just about any movie with George Sanders in it.
I:8440;729;Any movie with Bette Davis in them are great movies.
I:8440;730;I really love and enjoy these old movies.
I:8440;731;In my opinion, this was Bette's greatest movie!
I:8440;732;I highly recommend it to any Bette Davis fan.
I:8440;733;That might be how maid Thelma Ritter responds to the sob story told by theatre groupie Anne Baxter to Broadway star Bette Davis, but Davis and her friends Celeste Holm, Gary Merrill, and Hugh Marlowe are quite touched.
I:8440;734;One of the real classics of American cinema, All About Eve showcases Bette Davis in her best role, Margo Channing, a star's star.
I:8440;735;The other most memorable performance is by Oscar.
I:8440;736;This is one of Joseph Mankiewicz's best movies.
I:8440;737;and he's the man who brought us The Best Years of Our Lives .
I:8440;738;If you have yet to see this tribute to NY theatre life, drop everything and run to the video store.
I:8440;739;this movie hits #16 on the AFI top movie listing of all time, and it's intriguing that only a few spots above is another movie about an aging female star dealing with the troubles of lost youth.
I:8440;740;toy to keep her company.
I:8440;741;something stage star and the young Anne who latches onto her.
I:8440;742;Her younger boyfriend weathers the storms but gets weary of the tantrums and fits.
I:8440;743;On the other hand, Anne seems sweet, innocent and eager to please at first.
I:8440;744;the acting is brilliant on both parts.
I:8440;745;Bette shines as being intelligent and beautiful, well worthy of the praise she has earned, but also insecure and worried about where life will take her.
I:8440;746;and here we are in modern times, with actresses worrying the exact same thing.
I:8440;747;One would hope that someday we would treasure and crave seeing mature actors and actresses with their vast skills and talents, even though their faces show a little of their history and years.
I:8440;748;I certainly found her outfits to be gorgeous, and her mature beauty to shine through.
I:8440;749;The dialogue is simply brilliant, and several lines in here are ones repeated and quoted in modern culture.
I:8440;750;Bette Davis was wonderful in this movie.
I:8440;751;I also liked her in a pocketful of miracles.
I:8440;752;(Marilyn Monroe also briefly appears, pursuing drinks and powerful men.)
I:8440;753;Eventually Eve reaches prominence, and then has the tables turned on her .
I:8440;754;This is perhaps my favorite or in the top 3 of Bette Davis' movies.
I:8440;755;She was a real actress who played in a very diversified number of movies and was always believable.
I:8440;756;"It made me think of ""A Star is Born"" in many ways or what goes around comes around and one was happy to see justice done in the end."

I:8440;758;Their best friends are the playwright and his wife who keeps writing plays for young females and has Margo playing the parts.
I:8440;759;What makes this movie special is the witty dialog and performances by the stars as well as the direction which focuses in on the actors and their words, not fancy sets or camera work.
I:8440;760;Bette Davis gives the performance of her life as Margo and all are very good.
I:8440;761;It won 6 Oscars and was a huge hit.
I:8440;762;This film represents the end of a time when witty dialogand insightful writing had a chance to make it to the bigscreen.
I:8440;763;bette Davis is superb as the magnificently self.
I:8440;764;Marilyn Monroe as the vapidbeauty and George Sander (who won the Oscar for best supportingactor) are delightful.

I:8440;766;This has to be one of the great classics of witty movie making!
I:8440;767;There are so many wonderful and vitriolic vignettes associated with it.
I:8440;768;The script is clever and the acting superb.
I:8440;769;And who can ever forget that wonderful dress worn by Bette Davis at the party or Eve's beaded cape that features so prominently at the end!
I:8440;770;This is a great movie for anyone who has been deceived by a so called friend.
I:8440;771;it is also great for anyone who feels as though their looks are fading because of age.

I:8440;775;This film is a must for so many obvious reasons.
I:8440;776;A movie that garnered all sorts of Oscars including picture, screenplay and director among others.
I:8440;777;the film tells the story of a group of theatrical friends in New York.
I:8440;778;The center of this circle is Margo Channing (Better Davis), an aging theater actress who is hailed as the greatest that ever performed.
I:8440;779;Lastly is Karen (Celeste Holme), Lloyd's wife and best friend of Margo who wanders in and out of all their lives.
I:8440;780;"Soon Margo ""adopts"" Eve to be her prot g , helping her with day to day items and becoming part of the crowd."
I:8440;781;To make yourself seem innocent is perhaps the greatest performance that Eve gives, even after she makes her way finally to the stage.
I:8440;782;aLL ABOUT EVE is a behind the scenes look at the world of actors and those they work with.
I:8440;783;Director/writer Joseph Mankiewicz has a way with dialogue that few have ever achieved.
I:8440;784;The words that come from their mouths may be given life by the actors, but those words speak volumes in what they have to say about the fragile egos and lust for power and fame.
I:8440;785;The words flow like music and reveal perhaps more than what goes on in the world of the stage.
I:8440;786;The supporting cast does an equally tremendous job.
I:8440;787;the movie is considered a classic by most and it was an enjoyable movie to watch.
I:8440;788;It was indeed well made, acted, directed and written.
I:8440;789;I am glad that I did get the chance to see it finally though.
I:8440;790;Movie fans should all make the trek to find it and watch.

I:8440;795;And newcomers will get a chance to see why some of the older films still have something to offer.
I:8440;796;All About Eve is a sharp, witty, and dark satire about the theatre world and the women who backstab their way to the top only to come crumbling down.

I:8440;802;the script is fantastically witty, full of terrific one.
I:8440;803;The sophisticated screenplay is vividly brought to life by one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled.
I:8440;804;The story is timeless, ripped off by an uncountable number of later films, and the film itself is a classic.
I:8440;805;What a steal of a deal.
I:8440;806;So for a new spin on an old but timeless classic, check out All About My Mother, an intriguing film in its own right.
I:8440;807;Eve (Anne Baxter) is a young woman who is obsessed with the well known and loved actress Margo Channing (Bette Davis).
I:8440;808;Eve's life is a tragic one, and the party of friends immediately bring her into their fold, especially Margo.
I:8440;809;But, eventually, he takes a liking to Eve, who joins them at the airport.

I:8440;812;The end is quite amazing.
I:8440;813;Bette Davis is wonderful in this film.
I:8440;814;The cast, story, settings are all superb.
I:8440;815;It won best picture, director and screenplay (as well as three other awards), and had five acting nominations (George Sanders, who won supporting actor, Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, Thelma Ritter, and Celeste Holm).
I:8440;816;It's a film with some truly wicked dialogue, especially from Sanders, who plays the cad to end all cads.

I:8440;819;The script is flawless and the acting is truly memorable.

I:8440;823;"All About Eve is one of those rare films that will always be one of the best
I:8440;824;After all, the movie won ten oscars, had one of the wittiest scripts of all time, tremendous performances from Bette Davis and George Sanders and an excellent supporting cast including Thelma Ritters, George Sanders and Marilyn Monroe.
I:8440;825;You made such a wonderful Peter Pan.

I:8440;835;even though its a movie, its art imitating life.
I:8440;836;this is a perfect movie on what people will do to make it,and to Be careful what you wish for and also shows what goes around, comes around.
I:8440;837;I would of loved to see Eve get done in and then go crazy when she does, that would of been a great 2nd half.
I:8440;838;But, Hollywood back then knew how much to show and when to end, this movie will keep you wondering.

I:8440;842;George Sanders, Celeste Holm and Gary Merrill shine in the first.
I:8440;843;We were all reminded of this great 1950 film directed by Joseph Mankiewicz when Titanic got all those Oscar nominations!
I:8440;844;Most of the discussions about the film have centered on Bette Davis's comeback in 1950 and, while I can't imagine anyone else playing Margo Channing, this is so much more than a Davis vehicle.
I:8440;845;It is Joseph M at the height of his writing prowess, and an ensemble so perfectly cast (even if they didn't get along), I dare you to try and find a better matched group of six.
I:8440;846;The writing is urbane, witty, crisp.
I:8440;847;especially as Margo ruminates on age and ambition (funny thing about a woman's career.)
I:8440;848;Yes, Celeste Holme and Anne Baxter are magnificent.
I:8440;849;But it's the words that matter here, and the words that stay with you long after the images have receded from memory.
I:8440;850;I vote All About Eve to be the best written screenplay of all time.

I:8440;862;She just put herself right on the showcase and and did it.
I:8440;863;It is the perfect performance.
I:8440;864;The dialogue is so brilliant you just can't help to wonder, how long can a writer take to write this?

I:8440;878;The absolute smartest script during the Golden Age of Hollywood.
I:8440;879;For some reason I had never seen this classic film which won the Oscar for Best Picture.
I:8440;880;In any case her catty Margo Channing is a brilliant portrayal.
I:8440;881;Mankiewicz, who also directed, provides wit, sarcasm and snappy dialog for his actors.
I:8440;882;A modern proponent of this style is certainly Aaron Sorkin.

I:8440;896;How nice for you, how nice for Eve, how nice for everybody!
I:8440;897;One burp and you'll be all rid of that Miss Caswell.
I:8440;898;This film is an example of the superb writing talent that Hollywood boasted before the 80's and 90's (when American filmgoers became addicted to special effects and vulgar physical comedy).
I:8440;899;The casting is perfect .
I:8440;900;The acting business is certainly one of the most competitive, and I can't imagine they all got where they are by being sweet and gentle.

I:8440;902;this film is one of the most flawless Hollywood films ever made and, if you haven't treated yourself to it, by all means, do so immediately.
I:8440;903;Far more eloquent people than I have extolled the virtues of this classic .
I:8440;904;it's not often one can say a movie is perfect, especially one over half a century old .
I:8440;905;It is a perfect fusion of cast, director, and above all, script.

I:8440;908;While Eve represents all the young ing nues that wait in the wings, Margo as played by Bette Davis is a unique and uniquely well rounded and believable character .
I:8440;909;It's no screwball comedy, but rather a superb character study and ensemble piece, which glitters with wit and talent.

I:8440;911;all in all, great movie, great package, highly recommended.
I:8440;912;This story is pretty good because of the actors.
I:8440;913;Bette Davis did such a good job being Margo Channing.
I:8440;914;All About Eve is by far the best performance given by Bette Davis.
I:8440;915;She is far superior as an actress in this role as opposed to her earlier films where she over.
I:8440;916;made in 1950, this film is a classic of the noir genre.
I:8440;917;Directed by Joseph Mankiewicz, this film is packed with complex characters superbly played by the entire cast.
I:8440;918;A seemingly harmless fan, Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) appears night after night to watch her idol perform on the stage and manages to tug at the heartstrings of Margo's best friend played by Celeste Holm who brings Eve, unwittingly, in to the fold of the theatre and Margo.
I:8440;919;She claims to be just a fan with a dream to be on the stage but is content to meet her idol.
I:8440;920;as things progress, Margo hires her on as a personal assistant and reveals intimate details of her personal life.
I:8440;921;the movie culminates with Eve winning a coveted theatre award having only been in one play, much to the dismay of the above mentioned characters.
I:8440;922;the film is beautifully told via narrative of sorts by the theatre critic himself who gives an interesting perspective on the the final outcome.
I:8440;923;You can already see that she is fine.
I:8440;924;the performances are brilliant and you can certainly see why this film had 14 oscar nominations.
I:8440;925;"One of the best ""vixen claws her way to the top"" movies ever."
I:8440;926;"Bette Davis is wonderful as the aging Margo, and Anne Baxter is ""superb"" as her young ambitious nemesis."
I:8440;927;The supporting cast is fantastic as well.
I:8440;928;This is my favorite movie in the whole world so I was super psyched to make it a part of my collection.

I:8440;932;deserving of more praise, in my opinion, are Anne Baxter, George Sanders and Celeste Holm who inhabit their roles in such a way that they are brilliant.
I:8440;933;my favorite moments in the whole film are the post.

I:8440;936;everyone makes the most of the ripe dialogue.
I:8440;937;and another real treat is seeing Marilyn Monroe, shining like a beautiful beacon in a small but cleverly written role.
I:8440;938;So does the film, thanks to some of the wittiest dialog Joseph L. Manckiewicz ever wrote performed by a cast of pros, a brilliantly constructed screenplay and one of Alfred Newman's most appropriate background scores.
I:8440;939;without a doubt, one of the most interesting and perceptive show biz dramas Hollywood ever made.
I:8440;940;I have a thing for black and white/ ol' school movies and this one lived up to my expectations!
I:8440;941;The drama and scheming that comes forth from this movie will leave you on edge.
I:8440;942;If you're unsure about black and white movies, giving this one a try will put you on.
I:8440;943;sheer perfection all around: script, direction, actors, set, costumes, music and makeup.
I:8440;944;It was a fortuitous departure, salvaged by Joseph L Mankewicz commitment to a new project at Fox and his unflinching determination that Bette Davis was in fact right for a part in his new film.
I:8440;945;, this movie is so brilliantly written that 50 years later it continues to hold the top spot on hundreds of critic's all time favorite lists.
I:8440;946;This version of the film also contains a making.

I:8440;950;For as long as I can remember friends, family and even colleagues from time to time bring up this film.
I:8440;951;this is a film that deserves it Classic status.
I:8440;952;This film has a legendary reputation and it certainly lives up to it.
I:8440;953;All the catfights, the backstabbing, the blackmailing.
I:8440;954;The cast is beyond superb and the ending is eerie, but sublime.
I:8440;955;overs keep changing the point of view, but it is always done so perfectly.
I:8440;956;It is truly a cinematic masterpiece that hasn't aged a bit and still revels in all its glory.
I:8440;957;Bette Davis gives an excellent nasty villain performance in this movie.
I:8440;958;Still if you're into villains, you'll love it.

I:8440;964;It's fun to watch, though, and Marilyn Monroe has a brief but funny bit, one of her earliest appearances in film.
I:8440;965;Intelligent, witty dialog makes me wish my mind were that quick.
I:8440;966;Oh, yes, it's in black.
I:8440;967;Even if you are not a Bette Davis fan (I am of course), you should love her performance, she is unique, wonderful, this is a real film, the way movies should be made, with a screenplay, magnificent actors, etc.
I:8440;968;New moviemakers should watch it and learn why movies were so wonderful and films as art are nearly gone, vanished forever.
I:8440;969;Everyone's good here, but this is truly Bette Davis at her best!
I:8440;970;The writing (by Joseph Mankiewicz) is superb, the performances exquisite.
I:8440;971;Baxter gets what's coming to her in an ironic and well.
I:8440;972;crafted ending, featuring the wonderful George Sanders in all his cynical glory.
I:8440;973;this movie is a big juicy slice of the Broadway world of the 1950s, cocktail parties, beds piled high with mink coats, and clouds of cigarette smoke.
I:8440;974;it's interesting to watch the interplay betweeen Davis and her future husband Gary Merrill.
I:8440;975;Also fun to watch is the just.
I:8440;976;in short, a perfect, perfect movie.
I:8440;977;Watch it with lots of popcorn!
I:8440;978;You also have a deliciously evil Ann Bancroft, and Celeste Holms at her radiant best (plus a wonderful glimpse of a young Marilyn Monroe).
I:8440;979;The men are great, too, but this is the ladies chance to shine.

I:8440;984;One of the great acting roles for Bette Davis.
I:8440;985;All about Eve is (along with Sunset Blvd.) my favourite film of that year.
I:8440;986;What makes it so great?
I:8440;987;The ending is one of the best endings ever written on movie history.
I:8440;988;This is a film that trully shows you the circle of life and how the evil that you do returns to you in the end.
I:8440;989;This is also a film dominated by women.
I:8440;990;an american gem: a solid script, a strong cast, a beautiful music score, great production values, a great cinematography and on top of it all, a great director in peak form.
I:8440;991;George Sanders' introduction is beautiful as is his killer to killer final talk with Eve.
I:8440;992;In my opinion one of the best movies ever made!
I:8440;993;A true, true drama in every sense, not just a bunch of people role.
I:8440;994;"To get the most out of the sparkling dialog in ""Eve"" it's recommended you select closed captions."

I:8440;997;All of the roles in the film are played with perfection, George Sanders as the poison pen drama critic almost steals the show from Bette Davis.
I:8440;998;His numerous facial expressions reveal exactly what he is thinking.
I:8440;999;He earned the Academy Award for best supporting actor.
I:8440;1000;Nevertheless, the very young Eve becomes a superb stage actress, superb enough to almost sink Bette Davis.
I:8440;1001;Eve poisons her every relationship but eventually gets her comeuppance, one of the best comeuppances ever.
I:8440;1002;"every single one of the characters in ""All about Eve"" is a cameo, the personalities well defined and with the exception of Eve, the villain in the piece, are immensely likeable."

I:8440;1011;white gem looked excellent to me, and the dialogue.
I:8440;1012;There are a couple of fascinating commentaries, a behind.
I:8440;1013;scenes feature, a look at Bette Davis' career, and so on.
I:8440;1014;can it be exchanged for one that works as it is a part of my best picture Academy Award movies I am purchasing through Amazon?Regards,Phil Embrey
I:8440;1015;I managed to find this a few days before its official release date and am happy to report that it finally gives this classic film the treatment it deserves.
I:8440;1016;"There's a 25 minute ""Backstory"" from AMC that is very informative and entertaining."
I:8440;1017;There arepromotional interviews with Davis and Baxter, four newsreels, a trailer, and a restoration comparison.
I:8440;1018;the restoration comparison is one of the strangest that I've seen.
I:8440;1019;The film itself is a cinematic classic, but the behind the scenes romances, cat fights and cast behavior have grown larger than the film.
I:8440;1020;It has even inspired a book called All About All About Eve (an excellent read).
I:8440;1021;The movie itself is a look at the life of a Broadway star (Bette Davis) and a young ingenue (Anne Baxter) who invades her life and connives her way to stardom herself.
I:8440;1022;The film has quite possibly the smartest, wittiest and mature script ever written.
I:8440;1023;Director and writer Joseph L. Mankiewitz deftly juggles a large cast and wove an interesting and intriguing tale.
I:8440;1024;shrifted and many give the performances of their careers.
I:8440;1025;Ms. Davis revived her career with the role of Margo.
I:8440;1026;Ms. Baxter gives a chilling portrayal of Eve, Thelma Ritter is at her sarcastic best as Margo's assistant and Celeste Holm is elegant as Margo's best friend and early champion of Eve.
I:8440;1027;George Sanders won the best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as the acidic and snarky newspaper critic Addison DeWitt.
I:8440;1028;Mr. Mankiewitz had won the 1949 Oscars for directing and screenplay and became the only person in history to turn that double win in back to back years when he took home the prizes in 1950.
I:8440;1029;The film won the 1950 Best Picture award holds the record for most nominations.
I:8440;1030;"What a great film
I:8440;1031;Joseph Mankiewicz did an excellent job in 1950 of directing this film.
I:8440;1032;Although with this wonderful cast it could not have been too big a challenge.
I:8440;1033;Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill) is in love with her, although eight years her junior.
I:8440;1034;The premise of a relationship between an older woman and a younger man in 1950 was quite out of the norm, but wonderfully done.
I:8440;1035;"He looked it five years ago
I:8440;1036;Quite convincing as the humble, eager to please, employee and friend, Eve fools almost everyone.
I:8440;1037;It takes a bit more time, however for the rest to see her as she truly is.
I:8440;1038;A great movie, a real classic, in a format that must be for all classics!
I:8440;1039;A Book with the movie!
I:8440;1040;What makes a movie memorable?
I:8440;1041;But what makes All About Eve a great film is Bette Davis.
I:8440;1042;Sure she's older than every other female with the exception of Thelma Ritter, but she's still magnetic and sexy.
I:8440;1043;ray transfer is above average and the Blu.
I:8440;1044;This movie is all about human emotion and most of it is in the form of insecurity.
I:8440;1045;All About Eve is the story of one woman's self.
I:8440;1046;All of the cast are excellent in their roles but it is hard not to single out Bette Davis's performance as the highlight of the movie.
I:8440;1047;George Sanders is quite delectably sinister in his role and serves as a sort of gyroscope of emotion in the caldron that Eve creates around her.
I:8440;1048;"Now that I really have seen ""All About Eve"", I will certainly be watching it again and again."
I:8440;1049;His script is brilliant all the way to the last revelation.
I:8440;1050;Well, they do play stage creatures, and Davis' swish thrills the gay community to this day.
I:8440;1051;True, melodrama ruled Broadway, but those funny New Yorkers took it seriously.
I:8440;1052;George Sanders in his greatest cad persona has Anne Baxter's number, while the cast is done in by the prot g .
I:8440;1053;Should watch it once a year.
I:8440;1054;This movie proves karma quite well.
I:8440;1055;The above line, spoken by George Sanders' DeWitt, is just one of the many that populate the most enjoyable listening experience ever done for film.
I:8440;1056;Amazon has a quote page that just hits at the surface of the abundance that are true gems.
I:8440;1057;Eve is the only American film that works so well as an audio presentation because of the snappy dialogue and magnificent delivery from all its participants.
I:8440;1058;The two actors would never appear in a film of such greatness again.
I:8440;1059;I love this movie some real fine acting, nothing like those Good Old Movie,s
I:8440;1060;One of the Best movies ever made.
I:8440;1061;thelma Ritter's expressions and line delivering is one of her best performances.
I:8440;1062;Add to this the scarilty intelligent writings of Mr. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, with a dash of Innocence.
I:8440;1063;sour, supplied by Anne Baxter and George Sanders, and what do you have?The best film ever made in Hollywood, that's what.
I:8440;1064;the genius of 'Eve' is what must be the happiest marriage of Actors to Parts in movie history.
I:8440;1065;Similarly brilliant is the silky George Sanders as the malevolent Addison DuWitt .
I:8440;1066;like voice and perfectly bitter facial expressions are the absolute and perfect traits of the character of DuWitt.
I:8440;1067;they play their parts with gusto, Baxter's malevolence and innocence are shocking in their contrast, and Davis hurls her insults and histrionics with power, while her more tender scenes are heart.
I:8440;1068;Sanders is a gem .
I:8440;1069;the true, real star of 'All About Eve' is the script.
I:8440;1070;It's more than dialogue, it's narrative, depth, and development too.
I:8440;1071;Such a script could so easily have been cumbersome and difficult, but the talents of Davis, Baxter, Sanders, Holm et al make it a terrifically interesting exercise in the power of the spoken word.
I:8440;1072;Listen carefully to Addison's opening speech and be amazed at its depth and intelligence.
I:8440;1073;direction is cursory, and unimportant in such a picture.
I:8440;1074;It's fine, and allows the speech and stars free reign to do whatever they want.
I:8440;1075;I'll cut myself short by saying that each and every performance is at the very least, excellent, and at the very best, amazing.
I:8440;1076;back in 1950, this film garnered numerous and well deserved Oscar nominations, including its win for Best Picture.
I:8440;1077;it's pretty much accepted that this is one of the great ones from the 50's.
I:8440;1078;you can actually read the marquees of the other theaters on west 45th street.
I:8440;1079;the closing sequence were phoebe bows into the mirrors is spin.
I:8440;1080;Joseoph L. Mankiewicz's (writer and director) All About Eve was the perfect movie to usher in the 1950's.
I:8440;1081;Bette Davis has one of her finest moments in this movie as she manages the neat trick of turning the bitchy Margo (very much like Bette Davis' own public persona) into a warm flesh.
I:8440;1082;The party sequences give her the best chance for throwing all of her delicious scenery chewing to beautiful effect (as well as giving the viewer the chance to see the future screen goddess, Marilyn Monroe, showing the darker side of her own future persona).
I:8440;1083;The cast also shines with Celeste Holm, Thelma Ritter, and George Sanders.
I:8440;1084;Anne Baxter is quite adequate, rising above that in the final few minutes of the film.
I:8440;1085;It is a smart film that despite its moments of tender heartedness dazzles most in its cynicism.
I:8440;1086;margo Channing (Bette Davis) is a successful stage actress who is worshipped by small.
I:8440;1087;All well and good, until we (and Margo) realize that perhaps Eve is not all she seems.
I:8440;1088;"All About Eve remains the only film to have two of its stars (Baxter and Davis) nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award (both lost to Born Yesterday's Judy Holliday), and deservedly so
I:8440;1089;"Let's not neglect the men
I:8440;1090;Even thou it is in b/w I exoected a big change in clarity.
I:8440;1091;ray and it was remarkably sharp.
I:8440;1092;Oh it's improved, but it's not all that.
I:8440;1093;Margo Channing (Davis) is among its brightest stars.
I:8440;1094;The calculating Eve Harrington (Baxter) concludes that her single major barrier is Channing so she ingratiates herself with the fading but celebrated Broadway actress, obtaining a position as her personal assistant.
I:8440;1095;weary and cynical theatre critic Addison De Witt, played so well by George Sanders that he also received an Academy Award as best supporting actor.
I:8440;1096;"I also thoroughly enjoy the generally under appreciated Thelma Ritter as Birdie Coonan, a character who possesses what Hemingway described so well as a ""built."
I:8440;1097;She gradually realizes how vulnerable she has become to ambitious young actresses such as Eve who will do whatever it takes to achieve the status and stature which seem to be slipping from her grasp.
I:8440;1098;the film also received and certainly deserved its Academy Award as well as the praise it continues to receive.
I:8440;1099;Bette Davis is malevolent, tender, witty, and always the star in this portrait about the bitchiness and back.
I:8440;1100;directed by the master Joseph L Mankiewicz and starring one of the best ensemble casts ever, All About Eve is electric cinema.
I:8440;1101;George Sanders as Addison de Witt is serpent like in his charm and malice, Celeste Holm is solid as best friend Karen, Gary Merrill excellent as long suffering Bill and Thelma Ritter brilliant as ever as no.
I:8440;1102;The script is the perfect example of mature, witty and incisive dialogue.
I:8440;1103;In the hands (or the mouths) of the actors listed above it is transformed into art.
I:8440;1104;A true American classic and a reminder of what Hollywood could do when it put its mind to it.
I:8440;1105;Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who won best picture, best director and best adapted screenplay Oscars for All About Eve, understood what filmmakers today do not.
I:8440;1106;that cinema is as much a verbal medium as it is a visual one.
I:8440;1107;if you happen to doubt that statement, then consider Eve, which, more than half a century later, is still one of the finest movies ever made, if not the finest.
I:8440;1108;It is a brilliant black comedy, a social satire so scathing it almost leaves burn marks on the projector.
I:8440;1109;but above all, it is a loving and beloved paean to the English language.
I:8440;1110;To savor All About Eve's delicious dialogue, to relish every diabolical twist and turn, is as natural as responding to the visceral thrills in Speed.
I:8440;1111;Eve shows her true colors, however, as she subtly insinuates herself into a group of high.
I:8440;1112;And anyone who dares consider himself a movie fan should thank his lucky stars that it is, for All About Eve may be the most gloriously, decadently, magnificently talky film ever.
I:8440;1113;Mankiewicz, who couldn't write a flat or uninvolving sentence if he tried, is positively drunk on the intoxicating power of the spoken word, and in Eve he wrote a script that, with its pacing, structure, suspense, and razor.
I:8440;1114;sharp wit, remains the standard against which all screenplays are measured.
I:8440;1115;in a cast filled with memorable performances.
I:8440;1116;among them that of Oscar winner George Sanders, as the acerbic theatre critic Addison DeWitt.
I:8440;1117;She's vitriolic and vulnerable, childish and mature, maddening and lovable all at once.
I:8440;1118;and a great woman, we don't doubt it for a second.
I:8440;1119;"The most nominated film (tied with ""Titanic"") with 14 nominations is also my favorite film of all."
I:8440;1120;"The dialogue and script is so ""catty"" that it's great!"
I:8440;1121;The best acted film that I've ever seen with outstanding performances from all the actors .
I:8440;1122;not to mention the strong, believable acting of the supporting cast members.
I:8440;1123;This is an all time favorite classic that should be in any movie lovers collection!
I:8440;1124;this is one of betty's finest movies ever made,as an almost aging actress, see plays at her best, oscar winning material,which include of course the famous one linersfasten yor seatbelts, it is a great movie!!!!!
I:8440;1125;listen close to her words at the end in the car:pure poetry
I:8440;1126;Bette Davis gives her career defining performance as Margo Channing in this film.
I:8440;1127;This film gives a brilliant depiction of the back stabbing and heartache's that go into a play and the Broadway world.
I:8440;1128;George Sanders gives his best performance ever as slimey sneaky Addison DeWitt, the only person in this movie to see through Eve's wall of lies and to confront her about it.
I:8440;1129;Celeste Holm and Gary Merrill are also good in their roles.
I:8440;1130;Thelma Ritter was dazzaling and brilliant in this role and should have won the Oscar that year.
I:8440;1131;This landmark film recieved the most Oscar nominations ever [14].14 Academy Award Nominations including.
I:8440;1132;She gives a stunningly awesome performance.
I:8440;1133;From the Edith Head costumes to Marilyn Monroe's cameo and every single thing in between, this is one of the finest films ever made.
I:8440;1134;Bette Davis' performance is great in this movie.
I:8440;1135;"When it was made, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ""All About Eve"" was the cinematic equivalent of a turn by the Flying Wallendas: audacious, impossibly daring, and exhilarating."
I:8440;1136;It's still all those things, fifty.
I:8440;1137;the detail in the movie is astonishing, and it's all there for a reason.
I:8440;1138;there's plenty more, including the brilliant use of music in the party scene.
I:8440;1139;"The corruscating, glittering surface of this film is only a wrapping
I:8440;1140;Classic film at its best.
I:8440;1141;Bette Davis is magnificent in this film.
I:8440;1142;"(The up and coming ""con Girl"" and her manipulations are so subtly wicked)."
I:8440;1143;time greatest performance(which is,in all fairness, arguable) as the forty year old magnetic actress Margo Channing.
I:8440;1144;"the acting is genuinely excellent and the screenplay is music to the ears
I:8440;1145;Thelma Ritter is hilarious as the wise old companion of Margo's who's seen it all happen before.
I:8440;1146;Celeste Holm gives an absolutely sparkling performance as Karen Richards(she tells Eve I'm the lowest form of celebrity she being the wife of playwright Lloyd Richards(Hugh Marlowe,whose wooden personality suits the role he plays.)
I:8440;1147;"Gregory Ratoff's timing in the bicarbonate of soda scene is amazing and Gary Merrill is right on as the cynical Bill whose age (32) creates insecurity for Margo
I:8440;1148;the film holds up extremely well,considering it will be 50 years old next year.
I:8440;1149;"she is astonishingly straightforward and realistic in her interpretation of the louse
I:8440;1150;If you've never seen this movie, you're in for a treat.
I:8440;1151;this is Mankiewicz's masterpiece and it won the Oscar for the Best Picture of 1950.
I:8440;1152;How many movies nowadays have excellent, witty scripts of the first order?
I:8440;1153;How many movies are extremely and exceptionally marvelous productions all the way around?
I:8440;1154;And as brilliantly collaborated and formed together as Joseph Mankiewicz's All About Eve ?
I:8440;1155;For those of you who do not attend the theater, listen to unsponsored radio programmes, or know anything of the world in which you live, it is perhaps necessary to introduce myself.
I:8440;1156;Margo Channing is a star, a true star.
I:8440;1157;As you can see, the minor awards have already been presented, for the duty of those individuals is to erect a tower so the audience can applaud a light shining on top of it.
I:8440;1158;In flashback, Karen (Celeste Holm) recounts meeting a stagestruck fan of her best friend Margo Channing,(Bette Davis at her eccentric best) a respected Broadway actress.
I:8440;1159;Margo is charmed by Eve, allowing her to come stay with her.
I:8440;1160;to find out All About Eve , see this great dramatic gemstone.
I:8440;1161;It won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Sound Editing, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Supporting Actor (George Sanders in his cynical role as the acid DeWitt) and Best Director.
I:8440;1162;It is truly a classic in every sense of the word and is the closest thing to perfection in cinema.
I:8440;1163;This movie has an all star cast.
I:8440;1164;There is humor, various personalities, users and manipulators, love, confrontations, and of course superb acting.
I:8440;1165;force acting performance, credit most go to the entire cast, who deliver Oscar worthy performances throughout.
I:8440;1166;Gary Merrill who plays Margo Channing's director/boyfriend is the perfect foil, as he manages to match her word for word, engaging each other in a game of callous and acerbic little digs.
I:8440;1167;Sanders was well known to movie goers playing the kind of character who smuggly maintains the upper hand in his typical Maciavellian way.
I:8440;1168;His terrific performance earned him an Oscar for best supporting actor.
I:8440;1169;Also the young and very beautiful Marilyn Monroe in her film debut demonstrates her ability to play the wide.
I:8440;1170;With her ever present, overt sexuality Monroe shows the potential she would realize in subsaquant roles.
I:8440;1171;And what more can we say of her performance.
I:8440;1172;Mago Channing is the role she was positively born to play.
I:8440;1173;This was perhaps the role that defined her as the single greatest screen actress of her generation and a bonifide Hollywood legend.
I:8440;1174;truly this cast examplifies what great ensamble playing is all about.
I:8440;1175;They cue off each other with such skill and precision that I can't imagine anyone else fitting into these rich, juicy roles.
I:8440;1176;"In 1949 Joseph L. Mankiewicz deservedly won a pair of Academy Awards for best screen writer and best director for ""A Letter To Three Wives""."
I:8440;1177;Working with a group of actors as brilliant and ego driven as this veteran crew must have been an incredibly demanding task.
I:8440;1178;Hats off to Mr. Mankiewicz for his stunning direction and his stellar script.
I:8440;1179;And Bravo to this marvelous cast of stars, the likes of which we may never see again.
I:8440;1180;Eve Harrington has come to fame through her admiration of Margo Channing, or was it something besides admiration?All About Eve has won seventeen awards from 1951 to 1952.
I:8440;1181;Betty Davis and Anne Baxter each won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role.
I:8440;1182;Joseph L. Mankiewicz won an Oscar for Best Director in 1950 and Outstanding Directorial Achievements in Motion Pictures in 1951.
I:8440;1183;All About Eve was one of the most successful stories for it's time.
I:8440;1184;Eve was Margo's understudy, who will go to great lengths to achieve stardom.
I:8440;1185;George plays a very clever movie critic.
I:8440;1186;George can keep everyone on their toes at all times.
I:8440;1187;packed with one liners that are classic.
I:8440;1188;I rate this movie a five.
I:8440;1189;Winner of six Oscars, including Best Picture, and #90 on IMDB's list of 250 best films of all time, 'All About Eve' is the story of what happens when a shy, timid ingenue in New York City, Eve (Anne Baxter) manages to get a backstage introduction to her idol, revered (though aging) stage legend Margo Channing (Bette Davis, in many ways playing herself, particularly in this stage of her life and career at the time) .
I:8440;1190;sharp, from beginning to end, the performances (even a fresh.
I:8440;1191;face Marilyn Monroe, in a small role, livens up the proceedings) all Oscar.
I:8440;1192;"but ""the perfect film"" as a whole."
I:8440;1193;What can anyone say to one of the greatest films of all time?
I:8440;1194;"A film steeped in drama, intrigue, and sophistication
I:8440;1195;"This drama is timeless
I:8440;1196;All the performances are superb and it's a film I never tire of watching.
I:8440;1197;that was Bette Davis ever lasting quote.
I:8440;1198;I love all her movies but All About Eve really showcased her talent.
I:8440;1199;She is the actress actress.
I:8440;1200;the script and performances are uniformly excellent.
I:8440;1201;Anne Baxter is good as Eve, but of the main characters I felt her performance was probably the weakest.
I:8440;1202;Look out for a stunning looking Marilyn Monroe (aged only 24 at the time) in a minor role as Miss Caswell.
I:8440;1203;I found it quite mesmerising and strongly recommend it.
I:8440;1204;Everyone in the cast is a wonderful actor and actress.
I:8440;1205;The lines are an art form in themselves.
I:8440;1206;There never was and never will be another movie as good as this, of its type.
I:8440;1207;This movie has it all, witty conversation, love, fine drama and probably the best lines I've ever heard in a movie in my 57 years.
I:8440;1208;Also great development of characters and this movie really works.
I:8440;1209;This is a treasure, a must have.
I:8440;1210;The story of pitchy keen girl who wants to fool everyone with a naive spirit to gets what she wants is just marvelous.
I:8440;1211;For God sake she even fooled the great Bette Davis at the beginning.
I:8440;1212;Talking about the late B. Davis she's so great in this movie, watching her acting you can understand why today there are some people that just don't act, they just pose.
I:8440;1213;This is a great example of how anyone will make anything to get to her goal.
I:8440;1214;Many explanations have been offered for the enduring appeal of this wonderful comedy about the New York theater.
I:8440;1215;The remaining players also to a person shine in their roles.
I:8440;1216;However what usually isn't praised highly enough is the film's remarkably fresh dialogue.
I:8440;1217;Kael traced this film's remarkableness almost wholly to its enduring verbal brilliance.
I:8440;1218;Surely this is what propels the scenes forward with such dash and energy and makes the film not only the indicated treat for repeat viewers but a necessary study for urbane movie makers of the future.
I:8440;1219;Davis is entertaining just to watch.
I:8440;1220;all in all, this well written film is just off the campy scale.
I:8440;1221;The female cast could direct their own performances, and I think they do .
I:8440;1222;Hugh Marlow to a great extent, Anne Baxter, to a lesser one always give the impression that they are Acting.
I:8440;1223;Celeste Holm provides a commonsense best.
I:8440;1224;George Sanders and Thelma Ritter are superb, both being the realists of the cast.
I:8440;1225;Writer/director Joseph L. Mankiewicz' ALL ABOUT EVE (1950, Fox) is probably the best movie ever made about the world of the theatre and those who toil in it.
I:8440;1226;The screenplay here is a masterpiece that even a notoriously picky Bette Davis could find nothing to change.
I:8440;1227;Eve is about to receive a dramatic achievement award at the beginning, but the scene freeze.

I:8440;1231;"in a dream cast, Gary Merrill is Bill Sampson, director of ""Aged in Wood""."
I:8440;1232;if you are watching ALL ABOUT EVE for Marilyn Monroe, she only has two scenes, though she holds her own beautifully with some real heavyweights.
I:8440;1233;"I saw that production in Los Angeles as a college student and was thrilled to see ""Humphrey Bogart's widow"" in person."
I:8440;1234;You may want to save the audio commentaries for another night since they talk over some of the greatest dialogue ever written.
I:8440;1235;A record 14 Oscar nominations for the cast and crew, it is as wicked and sophisticated as they come, with Bette Davis at her eye.
I:8440;1236;swinging best as Margo Channing, Broadway's leading diva.

I:8440;1238;"suffering best friend, Karen Richards, and an ethereally beautiful Marilyn Monroe as Miss Caswell, ""a graduate of the Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts."
I:8440;1239;Joseph Mankiewicz's script and direction are superb, with dialogue so crisp and poisonous, it makes you wonder where script.
I:8440;1240;Chock full of quotable lines, fabulous New Look costumes, and sheer irony.
I:8440;1241;So thick and rich you'll be tempted to eat it with a fork but use a spoon to get every drop.
I:8440;1242;20th Century Fox is one of the best film studios to preserve its old films.
I:8440;1243;sharp script, complicated and believable characters, and flawless direction.
I:8440;1244;it bears repeated viewings, and is remarkably fresh more than a half.
I:8440;1245;The DISC is in good condition.
I:8440;1246;A friend recommended this movie and I'd never seen it .
I:8440;1247;One of the best films I've ever seen .
I:8440;1248;While I wonder if the movie would have been better without the male's voice at the beginning and end of the movie, I can say that this movie is a great movie.
I:8440;1249;It is very much a movie that transcends time.
I:8440;1250;It is one of the finest movies ever made and I really love it.
I:8440;1251;I can't help but think that the story line continues to happen today.
I:8440;1252;the cast is wonderful and if memory serves,I believe this is the movie that introduced Marilyn Monroe.
I:8440;1253;i hope you'll take the time to watch it and you'll love it as much as I do.
I:8440;1254;rated in today's world where good writing and acting simply do not exist.
I:8440;1255;All the cast are wonderful, in particularly, magnificently, Bette Davis gives the performance not only of her career but of anyone's career.
I:8440;1256;In my opinion it's the best example of sublime acting by an Actress in the 20th Century in film or theatre.
I:8440;1257;His Addison DeWitt is a man of supreme intelligence, world weary, urbane to the last degree, insouciant, and just plain mad.
I:8440;1258;thelma Ritter as always delivers a performance guaranteed to steal every scene she is in.
I:8440;1259;Celeste Holme is perfect in her role as the long suffering friend trying to cope with a life in the world of theatre and with Margo Channing in particular.
I:8440;1260;And indeed Ms Davis delivers those line with style and panache and exactly as Margo Channing would.
I:8440;1261;Bette Davis turns on the radio and the director brilliantly uses the music from the radio to exquisitely underscore a brief and inutterably brilliant monologue by Davis.
I:8440;1262;Not just because of the words, which are razor sharp, crafted jewels.
I:8440;1263;the direction, writing, and score are all beyond belief.
I:8440;1264;What a fantastic film .
I:8440;1265;The script is fabulous .
I:8440;1266;the characters are larger than life and the story line is riveting.
I:8440;1267;This is an interesting story about a young woman hanging around a stage door, obsessed with her favorite actress, .
I:8440;1268;which played by Bette Davis, actually wanting to take her place, and all that she has!
I:8440;1269;If this movie isn't required viewing for physiology students, it should be!
I:8440;1270;Besides George Sanders is great in the part of the movie critic, and he and Bette Davis make this movie extra great.
I:8440;1271;The other actors in it, are wonderful too, the whole thing is a real gem of the cinema that should NEVER go out of print!
I:8440;1272;All About Eve is a fascinating look behind the scenes of what it can take(and sometimes what it can do) to people who live inside show business.
I:8440;1273;While it's about Broadway on the surface, it's also a film about Hollywood and what it takes to be the best in the business (And what happens when youth fades and it's time to move over).
I:8440;1274;The cast is super and the dialogue!
I:8440;1275;Davis shines a Margo Channing,the 40ish diva who's about to be stabbed in the back by the poor innocent(read wolf in sheep's clothing)she takes in and trusts.
I:8440;1276;it's a damn good movie!
I:8440;1277;I wasn't yet born when this film premiered, but the story it tells is ageless: the Broadway star who sees her career on the cusp of fading, and is afraid to think about her future, and the scheming fan who seeks to take the star's place.
I:8440;1278;as the star and the fan, Bette Davis and Anne Baxter are wonderful.
I:8440;1279;written film I've ever listened to (you'll find yourself remembering favorite quotes and bits of dialog), and it's acted so well.
I:8440;1280;this is one of the few films I have seen dozens of times.
I:8440;1281;The dialogue in this movie is amazing.
I:8440;1282;D. day: Tomorrow morning you will have won your beach head on the shores of immortality.
I:8440;1283;It's a flawless, brilliant film that was honored with 6 academy awards and was declared number 16 of all time on the American Film Institute's top 100 American movies list.
I:8440;1284;Both women are perfect in their roles, as is most of the cast.
I:8440;1285;the film is a knockout.
I:8440;1286;The script is sheer brilliance from start to finish and is among the greatest scripts ever written.
I:8440;1287;The characters are great, the direction is outstanding and the movie maintains interest the entire time.
I:8440;1288;All About Eve is an outstanding movie, an excellent character study and is certainly a memorable experience with an ending that is just perfect.
I:8440;1289;All About Eve is definitely a film worth seeing.
I:8440;1290;Eve Harrington is a simpleton town girl who comes to the big city looking for resolution to her previous hard lived life.
I:8440;1291;and Eve found Margo Channing, the biggest stage actress of the country.
I:8440;1292;Margo despiter her exceeding talents of stage acting is becoming more and more insecure at her age of 42, and Eve shadowing her did not exactly help.
I:8440;1293;I love this film, and it is cleverly written.
I:8440;1294;Five stars all the way!
I:8440;1295;This is one of Bette's finest films of all time.
I:8440;1296;And one of the finest films by anyone.
I:8440;1297;Even if you are not a fan of B&W you have got to treat yourself to this one.
I:8440;1298;Simply can't be beat for the intelligent and witty script, the superb acting and the flawless direction.
I:8440;1299;Bette Davis' good luck in getting the lead role when Claudette Colbert become ill was our win as well.
I:8440;1300;One of the best movies ever made.
I:8440;1301;An actual movie where people talk to each other.
I:8440;1302;This is a movie that is exciting with magnificent performances.
I:8440;1303;Billy Wilder sparkles with his witty script in this movie, now remastered and repackaged on blu ray, with excellent special features that give some intriguing behind the scenes tattle on the making of this modern classic tale of jealousy, manipulation and scandal.
I:8440;1304;Thanks for the great service.
I:8440;1305;Enjoyed revisiting this marvelous actress.
I:8440;1306;Nice, clear, video, great sound,All About Eve [Blu.
I:8440;1307;All About Eve is a great film.
I:8440;1308;She takes this role and runs with it, delivering each of her lines with sadistic relish.
I:8440;1309;The only one who comes close to matching her is George Sanders, who also gets the lions share of one.
I:8440;1310;But even with the outstanding performances of the two actors, you never get the feeling that this is their movie.
I:8440;1311;The script is one of the best (if at all for the party scene alone) and surpisingly racy for something that came out fifty years ago.
I:8440;1312;The is a thirty minute behind the scenes look that includes interviews with Davis and Baxter.
I:8440;1313;There is a section where you can see the difference between the new cleaned versions too.
I:8440;1314;It was moderatley interesting and most of it went over my head but I'm sure film historians and students will eat it up.
I:8440;1315;this is definitely one for your library and a must for those looking for a great starting point to watching classic film.
I:8440;1316;sharp and witty, the acting is brilliantly performed by everyone, but especially Bette Davis and Anne Baxter.
I:8440;1317;Throw in intriguing characters and an original plot about the darker side of show business and this 1950 Best Picture winner isn't just a best picture for its time, it's a timeless classic that should be required viewing for anyone who likes intelligent scripts and great storytelling.
I:8440;1318;thanks to Blu Ray technology.
I:8440;1319;Every image is very crisp and clear, startling so in most cases.
I:8440;1320;ray] on Blu Ray you know the startling sensation I'm talking about.
I:8440;1321;Her performance is absolutely glossy and in more ways than one.
I:8440;1322;The blu ray book is stylish and attractive and the extras are plentiful and interesting.
I:8440;1323;now it looks like a FILM image.
I:8440;1324;There is such depth and detail now, and that's significant because I have seen this movie about 20 times, and never expected to notice anything new.
I:8440;1325;We're truly seeing that a perfect presentation can improve a masterpiece (and in the case of lesser films.
I:8440;1326;ray even makes an innocuous work into something special).
I:8440;1327;that final thunderous swell at the end will send you off with a smile.
I:8440;1328;"sheet poster anywhere (though it does steal the poster's famous ""arrow"" motif)."
I:8440;1329;I just love the well written dialogue in this great Bette Davis classic!
I:8440;1330;I highly recommend it to all of you who love classic B&W movies.
I:8440;1331;Great acting good acting I love Bette Davis this movie was awesome everybody should watch this movie two thumbs up
I:8440;1332;All about Eve is one of my top three aboslute favorite Bette Davis films.
I:8440;1333;the cast is excellent, every single line is delivered perfectly and the cinematography is wonderful.
I:8440;1334;If you are a lover of plays, black and white films, or just love satires about the theater and the movie making business.
I:8440;1335;this film is for you!
I:8440;1336;i value brevity and unwasted words but I must submit these 10 more to enter my review.
I:8440;1337;Channing is a near middle aged but very successful actress in New York.
I:8440;1338;Soon, she is a big hit and Margo starts to drift toward obscurity.
I:8440;1339;"and the truth about her ""girl from next door"" background are revealed by venomous play columnist Addison DeWitt (George Sanders, also superb)."
I:8440;1340;and, although it is sort of [bad], I liked the ending.
I:8440;1341;i can also tell you that this movie is great as straightforward entertainment.
I:8440;1342;It is written with wit and humor when it needs to be.
I:8440;1343;"Particularly memorable is Miss Caswell's (A young Marilyn Monroe) line about the producers: ""Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?"""
I:8440;1344;Joseph Mankiewicz's dialogue in All About Eve is razor sharp.
I:8440;1345;Bette Davis' superb rendering of New York stage legend Margo Channing is perhaps the most memorable of her brilliant career.
I:8440;1346;tongued drama critic Addison DeWitt, played by George Sanders in a role which won him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.
I:8440;1347;veined opportunistic Eve Harrington, played with perfect fidelity by Anne Baxter.
I:8440;1348;Gary Merrill is excellent as Bill Sampson, director and lover of Davis who intercepts a pass tossed at him by Baxter, who has masqueraded as a loyal fan and friend of the star's.
I:8440;1349;in the publicity jockeying pertaining to All About Eve, and with both stars being nominated in the Best Actress category, Davis made the comment that Baxter should have been nominated in the Best Supporting Actress category instead.
I:8440;1350;There, I've told you .
I:8440;1351;time acerbic look at Broadway and stardom.
I:8440;1352;Joseph L. Mankiewicz's writing and direction was never better and the stars were at the top of their game.
I:8440;1353;The blu ray picture is gorgeous and makes this an even more fun ride.
I:8440;1354;This is Hollywood at its best.
I:8440;1355;"This movie classic is great whether it was seen decades ago and is being reviewed or if it is new to a generation that has yet to ""fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night""."
I:8440;1356;The aging, insecure Broadway star and the young ingenue who wants to BE her are still convincing, entertaining and worth another view.
I:8440;1357;This was my favorite Christmas present in 2008 and I first saw it in the 70s.
I:8440;1358;This Broadway story was ironically in the same oscar year as the equally long.
I:8440;1359;to be enjoyed now and to be shared with future generations!
I:8440;1360;This is one of my favorite movies of all time!
I:8440;1361;"After viewing ""Sunset Boulevard"" for the first time, I wanted to see what movie stole it's Best Picture Oscar."
I:8440;1362;I also wanted to see why Bette Davis won the Best actress oscar over Gloria Swanson.
I:8440;1363;As far as the cinematography is concerned.
I:8440;1364;"Of all movies, ""All About Eve"" holds the record for most nominations?"
