1;It's also an excellent trip through the 60s, 70s and 80s, and a great way to spend a couple of hours, and you'll think about it after it's over.
2;Pure and simple, it's a great movie.
3;to embody such an improbable being takes acting genius, and Paul Giamatti delivers an Oscar caliber performance.
4;something of a minor miracle.
5;You may go your whole life without ever meeting people like this, (and you'd probably be happier as a result), but you will care about them, and cheer their triumphs .
6;this is a rare, bizarre, and thoroughly enchanting film.
7;Longtime fans of Harvey Pekar (I was turned on to the American Splendor books as a college student in 1987) will absolutely love this!
8;Very faithful to the original and to Harvey Pekar and what he stands for.
9;I've always visualized James Earl Jones or Louis Gossett Jr. in that role.
10;but the film as a whole works as the story of the triumph of the common everyday working man in spite of himself.
11;"You'll recoil at the exploitation of Toby the nerd (his identifying with the comedy ""Revenge of the Nerds"", a scene straight from the AS books, is funny, sad, and touching at the same time), and you'll cheer as Harvey ""socks it"" to David Letterman and his audience."
12;read the American Splendor Anthology, see the movie (more than once), laugh, think, and enjoy.
13;"Creating something real, unreal, familiar yet completely original
I:20062;14;With brilliant casting, stunning script work and truly remarkable craftsmanship, `American Splendor' will definitely be an unforgettable cinematic experience.
I:20062;15;who ever thought that comic books could be so influential?The life of comic book hero Harvey Pekar is told with vivacious tenacity in this multilayered biopic that exposes his human personality as well as his alter ego.
I:20062;16;thanks to some inspired casting, this film nails just about every punch.
I:20062;17;capturing this man in all variations of his persona (and brilliantly meshing with the `real' Pekar who appears in the film as well as the animated versions), Giamatti is a full.
I:20062;18;figured representation of a truly inspired characterization.
I:20062;19;He understands the lows, the highs and everything in between, completely realizing his characters potential.
I:20062;20;as a whole I strongly recommend this film to any fan of the biopic, the human drama, the dramedy, Giamatti or comic books.
I:20062;21;uGH, I recommend it to everyone since this is really what cinema is all about.
I:20062;22;Thus was born the legendary American Splendor comic book series.
I:20062;23;around loser catch on with the comic.
I:20062;24;pekar himself narrates this biopic and a few of the actual folks depicted here appear occasionally.
I:20062;25;this movie did make me laugh, cry and think.
I:20062;26;american Splendor is the (basically) true story of Harvey Pekar.
I:20062;27;He's with some friends, when they introduce him to a strange looking guy named Rob Crumb.
I:20062;28;He's a bookish type, who is also into jazz records, and comic books so they hit it off.
I:20062;29;After a hilarious scene in a a grocery store, Harvey thinks 'I'll just write a comic about the stuff in my life.
I:20062;30;'This movie used a couple things to get a four star rating: innovation, heart, and of course, the disc itself.
I:20062;31;This was a great idea, because you feel 'wow, harvey was real, his life did suck, his wife joyce was crazy, etc.' You don't see a lot of biopics where the actors are actually being 'directed' by the people that lived it.
I:20062;32;it's got heart, as I said, because of it's bold faced truth, and simplicity.
I:20062;33;The film makers captured so much feeling.
I:20062;34;For a one disc set, and not even a 'special.
I:20062;35;We have Harvey Pekar, his wife, Joyce Brabner, his best friend (and funniest character) Toby Radloff, their daughter Danielle Batone, Paul Giamatti who plays Harvey, the directors, and eventual Judah Friedlander (who I recognized from I love the 80's.
I:20062;36;A good movie that deserved some credit, about a guy who never got enough.
I:20062;37;I really love this movie.
I:20062;38;I'm a huge comic nerd and I've been writing and illustrating my own since I was old enough to hold a pencil.
I:20062;39;His performance in this is as good as it's ever been and I love to see him as the leading man instead of just in a supporting role.
I:20062;40;The characters are so likable and the ending is so rewarding.
I:20062;41;I highly recommend it to anybody into nerd culture, the art scene, independent movies, documentaries, biopics, or fans of dark comedy.
I:20062;42;I'm not a comic book fan or reader whatsoever and I went into this film with some trepidation, but after seeing it I can't help but call it a great movie.
I:20062;43;Never wholly good or bad, just life from an honest and gritty perspective a la Charles Bukowski.
I:20062;44;For the real fans there are even several spots with the writer himself in this sometimes comic book movie.
I:20062;45;the casting is rather good with Giammati in the lead and Hope Davis as his forceful but understanding wife.
I:20062;46;Giammati is a cross between Vincent D'Onfrio and Nick Tortelli (Carla's husband)from cheers (whatever his name is) and is always a believable force on the screen.
I:20062;47;The rest of the supporting cast are great stock characters and mirror the real life entities which encompassed Pekar's life.
I:20062;48;A good alternative to the typical Hollywood big.
I:20062;49;He is the perfect casting for this character.
I:20062;50;This is a small gem and it's well worth watching.
I:20062;51;American Splendor is a terrific film, and easily one of the best of 2003 (though that's not saying much).
I:20062;52;It tells the story of Harvey Pekar, famous in comic book circles for starting the American Splendor series.
I:20062;53;I can't answer for that, but I can say that I enjoyed this film very much.
I:20062;54;He's got the perfect hang.
I:20062;55;Hope Davis is also very good as Pekar's equally strange wife.
I:20062;56;This film got a lot of attention for its unconventional approach to story telling, using animation and documentary.
I:20062;57;As is, it's good, but it's fairly conventional.
I:20062;58;I mean this guy was just depressed about life, boo hoo Im a under paid worker, too cynical and sadistic for my taste, but in all for the representation of comic books and American splendor in particular, a great well deserved high opinionated movie.
I:20062;59;dayum I hope I never go through this and feel as this man did.
I:20062;60;This is really a great film about Harvey Pekar, the underground comic book writer who created the comic book series """"American Splendor""""."""
61;The movie basically takes you from the end of Harvey's second marriage up to the point of his retirement as a file clerk.
62;He has a moment of clarity one day while waiting in line at the grocery store behind a woman who is arguing over why she should pay 1.50 for six glasses that are marked two dollars, when he thinks of a way to strike out at all of this .
63;He comes up with the narrative, but is only able to show stick figures as the actual characters in the drawings.
64;"Harvey's big break is that he has become friends with underground comic Robert Crumb before Crumb was famous and the two were just a couple of ""ordinary"" guys looking for bargains at Cleveland rummage sales."
65;"Crumb is impressed with the statement Harvey is trying to make and agrees to do the illustrations, thus the comic ""American Splendor"" is born."
66;to me, the best part of this movie is the love story between Harvey and his third wife Joyce.
67;Because neither one wants to change the other, the relationship works.
68;the film is really cleverly done, with comic book illustrations showing what Pekar is thinking in various situations along with narration and a couple of interviews with the actual Pekar and his wife interspersed throughout the film giving it a real feeling of authenticity.
69;"Paul Giamatti is simply marvelous as the caustic ""warts and more"" Harvey Pekar."
70;His performance is that good.
71;"Giamatti certainly deserves better than playing supporting roles in films like ""Big Fat Liar""."
72;Kudos also to James Urbaniak for his small role as artist and illustrator Robert Crumb.
73;For the small amount of time he is on the screen he really captures the essence of the guy.
74;"The average American doesn't know the name Harvey Pekar, the star of ""American Splendor,"" but the drawings of his comics are very recognizeable as the style of cartoonist Robert Crumb, the ""keep on truckin'"" guy."
75;The film uses an interesting technique of interspersing footage of the real life Pekar and the people in his life, which is successful since he is such a colorful character.
76;This film rates as one of the most creative and playful I've ever seen.
77;The way the two versions of Harvey play off each other and the way his comic and his real life intertwine is pure genius.
78;Paul Giamatti is at his finest.
79;one of the more unusual features of this unusual movie about an unusual man has Pekar writing for his comic book commenting on Paul Giamatti's performance as Pekar.
80;This movie is quite unpredictable and as such is quite unlike anything that you have ever seen before.
81;All I heard from people was how good this film was.
82;Over the last few year Paul Giamatti has really been one of our best actors.
83;It's a biopic based on a true story, and so much more.
84;More quirky than anyone is Tony Randolff, a self proclaimed nerd, and a plutonic friend of Harvey's.
85;It's a great story, with great writing in and itself, but it's much more unusual that the typical great movie.
86;We can see how honestly the characters are played, unlike most biopics where we trust that the characters are played the way they were or are in life.
87;This is a fun, sometimes dark, and always fascinating look at the life of someone many have never heard of before.
88;Last decade one of my favorite documentaries was Crumb, and so far this decade American Splendor is one of my favorite films period.
89;Yes I seem to be totally engross by the lives of quirky comic book writers and authors even more than the comics they write.
90;This is an interesting movie that is part biography, part comedy, and part drama.
91;He has always loved comic strips and music records and developed an extensive collection.
92;He meets Robert Crumb, a big name in the indie comic book series and becomes good friends with him.
93;Harvey gets Crumb to draw his comics while he writes the storyline that is based on his life.
94;A woman that loves his comics develop a relationship with him when they meet and she moves in.
95;His life is indeed strange and fascinating and while many bad things happen to him personally, his ability to keep going with his plucky, curmudgeon attitude is an engaging subject.
96;A chance meeting with a greeting card artist and future underground comic legend Robert Crumb develops in to a long.
97;standing friendship through their similar interests.
98;No superheroes here, but more of a realistic portrayal of his own life, warts and all.
99;Soon he develops cult fame, and meets his future wife, Joyce, a comic book storeowner from Delaware.
100;one of the things I really enjoyed about this movie was the inclusion of the real Harvey Pekar and other people in his life, such as his wife, Joyce, and his very odd friend, Toby Radloff.
101;It allows for a comparison between the actors playing the characters and the real life people those characters are based on.
102;What was most interesting to me was how much Paul Giamatti got into the character of Harvey, from physical appearance, speech, dress, attitude, and even mannerisms.
103;One of my favorite scenes is one where Harvey discusses the peculiarity of his name, and how odd it was that he found a couple of other people in the phonebook who shared his name.
104;presented in a wide screen format, the movie looks great.
105;Also included are a plethora of extras, including a reprint of a comic insert Harvey Pekar created for Entertainment Weekly, a group commentary including the real Harvey Pekar, a featurette, and a few hidden items that aren't too hard to find.
106;(The one with the real Toby Radloff is great.)
107;For most of the film, Paul Giamatti portrays Pekar .
108;Harvey Pekar's comic book, American Splendor pioneered a new genre: the autobiographical comic book.
109;Fortunately, filmmakers Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman are able to take what was funny, heart.
110;breaking and fascinating about Pekar's life and successfully adapt from the panels on the page to the big screen.
111;in a nice touch, a mini.
112;the disc itself features an engaging audio commentary with the real Harvey Pekar, his wife Joyce, their daughter Danielle, his friend Toby Radloff, filmmakers Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman, and actor Paul Giamatti.
113;Everyone has a lot of fun on this track as they joke and reminiscence about the film and their experiences.
114;Road to Splendor is a brief update on what Harvey has been up to since the film was made.
115;american Splendor has the same ironic sense of humour and melancholy as Ghost World, another excellent cinematic adaptation of an independent comic book.
116;American Splendor stays true to Pekar's vision.
117;it refuses to sentimentalize his life, even at the film's emotional conclusion which is genuinely moving.
118;It is one of the finest comic book adaptations ever put on film because it remains true to its source material and wisely involves its creator in the process of transferring his story from the page to the screen.
119;I can imagine the excitement for a reviewer who encountered this strange film that seems intent on violating every rule of screenwriting 101.
120;He is, fundamentally, a boring man who remarkably chooses to share his life, warts and all with the consumers of comic books.
121;And as we all know, this movie was near the top of most reviewers' lists of best films for 2003.
122;i enjoyed the film, especially the use of creative graphics that convey the art form represented by comics.
123;And to my delight, the film makers captured that effort with style and originality.
124;Those who are fans of Harvey Pekar's comics will surely enjoy this film.
125;If you're feeling angsty about your station in life, but don't really have the motivation to do anything about it, you'll probably feel a bond with the Harvmeister.
126;in short, this film has an interesting concept and very good acting.
127;The film intersperses the drama with real interviews with Pekar, his wife and colleagues, along with animated comics.
128;In my opinion this was one of the best films out there.
129;Beautifully shot, written, and acted.
130;I love this movie so much that I don't eve care that people didn't get it.
131;You eke out an anonymous existence in ratty apartments at a clerk job at the V. a. hospital, submit ideas for stories about your seemingly mundane life (you can bearly draw a straight line)for an underground comic book and they make a classic movie about you.
132;pulcini and Berman imaginatively tell Harvey's story through interesting devices such as through traditional actors, actual participation by the real.
133;At one point in the film the real Harvey Pekar is talking and you can see the actor playing him, Paul Giamatti, laughing in the background.
134;life person appear in the same film as you but Giamatti is such a consummate actor that he is more than up to the task.
135;Also providing excellent work here are Hope Davis as Harvey's soulmate, Joyce, and Judah Friedlander as Toby, a nerdy co. worker(and proud of it)of Harvey's.
136;"In a perfect world this film should have enjoyed greater box office acceptance than it did like, say, a lesser independent film like ""Napoleon Dynamite""."
137;I have attempted to recommend this film to other people and it's usually met with a shrug.
138;His comics, though, make him a kind of hero to average suffering folks and even bring him a little family by the end of the film (his wife, Joyce Brabner, is wonderfully played by Hope Davis).
139;cultural, but it is reassuring all the same.
140;pic conventions to relate their story, with varying degrees of success.
141;all in all, a very entertaining, interesting film with wonderful performances.
142;Certain key characters also appear as themselves during the film.
143;It's mostly told with actors, but sometimes we get to meet the real Harvey and his friends and family.
144;The amazing thing is that the approach never seems gimmicky or self.
145;There's never a moment during Paul Giamatti's astounding portrayal of Harvey that we doubt his authenticity, and we aren't disoriented in the least when the real Harvey shows up.
146;"the Harvey Pekar story, as told in ""American Splendor,"" is deeply moving."
147;What separates him from so many of his bretheren, though, and quite possibly saves his life, is that he finds an outlet when he chooses to document his life in comic.
148;One one hand, this decision leads to his status as an underground hero, Letterman regular, and movie subject.
149;"These are people who matter, and they deserve their voices, and ""American Splendor"" lets them speak, with enormously entertaining results."
150;"i love movies like ""American Splendor."""

156;His gift is the ability to simplify complex life problems and convey them in his cartoon text.
157;He is honest with his film audience when he states that he made the flick for some extra 'change' to help him thru his retirement.
158;Does Hollywood come out and tell you to see a movie so they can afford to fly their private jets to their private vacation islands in the south Pacific?
159;Hollywood folks always talk about their 'art' .
160;This is a story of a real antihero, and is a story the rest of us should pay attention to.

162;What a great adaptation of comicbook author Harvey Pekar's unusual autobiographical ouvre.
163;amazing how actor Paul Giamatti looks more like the comicbook version of Pekar than the real Pekar himself does.
164;Now, that's great casting! )

166;something to justify watching it).
167;Pekar continually mopes through life, ignoring everything uplifting and hopeful around him.
168;It manages to be both stylistically daring and genuinely touching.
169;Harvey Pekar is such a fantastic protagonist because he's so heartbreakingly ordinary.
170;end job, Harvey decides to turn his humdrum life into a comic book, and ends up becoming a cultural icon that ordinary people everywhere can relate to.
171;His romance and marriage to Joyce is one of the most touching and heartwarming screen romances I've seen in a long time.
172;air argument with Letterman is one of the most intense scenes in the film).
173;The film brilliantly combines the fictionalized story of Harvey, portrayed by actors, with real footage of the people being portrayed, as well as animation inspired by the comic book.
174;In the process, the ordinary people portrayed become fascinating, hilarious and endearing.
175;Hard to believe that this is an HBO film.
176;"has the emotional feel of one of those old ""beat"" movies from the late 50's or '60s."
177;The theme, however is perfect: about being a down and out misfit stuck in a dead end job, yet having an imagination that far excedes the role in life you've been given.
178;super hero his own underground comic book.
179;yet never quite rescuing him from the drudgery of his life turned art. . . Half documentary, have biopic, the film has a really cool look and feel (great bluesy and boppish Jazz soundtrack) .
180;The blend of Paul Giamatti's acting (a rare casting for him as a lead, despite his memorable face and roles) and the real Harvey Pekar's narraration (and on screan appearence) is great.
181;The rest of the ensemble as well as the script is incredible too as well as the quick cut method.
182;if you don't believe me, just ask a certain genuine NERD from Cleveland.
183;when the nerd supposes he sees himself reflected in the 1980s film Revenge of the Nerds, Harvey produces a brilliant deconstruction of the film.
184;"for genuine and practical reasons, Pekar struggled for years as a writer and critic to break out of the marginal ghetto that is represented by comics and into a more renumerative line of work such as movies

I:20062;186;It's warm, it's funny, it's sad, it's about hospital people most people won't recognize, it's about a time when you could have a safe job, show up and do it, and then go home again.
I:20062;187;And it's about real people doing real art.
I:20062;188;It makes fun of snotty academics and sarcastic TV talk show hosts.

I:20062;192;Illustrations are crafted by underground comic artists such as the legendary Robert Crumb, a personal friend of Harvey's which he met back in the early 60's in Cleveland.
I:20062;193;Everything which happens to Harvey's life has the potential to become comic book material.
I:20062;194;as soon as the comic books hit the street they become a major sensation, and do a great deal to help Pekar's personal life.
I:20062;195;Through his own gloomy vision of the world which sorrounded him, Pekar was able to generate a very refined form of dark humor which conquered a series of fans throughout the nation.
I:20062;196;One of these fans ended up becoming his loving wife, Joyce Brabner.
I:20062;197;Giamatti demonstrates great easiness in playing the self.
I:20062;198;Both share these common personality traits, which Giamatti so authentically delivers through his acting.
I:20062;199;Both Paul Giamatti and Hope Davis, in addition to their phenomenal acting skills, are aslo very noticeable for their physical similarities to the original Harvey Pekar and Joyce Brabner.
I:20062;200;another strong point which comes to the aid of this motion picture is its cartoon.

I:20062;202;Animated drawings of Harvey himself interact with Paul Giamatti's character, a graphic resource which adds much credibility and interest to the picture as a whole.
I:20062;203;with an interesting solid plot and grandiose acting by Paul Giamatti, """"AMERICAN SPLENDOR"""" is destined to become a cult classic."""
204;It is one of those movies which so brilliantly deals with the weaknesses of human character and the possibilities of turn.
205;The movie also shows the real people in Harvey's life and then switches back to the actors playing them.
206;It uses a lot of comic book drawings and animation in the film too.

208;class everyman type of guy.
209;But in an odd way, it's still interesting.

212;This film is a proof that each life is interesting, important, and unique .
213;you can make a masterpiece of your own life, your daily routine and your own misery.
214;American Splendor reminds in this regard Woody Allen's comedies but it is a very original and stylish film.
215;"Giamatti and Davis are absolutely brilliant
I:20062;216;pekar's cartoons have had a cult following for a while and take the form of autobiography, an autobiography of a common man, an """"everyman"""", and the annoyances of everyday modern life which he encounters."""
217;The comics are done in somewhat of a tongue.
218;cheek, insightful and some times a sarcastic style of humor that elevates the boredom and misery of life to an almost mystical perspective.
219;the film takes us from his youth, his friendship with R. Crumb, his love of old Jazz, the relationship with his wife, his day job as a filing clerk at the local hospital VA and the nuts and bolts of his work as an underground cartoonist where Harvey where we see him writing the dialogue and drawing stick figures that are later elaborated on by various artists (including Crumb).
220;"Also followed in this movie is his sudden success when he is ""discovered"" , his bout with cancer and the adoption of their daughter."
221;it gives a character sketch of someone to whom life has not exactly been kind but we also get the feeling that Pekar has done a good job sabotaging himself all along the way.
222;the movie is done in a very creative style with Paul Giamatti playing Pekar through out the movie with Pekar himself showing up in and out of the movie in interviews on the set and film clips of his appearances on the Leterman show as well as some animation and of course close ups of some of the cells of Harvey's comics.
223;the casting of Giamatti was perfect and the actor pulls off the portrayal of Pekar supurbly and with ease.
224;the portrayal of the blossoming relationship with his wife is particularly touching and is quite sentimental for a guy who seems to take pride in being anything but sentimental.
225;his struggle with cancer is told with honesty and in it we see our anti.
226;hero as someone who is quite heroic.
227;a very entertaining movie about a real character.
228;comic book which I found quite delightful.
229;I know the story of HARVEY PEKAR and found this movie fascinating.
230;The BLENDING of REAL LIFE and COMICS was well done.
231;One can be popular, talented, beautiful, smart, rich, or whatever, but the reality is that all of us have this weird sense of insecurity about almost every aspect of our lives, that often makes us behave awkwardly or, in Harvey Pekar's case, become hostile.
232;"Having just watched Paul Giamatti's acting prowess in Alexander Payne's excellent ""Sideways"" three times, and with Terry Zwigoff's movie ""Ghost World"" (which I must have seen a dozen times already) being a wonderful and quietly tragic movie based on an underground comic book, I was prepared to enjoy a movie that seemed right up my alley."
233;"another reason is that in ""Ghost World,"" I found it easier to sympathize and empathize with the characters."
234;That's his great big revelation?
235;That's a pretty huge chunk taken out of his life.

238;At his fingertips, any time he wanted to lunch with them at the cafteria or share a coffee at the canteen, he could have given the world a treasure trove of stories of our many heroes, a few cowards, some braggarts, a few saints and quite a few sinners.
239;"with ""well, it really doesn't matter."
240;This is good movie for the right audience.
241;It seems to appeal to those who like the comic (I bought one anthology and will get more), like 70's types of slice.
242;life movies, Seinfeld small talk, or just remember the Letterman appearances.
243;What's clear is the directors had a great desire to make this movie.
244;Paul Giamati is very good as Harvey.
245;Hope Davis is excellent as Joyce and really adds to the movie.
246;And they all make you like them more and like the movie more.
247;It says something good that way.
248;Joyce's capsule comments about people (including Letterman) are very funny and true.
249;The real Letterman clips are a neat and clever addition to the movie.
250;They would bring out Harvey and the whole game would be to tease his bulldog personality and watch the give and take with him and Dave.
251;It was funny yet dangerous.
252;But the movie is kinda touching and has a real feel, even with that somewhat nasty edge.
253;Meeting Joyce is oddball stuff and still likable and funny.
254;So much going on underneath that it comes out odd but true.
255;But the movie does have a honest feel.
256;It wants to get at something real.
257;Sounds likethey all had fun and they were all interesting.
258;And themusic is quite good too.
259;"American Splendor does a masterful job of blending the real with the ""reel,"" as we see Harvey Pekar and his real life family and friends on one hand, and the actors who portray them on the other."
260;Wonderful editing, acting and special effects make this a great film which is both fun to watch and an interesting portrait of an unconvential, fascinating man.
261;Then imagine a movie about said acquaintance, and you will have captured the essence of American Splendor.
262;Harvey Pekar is just such a hero.
263;The acerbic comic author here offers the audience exactly what makes his comic of the same name so special, a window into the life of the every man, with all the pain and foibles that go with it.
264;all of the performances here are excellent, though Giamatti and Davis deserve special mention for their wonderful portrayals.
265;They bring these people to life.
266;The director's interesting technique of placing Pekar as a commentator on his own life keeps the film from slipping into melodrama and keeping the distance that gives the comic is powerful perspective.
267;Harvey's humor is much here in evidence, even when his life dips towards tragedy and that is the rock on which this excellent film rests.
268;Some may find the intimacy of the film uncomfortable, but given the tendency of modern film to often flatten life, I found it wonderfully refreshing.
269;harvey Pekar, refreshingly unspoiled by is better than 15 minutes of fame, is a treat that every viewer should enjoy.
270;On it's own this film is a classic.
271;It is honest and real.
272;They communicate each others characters very well.
273;The daily grind many of us experience is portrayed accurately.
274;The film captures all this.
275;But it's not nearly as strange or sad I expected, it's actually quite funny and surprisingly straight.
276;Paul Giametti and Hope Davis are both excellent and the real life Harvey Pekar and Joyce Brabner are also wonderful to watch.
277;This movie turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen this year.
278;This movie is a combination of a docudrama and a black comedy.
279;And the real Harvey narrates about how weird it is to be watching the movie of this scene.
280;In another scene, you can't believe Harvey and Toby are as weird as they seem, until the actors walk out of the movie onto the set, and you see the real Harvey and Toby interacting, and the actors are watching them.
281;Joyce and Harvey's date is hysterical.
282;And in the end, it all comes full circle, when Harvey writes a comic book about making the movie.
283;It has been a long time since I have seen such a smart, engaging, moving, spryly written, wryly funny movie.
284;A great story and a great film!
285;"Got it for him for a gift
I:20062;286;Well, the plot deals with a seedy comic.
I:20062;287;book man and his series of seedy breakups with his seedy girlfriend in his seedy neighborhood.
I:20062;288;(writhing lunatic fan of this film to press NO on the Was.
I:20062;289;A film by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini""""American Splendor"""" is a rather peculiar movie, though a fairly good one."""
290;American Splendor is about the life and times of Harvey Pekar.
291;The comic is about real life: specifically the real life of Harvey Pekar himself.
292;This movie is an adaptation of the comic, so it is a film about a comic about a real man.
293;"With that in mind, ""American Splendor"" mixes several styles of film narrative."
294;There is also a documentary style to the film as it moves from a movie scene to the real Harvey and the real Joyce being interviewed.
295;While these styles, perhaps, should not work in the film, they do and rather well at that.
296;This sends him into a funk, but he meets a man named Crumb who is a talented artist and eventually becomes successful and famous.
297;this was a surprisingly interesting film, and it worked more successfully than I expected.
298;It will not make my list of top ten films, but it was good and had some excellent performances (Giamatti should have been recognized by Oscar for this one).
299;"I'll recommend this one with the ""Good stuff"" rating."
300;It's not great, but it is good.
301;Everyman is your average man.
302;that said, this was a terrific film.
303;Giammati was amazing as Pekar, and really captured his essence on film.
304;And if we wondered how well he did so, the film showed us the real Harvey Pekar, and the real people that surrounded him.
305;found fun in mocking him.
306;i was so pleasantly surprised to see all of the real life characters represented so accurately.
307;Rarely does a film do this.
308;This brought us into his world, into his house, into his mind, into his soul.
309;frankly, while Giammati is receiving well deserved accolades for his performance in Sideways, this was the defining performance of his career.
310;American Splendor may be one of the best movie adaptations of a comic book that I have ever seen.
311;This movie is based on that comic book AND the guy's real life.
312;All of the actor's real.
313;Paul Giamatti gives a great performance as Pekar.
314;The movie is very funny and very innovative in the way it merges live.
315;I'm normally a big fan of small, non.
316;hollywood movies, but I also like my movies to have a plot, a theme or for the love of god, something happening.
317;"takes"" of him between narrations, a comic book Harvey Pekar between some scenes, and the wonderful Paul Giamatti acting out certain scenes from this bleak and dreary life."
318;If you are a fan of Harvey Pekar, you'll probably enjoy seeing this.
319;I had read the comic books, never thought much of them, but I didn't realize until seeing the movie that Harvey and his wife are genuinely heroic.
320;Here she gets a meaty, anti.
321;I admired this film a great deal .
322;written and acted, and a great peek into the world of both comics and blue.
323;I was anxious to see the film and again, I enjoyed it, but I think the real sense of freshness and discovery will be reserved for those who never heard of Pekar or American Splendor.
324;American Splendor, its title ironic, is a clever journey through the life and loves of comic Harvey Pekar.
325;David Letterman described him, ironically, as living the American Dream.
326;Splicing both real footage and fictitious posturing as well as the real Harvey and his colorful comic strip, American Splendor is a film that is unlike any other.
327;and enjoy the ordinary life.
328;Together Pekar and Crumb brought Pekar's life into the world of comics as an anti.
329;heroic comic book, which essentially uses ordinary people around Pekar that emphasizes their unique talents in a superhuman manner.
330;documentary, which brings humor, drama, tragedy, and whatever else life has to offer to the silver screen through the personification of Harvey Pekar.
331;This double performance enhances the story as it brings a dual image of Harvey, the personal depiction, as well as an outsider's perspective of Harvey's identity.
332;the films ordinarily depiction of an odd character is unique as it develops into an interesting character study of a real character.
333;Through the pessimistic Pekar the audience gets to be subjected to a wonderful cinematic experience that offers several thoughtful and humorous life lessons.
334;But it made it onto countless top ten lists, and I never heard anything bad about it, so I watched it.
335;It's actually a nice little story about a man the people he surounds himself with.
336;It had a lot less to do with the world of comics, a lot more to do with the day to day of life.
337;"i loved how the filmmaker's/editors interspersed the real Harvey with the actor Harvey
I:20062;338;modernism in a creative way, which is exactly what American Splendor does in telling the story of Harvey Pekar, the legendary writer of the underground comic of the same name.
I:20062;339;The idea appealed to Crumb, and thus wa born American Splendor, written by Pekar and illustrated by Crumb and others.
I:20062;340;This makes sense because the film is about both Pekar's life and his comic book, and the comic book was about his life, so moving back and forth between the two would be the way to go.
I:20062;341;pekar's life is a curious combination of pessimism and honesty.
I:20062;342;She comes for a visit, curious to see which version of Pekar in the comic book is most like the real one.
I:20062;343;His immediate reaction is to tell her, You might as well know right off the bat, I had a vasectomy.
I:20062;344;This is my kind of love story.
I:20062;345;Giamatti and Davis both achieve the level of performance where they are simply inhabiting the characters, which is the best way of making them real.
I:20062;346;The point that his life was less than ordinary is driven home repeatedly and ultimately the great appeal of this film is that it tells about an ordinary life in such a unique way.
I:20062;347;Extremely well done film with a unique format for showing all sides of the genius who was Harvey Pekar .
I:20062;348;It includes interviews with the real Harvey Pekar and other people that are portrayed in the film as well, like his wife and co. workers.
I:20062;349;I find it interesting how such an ordinary guy cannot only have not only a successful comic book series, but this movie as well.
I:20062;350;He not only gets his mannerism and voice, but his emotions as well.
I:20062;351;anyone who think their life sucks should watch this, or anyone who likes to watch good movies with good acting too.
I:20062;352;:D The acting really elevates this film.
I:20062;353;It is startlingly well told, masterfully directed, and engaging on a number of levels.
I:20062;354;But there is also an incipient sadness (and madness) to it, as we watch colorful, creative, and lost human beings.
I:20062;355;Harvey's other passions, driven by his love of art, music, and creativity, are record.
I:20062;356;collecting and writing autobiographical comics (with the help of a legion of clever artists, including his friend Crumb).
I:20062;357;It is engaging to watch this clever, smart everyman, with more problems than anyone deserves to have, find a way to speak to the world, to reveal his soul.
I:20062;358;And it is also a wonder to see his friends and associates gather round both to celebrate him and also take care of him when things get grim.
I:20062;359;American Splendor is a masterful blending of live action, comic books, animation, snippets of real life (with the real Harvey and friends), and a lovely eye for humanity and what really matters in life.
I:20062;360;The movie will resonate inside me for a long time.
I:20062;361;(My son has already watched it with me and loved it just as much.)
I:20062;362;American Splendor Splendid!Should have won academy awards!Great acting!
I:20062;363;With the real people in the film you could see what a great job the actors did!
I:20062;364;The dialogue is very clever and stays with you.
I:20062;365;I recommend the pina colada
I:20062;366;I've been looking for it on and off for awhile now and I was happy to find it here.
I:20062;367;The price was right and it shipped on time.
I:20062;368;Harvey Pekar is an interesting """"Everyman"""" who allows us a look at the reality of his life."""
369;the real people from Harvey's life make it into the comic strip, and the buzz eventually makes Harvey into a regular guest on Letterman.
370;"but Letterman also gives exposure to ""American Splendor"" with essentially free advertising."
371;the resulting movie, by Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman, brilliantly blends live action .
372;with animation based on the American Splendor drawings, and with interviews with the REAL Harvey .
373;and the effect made me feel closer to the mind and creative process of Harvey Pekar.
374;It's mostly told with actors, but sometimes we get to meet the real Harvey and his friends and family.
375;The amazing thing is that the approach never seems gimmicky or self.
376;There's never a moment during Paul Giamatti's astounding portrayal of Harvey that we doubt his authenticity, and we aren't disoriented in the least when the real Harvey shows up.
377;the Harvey Pekar story, as told in American Splendor, is deeply moving.
378;What separates him from so many of his bretheren, though, and quite possibly saves his life, is that he finds an outlet when he chooses to document his life in comic.
379;One one hand, this decision leads to his status as an underground hero, Letterman regular, and movie subject.
380;"These are people who matter, and they deserve their voices, and ""American Splendor"" lets them speak, with enormously entertaining results."
381;i love movies like American Splendor.
382;everyday life is pretty complex stuff.
383;Put some doodles on it and it is interesting.
384;Nothing about it is funny.
385;This biography isn't being nominated for best film of the year as some thought.
386;I loved this film and so did my wife.
387;"Paul Giamatti gives one of his best performances
I:20062;388;But the real stars of the show here are Harvey Pekar himself and the amazing filmmaking style brought to this film.
I:20062;389;Paul Giamatti should have won an Oscar for this outstanding performance.
I:20062;390;American Splendor is a hybrid of cartoon and filmed footage, in a very effective and unique combination.
I:20062;391;So American Splendor was illustrated at first by Harvey's friend, underground comic icon Robert Crumb, and later by a succession of other artists.
I:20062;392;So for the past 28 years as of this writing, Harvey Pekar has documented his daily life in comics.
I:20062;393;Earl Billings gives a terrific supporting performance as Harvey's boss, Mr. Boats, as does Judah Friedlander as his co. worker Toby Radloff.
I:20062;394;The story is told through conventional cinematography, comic strips, and interviews with Harvey, Joyce, and Toby, filmed like a documentary against a comic.
I:20062;395;In keeping with the sprit of his comics, we see the movie Harvey, and we meet the real Harvey.
I:20062;396;The audio commentary combines the personal experiences of the real characters in Harvey's world with technical information from the filmmakers.
I:20062;397;And this is the largest group yet I have heard on an audio commentary.
I:20062;398;First, I really enjoyed watching this.
I:20062;399;It's all of the above and more.
I:20062;400;It's really original and fun.
I:20062;401;Shari Springer Bergman's """"American Splendor,"""" is a movie well worth watching."""
402;I wouldn't call it a must see but I would say that it's definitely a worthwhile view and you won't wish you had that 101 minutes back in your life when all is said and done.
403;paul Giamatti plays a splendid Harvey Pekar.
404;Harvey Pekar, you very well may ask (that is if you can make a name a question)?
405;The movie has some interesting conventions.
406;Clips of the real world folks from Pekar's life, as well as his personal commentary are interspersed with actors playing out the story.
407;He displays serious acting chops in one scene as he flashes a rare rare look of hope and engagement and then in an instant goes back to Pekar's usual demeanor of pessimism, curmudgeon.
408;the rest of the film stands up well and leaves you with a sense of a life depressed but one that overcomes it all to be lived fully.
409;Ultimately it is a tale of hope and Americana.
410;Watch this one, a little splendid vision of American Splendor.
411;This amazing movie is justly one of the best movies of 2003.
412;"I suspect its appeal is generational
I:20062;413;this is, loosely speaking, a close relative of Crumb , the fascinating documentary of underground comic artist Robert Crumb and his tragically whacked out family.
I:20062;414;He can't draw, but when he meets up with Crumb, it is a marriage made in heaven.
I:20062;415;giamatti is a perfect Pekar, as the movie demonstrates with aplomb by interchanging scenes of Giammati and the real Pekar.
I:20062;416;The REAL Harvey Pekar narrates this fantastic film even criticizing the filmmakers for picking a guy (Paul Giamatti) that he claims looks nothing like him.
I:20062;417;There are times throughout the movie where we're treated to the real Harvey, his wife, and friends in an interview format.
I:20062;418;Harvey Pekar eventually made it all the way to David Letterman in the '80s.
I:20062;419;Absoulutely one of the best films of 2003.
I:20062;420;He's as about as faceless as you can get.
I:20062;421;He makes a timely friendship with budding underground comic artist Robert Crumb (who I HAD heard of), and publishes a comic based on his own life, and it becomes an underground hit.You watch him develop a relationship and marriage with Joyce, a comic shop owner who writes to him for an issue she missed.
I:20062;422;What's it like to work as a VA hospital file clerk?From off the streets of Cleveland comes American Splendor!
I:20062;423;A comic book series created by Harvey Pekar from Cleveland, OH.
I:20062;424;In 2003, a movie was made depicting the life and times of Harvey as played by Paul Giamatti.
I:20062;425;Although Harvey tends to keep quiet most of the time, the others have a wonderful time reminiscing on what scenes from the film were originally taken from their comic book form and what scenes were written specifically for the film itself.
I:20062;426;Since then, American Splendor has been performed in a stage play format, and now as a feature film that depicts not just the actors, but the actual people they are playing!
I:20062;427;at times, the movie breaks away from its script and shows actual behind the scenes footage of the real Harvey, Toby, and Joyce doing interviews with the directors in a studio with a pure white background.
I:20062;428;I thought it was amazing.
I:20062;429;It is a truly remarkable film that I am happy to have as my own to cherish forever.
I:20062;430;I still find it amazing that even though Harvey Pekar's comic had been around since 1978, I only stepped into his world in June of 2003, and have enjoyed every minute of it.
I:20062;431;Harvey Pekar, you truly are a wonderful writer and as far as life goes, I truly believe in what you say, """"Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff."""""""
432;It's a pleasant surprise that they exist.
433;(It was in great condition when I got it, too.)
434;Harvey Pekar, the everyman who's life is chronicled in comics form makes it to the screen!
435;I'd like to see more of his works developed for movies because he does have a lot to say about the human condition.
436;Harvey represents the working person in every one of us.
437;with the popularity of this film all his paperback comics will be back in print again.
438;the audio commentary adds an extra layer to this great character.
439;The comic insert by Gary and Laura Dumm make me want to see more of his work.
440;this is one of my top ten movies that were theatrical releases in 2003.
441;this is a great story about a man and his life.
442;"things happen, people change, people grow
I:20062;443;his characterization is one of the best of the year.
I:20062;444;this movie will make you think, this movie will make you laugh, this movie may even make you cry.
I:20062;445;i hope that is does all of the above for you, because it certainly deserves the accolades.
I:20062;446;i put it into a category with a couple of other movies (ex.
I:20062;447;but it deserves high marks in the story telling, the presentation, and the acting.
I:20062;448;i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys art in film!
I:20062;449;A well written, and acted movie.
I:20062;450;Paul Giamotti at his best as the comic book writer Harvey Pekar.
I:20062;451;It's amazing how comic book characters end up with film adaptations.
I:20062;452;In fact, they look a lot like comic books.
I:20062;453;Chasing Amy, Kevin Smith's best work, is about cartoonists.
I:20062;454;in truth, Harvey is the perfect underground artist.
I:20062;455;but Capitalism finds Harvey despite himself.
I:20062;456;His friend the famous Robert Crumb pens Harvey's new comic, American Slender and the next thing you know, he has a wife and a regular gig on the David Letterman show.
I:20062;457;this one reminded me of a far superior film about, no way, geeks that can't deal with modern society but are artistically brilliant, Ghost World.
I:20062;458;The great thing was that it had down to earth stories about normal people in a nowhere city, but they came through with a pathos and sense of striving that were throbbing with life.
I:20062;459;The stories range from reasoning about his non.
I:20062;460;From the start, I thought it was completely successful and a work of art that stood on its own.
I:20062;461;You have the real Harvey Pekar as narrator, who occasionally appears to comment from a kind of inner sanctum mixing comics and the film set, and you have a wonderful actor, Paul Giamatti.
I:20062;462;the story is very well put together.
I:20062;463;All through it, Pekar strives to develop his art, comic book writing that others illustrate.
I:20062;464;Every freelancer will identify with this.
I:20062;465;we all laughed, but felt sympathy as well.
I:20062;466;someday, I believe, Pekar's work will be regarded as genuine literature that portrays the age, much I would wager, as do Chaucer or Froissart.
I:20062;467;Paul is a very gifted actor, is there anything this guy can not do?he captures the essence of the soul of the writer of American Splender down to his Dna!
I:20062;468;I highly recommend to any geeks out there who love eccentric characters, that they add this Movie to their collection right away!!
I:20062;469;Although in certain respects it reminded me of other documentaries (e. g. those produced by Frederick Wiseman and Michael Moore), it is quite unique and therefore, for me, difficult to discuss.
I:20062;470;Intriguing to me is his steadfast refusal to compromise any of his cranky opinions, notably about the very media which attract public attention to him.
I:20062;471;Also impressive is the skill with which Springer.
I:20062;472;berman and Pulcini coordinate the aforementioned interaction between real people and members of the film's cast.
I:20062;473;He began a series entitled """"American Splendor,"""" which was really an ongoing autobiographical narrative, drawing on people and events in his own life as his source of inspiration."""
474;documentary of sorts, tells his life story by cutting back and forth between both staged reenactments of the events in the stories and interviews with Pekar himself commenting on those events.
475;American Splendor is an offbeat little gem that, in many ways, approximates the look and style of a comic book.
476;Robert Pulcini and Sheri Springer Berman, who wrote and directed the film together, create a surrealistic tone by having Pekar and his real friends and companions frequently appear on screen next to the actors who are portraying them (some of them dead ringers for the originals).
477;This technique brings a homespun, homey sweetness to the film.
478;American Splendor is a paean to all the social misfits in the world, people who, for whatever reason, can't seem to fit into society's prescribed mold but who often develop strong, meaningful bonds with similar individuals.
479;The movie is also a tribute to the power of art, both for the artist who finds purpose and release through his work and for those to whom his work speaks on a personal and emotional level.
480;are seen in the film as warm, good.
481;the emotional focal point for the film is Harvey's relationship with his wife, Joyce, beautifully played by Hope Davis.
482;Despite the somewhat bizarre nature of their marriage, Harvey and Joyce forge a lasting commitment based on reciprocity and devotion.
483;as Pekar, Paul Giametti turns in a flawless performance, capturing the nebbishness, cantankerousness and ultimate likeability of the man he is portraying.
484;"in both style and content, ""American Splendor"" is aptly named."
485;I found I really cared about these people and that's half the battle won for the director in the first place.
486;Harvey Pekar, a well known and well apraised underground comic book writer.
487;Harvey is played by Paul Giamatti, who does a great job.
488;The movie also as some inventive ideas.
489;The film that is on the disc is worth by itself.
490;Harvey Pekar, born in 1939 in Cleveland, comically chronicles the minutiae of his everyday life as a file clerk in a VA Hospital, and the spectacular coincidence of meeting comic book genius Robert Crumb, who is instrumental in getting Pekar to write his own wildly successful graphic novels.
491;the new wife is a hilarious master at diagnosing people with psychiatric disorders .
492;wildly innovative and entertaining, a great choice of music peppers the film, including the final solo of My Favorite Things by John Coltrane, paralleling the real Pekar's reviewing of jazz albums.
493;filmshots alternate between the real Harvey Pekar and his wife and their respective movie counterparts, a nice dichotomy.
494;This is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen this year.
495;Paul Giamatti and Hope Davis are a hoot as the underground artists Harvey Pekar and Joyce Brabner.
496;The mixture of documentary, animation and straightforward narrative are genuinely innovative and thought.
497;"This very much reminds me of Terry Zwigoff's ""Crumb"", a film which is mentioned in passing in this movie (and in this film the actor James Urbaniak gives an uncannily accurate performance as Crumb.)"
498;"The combination of ironic distance and compassion in recounting their subjects' lives are the same in both ""Crumb"" and ""American Splendor."""
499;"There's more humor and pathos in the film
I:20062;500;Pekar serves as narrator and appears as himself occasionally as well, as interviews, file footage, and re.
I:20062;501;Pekar sought fame and found it thanks to his comics (which are full of observations on life's mundane and mysterious moments, and feature artwork by such friends as Robert Crumb) and his appearances as a guest on David Letterman's talk show.
I:20062;502;She is never enthusiastic about the success of the comic book, although she originally met Harvey by writing a fan letter to him.
I:20062;503;Both Joyce and Harvey are good matches for each other and generally make each other miserable.
I:20062;504;Notwithstanding, I found the premise behind the comic strips to be original and interesting.
I:20062;505;AMERICAN SPLENDOR is an entertaining, worthwhile film.
I:20062;506;American Splendor is one of those films that completely takes you by surprise with how good it really is.
I:20062;507;It is directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, a duo who shows an astonishing confidence in not only their actors, but the screenplay they are working from also (beautifully written by Harvey Pekar and Joyce Brabner).
I:20062;508;the confidence is well placed, as the acting portraying the real life quirks of comic book artist Harvey Pekar, wife Joyce Brabner, and many supporting roles is pitch perfect.
I:20062;509;Not to worry, American Splendor features documentary segments of the real Harvey and friends, giving the film a second intriguing layer.
I:20062;510;how much confidence does it take to show a segment where an actor (Paul Giamatti) portraying a real life man (Pekar) walks through a door, and on the other side of the door is a cut to real life video footage of that man?
I:20062;511;A whole lot of confidence.
I:20062;512;Giamatti seems to take the challenge in stride with his comedic ability, not to mention the wonderful Hope Davis as Brabner.
I:20062;513;Take those elements, add actual cartoon portions inspired by the illustration of the original American Splendor comic book, and you have one imaginative and darkly comic tale about one imaginative and darkly comic man.
I:20062;514;Fantastic, if just for that reason.
I:20062;515;The most entertaining, and certainly of the most original films of the past year!
I:20062;516;the actual Harvey Pekar narrates the film, and is in the film during the Letterman scenes (which are hilarious), and as the camera takes the viewer to Harvey for an occasional brief interview.
I:20062;517;Hope Davis does an outstanding job as well as Joyce (Pekar's wife.
I:20062;518;i know that for some reason this film was celebrated because of Harvey's unique point.
I:20062;519;With Splendor's success there will be new classes in film school on the art of gently wasting screen.
I:20062;520;I loved this true life story of an ordinary life.
I:20062;521;Just about everyone will be able to identify in some part with Harvey Pekar and his pathetic life.
I:20062;522;The truth in the comics, and in the movie, enable everyone to stand back and laugh at themselves.
I:20062;523;It is good medicine for the ego.
I:20062;524;The best part of American Splendor is the combination of the actors, real life people, and cartoons that bring together life of Harvey Pekar.
I:20062;525;The director uses imaginative techniques to bring these three elements together, and it is done seamlessly.
I:20062;526;for the directors stlye, this film is a must.
I:20062;527;the acting in this film is top notch, and since every actor is playing a real person, it is easy to compare how they have done, since all the real people also appear in this film.
I:20062;528;All in all, this in an inventive, decent movie, that could have easily earned more stars had I known more about Pekar's life before I watched the movie.
I:20062;529;There are a lot of insightful reviews here and I agree with the ones that talk about this film's strengths.
I:20062;530;paul Giammati gives an outstanding performance.
I:20062;531;Hope Davis deserves the Best Sexiest Nerd Oscar, if they ever get around to having one.
I:20062;532;I can relate a good deal with this person.
I:20062;533;The movie shows that despite the fact that he may appear to be a loser, he (at the same time) is an absolute winner.
I:20062;534;American Splendor is enjoyable and intelligently made.
I:20062;535;romantic ephinanies of Harvey Pekar's best work.
I:20062;536;The filmmakers deserve credit for inviting thought about the artifice of the film (with, for examples, scenes of the actors interacting with the real people they portray), but those scenes reveal the extent to which the film glamorizes Pekar and his circle to make them more audience friendly (in other words, more like the reassurring fantasies movie audiences are accustomed to).
I:20062;537;Giamatti is excellent as Pekar.
I:20062;538;Hope Davis is a fine actress, but miscast here.
I:20062;539;in a profound sense, she'll always be remote from the world of Pekar and Joyce Brabner.
I:20062;540;That's the underlying point of the film and I know that, but it didn't make either my wife or me enjoy the film.
I:20062;541;the only compliment I can bestow upon the film is that it was generally well cast.
I:20062;542;Paul Giamatti is always strong and engaging in his characters, and this is one of his best.
I:20062;543;A movie worth seeing again.
I:20062;544;All you have to know is that slightly ironically.
I:20062;545;titled 'American Splendor' offers very unique account of a life of a man in Cleveland who made it by just being himself, working as a file clerk in local hospital.
I:20062;546;these things are all brilliantly told in this film, which is a curious blend of fiction and non.
I:20062;547;One day Pekar meets a future underground comic genius Robert Crumb (who is perhaps known for the design for Janis Joplin album 'Cheap Thrills').
I:20062;548;the collaboration 'American Splendor' brings unexpected things to his life: one of them is Joyce Brabner, fan of his comics who comes to meet and marry him.
I:20062;549;rimmed glasses) is another charm to this film, who holds her own despite the messy room of Pekar.
I:20062;550;Joyce herself also appears, who, even during a short time, gives us a strong impression that she is quite a character.
I:20062;551;but the greatest thing about 'American Splendor' is that it succeeds in showing the personalities of these people without much dramatizing them.
I:20062;552;But that is part of the charms of the film, which ultimately affirms the values of life.
I:20062;553;And the characters depicted here are the genuine ones.
I:20062;554;paul Giamatti is superb as Pekar, though he doesn't seem to have changed much.
I:20062;555;More brilliant is Hope Davis, who undergoes a perfect transformation, and shows an uncanny resemblance to the real Joyce.
I:20062;556;And 'American Splendor' gives you a chance to meet them, and make you think about the thin line between ordinary and extraordinary.
I:20062;557;AMERICAN SPLENDOR is an intriguing piece of cinema.
I:20062;558;After all, there are millions of people who live lives very similar to Harvey's.
I:20062;559;Paul Giamatti pulls off a wonderful performance of Pekar, catching all of Pekar's nuances, seeming to be the exact version of the Pekar from twenty years ago.
I:20062;560;i thoroughly enjoyed this film.
I:20062;561;Pekar's life was the inspiration for his art, but now his art has become his life.
I:20062;562;Also, I enjoyed this film because it illustrates how each one of us is an unique person and that beneath the rugged exteriors of us all there lies substance of worth.
I:20062;563;There is beauty all around us and it is splendid.
I:20062;564;Very early Giamatti and I can understand why he took the role, you can't be overly picky early in an acting career.
I:20062;565;Finally a film for smart people.
I:20062;566;Best film of the year, hands down.
I:20062;567;Paul Giamatti and Hope Davis are brilliant.
I:20062;568;Harvey Pekar's adapted comic book series to the silver screen is a real feast for the eyes, more than I could ever expect.
I:20062;569;Pekar's life is examined with the intriguing mixture of biographical elements, surrealism, mixed media (documentary, interview, dramatisation, and animation), and dry, unconventional humour (better utilised here than in a Wes Anderson film) that all accumulates an already satisfying package of the frustrated, lonely everyman into something more special.
I:20062;570;Robert Crumb's character is strikingly hilarious and intriguing too with him using the phrase, man"""", quite a bit (even more funnier when I seen a BBC documentary about the twisted."""
571;"key elements (especially the jazz music and acting) are what make for a purely independent film and how respected it is shows that the comic book series and the film adaptation give the two names, ""comic"" and ""book"" a less childish, underprivileged name."
572;It is funny in so many parts yet it is tragic and yet it is quirky on so many levels that it cannot even be categorised as one only thing.
573;His solution is to write a comic book about his daily ordeals and thoughts.
574;i loved the characters and their real.
575;life, and the fictionalized parts contributed to my ultimate love and admiration to this film.
576;"Documentaries have been getting more and more creative in the last several years, and ""American Splendor"" is one of the most creative and engaging."
577;It superbly mixes dramatization and documentary, such as when Paul Giamatti plays Harvey Pekar preparing for his first David Letterman appearance, and then we see the actual Harvey Pekar on a television set being interviewed by Letterman.
578;the film also very ably captures the essence of the underground comic, and at least as far as the comic itself would indicate, the personality of its creator, Harvey Pekar.
579;A gruff man with genuine emotions and simple needs, he comes across as a misfit hero that anyone can sympathize with.
580;as a final testament to how well the subject matter of them film is handled: there is a scenario involving a life.
581;threatening illness, and the filmmaker and actors do a great job of treating it with appropriate gravity without falling into the trap of over.
582;an excellent film that deserves far more than an underground audience.
583;His cry of desperation finds a creative outlet in creating a comic book about the every day ups and downs of life.
584;Harvey ultimately ventures beyond satire (of his own life) to document his own battle with cancer and other life changes.
585;acted: Paul Giamatti perfectly captures the mannerisms and gruffness of Harvey Pekar, whom we see in cut.
586;* It's a funny movie.
587;* I enjoyed the cinematography and direction.
588;The very 1970s (primarily) story of Harvey is spiced with cut.
589;aways to the real Harvey narrating his story from a sound stage that has a comic book feel to it.
590;Harvey Pekar is relatable and endearing.
591;He creates his own hope.
592;And for my money, that makes this a better movie.
