2;When I watched this i was laughing all the time!
3;This is diffinitly one of my favorites.
4;She's a very pretty lady and draws everyones attention when she's on the screen.
5;If you like her be sure to check out a movie called S. f. w. she has a small but memorable (partial nude scene) role in that film.
6;While he's got him, though, they do all sorts of crazy things and have a lot of fun.
7;Rob Schneider provides excellent comic relief, as does Steve Buscemi, who has a cameo in this film.
8;up for heart, and two thumbs up for humor and entertainment!
9;Special features include an HBO First Look which is worthwhile viewing.
10;Big Daddy starring Adam Sandler and Joey Lauren Adams is a sweet romantic comedy.
11;I enjoy this film although some of the scenes are bit gross.
12;Steve Buscemi's physical comedy holds this film together.
13;I recommend checking this unexpected and cute film out, enjoy!
14;big Daddy is my favorite Sandler movie, and one of my favorite ever movies, simply because of its humor and simple enough story.
15;"There are jokes throughout this entire movie, even sometimes during ""emotional"" times."
16;Steve Buscemi is also in this movie, playing the Homeless guy, who also adds some humor into the already funny movie.
17;I enjoyed this movie much more than I had expected to.
18;Big Daddy is a very entertaining (cute AND funny) film.
19;This is his best, when I went to the movies everybody there could not stop laughing.
20;This movie is ssoo funny.
21;It has been a while since I saw a movie with Adam sandler that I thought was funny but it did arrive.
22;This is a must see have movie.
23;If you love comedies this is a movie you need to get.
24;Great idea for the movie: A young man who can't take care of himself, has to take care of a 6.
25;old boy (beautifully played by twins).
26;Guest appearances by Rob Schneider and Steve Buchemi, really make a contribution to the movie.
27;Adam, as usual, does a great job making fun of a girl throughout the movie!
28;I love Adam Sandler movies, and this one is the best.
29;It was so funny, and it had a really good storyline.
30;The other cast members were funny too, especially Rob Schneider.
31;Everything about this movie was good, and if you liked other Sandler movies your most likely to like this one.
32;Also check out The Wedding Singer , and Happy Gilmore .
33;If you LOVE Adam Sandler movies then you will love this movie!
34;My son loves Adam Sandler and willbe receiving this as a gift.
35;What a classic Adam Sandler movie.
36;This movie is hilarious and my dad actually likes it (he is the worst critic ever).
37;Now THIS is what a REAl comedy is all about!
38;sonny (that's Adam Sandler's character's name) works at a toll booth on a high way.
39;But since the boy's natural father is going away to China, Sonny tells him that he will take care of the boy.
40;Sonny decides to adopt the boy to prove to his girlfriend that he is responsible and mature and can do things right so he can get her back.
41;through the laughs, there are heart.
42;It is a really good movie and I think Adam Sandler did an excellent acting job, and this movie was really hilarious!
43;I especially love the part when the little boy is jumping on his jumping ball and repeating everything Sonny is saying while he's watching the hockey game.
44;baught this for my 9 yr old son he loved it like i did when it 1st came out
45;i have loved this movie since i was a little kid.
46;the greats of the great comidie i am not a big fan at all when it comes to scarie or much other things so i was searching movies when i cam across this i thought that it was a little bit much for this old miovie but no it was great the kid was cute and well its adam sandler.
47;I have to say I really liked this movie.
48;It was smart, funny, and heart.
49;That was VERY mature of him and I was pleasently surprised.
50;And the ending was realistically wholesome.
51;But in my opinion, he's a great actor who can be really funny at times, and sometimes not so funny.
52;Over time we see that yes, it worked very well.
53;Of course, this is also a big surprise for everyone including Gerrity.
54;Sonny in the end finds more than Julian that fateful day and learns a lot about himself.
55;the film shows Adam at his funny best and if you are a Sandler fan you will like this movie.
56;Layla Maloney played by Joey Lauren Adams is a sweet role and Adams in this role reminds me a little of Renee Zellwegger in Jerry Maguire.
57;in the final analysis, love wins out and everybody lives happily ever.
58;The movie promotes family love and values and is a feel good movie which most likely if you are a Jon Stewart or an Adam Sandler fan will not disappoint you.
59;It was funny, light and kept you laughing.
60;But overall still a funny film.
61;three stars for this feel good movie.
62;this is my favorite movie.
63;it is the best movie ever.
64;i love this movie so much.
65;everyone should watch this movie.
66;I am a big fan of Sandler .
67;Our hero gets married, now works as a lawyer, has a child of his own, is still best buds with his original son Julian, and to top it off he can have a laugh at his ex.
68;Just like it works in real life, right?
69;This movie will make you laugh, and cry.
70;It will astonish all ages.
71;Sandler, the cast, and the writers do it again.
72;Lots of laughs and crude humor in a movie about Sandler unofficially adopting his friend's little boy.
73;Big Daddy has heart and a load of laughs, continuing in the Adam Sandler tradtion.
74;A must see for any Adam Sandler fan, and a top movie of its generation.
75;It is hilarious but also has a heartwarming ending.
76;While the movie is not all laughs it certainly has its moments.
77;it is an all out fun fest.
78;schneider has a little role as a delevery boy but he will make you laugh as he cant read.
79;overall it is a very good romantic comedy movie and a must have.
80;there are some priceless secnes in here and when has Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider ever upset us?I enjoyed this big hit and im shore you will tooHIGHLY RECOMENDED
81;One of the funniest movies since waterboy, This movie is a must for Adam Sandler fans!
82;I LOVE adam sandler and the twin boys do a great job!
83;directed by Dennis Dugan (Happy Gilmore, Saving Silverman, Problem Child) made a silly entertaining film, Which Fans of Sandler will have a Great Time with this Comedy.
84;Cole and Dylan Spourse steals the film as the Child in the Lead, who loves his New Adopted Father.
85;This is One of Snadler`s Best Films.
86;I enjoy Adam Sandler, he always has done a nice job at al lthe characters he took on.
87;(like in his other films)Sonny wants to gain his girl friends attention.
88;although Sonny uses him alittle for attention, he soon realizes Jullians position and is willing to take him in for good.
89;this movie has its funny moments and a plot that i can actual believe.
90;i really think anyone could enjoy this movie and alot of the jokes you'll probably constantly talk of afterwords.
91;But, it was still a good movie all the same.
92;It's a great funny movie!
93;Certainly, Big Daddy has its course moments, but it's an excellent comedy that just so happens to have a heart.
94;"More importantly, though, what you have here is a guy who is more than willing to ""grow up"" and change his life in order to be a father to a kid he genuinely loves."
95;in its own quirky, Sandler.
96;a tribute to all the fathers out there who genuinely love their children.
97;and he comes up with some pretty ingenious ways to inspire Julian.
98;Before this film is through, there are actually a few heartwarming moments .
99;which are accomplished without sacrificing any of the comedy.
100;"The cast is great (even Jon Stewart isn't all that bad)
101;i don't, as a rule, enjoy comedies built around children doing some of the disgusting things that children do, but Big Daddy was a pleasant, very entertaining surprise.
102;laughs are guaranteed, and there's almost always much more to the story than you might expect.
103;I have loved all of Adams Sandler's other movie, all except Big Daddy.
104;The Colors jump off the screen and every detail is lush.
105;I never give a film a high score just because I like it, but this film is brilliant.
106;Adam Sandler is a great comedian and screenplay writer and the whole cast fitted in nicely to the theme of the story.
107;Just as Sonny grows close to Julian, with a very warm love, Social Services come knocking.
108;Even though I tell you most of the story, you have to see it for yourself.
109;to say the least, a film well acted (Sandler does a great Sonny Koufax, and Cole and Dylan play their part even better) and well wrote.
110;Tremendously funny and sad in parts.
111;I remember when I first saw Big Daddy in the cinema, the response from the entire audience was breath.
112;And then people laughed their minds off at the most funny parts of film history.
113;this is an amazing film.
114;Every home should have one, or two if you really like it.
115;If you want a bigger one, please email me at fiveoftwelve@ntlworld.
116;The first half of the movie Big Daddy is a bit dissapointing.
117;but the second half of the movie is pretty funny and it even has some emotional scenes which I realy didn't expect of an Adam Sandler movie.
118;the movie also has a good soundtrack (with great songs of Sheryl Crow and Garbage) and Steve Buscemi is very funny as the homeless man and Rod Schneider as the delivery guy.
119;Makes me laugh and I bet he'll make you laugh too!
120;Great movies to watch over and over.
121;The twins that played julian did a wonderful job!
122;Big Daddy will make you laugh and cry at the same time!
123;This movie is a must for Adam Sandler fans!
124;this is one of Adam Sandler's okay movies.
125;but this one's still good
126;Adam Sandler in BIG DADDY was O. k. as a comedy and a pretty good romantic comedy/date movie.
127;This one has some funny parts but for the most part, it's a romantic comedy.
128;now I went into this movie not knowing the story and me and my best friend saw this moving thinking that it was going to be another great Sandler comedy.
129;I wasn't disappointed, but this is a perfect example for anyone who just goes and sees movies without bothering to find out what the movie is about.
130;other than that, I thought it was pretty good.
131;It has a good story, the cast is great and the parts that are funny are really funny.
132;Steve Buscemi's character is really funny and Rob Schneider is also a total riot.
133;In any case, I still think it's a good movie.
134;While this may not go down in history as one of the great movie mysteries, it's still mystifying how he manages to draw a crowd especially when he's playing it relatively straight here.
135;some in good taste .
136;Adam Sandler, yet again, did a *spectacular* video!
137;And these two new cuties, Cole and Dylan Sprouse(Julian McGarth) are sooo cute and funny!
138;Its worth every penny you have!
139;Adam Sandler shows us his talents in his latest movie.
140;What we do get is a Down to Earth comedy which will hit home for all ages.
141;This movie does go by a little slower then his previous movies, but this moive is sure to be happy addition to any video collection.
142;Big Daddy is a beautiful movie.Yes, it is crude at times.
143;But Sandler shows what live is all about, hope, love and faith.
144;Sandler, Schneider, Buscemi, and others really did a good job with their performances.
145;Even though I can't stand the Sprouse brothers, they did very well as Julian.
146;Love the movie, great price and right on time!!!
147;This movie is definitely a new direction for Sandler.
148;It's a touching role that Sandler plays, as the guy who never grew up, but instantly gains 20 years in maturity when he tries to become a father.
149;With a great cast, including always.
150;funny Rob Schneider and Steve Buscemi among others, and a great music selection (nice to hear Styx in a modern movie, even Sheryl Crow covering """"Sweet Child O' Mine""""), this movie will probably become a classic family movie, despite some harsh language here and there (just as much by the kid as the adults: you know how funny kids are when they repeat what the adults say without knowing what it means)."""
151;This movie is definitely one of Sandler's best ever.
152;In all of those movies he is usually playing an imature or slightly retarted charector, wich by the is very funny, but in this movie he plays a father and adds a completley new twist to the phrase an adam sandler movie much his others this is a very good
153;Just like wedding singer, Billy Madison, and Happy Gilmore, this movie is hilarious.
154;Adam is one of the funniest actors out there.
155;Despite of all negative reviews below or above, I still find this movie warm and so much watchable.
156;This movie has a real story and quite nice in fact you'll end up appreciating your time spent with your old man.
157;This is definitely one of Sandler's best.
158;This is by far Adam Sandler's best comedy.
159;You felt sorry for this guy at the same time, you laughed at him.
160;I saw this movie with my young nephews and all we did was laugh.
161;A very entertaining film that you don't have to think, just enjoy.
162;He already had this on VHS on loved it.
163;I actually ended up ENJOYING IT!
164;Give this movie a chance, even if you aren't a big Adam Sandler fan!
165;You will laugh, you might even cry, and you will most certainly be entertained!
166;Definitely geared for adults, only)!
167;This is a very entertaining movie.
168;Watch the movie and you'll see what I mean.
169;Big Daddy DOES have a story to tell and a good lesson to share.
170;i enjoy it because it was a family movie.
171;i found Big Daddy an enjoyable comedy and I liked the way that the script was written with some very clever one.
172;If I am able to laugh out loud at a film, when I am meant to I consider it a success.
173;Adam Sandler is a very clever comedy actor who has a subtle approach and does the job just right.
174;Julian is a very likeable character and ahh was quite often used when watching.
175;Adam Sandler is one hilarious actor, this is no exception.
176;The movie is really great, worthwhile, too.
177;I do recommend this, although not that appropriate too children under 8.
178;She applauded it, though, for at least having homosexuals in it, and not making fun of them.
179;I guarantee that it will deliver some laughs but I don't think that this is one to own.
180;This is a must have so funny love this movie it came fast in 4 days great price and great movie if u like funny movies u have to have this love it and love the great deals on amazon
181;this comedy, as all Sandler's movies, is to have a good time.
182;"To take care of the child he decides to make a fantasy world without rules and obstacles
183;I recommend it because of its joy.
184;transmition and pretty funny ex SaturdayNightLive.
185;adam Sandler is my favorite actor, and this is one of the best movies ever.
186;Adam Sandler is my alltime favorite comedian, who has helped me appreciate my heritage through his comedy.
187;This movie proves what a great man he can be, as of all his movies, Hillareous, definatley worth seeing!
188;Pros:*Rob Schneider and Jon Stewart,though secondary,are very funny.
189;*The kid was cute and convincing.
190;if you're an Adam Sandler fan,it's good.
191;on a scale of one to five (five is the best), I would give this film a three.
192;I thought this was a good film but only moderately funny.
193;It is one of the best Adam Sandler movies I have seen.
194;If you need a good laugh, you definately want to see this movie.
195;I guess the whole family and I were enjoying it so much we didn't notice all the Bleeps.
196;We laughed, we cried, we cheered when the good guys won the day.
197;Big daddy is a 4 star, very good movie, but i have to give it 3 stars for the cursing.
198;This movie has more of a serious type of story to it much like the wedding singer did, yet still funny.
199;The kid in the movie paired with Sandler make a hilarious couple.
200;It never changes, casting Adam Sandler gets you one of the dumbest movies one can see.
201;plus, if your gonna watch a adam sandler movie with your kids, this is the best one, it's not to harsh and has a good story line.
202;the extra content is ok, the 2 music videos are pretty cool.
203;overall, it's a good teen family movie.
204;You've got the funny Adam Sandler, the witty Jon Stewart, the sweet Joey Lauren Adams, the strange Steve Buscemi, etc. .
205;Name one creatively written scene that is truly funny.
206;I love the movie Big Daddy, this is one of the funniest and sad situation movie that I have ever saw.
207;I don't want to ruin the excitement of the movie but it is really great and it's one of those movies that anyone could love.
208;It is definitely a classic but still enjoyable today.
209;I seen the trailer, and it looked hilarious.
210;Many people, mainly Adam Sandler and his few friends, thought that this movie was funny .
211;Sure kids will love it, anyone under the age of 13 will laugh at Sandler's goofy face, it's just all.
212;he is a good daddy and he desered to have that little guy and dont let any social security take that guy away from big daddy
213;This was the greatest movie I've ever seen.
214;I've seen it numerous times and would watch it 100 times more!
215;It made me laugh and cry.you gotta see it!
216;goers will enjoy this movie, even the thick ones who don't like silly comedies.
217;I enjoyed the film, but it could of been better, maybe some music, better direction and improved acting from Sandler would of earnt the film 5 stars.
218;overall a funny and enjoyable movie with an awesome cast, something good to watch on a Saturday.
219;This is one of the best movies I ever saw!
220;The two boys who play Julian are so cute!
221;It's a very amusing movie, that held my attention for hours!
222;Would recommend it for kids ages 10 up!
223;olds ever, but it was more than just an okay comedy.
224;I laughed a ton and almost cried when Julian was taken away.
225;I thought that this was Adam Sandler's best movie he has made.
226;i laugh out loud when I see this movie!!!!
227;Some people thought it was cute what did they think was cute the 5 year old boy [peeing] on the side of the restaurant.
228;Big Dady is a grea movie with all kinds of laughing lines to it!
229;I have seen this movie three times and my judgement is woth it.
230;This is the best Adam Sandler movie yet, next in line is Happy Gillmore.
231;I chose this one because it has an excellent squence events that flow from beging to end.
232;If there is one thing that Adam Sandler does well, that's comedy, and Big Daddy is just that: a good comedy.
233;the movie brings to the screen the story of a good.
234;old boy!Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.
235;Laugh,cry,love and then laugh again.
236;it was his best movie yet
237;So the movie ends at a happy note.
238;during the movie you'll have some laughs, giiggles and some tear jerking scenes.
239;The funniest part of the movie is the court room scene, with Nazo, Mr. Hurley and the Bum.
240;By far the best comedy and great story to a movie.
241;I appreciate his humor, don't ask me why but I find him funny.
242;paying job in a high.
243;Now meet Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse), a cute five.year.
244;old who appears on Sonny's doorstep with a note from his mom claiming he's the illegitimate son of Sonny's best law.
245;Sonny starts to bond with the kid.
246;Rob Schnider is hilarious as Nazo the delivery guy, and Steve Buscemi is uproarious as the homeless guy.
247;This movie is so so so so Funny!!!
248;Adam Sandler as a dad is just amazing because it has a great story behind it.
249;Secondly, it strives for the kind of coolness factor ala the Kevin Smith films, Swingers, and the like.
250;most critics liked it, however I don't.
251;Big Daddy is a great movie.
252;the movie is funny from """"all angles""""."""
253;The story is good, the cast is as solid as I've ever seen in a comedy, etc, etc.
254;Whether or not you're usually into Sandler's brand of comedy, you will most likely appreciate this film.
255;I feel that this is Adam Sandler at his best .
256;and it is certainly one of his most successful projects.
257;This was a pretty good movie.
258;It's not as great as his other movies like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, but it does have its funny moments.
259;One day a boy arrives at his door, but it's actually his roomate's.
260;good flicks like Mr. Deeds, but this one was just.
261;There's some slapstick Sandler humor in here and a few funny parts, but I really can't recommend this movie to own.
262;Like many of his compatriates, he is a personality.
263;Although some of the humor is deliberately off color, one can't help but find it funny because a kid is involved.
264;Along with Sandler, we get a delightful performance from Dylan and Cole Sprouse as Julian.
265;"Joey Lauren Adams oozes maternal sweetness as Layla, the girl Sandler falls in love with
266;Add a nice bit by the reliable Steve Buscemi as a homeless man and you have a pretty tight cast.
267;But still, the acting wouldn't really put comedy fans off the hook, because this film is funny, enjoyable and clever.
268;But soon, he will become face.
269;Will Sonny be his normal lazy self, or will this kid show him real fun and the meaning of having a good time?Predicatable, silly, but overall fun and cool.
270;See it if you want bigs laughs and a small story.
271;Her grace, intelligence, warmth and sweetness made """"Big Daddy"""" a truly heartwarming film."""
272;Back when Sandler was funny and brought his A game.
273;If you want something good from Adam Sandler, look for Happy Gilmore.
274;warming and back and forth and back and forth and AAARRRGGGH!
275;He's funny, but he can't do romantic or family scenes very well.
276;The movie Big Daddy is a great movie for teenage kids.
277;Billy Madison was funnier than this movie because it had more realistic jokes.
278;As a fan of Adam Sandler, I feel that he's really come into his own with his portrayal of Sonny in Big Daddy .
279;It was a real character, someone that I believed in by the end of the movie, kind of like Robbie in the Wedding Singer .
280;This movie is fantastic and will always be considered a classic in my eyes.
281;Thought it would make a good addition to their at home collection for children/grandchildren to view while there to visit.
282;Love it, Adam Sandler is amazingly funny and he had a great cast for this movie!
283;I was reluctant to see Big Daddy but eventually watched it and it was good.
284;"His only joke is that funny voice he makes
285;Adam Sandler crosses a line and does not make light of it or even acknowledge it, whereas good comedies like There's Something About Mary recognize that they have crossed the line, but set the tone correctly as to make the audience feel good about laughing.
286;It's an example of how to set the right tone.
287;As outrageous as this film can be (with Adam Sandler as an instant father), the premise is a gem.
288;over a decade old and still tugging away at growing up and taking responsibility.
289;This is Sandler at his best!
290;This is an awesome Adam Sandler classic!
291;It's a very funny movie about a slob named Sonny Koufax who adopts a 5 year old kid named Julian who is dropped at his apartment door.
292;If you love comedy and Adam Sandler, you'll love BIG DADDY!!!
293;I liked this movie because of the kind of comedy.
294;It keeps your eyes glued to the screen as Adam Sandler cracks jokes.
295;Every movie with Adam Sandler has to be a great one.
296;I absolutely love this movie.
297;Big Daddy, along with Waterboy, are some of Adam Sandler's best films.
298;This movie not only provides a good moral story, but it provides comedy right from the start.
299;Big Daddy is billed as a comedy, but I found little to laugh about.
300;Eminent thinkers like John R. Searle have long considered the perplexing existence (or theoretical existence) of consciousness to be one of the great mysteries of life.
301;Equally perplexing a mystery is the popularity of Adam Sandler and his abominable films, indisputable proof of the existence of unconsciousness.
302;The way Sandler tries to keep Julian away from drugs by interrogating several of his school friends is hilarious and almost heartwarming.
303;Rob Schneider and Joey Lauren Adams also turn in competent performances.
304;It's a step above The Waterboy, however.
305;laden fatherhood makes the film relatively enjoyable.
306;The film is not always at its peak of creative freshness at such times, but Sandler's lowkey cynicism provides some humor.
307;One may be moved at times, but one also craves the satirical sharpness and bite that a more courageous screenplay might have provided.
308;As it is, it provides numerous chuckles and a cuddly warm feeling .
309;This movie takes on a more happy loving feel than other dumb funny Sandler movies.
310;Renee Zelwegger plays Sonny's new girlfriend who loves Julian, and loves Sonny.
311;This movies happy feeling is sure to have a smile across your face for the majority of it and has a great ending, and will also make you laugh throughout much of it.
312;Ok, this movie does have some funny parts but it gets very old about 20 minutes into the movie.
313;I'm a big fan of Mr. Sandler.
314;I must admit"
315;"I never really have watched Adam long enough to compliment or insult his acting
316;something year old man to realize the truth about his own presence in his own little world, kids"
317;The end surprised me totally and I even cried!
318;"When a movie can actually touch you so much that you feel the emotions and you begin to express them
319;Adam Sandler wuz s0 funny!
320;Great cast, funnY and catchy lines.
321;This is the best Adam Sanlder movie I've seen besides, 'Water Boy and The Wedding Singer.'
322;After he realizes the kid's potential, and starting him out at a young age, Sandler gives him full.
323;He continues entertaining the kid featuring a stick placed strategically in a skater's path with him tumbling down and practically breaking his neck.
324;One day she gets fed up up with him and tells him to grow up and get a decent job.
325;one of the funniest parts in the movie was when Sonny had a little talk yo by the kids teacher and the teacher had some very bad things to say about the kid which where very funny.
326;Another funny bit was when the kid goes daddy can i have my night light, and so Sonny turns on a lit up sign saying live nudes with an arrow pointing to the right.
327;I really loved this movie, it was very hillarious with more than 20 hillarious bits.
328;It is one of the most hillarious films i had seen and the ending was very sweet and even through out the film it was sweet.
329;Adam Sandler is a great actor and he had the most suitable part in the movie for him.
330;Adam Sandler has done some great work and i hope he keeps up the great work.
331;If you like this film i suggest you go see the new movie with him in, mr deeds and believe me you won't regret it, but i have to say mr deeds was not as funny as big daddy, but it is great and i hope more people in the world start to know more about Adam Sandler and understand why he is such a great funny sweet actor.
332;If i had to have a favourite Adam sandler movie it would propbably be waterboy, which was a very sweet touching film.
333;So yeah overall a great film worth watching, SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!!!!!!
334;ray, this is my first blu.
335;The film shows Sandler's funny side as well as his soft side.
336;A good movie to take a date to see.
337;I am a huge fan of Adam Sandler.
338;I am a huge fan of the Sprouse twins.
339;I am a huge fan of Jon Stewart .
340;lets face it, I'm a huge fan of everyone in this movie.
341;Now he's stuck with the kid, so he tells social services to call him when a foster family gets lined up.
342;over the weeks Koufax comes to genuinely love the little kid.
343;It delivers the laughs that Sandler always promises, but also has a heartwarming, sentimental side .
344;This story has a real heart to it.
345;Sandler is great playing Sonny, a child in a man's body who takes over care of a young child and learns the need for responsability and patience.
346;Let me start off my review by saying that Adam Sandler is my favorite comedian,and that I have all of Sandler's albums and I have seen and own a lot of his movies.
347;Yes,BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE are both hillarious and classic comedy films.
348;but what is the best movie Adam Sandler has made?
349;and after he finds out that Vanessa has left him for an older man,funny,sad,and heartwarming events continue on for about an hour or so.
350;oK,so that may be true,but WHO CARES???!!!
351;and it's a hillarious film also.
352;With this film,Adam Sandler brought out the goofy kid he played in BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE and helped make a film that already had a lot going for it really great,really sweet,and really funny.
353;this film,without question,is a must see film.
354;It was funny, moving, and i have a whole new respect for Adam Sandler.
355;Adam Sandler just got a new fan!
356;watch it as often as I have time for.
357;This movie is one of our very favorites.
358;I have always loved Big Daddy.
359;The little boys are cute.
360;The movie itself is really good.
361;Its not the best movie but I still enjoyed it.
362;Adam Sandler was a great actor in it.
363;The little boy in the movie is so cute.
364;The movie is really funny and is really sad.
365;If you like Adam Sandler you will love this movie.
366;My top three Adam Sandler movies are: Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore, and The Wedding Singer.
367;Still one of the greatest movies by Adam Sandler!
368;It was a great deal!
369;I am not really an Adam Sandler fan, but I truley enjoyed """"Big Daddy"""", a film about a young man who walks through life without any cares or responsiblities, until a young boy shows up at his apartment one day."""
370;the movie is very funny, well.
371;written, and a joy to watch with your children.
372;I was also impressed that the film depicts homosexuals in a very positive light and even shows two beautiful men (friends of the Sandler character) kissing, allowing young children to know that being in love with someone of the same sex is alright and not abnormal.
373;Just a short story with a few laughs.
374;This is the kind of film that you want to see one time only.
375;When I saw it advertised on TV, I liked the idea because it looked and sounded funny.
376;And you'd expect it to be.
377;You just can't help but laugh.
378;Adam Sandler is great in Big Daddy.
379;Not only is the movie extremely funny, but may bring you to tears.
380;It is a great movie and I know I love it.
381;Adam Sandler is Sonny and he has to take care of his friend's kid.
382;Hey, he was good for something!
383;It was truly heart warming.
384;This a halarious film, one of Adam Sandler's best.
385;(Hence the Hooters joke) Big Daddy has its share of laughs and will certainly entertain fans who like Adam Sandler best when he plays the case of arrested development with a smart.
386;He's got a nice apartment in Manhattan.
387;But after his fed up girlfriend leaves him, he comes up with the ingenious idea to adopt a five year old boy to showcase his newfound maturity.
388;This is a great movie and it will make you laugh.
389;I would recommend this to anyone who like to laugh.
390;Big Daddy is a great movie, it is fun to watch how a kid would develop if he had almost no rules.
391;this is the movie that made me watch most Adam Sandler's movies, some were very bad movies like Waterboy and Grown Ups, but some are really fun like 50 First Dates.
392;if you like silly jokes and simple humor, this is a great movie.
393;depth movies stay away from this.
394;I ordered it at a great price and got it fast.
395;"And in ""Little Nicky"" he played the Devil's son."
396;But yet we still loved those films, and with good reason.
397;What makes this role so much better is that there's a sense of love from within.
398;"And for anyone who saw ""Billy Madison"" you see the irony here."
399;rounded character he's every played.
400;Grant it, he has the starring role, but he's with a great supporting cast.
401;Joey is particularly good here.
402;She provides more seriousness than most of his female co. stars from earlier films.
403;this movie is definetly a comedy.
404;"Anyway, Adam Sandler does something in this movie that I hope continues for him
405;Honestly this is one of my favorite Adam Sandler movies.
406;I honestly don't know why.
407;There are just so many hilarious things in this movie.
408;I think this is one of Sandler's best movies .
409;the little kid was a hoot and the storyline and supporting cast made the film enjoyable from start to end.
410;This is a great movie, all around.
411;It's got comedy like every Adam Sandler movie, but it's also got a real show of heart.
412;Overall, it's a wonderful movie.
