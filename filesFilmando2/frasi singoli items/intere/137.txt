I:8897;1;Whole family was drawn into the suspense of this movie.
I:8897;2;Afterwards we talked a lot about the Apollo program and the courage and intensity of the participants.
I:8897;3;came new, wrapped in plastic, just like in the stores, but 1/3 of the price!
I:8897;4;The movie is my favorite space true life drama.
I:8897;5;the launch scene is stunning.
I:8897;6;entry scene moves me to tears every time I watch it.
I:8897;7;the additional footage and features enhance Ron Howard's original masterpiece .
I:8897;8;as an engineer I appreciate the authenticity of his work.
I:8897;9;to me the Apollo missions are mankind's greatest achievement and this film cheapens the experience.
I:8897;10;"I recommend an excellent, but hard to get documentary on Apollo 11 called, ""Moonwalk One"" that's shown sometimes on NASA TV."
I:8897;11;It holds you spellbound and you just imagine you are watching events unfold on CNN Live.
I:8897;12;But the performance that takes the cake has to be the Ed Harris' NASA Control Centre Scientist role.
I:8897;13;I can watch this movie over and over again and still feel that rush.
I:8897;14;Thruogh the heroic efforts of the crew .
I:8897;15;Jack Swaiggert was a very competent pilot who even wrote the emergency procedures for the CM, and the crew were only worried about his ability to work the ship while they were not on it but on the LEM.
I:8897;16;But nevertheless, this is still is a great reproduction of one of the most succesful failures ever.
I:8897;17;Very rarely does a great motion picture introduce both education and entertainment in such detail.
I:8897;18;although I'm not too much into space or drama movies anymore, I was pleased to see this movie.
I:8897;19;Moreover, it touches upon the astronaut's personal lives.
I:8897;20;It includes a good plot, action, drama, mystery, and suspense that a good motion picture should have.
I:8897;21;I commend director ron howard.
I:8897;22;i also recommend getting only the 2.
I:8897;23;It's a must to understand the FULL story and understand the struggles and acheivements by NASA.
I:8897;24;My stepson worked on this movie as one of the prop people and it's amazing how much work went into it's production.
I:8897;25;Apollo 13 is a film every young adult should watch, good history lesson.
I:8897;26;I love this movie and the Blu.
I:8897;27;the additional features were a nice too.
I:8897;28;The good SF make this movie is very reality, and the actor's are the best choice to present the characters.
I:8897;29;the dts version will present you more sound detail, and best environment effect that you ever hear.
I:8897;30;This is a great movie with Toms Hanks as Jim Lovell in Apollo 13.
I:8897;31;The movie according to Jim Lovell is very true to the events of that April in 1970.
I:8897;32;This is a Ron Howard movie, so you know it's good!
I:8897;33;The weightless scenes in the movie were filmed in NASA'S training airplane, so they are very realistic.
I:8897;34;It will fill in the gaps of the movie, and really amaze you just what these three astronauts endured on the journey home to earth.
I:8897;35;The book also gives a brief explanation of what gimble lock is.
I:8897;36;I love the special features.
I:8897;37;One of my ALL TIME favorite movies!
I:8897;38;I remember this event very well.
I:8897;39;There's alot of noise on the image ie.
I:8897;40;On the good side, there are some amazing shots that TRUELY take your breath away, and you can just FEEL how 3.
I:8897;41;But it's a still satisfying experience and far from terrible by any means.
I:8897;42;Overall, it's a very clean mix.
I:8897;43;Apollo 13, Ron Howard's 1995 recreation of the star.
I:8897;44;crossed April 1970 manned mission to the moon, is a riveting and stirring film about courage and ingenuity in the face of great peril.
I:8897;45;(According to the director's commentary, this scene was written and shot to introduce the major characters of the drama and to give the viewer some idea of what life was like in the astronaut community during NASA's Apollo heyday.)
I:8897;46;"Al Shepard, the commander of Apollo 13, is grounded when an ear infection flares up, and Lovell and his crew, lunar module pilot Fred Haise (Paxton) and command module pilot Ken Mattingly (Sinise) are moved ""up the slot"" to take over."
I:8897;47;On the one hand, she's aware that this will be her husband's final mission in space, so she's proud and supportive.
I:8897;48;Hanks and Quinlan even stayed with the Lovell's to capture their characters' qualities and motivations.
I:8897;49;Bacon and Paxton are wonderful as Lovell's two crewmates, and Ed Harris portrays Flight Director Gene Krantz as a logical and determined engineer/administrator.
I:8897;50;with a stirring score by James Horner and top notch special effects, Apollo 13 is one of director Howard's finest offerings.
I:8897;51;It is fast paced, incredibly well.
I:8897;52;written and acted, and it is a fine tribute to the men and women who worked for a decade to get us to the moon and back.
I:8897;53;It is the most amazing non fiction movie i have ever seen because of the terrible odds the astronauts are up against creates intense situations and a great, inspirational movie.
I:8897;54;this movie is a classic must.
I:8897;55;as a huge fan of the space program, and someone who lived through it as an enthusiast, I applaud this film.
I:8897;56;But Hanks is a huge fan of the space program also.
I:8897;57;The casting is great, I do not sense a false note here anywhere.
I:8897;58;The film as a period piece is flawless.
I:8897;59;somebody said on the anniversary of Neil Armstrong's death, that it is nice to remember when America did great things.
I:8897;60;For those of you who were not alive when the Apollo program happened, or too young to remember, this film is a great way to get an essence of what it was like live in those times.
I:8897;61;I love to have a physical copy, but also the ability to take it on the fly.
I:8897;62;I contacted Universal the day I received it in the mail (Feb 4th) to inform them about the UV/Itunes code not working.
I:8897;63;If this does not work, please let us know more about the error message/code you received, if any.
I:8897;64;"universal Digital Copy Support""This code did work."
I:8897;65;Apollo 13 is a cinematic classic.
I:8897;66;It was one of Ron Howard's first films, and still has resonance today.
I:8897;67;Apollo 13 shows the gripping adventure on board the spaceship.
I:8897;68;Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon skillfully depict the crew's loyalty and squabbling.
I:8897;69;as well as return home alive.
I:8897;70;"Ed Harris is great as the grounded crewmember who famously said,""Failure is not an option!"""
I:8897;71;Apollo 13 is powerful and inspiring.
I:8897;72;probally 5th best of 9
I:8897;73;the film captures a tumultuous moment in American history and Ron Howard gives an uncompromising glimpse into the culture of the day.
I:8897;74;recommended for a good story and historical significance.
I:8897;75;I would recommend this movie.
I:8897;76;This movie works, because it has this incredible story, and does absolutely nothing to screw it up.
I:8897;77;ray one, because i love this movie and wanted to watch it on my non.
I:8897;78;But I thought that this movie was very engrossing and I did care about the characters (which is always important in any really good movie).
I:8897;79;I would have enjoyed the film even if it was completely fiction.
I:8897;80;hanks is great in all he does and with the combination of all the great talent and the very believable special effects in this movie it is a good strong recommendation.
I:8897;81;born person of Asian descent.
I:8897;82;apollo 13 is a fantastic showcase that shows what people (and in particular the brilliant people at NASA) are capable of under the most terrifying, horrifying circumstances imaginable.
I:8897;83;the acting, cinematography and direction in this film are absolutely faultless.
I:8897;84;I liked Tom Hanks performance in this film a lot better than Forrest Gump.
I:8897;85;which is quite amazing when you consider just how brilliant a film Forrest Gump was.
I:8897;86;but being a musician, my favourite aspect of the entire film is James Horner's magnificent, brilliant, classical score.
I:8897;87;And there's such a poignant wistfulness and romance about this music that breaks my heart.
I:8897;88;in the end, Apollo 13 (the film) showcases a part of human history that everyone should be drawing more inspiration from.
I:8897;89;NASA (and the US) became a shining example to the rest of the world, and showed what humans are truly capable of.
I:8897;90;It's a classic and my number one favourite movie of all time.
I:8897;91;Definitely one of Tom Hanks best movies ever.
I:8897;92;Also makes a good Christmas gift for anyone who loves historical dramas.
I:8897;93;This is an amazing video.
I:8897;94;What a story about how working together, brains, courage and shear guts can make suchb a differece.
I:8897;95;pure intellect saves the day.
I:8897;96;It's a give and take process, where most shots in widescreen Super 35 films are cropped but then you get shots that are definitely in true widescreen.
I:8897;97;Still, this was how it was seen in theaters and therefore this is the film seen properly.
I:8897;98;Hopefully the upcoming anniversary edition will clear up those problems with a nice new transfer.
I:8897;99;After watching the Sapphire edition of Braveheart, which was also released in 1995 and looks stunning on Blu.
I:8897;100;"I have seen this movie many times before
I:8897;101;paced, exciting and true to the history.
I:8897;102;I would recommend it to anyone .
I:8897;103;for a wonderful evening's entertainment.
I:8897;104;Director Ron Howard's APOLLO 13 won two Oscars: Best Editing and Sound, and was nominated for seven more: Best Picture, Screenplay, Supporting Actor (Ed Harris), Supporting Actress (Kathleen Quinlan), Art Direction, Effects and Music.
I:8897;105;(Watch for Roger Corman's walk.
I:8897;106;The three astronauts moved from the service module to the LM, and powered down almost everything on both ships.
I:8897;107;"A remarkable chapter in aerospace history, the saga of Apollo 13 vividly proves the clich that ""truth is stranger than fiction."""
I:8897;108;This one is a fun watch.
I:8897;109;Ron Howard's love and care for this story shows in every frame.
I:8897;110;The acting by the supporting cast is superb!
I:8897;111;Ed Harris as Gene Kranz was a perfect casting call as was Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly.
I:8897;112;This is great movie and a tribute to American pride, know how and never say die attitude of the U. s. space program!NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: A wonderful transfer of a 15 year old movie!
I:8897;113;The audio is excellent as well.
I:8897;114;"Ron Howard has captured the feel of the space program in those days
I:8897;115;Accompanied by a wonderfully stirring musical score, I believe this is director Ron Howard's finest effort to date.
I:8897;116;for those of you who lived through this era: you'll love this movie, and it will be a part of your collection.
I:8897;117;apollo 13 is one of those movies that must be seen, and I recommend it highly.
I:8897;118;I have a simple rule.
I:8897;119;If a movie based on actual events, and which you already know the outcome, can still keep you on the edge of your seat, then it is phenomenal.
I:8897;120;Wonderful job by Ron Howard, as usual.
I:8897;121;He was well supported by Bill Paxton, (who seems to get parts in a lot of great films), playing astronaut Fred Haise.
I:8897;122;He is really starting to mature as an actor.
I:8897;123;Suffice to say that it is not only educational but thoroughly moving.
I:8897;124;this work of art starring tom hanks tells the story as good as jim lovell.
I:8897;125;tells how america then in that ere set a goal, committed itself, and how many, mant people and companies pulled and worked together to turn a real life.
I:8897;126;"threatning disaster
I:8897;127;keeps you on the edge entire time.
I:8897;128;as good as from the earth to the moon.
I:8897;129;A movie gem by Ron Howard that us teaches the value of perseverance and ingenuity.
I:8897;130;The Apollo 13 movie makes you feel like you are right in the middle of it desperately trying to bring our astronauts home.
I:8897;131;I especially enjoyed Ed Harris as mission control chief Gene Kranz.
I:8897;132;Give yourself a present and watch this movie.
I:8897;133;The movie Apollo 13 is a wonderful look into a disaster that became a triumph.
I:8897;134;the cast of Apollo 13 actually made the movie come alive.
I:8897;135;Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell displays the confidence that you would expect from the mission leader.
I:8897;136;Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly is wonderful, going from the excitment of pre.
I:8897;137;Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon, and Kathleen Quinlan round out a great cast.
I:8897;138;having read the book before seeing the movie it's interesting to note that while the movie is about a 50/50 mix of action between the astronauts and Mission Control, the book is about a 75/25 split in favor of Houston.
I:8897;139;In the movie it's best to cover the essentials.
I:8897;140;It gives you great insight into all that transpired.
I:8897;141;this movie does an outstanding job of telling the story of the astronauts on this mission, as well as of the NASA ground crew that had to solve problem after problem in order to find a way to have a chance of getting the crew home safely.
I:8897;142;why this film is great:1) The acting is top.
I:8897;143;The entire cast did an outstanding job.2) This film is based on a true story that held the entire nation, perhaps the entire world, in its grip (and personally, I tend to prefer a good true story to a good fictional one)3) The re.
I:8897;144;star rating for this amazing show.
I:8897;145;star show through and through.
I:8897;146;Its an amazing account of the mercury, gemini, and apollo missions.
I:8897;147;The audio commentary by Jim and Marilyn Lovell is among the best i have ever heard.
I:8897;148;And the making of documentary is great as well.
I:8897;149;The story is wonderful, the filming meticulously done.
I:8897;150;First of all, this movie is of course awesome.
I:8897;151;The documentary is about 60 minutes long and very entertaining and interesting.
I:8897;152;but because of the lost images in wide screen format, i give it 2 stars in the end.
I:8897;153;It's handsome, taut, and thoroughly engaging.
I:8897;154;ray is obviously superior to prior releases.
I:8897;155;There is moderate film grain to the transfer, giving it a natural feel.
I:8897;156;The special effects (i. e. the launch sequence) receive the greatest benefit and the clearest visuals, but on the whole the film is beautifully rendered and, for these benefits, the Blu.
I:8897;157;ray is worth picking up.
I:8897;158;overall, the content in this package (which carries over most of the content from the last two.
I:8897;159;If you are a fan of the film and have the necessary equipment to benefit from the technical improvements in this release, it is highly recommended.
I:8897;160;HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you do so.
I:8897;161;the movie is a true story, featuring great special effects, brilliant acting, and another great directing effort from Ron Howard.
I:8897;162;Which was very fine, because it's a very fine movie.
I:8897;163;This wonderfully crafted film looks at the Apollo 13 crisis brings a lot of energy.
I:8897;164;The film has a brilliant cast, especially from Ed Harris, and wonderful direction by Ron Howard (who was snubbed an Oscar nomination).
I:8897;165;This is something to check out because you might learn something.
I:8897;166;Not just about space travel, but a lot of important things like a group of brave astronauts and.
I:8897;167;Anyway, this is a wonderful film that you should see.
I:8897;168;I absolutely love this movie!
I:8897;169;I ordered it, and it shipped within a couple of days.
I:8897;170;I highly recommend watching this movie!
I:8897;171;She really likes this movie.
I:8897;172;These are the dramas which turned a routine flight to the moon into one of the most perilous journeys ever undertaken by man which became a desperate battle for survival, fought both in space and by Mission Control, led by the persistent, unflappable Gene Kranz (Ed Harris, in his finest performance yet), who, by keeping calm, inspired his co. workers to do the same, converting a calamitous catastrophe into a triumph of humanity and technology .
I:8897;173;They, combined with the acting, screenplay, cinematography, score, and sharp, terse direction by Ron Howard, portray this movie not as a docudrama but as the sublime retelling of a piece of mankind's history and triumph.
I:8897;174;This is a great movie.
I:8897;175;Wonderful, wonderful music from James Horner supplements a solid cast, of whom Ed Harris gets most praise for his portrayal of Gene Kranz, a flight director who just won't give up.
I:8897;176;it was interesting to see the film post.
I:8897;177;One of the great subplots of the movie shows how a little duct tape, some spare parts, and a lot of ingenuity can compensate for unexpected demand on the air.
I:8897;178;i think the movie intends to show that individuals display heroism and that great achievement entails great risk for some, but also that great technical achievements float on the collaborative work of thousands of people.
I:8897;179;In general, the showcasing of antique technology (31 years old) is really cool, from the TV.
I:8897;180;"The romantic appeal of stepping on Mars aside, I'm relieved that amazing advances in computers and robotics permit us to explore the solar system ""better, faster, cheaper"" by keeping people here at home."
I:8897;181;I am a big Tom Hanks fan and enjoy the majority of his movies.
I:8897;182;Tom Hanks was smart to be involved in this movie, because it was very well done by all the actors and brought you to the edge of your seat with all the realism and drama of the actual events.
I:8897;183;Great movie and well acted by all.
I:8897;184;I owned this movie in full screen on VHS.
I:8897;185;"An incredible improvement over my 1998 60"" Standard Sony TV."
I:8897;186;If you have the right setup, it is the true home theater dream that we all hoped for since the dawn of home video back in the late 70's or early 80's.
I:8897;187;the audio track is also Great!
I:8897;188;With the right Dolby Digital/Plus 5.1 receiver/Speaker/Placement.
I:8897;189;I've watched this movie 16 times and STILL the ending makes me sob with happiness.
I:8897;190;I consider it one of the best movies ever made for suspense and drama, and I can't imagine what the audience reaction would have been watching this in a big theatre.
I:8897;191;star reviewers are just upset about the discs, delivery delay, etc.
I:8897;192;Now that we are moving toward a moon colony and a trip to Mars, it's time to remember the heros who got us here.
I:8897;193;Everything about this movie is fantastic.
I:8897;194;There's a great story, great acting, and extremely realistic special effects.
I:8897;195;I was amazed at how I was at the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie, even though I knew how it turned out.
I:8897;196;Ron Howard did an unbelievable job of keeping up the suspense.
I:8897;197;Enough about the movie though, everyone has seen it.
I:8897;198;Most surprisingly you find out that things you thought were made up, are actually true.
I:8897;199;It was a very interesting addition.
I:8897;200;Apollo 13 is the perfect film to watch after the Columbia Tragedy.
I:8897;201;the Acting,sound,and look of this film is a Masterpiece.
I:8897;202;ron Howard should have gotten an Oscar,along with everyone else in the film.
I:8897;203;let you kids watch this movie TONIGHT instead of some R Rated flick.
I:8897;204;this movie is one of the best made, not just of a certain year.
I:8897;205;Ron Howard has a genius at work in the direction of this movie.
I:8897;206;The parts suited the actors well especially ken Mattingly .
I:8897;207;There was just the right amount of tech jargin to keep the scientifically minded entertained without it being dull.
I:8897;208;I always hunt for the Howard family as Ron uses them in every film.
I:8897;209;I, therefore, would just like categorize this as a great movie that triumphs the imagination, inventiveness, and creative ability of the human person.
I:8897;210;"Looking back at the reality of this historical event, it shines as one of our country's ""finest hours."
I:8897;211;The great acting and directing put us right there in the middle of the drama.
I:8897;212;Great, true story that highlights the incredible bravery of our astronauts and the tremendous technological feats of the Apollo program, while hinting at the creeping bureaucracy that eventually led to the Challenger and Columbia disasters.
I:8897;213;Fantastic family viewing, providing great role models and an opportunity to discuss many societal issues.
I:8897;214;I watched this again for the first time in many years, and I still liked it as much this time as I did when I last saw it over a decade ago.
I:8897;215;I also find it particularly engaging in the fact that it takes an event in history and portray it true to the real events without having to add any fictional characters to keep the audience intrigued.
I:8897;216;This movie is very inspiring and really demonstrates NASA's greatest success.
I:8897;217;This is a very good movie based on a true story, a must have for anyones collection.
I:8897;218;My kids loved it too.
I:8897;219;This is one of those feel good films that everyone in my family wants to watch over and over again.
I:8897;220;Highly recommended, even if you have already seen it when it first came out!
I:8897;221;perfect score that I received on my final exam.
I:8897;222;as for the movie, it's a good one if you like claustrophbic situations in sub.
I:8897;223;Nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture, Apollo 13 is one of the best movies of its decade.
I:8897;224;Despite prior knowledge of the historical outcome, it's guaranteed to keep viewers steeped in suspense.
I:8897;225;Director Ron Howard creates yet another fantastic picture, solidifying his transformation from Mayberry's favorite son on Andy Griffith to one of the most accomplished director/producers in all of Hollywood.
I:8897;226;Standout performances by Gary Sinise and Tom Hanks (on the heels of their Oscar.
I:8897;227;caliber portrayals from Forrest Gump) make Apollo 13 especially enticing to the movie connoisseur.
I:8897;228;Based on the true story of the Apollo 13 mission, the film stirs emotions of all types .
I:8897;229;In the end, it's one of those rare movies where the characters are able to intimately connect with the audience.
I:8897;230;In short, Apollo 13 provides a true glimpse into the lives of those who defined history.
I:8897;231;tom Hanks plays the role of real life astronaut Jim Lovell, member of the three man crew of Apollo 13 .
I:8897;232;As the minutes pass, the entire world holds its breath in anticipation of the outcome.
I:8897;233;Apollo 13 hit the movie theaters with widespread anticipation.
I:8897;234;But what makes Apollo 13 such a strong and emotion.
I:8897;235;driven epic is its connection with the historical record.
I:8897;236;The men who flew the Apollo 13 mission were true heroes in every sense of the word.
I:8897;237;Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, and their colleagues do justice to this classic story of man's triumph over adversity.
I:8897;238;Compelling, suspenseful, and filled with drama, Apollo 13 is an unforgettable film .
I:8897;239;Rod Howard's best film by far.
I:8897;240;"It should have won Oscars for Best Picture and for Best Director (""Braveheart"" and Mel Gibson ."
I:8897;241;Even with the wonderful acting, directing and cinematography .
I:8897;242;"the best parts of ""Apollo 13"" deal with the creativity and daring that NASA had in the earlier days of our space program."
I:8897;243;Very sharp picture with vivid colors.
I:8897;244;The movie itself deserves 5 stars, but what really puts this version over the top is the commentary by Jim Lovell and his wife.
I:8897;245;He and his wife have interesting things to say about every scene in the movie.
I:8897;246;If you like space, engineering, or if your spouse has ever been in the military, you will be fascinated by their tale that was just as dramatic in real life as the movie version.
I:8897;247;this is a true collector's item that I will make my kids and grandkids watch.
I:8897;248;You know the movie's good when one of the very astronauts from that mission, Jim Lovell along with his wife Marilyn, have their own commentary track, during which they discuss what a fine job Ron Howard did with the movie.
I:8897;249;all that aside, I was really impressed with the film, even knowing almost nothing about the actual events myself.
I:8897;250;The film's musical score captured the feeling perfectly and the cast probably couldn't have been more well.
I:8897;251;If you haven't seen this movie yet I wholeheartedly recommend it.
I:8897;252;You gotta take a second look at this film.
I:8897;253;well, I say this: It's not about the space program or the facts of the whole incident that nearly cost three lives during the space program, it's about how afew individuals pulled together at a crucial time to save another life.
I:8897;254;look at it and see how moving, how amazing the stars of this film pulled this offright before your very eyes.
I:8897;255;i say again, this film is a great one!!
I:8897;256;This movie is very well done, with solid performances by a really excellent cast.
I:8897;257;Great movie, packed with stars and action but the streaming was nowhere near high definition.
I:8897;258;Great movie plus brings back memories of the late 60's and early 70's.
I:8897;259;If you are a fan of the Apollo missions there is good actual footage shown.
I:8897;260;Always enjoy watching this mostly.
I:8897;261;I always get a sense of mankind's achievement and a national pride when an entire mission control, their staff, and the manufacturers behind all the technology rally together to bring 3 men home in the deep span of space.
I:8897;262;I have really enjoyed shopping with you .
I:8897;263;thankyou for a great sale .
I:8897;264;something the entire family can really enjoy and great service receiving .
I:8897;265;will shop again Many thanks!!
I:8897;266;Even with Apollo program long gone, viewers of all ages need to experience the grit and creativity of those in the space program!
I:8897;267;Bonus video has actual footage.
I:8897;268;Although it is older now, the leadership examples are excellent.
I:8897;269;ray transfer is great as well.
I:8897;270;A great companion movie to the excellent book, APOLLO reading that book made me want to get a blu ray copy of this movie.
I:8897;271;at any rate, I am happy to have the new disk.
I:8897;272;This is one of those movies that really makes you think.
I:8897;273;the actors in the film do an excellent job, and with good reason.
I:8897;274;The acting is so good, that parts of the film make you feel as though you are there in the capsule with these men.
I:8897;275;It is acceptable for children, and might even teach them a thing or two about the history of manned spaceflight.
I:8897;276;I grew up with the space program and this film brought back a young child's nostalgia.
I:8897;277;Tom Hanks is brilliant as Jim Lovell.
I:8897;278;The all star cast did a wonderful job as well.
I:8897;279;The cinematography and FX were excellent and made you feel like part of the action.
I:8897;280;100 years from now this movie may well be viewed more often than the actual Apollo footage.
I:8897;281;Apollo 13 is one of the better movies that Tom Hanks stars in.
I:8897;282;winner:Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton), who have been training to go in Space and Walk on the Moon.
I:8897;283;winner:Ron Howard (Williow, Far and Away, A Beautiful Mind) has made a well made film, which is Based on a True Story.
I:8897;284;Fine Performances by Hanks, Bacon, Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris(In a Oscar Nominated Role), and Kathleen Quinlan (In a Oscar Nominated Role).
I:8897;285;Great Visual Effects by Digital Domain.
I:8897;286;This was a great movie and the Amazon.
I:8897;287;This is an incredible movie.
I:8897;288;Tom Hanks is fantastic in this movie.
I:8897;289;A wonderfully told story about a piece of American history.
I:8897;290;Amazing story about the space program and inspirational elements of traveling to thw moon.
I:8897;291;The story is good and well adapted for ordinary people.
I:8897;292;it is easy to understand what those astronautes lived during their return to Earth.
I:8897;293;It's a question that probably enters a lot of director's minds when they film a movie based on a true story: how do you make it exciting and interesting even when we know the results of the real event?
I:8897;294;Yes the astronauts do survive, although one died several years later but still the movie manages to be thrilling.
I:8897;295;one of my favorite scenes in the film and probably a good indicator of what the film can do, is when the crew fires it's engines in hopes to pick up some speed and return home quicker.
I:8897;296;They take a simple idea of keeping the Earth in a window and make it quite exciting.
I:8897;297;And it's what the film does best: it takes the simplest things or the most well.
I:8897;298;known event and makes it suspenseful, almost making you forget they'll be fine.
I:8897;299;the human drama scenes are nicely played but it's the suspense scenes and the neat.
I:8897;300;hell space shots of the shuttle that look the most impressive but still the film is a good watch.
I:8897;301;True story with great actors.
I:8897;302;The teamwork and bravery of everyone involved makes me proud to be an American!
I:8897;303;Bought this yesterday and was looking forward to seeing it in hi.
I:8897;304;"I finally found that you have to press the ""top menu"" button to get the movie to resume."
I:8897;305;the movie itself is extremely good and works very well in hi.
I:8897;306;def (some shots, especially of archived news footage does appear a bit grainy but that's not the movies fault) and there are some very good extras on the disc (the making of presentation is definately worth watching).
I:8897;307;This film is about as good as they get.
I:8897;308;Tom Hanks is at his finest.
I:8897;309;Gary Sinise is wonderful and Bill Paxton plays his best character to date.
I:8897;310;Kevin Bacon is great as well.
I:8897;311;You feel like you're watching a fascinating inside look at NASA and the filming is incredible.
I:8897;312;Wonderful film on all levels.
I:8897;313;love the fact that it is based on real life events.
I:8897;314;Good acting and the film is 95% spot on from what really happened!
I:8897;315;Did a lot of research and all the major events are real and spot on.
I:8897;316;Some of the smaller dialogs are fictional but makes a perfect movie!
I:8897;317;It's good storytelling and so interesting that it led me to study the real Apollo 13 astronauts.
I:8897;318;rating acting, both of which should keep anyone's interest.
I:8897;319;Knowing this was a true story makes one all the more involved with it.
I:8897;320;You can bet, in real life, a lot of prayers were answered on this mission.
I:8897;321;Good story, beautiful video and great sound.
I:8897;322;Turn your volume up on the blast.
I:8897;323;off and you will feel the power!
I:8897;324;But this is certainly the case with Apollo 13.
I:8897;325;Perhaps Ron Howard's best film, it is an exciting, harrowing, and ultimately rewarding film.
I:8897;326;the casual viewer will be surprised at the depth and nuance the performances of Gary Sinese and Bill Paxton.
I:8897;327;"is a remarkable feat of cinematic sleight of hand, and I am still shocked and dismayed that Howard did not win the ""best director"" Oscar."
I:8897;328;There has never been a movie that uses special effects so effectively as this one.
I:8897;329;the story is likely well.
I:8897;330;He does not neglect the peripheral members of the NASA team, and pays special attention to Lovell's wife and family.
I:8897;331;It's instructive to note that the longer version is a more effective film, since he spends more time developing the relationships that allow us to care for the characters.
I:8897;332;Marilyn: Well, it was the style at the time.
I:8897;333;star movie on a 5.
I:8897;334;Pretty fair game for a space type of movie.
I:8897;335;He played Tom Hanks' son.
I:8897;336;Overall it was a fairly good movie though.
I:8897;337;In addition to the movie there are many special features showing how they made the movie, as well as interviews with the actors and astronauts.
I:8897;338;Unlike most movies, this one has aged really, really well.
I:8897;339;The kids (16, 13, 10, and 10)loved it too.
I:8897;340;The code was good and applied to my account.
I:8897;341;This movie tells the epic story of Apollo 13 while remaining technically correct.
I:8897;342;Apollo 13 is a tremendous cinematic achievement, just as the rescue of the Apollo 13 spacecraft during the actual mission was a tremendous technical achievement.
I:8897;343;apollo 13 is a tear.
I:8897;344;It is fun to listen to Jim and Marilyn Lovell with their take on the events as they unfolded.
I:8897;345;Ron Howard also adds a great deal of interest with his commentary.
I:8897;346;apollo 13 is a timeless movie.
I:8897;347;It probably resonates more with those who actually experienced the event on some level, but it truly gives an amazing picture of how we went to the moon, and how much more amazing it was because of the technology we did it with.
I:8897;348;star, the direction, the cast, the story, all working together to produce the recreation of real.
I:8897;349;life high drama!All the pieces of the story are tightly woven together to tell a riveting tale that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat and takes them on an emotional roller coaster.
I:8897;350;Though it is very hollywood, to the point of being rediculas, it's still an entertaining movie with powerful music and sound.
I:8897;351;From what I've researched, this movie does a fairly accurate job of showing what happened with the Apollo 13 mission.
I:8897;352;The special effects were done so well you feel like you're right there with the astronauts.
I:8897;353;Great documentary of the space mission that almost got lost in space.
I:8897;354;told and riveting tale of what happened on that ill.
I:8897;355;The story is well known, so I won't belabor it.
I:8897;356;thanks for keeping this movie on amazon.
I:8897;357;born classic on the small screen.
I:8897;358;And considering that computer and graphics effects haven't really taken off until quite recently, this film is still a spectacular cinematic accomplishment.
I:8897;359;Directed by Ron Howard (whom we all can't help but think of as little Opie Taylor), it's excellent historical.
I:8897;360;well, I can't really say fiction because it's reenactments of the real events.
I:8897;361;Jim Lovell among others gives this film excellent ratings, because of the accuracy of the story.
I:8897;362;It is a griping story of survival and the American spirit of endurance and courage, and one that has particular significance given the even more recent events surrounding the crew of space shuttle Columbia, and its tragic story.
I:8897;363;The drama, suspense, and thrill of watching this story unfold on the screen is a really awesome experience.
I:8897;364;The fact that it really happened adds a lot to the story.
I:8897;365;If you simply keep it on the main menu, the film's ENTIRE FILM SCORE will play through.
I:8897;366;And this music is really something to listen to, just by itself.
I:8897;367;bAD: There is a bucket.
I:8897;368;load of swear words included in the film.
I:8897;369;There are some scary elements, but it's the real world we're talking here, so we aren't going to see monsters or scary apparitions like that.
I:8897;370;In an opening scene, Tom Hanks' Jim Lovell has a gathering at his house to watch the moon landing, and one scoundrel of an astronaut is shown describing to his girlfriend the excitement of guiding a probe into its destination, and how satisfying it is.
I:8897;371;tHOUGHTS: All the bad elements aside, this movie is a great watch.
I:8897;372;Family members of all ages will most likely enjoy not only the action, but will get a history lesson out of it as well.
I:8897;373;As previously stated, the music is wonderful, the acting is great, and the visual effects are fantastic.
I:8897;374;Apart from the few bad elements (which I only highlight because you have the right to know), I really do enjoy this movie, and I think you will as well.8 out of 10 stars.
I:8897;375;Such a great story and told so well.
I:8897;376;This was one of America's finest hours and a great national success .
I:8897;377;If there was ever a Private Ryan of space this is it.
I:8897;378;The film is a remarkable production and gives only a little artistic license for effect.
I:8897;379;All in all a thorough recommendation with solid presentation of a high technical standard.
I:8897;380;The clarity and the content are production editing at its very best.
I:8897;381;This two disc special edition of Apollo 13 is awesome one the best two disc movies you'll ever own.
I:8897;382;I received the Apollo 13 video.
I:8897;383;crafted and truly inspiring motion picture, based on the actual events of the nearly.
I:8897;384;director Ron Howard guides this project with passion.
I:8897;385;A passion that seems to be equally shared by each and every one of his starring actors on screen .
I:8897;386;appealing Kathleen Quinlan, as Hanks' wife.
I:8897;387;Quinlan and Howard worked together more than two decades prior to this movie .
I:8897;388;three astronauts' lives hang in the balance during the last half of this finely.
I:8897;389;This is the perfect screen shape for this film, in my view .
I:8897;390;nice and w. i. d. e! And it looks great via this anamorphically.
I:8897;391;This feature, which runs 58 minutes, begins with a nicely well.
I:8897;392;Director Ron Howard, and the cast members, add much insight into the making of this technically.
I:8897;393;Apollo 13 is a good film to re.
I:8897;394;I enjoyed watching this film, showcasing the troubles of the apollo flight to the moon.
I:8897;395;i dont think i can add much more than what others have said, but will just say that it skillfully combines a great story with suspense and deep characterizations.
I:8897;396;I love movies and have an extensive collection, but I bought this for my granddaughter.
I:8897;397;She loves Tom Hanks and can't get enough history and recent information about astronauts and the space program.
I:8897;398;Because this movie means so much to her, I decided she needed to own it.
I:8897;399;She had tears in her eyes when I gave it to her.
I:8897;400;It is much better viewing it in Blu.
I:8897;401;Whether you know the ending or whether you were otherwise occupied at the time in 1970, the tension created and maintained by the fine script (by William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert with uncredited help from John Sayles) and the direction of Ron Howard will compel your interest.
I:8897;402;part of the success of this movie goes to the fine acting by Tom Hanks, who is, in a professional and psychological sense, very much like those fly boys with the Right Stuff who fearlessly left our comfort cocoon here on earth and ventured into the cold, dark airlessness of space for glory and honor and maybe for proof of their manhood.
I:8897;403;Like the astronauts depicted, Tom Hanks is always on task and always delivers an arresting and believable performance.
I:8897;404;ed Harris, who played the flight director in Houston was also excellent as was Kevin Bacon as the replacement astronaut who had to fly the ship.
I:8897;405;In fact the entire cast, especially a whole lot of people with small roles as part of the nearly anonymous support techno nerds at NASA, gave believable and compelling performances.
I:8897;406;A lot of the credit for that has to go to Ron Howard, who made sure that they all looked the way they were suppose to look.
I:8897;407;i also was very much moved by the musical score by James Horner.
I:8897;408;When you have an extraterrestrial epic, you need the music of the spheres, and Horner provided that.
I:8897;409;The music was so triumphantly married to the events and to the cosmic adventure, that it inspired without drawing undue attention to itself.
I:8897;410;It is one of the most beautiful film scores I have ever heard.
I:8897;411;although this was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it won only two, for Best Film Editing and Best Sound.
I:8897;412;It is a heroic epic, with a worthy theme, professionally done.
I:8897;413;Although the sheer horror of dying in the cold vacuum of space or being burned up by a too rapid descent into the atmosphere is kept very much on our minds, there is a level of psychological reality that lives within the heart and soul of the astronaut and within the astronaut's family that was attempted here but not entirely achieved.
I:8897;414;see this for Ron Howard who did a great job as director and for Tom Hanks, one of the most charismatic actors of our time, and especially for astronaut Jim Lovell who lived it and (with help from Jeffrey Kluger) wrote the book Lost Moon (1994) upon which the film was based.
I:8897;415;This is by far one of the best movies ever made.
I:8897;416;The way that director Ron Howard and his team put the film together is truly amazing.
I:8897;417;Also, the scenes transition beautifully with great color ambience combined with avid camera angles.
I:8897;418;Additionally, the filming aspects clearly indicate an attention for detail and authenticity.
I:8897;419;star cast including Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise puts on a terrific performance as they portray their characters as dynamically as possible.
I:8897;420;Nevertheless, Ed Harris put on the best overall presentation with the exception of Hanks.
I:8897;421;His intensity and overall screen appearance are incredibly realistic, and they cause the viewer to forget that he is watching a movie but rather viewing the action live.
I:8897;422;Lastly, the sound effects and musical compositions put the icing on the cake.
I:8897;423;The sound synchronization as well as the emotionally appealed soundtracks accent the action on the screen in a way that creates the full film experience.
I:8897;424;Thus, all of the technical aspects as well as those of the sheer entertainment value contribute parts to form an excellent whole as the film Apollo 13.
I:8897;425;Apollo 13 has always been one of our favorites so when I found it at a great price I snapped it up
I:8897;426;This movie captures the mood of the time and the joy of that moment on April 17th when radio contact resumed after re.
I:8897;427;this is an excellent ride, as one of the astronauts once said.
I:8897;428;if this review was helpful, please add your vote.
I:8897;429;This is an awesome movie, back when we had heroes.
I:8897;430;my father had a role in the space program, so the movie has special resonance for us.
I:8897;431;The video transfer was excellent, no flaws.
I:8897;432;The DTS sound was great.
I:8897;433;i strongly recommend this DTS.
I:8897;434;Ron Howrd's Apollo 13, while being one of the most historically accurate movies ever made, is full of fun for people of all ages: special effects for computer animation buffs, a space story for smaller children into that sort of thing, and an emotional drive full of suspense and drama that will satisfy almost anyone who sees this movie.
I:8897;435;The performances by Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are nothing short of excellent, and their changes from one mood to the next are handled with the kind of talent that should be existent in all movies.
I:8897;436;The special effects, done by the effects king Digital Domain, put the viewers in space with the astronauts, making this movie more believable.
I:8897;437;James Horner's moving score adds depth to the emotional experience, evincing sypmathy and suspense throughout.
I:8897;438;This movie is one of Hollywood's finest movies, and restores my faith in filmmaking.
I:8897;439;Obviously, it takes oxygen to breathe, so now what?
I:8897;440;Director Ron Howard recreates this gripping, compelling story, right down to beehive hairdo's and computers the size of Mt. Rushmore.
I:8897;441;is so powerful and vivid I felt I was watching the actual event itself.
I:8897;442;To magically weave the viewer into the story is a crowning achievement for any filmmaker, and here, Howard succeeds like a wizard waving a wand.
I:8897;443;"I remember being glued to the TV watching Walter Cronkite broadcast around the clock to give us the latest developments of the Apollo 13 story
I:8897;444;of this event is an awesome experience, and APOLLO 13 is awesome, indeed.
I:8897;445;I ordered it as a gift.
I:8897;446;these gents got a pass with the incredible staff and ingenious collaboration of so many men and perhaps women at that time, hey they took care of business as well.
I:8897;447;I could never imagine such a feat of triumph of human spirit and ingenuity to overcome such odds and found this film beyond expectations for brimming with strength and positive emotion.
I:8897;448;this is a true story and think that we should focus on our ability to transcend such horrors with confidence to achieve goals that supercede expected outcomes.
I:8897;449;one of the finest films to demo this spirit to date!!
I:8897;450;Even though you know what i going to happen it is still full of suspense.
I:8897;451;Very entertaining and fact filled movie.
I:8897;452;it was in good shape and no scratches and good movieand i love this movie and the actors were good in it
I:8897;453;"It was one of the most amazing things I had ever seen, yet I never thought much about that event until I saw ""Apollo 13."""
I:8897;454;shot that I had seen so many years ago.
I:8897;455;tom Hanks is terrific as Jim Lovell, the heroic leader of the mission whose resolve helped his crew survive.
I:8897;456;Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are very good as his fellow astronauts, and Gary Sinise and Ed Harris are excellent as the ground crew struggling to bring their men home.
I:8897;457;Director Ron Howard has turned out a number of good movies during the last 25 years, but this has to rank as his best to date.
I:8897;458;This is definitely worth adding to your home viewing collection.
I:8897;459;As it seems many other reviews have noted, Apollo 13 is a great film.
I:8897;460;It captures a gripping story with good detail and technical accuracy.
I:8897;461;Throughout the film, special effects really bring the scenes to life.
I:8897;462;I was pleasantly surprised to find that the documentary had actual content and wasn't just a bumch of clips from the film.
I:8897;463;In the documentary you'll learn how the story was woven into scenes in the movie and get a much better idea of how well done the movie is.
I:8897;464;This movie is one of the best.
I:8897;465;Loved it when I first saw it.
I:8897;466;This time I watched it with my kids 11 and 14.
I:8897;467;Great acting and drama plus it shows perseverence and problem solving in action and makes scientists look cool.
I:8897;468;Having worked at and retired from the Kennedy Space Center, this film most definitely satisfied my personal and professional needs for truth, accuracy, and realism in its creation.
I:8897;469;Ron Howard did a masterful job of directing, and there was an obvious quest for excellence by all who participated in all aspects producing this fine film.
I:8897;470;"But from the perspective of someone who actually is a ""rocket scientist,"" I can assure you of its veracity, which was enhanced by some of the filming locations, and most prominently by the actors who were cast in the various important roles."
I:8897;471;the perfect casting, if you will, As Jim Lovell.
I:8897;472;Bill Paxton was outstanding, and Kevin Bacon's was low.
I:8897;473;The entire story is graphic proof that truth is often much more impactful than the finest fiction.
I:8897;474;Ron Howard is right in his comfort zone in this dramatic retelling of an early NASA near.
I:8897;475;star cast and an excellent script, it's a lesson in efficient, powerful big.
I:8897;476;Like you might expect from a Hanks / Howard collaboration, it has more than its share of soft.
I:8897;477;hearted emotions, but a good sense of humor and convincing special effects help to compensate.
I:8897;478;Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan star in a heroic story based on the book Lost Moon by former astronaut Jim Lovell, the main character of this awesome film.
I:8897;479;After aborting their main mission, the new objective is to make it back to Earth.
I:8897;480;A great film directed with maximum energy by Ron Howard (later directed Ransom starring Mel Gibson and Gary Sinise, an Apollo 13 cast member).
I:8897;481;Tom Hank's, a true story, genius' racing against the odds and the clock.
I:8897;482;I remember really liking this movie when it came out in 1995 .
I:8897;483;I realize now why this is such a great movie .
I:8897;484;"The actual events were so incredibly dramatic that they didn't need to ""Hollywoodize"" the story."
I:8897;485;Sure, the casting, the production, the effects, and the acting are top notch.
I:8897;486;But it really is the screenplay that makes this movie such a success .
I:8897;487;because the actual story is just so good that they didn't need to screw it up.
I:8897;488;This movie has great acting.
I:8897;489;Highly recommended in this format.
I:8897;490;Ron Howard directs and Tom Hanks stars in one of the best movies made about the US space program and the miracles it worked in the 60's an 70's.
I:8897;491;I've stood in the training facility at NASA's Johnson Space Center and had a veteran astronaut tell me that this film is very realistic.
I:8897;492;"I really enjoyed the way Ron Howard used the C.130 ""vomit comet"" aircraft, normally used for weightless training, to simulate the weightless environment astronauts live in."
I:8897;493;This movie is a must.
I:8897;494;"see ""Astronauts and Other Exciting Careers in Space,"" a film we made to take young people through an entire space shuttle mission."
I:8897;495;Ron Howard has directed some very good films.
I:8897;496;Of course, anyone who knows history already knows the outcome of the film, yet Howard has created such sympathetic characters, wrapped around such a deeply suspenseful, tautly.
I:8897;497;The astronauts are played by Tom Hanks and Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon, and they are all quite good.
I:8897;498;The supporting cast is likewise superb .
I:8897;499;bound astronaut, and Kathleen Quinlan as Hanks' wife in another oscar.
I:8897;500;In fact, this is probably the best cast of any Howard film.
I:8897;501;the film is fairly rooted in hard science, and it reflects accurately the technology of the time.
I:8897;502;It's funny to see slide rulers being used or to hear about wonderful computers that only take up one room and can do thousands of calculations per second.
I:8897;503;It is truly amazing that the average desktop computer nowadays has more computing power and capability than all the computers that helped to send the brave astronauts of the entire Apollo program into space.
I:8897;504;But it's quite amazing, especially in the lift.
I:8897;505;I will always remember those tense three days in April 1970 when the Apollo 13 astronauts seemed suspended in space, and this was well before the days of 24.
I:8897;506;disc set is a must.
I:8897;507;One would think that knowing the ending would rob the viewer of the suspense factor, but Howard does an amazing job in making the story feel fresh by guiding us through the heroic acts both in the capsule and at NASA's Mission Control in vividly realistic detail.
I:8897;508;He also evokes the atmosphere back then with emotional and visual accuracy, showing how anti.
I:8897;509;climactic the mission was perceived in light of Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon just the year prior.
I:8897;510;He realizes the real story is more than enough to engage the viewer and that the attention to detail, often technical in nature, is not off.
I:8897;511;The movie has a solid testosterone.
I:8897;512;This is a superbly done real.
I:8897;513;"life adventure film and docudrama and aside from Philip Kaufman's 1983 adaptation of Tom Wolfe's ""The Right Stuff"", probably the best movie about the space program."
I:8897;514;minute IMAX version (produced in 2002) is on the second disc, and the widescreen orientation coupled with the enhanced sound makes for great viewing as well.
I:8897;515;"The Making of Apollo 13"", which has interviews with Howard and the cast, as well as insight into how the space shots were created
I:8897;516;There are two alternative commentary tracks, the first with Howard who is extremely knowledgeable and highly infectious in his descriptions of the shoot, the other with Jim and Marilyn Lovell providing valuable insight as to how it really felt as the events were unfolding.
I:8897;517;You know what happens, but you still find yourself on the edge of your seat.
I:8897;518;other than those minor nitpicks, I REALLY enjoyed this film.
I:8897;519;I didn't obsess over the missed details, mind you.
I:8897;520;This is, after all, a hollywood adaptation of Jim Lovell's recounting.
I:8897;521;As entertainment value goes, it was wonderful!
I:8897;522;all, pretty close to the reality of the situation.
I:8897;523;And what it lacked in accuracy, it more than made up for in sheer entertainment value.
I:8897;524;Keeps you on edge of seat.
I:8897;525;really tells the story of the space program at that time.
I:8897;526;So the film Apollo 13 should be considered fiction.
I:8897;527;The acting in Apollo 13 is great.
I:8897;528;But I watched it again recently and decided to add one star in my rating because of the great acting.)
I:8897;529;A great piece of history portrayed well.
I:8897;530;Ron Howard you did it again, the best!
I:8897;531;The clarity is wonderful, the sound is full and powerful.
I:8897;532;I would say this is a great movie for a gift.
I:8897;533;i bought this for my mom who absolutely loves this movie.
I:8897;534;it was the perfect gift!
I:8897;535;it is a fantastic movie.
I:8897;536;This is a long movie, and it certainly seems like it.
I:8897;537;Now this is a good film.
I:8897;538;it describes perfectly the terror of a struggle for live millions of miles away from home.
I:8897;539;ray movie back to Amazon when I came and read the other reviewers comments.
I:8897;540;catastrophic saga of Apollo 13.
I:8897;541;ron Howard's gripping 1995 epic shows us how the tragedy unfolded before an America that had become complacent, and also how some very sharp minds at Mission Control ensured that this most perilous spaceflight had a triumphant conclusion.
I:8897;542;"Based on the book ""Lost Moon"" by Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger, APOLLO 13 gets great performances from the three."
I:8897;543;man team of Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon, as well as first.
I:8897;544;APOLLO 13 gives credit to both the crew and the entire Mission Control staff for having made the flight come to a successful conclusion when it could have ended in irreversable tragedy.
I:8897;545;Scientifically accurate special effects and James Horner's Copland.
I:8897;546;influenced music score are the icing on this, one of the best movies of the Nineties.
I:8897;547;Great movie and good historical review
I:8897;548;This movie is easily in my top 5 favorite movies of all time so this review has NOTHING to do with the film itself.
I:8897;549;Alright, this film is a classic.
I:8897;550;Some of my best childhood memories involved me watching this with my dad, it sparked a life.
I:8897;551;I held out for a release that had something that made it worth the double dip.
I:8897;552;You can return to the film eventually.
I:8897;553;It's a great movie based off true events, a good reminder of the real life dangers that people face when testing new technologies.
I:8897;554;I enjoyed all the actors, they played their roles very well!We streamed Amazon Instant Video on our PS3 over wifi.
I:8897;555;this time,i thought it was brilliant.
I:8897;556;i thought the story flowed perfectly,and the tension mounted at just the right tempo and hung there until the very end.
I:8897;557;the acting was spot on.
I:8897;558;and the music added the perfect atmosphere.
I:8897;559;i haven't seen too many Ron Howard film's,but this is one of the best that i have seen of his.
I:8897;560;Old but good, worth watching and a true story.
I:8897;561;Acting directing and script all first class, good way to kill a few hours.
I:8897;562;Directed by Ron Howard and headlined by Tom Hanks, this film opens with the landing of Neil Armstrong on the moon.
I:8897;563;We see his life, his colleagues, and the hard work that goes into such an undertaking.
I:8897;564;This film is powerful and ultimately cheering with a good accompanying score.
I:8897;565;Howard does a wonderful job transporting us back to that time however I would have liked more back story on the astronauts leading up to their mission.
I:8897;566;This is an excellent real story movie, very good performances, a master piece of art
I:8897;567;Fun to watch and watch again.
I:8897;568;This is absolutly one of Tom Hanks best!!
I:8897;569;The special effects are the best I've seen in a long time!
I:8897;570;This is a great family film with lots of action and suspense.
I:8897;571;Great cast, I stayed entertained the entire length of the film, and was left cheering at the end!
I:8897;572;And the sound effects are so crisp and clear, you'll definately be transported to the moon and back in this inspiring tale of true heroism.
I:8897;573;This is a fabulous movie!
I:8897;574;I agree with all the praise the other reviewers have given this amazing film.
I:8897;575;"g simulation aircraft (the infamous ""Vomit Comet"") shows the dedication the actors and crew to making an outstanding movie, considering the physical discomfort they were subjected to and the many retakes that had to be performed due to the maximum limit of 20."
I:8897;576;This film is enjoyable, not only to the casual viewer who has little interest in the Apollo moon.
I:8897;577;landing program, but also those with considerable knowledge find it a pleasure to watch.
I:8897;578;While it is true that on all the missions prior to Apollo 13, the CMP was an experienced astronaut, flight.
I:8897;579;I highly recommend the blu.
I:8897;580;This is NASA finest hour and the director leaves the viewer cheering as the men survive their ordeals.
I:8897;581;Working around the clock the team considers all the available resources, amount of power, and time remaining.
I:8897;582;The group leader brings the supplies of the available resources and dumps them on a table.
I:8897;583;A solution is discovered and the steps detailed.
I:8897;584;The system works and saves the lives of the crew.
I:8897;585;Splash down was great and I cheered NASA acheivement and consider this a great film of the power of the human spirit.
I:8897;586;Truly one of the great films made in the 90's.
I:8897;587;The (true) story by itself is hugely compelling, but it is executed amazingly well.
I:8897;588;g scenes shot on the vomit comet airplane add incredible realism too!
I:8897;589;I love this movie because it is of great didactic utility on the subject of Crisis Management.
I:8897;590;It is also a source of inspiration for me.
I:8897;591;Even though we know the outcome of this wonderful movie, we are kept on the edge of our seats throughout, just in case things change.
I:8897;592;One of those rare movies that's so well done that even though I know the story and the outcome, I'm on the edge of my seat every time I see it!
I:8897;593;This was a very good film and Tom Hanks was great in it.
I:8897;594;It had me at the edge of my seat during their final 4 minutes of reentry.
I:8897;595;She said she is going to recommend it to all her friends!
I:8897;596;I recommend this movie to anyone !
I:8897;597;Looking past the Big Names and high budget production, there was a lot of great acting done by the supporting characters.
I:8897;598;I was impressed by the protrayals of the ground crew and how each actor made the crew real people.
I:8897;599;other than the sexual conitations in the opening scenes, this is a good, clean movie and would recomend it for anybody 14 and up.
I:8897;600;Not younger because the climax is a little intense, even if you do know the outcome.
I:8897;601;This statement of Robert Kennedy illustrates with premonitory accuracy, the anguish moments lived not only in USA but the rest of the world in those early seventies.
I:8897;602;ron Howard knew recreate with all the possible realism those hard times with a superb cast a supeb stage and a very adjusted script despite certain common places.
I:8897;603;this film despite not having won the most important prize of the Academy deserves with wide argumentation to be in the elite of the top ten best American Films in the Nineties.
I:8897;604;That is why I ordered it in Blue Ray was really looking forward to seeing it again with this new technology.
I:8897;605;Think I will chalk this up to things happen.
I:8897;606;keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:8897;607;The lauch sequence is so intense with the Dolby Digital 5.1 that it woke up my neighbours one night(SORRY)!
I:8897;608;Tom Hanks is amazing and the message is good.
I:8897;609;Great for high school and college students to see.
I:8897;610;This movie is excellent in many ways: the acting, the depiction of space travel, and most of all the illustration of how human actions contribute to both failure and success.
I:8897;611;Based on the actual Apollo 13 space mission, Ron Howard directs this amazing film that not only centers around the struggle to bring back to earth three astronauts in a doomed space craft, but it also focuses on the emotional impact that this actual event had on the families of the astronauts and the entire nation.
I:8897;612;The talented actors, Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon portray the three astronauts who are estatic about receiving the opportunity to land and walk on the moon.
I:8897;613;This 2 hour and 20 minute video is a must for anyone's video collection, with fabulous graphics and emotional dialogue.
I:8897;614;I've viewed it several times, and it never gets boring.
I:8897;615;The acting is top notch in this movie Tom Hanks always gives a good performance no matter how bad the movie, Kevin Bacon actually shows in this movie he's a real actor, Bill Paxton is very good too and really is an actor whose been jumping around lots of movies.
I:8897;616;Ron Howard has crafted a classic movie.
I:8897;617;For those too young to remember, it's a must see.
I:8897;618;great acting, exciting, and entertaining.
I:8897;619;This is one of those movies that they really did a good job with.
I:8897;620;This movie really does justice to those men who piloted the Apollo 13 Mission.
I:8897;621;Tom Hanks and crew did a great job tipping their hats to these men.
I:8897;622;An incredible story of how the crew of Apollo 13 and the people in Mission Control overcame adversity to get back home on earth.
I:8897;623;It is well worth watching again and again.
I:8897;624;Conveys the complexity, ambitiousness, and teamwork involved in the US space program and draws an appealing picture of each of the three astronauts on the mission.
I:8897;625;A real lift if you're an American or even if you're just an admirer of human audacity.
I:8897;626;I'm glad I saw it and I'm betting you will be too.
I:8897;627;An excellent portrayal of the true ordeal of the Crew of Apollo 13, this movie shows how engineers and fellow astronauts on the ground worked to save the lives of Astronauts Lovell, Haise and Swigert.
I:8897;628;Plus it had the usual advantages: widescreen and an excellent surround sound soundtrack to make it feel like it did in the movie theatre.
I:8897;629;Everyone enjoyed it and it led to lots of discussion with the kids about the NASA space program.
I:8897;630;Also one of the greatest moments in human history.
I:8897;631;I highly recommend this film.
I:8897;632;Great directing as well as great acting.
I:8897;633;Wonderment, family, technological amazement, love, love of discovery and more.
I:8897;634;i'd always been fascinated with how the heck did we get to the moon and more amazed that we got back in one piece using antique devices.
I:8897;635;moreover, memorable characterizations by Hanks and company.Yup, a 5 star film.
I:8897;636;It's my favorite space movie ever.
I:8897;637;The cast is uniformly terrific.
I:8897;638;The score is fabulous, adding to the tension, and the effects are amazing.
I:8897;639;It also does a great job at pointing out how small and fragile our little planet is.
I:8897;640;"it's one of our ""keepers"" and definitely worth owning and viewing regularly ."
I:8897;641;it will remind you (as it has our family) that is is so very good to be born/raised/live in this country.
I:8897;642;it begins with a voiceover by Walter Cronkite (and yes, our announcer is the real thing!)
I:8897;643;launch) and then in orbit, and it focuses on the united effort in bringing our boys home.
I:8897;644;These men are so smart .
I:8897;645;all of them (not just in space but at Mission Control) and is a realistic view of the times.
I:8897;646;There are moments of smiles, and it's not too intense excluding the JOYOUS moment when we hear them respond after four minutes coming through the atmosphere.
I:8897;647;please use your own judgment.
I:8897;648;That said, you will CARE DEEPLY about all the people you see.]
I:8897;649;"It's a wonderful ""wrap"" to an amazing six days in space."
I:8897;650;"I found the scenes compelling and recall the ""lump in throat"" of those days."
I:8897;651;I liked her a lot!
I:8897;652;the Best Stuff: After the movie we are provided with a mini.
I:8897;653;One of the brave actors in particular didn't want his testosterone questioned but.
I:8897;654;"
I:8897;655;We (the USofA) have some incredible individuals to be proud of.
I:8897;656;this is perhaps one of the best patriotic movies I have ever seen .
I:8897;657;at the very end of the movie you see Jim Lovell .
I:8897;658;The first is made by Director Ron Howard (you know, he's good .
I:8897;659;and tells inside things about the creation of this movie.
I:8897;660;(winks)All in all, this is one of our favorites.
I:8897;661;As someone who has been fascinated with space flight since childhood, and who well remembers the real Apollo 13 from his teenage years, I found this movie a fascinating reminder of history.
I:8897;662;the movie captures the decision not to attempt to fire the service module engine in order to reverse the flight direction in a deep.
I:8897;663;I found the film suprisingly enthralling because I speculated that a film about three guys in a tiny metal capsule was not likely to hold my notoriously short attention.
I:8897;664;Great movie for the whole family!!
I:8897;665;It tickles good fancy, and it's not a bad movie at all.
I:8897;666;It's somewhat rare when a movie based on a factual event is both entertaining and factually accurate .
I:8897;667;Apollo 13 is one of those rare movies.
I:8897;668;For those who are old enough to remember the Apollo 13 flight, it gives details that were not known by the public at the time, but it is a suspenseful and well acted movie for all.
I:8897;669;A detailed and true description of the tragic malfunction of Apollo 13.
I:8897;670;Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Bill Paxton all star and play wonderful roles during this account of Apollo 13.
I:8897;671;It also shows how those on earth deal with the situation and how it engrossed most of the world.
I:8897;672;a true movie that is perfectly detailed and perfectly documented.
I:8897;673;It's easily Ron Howard's finest exercise in cinematic storytelling, sticking fairly closely to the actual story, going through all manner of fussing (including multiple trips on the Vomet Comet) to create an authentic look and feel, and making the most of a top.
I:8897;674;notch cast, underplaying their parts with intensity and focus.
I:8897;675;The audio presentation is equally impressive, and the presence of a standard.
I:8897;676;star reviews, but movies this good aren't usually put into theaters.
I:8897;677;I usually stick to fiction, historical fiction, and sci.
I:8897;678;fi movies,(like Star Wars, Grease, and Princess Bride)and comedy(like anything by Mel Brooks.)
I:8897;679;But this movie has elements from all of those, minus the fiction and most of the comedy.
I:8897;680;It is a serious movie about a serious story from the last century.
I:8897;681;And not only is it very entertaining, but while you're watching it, you keep saying to yourself this really happened.
I:8897;682;The real Jim Lovell(who Tom Hanks played in the movie)saw the movie before it's public debut.
I:8897;683;I think pulling that off alone was an amazing feat worth recognition.
I:8897;684;That is what makes this an incredible adventure of the highest order.
I:8897;685;What brought these men home was a marriage of everyone who knew anything about the Apollo Missions working together in one of the most amazing cooperative units in recorded history.
I:8897;686;Nobody was more thankful for the successful efforts of this impressive group than Jim Lovell and his companions.
I:8897;687;Cinematically this movie is absolutely stunning, with special effects that are incredibly realistic without going overboard.
I:8897;688;million miles from earth, I for one would welcome a return to the moon with open arms.
I:8897;689;Commentary from Jim Lovell himself, comparison of the movie footage with actual footage from the ill.
I:8897;690;This has always been a terrific movie and seeing it in Blu.
I:8897;691;ray (with a combo pack as well) just made it even more spectacular.
I:8897;692;Tom Hanks (Lovell), Bill Paxton (Haise), and Kevin Bacon (Swigert) give riveting performances as the astronauts, and Ed Harris gives an Oscar.
I:8897;693;caliber performance as Gene Kranz.
I:8897;694;Ron Howard does an excellent job with state of the art special effects which bring this apollo mission to life.
I:8897;695;Combining excellent acting, historical correctness, and edge.
I:8897;696;seat excitement, Apollo 13 is worthy of inclusion in any video collection.
I:8897;697;The movie is fine but the box is slightly scratched.
I:8897;698;This is one of my most favorite movies.
I:8897;699;Just love the story and how the engineers came together to solve the problems to bring these men home.
I:8897;700;If you read all of the other reviews, you know how great this movie is.
I:8897;701;It has a wonderful, anamorphic picture, amazing surround sound, TONS OF EXTRAS .
I:8897;702;I am still happy with the movie and glad that I got it.
I:8897;703;He loved Gravity and also loved this movie!
I:8897;704;Ron Howard really did history justice in this rendition of America's journey into space and the lunar expedition.
I:8897;705;Tom Hanks, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, and Bill Paxton were excellent in their portrayals of their characters.
I:8897;706;If you're thinking about seeing this film for the first time, I guarantee it will take you back in time, and literally entrance you.
I:8897;707;The moon destined astronauts and the inevitable near death trajedy that occurs hit too close to home and show us raw emotion as well as a willingness to go against the odds and do what it takes to survive.
I:8897;708;You will see the interplay of a body of individuals working against the clock, here on earth, to assist the astronauts in space: and you will be struck by their teamwork and unity to accomplish the goal of survival.
I:8897;709;It is a story about family, love and honor.
I:8897;710;The support of family, the knowledge of love, and the faith of honor fully present throughout the film.
I:8897;711;Who gives his best performance here.
I:8897;712;The supporting actors help round out this movie into a great story.
I:8897;713;One of the best films of 1995.
I:8897;714;Great acting, directing, editing, special.
I:8897;715;effects, script and a great score by James Horner.
I:8897;716;One of the very best movies made!
I:8897;717;Tom Hanks was fantastic and Ron Howard made one of the best movies ever.
I:8897;718;Both should have won academy awards.
I:8897;719;It was the perfect companion to the trip.
I:8897;720;The cast does a superb job conveying the intensity and danger the astronauts experienced, the committed team work at mission control, and dedication of their families.
I:8897;721;take a chance and try it, i bet it'll hold your attention.
I:8897;722;"As at least one other reviewer has pointed out, one of the most amazing things about ""Apollo 13"" is the way it keeps viewers on the edges of their seats (sorry for the cliche) even though the outcome of the story is familiar to most anyone with an interest in the film."
I:8897;723;This is a testament to the amount of work put into this film by absolutely everyone involved in its production.
I:8897;724;Ron Howard's direction is excellent, the special effects are top notch (convincing without being over the top), and every single cast member handles their duties almost flawlessly.
I:8897;725;The cast is as high profile as you could ask for.
I:8897;726;Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan are all well established stars, but the acting is clearly a team effort.
I:8897;727;the story of Apollo 13 is of course a compelling subject for a film, and it deserves the deft handling it receives from Ron Howard and Co.
I:8897;728;The story of Ken Mattingly, who was cut from the flight, then brought in to assist with the rescue mission, is also compelling, and is told quite well here.
I:8897;729;And of course Opie's, Ron Howard's, direction is impecable.
I:8897;730;It's one of those movie's that is a must see.
I:8897;731;And it's fun to watch again and again.
I:8897;732;bitingly tense and heroic tale of survival.
I:8897;733;odds based on the actual Apollo 13 crisis, Howard's Oscar.
I:8897;734;winning drama rekindles the exhilarating enthusiasm the nation felt during the first flights to the moon.
I:8897;735;and also draws on the collective anxiety that pooled in the wake of the Challenger explosion.
I:8897;736;"Even without this context, ""Apollo 13"" is a grippingly authentic story, crisply helmed by Howard and superbly acted by a first."
I:8897;737;rate cast including Hanks, Bacon, Paxton, Harris, and Gary Sinise.
I:8897;738;Excellent effects, especially during Saturn V launch sequence.
I:8897;739;Commentary by Astronaut James Lovell provides a good historical perspective.
I:8897;740;This is one of those movies that captures you and pulls you into the movie.
I:8897;741;My wifes favorite movie and yes, I like it also.
I:8897;742;A piece of history told Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks.
I:8897;743;This is one of those movies that you will watch over and over.
I:8897;744;I watched it twice that day.
I:8897;745;I am a space history enthusiast and this is a very well researched and re.
I:8897;746;My nine year old loves this movie!
I:8897;747;Apollo 13 (1995) is a great cinematic achievement from director Ron Howard.
I:8897;748;It really captures the essence of what happened with Apollo 13 in April 1970.
I:8897;749;Quinlan was nominated for an Academy Award for her great performance.
I:8897;750;the musical score by James Horner is great.
I:8897;751;The movie also contains popular songs from the time period.
I:8897;752;One day the U. s. will take the next step when it comes to Mars.
I:8897;753;overall, Apollo 13 is an entertaining movie that I highly recommend.
I:8897;754;In my opinion, it was the best movie of 1995.
I:8897;755;Tom Hanks just makes the rest of the cast better and they work so great together.
I:8897;756;This is one of my favorite films.
I:8897;757;It's a good transfer with excellent sound.
I:8897;758;I really wanted to see that extra stuff!
I:8897;759;According to the other reviews posted here, the extra material was excellent on the other version of this disk.
I:8897;760;I will have to keep it, like it or not.
I:8897;761;Great acting and special effects throughout the movie!
I:8897;762;"especially with the ""anniversary"" edition."
I:8897;763;the triumph of the human spirit in the face of extraordinary odds.
I:8897;764;This has been one of my favorite movies since the first time I saw it in the theater.
I:8897;765;High drama, great character moments, and an exploration of the human spirit, all brought together masterfully on the screen with innovative filmmaking techniques, great special effects, and a brilliant score by composer James Horner.
I:8897;766;ron Howard captures the spirit and reality of the Apollo era in an amazingly accurate and entertaining film.
I:8897;767;There are certain sacrifices in accuracy for dramatic value, but overall, the message and story are delivered intact.
I:8897;768;The work and attention to detail put into this film is phenomenal.
I:8897;769;First is a very interesting an informative documentary on the making of the film.
I:8897;770;There's not one, but two commentary tracks included (one with director Ron Howard, and one will real.
I:8897;771;life hero Jim Lovell and wife Marilyn).
I:8897;772;Both of these commentaries are informative and interesting.
I:8897;773;Great movie of a historical event.
I:8897;774;I can't even begin to explain how beautiful the launch sequence is.
I:8897;775;My player has NO internet connection to it.
I:8897;776;This is an amazing movie made only better by blu.
I:8897;777;ray version is very good!!
I:8897;778;Always a good movie to have in the collection and while you might watch the movie in other settings, on a sufficiently large home screen BR is the way to go.
I:8897;779;we watch this on our new LED tv and it's totally clear, makes you feel like you are part of the action.
I:8897;780;For people who aren't entirely familiar or were just somewhat familiar on the events, but were maybe lacking some of the details, these documentaries that aired on the Discovery Channel were most informative.
I:8897;781;"Apollo 13 chronicles the fateful mission that has been dubbed the ""successful failure"" by NASA, which had all of America holding its collective breath as it wondered if the mission would end in disaster or would it become one of our finest hours."
I:8897;782;based members of NASA's Mission Control are racing against time and almost impossible odds to return these three men safely to Earth.
I:8897;783;"art (as of 1995) special effects and film tricks and techniques to simulate weightlessness, along with an incredibly emotional and compelling story written by William Broyles, Jr. (""Flags of Our Fathers"") and Al Reinert, based on the book written by Astronaut Jim Lovell and co. writer Jeffrey Kluger
I:8897;784;"the cast of ""Apollo 13"" was an assortment of top."
I:8897;785;Each member of the cast portrayed these real life Astronauts, their wives, or the people in Mission Control perfectly, easily handling each emotional high and low throughout this inspiring story of survival.
I:8897;786;written screenplay, expert direction, and extremely talented cast brought to life not only this harrowing journey in space, but also gave audiences a glimpse into what NASA life is like for the Astronauts and the loved ones left behind on Earth awaiting their safe return.
I:8897;787;"Thanks to the painstaking length to which Ron Howard and company went to in order to make this a movie that is so incredibly realistic on every level, ""Apollo 13"" serves as a fitting tribute to the brave men and women that endured the situation by overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds, and also to the ingenuity and will power of man to set their sights on a goal and to never give up until it was achieved."
I:8897;788;Apollo 13 is rated PG for language and peril.
I:8897;789;Excellent research, set design, the illusion of weightlessness.
I:8897;790;I also like his few words and special features and the front and back of the movie itself.
I:8897;791;It was a huge part of my childhood.
I:8897;792;And I had my Dad (but not for long enough) as a great technical consultant.
I:8897;793;this is a fascinating, fun and very true to life movie about a key event in a unique time in world history.
I:8897;794;Along with another favorite of mine, The Right Stuff, it gives a great perspective on the US manned space flight program.
I:8897;795;ray release load time, but the movie looks good and the extras are good, so no points away from a truly fine and inspirational movie.
I:8897;796;This is one of my favorite films, and it is safe to show to my classes .
I:8897;797;To see the part of history that you were aware of makes it even more enjoyable.
I:8897;798;We can overcome these and it was great acting etc.
I:8897;799;I want everyone to see this film and know the truth.
I:8897;800;Tom Hanks played very good.
I:8897;801;I'd like to recommend everyone this great movie.
I:8897;802;This film was like nothing I have ever seen on the big screen before!I wish to draw attention to the fact for those who do not know that Apollo Command module footage was taken under actual zero gravity conditions aboard an aircraft flying parabolic arcs, and if I am not getting my films mixed up, the space suits were actually ventilated and extremely realistic.
I:8897;803;Ron Howard really goes to great lengths to do really fine work!
I:8897;804;This movie is so much more inhanced in the IMAX experience.
I:8897;805;I just attended a viewing of the movie at my local IMAX in Hutchinson, KS and was totally impressed and overwhelmed with the emotion of the film on an IMAX.
I:8897;806;This is one of those movies.
I:8897;807;stop entertainment spectacle and everyone in the family can watch it.
I:8897;808;Even if director Ron Howard directs nothing but dogs for the rest of his career, he made himself a place in history with this film.
I:8897;809;(He has also clearly made the jump from one side of the camera [The Music Man, Happy Days, Andy Griffith, .]
I:8897;810;The cinematography is superb, the acting outstanding, and the story incredibly intense and moving.
I:8897;811;If you believe in the space programme, this can be a real uplifting tear.
I:8897;812;"jerker
I:8897;813;Brilliant film to watch from start to finish.
I:8897;814;best film of the year when it was released back in 1995.
I:8897;815;probably the best of director Ron Howard's movies, it is well acted by stars Tom Hanks (as Jim Lovell), Kevin Bacon (Jack Swigert), and Bill Paxton (Fred Haise) as the three space.
I:8897;816;The movie was nominated for 9 Oscars including best picture, writing, supporting actor (Harris), supporting actress (Quinlan), music, and visual effects, and won for editing and for sound.
I:8897;817;there are a lot of special effects thoughout the movie, including the entirely.
I:8897;818;an exciting 220 minute movie about one of the most.
I:8897;819;screen movie has 56 (!)
I:8897;820;Highly recommend for fans of any of the actors listed above, the space program, or adventures in general.
I:8897;821;With all due respect, sir, I believe this will be our finest hour .
I:8897;822;Great movie even for a science class.
I:8897;823;The language is a little rough for the younger generations, but the movie is very accurate and educational.
I:8897;824;excellent movie, watched if when it first came out, I could never tire of it.
I:8897;825;A great part of history
I:8897;826;aPOLLO 13 is a great film.
I:8897;827;director Ron Howard captures the tension of the event perfectly, and also recaptures the ambience of NASA in 1970, a mixture of energy, technical competence, and frustration, when it seemed the American public had just about forgotten it's once lionized space program in the wake of moon missions so successful they seemed absolutely boring.
I:8897;828;Ron Howard captures their understated emotion, as well as their phenomenal resilience and test.
I:8897;829;bill Paxton plays an increasingly ill Fred Haise with such conviction that the viewer shudders with compassionate sympathy as Fred's flu and fever make him both less able to contribute and less willing to give in to his sudden illness.
I:8897;830;life performances, both of which capture the hopes and fears not only of Mrs. Lovell and Flight Controller Krantz, but of the rest of the hundreds of people involved in the rescue effort on the ground.
I:8897;831;"tech state of the Apollo
I:8897;832;This movie is also a very watchable, almost completely accurate history.
I:8897;833;I recommend Jim Lovell's excellent book LOST MOON (or APOLLO 13), to sort out the occasional changes.
I:8897;834;As spectacular an accomplishment as a moon landing is, it pales besides the importance of the human drama.
I:8897;835;APOLLO 13 is a great testament to the human spirit.
I:8897;836;"And to think that they went to the moon using ""computers"" that had less memory than an average calculator has today!"
I:8897;837;Keeps you on the edge of your seat!
I:8897;838;Others have commented about the excellence of Apollo 13, one of the the best space movies ever made.
I:8897;839;The extended launch buildup is accompanied by incredibly dramatic music and sound effects, leading to one of the most amazing moments in aviation history.
I:8897;840;clear NASA launch footage, the raw power, the personal reactions, the ice flakes shedding off the rocket, the SOUND, and the stirring music make the launch sequence a true goose.
I:8897;841;This is film craftsmanship at its finest.
I:8897;842;Having just received a Blu.
I:8897;843;The film is so uplifting, showing how everything worked out when people stopped panicking and worked the problem.
I:8897;844;"THE MOVIE: Ron Howard's ""Apollo 13"" is superb."
I:8897;845;It is also majestic, romantic, thrilling, adventurous, frightening, funny, dramatic, heartbreaking, heartwarming, heroic, and just plain wonderful.
I:8897;846;every single actor in the film delivers a phenomenal performance (although Chris Ellis as Deke Slayton isn't given much to work with by the script), and Howard's direction is the best it could possibly be.
I:8897;847;"some may prefer ""The Right Stuff"" to ""Apollo 13"" as a movie because it's more imaginative, but ""Apollo 13"" is one of the most accurate and faithful docudramas ever made about space exploration."
I:8897;848;Because the movie is so faithful to the historical record, Lovell is able to describe his own inner thoughts and feelings over big closeups of Tom Hanks (e. g., when he's watching Neil Armstrong step onto the moon).
I:8897;849;This version is mainly interesting as a demonstration of how an Academy Award.
I:8897;850;winning director goes about trimming one of his masterpieces.
I:8897;851;This movie captures the real life drama of ordinary people put in extraordinary circumstances.
I:8897;852;It is truly NASA's finest hour!
I:8897;853;The special effects absolutely real life, and the DTS sound pushes you back on your sofa as Apollo 13 lifts off!
I:8897;854;It's loaded with extra features and worth upgrading for if you're into that.
I:8897;855;When one of the adminsitrators declares that this could be the worst disaster NASA has ever faced, Kranz insists, With all due respect, sir, I believe this is gonna be our finest hour.
I:8897;856;Indeed, watching NASA literally true to figure out how to get a square peg into a round hole is the most captivating part.
I:8897;857;But as much as the film and the story about technology, both really come down to the human beings.
I:8897;858;Love this movie and was glad to find a reasonably.
I:8897;859;Anyway, I got one in widescreen of the Anniversary Edition for myself and then a 2nd one for a friend.
I:8897;860;A great portrayl of events that happened and how man was able to solve problems never before envountered.
I:8897;861;This film is probably the most technically accurate spaceflight film out there.
I:8897;862;The Saturn V liftoff was incredible.
I:8897;863;This film is still as exciting to watch today as it was back when it came out.
I:8897;864;This 1995 film, directed by Ron Howard, is the true story of the 1970 moon mission that went wrong.
I:8897;865;But due to the dedicated men in the Mission Control Center in Houston, the astronauts made it back to earth alive.
I:8897;866;naturally, I knew the outcome of this story.
I:8897;867;I remember watching it on television way back in 1970.
I:8897;868;From the very first moment, the tension mounts and I was completely swept up in the film, so involved that I didn't move away from my VCR for a moment.
I:8897;869;I understand that it was all recreated and the details completely authentic.
I:8897;870;experienced the way life was in 1970 and the impact that the space program had on our imaginations.
I:8897;871;I cheered at the resourcefulness of the men on the ground whose job it was to bring the astronauts down alive.
I:8897;872;It was a miracle that they survived and lived to tell about it.
I:8897;873;It's a great story, well told, and worthy of all the awards it won.
I:8897;874;It is my father's favorite movie, thus his favorite Christmas gift.
I:8897;875;It is a great movie, and does make a nice gift for that generation who lived during the event.
I:8897;876;well, I'm afraid that Apollo 13 is the same way.
I:8897;877;Sure, everyone knows that the Apollo 13 crew gets home safely.
I:8897;878;So it's a testament to how good this movie is that it still enthralls the viewer despite already knowing how the story ends.
I:8897;879;All the elements of a great story and movie are there .
I:8897;880;acting, directing, script, drama, suspense, some humor.
I:8897;881;Very entertaining, love true stories.
I:8897;882;You're on the edge of your seat.
I:8897;883;Great actors, good story line!
I:8897;884;and this one is SOOO much better.
I:8897;885;Crystal clear picture with remarkable detail.
I:8897;886;The space sequences are breathtaking in beauty.
I:8897;887;The launch sequence is a great demo.
I:8897;888;Well worth the bargain price now that the format war is over.
I:8897;889;But this is a very good movie.
I:8897;890;"The film is probably best remembered for it's tagline, ""Yo, Houston!"
I:8897;891;The film is probably best remembered for it's tagline, Yo, Houston!
I:8897;892;Fantastic movie of a true event.
I:8897;893;Tom Hanks is at his best.
I:8897;894;A must see for anyone interested in the space program.
I:8897;895;There is something exquisite about this movie.
I:8897;896;A gentle, understated movie that deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture but didn't get it.
I:8897;897;It is near perfect and everyone does their part.
I:8897;898;No grandstanding, no over the top performances but wonderful ensemble acting.
I:8897;899;They did a wonderful job of it and this film will live on as a classic for a long time.
I:8897;900;What a fantastic story to be told and what a great cast to bring it to life.
I:8897;901;Conquering Space: Moon and Beyond (48:25).
I:8897;902;fated Apollo 13, one of the most dramatic events in space exploration history began to unfold.
I:8897;903;apollo 13 tells the story of this amazing rescue.
I:8897;904;It shows with great realism and detail exactly what happened and what steps the astronauts had to take to ensure their safe return.
I:8897;905;i watched this movie just recently after seeing it for the first time in 1995, and it holds up very well.
I:8897;906;But he followed it up with another great performance here.
I:8897;907;The rest of the cast is great as well, especially Ed Harris as the flight director, Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, Tom Paxton as Fred Haise, Kevin Bacon as Jack Swigert, and Kathleen Quinlan as Marilyn Lovell.
I:8897;908;Astronauts Lovell, Haise and Mattingly were scheduled to fly Apollo 14, but are moved up to 13.
I:8897;909;It also contains the IMAX version that is crisp and great if you have a home theater.
I:8897;910;And almost everything you see in the movie actually happened with a couple of composite characters to help the flow of the movie.
I:8897;911;You can tell that every single person involved in this project had respect for the material and staying true to the story.
I:8897;912;I think so!Masterful interpretation by Tom Hanks and the other protagonists, and great direction.
I:8897;913;The movie marries human pathos for the human drama with an accurate documentation of the real events and its tecnological nuances.
I:8897;914;Excellent special effects considering the technolgy available in 1995.
I:8897;915;the viewer is led to live through the adventure of a lunar trip, an exceptional event even though at the time (this was the third planned manned landing) it had come to be considered routine.
I:8897;916;until the accident, that is!A passionate movie on an episode that today is famous only because the three men almost met tragedy.
I:8897;917;excellent extras on the history of the Apollo program and interesting interviews with the real astronauts among others.
I:8897;918;i love all the movies i order thru amazon, the prices are great.
I:8897;919;This movie will always be very important to me.
I:8897;920;This is a great flick to fall back on when you don't feel like a 3 hour epic drama like Braveheart or Lord of the Rings, but still want something with a solid story, but without making you think too much.
I:8897;921;The menus are clear and work well, allowing easy navigation of features.
I:8897;922;the commentaries on the Theatrical Release are an asset, particularly the one by Jim and Marilyn Lovell.
I:8897;923;although I won't deliver any spoilers, one of the most impressive aspects of the film is that there is genuine suspense regarding the ending, even though I .
I:8897;924;This is testimony to the writing and to Ron Howard's direction.
I:8897;925;"this is also reflected in the documentary ""Lost Moon: The Triumph of Apollo 13"" where the crew and cast members come across as being absolutely commited to portraying events accurately, but in a way that underscored the innate drama of them."
I:8897;926;provoking and make the viewer re.
I:8897;927;"to Quote Jim Lovell: ""Gentlemen, it has been a priveledge to fly with you."
I:8897;928;Highly recommended to anyone with even a passing interest in the space program.
I:8897;929;And then, one day, fate taught us all the perils of space exploration.
I:8897;930;truly the best film of the 1990s.
I:8897;931;Story is funny, interesting, adventurous and heartwarming.
I:8897;932;I guarantee you will like it.
I:8897;933;First, it came in excellent packaging.
I:8897;934;It came in time and in beautiful condition.
I:8897;935;Great movie, Tom Hanks and all actors were excellent!
I:8897;936;It was great seeing it again.
I:8897;937;I saw it first came out years ago, but is well worth watching again
I:8897;938;Ron Howard and Tom Hanks did themselves proud making this fabulous real life, edge of your seat movie about a situation that could have ended tragically . . . and gave us that immortal saying Houston, we have a problem !
I:8897;939;Thank you for the excellent promptness of the delivery.
I:8897;940;The IMAX version is, well :), a shorter version of the film (1h55' versus the 2h20' of the regular) in an aspect ratio of 1:66.
I:8897;941;I've seen this movie 21 times and I love it!
I:8897;942;This movie (a true story) is about an Apollo Space Crew that gets wrecked in space.
I:8897;943;The Movie tells the whole stroy.
I:8897;944;I will tell you this: SEE THIS MOVIE!
I:8897;945;I hope you enjoy it.
I:8897;946;The true story of Apollo 13.
I:8897;947;I've probably seen it at least 5 times now and I'm still glued to my seat.
I:8897;948;Honestly it's so miraculous and incredible the things that happened and the things that were done to get these guys home that it seems fake.
I:8897;949;ron Howard's direction of the movie was incredible.
I:8897;950;It seemed like everyone wanted to do their best to make this movie memorable for us as the viewer, and more importantly for the people who they portrayed and the story that was being told.
I:8897;951;I HIGHLY recommend watching this.
I:8897;952;There was a LOT of real footage used in this documentary.
I:8897;953;Also it's really neat to see how spot on the movie was to the actual event that happened.
I:8897;954;"It was really cool to hear ""Houston we have a problem"" from Lovell himself."
I:8897;955;And while they do show a lot of actual events, they also show some really funny stuff too.
I:8897;956;Watching how they did the floating in space parts was really cool.
I:8897;957;A lot of the shots are actually in an airplane doing this and the actors all did it.
I:8897;958;It was funny to watch them floating around and then hit the bottom of the plane when the plane would come up from the dive.
I:8897;959;in the end, I highly recommend this movie for anyone.
I:8897;960;Incredible movie on an incredible true event in America's history.
I:8897;961;it is not only brilliantly done, historically interesting and superbly acted, it's an excellent study in management and problem solving in a crisis situation.
I:8897;962;The extras are indeed worth having, but since I know the movie so well, the missing scenes detract from viewing it for pleasure.
I:8897;963;But due to the cut/edit scenes, I can only give it three stars.
I:8897;964;Director Ron Opie Howard gets behind the camera and directs his best film ever.
I:8897;965;James Horner's music soars like a rocket throughout the movie.
I:8897;966;(The Eurythmics) A great movie to watch.
I:8897;967;the suspense, the action, the fear palpable throughout the entire movie just makes the whole thing real for a new generation of people who weren't there when it happened.
I:8897;968;I wanted to watch it because it is quoted a lot and I hadn't seen it.
I:8897;969;It's a pretty good movie.
I:8897;970;Its a classic, it deals with the real.
I:8897;971;Usually, engineers and builders do their best to ensure that the technology to be used is safe.
I:8897;972;These fears, anxieties and hopes were beautifully captured by director Ron Howard in his 1995, Oscar.
I:8897;973;"nominated film aptly named ""Apollo 13""."
I:8897;974;This was truly one of NASA's finest moments in being able to assist the otherwise helpless crew be able to return to Earth, including Ken Mattingly working hard on the ground to help ensure that the Apollo 13 crew would be able to turn on what they need with the little power that they had available.
I:8897;975;"For its overall realism, wonderful cinematography, engaging story and wonderful acting, I rate ""Apollo 13"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars."
I:8897;976;The film won two Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound, but was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Visual Effects, Best Art and Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.
I:8897;977;Additionally, Ed Harris received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, as did Kathleen Quinlan for Best Supporting Actress.
I:8897;978;I would give it ten stars if I could!
I:8897;979;boosting APOLLO 13 is a very well done and convincing movie.
I:8897;980;A prime example of the desensitized, ratings.
I:8897;981;the performances are excellent throughout: Tom Hanks gives his usual stalwart performance as Jim Lovell.
I:8897;982;"the thing about Hanks is he makes his characters believable and displays a wide range of emotions, sometimes with just the look on his face: Bill Paxton calms down a bit to play Haise, the more ""cowboy"" astronaut
I:8897;983;Ed Harris is brilliant as the flight director, a man who keeps his cool and faith in the catastrophic conditions.
I:8897;984;an intelligent script, special effects and Howard's assured direction combine to give us a heart pounding realistic view of the endangered space program.
I:8897;985;Ron Howard's attitude was that one day. . . the world will look back and reflect on this event. . . by way of the movie.
I:8897;986;He wanted it to be the most accurate account they could make it.
I:8897;987;While the mission was a failure. . . the rescue of our astronauts from a desperate situation was one of America's finest hours in history.
I:8897;988;NASA and the flight crew of Apollo 13 were able to make a death defying rescue and make us all proud to be an American.
I:8897;989;One of the most realistic movies ever produced and it was based upon the actual happenings of the ill.
I:8897;990;The story of Apollo 13 is among the greatest triumphs of NASAs then short history.
I:8897;991;This movie gives an accurate description of those events.
I:8897;992;Brings you back to a time when America had a goal in mind and simply went after it.
I:8897;993;Having lived through the actual news report, it is still amazing that this insident did not kill the Moon Program.
I:8897;994;It has great special effects.
I:8897;995;(Like when the Saturn V rocket launches off) It has great acting from every angle: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kevin Bacon.
I:8897;996;I especially think Ed Harris acting here is grand.
I:8897;997;Tom Hanks is good here, but his acting is better in Forrest Gump, Philadelphia and Saving Private Ryan.
I:8897;998;This is still good work.
I:8897;999;The writing is superb and the directing is very well.
I:8897;1000;That's how good this movie is at times.
I:8897;1001;A good movie that almost stands as a great movie.
I:8897;1002;Along with audio commentary is a documentary and a full version of the orginal soundtrack.
I:8897;1003;It's Amazing what they did in the late 60's w/so little technology!
I:8897;1004;It was a suspenseful nail biter for sure!
I:8897;1005;plagued Apollo 13 mission is an excellent movie, not only as an adventure thriller but as entertaining historical drama.
I:8897;1006;If like me, you think that mankind's destiny lay in the continuance of space exploration and exploitation, go ahead and watch and recommend this to friends and family who might be swayed by the thought of adventure, high drama, and the accomplishments that are possible with dedication to a common goal.
I:8897;1007;taking into consideration the absolutely staggering number of obstacles they were facing, the fact that these three men made it back to Earth alive is more than just a miracle.
I:8897;1008;"It's an inspiring story of people working together to solve epic problems with dire deadlines, unselfishly, because the alternative, in the words of flight director Gene Krantz, ""is not an option."
I:8897;1009;worthy job of portraying it.

I:8897;1014;stories, fascinated by space travel, or a believer in what humans have the ability to do if they work together, then you will love Apollo 13.
I:8897;1015;I decided to watch it again on Amazon Instant Video and was pleased that it was still an enjoyable movie to watch after all of these years.
I:8897;1016;the launch scene is simply majestic, and the fact that the space scenes really were filmed in zero gravity (30 seconds at a time, in a NASA C.135) just blows me away.
I:8897;1017;finally, I was very impressed with the acting.
I:8897;1018;all in all, a fantastic movie.
I:8897;1019;Really enjoyed watching this again.
I:8897;1020;The movie is a lot of fun.
I:8897;1021;GREAT movie shows what one can do if the your life is on the line.
I:8897;1022;Shows team work, support, guts to make it happen.
I:8897;1023;In 1995, Imagine Entertainment released Apollo 13 , a wonderful motion picture directed by Ron Howard.
I:8897;1024;This film masterfully dramatizes those harrowing seven days in April 1970, when the world watched and waited to see if the Apollo 13 astronauts would return to earth safely, or be lost forever in the vast ocean of space.
I:8897;1025;Apollo 13 is an outstanding film in every way.
I:8897;1026;The acting is uniformly superb!
I:8897;1027;His performance is stunning in its realism and accuracy.
I:8897;1028;Tom Hanks brings an wonderfully easy.
I:8897;1029;Bill Paxman is excellent as the quietly intense Fred Haise, and Kevin Bacon shines as the somewhat impetuous but extremely competent ladies' man Jack Swigert.

I:8897;1031;dramatic, and came close to stretching reality to its breaking point.
I:8897;1032;are wonderfully sensitive and poignant reminders of the emotional toll being wrought on the astronauts, their families and friends, and the men at Mission Control who struggled so mightily to ensure a successful resolution to this crisis.
I:8897;1033;Apollo 13 is an important movie which accurately depicts one of the most harrowing events of the 1970s.
I:8897;1034;This superb film brings that event .
I:8897;1035;once again to the forefront, and restores the players in this real.
I:8897;1036;life drama to the pantheon of American heroes.
I:8897;1037;Apollo 13 is, quite simply, one of the most exciting and moving Hollywood films of the entire decade of the 1990s.

I:8897;1097;Tom Hanks plays a very believable astronaut.
I:8897;1098;The showing of how the families were handling the crisis event in soace was very believable.
I:8897;1099;All actors selected to play real life characters were picked well.
I:8897;1100;I love the historical facts in the movie.
I:8897;1101;It helped us to understand more about the fact that space is dangerous, and that miracles happen.
I:8897;1102;drama vividly portrays how NASA's greatest catastrophe became a very heroic event when three astronauts, Jim Lovell (who wrote the book on which this film is based, played by Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Bill Paxton),embark on a voyage to the moon.

I:8897;1104;Howard has proved himself, in my opinion, to be one of the best directors ever, right up there with Ridley Scott and James Cameron.
I:8897;1105;The casting is perfect, and each and every person portrayed is convincing in their roles.
I:8897;1106;It is a human interest film.
I:8897;1107;It is a movie almost anyone can enjoy.
I:8897;1108;I love this movie and wish more movies were made like they used to be.
I:8897;1109;The blu ray version has benefited from a nice visual upgrade.
I:8897;1110;Apollo 13 is in one word: stunning.
I:8897;1111;It was fascinating watching the astronauts work together to solve their problems with the team at Houston down below.
I:8897;1112;Apollo 13 is one of the world's most important movies, along side with Saving Private Ryan.
I:8897;1113;a very well told story of how the people of our space program pulled together and got the crew home.
I:8897;1114;This is one of my favorite films.
I:8897;1115;It is the only one I've seen that captures the romance of the Apollo program, or brings back some of the awe that I felt in 1969 when I heard those words, Tranquillity Base here .
I:8897;1116;The commentary by Jim Lovell makes it a historical document.
I:8897;1117;This is an excellent movie.
I:8897;1118;The special effects are excellent.
I:8897;1119;In addition, this movie is even more exciting, as the tagline, says, because it's all true.
I:8897;1120;It's one of those movies that's so true to fact that you have to look at insignificant details like the color of Lovell's car before you can find inconsistencies between the movie and fact.
I:8897;1121;It was very well done.
I:8897;1122;I'd recommend it to all who are into our history.
I:8897;1123;The movie is a masterpiece.
I:8897;1124;The player has the latest firmware and a broadband connection.
I:8897;1125;The movie takes a full four minutes to load.

I:8897;1130;Both acting and direction are great.
I:8897;1131;My favorite Ron Howard movie.
I:8897;1132;This is a very gripping film from beginning to end.
I:8897;1133;It is also very dramitic and, being a true story, that helps.
I:8897;1134;This movie has an all star cast also, and I must say that each cast actor gives a wonderful performance.
I:8897;1135;this is Universal's first Collectors Edition Disc and it truly is filled with a lot of stuff.

I:8897;1155;Back in the late 60's early 70's, Russia and the US were in a heated battle to see, well, pretty much who was better.
I:8897;1156;I recommed this movie if you are able to forget all the facts and just enjoy a well told story.
I:8897;1157;Good movie of a great human adventure,well acted and professionally filmed.
I:8897;1158;"imaginative in the developpement of the ""story"" but overall a very fine visualisation of this tragic."
I:8897;1159;heroic piece of American history.
I:8897;1160;Ron Howard should be commended for directing the true story on one of the most anxious moments in the world.
I:8897;1161;I enjoyed the work of Tom Hanks in this movie.
I:8897;1162;To me it was one of his best next to Forest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and Cast Away.
I:8897;1163;The story of Apollo 13, for any who have followed the space program and especially for those who witnessed it, is as gripping a story as has ever been told throughout American history.
I:8897;1164;It is fraught with drama, intrigue, plot twists, and thrilling danger.
I:8897;1165;What's more, it all really happened!
I:8897;1166;The heroic efforts put forth by the members of Mission Control, as well as the astronauts themselves, the bring Apollo 13 safely back to Earth is one of the greatest stories ever told.
I:8897;1167;acclaimed director, Ron Howard, saw this and, inspired by Lovell's own personal account of that mission crafted one of the truly great historical films to ever hit the screen.
I:8897;1168;Apollo 13 is a true cinematic achievement.
I:8897;1169;ignites the imagination and wonder that the space program held in the 1960's and early 1970's.
I:8897;1170;edge special effects in service of the story (as opposed to in place of it), Howard is able to give audiences a true up close view of the entire Apollo mission.
I:8897;1171;Using archive footage to craft the special effects scenes, the director is able to make launch seem lifelike, as if the viewer is standing atop the tower watching the rocket about to lift off.
I:8897;1172;The scenes in space are well crafted and extraordinarily realistic.
I:8897;1173;The true mark of this film's greatness is found in the fact that, even though we know from history that the men of Apollo 13 survived, the final moments during re.
I:8897;1174;entry, as played out in the movie, are still incredibly gripping and tense.
I:8897;1175;hearted viewer will get choked with emotion.
I:8897;1176;Tom Hanks is solid as the unflappable Jim Lovell, Bill Paxton (who seems to always find a way into every blockbuster) is good as the trusted, but untested rookie Fred Haise, and Kevin Bacon gives an accurate portrayal of last minute replacement Jack Swigert.
I:8897;1177;The other truly standout performance is turned in by Ed Harris, who plays the no.
I:8897;1178;Harris truly deserved his Oscar nomination for this performance and there is certainly a strong argument to be made for him to have won the award over eventually Supporting Actor winner, Kevin Spacey.
I:8897;1179;"Apollo 13, itself, was a strong contender for Best Picture honors, only losing out to the worthy ""Braveheart""."
I:8897;1180;"Apollo 13 is not only a great thriller
I:8897;1181;It enables us to remember those wondrous days of the quest to reach the Moon, as well as the drama of that imperiled flight.
I:8897;1182;Apollo 13 proves, beyond a doubt, that we still have the men with the will, knowledge, and courage to take this space exploration to places beyond imagination.
I:8897;1183;But I also must say that an image this incredible is worth anything.
I:8897;1184;outstanding movie a must have movie in your collection,no fiction just fact
I:8897;1185;But the actually story is more amazing than most science fiction.
I:8897;1186;This is a great movie!
I:8897;1187;A fairly accurate retelling of a very important moment in United States space history.
I:8897;1188;It really pulls you in and makes you feel like you lived through it.
I:8897;1189;After his mega success with Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks scored another winner as Jim Lovell, commander of the ill.
I:8897;1190;He portrays Capt. Lovell with understated grace and charm and we really feel for him when he comes to the realization that he will never get his chance to walk on the moon.
I:8897;1191;In addition to Mr. Hanks the film boasts excellent performances by Kathleen Quinlan as Lovell's wife, Bill Paxson as Fred Haise and Kevin Bacon as Jack Swigert the other Apollo 13 crew members, Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly an original crew member left out due to possible illness and Ed Harris as Eugene Krantz the head of the mission in Houston.
I:8897;1192;Ms. Quinlan adds the right amount of fear and worry to her character without becoming shrill and Mr. Sinise overcomes his initial bitterness to becoming an integral part of the crew's survival.
I:8897;1193;Above all, Mr. Harris gives the performance of his career.
I:8897;1194;He is commanding and powerful as he vows that the ship will not be lost on his watch.
I:8897;1195;He supplies the film with enough tension and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:8897;1196;The filming of the space launch and scenes in space are amazing.
I:8897;1197;In fact Mr. Howard won the prestigious Director's Guild Award making the Oscar snub even more glaring.
I:8897;1198;This movie is stunning dude!
I:8897;1199;The scenes are almost real, and the one liners are just awesome.
I:8897;1200;He has done his role so well, that NASA could think of employing him as a real flight director for their Mars Missions.
I:8897;1201;Gary Sinise is just as good.
I:8897;1202;I liked the fact that the director has given a great deal of importance to detail.
I:8897;1203;And instead of relying to much on special effects, Ron Howard has captured the weightlessness scenes by taking the shots inside a free falling airplane (with the sets inside it), courtesy NASA.
I:8897;1204;In summary, it's a very intelligent movie.
I:8897;1205;Almost all scenes keep you atthe edge of your seats.
I:8897;1206;Ron Howard has spent a great deal of time in capturing a lunar mission in superb detail.
I:8897;1207;If you are a space geek like me, it is highly recommended for you.
I:8897;1208;And this one is a Blu.
I:8897;1209;Needed this for a business meeting and it arrived in perfect condition and just in time for my meeting.
I:8897;1210;This is a very good version of Apollo 13.
I:8897;1211;The special features are great and very informative, they really add to the impact of the movie.
I:8897;1212;I would highly recommend this to anyone.
I:8897;1213;there's also a full audio commentary by director Ron Howard, who is a real stickler for detail (as is Tom Hanks), and who did a great job of making all the technical stuff clear while, at the same time, keeping us on the edge of our seats.
I:8897;1214;And if that's not enough extras for you, there's a fascinating hour.
I:8897;1215;"long ""making of"" documentary that intersperses real NASA footage and interviews with the movie to show how very accurate the scenes and sets were ."
I:8897;1216;"A second documentary, ""Conquering Space,"" gives a nice overview of the space program, and yet a third, ""Lucky 13: the Astronauts story"" gives even more background."
I:8897;1217;I'm old enough to remember the actual events, and this film brings it all back perfectly.
I:8897;1218;I found this series to be very comprehensive of what we see in the actual space industry.
I:8897;1219;"It's very educational and pretty neat information for a space nerd 
I:8897;1220;time favorite movies, and for about a million reasons.
I:8897;1221;But I'll just share a few.
I:8897;1222;first and foremost, we actually care about these characters.
I:8897;1223;Director Ron Howard and the screenwriters dedicate equal time to the people and historical events on Earth as the intense drama that occurs in space.
I:8897;1224;Don't get me wrong, those are great movies, but again, Earth and space are equally important as the other in this story.
I:8897;1225;what history buffs will most appreciate is the political and historical attention to detail.
I:8897;1226;These guys like to drink and embrace their women as much as they venture into the unknown.
I:8897;1227;The Houston Mission Control director Gene Kranz (a superb Ed Harris) is introduced in a very unusual way .
I:8897;1228;The true star of APOLLO 13 isn't even the special effects, which indeed are still impressive.
I:8897;1229;APOLLO 13 does a perfect job in helping us understand what's going on at every second of the crisis.
I:8897;1230;In addition to a fabulous wealth of extras that everyone should check out, this 2.
I:8897;1231;aPOLLO 13 is perfect in every way.
I:8897;1232;acted, and an important chapter in American history.
I:8897;1233;But if a film can take a subject I despise and win me over, then I owe it to the filmmakers to share it with every person I possibly can.
I:8897;1234;Decades from now, APOLLO 13 is going to hold up incredibly well with future audiences.
I:8897;1235;There are so many movies coming out that it's hard for new film buffs to know which ones to pick.
I:8897;1236;Enough character building to make it interesting, but the beat.
I:8897;1237;clock action is what is gripping.
I:8897;1238;The performances are excellent and realistic (being a geek that has worked with this type equipment and scenarios).
I:8897;1239;Suitable for all audiences, it is a pleasure to view.
I:8897;1240;They are about human determination, intelligence, cooperation and the fight for life in time of a very big crisis and challenge which in case of APOLLO 13 created a miracle.
I:8897;1241;The movie has historical value as well because it dramatizes excellently the APOLLO 13 adventure which certainly is a very important event in the history of manned space flights.
I:8897;1242;"For the over 40 year old viewer, ""Apollo 13"" recaptures the feeling of America at that time when we were still the ""can do"" people."
I:8897;1243;Which makes this film all the more appealing.
I:8897;1244;the entire cast is excellent.
I:8897;1245;The music score beautifully compliments the action.
I:8897;1246;Although beyond the launch there isn't a great deal of physical action, this film is as suspenseful and dramatic as any Alfred Hitchcock film.
I:8897;1247;the effects, particularly the launch, are impressive and realistic and give the feeling they're using real film footage, ie.
I:8897;1248;You also feel like you're there.
I:8897;1249;"Even if you are not a big space buff, which I'm not although I did like ""The Right Stuff"" very much, ""Apollo 13"" is quite entertaining and exciting once it quite literally gets off the ground."
I:8897;1250;It proves to be quite significant.
I:8897;1251;despite all the drama, there is some witty dialogue from time to time to relieve some of the tension.
I:8897;1252;"Viewed from this perspective, ""Apollo 13"" the film and the mission are that much more powerful and emotional to watch and I couldn't help but feel a little bit of nostalgia for those earlier days in the American space program."
I:8897;1253;Apollo 13 will keep you on the edge of your seat knowing that these events actually took place!
I:8897;1254;For those of you who were not around to witness the event it's quite a great bit of history.
I:8897;1255;Full of technical challenges and courage I highly recommend you look to this movie as a bit of history unfolds right before your eyes!
I:8897;1256;Yes, it beats all the fictional space movies.
I:8897;1257;And even though everyone knows (or should know) what happened, it is still a nail.
I:8897;1258;biter the first time viewed and can hold your interest on multiple viewings.
I:8897;1259;It's based on a true story (some say, ha!)
I:8897;1260;Tom Hanks did a phenomenal job acting, and the movie is well written and well scored.
I:8897;1261;Great movie that pays tribute to a group of men and women that we rarely hear about.
I:8897;1262;I love, love, love this movie .
I:8897;1263;so much, that I may know it by heart .
I:8897;1264;disc anniversary edition, IMAX Experience version .
I:8897;1265;It was great to watch this movie again with my kids.
I:8897;1266;"ray is that it takes so long to actually start, and ""Apollo 13"" is no exception."
I:8897;1267;That's why I bought it locally .
I:8897;1268;I wanted to return it easily.
I:8897;1269;Apollo 13 just tells the story, and let's the story pull you in.
I:8897;1270;It does and you're hooked.
I:8897;1271;It's a great film, and it also shows off what a Blu.
I:8897;1272;This movie still stands as one of the greatest, previously untold, stories of heroic American pioneers, challenging the boundries of human endurance as we entered the infancy of space travel in the 60s.
I:8897;1273;An incredible story during one of the most interesting decades of the 20th century.
I:8897;1274;His adaptation of Apollo 13 is genius.
I:8897;1275;This is definitely a good family movie or a movie to be seen by yourself.
I:8897;1276;This movie will probably go down as the best historical depiction of an Apollo Saturn 5 launch and a commemoration of an incredible period of NASA history.
I:8897;1277;This movie captures it very well.
I:8897;1278;Apollo 13 is a well cast and extremely well directed movie that tells the story of one of NASA's finest hours.
I:8897;1279;Even though the actual outcome is well known, the movie provides dramatic tension as the Apollo 13 crew and the people at mission control work their way through a most remarkable life threatening situation.
I:8897;1280;The cast is outstanding, with Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Gary Sinise all giving wonderful performances.
I:8897;1281;He is just incredibly good in this role , possibly his finest hour on screen.
I:8897;1282;it is easy to take the technical aspects of this film for granted because they are so realistic and presented in almost documentary form but the effects and the atmosphere aboard the space capsule and lunar landing craft are extraordinary.
I:8897;1283;this is definitely a film worth owning and one I pull off the shelf now and then and always enjoy viewing.
I:8897;1284;It's a long way from Happy Days to the space race but Ron Howard has done a fantastic job of bringing the Apollo 13 story to the big screen.
I:8897;1285;I loved the special effects, loved the acting, loved the suspense and was inspired by the music score much as I inspired by those original events I still vividly recall as a nine year old Australian school boy.
I:8897;1286;Somehow Howard created a crescendo of drama that wasn't eased until we see scenes of Astronauts' gloves floating in zero gravity.
I:8897;1287;Another feature is the excellent recreation of Mission Control in Houston.
I:8897;1288;The supporting cast were fantastic.
I:8897;1289;I liked Happy Days, Ron, but I loved Apollo 13 even more.
I:8897;1290;Movie making at its best.
I:8897;1291;This movie gets better with each viewing.
I:8897;1292;It gets a lot better after visiting the Kennedy Space Center.
I:8897;1293;Apollo 13 is my favorite dramatic movie of all time.
I:8897;1294;The Apollo program still intrigues me, and I still regard it as the greatest technological triumph in the history of the world.
I:8897;1295;ron Howard and Tom Hanks did the world a great favor by reminding people of the human risk and personal sacrifice required by the Astronauts and their families.
I:8897;1296;"Apollo 13 is not only a great work of cinema
I:8897;1297;"the film itself is absolutely stunning, with breathtaking effects, and many scenes filmed in the NASA C.135 ""Vomit Comet"" parabolic flight ""Zero."
I:8897;1298;Nonetheless, the film is very authentic looking, which I attribute to the Howard and Hanks authenticity requirements, as well as having Dave Scott as a technical advisor.
I:8897;1299;"the extras are great
I:8897;1300;The best extra is the commentary track with Jim and Marilyn Lovell, which explains what they like about the film, interesting backstory information, and occasional technical corrections from Jim.
I:8897;1301;this is the best drama I have ever seen.
I:8897;1302;I am a fan of Apollo 13 and was looking forward to viewing this.
I:8897;1303;If you've ever wondered what really happened on the Apollo 13 moon mission, then this movie will show you.
I:8897;1304;It is good to know what these Astronauts went through trying to get back home after an explosion caused them to abort their moon landing.
I:8897;1305;See next paragraph for the technical details but I must first sing the praises of this wonderful film.
I:8897;1306;This has always been one of my favorites.
I:8897;1307;perfect and the cast is terrific.
I:8897;1308;The movie does a wonderful job of almost moving the viewer back in time to when the events of that ill.
I:8897;1309;As one of the characters notes this really was NASA's finest hour and this movie puts you squarely in the middle of it .
I:8897;1310;My favorite extra feature is the commentary track by the director.
I:8897;1311;I don't often watch a whole movie through with commentary track on but this one is well worth it, offering insights into Howard's direction style which meshed perfectly with the subject matter of this film.
I:8897;1312;Can you imagine Hitchcock (also one of my favorites) directing this film?
I:8897;1313;a really wonderful bit of cinematography.
I:8897;1314;All in all, in my opinion one of the best films made in the last 50 years .
I:8897;1315;heck, one of the best ever.
I:8897;1316;Extra features include the above.
I:8897;1317;mentioned director's narration which is terrific.
I:8897;1318;The movie played well (eventually) on my Sony player .
I:8897;1319;"I do hope they remedy this with a future release without so much wait time but in the end it was a ""small price to pay"" to watch this great film."
I:8897;1320;A good way to view history, fact and fiction.
I:8897;1321;it was well done the actors well chosen.
I:8897;1322;It is a powerful film.
I:8897;1323;"It may have been the space agency's finest hour
I:8897;1324;especially prompting reconsideration of the propriety of the whole effort while also solidifying in the popular mind NASA's collective genius.
I:8897;1325;The fact that Apollo 13 is now viewed as one of NASA's shining moments says much about the ability of humanity to recast historical events into meaningful morality plays.
I:8897;1326;"They are, in the words of one of the astronauts portrayed in the film, ""steely."
I:8897;1327;At the same time it is a powerful story of courage and diligence that remains one of the best films to appear in the last ten years.
I:8897;1328;This film, in my opinion, is a staggering achievement.
I:8897;1329;The most impressive thing about this film is the fact that almost the entire storyline is absolutely authentic.
I:8897;1330;The skill and bravery (and honest fears) of the crew, the ingenuity of the NASA ground support team, the events as portrayed in the movie.
I:8897;1331;"this is said to be the influence of Tom Hanks, who is a space enthusiast
I:8897;1332;this is a powerfully told story about a great event and a great success of courage and technological prowess.
I:8897;1333;i like Tom Hanks as an actor, and this is the best performance by him that I can recall seeing.
I:8897;1334;he plays the part to utter perfection.
I:8897;1335;The supporting cast is equally good and all turn in superb performances.
I:8897;1336;This is a great and classic film that will leave few viewers untouched.
I:8897;1337;What stands out is the absolutely incredible re.
I:8897;1338;Everyone in this movie plays their part incredibly well.
I:8897;1339;And he actor who played Gene Kranz was, to me, the best of all.
I:8897;1340;This was an xmas gift for the family gift exchange.
I:8897;1341;Ron Howard did a excellent job directing this movie.
I:8897;1342;Tom Hanks and Ed Harris was great as usual.
I:8897;1343;I can relate to the time the events actually took place.
I:8897;1344;This movie is a must for your collection.
I:8897;1345;A well done movie by Ron Howard.
I:8897;1346;A must see if you wantto really learn about what happened with Apollo 13.
I:8897;1347;The Anniversary edition is well worth it.
I:8897;1348;placed studio clowns have reattached their heads in the right direction.
I:8897;1349;"Gene Kranz (via Ed Harris in Apollo 13): ""With all due respect, sir, I believe this is gonna be our finest hour."
I:8897;1350;ron Howard really directed a wonderful tale of this chapter in space exploration.
I:8897;1351;It is a great story, and should continue to entertain audiences for generations.
I:8897;1352;After hearing them speak I HAD to see Apollo 13 again.
I:8897;1353;Great movie for young and old alike.
I:8897;1354;After several minutes of loading, I hit play and the screen displays a strange white image.
I:8897;1355;fast forward to this year and all the good deals around Black Friday.
I:8897;1356;I saw Amazon had Apollo 13 for a great price, and I thought that by now Universal Studios surely would have fixed this major problem.
I:8897;1357;titles coming to us, we'll have to see where a movie .
I:8897;1358;can distinguish itself from the rest.
I:8897;1359;Here we have a beautiful DTS.
I:8897;1360;version and this movie (one of Ron Howard's best work) is based on authentic events, which makes it also well.
I:8897;1361;worth the time to view it more than once.
I:8897;1362;Add up the fact that this is an all star cast with great performances, what else is there to tell?
I:8897;1363;I showed this classic movie in my 6th grade science classroom when we were studying our space unit.
I:8897;1364;I really love this movie.
I:8897;1365;It portrays a wonderful period in this nation's history.
I:8897;1366;His journey on Apollo 8 was much more important to him and his crew.
I:8897;1367;Tom Hanks was the one so excited by this movie.
I:8897;1368;that is good because I think it brought home to the American people what a miracle Apollo was.
I:8897;1369;This movie was well done and very accurate.
I:8897;1370;Usually this is a good sign, as it indicates that less Digital Noise Reduction has been applied.
I:8897;1371;For anyone that did not grow up in this era of space travle, this is a must see.
I:8897;1372;I've known the story of the flight very well for years before the film was released, and watching the film I'd say to myself that this is about the time that XXX happened and sure enough a few minutes later it sure did!Look quick at the very end of the movie for the REAL Jim Lovell, he's the Navy Captian with gray hair shaking T. Hanks hand!see the IMAX version last.
I:8897;1373;Can someone please help me out with this blu.
I:8897;1374;"No menu that tells you ""play,"" ""additional features,"" etc. ever shows on the screen."
I:8897;1375;"The major change is an unnatural increase in color saturation
I:8897;1376;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:8897;1377;The price is good, and the extras on the special edition are great.
I:8897;1378;Tom Hanks and the rest of the ensemble cast did a fantastic job of creating the mood and uplifting spirit.
I:8897;1379;A fantastic movie to make you feel good.
I:8897;1380;I have always loved this movie.
I:8897;1381;I think it's a great movie with a great cast.
I:8897;1382;So many good actors in this one and Tom Hanks is first rate with his acting as always.
I:8897;1383;And Ron Howard does great directing and just gets better and better over time.
I:8897;1384;This is true history that I never knew happened even when I was a teenager at the time.
I:8897;1385;It is amazing everything that happened to them and that they made it home at all.
I:8897;1386;well done movie and story telling.
I:8897;1387;Loved the extras with this.
I:8897;1388;This is a movie well worth purchasing and to have in your collection for viewing in the future.
I:8897;1389;As well as being an historical event.
I:8897;1390;I highly recommend getting this movie.
I:8897;1391;This is one of the finest movies ever made!
I:8897;1392;The 2 disc anniversary addition is so worth everything.
I:8897;1393;"It gave me hours of pleasure to see the ""behind"" the scenes and to listen to Ron Howard comment on how the movie was made is absolutely entertaining."
I:8897;1394;I like to collect the movies I really enjoy.
I:8897;1395;Apollo 13 is one of the best movies I have seen and deserves a 5.
I:8897;1396;ray (I've worked at Target's entertainment department for 13 years, I'm very familiar with the wrap).
I:8897;1397;A boy's space adventure with an all.
I:8897;1398;star cast, this blockbuster hit trades heavily on nostalgia for the glory years of the American Space Program.
I:8897;1399;Apollo 13 has all the advantages: top.
I:8897;1400;"notch special effects
I:8897;1401;I recommend this movie to all people who have a good taste in movies.
I:8897;1402;"When I received this movie the date for utilizing the so called ""Digital Copy"" had expired."
I:8897;1403;obviously, the movie itself is good.
I:8897;1404;"hopefully, the upcoming movie ""Man Conquers Space"" will be better."
I:8897;1405;I watched this movie when it first came out it was good but the more I have watched it the better it gets it make me so proud to be an american to see how far we have advance JFK would be so proud best line we are hauling the mail, ok boys you will feel a slight jolt LOL just very good my two year old grandaughter loves it
I:8897;1406;When it does, it's phenomenal.
I:8897;1407;This film explores the adventure of three astronauts who didn't quite make it to the moon.
I:8897;1408;This will become an American classic, if it's not already.
I:8897;1409;This is a fantastic Blu.
I:8897;1410;ray with a great transfer and sound.
I:8897;1411;Aside from some dated special effects everything looks realistic and it sucks you right in.
I:8897;1412;Highly recommend this for any blu.
I:8897;1413;Much to my surprise, the music kept going and going and going.
I:8897;1414;I made them into mp3's and now I listen to them regularly.
I:8897;1415;James Horner is a brilliant composer and this soundtrack is on par with that of his other scores including The Hunt for Red October and Titanic.
I:8897;1416;I found the story fascinating and was absolutely gripped as the climax unfolded.
I:8897;1417;Really good acting by all parties made it a delightful movie too.
I:8897;1418;A little on the long side, but I love movies about the Apollo space missions.
I:8897;1419;I would recommend it to anyone who loves American history too.
I:8897;1420;I love the convenience of Amazon.
I:8897;1421;I will use this again for sure.
I:8897;1422;After returning from the Kennedy Space Center with our 11 year old grandson this was a good movie to watch!Well done, fine acting almost a tragedy!
I:8897;1423;Otherwise a great movie and a great behind the scenes extras.
I:8897;1424;"This is a great movie that really stands up to the test of time
I:8897;1425;The video is completely demo disc worthy for those who have the system that can show it.
I:8897;1426;Hope you have a good sound system as it will certainly get a strong workout in many parts of film.
I:8897;1427;Your subwoofer will have its boundaries explored both during the early music score as well as in many areas of foley effects.
I:8897;1428;There is great use of the discreet channels with, when appropriate, marvelous directionality and panning around the front and rear sound stages.
I:8897;1429;All audio is precise, properly leveled and enveloping when you should be enveloped.
I:8897;1430;for my part, this is one transfer to blu ray that makes having a hi end system worth having.
I:8897;1431;hanks, Harris, Paxton, Sinise and Bacon are at their best in Apollo 13.
I:8897;1432;We see the importance of trusting in the overall ability of the team, both in space and back in Houston.
I:8897;1433;Director Ron Howard does a good job of showing how events aboard the ship affected things on the ground.
I:8897;1434;the overall look of the movie feels authentic.
I:8897;1435;Shots of space are particularly effective.
I:8897;1436;the movie is structured in such a way that we feel that the three astronauts have something to lose other than their own lives.
I:8897;1437;We also see other crew members and it gives us a glimpse of their personalities.
I:8897;1438;This segment is so effective and adds a lot to the remainder of the movie.
I:8897;1439;Howard makes us feel as though we are back in 1970 and that we are part of Lovell's family or immediate friends.
I:8897;1440;"Ron Howard's Oscar winning ""Apollo 13"" is competently made in every aspect."
I:8897;1441;"Masterful cinematography by the now legendary Dean Cundey and flawless editing solidify ""Apollo 13"" as the American history classic it is today."
I:8897;1442;"With fine tuned performances from Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan
I:8897;1443;This is the greatest SPACE movie of all time, without any reasonable doubt.
I:8897;1444;Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan ALL give superb performances.
I:8897;1445;I really like the way they were able to make an old story exciting without taking much dramatic license.
I:8897;1446;This is still Ron Howard's best film as a director.
I:8897;1447;Anyone who wishes to see an historical adventure movie should look no further than APOLLO 13.
I:8897;1448;It'll make you feel great, trust me!
I:8897;1449;APOLLO 13 is one of those wonderfully crafted films, where the climax carries no surprise, no plot twists, no unexpected revelations, yet is immensely satisfying.
I:8897;1450;directed by Ron Howard, the splendid cast led by Tom Hanks, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton, Kathleen Quinlan and a host of others, combine in an absorbing, riveting story of the space program's finest hour .
I:8897;1451;the triumph of human ingenuity in the face of overwhelming technical failure.
I:8897;1452;the technical aspects of the film are splendid, and Mr. Howard recreates the images and feelings of those heady days of the space program.
I:8897;1453;Special effects complement the story perfectly: they are wholly satisfying without the gratuitous excess so common in more recent movies.
I:8897;1454;the drama succeeds on many levels.
I:8897;1455;First, the actors in large roles and small are thoroughly believable .
I:8897;1456;even when incidents and events are heightened for dramatic effect, they are completely credible.
I:8897;1457;Third, the writing is crisp, the timing perfect and the interplay among all levels of characters is exact.
I:8897;1458;the Special Edition has a number of exceptional features, including Ron Howard's commentary, Jim and Marilyn Lovell's audio, and the intriguing documentary on the making of the film.
I:8897;1459;aPOLLO 13 is, in my opinion, Ron Howard's best work .
I:8897;1460;and given his other films, that is really saying something.
I:8897;1461;Apollo 13 (1995) was Ron Howard's excellent, patriotic re.
I:8897;1462;Howard makes a film that has you waving the flag when you walk out.
I:8897;1463;It is exceedingly well done.
I:8897;1464;For those of you who were not alive in the 1960's, you will want to watch this to improve your cultural awareness of major historical events in America.
I:8897;1465;I love a lot Tom Hanks' movies.
I:8897;1466;This is a well done movie.
I:8897;1467;It really lets you see what they went through.
I:8897;1468;It was amazing to watch what they went though.
I:8897;1469;The movie is one of my favorites, but Amazon streaming is patchy, with frequent buffering and hiccups.
I:8897;1470;we got it and I want to see it and see it and see it again and again!!!!!!
I:8897;1471;paced, great character development, plus you get the feeling about how important (or not) the space program had become by this time.
I:8897;1472;Very interesting to see how this flight affected the family, as well as how it affected the actual astronauts.
I:8897;1473;Kathleen Quinlan as Mrs. Lovell is outstanding.
I:8897;1474;this movie is a really good movie that does not get old.
I:8897;1475;i still enjoy watching it as i did when it was in theaters
I:8897;1476;i have thought that a series of Apolo challenging succeeded, but when I watched this movie, I was very surprised.
I:8897;1477;In such meaning, the movie was important for me.
I:8897;1478;though the comment have been said from old times, arriving to the moon was incredible things and dreaming.
I:8897;1479;but challenging is what give dream to us.
I:8897;1480;this movie is just great.
I:8897;1481;it is realistic, it has great performances.
I:8897;1482;it's drama with some nicely spaced comedic moments.
I:8897;1483;The price was great and it even arrived a day early.
I:8897;1484;This is the type of movie you can watch with your whole family.
I:8897;1485;The facts were so good I use it in my US History class for juniors in high school.
I:8897;1486;This is a great movie to watch with your tweens,
I:8897;1487;Ahhhh, what a great movie.
I:8897;1488;Apollo 13 is a rare combination.
I:8897;1489;Tom Hanks nearly won his third consecutive Oscar for this effort, and very deservedly so.
I:8897;1490;Even with the movie's foregone conclusion (it IS a historical film) Ron Howard manages to keep tremendous tension in tightly strung film.
I:8897;1491;Overall, Apollo 13 is a tremendously entertaining movie that performs the unique effort of keeping historical faithfulness, personal interest, and the big picture all in razor sharp focus.
I:8897;1492;By far the most interesting feature of the movie is the commentary track by Jim and Marilyn Lovell.
I:8897;1493;Jim Lovell, besides having an excellent memory of the events depicted, clearly has a tremendous appreciation for the moviemaking process.
I:8897;1494;When he points out the differences between the film and what actually happened, he also does a fine job of exlpaining WHY the change was made in way that makes you feel comfortable with the whole film.
I:8897;1495;The Lovells also have a tremendous appreciation for Tom Hanks, pointing many of the small gestures, turns of phrases, and other idiosyncracies of Jim Lovell that he picked up and blended into his performance.
I:8897;1496;This is one of the best commentary tracks on any film.
I:8897;1497;the documentaries showing the experiences of the actors, the research involved, and the details of the actual events provide a rich and informative backdrop for the movie.
I:8897;1498;This is a classic American movie about classic American history.
I:8897;1499;It is a great film because it will always inspire to think and use your imagination.
I:8897;1500;It is a great film about an inspiring story.
I:8897;1501;The acting in the movie is fantastic.
I:8897;1502;everyone from Tom Hanks to Ed Harris on down the list superbly act this true event from our nation's history.
I:8897;1503;Even the background music is great.
I:8897;1504;seamlessly fitting into the mood of the movie.
I:8897;1505;Annie Lennox does the vocalizations, and her voice is, as always, immensely powerful.
I:8897;1506;The liftoff is breathtaking, with multiple views of the size and grandeur of the Saturn V rocket.
I:8897;1507;tom Hanks makes for a very effective choice as Jim Lovell.
I:8897;1508;The way he tries to keep up the spirits of his crew while trying to mastermind the success of getting back to Earth is tremendously entertaining.
I:8897;1509;Haise and Swigert are by the windows craning to get a good look, but Jim prefers to use his imagination.
I:8897;1510;His sadness is profound and moving.
I:8897;1511;Ken has to work around the clock putting together a procedure that will enable the space shuttle to reenter the Earth's atmosphere.
I:8897;1512;"Although some of his lines of dialogue are very ""all American"", he is still very rousing as the head of Mission Control."
I:8897;1513;She still gives it all she's got, and it would be hard to imagine the film without her.
I:8897;1514;Director Howard has assembled a superb ensemble cast, and has a decent script to work from.
I:8897;1515;"No one with any sense would label Howard an auteur, and this works well for ""Apollo 13"" because it allows us to concentrate on the individuals in front of the camera rather than the guy behind it."
I:8897;1516;The moods in this picture are impressively judged, the historic build up (which admittedly does drag slightly), the perilous middle and the triumphant end.
I:8897;1517;The effects are superb, but they aren't the only thing here, making this a true blockbuster with soul.
I:8897;1518;good production and one of the better films of the year.
I:8897;1519;This film helps do both.
I:8897;1520;Super movie with a lot of Historical Truth!
I:8897;1521;ray player hooked to the BD.
I:8897;1522;ray on it and it worked.
I:8897;1523;ray to start with the movie as Warner Bros is decent enough to do.
I:8897;1524;he or she probably got a big bonus, can you imagine that?)
I:8897;1525;"I told my wife this was the ""Great Leap Backwards."""
I:8897;1526;(I do hope my Chinese friends will forgive me for this bit of grim humor.)
I:8897;1527;The movie was in great condition.
I:8897;1528;Everyone knows that Apollo 13 is a well written and directed movie (Ronny Howard).
I:8897;1529;With nice speakers and a subwoofer, DTS makes this movie worth the price.
I:8897;1530;DTS does a much better job with the surround channels as well.
I:8897;1531;Transitions are smoother and the sound flows around you.
I:8897;1532;I say that the DTS decoder and the DTS movies by Amazon are well worth the money for even the small home theater guru.
I:8897;1533;This is truly an inspiring film, with stellar performances from the entire cast.
I:8897;1534;The CG effects in the movie are spectacularly realistic.
I:8897;1535;Although it's not 100% techically or historically accurate, it still leaves you with great respect for the Apollo 13 astronauts and the flight crew that brought them home.
I:8897;1536;This film is a tribute to Ron Howard's directing genius and to human ingenuity.
I:8897;1537;It's loaded with goodies, including the film's theatrical trailer, an interesting short making of film, and lots of data on the cast and crew.
I:8897;1538;in conclusion, this is a must.
I:8897;1539;"There's nothing closer to a perfect movie than ""Apollo 13""."
I:8897;1540;it's still beyond comprehension why Tom Hanks got snubbed for Best Actor and Ron Howard for Best Director and the movie itself for Best Picture when they all clearly were.
I:8897;1541;"Maybe they're saving it for ""Best Picture of All Time""."
I:8897;1542;If you already love the movie, are bothered by the unpredictable resolution of uploads and have a blu.
I:8897;1543;ray player I would definitely recommend this.
I:8897;1544;If you've never seen the movie, I still recommend it because of it's universal story of lost heroes trying to make their way back home.
I:8897;1545;"Unlike ""The Right Stuff,"" the brilliant film on the Mercury space program that focuses more on character profiles and symbolism than factual history, ""Apollo 13"" is an entertaining space film that can be used by high school and junior high history teachers."
I:8897;1546;This is due to director Ron Howard and his crew's painstaking recreation of the Apollo space program .
I:8897;1547;where Howard's dazzling special effects and technical accuracy leave off, his cast takes over.
I:8897;1548;Tom Hanks' enthusiasm for the subject matter shows as Commander Jim Lovell.
I:8897;1549;He skillfully portrays both the excitement of going into space and the stoicism with which the astronauts approached their dangerous work.
I:8897;1550;They are given ample opportunity to do so, thanks to the wise decision to focus as much on the heroism on the ground from geeks with pocket protectors as the heroism in space from the astronauts.
I:8897;1551;still, the film is alternately suspenseful and meticulous in most of the right places, and is therefore valuable both as a movie and as a historical record.
I:8897;1552;Thanks to heroic action by the crew and superhuman work by the NASA ground crew, the crew of Apollo 13 crew came back home alive.
I:8897;1553;It was NASA's finest hour and one of the greatest feats in the history of America.
I:8897;1554;This is one of the greatest, most exciting movies ever made.
I:8897;1555;Perhaps, the Chinese or Iranians will let our children hitch a ride to the Moon with them.
I:8897;1556;This is an awesome movie!
I:8897;1557;I had to watch it for my Astronomy class and even though I had seen it when it first came out, I still enjoyed it!
I:8897;1558;It's amazing what human ingenuity can accomplish!
I:8897;1559;All his stuff is good and this is no exception.
I:8897;1560;Suspenseful, entertaining and a happy ending.
I:8897;1561;I'm not quite old enough to remember the details of Apollo 13, but this movie fills in the blanks nicely with excellent drama.
I:8897;1562;Great movie and even more incredible story.
I:8897;1563;I have been a big fan of Apollo 13 ever since it was in the cinemas.
I:8897;1564;Like most people I always wondered what sections are true and what sections were added in by Ron Howard.
I:8897;1565;He explains what sections are true and which were artistic license.
I:8897;1566;Meanwhile, at Mission Control, astronaut Ken Mattingly, flight director Gene Kranz and a heroic ground crew race against time, and the odds to bring them home.
I:8897;1567;One of the most significant things about Apollo 13 is the fact that it managed to be such a strikingly realistic movie despite the abundance of well.
I:8897;1568;Tom Hanks, of course, can convincingly act any part in the world, and his role in Apollo 13 is no exception.
I:8897;1569;All of the actors involved seemed to have been given parts that they were born to play, because they were so successful in the roles.
I:8897;1570;The true events of the historic Apollo 13 mission are amazingly re.
I:8897;1571;created here, and the results are spectacular.
I:8897;1572;Apollo 13 is an excellent story made even better by the fact that it is true, it has great acting, skillful direction, and plenty of tasteful humor.
I:8897;1573;It is not only a highly entertaining movie, but is also a educational one.
I:8897;1574;Others have remarked well enough on the virtues of _Apollo 13_ as a film.
I:8897;1575;anyone who's interested in filmmaking will be riveted by both the Ron Howard running film commentary and the hour.
I:8897;1576;This is made all the more interesting and informative for the filmmaking student in that _Apollo 13_ wasn't just the retelling of Lovell's real.
I:8897;1577;life experience, it's also the film version of his book.
I:8897;1578;Getting his perspective both as narrative object and storyteller is fascinating, as are Marilyn's observations on Kathleen Quinlan's Academy.
I:8897;1579;great movie was interrupted with download a couple times during the viewing of movie.
I:8897;1580;A beautifully filmed documentary type film to remember the pinnacle of human achievement.
I:8897;1581;Not one but two commentaries, an immensly entertaining documentary, a cache of other goodies and all on one disc.
I:8897;1582;This has been a favorite in my library since a got it over a year ago.
I:8897;1583;The movie is great and is one of Ron Howards best.
I:8897;1584;It's nice to know that some studios got theirs right the first time.
I:8897;1585;They will have to collaborate to be successful.
I:8897;1586;One of the best movies Ive ever seen!
I:8897;1587;Great Acting with great Actors.
I:8897;1588;Watch this movie as a family before our trip to houston.
I:8897;1589;it helped get the kids excited gor the museums.
I:8897;1590;This is another great film for anyone's collection.
I:8897;1591;The space scenes make you feel like you're really out thre with them.
I:8897;1592;"space"" stuff, but you have to remember that this film is actually quite old now, so I believe the transfer is as good as can be expected, with little to gripe about."
I:8897;1593;All in all, the film itself excels at what it tries to do.
I:8897;1594;Apollo 13 does a good job of recreating what life was like in 60's America.
I:8897;1595;The story is based on a real event and keeps viewers attention not simply on will the crew make it back home to earth but on the efforts of the hundreds of people who helped prove why there is still hope that people and life are more important than what most likely would be today's media concern for who's at fault for an equipment failure.
I:8897;1596;A great film for the whole family.
I:8897;1597;Fantastic movie based on the book.
I:8897;1598;one of the best collections of actors you can get.
I:8897;1599;This is a very good movie, but if you are thinking about double.
I:8897;1600;even though I know how it will end, I am caught up in the adventure, the terror, the heroism, and the space science.
I:8897;1601;The actors are excellent, especially Ed Harris as the Chief of Mission Control.
I:8897;1602;actually, more interesting, if that's possible.
I:8897;1603;it's a science movie, an adventure, and a true story all rolled into one.
I:8897;1604;With lots of great interviews!
I:8897;1605;The true story and greatest actors make this movie more realist!If you do have dts theater audio equipment, you never miss this movie in your collection list!
I:8897;1606;This movie is very well done.
I:8897;1607;A couple of minor scenes were created for dramatic effect but for the most part, it is historically true.
I:8897;1608;The kids really enjoyed it and learned a lot.
I:8897;1609;Originally slated for Apollo 14, the crew was moved up in the rotation when Alan Shepard developed a raging ear infection.
I:8897;1610;This apathy was reflected in the complete disinterest of the public until the crew's life was in peril.
I:8897;1611;"A dramatic, powerful docudrama with riveting direction by Ron Howard (""A Beautiful Mind""), great acting by Hanks, Paxton, Sinise, Bacon and Kathleen Quinlan, ""Apollo 13"" continues to resonate particularly in light of the disasters that have afflicted the Space Shuttle Program and subsequent loss of human life despite all the safety measures NASA has taken over the years."
I:8897;1612;Apollo 13 reminds us that despite the appearance of routine of these types of missions, they are far from routine and represent significant risk to the lives of those brave men and women who fly into space.
I:8897;1613;a sharp, vivid transfer with robust colors and deep, dark blacks are a highlight of this terrific transfer.
I:8897;1614;Honestly, the previous edition looked just as sharp and just as good.
I:8897;1615;"the resolution on ""Apollo 13: The Image Experience"" which occupies the second disc likewise looks terrific with slightly better definition perhaps because it was intended for a much larger screen originally."
I:8897;1616;The sound for the Imax edition features an extremely active DTS mix that sounds slightly fuller and with improved depth than the 5.1 mix on the first disc.
I:8897;1617;Still here are the original two commentary tracks by director Ron Howard and astronaut Jim Lovell with his wife Marilyn.
I:8897;1618;There are the production notes from the previous edition as well as the original theatrical trailer.
I:8897;1619;"Luckily, the exceptional documentary ""Lost Moon: The Triumph of Apollo 13"" still appears on disc one."
I:8897;1620;It's a great glimpse into the real events that inspired the movie but also focuses much more on the behind.
I:8897;1621;Conquering Space: The Moon and Beyond provides a nice 45 minute summary of the space race and what prompted America to go to the moon in the first place.
I:8897;1622;Opening with President John F. Kennedy's commitment to space exploration in vintage footage from 1961, the documentary touches on the highlights of the space race including footage of the first Soviet spaceships and the impact that the launch of Sputnik had on the world.
I:8897;1623;Featuring interviews with astronauts Jim Lovell, Shannon Lucid, Roger Crouch and others the documentary does a nice job of summarizing both the successes and disasters that dogged both the United States and the Soviet Union during the competition to escape a foothold on the moon.
I:8897;1624;It's a nice compliment to the film.
I:8897;1625;Featuring actual NASA footage from the Apollo 13 mission, it brings the reality of what occurred home.
I:8897;1626;the Lovell's commentary track is particularly revealing about what occurred in real life.
I:8897;1627;So happy to see that Amazon had it available and movie night was on!With all the special effects and advances in film that have been made since this film, it goes to show that there is no replacing a great script, excellent talent and directing.
I:8897;1628;My son and I were highly entertained and we had a timely dialogue about disappointment and what the world was like when I was a young girl.
I:8897;1629;Good acting, good direction .
I:8897;1630;One of my favorite movies of all time .
I:8897;1631;very realistic in all respects.
I:8897;1632;I remember that era very well.
I:8897;1633;Great scenes on leadership in crisis situations.
I:8897;1634;Great play of all actors.
I:8897;1635;ray version brings so much clarity and added drama to an already fantastic movie.
I:8897;1636;Fantastic performance by Tom Hanks and his colleagues.
I:8897;1637;You know the storyline and I think it's well done.
I:8897;1638;The blending of a historical event with a gripping story.
I:8897;1639;telling made it very enjoyable and had the whole family on the edge of our seats (again).
I:8897;1640;Just as exciting watching it a second time around.
I:8897;1641;As a teen, I remember this vividly, and the movie more than does justice to the memories.
I:8897;1642;The original news footage was an added bonus.
I:8897;1643;time heroes) by Ed Harris .
I:8897;1644;Faced with unbeatable odds .
I:8897;1645;I personally salute all of you on a job well done.
I:8897;1646;One of the best movies I have bought to date.
I:8897;1647;I've watched Apollo 13 over the years and it has maintained a level of greatness unmatched by many movies.
I:8897;1648;The effects are still really good, even for it to be a pre.
I:8897;1649;One of my top 50 favorites of all time.
I:8897;1650;Thank you for making it do easy!
I:8897;1651;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:8897;1652;I reccomend it to anyone.
I:8897;1653;My favorite part is when Fred throws up and the puke floats in the micro gravity.
I:8897;1654;This movie is high in my top 10 off all times list, and is probably the best 'mainstream hollywood' movie I can think of.
I:8897;1655;I watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying, thrilling and suspenseful as it was when I saw it first more than 10 years ago.
I:8897;1656;My 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well.
I:8897;1657;Great performance by all cast but especially Hanks, Paxton and Beacon.
I:8897;1658;Probably Ron Howard best film ever.
