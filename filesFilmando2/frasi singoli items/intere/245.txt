I:325;1;Man on Fire is one of Denzels greatest performances.
I:325;2;The story is excellent and is complimented by a great cast of actors.
I:325;3;this definately recieves my seal of approval for a solid viewing experience.
I:325;4;Watch it like 5 times or so!
I:325;5;This movie is a great movie overall.
I:325;6;My life for my friends life so that they can live.
I:325;7;I was at the edge my seat.
I:325;8;I like this movie and its a must OWN!!!!
I:325;9;Worth it and very, very interesting and powerfull !
I:325;10;One of the best movies ever made in history.
I:325;11;I think this one is the best DENZEL WASHINGTON flick he has ever done.
I:325;12;But Denzel Washington carries her through the movie, with his talent and appeal.
I:325;13;Beyond that it has some funny moments and it's gorey moments, but it is definately worth seeing just for the rectal bomb.
I:325;14;If you're looking for a movie that brings you well developed characters and bad guys that need to be taught a lesson then this is the movie for you.
I:325;15;This film takes time to tell the main story, which is about a man who has lost his way but finds the will to live in being the bodyguard for a precocious little girl.
I:325;16;"The ""triumph"" (seems overly dramatic to use that word) of our hero over his drinking problem and lack of motivation for life is told well and the relationship between the two main characters is developed carefully and believably."
I:325;17;The supporting characters are also fun, interesting, and quirky (Christopher Walken and Giancarlo Giannini especially).
I:325;18;It's not going to change your life or anything of the sort but it's entertaining and it doesn't leave you hanging in the end (i. e. closure).
I:325;19;His art is death, and he's about to paint his masterpiece .
I:325;20;I truly enjoyed this movie, it was full of action from beginning to the end.
I:325;21;It was very moving to see how easily someone can love a child.
I:325;22;I recommend you watch this movie.
I:325;23;This movie is very dark, but very good.
I:325;24;This is a great story about a man that is lost and finds a reason to live again.
I:325;25;Man On Fire is one of the better action and revenge films to come along in a while.
I:325;26;His friend sets him up with a job as a bodyguard for a little girl for a semi.
I:325;27;Denzel Washinghton delivers another amazing performance as a broken down drunk, who slowly rediscovers happiness, only to have it taken away.
I:325;28;Dakota Fanning is also amazing, as the bright little girl who shows Denzel life can still be good.
I:325;29;The direction by Tony Scott is very stylish and effective, as it is gritty looking, much like the feel of the film.
I:325;30;This is one of the better action thrillers you will see all year.
I:325;31;Man On Fire truly does sizzle!
I:325;32;Oh man what a wonderful movie!!
I:325;33;Denzel Washington certainly made his bones here as an action .
I:325;34;adventure star thus proving that he is one of the most versatile actors in todays market.
I:325;35;Dakota Fanning is a gifted child actress and makes Pita come alive on the screen.
I:325;36;this is good film with powerful performaces all around.
I:325;37;It was good to Rachel Ticotin ( Total Recal ) again, and the Mexican cast is all magnificent.
I:325;38;He is a credible action star and I hope to see more of him in these types of roles.
I:325;39;Without a doubt one of the best movies Denzel has ever made!
I:325;40;This was sent me to me in a timely manner and in excellent condition.
I:325;41;I would certainly recommend this seller again.
I:325;42;Any movie I've seen with Denzel Washington has been good but this one was by far the best one yet!
I:325;43;Better than the original movie made in the 1980's.
I:325;44;Denzel was his usual excellent self.
I:325;45;Dakota Fanning was fantastic as the little girl.
I:325;46;You ask her to tell you and you tell me the name of her bear!
I:325;47;A life for a life.
I:325;48;This is one of my favorite Denzel movies.
I:325;49;He is always good but in this I think he is exceptional.
I:325;50;Denzel makes this character real.
I:325;51;"A movie that takes the Love and Rage of a man to shows even people like you and me, what we ""could"" be capable of doing."
I:325;52;a movie that takes the things we love and lets us decide how far we will be willing to go to get them back.
I:325;53;watch it and love it without remorse.
I:325;54;Every time it is one TV and we came across it, we would have to watch it until the end.
I:325;55;i especially wanted to watch the end carefully, because it is the emotional lynchpin of the film.
I:325;56;Even while watching the performances, not the story, I still got caught up in the emotional intensity of those two creating their relationship.
I:325;57;only one actress has made me genuinely laugh, smile, and cry during the same movie, and that actress is Dakota Fanning.
I:325;58;"I'm not some ""fan boy"" as people like to say
I:325;59;I would be a happy person if she acted for the rest of her life.
I:325;60;The movie is damn good, and so are Denzel and Dakota.
I:325;61;Denzel and Dakota will hopefully do more movies together, the on screen chemistry really worked here.
I:325;62;I really enjoyed this movie and felt it was much much more than just a basic revenge film.
I:325;63;dakota plays a young rich girl longing to be loved for who she is and the relationship between her and Denzel (her bodyguard) grows into a friendship.
I:325;64;there are some violent scenes in this movie, but there is a lot of redemption and a real love story, so I still recommend it to those that often pass on these kinds of movies.
I:325;65;Both my teenagers enjoyed the flick, and although I hesitate to call it a family movie, there is much here to be appreciated by older teens through adults.
I:325;66;i give it a strong recommendation and think it's one worth having in the collection.
I:325;67;The first half of this movie is an absolutely beautiful love story involving an innocent young girl and a hardened alcoholic.
I:325;68;Watching his gruff exterior melt in the face of her relentless outpouring of acceptance and uncomplicated love was wonderful to behold.
I:325;69;The brutality that evolves is very hard to watch and stands in stark contrast to the lovely tale of love conquering all in the first half of the movie.
I:325;70;My friend recommended this film as one of the most spiritual movies she has ever seen.
I:325;71;Denzel Washington gives a strong performance as a broken Christ.
I:325;72;Denzel performance is fantastic and his actions are hardcore.
I:325;73;He allows you to feel his emotions as he takes you through his lows and highs as the story unfolds.
I:325;74;The ending is surprising, but fitting, as he discovers something so shocking that pushes him even harder to bring this to closure.
I:325;75;Note that the theatrical version is excellent, but the collector's edition shows you even more behind the story line, i. e. as some uncut scenes and many deleted scenes, which is even more intriguing.
I:325;76;Washington seems to always have some message in film without shouting about it.
I:325;77;This was no disappointment as the anti.
I:325;78;I liked this movie a lot, because it has a lot of action, as well as delves into what is happening in Mexico.
I:325;79;Mr. Washington gave one of his best performances.
I:325;80;if you want an engaging plot.
I:325;81;If you're trying to kill a couple hours without much thought process give this action movie a shot.
I:325;82;"good script, great acting, and lots of action to keep your surround sound speakers thumping, especially the subwoofer, as things go ""boom"" in some scenes."
I:325;83;The ending was somewhat surprising, which is always a plus.
I:325;84;Very realistic and thankfully unlike all the other action films where a guy gets shot in the thigh and stabbed in the shoulder, but kickboxes his way through the rest of the movie.
I:325;85;there is plenty to love about this film.
I:325;86;There's plenty of fine acting, a good story and thrilling action.
I:325;87;"keeping in mind all DW's previous roles, which are all very highb row, this film and ""OOT"" make the very well."
I:325;88;Remember, the earlier film, Out Of Time, is another good choice.
I:325;89;Great movie by and by.
I:325;90;It's been done and better.
I:325;91;Heart racing and very real.
I:325;92;the twists and turns keep you guessing.
I:325;93;The plot is powerful with emotions, characters, reactions and revenge (no crazy special effects) that make sure you consume your nails.
I:325;94;Denzel Washington acted brilliantly and made sure he gets bigger fan following after this movie.
I:325;95;there is one song from the soundtrack that I have loved, it sounds similar to the title track of Gladiator but has its own nuances and loved whenever it was played in the background.
I:325;96;a complete thriller and wonderfully directedI loved the movie and find it having re.
I:325;97;I have told everyone about this movie because of its charm and heartwarming conclusion.
I:325;98;The twists and turns of the movie really keep you on the edge of your seat, and I would recommend this movie to anyone.
I:325;99;And it came in great condition and it was brand new.
I:325;100;I absolutely love the way this film was shot.
I:325;101;The first half moved at such a slow pace that Tony Scott had to make the camera work intensfy every moment, and he pulled it off flawlessly.
I:325;102;She is kidnapped and Creasy is hospitalized.
I:325;103;denzel delivers yet another pwoerful performance.
I:325;104;the film was a great introduction to Dakota Fanning, I can tell she is going to be one excellent actress, hell she is already is one!
I:325;105;Christopher Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, and Mickey Rourke give brief, but great performances as the supporting cast as well.
I:325;106;"Walken gives a key line in the film about Creasy, stating ""Everyman is an artist at something."
I:325;107;I think thats why I love it so much.
I:325;108;"It's not about, ""hey you looked at me funny so now I gotta beat you up."""
I:325;109;He makes a sacrifice to save the one he loves.
I:325;110;this film is dirty and violent and disgusting, but in some ways it is also beautiful.
I:325;111;Washington and Fanning give fantastic performances.
I:325;112;Overall, though this film has flaws, it's still one of the best I've seen this year.
I:325;113;I would recommend this movie to people who love denial Washington
I:325;114;Denzel Washington reported considered this his finest and most demanding role.
I:325;115;The production values are amazing and the hardships of the film crew shooting this in Mexico City are the plot of a movie in itself.
I:325;116;Highly recommend adding it to your permanent collection.
I:325;117;I saw this movie in theaters and really enjoyed it.
I:325;118;Denzel does a great job of bringing ex.
I:325;119;The direction of the movie was done well also.
I:325;120;I recommend watching this movie if you like to see movies where you really feel for the main character and if you like Denzel Washington when he's at his best.
I:325;121;"Washington and the other actors are superb
I:325;122;"I found a new appreciation for it as well as ""got"" it."
I:325;123;"Now I own it and love the relationship between Denzel and little Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell (also in ""Silent Hill"", very good movie too)."
I:325;124;Marc Anthony, adds something as well as Mickey Rourke.
I:325;125;I'll watch almost anything with Christopher Walken.
I:325;126;"He's brilliant and has come a long way from ""The Deer Hunter"" through SNL with his ""more cowbells"" bit and a million projects in between."
I:325;127;He's fantastic, still going strong in a lot of directions, love him, he seems that he doesn't take himself too seriously.
I:325;128;This movie was truly the greatest thriller I have ever seen.
I:325;129;It is very intense, but it still has more to it than the action.
I:325;130;It has a great story that really gets you thinking about life and other important stuff.
I:325;131;It has the best acting I've seen in a long time.
I:325;132;He truly was at his best in this movie.
I:325;133;Dakota Fanning was the right person for this part and she played it awesome.
I:325;134;This movie is truly amazing.
I:325;135;It is my favorite and I would STRONGLY suggest that you see it.
I:325;136;Revenge is best served cold.
I:325;137;He can deliver more justice than your courts in ten years if you just get stay out of his way.
I:325;138;He's about to paint his masterpiece.Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning lead an outstanding cast in this gut.
I:325;139;wrenching story of love, devotion, duty, self.
I:325;140;But always Creasy has doubts.
I:325;141;He keeps the bullet, sensing it has special meaning.
I:325;142;It's brutal and painful, yet poignant and stirring.
I:325;143;The cinematography is compelling, the characterizations deep.
I:325;144;"Mexico City shows all its colors: the plush splendor of the rich
I:325;145;Crowds cheer as Creasy blows up a nightclub.
I:325;146;This is a powerful film.
I:325;147;Some may find this makes for a slow start, but I enjoyed it.
I:325;148;Christopher Walken is of course his usual awesome self and the scene where he describes Denzel's character to the policeman is classic.
I:325;149;The cinematography adds a touch of originality.
I:325;150;If you're looking for a guy flick that's slightly unique then this is the movie for you.
I:325;151;Best movie I've seen in years.
I:325;152;man on Fire was a great movie, it seems as though you pretty much know the story and you expect certain things to happen but the plot twists and turns in such a way that you will find yourself on the edge of your seat the throughout the entire movie asking yourself, what is going to happen next?
I:325;153;and the way that the subtitling was done was also a nice touch.
I:325;154;this is definitely one of Denzel's best movies and a must see for anybody who is tired of all these wannabe action/dramas that have been coming out latley.
I:325;155;"it's not often that a truly great movie comes around, but after seeing this movie I am convinced, and hopefully you will be too
I:325;156;Denzel Washington is at his best when he plays goodlooking, slick characters.
I:325;157;like his role as Tom Hanks' lawyer in PHILADELPHIA which showcased his handsome face, well proportioned physique, and his smooth talking.
I:325;158;I thought this movie was great.
I:325;159;It had enough action to go along with the story and created some kool drama.
I:325;160;Denzel as Creasy is absolutely one of his most endearing roles.
I:325;161;The love of Pita brings a man back from the desolation of all he has done, the loss of that little girl brings back a man seemingly good at only one thing: killing.
I:325;162;When Walken's character says, A man can be an artist at food, anything., Creasy's art is death, he's about to paint his masterpiece, it is a double foretelling of all the pain that he will inflict on those who harmed Pita as well as the toll it will take on him.
I:325;163;Most people are talking about Denzel Washington's brilliant performance.
I:325;164;She's such an amazing actress for her age!
I:325;165;She makes me believe she's really going through the emotional trama.
I:325;166;This movie brings you close to the characters for the first 50 minutes.
I:325;167;Then it makes you mad, want revenge, and it delivers!!!
I:325;168;If you get nothing else from this movie, the end should really touch your soul!
I:325;169;As usual and expected, Denzel Washington turns in a dramatic and magnificient performance as John Creazy.
I:325;170;Relentless in his pursuit of Pita's kidnappers and with the help of an attractive, female news reporter, he with Christopher Wilken's assistance, seeks each out and exacts his revenge.
I:325;171;The turn of events when he discovers the truth about her disappearance is intriguing.
I:325;172;I have watched it six times and still enjoy the movie.
I:325;173;Denzel Washington was awesome in that movie and it had a great story line that flowed smoothly.
I:325;174;Great commentary by director and Dakota Fanning.
I:325;175;The deleted scenes and alternate ending also help make this edition very memorable.
I:325;176;This is one of the few movies out nowadays that keeps you thinking about it.
I:325;177;Denzel Washington puts on easily his best acting yet.
I:325;178;He's always been a phenominal actor but this movie puts him on an all new plateau.
I:325;179;Marc Anthony, surprisingly, pulls off his role excellent.
I:325;180;His portrayal of a father battling his inner demons is right on.
I:325;181;Dakota Fanning was casted perfectly in my opinion.
I:325;182;Christopher Walken steals every scene he's in.
I:325;183;As always, he's suave and injects a bit of humor in at the appropriate times.
I:325;184;It doesn't seem safe in the least but this accusation is backed up towards the middle of the movie.
I:325;185;While protecting Pita, Creasy is shot twice and put in the hospital.
I:325;186;What happens when he leaves the hospital to revenge the kidnapping is shear brilliance.
I:325;187;His take no prisoner style is very admirable.
I:325;188;the camera work featured in this is amazing.
I:325;189;It's very raw and portrays the feeling of the film perfectly.
I:325;190;Tony Scott did an excellent job in every aspect of this movie.
I:325;191;Kudos should also be given to the special effects people.
I:325;192;Without compromising any of the film's integrity, they capture the brutality of the killings, and everything in between, very well.
I:325;193;overall this is definitely a movie worth seeing at least once.
I:325;194;The overall message is very good, and features some of the best acting in recent memory.
I:325;195;Everyone in this movie is worthy of being included and brought their 'A' game.
I:325;196;This also has a great ending, while never answering the odvious question that you're left asking.
I:325;197;With great acting and a plot to die for, you can't go wrong.
I:325;198;An alcoholic, special forces soldier of fortune finds redemption as a body guard for a wealthy Mexican family.
I:325;199;the movie score is particularly good.
I:325;200;Man On Fire will keep your attention for sure.
I:325;201;If you like a real good kick.
I:325;202;axx movie, this is it.
I:325;203;Man on Fire is an entertaining action flick starring Denzel Washington in the lead role as John Creasy.
I:325;204;this movie offers some good suspense and a plot that is less predictable than other films, making it more entertaining to watch.
I:325;205;denzel Washington is the main star of this film and his performance is excellent, like always.
I:325;206;He is tough, mostly cool, and most certainly a seeker of justice who shows no remorse for hurting someone who he feels deserves it.
I:325;207;man on Fire is worth a look, and it will appeal mostly to those who like suspenseful drama.
I:325;208;But this movie is a good one with an unpredictable plot that keeps you guessing all the way to the end.
I:325;209;first of all, I just have to say that this is an amazing movie.
I:325;210;Both Denzel and Dakota give stunning performances, along with everyone else in the movie.
I:325;211;this movie is, at times, very stylized, and the use of stylized subtitles is a little bit odd.
I:325;212;But the subtitles and the stylized camera angles make a very unique universe unlike anything I've ever experienced before.
I:325;213;It's intense and emotional, but never happy.
I:325;214;That being said, this movie is an extremely unique and affecting thriller that I would recommend to anyone reading this.
I:325;215;Maybe not in a smiling way, but it is definitely a great flick of 2004, with Denzel Washington in lead character.
I:325;216;The movie has alot of appeal for many reasons: Denzel's character is easily relatable for many people out there because he does have trouble communicating with others, and prefers to be alone.
I:325;217;Dakota Fanning is one heck of an actress, and she is going to the top!!
I:325;218;I've never scene such a great performance from any kid.
I:325;219;She really makes you love her, and that is good acting.
I:325;220;She is a born star and I can't wait to see her in more touching roles like this one!
I:325;221;He is just such an enjoyable actor with great chemistry in the film, and it really showed!
I:325;222;The movie is violent in the second half, but it does have a message about love, and how powerful it is.
I:325;223;It made him love that girl and that's what made it fun in the second half, after he believed she was dead, he decided to take out his revenge.
I:325;224;The film is filled with top.
I:325;225;notch acting(excluding Marc Anthony), an explosive and entertaining second half, and a just plainly happy first half.
I:325;226;Denzel and Dakota have great chemistry in their scenes and it really works!!
I:325;227;Though some parts might be a little cheesy, for the most part, it's realistic and entertaining!
I:325;228;Dakota Fanning is so talented.
I:325;229;This is such a great movie!
I:325;230;It's a bit slow in the beginning but it plays out right and is well worth it.
I:325;231;This is one of the best stories of redemption and salvation ever put on film.
I:325;232;The simple beauty of the bond between a vulnerable little girl and her protector is set against the backdrop of an ugly world of danger and treachery.
I:325;233;solving yarn and stellar performances from a great cast while you find out.
I:325;234;But if you can handle the violence, it is such a great movie.
I:325;235;It's so sad, and yet so beautifully done.
I:325;236;by the way, the use of the subtitles are a whole nother reason to love this movie.
I:325;237;This isn't the first bodyguard movie, but it is certainly a good one.
I:325;238;Denzel Washington is great playing a moody ex.
I:325;239;Pita played by Dakota Fanning is wonderful as that little girl.
I:325;240;Denzel teaches her how to win in a swimming competition and she changes his life.
I:325;241;Lots of character development here with some intense action especially three quarters of the way into the movie.
I:325;242;All the support cast is excellent and the side stories of their lifes added to the overall entertainment.
I:325;243;I was surprised to see the dedication to the main character at the end.
I:325;244;This movie is gritty and sometimes hard and bloody.
I:325;245;One of my favorite movies.
I:325;246;For one this is based on a true story that happened very recently.
I:325;247;She shows him that life is worth living and she gets kidnapped and he couldn't stop it.
I:325;248;Extremely moving and a intense film.
I:325;249;A taste of what the real world is like outside of America.
I:325;250;He is is going to be a brave dog, protective.
I:325;251;That is how much I love this man's character in this movie.
I:325;252;but this movie deserves 5 stars and always have.
I:325;253;denzel and his young female counterparts were believable.
I:325;254;this movie is simply Denzel at his very best.
I:325;255;I'd admire the character of this Creasy.
I:325;256;He has a dark soul and is fallible but is a man of his word.
I:325;257;I'd admire a man who takes matters into his own hands when it comes to protecting children and uncovering corruption.
I:325;258;its in my top 5 of all favorite movies and I can watch it again and again .
I:325;259;heart wrenching but entirely appropriate.
I:325;260;Its the modern day version of a Clint Eastwood movie.
I:325;261;"This movie ""sets up the premise"" with tender loving care that's absolutely necessary for the execution, almost as if each half (before and after the turning point) is a movie unto itself."
I:325;262;Rather, the mayhem and emotional motivation behind it mirror one another in their passion, and the reflection is brutally effective.
I:325;263;"most importantly, this is a very ""crafty"" movie."
I:325;264;"It's a rare moment that the camera ""sits still"" and just lets the picture happen."
I:325;265;And most the cast does their job without any attempt to steal the show.
I:325;266;Pita is gifted with both sweet innocence but also a worldly understated wisdom, and Fanning nails it believably and endearingly.
I:325;267;But she shines so brightly that her spirit hovers over long after she's left the narrative, and entirely provides the emotional lynchpin of the movie.
I:325;268;I loved eveything about this film.
I:325;269;Tony Scott did an amazing job.
I:325;270;Dakota Fanning was brilliant, and supported Denzel wonderfully.
I:325;271;The mother and the father were both excellent, and of course Christopher Walken did his usual intense preformance.
I:325;272;I recommend this to all movie lovers.
I:325;273;Especially the ones who appreciate the small details that a make a movie great.
I:325;274;I was really into it, and I is pretty much a true story.
I:325;275;I liked this movie soo much, and even if you are someone who hates blood and gore this movie just totally tops it.
I:325;276;It has friendship, sadness, scaryness, and reality.
I:325;277;I felt very taut and anxious throughout this film which is a great thing .
I:325;278;I actually cared about the characters.
I:325;279;Denzel Washington delivers what I personally feel is the most challenging and best role of his career.
I:325;280;She is really something special.
I:325;281;Great music, gorgeous blending, the sound effects and dialogue seem to work together almost like a symphony.
I:325;282;Man on Fire is far more complex, and the layering is what makes it so astounding.
I:325;283;"There is love, spirituality, whimsy, but it is all counterbalanced by violence, apathy, vengeance
I:325;284;It's not necessarily the most uplifting message, but it's the truth.
I:325;285;There is always chaos but when it finally explodes, there is the most powerful calm.
I:325;286;All three of those I've listed above are some of my favorite action movies, but Scott's latest, Man On Fire, is better than all of them.
I:325;287;Once again, Washington is perfect.
I:325;288;He does it again here, making Creasy a sympathetic character, even when he's cutting off people's fingers.
I:325;289;She comes off with just as much charm as she did in I Am Sam.
I:325;290;scott does some intense camera work throughout the movie, and though it's hardly anything innovative, it keeps things tense.
I:325;291;Best movie I've ever seen.
I:325;292;I give it one star for the chemistry between Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning.
I:325;293;Only a Denzel starved fan will find anything to enjoy in this film.
I:325;294;There are much better Denzel Washington movies.
I:325;295;There are better movies about grown men realizing the motivation in how much they love a sweet, little girl (try Evelyn, with Pierce Brosnan).
I:325;296;Washington is good, not great.
I:325;297;The editing and subtitles are original and make it fun to watch.
I:325;298;Along with being a Denzel Washington movie fan, Dakota Fanning was so charming and beyond her years in this movie.
I:325;299;The caring and friendship that develops is so touching.
I:325;300;Movie had a good ending that is not expected until the end of the movie is near.
I:325;301;If you like brutal action scenes and the good guy winning in the end, you will enjoy this movie.
I:325;302;A classic story of revenge and sacrifice.
I:325;303;That said, Scott's direction is stylish and beautiful and visually interesting.
I:325;304;After numerous attempts, Pita finally got John to open up to her and he appeared to be reclaiming his soul.
I:325;305;It's definately worth checking out.
I:325;306;It is dark, challenging and the performances are great.
I:325;307;Denzel slowly warms to her personality and finds a new purpose in life behind her.
I:325;308;denzel, once again, proves that he is one of, if not THE finest actor in hollywood.
I:325;309;In MAN ON FIRE, he takes on 3 personalities and he flawlessly transforms from one to the next with ultimate believability.
I:325;310;everything about the movie is entertaining and engrossing.
I:325;311;It deserved 4 stars, and if I hadn't gotten frustrated at numerous scenes throughout, I would have given it 4 stars.
I:325;312;This gives him a new purpose and happiness in his life.
I:325;313;But this movie is elevated by several intriguing plot twists, including a major one involving Pita's father, Samuel.
I:325;314;First of all the script is very well written and the characters are emotionally involving.
I:325;315;The plot is relatively believable and high energy.
I:325;316;Finally, the cinematography is creative and provocative in its portrayal of Mexico and its brutal criminal underworld.
I:325;317;But most people will enjoy its mix of action, intelligence and emotional depth.
I:325;318;This is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:325;319;The intensity will keep you on the edge of your chair as well as make you cry.
I:325;320;This is a must see if you are into dramas
I:325;321;i am getting fed up with this so please straighten out my account, so I can be a satisfied customer again.
I:325;322;One thing I liked about his films were the story line.
I:325;323;I loved the start of the movie, Fanning @ Washington were great together!
I:325;324;Anyone who knows me would be shocked to know that I loved this movie!
I:325;325;Now its not my favorite film of his but it's one of his greatest performance!!
I:325;326;So with that said I give my favorite actor 5 solid stars!!
I:325;327;I loved it in every way.
I:325;328;it was captivating from start to its inevitable bittersweet finish and I applaud all performances.
I:325;329;if you are a lover of action movies that don't pull punches, see this masterpiece.
I:325;330;A happy bunny movie it's not, but it subtely gets you to care about these characters and what happens to them.
I:325;331;The ending was also satisfying, but it was a journey to get there.
I:325;332;"Washington is awesome, should have been put up for a nomination, though I suppose it's in the same vein as ""Training Day"", but this performance is more subtle."
I:325;333;Also, the little girl is very good.
I:325;334;"We always enjoy Tony Scott's movies (""True Romance"" being an old fave), and he did a great job with this movie."
I:325;335;Edgy and interesting and in the end, very satisfying.
I:325;336;I liked the random subtitles, even when they weren't necessary!
I:325;337;One of the best action movies in my opinion.
I:325;338;Denzel Washington is immense in this movie as the ex.
I:325;339;military special forces soldier who hard heart is melted and he finds redemption as the bodyguard for a young American girl who is kidnapped in Mexico.
I:325;340;A must see movie for me with Dakota Fanning as the little girl who wins Greasy Bear's affection.
I:325;341;there is one great line.
I:325;342;"the kind that real people never say: ""His art is killing and he's about to paint his masterpiece!"""
I:325;343;He adroitly also weaves an emotional story of human relationships in his tale which succeeds in resurrecting the life of a down and out Denzel Washington.
I:325;344;Gradually Fanning wears down Washington's resistance and they forge a very solid and caring relationship.
I:325;345;In a remorseless reign of terror Washington pulls out all stops to find the young girl.
I:325;346;Personal fave Giancarlo Giannini of Lina Wertmuller fame makes a welcome appearance in the movie as a local law enforcement official.
I:325;347;It's very impressive and made me elevate this film from four to five stars.
I:325;348;I liked it, but a number of people found it too frenetic for their tastes as the camera.
I:325;349;I thought it fit the tense storyline and was fascinating to view, and, as mentioned, looks spectacular on Blu.
I:325;350;besides the two stars, there is the always.
I:325;351;key role, and a number of other fine actors.
I:325;352;The film panders to the base emotions in all of us, but it works.
I:325;353;He is a hardened man who takes a job protecting a lovely child due to an enormous rash of child kidnappings in the area.
I:325;354;But I can say the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with the action, explosions and yes, there is some rough scenes but overall this is an excellent movie.
I:325;355;Granted, it can be a bit slow at the beginning but you are definitely in for a treat.
I:325;356;I can truly say this is one of the best films I have seen Denzel in.
I:325;357;I'm going to do what I do best.
I:325;358;creasy's passion is due to the kidnapping of a young girl he was guarding, Pita.
I:325;359;Her presence in his life has transformed this one.
I:325;360;the story is thrilling and from the begining has a high level of suspense.
I:325;361;in the midst of the violence is redemption for Creasy and salvation for others.
I:325;362;The subject of this movie is disturbing but it is very well done I think.
I:325;363;The supporting characters are all played well, and Washington offers a very convincing performance.
I:325;364;If you like action, watch this one.
I:325;365;Loved the movie, thought it might be based on a true story, the way it ended, had to do research on it.
I:325;366;This is an excellent movie that has you hooked from the first few minutes of the movie.
I:325;367;and it gets better and better.
I:325;368;You fall in love with Denzel's sweet, protective side and totally overlook the past and what it takes to exact justice.
I:325;369;As a decades long fan, this still rates as one of my top 10 movies of all time.
I:325;370;Denzel as Creasy Bear was much more sinister and sympathetic a character than the slime ball he played in Training Day.
I:325;371;Dakota Fanning is well overdue for an oscar nomination.
I:325;372;She is extremly gifted and this movie showcases that.
I:325;373;I just watched this last night for the second time since my wife had yet to see it and I was stunned for the second time at how well she carries herself in a film.
I:325;374;His best friend Roy (Walken, who is great as usual) finds him a job as a bodyguard for young Pita (Fanning).
I:325;375;This film is intense, dramatic and one edge of your seat ride that is thuroughly enjoyable.
I:325;376;packed movie, Denzel Washington stars as an ex.
I:325;377;cIA/assassin who's latest gig is bodyguard to the rich.
I:325;378;Most notable statement in the movie is delivered by costar Christopher Walken.
I:325;379;jerker with something for everyone.
I:325;380;old girl, a little bit of light begins to shine in his life.
I:325;381;Kidnappers are determined to us the girl to gain a ransom.
I:325;382;denzel Washington is a fantastic actor, and in this movie he once again proves how good he is.
I:325;383;He had to do a lot of non.
I:325;384;happiness, and genuine fear of where he may be heading in his life, over and over again.
I:325;385;i enjoyed the entire cast in this movie, and I believe Brian Helgeland did an excellent job on the screenplay.
I:325;386;The film flows really well, reminding me of a documentary .
I:325;387;director Tony Scott is amazing at what he does.
I:325;388;She has a great future in Hollywood .
I:325;389;all in all, this movie delivers what any good movie should .
I:325;390;a good plot, excellent acting, great visuals and one.
I:325;391;liners, and characters you begin to care about.
I:325;392;All his movies are great because this man can really act!
I:325;393;In this role he did a fabulous job.
I:325;394;She also did a good job, when the movie was done I wanted to watch it all over again.
I:325;395;I loved the song Blues Bayou.
I:325;396;Anyway I didn't have the highest expectations of it, but I was thoroughly surprised and impressed after watching it at home one evening.
I:325;397;If you have a nice home theater setup, you'll really appreciate the serene music and sound design of this movie.
I:325;398;I really enjoyed the tone of the film and thought it was paced perfectly.
I:325;399;well, it is and stands well alongside his other action movies.
I:325;400;always, always like to see christopher walken.
I:325;401;time favorite Denzel Washington film!
I:325;402;Christopher Walken was excellent too.
I:325;403;Denzel Washington is a very good actor and I enjoyed the movie, even though the setting and some content was changed from the book.
I:325;404;In my opinion Man On Fire Is his best work and the girl almost stole it from him.
I:325;405;"Not only a great movie based on a ""True story"" but also some great cinematography."
I:325;406;Something you see a little more of lately but has a very good action feel to it.
I:325;407;Not only was the story and acting excellent, but the soundtrack was also perfectly in sync with the movie.
I:325;408;Dakota Fanning also did a great job and helped make the movie much more appealing and human.
I:325;409;Yes this is not the original that was filmed back in 1987 but I feel its a great improvement and more realistic than the original.
I:325;410;On the flip side, this film is so well crafted and entertaining that ultimately you just dimiss such concerns and say it's only a movie.
I:325;411;"Director Tony Scott surehandedly directs this film from a script by Brian Helgeland(""L. a. Confidential"")."
I:325;412;The film's best moments come at the beginning as the relationship unfolds between ex.
I:325;413;Washington also does a good job at showing a man whose demons are enveloping him.
I:325;414;There is a strong supporting cast here with Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, and Giancarlo Giannini.
I:325;415;"She can be seen in fine form as J. m. Barrie's wife in the recently released ""Finding Neverland""."
I:325;416;Raw and unflinching, it's a gripping story of revenge that doesn't pull any punches .
I:325;417;anchored by an electrifying performance from Denzel Washington.
I:325;418;is particularly hyperactive here, pummeling us with rapid cuts and various other Oliver Stone.
I:325;419;But Scott's short attention span serves the story well, giving the film a slightly off.
I:325;420;kilter feel (and effectively mirroring Washington's character's state of mind).
I:325;421;top directorial decisions (if at all).
I:325;422;Brian Helgeland's screenplay allows for an unusual amount of character development .
I:325;423;which gives us ample time to watch the two characters interact with each other.
I:325;424;a. mission is completely believable.
I:325;425;mindedness of Washington's character propels the story forward, even though the plot essentially vanishes somewhere around the one.
I:325;426;There's some stuff about police corruption and a journalist that provides Creasy with info, but really, the film devotes itself to Creasy's quest.
I:325;427;It's a film that will likely turn off a lot of viewers .
I:325;428;primarily because of Scott's direction and the unforgiving nature of the story .
I:325;429;but for those willing to stick with it, Man on Fire is one of the more intelligent and compelling thrillers to come around in a while.4.5 outta' 5.
I:325;430;This is my favorite movie.
I:325;431;Very few actors possess the talent to make a successful revenge movie.
I:325;432;Only a great one can pull it off.
I:325;433;There are few surprises and one can easily predict what will happen in the next scene.
I:325;434;She is adorable, innocent, and all that other mushy stuff.
I:325;435;Abductions are an everyday event in this one step above a third world country.
I:325;436;do are constantly targeted, and Pita's family will be no exception.
I:325;437;Denzel Washington should be considered for an Academy Award for his performance, but this type of a artistry rarely garners such respect and adulation from the Hollywood community.
I:325;438;Fast shipping/great price and excellent packaging.
I:325;439;I gave it 5 stars due Dakota's and Denzel's outstanding performances.
I:325;440;Their ability to speak Spanish so naturally was a plus!
I:325;441;I beg you please, PLEASE keep a bucket of water, super.
I:325;442;with the foot soldiers then working his way up to the underboss (#2 man at the top) .
I:325;443;"It is most satisfying
I:325;444;the location switch from Italy to Mexico works well.
I:325;445;"And as is inevitable with a major studio production, the ending has been ""Hollywood."
I:325;446;However, Denzel Washington does an excellent job portraying the character Creasy, absolutely nailing the character.
I:325;447;Christopher Walken, always a good choice, was an excellent casting choice here.
I:325;448;It's one of the best action.
I:325;449;thriller films in the year.
I:325;450;It has a little gory split, but still the plot is the most important thing.
I:325;451;I wanted to see him involved in a good role and a good plot.
I:325;452;But now I see he is a genius.
I:325;453;He shows all features in this film: cold, warm, impassible, tender, mischevious, struggler.
I:325;454;good words are also for the director, the writer and the director of photography.
I:325;455;I think they have gathered together in a very interesting group.
I:325;456;The story is fantastic and localizations are very close to reality.
I:325;457;I was impressed also for the correct performance of the best.
I:325;458;I'm very little confident in every singer who makes a film (remember Madonna?)
I:325;459;"In my previous reviews I have mentioned the good performances of girls in ""Jersey Girl"" and ""In America""."
I:325;460;She is lovely, charming and delicious.
I:325;461;"i liked the story, some parts are memorable, as everybody is saying: ""a bullet always tells the truth""."
I:325;462;Denzel Washington is great and Christopher Walken goes beyond his regular Walken characters with some great lines.
I:325;463;It has the components that make a great action movie.
I:325;464;This will probably take its place among my favorite Denzel Washington films.
I:325;465;While it is highly stylized in shooting style, the story and relationship between him and the little girl and his redemption made this an above average thriller.
I:325;466;Dakota and Denzel are outstanding, and this film is a nailbaiting rollercoaster ride to the end.
I:325;467;I really thought the acting made the story come to life in how the actors brought their relationships into the plot.
I:325;468;Classic novel , well directed.
I:325;469;I would have like to see it move a bit faster in the beginning but over all , well done.
I:325;470;He struggles with God and agonizes over his past.
I:325;471;Rayburn encourages Creasy to take a job in Mexico City.
I:325;472;The difference is that despite what Creasy is capable of, he is still likeable.
I:325;473;walken, although his role is limited, is also superb.
I:325;474;Unlike some of his recent roles, his performance in this film is comprehenisble and first rate.
I:325;475;Fans of revenge flicks will probably enjoy this film.
I:325;476;I love this movie and would gladly share it with anyone willing to watch.
I:325;477;A very moving and inspirational film.
I:325;478;"Any movie headlined by Denzel Washington translates into an instant spellbinder
I:325;479;Yet the gritty, malevolent, gratuitous violence of this film transcends Washington's powerful acting.
I:325;480;held sequences. . . compelling cinematography so dominant it eventally interferes with the story itself.
I:325;481;he even recalls a delightful story about his bodyguard getting beaten up by gangbangers during a late.
I:325;482;I knew i had to have it.
I:325;483;One of my all time favorites.
I:325;484;Dw is the very best actors of our time.
I:325;485;This is a must see.
I:325;486;I think Denzel is among the best there is today.
I:325;487;Man on Fire is another of those great performances so often overlooked by the Academy.
I:325;488;He has an approach that is understated, cool, and competent.
I:325;489;Denzel is class, a hero even when a drunkard, soft.
I:325;490;rated actor of our time, why.
I:325;491;This role is one of the most challenging of his career because of the range of emotions Denzel must show.
I:325;492;Of course, there is the action, and this like most of his movies does make you feel involved, even in the shootings.
I:325;493;This movie will remind you of one of the main reasons we love the movies, the total immersion in a character, a plot, interesting people, villains, and a real hero, one of the greats, Mr. Denzel Washington.
I:325;494;It is an excellent movie.
I:325;495;Donna ColeThe Young Lions and Folks are both excellent.
I:325;496;Denzel Washington is one of the greatest actors around.
I:325;497;And Dakota Fanning is absoultely amazing.
I:325;498;the script just has you on the edge of your seat the entire time.
I:325;499;With alot of surprises and suspense.
I:325;500;very enjoyable, one of the best movies this year.
I:325;501;Denzel Washington is at his angry best in Man on Fire.
I:325;502;This is an excellent thriller with a difference, being set in Mexico City and based on fact: good plot and acting with plenty of action.
I:325;503;But I think on the whole it works.
I:325;504;Denzel is brilliant as the isolated, desocialized bodyguard.
I:325;505;His transformation to a more caring human being, while predictable, is well played.
I:325;506;Still, a decent film energetically shot by the lesser known Scott brother.
I:325;507;This screen adaptation of the A. j. Quinnell novel has received mixed reviews, but I found it remained generally true to the spirit of the book.
I:325;508;A kidnapping spree has spread throughout Latin America and a wealthy young couple hires Creasy to protect their young daughter.
I:325;509;i rated this film four stars.
I:325;510;exposures, and other tricks of the trade.
I:325;511;telling mode, he does his best work, as Fanning and Washington are nearly perfect in their roles.
I:325;512;Nothing matches the entire Creasy series.
I:325;513;this was a pretty enthralling and watchable film, although it started hitting some speed bumps after the first hour.
I:325;514;I really enjoyed the story up until about 50 minutes into the film, when a major event happens (I won't reveal).
I:325;515;Dakota plays Pita, and gives quite a memorable performance for a young actress.
I:325;516;Even J. Lo's Marc Anthony (as Pita's father) gives a good performance but ends up shooting himself because of how being married to J. Lo this long has boggled his mind!
I:325;517;needless to say, Creasy goes on a relentless tear of vengence in the second half of the film, and I like it because there is a real emotional cause behind it unlike a lot of action movies.
I:325;518;You know there is a point to all the violence and something drastic will emerge at the ending.
I:325;519;"Denzel is more than smooth and believable on his rampage (similar to his ""Training Day"" invulnerabity)."
I:325;520;There are a couple twists in the plot, and a heartfelt ending.
I:325;521;Man On Fire has a pretty fresh plot, an excellent performance from the lead (what else could you expect from Denzel?)
I:325;522;This aside, you have a solid movie, that I think of more highly now than when I was actually watching it.
I:325;523;Denzel fans, drama fans, action fans, (even violence fans) check this one out!
I:325;524;I thought the character interaction between the bodyguard and the little girl was excellent and the ending was very powerful.
I:325;525;I have seen this movie before and it is very good.
I:325;526;If you are a sensitive viewer stay away!!!
I:325;527;This movie will haunt you.
I:325;528;I was pleased with the outcome.
I:325;529;packed, always interesting, and greatly acted.
I:325;530;The film stars Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken, Dakota Fanning, and Radha Mitchell.
I:325;531;But it is much more than that.
I:325;532;"At a running time of 146 minutes, ""Man on Fire"" is an epic look into what a man would do to save another person."
I:325;533;Man on Fire is not a great film, but it is very entertaining and includes some powerful preformances.
I:325;534;"I would see ""Man on Fire"" again, but I don't recommend it to all."
I:325;535;Otherwise, this was a really good film.
I:325;536;It is exciting from start to an unexpected finish.
I:325;537;I would recommend this to anyone that likes a edge of the chair type of story.
I:325;538;This was an awesome movie with excellent acting (mostly).
I:325;539;Denzel Washington was awesome and was pretty much the whole movie, but I felt Christopher Walken was underused here.
I:325;540;She is such a good actress, and is so young.
I:325;541;At first Creasy is very serious and unsocial, but then begins to care for the girl.
I:325;542;Denzel Washington is excellent (wow is there an echo).
I:325;543;This is one of the best action movies I have ever seen.
I:325;544;Man on Fire have good actors (Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Christopher Walken, Radha Mitchell and Marc Anthony.
I:325;545;it also has good lines.
I:325;546;"Creasy: ""Revenge is a meal best served cold."""
I:325;547;If you like this movie I also recommend The Keeper (Steven Seagal) and Taken (Liam Neeson).
I:325;548;The action sequences are thrilling and held my attention.
I:325;549;overall, a very entertaining movie and well worth the two hour investment.
I:325;550;Although he finds both the job and Fanning onerous to be around at first, he eventually develops a bond with the young girl, whose talents involve swimming and playing the piano.
I:325;551;And yet, what makes MAN ON FIRE work as well as it does is that bond that develops between Washington and Fanning early on.
I:325;552;Veteran actress Rachel Ticotin gives a good supporting performance as a Mexican newspaper reporter who assists Washington in finding the members of La Hermanidad, which she has been trying to expose for years.
I:325;553;Walken also gives a good turn as his former partner who tells Mexican officials why he is relentless in going after Fanning's kidnappers.
I:325;554;She taught him what it was like to live again.
I:325;555;Definitely not for everyone (it is a rather violent film, and the editing and camera work could give people headaches), MAN ON FIRE is nevertheless a very worthy film, better than most revenge and kidnapping films of the last several years.
I:325;556;It is a good movie, fast, lots of action and since it is made in Mexico makes it even more real.
I:325;557;The acting is good, but it would better if we could bring back Charles Bronson to play the lead.
I:325;558;"Denzel creates an unforgettable character in ""Man on Fire."""
I:325;559;It is very fun to watch his neromous facial expressions on the screen.
I:325;560;"I remember saying, ""Man hes good!"""
I:325;561;"After watching ""Monster"" with charlize theron in her Oscar winning performance, you beleived in the character, like the camera wasn't even there."
I:325;562;This is now one of my top 10 movies of all time now.
I:325;563;Go see this great movie and be sure to tell all your friends about it!!!!!!!!!!
I:325;564;"But as ""Man on fire'"" progressed and Creasy kept it strictly professional, I relaxed and let suspense in through the back door."
I:325;565;Creasy lends a sad and fresh twist to its conclusion, because Hollywood's heroes save lives more and die less.
I:325;566;Tony Scott is a genius.
I:325;567;He makes the movie just as good as the theatrical trailer for the movie.
I:325;568;Great storyline, good acting, great action and really well edited.
I:325;569;Altogether this was one heck of a great movie!!!
I:325;570;This is a great movie in a year of very good movies.
I:325;571;Revenge is great, as long as you do it right.
I:325;572;Just see it, and you won't be disappointed.
I:325;573;I bet Rachel Ticotin waited all her life for this role, and she deserves it.
I:325;574;it jerked a few tears too!
I:325;575;Anyone that appreciates the range of Denzel.
I:325;576;he even made Marc Anthony look good!!!
I:325;577;Its one of the best movies I've watched.
I:325;578;Number one in the world actually and so the movie is based on that.
I:325;579;Just a quick note to say that I love this movie.
I:325;580;dakota really held her own against Denzel.
I:325;581;Studios are moaning about the downturn in box office and then make a film that nobody can look at when they actually venture into the cinema.
I:325;582;mentioned box office and really wants to punish us this time.
I:325;583;It is really creepy.You have got to admire the sheer chutzpuh of the tribute to Mexico City tacked on at the end of this movie.
I:325;584;I thought it was a very good movie.
I:325;585;I liked the way it was put together really well.
I:325;586;It was quite a good movie, but not for the squeamish.
I:325;587;The first part introduced the family, Washington and his contacts, the city and the Mexican environment where all of this took place.
I:325;588;This first part was rather charming and low keyed.
I:325;589;the movie is well acted and directed.
I:325;590;I have seen Man on Fire a couple of times and I love Danzel Washington as an actor, and Dakota Fanning as an actress.
I:325;591;These two made a perfect duo.
I:325;592;The love of money has destroyed many lives, and to think that a human being can do that to another human being is tragic.
I:325;593;It was a great and moving movie how a man, so destroyed by his choices he has made in his life, can be reborn to love again by a child's love.
I:325;594;The other supporting actors in this film were wonderful as well.
I:325;595;I am bias because I attend the same school, but this is a great revenge piece, you never know what someone will care about.
I:325;596;His art is killing and he is about to paint his greatest masterpiece.
I:325;597;Being a long time fan of the main actor, i was totally shocked and awed in this movie.
I:325;598;So powerful and so true for our times.
I:325;599;A truly beautiful movie to watch, highly recommended.
I:325;600;I would highly recommend this film.
I:325;601;All of the actors did a great job in my opinion.
I:325;602;he helps her become better at swiming and the become friends.
I:325;603;and for those who don't figure it out it will be shocking.
I:325;604;good story, good action and great actors.
I:325;605;'Man On Fire' is hot, from start to finish.
I:325;606;and Tony Scott takes corruption de policia, surrogate families and the great American hero to the next level in this riviting crime drama.
I:325;607;phrases so don't worry, it strays far from that path with a gripping story, I don't know HOW this little girl learned to act so well, and if it does'nt ruin anything the movie is based on one out of a hundred true stories.
I:325;608;Very well done, with some unusual filming techniques, and certainly filled with action.
I:325;609;alignment with life ignited by interacting with a much younger soul.
I:325;610;terribly violent but fast paced and exciting.
I:325;611;A nice porthole in to life in Mexico City.
I:325;612;"i like ""The Professional"" but in ""Man on Fire"", you truly get to appreciate what a rare actor Denzel W. is."
I:325;613;the acting by the principals (and the supporting roles) is first rate.
I:325;614;The reason this story works so very well is the powerful, though slow, process of Creasy allowing himself to find spiritual redemption in the love of Pita, a child with more healing powers in her indomitable nature than a legion of nuns and priests.
I:325;615;This relationship as created by Washington and Fanning through Scott's cautious eye is one of the more beautiful definitions of 'friendship' ever filmed.
I:325;616;decided, then Washington and Fanning are definitely candidates.
I:325;617;A very fine film that leaves you drained.
I:325;618;Denzel at his best and a heart.
I:325;619;warming story to top it off.
I:325;620;In a matter of hours he's found the killers and the manipulators.
I:325;621;He's the judge and executioner.
I:325;622;so, what are the prospects of sparks between the mom, played by Radha Mitchell, and Washington?
I:325;623;and he once told Will Smith to NEVER kiss a man on the silver screen.
I:325;624;She has wisdom of a 50.
I:325;625;It's a great film for 20.
I:325;626;see the movie for yourself.
I:325;627;splendid,great story,great actor,just love it,worthwile your expectations.
I:325;628;try ityou'll be pleasedas they say in the movie:Denzel Washingon did his masterpiece
I:325;629;Suspense beyond and WOW actually has the best acting I have seen in ages.
I:325;630;Denzel and Dakota are awesome.
I:325;631;This movie is absolutely brilliant, led By Denzel Washington in a powerful performance.
I:325;632;He is to protect young Pita, played beautifully by Dakota Fanning.
I:325;633;The movie is so powerful and sweet though thanks to the first half of the movie.
I:325;634;They are now best friends, and now Creasy is no longer an alcoholic thanks to his great friendship with Pita.
I:325;635;He gets some big guns and declares that he will kill everyone that was involved with the kidnapping.
I:325;636;Creasy is determined to show no mercy.
I:325;637;This movie is very powerful and emotional.
I:325;638;Washington and Fanning are both very powerful and the movie is built around them and their bond until the kidnapping.
I:325;639;I strongly recommend this very powerful and wonderful film.
I:325;640;Tony Scott at last signed his name in the great list of the film noir titles with this work .
I:325;641;washington is superb in this role .
I:325;642;Nevertheless the script is so well made that it is still a punch thriller .
I:325;643;Bravo for Mr. Scott who finally faced the challenge with this mature work .
I:325;644;Nevertheless this film is by far more ambitious and pyramidal .
I:325;645;It was a pretty entertaining movie, especially thanks to Denzel Washington.
I:325;646;old girl who lives in Mexico City, and he can be thoughtful during the softer moments of the movie, and rough during the more violent moments.
I:325;647;This is a good movie to see if you're into intense action scenes.
I:325;648;even though the special effects of the movie should have been edited out, much of the rest of the movie shines.
I:325;649;It was such a thrilling movie.
I:325;650;Everything about it was great.
I:325;651;No wonder I added it to my growing movie collection.
I:325;652;"And without anyunnecessary ""love interest""."
I:325;653;"The scene with ""Fuentes"" (the Mexican chief of the brotherhood) is alsovery good, even funny in a sick sort of way."
I:325;654;"the script is perfect, just following Poe's ""rule"" of ""not one word in vain""."
I:325;655;A good story can make or break a movie, no better proofthan this one!
I:325;656;Notice the importance of religion: Casey'sknowledge by heart of the Bible, and even Samuel's plush sanctuary athis home, full of candles, obviously built for bargaining with theGuadalupana Virgin.
I:325;657;the fight at the shanty town isVERY real.
I:325;658;"Characters: Casey, a ""philosophical copper"" who can learn to feel sorry for somethingexternal to himself steals the movie, the rest of characters are justfilling up space, making things happen."
I:325;659;Such gift for acting is rarely seen.
I:325;660;director:Judging from his filmography, this is definitely Tony Scott's Masterpiece!
I:325;661;It's hardto believe somebody who made films from Spy Game downwards couldachieve something really well done but it's good to remain open minded.
I:325;662;photography is just the best, finding beauty where there is none.
I:325;663;In fact I just saw it for the third time on air TV, dubbed into Spanish, and I also felt for Casey, so I guess this proves what a good product it is.
I:325;664;Denzel Washington's understated but absolutely honest portrayl of a CIA agent at the end of his rope is riveting.
I:325;665;He is so subtle at times that you may miss his impact.
I:325;666;Creasey redeems himself in the end and 'goes home'.
I:325;667;Watch this movie carefully and more than once.
I:325;668;The other actors were okay, but Washington and Fanning ran the show and made this movie feel explosive, keeping me intrigued from beginning to end.
I:325;669;This was my absolute favorite movie of all time.
I:325;670;My issue is with textbooksrus.
I:325;671;Probably one of his best movies ever.
I:325;672;i love good ol' revenge movies and this one was a great one.
I:325;673;dakota fanning and denzel washington pretty much made this movie what it was.
I:325;674;the first half of the movie is basically the developement of this relationship, but when the sh*t hits the fan, it really hits the fan hard.
I:325;675;it was quite refreshing to see such violence for all of the right reasons.
I:325;676;"the line was spoken by christopher walken and said ""creasy's art is death and he is about to paint his masterpiece."""
I:325;677;they use a piece from a nine inch nails song that just really fit well.
I:325;678;the entire score was just perfect.
I:325;679;overall, great movie, i highly recommend to anyone who loves revenge thrillers
I:325;680;It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie.
I:325;681;If you like action with an emotional play, then this is a must see.
I:325;682;Denzel great, and Christopher Walker has an under stated supporting role
I:325;683;Man on Fire is one of those rare movies that takes you deep into the characters and their inner beings.
I:325;684;Denzel shows a stunning performance as John W. Creasy, a heavy drinker in need of employment.
I:325;685;"The bond he has with ""Pita"", Dakota Fanning's character is almost magical."
I:325;686;It's hard to talk about the movie without giving it away, but all I can say is, it's the best action movie I've seen in a long while.
I:325;687;There are subtitles throughout even when the characters are speaking English.
I:325;688;But, even that concept was quite fascinating.
I:325;689;1 / The direction and production of this film are absolutely perfect , especially the photography system which was very spectacualr and interesting .
I:325;690;The confusion of the camera makes the viewer completely wrapped up in the events .
I:325;691;Mr. Washington was great as usual .
I:325;692;Dakota Fanning is amazingly wonderful in this movie .
I:325;693;In my opinion , she is the main cause of the success of Man On Fire .
I:325;694;she played her role fantastically and I couldn't find any negativisms of her acting at all .
I:325;695;MAN ON FIRE is a 2004 American thriller film and the second adaptation of A. J. Quinnell's 1980 first of five Creasy novels.
I:325;696;At first Creasy distances himself from the young girl, but the two soon develop a friendship.
I:325;697;at the time of the first film, Italy was the major center of kidnapping in the world.
I:325;698;dakota Fanning was nominated for best young actress 2005 for a Critics Choice Award.
I:325;699;scott's adaption was very successful (cost $70 million to make.
I:325;700;a. J. Quinnell was very pleased with the 2004 film adaption for it used many of the quotes from his novel.
I:325;701;A man can be an artist .
I:325;702;He's about to paint his masterpiece.
I:325;703;He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals.
I:325;704;A bullet always tells the truth.
I:325;705;dIALOGUESamuel: Your resume is quite impressive.
I:325;706;I'm surprised anyone could afford you, what's the catch?Creasy: I drink.
I:325;707;Top professionals try to kidnap your daughter I'll do the best I can but the service will be on par with the pay.
I:325;708;and spent a pleasant 2 1/2 hours often standing up and cheering (those were some serious bad guys).
I:325;709;Again, Denzel Washington is absolutely fabulous with an excellent supporting cast.
I:325;710;The story line is intriguing and caught me completely off guard with the way the story played out.
I:325;711;John Creasy truly reclaimed his soul.
I:325;712;This movie was recommended to me and I enjoyed it.
I:325;713;I will watch it again sometime in the near future.
I:325;714;We just love to watch it is a very good movie!!!
I:325;715;Denzel Washington takes another otherwise average movie and bumps the entire picture up a notch with superb acting.
I:325;716;He is completely believable as John Creesy, an ex.
I:325;717;A movie that taps into the alter.
I:325;718;ego of a perpetually liked actor, maybe even one of the most favorite actors in Hollywood, is always a tempting and dangerous proposition.
I:325;719;i love the film,, but had trouble feeling any remorse for Creasy.
I:325;720;Nonethelss, this movie is superb, and highly recommended.
I:325;721;Go into the theatre prepared for an unusually captivating plot.
I:325;722;The cinematography provides part of the intrigue.
I:325;723;With brutality as a matter of fact, with courage and determination, Creasy allows us to become witness to muckraking and righteousness 21st century style.
I:325;724;He makes everyone around him better.
I:325;725;A remake of the 1987 movie, Denzel shines as a bodyguard to a wealthy family in mexico protecting their daughter.
I:325;726;If you are a fan of action and Denzel Washington this is a must own.
I:325;727;Great movie, one of Denzel's best.
I:325;728;Solid action and a great plot make this an excellent action/thriller movie that will keep you engaged the entire time.
I:325;729;A very entertaining movie with a disappointing ending.
I:325;730;The characters were very well developed and the action was almost non.
I:325;731;But Denzel and Dakota worked good together.
I:325;732;I bought this because Dakota Fanning is a very good actress.
I:325;733;This is a great movie.
I:325;734;Matter of fact, this is Tony's best work to date.
I:325;735;"the story is of a man, Creasy (Washington) who's kinda at the end of his ""career"", and probably at one time was the best, the most elite."
I:325;736;That's to do what he does best, and save the angel that found the good in him.
I:325;737;Denzel Washington showed real skill here, moving beyond the obvious talents that he was born.
I:325;738;He moved beyond any confort zone, beyond the cookie.
I:325;739;cutter image, and was very successful at it.
I:325;740;the movie was very moving, tragic, loving, and most of all very human, when we might be called 'at our best'.
I:325;741;I'll address the good points first.
I:325;742;Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning do a great job.
I:325;743;They build a great relationship.
I:325;744;The plot is simple, but proceeds with energy.
I:325;745;All the characters are drawn well.
I:325;746;The movie uses some symbolism and images very well to tie the plot together and to reveal Denzel's mental states.
I:325;747;The movie uses a variety of techniques with light and film speed.
I:325;748;Denzel Washington plays a terrific redemption role as bodyguard Creasy in this revenge thriller: Man on Fire.
I:325;749;the ending provides twists and turns but the strength of this film lies in its unabashed primary motive: revenge.
I:325;750;And it is dastardly, effective, and sweet.
I:325;751;This is one of all my all time favorite movies.
I:325;752;Denzel comes out with his best in this movie.
I:325;753;My husband loves the movie and was so happy to have his own copy of it and watch it whenever he wants to now.
I:325;754;I love this movie and love Denzel and Dakota in it together.
I:325;755;Denzel is great in this movie and packed with stars.
I:325;756;The acting is well done.
I:325;757;If you love a good vengeance film this is for you.
I:325;758;"A quote from Rayburn explains Creasy's mindset very well, ""Creasy's an artist of death, and he is about to paint his masterpiece."
I:325;759;"Man on Fire was a good movie but definitely wasn't a ""feel."
I:325;760;Still, one cannot help but be mesmerized by the cinematography and exciting storyline which reminds us, once again, that Mexico City is not a nice place.
I:325;761;Great premise, great storyline, and most importantly .
I:325;762;C'mon casting people, let's get with it.
I:325;763;On the positive side, it was great to see Denzel's character bond with the little girl over the span of the movie.
I:325;764;It's also nice to see Denzel start picking off badguy by badguy.
I:325;765;One of the greatest movies of all time.
I:325;766;He's about to paint his master.
I:325;767;She is kidnapped and he of course goes nuts and tracks down everyone who was involved.
I:325;768;the first hour is about Washington and Dakota's friendship and their scenes together are touching.
I:325;769;However I forgave it for that quick change because it's a very cool revenge movie and Washington does some of his best work.
I:325;770;The supporting cast is reall good too.
I:325;771;Christopher Walken is real good as Washington's good friend.
I:325;772;plus Dekota Flanning has really good scenes with Washington.
I:325;773;Giancarlo Giannini (Hannibal, Mimic) also does some good work as a cop who wants to help out Washington.
I:325;774;So yes it's really great cast but still even if Washington didn't have great back up he could've still heald it on his own.
I:325;775;He's just so good in this and yes I agree with Richard Roeper, maybe he even is better here than he was in Training Day.
I:325;776;Price was good, service was quick, product was as described, positive transaction!!
I:325;777;Denzel gives a powerful performance.
I:325;778;he is a man that finds a reason to fight again.
I:325;779;A tasteful remix cinamatography style adds to the experience.
I:325;780;This is Denzel at his best.
I:325;781;Great movie and vet heartfelt.
I:325;782;I was surprised and it was unforgettable!
I:325;783;I liked the shakey filmwork.
I:325;784;It's funny that people will give anything with Keanu reeves a decent review when he speaks solely in monotone.
I:325;785;All in all This one was pretty g@dd*mn good.
I:325;786;He is the bodyguard of a wise beyond her years Dakota Fanning, isolated with her family in Mexico City, where kidnapping is a real fact of life.
I:325;787;She gives him the respect and affection he hasn't had from the outside world in a long time.
I:325;788;Washington shows a wide range in this movie and it can be enjoyed by both men and women.
I:325;789;Man on Fire Movie was a great movie with great actors and we will enjoy watching it over and over again.
I:325;790;I have seen this movie before but watched it again with my lady friend.
I:325;791;She loved the movie and I enjoyed it again.
I:325;792;Mr. Washington is one of my favorite actors and with a story line like this movie has he really shines.
I:325;793;Excellent movie, excellent supporting actors, over all not a bad Dwayne to spend time.
I:325;794;There are also rumors that Fox will be re.
I:325;795;in I thought it would be (hey, it comes with an insert, how rare is THAT these days?!)
I:325;796;Great story/plot, incredible acting, great action.
I:325;797;the answer that comes to mind is REVENGE.
I:325;798;Man on Fire is one of the most thrilling films of the year.
I:325;799;Denzel Washington has a very powerful performance as he plays a man out for revenge and redemption as his co star Dakota Fanning is kidnapped by terrorists in Mexico City.
I:325;800;The film is so powerful because it makes you have so many feelings while viewing the movie.
I:325;801;The film is a must see and will have you exploring a man on fire mentally.
I:325;802;It is about love,compassion,coming face to face with your demons,and doing what is right.
I:325;803;it will inspire you and your love ones.
I:325;804;Nice plot development, which sets up for nice action sequences towards the end of the movie.
I:325;805;Denzel does his job like no other, and he was very convincing in this movie.
I:325;806;It's a good film, violent and dramatic.
I:325;807;edge story and everything else that would make this film worth owning.
I:325;808;One of the best looking live action BD's to date, it is absolutely stunning.
I:325;809;I really liked this movie a lot.
I:325;810;Director and all actors did a great job, the plot was interesting, great photography.
I:325;811;Highly recommended to those who like good thrillers.
I:325;812;One of the best movies I have seen recently.
I:325;813;creasy, of course, takes the job.
I:325;814;Indeed, Pita's innocence and youthful zest for life make Creasy want to live again.
I:325;815;jawed superheroes of screen legend.
I:325;816;Indeed, Denzel's performance is eminently watchable, as is that of each of the major players in the production.
I:325;817;Dakota Fanning, at age 10, is incorrigibly engaging as the kid who wins the Tough Guy's heart.
I:325;818;Mitchell, whom I've not seen before, is completely convincing as the gorgeous Mom who holds her child dearer than anything.
I:325;819;up that transcends most of the genre because of Denzel presence.
I:325;820;If you travel to Mexico City a lot this film will scare you.
I:325;821;This is a good action film.
I:325;822;It will probably be Dakota Fanning's best performance of her lifetime.
I:325;823;She is now 12 and acts like a Hollywood 50 year old and it is kind of creepy to say the least.
I:325;824;Denzel Washington does a great job here.
I:325;825;painful to watch in parts but a good film.
I:325;826;Denzel Washington is simply one of the best actors alive.
I:325;827;It's really something to behold.
I:325;828;Their relationship is firmly established (mainly due to the great on.
I:325;829;It's the subtle things in Denzel's performance that really make it shine.
I:325;830;He shows tenderness a split second before he shows ruthlesness.
I:325;831;His character undergoes such a dramatic transformation that it takes an actor of the highest skill to do it convincingly.
I:325;832;The movie is truly fantastic due to the writing and acting, not the directing.
I:325;833;It's a must have for any Denzel fans, or really anyone who enjoys a well written story with real heart.
I:325;834;screenwriter Brian Helgeland is easily Scott's best film and one of the best of last year.
I:325;835;The cinematography is great, the use of subtitles is great, Scott's directing and Denzel Washington/Dakota Fanning are in top form.
I:325;836;"The movie ""Man on Fire"" is about John Creasy (Washington)."
I:325;837;It's pretty much right on par.
I:325;838;"this film is great
I:325;839;This movie is very intense and riveting, it will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end.
I:325;840;Great movie, one to watch over and over.
I:325;841;For god's sake man, do good actors have to get ocsar by dying in their films?!
I:325;842;Kudos for casting and screenwriting.
I:325;843;It's a great movie and you'll love Denzel's performance as an alcoholic with a troubled past but hope for the future ( sounds like college .
I:325;844;Very very realistic, and it's the first movie to make this tough man cry in a while.
I:325;845;Yeah, that's right you head me, I'm man enough to admit it!
I:325;846;"The plot was not that bad
I:325;847;"The acting was good
I:325;848;I would have really liked this one.
I:325;849;This is a good action tale if you relax and suspend disbelief, just going with the flow.
I:325;850;It's curious, though, how the protagonast reacted to the murder of his client.
I:325;851;He acted unilaterally, and merely set out to kill the murderers.
I:325;852;This is an awesome action packed revenge based movie.
I:325;853;He is protecting Dakota Fanning, who is the daughter of a rich man.
I:325;854;This is an awesome movie that any action lover should DEFINATELY see!
I:325;855;Danzel Washington shines again, and Dakota Fanning is truely a talented actress.
I:325;856;The movie is very emotional at times with a very well developed plot.
I:325;857;One of the best movies I have ever seen!
I:325;858;Denzel is inspiring and his relationship with the girl as a bodyguard is beautiful because it seems that she took him out of the dark side of life.
I:325;859;This makes the story and his anger becomes much more intense and truthfull.
I:325;860;"With a story that appears to have been ripped directly from the headlines, director Tony Scott reteams with his ""Crimson Tide"" star, Denzel Washington, and delivers what is possibly one of the most suspenseful, well."
I:325;861;directed and acted revenge tales ever committed to film.
I:325;862;"access edition of ""Man on Fire"" gives the movie the proper treatment it deserves."
I:325;863;Man on Fire accomplishes something many other revenge tales never even aspire to, that is actually delivering a story of substance, and not just violence.
I:325;864;The scenes between Denzel and Dakota are touching, and paint a brilliant portrait of the love Creasy is beginning to feel for this young girl, and how she is showing him that it is ok to live and feel again.
I:325;865;Once she's kidnapped the movie really kicks into overdrive and never lets up.
I:325;866;With outstanding performances from Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington, and terrific supporting actors like Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke, this movie is top.
I:325;867;Man on Fire is rated R for violence and language.
I:325;868;This is a really good movie.
I:325;869;Its still worth the 2 hours and 26 minutes.
I:325;870;It is also a touching story between Creasy and Pita.
I:325;871;Very powerful and very touching.
I:325;872;Powerful performances by Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken, and Dakota Fanning.
I:325;873;i felt the cinematography was great and stylish, and Denzel is always fun to watch.
I:325;874;Dakota Fanning is a natural child actress and gave a moving performance.
I:325;875;"It's a movie
I:325;876;believe story, so you have the power to do that.
I:325;877;"for the acting, cinematography and couple of funny parts = 4 stars
I:325;878;This movie about revenge (hardcore style) was mostly engaging.
I:325;879;I haven't read many other reviews yet, but obviously that Dakota girl is the gem of the whole movie.
I:325;880;Totally natural in front of the camera.
I:325;881;She's so good, she might be used too often in too many movies .
I:325;882;This is a dark, clever and very surreal kind of movie.
I:325;883;it is after this introduction we meet Creasy, played to perfection by the actor Denzel Washington.
I:325;884;Dakota Fanning gives an excellent performance as Pita, the half Mexican, half American child who gets under Creasy's skin and into his heart and teaches him that it is okay to care and love another person.
I:325;885;with the help of a crusading reporter Mariana, the wonderful Rachel Ticotin and the cynical Manzano, a delicious Giancarlo Giannini, Creasy sets about enacting his vow and he does it in style!This is not violence for the sake of violence, and though there is plenty of blood and guts flying, what surprised me was how well it was done!
I:325;886;"Man on Fire is not an easy film to get your head around, the plot is quite complex, the cinematography is utterly surreal in parts, flickering in an out as we are treated to images both real and imagined and in the background there is the ever menacing present of corrupt public officials and a man know only as the ""The voice"" who has kept Mexico in thrall with his constant murderous kidnappings for profit."
I:325;887;the film score is also a crackingly good example of how you can put music in a film and make it part of the whole visual experience.
I:325;888;No one plays a broken man with a heart of gold like Denzel Washington.
I:325;889;I love just about anything Denzel is in.
I:325;890;This particular story tells of a good guy getting even using the crooks own heartless style.
I:325;891;He at first resists her attempts at friendship, but eventually her sweet and matter.
I:325;892;The sweetness of the relationship is juxtaposed with some over.
I:325;893;This is a tense and emotional drama which shows Washington's acting skills at their best.
I:325;894;Quite weird in some parts but great performances done by both Denzel washington and Dakota fanning.
I:325;895;ACTION and FRIENDSHIP all in one.
I:325;896;and willingly gives his life for another.
I:325;897;He even has scarred hands.
I:325;898;It was cool the first time I heard it .
I:325;899;(Richard Crenna) telling the local sheriff that Rambo was about to rock his world in First Blood.
I:325;900;but I really liked this film alot.
I:325;901;christopher Walken and Denzel W. are both great.
I:325;902;Harry's music accompanies Tony's vision so perfectly, and you can see that similarly in Spy Game.
I:325;903;The movie also has some pretty graphic violence but it's done in a way where you don't see much and that allows for your mind to create the graphic image.
I:325;904;aCTING: The acting, along with Tony's directing are what makes the movie so powerful.
I:325;905;Denzel Washington played this role perfectly and I really couldn't see anybody else in the role.
I:325;906;Christopher Walken was fantastic as well and finally we get to see him back in a serious role rather than comedic like Joe Dirt, The Rundown, and the recent Envy.
I:325;907;Mickey Rourke plays his typecast role, but he does it good.
I:325;908;The little child actress did a phenomenal job in my opinion and her acting did not feel forced or rehearsed like most child actors, it was truly genuine.
I:325;909;Man on Fire while isn't a masterpiece, is an emotional evoking film that is both poignant and thrilling at the same time.
I:325;910;crafted visuals of the movie to do their job then you'll find the experience well worthwhile.
I:325;911;This was one of Denzel Washington's best movies.
I:325;912;It's violent, but the story is a good.
I:325;913;The author takes you to interesting places you've never heard of and introduces you to fascinating characters that you come to really care about.
I:325;914;The novel is emotionally engrossing, suspenseful, the plot unfolds in a logical, intriguing way, and most of all, it tells a STORY.
I:325;915;something Tony Scott, the director of the movie, obviously considers of minor importance.
I:325;916;The first half of the movie, detailing the bonding of Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning's characters, is taken pretty much straight from the book, and the interplay between the two is clearly the highlight of the film.
I:325;917;No, Scott has to change everything in the second hour and the book's fascinating characters and intriguing plot twists becomes just a jumbled mish.
I:325;918;anyway, if you enjoyed the first half of the movie and felt let down by the second, then I heartily recommend that you READ THE BOOK, and see what a great movie they might have made.
I:325;919;That is all I can say.
I:325;920;Denzel Washington gives a strong performance as he depicts the initial lost soul to the changed man who found life again in order to return to his former self, a ruthless killer.
I:325;921;cuts are fused together with grainy photography, which is suppose to provide an authentic experience, much like documentaries, which together provokes further tension between characters in the story.
I:325;922;There are some interesting scenes that support this idea when Denzel Washington swims in a pool between the killings, as if he was purging himself of what he has done.
I:325;923;That is when Washington comes into play.
I:325;924;Pita the little girl takes an instant liking to Creasy her new body.
I:325;925;But, before Creasy knows it finds a certain liking to Pita.
I:325;926;while many reviewers claim this movie moved them deeply.
I:325;927;How do you take a decent script, fine cast and turn it into average, run.
I:325;928;Because Denzel is working his butt off here, so is the incredible Dakota Fanning, not to mention the fine cameo that Chris Walken turns in.
I:325;929;and keeps spinning it, twisting it, whirling it, gliding with it.
I:325;930;hey, Mr. Scott: it's very simple.
I:325;931;Take a look at some of the late, great John Ford's films.
I:325;932;Great Tension, fantastic cast, great acting, excellent location photography.
I:325;933;Yes this has action, but you gotta wait for it.
I:325;934;Man On Fire is an excellent movie!
I:325;935;The movie runs at nearly 2 1/2 hours long, which is pretty long, but, it is still an excellent movie with style and charisma, thanks to Denzel.
I:325;936;His performance is a possible Oscar nomination for Best Actor at next year's Oscars, he is excellent in this performance.
I:325;937;Her performance is as excellent as Denzel's is.
I:325;938;Creasy and Pita strike up a friendship.
I:325;939;Tony Scott's directing is excellent and has made a well done movie.
I:325;940;The screenplay by Brian Helgeland, based on the novel by A. j. Quinnell, is excellent.
I:325;941;The cinematography by Paul Cameron is excellent.
I:325;942;The film editing by Christian Wagner is excellent.
I:325;943;The production design by Benjam n Fern ndez and Chris Seagers and the costume design by Louise Frogley is excellent.
I:325;944;The art direction by Hector C. Romero is excellent.
I:325;945;The set decoration by Elli Griff is excellent.
I:325;946;This movie is well made and fast paced.
I:325;947;It is a emotional and powerful movie.
I:325;948;This has to be Denzel's best movie ever.
I:325;949;I'm not normally an action flick fan, but I really enjoyed this movie.
I:325;950;The story does not drag at all, it seems everyone involved in the kidnapping is corrupt, even our hero Creasy, but it is also surprisingly touching at a couple of points.
I:325;951;The action sequences are really well done and I like the overall dark, gritty feel.
I:325;952;Denzel Washington gives a superb performance, as does Christopher Walken, but young Dakota Fanning absolutely shines.
I:325;953;Mr Washington IS one of the best actors there is!
I:325;954;ray makes it all worth while again.
I:325;955;over two hours of the constant strobe like photograghy drove me insane but the story itself still holds you in your seat.
I:325;956;the dark mood,eerie music and Denzels desperation all work so well that this is maybe the darkest most intense movie in years.
I:325;957;He soon forms a bond with her and they are good freinds than it happens she is kidnapped and Creasy is put in the hospital he is also being hunted by an organization of corrupt cops.
I:325;958;denzel should have won another award he switches characters almost he's hopeless and fed up with life in the beggining and has you almost in tears,than he's happy and finding life again,then he is a enraged bad.
I:325;959;corn fun it is deep,powerful entertainment,and theres no action just flat out violence.
I:325;960;This was an awesome movie!
I:325;961;Denzel's character (John Creasy) was so amazing and he pulls you in right from the beginning.
I:325;962;I loved how he starts out a tough troubled man but in the end, he shows the softer and caring side of himself.
I:325;963;The daughter, Dakota Fanning, is also a great little actress.
I:325;964;She will be pulling at your heartstrings, as she did on Mr. Creasy's.
I:325;965;An excellent movie choice and well worth watching more than once!!
I:325;966;This sickening film has little to recommend it.
I:325;967;I absolutely love Denzel Washington, so I expected no less than a phenomenal movie from him, and I'm glad I wasn't disappointed.
I:325;968;I loved every minute of it, and that includes all the violence that some people seem to hate about.
I:325;969;In fact, I loved this movie so much that I had to add it to my collection.
I:325;970;This has got to be one of the most talented girls in Hollywood right now, at least for her age anyway.
I:325;971;I really underestimated him, but he actually did pretty good though.
I:325;972;I would definitely watch this movie again.
I:325;973;The movie was very well done!
I:325;974;It had a lot of action, action, and more action in it.
I:325;975;It was like my first action movie and it was good, besides the parts with the blood.
I:325;976;For people who don't know what I'm talk'in about all I have to say is the best actress in the whole world is Dakota Fanning and the movie is great.
I:325;977;next!This movie makes one contemplate the virtues of heroism in the face of extreme odds, and goes into great painstaking detail about how things work on the dark side when a child is taken.
I:325;978;though I'm not one to advocate violence, here is a film where there is something satisfying to see the tables turned on the kidnappers, and Creasy was willing to put his life on the life to win back the life of the child he was hired to protect and grew to love.
I:325;979;This is another great movie dramatization of the eternal theme: that one person _can_ make a difference.
I:325;980;You are mesmerized (again) by viewing the craft of one of the best actors of our time.
I:325;981;And that's the way it should be.
I:325;982;"the plot of ""Man on Fire"" is oft used and simple."
I:325;983;While it's an (only slightly) above average film, Washington is worth the trip.
I:325;984;Denzell Washington gives an excellent performance as John Creasy, a former assassin now turned bodyguard.
I:325;985;packed thriller and find out.
I:325;986;once again, Denzell Washington is at the top of his game.
I:325;987;Dakota Fanning is adorable in her role.
I:325;988;She is really gifted at such a young age.
I:325;989;must see for Denzell fans.
I:325;990;Must see for Dakota fans.
I:325;991;"reality with the way the film is shot and edited, but that is what director Tony Scott ends up doing with ""Man on Fire."""
I:325;992;Take all those away and you would find one of Washington's better performances and you can still see it, but you have to get past the visual garbage.
I:325;993;"She is cute and smart (it is Dakota Fanning
I:325;994;Of course, she is kidnapped just as their bond is strongest, mainly because she refuses to leave her friend behind when he is being shot to pieces in a gunfight.
I:325;995;"As Rayburn tells the cop: ""A man can be an artist in anything."
I:325;996;ceasey's art is death, and he's about to paint his masterpiece.
I:325;997;I also liked that while the thought of Pita would stay his hand from killing one particular person, he was still able to ensure that person died as they deserved.
I:325;998;Those who are expecting this film to have a happy ending are going to have to rethink what a happy ending might be under the circumstances here.
I:325;999;The idea of finding redemption through a blood bath mind seem strange, but Washington's powerful performance carries the logic of the film, even thought the director's bag of tricks often gets in the way.
I:325;1000;first, the backdrop: A wave of kidnappings had swept through Mexico city, feeding a growing sense of fear and panic among its wealthier citizens.
I:325;1001;in the first part of the movie, Creasy began his growing friendship with Pita, who slowly but surely, worked her way into his initially hardened heart.
I:325;1002;She changed the behaviour of the cold Creasy, making him alive and smile again, and he felt a great affection for her.
I:325;1003;He also felt a newly found sense of purpose in his life and even encouraged her to do better at swimming, while he at the same time attempted to deal with the demons of his own past.
I:325;1004;Creasy: You welcome the sound.
I:325;1005;In fact it's the sound that sets you free.
I:325;1006;I guarantee you, you won't be lonely.
I:325;1007;Creasy added: I got all the time in the world.
I:325;1008;"Finally, he managed to come close to the ringleader, known as The Voice"", after having intercepted the latter's rogue brother and sister."
I:325;1009;for me, the fourth and final part of the movie was really poignant.
I:325;1010;on the whole, this has been a very good movie to watch, even though some parts have been quite violent and gruesome.
I:325;1011;Nevertheless, it has also something worthwhile for all of us to learn.
I:325;1012;both Denzel Washington and Dakota Fleming acted very well in the movie.
I:325;1013;like the action and the performances of the actors they're great I really enjoyed this movie was amazing really loved it
I:325;1014;Great acting by many fine actors.
I:325;1015;This is my most favorite movie ever.
I:325;1016;Denzel Washington should have won the Academy Award for his performance and Dakota Fanning should have won Bet Actress.
I:325;1017;My take on it:Creasy is a man of faith, and somewhere along the way felt he had somehow greived God's spirit.
I:325;1018;All show God has been with him and was now calling him to a greater purpose.
I:325;1019;We see Creasy find his faith again and his redemption.
I:325;1020;What greater sacrifice can one give than his own life for anothers?
I:325;1021;He died knowing and feeling GOD's presence and peace.
I:325;1022;This movie was sooo good!!!
I:325;1023;Its my first time watching it and I cried.
I:325;1024;Dakota's father is played by Marc Anthony and I thought he was surprisingly good.
I:325;1025;Denzil is great as always(with his sexy self), and Dakota Fanning(!!!!)
I:325;1026;was such a great actress!
I:325;1027;My g. ma got it for me for my b. day!
I:325;1028;The storyline to Man On Fire is superb, not only is the message is clear but it makes true sense that even the deaf can understand it.
I:325;1029;the storyline is full of surprises and the picturing, itself, is twisting.
I:325;1030;I was surprised to find a lot by this movie because it was unpredictable.
I:325;1031;Everything is everything here, I'd be brave enough to say that this is one of the best movies of 2004.
I:325;1032;denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors of all time, he always puts 100% into his work and that is what I liked about him.
I:325;1033;As soon as I saw his name on this movie, I knew I had to see it.
I:325;1034;All I can say to you is that this is a great movie and that you expect the unexpected.
I:325;1035;It will keep you on your toes the whole way through, and that my friends, is WORD IS BOND
I:325;1036;He takes a job protecting a wealthy young couple's little girl named Pita (Fanning).
I:325;1037;performances all around are superb.
I:325;1038;you really feel they are going through this incredible emotion.
I:325;1039;Although a very violent movie, it has some great writing and acting.
I:325;1040;denzel Washington does a fantastic job as the washed up government hit man.
I:325;1041;They both played excellent parts as the daughter and police official.
I:325;1042;I was very impressed with the short amount of time it took for my order to arrive, first of all.
I:325;1043;My dad absolutely loves this movie!
I:325;1044;Dakota Fanning is one of his favorite actresses, especially when she was younger so when he saw this movie he had to have it!
I:325;1045;It's awesome that it's based on a true story.
I:325;1046;I would recommend this movie, it's very well done.
I:325;1047;Very good plot and Denzel Washington truly stars as a man burdened by his past who rises far above the call of duty to protect, then avenge, and finally rescue the young girl he was hired to guard.
I:325;1048;Then the action gets really interesting .
I:325;1049;He really made this movie.
I:325;1050;He was tough, hard, brutal, which is not a role that you usually see him in, and he did really good with the acting.
I:325;1051;He kept cutting his fingers until he would reveal.
I:325;1052;"Well, then he turns to him and say, ""Now I am going to take you on a journey."

I:325;1054;one family hires an ex.
I:325;1055;washington is intense and brooding, his single.
I:325;1056;mindedness contrasted against the chattering of enterprising families who struggle for space in a chaotic city, but there are equally strong supporting actors, Christopher Walken as an old Black.
I:325;1057;ops friend, now retired with a family and a distaste for murder and Mickey Rourke, in a small but believable bit as a corrupt broker.
I:325;1058;The real beauty of the film is the attachment between Creasy and Pita, the little girl who chips away at the frozen heart of a world.
I:325;1059;I ordered this as a gift for a family member.
I:325;1060;He loves this movie, lent it out and never got it back.
I:325;1061;Good price, convenience of shopping on line and with prime shipping .
I:325;1062;Denzel is one of the top 5 greatest actors ever.
I:325;1063;He is the Michael Jordan of film, the Ali of his craft.
I:325;1064;Strong plot and good character development, excellent ending that wraps the movie up well, would definitely recommend to anyone else.
I:325;1065;Great casting job, as well.
I:325;1066;This movie shows a man that is willing to give up his life for a life of a small girl.
I:325;1067;One of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:325;1068;Washington has truly become a great actor.
I:325;1069;Dakota is at her best.
I:325;1070;It is a touching but gritty story about a man, played by Denzel Washington, who signs up to be the bodyguard of a little girl from a well.
I:325;1071;He admits this to the family, and they hire him anyway.
I:325;1072;An honest journalist and the police captain try to find the girl.
I:325;1073;The bodyguard determines that the fast and best way to get her back is to do it himself.
I:325;1074;He pursues the gangsters, reveals that the father was part of the abduction and returns the girl to her mother.
I:325;1075;The violence isn't used just for violence sake and the story line is good.
I:325;1076;I will be watching it over and over again through the years.
I:325;1077;i mention this as the director of this truly mezmerising vampire flick was Tony Scott.
I:325;1078;This is truly a brilliant movie!Yes it has it's faults but Denzel is magnificent and Dakota Fanning IS Pita!
I:325;1079;in fact the first hour or so of the movie concentrates on the relationship between Pita and Cresey so we can comprehend his actions.
I:325;1080;I'm going to Kill em,everyone who profited from this or had something to do with itand he certainly keeps to his word!!
I:325;1081;it has many religious overtones and references and explores a whole relm of human emotions from greed to happiness,redemption and salvation.You actually have to watch it more than once to fully appreciate how well this movie is made.
I:325;1082;the acting is superb not only the main cast but Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke both give excellent cameos.
I:325;1083;also many of the Latin American actors,especially the bad guys,are excellent.
I:325;1084;the score is brilliantly put together,reflecting the many moods of the film.
I:325;1085;personally I thought it only added to my enjoyment of the movie and made it even more memorable.
I:325;1086;as you might have gathered by now I recommend you see it!!
I:325;1087;denzel Washington is one of our finest actors, and his performance here does nothing to tarnish his reputation.
I:325;1088;Dakota Fanning is a cute kid who has no difficulty delivering precocious lines as a child actor.
I:325;1089;In movie after movie in her brief career she has played essentially the same role: the little blonde girl who is smarter than the average little blonde girl.
I:325;1090;"In ""Man on Fire"" the aspect that works most effectively is the mentor/protege relationship between Denzel and young Miss Fanning as Pita."
I:325;1091;creasy is initially all business with young Pita.
I:325;1092;But they form a believable bond and mutual respect over several weeks and some of the better scenes of the film are of Creasy acting as Pita's swimming coach.
I:325;1093;He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals, says Rayburn.
I:325;1094;Do you LIKE the idea of a well.
I:325;1095;For the creative vigilante act I can only give 3 stars.
I:325;1096;Man On Fire has got to be the most riveting film I've experienced in conscious memory, the characters are so believable I felt as if I'd known them personally very early on.
I:325;1097;tag and threaten to squander that which is so precious and irreplaceable.
I:325;1098;what's more, and perhaps amazingly, the scenes that draw you in and touch your soul are equally memorable, if not more so.
I:325;1099;these scenes are so beautifully genuine and pure, they set a hook that's inescapable!Also on the serving tray of this sensory smorgasbord you'll find dark irony, a cascade of bitter betrayals, subtle but heroic sacrifice, rare moments of humor, and a level of empathy and retaliatory consensus that leads you to accept just how something so wrong (i. e., a vindictive killing spree,) can be so right.
I:325;1100;"all ""Man On Fire"" showcases an inspired performance by two seriously talented actors."
I:325;1101;Denzel Washington (as Creasy) is excellent as usual (the man is brilliant, what more can be said?)
I:325;1102;And Dakota Fanning's portrayal of her character (Pita) is flawless.
I:325;1103;She is as talented as she is adorable.
I:325;1104;and then some!Lastly, though at times slightly distracting, I found the unique filming style to be quite effective.
I:325;1105;Denzel Washington is one of the best actors/directors in Hollywood today.
I:325;1106;american actors out there, Denzel Washington has proven to follow in the footsteps of other great actors such as Morgan Freeman, Samuel Jackson, James Earl Jones, Ossie Davis, Danny Glover, Lawrence Fisbourne, Terrence Howard and many others.
I:325;1107;This movie also comes packaged in a 'back.
I:325;1108;Great bargain, if you can find it.
I:325;1109;while the movie is almost two and a half hours long, once the plot sets itself up, it jumps right into the action and doesn't fail to impress either.
I:325;1110;I really highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a good revenge movie.
I:325;1111;This is a tale about a soul that's lost in the dark after years of personal torment.
I:325;1112;What is amazing is how the relationship developes and how it climaxes to an emotional end.
I:325;1113;"I figured this would the ""happy ending"" movie, but it wasn't."
I:325;1114;This has been the best film I have seen in years.
I:325;1115;It is slick, fast and, well, furious.
I:325;1116;Washington's performance is very convincing, as struggling alcoholic/ ex CIA operative, John Creasy, who slowly becomes attached to the young girl he has been employed to protect, Peta.
I:325;1117;Dakota Fanning's (Peta) performance is simply stunning, especially considering she is very young.
I:325;1118;But she wins over this man who is supposed to be her body guard.
I:325;1119;He puts it all on the line for her when she is kidnapped and, in fact, gives his life for her.
I:325;1120;There are some of us who are lighter than others and some of us who look damn near white.
I:325;1121;"kids seeking thrills and violence, and adults looking for intelligent entertainment, a la its director, Tony Scott's, ""Spy Game"" [2001]."
I:325;1122;been former CIA operative, leads a cast of consummate professionals.
I:325;1123;At first Creasy plays his usual, all business self, but soon the girl wins his heart.
I:325;1124;They bond in the movie's most moving scenes.
I:325;1125;first I'll give a brief resume of the story.
I:325;1126;"rayburn's brilliant idea is to attain an ""easy job"" for his pal as a child's bodyguard."
I:325;1127;No way, Pita is persistent and charming.
I:325;1128;Creasy's defenses melt and a warm relationship ensues.
I:325;1129;without recovering from his wounds Creasy starts a wild revenge chase, picking one suspect after other with the help of a journalist.
I:325;1130;when judged as an action film: it is a great movie.
I:325;1131;Nicely filmed, each photogram is framed with great care.
I:325;1132;when judged appreciating playacting: it is outstanding.
I:325;1133;denzel Washington gives, once more, a very impressive impersonation.
I:325;1134;He is one of my all times favorite actor.
I:325;1135;possessed, very expressive and realistic.
I:325;1136;special mention must be done for Rachel Ticotin as journalist Mariana, sober but full of stamina acting.
I:325;1137;She deserves to receive more important personages to flesh up.
I:325;1138;She is a very fine actress, still underestimated by producers and directors.
I:325;1139;i consider this an intelligent film that may be enjoyed by action movies lovers.
I:325;1140;In the second half of the movie, that plotline is demolished as Washington's character abandons his struggle for the salvation of God and embraces his nature as a creature of violence, going on a brutal rampage of justice against equally brutal criminals who have harmed someone he loves.
I:325;1141;I at once admired the artistry of the film in its portrayal of a man fighting a great battle within himself and loathed the confused Hollywood morality.
I:325;1142;At any rate, the portrayal of the eventual fate of Washington's character is perhaps the most potent ending I've seen in a movie this year.
I:325;1143;By the closing credits I knew I had seen a great picture, many cuts about the average.
I:325;1144;There is an edge to it that I haven't seen in a mainstream film in a long time.
I:325;1145;The scenes and shot selection seem almost random, until you realize that the overall effect has been one of great power.
I:325;1146;The director has chosen a somber tone, completely unromantic, and it fits the story beautifully.
I:325;1147;the writing is excellent throughout.
I:325;1148;the real triumph of the film, though, is the acting of Denzel Washington.
I:325;1149;soldier in The Last Samurai.
I:325;1150;In short, he creates a character of great depth, and every move is believable.
I:325;1151;"Importantly, when the movie turned to violence, his character was without the politically correct ""misgivings"" so many action film leads suffer with, and his attachment to his client was developed beautifully and completely believable."
I:325;1152;This is one that will stand the test of time, as well as many repeat viewings.
I:325;1153;A classic and Denzel never better
I:325;1154;Dakota Fanning was incredible, as was Denzel, rest of cast.
I:325;1155;Denzel Washington is excellent as body guard John Creasy.
I:325;1156;Denzel does a great job playing a former government agent assigned to protect a little girl from kidnapping in Mexico City.
I:325;1157;He and the little girl develop a type of father/child relationship that is so strong that it gives him reason to live.
I:325;1158;some scenes may be a little graphically violent and the actual kidnapping scene is a heartbreaker, but it is a story that it is one of those rare action films that has its heartwarming scenes too!
I:325;1159;Christopher Walken is pretty good as Denzel's friend and look for Marc Anthony as the little girl's father.
I:325;1160;Saw the movie, thought it was amazing.
I:325;1161;really getting a good feel for Washingtons character and Dakotas character.
I:325;1162;Thought the book was amazing.
I:325;1163;Flashy imagery and gritty tortrue and action set pieces dont help it much.
I:325;1164;The only fuel for this film is another magnetic performance Denzel can put on his list and Dakota Fanning as the little girl.
I:325;1165;"All this flash and artsy fartsy nonsense overshadows good performances from Denzel Washington as the assassin/bodyguard
I:325;1166;Man On Fire is an intense action thriller that takes you through hell and back.
I:325;1167;stylish at times with fancy editing and camera work, it proves to be a more than effective thriller.
I:325;1168;Starting a new life in Mexico, his best friend finds him a job as a bodyguard to a nine.year.
I:325;1169;Amazingly, he starts to get attached to Pita and finds a new reason to live.
I:325;1170;Creasy does his best to take out the kidnappers when it happens, but is outnumbered and has been shot multiple times.
I:325;1171;tony Scott directs this intense and emotional thriller.
I:325;1172;He does a great job with the material and he knows how to get the performances that he wants from his actors.
I:325;1173;"Denzel Washington gives one of his most powerful performances since ""Training Day."""
I:325;1174;He really makes you feel for his character, and his absolute hatred towards the people involved with the horrible kidnapping is done in an extremely realistic and convincing way.
I:325;1175;"Dakota Fanning does a great job in her role of ""Pita"" and does well by playing opposite of Denzel."
I:325;1176;He plays it perfectly and does not try to steal any scenes from Washington.
I:325;1177;There is one scene in particular that makes the ear.
I:325;1178;It looks and sounds great.
I:325;1179;Man On Fire is a powerful and unforgiving thrill ride that will keep your heart pumping and your forehead sweating.
I:325;1180;Other than some of the flashy and fast editing/camera work, the movie really works.
I:325;1181;"If you're looking for a powerful thriller with a lot of ""bang"" and real emotion, then this is something to check out."
I:325;1182;As dark and brutal as this movie is, I really enjoyed watching this.
I:325;1183;It was suspenseful, family safe for all but the most prudish.
I:325;1184;It had a beginning, a middle, and a great ending.
I:325;1185;Have watched it three times at least since then and it plays great!
I:325;1186;This is a very good movie, All actors do a good job on a very difficult and real subject that is the rampant wave of kidnappings in M xico.
I:325;1187;"Most all of the bit players do produce a believable spanish EXEPT for the Voice's brother, and the main ""MEXICAN"" characters, Rachel Ticotin, who did try very hard, but slipped, and The Great Giancarlo Giannini, who mashed the language to a fine pulp."
I:325;1188;Performance wise is solid, but have seen better before this movie.
I:325;1189;But the mature acting was shinning on her almost every time she's on screen, the emotion is convincing enough that she can capture your attention on her from Washington when it suppose to be happen.
I:325;1190;Fanning has a gift, she worked for it, you can tell.
I:325;1191;For about 10000 movies in the past that pretty much portrait the same kind of plot and story, you still find yourself guessing what might be going to happen next.
I:325;1192;Denzel is great in every movie he has done.
I:325;1193;Visually stunning, fast paced, awesome movie.
I:325;1194;If you like movies like Traffic, Desperado, True Romance and Reservoir Dogs I think you will enjoy this one.
I:325;1195;"The one artistic feature of this movie is its cinematography
I:325;1196;"the introduction to the action is riveting
I:325;1197;denzel Washington, in his customary role of the tough, warm.
I:325;1198;hearted hero, gets captured by tiny Dakota Fanning's huge, knowing blue eyes.
I:325;1199;The warmth of this friendship is soon shattered by the barbarism of a starved people who have laws without teeth to live by.
I:325;1200;the Power of One at work.
I:325;1201;We understand, thanks to Washington's impeccable acting, that what we would like to do to the villains in the situation, but are too civilized to even dream about, is shown to us sometimes in delicate euphemisms and sometimes in brutal action.
I:325;1202;intelligent little princess, it's a well.
I:325;1203;acted, well thought out movie about a topic we would rather forget.
I:325;1204;One minute you think you know what is going on, the next you jaw has been dropped.
I:325;1205;He's one of my favorite actors.
I:325;1206;Just a great movie, why spoil it?
I:325;1207;This movie was great kept my attention through and through with twist and turns at every moment.
I:325;1208;The way this movie unfolds in pure genius.
I:325;1209;This movie is the best I have seen in a long time.
I:325;1210;You will also notice that there are a lot of famous people in this movie.
I:325;1211;Yet what is so interesting about this movie is the juxtaposition between fiercely loving and protecting someone and what happens when that someone is snatched from your grasp.
I:325;1212;The movie is very clever in its structure.
I:325;1213;hero who learns to love again from a beautiful, angelic looking wise child to the vicious rampage of rampant and gut churning revenge.
I:325;1214;the camera work, visuals and lighting made the film a bit annoying to watch and detracted from the film's overall impact.
I:325;1215;I would recommend watching it.
I:325;1216;It shows that love for a child sees no color.
I:325;1217;Two of my five top favorite actors in the same film, Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken.
I:325;1218;The movies of the 21st century are so filled with fantasy, graphics, and animation, that we have forgotten what true artists are able to do.
I:325;1219;Both Washington and Walken are true to their artform in this film.
I:325;1220;"But lets face it, the basic ""the bad guys get it and the hero win"" is classic film legacy."
I:325;1221;otherwise, got a two thumbs up!
I:325;1222;Great movie on Blu Ray for a damn good price.
I:325;1223;It got here fast and in perfect condition.
I:325;1224;Acting was fine, Dakota Fanning as little girl was very good.
I:325;1225;i liked Denzel in Out of Time but this performance and movie is much better.
I:325;1226;if you liked Denzel in Training Day, then you will love his performance in this one.
I:325;1227;This may be my favorite movie of all time and I'm not sure why this did not get more accolades.
I:325;1228;It is a very gritty and raw movie, which I think sometimes scares away the critics, but everything was top notch in this film . . . and Christoper Walken is always a plus.
I:325;1229;I've watched this movie many times and love it every time I watch it.
I:325;1230;this movie is already great to begin with one of Denzel best movies Imagine it in Blu.
I:325;1231;ray this movie is one of my favorites I just love it
I:325;1232;I was on the edge of my seat for this movie.
I:325;1233;Denzel is not a difficult man to look at and his voice is lovely.
I:325;1234;He always delivers his lines in a most eloquent style.
I:325;1235;The child actor in this film is the best that I have ever seen.
I:325;1236;Anyone would fall in love with her and his devotion towards her is stunning.
I:325;1237;Well worth watching a second time.
I:325;1238;the love that grows between Creasy, and Pita is so beautiful.
I:325;1239;Piecing together the puzzle to the kidnapping he links every single person and holds them ALL PERSONALLY responsible, including Pita's dad.
I:325;1240;this is an excellent film, with extraordinary performances, and purpose driven revenge.
I:325;1241;a life for a life.
I:325;1242;this surpassed any job requirements!
I:325;1243;Were it not for Washington's magnetic performance and the surprisingly realistic interplay between him and Fanning, Man on Fire would be a derivative mainstream revenge flick, but it works for the most part despite some mis.
I:325;1244;Man On Fire is simply one of the best pure action/revenge movies I've ever seen.
I:325;1245;The familiar story where the hero, his life destroyed, decides to wreak Old Testament justice on the responsible parties is a mythical tale as old as Greek drama, a samurai fable brought up.
I:325;1246;tony Scott is firing on all cylinders here, and to my mind this is his best movie to date.
I:325;1247;It ranks with Unforgiven for its sheer, unapologetic demand for retribution.
I:325;1248;It's writer, Brian Helgeland (Mystic River, A Knight's Tale, L. a. Confidential), also did the lean, cool, violent (and often funny) Payback with Mel Gibson.
I:325;1249;This film eschews humor for the most part except when we experience the lightness of the banter and play between Creasy and Pita.
I:325;1250;The best of these kinds of films are stringent and deeply, mercilessly moral.
I:325;1251;This is one of those films.
I:325;1252;at least in Creasy's case (and, eventually, in the mother's as well.
I:325;1253;She is played with intelligence and soul by the quietly gorgeous Rhada Mitchell).
I:325;1254;Washington and Fanning are the stars of this film, and they are both superb.
I:325;1255;This is some of Washington's best work, and the young girl is an astonishing, instinctive actress.
I:325;1256;Be sure and listen to her on the bonus disc.
I:325;1257;The camera captures the moods and the moments with exquisite exactness.
I:325;1258;to Fanning's Pita, impossibly happy, utterly vulnerable, exposed in the bright sun and spotlight glare of the rippling, light.
I:325;1259;He continuously puts us into a fundamental matrix of color and shadow which seizes us and pushes our emotions to the brink.
I:325;1260;In this gritty urban crime drama that takes place in Mexico, drapped in the underworld kidnapping rings, Denzel delivers.
I:325;1261;With almost an all star cast Scott Free productions has done it yet again.
I:325;1262;For any one who truly loves a brilliant, fast paced, beautifully shot actioner.
I:325;1263;The story will keep you guessing until the end.
I:325;1264;One of the best of its kind ever.
I:325;1265;This film touches so deeply into the art of being a real man, of overcoming the demons of your past.
I:325;1266;I have seen the video at least six times and still I enjoy it as much every time.
I:325;1267;The daughter (Pita) played by Dakota Fanning [who is going to be one of the greatest actresses the world has ever seen] gives the performance of her life.
I:325;1268;Enter a host of other actors : Marc Anthony, Mickey Rourke (looking good) and Christopher Walken (always eerie and dependable .
I:325;1269;"Even the nickname she gives him, ""Creasy Bear"" indicates her love and dependability on him."
I:325;1270;The movie has some awesome dialogue and quotes that are going to be remembered for years to come.
I:325;1271;"And he replies : ""What I do best."
I:325;1272;At over 2 hours, the movie takes us on an incredible journey.
I:325;1273;with a few surprises and an ending that will have you in tears.
I:325;1274;"But at the end of the film, Walken's statement about Creasy is proven 100% true : ""He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals!"""
I:325;1275;I'm a big fan of this movie, and this release looks and sounds great.
I:325;1276;He meets up with his old co. worker played by Christopher Walken and is given a job as a body.
I:325;1277;A kidnapping the viewer knows is going to happen from the moment the movie starts.
I:325;1278;"Cresey hears of this and vows to the Ramos family that he ""will do what I(he) does best."
I:325;1279;this movie is pretty entertaining, but so predicatable!
I:325;1280;christopher Walken has a smaller role in the film and, as usual, dominates the screen when shown.
I:325;1281;dakota Fanning is surprisingly really good n this role.
I:325;1282;Not Denzels best movie but still entertaining.
I:325;1283;Dakota does a great job gaining Denzels affection in the movie although I think the relationship should have been a little more focused on in order to reflect the reason Denzel is killing off everyone.
I:325;1284;After she is kidnapped he goes on a mission, vowing revenge on anyone responsible.
I:325;1285;This is a gritty story about revenge and redemption and the two saving graces of the film are Denzel and Dakota.
I:325;1286;And A Man on Fire, is a good story that will have your heart pounding, aching, and at last breaking.
I:325;1287;artistic and just direct the damn film.
I:325;1288;Denzel, Walken, Fanning, Mickey and even Anthony turn in good performances.
I:325;1289;Denzel plays the part of a body guard for young Dakota Fanning and does a marvelous job!
I:325;1290;This movie will break your heart while making you smile!
I:325;1291;Just The same, it was a good movie to watch.
I:325;1292;It's brilliance lies in the acting, the cinematography, and the fact that the story is heart.
I:325;1293;It is a powerful film.
I:325;1294;he hooks up with an old buddy played by c walken.
I:325;1295;but once this gets going,its pretty good.
I:325;1296;hes a decent actor that pushes the roles he takes not unlike kevin spacey.
I:325;1297;I'll make this short: this film is a great study in revenge and self.
I:325;1298;I liked it because it's a good action flick.
I:325;1299;The good characters are vivid, and likeable, the bad guys very contemptable and well.
I:325;1300;I really enjoy this type of action movie?
I:325;1301;they keep me on the edge of my chair wondering what will happen next!
I:325;1302;Because we enjoyed the plot and Denzel's acting in this movie, we decided to add it to our collection.
I:325;1303;All the talk about being able to hold so much space on Blu.
I:325;1304;Excellent acting and super great ending, keeps you on the edge on what will happen next, the ending will touch your heart
I:325;1305;This movie ought to be offered up at film schools as a textbook example of how great actors, a solid premise and a potentially riveting story can be wrecked by a director too far up his own gazoo.
I:325;1306;and the creative impulse driving it .
I:325;1307;also filtered through the style of a revenge film (.)
I:325;1308;Call it what you will, justice, retribution, vengeance, or an eye for an eye.
I:325;1309;This is an action movie with a soul.
I:325;1310;It isn't long before Pita's warm and bubbly attitude rubs off on him and he finds himself smiling and laughing again.
I:325;1311;He finds himself with a new purpose in life.
I:325;1312;While the ensuing reprisal is certainly vicious, it evokes a deep empathy for Creasy and the righteousness of his mission.
I:325;1313;I was exceptionally moved by this film, and also appreciated the spiritual undertones throughout.
I:325;1314;It is way more entertaining.
I:325;1315;"I rate ""Man on fire"" one of the best films of Denzel Washington!"
I:325;1316;I really like this movie not only because of its intensive action scenes but also the perfect acting of Dakota and Denzel, especially the final scene on the bridge!
I:325;1317;Both actors are well known for the ability to trigger audiences' tears!
I:325;1318;And their combination in this movie has definitely made the most powerful tear bomb in history!
I:325;1319;see movie for all denzel fans!!
I:325;1320;Can't fault the actors, they did a good job, and the movie is entertaining .
I:325;1321;It is a tragic, sad, yet very heartwarming story and I love the relationship between the security guard and the child.
I:325;1322;He keeps a Bible with him, and can quote scripture.
I:325;1323;Her bright, loving spirit re.
I:325;1324;This will only appeal to an audience that enjoys gritty action motion pictures.
I:325;1325;I was impressed with the film when I saw it in a theater.
I:325;1326;it makes sense, but keeps you wondering what's around the corner.
I:325;1327;The photography and editing are very good (I believe) and the acting is awesome all the way around.
I:325;1328;Everyone plays their part well and it's totally believable.
I:325;1329;A great story to read or watch.
I:325;1330;Soundtrack and music fit, too.
I:325;1331;I've lived in Mexico City and they've captured the essence of what it was like when I was there.
I:325;1332;The movie is done in such a way that the average person can relate to the characters, the emotions, and the situation a hand.
I:325;1333;this movie shows us that people can redeem themselves in more ways than one in life.
I:325;1334;By being Pita's bodyguard, Creasy was able to form a bond with Pita and let down his walls to see that there was a meaning to life again.
I:325;1335;Fantastic acting of both of these characters make it that much more of an intense storyline.
I:325;1336;It is a true example of unconditional love.
I:325;1337;It will open your eyes and give you something to think about.
I:325;1338;on one last note, i actually enjoyed the score, it seems somewhat similar to Gladiator, but it does suit the scenes in the movie.
I:325;1339;Overall, excellent movie and acting, it deserves more recognition.
I:325;1340;A little intense in the last half, but a great story and well played all the way to the end.
I:325;1341;The cast seemed impressive, so I gave this one a look, Denzel Washington, Mickey Rourke, and Christopher Walken.
I:325;1342;Even goofy Marc Anthony was decent.
I:325;1343;Highly recommend this movie if you like action and aren't offended by graphic acts of revenge.
I:325;1344;Anyway, it's a great movie.
I:325;1345;Of course I love Denzel Washington in most every role he plays.
I:325;1346;A must see if you are a Washington fan.
I:325;1347;"Academy Award winner Denzel Washington (Training Day) is the last man who you don't want to cross in the striking thriller ""Man on Fire""."
I:325;1348;Man on Fire is a gripping thriller from director Tony Scott (Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State).
I:325;1349;Despite the film's lengthy running time, the storyline holds out well and features some good twists.
I:325;1350;There are some pretty good action sequences and intense scenes of Washington's character torturing criminals to uncover the truth behind the kidnapping.
I:325;1351;notch performance is the film's biggest highlight.
I:325;1352;Man on Fire also stars Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken.
I:325;1353;The 2004 thriller is presented in a fine 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format.
I:325;1354;Despite the presence of grain in some scenes, the video transfer offers rich natural colors, great detail and notable resolution.
I:325;1355;There is much to admire, particularly a stellar cast all doing a great job.
I:325;1356;"I also have a strong stomach (and love stuff like RESERVOIR DOGS, KILL BILL, etc. etc. in which the bad guys are dispatched in ""creative"" ways) and appreciation for well done violence."
I:325;1357;The editor, director and cinematographer were having a bit too much fun for their own good.
I:325;1358;She helps make him feel alive again (in some scenes this is done VERY effectively.
I:325;1359;That's all well and good, and is the real reason to see the film.
I:325;1360;His naturally clipped manner works well, and when he dons his sunglasses, he exudes NO friendliness whatsoever.
I:325;1361;Dakota Fanning is, of course, a fine young performer and is very good here.
I:325;1362;Rhadha Mitchell plays her mother very well.
I:325;1363;He's engaged in his role and feels like a real person.
I:325;1364;Mickey Rourke has a small role that suits him well.
I:325;1365;A great fast action movie.
I:325;1366;He knows It's going to be a tough job as there are many many kidnappings for ransom in Mexico.
I:325;1367;"For some criminals, it's a ""profession""."
I:325;1368;"pita likes Creasy so much, she names her teddy bear, ""Creasy bear"" but Creasy resists her friendliness."
I:325;1369;But at last, she wins him over and he teaches her how to win at competitive swim meets.
I:325;1370;"His art is death, and he is about to paint his ""masterpiece""."
I:325;1371;this is a very powerful yet sensitive film.
I:325;1372;All the acting and actors are excellent.
I:325;1373;The film portrays the realities of life in Mexico city, as many kidnappings do occur.
I:325;1374;Director, Tony Scott did a marvelous job on this film.
I:325;1375;i enjoyed watching the film and I think you will too.
I:325;1376;watching paint dry is more rewarding than watcing this !
I:325;1377;This is a good movie but how the director or whoever is responsible for the flashing of the scenes so fast it gives you a headache ought to be taken out and shot.
I:325;1378;If you are looking for a great movie this in a very good one to own.
I:325;1379;As the movie opens, Mexico City has been ravaged by a series of kidnappings aimed at the powerful and well.
I:325;1380;The first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between Creasy and his charge, Pita, a sweet little girl who, slowly but surely, works her way into Creasy's initially hardened heart and affections.
I:325;1381;Even better are the quiet, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie.
I:325;1382;Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.
I:325;1383;In addition to the two leads, there are solid performances from Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini.
I:325;1384;But it is Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show.
I:325;1385;Man on Fire would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time, but this is still a better.
I:325;1386;If you haven't seen this remake if the 1987 movie, it is by far one of the top 10 movies n the past 15 years.
I:325;1387;In the end, just a well paced action movie, well done.
I:325;1388;"cIA operative/assassin,"" is surprisingly good."
I:325;1389;the cinematography is excellent, the directing intentionally choppy at times for (great) effect, and the plot makes sense, from the quid pro quo relationship of the top cop with the top reporter to how Creasy is so comfortable about weapons.
I:325;1390;The director teases the viewer with this!
I:325;1391;This is one of my favorite movies of all time,.
I:325;1392;It catches so many emotions inside of this movie, and it pulls you right in to all of them.
I:325;1393;The movie was edited great you'll notice this.
I:325;1394;Acting is great from all the cast even Mark Anthony.
I:325;1395;The story is sharp and keeps you wanting more.
I:325;1396;A few torture scenes that are hard to watch but overall this film is a great action story that will have you emotionally drained at the end.
I:325;1397;Definately one of my favorite films of all time.
I:325;1398;I stumbled upon this masterpiece while in serious need of having my faith in the magic of Hollywood replenished.
I:325;1399;I could tell you that this film is graphically violent but it is an essential ingredient of the gripping storyline and marvelous story.
I:325;1400;the film is not only made spectacular by magnificent performances by some of Hollywood's elite but the captivating editing techniques used manage to get right down to the nitty.
I:325;1401;gritty of a good revenge flick.
I:325;1402;The originality of subtitling techniques allows one to feel more in touch with a language spoken during the film that one might not understand.
I:325;1403;A brillinat soundtrack gives one an emotional attachment to the situations and the environment the story is set in.
I:325;1404;I was deeply moved by this film and I would highly recommend it to anyone, no matter what sort of genre you prefer.
I:325;1405;This is the type of film that has major re.
I:325;1406;watch value and one always finds something new to enjoy with each veiwing of this cinematic masterpiece.
I:325;1407;Bravo, we desparately need more films that can get so in touch with the real.
I:325;1408;life emotions involved in such relationships as portrayed in this film.
I:325;1409;I very well done film with Denzel Washington and others that do great acting.
I:325;1410;There is a great story to this and exciting to watch.
I:325;1411;The disc has few extras but is very good to watch.
I:325;1412;This was a 4.5 star movie right up until the end.
I:325;1413;i would still recommend this movie because of the top notch performances from all the actors and actresses and the stylish look of the movie.
I:325;1414;I really enjoyed the movie.
I:325;1415;Denzel Washidnton did a great job!Robert A. Maloney
I:325;1416;denzel Washington delievers, as always a class A performance, as a bodygaurd, who, because of the given sircumstances, is now a man with the intenet to kill.
I:325;1417;friggin.yageThis movie has a pretty gritty.
I:325;1418;And anyone who loved Crimsion Tide, will be very happy to see Denzel Washington and Tony Scott working together again.
I:325;1419;This is a good movie lots of action and in good condition.
I:325;1420;It was overall a good deal.
I:325;1421;Man on Fire is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a very long time.
I:325;1422;After I was force to go see it by my friends I realised how brilliant it was.
I:325;1423;The relationship that starts off between Creasy and Dakota Fanning character is pure class as it seems so real on the basis of the whole storyline.
I:325;1424;With the other characters like Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke this movie has a very pleasing cast to see together.
I:325;1425;I think that this has to be one of Denzel better movies as his acting is on the lines of Oscar.
I:325;1426;And he's about to paint his masterpiece.That is the right line for this movie, spoken by Christopher Walken, the right actor.
I:325;1427;Tony Scott's movie is a kidnapping drama set in Mexico City .
I:325;1428;"a ""special place"" according the end credits."
I:325;1429;in a performance that melds elements of his Oscar.
I:325;1430;charms Creasy out of his shell, makes him become her swim coach.
I:325;1431;When a nightclub is blown up, the crowd roars.
I:325;1432;"you had more time,"" Creasy intones ironically."
I:325;1433;cynical and a bit beefier, Washington is good as the tough hombre with a rocket launcher.
I:325;1434;The mark of a good actor is to want what he wants even when we shouldn't.
I:325;1435;Walken shuffles around with his offbeat cadence, utters the movie's best line, and disappears.
I:325;1436;Mickey Rourke makes a cameo using his real, non.
I:325;1437;Mitchell isn't much of an actor, but she's platinum gorgeous, and a perfect trophy wife she makes.
I:325;1438;mexico City, when we can get a clear view of it from Scott's dizzying camera, is a bright, messy backdrop.
I:325;1439;"as it unfolds on a desolate bridge near a Biblical tree in the middle of Mexico, the end of ""Man On Fire"" is the kind of preordained, wide."
I:325;1440;"significance material Scott has loved since ""Enemy of the State,"" the first of his ""import"" trilogy that hopefully ends with this film."
I:325;1441;that were shallow, lurid, painfully macho but, at the very least, aware of themselves and fun.
I:325;1442;Man On Fire is enamored with its potential greatness when it's really a B. movie playing with an A. list star and budget.
I:325;1443;Revenge movies are so popular because we all like to feel that warm fuzzy of satisfaction when the guilty reprobate responsible for causing all that pain to our hero is finally blown up into tiny bloody pieces.
I:325;1444;It's a comfortable feeling of validation that makes us glow with a delightful feeling of righteous fulfillment.
I:325;1445;"Right?Man On Fire is not necessarily a great movie, but it is a great revenge movie, unique in its choice of location, actors, and resolution
I:325;1446;rayburn sets Creasy up with an easy job as a bodyguard to nine.year old Pita Ramos (expertly played by young Dakota Fanniing) daughter of well.
I:325;1447;Creasy's art is death, and he's about to paint his masterpiece.
I:325;1448;"there is wonderful scenery from Mexico City, a tight plot, a wonderful musical score, and a unique and bittersweet climax which all allow Man On Fire to rise up above the ""just another revenge movie"" it could have been."
I:325;1449;I prefer interviews and behind.
I:325;1450;me to sit closer to the TV than I wanted to in order to be able to read them.
I:325;1451;"all in all, Man On Fire is a great movie
I:325;1452;Though certainly not one of the greatest films ever made its still a great film.
I:325;1453;The story is well done and the dialogue is great.
I:325;1454;Mostly its a charater drama, a well done one, and for that i think it deserves some oscar noms, i give it a 9 out of a 10, the spaztic camera use and some of the music could have been worked on, but other then that its a brilliant movie.
I:325;1455;This is one of those rare great stories that will still be great no matter how many times is viewed.
I:325;1456;I gave this as a gift and do not how much they enjoyed it.
I:325;1457;It was a nice movie.
I:325;1458;The image was good, the sound was good.
I:325;1459;the little girl even offers some very compelling moments in the earlier bits of the film.
I:325;1460;"because he can deliver more justice in a weekend than the highest authorities working in tandem with the media could deliver in 10 years""."
I:325;1461;more than one can say for the movie, but just about as credible.
I:325;1462;This movie is a must if you like a little bit of heroism mixed with revenge.
I:325;1463;The chemistry between the two main characters Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning is what gives this movie it's heart and inevitably moves this movie through it's story.
I:325;1464;The history is told mostly through flashes and commentary which makes the film feel more realistic and gives the audience a feeling of being in the main characters head.
I:325;1465;My wife likes this movie and that is ultimately why I got it.
I:325;1466;make starts out with a random kidnapping in Mexico City of a well.
I:325;1467;All turn in believable performances.
I:325;1468;"i am not an action film lover by any means but I truly enjoyed the story with it's ever twisting and turning plotline
I:325;1469;Good story of redemption, and of course, Denzel is perfect for the role.
I:325;1470;Some people will give any movie 5 stars just because it has Denzel Washington in it.
I:325;1471;With that line, the movie takes a drastic turn and lets it all hang out.
I:325;1472;This is a tale of two movies.
I:325;1473;I thought Tony Scott's direction was all glitz and glamour.
I:325;1474;Overall, it's entertaining enough to recommend.
I:325;1475;Dakota Fanning was the redeeming actress in this film.
I:325;1476;She was amazing, and I'm sure we'll be seeing her again.
I:325;1477;Like The Professional, it is a story of love and sacrifice.
I:325;1478;The cinemotagraphy and editing are original and riveting.
I:325;1479;Denzel gives one of his best and most subtle performances.
I:325;1480;This intense action thriller is great from start to finish.
I:325;1481;Creasy is wounded during the kidnapping.
I:325;1482;Needless to say, the action is constant.
I:325;1483;this is really a great flick, but probably not one for those who are too squeamish about violence
I:325;1484;disc Collector's Edition), it has plenty of special features.
I:325;1485;I'm really pleased to watch a extended version in this Blu.
I:325;1486;It is an absolute rarity that a movie comes along like the 2004 remake of Man On Fire.
I:325;1487;Denzel Washington takes on the gritty role as Creasy, an ex.
I:325;1488;old girl in Mexico City, the daughter of a very rich couple, as kidnapping in Mexico City is at an all.
I:325;1489;Dakota Fanning, my favorite actress and one of the best in Hollywood.
I:325;1490;Eventually, though, he softens and the two become very good friends and Creasy begins to realize that maybe life could be worth living.
I:325;1491;Suddenly, the charming and touching moments are shattered when Pita is kidnapped by gangsters and Creasy mortally wounded.
I:325;1492;The movie is beautifully executed, punishingly brutal, disturbingly realistic, excruciatingly violent, and just may be the best movie I've seen in a WHILE.
I:325;1493;it's about something much more deeper and emotional than that.
I:325;1494;I would recommend this film to absolutely anyone, especially those who are fans of the Kill Bill movies.
I:325;1495;This is one of the best 5 films I have ever seen in my life.
I:325;1496;"The acting on all parts in this film is superb, especially that of the gangsters and corrupt ""authorities"" of Mexico D. f."
I:325;1497;They are truly believable and it's good to see them get what they deserve as the story winds down.
I:325;1498;It's real!The film also affords us some great shots of the beautiful upper.
I:325;1499;the film is highly entertaining and, it's real!
I:325;1500;the video transfer is an interesting one.
I:325;1501;This grain is something many like as it provides some depth.
I:325;1502;Many parts of the film are heavily color graded and this brings in even more grain.
I:325;1503;The Linda Ronstadt soundtrack fully envelops you from all channels quite nicely.
I:325;1504;The movie is a good one and, despite its age, retains strong legs and would make a good addition to your blu ray collection.
I:325;1505;This isn't Citizen Kane, for sure, but if you like action combined with great acting, this is your ticket.
I:325;1506;Christopher Walken is particularly fun to watch.
I:325;1507;My guess is he enjoyed parodying himself, but even if that was what he was doing, he is still CW.
I:325;1508;Dakota Fanning is a treasure.
I:325;1509;Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken play as friends and ex.
I:325;1510;Walken's character retires in Mexico after starting a new life with a wife and family.
I:325;1511;Disillusioned by the world and the role that he had in his previous life, Washington drinks to keep the past's demon at bay.
I:325;1512;Washington's character asks Walken in the film, Do you think God will forgive us after all the things we did?
I:325;1513;It's a good story with a lot of action.
I:325;1514;It's eye opening to see the social and political condition of our neighbor to the south.
I:325;1515;"Tony Scott's ""Man on Fire"" is one of the better revenge flicks to come along in recent years."
I:325;1516;dazzling film anchored by a bevy of fine performances.
I:325;1517;Man on Fire has an uncompromising tone that many studio films shy away from these days.
I:325;1518;It is a welcome throwback to the savage revenge flicks from prior decades that were made with little concern for those viewers with delicate sensibilities.
I:325;1519;Washington turns in a tour.
I:325;1520;force performance that is filled with passion and ire.
I:325;1521;Fanning distinguishes herself also and serves notice that she is an actress with a bright future ahead of her.
I:325;1522;Furthermore, the supporting cast sparkles as Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, and Walken all hit the right notes.
I:325;1523;Walken in particular is outstanding in a part that contrasts sharply with the more eccentric roles he usually finds himself in.
I:325;1524;Man on Fire does have some problems with its ending but the film as a whole is still immensely watchable.
I:325;1525;A bullet always tells the truth indeed.
I:325;1526;that aside,he has proven himself to me to be one of our greatest actors of our time.
I:325;1527;both characters take a journey and it is worth watching.
I:325;1528;a love story,in its most honest form.
I:325;1529;it is about seeing yourself for who you are and opening yourself up to what matters most in this life,to experience love,and to be willing to pay for that.
I:325;1530;lots of action and very interesting plot with twists and turns.
I:325;1531;a good movie to watch.
I:325;1532;I found that this movie had me on the edge of my seat.
I:325;1533;Really good acting and I was surprised to find who one of the bad guys was.
I:325;1534;And a lot of surprises here.
I:325;1535;Like your ease of transactions and fast delivery.
I:325;1536;I always find what I want here!
I:325;1537;Hubby and I bought this movie at walmart during black frieday.
I:325;1538;From the first time I saw this movie I thought of it as another excellent Denzel Washington movie!!
I:325;1539;To be honest all actors in the movie did an excellent job with their roles!
I:325;1540;"I was very impressed with Marc Anthony
I:325;1541;This is a great action thriller with plenty of action .
I:325;1542;But the move also combines this with a gripping and emotional storyline to hold it altogether.
I:325;1543;The little girl in the film is absolutely adorable with n infectious personality and it is plain to see why she is able to teach Denzel's character to live again following his past as an alcoholic.
I:325;1544;the move is backed up by a great strong soundtrack which runs throughout, and is feels very appropriate.
I:325;1545;"It's a little longer than it needed to be, but this story of a little girl kidnapped by some criminals in Mexico is still intense, beautiful to look at, and generally hard to ignore
I:325;1546;"Christopher Walken is in fine form, as is Dakota Fanning
I:325;1547;Great scenery and color schemes help to make this something special to me.
I:325;1548;On blu ray, it's pretty amazing.
I:325;1549;This movie was one of the best from Denzel's series of films.
I:325;1550;Man was an inspiring that you watch from beginning to end.
I:325;1551;Denzel is my favorite actor of all time and the way he acts just makes me feel like his movies are all true stories.
I:325;1552;I dont know how he does it!
I:325;1553;I put this movie in my top five Denzel list along with Training Day, John Q, Out of Time, and Fallen.
I:325;1554;This is a must see flick and fans.
I:325;1555;he has done it again!
I:325;1556;It is an awesome movie .
I:325;1557;the first half has the feel of a sweet father/daughter story, the second half like a revenge story, yet it all flows together into a wonderful, touching, (and yes tear.
I:325;1558;He has his demons, and resists Pita's charms for a while, but is soon won over by her sweet disposition and unconditional love.
I:325;1559;military friend Rayburn are brilliant casting decisions, and this is an awesome movie.
I:325;1560;Very cool effects in some of the action scenes, you often feel you are in Creasy's head.
I:325;1561;This is the way special features should be done.
I:325;1562;On disk 1 is the main feature along with a choice of 2 commentaries .
I:325;1563;She is adorable to listen to on her take throughout the movie.
I:325;1564;The writer and the producer do their jobs well both putting in other relevant information and guiding her through the thought process so she shares what we'll be interested in.
I:325;1565;Audio is available in English, Spanish and French.
I:325;1566;Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington did a great job and were a great duo together.
I:325;1567;It's a well known fact that deep at the heart of a large quantity of movies is revenge.
I:325;1568;With the aid of a cop, a reporter and his friend Rayburn, Creasy is able to get back on his two feet.
I:325;1569;With a well acted scenario of murder, kidnapping and betrayal the characters actually seem like real people and now pawns of the writer's guilty pleasure.
I:325;1570;All these add for a nice change in the scenario and a movie that puts a spin on the over cliched genre.
I:325;1571;Who knows, but watch the movie on your own and see what you think.
I:325;1572;Denzel Washington is great actor.
I:325;1573;He gets a lot of work and sometimes the films he appears in just aren't up to his talent.
I:325;1574;is showing Denzel how to live and connect and care again, boom, she's kidnapped.
I:325;1575;tony Scott's stylistical flourishes keep the movie moving, and the intelligent script throws a few curves as Denzel tears through the underbelly of Mexico to get at anyone who had anything to do with the kidnapping.
I:325;1576;If you're a fan of Denzel, there's a lot to love here in his performance.
I:325;1577;great cast includes Mickey Rourke and the actor who played Mathis in CASINO ROYALE and QUANTUM OF SOLACE.
I:325;1578;denzel is a competent actor and very rarely gives into stereotypical roles(RAPPERS TAKE NOTE!!!!!!!!!)
I:325;1579;so creasy is told of a family needing someone to guard their young daughter played fairly well by ms fanning.
I:325;1580;there is a twist here that i didnt really see coming(1 star returned).
I:325;1581;the movie connected the dots nicely and ended with yet another twist.
I:325;1582;the ending should have included a dramatic escape by Fanning involving her ability to swim as the movie centered so much on this aspect of her life.
I:325;1583;Denzel is an excellent actor, as we all know.
I:325;1584;He does so reluctantly and with the acumen of professional, and without realizing it forgiveness is given when his Real services are revealed.
I:325;1585;While he and Fanning work like oil and water first (not mixing very well), he really gets to form a bond with her, encouraging her to do better at swimming, while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past.
I:325;1586;It is that very bond that will force Washington back into his old line of work when Fanning is kidnapped and held for a $10 million ransom, and he is nearly killed.
I:325;1587;Even better are the quiet, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie.
I:325;1588;Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.
I:325;1589;Man on Fire is saved by Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show.
I:325;1590;Having said that I loved this film.
I:325;1591;I'm a big fan of Tony Scott and Denzel Washington.
I:325;1592;Their collaboration here really shines.
I:325;1593;Denzel does a great job of playing Creasy, a bodyguard hired to protect a little girl(Dakota Fanning).
I:325;1594;The core of this film is about a man's fall from grace and his struggles to find meaning and ultimately his redemption.
I:325;1595;I love this movie and I'm happy that it came with no damage.
I:325;1596;This was a good story, and they could have done so much more with it.
I:325;1597;Man On Fire is so close to being a fantastic film and sweep those oscars away.
I:325;1598;on the upside Washington certainly shined, the plot was great up until the end, but even that wasn't a major let down.
I:325;1599;But I feel the film could have been so much better, and a strong contender come the Oscars.
I:325;1600;'However, even if you know the plot twists, the movie is still an engrossing effort courtesy of some very fine acting by the talented cast: Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Radha Mitchell, Christopher Walken and pop star Marc Anthony who is impressive in a key supporting role.
I:325;1601;I want her to watch it and see Denzil create his cinamatic magic.
I:325;1602;He got the idea for this book based on a true story that happened in Italy in 1975.
I:325;1603;after all this I'll get to the point about how good the movie is, it was beautifully acted, written and directed.
I:325;1604;The music of this movie is another thing of beauty.
I:325;1605;The music goes along perfectly, and effectivly heightens every scene that happens.
I:325;1606;it is definetly a movie worth seeing.
I:325;1607;wrenching story is a must see.
I:325;1608;Man on Fire has action and adventure with elements of thriller.
I:325;1609;Denzel Washington gives a worthy performance.
I:325;1610;It helps that Scott has a decent script and a good cast to keep his worst excesses in check, and it has to be said that some of the stylistic touches (such as the very active subtitling) are really pretty good.
I:325;1611;free for all their imagination, but he's prepared to get his hands far dirtier than you'd expect from a mainstream studio picture, and he even manages a couple of moments of emotional resonance as well.
I:325;1612;Good to see Christopher Walken in a good guy role again, too.
I:325;1613;denzel Washington shows why he has won the Oscar twice in his amazing career by playing Creasy, a burned.
I:325;1614;crosses, and corruption that sends the entire story almost full circle and reveals that the ones that destroy us the worst are those that are the closest to us.
I:325;1615;washington shows amazing range with the role of Creasy, stepping from darkness to light and back again in extremely convincing fashion, as does Christopher Walken playing a character seemingly less off the beaten path than most of the characters he has played in past movies.
I:325;1616;It's the cast, and their great acting that saves 'Man on Fire' from being on B. movie list.
I:325;1617;so film, she easily shows that she is just amazing among the B. action film, especially the amusing bantering humor with Denzel's Creasy, whose job, he supposes at first, doesn't include being friendly.
I:325;1618;moving first half, which concentrates on the relations between the man and the girl, the latter half changes the tone in a drastic way, with the furious Creasy who is bent on revenge, or in plain words, killing.
I:325;1619;the film scores bonus points thanks to the great supports .
I:325;1620;Christopher Walken and Giancarlo Giannini are real standout, while Rhada Mitchell, Rachel Ticotin, and Mickey Rourke are all effective.
I:325;1621;But that's simply because 'Man on Fire' has superb acting from superb actors, and the fact remains that 'Man on Fire' is a well.
I:325;1622;acted B. action flick with excessive brutality.
I:325;1623;"I saw this movie when it first came out
I:325;1624;While his portrayal of Malcolm X was eerily realistic.
I:325;1625;"As ""Creasy"" he creates a complex character tortured by inner demons from the past and while the part could have been overacted and destroyed by an actor less talented, Creasy stays believable and compelling."
I:325;1626;Washington, Christopher Walken and Dakota Fanning are superb as well.
I:325;1627;This is a very underrated movie.
I:325;1628;"When she is kidnapped for ransom, her bodyguard is about to ""paint his masterpiece"" as far as getting even goes."
I:325;1629;what it really is that Denzel the actor paints his masterpiece just by doing this movie as his acting is superb in here.
I:325;1630;This is a must see.
I:325;1631;This is one of my all time favorite movies, hands down.
I:325;1632;Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning did an awesome job.
I:325;1633;"packed thriller ""Man on Fire""?"
I:325;1634;but he manages to survive.
I:325;1635;this movie is nothing short of stunning and amazing.
I:325;1636;Denzel yet again pulls off another amazing performance as the troubled man who had little to live for.
I:325;1637;The young Dakota Fanning seems to have a promising career ahead of herself, making her one of the best child actors around since Haley Joel Osment.
I:325;1638;The other actors such as Marc Anthony and Christopher Walken do fine jobs, even with roles that aren't very big.
I:325;1639;"The movie score kinda resembles what was heard on ""Gladiator,"" but it nonetheless still sounds beautiful."
I:325;1640;Man on Fire is one of the best action movies of recent times.
I:325;1641;It's the kind of action flick that keeps you thrilled until its climatic ending.
I:325;1642;It contains many twists amd turns that'll just boggle your mind.
I:325;1643;packed scenes to keep you entertained.
I:325;1644;Tony Scott has made a movie that I dare call a masterpiece and one of the best films of 2004.
I:325;1645;perfect portrayals, there's something about this film that resonates with me.
I:325;1646;As an unapologetic fan of the revenge genre, this movie touches all the bases.
I:325;1647;This movie is about the ease with which children give love and the atonement of past sins.
I:325;1648;She experiences some wins in her life with Denzels help.
I:325;1649;After healing he does what he knows how to do best.
I:325;1650;as great as he is I honestly think this is the best performance I have watched by Denzel.
I:325;1651;"So I'll spare you all that
I:325;1652;The movie is clearly a redemption story .
I:325;1653;but it is how the film plays out the redemption that helps it to rise above common.
I:325;1654;"the story carries a heavily religious tone, from Creasy's early question to Rayburn ""do you think God will ever forgive us,"" to the bible that he carries, the scriptures that he quotes to the Madre at Pita's school, and the oft."
I:325;1655;present holy iconography of the heavily Catholic.
I:325;1656;This marks the beginning of his salvation, much as a Christian is brought into the grace of God through baptism, a ceremony focused on water.
I:325;1657;Just be aware that there is something else going on in the film, a subtext that lends the film much greater meaning, while detracting nothing from the fine acting and action sequences.
I:325;1658;For a film with such worthy actors and an interesting storyline one would expect this movie to really be on fire.
I:325;1659;The young girl is played beautifully by Dakota Fanning who is the one breath of fresh air in this movie!
I:325;1660;Washington does his best to protect Fanning while becoming her unexpected mentor and friend along the way.
I:325;1661;The story has touching moments that could have lapsed into great ones had this film been directed by someone who cared about the outcome and not the quirky artsy movements of his camera lens instead.
I:325;1662;The director Tony Scott has done excellent movies in the past but this one should have been left on the cutting room floor until he adapted his camera styles and strange moving sub.
I:325;1663;A movie that is worth watching several times.
I:325;1664;"When told that the Bible (a book the hero of this film reads often) counsels forgiveness, John Creasy replies blandly (something like), ""Forgiveness: That's between a man and his maker
I:325;1665;A great line, but it points to what disturbs me about this film: its glorification of justice meted out by one man operating outside the law.
I:325;1666;It's true that it's mesmerizing .
I:325;1667;and that both Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning are well cast and excellent in two demanding parts.
I:325;1668;Although I enjoyed watching it (it's quite suspenseful), I was also profoundly disturbed.
I:325;1669;Both Dakota Fanning and Christopher Walken do kind of steal the movie away from the other performers with their wonderful acting,not to mention their interaction with Denzel Washington.
I:325;1670;Still, it is the relationship between Pita (Fanning) and Creasy (Washington)that ultimately carries the movie.
I:325;1671;An excellent movie which shows the ability of people to be inspired by helping others!
I:325;1672;A true testament to the human spirit!
I:325;1673;born wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) at the recommendation of one of his old collegues (Christopher Walken).
I:325;1674;Washington plays the role to perfection.
I:325;1675;"Fanning once again gives an incandescent performance and the other members of the supporting cast including Radha Mitchell (""Pitch Black""), singer Marc Anthony, Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke all give marvelously detailed performances."
I:325;1676;"Although it runs about 20 minutes too long, ""Man on Fire"" is a perfect action thriller and compliments Scott's best work (""Crimson Tide"", ""The Hunger"", ""True Romance"") avoiding the cliches of his hack work (""Beverly Hills Cop II"", ""Top Gun"", ""The Last Boy Scout"")."
I:325;1677;The explosive 5.1 sound mix also grabs your attention.
I:325;1678;Scott and his sound mixer do a stellar job at reproducing the atmosphere of Mexico City in the detailed surround mix.
I:325;1679;we get two wonderful commentary tracks.
I:325;1680;All three discuss Scott's edgy direction, the performances and the changes the script when through from inception to production.
I:325;1681;Surprisingly, Fanning more than holds her own with these two seasoned veterans.
I:325;1682;Hearing these three discuss Scott's approach to the film and their candid assessment of what works and doesn't is also a highlight.
I:325;1683;"a taunt, well directed thriller ""Man on Fire"" provides Denzel Washington to investigate the haunted world of Creasy."
I:325;1684;"Filled with a number of marvelous performances, edgy direction and a well written script, ""Man on Fire"" received an undeserved critical drubbing by many critics (probably because of Scott's association with the project)."
I:325;1685;top production and visual style less of an issue because the emotional aspect of the film becomes more powerful.
I:325;1686;This is one of my favorite movies, but I wish there were more special features.
I:325;1687;The transfer was done really well, not quite like transformers, but still good.
I:325;1688;Acting and story are great.
I:325;1689;Denzel's character is a troubled man who learns to care and love again.
I:325;1690;Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington are absolutely Superb acting off each other .
I:325;1691;Very few movies have ever choked me up.
I:325;1692;An immediate bond between the two as the girl shows him the good side of life he long forgot.
I:325;1693;as a thriller action packed movie, it rarely gets any better.
I:325;1694;as For Denzel Washington, he exceeded expectations in his great and perfect acting.
I:325;1695;excellent scenes with great colors making the movie worth watching over and over again.
I:325;1696;This movie is one of my favorites.
I:325;1697;Denzel Washington is great in the highly excitable action film.
I:325;1698;You must see this movie, especially if you are a fan of Denzel.
I:325;1699;this movie is one of the best action/thriller/drama films that I've ever seen.
I:325;1700;It is also one of the most emotional movies I've ever seen, probably in my top ten.
I:325;1701;The story brings you in and you truly feel for each individual character.
I:325;1702;Dakota Fanning probably has her best performance so far in this movie.
I:325;1703;She is a great choice to play Pita, and the connection between her and Creasy seems absolutely real.
I:325;1704;this connection is what makes the film work so well.
I:325;1705;When he finds out she's alive, he is even more ambitious.
I:325;1706;the action scenes in this movie are great.
I:325;1707;But besides that, this movie delivers with a powerful punch.
I:325;1708;to wrap up, I again say that this movie is amazing.
I:325;1709;Every single character in the movie does simply great.
I:325;1710;Each one makes you feel some kind of emotion for them, especially Creasy, obviously.
I:325;1711;This is probably, in my opinion, Tony Scott's best film.
I:325;1712;MAN ON FIRE is yet another high.
I:325;1713;washington and Fanning are shown to best advantage during the first third of the film, as their characters are fleshed out and create a credible bond.
I:325;1714;Regardless, Christopher Walken is always a welcome presence and his role here (as a former associate of Creasy) may be the closest thing to a normal human being that the actor has ever played.
I:325;1715;"minute diatribe on what a hellhole Mexico City is, the filmmakers have the nerve to end the picture with a thanks to ""Mexico City, a Very Special Place."""
I:325;1716;Man on Fire has got to be one of the best movies ever made for me, this movie has everything.
I:325;1717;What i like about it is that, the first half of the movie is really emotional and calm, no fighting.
I:325;1718;And the little girl (forgot her name) is a great actress too.
I:325;1719;It's also far more entertaining to watch a flawed man seek redemption than a superhero flex his perfection anyway.
I:325;1720;Mickey Rourke and Dakota are used too little here: but both serve the film quite well.
I:325;1721;"In Hollywood, ""redemption"" is a character arc that plays very well in the cinemas."
I:325;1722;"pressed to create a more intense, emotional story of redemption than what can be found in ""Man on Fire""."
I:325;1723;It is just a very emotional topic and is nailed so perfectly by Scott.
I:325;1724;of course, the hallmark of this film is its acting from Washington and Fanning.
I:325;1725;"The way those two characters interact with each other truly carry the emotional burden of the movie and provide the reason to ""care"" about what is going on."
I:325;1726;Plus, in typical fashion, the fiery side of Washington's acting persona is able to be revealed on more than one occasion.
I:325;1727;"thus, I consider ""Man on Fire"" to be one of the best movies I have ever seen."
I:325;1728;It is equal parts intense and emotional, and great acting performances abound.
I:325;1729;Man on Fire had an interesting plot, with Denzel playing a burn.
I:325;1730;This movie is by far once of the best movies I have seen in a very very long time.
I:325;1731;This movie is great from opening credit to the closing credits.
I:325;1732;Denzel once again not only wows me but Dakota Fanning did an outstanding job also.
I:325;1733;you will all be happy you did.
I:325;1734;It's good, not great and I like the child/adult relatinship in the film.
