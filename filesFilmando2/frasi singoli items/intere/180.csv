4;This movie is absolutly wonderful!
5;Every seen was just very realistic.
6;When you watch it, it feels as if all the energy from the movie comes into you.
7;Watch this movie because it might just change you.
8;Excellent story line that was very well cast.
9;I enjoyed it so much I bought this copy as a gift.
10;I spent 6 years in China, and every time an American film was heartwarming my students tripped all over themselves falling in love with it, while I fought the powerful urge to retch.
11;with that out of the way, this heartwarming tale about a strained father.
12;son relationship filled with you don't understand me is genuinely clever, witty, moving, brilliantly written and acted, and just damn funny in a number of places.
13;But no, this movie is very cool.
14;So does everyone else in this fine, fine film.
15;In a nutshell, Billy Elliot is an inspirational film about a talented boy that wants to be a professional ballerina set amidst a miners' strike during Thatcher's era in Northern England.
16;Two actors are worthy of special mention: Gary Lewis plays Billy's father, Jackie Elliot, with such an incredible range of seething emotions that he never once falls into an archetypal role or stereotype.
17;This is one of my favorite movies.
18;Jamie Bell does a fabulous job.
19;This is one of the most delightful, uplifting movies made in an era when most contain extraneous violence and/or impossible special effects supposedly accomplished by human beings.
20;This movie is really great.
21;this is a movie to see over and over again.
22;billy Elliot, a young talented boy, has the love in ballet, although couldn't obtain his father's support but he still keeps the faith.
23;We have a goal, but confront with obstacles, and we give it up.
24;I really learned a lot from Billy Elliot.
25;in addition, Billy's father although seems to be a callous man, but in fact we can eventually know that he loves his little boy so deeply, that he's willing to do any sacrifice to give Billy the opportunity.
26;and the teacher, Julie Walters, does her job so well, keen to give Billy a good training, meanwhile can also listen to Billy's heart, give Billy not only ballet skills, but also a tender and warm care.
27;i was really moved by this hardly seen very nice movie, and I know you must will also love it.
28;Its music is also a masterpiece, I even bought its OST, and listen to it over and over again.
29;This movie was a gift for a friend, and one of my favorite movies of all time.
30;This is a gritty, gripping tale of a boy growing up amid chaos and strife.
31;I'm sure other reviewers have other things to say, but this movie speaks to my heart, and I have no higher praise.
32;This is a film I watch over and over.
33;The historical setting and the original story made it completely real.
34;I liked the ending so much .
35;A touching story of a young, English boy who loves to dance.
36;Initially his father rejects this form of expression.
37;Then he has a change of heart and rallies to his son's defense.
38;The script is poignant, the acting is superb.
39;Icing on the cake is the cinematography and the sound track.
40;A story about a boy who finds his dream in an unexpected turn.
41;And the delivery of Jamie Bell's (Billy Elliot) character and ingenious performance utterly depicted a child's vulnerability and rising amongst chaotic fragments in this world.
42;I think this is the best dance related films ever made and should inspire all young people regardless what their dreams might be.
43;Jamie Bell is outstanding as a coal miner's son who wants to take up ballet instead of the traditional hard core sports required in a blue collar town.
44;This is one of my favorite movies.
45;Its kinda a comedy, kind of a drama.
46;I saw the musical version in London, not as good as the movie!
47;I enjoyed the story a great deal.
48;an emotional and powerful journey that is both familiar and haunting to humankind.
49;Only the light of faith, love and honesty can guide us through the darkness.
50;It is one of those movies that has it all.
51;good Hollywood delivery (i. e., 'The Blind Side'.
52;the 4 star sibling of this 5 star classic.
53;Billy Elliot is definitely one of my favorite movies.
54;
55;Billy Elliot has it's funny, awkward, and uncomfortable moments, but overall it is absolutely heart.
56;warming tale about a young man and the family dynamics that play into him chasing his dreams.
57;Billy Elliot is a wonderful movie about a boy (Jamie Bell)from a working.
58;and likes it (much to his father's dismay).
59;There's a lot of humor and drama in this movie.
60;I loved the soundtrack of T. rex, The Clash and The Jam.
61;The quirky relationships between Billy and everyone else in the cast is something to watch.
62;If you love cheering for the underdog, definitely check it out.
63;Lots of people have reviewed this movie so I'll just say that I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.
64;I literally laughed out loud several times and there were a few tear jerking moments as well.
65;Great story of a young boy's struggle to break free from his harsh environment through dance.
66;I hope we will see more of him.
67;A very moving and touching film.
68;This is a charming movie about resiliency and overcoming the pressure to conform to standard gender norms in order to achieve your dreams.
69;Nobody is a bad guy here and everybody is treated as complex human beings.
70;I was really touched of the sensitive handling of friend who already knows who he is and is not afraid show this side of himself with Billy.
71;Jamie Bell and Julie Walters were terrific.
72;The movie came in good time and good shape and I love it!
73;We really enjoyed the movie.
74;Apart from this one quibble, the film is very well made, capturing the feel of the labor disputes of the 80's in the UK.
75;Billy Elliot is truly one of the year 2000's best films.
76;It is also one, however, that the Oscars overlooked for Best Picture.
77;Billy Elliot was a pure enjoyment and enlightened film.
78;newcomer Jamie Bell plays the starring role of Billy Elliot, and he performes it very well.
79;Absolutely no flaws with Jamie Bell's performance!
80;And Julie Walters, who plays the strict but fair, ballet teacher, is also excellent.
81;As well as the rest of the cast.
82;the real enchantment to this film is the choreography, which is absolutely spectacular!
83;This film is very cleaver and original, and even hilarious at some parts.
84;the plot is a little thin and pretty predictable, but the kid is very appealing and the story is well told.
85;He's a likeable kid, and you feel good for him when he gets admitted to the school.
86;First of all I want to say that the story is very good.
87;But also a good film because you can see the history of the mine workers.
88;also I want to say that the conflict between Billy's father and Billy is a normal situation in a family.
89;It's funny for the whole family.
90;A tough but sympathetic ballet teacher helps him achieve enough finesse to audition at the Royal Ballet in London, but he must also overcome his father's and his brother's objections.
91;jamie Bell, who plays Billy, is delighful and a very good dancer as well.
92;His infrequently seen smile transforms his entire face.
93;Billy Elliot encompasses the range of human emotions, a significant period in modern history, cultural accuracy, music, ballet and a triumphant ending.
94;The actors are extraordinary, especially the 11 year old lead actor.
95;I saw Billy Elliot on television recently and was so moved by it that I ordered it on Amazon.
96;Of everyone I know who has seen this film, they all absolutely loved it.
97;i popped it in,watched it,and fell in love with it.
98;it's a lovely film that you shouldn't miss out on seeing.
99;jerker, brilliant performances all round.
100;This film is absolutely wonderful.
101;I enjoyed every minute and every aspect of it, from the performances to the depressing scenery and terraced housing of Billy's town.
102;He grabs on to his talent and lets him take him amazing places.You know you're watching a true British film when 1) There's a miners' strink involved and 2) when you have to put on the subtitles to understand you're own language because the northern accents are so thick that you can't understand them as well without them.
103;I truly love this movie and I hope that you'll give it a chance.
104;He found the courage to push everyone aside and go the distance.
105;I thought that Center Stage was a good movie filled with dancing and such, but Billy Elliot is better in my opinion because it shows that guys can have a passion to dance even more that girls.
106;this is a fine movie.
107;But that's not the point: It is still a good film if it can move you.
108;The ending was absolutely stunning and beautiful.
109;It is always SO refreshing to get the opportunity to watch a British film when you are overfed with all this Hollywood stuff which is basicly always the same.
110;Especially the British humour is a LOT more original (and in fact FUNNY!)
111;one genre the Brits are excellent in is socialrealistic films.
112;It's an 11 year old boy, living in a lower class family without a mother, in a mining town.
113;He's got this enormous natural talent for dancing .
114;even though it's a good film, with a good story and excellent acting, Billy Elliot doesn't reach the level of e. g.
115;still, it's really worth a go!
116;When you need a pick me up BILLY really delivers!
117;Beautiful and moving performances by all involved.
118;The little kid (Jamie Bell) in the lead is absolutely stunning!
119;The dance scene on the rooftop with his brother watching is unforgetable.
120;Luckily a dance teacher notices his gift and helps him move forward despite it all.
121;Uplifting movie magic with a terrific soundtrack to tap your feet by!By the way, forget about the R rating moms and dads.
122;Kids should see such a delightful film showing a little boy following his dreams.
123;Watch along to explain some of the language.
124;Movie came pkgd great and in good shape.
125;Was really nice to watch Billy again as I have always loved this movie since it came out.
126;The ending of this movie is just the best!
127;This was my wife's favorite movie, and I totally expected a pseudo.
128;This movie I ordered online and got it the day it was out.
129;I very much enjoyed this movie.
130;With just enough funny monments salted into the mixture to take the sting out of the overall heavyness of the place and time in which Billy lives.
131;You will walk out of this movie feeling great!
132;It is one of those Anything is possible type films that is well worth your time
133;I was very impressed by it.
134;We watch this film in class, and it has a great message.
135;It is a good film to discuss gender stereotypes and social norms.
136;And the students seem to enjoy it.
137;It is a very heart warming story about the true drive within each of us, the wisdom of others to see it, and the love of a father and son to bring change to themselves and others
138;super cool movietrue events in the moviethe acting fantastic and billy was absolutely the very best of the best
139;He makes this decision while his family is out on strike, which puts even more pressure on the situation.
140;Although Billy himself is not gay, one of his friends in the town is.
141;Julie Walters does a nice job as the local ballet teacher who helps Billy to audition for the Royal Ballet.
142;Very nicely done movie but I can't say that huge new artistic ground was covered here.
143;We've seen many movies with similar plots and themes done equally as well.
144;Compelling story, good acting, excellent filming.
145;Billy's father
146;This is a feel good story, but I thought it was done in a believable way.
147;After all the wonderful things I heard about this movie, I was really excited to see it.
148;good movie, but I don't think it's deserving of all the acclaim that it's gotten.
149;It is a very well crafted piece of art.
150;the film is about the human spirit and the motivations to excel and to experience life fully.
151;Billy is a young boy who becomes entranced with dance, an art form that allows him to express his emotions and experience a deeper connection with himself.
152;Billy's mother has died and this boy interested in dance must survive in a highly tense highly aggressive home and neighborhood.
153;Jamie Bell plays the role to perfection and deserves incredible credit for being able to carry off this lead role with such fine acting skills and ability to become the character Billy Elliot before our eyes.
154;the film is also about his dance teacher and mentor, played perfectly by the wonderful actress Julie Walters.
155;She is the perfect mentor, pressing the student when he needs to be pressed but recognizing that for every step she takes, he must also make a step.
156;Walters is an incredible actress, being able to be vulnerable and controlled at the same time.
157;She recognizes that the role she has taken on in regard to Billy's budding talent is that of protector and teacher and that at some point he will move beyond her if her work is done.
158;Walters embodies and channels this aspect of the mentor perfectly.
159;gary Lewis is superb as Jackie Elliot, Billy's father.
160;excellent in every way, this tale is about the growth of the human spirit but thoughtfully explores the roles of those who facilitate that growth.
161;I just saw this on the OWN channel and it was so good.
162;the story is sweet and done in the british way and it held my interest.
163;I won't spoil it for anyone but it was beautifully done!!!!
164;Truly touching and mesmerizing, this film extends past boundaries.
165;oriented film due to language, it offers a very in.
166;Performances are touching and magical and the script couldn't be better.
167;I had a little trouble understanding the accents (Irish I believe) but was able to follow along.
168;good movie I watched it quite a few times and it is such a good movie and well done sweet
169;I was please with the service.
170;it is the best movie i have ever seen.
171;the acting was sensational i have never seen a starbeing able to change his expressions so quickly.
172;it was a brilliant performance by jamie bell.
173;the movie also deserves the oscar for best film.
174;if i never get anthing else in my life i will be so happy when i get it.
175;need i say more the talent of this young man is enerimous and i am sure we will see a lot more of him yours charles
176;Beginning with an exuberant title sequence, this charming, offbeat, coming.
177;old becomes enthralled by the girls' dancing class, led by a chain.
178;He loves watching Fred Astaire in old movies and is instantly drawn towards the ballet class, but when his macho father and rabble.
179;stompin' I Want to Boogie sequence.
180;what makes this heartfelt English import such a gem is the collaboration of screenwriter Lee Hall, cinematographer Brian Tufano ( Trainspotting ) and former stage director Stephen Daldry ( An Inspector Calls ), who .
181;create eccentric, lovable characters and evocative imagery.
182;One haunting sequences focuses on a little neighborhood girl dragging a stick along a brick wall, which dissolves into a phalanx of plastic police shields.
183;While some of the authentic, heavily accented dialogue may be indecipherable to some, the musical soundtrack, combining classical and pop, is terrific.
184;tender, and Julie Walters ( Educating Rita ) scores as Billy's crusty yet compassionate teacher.
185;Jamie Draven and Stuart Wells lend strong support.
186;On the `Lund Movie Scale' of 1 to 10, Billy Elliot is an exhilarating 9.
187;Combining comedy and poignancy, it's all about being able to express yourself.
188;directed by Stephen Daldry and Written by Lee Rich brings a well made Dramatic Comedy in this Coming of Age film.
189;Jamie Bell brings a Expectional Performance in this and also Julie Walters shines as Billy`s Chain Smoking Mentor.
190;This is a Clever, Often Touching film.
191;Jamie Bell's performance as Billy Elliot is pure magic.
192;As the coal miners son who wants to dance, who discovers ballet, and has to overcome the prejudices of his father and brother, both embittered and disillusioned by the violence of the coal miners strike in the UK in the early 80's, this will go down as one of the great performances, in one of the great films, on the theme of the little guy triumphing over adversity to live his dream.
193;There were tears in my eyes almost from the opening, as we are transported on this journey of hope and courage in the face of adversity told from the perspective of a little boy.
194;It tells the story of the extraordinary within a world and life of great simplicity.
195;and there is the magic!
196;Jamie Bell will be nominated for the Oscar.
197;but this performance is a gift to us all.
198;I cried like a little girl!
199;It is a wonderful story about a boy who does everything to achieve his dream of being a ballet dancer.
200;Kids at the age of eight could see this movie if you don't mind them hearing the F word every two minutes.
201;this movie is an excellent example of people going after their dreams.
202;I might as well come right out and say it.
203;I think it's cute and sweet and it made me feel happy when I left the theatre.
204;it is a very powerful movie because it gives out this inspiration, motivation, little push to change your life if you are caught up with the situation/circumstances.
205;it was so close though,,).
206;This movie shows a burning desire of a boy, (hold it right there!)
207;It speaks to that sense of dreaming in all of us.
208;Very well done and Billy Elliot will live forever in many hearts.
209;Julie Walters is very engaging and moved the emotion forward.
210;always looked forward to seeing it on tv now I can see it anytime.
211;Lovely film with a fantastic story,, but one question.
212;This is certainly the best movie I have ever seen !!
213;I came out of the cinema so happy, so complete.
214;I will always remember this film like a very good thing that happened in my life.
215;If you wants something, and are afraid of get it real, you MUST see it !!
216;Really a great movie, very refreshing compared to all the movies showing these days!
217;I have very much enjoyed this movie.
218;The story is the most heart.
219;warming and inspiring I have ever seen.
220;It's a film that manages to delight and inspire without treacly cliche and obvious sentimental drivel.
221;Creativity, individuality, art and personal drive must battle it out against tradition, family expectations, homophobia and economics.
222;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
223;The boy HAD TO dance!
224;hearted film, watch this movie.
225;You'll feel great!And besides, the dialogue is well written, the acting is great, and the filming is well done.
226;This movie is an uplifting movie .
227;This film is a real surprise.
228;The adult characters each have their own objectives in life and are so focused on their own needs and their own environment.
229;get ready for some serious low English accents, big laughs, superb dancing by this young unknown kid, and lots of big tears!
230;I watch it when I need a boost to support my kids' passions for life.
231;I watch this film everytime it is available.
232;I cry with tears of joy,sadness and shear gut emotion.
233;The father's and brother's understanding of what drives Billy is rare.
234;Billy Elliot gives a great example to the audience of how to live life.
235;In this movie, one English boy lives this everyday.
236;Jamie Walters, in her Oscar nominated role, plays his strong.
237;She will stop at nothing to help Elliot perfect his ballet moves.
238;The two, along with the rest of the cast, wonderfully portrays their characters.
239;stephan Daldry brilliantly directs this movie.
240;He's a genius at character's emotions.
241;He proves that he will be the next Steven Spielberg in a few years.
242;Billy Elliot's unique storyline will inspire the audience.
243;This film is a real winner.
244;Julie Walters is equally fine as Billy's sympathetic ballet teacher.
245;On a final note, I love the use of T. rex music on the soundtrack.
246;this delightful film just made me happy with its cheerful T. rex.
247;heavy soundtrack, exuberant performances, and quirky characters.
248;It's pretty clear how everything is going to turn out at the end, and some of the changes of heart undergone by certain character may not be entirely convincing, but this remains a sunny, upbeat film.
249;Despite the language, which earns it an R rating, it also presents a positive message for young people about being willing to think outside boundaries and resist stereotypes.
250;Was a joy to rediscover.
251;My son dressed up like Beauty(Belle from Beauty and The Beast.
252;The other day he got a superman toy and was putting a Barbie Shoe on it.
253;It is a film about economics and society, and how art is developed through frustration and need.
254;but with all that aside it is a truly entertaining and fabulous film.
255;Stephen Daldry, the reknowned theatre director, makes his debut here.
256;The direction is the thing that gives this it's guts.
257;This is a much better film than it needed to be.
258;julie Walters, Jaime Bell and Gary Lewis(such an amazing performance as the dAd).
259;The movie goes places that you don't expect, and thankfully, places you do.
260;It instantly touched my heart so deeply.
261;She was right and this film proves it.
262;An absolutely wonderful story that is superbly acted!
263;Can't say enough good about this film, especially how it illustrates the power and sometimes painful relationship played out between a traditional father and an atypical boy.
264;I had enjoyed it the first time, but this time I loved it.
265;The boy is fantastic, rightfully praised for a superb performance.
266;Actually, as far as that goes, the entire cast is great.
267;There are numerous small but crucial roles.
268;The entire family, of course, is crucial, but each actor makes the most of some very brief but moving scenes.
269;The father is magnificent, really perfect.
270;The teacher gives a rather restrained performance.
271;She is very good, though, especially with the cigarette ever dangling, which she makes a critical prop in the development of her character.
272;(It is nice to see a real smoker again.)
273;The teacher and Billy make a valiant effort to disassociate dance from gayness, but the last scene of the film, with the gays spotlighted in the audience, seems to suggest that the father and his friends were right after all.
274;This is a great movie .
275;The casting is excellent, settings are spot on and the storyline plausible.
276;i won't tell more so as not to spoil the storyline, but I'm sure you'll find the hour and 1/2 well spent.
277;Very nice movie however you really need to understand the background of the miners in the UK.
278;A lot of swearing though.
279;from the title sequence I knew something was up, they weren't ordinary, a kid bouncing up and down through the screen.
280;right off, the viewer finds great character development, with 11.
281;mate Michael, his dance teacher, Mrs wilkinson and her daughter, Debbie.
282;this film has greatly directed scenes that are composed like a master painter.
283;Scenes move artistically from one to the next.
284;Watch for the blend from the Fred Astaire movie clip moving right on screen to the scene with Grama and him as they go to visit Billy's mom's grave.
285;the story is well written.
286;The acting is dramatic and believable.
287;the music is worth getting the soundtrack.
288;The dancing scenes are just great, from the initial stumbling about with Mrs. Wilkinson, to serious artistry when Billy auditions at the Royal Ballet School.
289;i missed it at the theatre but found Billy Elliot , a real treasure, buried at my local video store.
290;I have had my eye on this movie!
291;if you havent seen it, It is a must see it will make you laugh an also pull at your heart strings.
292;It featured a little kid dancing on a roof being watched and/of laughed at by a little girl.
293;Sappy people, watch it it's exelent!
294;It is a good movie for a family with kids of age 6 .
295;Billy Elliott combines all the elements of a successful, satisfying movie: comedy and drama
296;Watching the relationship and understanding evolve between father and son is definitely the highlight of the movie.
297;It is not just for dance fans
298;the movie is great but you can barely hear the actors talking.
299;This is an all time feel good favorite go to for me.
300;It has dancing, boxing, working class politics, a miners strike, a cross dressing gay best friend and dancing!
301;Amazing performances all the way around, but especially Jamie Bell, Julie Waters and Gary Lewis as his Dad.
302;And a really amazing soundtrack.
303;good story to encourage anyone to follow their dreams no matter what people think.
304;loved every min of it
305;And on the box, Mark Salisbury, said it was Funny.
306;The movie was just as good and very moving.
307;Loved the bit about Billy's and his father's trip to London for the audition.
308;I find this a really engaging film that I can watch frequently.
309;The photography and direction are excellent.
310;(This seems to be a characteristic of many British films)Some reviewer I've read calls it (the whole story) funny.
311;There are certainly many scenes which are downright funny.
312;The action overall is handled with a very light, easily watched spirit .
313;he really is a fine actor.
314;The film, the basis for the hit musical, stands on its own as a great film.
315;The superb cast convey well the socio.
316;The film is about life, told in a touching way that isn't sappy.
317;The end gets me all misty everytime.
318;Remarkable performances by young actors .
319;I read this review and thought it was great : [.]
320;good' movie of the year.
321;warming, inspiring, sweet and funny, Billy Elliot, directed by Stephen Daldry, was the thing at that time.
322;Coming from a family of miners who strive to get by, he discovers he likes to dance more than he wants to box and be like his dad and older brother.
323;Essentially, the film is a coming of age story, a story of being brave enough to be yourself and how fun and difficult the road to discovery is.
324;All that's good and nice.
325;The best thing about Billy Elliot, though, is how easily, passionately and truthfully it manages to convey the liberating feeling of dance.
326;there are a lot of Hollywood films that try to show how glamorous but hard, exhilarating but spirit.
327;And it's the story of a dancer we're watching, above everything else.
328;billy Elliot succeeds so well in showcasing how much Billy overcomes in his effort to become a dancer because the film is set, very strategically, during the miners' strike of the 1980s.
329;Again, many films deal with how ballet is considered a `high art' and the struggles to blend it with today's pop culture .
330;By the end of the film, Billy's family is still, pretty much, the same in terms of class and even Billy keeps his northern accent.
331;What's so special about Billy Elliot is that this is consistently done throughout the film.
332;And the film cleverly uses not only the politics of the era but, also, the soundtrack in order to connect Billy's rawness when dancing with the hard times his family is going through.
333;From T. Rex's Children of the Revolution to probably one of the most gripping and creative tap dance scenes ever to grace a film, choreographed to The Jam's A Town Called Malice, Billy Elliot is all about how dancing can be a creative outburst in times of turmoil and trouble.
334;billy Elliot is an exciting film to watch, as unique as its protagonist.
335;The film's cinematography is gritty and fresh, though nostalgic, its script humorous and thoughtfully emotional, its characters interesting and real, even though imagined.
336;Above all, Billy Elliot is an extraordinary dance film as it doesn't use dance just as another metaphor for the American dream.
337;Billy Elliot knows exactly what it feels to only be able to express yourself through dance and the freedoms that dance allows you, at that moment.
338;It's a film that lets everyone know the truth about dance.
339;my fafourite character is Billy?s best friend Michael .
340;and I loved to see him again, years later, at that Swan Lake performance.
341;This was a fantastic movie.
342;It had a really good message and the story was wonderful!!
343;The acting and dialogue was magnificent!!
344;This inspiring story of a young boy's passion to dance and to become a dancer is a must for young and old.
345;This is one you can watch over and over and never tire of it!
346;The son instead discovers he is both more interested in and has a talent for ballet and uses his father's money for ballet lessons, lying to his father about what he is doing.
347;I haven't seen a movie as uplifting and inspiring as Billy Elliot in years.
348;Hope this young actor continues to produce such great movies.
349;I was a ballet and dance performer in high school when this film first came out, and it struck me as one of the most genuine movies since.
350;this film is honest in several key areas.
351;this film is true and honest to that passion
352;influenced audiencemember, you're bound to appreciate every conflict, frustration, denial and accomplishment that is so masterfully displayed on screen.
353;Filled with scenes that will bring any family audience closer together, this film is truly as honest and heartfelt as they come.
354;The heart and soul of the characters come alive in this film.
355;The dance numbers and the music capture you and make you want to join in and fly with Billy.
356;You are transported to this place and take part in the lives of the people there.
357;One of the best films I have enjoyed in a long while.
358;The passion in Billy to dance is outstanding.
359;It may sound ridiculous, but it is true!
360;Jamie Bell is destined to stardom.
361;I will be very happy if Mr. Bell is nominated for an Oscar, but the film will most likely be over.
362;The dancing is great and the music is very enjoyable.
363;All in all, a fantastic lil' gem, especially for the holiday season!
364;Billy Elliot is British theatrical director Stephen Daldry's film debut, and what a seamless crossover.
365;Despite his youth, Bell gives a top.
366;this is a story of a family in a mining town in north England during a strike in 1984.
367;That's enough plot information
368;The movie contains drama without sensationalism, much humor, and of course music and dance
369;And surprisingly, the T Rex.
370;based soundtrack fits in perfectly.
371;I was prepared to love this film when I read the descriptions, and with one minor exception, my wish was fulfilled.
372;This is a compelling story of a young boy's courage to pursue his dream, despite its being completely antithetical to the cultural expectations of the town in which he lived.
373;In spite of enormous social pressure and a disapproving father, Billy persists in his dream to become a ballet dancer and emerges triumphant.
374;The incredible pressure to be what one is expected to be is pitted elegantly against the unyielding desire to pursue one's ambitions.
375;The film does an excellent job of developing various characters and making us love them, foibles and all.
376;In his film debut he is mesmerizing, both in his acting and dance performances.
377;Bell always found exactly the right emotion to portray Billy's conflicts, disappointments and stubborn persistence.
378;Bell is the keystone that holds the entire film together and he is the reason it succeeds so completely.
379;the ensemble supporting Bell is also first rate as is the direction of Stephen Daldry.
380;Daldry gives the story that quaint small town British feel, full of brutal honesty and simple human truths.
381;Daldry's greatest success is in the pure sincerity of the actors' performances making every frame realistic and convincing, and earning him an Oscar nomination for best director in only his second film.
382;Julie Walters, also nominated for best supporting actress, does a fine job as the tough and determined ballet teacher, and Gary Lewis gives a standout performance as Billy's dad.
383;this is an inspirational film that is just a hair short of perfect.
384;Nonetheless, it is one of the most compelling and uplifting films of the year with a positive and upbeat message that is sure to capture your heart.
385;I'd recommend this movie to mostly adults.
386;The language is hard to overlook at times, but the movie in itself is worth a viewing.
387;I had seen a few previews, and now after viewing it .
388;it has become one of my most favorites.
389;But Billy has a strong will and stands by his dream to become a dancer.
390;the camera moves fit perfectly to the scenes presented and create a perfect atmosphere for the watcher.
391;just like the music that is in this case important, because if you listen very carefully to the text of the songs you can connect it with the plot of the scenes.
392;It is especially important when Billy dances to it, for example in the scene in which he encounters his father in the sports club and Billy wants to show him that he can, wants and will dance.
393;the actors are very well chosen.
394;And that is also true for the other actors like July Walters as Mrs Wilkinson or Gary Lewis as Jackie Elliot, the strict father who succeeds in overcoming his inhibitions to help Billy's dream of dancing come true.
395;But in the end almost everybody liked it.
396;And the movie is a very good example of the idea that everybody can fulfil his dreams if he has the will and ambition to do so.
397;the performances are solid, Jamie Bell a find, the father great.
398;want to see a great movie with the same themes get 'Kes'.
399;It's gratifying to see such a realistic prioritizing of police resources on film and the comforting knowledge of the tax payer's money well spent.
400;Unlike the ending to 'Kes' which leaves the audience basking in the warm glow of their own undoubtedly justified prejudices, 'Billy Elliot' leaves us suspicious and distrustful at it's challenge to the natural order.
401;Scenes of poverty, such as the little blond girl with her rag doll, who stands outside the council houses, add a gritty reality to a wonderful, heartwarming, inspiring and passionate movie.
402;One of the best movies of 2000 and accompanied by a really powerful soundtrack, this is a highly recommended movie to watch again and again.
403;There is very little that struck me as truly original, although I enjoyed the scene when Billy's elder brother is chased by police about the mining town and he simply knows that every front and back door is going to be unlocked.
404;there are one or two very touching scenes .
405;and you know you've been set up for them, but they're endearing nonetheless.
406;This is without doubt the best film of 2000 and, for me, the best I have seen in a very long time.
407;Newcomer Jamie Bell has that rare talent few actors have of making you very concerned about what happens to the character they play.
408;For me it captures beautifully the pain of being at odds with those around you, and the determination to succeed in the face of adversity.
409;The supporting cast is superb, with very powerful and emotional performances.
410;I have seen this film no less than 5 times at the cinema and enjoyed it as much every time.
411;There are many parts to this movie that capture your imagination, but the scene where Billy's brother Tony confronts his father at the pit, when he crosses the picket line, is simply one of the most emotionally charged scenes I have ever seen, in any film, and it stayed with me long after I first saw it, I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes well acted and true to life British drama.
412;When you find a story line that impacts your thoughts and attitude.
413;Billy Elliot has a great story line about acceptance and unconditional love between a Father and Son.
414;I fully accept that kids use 4.
415;( A Home of Our Own )*One last lingering look at the old homeplace.
416;i wish I knew what kind of success this movie had here in Texas.
417;Jamie Bell was fantastic as Billy.
418;many very touching moments in the film.
419;This one richly deserved all the praise it received.
420;mining town in Northern England during a miner's strike, it is the story of a boy (brilliantly played by Jamie Bell) whose natural talent for dance unfairly characterizes him as gay.
421;But his persistence wins over not only his family, but the striking miners, as well.
422;This is a terrific MovieThe movie was listed as Used Very good condition I would rate it as Like new condition!
423;This was one of the most touching movies I have seen for a log time.
424;Young Jamie Bell is a natural.
425;He really is the young boy, perfectly normal who only has a bit of an unusual hobby.
426;the second theme, much more under.
427;emphasized is the sheer desparation in a small English miners village, where the effects of the Tatcher government is taking it's toll.
428;This drives a probaly perfectly harmonious community to take sides against each other which can only be separated by the police.
429;It is heartbraking to see when he finally makes his choice and breaks the picket
430;this is cinema non plus ultra!
431;Chocholat got in the way of Billy Elliot in the Oscar race this year and , as a result one of 2000's best movies got less press.
432;Stephen Daldry's film is one of the best british movies i ever seen .
433;Equally funny yet surely most touching than The Full Monty , Billy Elliot tells the story of a kid whose family life takes some stormy turns when he starts ballet lessons instead of taking box trainings like his father desires.
434;It's not only Jamie Bell who is excellent in the title role or Julie Walters who won an Oscar nomination ( the least the academy could do ) for her perfomance as Billy's teacher .
435;It's also Gary Lewis who shinnes as the gifted boy's father or even smaller parts like the grandmother and the brother which makes this movie as great as it is.
436;Is amazing, really beautifull, it works great :P.
437;It is a movie about being a good dad, about how a community comes together, about mentoring and love.
438;It is funny and dramatic sometimes.
439;Billy Elliot is surely one of the best films ever made.
440;this film is a brilliant gem of cinema, with charm, warmth, andhilariously funny.
441;the actors give a sterling performance and endear themselves tothe viewer.
442;billy Elliot is one of the best films ever made.
443;And With Jamie Bell Doing All His Own Dancing Is Also A Great Plus.
444;I rated it 4 stars just because It Was Somewhat Confusing At Times.
445;The Editing From Scene To Scene was marvelous As Well
446;I'd recommend It To anyone.
447;One More Thing Its Rated R ONLY For some swearing, But I think it would be Perfect for pre.
448;I work in a Movie theatre so I get to watch movies and I went into that movie on my Break even though it was he same part a lot of the time I still went into it because it was that compelling.
449;See it Learn from it Love it.
450;:)With Care To Everyone, I wish you all the best of life NOW AND FOREVER.
451;my sister is a dancer and she loved it.
452;it was a great gift for her she really enjoyed the story line
453;This movie will make you laugh and cry.
454;It's about a working class family in Northern England who's youngest family member just wants to dance.
455;And he will dance right into your heart.
456;I won't spoil it by telling the story line so please watch for yourself and enjoy as much as I did.
457;The movie, Billy Elliot is absoultely great!!!
458;the movie is really touching!actors are really great, especially, Jamie Bell(Billy Elliot).
459;Billy Elliot is a magical movie.
460;the young man playing Billy is perfect.
461;I would say this is a perfect movie.
462;Simply because Billy Elliot is a modern masterpiece.
463;BILLY ELLIOT is a stunning piece of filmmaking and should NEVER be missed.
464;A young lad decides he likes ballet better than boxing.
465;in the best sense of the word.
466;On the eve of Father's Day, this is a great movie to celebrate fathers for Billy's father grows and changes and come to appreciate his son's great talent.
467;The poignant ending still makes my eyes water.
468;what makes this movie even more meaningful is that it is based on a real little boy's experience.
469;Additionally, I read recently that for the first time ever the Royal Ballet has more young men enrolled than young girls and all because of this great little movie.
470;You'll want to see it again and again.
471;Stephen Daldry made a charming and engaging movie with this personal portrait about a boy who was born to dance in the middle of a miner village in Durham.
472;after the initial attempts, his steeled stubbornness will launch to capture the vital essence of his dreams against all the odds.
473;haunting, exciting and tender, the movie will catch you from start to finish.
474;Superb cast and flawless script will make the full round to become it a legendary status as one of the most reminded cult movies of the nineties.
475;This movie is a pleasant shock to me.
476;So it's not only a boy's success story but also a conflict story of his father between his devotion for labor movement against rich.
477;fights, Billy Elliot generates an emotional high, simply from a plain, ordinary family living life with such great intensity, that it makes one want to cry at the happy ending.
478;The fact that the movie is English and you are not familiar with the cast makes the movie totally believable.
479;One is not blinded by the celebrity of the actors and makes it easy to accept the ordinariness of the family, which is vital to the dynamics of the movie.
480;Want to replace the amount of blood shed for an equal amount of tears, both happy and sad?
481;This movie is for you.
482;does the perfect movie exist?
483;From its brilliant casting, to clever cinematography to .
484;foot stomping choreography, this movie has got it all.
485;The freshness and originality of Billy Elliot almost jumps off the screen.
486;They take great risks by using untried scriptwriters, directors and young actors and somehow have produced a string of fabulous movies.
487;the plot of Billy Elliot is simple enough
488;Against opposition from his father and elder brother, young Billy discovers himself and his talents.
489;trodden school of gritty, British social realism, best expressed by Ken Loach of Cathy Come Home fame.
490;Although mostly set in a working class world, the direction and camera work captures scenes of outstanding beauty.
491;the film's Director of Photography, Brian Tufano, has been quoted as saying, .
492;She nonchalantly rattles a stick along the shields and then she passes behind a parked police van.
493;Despite the drama and action in this scene, it has an almost comic touch, with the soundtrack giving us The Clash doing London Calling.
494;in the reconciliation scene between Billy and his Dad, we see the two of them perched on a fence.
495;When we see the two of them wrestling and laughing in the cornfield, we are reminded that truly emotionally moving scenes in movies are possible without relying on Hollywood's formulaic schmaltz.
496;the blending of classical and contemporary music throughout the movie, both as a setting for the dance routines and as background music is natural and seamless.
497;The climactic final scene, which is set 14 years later, has Billy debuting in a starring role in the Royal Ballet's Swan Lake.
498;billy Elliot is a film that appeals at many levels, but the best recommendation is to just sit back and enjoy one of the best movies you will see in a long time.
499;A beautiful social commentary on dance, masculinity, and poverty.
500;There are several great moments of dance that incorporate ballet, jazz, and traditional Irish elements.
501;The film also touches on transcending class.
502;As they show the final shots of the townspeople who we get to know, you get a very strong sense of where the experience of this film leaves them.
503;Great use of atmosphere, identical to The Full Monty (a must.
504;see if you loved this film).
505;Watch this film with friends or family, and discuss it afterwards.
506;If you dance you'll like this movie.
507;It really is a good movie for children to watch.
508;This film paints a great picture of how staying true to one's self can be difficult, but worth it.
509;The lead character is perfectly cast, and the dialogue is tough, gritty, and real.
510;dance' to be an exceptionally strong scene .
511;a tremendous release from the tension caused by Billy's situation.
512;Movies like this provide the very best response to art .
513;the transcendence of the human spirit.
514;A middle or working class lifestyle.
515;Mesh all of these on screen, and you get Billy Elliot .
516;Set in 1984 England, it's a simple story of a boy who loves to dance, discovers he's got a talent for it, secretly learns how to dance, perfects his dance, and lives through (in the most childlike yet percociously adult way possibly) a series of trials (ie., townspeople's and families angry reactions) and achieves greatness.
517;But it is a greatness that brings perceptions in line
518;It's a great story, with solid acting.
519;I really like the character who portrayed Billy: he was a real emotional and solid character that you really had to enjoy.
520;the one pleasant surprise was that he didn't quit boxing because of an injury or peer pressure for the most part.
521;One of the best, and most underappreciated films of the last Oscar season is Billy Elliot.
522;warming story combined with a crackerjack cast makes for a highly entertaining and film that totally transcends struggle and celebrates human desire.
523;billy, so magnificently and perfectly played by Jamie Bell, is a working class kid with a penchant for ballet, discovered quite by accident but soon fuels his dreams.
524;the story in the film is a guaranteed winner, but soon transcends itself as it deals with devotion to dreams, selflessness, and the power of teaching and learning.
525;This is my favorite film of all time, even before Casablanca and other great movies.
526;I send it as a gift to friends, especially new ones who want to know me better.
527;I wasn't too sure how I would enjoy a story about a 13 y/o boy but right from the start I was hooked on it.
528;Billy Elliot takes place at time and place that give the story a powerful background and places it deep in to the culture of the English working class.
529;The characters feel real, the music is great, the dancing is full of energy and the plot keeps you in the story.
530;Billy's family is fully of love shown in the caring they have for each another and the lengths they will go to support one another.
531;I highly reccomend this movie to anyone that likes a good ending.
532;It is great for the whole family.
533;This is a 'feel good' drama about a boy who likes to dance in an English coal mining town in the 1980's.
534;This was a defining moment in British industrial relations, and its defeat significantly weakened the British trade union movement.
535;Their beloved wife and mother died the year before.
536;The movie is actually shot in the real County Durham, UK.
537;Cinematographer Brian Tufano does a magnificent job of depicting the beauty of the local, with its quaint brick houses and nearby green fields.
538;The threat of explosive violence is a constant throughout the movie, even with its wonderfully upbeat, and frequent comic moments.
539;He is fascinated, however, by the ballet class which is being taught at the same gym.
540;He forces Billy to give up the class.
541;She seems to come alive while working with the budding dancer.
542;She pours her emotions into his training, and encourages him to audition for the Royal Ballet School.
543;the film's suspense peaks during the day of Billy's audition where multiple things happen at once .
544;director Stephen Daldry really focuses on the relationship, the strong bonds of love, between father and son.
545;Daldry assembled a wonderful cast, which brings to life the struggles and triumphs of Lee Hall's script.
546;The musical/dance montages are magical.
547;Passion and love for dance permeate the film.
548;Jamie Bell is phenomenal in the title role.
549;He gives a riveting, sensitive, dynamic performance.
550;The show was/is extraordinary and the movie does not disappoint.
551;love this story and the dancing in the movie is wonderful.
552;actors are perfect in the roles.
553;good old fashioned wisdom in this film.
554;The fact that it is based on a true story was remarkable !
555;Saw the movie couple a yrs ago and loved it.
556;We love the human element of the movie, the love of dancing and thepassion with which it is achieved.
557;Loved this the first time I saw it when it came out and loved the musical version, Billy Elliot, The Musical.
558;This film breaks your heart, then fills it up again with the hope that young Billy Elliot can indeed make a better life for himself far from his British mining town.
559;jamie Bell is an unrefined gem, raw and energetic in the title role, and this film's exploration of gender roles is handled with exquisite taste and sensitivity, gently mocking stereotypes but also offering touching examples of courage and grace from unexpected sources.
560;Tacked on, perhaps, to give a sense of closure (complete with all.
561;Definitely one worth adding to the collection.
562;It still wets my eyes when I portrait the father's shivering lips when he sat in the ballet theatre watching on the stage and the very son of his, flied out from the side a beautiful swan, high in the air, wildly expressive and immensely powerful.
563;It expresses passion and love, like many of the other movies try to capture, with its unique and tender caress, over the most realistic people and their simple lives.
564;My heart goes to Billy Elliot, the boy, the family, the movie and its most invincible passion and love, of all.
565;His father and older brother are both participants in a bitter miner's strike gripping their town in northeastern England.
566;The whole family is also still in recovery.
567;*** Billy's exuberance and talent (and actor Jamie Bell's) are such a joy to behold.
568;It makes it all the more poignant when he has to face his dad and brother's discovery of his dancing (as the audience knows they must).
569;Billy is the title hero here, but by the film's end, every character has made their own stunning contributions.
570;GREAT Movie, historically accurate and a thought provoker.
571;The Broadway Musical by Elton John is even better and a must see.
572;definitely makes you think (I love movies that make me think).
573;Yes, the stakes are raised SO high that one has no other choice but to cheer loudly for the hero.
574;Viewing this movie was one of the ultimate pleasures of my life.
575;It is beautiful, funny, heartwarming, tear.
576;Jamie Bell gives one of the best child performances to date.
577;The film is so well shot and so well edited that even the slower parts flow brilliantly with the rest of the film.
578;I am a voting member of the Academy, and this was my pick for Best Picture (certainly more enjoyable than Gladiator).
579;This movie is The Full Monty times 10!
580;A friend from Ireland recommended this movie to me, as it had touched him deeply.
581;The acting job by Jamie Bell is superb .
582;The accents are hard to understand, but it is worth putting the effort into it.
583;This story should touch your heart in a very special way .
584;I found such uninformed reviews about this movie that I have to respond.
585;move on to one of Arnold's movies .
586;this movie moves me and my students etc that I recommend it to all!
587;There are a few early scenes that show Billy's discovery of ballet that really are something special, but even these are cross cut with shots showing the police quelling a worker's rebellion.
588;He's filling in as hope for an entire community here.
589;The film achieves its successes in the small moments of personal discovery
590;There's a good supporting performance by Julie Waters.
591;The rest of the cast is fine if unexceptional.
592;This is a movie that I intend to watch again and again.
593;this film shows these struggles in a pleasing way.
594;It has a delightful cast and a wonderful ending.
595;Billy is a wonderfully happy and energetic boy with a great talent.
596;This movie is uplifting but realistic and I suggest for audiences over 14.
597;But I was pleasantly surprised.
598;the story has a great message of being yourself, and following your dreams.
599;It's basically saying that no one knows what's best for you except yourself
600;jamie Bell was excellent as the title character.
601;showing an impressive range of emotions.
602;The rest of the cast was superb as well.
603;And an unexpected surprise like Billy's supposed gay friend, just makes the movie more complex and interesting!The ending was memorable as well, but I won't give it away.You won't be disappointed in this movie, even if you're a macho man who's too insecure to think it's okay for boys to dance!
604;I still recommend this movie highly(there are also some wonderful surreal elements to the story,such as when Billy's girlfriend innocently runs a stick across a line of riot policemen as if they were a picket fence)
605;It is very touching, and quite humorous in spite of the serious issues.
606;This is my favorite movie of all time!!
607;Jamie Bell is precious as Billy and a great character study.
608;Amazingly a film which was profiled as being The Film of the Year which actually lived up to its reputation as a powerful, humorous, gritty and sentimental drama about courage, determination and a desire to succeed despite non.
609;I've seen this film twice and I find something new in it each time, whether it is the stirring scenes with Billy as he struggles for acceptance or the impassioned hatred of those returning to work in what are extremely realistic scenes from the Miners' Strike.
610;to go any further would ruin the ending but this is a fantastic picture with a wonderful soundtrack, see it if only for the epic chase scene involving Billy's brother and the police to the tune of London Calling from The Clash.
611;This is truly fantastic and justifies itself as one of the films of the year.
612;nchored by Bell's soulful lead performance, Billy Elliot is an intelligent, often humorous coming.
613;class sensibilities, but the main focus of this exhilarating story concerns Billy's efforts to translate raw talent into self.
614;An irresistible mix of fancy footwork and feel.
615;This is a wonderful story about a young boy with a dream of becoming a dancer.
616;He starts at the bottom and works his way all the way to the top!
617;I had the rare treat of seeing the reincarnation of the movie Billy Elliot as a musical in the falls of 2005 and 2006 in London's West End where it is a huge hit.
618;For me it is one of the best works of the last decade.
619;With a variety of musical styles by Elton John the stage show is a masterful production finally to be produced in the U. s. in the fall of 2008.
620;The movie itself is a skillfully crafted work, highly original, affecting, and perfectly cast.
621;The police are as much symbolic and iconic as they are real, and act as a mute chorus to the action throughout the movie.
622;old Billy is a superb dancer, who is given masculine, very original pieces to interpret.
623;His acting is equally brilliant.
624;The dance teacher played to the hilt by Julie Walters is a tour de force performance.
625;There's sentimentality, but it's humanity that triumphs here.
626;this is a brilliant, highly innovative, pioneering film.
627;The ending with adult dancer Adam Cooper is truly memorable, a heart stopper for those familiar with Matthew Bourne's great work for male dancers.
628;I was pulled in right away!
629;i was really impressed with the story around Billy.
630;when he found ballet, he approached it from a very powerful, athletic view, and didn't seem the boy one would typically place in a ballet boy box.
631;While he is not overly handsome, he is believable.
632;He is caring and attractive, sensitive and wants to please, but can't.
633;He wants them to understand him, and they can't.
634;the friendship with a gay classmate is wonderful.
635;He really care about the boy, isn't actively pursuing him.
636;He portrays a boy, being a boy, who also happens to be a good dancer.
637;If you are looking for a strong willed boy, fighting to survive and be himself, and winning in the end, this it is.
638;i truly loved the movie more that I thought I would.
639;i was really impressed with the passion of the young actor playing Billy.
640;A really touching story, and it was great seeing his dad becoming more of a man by letting his son follow his heart, and letting him dance.
641;thank you for such a good, honest, heartwarming movie.
642;I'm sure all will love it too!
643;I would highly recommend this movie to those who have seen the musical.
644;Exceptionally good acting and display of exceptional emotion by a fourteen year old actor.
645;Great story and will have your toe tapping and your heart urging Billy on.
646;This is a great but great movie that I like it since the first time.
647;The music, the boy it take you to that moment of discover his vocation and fight for it.
648;It is a great movie to se with your family and understand that everything is possible.
649;Jamie Bell is pure magic in this wonderful coming.0f. age film that tells the story of a working class English lad who takes up ballet as a way to hone his boxing skills.
650;both technical and moral .
651;What ensues is a dramatic comedy that inspires us at every turn without condescension or pity.
652;The heartening interaction that develops between father and son is truly evocative, especially so for anyone who ever followed (or didn't) their dreams despite their family's objections.
653;All of this is handled in a mature, thoughtful manner, which makes the film a visceral, haunting experience.
654;it's rare for a movie to challenge social mores and values by focusing on the dominant male principals.
655;But Billy Elliot succeeds on more levels than other underdog.
656;First, its based on a true story and resonates with truth, integrity and spirit.
657;And, Bell's brash, authentic portrayal is pure magic.
658;he dances in the street, mimmicking Gene Kelly, and in the process taps his way into your heart.
659;The performance is so accomplished it's a wonder Bell didn't receive an Oscar nomination.
660;This is a film your entire family can and should enjoy.
661;mining town will help them appreciate this wonderful heartwarming film.
662;This was a great movie and I thought that Jamie Bell deserved a nod as the title character who learns to express himself through dance even though he has to hide that fact that he is dancing from his father and the rest of his family.
663;Julie Walters deserved her best supporting nod as the tough chain smoking dance instructer who sees the potential in Billy and tries to help him realize it.
664;This one of the movies that make you go through the gambit of emotions.
665;It makes you laugh, cry, think, and at the end make you feel good about yourself.
666;An amazing film that should be shown in every grade school in the country.
667;Alternate futures are something we seldom think of .
668;My English Prof made us watch Billy Elliot in class, and I have to say this is an excellent film.
669;Everything in this film has a purpose from the music to the usage of steel.
670;This film evokes so much emotion that it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes it so great.
671;Even before he learns to dance, he has a rhythm to the way he moves.
672;And one day, he finds that he can dance, and has great potiental.
673;Through love and hope, eventually his family changes their world to allow his to go after his dream.
674;This is a really heart warming movie of a young boy, who had rather do ballet, than play soccer, or other boys games.
675;and in the end, he lives his dream.
676;Family healing is also involved in this film, and is quite uplifting.
677;A fine story about perusing a dream.
678;The ticket office clerk said `It's a beautiful movie', and yes, he was perfectly right.
679;first of all, a solid acting of the lead of Billy Elliot and some good moves from father Eliot.
680;The story line is interesting and not banal.
681;In overall, the director's feel of reality and proportion is what that make the film so well.
682;great' fanfarous finale, which feels fine, although audience might have wanted to see Billy playing the prince, not a swan in the episode with the `Swan Lake', but this is just a minor detail, maybe designed to underline the consistency of the likable good character.
683;Billy ElliotScore: 88/100One of the most critically accepted movies of 2000, Billy Elliot is a real charmer of a movie that gets better with every minute.
684;It certainly deserves all of its success, and should've been a Best Picture runner.
685;Finally, Mrs. Wilkinson manages to get Billy an audition for the Royal Ballet School, but now he also has to open his heart to his family.
686;there are heaps of shining stars in the movies that make it all worth while: Stephen Daldry, director, nominated for his extroadinary effort this year, Gary Lewis, who brutally and brilliantly displays his anger and Julie Walters who stuns our emotion every time she peeps a word.
687;But, the film belongs to the amazingly talented Jamie Bell, he is Oscar.
688;worthy and very natural in his role as Billy, and it hasn't been since Haley Joel Osment's performance in The Sixth Sense 2 years ago that we have seen such an engaging child actor.
689;The film is also able to mix comedy, drama and a slight touch of romance into a very acceptable running time, and do it completely relaxed and with style.
690;He discovers a ballet class held in the same building at the same time and becomes fascinated with it.
691;The ballet teacher agrees to him joining the class, finds that he has talent, and gives him private lessons for nothing.
692;When Billy's father and brother find out about the ballet, things get pretty heated.
693;By the way, that final scene, when Billy goes on stage, is magnificent.
694;Every time I watch this movie I rewind to the beginning of that scene and watch it a couple of more times.
695;what a magnificent dancer and perfect use of slow.
696;This movie was one of the best movies of 2000.
697;a big grin on his face.
698;It tugs at your emotions and really makes you evalute your own dreams.
699;This is a gift for someone else.
700;I LOVE this movie !
701;There is something about this boy, when he pours himself into the the choreography.
702;it was breathtaking and raw.
703;Jamie Bell was just brilliant.
704;Julie Walters was a great support and I enjoyed seeing one more layer to her acting, fabulous as always.
705;I also appreciate the way the film dealt with so many types of love and how each person hand to discover how to share it.
706;So just a hint of a warning for those of you with sensitive ears, but don't let it detour you from this amazing film.
707;It was a great movie with lots of dancing.
708;This movie is beautifully made and the scenes which juxtapose Billy's energetic dancing with the violence of his father's picket line are brilliant.
709;This is all about gender stereotypes, a young boy's dedication to his dream, and a father's love.
710;I do not watch many films
711;The film is good for children, but there is strong language in the film.
712;The film has a good plot, and to see Billy get what he wants deeply leaves the viewer with a warm, satisfying feeling.
713;I recommend this film to anyone.
714;This was a wonderful movie.
715;I recommend it to anyone.
716;As a dance film and as a coming of age story, however, I found this one among the best I've seen.
717;But he does have a knack for dance, a talent he discovers when he blunders his way into a dance class.
718;I was moved to tears when he finally stood up to his father and improvised a wild, rebellious and angry dance which left his father speechless.
719;Julie Walters is in top form as a teacher with heart and just the right amount of firmness to handle Billy's turbulent emotions .
720;I always really wanted to see this movie because from the commercials on TV it looked really good.
721;I was in dance myself for six years so that's one of the reasons I like it so much.
722;But, it's so much more than the dancing.
723;I love the characters and situations in this movie.
724;I'm so glad I got it because I watch it over and over again.
725;Billy Elliot is a wonderfully written movie.
726;The acting is above average, although not spectacular.
727;I was most pleased with the way the movie would have subplots that seemed not to fit with the movie (such as the miner's strike), but they would be wonderfully interwoven into the movie in a way that was thought provoking.
728;I was also impressed with the way the writer handled the family situation.
729;the interactions between Billy, his father, his brother, and his grandmother were intense and meaningful.
730;overall, a movie worth seeing for anybody interested in child psychology.
731;Also a good discussion starter for families.
732;A feel good movie in the very best sense!
733;Boy makes good against all odds.
734;For all you skeptics, this is a must see movie.
735;It was one of the best feel good movies we had seen in ages.
736;We loved Jamie Bell and can't wait to see him in something else.
737;He is a delight as well as the rest of the cast.
738;If you haven't seen it yet take the time to do so!
739;This movie came as a shockingly well.
740;fi, action, special effects) and went into the movie by way of entertaining my cousin, who wanted to watch it.
741;The dance sequences ARE the special effects!
742;true to British movies, Billy Elliot is chocka.
743;block full of subtle messages (e. g. true friendship, the human spirit, following one's own passion, history, brushing off stereotypes, family values, etc.).
744;A major message of the movie is have guts to follow your passion .
745;Very positive messages emanate throughout the film.
746;and Julie Walters (feisty and funny at the same time!)
747;truly shine in this film.
748;Stephen Daldry, keep up the great work you're producing!
749;The starring child actor is immensely talented, and the supporting actors are well.
750;cast, believable characters of the small, hard.
751;luck mining town he's growing up in.
752;everyone can understand this story, and be swept up in the magic of it.
753;Billy, who is eleven, loves music so much that he leaves his boxing class at the local gym and joins the girls' ballet class, taught by Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters).
754;With a lot of practice, Billy becomes so good that she thinks he should audition for the Royal Ballet School in London.
755;It is charming, honest, and uplifting.
756;Gary Lewis is wonderful as Billy's father.
757;Julie Walters gives a heartfelt performance as the tough teacher with a heart of gold.
758;Jamie Bell, in his movie debut, is natural and sweet, a good dancer, and a sensitive actor.
759;This is a movie you'll want to watch more than once, because it's that good.
760;This is my favorite movie of alllll time.
761;This has got to be the best movie i NEVER wanted to watch.
762;Once you get yourself to watch it tho, you'll discover this magical british production of great calliber.
763;The movie has one of the funniest dialogues i've come across in a long time, if you can get through the accent.
764;The heart of the movie is just about self expression, comeing into your own and transcending those everyday things that hold us down.
765;Billy Elliot is a movie that will be enjoyed by all viewers alike, i guarantee it.
766;This movie has also inspired me to take dancing lessons!
767;This movie has some violence and plenty of cursing to keep you happy.
768;But whats more is that this movie touches that area inside of us that we all have.
769;That is what is so brilliant about this movie.
770;It brings out the billy elliot in all of us!
771;This movie was filled with drama, laughter and empowering themes!
772;I would not recommend this movie for younger children due to the repetitive profane language but it is great for mature older teens and up.
773;This is a heartwarming film, made all the more delightful by the wonderful, breakout performance of newcomer, Jamie Bell, in the leading role of Billy Elliot.
774;The son and brother of coalminers, Billy is given boxing lessons by his father but is drawn, instead, to learning ballet.
775;He is ultimately won over, when Billy gives him a private dance performance so passionate that even he is moved, So, Billy then goes off to London for the audition.
776;What happens next is sure to move even the most stone hearted viewer.
777;this is ultimately a film about hope and the ability to realize one's dreams.
778;Well acted, it is a film that is sure to delight the viewer.
779;All in all, however, this is an excellent film and well worth watching, if only for Billy Elliot's dance scenes.
780;I saw this movie with a bunch of friends when it was a first released, we're all the same age as the character so we all thought it was fun.
781;Watching it now as an adult, I love the film, there are so many good messages throughout the entire feature.
782;overall: I highly recommend this to everyone, it's fun, sweet, entertaining and has a great soundtrack.
783;This movie brings me to tears every time I see it.
784;His new responsibilities include, satisfying his father's wishes, looking after his wandering grandmother, and taking his older brother's verbal abuse.
785;Ballet is practiced in the other side of the gym by a group of young girls.
786;Billy's father and brother are strong participants in the coal miner's union.
787;On top of everything, Billy's childhood friend, Michael, is coming forth with his homosexuality and shows a smidge of affection.
788;Everyone in the film was perfect.
789;The dynamics of the actors as a family was very believable.
790;He gave a very moving performance and his acting is superb.
791;I recommend this movie for anyone.
792;If you cannot hear the film, you can see it and it's excellence of cinematography.
793;If you cannot see the film, you can definitely hear it.
794;It has one of the best soundtracks of all time.
795;Billy Elliot, brings to the screen the story of a boy growing up in Northern England as he discovers his love for dancing.
796;The government and the coal miners are in the middle of a dispute, which the former will eventually win.
797;billy Elliot is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, integrity, and inner strength.
798;aside from that, the plot, the setting, and the music, are all wonderful!Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, and even though you might want to stop short of adding it to your collection, it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!
799;So pleasant, in fact, that I have seen it four times.
800;And in a year this terrible, I predict many an Oscar nomination for this delight
801;From opening credits in which Billy is bouncing on his bed, all the way through the closing credits in which Billy gives one valiant and triumphant leap, I found myself engulfed by a myriad of emotions.
802;jamie Bell, the amazing young actor who plays Billy Elliot, gives a stellar performance that is beautifully enhanced by the other actors in the cast.
803;what a stupendous natural talent.
804;on the whole, Billy Elliot is well done.
805;The directing is ace, as is the editing.
806;And just for the sake of it, the acting is the best ensemble effort of the year.
807;It is everything a movie should be and it is everything most movies are not: original, emotional, wonderfully collaborative and above all entertaining.
808;The story itself is moving and entertaining.
809;I'm one of the few teenagers who was lucky enough to watch this really great movie.
810;Its one of those feel good movies that makes you laugh (its actually very funny) and cry at the same time.
811;The music is great, the plot is simple but perfect for this setting, and the performaces were outstanding.
812;I saw this movie years ago when it first came out and loved it then.
813;I remembered that I loved it, but didn't remember much else about the movie.
814;So very much to love about this movie.
815;It's funny and sad and heartwarming.
816;good British film which has won several awards.
817;It has a statement to make about gender stereotypes and family love and it makes its point loud and clear.
818;there's some fine acting in this film.
819;year old Jamie Bell, cast as Billy, is an excellent actor as well as a good dancer.
820;Billy is not gay and this entire subject is handled with a high degree of sensitivity.
821;Even after he has won his father over to his side, he still has the tough examination by the Royal Ballet Academy to contend with and the audience has to sweat this out right along with Billy.
822;What we do see is excellent but they are all solos performed without costumes.
823;I wish there was at least one full ensemble piece.
824;i enjoyed this video although something holds me back from raving about it.
825;It will leave you with a nice warm pleasant feeling.
826;There's not much new about the theme of Billy Elliott, that of the strength of love and of being true to oneself.
827;But this is a fresh new take, with its focus upon an eleven year old boy from a gritty mining town who wants to become a ballet dancer.
828;Jamie Bell is winning as the novice dancer, and Gary Lewis as his coal miner dad does well with the struggle to come to terms with his wish for a better life for his son and his puzzlement about his choice of profession, which he views as rather poofy, of course.
829;First rate acting, the gritty background of the mining town, the taut dialog, and the T. rex soundtrack all work to make this movie a winner.
830;IMO, suitable for family viewing and highly recommended as such.
831;I bought this movie years ago and I still watch it.
832;Brought it for my son who is a dancer.
833;This is a film a family can enjoy.
834;something son watched it, and enjoyed it, too.
835;Whether the father will do so, and what this means for Billy is why we keep watching the film.
836;This is a touching but affirming film and sure to delight those who believe in the power of dance.
837;I found this movie to be uplifting in almost all senses of the word.
838;The performances are outstanding, particularly from Julie Walters (but then, what else would you expect from her?)
839;He's 15 and absolutely SIZZLES.
840;If you see film as I do, as the most influential visual ART of the 21st century, you would do well in watching Billy Elliot and seeing how it's donde right.
841;bell delivers one of the best performances (both in acting and dancing) I have ever seen, and undoubtedly stands in my opinion as one of the most electrifying actors I've ever seen, comparable to Geoffrey Rush in Shine .
842;It's about a boy's triumph against all odds.
843;Above all this movie is about the length to which a father will go to sacrifice, encourage, and love a son who maybe a (bleeping)genius, regardless of what others might think.
844;You'll get wonderfully caught up in this movie as its electricity will flow through your very being.
845;Once we learn to look at what talents our children have, we must then do everything we can to help them develop, refine, and enjoy.
846;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
847;the tension in Billy himself between his environment's boys don't do ballet attitudes and his own love of dancing is nicely played out.
848;And Jamie Bell himself is brilliant .
849;This is an interesting story, about the difficulty of growing up without a mother, about breaking social and sexual expectations
850;One of the best movies ever made.
851;Soon he discovered that he was very good at ballet, and he then wanted to become a dancer despite his family's wishes.
852;This is a really touching and inspirational film about achieving dreams that will leave you cheering!This is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I have seen quite a few considering that I'm only 14.
853;Billy Elliot is very similar to October Sky , which is another great movie.
854;I have noticed that because this is a British movie, it seems to be a lot more daring than most American movies, with a lot of things that Americans might consider extraneous.
855;But that's what I like about it
856;These little aspects of these minor characters add a really nice touch to the already powerful story.
857;It's definitely better than Gladiator .
858;Gladiator may have cool combat actoin, but it's got a very straightforward plot which doesn't make you think.
859;Watch October Sky first, to give you an idea of how an American movie tells a dream, then watch Billy Elliot for a more sophisticated British idea.
860;What a great English film.
861;Perfect casting by the boy that plays Billy Elliott.
862;Billy's teacher is a good actor too.
863;This sort of film is not usually my type, but I decided to see it based on one particular strong recommendation.
864;Jamie Bell's performance was superb, and his emotional roller coaster ride was extremely convincing.
865;His dancing was also top notch.
866;i laughed and cried, as Billy finally breaks free, and his father finally breaks down and admits that maybe he should give his kid a chance.
867;The burgeoning sexuality of Billy and his friends is explored, with his friend Michael depicted as gay/transgendered.
868;class family in Ireland, I found the dialogue realistic.)
869;There is a rebellious side in all of us.
870;The side that dreams, that asks, What if I had .
871;Billy Elliot helps to show us that there is sometimes an end to the rainbow.
872;the movie is quaint, touching, and extremely well written.
873;Julie Waters, who played the role of Billy's dance teacher, was exquisite, as was Gary Lewis, who played his father.
874;(Of course, Jamie Bell, as Billy, was wonderful too.)
875;The dialog is sparse, but powerful nonetheless.
876;So why I had to ask myself did I leave the theatre 10 feet of the ground feeling so good about myself and ready to give the human race one more benefit of the doubt.
877;this is unabashedly one of those feel good films of the year and dosent pretend to be otherwise.
878;The simple plot of young working class lad with striking miner father who shows a penchant for the ballet to the squeamishness of his father and brother has been well documented by other reviewers better than me.
879;The exceptional performances by Jamie Bell as the budding dancer and Julie Walters as the burnt out cynical dance teacher have received all the credit that is their due.
880;Gladiator, Traffic, Erin Brockovich are all commendable efforts which will receive their fair amount of kudos this year, and Jamie and Julie will no doubt lose out to Russel Crowe or Tom Hanks or Julia Roberts But for all that I still place it in the top ten of my personal best list.
881;Its been a long time since I felt so good leaving a cinema.
882;To me, there are differences between a 'feel good' movie and one that makes you feel good.
883;But a movie that has the ability to make you feel good is a rare event, and the best ones can connect you with that elusive thing, the human spirit.
884;Something about dancing intrigues Billy, and soon he is secretly attending the classes.
885;Wilkerson is delighted because Billy is easily the most talented pupil she has ever had.
886;jamie Bell is remarkable as Billy.
887;He is the most talented young actor I have seen in years.
888;His command of the role is the more remarkable because this is his first acting assignment.
889;the always excellent Julie Walters plays Mrs. Wilkerson as a disillusioned but kind woman who chain smokes while she teaches and who sees in Billy the talent she never had.
890;As Billy's dad, Gary Lewis gives us a man who is hard as nails on the outside but thoughtful on the inside.
891;Beyond his blustering, he sees in Billy's dancing an opportunity he never had, but he resists because ballet is so alien to his world.
892;billy Elliot is one of the most positive, thoughtful and finely crafted movies I have seen recently.
893;It is a perfect film for many teens in my opinion.
894;I really enjoyed watching this movie.
895;True friends are the people who stick by you in the very tough times in your life.
896;always with a kind encouraging word.
897;giving hope in times of trouble and distress.
898;Great movie about following your dreams and what it means to support your loved ones.
899;Quirky and funny moments, with very emotional and poignant scenes.
900;Billy Elliot is a great film about an 11.
901;old boy (Jamie Bell) who has an amazing talent for ballet dancing.
902;i really enjoyed this movie.
903;It's heartwarming, inspirational, and incredibly funny.
904;The cast is amazing, and Bell's dance routines are outstanding.
905;This is a great, feel.
906;good film that everyone will enjoy.
907;A wonderful movie experience, in all the best senses of that phrase.
908;Great story, acting, social relevance, music, dance, heart.
909;felt emotion, a real pleasure.
910;in my opinion, Cinema is the most powerful artistic expression of the 20th and 21st centuries, because it combines all the other arts (except maybe sculpture?)
911;The ballet fans who go to see Swan Lake and the opera fans who watch the Ring Cycle know the story!
912;I have personally seen The Matrix six times, and I have read the Lord of the Rings at least 10 times, and seen the movies (2 of the 3) at least 4 times.
913;Art is art is art
914;so critics, please take a break and get manipulated once in a while.
915;It is life, it is art, it is thought provoking
916;I liked the premise and expected to like the movie.
917;dressing best friend to the dance teacher with an unfullfilling marriage, it's the characters that surround Billy that make this story so exceptional and touching.
918;Truly a touching movie, and yes, boys CAN dance and not be gay.
919;A charming and artistic look at the trials and triumphs of discovering oneself.
920;From moment to moment it can be heart.
921;Jamie Bell plays a superb Billy Elliott.
922;the film handles the family relationships well.
923;Jamie Bell (Billy) is excellent in portraying the passion with which he comes to have for his dancing and the acting of Gary Lewis as Jackie .
924;There is a scene that shows this subtle acting best.
925;Billy, dancing and Jackie watching, show their feelings completely without a word being expressed.
926;a very good 'feel good' movie, light on the sentimentality and just enough weight on the 'heavy' topic of father and son relationship.
927;Definitely a feel good movie, once you get through all the sadness and turmoil.
928;Love watching the struggle Billy goes through.
929;sentimental story into a fresh and emotional movie.
930;Jamie Bell is incredible as Billy, as is the rest of the cast.
931;once again, though, the directing is superb and underrated (with some classic sight gags thrown in).
932;The great music and visuals complement the story perfectly.
933;Luckily the movie was not damaged and we were able to enjoy it without any trouble.
934;This is an amazing movie.
935;Outstanding performance by Jamie Bell I hope he goes on to other things as well.
936;He certainly has the talent for them.
937;The original movie is outstanding.
938;All in all, a tearjerking extravaganza of emotions!!!!
939;You should see this movie.
940;This is a great family movie .
941;a wonderful mixture of hilariously funny, highly emotional and brutally real scenes.
942;It is a masterpiece in every way.
943;All the performances where great from the adults to the kids.
944;Jamie Bell was a master a Billy.
945;I'm glad to see that he has become an A. list British actor and that he is getting so many starring roles.
946;He deserves it, his acting is golden.
947;10/10 all around for this move, which in my book is a timeless classic with a great message, and a must watch for anyone with an once of tolerance.
948;A really feel good story with old world style.
949;An uplifting movie for the whole family.
950;This is the most inspiring film I have seen in years!
951;I bought 4 copies to give to friends.
952;This is a great movie for anyone who struggled to be free to be themselves.
953;it helps show the place of dance, especially the place of men dancing, in this particular part of the world.
954;I watched this movie in pure awe at my local movie theater.
955;I was overcome with emotion, and compassion.
956;Very rarely are movies done about a recent decade.
957;This was from such a recent time, that I could honestly connect with it.
958;Julie Walter's was one of the best supporting actresses in a movie of last year, so much emotion was behind every word that she said, you knew you didn't want to mess with her.
959;This story had a great moral, and it was deeply touching.
960;the reason for my title, is, that this movie has the most meaning to teenagers.
961;I think that every teenager should see this movie, and every adult should as well.
962;People of all ages can learn wonderful lessons from this movie.
963;Interesting tale a young boy's desire to take ballet lessons, but avoid the stigma attached to it.
964;I found this film to be very inspired with good performances all around.
965;It's quirky and off beat and may enlighten some narrow minded people out there!
966;set in the north east of England during the British miners strike of 1984.5 Director Stephen Daldry perfectly captures the darkest period of British social history and the poverty suffering and devastation that it brought to so many communities in this extremely heartwarming and uplifting movie.
967;billy Elliot is a very good movie but I have one objection with it and all the other `gritty' British movies and that is the way the working classes are always portrayed.
968;I, and all of my friends come from a working class background and many of the people I knew at school had fathers working in the mines.
969;The movie is full of fine moments including Billy and his teacher performing a powerhouse dance routine to I Love to Boogie by T Rex, or when Mrs Wilkinson's daughter Debbie idly bangs a stick along the row of policemen's perspex riot shields, whilst sauntering down the street and Billy's dance of rage when his father forbids him from dancing again.
970;stephen Daldry's direction and the screenplay by Lee Hall are both excellent and it is to their credit that they deal with the question of Billy's nascent sexuality, avoiding vulgarity and judgement.
971;However, any criticisms are mere details for Billy Elliot is that annual rarity, a really good British movie, that both inspires and entertains in equal volumes.
972;His dance teacher, brilliantly played by Julie Walters, encourgaes him to develop his skills and audition for the Royal Ballet School in London.
973;Those scenes brought back some memories of that time .
974;the retro settings are just great and the musical soundtrack, featuring T. rex, The Jam, The Clash and assorted classical pieces is interesting(great songs during end credit roll by Stephen Gately and Eagle Eye Cherry too!)
975;and works well with the film's best moments.
976;Jamie Bell is superb as Billy, and his aggressive dancing through the streets scene is a gem, and the message of this dramatic and sometimes amusing movie is that one can overcome all obstacles and achieve their dreams if they persevere!
977;Thank you for making this bold venture such a rewarding experience.
978;this time I focused on Billy's Dad who has to give up SO MUCH for his son's dream.
979;there are so many powerful father/son moments that it is hard to even recall them all.
980;The moment of shock in a gymnasium where Billy was supposed to learn to box when he realizes that his boy not only can dance but desires to do so with his whole heart changes the direction of his life and he knows it.
981;the wonderful moment when Billy cries because he was accepted and his Dad's moment of triumph is dimmed by the news that the union was forced to cave in reminds us that this is not a silly story told outside of time, but in the midst of very hard times.
982;and the Dad and son wrestle in the grass and his Dad holds him close (much as he must have done when he was a baby) and they laugh shows how complex their relationship really is.
983;The story is moving, funny, sad, and so well acted and filmed.
984;It certainly deserves all forms of praise.
985;I can truly recommend this film!
986;I loved the movie Billy Elliot.
987;A very good movie to watch with your children .
988;The story is told with touching acting, and yet, there is a huge goof you rarely see, when the camera caught the boom mike in the shot and no one edited it out or reshot it.
989;This movie is a must see for anyone who has a heart and a desire to express themselves.
990;heart wrenching story, we're saps for fantastic music (Marc Bolan), excellent dancing by a kid, challenging life choices, dear friends who you don't understand but still love, seen it five times and still cry at the last scene.
991;And I'm a 60 year old man from Mississippi!
992;This is a beautiful film, warmth, sensational, and it may even make you cry.
993;The film also makes you feel complete: it starts with young Billy's kiddie jumps while he's making his breakfast, it ends with grown.
994;The storyline is straight foward but the details between the father and son's bonding, the confusing friendship with Billy's sweet gay friend Michael, are very well done.
995;Jamie Bell (as Billy) did an outstanding performance in his debut.
996;Undoubtfully, his acting, his dancing, his enthusiastic performance, really make this film truely alive!
997;Jamie Bell makes a very remarkable performance as young Billy, who really makes you wonder how far a dream can go (what if.
998;'This is a movie that not only shows the viewer the power of courage, but shows him how good movies can be, when all you need, and all you want to see is a movie that can make you smile or cry (or both) in less than a minute.
999;The actors were all terrific.
1000;I saw the play on Broadway and although it was a good show I actually thought the movie was more enjoyable.
1001;Its strongest point is the fact that, even talking about a touching and beautiful history, is is not overly melodramatic or cliched.
1002;This is an excellent film which is moving without being sentimental and truly uplifting.
1003;The acting is superb .
1004;Should a film set in a working class mining community in County Durham have actors speaking in BBC English or even American accents just to please the American market?
1005;I personally have a lot of difficulty understanding the American accents in many of the films that we see (and we don't get subtitles!)
1006;This is the way people actually speak in Durham and thus adds to the realism of the film.
1007;As one enlightened reviewer alluded, language is harmless .
1008;Their courage, their perseverance, their triumphs in the face of adversity, their love.
1009;The movie was in very good shape.
1010;The film of BILLY ELLIOT is a masterpiece.
1011;plot: the local ballet teacher senses his genius, tutors him, and suggest he audition for the London BalletYou can imagine how this goes down with his macho father and older brother.
1012;the scenes of Billy dancing, leaping, flying through the town on the cobblestones will make every single person grin and tap their toes along with this gifted child performer.
1013;in deft staging, Billy Elliot gently explores politics, religion, sexuality, and family relationships.
1014;see movie for everyone, especially for those who are fans of all things Irish.
1015;This is one of my favourite movies of all time!
1016;I hope that last part doesn't turn off the guys, it's a great movie.
1017;My significant other is about as masculine as they come and he liked it too.
1018;Great Movie, well done and a good story line besides good filming.
1019;This movie shows us that if we really have a burning desire to accomplish something that we feel in our very being is what we are meant to do, if we are willing to defy the odds then, we can do what ever it is that we want to do no matter the odds and we and can succeed when we follow our dreams and our heart.
1020;This is a very heart warming story about a boy who at 11 knew exactly what he wanted to do and a father who supported him against all odds Just the willingness of the father to give his support to his son .
1021;The movie is well worth watching for this alone.
1022;Billy Elliot is the heartwarming tale of eleven year old Billy Elliot who in the hard scrabbled world of Northern England circa 1984 finds that he has a talent for of all things, ballet.
1023;In an act of true love, Mr. Elliot, crosses the picket lines to try to earn money to send Billy to the audition.
1024;He is stopped by his oldest son from actually working, but his actions show that he really loves his family.
1025;In the end, Billy gets into the Academy and triumphs in the face of huge odds.
1026;The main reason is Jamie Bell who does a tremendous job as Billy.
1027;This will change as his performance shows great depth as he applies comedic and dramatic touches to Billy.
1028;Julie Waters is excellent as Mrs. Wilkinson as is the rest of the cast.
1029;Billy Elliot is a winner all the way.
1030;I would tear at the end of this movie each time.
1031;Last year, I was telling him how great 'Billy Elliot' was and he poopooed it.
1032;He had read a review, you see, in the paper, from someone who said 'Billy Elliot' was trite and formulaic.
1033;the acting is superb, the story works toward its inevitable ending (okay, okay, you do know what is going to happen) in a sweet and endearing way.
1034;But then, I am a cynic and I still liked it.
1035;but I know one thing, I'll definitely be watching it again.
1036;Jamie Bell was wonderful .
1037;more of that powerful dancing and music would have been much more satisfying.
1038;Hollywood, inspite of all it's wealth and technology could never make a movie as full of life and beauty as this.
1039;Definitely on my favorites list.
1040;This film is genuinely heartwarming.
1041;The film traces one boy's love of ballet, the turmoil in his family life while he seeks the approval of his father, and the special relationship with his dance instructor.
1042;If you have ever had a dream to do something with your life, you should watch this movie.
1043;It is one of my favorites.
1044;This movie is real, moving, funny, inspiring and just plain well .
1045;I found the film very entertaining, the performances are wonderful, and it deals with the question of dealing with being gay (Billy's friend) in a very sweet and non.
1046;The family struggle and discovery of dance are excellent story lines, but the overall story lacked movement for me.
1047;A great film and was in great condition.
1048;BILLY ELLIOT is a wonderful film.
1049;every single part of this movie is excellent and there is no boring or dull moment.
1050;The acting by the entire cast is absolutely flawless with a great storyline and amazing screenplay.
1051;The choreography is above all, one of the best parts of the entire film.
1052;Jamie Bell and Julie Walters, who plays the kind but strict dance teacher who urges Billy to dance, are the true stand.
1053;bILLY ELLIOT is a heartwarming tale and can be tear.
1054;One of the best sceens is when Billy shows his father how well he can dance when he dances in that room (I forget where they are), and his father is watching him with tears in his eyes.
1055;this is a movie that should be treasured because it is a pure masterpiece.
1056;BILLY ELLIOT is one of my favorite films of all time and I really recommend this.
1057;Two really terrific movies and two of the best ever made.
1058;Gritty northern drama, that inspires one.
1059;Aside from that the filme was interesting in recounting the social background of the early '80s in the UK, of the real hardships the miners faced.
1060;Great acting all the way round, strikes a gritty realist approach.
1061;A beautiful story with a brilliant actor portraying the heartbreak of childhood and strife.
1062;set in Ireland during a horrendous class struggle, the movie was set off by the wonderful cast.
1063;I have a copy of the original Billy Elliott in VHS Tape and loved it.
1064;All along the film I noticed minor changes that took the strong appealing part of the story away.
1065;I thought it removed an important statement that Billy, who was ridiculed by family and some friends, as being effeminate just because he loved dancing, yet his macho friend from the neighbor turned out to be gay.
1066;handedly carried this movie charmingly and convincingly.
1067;I especially liked the big grin that came over his face as he accepted his friend's gayness.
1068;Imagine Billy's defiant solo in front of his father without the bombastic symphony and you'll get a real idea of what Billy was talking about when he explained how he felt while dancing: Electricity, that's it.
1069;Love Billy Elliot, this is a gritty, fast moving film, set in a tough mining town in the North of England.
1070;Acting is superb without exception, and the music great.
1071;Jamie Bell, is perfect for this role and is outstanding throughout.
1072;My teens watched the movie and loved it, they don't use bad language and I knew that watching this movie would not cause them to start.
1073;They really enjoyed it and have seen it again and again.
1074;It is both funny and extremely moving .
1075;This is a very enjoyable watch and one I believe would be good to see again and again.
1076;Quite a preformance by Jamie Bell, great movie, can this boy dance.
1077;A MUST see movie, great for the whole family over 13 years of age.
1078;Just goes to show what you can accomplish if you really want something.
1079;What a amazing job they did in casting the actors.
1080;, a director took a fine cast of characters and refused to let them come through.
1081;The most heartbreaking example of this is Debbie (Nicola Wilson in her screen debut), the daughter of Billy's dance teacher and a possible love interest.
1082;Billy Elliot is a great film.
1083;I highly recommend this movie.
1084;The characters are believable, the story uplifting, the scenes artfully made, and the music irresistible.
1085;this is a movie that will stay in my mind for a long time.
1086;It points out the fact that there's a special talent inside each one of us that's waiting to come out.
1087;time feature film direction was excellent
1088;Lee Hall's screenplay was heartwarming, though it's hard to understand some of the words because the language and accent used are of the Northern British region.
1089;Jamie Bell who played Billy Elliot was engaging
1090;one will hear countless use of the four.
1091;overall, Billy Elliot is a very good movie.
1092;To me it, it's one of the best films of all time.
1093;I give it five stars.
1094;i liked the movie and the dance teacher's daughter making a pass at Billy.
1095;Billy Elliot, one of 2000's best films, is far more than just the typical coming.
1096;Billy Elliot takes us back to that time in our lives .
1097;when we are just beginning to experience the manifold wonders of the world, when we are just beginning to explore those things which makes us feel good, and when we are just starting that long process of self.
1098;discovery that will ultimately define who we are and what we love.
1099;Such a journey can be an easy one if, for instance, that thing that we choose to love happens to be socially acceptable .
1100;Then growing up and staying true to oneself suddenly become all that more challenging.
1101;If for no other reason, Billy Elliot deserves credit for tackling and illuminating the tricky and sometimes uncomfortable subject of adolescent gender.
1102;year old boy whose life provides little opportunity for warmth or joy.
1103;His father and brother are striking miners, his beloved mother has recently passed away and his maternal grandmother struggles with the disorientation that comes with advancing senility.
1104;One of the great joys of Billy Elliot comes in these early scenes as we see Billy going to enormous lengths to hide the truth of his activities, secreting his dancing shoes under his mattress or inside his trousers or absconding with a book on dancing from a local book mobile etc.
1105;is the single most important step to achieving personal happiness.
1106;ridden lower class family, the recently dead mother, the feisty, sympathetic teacher who places all her faith in her young pupil, the initial reluctance on the part of the family and the community to accept Billy's dream and their ultimately yielding to his wishes .
1107;Yet, somehow, Billy Elliot never seems clich d or derivative, partly because writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry get the details of character and setting so right and partly because Jamie Bell delivers such a luminous, naturalistic performance as Billy.
1108;Thanks to Bell's subtle underplaying, Billy never comes across as precious or precocious.
1109;He is just an ordinary kid with an extraordinary gift who is not afraid to ultimately stand up and defend his own originality.
1110;As the ballet instructor, Julie Walters conveys just the right combination of firm determination and openhearted compassion to make her a believable inspiration to her young charge.
1111;the term feel good movie is often the kiss of death when it comes to encouraging the less sentimentally inclined among us to check out a film.
1112;it may be one of those rare films that actually does some good in the world.
1113;I thought it provided a very complex view of a boy and his relationship with his father.
1114;I particularly like how they handled the friendship between Billy and his gay friend.
1115;This is easily one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time with very believable characters and ones that you really care about.
1116;This is a very very good movie.
1117;this is the classic family doesn't initially understand, teacher believes in him, screws up audition but spirit carries him through type movie.
1118;It's put together quite nicely, and you never really know how it is going to turn out.
1119;the beginning of Swan Lake, with Billy as the lead and family and friends in attendance, 10 years or so later, was a real feel good part of the movie.
1120;This simply ranks for me to be one of the best movies put out in 2000!
1121;Jamie Bell is to be commended for his extremely fine character portrayal of Billy Elliot.
1122;This is the first movie I've seen that actually uses manages to use dance as a dialogue.
1123;The scene of Billy showing his father JUST how adept he is at dancing while displaying a completely hardened look on his face in defiance of his father is worth the price of seeing the film in itself!
1124;It's a great tale of trial and triumph and it is simply NOT to be missed!
1125;It's a great and inspirational video, but they could have slipped in a few more intelligent words rather than mere swears (It's so funny to hear the English swear in this movie).
1126;why can't you merely dance them out?It's beautifully done.
1127;It has the English 'spot' in it.
1128;It's dashing, compelling, and imaginative!
1129;I love this movie made me laugh,feel good,and cry.
1130;Lovely ending and I have watched it at least a dozen times.
1131;This is my abosolute favorite movie.
1132;Billy Elliot captures everything a good artsy movie should, you laugh, you cry, and you get so involved with all of the characters.
1133;Jamie Bell devilers an amazing performance as this movie's lead role, Billy Elliot.
1134;The music, emotion, and artistic filming make this movie a complete hit.
1135;one of the best movies I have seen.
1136;It could do with a little less profanity but under the circumstances maybe it is appropriate.
1137;A wonderful film about how one boy's dream to become a dancer will not be supressed by the social and financial struggles that surround him.
1138;Beautifully filmed with terrific acting and music.
1139;Jamie Bell is definitely better than Haley Joel Osment.
1140;Julie Walters is a great actress.
1141;This movie is very funny and I just love it more than any other movie I've seen so far.
1142;Billy Elliot, is to me the best film of this year,.
1143;Jamie bell is so wacthable, a good dancer is so sweet I wanted to give him a great big cuddle.
1144;Coming from England reading about the mine strike when i was little made it feel even more real.
1145;Also I loved the music my favouite bit is when the brillant julie walters, (another of my favourite pepole), billy danced to T~Rex`s I want to Boogie , I love that song.
1146;You will be moved by this film,.
1147;It is about finding what's right for you and following it with everything you've got.
1148;As a film it works beautifully.
1149;The screenplay is witty, the characters are true, the storyline fantastical but not at all improbable.
1150;Films like this are so simple and sweet and rare that to criticize them is to take away from the intentions of the piece.
1151;This is an ultimate feel.
1152;This is a wonderful movie that has humor, drama, adversity, and triumph.
1153;My whole family loved this video.
1154;We laughed and cried and cheered.
1155;I simply love this father and son story.
1156;Looks amazing, plus comes with Digital copy for the most popular products such as iPhones and iPads.
1157;i am very happy with this great Blu.
1158;This is a wonderful movie although it can be hard to understand until your ear becomes accustomed to the dialect.
1159;billy Elliot captures and propels the importance of creativity and in this film the discovery of Billy's talent seems to somehow heal and transcend a families collective pain.
1160;bily's Father and Brother are striking miner's and his sweet Grandmother is slowly loosing her grip on reality
1161;money is tight and the existance is gritty with little hope of change.
1162;his dance teacher spots his potential and the story develops around his budding talent which clashes awkwardly with the macho culture he finds himself in.
1163;there are some sublime moments of tender comedy, particularly with Billy's friends Michael and the dance teacher's daughter, Debbie.
1164;These moments perfectly capture the free and developing spirit of children as they struggle to assimilate this and their social expectations.
1165;billy's dancing is energetic and emotive and appears to be a cross between gritty modern moves and bouncy balletic/tap.
1166;the number's are full of energy and raw emotion, Billy's tantrum dance to the Jam's Town called Malice is particularly memorable.
1167;a wonderful film with some excellent performances, Bell is absolutley cracking.
1168;Walters is good as the disaffected dance teacher but for me Billy's Father and his freind Michael are strikingly memorable and powerful.
1169;This has become one of my top four or five favorite movies.
1170;When Billy dances I smile from ear to ear.
1171;I usually don't like musicals turned into movies, but this is a gem.
1172;Besides, Billy's dance is very energetic and not all ballet moves.
1173;I don't want to give any more away, but it is a wonderful story!
1174;It's been a long time since I've seen a movie as complex and subtle as this one.
1175;The actors are very good at portraying emotions through body language as opposed to vocalizing them.
1176;The characters are three dimensional, and it's interesting that the viewer misjudges them the same way that they misjugde Billy.
1177;Great character study of the human condition.
1178;One of the best movies ever made.
1179;Suitable for ages between 9 through 900!
1180;I saw it one time and enjoyed it so much that I had to have one of my own.
1181;The photography and the acting is wonderful, (the acting that is) if you could understand the dialect.
1182;I found one scene in particular really hard to watch.
1183;i could have loved this film but with the dialogue I'd have to give it a 3 out of 5
1184;i thought this movie was pretty funny when i watched it.
1185;A delightful story of a boy who has found his passion.
1186;The reason I have given it 2 stars is that I thought the sub.
1187;Watch the Shawshank Redemption for a truly inspiring tale of hope.
1188;I heard that it should be very good or even excellent film and another reason for watching it was that I have seen several Working Title films before (About a Boy, Notting Hill, Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral) and I found all of them much more sincere and emotional than average Hollywood products.
1189;Also these British films have something to offer that you rarely can find in Hollywood movies: a charming heartwarming mixture of sweet and funny comedy and inspiring and touching drama.
1190;Last month, finally, I found the tape.
1191;From very first moments of the movie my eyes were riveted to the screen and when the movie ended feelings and emotions overflowed me.
1192;director of the movie Stephen Daldry brought to us an exceptional, truly inspiring and moving, emotional and poignant movie.
1193;The entire story and all the characters are completely believable and the atmosphere of small provincial town somewhere in North.
1194;eastern England skillfully captured and transmitted to us.
1195;But all this is only a masterfully recreated background for main story of the title character, a twelve years old boy.
1196;There are only two people in the whole town, who support him .
1197;Several brilliant come scenes and bright humor greatly emphasize the struggles of the main hero.
1198;jamie Bell playing Billy has on of the best performances ever among young actors.
1199;His performance (and particularly dance sequences) is so genuine, bright and sincere that all the time we can easily feel an expression of a young boy, not a director, choreographer or writer.
1200;BAFTA award for best actor of the year is well.
1201;Julie Walters (an Academy nomination for best supporting actress) as Billy's ballet teacher also did a great job as a talented woman as a talented women who forced to teach in small provincial town for pitiful salary.
1202;The chemistry between teacher and student is another great line in Billy Elliot.
1203;Billy's father and elder brother Tony are also excellent and their evolution is perfectly showed by Stephen Daldry's direction.
1204;The beautiful soundtrack is a perfect combination of a classic (including a nice reference to great Swan Lake) and modern music.
1205;Except for strong language it should be easily a PG.13.
1206;But this is a very rare case where some strong language and profanity are necessary for authenticity and characters understanding.
1207;The movie is suitable for teens and it definitely is able to give some good lessons for them.10 out of 10 looks well deserved.
1208;Great acting, great story and the only part that was a bit off was the end.
1209;wonderful movie, I highly recommend it.
1210;The main part played be an unkown Jamie Bell has helped this film as he has put his heart in to it and made Billy have a special place in all of our hearts.
1211;Julie Walters has to be commended for her part as the ballet teacher, i feel that she was the best person for the part.
1212;(chain smoker and full of sarcasim) The sound track that was selected for the film is the best that i have ever seen for any film.
1213;In fact, an extraordinary film you may never have heard of before.
1214;Converted to a highly successful Broadway show, still in its 6th year running in London, it has been touring the States now for some two years.
1215;and, well, you can use your own imagination to know the conflicts and emotional roller coaster ride all are invited to enjoy in the films conclusion.
1216;One of my favorite films of all times, and have seen the stage musical 60 times/plus over recent years.
1217;town realness of the characters and believablity of the perfomances helps the audience identify with the Billy's plight.
1218;Small note: Understanding of the thick Irish accent is increased greatly with use of closed.
1219;Billy Elliot is an amazing movie about a boy growing during the 1984 coal miner strike.
1220;He has a special talent for dancing, but is struggling to participate in dance classes because his family is opposed to it, calling it for poofs .
1221;He won a BAFTA for Best Actor for his performance in Billy Elliot.
1222;Julie Walters, who plays Billy's dance teacher, won a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress.
1223;Billy Elliot is a fantastic movie for the whole family.
1224;at its heart, it's about a tough boy who wants to do ballet.
1225;rate, the story is original, and it's full of smart, Brit.
1226;style humor and gritty performances by the adults.
1227;It is a masterpiece in every way.
1228;All the performances where great from the adults to the kids.
1229;Jamie Bell was a master a Billy.
1230;I'm glad to see that he has become an A. list British actor and that he is getting so many starring roles.
1231;He deserves it, his acting is golden.
1232;10/10 all around for this move, which in my book is a timeless classic with a great message, and a must watch for anyone with an once of tolerance.
1233;I had seen the movie a few years ago, and bought it as a gift for another person.
1234;It's a great story about finding your passion and refusing to allow anyone to stop you from acheiving your dream.
1235;Billy Elliot is one of the most inspiring movies of all times!
1236;The acting is superb, the writing is superb, the story is engrossing and transformative.
1237;Love this movie and have watched it a couple times over.
1238;Delightful movie that expresses a number of emotions, centered around an historically difficult time for the British coal miners
1239;We both love the story and found it transfers well to any country, age, gender.
1240;billy Elliott received it's highest compliment when Sir Elton John saw it and proceeded to create Billy Elliott the musical on Broadway!
1241;Billy Elliot is definitely worth owning.
1242;If you like the energy of Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor, you'll find the dance sequences here equally breathtaking.
1243;The story line is terrific and believable.
1244;The entire cast is exceptional.
1245;it's more eloquent and moving than any spoken word.
1246;And Billy is a very likable hero .
1247;The whole movie is riveting and the last scene is a particular triumph for everyone who's ever struggled for a chance to prove that dreams can come true.
1248;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
1249;Plus bringing the family together.
1250;Shows if you work hard at somethg you can make it.
1251;This is one of the most fun films that I've seen in a while.
1252;the acting is convincing, the story is touching, and the balance between the tension of the strikes and the irony of Billy's situation is astonishing.
1253;This film easily could have become a sappy, cornball film like Bootmen, but this one avoids the pitfalls that come with the genre by telling an honest tale from each character's perspective, allowing us to see the turmoil and confusion and frustrations that each of them feel all along.
1254;The soundtrack is exhilarating, the dance scenes are fun, and the ending is as touching an ending as I've seen in a very long time.
1255;definitely worth two or three viewings.
1256;time best movies I have ever seen.
1257;I've actually witnessed my thirteen year.
1258;When Billy told off his teacher for always telling him what to do the same as everybody else, I asked my daughter if it reminded her of anybody, and she laughed and said,Yeah, Brian!
1259;I believe he is going to be a force to reckon with in the movie world.
1260;aside from Jamie Bell's spectacular acting and dancing, the other characters were perfectly cast and acted.
1261;the story itself was at once heartbreaking and heartwarming without being either contrived or shmaltzy.

1271;The courage that this eleven year old shows in the film is splendid and this film is good not only for the skill of acting but for the heart warming feeling that it inspires.
1272;It is true that the basis of the story has been done before in many other ways however it can be important to see it from other perspectives as this did.
1273;warming, inspiring story about an eleven.year.
1274;class family who aspires, despite the odds, to be a ballet dancer.
1275;Apart from a superb storyline that is powerfully portrayed, the acting is absolutely first rate by all involved.
1276;The Northumberland accents may be a little difficult at first for some, but it's nothing that can't be overcome with close attention, and it's well worth the effort.

1290;It explores the teacher/student relationship and we see the dream of any teacher coming true in her student, but after much conflict.
1291;The ever present conflict of life lived true regardless of conflict or consequence.
1292;This film was enormously popular in England.
1293;It is a young boy rising up against the elements set against the background of the miners strike type film.

1305;The sound track is fabulous and probably worth owning on it's own for T. rex and Stephen Gately.
1306;the symbolism is simply brilliant.
1307;This ties in with the whole theme of wings, feathers, flying to freedom, and Swan Lake, with a genius interpretation of the ugly.
1308;There is also a sense of anger/fear changing to cathartic tenderness between men and it's about time we have more of this in pictures.
