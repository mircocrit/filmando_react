I:10;1;huge bats that you can fly on them??
I:10;2;now that is a master piece.
I:10;3;The cast is great, the special effects are the best of any movie I've seen, and it has a great story.
I:10;4;this reincarnation of the 1933 classic is truelly spectacular in many ways.
I:10;5;Naomi Watts is the perfect choice for the Ann Darrow character, and Jack Black makes a acceptable Carl Denham.
I:10;6;i always cheer for the powerful King Kong.
I:10;7;I love the character of King Kong and I always will.
I:10;8;this film pays great tribute to the 1933 classic and gives a great, and entertaining show!
I:10;9;I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a truelly great film with tons of action, drama, and a giant gorilla.
I:10;10;The best film of 2005!
I:10;11;It's worth the price and the entertainment!!!
I:10;12;It is an instant classic that was done right by Peter, Jack, and Adrian and company.
I:10;13;but suffice it to say the Blu Ray does it justice, and the sound is amazing in my home theater.
I:10;14;The best part of the movie was when the usher had to kick out some unruly teens.
I:10;15;Press are the first to have a crack at a movie.
I:10;16;Sorry to break it to you.
I:10;17;When it finished, I could only sit there and realize I'd seen one of the great movies of all time.
I:10;18;I felt grateful to have lived to see it.
I:10;19;My kids and I loved watching it!
I:10;20;I liked the characterization of Kong as an old, beat up, Gorilla.
I:10;21;#3 Between Kong's capture (even if the ship's crew made their living capturing wild animals why'd they have so many gallons of chloroform.
I:10;22;Watching this movie in high definition was a treat.
I:10;23;The picture is amazingly clear and the sound is impressive.
I:10;24;King Kong is far from an enjoyable movie to me.
I:10;25;When I watch an action movie I want action.
I:10;26;This movie is over three hours long and is a good sleepy time tale but when it comes to action I will view something else.
I:10;27;All I can say is, I went expected action, great special effects, as well as an interesting story, and I got it all tenfold.
I:10;28;the sheer scale of this flick is enough to impress even the most dessensitized eyes.
I:10;29;The cast is excellent, with the severely attractive Naomi Watts leading the pack as Ann Darrow.
I:10;30;Adrien Brody also stars as Jack Driscoll, and having absolutely no familiarity with him as an actor, I was quite impressed and surprised that I hadn't seen him elsewhere.
I:10;31;The rest of the cast is great as well, and I can't think of a single role that was obviously miscast.
I:10;32;i was very glad I went to see this movie when I did, with a group of moviegoers whose fresh eyes were just as impressed as mine.
I:10;33;also, I thought the Christmas trees in the movie were a nice touch, with it being so close to the holidays.
I:10;34;I was never a huge fan of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but I could certainly admire his tremendous achievement at bringing the trilogy to life.
I:10;35;You certainly have to hand it to him, he's one of the most visionary directors working today and the fact that he can combine state of the art jaw dropping special effects with stories that are also deeply human and so often heartfelt, says a lot about his enormous talent.
I:10;36;once the group is shipwrecked on the island, the movie ramps it up, with the first appearance of the big hairy ape making a classically enormous entrance.
I:10;37;But once we meet him, the stage is set for a battle involving the scary human residents of the island and some of the most amazing looking prehistoric creatures that you will ever see on screen.
I:10;38;This is a nerve giggling, audacious spectacular movie that ultimately will go down as one of the years best.
I:10;39;of course, Ann eventually realizes she can handle Kong, and she charming and entertaining the beast with her vaudeville.
I:10;40;insatiability trumps trustworthiness and kindliness, and Denham eventually captures Kong anesthetizing him and putting him on display in New York, as a carnival spectacle.
I:10;41;in a series of startling effects sequences .
I:10;42;where Jackson creates an emotional whirlwind around Ann and Kong.
I:10;43;the acting is generally top notch with Watts turning in an especially nuanced and earthy performance as Ann.
I:10;44;She could have camped it up, but to her credit, she plays it straight.
I:10;45;The rest of the cast is also impressive, perfectly cast in their respective roles.
I:10;46;a thing of raging beauty, a gorgeous hairy beast that packs the unadulterated emotional whack of a tearjerker.
I:10;47;Peter Jackson has gone from talented visionary to presumptuous director with this pile of gorilla dung.
I:10;48;Obviously not everyone could have enjoyed it.
I:10;49;For my money, I'm still sticking with the original, it's still the archetype of action/adventure movies as cinematic art.
I:10;50;It also will have uncompressed audio.
I:10;51;For what you are about to see will FRIGHTEN and AMAZE you.
I:10;52;It's an undiscovered world filled with HIDEOUS creatures, BLOOD.
I:10;53;You'll CLUTCH the edge of your seat as a wide array of EPIC images constantly bombard the screen.
I:10;54;You'll cheer for the BEAUTY as your heart BREAKS for the BEAST!
I:10;55;For only the price of an ADMISSION TICKET.I've called my family, I've told my friends, now it is you my Amazon friends and family that I must tell about this new spectacular film by visionary director, Peter Jackson.
I:10;56;the audience jumped, dodged and squirmed.
I:10;57;"One hour into the film I found myself ""enthralled""."
I:10;58;the Scenery is constantly changing and the creatures vary from scene to scene.
I:10;59;Thankfully they allow us to meet the characters and hold back Kong until the first hour.
I:10;60;The tension builds until the final second, then the fx extravaganza begins.
I:10;61;Kong is a beautiful creation.
I:10;62;hats off to WEDA for the incredible amounts of detail and precision.
I:10;63;"like"" film director shows a new side to his tallent."
I:10;64;It is awesome to see Collin Hanks making his way in the world as he plays the directors assistant.
I:10;65;As in Mulholland Drive she is a lady in need of a part.
I:10;66;The role she finds is much bigger than she anticipates, and does a wonderful job doing it.
I:10;67;Adrian Brody (as in The Pianist) is powerful in his subtle ways.
I:10;68;Less is More is a brilliant motto for him to live by.
I:10;69;Serkis has captured our hearts before as the very torn Smeagal/Gollem.
I:10;70;shot of epic with a lot of heart.
I:10;71;Not only is it one of the years best films, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:10;72;and the more you watch it the less it dazzles you.
I:10;73;King Kong was a great character: He was humorous, smart, silly, and very caring.
I:10;74;as far as the story goes though, King Kong loved the dame in this and fell in love with picking her up after a fall to knock her down over and over again.
I:10;75;That was the funniest part in the movie!
I:10;76;:^)The actors did a fairly decent job of bringing the characters to live and the action kept you glued but you won't wanna watch this one over and over again.
I:10;77;Director Peter Jackson's epic King Kong is a masterpiece.
I:10;78;Yes this movie is 3 hours in length but it is worth your time and patience.
I:10;79;I saw it in the movie theatre and was very impressed by this classic tale.
I:10;80;Naomi Watts is brilliant and cute as Ann Darow She is good in every role she is in, such a talented actress!
I:10;81;Great cinematography and art direction.
I:10;82;I am not much for action movies but this is the best one I have ever seen.
I:10;83;Big kudos to the cast and director, I give you Kong!!
I:10;84;This newer interpretation is one of the best.
I:10;85;The main plot evolves and twists, but the subplots are hilarious.
I:10;86;comedic movie as I did with this one.
I:10;87;The imagination that went into Skull Island is pure psychedelic genius.
I:10;88;The creatures, the and fight and escape scenes, the whole inter.
I:10;89;relationship between Kong and his environment, and the subtle human frailities uncovered by the greed and avarice of the protagaonists and antagonists: all of these were so well done.
I:10;90;I enjoyed this version of King Kong very much and found it very, very entertaining.
I:10;91;These are probably the same type of people that watched it and laughed throughout the most dramatic parts.
I:10;92;Yea, analyze it, the camera, the script, every technical aspect, way to ruin it for yourself!
I:10;93;Take it for what it is, go into it with an open mind, and think about the feelings behind the faces.
I:10;94;This is one of the most emotional films I've seen all year, and it doesn't need to come off looking sophisticated or intelligent for it to be just that, so film snobs and critics can close their mouths.
I:10;95;It's much better than the original, you really feel for King Kong.
I:10;96;I thought Jack Black would ruin the movie, but he played his part well, and at times you really wished that he died.
I:10;97;This movie is very long, and the score is incredible.
I:10;98;The special effects are INCREDIBLE!
I:10;99;Movie of the year, for sure.
I:10;100;the storyline is excellent, I liked the added underlying story about Denham's reliance on his movie for final success or failure.
I:10;101;The development of Kong's arrival at least an hour and a half into the movie was excellent, the tribal scenes were well done, the wrecking of the ship, and much much more.
I:10;102;I saw this movie as a kid in the 70's, and now we have a very much updated version for our kids.
I:10;103;I thoroughly enjoyed the richness of the non.
I:10;104;this is definately more a commercial movie than a literal or entertaining movie.
I:10;105;but still, I liked watching it once.
I:10;106;but this is an adventure movie and there is a lot of good action.
I:10;107;much better than the war of the world which was really disapointing and a good adventure movie in the line of what it should be on the big screen.
I:10;108;let us free our imagination and be entertained , not mind analysed all the time .
I:10;109;It is one of the best movies that has EVER been created!
I:10;110;This movie was so completely amazing that it's hard to put into words.
I:10;111;They make Kong more realistic and actually like an ape and you feel more emotionally attatched to him.
I:10;112;I loved this extended take on Peter Jackson's wider vision of the classic tale, this version seems more complete to me and I'll just be watching this edition from now on.
I:10;113;i still love the original 1933 Kong even though this is a pretty refreshing homage to it.
I:10;114;"Kong is fascinated by this new ""toy"", and instead of ripping her head off like some spoiled child with a toy he's tired of, is delighted with a new favorite."
I:10;115;And, as our pets become a part of our family, so too does Ann become Kong's family.
I:10;116;i do agree the film is too long, but, it is still totally entertaining.
I:10;117;i won't counter other points made in previous reviews, but I do have to concur with the majority of them in that the special effects are seamless, and absolutely wondrous.
I:10;118;Jackson has made 30's New York City into a time.
I:10;119;But, the true wonder of the entire film is Kong.
I:10;120;Now, where Jackson's Kong soars way and beyond the original is here .
I:10;121;In Jackson's version, Ann comes to really love Kong as he loves her.
I:10;122;Had any one or any thing ever literally touched him with love before?
I:10;123;"Since words can not be empolyed, the bond between any ""animal"" and human is a profound one because it is based totally upon trust, compassion, and the unspoken communication of love."
I:10;124;For me, I completely bought into the love between Ann and Kong, which made the end of the film heartwrenching for me.
I:10;125;So, if the success of a film is measured by the degree it touches the viewer, this film hit the bullseye!
I:10;126;It is truly THE best remake ever .
I:10;127;This film is one of the best I have ever seen (and I am an ultra movie.
I:10;128;buff), and in my opinion beats all of the Lord of the Rings films, save for the Return of the King.
I:10;129;The action was awesome (and at times, a bit brutal and excessive), and it got your heart.
I:10;130;rate up and had you totally immersed.
I:10;131;Kong is so realistic that, sometimes he even seems human.
I:10;132;The final fight sequence/ending scene is heart.
I:10;133;This film is definitely the true definition of an epic masterpiece, and though it has its problems, its a poignant film that's not to be missed!
I:10;134;This movie is pure entertainment from start to finish.
I:10;135;If u like the original you must see this one.
I:10;136;This is a very good movie.
I:10;137;The special effects are very good.
I:10;138;I liked that part of the movie.
I:10;139;The NYC scenes were very good.
I:10;140;This may be the last film I will ever see again.
I:10;141;I watched it with my family.
I:10;142;It brought back many memories.
I:10;143;He would still be alive today.
I:10;144;I still love the original.
I:10;145;Giving the original King Kong an A, I would have to give this one a solid B.
I:10;146;The creature computer effects are stunning as is the scenery on Skull Island.
I:10;147;The human characters are so so character wise and Jack Black as Carl Denham was terrible.
I:10;148;Naomi Watts did give a fairly good performance though.
I:10;149;The star of the film of course is Kong ( played by Andy Serkis using motion capture )and the Weta team did an incredible job of making him truely believable.
I:10;150;The depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned.
I:10;151;He keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island, forces them to provide him sacrificial women, and tortures the female star of the movie.
I:10;152;I love this movie but its not as always for everyone to like.
I:10;153;The special Effects are awesome!The movie is really well made.
I:10;154;the story everybody knows it, but Peter Jackson made a wonderfull job for the 21 th.
I:10;155;All I can say is that this movie looks phenomenal on Blu.
I:10;156;ray and you will be entertained.
I:10;157;I went to see King Kong last friday, and I was totally impressed by this extraordinary vision of Peter Jackson.
I:10;158;i have always been a fan of the Kong myth ever since I first saw the underrated 1976 film, and later the 1933 original, and let me just say that this one is better than both, yes, even better than the original.
I:10;159;this movie has some very fine points, hidden from these people, which make it much more than just another giant gorilla flick.
I:10;160;the action is breathtaking and thrilling, but the true power of the film rests on certain details, that a lot of people will never understand, it made me remember my childhood, the women that I loved, and even the memory of my long gone pet Bouvier, in a way that no movie had ever done.
I:10;161;one of the best parts was actually trashed by these imbecile critics, the frozen lake sequence had something that made me happy and sad in an unexplainable feeling that translated into some tears.
I:10;162;it's much more than the age old tale of Beauty and the Beast, it's an amazingly powerful story that Jackson has conceived in such a manner that can only be appreciated through your heart and soul.
I:10;163;thank you Mr. Jackson, you have done it again.
I:10;164;I'll try my best to do just that.
I:10;165;there is good news and bad news with this movie that is surprisingly getting a wonderful reaction from critics and the public.
I:10;166;Roger Ebert, The New York Post, and The New York Daily News have all given the movie four stars!
I:10;167;The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune also wrote favorably reviews.
I:10;168;but I'm not convinced this is a great movie.
I:10;169;First of all I never thought the original was a great movie.
I:10;170;A great piece of filmmaking?
I:10;171;For that you have to give the original credit.
I:10;172;i'll start things off with the good news.
I:10;173;This new version helps us understand Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) a bit more.
I:10;174;There were a lot of possibilities to play around with it.
I:10;175;I suspect this was done largely because the audience that goes to see this film will mostly be children.
I:10;176;And finally obviously the production value on this film is greater than the original.
I:10;177;Much more money was put into making King Kong look more realistic.
I:10;178;I always felt the original Kong, even though you could argue looked fake, had a certain amount of charm to it.
I:10;179;It actually worked with the whole fantasy idea behind the movie.
I:10;180;i also liked the references to the original.
I:10;181;There is a funny line of dialogue (well at least I found it funny, no one else in the theatre did) between Carl Denham (Jack Black) the director and his assisant, Preston (Colin Hanks) when discussing who they can get to star in the movie.
I:10;182;Ann actually starts to feel compassion towards the beast.
I:10;183;She actually gets mad at the people trying to protect her from it.
I:10;184;Fear is a perfectly rational reaction when you are in the grips of a giant gorilla.
I:10;185;But here when Ann is captured she tells Kong he's beautiful!
I:10;186;I'll accept there is such a beast as Kong.
I:10;187;I also felt the movie over stays its welcome.
I:10;188;The original was an hour and a half.
I:10;189;The original smartly knew this and limited much of these scenes.
I:10;190;"This romance destroys all meaning of the film's famous last line, ""it was beauty killed the beast."""
I:10;191;In the original it made sense because Ann was afraid of Kong.
I:10;192;He had to show her he loved her and in doing so he died.
I:10;193;In this movie he already won the girl!
I:10;194;She actually, I think, prefers his company over Jack Driscoll (Adrian Brody) the movie within the movie's screenwriter.
I:10;195;With every element the stroke of an artist, Peter Jackson's rendering of the venerable classic was an act of love, managing to utilize the best in modern film techniques while maintaining an old.
I:10;196;biting adventure, outstanding special effects, a beautiful woman, idealistic hero, and a land that time forgot .
I:10;197;it's a masterwork of a film.
I:10;198;Why, we loved the journey to a mysterious island, modern man doing battle and surviving against prehistoric monsters.
I:10;199;A stellar achievement, but Jackson took it the rest of the way.
I:10;200;the crowning jewel in this masterpiece of thrills is Kong himself.
I:10;201;It was one of the most remarkable things ever, and one can only assume that it's the harbinger of even greater things to come as this technology advances.
I:10;202;capture performance took full advantage of the cutting.
I:10;203;edge animation, and brought Kong to life in a way previously unattainable.
I:10;204;The ape was more than some special effect.
I:10;205;Some scenes, already so breathtaking in SD, engulf you now as you sit before a searing sunset, your eyes splashed with it.
I:10;206;And sweetening the deal further, this release includes both the theatrical version and the even better Director's Cut.
I:10;207;I'm happy to report that the longer cut wasn't a cynical ploy to sell Kong to us again by extending scenes or stretching out the battles.
I:10;208;as for special features, you have U. control, through which you can access various picture.
I:10;209;The main thing is that this superbly produced adventure is now even more gorgeous and more impressive.
I:10;210;Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll portrayed the writer as intelligently aloof, reserved in word and action, but intense and soulful.
I:10;211;Even if some characters were mere sketches, they were very good sketches.
I:10;212;while the merits of the 1933 version are undeniable, kudos to Peter Jackson for fully achieving the original intent.
I:10;213;"But this is the definitive edition, and just too good, making it easy to let go
I:10;214;I'm amazed that so many people liked this movie.
I:10;215;The NYC sequences are gorgeous, but again, the action makes very little sense.
I:10;216;For the first 45 minutes to an hour my wife and I were really pleased with this film.
I:10;217;"It was engaging
I:10;218;In fact, it reminded me of how effectively movie makers of the 1930's and 40's could tell a story and engage you in the telling of it.
I:10;219;i was lured to this film because I was familiar with the story, and because this 2005 re.
I:10;220;telling won the Academy Award for Visual Effects.
I:10;221;In fact, many of the visual effects are stunning .
I:10;222;my assessment is that when the film is good, it is very, very good.
I:10;223;I thought the casting was excellent, except for Jack Black.
I:10;224;Maybe Peter Jackson, fresh from finishing the superb Lord Of the Rings trilogy, can't make a movie anymore that comes in under three hours.
I:10;225;There are movies that deserve a three hour treatment because the subject matter is so complex or interesting, King Kong was not one of them.
I:10;226;The only real extra on this disk is the excellent commentary by Jackson and Boyens.
I:10;227;Since the movie was built around the ape it's a good thing he came through for us in the end.
I:10;228;This is truly visual film in every sense of the word.
I:10;229;the actors did the best they could with the few lines they had.
I:10;230;When he's holding his lovely it looks pretty cheesey but when he's ripping the city apart and haulin ass around town it's worth the early movie ticket price.
I:10;231;She was correct, the old Cinema classic has come of age.
I:10;232;This intense love story is filled to the brim with passion.
I:10;233;The action has you on the edge of your seat.
I:10;234;The glimmers of humor come at just the right time.
I:10;235;"This movie reminded me of a combination of ""King Kong"", ""Love Story"", ""Jurassic Park"", and ""Final Destination""."
I:10;236;all in all it is dynamic film, probably one of the best of the year.
I:10;237;Both entertaining and filled with lots of great special effects, however, it's not great, and that's a shame because the potential was there.
I:10;238;okay, so besides that some of the casting stunk, but let me get to what was right.
I:10;239;the cgi done for Kong was absolutely amazing, I mean I thought Aslan was done wonderfully in the LWW, but since he had to be made to speak and be more than an animal, while Kong just had to be a animal (albeit an intelligent one), I think the characterization of Kong was several levels of order higher in amazement.
I:10;240;also amazing was the background and set design for 1930's New York.
I:10;241;Just the scenes showing New York in that period were worth going to see the film for.
I:10;242;okay, so should you see this?
I:10;243;I think so, many people are raving about it, I thought it was good, and worth going to the big screen to see it too.
I:10;244;Just make sure you're well rested and if you have back problems that you take something before you go.
I:10;245;Now whereas I was not quite as enthralled as I was with ROTK, this is still a stunning spectacle, even if 3hours is bit of a marathon.
I:10;246;"We find him running from his financial backers after they decide to pull the plug, and charming and bribing his way onto a ship bound for ""Skull Island"" to make his masterpiece."
I:10;247;once on the island we meet Kong, and as well as a whole host of Weta SfX departments creations in some great scenes, although some are rather silly it seems.
I:10;248;the picture is not exceptional, but from the point of view of enterntainment it's great.
I:10;249;Visually stunning, and very fast paced after thirty minutes or so, you will laugh, jump, and even squirm at many of the scenes.
I:10;250;The acting is top notch as well, and Jackson still it seems has a knack in the Editors chair as well.
I:10;251;All that said, go see it for yourself .
I:10;252;it WILL be one of the most talked about films of the holidays, and sure to rake it in big at the box office, so treat yourself and see what we're all talking about.
I:10;253;Great fun, a bit too scary for younger viewers, but overall a Very Good (if not quite Great) remake brought up to date.
I:10;254;"All I could say throughout watching this was ""wow!"""
I:10;255;sharp, no compression artifacts at all.
I:10;256;Great colors, especially on the sky shots.
I:10;257;Basically some of the most amazing footage I've ever seen.
I:10;258;i've never seen the movie before (not even the original) and I totally loved it.
I:10;259;The whole production is top.
I:10;260;And on Disc One, the movie has car commercials and previews right up alongside the film in the menu.
I:10;261;The special effects are cool but the acting is over.
I:10;262;There are very few remakes that live up to the original's reputation and for many good reasons:1.
I:10;263;king Kong (2005) is also one of those rare remakes.
I:10;264;the most refreshing part of this movie is that there is an underlying and always present emotional dimension to this version which the 1933 version lacked.
I:10;265;The interpersonal relationships certainly have a greater depth than the original.
I:10;266;Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this movie is that there is an emotional relationship between Kong and Anne that, I'm thrilled to say, somehow works.
I:10;267;I absolutely loved how they could share something as simple as sunset together and take just enough time to enjoy the wonder of it all.
I:10;268;"dimensional, more nonchalant, and just plain better than the original's wooden actors (""say, I think I love you"" as an example)."
I:10;269;When I say this, I include King Kong who is a surprisingly good actor (even if he is CGI).
I:10;270;I especially loved seeing New York City during the 1930s.
I:10;271;"technically the condensed 1933 version may be a ""better"" film but, of the two, I prefer this one."
I:10;272;All those and more describe the best movie of `05 and one of the best of all.
I:10;273;jackson somehow managed to push all the right buttons: keeping the original characters (albeit with neccessary personality changes) while making them more 3.
I:10;274;dimensional than either the `33 original or the `78 remake was able to, adding welcome new characters, keeping the prehistoric Skull Island from the original that was so full of life and dangers and the decision to keep it set in 1933.
I:10;275;Jackson's true stroke of genius began around the 1:20 mark when he did what the first 2 writers should've done: he developed a mutual bond between Ann and Kong, breaking the `creature feature' mold.
I:10;276;So, let me finish by saying this: for a movie I almost passed on watching (fearing it would be just a fancy remake), this was one of the best, thrilling, saddest, sweetest and most satisfying movies I've ever seen.
I:10;277;I thought King Kong was the best movie of 2005.
I:10;278;But, added jungle scenes with a triceratops and others are fun and you wish they had left them in the original movie.
I:10;279;My son really likes king Kong.
I:10;280;"You know, it's a ""big"" Peter Jackson movie."
I:10;281;"the whole time I watched it I was saying ""yeah."
I:10;282;peter Jackson had sooooo much fun with this.
I:10;283;"okay, watch this movie, it's a great ol' big enormous ""good grief, that would NEVER happen"" movie with hilarious, sick, twisted creatures."
I:10;284;Peter Jackson pays homage to the original blockbuster film KING KONG of 1933.
I:10;285;The acting is fantastic and the action is unbelievable.
I:10;286;Some of the greatest CGI work of our time is done in this film.
I:10;287;You will believe this 25' ape is living and breathing on screen with Naomi Watts.
I:10;288;When the damsel in distress is captured she is offered up to Kong as a sacrifice.
I:10;289;The crew saves her and captures the beast for display and profit.
I:10;290;This leads to one of film's alltime great moments as Kong battles bi.
I:10;291;planes at the top of the Empire State Building!King Kong is a classic and Peter Jackson's love for it, is on full display.
I:10;292;Great storytelling should never take shortcuts!
I:10;293;The picture and sound are breathtakingly beautiful.
I:10;294;Please watch the extended, it is so worth it.
I:10;295;This movie not only provides some nice moments but also entertains you with great visual effects, good acting and simple amazing entertainment.
I:10;296;Ok, I wanted to see this movie in a big way.
I:10;297;This is one of those movies I had to see.
I:10;298;I was a big fan of the original.
I:10;299;Yeah I thought it was funny.
I:10;300;I loved it and wanted more so to hear about not one, but three T. rex's fighting Kong was awesome!
I:10;301;Well, for the most part I liked the fight scene.
I:10;302;I also agree with a previous review concerning Kong being seriously bit with little damage.
I:10;303;I also prefer the reveal of Kong in the first two Kong movies.
I:10;304;I'm still waiting for a great computer generated dinosaur fight with great editing and directing.
I:10;305;When the legendary director turned his eye to remaking a childhood favourite film: the classic tale of a giant ape, the woman he loved, and the planes that stood between them.
I:10;306;He put Jack Black in a (mostly) dramatic role, and for the role of Kong, he cast a human actor.
I:10;307;the result is an exercise in splendid, passionate, completely over.
I:10;308;Jackson, with those wacky geniuses at Weta Workshops behind him, throws himself completely into every detail of the production, digging deep into his creepy.
I:10;309;crawly, horror film past to deliver a rich and immersive world.
I:10;310;the performances are uniformly excellent, and filled with heart.
I:10;311;an absolute genius of an actor who's played a primate no less than twice in his career.
I:10;312;dropping performance as Kong manages to make the giant ape relatable and moving.
I:10;313;naomi Wattsis sympathetic and rather stunning as Ann Darrow, an actress who gets drawn into a singular relationship with a giant ape.
I:10;314;In the supporting cast, we find an excellent Jack Black and Adrien Brody, and Andy Serkis AGAIN, that man of many hats.
I:10;315;but what sets King Kong above your usual blockbuster is the level of detail put into the design of the film.
I:10;316;motion, Peter Jackson allows his imagination to run completely wild, conjuring a gorgeous land filled with terrifying and fantastical creatures.
I:10;317;crawlies all beset our heroes in true Hammer Horror fashion.
I:10;318;This is big, immersive, emotional and visual entertainment that doesn't reject plausibility so much as FLAUNT it's fantasticality!
I:10;319;On top of this, Peter Jackson clearly has respect for the original that shines through the CGI.
I:10;320;This is one giant of a film, about one giant of an ape!
I:10;321;If this review was helpful to you, please vote Yes!
I:10;322;It's a real cinematic wonder!
I:10;323;"Gorillas will defend members of their family to the death"" and ."
I:10;324;Kong laughed in the movie .
I:10;325;"Gorillas do laugh""This movie brings us what we seek in the movies ."
I:10;326;And it's pure cinema and pure entertaining!That said .
I:10;327;this is one of my 2005 favorite movies!Thanks .
I:10;328;for the wisdom and magic of Peter Jackson!It's reaaally good!
I:10;329;I have still to digest all I have seen and experienced.
I:10;330;This movie has been a labour of love and it shines.
I:10;331;If it was done right the first time, let it alone.
I:10;332;The original King Kong is a classic of imagination that captured this 9 year old boy as much as it did Peter Jackson at that age.
I:10;333;And we forgive its flaws because it is a ripping good yarn and,whether intentional or not,the great heart of the story is sadness at the beast's destruction.
I:10;334;It was an absolutely correct decision to keep King Kong in its original time of the 1930's, allowing Jackson to retain and expand the look of the original while deftly altering some of the original's quainter notions.
I:10;335;Jackson has kept the heart of the original, while having fun parodying some of its outdated concepts, especially with the stage show surrounding Kong's Broadway debut.
I:10;336;Keeping it in the 30's somehow also retains thesense of plausible wonder.
I:10;337;In the years since King Kong we have come to know that gorillas, while hugely powerful animals are rather shy and gentle vegetarians if not threatened.
I:10;338;It was overdue to correct the perception of the wild ape.
I:10;339;"Jackson had to choose between the ""monster on the loose"" aspect or a more subtle view of the beast, and I believe his choice was correct."
I:10;340;It is another brilliant stroke that helps explain the relationship that develops between Ann and Kong.
I:10;341;Jackson builds that recognition in Naomi Watt's Ann to a relationship of trust and care that is touching and moving.
I:10;342;The scene of them sliding on the ice in Central Park is beautiful and and absolutely inspired.
I:10;343;the other changes in the film are fine by me.
I:10;344;imagined stand on top of the Empire State Building in a gorgeously dawning New York.
I:10;345;A wonderful homage to the original, all the while retaining its own brilliance and integrity, this is a fine film, and Peter Jackson can be proud that he has paid tribute to the original all the while bringing to it his own heart and vision.
I:10;346;The film is fantastic on many levels.
I:10;347;ray disc yet,but am certain it is also very impressive indeed.
I:10;348;It was a very enjoyable movie once it started.
I:10;349;plots that added complexity when I was just looking to enjoy a King Kong movie.
I:10;350;My suggestion is to view this movie in a theater with comfortable seats.
I:10;351;Peter Jackson's King Kong is a magnificent, fun filled, epic masterpiece!
I:10;352;The two lead characters, Ann Darrow played by the wonderful Naomi Watts and Kong himself, played in part by Andy Serkis and in part by a team of computer animators will thrill you with the tragic tale of a lonely, giant, montrous ape who falls for a beautiful girl from New York City.
I:10;353;Kong is so beautufully rendered in this film, you will swear he is real.
I:10;354;the best CGI character ever put on celluloid.
I:10;355;And fasten your seat belts when Kong fights a trio of V. rexes in the middle of the film to save Ann, it's a top.
I:10;356;As a whole, the film will take you on roller.
I:10;357;journey from depression era New York City to Skull Island and back all the way up to the top of the Empire State Building where Jackson directs a finale that will leave you both breathless and heart.
I:10;358;The best film of the year in my opinion, and maybe even the best film I've seen in a long, long time.
I:10;359;i've seen a speacial about KIN KONG and Peter Jackson said that he is working on a new version of it,but never thought it will be that good.
I:10;360;Delivered in an exceptional amount of time.
I:10;361;Still in plastic wrapper, so it's the definition of brand new.
I:10;362;The s&h isn't even too bad, so I thought it was well worth it.
I:10;363;ray, that makes everything so much better!
I:10;364;I enjoyed the original King Kong but this remake with Naomi Watts, Adrian Brody and Jack Black is one of the best.
I:10;365;i've never had any special attachment to the King Kong franchise, but I have always found the premise intriguing and a joy to watch.
I:10;366;But of course it was an older film and that film is still superior to most horror/adventure films to this day.
I:10;367;But now times have changed and today's movie plot's have changed and I think this remake came at a good time.
I:10;368;Another reason I appreciate this film is because Peter Jackson grew up a big fan of the original classic and he had a passion for this project, and you can tell by the finishing product.
I:10;369;"Ann's struggle finding work as an actress, and her struggle to survive after being captured by Kong, Carl Denham's who is struggling as a film director and feels he has a chance to revive his career if he can find ""Skull Island"" and film it, Jack Driscoll's love for Ann and of course Kong's, who is a lonely animal and probably the last of his species."
I:10;370;"But there are also many other sub plots with the men of the ""Venture"" and they are also interesting to follow."
I:10;371;King Kong and the creatures all look absolutely fantastic, and Kong's eyes really have emotion in them.
I:10;372;The commentary with Peter Jackson is incredibly interesting as well, and pretty funny actually.
I:10;373;There are so many lengthy and interesting documentaries you will just be amazed.
I:10;374;Peter Jackson has done it again.
I:10;375;One of my favorite movies of all time.
I:10;376;Yet, I thought the effects were top notch and also that there was some great action sequences.
I:10;377;Basically the story is there is a big ape, the ape likes a girl, and the ape wrecks the city.
I:10;378;First off let me say the movie was great.
I:10;379;Awesome special effects of Kong, Dinos, Scenery, Etc. got a little hokey at times, but still very enjoyable.
I:10;380;From what I have read, this movie received Oscars for Best Sound and Best Sound Editing.
I:10;381;"I have a feeling that Universal will release a ""4 Disc"" Special Edition a year from now and claim ""Now Available in DTS"" so they can make a few extra bucks."
I:10;382;The best part of the film was when they fight the giant insects.
I:10;383;The insect part was great.
I:10;384;I'll make this review quick, because this epic masterpiece is just.
I:10;385;, it was something truly one.
I:10;386;To this day it is considered a masterpiece of filmmaking, largely (of course) due to the mighty title character and the incredible animation which really made the picture so convincingly powerful.
I:10;387;Because, quite simply, he loved the original, and felt that it deserved to be everything that it was and more, for audiences young and old, then and forever.
I:10;388;first off, Kong is truly the main star, of course.
I:10;389;well, his acting really, he truly is the best silent actor in decades.
I:10;390;i've been a Naomi Watts fan for a rather brief time now, but after seeing her here, I hold her in high regards as one of my new favorite actresses.
I:10;391;As talented as she is downright gorgeous, she really packs a wallop, and her chemistry with Kong is heartwarming and tragic.
I:10;392;I've always found him to be hilarious .
I:10;393;Was he going to be funny?
I:10;394;this was a perfect casting.
I:10;395;And now, seeing him play as the screenwriter.
I:10;396;hero in _King Kong_, I must say I hold him in high regards as a very talented actor, and I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing him in more roles.
I:10;397;the scenery (especially the incredible recreation of 1930's New York) was gorgeous, thick on atmosphere as well as culturally precise.
I:10;398;"the special effects were downright spectacular
I:10;399;the score and soundtrack were excellent.
I:10;400;from '30's songs that had both lyrical and cultural significance to the film and the setting, respectively, to James Newton Howard's effective compositions, the music was excellently involved.
I:10;401;this movie is the result of a fan's dedication to a favored piece of art.
I:10;402;create this movie without making it just another remake.
I:10;403;He took something already great and made it even better.
I:10;404;_King Kong_ is definitely the best movie I've seen all year.
I:10;405;All the special effects, technological advances and 70+ years of movie making progress and Peter Jackson can't hold a candle to the original.
I:10;406;i could cut about 1 hour out of this movie and make it better, but it would still take a distant back seat to the original.
I:10;407;I can appreciate that Jackson, along with the spectacular LOTR's tilogy, is a wonderful visionary and knows how to do action to rival Cameron and Speilberg.
I:10;408;I loved the atmosphere of when they got to Skull Island in the fog.
I:10;409;Developing a romance before Ann is captured would also have been nice.
I:10;410;The great thing sbaout LOTR's is that it developed the chracters enough so yo cared what happened to them.
I:10;411;Yes, taht's true, but you can still develop your characters more in a 2.3 hour movie enough to care about them.
I:10;412;He is and will always be a COMIC actor.
I:10;413;I don't fault Jackson, as I said he is one amazing visionary.
I:10;414;Plus Andy Serkis, well apologes to the actual actor, does another terriffic job as a CGI character.
I:10;415;"This Kong spend a lot more time developing the ""relationship"" with Ann and Kong and it did it rather successfully IMO."
I:10;416;It is a bit long, but it is a great film.
I:10;417;I just came back from seeing the movie and I am still astounded how great this movie is!!
I:10;418;Compared to the original which is a great movie, this one is better by a lot.
I:10;419;After a fierce storm, they are on the island.
I:10;420;Meanwhile, Kong and Naomi start as enemies, but slowly, a beauty and the beast relationship starts to show.
I:10;421;this movie was fantastic, no doubt about it.
I:10;422;The characters were great, the special effects were amazing, and the whole movie was just astounding.
I:10;423;The truth is, most people thought of King Kong as a joke.
I:10;424;with the very timely energy crisis subplot .
I:10;425;the 21st century King Kong not only features an utterly convincing giant gorilla and actual compelling characters and a great Depression.
I:10;426;era setting, it also is the scariest dinosaur/giant monster movie to date.
I:10;427;Combined with the best version of Kong's climactic stand.
I:10;428;off with the fighter planes, this is easily the best version of the classic story to date.
I:10;429;It's worth it, but be prepared for at least one intermission along the way.
I:10;430;peter Jackon's King Kong gets my highest possible recommendation for fans of the previous films, the Jurassic Park series, the radiant Naomi Watts, Peter Jackson or giant monster movies in general.
I:10;431;i seriously enjoyed every moment of this film.
I:10;432;my favorite part was the dinosaur chase.
I:10;433;The story honestly didn't disappoint.
I:10;434;i believe this movie deserved all the attention it received about a year ago.
I:10;435;It really is good, and it really is believable that a giant ape is chasing a bunch of people around.
I:10;436;Oh, by the way, Naomi Watts is now the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
I:10;437;The interaction between her and King Kong was totally believable and emotional, and I can't believe I'm saying that!
I:10;438;Peter Jackson takes the metaphor, if you can bring an unprecedented find to the world for the price of an admission ticket, you've got a spectacular show.
I:10;439;And King Kong delivers on the premise in sheer scope, cenematic beauty, and bigger.
I:10;440;The production was phenomenal in almost every way.
I:10;441;In every other scene, the work was awesome, detailed, and completely credibly produced.
I:10;442;Kong is a sympathetic character with a soft spot for Ann Darrow.
I:10;443;Worth the 3 hours of pure enjoyment.
I:10;444;"The casting did little to allay fears
I:10;445;"old film classic, and not fall on his face?The answer is a resounding YES!The new ""King Kong"", at over three hours in length, is about as perfect a 'monster movie' as has ever been made, and is a feast for the senses."
I:10;446;infested islands are a Disney theme park ride!
I:10;447;around' opening and spectacular climax in 1933 New York City are equally amazing.
I:10;448;perfect, they capture the 'feel' of Depression.
I:10;449;best of all, the story itself is actually an improvement over the original, without sacrificing those elements everyone loves.
I:10;450;Carl Denham is still the opportunistic huckster embodied earlier by Robert Armstrong, but Jack Black adds elements of Orson Welles and P. t. Barnum to the mix, creating a character you can both love and hate.
I:10;451;created ape (pantomimed by Andy Serkis) are astonishing, together!
I:10;452;The sensitivity of the relationship, in the midst of all of the chaos, is the glue that truly holds the film together.
I:10;453;and makes the climax a heartbreaking, unforgettable experience.
I:10;454;Both performances are certainly Oscar.
I:10;455;worthy (quite a feat for a giant ape that doesn't even exist!)
I:10;456;"Peter Jackson has exceeded even the highest expectations with his vision of ""King Kong"", and while it is likely to only win a few technical Oscars, it is, honestly, a better film than ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" (which, great as it was, doesn't stand 'by itself' nearly as well)."
I:10;457;"rAY"" hit the stores this summer."
I:10;458;Yes I loved the movie, and love the way he makes movies.
I:10;459;After the first hour I was squirming in my seat, wishing I was at home doing something interesting.
I:10;460;It's not one of the best but it was marvellous and good making.
I:10;461;second: it's for him because he has the power and the finance.
I:10;462;The two cross paths just in time to catch the tramp steamer that will carry them to Singapore (yeah right).
I:10;463;well done by today's standard.
I:10;464;Some of the characters may have changed vocations, yet the story still floes smoothly.
I:10;465;In come ways it is an improvement over the original.
I:10;466;I loved the first King Kong movie in black and white.
I:10;467;But this movie was for me more enjoyable because of the special effects.
I:10;468;The dinosaur fights were excellent.
I:10;469;I loved the developement with King Kong as having a personality and the interaction between him and the girl.
I:10;470;She even uses her vaudville act on Kong and he pretends to not be ammused but she wins him over eventually.
I:10;471;He is a bit of a ham and overacts at times but that is his nature.
I:10;472;The scene lasted over ten minutes (or seemed like it) and makes the movie out of reach of most children to enjoy.
I:10;473;The jungle scenes alone are breathtaking in their clarity, color and sharpness.
I:10;474;like, and you can distinctly tell they are working with green screen.
I:10;475;i think the effects depicting Kong himself are very well done.
I:10;476;good in the role) as a struggling actress.
I:10;477;good in the part, BTW.
I:10;478;in KONG '33, the giant ape's battle with a T. rex is a highlight (and an inspiration for many filmmakers, including Steven Spielberg).
I:10;479;"Because it's the 21st Century now (""been there, done that""), Kong here."
I:10;480;while Kong battles huge bats [!]
I:10;481;At this point, Jackson does an interesting homage to Kong '33 by having the on.
I:10;482;There are some terrific shots here, though Ann.
I:10;483;in Dino style, photographers stand on the dead Kong's chest for photos, Denham delivers the famous beauty.
I:10;484;Obviously, the effects are far better.
I:10;485;but once Kong tangles with the T. rex, things get good and stay good.
I:10;486;In short, Jackson and company have made a good film.
I:10;487;The best part of the whole film is the ape.
I:10;488;If you want to see King Kong, the original is still by far the best.
I:10;489;Peter Jackson is a talented director, but he doesn't seem to know the difference between a roller coaster ride and a film.
I:10;490;While the animation is very detailed and true to form.
I:10;491;small point I personally would have liked more time exploring Skull Island!
I:10;492;"The ""Skull Island a Natural History"" is remarkably well done I personally found it more interesting and entertaining than the Feature."
I:10;493;Also I was impressed by Kong's New York 1933 which adds much to the times that Kong is set.
I:10;494;The movie had some good action scenes in it with Kong fighting the T. rex and when he was in New York on top of the Empire State Building.
I:10;495;disc Widescreen Special Edition) is a special effects dream come true.
I:10;496;In fact one could call it a special effects bonanza.
I:10;497;The script is well written, the acting is alright for a monster movie, come on it is not like you expect a Shakespeare performance in this kind of movie so the acting does the job with high grades indeed.
I:10;498;I love the music, the editing is top rated.
I:10;499;"Not that I doubt his ability as a filmmaker, he proved his worth with ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies."
I:10;500;It's just that 1933 film is a classic beloved by all and, often, revered as the best giant monster flick ever made.
I:10;501;In everyway possible, he offered a fresh approach to the original story and movie.
I:10;502;star cast, this 3 hour epic is one of the best movies I've seen in recent memory.
I:10;503;Think of it as one part classic Kong, and one part Jurassic Park with a dash of modern day revisioning and you got a modern day Kong flick worth watching.
I:10;504;I'm glad I got the movie.
I:10;505;Even so, I feel Jackson's version is better in many respects.
I:10;506;At any rate, King Kong is a great and exciting movie.
I:10;507;Definitely worth getting and adding to your collection.
I:10;508;Talk about taking a relatively simple straightforward plot and extending it beyond all reasonable comprehension.
I:10;509;Clarification: I enjoy immensely most of Peter Jackson's material.
I:10;510;good points:Peter Jackson directed it.
I:10;511;Thus it has excellent use of the epic film style.
I:10;512;beautiful actress to play the classic damsel in distress, with a solid acting performance to back it up.
I:10;513;for once, excellent serious acting on Jack Black's part.
I:10;514;solid near flawless computer graphics for every scene requiring it.
I:10;515;fantastic musical score that seamlessly fit into every scene.
I:10;516;One bug scene was enough, thank you.
I:10;517;T. rex dinosaur fight with the big ape.
I:10;518;this films has me watching it time and again.
I:10;519;watts is beautiful and genuine in this film.
I:10;520;jack black is terrific as the over obsessive director doing anything he can to get this film back to hollywood.
I:10;521;`King Kong', the second remake by master fantasy director, Peter Jackson is a major improvement over the first remake (which, however, is not quite as bad as some may have said), but somehow, it does not quite manage to outdo the impact of the original, when you pro.
I:10;522;rate the advances in special effects technology against the great impression made by the original.
I:10;523;Many scenes which never made it to the trailer are even more impressive than the highlights.
I:10;524;In fact, all the business between the landing on Skull Island and the contact between Kong and Watts is a major improvement over the first two movies.
I:10;525;There are two easy reasons.
I:10;526;First, this is a remake, so most of the credit for the story and most of the images which were invented in the original movie and simply enhanced by Jackson and his crew.
I:10;527;Second, this is easily seen as simply a clever action fantasy story, while `Lord of the Rings' involved an epic battle between good and evil, spearheaded not by a crew armed with guns and modern chemicals, but with simple grit and courage.
I:10;528;I agree with this, adding to it that some of the new scenes on Skull Island, especially those involving some fantastical new creatures and the oversized insects simply do nothing to move the story forward.
I:10;529;That the original movie did such a great job of telling its story in about 90 minutes makes one wonder why Jackson couldn't match them scene for scene and be done with it.
I:10;530;It is understandable that he wants to be seen as improving on the original, but since he does that in so many demonstrable ways, why draw it out as well.
I:10;531;one improvement which works is Naomi Watts' business with Kong on Skull Island and her relation with the big ape in general.
I:10;532;This change works well with casting Jack Black as Denham.
I:10;533;Black fits the scoundrel's role far better than an Indiana Jones hero type actor.
I:10;534;While interesting, Jackson's opening miniature feature on the contrast between New York wealth and depression poverty is very well done, but it contributes little to the story.
I:10;535;the greatest benefit of the new effects technology, much of it created by Jackson's own effects company for `Lord of the Rings', is the characterization of Kong, done by computer enhancement of a live actor (Andy Serkis, who is best known for being the voice and business behind the Gollum character).
I:10;536;I prefer to think that Lange was giving us an excellent performance of a character who was a dumb blond and thereby made a major improvement on Fay Wray's characterization.
I:10;537;If you'd prefer only one version and are not interested in the special features, I recommend the extended cut as the scenes added back in are definately worth it.
I:10;538;Peter Jackson's KING KONG heaps a great deal of cheese on the viewer but the view is spectacular and the heart wrenching final episodes are exactly why movies are made and what separates the good from the bad.
I:10;539;ray and the sound is equally amazing.
I:10;540;In scene after plodding scene, Jackson has the gorilla and the starlet look longingly in each other's eyes.
I:10;541;"One is reminded of the Spinal Tap lyric, ""And it feels so real, you can feel the feeling."""
I:10;542;up the film with a parallel plot line that is pure video game.
I:10;543;There was Orson Wells, Steven Spielberg, and now there's Peter Jackson.
I:10;544;when I first heard that Jackson would follow up the Lord of the Rings trilogy with a remake of King Kong, I was really curious and interested to see what it would be like, but also wondered what he could bring new to the project.
I:10;545;well, now it's out and I have to say Jackson nailed it!
I:10;546;This is a big, long movie with as much heart as special effects.
I:10;547;roger Ebert said that Naomi Watts deserves an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Ann Darrow and I must concur.
I:10;548;a wise decision based on 20/20 hindsight and the 1976 remake.
I:10;549;There are even a couple of cute lines and scenes which reference the original movie.
I:10;550;the Carl Denham character is probably the most poorly cast, but it still works well.
I:10;551;street girl Denham picks to star in his movie, as in the original.
I:10;552;She's a vaudeville performer who's just lost her job (it does take place in the Great Depression, after all).
I:10;553;She aspires to be an actress, but as we first see her has almost sunk to the level of considering a burlesque job.
I:10;554;She has feelings and depth.
I:10;555;As events play out on Skull Island, she uses her vaudeville skills to divert Kong.
I:10;556;After Kong saves her life multiple times, she forms a complex bond with him.
I:10;557;She shows him kindness and understanding, and he becomes her protector.
I:10;558;He's also deliberately not physically the hero type, which makes his heroism all the more impressive.
I:10;559;A hero on screen, he's basically a coward who discovers just enough of a real hero inside him to save the day at a critical moment on the island.
I:10;560;One delightful scene has Kong playing on the Central Park ice rink with Ann Darrow .
I:10;561;one brief playful moment whose spell is broken by artillery fire.
I:10;562;this film succeeds on every level it attempts.
I:10;563;It's a great action movie, but also a great love story with real heart and a message to convey about the nature of love and loyalty.
I:10;564;A beautifully filmed tragic fantasy of a force of nature finding a little solace before its inescapable demise.
I:10;565;This movie was very well done and fun to watch.
I:10;566;this is a beauty of a film.
I:10;567;good acting, solid storyline, the best special effects you can imagine, action, drama, horror, comedy.
I:10;568;it's a great movie ( a little long but thrilling nonetheless).
I:10;569;They managed to keep you on the edge in many parts while relaxing a little in others.
I:10;570;For a new version of a classic it really did the original justice and then some.
I:10;571;It could have been easily split into 2 parts but was well worth leaving it as one as well.
I:10;572;I think this a good bi.yearly video.
I:10;573;This movie is a gem.
I:10;574;Peter Jackson has demonstrated some fine work through this remake.
I:10;575;"All and all the movie has enough ""it"" to make it great."
I:10;576;It definitly is a watch, and although I didn't see it in a theatre, the special effects are so realistic and thrilling i'm sure it was awesome.
I:10;577;when you tell a story in classic form, it's important that your audience cares about your characters.
I:10;578;his achievement of Lord of the Rings earned him respect.
I:10;579;The visuals were good, but the gymnastic abilities of the characters was a bit much.
I:10;580;The basic story is intact, and there's lots of color and action.
I:10;581;flopping stuff flying and crashing everywhere action.
I:10;582;A more recent example is the disorienting urban fight scene in Transformers, an otherwise superior movie.
I:10;583;THIS one finally gets all the story right, with spectactular effects, acting, script, cinematography, directing, the whole enchilada.
I:10;584;Because, they include all the pathos, and the whole portrayal is the most authentic to the idea.
I:10;585;First time I've ever even liked the story, is with this version.
I:10;586;I understand the film is a throwback to the original but I don't think having the actor's perform the way they did in 1933 helped the picture in any way, shape or form.
I:10;587;It's the movie i wanted brand new in the package an adds more scenes to the movie, and amazing on blu ray.
I:10;588;in Jackson's version, I highly enjoyed the relaxed intro in New York.
I:10;589;this movie is absolutely true to the spirit of the original, showing an unusual reverence in a remake for its predecessor.
I:10;590;If you liked the original Kong, and especially if you first saw it as a child, you will love this one.
I:10;591;Although the character itself is undeniably shallow, Black's depth of performance is far superior to either Robert Armstrong in the original, or Charles Grodin's in the '76 release.
I:10;592;Hype can be a dangerous thing, look at Star Wars Episode 1 for the best example.
I:10;593;Being a huge LOTR fan I started watching this film expecting Peter Jackson to present me with a Epic that had a strong cast with emotional and spine chilling moments.
I:10;594;it was beauty who killed the beast.
I:10;595;There are so many great images and attentions to detail theaverage viewer would have to watch a few times to catch even a handfull of them.
I:10;596;disc edition which also containsKing Kong post production log among other features.
I:10;597;The movieitself is beautiful 2.35 transfer which brings out all the greatsights from the lush jungle of Kong's island to the harsh stone island of depression era New York.
I:10;598;This is one film every King Kong fan should have.
I:10;599;King Kong is a splendid motion picture.
I:10;600;It has the scope and spectacle of films like Titanic and Jurassic Park, yet has the intimacy of any low.
I:10;601;budget character drama packed into a grand film.
I:10;602;She does a magnificent job forming a relationship with a the giant ape.
I:10;603;These special effects, sets, makeup, costumes, etc. are undeniably some of the best ever put on screen.
I:10;604;Peter Jackson's technical department deserves all praise and honor for their efforts.
I:10;605;There are characters in the film, whom we share intimate, personal moments with, and then there is no follow.
I:10;606;king Kong is grand filmmaking.
I:10;607;Something we've all seen before, but, it's done in such a way that it still captures our imaginations, and we know we won't see a grand epic like this for another few years.
I:10;608;Enter Ann Darrow ( Watts ), a wide.
I:10;609;i absolutely loved this movie.
I:10;610;I consider it a classic, right alongside the original.
I:10;611;Peter Jackson is one of the best directors out there, and you can tell his love of film in the way he has preserved the suspense and mystery in the legend of Kong.
I:10;612;The casting is terrific, especially Watts, who although she must spend the entire movie screaming, gives it her all in every pout.
I:10;613;Also worth noting is Jack Black, who proves himself able to do more than slapstick, in the role of a overconfident and overambitious director.
I:10;614;But the true star of the movie is Kong, a behemoth of a gorilla, who stirs a multitude of emotion in the audience, with nothing more than a single growl.
I:10;615;My biggest complaint is the incredible number of facial closeups of Ann Darrow starring at Kong, a dinosaur, or something else.
I:10;616;The acting is fairly well through out with no one particularly standing out.
I:10;617;this version of King Kong adds othing to the story or characters except about an extra hour or so of running time.
I:10;618;But Hollywood can do special effects .
I:10;619;that's one of its few strengths .
I:10;620;Hence, King Kong 2005 is a natural, super.
I:10;621;sized with all the special effects that were a real challenge to make credible in the earlier versions.
I:10;622;And this new one has been PETA.
I:10;623;sized, with an added component: not only can a giant dark ape fall in love with a beautiful blond white woman, but a beautiful blond white woman can fall in love with a giant dark ape.
I:10;624;Standing over the defeated Kong's limp, crushed body just toppled from the great monument to civilization, Jack Black (stupidly) concludes: beauty killed the beast.
I:10;625;It will be interesting to see if this is the film for Blu.
I:10;626;"ray that the industry hoped ""The Dark Knight"" would be ."
I:10;627;"The way things are right now, I doubt any movie is going to give that kind of jolt, but if it's possible, ""King Kong"" might be the one to do it."
I:10;628;This is a loooong movie.
I:10;629;It is extremely intense at times, and there are several scenes where people are killed.
I:10;630;ray portion as much as possible.
I:10;631;I will say that this is a very entertaining film .
I:10;632;but exciting and enjoyable in a blockbuster sort of way.
I:10;633;, I'd recommend this to anyone that I thought could handle the intensity.
I:10;634;Terrific effects, and regardless of their status, relatively unobtrusive acting.
I:10;635;I'd call it a 4.5, but the darn thing's more fun than a barrel full of monkeys, so I'm rounding up.
I:10;636;King Kong is a very entertaining movie with a lot of emotion, its epic, funny and very disturbing when those over grown bugs start swarming in on the humans,haha.
I:10;637;Overall though, it is a must see and the computer graphics on King Kong are amazing.
I:10;638;Not as good as the graphics in Transformers, but definitely good
I:10;639;there's a very good two.
I:10;640;old I work with told me when she watched King Kong at the movies she cried at the end.
I:10;641;I thought she must have misunderstood what movie I was talking about.
I:10;642;She said the ape was so real.
I:10;643;Again, I thought she meant real from the standpoint of special effects.
I:10;644;Heinrich Zimmer said those things that are most important can never be put to words.
I:10;645;the humanity with which Kong is imbued in this movie is absolutely astounding.
I:10;646;Who but a Peter Jackson whould ever be proud enough to lend such subtle and human traits to a computer animated being?
I:10;647;Who but a Peter Jackson could actually succeed in making something so delicate work?
I:10;648;That wild innocence is seen in Kong and his relationship to Beauty, Ann Darrow.
I:10;649;And, in his completely innocent love for Ann, we see a transcendent nature we as humans strive all our lives to regain.
I:10;650;king Kong lends itself to many psychological interpretations because it deals with pure archetypes.
I:10;651;Ann Darrow, the Beauty to Kong's Beast, is a representation of all that is worth fighting for in life, all that means something.
I:10;652;In Ann and Kong we have the perfect Ying and Yang, the pure blending of the pairs of opposites.
I:10;653;that proudest achievement of our industrial history: the airplane.
I:10;654;Pure Freud.Yes, the special effects in this film are even more spectacular than what Jackson did in The Trilogy of the Rings.
I:10;655;The fight scenes are incredible.
I:10;656;But, proving that he is more than just a film technician, through the elemental aspects of this story, Jackson proves he is the most intelligent director doing mainstream movies today.
I:10;657;This man and the people he surrounds himself with are the most talented film makers making films today.
I:10;658;King Kong is an instant classic in anybody's book.
I:10;659;The only thing that saves this film from deserving the worst rating possible are the excellent special effects.
I:10;660;"The dinosaurs also look fabulous
I:10;661;Besides the visuals, the movie also has heart.
I:10;662;He really does a terrific job of playing a driven movie producer.
I:10;663;Naomi Watts is a wonderfully modern damsel in distress.
I:10;664;The story is well adapted, and it works.
I:10;665;Peter Jackson's King Kong is a quintessential cinematic masterpiece.
I:10;666;Very well done, but from Peter Jackson the maker of Lord of the Rings, I wouldn't expect less.
I:10;667;Excellent production values and good acting make this well worth seeing.
I:10;668;Overall I was very impressed with the movie.
I:10;669;All my family felt it was to long.
I:10;670;Don't get me wrong it is well done and certainly in competition with the original and far above the other remake.
I:10;671;So those of you that love it blindly give me some credit for not being all glassy eyed over it, and those that think it stunk give me some credit for being objective about it.
I:10;672;king kong was one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:10;673;If you like emotional movies you will like this one too.
I:10;674;We see later though, as he forms a relationship with naomi watts, that he is capable of love and emotion.
I:10;675;I was in love with the movie by the time it ended.
I:10;676;It certainly seemed like a recipe for a winner to have modern CGI special effects in support of a remake of the classic story and an obviously talented and capable director at the helm.
I:10;677;Perhaps to be loved only by great Kong fans who want to believe this is a treasure.
I:10;678;A great testament to the all the problems with Hollywood films today.
I:10;679;Fresh from his monumental success and Academy Awards with his work on The Lord of the Rings, I wasn't confident that he would make an equally, much less surpassively, good film.
I:10;680;so take care of your bladders prior to watching.
I:10;681;It keeps the audience in the hearts and minds of everything that happens onscreen and therefore maintains an engaging atmosphere.
I:10;682;All in all, you care about all the fuss and you watch and wait, with interest, for the next scene to unfold.
I:10;683;Therefore, in spite of the gargantuan runtime, I was riveted to the screen.
I:10;684;When he learns his latest film is about to be scrapped, he escapes with his film and crew to continue production.
I:10;685;He convinces his cast and ship crew that they will be heading for Singapore to film.
I:10;686;He then takes popular theater writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) to continue the script while the ship sails for Skull Island.
I:10;687;There is the scene of a shared sunset between Ann and Kong with volumes of depth.
I:10;688;and ultimately the audience's delight).
I:10;689;It is their shared moments of joy that solidify an unusual bond of friendship between Ann and Kong.
I:10;690;it is the relationship between Ann and Kong that Jackson decided to concentrate his full filmmaking abilities and rightfully so.
I:10;691;"top acting fits perfectly for Carl, a filmmaker with so much passion for his film that he continually tries to sell it to everyone just so they ""get it""."
I:10;692;king Kong, I would have to say, is one of the best films of the year.
I:10;693;Entirely engaging and a delightful and sometimes frightening adventure, it is one with definite heart.
I:10;694;wrenching denoument, Jackson has made a film that beats on it's chest and roars.
I:10;695;Peter Jackson is a man who has done some other excellent movies, and this one is definitely not the exception.
I:10;696;to begin with, the main actors are very good, and they play their roles perfectly.
I:10;697;Naomi Watts really broke our heart when she saw King Kong while he was attacked, Jack Black also does a great performance, even though at one point I wanted him to be dead (for the story), and Adrien Brody has always been a terrifir actor who can play any character you tell him to.
I:10;698;the special effects are quite great too, King Kong looks excellent in the movie, and it looks very real, but its face just changes a bit in some scenes.
I:10;699;The rest of the movie is great, sometimes you think one thing, and the next minute you think this other thing, so it's not a predictable movie (off the record: and I like that, because I hate predictable movies!!)
I:10;700;So, story and ending: 9/10.
I:10;701;I have to be honest about that.
I:10;702;I was expecting for something regular, but I got something incredible!
I:10;703;After I saw the new version, I'm convinced this is the best version ever.
I:10;704;Full of magnificent visual effects, very convincing.
I:10;705;The new dino scenes are magnificent full of action and adrenaline, very convincing and they add a lot more to the plot, than simply action.
I:10;706;This new version has more thought put into it.
I:10;707;It was very smart to change them for bats.
I:10;708;Naomi Watts is one of my favorite actresses.
I:10;709;This film will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.
I:10;710;the action is superb and gripping from moment to moment.
I:10;711;The story is no new story but every King Kong out there has his own way of handling the beauty he is entranced by.
I:10;712;That's what keeps us coming back for every new one that comes out.
I:10;713;Jack Black is surprisingly good as Carl Denham.
I:10;714;Even though he reminds me more of filmmaker/actor legend Orson Wells than original KK's Bob Armstrong I was impressed with his satisfying take of Carl Denham.
I:10;715;As for comely Naomi Watts she is effective as Ann Darrow as well.
I:10;716;Even though this is the second remake of the original King Kong, Peter Jackson did a wonderful job.
I:10;717;With any remake, comparisons to the original are inevitable, especially if the original happens to be a beloved classic generally regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.
I:10;718;"While the latest rehash was intended as an ""homage"" to the original, it can't even stand on its own as an example of good filmmaking."
I:10;719;The original KONG accomplished this by setting new filmmaking standards in special effects, music scoring and sound recording.
I:10;720;Everything comes together so seamlessly in the film that its merits can easily be taken for granted, and often are.
I:10;721;greatness is largely measured by originality, and on that note Jackson's film is nothing more than a plagiarism of Merian C. Cooper's original concept.
I:10;722;offs of dialogue and musical cues lifted from the original.
I:10;723;scale and miniature rear projection, in.
I:10;724;The overall results seem even more remarkable today, especially since that brand of genuine artistry has been replaced by generic, computer simulated effects.
I:10;725;In the original, Bruce Cabot played the part as it was called for .
I:10;726;a tough, true to the era seaman who, like his rival Kong, is gradually softened by falling for Fay Wray.
I:10;727;whereas the original KONG tells its story with vivid, no.
I:10;728;the beast protecting his beauty.
I:10;729;It sets up Kong's re.
I:10;730;capture of Ann since he follows her out of the theater and sees her run into a hotel.
I:10;731;and it stayed its hand from killing.
I:10;732;and beauty stayed his hand.
I:10;733;Note that in Cooper's original text it's beauty's face that stays the beast's hand.
I:10;734;It's a classic fable of unrequited love.
I:10;735;Peter Jackson proves that his success from The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy was no fluke.
I:10;736;Thanks to This Remake, King Kong is popular once again.
I:10;737;Jack Black is great and the lovely Naomi Watts is the perfect damsel in distress.
I:10;738;The oceanic voyage coupled with all of the fierce escape and adventure type action on Skull Island was excellent!
I:10;739;Overall great performances by Black and Watts and I really must tell you, if you want some adventure, this one takes Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park to a whole new level.
I:10;740;The bonus features on the widescreen edition are just okay, but I think I enjoy this enough to pick up the better set that includes multiple discs.
I:10;741;Awesome remake of the this classic.
I:10;742;The score was phenomenal!Naomi Watts' beauty was adequate without being distracting and Jack Blacks performance one of his best.
I:10;743;the kids loved it, too.
I:10;744;They were good to begin with.
I:10;745;the first hour was fine, and was comedic.
I:10;746;I guess I'm kind of picky: I like movies that are entertaining.
I:10;747;Every scene in a movie should contribute something to the plot or character development.
I:10;748;It makes it really hard to watch an action scene when the viewer can see a visual difference between the actors and the effects.
I:10;749;Granted, this is a sci.
I:10;750;And the boat appeared to be smaller than King Kong.
I:10;751;seaworthy boat got the big ape back to New York.
I:10;752;ride home in this movie.
I:10;753;I liked this a little beter than Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings.
I:10;754;I think this movie was very good I think that Peter Jackson the director of this movie did a good job on it.
I:10;755;mo with a bright, heavenly light behind her, up to a dazzled Kong.
I:10;756;and sure, the special effects were fine and dandy, they were an eye sore of technical achievement.
I:10;757;I was expecting a sympathetic character, a creature with a respectable sense of age and weight.
I:10;758;this is the Hollywood formula at it's finest.
I:10;759;It's got great production values, expensive effects, big name actors, a big name property, clean cinematography, and no soul.
I:10;760;It is far less realistic or exciting than the original.
I:10;761;This movie has much more action and adventure on Skull Island than did the original.
I:10;762;If you like special effects, you'll love this movie.
I:10;763;I love this movie even if it is a remake.
I:10;764;I love all the effects and all the action in the movie.
I:10;765;Keeps you entertained from the beginning to the end.
I:10;766;This will be great for your collection.
I:10;767;But this is a fantasy movie, an escapist diversion designed to entertain, which it does quite well.
I:10;768;But for the most part the action is outstanding, especially Kong's battle with three tyranosaurs and the scenery and sets are wonderful.
I:10;769;He was able to make a CGI monkey not only believable, but a powerful character in his own right.
I:10;770;He is the last of his kind and his human.
I:10;771;like pathos is amazing and palpable.
I:10;772;"He really should win some sort of award for ""best digital actor"" or whatever you would call it as it is a new category marvelously pioneered by he, PJ and the effects folks."
I:10;773;Kong is ultimately destroyed by his love for Ann Darrow portrayed by Naomi Watts and it is this relationship, his love and her sympathy and empathy for this lonely king that makes this movie so compelling.
I:10;774;Kong is a tragic and sympathetic figure.
I:10;775;The moment he dies you can see the light go out of his eyes, a remarkable bit of CGI wizardry and it is truly sad.
I:10;776;"As Jack Black says at the end of the movie with dialog lifted verbatim from the original, ""twas beauty killed the beast."
I:10;777;There's enough to keep you occupied for some time.
I:10;778;director Peter Jackson did an excellent take on re.
I:10;779;doing the mythos of the best.
I:10;780;ever 1930's monster flick King Kong, repackaged with modern day special effects and production for the silver screen.
I:10;781;and what peculiarity there is it's that I always find Ms. Watts incredibly attractive.
I:10;782;however this rendition of Kong is a great move for director Peter Jackson, whom prior to the LOTR series is one whom I personally have on my lists amongst great movie directors above Steven Spielberg.
I:10;783;GOOD STUFF, I love this remake of the original.
I:10;784;If you like monster movies with a plot, this is the King of Monster movies.
I:10;785;The digital effect and realisim is as good as it can be!
I:10;786;Blu Ray makes this huge!!!!!
I:10;787;It'll get technical awards and MAYBE a best actress?
I:10;788;Yet, it's still a fantastic movie and in my opinion, the best movie of the year.
I:10;789;They'll give her one this time because she should have won the last 2 years.
I:10;790;the time period was a great choice.
I:10;791;From the moment that the adventures/moviemakers set foot on Skull island, the movie shifts into high gear and never again lets up.
I:10;792;finally, the ending sequence was AMAZING!
I:10;793;The camera circled with the planes and it was awe inspiring to watch.
I:10;794;See it for the action.
I:10;795;See it for the love story.
I:10;796;Though I'll always have a special place in my nostalgic heart for the black and white version, this re.
I:10;797;Though this screenplay sometimes risked going 'over the top' with the action scenes between people and various creatures, I loved it.
I:10;798;Worth watching over and over.
I:10;799;The fact that they've come so far in special effects helped add to the immense impact of this movie.
I:10;800;Also, having the characters in color helps one see the facial expressions of the actors, and the facial expressions and emotions shown through the eyes increases the intensity and enhances the bond between 'beauty and beast'.
I:10;801;and a special bravo for Jack Black who played his character with great concentration and flare.
I:10;802;It's a gift especially for someone who really likes this movie and the price was reasonable too.
I:10;803;Actually it goes by pretty quick for me and that includes the extended edition.
I:10;804;This is the best of three of them althouth I do like all three of them.
I:10;805;naomi Watts Jack Black and Adrien Brody are better or at least as good as the original three.
I:10;806;I really love the extra scenes in the extended edition.
I:10;807;King Kong is my favorite movie and if I recommeded it I would recomend the original.
I:10;808;Better still I would reccomend this version of King Kong and the extented edition which is made ten times better by the three extra scenes as I said earlier.
I:10;809;And this is the best one.
I:10;810;This is the best version especially the extended edition.
I:10;811;theres an extra dinosaur scene.
I:10;812;King Kong is an excellent movie.
I:10;813;You also cant see King Kong right away.
I:10;814;This brings me back to my original point lentgh.
I:10;815;One scene I find funny is when Ann and Jack first meet and she mistakes some one else for him.
I:10;816;That is actually one of the few funny scenes as this is meant to be an action movie rather than a comedy.
I:10;817;And believable by the way.
I:10;818;He did the best job he could which was his best with the story especially the extended edition and its three extra scenes.
I:10;819;OK, before seeing this movie with a friend, I'll admit, I didn't ever have an interest with king Kong, I wen't with not knowing what to expect.
I:10;820;It has everything you'd expect in a great movie, action, romance, scary scenes, sad scenes, happy scenes, etc.
I:10;821;King Kong is another of Peter Jackson's epic movies.
I:10;822;end): meeting the characters and getting to know them in Manhattan and on the ship, Skull Island, and Kong in Manhattan.
I:10;823;Hitchcock took every one of his films (to the best of my knowledge) from a novel or story.
I:10;824;When we first see the native girl on the island, she holds her hand up with her palm facing down.
I:10;825;as well as many in his crew.
I:10;826;"This leads directly to the line ""The show must go on,"" and it does, later in the movie with the eighth wonder of the world."
I:10;827;the characters were well created.
I:10;828;That first part of the movie established the characters, the setting and the period wonderfully.
I:10;829;Denham's obsession was really a fascinating part of the story.
I:10;830;the actors (and actresses) gave outstanding performances.
I:10;831;Naomi Watts really put her heart into this movie.
I:10;832;Andy Serkis created a Kong with some heart and soul.
I:10;833;Adrien Brody, Jack Black and the other actors gave great performances as well.
I:10;834;the music was very moving and powerful.
I:10;835;I liked how they used symphonic music as well as the period, jazzy songs in the movie.
I:10;836;I'm definitely going to get a hold of the sound track for this movie.
I:10;837;Jackson really likes to use half.
I:10;838;mo shots were overdone, but most were very well done.
I:10;839;The cinematography sometimes reminded me of Lord of the Rings with its epic, wide.
I:10;840;all in all this is one of the best movies I've seen recently.
I:10;841;In my opinion Peter Jackson's King Kong is one of the best films of 2005.
I:10;842;It's about the struggle of people during the depression, adventures on and island full of dangerous creatures, and the relationship of man, and of course woman, with a misunderstood beast.
I:10;843;The second act, the longest of the three acts, that takes place on the island, is nothing short of spectacular, with no less than four amazing intense action sequences.
I:10;844;"I'm certainly glad Jackson went all out in that middle act
I:10;845;And the third act, back in New York city, is done very well with a lot of heartfelt emtion and really needed the time it uses to build to the powerful conclusion.
I:10;846;the acting is all round solid, with Naomi Watts, in the famous role Fay Wray played more than seventy years prior, giving the film's strong performance.
I:10;847;The rest of the cast, Adrian Brody and Jack black, along with supporting roles of the crew of the ship, are good enough to not slow the momentum of the reall stars.
I:10;848;i highly recomend this movie.
I:10;849;He is taking his crew to a mysterious island to make an over the top film to resurrect his career.
I:10;850;When they arrive on the island, the native people capture Ann and offer her as a sacrifice to it turns out, an enormous gorilla.
I:10;851;He has shown her a compassionate, contemplative side.
I:10;852;He has risked his life and protected her from other creatures on the island like dinosaurs.
I:10;853;peter Jackson's King Kong is a visually spectacular movie.
I:10;854;All the scenes with animals and insects on the island are very well done.
I:10;855;The movie is also written very well.
I:10;856;It moves along nicely and the pace keeps stepping.
I:10;857;All in all though, this is a wonderful movie.
I:10;858;it is like watching a computer game in parts.
I:10;859;Everyone over the age of 16 knows the story of King Kong.
I:10;860;It is an icon in pop culture, including children's cartoons.
I:10;861;This movie helps to cement the story in modern mythology by using CGI graphics and fantastic directing.
I:10;862;I loved it except for the few flaws that kept me from giving it five stars.
I:10;863;naomi Watts was wonderful, and her performance was enthralling.
I:10;864;Her link to Kong felt genuine.
I:10;865;Her vaudeville athleticism was endearing and added authenticity to her character.
I:10;866;The use of CGI and the updated cinematography has made this film a classic.
I:10;867;the movie is best in the theater, so watch it on a big TV if you can.
I:10;868;Thanks to those who do this.
I:10;869;the audio was excellent .
I:10;870;I was a young boy when the Jessica Lange/Jeff Bridges version came out and absolutely loved that movie.
I:10;871;But this new version by Peter Jackson HAS to be the ultimate King Kong.
I:10;872;This is an adventure movie that is supposed to sweep us away to unexplored fantastical lands and creatures and to stimualte our imaginations and emotions.
I:10;873;This is a larger than life story, and thus larger than life things happen!
I:10;874;The special effects are breathtaking and Kong looks absolutely real.
I:10;875;I also recommend the second disc with all those very insightful video dairies and a documentary about NY in the 1930's.
I:10;876;King Kong is wonderful and magical entertainment!
I:10;877;Adrien Brody obviously is in love with himself.
I:10;878;Seeing it in the theater was a thrill.
I:10;879;And it was genuinely moving to an old movie fan.
I:10;880;The strengths are astounding: Weta has crafted the most impressive Special FX film to date, brought to life with an incredible amount of sincerity, and Peter Jackson his proven himself to be one of the great directors of all time.
I:10;881;Amazing enough, this is one part of the '76 Kong that is somewhat interesting.
I:10;882;There is no argument that King Kong is a film with MAJOR cultural history.
I:10;883;It seemed clever the first time around.
I:10;884;the deleted scenes are also very revealing.
I:10;885;I believe it shows the influence of the cloying Frank Darabont.
I:10;886;still, I remember seeing this in the theater and being swept off my feet.
I:10;887;Maybe it's a great thing that people still make films that really have to be experienced rather than dissected.
I:10;888;In 1993 Steven Spielberg blessed us with Jurassic Park, the movie was a sight to behold the special effects of the dinosaurs were spectacular.
I:10;889;King Kong tried to hard to replicate Spielberg's success.
I:10;890;The CG in this movie was anything but spectacular.
I:10;891;Jackson tried to hard to replicate the success he had with the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
I:10;892;written movie sense Lord of the Rings.
I:10;893;Frankly it was good in those movies and that is all.
I:10;894;The original is one of the world's greatest films.
I:10;895;But from the very beginning of this movie I knew right off it was going to be really good.
I:10;896;The way he shows New York city during the 1930's was very impressive.
I:10;897;I actually liked the first 45 minutes of this movie and think Jackson does a very good job of setting the mood and build up to the first action sequence.
I:10;898;I definitely think this movie needs to be seen on the big screen to really be enjoyed properly.
I:10;899;Better catch it before it is gone.
I:10;900;officially the film won for Best Visual Effects which personally I don't understand.
I:10;901;In New York at the end it's absolutely beautiful on top of the Empire State Building but on Skull Island it's almost cringe.
I:10;902;Not to mention the sounds outside of Kong are merely ok but go figure, they won Best Sound and Sound Editing.
I:10;903;Yes they're cool and yes they're exciting but they're also incredibly silly.
I:10;904;It's as if the only way to make the film epic is to pack it with as much as you can.
I:10;905;Jack Black makes a good Denham but not an excellent one and Adrien Brody doesn't scream action hero to me.
I:10;906;The supporting cast is good though with the under.
I:10;907;Naomi Watts is the perfect Ann Darrow though, tough and very emotional.
I:10;908;In fact, it's probably rare to not find her teary eyed in the film, and quite a set of lungs.
I:10;909;After that, the movie will have you glued to the screen.
I:10;910;this movie is filled with action.
I:10;911;The use of technology is definitely an improvement from the original movie.
I:10;912;It's a question often posed when a new band covers a classic song.
I:10;913;The only real answer to the question is one that certainly applies to Peter Jackson's King Kong.
I:10;914;It's a way to honor a classic film and introduce it to a whole new generation.
I:10;915;known plot of King Kong may be a futile practice, but please indulge me.
I:10;916;Hoping for a great film and willing to do anything to make it, filmmaker Carl Denham (Black) sets sail on a small ship to Skull Island with his newly recruited actress, Ann Darrow (Watts).
I:10;917;While searching for Ann and after losing his film (along with a few of his shipmates) Denham decides he can still profit from this expedition by capturing Kong and bringing him back to New York.
I:10;918;Black's performance is drenched in melodrama in a successful attempt to reflect the 1933 film.
I:10;919;That is accredited to performance.
I:10;920;not surprisingly, the most interesting character to watch is Kong himself.
I:10;921;The anger of his face emphasizes the passion present in the fight scenes and supports the action significantly.
I:10;922;The soft, human expression he displays when looking upon Darrow underlines the admiration he feels and the love story, which may be the strongest theme of the film.
I:10;923;Our view of Kong changes throughout the film, and it's a skillful device on Jackson's part.
I:10;924;Don't be fooled, this film is a lot of fun to watch.
I:10;925;Peter Jackson was a fan of the original King Kong ever since he first saw it as a child.
I:10;926;After this new King Kong perhaps some people will check out the original, which is the greatest purpose for any remake.
I:10;927;Not all of us were around in 1933 to see the mighty Kong on the screen for the first time, and we need a reminder of what made it so magical in the first place.
I:10;928;The good thing is that I found it to be more interesting than I would have guessed.
I:10;929;Just make sure you have your popcorn and drinks.
I:10;930;This is a rich and full story.
I:10;931;This is the full story of Kong and those who encountered him . . . and it's an incredibly good one and superbly stunning in cinematography.
I:10;932;special Effects and action should support a plot .
I:10;933;action flicks can have a great story .
I:10;934;This movie is the perfect example .
I:10;935;"same ole story
I:10;936;if you like your movies computer drawn then this is for you.
I:10;937;Well, I saw 'King Kong' tonight and it was brilliant.
I:10;938;From the start the audience is kind of rushed into the roaring twenties with depictions of every stereotype one can imagine from that fascinating and influential era.
I:10;939;Shortly after this, the audience is introduced to Ann Darrow, brought to life by in an extraordinary yet subtle performance by the enchanting actress Naomi Watts.
I:10;940;Ann Darrow is throwing a Vaudevillesque show on Broadway in New York, stunning the patrons with fantastic feats of showmanship such as juggling, dancing, singing and most importantly a passion for her work.
I:10;941;She receives some comfort from a fellow thespian, an older gentleman, who appears as somewhat of a mentor and provider of moral support.
I:10;942;in the mean time the film introduces Jack Black's excellent portrayal of Carl Denham, moving pictures director.
I:10;943;His eyes are fixed and her aura captures his imagination, and he knows he has found the perfect woman for the part he has in mind for the biggest project of his life.
I:10;944;He introduces himself in a charming way that only Jack Black can pull off, and invites her to a dinner, something which she would like to but simply cannot refuse.
I:10;945;it's safe to assume at this point that everyone knows by the trailers that the special effects are truly stunning, well after watching the 3 hour movie it's even more amazing than most are led to believe by the short clips provided by the teasers.
I:10;946;King Kong himself is as believable as any of the real life cast members.
I:10;947;While the cast is magnificent, like Adrien Brody who does a convincing job as a geeky yet brave playwright/screenwriter, King Kong elicits a great deal of emotion but at the same time he commands respect with an awe.
I:10;948;The interaction between him and Ann Darrow have moments of magic and brilliance, such tenderness to melt even the most hardened of hearts, not to mention enough action and fighting to excite the most jaded of movie goers.
I:10;949;There's passion abound in this film, off and on screen.
I:10;950;Peter Jackson clearly delivered a labor of love with 'King Kong', pouring his heart and soul into it.
I:10;951;She gave a very understated yet poignant performance as Ann Darrow, the demure, unassuming, starry.
I:10;952;eyed beauty that captivated the heart of a beast.
I:10;953;Her performance was very giving, and really helped to bring to life King Kong.
I:10;954;King Kong himself is an artistic achievement the likes which have never been seen before.
I:10;955;If the special effects team doesn't win an Oscar for this film, I will be shocked.
I:10;956;All around and in between there was deep felt passion in this film.
I:10;957;It has literally something for everyone, and for those with patience this movie has plenty to offer, because at 3 hours it might be a little too long for some, but it is well worth the down time.
I:10;958;one last thing to add about the film, the irony behind the story of King Kong and humanity is worthy for food for thought.
I:10;959;King Kong is a beast, but his humanity far surpasses that of most of the people depicted in the film.
I:10;960;Ann's outer beauty is matched by her inner beauty, and that is something which resonates within Kong's gargantuan heart.
I:10;961;i was genuinely moved several times during this film, and I don't say that about very many films, not at all.
I:10;962;Without a doubt this is the best movie that I've seen this year.
I:10;963;This new KK is fun and mostly exciting.
I:10;964;But it really is too long (because everyone already knows the story) and the entire movie belongs to Naomi Watts and Kong.
I:10;965;The rest is pretty much filler.
I:10;966;My dad and I loved those films.
I:10;967;Overall, this version of Kong is not bad, and at times, quite good, and you'll leave the theater with a bit of a buzz.
I:10;968;This movie is really great.
I:10;969;Every kong fan,Kaiju fan,lord of the rings fan, science fiction fan should see.
I:10;970;PJ's truly shows his passion with this movie.
I:10;971;everything about this film is escapist adventure thrills and excitement EXCEPT.
I:10;972;the effects are brilliant, the pacing breath.
I:10;973;"up"") and the interplay between the characters (including Kong) are FULLY realized."
I:10;974;the emotion of his love for Ann is STILL obvious (and wonderfully potrayed).
I:10;975;EVEN WITH ITS FAULTS this is STILL a ROUSING cinematic adventure.
I:10;976;the Skull Island escapades are destined to rest amongst the all.
I:10;977;time great cinematic thrill sequences and Peter Jackson's love for Kong is evident from the opening scenes to the last frame of film (especially poignant are the moments shared between Kong and Ann on the cliffs at sunset).
I:10;978;Stellar performances from the lovely Naomi Watts, the talented Adrian Brody, and (with a few eyebrow.
I:10;979;I bought this for the extra features.
I:10;980;The post production calendar is an amazing insight in how a film is put together.
I:10;981;The story of King Kong is so simple that a 7.
I:10;982;minute miniepisode of The Simpsons tells as much story as Peter Jackson's 3.
I:10;983;Jackson's challenge is to bring modern filmmaking techniques to the story and to give us something we've never seen before.
I:10;984;Certainly, his recreation of 1930's NYC is impressive, and his Kong is amazing.
I:10;985;The story is made to showcase the abilities of the special effects, rather than the effects serving the needs of the story.
I:10;986;As I mentioned, Kong himself is very impressive, but nothing else in the film matches that achievement.
I:10;987;But Kong's realism serves to highlight the inadequacies of the rest of the film.
I:10;988;, the dinosaurs (that are no better than Spielberg's in Jurassic Park, now 12 years old!)
I:10;989;Oddly, the first hour (setting up the expedition) was widely derided by the critics, but is really the only part of the film worth watching.
I:10;990;certainly they are tighter and more eye.
I:10;991;The film looks and (especially) sounds great.
I:10;992;"While the original movie of ""King Kong"" will always matter, I believe this is the version that all people who enjoy this story will turn to."
I:10;993;It is so much richer that the film has its own kind of majesty.
I:10;994;This version is a metaphor for man's overestimation of himself and his abilities balanced with a story on the power of nature both as an external environment and as an inner drive.
I:10;995;His female lead has backed out and he has to find a replacement.
I:10;996;Driscoll and Darrow develop a mutual, but unstated affection and it is Driscoll who goes back to rescue her from Kong and the jungle.
I:10;997;the third portion has Kong completely out of his environment and chained for the amusement of chuckleheads, well.
I:10;998;After Kong and Darrow find each other there are some touching scenes of mutual affection that culminate in the classic scene atop the Empire State Building .
I:10;999;the movie is a visual feast and tells this story with sincerity and conviction.
I:10;1000;It offers up the substance the story has rather than sensationalizing it and I think that is a real treat.
I:10;1001;I enjoyed it very much and recommend it to you.
I:10;1002;First of all I want to say is that King Kong is visually stunning through out the whole movie, from the 1920s New York to Skull Island and to the monsters on the island and especially Kong who looks stunning on the screen.
I:10;1003;and ultimately the audience's delight).
I:10;1004;It is their shared moments of joy that solidify an unusual bond of friendship between Ann and Kong.
I:10;1005;the cast was superb, with Jack Black (probably his only serious role ever) as Carl, Adrien Brody and the beautiful Nioami Watts, followed by an excellent supporting cast which delivered by making the movie believable.
I:10;1006;king Kong in my opinion is one the most beautiful movies ever made, where Jackson takes you to another world and puts you on a sometimes frightning adventure that is also heart warming at the same time.
I:10;1007;This shows just how great Peter Jackson is at being a director.
I:10;1008;Everything else has already been said so i'm just gonna say that Peter Jackson is truly one of the greatest Director's of all time and this film is a Masterpiece!
I:10;1009;He captures the moral message in how the human race will take mother natures beauty and selfishly detroy it.
I:10;1010;To me Kong is a metaphor for the planet earth!
I:10;1011;with funny scenes,Carol denham asking ann her size,ann makeing kong laugh.
I:10;1012;Almost as good as the theater.
I:10;1013;I on the other hand enjoyed the movie because of Jack Black and comparing it the original one with Faye Ray.
I:10;1014;so great comments made about this film, and I noticed the box office, while very healthy, wasn't quite up to industry predictions.
I:10;1015;era New York is vividly re.
I:10;1016;Kong himself, the main lead, is astounding.
I:10;1017;Credit goes again to the magicians at Weta Digital.
I:10;1018;I felt the pace moved quite well, tho somewhat sluggishly at first.
I:10;1019;The scenes I found to be truly perfect were the scenes involving Ann Darrow and Kong alone.
I:10;1020;The sequence in the park in New York, on the frozen lake, was wonderful.
I:10;1021;The casting was superb for the part of Ann Darrow.
I:10;1022;Naomi Watts does on amazing job here, conveying so much through her eyes and motions.
I:10;1023;Jack Black was an interesting choice, and he does a creditable job.
I:10;1024;I know it was his favorite movie as a child, and his real stimulus to be a film.
I:10;1025;imagined Kong in a new, fresh way, and breathed life back into the old story.
I:10;1026;What an experience this film is.
I:10;1027;Let's be clear about this epic retelling of 'beauty and the beast'.
I:10;1028;If you didn't care for the original 1933 horror classic, King Kong, it is doubtful you will warm to this mega version.
I:10;1029;That being said, this update is a marvelous, big production that entertains and excites without sacrificing any of its emotional substance.
I:10;1030;As escapist fare with heart, the new King Kong has blockbuster written all over it, and in this case that's a good thing, a very good thing indeed.
I:10;1031;There are thrills, spectacle, humor, and a sense of heroic adventure, which are rare even in the post.
I:10;1032;That Jackson takes his time in quieter moments to develop his characters and never stumbles when the action starts is truly amazing.
I:10;1033;Just when you think our heroes are safe, a new danger pops up to keep you at the edge of your seat.
I:10;1034;He is a master showman of creative, funhouse perils, and when he does things, bigger is better.
I:10;1035;imagines legendary sequences from the original and takes them to new heights.
I:10;1036;Kong's rampage on Broadway reminds you of the Piccadilly Circus sequence in An American Werewolf in London.
I:10;1037;It is a moment of truth that Jackson films with an eerie beauty.
I:10;1038;You just know Jackson is a romantic as he sets up his dawn raid at the Empire State Building and gives his biggest star a great sendoff that compares favorably to the original.
I:10;1039;generated effects are phenomenal as the broadest of emotions and the tiniest of mannerisms and facial nuances (like blinking his eyes) are eloquently captured.
I:10;1040;technically the film is a marvel, and the art direction and special effects meld seamlessly together so that it is impossible to tell one from the other.
I:10;1041;The stunning visuals and fluid camera work are like eye candy, and many scenes are shot with a fresh perspective or point of view.
I:10;1042;Some of the action scenes are almost too much overkill, but Jackson gets away with it because his other scenes are so impressive.
I:10;1043;at three hours running time, it moves fairly well.
I:10;1044;It takes an hour to get to Kong, but when he does appear, the film becomes one big, nonstop chase.
I:10;1045;There are brief lulls, but credit Jackson with not rushing to an action scene and instead savoring the quiet moments that establish the most important relationship in the story.
I:10;1046;What's satisfying in the relationship between Kong and Ann is that it is one of companionship and love without the overt sexuality of the original.
I:10;1047;If you thought Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's insects were creepy, watch out!Jackson wows his audiences with his talent for managing enormous spectacles and imbuing them with humanity.
I:10;1048;This film verifies his prowess as one of the most gifted directors of his generation.
I:10;1049;Audiences looking for adventure of the highest order will find a lot to enjoy here.
I:10;1050;King Kong is Peter Jackson's epic, mega.
I:10;1051;budget, fanboy love letter to the film that inspired him to become a movie director in the first place.
I:10;1052;Clocking in at double the running time of the original, Jackson's film is an ambitious juggernaut of a movie that, like his The Lord of the Rings films, is epic in scale and scope and yet still has that personal touch.
I:10;1053;depth look at the making of this epic feature.
I:10;1054;In a nice touch, Jackson makes it a point not to talk about any material covered in the various documentaries or in the production diaries.
I:10;1055;This is a solid, chatty track packed with loads of information and told in an engaging way that really conveys how much of a labour of love it was for Jackson.
I:10;1056;The Eighth Blunder of the World is an 18 minute blooper reel of the cast goofing around on the set and flubbing their lines (especially potty mouth Jack Black).
I:10;1057;A Night in Vaudeville features uncut footage that they shot of the vaudeville performances including audition footage and archival film that they used as a basis.
I:10;1058;King Kong Homage juxtaposes scenes and lines from the original with their verbatim recreation in Jackson's film.
I:10;1059;This extra allows you to see scenes as they were originally conceived via computer animation.
I:10;1060;It started off as a simple idea, a funny goof but, as Andy Serkis explains, it got more elaborate with an actual storyline as Jackson's present exchanges many hands on its way to him.
I:10;1061;Weta Collectibles takes us on a brief tour of the elaborate sculptures for the creatures that inhabit Skull Island and how some of them have since been transformed into finely crafted collectibles for fans.
I:10;1062;"depth look at the film entitled ""Recreating the Eighth Wonder, the Making of King Kong,"" an eight."
I:10;1063;One highlight is Jackson and Naomi Watts' meeting with Fay Wray, which was an extremely emotional day for the director.
I:10;1064;It's interesting to see how close the film resembles a lot of the art, especially the Venture, Skull Island and New York City.
I:10;1065;Lord of the Rings was truly exceptional.
I:10;1066;This film is a parody at best.
I:10;1067;I admit to being a Kong fanatic and I love anything to do with the big hairy ape, so I just had to go and see Peter Jackson's version.
I:10;1068;It was such an emotional experience I was in tears by the end of it.
I:10;1069;It was just so well constructed and realized so perfectly you can't help but get swept away in the grand spectacle.
I:10;1070;It's rare you get a big blockbuster that takes time to develop its characters and focuses on the background as well as on the action scenes too.
I:10;1071;This film does it wonderfully, and though the pace may lag at times and one or two of the dinosaurs look a little funky, it's Kong and Ann's relationship that makes it so good to watch.
I:10;1072;king Kong is realized perhaps in the best way this time round, as a proper animal that you can actually believe in.
I:10;1073;Peter Jackson has taken the wonder and magic of that first movie and just supercharged it, creating something incredible.
I:10;1074;seriously though, if you're looking for a real epic experience, a movie that is above the rest, Kong is still the king.
I:10;1075;Nothing will ever match the wonder I experienced watching the original but this is a very good movie.
I:10;1076;Great effects, huge action and a strong take on the Beauty and the Beast story.
I:10;1077;Naomi Watts is lovely and Kong seems alive.
I:10;1078;I enjoyed the movie particularly the parts with Naomi Watts Dancing for Kong.
I:10;1079;extra scenes include :* King Kong's capture at Skull Island and journey to New York.
I:10;1080;production Part 1: The Return of KongPre.
I:10;1081;** Also available in a limited edition giftset, complete with a beautifully crafted WETA King Kong figurine, which is released on the same day.
I:10;1082;It was the most fun I've had in the theater in a LONG time.
I:10;1083;it was funny, emotional, dramatic, creepy and moving all at the same time.
I:10;1084;Watts was great as Ann, Brody was decent, Black was great and KONG WAS FREAKING AMAZING.
I:10;1085;he was the best actor in the bunch.
I:10;1086;It did the origional MUCH DESERVED JUSTICE and stands alone as one of the best epics to grace the screen in a long time.
I:10;1087;CGI was amazing, script was tight and the directing was brilliant.
I:10;1088;As the story unfolds you get lots and lots of edge of your seat scenes, with lots of tension and gripping action.
I:10;1089;peter Jackson and crew has created a lush and beautiful world, be it Skull Island or 1930's New York.
I:10;1090;It's a world you can immerse yourself in and enjoy as the tragic tale of Kong is told.
I:10;1091;the cast also did an outstanding job, which I didn't think the first time I saw this.
I:10;1092;After seeing it again, I've changed my mind and think the cast played out their parts perfectly.
I:10;1093;When the movie King Kong first starts off, I found myself mesmerized by sets, intrigued with the dialogue, and wondering if the casting and directing could keep up such great momentum.
I:10;1094;Her performance throughout the entire film is truly amazing and worth praise.
I:10;1095;jack Black is also brilliant in the first half of this film, too.
I:10;1096;the second half of this film, starting with the dinosaurs are scared and running scene and ending with the most boring finish to a thriller (yeah, sure, it's suppose to be a love story .
I:10;1097;peter Jackson directed the most incredible trilogy ever .
I:10;1098;The Lord of the Rings.
I:10;1099;i am in awe of what we have here, an epic tribute to that sub.
I:10;1100;the world of kong is extremely well planned, and the brontosaur stampade is everything i ever wanted to see .
I:10;1101;so, please opt for more rather than less in this film which is a dream come true for me as well as meny others, i hope.
I:10;1102;I've never seen the classic of King Kong, so I didn't know what to expect.
I:10;1103;It seemed interesting with everybody saying this movie is very good and long.
I:10;1104;Well I love those type of movies, especially long ones, so I decided to watch this one.
I:10;1105;this movie has a very good story to it and the cast is just perfect.
I:10;1106;Naomi Watts does a wonderful job in her part, along with the other characters.
I:10;1107;The special effects were awesome and they did a wonderful job in making the movie seem so realistic.
I:10;1108;This is where King Kong lives, and lives a lonely life.
I:10;1109;Throughout the movie you'll get to know who King Kong is all about and you'll most likely feel sorry for him at the end of the movie.
I:10;1110;overall, I find this movie very good.
I:10;1111;Even though this movie is longer than it should be, it still remains true to the 1933 classic and is very well made.
I:10;1112;and then cut to the next scene, where the big gorilla and his lovely human damsel.
I:10;1113;The production design and special effects are mostly brilliant, and Kong's final scaling of, and fall from, the Empire State Building is very satisfying (with exception to the completely implausible choreography of the human characters throughout the sequence).
I:10;1114;The incredibly gifted Adrien Brody, so extraordinarily compelling and heartbreaking in Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist', brings an understated charm to his underwritten and underdeveloped Depression.
I:10;1115;"theatre.101 Cliff Notes
I:10;1116;I sincerely hope in the coming years of his career that Jackson does not become a prisoner of his own multi.
I:10;1117;His earlier masterpiece, 'Heavenly Creatures' (1994), one of the very finest movies of the last 20 years, was made for around 1/100th of the budget of 'King Kong,' and has 1,000 times more genuinely human emotional impact, not to mention truly audience.
I:10;1118;I'd love to have been a fly on the wall when they did focus groups before making this movie.
I:10;1119;this is a teachable moment.
I:10;1120;that nature in its pristine wild state is, by design, an extremely dangerous place.
I:10;1121;But back in the real world most cave systems are occupied by some of the most unusually fragile endangered species on earth!
I:10;1122;I had the good sense to walk out at the two hour mark.
I:10;1123;Oh and did I mention that Kong was way to small.
I:10;1124;I think this is a remarkable film.
I:10;1125;Perhaps it could use a a bit of triming but it's all there and a wonderful re.
I:10;1126;It stars a funny comedian, Jack Black, who bugs out his eyes and makes funny faces.
I:10;1127;The Hero is a skinny funny looking guy too.
I:10;1128;The film is full of funny moments too, Like when you expect Kong to see Ann on stage and its someone else!!!
I:10;1129;cheek comedy ,like the moment when Kong is going wild in the street and stops when he sees Ann standing there with the lights around her, and its real corney and we all groan.
I:10;1130;Kong and the dinosaurs and the whole movie look like one big cartoon.
I:10;1131;And the plot is a reverse of the original.
I:10;1132;"spectacular ""King Kong"" goes the distance in answering the age."
I:10;1133;ton Gorilla sit?Answer: anywhere he damn well pleases.
I:10;1134;Kong is intermittently fun, occasionally astounding, and often spectacular, provided you check your cynicism at the door.
I:10;1135;new Zealand's giant monkey is an astonishing master.
I:10;1136;work, a coup of theatrical art for the ages: he has a helluva lot more charisma, pathos, and screen presence than rival Jack Driscoll (the ugly Adrien Brody, playing the world's most godawful playwright).
I:10;1137;and let's cut to the guts of the deal: the duel at the top of the World took my breath away, and, frankly, there's nothing as delicious, and ghoulish (though Jackson could have added a little more splatter!)
I:10;1138;particularly in the unloved 1976 version, which is superior in dignity and terror to this outing.
I:10;1139;kong has always struck me as a fascinating figure: a loner, a kind of outcast.
I:10;1140;in the end, Jackson succeeds because he gets his arms around the central truth of the Kong legend: the King of Skull Island is lonely, just like the rest of us.
I:10;1141;"Jackson has given ""King Kong"" the epic treatment the classic story deserves."
I:10;1142;The film is a labor of love dedicated to all those pre.
I:10;1143;teenage boys who grew up watching the original 1933 classic on the million dollar movie on Thanksgiving day and wanting to become filmmakers.
I:10;1144;How else could Peter Jackson do it without making it big, bold and beautiful?
I:10;1145;"I thought it was great!Nothing will surpass the originality and imagery of the original film, as well as Fay Wray and her screams, but Jackson has made a ""Kong"" which pays homage to the original and is a great film in its own right."
I:10;1146;Finally, I saw King Kong after hearing so much about it and it was good.
I:10;1147;It wasn't great, like Lord of the Rings obviously, but it definitely kept my attention throughout the 3 plus hours.
I:10;1148;The special effects were magnificent, especially in the scenes where the dinosaurs were tripping all over each other and the scenes with the locals of Skull Island.
I:10;1149;I thought Kong looked great and there was great emotion surrounding him.
I:10;1150;I thought Jack Black was perfect as a mixture of sleeze and charm, and played the part very well.
I:10;1151;Naomi Watts, who has never looked prettier also did a great job with her connect with Kong.
I:10;1152;Lastly, Adrien Brody, who is great in every movie I have seen with him, does the best job in this movie.
I:10;1153;"The arrival of ""King Kong"", one of the years most anticipated films, gives movie goers a big box office spectacle just in time for the holidays."
I:10;1154;A lot of overwhelming expectations ride on this film and its director, especially since it is a remake of a beloved classic that most everyone has seen.
I:10;1155;is Peter Jackson successful in remaking this movie?
I:10;1156;although there are some problems with the film, I think overall Jackson did a nice job of bringing this story to the big screen.
I:10;1157;Naomi Watts is perfect as the lovely Ann Darrow, the beauty who steals the heart of the beast.
I:10;1158;Jack Black, the film director Carl Denim, adds humor to the story and Adrien Brody provides the human love interest for Ann Darrow.
I:10;1159;But the true star of the movie is, of course, Kong.
I:10;1160;And Jackson succeeded at humanizing the big ape, making the viewer realize that Kong has been taken out of his element.
I:10;1161;Probably for me, the best moments in the film are the moments that Kong spends alone with Ann Darrow.
I:10;1162;From the time that she dances for him and he sees her as a small, moving toy to the final scenes where she sees him in the street and the inevitable climb of the Empire State Building.
I:10;1163;The scenes are tender and, for me, are really the best moments in Jackson's remake.
I:10;1164;I especially liked the scene where Kong with Darrow, discovers snow in the park.
I:10;1165;From T. rexes, huge long necks dinosaurs, giant insects and evil natives, the adventurors face a gamit of challenges, including Kong himself.
I:10;1166;The special effects are good and keep the action flowing.
I:10;1167;Its a great popcorn flick and definitely should be see on the big screen.
I:10;1168;Some of the scenes will be too intense for small children but my 8 year old niece and nephew enjoyed the film (the last two hours).
I:10;1169;mainly just to be with the family.
I:10;1170;the effects are exceptionally realistic.
I:10;1171;And some of the actors were excellent.
I:10;1172;the plot was predictable, and we all know how the story goes.yet it was still fantastic to watch.
I:10;1173;Peter Jackson did a great job on this movie.
I:10;1174;There is also a lot of profanity in the beginning of the movie.
I:10;1175;It's just a great movie overall and gets a great movie vote from me.
I:10;1176;So get a copy and have a great time.
I:10;1177;One of the most memorable scenes in any movie by anyone ever appears in this re.
I:10;1178;They are still in the jungle and Kong is going home, with Anne, finally understanding the ape's intelligence and love, following him.
I:10;1179;And clearly more admirable than any of the representatives of the other primate species in the film.
I:10;1180;peter Jackson's KING KONG is a gutsy movie.
I:10;1181;This works so well I could go on for pages about how good it is.
I:10;1182;Movie 1 is a silly 30's romantic comedy, movie 2 is an intense horror film and movie 3 is a monster run amok in New York City.
I:10;1183;Apart they wouldn't work, but together Jackson has weaved a narrative that is better than the one conceived 70 years ago.
I:10;1184;KING KONG is the richest popcorn movie I have ever seen.
I:10;1185;You cringe, you jump and most importantly you have a great time.
I:10;1186;One moment you laugh, the next you jump out of your seat, and then the next moment you laugh.
I:10;1187;Only a film with heart can do that.
I:10;1188;Jackson ups the ante by crafting a Kong that is almost human.
I:10;1189;He honestly loves Ann, and Ann is not just a screaming damsel.
I:10;1190;She has a heart and a soul.
I:10;1191;Watts fills Darrow with with such nuance and humanity.
I:10;1192;But Watts is just phenomenal and takes this b. movie premise into blockbuster territory.
I:10;1193;kudos also go to Jack Black, Adrain Brody, and the rest of the cast who embody these characters with so much life.
I:10;1194;But because the actors and Jackson placed character above action, when these characters are in peril you actually feel for them.
I:10;1195;Thus their peril is kicked up a notch, and the audience has a lot of fun.
I:10;1196;not since Indiana Jones has an adventure movie been so much fun to watch.
I:10;1197;A film that is so vibrant, so full of pure unadulterated joy and so much real imagination.
I:10;1198;KING KONG is easily the best film I've seen in the last five or six years.
I:10;1199;i think I figured out Jackson secret to making such successful films.
I:10;1200;His production team is a well oiled machine.
I:10;1201;Jackson, his wife Fran Walsh, and Phillipa Boyens have been working together since the mid 90's with editor Jamie Selkirk who has been with Jackson since the beginning.
I:10;1202;They know how to read each other and together they have crafted great film after great film.
I:10;1203;kING KONG is a marvellous screen outing.
I:10;1204;See on the big screen because it will lose something on even the biggest TV Screen.
I:10;1205;Just go see this movie.
I:10;1206;But on seeing the film I think he has not only made a better King Kong but made one of the best films ever in its ability to tell a great story.
I:10;1207;my reason for thinking this is how completely Mr. Jackson tells the story: there are no wasted minutes and each character is fully developed.
I:10;1208;Most of all, Kong comes fully to life as a character with as complex a life as any of the other characters.
I:10;1209;The film also beautifully re.
I:10;1210;Peter Jackson also improves on the drama with the ship smashing into the rocks at Skull Island and the frightening natives that appear from nowhere.
I:10;1211;The action sequences are well planned and are breathtaking to watch.
I:10;1212;The giant creatures on the island are truly frightening and the stampede of the brontosaurus.
I:10;1213;like animals is especially well done.
I:10;1214;The relationship between Anne Darrow and Kong is build very well with her fear turning gradually into gratitude and, certainly, a love for this marvelous creature.
I:10;1215;the casting of this film was perfect.
I:10;1216;"Jack Black makes an outstanding Carl Denham
I:10;1217;This latter belief, that wild creatures would be destroyed by their association with civilization, was something that Kong creator Merrian C. Cooper believed.
I:10;1218;Naomi Watts is a wonderful Anne Darrow and Andre Brody makes a resourceful Jack Driscoll, and Thomas Kretschmann (better known from The Pianist) makes a perfect captain of the Venture.
I:10;1219;But it is Kong who is given a new life in this film and becomes the intelligent creature that a true gorilla is and for whom we have sympathy.
I:10;1220;If one does not find the ending of the film heartbreaking then you have a heart of stone.
I:10;1221;How can you debate a remake by Peter Jackson, arguably the finest craftsman working behind the camera today.
I:10;1222;"Jackson, cognizant of the revered status that the original ""King Kong"" holds, has fashioned a homage to the original film that not only lovingly pays tribute to it but may even surpass it in the process."
I:10;1223;"Recently I viewed the original ""Kong"" after not having seen it for a number of years."
I:10;1224;It was most certainly durable and entertaining and I marveled at the groundbreaking effects work for it's day.
I:10;1225;"To my mind, Jackson's ""Kong"" contains breathtaking effects work as well as better narrative and character development than the original."
I:10;1226;"Consider us fortunate that ""Kong"" inspired two truly great films."
I:10;1227;Peter Jackson is certainly on a roll.
I:10;1228;New York is a stylistic marvel, a montage of popular Depression.
I:10;1229;era impressions with its vintage cars, clothes, and art deco architecture, not to mention the bread lines, elevated trains, and streets bustling with desperate people.
I:10;1230;"And Kong is a brilliantly realized CGI creation, even more emotive and realistic than Gollum of ""Lord of the Rings,"" who was also ""performed"" by Andy Serkis."
I:10;1231;The character development is deft and efficient.
I:10;1232;Jackson and his production team are at the top of their game.
I:10;1233;The cast (most notably Naomi Watts, Adrien Brody, and Jack Black) is terrific.
I:10;1234;ray King Kong will be one of the bell weather Disc's.
I:10;1235;I just recieved and viewed it truly amazing Video and Audio is good as it gets and @ 19.99 with shipping.
I:10;1236;Yah you can say the special effects are good, and they are.
I:10;1237;I love this movie because of the effects and heart touching moments.
I:10;1238;The show didnt hold his attention until Kong actually came into the picture.
I:10;1239;The movie on an adult level was good.
I:10;1240;There were some boring parts as with any movie but the special FX and scenes were well made and awesome.
I:10;1241;I would recommend this movie to any Kong fan.
I:10;1242;"I thought, ""Great, some high definition artwork to enjoy!"""
I:10;1243;I am a big fan of the original King Kong, and maybe that's the problem.
I:10;1244;"But rest assured, once the monkey shows up, ""It's Showtime, Folks!"""
I:10;1245;I was riveted on him from the first moment he shows himself, until the bitter end.
I:10;1246;You also won't find any radical twists in the same old story line followed by its predecessors, but again, Kong is such a visual treat, you won't mind.
I:10;1247;so sit back and enjoy!
I:10;1248;Im not going to go around and tell you how wonderful this movie is because at this point in time their are 618 other people that have done that so Im going to keep it short and sweet, I have seen the King Kong from both the 30's and the 70's and from this idea and screenplay it could not have been anybetter Peter Jackson did what any great director making a re.
I:10;1249;disked one, its got some great commentary and lots of others things that the others just dont have, not to mention its only a few dollars more.
I:10;1250;Kong Rules, Peter Jackson has created something that is priceless.
I:10;1251;the action was non stop, besides that Kong was so lifelike, that he won me over.
I:10;1252;There is nothing like a film full of life and real emotion.
I:10;1253;The Best film I've saw in since LOTR and Crash.
I:10;1254;"It was interesting, better than I thought it would be
I:10;1255;"This newest version of ""King Kong"" takes the old story, with a few twists, and polishes it with superb special effects that create the most human, the most believable, King Kong to date."
I:10;1256;naomi Watts is radiant and adept in the otherwise thin role of a woman at the mercy of forces beyond her control.
I:10;1257;She and Brody have remarkable on.
I:10;1258;screen chemistry, but she shines most in her Kong scenes, where she charms the enormous beast with her spontaneous antics and, later, her compassion.
I:10;1259;Despite her performance, the real star of this film is digitally created Kong, a creation so realistic and nuanced that one can forget that he is not a real, breathing gigantic gorilla.
I:10;1260;His transformation from terrifying brute to an animal who can both be amused by a cartwheel and sit contemplatively before a sunset is one of this film's greatest triumphs.
I:10;1261;"Despite the technical and artistic elements, ""King Kong"" falters because of the story itself, a tale that has always been subservient to special effects."
I:10;1262;for the sheer exhilaration of Kong's creation and the cinematography, this movie is worth watching .
I:10;1263;I found this on Amazon and they're back into it again.
I:10;1264;Thanks Amazon for great finds and prices
I:10;1265;If you are a King Kong Fan, you will love this newer version.
I:10;1266;ray image is fine, and the disc does include both the theatrical and extended version of the film.
I:10;1267;ray is also worth it.
I:10;1268;Naturally, the extra background and production content made this thing a real steal, but I have yet to see any of that in favor of watching the near.3.
I:10;1269;Dig those modern special effects!
I:10;1270;say, maybe that's why the first 'Kong was so much more frightening and impressive: All that jerky, deliberate motion made a far more spooky impact than blur.
I:10;1271;But, if that's true, how come Godzilla.
I:10;1272;First, the excellent direction by Peter Jackson and the script and also the stars Naomi Watts and Jack Black.
I:10;1273;Also Watts has never been more sympathetic than in this film and Jack Black is a comic delight as the con man/director Denham.
I:10;1274;Recommended for all Kong enthusiasts and lovers of fantasy!!
I:10;1275;what you get is an fx chariter that is so full of life and soul that you abbandon all thought of FX and relax to the story.
I:10;1276;But she fattens the part up and gives her a pulse.
I:10;1277;But a very Great film none the less.
I:10;1278;In 1933, King Kong rocked the cinema with its captivating story and great special effects(for the time.)
I:10;1279;Now, in 2005, director Peter Jackson, the man who brought you the epic Lord of the Rings films, breathes life back into our favorite ape!THE PLOT: If you've seen the original, you already know the story.
I:10;1280;a film crew consisting of Carl Denham, the director, Ann Darrow, the beautiful actress, Jack Driscoll, who is the storywriter, and many others.
I:10;1281;What they find there is crazy natives, reptillian beasts, and a giant ape known as Kong!SFX: The CGI is amazing.
I:10;1282;The fur, scars, and expressions on Kong are really detailed.
I:10;1283;My favorite part is when Kong has to fight all those dinosaurs.
I:10;1284;eMOTION: Very emotional at the end.
I:10;1285;I shedded a tear at some scenes.
I:10;1286;Naomi Watts was perfect for the role.
I:10;1287;I reccomend for people ages 12 and up to see it.
I:10;1288;oVERALL: Even better than the original.
I:10;1289;One of my favorite movies of the year.
I:10;1290;I liked the other king kong movies but this one is on a level all its own.
I:10;1291;This is by far one of the greatest movies ever made, and this time the story and kong himself were caught on film in a way that I can only sit and marvel at.
I:10;1292;If anyone is considering going to see this I recommed that you quit considering and go it will be well worth it.
I:10;1293;We have enjoyed watching this movie for many years.
I:10;1294;I was completely blown away by his take on the popular classic saga and gives the movie a whole new look.
I:10;1295;Amidst the turmoil an ambitious filmmaker Carl Denham strives to make it rich by producing a motion picture broadway show.
I:10;1296;This is the best version of King Kong I have seen.
I:10;1297;The upgrade in advanced photography is excellent.
I:10;1298;Video and audio are spot.
I:10;1299;Audio is excellent, you can almost make out Kong's growling coming out of the back of his throat, and the sound of the airplanes zooming around the Empire State Building gave my surround a good workout.
I:10;1300;I heartily recommend this movie to everyone!
I:10;1301;A lot of interesting things that REALLY added to the version we have all seen.
I:10;1302;This version of King Kong was wonderful, especially the part where she dances for him, she played the part so well.
I:10;1303;Special effects fantastic along with a really good story line!
I:10;1304;My gosh, can Peter Jackson make a movie.
I:10;1305;The creator of the epic, magnificentLord of the Rings Trilogy, easily the most ambitious endeavor in cinematic history, Jackson knows something about letting visuals tell a story.
I:10;1306;"And in this respect his remake of KING KONG doesn't disappoint
I:10;1307;an enticing visual thriller packed with enough special effects/CGI to keep you in your seat (for almost four hours, which is saying something).
I:10;1308;"no need to rehash the plot
I:10;1309;"I will say Naomi Watts looks right at home resting in Kong's paw, yet the ""love story"" in this respect definitely tweaked the ""ick"" factor."
I:10;1310;Peter Jackson's got the chops to make a great cinematic product, and KING KONG squarely fits the bill.
I:10;1311;King Kong is argueably the most well done CGI character ever.
I:10;1312;1930's New York city is recreated beautifully.
I:10;1313;The acting in this movie is excellent, especially Naomi Watts' performance which is mainly reacting to blue screens and a human stand.
I:10;1314;Andy Serkis also deserves recognition for his portrayal of Kong.
I:10;1315;The love story between beauty and the beast is done extremely well, this aspect alone is far superior to any other version of this movie.
I:10;1316;The story is faithful to the original while not coming off as a copy of it.
I:10;1317;I was on the edge of my seat, I was captivated, and I was even touched by the awesome spectacle that is King Kong.
I:10;1318;Kudos to Peter Jackson, the man is an artist.
I:10;1319;I wanted King Kong to be a great movie.
I:10;1320;It's O. k. to accept a wild premise like a 25.
I:10;1321;"foot tall gorilla
I:10;1322;It was absolutely positively IMPOSSIBLE to load King Kong on that ship!
I:10;1323;Peter Jackson did a great job bringing Kong to life in this version, The blu.
I:10;1324;it just didnt look realistic and those few scenes should have been left out: But over all this a well made and fun adventure movie.
I:10;1325;i think it's great that it was long.
I:10;1326;This monumental undertaking was to update this film to today's standards and viewing habits.
I:10;1327;"The one director pegged for this undertaking was the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy director Peter Jackson."
I:10;1328;This three time Academy Award (LOTR) winner was also a big fan of the original.
I:10;1329;the special effects make this film come alive with real life feel for that 1930's era.
I:10;1330;Kong's movement and expressions truly characterized Peter Jackson's attention to detail.
I:10;1331;And I was unexpectedly surprised by the Skull island inhabitants.
I:10;1332;All I can say is that they are very scary.
I:10;1333;"i truly enjoyed this version of ""King Kong."""
I:10;1334;Peter Jackson has honed his film making skills.
I:10;1335;And is becoming a must see for any film that he touches.
I:10;1336;I recommend purchasing the two disc widescreen version.
I:10;1337;I am now a big fan of Peter Jackson.
I:10;1338;The Picture is astonishing, and audio is dynamic and clear.
I:10;1339;I was one of the lucky winners of the Kong is King.
I:10;1340;The movie only got better from there, carrying us moviegoers on a roller.
I:10;1341;coaster ride of adventure, romance, and eye.
I:10;1342;What raises Jackson's take on KING KONG above other rock'em.

I:10;1346;"the characters are no mere genre archetypes
I:10;1347;When Ann and playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody combines strength and sensitivity wonderfully as this unlikely hero.
I:10;1348;He gets my vote for Movie Mensch of the Year!)
I:10;1349;connect on screen, we're moved and rooting for them to get together, especially after they share one of this year's best screen kisses.
I:10;1350;Even the calculating Denham wins us over with his sheer force of will.
I:10;1351;A real Orson Welles type, the guy just loves making movies .
I:10;1352;most importantly, King Kong himself captivates us, thanks to a combination of WETA's amazing special effects and the range of emotion provided by a motion.
I:10;1353;If only one cast member gets an Oscar nomination, I say give it to Serkis for his wonderful performances as both Kong and Lumpy the cook!
I:10;1354;As a result, we can see how Kong's terrifying side is influenced by his tender side.
I:10;1355;"Moreover, Andrew Lesnie's cinematography is as gorgeous as it is kinetic
I:10;1356;She just happens to be a size 4.
I:10;1357;Somehow the mismatched cast of the film and crew pull it together and they set sail on the high seas.
I:10;1358;The special effects in King Kong are awesome and the art direction is equally impressive.
I:10;1359;I have all three of the major Kong movies and find this one is actually pretty darn good.
I:10;1360;Jack Black is always fun to watch and the story, although a little draggy in some places really does capture the essence of old New York in many ways.
I:10;1361;I thought it seemed to be a bit more realistic for that in view of the other Kong films.
I:10;1362;The extras included are really interesting, including the extra scenes.
I:10;1363;The fact that my eleven year old son really enjoyed this and watched it non stop illustrates the drawing power of the movie.
I:10;1364;A worthy addition to the Kong catalog.
I:10;1365;This movie was made to appeal to those with an intelligence level in the mid thirties.
I:10;1366;The original was one of the greatest films ever made.

I:10;1370;"day viewers an experience that we ""back in the day"" could only have dreamed of."
I:10;1371;Peter Jackson is a wonderful director who knows how to combine loads of special effects, great acting/emotion and cinematography into a single film.
I:10;1372;King Kong is a fine epic and will look amazing in Hi.
I:10;1373;Ther CGI and live action come together really well.
I:10;1374;good sound, good image, and good stars.
I:10;1375;It is the poignant connection between the beauty and the beast.
I:10;1376;This is captured better than in any of the other renditions of the story.
I:10;1377;But Peter Jackson is determined to overwhelm us with technology and special effects wizardry.
I:10;1378;The technology is the biggest monster in the movie.
I:10;1379;But the interplay between the beauty and the beast had me hooked, and this made the film surprisingly less anticlimactic.
I:10;1380;jack Black does a good job playing the smarmy, sneaky, capitalizing film director.
I:10;1381;And Naomi Watts is stunning as Anne Darrow.
I:10;1382;Director Peter Jackson did a remarkable job in re.
I:10;1383;extinct creatures endured, becoming suspended in time?Naomi Watts proves herself to be worthy of following in the footsteps of Fay Wray and Jessica Lange (I won't mention the farcical KING KONG LIVES starring Linda Hamilton).
I:10;1384;The Australian beauty is a great actress who also easily passes for an acrobat.
I:10;1385;While everyone already knows the story (whether they've seen the 1930s original or not), it's still worth watching all over again .
I:10;1386;Peter Jackson's King Kong is a beautifully rendered version of the original movie.
I:10;1387;The special efects are fantastic, and the relationship between Kong and Naomi Watts is truly touching.Yes, it is much too slow at the start.
I:10;1388;but once you get to the island with Kong, the movie is a visual delight.
I:10;1389;when Kong comes back to New York and escapes from the theater, there is a beautiful scene of him and Naomi Watts ice skating.
I:10;1390;It's very lovely and adds a whole new dimension to their relationship.
I:10;1391;Twas beauty that killed the beast.
I:10;1392;King Kong is an amazing epic adventure that's not just one of the year's best remakes, but one of the year's best films.
I:10;1393;Director Peter Jackson has created one of the most intense and exciting adventure films I've ever seen.
I:10;1394;Everything about King Kong is first rate, from the cast, to the music, the production design and costumes to the amazing special effects.
I:10;1395;The film follows fairly closely to the 1933 original, but Jackson certainly adds his own personal touches here and there.
I:10;1396;He's able to dazzle us with the gorgeous visuals, but also keep us emotionally interested in the story and characters.
I:10;1397;Peter Jackson really is the kind of filmmaker that George Lucas wishes he was, that's right I said it.
I:10;1398;"Because you can clearly tell that Jackson's passionate love and respect for the material is what drives him to make a great film
I:10;1399;king Kong starts off in New York City during the Great Depression.
I:10;1400;That's when she meets Carl Denham, played by Jack Black, a dedicated and persistently ambitious filmmaker in search of a hit.
I:10;1401;They set foot on the island and are attacked by a hoard of creepy natives, and Ann is captured and served as a sacrifice to Kong.
I:10;1402;From this point onward the entire film is one massive and intense spectacle after another.
I:10;1403;"The rest of the story is pretty much the classic tale that everybody knows
I:10;1404;"king Kong impressed me on such a high level for virtually the entire film
I:10;1405;King Kong in my book deserved to get a few more Oscar nominations than what it got, because the direction was amazing, the writing was great, the music was thrilling, but also Naomi Watts' performance was really something as well.
I:10;1406;King Kong is another dazzling epic from Academy Awarding winning Director Peter Jackson, and here he reminds us once again that he certainly deserves that title.
I:10;1407;King Kong is a classic retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story and the original was groundbreaking in its use of special effects.
I:10;1408;Remaking a classic will always attract harsh critics.
I:10;1409;for me, a lover both of classic films and of modern science fiction, I place King Kong (2005) among the best films I have seen in years.
I:10;1410;In the cinema, this was a true spectacle to behold.
I:10;1411;The action and CGI special effects were astounding.
I:10;1412;Peter Jackson took a fairly sparse story and fleshed it out.
I:10;1413;jackson tweaked the storyline a bit and improved on the original.
I:10;1414;The introduction of the writer (Brody) as love interest instead of the ship captain made more sense and was simply a better story.
I:10;1415;With this version, I was at least as moved or more as an adult.
I:10;1416;I believed that they had made a bond with each other.
I:10;1417;The moment of Kong's demise is one of the most touching moments I have seen in a film in years.
I:10;1418;finally, James Newton Howard's soundtrack is quite moving, with beautiful, stirring melodies befitting this grand film.
I:10;1419;Worth listening to in its own right.
I:10;1420;have if you love this film and want more background information.3.
I:10;1421;I enjoyed seeing the deleted scenes.
I:10;1422;Being a huge fan of the original, I have always been leery about a remake of this classic adventure film.
I:10;1423;I went to the theater with an open mind and hoped for the best.
I:10;1424;the film being set in the 30's like the original was key for me and I found Naomi Watts to be a fine Ann Darrow.
I:10;1425;Jack Black also impressed me because while his usual persona is a zany comedic actor, he plays Karl Denim with just the right amount of cheesy Ed Wood glee.
I:10;1426;the film is long at close to 3 hours, but I was never bored, it takes a third of the film before we reach Skull Island, but it gives us a chance to soak up the characters and the beautiful detail Jackson put into this film.
I:10;1427;It also has a huge amount of brand new extras to help temp you even further.
I:10;1428;now we reach the make or break moment when we see Kong for the first time.
I:10;1429;He is a sight to behold and I actually like the extended version at this point because the chase is much more hectic with more monster mayhem.
I:10;1430;there is a connection with Ann and Kong, in the 70's version it is quite silly and comes across campy, but in Jackson's version it seems very believable because Kong is an intelligent creature, an ape, not a monster.
I:10;1431;The scene where they bond is very touching and I find it believable to a point, the point being if you can suspend disbelief for an ape that is 30 feet tall, then you can believe the bonding of two intelligent creatures.
I:10;1432;kong acting more like an ape helps give the story more depth and I found this version to really be the most interesting of all of them.
I:10;1433;Like I stated in my first sentence, I am a huge fan of the original seeing it 100 times in my lifetime, but this is the reason for a remake, to bring something new to a story without losing sight of the original concept.
I:10;1434;the dinosaur fights, especially the triple threat T Rex battle with Kong are long but impressive, the most unconvincing is the Brontosaurus stampede, over the top, but still very good for the most part.
I:10;1435;It is a nice contrast to the sappy story between Ann and Kong so I liked it overall.
I:10;1436;oK, now we get to the Big Apple and the inevitable, the sad demise of this beautiful creature and while in the original we feel empathy for the little animated puppet Kong brought to life by Willis O'Brien, in Jackson's version it brings you to tears.
I:10;1437;There is one shot in particular that I found extremely heartfelt as Kong takes his stance atop the Empire State building not knowing exactly what he is up a against, he prepares to battle and protect Anne no matter what his fate.
I:10;1438;It is truly a wonderful moment, the kind of moment that is why we all go to see movies in the first place.
I:10;1439;, making possibly the best giant creature film ever made.
I:10;1440;There is a lot to be said about King and about Kong.
I:10;1441;The rest is not very good, but a nice distraction on a Sunday afternoon.
I:10;1442;meter baby monkey and breastfeeding it!
I:10;1443;if Peter Jackson proved anything with Lord of the Rings, he proved he could create perfect fantasy worlds.
I:10;1444;Even the old world of New York city was captured with a supreme beauty.
I:10;1445;story Line, I think Peter Jackson's work with Lord of the Rings should speak for itself.
I:10;1446;the movie was entertaining, but that's about it.
I:10;1447;"Peter Jackson's treatment of ""King Kong"" deserves kudos."
I:10;1448;The special effects were top rate, along with the dialog, cinematography and good acting, and it's action scenes!Even though I've seen the original, this movie also deserves credit for it's take on a familiar theme!
I:10;1449;I give this movie three stars!
I:10;1450;The Kong and Ann relationship at the core of the movie is handled excellently.
I:10;1451;The joy on his face is evident.
I:10;1452;And then when this tiny person actually stands up to the giant we can see why he might even respect her more.
I:10;1453;In the LOTR trilogy we see CG creatures we believe in and even more important the actors seem to as well.
I:10;1454;A fun fantasy flick with truly good animal special effects albeit cartoonish landscape ones.
I:10;1455;"The dinosaurs, bugs and especially KK seem genuinely alive moreso than even ""Jurassic Park,"" and that's saying something."
I:10;1456;As the movie unfolds the relationship between the delectable Ms. Watts and the hulking King draws you in and, at the end, you're sympathetic for the big guy.
I:10;1457;And it's a wonder Ms. Watts' clothes stay on as much as they do given all the Perils of Pauline she goes through.
I:10;1458;"era New York City is especially well and entertainingly depicted, in light and detail as opposed to the dark Gothams of the ""Batman"" franchise."
I:10;1459;hey, this movie succeeds as well.
I:10;1460;The soundtrack of a movie makes such a difference in becoming a part of the movie.
I:10;1461;Excellent movie, incredible computer generated effects, great cast, for me the best King Kong movie ever, highly recommended in Blu.
I:10;1462;There is plenty to nitpick about in this three.
I:10;1463;hour adventure epic, but I would be hard pressed to challenge the expansive power of filmmaking wunderkind Peter Jackson's imagination and how he is able to translate his vision so vividly on film.
I:10;1464;art computer graphics, what I appreciate most about this 2005 version is the respect Jackson obviously has for the original 1933 film classic and his innate understanding of what still works from that story.
I:10;1465;Smitten with Ann, Jack sets out to rescue her, while Denham's target is capturing Kong.
I:10;1466;Avoiding the ironic humor arising from humanizing Kong (a big misstep with the 1976 version), Jackson keeps Kong's behavior consistent with a gorilla's albeit one who has become the last of a gigantic, aggressive subspecies.
I:10;1467;The film's most resonant aspect is the unconventional love story between Ann and Kong .
I:10;1468;Jackson and his crew somehow make it all credible.
I:10;1469;For all of the deadly fauna of the island, I am even more impressed with the recreation of 1933 Manhattan, in particular Times Square, the authentic.
I:10;1470;feeling detail of which is mind.
I:10;1471;While it's true that the computer animation gets too obvious at times, especially in the avalanche of activity on Skull Island, we still reap the benefits of Jackson's successful realization of his vivid imagination around the King Kong fable.
I:10;1472;He is like a modern.
I:10;1473;day Cecil B. DeMille with Spielberg's more whimsical savvy, and his movie is masterful popcorn entertainment.
I:10;1474;The best KingKong movie ever made in my opinion, thanks to Peter Jackson.
I:10;1475;Loved the casts (Black and Watts), and of course, the special effects, WOW!
I:10;1476;ray, both video and audio, it's a treat to your senses.
I:10;1477;A great addition to your movie library.
I:10;1478;This is a great update of a Movie Classic using all of today's technology to make an exciting period piece.
I:10;1479;The recreation of early thirties New York is spectacular.
I:10;1480;This movie is great, second only to the Lord of the Rings.
I:10;1481;The girl is very likable, the hero is a real man who's not afraid to do anything for the woman he loves, and Kong is awesome!
I:10;1482;alike Adrien Brody as Ann Darrow's second choice love interest.
I:10;1483;i did love the sumptuous look and feel for the time period depicted, the fabulous adventure on Skull Island (I could have enjoyed more of this and less of the love interest between Kong and Darrow), and the lovely score by James Newton Howard.
I:10;1484;( die you nerd oldie fan.
I:10;1485;is a good version of king kong is like old version ,dont have any grainy play and looks perfect,is nice to watch it.
I:10;1486;The last line in the editorial review mentions technical and emotional heights.
I:10;1487;"This film improves on the original version ten times over by utilizing modern technology to achieve super action storytelling
I:10;1488;Nothing more can be said other than this is a fantastic movie.
I:10;1489;the Good: The CG Kong and T. rex looked great.
I:10;1490;Various old scares and many other details, made them look believeable and they also maintained there size throughout the whole movie.
I:10;1491;The scene in the park was pretty sweet and gave ya a warm feeling.
I:10;1492;The fact that a beautiful women falls for a average looking guy was nice to see for a change.
I:10;1493;Three T. rex chasing one blonde girl ever after chasing a larger meal, yeah okay.
I:10;1494;conclusion: It was an okay movie.
I:10;1495;Great visuals and Adrian Brody is awesome as always.
I:10;1496;Definitely go for the original cut.
I:10;1497;We still have that but this is a nice addition.
I:10;1498;This movie keeps to the spirit of the original, whilst including state of the art special effects and exciting action scenes.
I:10;1499;This makes the movie much more emotionally sophisticated and interesting than its predecessor .
I:10;1500;I thought the casting, effects, and soundtrack were great in setting the mood (Naomi Watts was perfect as the new Ann Darrow).
I:10;1501;Best of all, Kong himself looks superb, both realistic and empathetic.
I:10;1502;But at the end of the day, like its predecessor, this movie is about finding wonder in the world (or the movies).
I:10;1503;King Kong shows the epic struggle between the exotic, capitalism, and modern society .
I:10;1504;one epic battle after another, after another.
I:10;1505;All of them are very well done and will get your adrenaline pumping.
I:10;1506;the best thing I can say about this movie is that it makes the original obsolete .
I:10;1507;Jackson's remake captures everything great about the original, while updating the special effects and filling it with an even better cast.
I:10;1508;disc set will include a 13.
I:10;1509;The new footage will include over 230 additional special effects shots.

I:10;1525;I bought this edition only for the gift, and I was really really satisfied with this edition the art of King Kong on the top of the Empire State building is awesome.
I:10;1526;now, obviously most people liked this movie.
I:10;1527;Which further reaffirms my pessimism about the world's taste.
I:10;1528;really,i cant tell one good thing about this one.
I:10;1529;the visual effects are great.
I:10;1530;it takes nearly an hour for us to see it already.
I:10;1531;i mean it is actually funny if you can stand watching it.
I:10;1532;"then they bring the kong,which is bigger in some scenes and smaller in others
I:10;1533;ok we got it you can make good creatures look like real.
I:10;1534;Peter Jackson took some great care in the making of the film.
I:10;1535;Casting Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow was a smart move.
I:10;1536;He just got on my nerves as did his eyebrows.
I:10;1537;Is it really necessary for music to be in every single scene in a movie?The real star of the film is King Kong himself.
I:10;1538;He may be computer generated but he is very realistic in terms of facial expressions, and body movements.
I:10;1539;King Kong's interactions with Ann Darrow were my favorite scenes, especially in the last half hour of the film.
I:10;1540;King Kong definitely could have been shorter.
I:10;1541;We've seen quite a few films (at various degrees of acclaim), novels, cartoons, toys, et al.
I:10;1542;Peter Jackson's epic manages not only to show Kong's sheer power, but a wide range of emotion as well.
I:10;1543;Anyone out there a fan of Beauty and the Beast stories?
I:10;1544;this cut of the film is 201 minutes long, worthy of the mighty Kong himself.
I:10;1545;Peter Jackson said in a recent interview that he casted Black mainly because his children are a fan of Black's.
I:10;1546;Group of cast members are able to escape being flattened to pancakes when having a marathon race with a bunch of dinosaurs.
I:10;1547;nails superior to stay away.
I:10;1548;naomi Watts carries the film and proves (yet again) that she's one of the top actresses we have.
I:10;1549;This movie surpasses the previous and compares favorably to the original.
I:10;1550;King Kong defends his lady love unto death.
I:10;1551;He takes on 3 t rex's!
I:10;1552;In real life the t rex's would have won but this is Hollywood and the good guy prevails.
I:10;1553;ray, including the extended version and theatrical version is good and all, but it's missing something from the 3.
I:10;1554;I loved that documentary, so I don't think this Blu.
I:10;1555;Perhaps those who have a hard time sitting still for 3 hours will enjoy the film when they can take periodic breaks.
I:10;1556;I was captivated by the first part as I watched an amazing depiction of New York City circa 1930 in full color.
I:10;1557;I also enjoyed getting to know the characters and am at odds with those who disliked Jack Black.
I:10;1558;Naomi Watts was absolutely radient and was a joy to watch.
I:10;1559;The Skull Island sequences provided dazzling, edge.
I:10;1560;seat entertainment with a truly believable CGI ape battling harrowing creatures.
I:10;1561;And lastly, the Empire State scene was breathtaking and Peter Jackson did a great job creating empathy for the great Kong.
I:10;1562;All told, this was an excellent modern reimagining of a great story.
I:10;1563;Kong is given a more ferocious and more human appearance, while the CGI effects are top.
I:10;1564;Naomi Watts, Jack Black, and Adrien Brody are absolutely amazing here (but they still can't top Wray, Armstrong, and Cabot).
I:10;1565;And the action is what you would expect from a Kong film, only that it's probably the most exciting we'll ever see when it comes to this version.
I:10;1566;It's got great effects, wonderful jungle settings, and a new and improved look for the ape himself.
I:10;1567;"although most of my friends rave about and praise the LOTR trilogy, I only really like the last 2 of the series(in the first movie you could easily save like 45 minutes of the movie if you took away Frodo's annoying panic gestures shots that lasted for at least 5 minutes each, I don't know, I just felt it as being too long) and then, of the last 2, the Return of the King is really a ""classic"" to me."
I:10;1568;well, I am happy of having given it a shot, since when I first learned that Peter Jackson was making a remake of King Kong, I thought.
I:10;1569;But since it was Peter Jackson's version I thought I might give it a shot and I'm glad I did.
I:10;1570;When I saw the dinosaurs in the movie trailers, I thought.
I:10;1571;"woman"" love the one that was developed on screen, it was more like a big admiration and friendship they felt for eachother."
I:10;1572;This is where the picture shines the best.
I:10;1573;It is intense, compelling and wonderfully acted.
I:10;1574;In fact everything that takes place is so intense, you don't notice the audience around you anymore.
I:10;1575;Naomi Watts was her usually outstanding self for the roles she is given.
I:10;1576;She has an Oscar coming to her one of these days.
I:10;1577;And a very good job for Adrian Brody as well.
I:10;1578;Still today's kids will eat this one up.
I:10;1579;And it was well worth the admission price.
I:10;1580;It needs to be seen on the big screen because it is good old.
I:10;1581;Peter Jackson is bonafide big time director.
I:10;1582;This movie is pure cinamatic gold.
I:10;1583;Great action, great story, alright acting and fantastic SFX.
I:10;1584;There's a part of me that feels a bit guilty proclaiming King Kong my favorite movie of 2005.
I:10;1585;However, the fact remains: King Kong is my favorite movie of 2005.
I:10;1586;budget Hollywood movies can be very good.
I:10;1587;What makes the difference is the passion and craftsmanship on display.
I:10;1588;The interest and love that the filmmakers have for the material and the ability to pull it off.
I:10;1589;This is a very personal movie for Peter Jackson, perhaps even more personal than The Lord of the Rings.
I:10;1590;While watching the movie you can almost see nine.year.
I:10;1591;In reality, Jackson is 44 and the backyard is now a huge New Zealand movie set, however the passion is still there.
I:10;1592;This is an action/special effects movie helmed by Peter Jackson.
I:10;1593;king Kong is a success both as epic spectacle and dramatic storytelling.
I:10;1594;The fact that the woman actually has chemistry with the ape is only one of this movie's wonders.
I:10;1595;The film contains some of the most amazing sights you're likely to see on the motion picture screen, but never at the expense of drama and characterization.
I:10;1596;It has moments that are genuinely moving, for example one scene towards the end involving Ann Darrow and Kong on a frozen pond.
I:10;1597;It has moments that are frightening, such as the second act on Skull Island where Carl Denham and crew encounter any type of slimy oversized beast you could imagine.
I:10;1598;It has thrills and lots of them.
I:10;1599;The Skull Island scenes have some of the most astonishing action sequences anyone has seen.
I:10;1600;Even when the movie seems to be turning into Jurassic Park 4, Peter Jackson always manages to put something new and refreshing on the screen.
I:10;1601;Each time a new dino appears on the screen, Jackson utilizes it in a way that we've never seen before.
I:10;1602;Kong's fight with multiple T. rexes is sure to go down in cinematic history along with the epic battle from Jackson's Return of the King.
I:10;1603;The final act of the film, in which Kong is brought captive to New York City, is as spectacular as anything on Skull Island.
I:10;1604;If you've seen the 1933 film, or even if you haven't, you know what happens but it is still an incredible, very moving finale.
I:10;1605;The whole Empire State Building sequence is just amazing.
I:10;1606;I think most everyone will agree that Naomi Watts is superb as Ann Darrow, doing justice to Fay Wray in the original.
I:10;1607;I was pretty pleased with Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll as well.
I:10;1608;The real star of the movie, however is Kong.
I:10;1609;Given life by Andy Serkis (Gollum in Lord of the Rings), Kong is a true marvel.
I:10;1610;generated ape that actually gives a believable and quite moving performance.
I:10;1611;Quite a tremendous accomplishment by Andy Serkis and the effects team at WETA.
I:10;1612;This is an epic story and the extra hour allows Jackson time to flesh out his world with details and extra character development that make all the difference in creating a real film instead of just a special effects picture.
I:10;1613;even with those quibbles, King Kong is a spectacular movie.
I:10;1614;I would highly recommend it to everyone except perhaps small children.
I:10;1615;The Skull Island scenes will be very frightening to kids.
I:10;1616;Movie lovers of all ages will find much to love in this beautiful, touching and exciting update of Merian C. Cooper's classic story of beauty and the beast.
I:10;1617;It is another triumph for director Peter Jackson and one of the best movies of 2005.
I:10;1618;Quite a long movie, but what a thrill to watch!
I:10;1619;I loved it not only for its superficial superiority as a movie, but also for all the implications concerning beastliness and beauty, psychology and tyranny, and the world we really live in.
I:10;1620;I highly recommend this movie for anyone who has the time to watch it.
I:10;1621;At the thrird time goes the winning.
I:10;1622;A very well done KING KONG, directed by Oscar Winner newzelander Peter Jackson (Lord of The Rings, Frightners, and others)
I:10;1623;"The thought that ran through my mind the first time we witness Kong in Peter Jackson's superb remake was simply, ""I wish Cooper were still alive to see this today."
I:10;1624;Peter Jackson has again accomplished the impossible, by taking a familar piece of pop culture widely known and recrafting it in his own stunning vision.
I:10;1625;King Kong is the distillation of Jackson's boyhood ideals and adult mastery of craft, all combined with the most advanced digital technology possible, to create a masterpiece.
I:10;1626;He has taken the best elements of the previous films and added even more (perhaps a little too much more), and the result is a sight to behold.
I:10;1627;Perhaps truly for the first time ever, Kong lives, and he is King.
I:10;1628;fated tale begins with Ann Darrow (a radiant Naomi Watts), an attractive and ambitious vaudeville comedian struggling to make ends meet in Depression Era New York.
I:10;1629;The famous and gifted Jack Driscoll is writing the story, after all.
I:10;1630;and so our intrepid voyagers set sail.
I:10;1631;This occurs in the first hour of the film, and we are introduced to more of the crew and get familiar with our characters and how they operate before the violence begins.
I:10;1632;He always seems to occupy the same space as our characters, and his movement, look (is that real hair???)
I:10;1633;, and uncanny emotion all make him completely believable.
I:10;1634;Jackson makes the choice to have Ann and Kong develop a two.
I:10;1635;way relationship, and as strange a choice as it sounds, it nonetheless works marvelously.
I:10;1636;That is the major triumph of this picture, and that is why I feel it superior to the two previous attempts to bring Wallace's novel to the big screen.
I:10;1637;this is, after all, an action film.
I:10;1638;And what thrilling action it is!
I:10;1639;"Although the film succeeds because it takes the time to have quiet moments, many will see ""King Kong"" primarily for the louder ones, and it doesn't disappoint."
I:10;1640;Jackson lets his fertile imagination go wild here, and it pays big dividends for the audience.
I:10;1641;and the actors acquit themselves superbly as well.
I:10;1642;Naomi Watts plays Ann as thoughtful, resourceful, and slightly over.
I:10;1643;emotional, choices that work in the throwback context of the film while also keeping her grounded (and easy to identify with) as a character.
I:10;1644;Adrien Brody is better here than in anything else he's done since winning that Oscar, and Jack Black is.
I:10;1645;more than a movie this is an experience!
I:10;1646;when in the world would you expect good acting from him (and his role was pivotal) but it was such a surprise to see him become the role.
I:10;1647;Adrien Brody (although i dont like him at all) was great as well.
I:10;1648;This is the best film of the year.
I:10;1649;Peter Jackson has outdone himself once again.
I:10;1650;The special effects are truly amazing, but its Naomi Watts who truly makes this film shine.
I:10;1651;The story is wonderful and exciting.
I:10;1652;Everything from the acting to the films score is perfect.
I:10;1653;Now this is interesting: is Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' worth all the hype?
I:10;1654;let's start with the fun part.
I:10;1655;The movie has some of the most spectacular and breathtaking effects ever put on the screen.
I:10;1656;This film jumps from action sequence to action sequence at a breakneck pace, throwing the audience into visual assualt after visual assault.
I:10;1657;we begin our story in New York City of the 1930s.
I:10;1658;one of the best visions of a past New York ever filmed.
I:10;1659;It's almost surreal, the images of the Great Depression, and they stick with you well into the movie.
I:10;1660;(Let me also say, that Naomi Watts gives one of her best performances here, and she's absolutely adorable as the 'Beauty' in this tale.)
I:10;1661;Fate intervenes when she meets a young filmmaker, Carl Denham (Jack Black, unusually surpressed.)
I:10;1662;After an hour, the film kicks into high gear at this point.
I:10;1663;He is now the king of the jungle.
I:10;1664;Kong, we understand, loves Ann.
I:10;1665;Jack Driscoll takes it upon himself to bring Ann back, when everyone else gives up.
I:10;1666;He grabs his love, and ascends to the summit of the Empire State Building.
I:10;1667;Back to those 'issues' I told you about.
I:10;1668;It works better this way, so when we first see Kong, it's so powerful and terrifying.
I:10;1669;There are amazing scenes, quiet scenes between Ann and Kong, that you really start to see Kong as a character.
I:10;1670;Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings, is again using the incredible technology 'motion capture' to provide animators with the 'performance' of the Kong character.
I:10;1671;It's amazing, and the Academy needs to nominate Serkis for his work (although they never will, chuckle.)
I:10;1672;A perfect remake with a lot of surprises that the original Black and White could not offer.
I:10;1673;THe most exciting part of this movie is the middle when they are looking for Kong.
I:10;1674;"The cinematography and the ""new"" creatures were interesting."
I:10;1675;I really loved this movie, but Jack Black is an awful actor.
I:10;1676;Realism is everything, and it gets better all the time.
I:10;1677;At the TOP of the craft is Peter Jackson and WETA.
I:10;1678;but I don't enjoy second guessing Peter Jackson, one of Gods gifts to cinema.
I:10;1679;The film is visually exciting, well.
I:10;1680;The good points are otherwise well.
I:10;1681;By succumbing to big scene excitement (eye.
I:10;1682;In this remake of a classic.
I:10;1683;remade, Peter Jackson pleasures himself and his investors at our expense.
I:10;1684;Both are creatures of their environment: both made and unmade by the Depression.
I:10;1685;"The Kong of the original was a metaphor for fear come alive and to terrorize Gotham (and the US) borne right out of the heart of darkness into the ""feast"" of the Great Depression."
I:10;1686;"art airplanes and the ""top guns"" of the time."
I:10;1687;maidenhood, motherhood, Lady Liberty, and civilization itself come to life in its most captivating, yet ennervating form .
I:10;1688;The original, folks, was a grand mythical metaphorical snapshot of the times: it was about saving the girl, killing the monster, and restoring order to a very dark, very threatening world that was the US in the very early Thirties.
I:10;1689;Quite unlike our neurotic maiden in this version, played with rare verve by Naomi Watts.
I:10;1690;"he just wants his ""tiny dancer,"" dammit!"
I:10;1691;separating beast, to primal intellectual whose moment of great aesthetic reverie is in watching the sun go down with Anne, to pure intellectual who knows he must die once he's gazed at pure Platonic Beauty.
I:10;1692;KING KONGI remember watching the original Kong film back in the day and every one that followed and could not help but be entertained by every one although the first was the best.
I:10;1693;I have always enjoyed Kong films and have only rooted against him when he took on the greatest of all time in Godzilla.
I:10;1694;Of course once I heard Peter Jackson was directing I knew it was in good hands, he was always one of my favorite filmmakers.
I:10;1695;There are love stories going on, an adventure tale and so much more.
I:10;1696;I will say from the beginning that I truly believe that this film is indeed a classic remake or not, Peter Jackson did a remarkable job with this film.
I:10;1697;In doing so he meets a young actress named Ann Darrow [Naomi Watts] and convinces her that she is perfect for the part of his female lead.
I:10;1698;Now I am sure that you all know at least that the girl is found and brought back to New York.
I:10;1699;But there is something else that is brought back with her, and that is the mighty Kong.
I:10;1700;Kong is brought back to be a tourist attraction and labeled as one of the marvels of the world.
I:10;1701;i have to say that remake or not this could easily be in the best films of all time and to be honest it could have swept the Oscars and rightfully have done so.
I:10;1702;The thing I was most surprised at was that Jack Black was not even nominated for best supporting actor, I still think he could have easily won it.
I:10;1703;Speaking of that the acting in this film is wonderful and fits the time period it is told in.
I:10;1704;the film has that old school classic Hollywood style and the acting matches it.
I:10;1705;Like I said Jack Black surprised a lot of people with this film, he did a great job taking his comedic style out and adapting the high energy he gives off in those performances into the maniac he plays in this.
I:10;1706;Also Adrien Brody does a marvelous job here and gives another career performance here, he was perfectly cast much like Black.
I:10;1707;Naomi Watts brings that classic Hollywood style to this film and likewise does an excellent job here, she comes off as the classic beauty.
I:10;1708;Thomas Kretschmann, Colin Hanks, Andy Serkis, Evan Parke and well everyone in this film give excellent performances.
I:10;1709;The film is full of multi dimensional characters, action, drama, romance, adventure, and well everything you can think of.
I:10;1710;"It truly is amazing how Jackson and company were able to so with this film and this extended edition only adds to the magical film that is ""King Kong""."
I:10;1711;That film is also very well done and very funny.
I:10;1712;Of course there is an excellent commentary by Peter Jackson as well as so much more that only add to the replay value of this release.
I:10;1713;i highly recommend owning this 3.
I:10;1714;disc extended edition because not only is the film great but the extras alone make this worth owning.
I:10;1715;My brother and I watched this again not to long ago and had a great time doing so.
I:10;1716;KIA thanks for bringing this back to my attention.
I:10;1717;The story line nearly hold your attention.
I:10;1718;The acting all good but for Jack Black with every scene same impression on his face.
I:10;1719;New York City looked like a big model set with cars.
I:10;1720;In fact the 1976 King Kong to me was more realistic and had better effects.
I:10;1721;If you have an excellent stereo system to play this through or a good surround sound system, you will be thrilled.
I:10;1722;The picture is also excellent and it is a good story.
I:10;1723;This is one you will want to own on Blu.
I:10;1724;it is also alot more scarier and definitly alot more intense.
I:10;1725;The CGI is almost perfect.
I:10;1726;the acting is great(IF u ignore Jack Black's trying performance.)
I:10;1727;Although Peter Jackson is known for big budget extravaganzas, this little art house film may be his finest work yet.
I:10;1728;It is a brilliant, albeit somewhat obvious, metaphor for American imperialism in the post.
I:10;1729;He uses superior technology to dominate the brutal hairy dictator, then brings him before the world court of public opinion, hoping to bask in the limelight as a true hero.
I:10;1730;jackson proves, however, that in the end it's not high ideals or fitting justice that wins out the day.
I:10;1731;bravo, Mr. Jackson, for this roadmap out of the War on Terror.
I:10;1732;Let me start out by stating that the movie was terrific!
I:10;1733;The outside mail covering was in perfect shape.
I:10;1734;Entertaining through and through, this King Kong is a great update of a Hollywood classic like everyone is saying.
I:10;1735;But it's more than that.
I:10;1736;It's a simple and beautiful scene, and shows Kong's strength as a survivor, while at the same time revealing his own sadness.
I:10;1737;And the predator known as the human race.
I:10;1738;Not only do I think he'll do a better job than someone like Ridley Scott, but his two main talents, for visuals and inspiring emotion, will definitely be put to great use.
I:10;1739;the graphics and visual along with the acting is well worth 3 hours.
I:10;1740;the love story between King Kong and Ann are an addition to why one should see this movie.
I:10;1741;i hate the part when he gets captured and killed but, the adventure is worth the ride.
I:10;1742;"Peter Jackson's passionate remake of ""King Kong,"" is deeply mesmorising and profoundly beautiful, capturing and signifying many of the themes that the original failed to execute to the fullest."
I:10;1743;"making abilities
I:10;1744;"honoured masterpiece, only comes round once in a blue moon, so I knew before watching it that ""King Kong,"" would not surpass such perfection."
I:10;1745;"But Jackson's remake of King Kong,"" IS successful in one monumental way, in that it finally puts the term ""movie remake,"" in an honourable perspective."
I:10;1746;and this is where Jackson REALLY succeeds.
I:10;1747;With care, this film is visually, musically, and emotionally charged, allowing audiences to not only appreciate it as one film, but appreicate the original's profound beauty.
I:10;1748;I liked Naomi Watts' portrayal of Anne Darrow.
I:10;1749;She has the ability to transport messages and feelings through her expressive eyes.
I:10;1750;"The idea of emotion through eyes is one the main aspects of the film, as King Kong himself is projected through his incredible expressions (accentuated by the genius that is Andy Serkis of ""LOTR's"" Gollum fame)."
I:10;1751;I loved the chemistry between Anne and Jack (Adrien Brody), whose relationship is romantic and tranquil.
I:10;1752;Their scene on top of the Empire State building was a part I found particularly lovely.
I:10;1753;Peter Jackson takes special care to build up their bond, making their heartbreaking final minutes on top of the Empire State all the more tragic.
I:10;1754;Essentially, Kong loved Anne so much, that he sacraficed himself.
I:10;1755;the other successes of this film is its technical and musical attributes.
I:10;1756;The special effects are sublime, and truly state.
I:10;1757;The creation of Kong himself is revolutionary and visual effects Oscar the film garnered was more than deserved.
I:10;1758;james Newton Howard's score is captivating and haunting.
I:10;1759;I bought the soundtrack and it really is one of my favourites.
I:10;1760;The love theme for Anne and Kong is tranquil, and the music expressing Kong's famous fall to his death is heart.
I:10;1761;five minutes are so iconic, and so beautiful.
I:10;1762;This is the best remake around, providing a vivid reconstruction of the original masterpiece.
I:10;1763;There was a couple of big reasons.
I:10;1764;one of the good things about it was the kept it back in the pastand that they kept to the story.
I:10;1765;"The 1933 KING KONG was very much ""state of the art"" and then some for its era, a great financial success, and even as special effects have advanced it has remained a great favorite."
I:10;1766;on the surface, the film has a lot going for it.
I:10;1767;Jackson seems to feel that if one was good in the original film, then three or more will better.
I:10;1768;A great many people have said it looks more like a video game than a movie, and the criticism is dead on target.
I:10;1769;King Kong cements Peter Jackson as our generation's premiere maker of fantasy films.
I:10;1770;We all know the story of King Kong, especially the infamous final scene, but this film kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
I:10;1771;It manages to stay faithful to the original intent, while modernizing it at the same time.
I:10;1772;The special effects are absolutely fantastic.
I:10;1773;This movie is a must see and an instant classic.
I:10;1774;house pretensions to deconstruct masculinity works against an adventure narrative.
I:10;1775;I'm surprised Kong even had any hair on him.
I:10;1776;The suspense of the original, that is, will beauty escape the ferocious beast, is dispensed with resulting in a limp conclusion.
I:10;1777;He was a bit of a `jerk', but a lot more fun.
I:10;1778;Don't take no for an answer, slap her about a bit and you'll win fair maiden's heart.
I:10;1779;History is littered with charismatic explorers.
I:10;1780;kong `nicely' rounds off a wretched year for film.
I:10;1781;The communication between Kong and Ann is very cool and funny.
I:10;1782;Naomi Watts is great in this, but the real star is KING KONG!!
I:10;1783;His realistic movement and expression is amazing.
I:10;1784;You can surely tell that Peter Jackson was the director just by the way he films and shows the landscape.
I:10;1785;He gives us an amazing visual experience that only he could accomplish.
I:10;1786;They crash into some rocks in arrival and there is some nice wave effects.
I:10;1787;The make up of these islanders is hideous but very cool and gets the audiences' attention.
I:10;1788;She is lowered to the ground in a way that will amaze you.
I:10;1789;Kong shows up and is attracted to Ann.
I:10;1790;The part where Kong fights the crew on the large log is classic.
I:10;1791;I'll just have to see it again.
I:10;1792;The capture of King Kong is incredibly better than I expected and my expectations are always high in movies.
I:10;1793;There are some emotional moments for Ann here as she is in love with both guys who saved her life.
I:10;1794;finally, after all of this comes the return to New York City.
I:10;1795;Rampaging around New York lifting cars, buses, and women who look like Naomi Watts but never finding her, King Kong finds his grumpy side again.
I:10;1796;Ann finds him and they share some stares into each others eyes.
I:10;1797;The finale scene atop the Empire State building is just grand.
I:10;1798;Overall, King Kong is for sure the best movie this year.
I:10;1799;The characters are emotionally convincing.
I:10;1800;The Lord of the Rings is just as great a movie, but isn't at all like King Kong.
I:10;1801;King Kong will be adored by audiences there will be applause.
I:10;1802;I, like almost everyone else, watched the original King Kong on tv while growing up and enjoyed it greatly.
I:10;1803;I still marvel at what they were able to accomplish in this film way back in 1933.
I:10;1804;However while I admire the orginal Kong, I absolutely love Peter Jackson's remake and consider it a masterpiece.
I:10;1805;first of all, this is a film that must be seen on a big screen.
I:10;1806;I saw it twice in the movies and watched the blu.
I:10;1807;i love everything about this film from the incredible job Jackson and the Production Designers did in recreating 1932 New York City to the masterful job the special effects technicians did on Kong and the incredible emotions that they were able to show on his face.
I:10;1808;The action scenes are incredible especially a wild Brontasaurus stampede, a battle between Kong (while holding Naomi Watts in his hand) and 3 Tyranasaurus Rexes and the final confrontation between Kong at the top of the Empire State Building and about 10 World War 1 byplanes.
I:10;1809;The three leads are excellent: Naomi Watts, absolutely lovely as Ann Darrow and boy can she run, Adrien Brody, not exactly your average leading.
I:10;1810;man, but very good as Jack Driscoll and Jack Black, an actor that I don't usually care for, perfect as Carl Denham.
I:10;1811;ray are excellent and never should have been cut: a vicious triceratops attack and a terrific and scary scene involving a vicious underwater creature picking the men off as they are rafting through the jungle.
I:10;1812;The music for this film by James Newton Howard is excellent, the Oscar winning special effects almost beyond belief.
I:10;1813;"But then again Peter Jackson had plenty of experience making difficult films since he made this one right after completing the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, 3 epic films that I look forward to seeing released on blu."
I:10;1814;This remake of the 30's classic is excellent.
I:10;1815;Animation and action is high power and constant.
I:10;1816;The characters and some of the new twists actually add to the story of our beloved and misunderstood Kong, who is only searching for his true love.
I:10;1817;It transported me to a time when I was a child, filled with wonder and bursting to acquire new experiences that would tickle my imagination.
I:10;1818;As an adult, it's much rarer that I might find something that fills me with such delight .
I:10;1819;rate adventure tale with everything I could hope for.
I:10;1820;A lost island, filled with prehistoric beasts and monsters, a fascinating cast of characters (special recognition for Jack Black), and of course, the giant ape himself (marvelously realized by the motion capture of Andy Serkis).
I:10;1821;but in this movie, those special effects really are SPECIAL, pulling off some incredible imagery that made my heart race and my eyes bulge.
I:10;1822;it blends in perfectly, which to me is the sign of artists who take great pride in their work.
I:10;1823;This is one of the best adventure movies I've ever seen, if not the very best, and one that should delight imaginative viewers of all ages.
I:10;1824;Because of that, these transient virtually created images will never achieve the kind of legendary status that decades of real cinematic craft have given us, and that, decades after their premieres, are still loved and idolized.
I:10;1825;"this ""KONG"" is no fun."
I:10;1826;"How about an ""exciting"" mid."
I:10;1827;Sorry, Ms. Watts seemed earnest enough, but, well, at least she tried.
I:10;1828;Just don't make me have to sit and watch her exchange drawn out, longing, deeply meaningful glances with either Adrien Brody or a piece of CGI ever, ever again.
I:10;1829;At least the '76 version is redeemed by Rick Baker's genius.
I:10;1830;Real actor in a real costume, real rubber, real hair, real light striking a real surface.
I:10;1831;Fay Wray, by all accounts a brilliant mind, confirmed her intellect when she personally declined Jackson's offer to appear in this project.
I:10;1832;The extended feature, and all the information and inside looks to help you really understand what a great achievement it is!
I:10;1833;Man, lotsa people are taking this movie way to seriously, particularly those who don't like it.
I:10;1834;But, what can I say, I had a helluva good time.
I:10;1835;I mean, geez, it's an epic.
I:10;1836;It's supposed to feel big and the length fits the general tone and mood of the film.
I:10;1837;I think this works a lot better than I would've anticipated, but that no great feat as I anticipated that it wouldn't work at all.
I:10;1838;the film does have a fairly lengthy opening section, but I was always passably amused.
I:10;1839;once they actually get to Skull Island we are fairly quickly treated to some more or less endless action scenes, and they are generally quite spectacular.
I:10;1840;But, on the other hand, maybe the critics are right.
I:10;1841;Still, once Kong gets back to smashing stuff it's pretty sweet.
I:10;1842;The finale is also pretty well done, though I think it's a bit excessively operatic.
I:10;1843;the acting is generally pretty stylized, so it isn't really good by modern standards, but it does fit the mood of the film.
I:10;1844;Yes, he can't really handle the more dramatic scenes so well, and I definitely wearied of looking at his fat face, but he's fine in the lighter parts of his performance.
I:10;1845;Watts is good enough as Ann, making her affection for Kong more plausible than one might've anticipated.
I:10;1846;This is a just a big, fun, silly movie, albeit with some heart.
I:10;1847;About as good as this kinda thing gets.
I:10;1848;This is a wonderful production.
I:10;1849;I have all of the various versions that have been made of the King Kong story and this by far is the best.
I:10;1850;Naomi Watts is mesmerizing as she transforms from a simple vaudvillian actress to the stronger minded woman, determined to outwit and escape from the beast, only to realize in the end that she alone could provide the release that the ape needs as he is tormented and killed by people who have no understanding of his plight.
I:10;1851;"Reviews of ""King Kong"", the technically, visually, and dramatically stunning 2005 remake of this now classic cinematic tale, are legion on the Amazon's North American WWW sites."
I:10;1852;"The sheer lore of ""King Kong"" on screen in its three full length motion picture versions fascinates but also certainly intimidates a writer to review any or all of these movies
I:10;1853;"breaking importance to the history of cinema in many ways
I:10;1854;"What interests me most, though, after having viewed the 1933, the 1976, and the 2005 films, is the characterisation of the actors in the principal roles (which differ somewhat in the naming, and even career types, of the personages), each ""take"" on the characters of this epic story having its own kind of validity."
I:10;1855;ape itself, of course, entails a sophisticated resort to cinematic artifice to bring this character to screen.
I:10;1856;The 1933 film did this with a degree of sophistication that still commands respect, even compared to the 1976 mechanical ape.
I:10;1857;What sets off the 2005 achievement is how life.
I:10;1858;Bruce Cabot's impersonation is rather of the stolid and thoroughly sailor.
I:10;1859;"Jeff Bridges is irresistibly physical and hiply handsome, quite up to any challenge that the human savages, the savage jungle, or the even more savage creatures therein, and New York City in chaos, all pose
I:10;1860;For me, however, Adrien Brody's exquisite Jack is the most nicely detailed in portrayal, gently rakish, sensitive, and quite visibly head.
I:10;1861;heels in love with Ann right from the moment when he first encounters her.
I:10;1862;Brody succeeds in rising to the challenge of Jack's ordeals in the jungle and then in mayhem.
I:10;1863;beset New York City in a way that overcomes, convincingly, what one would expect of the slender, fit, but muscularly only modestly developped wordsmith as Brody embodies him.
I:10;1864;"(Jamie Bell's considerable dancing talents had been in high profile in his first film, ""Billy Elliot"", in which Bell played the title role.)"
I:10;1865;fay Wray as Ann Darrow in 1933 remains the most pschychologically convincing realisation of the role, waiflike but very pretty and perhaps the most consistently wary of Kong's fierceness.
I:10;1866;like palm is the most visually striking moment for that gal in any of the three versions!
I:10;1867;tender aspects of Kong's nature.
I:10;1868;"all three versions of ""King Kong"" are worthy of this tale's primal (and primate) appeal, even if it is the 1933 and 2005 movies' spectacular effects, respectively for early sound film and for later cinematography, which most immediately draw the attention of mass audiences to them."
I:10;1869;It's awesome!Jackson and his talented actors and crew have created a masterpiece of a film that fully engages the viewer.
I:10;1870;so realistic is Kong that you fully expect him to really exist.
I:10;1871;Brilliant, simply brilliant!Naomi Watts is simply marvelous in her Fay Wray role.
I:10;1872;She brings life and innocence to what could have been an unforgiving role opposite Kong's upstaging.
I:10;1873;And yet, their scenes together are some of the most brilliant in the film as she and Kong truly seem to connect.
I:10;1874;the cast of actors are all memorable and well cast.
I:10;1875;I particularly liked Jamie Bell's portrayal of a stowaway.
I:10;1876;One features Kong, Watts, and three huge Allosaurs.
I:10;1877;this is good stuff folks.
I:10;1878;personally, I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in ages.
I:10;1879;they did the absolute best they could with the script and over.
I:10;1880;let's hope that they stay with the better scripts we're all used to seeing these solid actors in.
I:10;1881;Peter Jackson did a fine job wrangling the long, winding opus of Lord of the Rings to the screen with a good, enthusistic cast, decent effects and a fair appreciation for the source while not being a total slave to it.
I:10;1882;His efforts were lavished with good box office, plenty of recognition, awards along with critical acclaim and a blank check from the studios on what he wanted to do next.
I:10;1883;superior edits of the LOTR movies prove he can do this.
I:10;1884;she gamely gives it her all and her scenes with Kong are what make this long affair watchable.
I:10;1885;great story with drama and emotion, wonderful special effects and some great acting by Naomi Watts.
I:10;1886;call the 1933 film CORNY if you like but it is still the best film of it's kind.
I:10;1887;"Now
I:10;1888;Well, if you have you might have an idea as to the the amount of items on this menu!It is bar none the most spectacular special effects movie I've seen to date!
I:10;1889;After the crew arrives at Skull Island, it becomes one CGI blowout after another, finally culminating back in New York City, in what I believe is the very best CGI effects in the whole movie {which is hard to define because everything looks so great, but the buildings, cars, etc seem to add something that a jungle can not},.
I:10;1890;everybody knows the story, so you won't find a reference to that here.
I:10;1891;I bet that would be something really cool!
I:10;1892;The actor who played the captain was excellent.
I:10;1893;I also thought the visuals of the biplanes at the end were extraordinary, but I'd turn the air blue if I described what I thought about the rest of the movie.
I:10;1894;WAY off target, not worth viewing, honestly, and I expected a terrific movie.
I:10;1895;Great plot, great acting, and you come out crying.
I:10;1896;It's everything the original has and more.
I:10;1897;once Kong arrives, you are glued to your seet.
I:10;1898;I pray there will be a sequal.
I:10;1899;this is the best movie of the year, perhaps of all time.
I:10;1900;fi super hero action movies, I quite liked this film.
I:10;1901;It is grossly in need of editing its 3 hour plus time frame, but the remake of the old movie is a good story well told with some fine actors making it all a joy to see.
I:10;1902;one reason for the success of this version was director Peter Jackson's decision to keep it in the 1930s in the same time frame of the original.
I:10;1903;The recreation of the Depression is quite effective and energizes the need to believe in this fantasy film.
I:10;1904;Naomi Watts yet again proves that even in roles opposite a computer generated Kong she can still creates illusions as an actress far better than most.
I:10;1905;She is a fine heroine for the story.
I:10;1906;For those who equate Jack Black with potty mouth dumb movies his performance will surprise in its sensitivity.
I:10;1907;But finally we realize the purpose was giving time for Watts to create a credible relationship with Kong and all is forgiven.
I:10;1908;the tenderness of the story makes it work and there is a lot to be said about understanding, caring, relating, greed, and animal brutality that make this film ring true.
I:10;1909;KING KONG is simply so much better than expected that despite is excesses it still is a very good movie for all that!
I:10;1910;I was ready for the film to be over long before the monkey hit the pavement With these words Laurel K Hamilton's character Anita Blake wonderfully summed up Peter Jackson's well intentioned, brilliantly re.
I:10;1911;In place of the wooden, 2 dimensional characters of the original piece Jackson presents well developed people you want to learn about.
I:10;1912;especially surprising is Jack Black in a serious role, as Carl Denham, the man responsible for the expedition.
I:10;1913;He's a con man and an artist and someone who's company you'll love, as long as you accept you're paying for the drinks.
I:10;1914;in his Lord of the Rings trilogy Jackson proved that great film comes from the actors and the F/X are there to support them.
I:10;1915;Give us back those wonderful characters!
I:10;1916;while the chase through New York City is far more realistic, one of the great scenes in American Film is the original Kong on top of the Empire State Building.
I:10;1917;in the end Jackson's respect for the original leads him to end with the same words from Denham.
I:10;1918;His unfailing ability to destroy the things he loves.The same is true about directors who remake their favorite films.
I:10;1919;"The epic scope of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy was breathtaking and inspired awe."
I:10;1920;"millenium"" movie goers can keep their Peter Jackson with his flashy CGI gorilla."
I:10;1921;you probably already knew that considering the original is the greatest monster movie ever made.
I:10;1922;still this remake is a good try and peter jackson has obviously become one of the better film makers in the world.
I:10;1923;she seems to be in love with it.
I:10;1924;anyway, this was a very difficult assignment for jackson (on the order of a remake of frankenstein) and he did a pretty good job.
I:10;1925;the movie is at least visually spectacular.
I:10;1926;for those who have never seen it, check out the original KING KONG and see what i mean about it being the greatest monster movie ever made.
I:10;1927;it's much better than this remake.
I:10;1928;about an hour into the movie I wanted to walk out.
I:10;1929;He showed a lot of talent in The Lord of the Rings.
I:10;1930;I expected a more intelligent movie, but then again it is King Kong.
I:10;1931;After a very promising beginning the scenes of depression era New York City look well researched and lovingly recreated this film heads down hill fast.
I:10;1932;Now back in the real world the film ask us to suspend reality while we watch Kong take out his skimpily clad girlfriend for a date which includes ice skating in Central Park and ultimately a lovers lookout on top of the Empire State Building.
I:10;1933;King Kong itself is the best thing about this movie, the artistry of the creature is spectacular.
I:10;1934;Jackson has taken a very simple fairy tale and fleshed it out into a bloated if not obese special effects movie with little charm or reason to enjoy.
I:10;1935;This is a very good movie.
I:10;1936;it is a very long but a very fun movie to watch.
I:10;1937;Dispite this it was a pretty good movie.
I:10;1938;The cgi was brilliant, as the acting was to.
I:10;1939;I mean the way the natives of the island were, amazing, kind of creepy.
I:10;1940;I thought it was gonna be a very much more interesting movie.
I:10;1941;the effects are great, what ever.
I:10;1942;The scares are reserved for the striking island scenes during the first half, that serve as a techno.
I:10;1943;but I enjoyed the film as an entertaining tongue.
I:10;1944;cheek homage to early Hollywood and the original monster.
I:10;1945;The special effects and cinema work are a feast for the eyes.
I:10;1946;Lots of dinosaurs for dinosaur fans.
I:10;1947;For me, a fan of loving relationships, the relationship between Ann and Kong was beautiful to watch, especialy the sceen in central park in New York city with Kong playing on the ice.
I:10;1948;I have a dull pain near my navel area and it becomes sharp as I touch my lower right abdomen.
I:10;1949;But what better, than to try and get my mind off it by watching a great movie.
I:10;1950;So I get there 45 minutes early so I can get a great seat.
I:10;1951;At least that was entertaining.
I:10;1952;Of course, King Kong is gonna do great business around the world and attract audiences from all over the world and be a big bang.
I:10;1953;like Lord Of The Rings, this film takes it times to create the effect of a time distant from today and there are a few scenes where the cinematography is quite good.
I:10;1954;King Kong is just right for his size until the time he starts swinging on rocks and hanging from cliffs.
I:10;1955;with the earnestness of a movie lover that I am.
I:10;1956;It is impossible for King Kong to have been perfect but it's the magic of film making that truly brings the best out of mankind and I expect Peter Jackson to capture that essence.
I:10;1957;a very staunch effort,glorious budget,enthusiastic script yet a very disappointed Kong Lover,that's me.
I:10;1958;Of course I will watch this film atleast two times more.
I:10;1959;and I mean that in a good way.
I:10;1960;And the animators who brought Kong to life.
I:10;1961;"They turned him into the perfect leading ""man""."
I:10;1962;screen chemistry than I've seen from most real human pairings in the majority of today's romantic comedies.
I:10;1963;Additionally, while many people have disparaged Jack Black's performance as Carl Denman, I thought he was spot on as the smarmy self.
I:10;1964;I was captivated by it almost all the way through.
I:10;1965;Yet, I wanted to see it so I ordered it.
I:10;1966;The cast was a mixed bag with some wonderful artists present in it.
I:10;1967;Still, for absolute well filmed craziness, I do recommend it with a few reservations.
I:10;1968;One of my favorite movies ever and I guarantee you will love it too!!
I:10;1969;Great movie, scenes extras magnificently complement the work of Jackson.
I:10;1970;i've seen it like 3 times, I love it.
I:10;1971;The special effects are the best I have seen, I mean come on just look at it, and for all that might not know CG Effects like the ones they did for the film it is very hard to make it look great in daylight and in the film lots of effects are in daylight and they just looked great.
I:10;1972;The movie is great but the extended cut (three.
I:10;1973;Peter Jackson is my favorite director, mainly because of his earliest movies.
I:10;1974;So me and my best friend went to see King Kong, and I have to say that I was amazed.
I:10;1975;All the CGI was so convincing.
I:10;1976;The scenery was so beautiful, yet it was very unsettling.
I:10;1977;But let me tell you, Peter Jackson made it much, much better by adding on to the original story.
I:10;1978;The high points in the film are as follows:.
I:10;1979;when they are down in the pit with all of those mutated looking centipedes and huge grasshopper looking insects, it's VERY unsettling and highly entertaining at the same time.
I:10;1980;the casting was also great.
I:10;1981;Naomi Watts and Jack Black were outstanding.
I:10;1982;They did an amazing job with this movie.
I:10;1983;i hope everyone gets the chance to go see this.
I:10;1984;I can't say that it surpasses the original, but it still must be one of the greatest movies from the past 10 or 20 years.
I:10;1985;What a lovely 90 minute film that lies within these 187 minutes.
I:10;1986;The cast is great though, but sadly Kong is just one of many monsters on the island and the most exciting scene is the escape from frightened dinosaurs.
I:10;1987;In 1976 Kong is a great beast with almost human qualities .
I:10;1988;the 1976 film has great locations, while this is a blue.
I:10;1989;moment in New York is BAAAAAAAAAAD.
I:10;1990;the sacrifising of Ann is both good in 33 and 76, here .
I:10;1991;and magical moments are far between because Jackson doesn`t dare to slow down.
I:10;1992;He is just curious and collects her as a prized possession.
I:10;1993;but it is an OK contribution to the myth of Kong.
I:10;1994;It's NOT the best Kong, but it's OK in a trilogy of the giant.
I:10;1995;"Peter Jackson's ""Kong"" was not just a movie but a thrill ride."
I:10;1996;A hyper thrill ride that touched me in so many areas.
I:10;1997;The narrative was just as powerful as the visual.
I:10;1998;kong's battle with the two T. rex was the best special effects I have ever seen.
I:10;1999;The intricate attention to detail as they fell down the cliff was uncanny.
I:10;2000;I found myself cheering for a alpha male like myself.
I:10;2001;i rooted for Kong as if I had a front row seat at a Mike Tyson fight.
I:10;2002;It is the best of the year, and is extremely entertaining even though it's 3hr10min.
I:10;2003;the movie is set in the Great Depression with Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) a gorgeous actress put out on the street.
I:10;2004;A movie producer (Jack Black) offers her the chance of a lifetime to star in his new movie written by her idol, a screewriter played by Adrien Brody.
I:10;2005;The parts on the island are the best, absolutely splendid.
I:10;2006;The action is nonstop and the special effects are brilliant.
I:10;2007;Meanwhile Ann is swooped up by Kong, and they form a bond as he saves her from countless dinosaurs and insects.
I:10;2008;They are so sweet together and it made me feel like saying a[.]
I:10;2009;The fights are insane and frickin' sweet.
I:10;2010;He laughed, cried, and shouted in pain.
I:10;2011;the acting is good, but Adrien Brody's nose always got in the way.
I:10;2012;Jack Black was spledid and Naomi Watts was dazzling.
I:10;2013;But Kong stole the show by far.
I:10;2014;He was so real it's scary.
I:10;2015;the action is UNBELIEVABLE and wonderfully made.
I:10;2016;So the action is some of the best I've ever seen.
I:10;2017;the movie in the end is a love story on steroids.
I:10;2018;It's sweet, sad, awesome, etc.
I:10;2019;The ice skating part is so sweet!You will get so attaced to the big ape that the end will completely destroy you and beg for a happy one.
I:10;2020;They're nearly killing Anne!King Kong is the best movie of the year, a pulse pounding drama that's got it all.
I:10;2021;This adapted version of the well known towering classic, a pyramidal cult movie of 1933 directed by Merian Cooper, received a distinguished and honest homage by Peter Jackson.
I:10;2022;jackson not only produced mesmerizing special effects along the road, but most important still, focuses about the myth and explores through a very zealous dissection, in several levels.
I:10;2023;The Eighth wonder of the world .
I:10;2024;and bring it back to our civilized world in order to be admired for the excited crowd, in search of new and challenging emotions.
I:10;2025;I did enjoy watching Kong's emotions though.
I:10;2026;That was probably the best part.
I:10;2027;Kong is really a metaphor for inter.
I:10;2028;One hopes Peter Jackson has better use for his talents.
I:10;2029;I love reading all the reviews.
I:10;2030;it's amazing how everyone seems to be put out about the computer.
I:10;2031;historic island, and a 50.
I:10;2032;foot tall ape, as well as dinosaurs and other pre.
I:10;2033;historic reptiles?I mean, it's all made up, and it's all fake, and it all sprang from some writer's imagination, and it is all very entertaining, and even enthralling.
I:10;2034;how wonderful is that?I thrilled at the original King Kong, and agree that it is truly the Granddaddy of all science.
I:10;2035;breaking: How original and mind.
I:10;2036;This movie is no doubt the epitome of the most effective use of computer.
I:10;2037;the fact is that much of the stuff we see on the screen today is computer.
I:10;2038;ray and I thought it was amazing.
I:10;2039;Universal's transfer of this epic onto Blu.
I:10;2040;ray is a show piece for the Blu.
I:10;2041;The picture is crystal clear and vibrant in color.
I:10;2042;The CGI effects in this film are fantastic.
I:10;2043;The sound has many sweeping effects that will give your surround sound system a complete workout.
I:10;2044;Its a shame what they did to such a great classic film.
I:10;2045;The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character.
I:10;2046;Easily the year's best movie.
I:10;2047;What an unbelievably amazing epic masterpiece.
I:10;2048;This movie will reach you, and make you feel in a way that movies generally don't.
I:10;2049;With all respect for the talents of Mr. Peter Jackson, clearly the most promising young directors on the rise, I'll be the first to admit that I was among the skeptics who saw no reason whatsoever for the making of this film.
I:10;2050;The 1933 original was a perfect film, a classic.
I:10;2051;"That's mainly in its favor
I:10;2052;and that's just what makes it so good.
I:10;2053;Jackson made King Kong with as much love for Merian Cooper as he had for Tolkien when he made Lord of the Rings.
I:10;2054;"Jackson shows real care and respect for the material he works with
I:10;2055;King Kong is a joyful celebration of cinema (right down to a wink and nod to the wonderful starlet of the original film, Fay Wray, who was meant to have a cameo in the film but passed away before she could make it).
I:10;2056;Peter enjoys every second of renewing the beloved film of his youth, and we enjoy it with him.
I:10;2057;King Kong is a wild ride, a movie made perfectly that never stops entertaining for a minute, and it's the greatest fun you'll know.
I:10;2058;the cast is for the most part excellent.
I:10;2059;Naomi Watts does a great job filling in for the late, great Fay Wray, and her Vaudeville scene on Skull Island is outstanding.
I:10;2060;Best among the cast is Jack Black, a fantastic actor who is yet to reach his peak, who does a fantastic job filling the mighty shoes of Robert Armstrong as Carl Denham.
I:10;2061;part as trusty sidekick Lumpy, plays Kong himself, to outstanding results.
I:10;2062;Like he did with Gollum, Andy shows remarkable control of his body language, and Kong turns out to be the most impressive and convincing CG character seen on the big screen yet.
I:10;2063;If you love the original and classic cinema in general, it's highly recommended.
I:10;2064;Even if you don't, it's still guaranteed to be three of the most entertaining hours of your life.
I:10;2065;I am usually opposed to making remakes of major classics that are beloved by huge numbers of people.
I:10;2066;Back then, you had to be creative to get something you wanted on the screen.
I:10;2067;Today, all you have to do is type a couple buttons on a computer.
I:10;2068;That was definitely BUILT, and by HUMANS!
I:10;2069;That huge stone wall in the new version.
I:10;2070;i did enjoy this version of King Kong.
I:10;2071;Most of it looked fine.
I:10;2072;(I'm pretty sure that's the Lucille Ball special he's in.)
I:10;2073;"I like the idea that Jackson chose the silver back gorilla as king kong unlike the king kong movies of the 30's and the remake of the 80's , and he did it back in time (30's when the original came out , ) the part when kong is starting to ""fall in love"" with the girl is best illustrated in the classic scene when and she wanders into the jungle and gets confronted by a t. rex !"
I:10;2074;out of nowhere , Kong appears , grabs hold of the girl , and constantly tosses the girl between both hands and even his feet !
I:10;2075;gotta watch it , !!
I:10;2076;Jackson truly is an amazing director !
I:10;2077;kudos to Jack Black as well , gifted actor
I:10;2078;Seeing King Kong (2005)reminded why I liked movies in the first place, it takes you on a journey that captures your imagination and carries you through a series of emotions and makes you feel like a kid again.
I:10;2079;I believe its destined to become a new classic and when people remember the films of 2005, King Kong would definitely one of the most forefront on our minds.
I:10;2080;Bravo to Universal Pictures and especially to Peter Jackson, for remaking the film that made him want to be a filmmaker in the first place.
I:10;2081;It's a great film and most certainly one for the books.
I:10;2082;The CG dinosaurs and Kong are amazing: especially when you look at the old King Kong from the 30s with beasts that are so fake you have to laugh.
I:10;2083;That's all well and good, if action is what you want.
I:10;2084;looking, a really sweet guy who happened to fall in love with a human being.
I:10;2085;"It's touching, but we are not talking about anything remotely ""real"" here."
I:10;2086;This is a perfect remake.
I:10;2087;The fauna is more important though.
I:10;2088;All the dinosaurs, and giant bugs, and giant worms, and giant bats, etc.
I:10;2089;Yet the film is great because visually it is a treat, a highstyle and highpleasure treat.
I:10;2090;All the scenes, the creatures, the landscapes, mountainscapes, seascapes, urbanscapes are superb and the droning planes at the end are just as funny, strange and fascinating as the droning giant mosquitoes or wasps in the middle.
I:10;2091;It is brilliant and the eyes of the Beast are so human that we understand why the Belle fell in love with him, because he becomes a him at that moment, at the moment of his death, a wilfull death.
I:10;2092;Just enjoy the luxuriance of the special effects.
I:10;2093;Even after suspending disbelief to get into this movie's world, you have to keep on going.
I:10;2094;How she keeps from breaking her neck, or even getting whiplash, is amazing.
I:10;2095;(And the scenes with them doing a sort of drugged dance was really worth a chuckle.)
I:10;2096;All that said, it's entertaining.
I:10;2097;It's worth about $5 to see.
I:10;2098;King Kong is visually stunning, incredibly heart wrenching and masterfully acted.
I:10;2099;We see him as more than a giant ape: we see a fierce protector, a loyal friend and an unconditional innocence combined in one.
I:10;2100;She entertains him with juggling and he in return shows his appreciation by protecting her against numerous jungle creatures.
I:10;2101;Their friendship will touch the deepest part of your heartstrings, especially with the scene when they ice skate and King reminds you of a little kid and when they are at the top of the Empire State Building and Kong makes the sign for 'beautiful', which Ann taught him back at Skull Island.
I:10;2102;She reluctantly agrees to be a part of his project when she hears legendary writer Jack Driscoll is also a part of it.
I:10;2103;The universal theme stays the same in this movie: 'Leave animals in their natural habitats!'
I:10;2104;These days, it is rare to see the main hero or protagaonist die at the end of the movie.
I:10;2105;Good things, in such times, seems to be ephemeral.
I:10;2106;But it is a needless death of a creature of awesome physical prowess and agility with genuine human need for companionship which deeply disturbs us.
I:10;2107;"at the end, one of the characters mention ""it was beauty that killed him""."
I:10;2108;This killer instinct and behavior, it seems, is one of the reasons why we are at the top of the evolutionary heirarchy.
I:10;2109;But it is also what makes us the most cruelest creature of all.
I:10;2110;The movie works great and all and I love it.
I:10;2111;Movie starts out good but gets a little boring in the middle favorite character was King Kong mostly due to Andy serkis as King Kong an the love he portrays towards Naomi watts
I:10;2112;I found this film one of the best films of 2005.
I:10;2113;It's a great action adventure epic that they dont make anymore.
I:10;2114;The acting was great the story was great and the directing was great everythign about this movie was great.
I:10;2115;The special effects where excellent and looked life like.
I:10;2116;Overall a must see movie event that is one of the best films to come along in a while.
I:10;2117;I just finished watching the entire 3 disc extended edition with all the extras, including the film with commentary by Peter Jackson and screenwriter Philippa Boyens.
I:10;2118;I must say it was worthwhile as I am a Kong.
I:10;2119;Those two dinosaur scenes (which are included in this edition) amounted to 13 minutes of great action.
I:10;2120;captured before going to New York.
I:10;2121;viz, for short, which was absolutely necessary to make this film and to make Kong come to life.
I:10;2122;This is how Kong was brought to life, literally.
I:10;2123;And there are plenty of Kong artwork from the 1996 pre.
I:10;2124;Peter Jackson has made a dual love story here .
I:10;2125;The scenes are vivid, nearly constant, and in one or two cases (think man.
I:10;2126;and the journey to reach it .
I:10;2127;Look this is a great film, it's everything a movie going experience should be.
I:10;2128;It's action, suspence, drama, humor, sci.
I:10;2129;fi, and a love story all in one.
I:10;2130;There are Jaw dropping special effects and beautifull photography.
I:10;2131;If you just forget about all that and go with it you will have a much better time.
I:10;2132;Go to the theatres without any expectations but just with the hope of being entertained for a while and perhaps to escape the reality of your life for a few hours and you will have a good time.Yes I can recognize all the imperfections in the film too but I don't expect it to be perfect in the first place.
I:10;2133;We are human, imperfect beings by nature, therefore we can never create something perfect because we have no real concept of perfection, it is something only God can know and Peter Jackson is not God but he has done a pretty good job as a director so stop critisizing sit back and enjoy, if you don't like it go to film school and try your hand at it.
I:10;2134;twenty worth of character development, and this is a solid piece of entertainment.
I:10;2135;The leads make the first half of the movie watchable, and once the big man himself gets into the picture (Kong, that is.
I:10;2136;pieces are expertly timed and delivered (the insect pit delivers the kind of full.
I:10;2137;shivers we haven't had since Indiana Jones), and the Empire State Building climax is truly dizzying and spectacular.
I:10;2138;know.You's of this one, but the ultimate payoff is well worth it.
I:10;2139;She develops an affection for the beast.
I:10;2140;Watts is beautiful and slides into the role naturally.
I:10;2141;The remake is thrilling if you can hang in for 3 hours and 7 minutes.
I:10;2142;From director Peter Jackson(Who also directed the best movies of all time, Lord of the Rings) comes King Kong.
I:10;2143;The first hour could have add a little time taken off of it but I thought it was fine, because i love long movies.
I:10;2144;The part when they are on skull island is the best part in my opinion.
I:10;2145;Jack Black plays the guy with the camara whos leading expedition(forgot his name in the movie) and does a good job with it.
I:10;2146;I was really surprised when i learned he was in this movie.
I:10;2147;I didn't really recognize any of the other actors in this movie, but that is fine, cause i like having newer guys play in movies.
I:10;2148;Naomi Watts does well in her role and so does all the others.
I:10;2149;and I'm very much a Tolkien fan!
I:10;2150;He's obviously going to look bigger inside a New York theatre as compared to the top of the Empire State Building.
I:10;2151;I can certainly forgive a few feet here or there if it's done for good cinematic effect.
I:10;2152;another question mark is the taxi cab chase.
I:10;2153;The detail of the early city scenes, the character building on the boat, the dramatic build up to the finding of the isle, the sweeping landscapes of the jungle, the terror of the native attack, the dinosaur fight scenes, the vertigo of the airplane assault scenes all must be experienced (preferably in the theater) to be understood.
I:10;2154;But hey, take any review with a grain of salt, especially from a self.
I:10;2155;When I heard (or read) that Peter Jackson was going to remake King Kong, I was excited to see it, mainly because special effects have advanced so much since the 1933 original film and the 1976 remake.
I:10;2156;I knew Jackson's work in the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy was spectacular, so I figured that would translate well into King Kong.
I:10;2157;The special effects were amazing, as I knew they would be.
I:10;2158;I rarely shed tears at a movie, but this one had me shedding quite a few.
I:10;2159;I have never seen a more moving film than King Kong.
I:10;2160;He is a real gorilla in this film (albiet 25 feet tall), and that is the difference.
I:10;2161;"The relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow is a friendship, not a ""love/lust"" interest."
I:10;2162;You realize Kong is very lonely, the last of his kind, and in Darrow, he has finally found a friend, one that he is willing to give his life to protect.
I:10;2163;peter Jackson has created a masterpiece.
I:10;2164;Yes, the special effects and action sequences are stunning, but what is more stunning is the emotional impact of this monumental film.
I:10;2165;The obvious star of this film is the talented visual.
I:10;2166;They managed to revive a story that is all too well known, allowing even fans of the original classic to enjoy it like new.
I:10;2167;It really is amazing how spectacularly they were able to achieve the feeling of newness from one of the classics.
I:10;2168;Watts manages to convey all sorts of emotions, evoking real care and sympathy from the audience.
I:10;2169;King Kong to survive, just so the love doesn't die.
I:10;2170;"Watts really pulls it off
I:10;2171;the early scenes from New York, the shots from Skull Island's fortress, and the amazing wildlife soon thereafter were all a testament to the special.
I:10;2172;Even to the end, Kong's pureness and beauty shines through, protecting Watts until his death.
I:10;2173;It's emotional, classic, and one of the best movie endings ever.
I:10;2174;i love this remake more than the original black and white version, simply brilliant.
I:10;2175;it comes in dts 5.1 digital surround sound and the scenes are so crisp and clear and realistic looking that you almost imagine that you can step into the t. v. and into kongs world!
I:10;2176;king kong 2005 is awesome, a great remake of the 1933 original classic.
I:10;2177;Asides from the fantastic new animatronic scenes which adds towering adventure and blood curling excitement, the real 'special' effect to this new version is King Kong himself.
I:10;2178;All in all, this remake is truly a welcomed contender to the original, earning the director and his cast enormous applause for a film which not only hit it's mark, but does so with fulsome praise from audiences everywhere.
I:10;2179;This is the breathtaking spider sequence that was cut from the original version of this movie.
I:10;2180;As this is a monster movie, it seemed appropriate, especially to give you a good idea of what kind of place Skull Island is.
I:10;2181;So don't question it, go along for the ride and have fun.
I:10;2182;Take your kids into the movie with caution, I would recommend viewing the movie before them.
I:10;2183;While King Kong isn't as graphic in some ways as Titanic, Titanic is a perfect example of why you would want to view the movie prior to allowing children to view it.
I:10;2184;This extended version reinforces what a great movie King Kong is.
I:10;2185;Special effects were excellent, but that's about it .
I:10;2186;King Kongs always a Great American Movie but if you see it on Blue.
I:10;2187;Love this movie filled with Drama and action.
I:10;2188;a fabulous effects showA rollercoaster ride.
I:10;2189;"and most of all a great great B. movie ""movie""."
I:10;2190;Peter Jackson shows how to do it right.
I:10;2191;the best mainstream movie for b. movie fans ever .
I:10;2192;I was bedazzled by Naomi Watt's sparkling blue eyes.
I:10;2193;anyway, it was truly a surprising and good movie.
I:10;2194;He loves it especially for the dinosaur sceness and additional bonus scenes that aren't in other versions.
I:10;2195;this is the best with so much to see it is sometimes perhaps difficult to watch.
I:10;2196;So much to see, so much to follow to the very end.
I:10;2197;This KING KONG is a tremendous journey of fantastic thrills and fun.
I:10;2198;Just remember, you are watching this fantasy .
I:10;2199;By far, this is the best Kong movie ever made.
I:10;2200;It has a great story line with depth, and the special effects are superb.
I:10;2201;The acting is as skillful as the directing.
I:10;2202;i've liked him in every movie he's been in.
I:10;2203;Jack is known for his intensity, and it simply was not there in this film.
I:10;2204;I will admit that whoever was assigned to the facial expression on Kong did an excellent job .
I:10;2205;he or she was able to show emotion and understanding in every expression.
I:10;2206;The one star is for the special effects and the sets.
I:10;2207;Even the spectacular climax, with its peerless and amazing animation, became so dragged.
I:10;2208;King Kong contains more breathtaking moments than any movie I've ever seen.
I:10;2209;It all culminates with a majestic ice skating scene that will bring you back to the nostalgia of Brian Boitano.
I:10;2210;"Example, the giant ape learns to speak the word ""beautiful"" both in sign language *and* in English!"
I:10;2211;The irony here is that he thought the sunset and woman were beautiful, but he probably lacked the intelligence to grasp that his behavior that night was the most beautiful thing of all!
I:10;2212;This movie is a touch of action and love.
I:10;2213;It is much better than the origanal.
I:10;2214;If you haven't seen it than spoil yourself and see it right now.
I:10;2215;It may seem lengthy being 3 hours but the timeing is perfect.
I:10;2216;This is a 5 star movie, maybe the best of the year!
I:10;2217;Much of this version is so well done!
I:10;2218;A much superior film to the Jessica Lange version of the 70s.
I:10;2219;The raw trerror and power that Kong exudes.
I:10;2220;Jack Black's ambitious, manipulative movie producer is perfect.
I:10;2221;many of the tender scenes involving Ann and Kong are masterful.
I:10;2222;For others, Academy Awards are the brass ring on the carosel, allowing filmmakers a free ride on their next project.
I:10;2223;"in Peter Jackson's case, that means a remake of his first inspiration, ""King Kong""."
I:10;2224;won dream can (at best) leave audiences scratching their heads.
I:10;2225;There's a fogbank and a shipwreck before Carl and his crew make their way ashore.
I:10;2226;A fierce battle ensues, Ann is kidnapped and presented as an offering to a mysterious creature thought to be legend.
I:10;2227;it's love at first sight for the big guy .
I:10;2228;he spirits Ann away, and the middle third of the film is primarily expended in the others' efforts to rescue her.
I:10;2229;packed with other giant beasties.
I:10;2230;Using today's new technologies to maximum advantage, watching them form a bond is funny, tense, and genuinely touching.
I:10;2231;Using the ship's stores, and with Ann and Jack as bait, the crew manages to subdue and capture the ape, preparing him as a sideshow attraction on Broadway.
I:10;2232;the climax in New York, happily, is the film's shining hour, the most polished and emotional portion of the film, vividly illustrating (and building upon) the tragic power of the original.
I:10;2233;It's fantastic stuff, and well worth the wait.
I:10;2234;While the performances of the cast are strong across the board, many of the crew members are over.
I:10;2235;developed, adding to the film's considerable paunch.
I:10;2236;"treatment that served Jackson so well in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy."
I:10;2237;I think this is a great movie although i think it does have some flaws.
I:10;2238;"Peter Jackson has followed up his wonderful ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy with an astounding remake of of King Kong that will leave you spellbound."
I:10;2239;jack Black stars as Carl Denham, a movie producer who is going to make a movie aboard a ship.
I:10;2240;"ann is bound and tied to a wooden rack and offered as a sacrifice to an amazing and mythical creature
I:10;2241;Kong scoops up Ann in his huge hand and bounds away.
I:10;2242;The fight sequence between Kong and the dinosaurs is one of the best sequences of the entire film.
I:10;2243;She sees one of Jack's promotional flyers blow by her window, and she immediately knows what's happening.
I:10;2244;She walks out into the night to find Kong.
I:10;2245;once together, Ann and Kong somehow end up on an ice skating pond, with Kong laughing and playing on the ice.
I:10;2246;Kong, seeming to know what his ultimate fate will be, scales the building until he reaches the top, all the while carefully carrying Ann in his hand like a newborn.
I:10;2247;Once on top and having suffered numerous hits from the guns of airplanes buzzing around them, Kong and Ann share a final, tender moment.
I:10;2248;this is a tremendous film, and it deserves much more than five stars.
I:10;2249;The scenes on top of the Empire State Building are the best in the movie, with Kong swatting planes out of the sky like mosquitos.
I:10;2250;But beyond the special effects, the story is very good, and touching as well.
I:10;2251;The relationship between Kong and Ann is very moving, and you can see how much Kong cares for her by the way he protects her from danger throughout the movie.
I:10;2252;The final scene on top of the Empire State Building is probably the most moving scene in the film.
I:10;2253;Kong, resigned to his fate, makes sure right up until the very end, that Ann is safe.
I:10;2254;i give this movie my highest recommendation.
I:10;2255;The special effects will blow you away, but what will keep you watching is the touching and genuine relationship between a beautiful woman and a large but caring gorilla.
I:10;2256;King Kong is a well put together movie (both the movie itself and the 3.
I:10;2257;State of the art special effects, great characters, action, drama, comedy, and Peter Jackson's directing.
I:10;2258;Easily his best movie since 'Dead Alive' (a. k. a. 'Braindead').
I:10;2259;Jackson stayed true to the 1933 original that he loved so much by remaking the movie with today's technology.
I:10;2260;While some may see this as laziness, I see it as Jackson's homage to the one movie that inspired him to be a filmmaker.
I:10;2261;Firstly, Naomi Watts is one of the greatest actresses of all time.
I:10;2262;I enjoy anything and everything she does.
I:10;2263;She can say so much with her face, which is important in this movie as her part (Ann Darrow) is light on dialogue.
I:10;2264;Her character is extremely important because she has the most interaction with Kong (our title character) and we learn a lot of what is happening with Kong through her.
I:10;2265;Although the filmmakers did such a fantastic job with the special effects and motion capture that Kong himself is also very good at expressing his feelings (sans any dialogue,of course), a lot of which is due to the multi.
I:10;2266;Jack Black is fantastic (he's the character you love to hate in this movie) and Adrian Brody is good as always.
I:10;2267;The cast and crew really had a great time shooting this movie and it shows.
I:10;2268;If you like Peter Jackson: watch this movie.
I:10;2269;Sorry, Peter J., loved LOTR but you couldn't one.
I:10;2270;"A colosal encounter with one T. rex with realistic body trauma, not ""Disneyesque"" PG damage would have been far more scarier and involving."
I:10;2271;This type of incongruity diminished a potentially great film.
I:10;2272;He has turned this classic story into a slam.
I:10;2273;ann Darrow's relationship with Kong is depicted in a superior way to the original movie.
I:10;2274;motion effects in the original, I always thought Kong lacked in persona.
I:10;2275;Adrien Brody plays a great Jack Driscoll as well.
I:10;2276;Brody is truly a gifted actor and plays a good hero.
I:10;2277;Surprisingly, Black kept his character serious and the movie is better for it.
I:10;2278;The comedy seemed to be reserved for Kong, himself, and did a wonderful job.
I:10;2279;Moreover, Andrew Lesnie's cinematography is as gorgeous as it is kinetic.
I:10;2280;Do I recommend this film?
I:10;2281;You'll probably enjoy it immensely, despite it's over length.
I:10;2282;I absolutly loved this movie.
I:10;2283;The action and special effects are so spectacular that I almost forgot I was watching I movie.
I:10;2284;Add the brilliant soundtrack and once again Peter Jackson has a spectacular hit on his hands.
I:10;2285;I was expecting some good special effects hense me being a LOTR's fan, well thats what i got but in way to big of a dose.
I:10;2286;Even the fight scenes of Kong vs. the T. rex got realllly old after the first 2 minutes.
I:10;2287;Computer special effects are really something amazing these days, but a lot of time i'd rather see things done the old fashion way, or just see the idea of less is more.
I:10;2288;I will say yes that Peter Jackson has once again made something pretty epic, its just a bit TO epic for my tastes.
I:10;2289;tastes differ, of course, and I have friends who rave about what a monumentally entertaining and exciting film this is.
I:10;2290;Don't mess with a legend.
I:10;2291;especially a movie so iconic and mythical as the original l933 King Kong.
I:10;2292;The reason its become a much beloved legend,TV staple is that it only runs 112 minutes and it moves so fast that you just sit there, stunned, as the excitement builds steadily until that unforgettable death of King Kong.
I:10;2293;ending backstories of each of the main characters.
I:10;2294;All of them are talented in their own way, but Naomi Watts is so atheletic and feisty as Ann Darrow that we can't really sympathize with her plight.
I:10;2295;It was Fay Wray's fragile but sensuous beauty that made her a perfect heroine.
I:10;2296;ending shots of Naomi Watts face.
I:10;2297;Back and forth, stares galore, and I kept looking at the clock.
I:10;2298;with the camera studying his every pore as he stares intently at something beyond the camera range.
I:10;2299;Yet, throughout the movie, he has been one of the action characters, who helps bring Kong back to NYC.
I:10;2300;King Kong directed by Peter Jackson was amazing!!
I:10;2301;In the beginning was a little boring, but when the sotry line got towards the middle and the end, it was very good.
I:10;2302;The special effects are so realistic and jaw.
I:10;2303;Peter Jackson is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood history.
I:10;2304;"King Kong is a great movie, the extras on this edition are very interesting to watch but the only let down is the packaging, this is not a deluxe edition it's ""cheaper edition"", I was waiting something more like the extended editions of the lord of the rings but Universal didn't want to spend money on this set."
I:10;2305;Try harder next time, King Kong deserves something better
I:10;2306;This movie alone is good.
I:10;2307;Great special effects, good acting, nice classic story retold in Peter Jackson's vision, and it is just purely amazing.
I:10;2308;ray, and what emerges is something even greater.
I:10;2309;I saw this film four times in the theater and even with it's shortcomings felt very entertained each time.
I:10;2310;All that's included is a 5.1 Dolby mix.
I:10;2311;Granted that the special effects are fantastic and you can believe that Kong is real, this film could definitely benefit by having at least one hour cut from the running time.
I:10;2312;Yes, it is wonderful to watch Naomi Watts .
I:10;2313;the stampede of dinosaurs is extremely well done, but could easily have been more effective if the time was cut in half.
I:10;2314;this film is an example of let's do it because we can, rather than do it to tell a good story.
I:10;2315;Peter Jackson proved me wrong though because he created one stunning and exciting piece of work.
I:10;2316;Jackson handles their realationship with great warmth.
I:10;2317;They have touching and sweet scenes together.
I:10;2318;jackson really makes us like this Kong and care about him.
I:10;2319;Naomi Watts is great as well.
I:10;2320;She's sweet and loveable and you really believe that she cares for Kong.
I:10;2321;She possibly gives the best performance in any of the versions of Kong.
I:10;2322;"I love the scene where a T. rex is after Anne and she stands in front of Kong with a ""go ahead and try it"" attitude."
I:10;2323;The length is to develop her relationships with Kong and Jack.
I:10;2324;Which makes this the fully developed version of King Kong.
I:10;2325;On top of being touching, Jackson's Kong is also one of the best adventure films ever made.
I:10;2326;Like Titanic you know going in how it's all going to end so the genius of Peter Jackson(As with James Cameron)is that he makes you care so much about what happens in the end.
I:10;2327;king Kong may be 3 hours long but it's bursting with so much humor,excitement and emotion that you won't mind.
I:10;2328;the first section of the movie that focuses on a shifty filmmaker Jack Black trying to get his movie underway is breezy and funny.
I:10;2329;the 2nd section on Skull Island where Kong must defend starlet Naomi Watts from hordes of creatures is incredibly exciting full of one pulse pounding sequence after another.
I:10;2330;the final section in a beautifully realized Depression era New York City packs a heartbreaking punch.
I:10;2331;king Kong works so well because Kong himself is so expressive not just another forgetable CGI creation(Talking about you Jar Jar Binks!)
I:10;2332;and Naomi Watts' intensely believable performance as the woman who can actually relate to Kong's loneliness and vulnerability.
I:10;2333;like Lord of the Rings this is oviously another labor of love for Peter Jackson so King Kong is more than just a fun Saturday night flick.
I:10;2334;a movie with so much creativity and heart it will prove to be an enduring classic in years to come.
I:10;2335;"Peter Jackson of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy fame brought us another epic film."
I:10;2336;Chapter two, the island and the revealing of Kong.
I:10;2337;Chapter three, the return to New York with a captured Kong.
I:10;2338;Of course again, you were also overwhelmed at the special effects of the movie.
I:10;2339;If you want a movie that is overtaken by excellent special effects and superb character development of Kong, then this is the movie for you.
I:10;2340;The secondary characters played their parts well, especially Watts ability to connect with Kong, but the movie, in a nut.
I:10;2341;I remember seeing King Kong as a teenager in the 80s and I was quite impressed by the story, but don't remember having any strong feelings for the mighty Kong.
I:10;2342;Watching this modern version helps you appreciate the work of animal rights activists.
I:10;2343;this beast has a soul!
I:10;2344;Naomi Watts does an amazing job I think getting across a believable performance that she actually cares for this giant beast despite having no spoken dialogue with Kong.
I:10;2345;Jack Black is also well cast as the funny, but ambitious adventurer that you love and hate at the same time.
I:10;2346;brilliant depiction of the other beasts on skull island including the super scary locals, some of the most scary scenes in the film without a doubt.
I:10;2347;i think the people of the world could do with a more daunting feeling about nature and animals.
I:10;2348;Great movie!Great dinosaurs!Great Gorilla!Great Action!Great Romance between beauty and a groilla!But I din't like the part with the bugs.
I:10;2349;puts a tear in your eye when Kong dies.
I:10;2350;It was an awesome ride!
I:10;2351;This movie has some really good acting in it.
I:10;2352;She is a baby doll.
I:10;2353;the Lord of The Rings trilogy is a great example.
I:10;2354;i loved those three movies, but I fast forwarded through at least a third of them.
I:10;2355;Good casting, reasonable acting, especially Naomi Watts and Adrian Brody, and outstanding effects make this a solid fantasy movie to watch.
I:10;2356;"very much showing a ""comic book"" approach to camera angles and stilted dialog in the live action sequences, the film is most remarkable when Kong is in the scene, especially when coupled with the lovely Watts."
I:10;2357;A careful viewer will find lots to be entertained by in this movie .
I:10;2358;A sign of of a really good movie is how well it tells a story.
I:10;2359;In this new, modern, fast paced and exciting film we are transported into the world of Kong and swept away its storytelling.
I:10;2360;It is nothing short of a miracle that Peter Jackson has been able to bring this story to a contemporary audience and retell the story of Kong without said audience laughing.
I:10;2361;It is both epic in scale and human in its pathos .
I:10;2362;Great movie and Great storytelling.
I:10;2363;having viewed the 1933 version a long time ago, I still remember seeing the claymation and funny animations of Kong and the dinosaurs.
I:10;2364;Although it was far from realistic, it was still a lot of fun to watch.
I:10;2365;fast forward 72 years and now Academy Award winner Peter Jackson is finally doing the picture he's always wanted to make.
I:10;2366;"Having enjoyed Jackson's other films such as ""The Frighteners"" (underrated), and the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" (just perfect), I was looking forward to this remake a lot, even though I'm not a big fan of remakes in the first place."
I:10;2367;eating grubs, and a big hairy ape.
I:10;2368;okay, well let me talk about what I did like.
I:10;2369;They kept my adrenaline pumping and were very enthralling.
I:10;2370;the characters in the story were nicely fleshed out.
I:10;2371;I enjoyed Adrien Brody and his character and Naomi Watts was a great Ann Darrow.
I:10;2372;Yet, he came through very well and surprised me.
I:10;2373;Yet, I really liked the other characters of the crew.
I:10;2374;jamie Bell and Andy Serkis in particular were very good and I enjoyed watching them.
I:10;2375;Peter Jackson, as always, had some great direction going for him.
I:10;2376;The cinematography and action scenes were all perfect.
I:10;2377;To say the least, he looked amazing.
I:10;2378;The modeling of his face, his actions, and everything were just spot on.
I:10;2379;Peter Jackson also made a few horror films in his time and he shows off some disturbing images in this story.
I:10;2380;I liked how this film was a strong PG.13 and didn't pull away a lot.
I:10;2381;Kudos to Peter Jackson for that scene.
I:10;2382;that was mainly the good, now onto the bad.
I:10;2383;As I stated above, Kong was perfect and awesome in everyway.
I:10;2384;"Also, I love the ""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" and I thought the CGI served a purpose in the story."
I:10;2385;Jackson's vision of skull island is the most beutifal place ive ever seen in a movie, and the creatures are wonderfully done.
I:10;2386;the second part of the movie is where the film won me over.
I:10;2387;The battle between Kong and the T. rexs is sure to become a classic.
I:10;2388;Another area of the film that really impressed me was the realistic 1930's New York.
I:10;2389;Peter Jackson did a superb job on every level in this film.
I:10;2390;the extended version is even better if you like long movies like I do.
I:10;2391;I can only hope that Peter Jackson will continue to make films like this.
I:10;2392;Great action, except for a buggy, sluggy interlude that is way too long.
I:10;2393;But otherwise a good action flick.
I:10;2394;2 stars.1 Star cause it worked1 Star cause I liked the movie before I bought this.3 Stars because it is SOOO sharp and picture is so clear.
I:10;2395;You can always tell Kong is CGI when in a scene with a live actor.
I:10;2396;My particular tastes run in the boat of giant fantastic creatures that menace others, with or without any logic.
I:10;2397;I love King Kong, as I have since I first saw the remake of the 70's (actually saw that one first).
I:10;2398;Peter Jackson, however, did, does, and always will have this respect and love of the original Kong.
I:10;2399;"Incredible effects highlight ""king kong"", but at it's heart this is a love story."
I:10;2400;"you need a lot of moxie to attempt to remake this classic, and jackson, fresh off his success with ""lord of the rings"" does more than a credible job."
I:10;2401;this is a loving tribute to one of the classics in our film history, and a beautiful version of beauty and the beast.
I:10;2402;"the real action starts once they reach skull island, and the encounters there with various creatures are numerous and over the top, remember to check your ""suspension of disbelief"" at the door."
I:10;2403;naomi watts was great as ann darrow.
I:10;2404;jack black and adrian brody were a bit of a surprise in casting as two important characters, but both did adequately in their roles, the real stars are watts and kong.
I:10;2405;"the return to new york city is extravagantly overdone,as are the island scenes, but keep in mind this is ""king kong"" we're watching, and everything should be done on a large scale."
I:10;2406;the streets and buildings in NY glisten, and are stunning to look at.
I:10;2407;the final scenes in central park and on top of the empire state building with ann and kong are romantic, and heartbreaking.
I:10;2408;Overwelming, eyepoping, sensational popcorn fun.
I:10;2409;A bit over the top in a few scenes, but hey, this is the story of a huge ape, anything goes.
I:10;2410;Jackson captures the emotions big time.
I:10;2411;Entertaining and takes you to a dream world for 3 hours, kudos, Mr. Jackson.
I:10;2412;Let me first say that I am a great fan of Jackson's LOTR trilogy.
I:10;2413;After that, I looked forward immensely to his King Kong remake.
I:10;2414;The movie works well if you are not a 1933 KK fan and are uncritical in terms of the action sequences.
I:10;2415;To set it in the period of the original was a really good (and, I thought, brave) choice .
I:10;2416;"in an interview on Australian TV, Jackson stated that he wanted to make Kong as ""real as possible""."
I:10;2417;OK, despite the above, I enjoyed the movie.
I:10;2418;***The more I ponder Peter Jackson's re.
I:10;2419;Like Cameron, Jackson wanted to transcend the basic, naturalistic action and horror aspects of the tale and meticulously explore a relationship that will outlive death and fate.
I:10;2420;He is still clinging by his fingers.
I:10;2421;He exchanges one last lingering, emotional look with Ann Darrow, then finally lets go.
I:10;2422;fraught, but ultimately enduring friendship between an unemployed actress and a dinosaur.
I:10;2423;scrabble life and talents give her the determination and moxie to take control of the situation.
I:10;2424;Together again, they manage to enjoy a Central Park interlude and even a sunrise view from the Empire State Building before the military and the biplanes cruelly shatter the magic.
I:10;2425;"I disagree
I:10;2426;To get the most out of this movie, give it time to let it carry you away and console you with the fact that in spite of everything, Kong and Ann will always have Skull Island and New York.
I:10;2427;Action packed love story with humor, im really glad the way this one turned out.
I:10;2428;the interaction between the ape and the girl is very very good.
I:10;2429;The ape is very expressive.
I:10;2430;A few close calls would have been fun and exciting, but for there to be close call after close call after close call after close call.
I:10;2431;it gets silly real quick.
I:10;2432;that part was pretty cool and well.
I:10;2433;act NYC sequence leads us to believe that the great unveiling show at the Times Square theatre must have taken place at about 4 o'clock in the morning.
I:10;2434;"In typical Hollywood fashion, she looks like a very cute young actress wearing ""make me look grimy"" makeup."
I:10;2435;Raiders succeeded because it had real fun, real suspense, and a central hero who was in real jeopardy but climbed believably out of it.
I:10;2436;this film rates a 3 1/2 stars out of 5 at best.
I:10;2437;"Watts gets a few moments late in the film, but mostly it is ""damsel in distress"" stuff."
I:10;2438;1976's Jeff Bridges, Charles Grodin, and Jessica Lange managed to rise above the so.
I:10;2439;That is a very important part of that story's mythology and it didn't get addressed properly in this new version.
I:10;2440;In this new version NO ONE fits that bill.
I:10;2441;"from the George Lucas ""How to Make an Expensive yet Disappointing Fantasy Film"" Bible: ""It doesn't have to make sense, it just has to look cool."""
I:10;2442;Yes the effects were great, but it was really watching the characterization and story of this group of people on a terrifying island.
I:10;2443;now, I barely ever watch movies, but I can definitely recommend this one.
I:10;2444;The original movie is considered one of the top 100 American movies ever made and is still studied by film students and armchair directors to this day.
I:10;2445;I believe Peter Jackson knew this as he is also a big fan of the original.
I:10;2446;Purists like myself will always like the original best and I'll bet that Peter does too.
I:10;2447;jack Black was a perfect choice to play Carl Denham.
I:10;2448;the Skull Island natives were the best.
I:10;2449;I enjoyed the scenes of the natives killing the visitors, it reminded me so much of scenes from Peter's old movie Dead Alive.
I:10;2450;It is a style all his own.
I:10;2451;skull Island is also the best yet.
I:10;2452;in the original we loved how Kong put Ann in the tree and fought the single T. rex.
I:10;2453;Kong himself is an amazing special effects work in himself.
I:10;2454;The path of destruction he leaves whether in New York or Skull Island is a treat for everyone.
I:10;2455;He is my favorite director.
I:10;2456;All of a sudden Kong sees Ann and all is quiet.
I:10;2457;A vast scene of New York and the only living or moving things are Kong and Ann.
I:10;2458;Lovers of the original Kong will like it, obviously those who never bothered to watch old movies will think this movie is great and may not even know it's a remake, unless they think the 1976 was the original, and most importantly kids will enjoy it, because the bottom line is, this movie is fun.
I:10;2459;It's one of the great movies of all time.
I:10;2460;"A fantastic color remake of ""King Kong"" was released."
I:10;2461;It was a huge box office success with a great score by John Barry.
I:10;2462;loving young people of today?
I:10;2463;LOADED with CGI effects to please the computer and video game generation.
I:10;2464;A good example is when he flings her onto his right shoulder.
I:10;2465;I've never been so proud of my boy!Jackson returns to the adolescent indulgence of his early horror movies with the big.
I:10;2466;It more than holds up and outclasses this steaming heap by a mile.
I:10;2467;Peter Jackson, in my mind, surpassed his own paramount in LOTR with King Kong.
I:10;2468;This is one of the best films of 2005, if not the most rounded and complete.
I:10;2469;The story is not only a step up from the original, but it comically nods to the original, once again showing Jackson's love and respect for the 1933 version.
I:10;2470;So few remakes can capture the audience like the original, but Kong certainly comes close.
I:10;2471;What people saw in 1933 is probably comparable to this masterpiece that Jackson has created here.
I:10;2472;And not just Kong, which makes the CG Hulk look like a Looney Toon, but everything is so grandiose and marvelous that you can't help but become immersed in the environment.
I:10;2473;The climactic scene atop the Empire State Building is probably one of the most amazing scenes I have ever viewed on film.
I:10;2474;He is probably one of the best directors in the business right now, since he has the money to make the movies HE wants to make (not the ones WE want him to make.
I:10;2475;Truly, it is a masterpiece in the medium, and I pains me to read how viciously some people attack it, without taking the time to truly understand the message.
I:10;2476;But in Peter Jackson's case, King Kong is a spectacle that defies reality.
I:10;2477;well, he better do good.
I:10;2478;This remake of King Kong is an excellent motion picture.
I:10;2479;Leave it to the visionary director, Peter Jackson, to give the beloved, big ape emotional elements.
I:10;2480;along with the passionate interplay that would connect the movie with the viewer, there is plenty of breathtaking action to keep the audience entertained.
I:10;2481;Included are great fighting scenes between Kong and prehistoric creatures that exist on the island where he is discovered.
I:10;2482;Chase scenes are rather manic and are so well graphically choreographed that one can only recall the amazement and wonder of the enhanced DTS visual and sound effects brought forth by Stephen Spielberg when he presented to the world Jurassic Park twelve years ago.
I:10;2483;as you would expect from a big budget epic movie, the cinematography is great, and the acting is top.
I:10;2484;Mountainous landscapes are prevalent and the display of the New York City skyline circa early 1930's, especially when Kong is on top of the Empire State Building, is quite remarkable.
I:10;2485;the screenwriting for this adaptation is also excellent.
I:10;2486;all in all, Lord of the Rings was a difficult act to follow, I'm sure, but Peter Jackson has created yet another directorial triumph.
I:10;2487;notch cast, and the name, Peter Jackson, but there is plenty of substance in this classic remake/retelling, unlike some big.
I:10;2488;great picture great sound awesome remakedont care for jack black long and gets longerwith the extended cut drags on a little but still good
I:10;2489;Kong was a remarkable cinematic creation, a truly noble savage.
I:10;2490;sized earthworms and insects bigger than Buicks.
I:10;2491;"plus ""thrill ride,"" there wasn't enough time taken to slow down and really develop much of a Kong mystic."
I:10;2492;"kong was actually about the most convincing ""actor"" in the whole movie, but because Jackson got so carried away overpopulating Skull Island with other beasts, Kong was almost more of a supporting role rather than a lead."
I:10;2493;with their relatively tiny ship busted up on the rocks .
I:10;2494;did our heroes transport the Big Ape to the Big Apple?The climatic scene atop the Empire State building was remarkable, a great movie moment.
I:10;2495;King Kong was great in so many levels I was wanting to watch more and more.
I:10;2496;I was mesmerized at what Peter Jackson can really create when his mind is set on something.
I:10;2497;Great Movie to watch on Blu.
I:10;2498;but, it was still worth every penny to watch.
I:10;2499;Thus, I enjoy each viewing and my opinion of this movie has improved over time.
I:10;2500;There are many parts that were very well done and I feel it well worth the cost of having this version too.
I:10;2501;Yet plot is important too.
I:10;2502;He came across as a sincere, energetic movie director, but one who was likely to take too many chances with the safety of the people he worked with.
I:10;2503;spirited person, who just used people.
I:10;2504;I prefer the original Carl Denham.
I:10;2505;This character development was done just fine, and I sort of liked him at that point.
I:10;2506;In addition, he provides some laughs and did not take himself seriously either.
I:10;2507;He earned my respect and I felt he added to the plot.
I:10;2508;i liked the tramp steamer captain the most of all the characters .
I:10;2509;His role was very good.
I:10;2510;"He was consistent, for he maintained the ""ideal"" view of captain in my mind."
I:10;2511;Instead, he used this to help his crew consistently, and helped his passengers, Like Denham, who did not really deserve help.
I:10;2512;the Ann Darrow part was done very well too.
I:10;2513;This is due certainly to the excellent acting of Ann.
I:10;2514;up of this movie was fine.
I:10;2515;I enjoyed the ocean voyage, the expectancy of getting to Skull Island grew and developed well with me, but not as strongly as the original film.
I:10;2516;The original has this beat by far.
I:10;2517;The overall scenery was great and had more than the eye can take in with one viewing.
I:10;2518;In the original version of King Kong, I always wondered what would have happened if Kong met with one of these actual monsters.
I:10;2519;Something for the ages, to be remembered for all time.
I:10;2520;Kong made happy meals out of three .
I:10;2521;Yes, Kong has to live to end up in New York to finish this film.
I:10;2522;A fascinating, lost world to end all lost world stories.
I:10;2523;Whatever is the case, the movie now looks perfect, effects.
I:10;2524;worthy snapshot of a complex, dynamic time and place.
I:10;2525;"I will say that, overall, I think ""King Kong"" is a great movie, and while it doesn't quite approach the triumph of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I can't imagine anyone not at least mildly liking it as a whole while being very impressed with specific portions of it."
I:10;2526;"Academy Award Winning director Peter Jackson (Best Director, 'The Return of the King') follows up his award winning Lord of the Rings series with the big budget remake of the 1930's classic ""King Kong""."
I:10;2527;I've seen thousands of movies, but have somehow managed to never see King Kong.
I:10;2528;So, seeing this movie was my first King Kong experience.
I:10;2529;heads will crucify me for saying so, this movie's better than Jackson's Lord of the Rings series.
I:10;2530;the movie's special effects and art direction are absolutely amazing, they're beautiful to look at and at times a bit creepy.
I:10;2531;star cast is magnificent and then there's Kong, who's ten times better looking (as far effects go, I mean) than Gollum.
I:10;2532;jack Black plays Carl Denham, a movie producer who's film is about to be axed.
I:10;2533;Oscar winner Adrien Brody (Best Actor, 'The Pianist') plays Jack Driscoll, a playwright who's working on the final draft of the screenplay upon which Carl Denham's film will be based on.
I:10;2534;"Jack Black, is known for his comedic talent and while this is a ""dramatic"" film
I:10;2535;He plays Denham perfectly and can obviously do drama but still uses sarcasm and comedy for his dialouge.
I:10;2536;Adrien Brody is capable of being a good action hero and pulls off Jack Driscoll perfectly.
I:10;2537;Andy Serkis finds his way into the movie, both as the basis of Kongs facial expressions and as one of the ship's crew members.
I:10;2538;Anyway, this movie really is spectacular, no question.
I:10;2539;"One of the most entertaining and flat out great looking films of 2005, and at 3 hours and 8 minutes
I:10;2540;If you have never seen a version of King Kong, you may think this is a great movie (but I doubt it).
I:10;2541;There are good things here and there, of course.
I:10;2542;My family and I fast forwarded through a lot of the video and watched it in 1 hour.
I:10;2543;Technically it's a well done film, but so are the Star Wars movies.
I:10;2544;I felt like I got more than an action movie.
I:10;2545;On the surface this movie is just action, but it is also a period piece and a love story.
I:10;2546;the Great Depression in New York is vividly depicted in the opening sequence.
I:10;2547;This section of the movie shows the desperation that many people had during those difficult times, which draws you into the character of Anne Darrow.
I:10;2548;She is a struggling actress looking for a big break, and Carl Denham takes advantage of her by promising a wonderful new career in his movie.
I:10;2549;He urgently grabs everyone and everything he can to get his movie making passion on a ship bound for a mysterious place where he thinks his dreams will come true.
I:10;2550;She respects his work yet thinks he is just a conceited playwright, but she softens to his romantically interested advances.
I:10;2551;This version of Kong is very real despite his gargantuan size.
I:10;2552;It is easy to fall in love with Kong just as Anne Darrow does, and it becomes hard to hold your emotions back when Kong is captured, brought to the big city for man's entertainment, and eventually destroyed.
I:10;2553;Denham destroys everything he loves just as they said.
I:10;2554;I was impressed with the retelling of this tale with new twists and added character development.
I:10;2555;Peter Jackson is truly visionary with his risk of undertaking the recreation of the beloved King Kong.
I:10;2556;"The ""Kong"" character is so life."
I:10;2557;The new King Kong movie was very true to the 1930's movie.
I:10;2558;time favorite films clocked in at the over three.
I:10;2559;In fact, the best actor in the movie is the giant, computer.
I:10;2560;Now there was a director who knew how to tell a story, create suspense, and how much to show and to NOT show the viewer!
I:10;2561;I love this set as it gives more of the jungle search with added scenes of other confrontations with prehistoric beasts that weren't in the theatrical version.
I:10;2562;as for the new 2005 version, much of this film was so spectacular, that I find myself overlooking much of what I disliked about the film.
I:10;2563;and the scenes of Kong's return to New York where he ultimately suffers his fate on top of the Empire State Building were simply spectacular and emotionally charged.
I:10;2564;nonetheless, one must give credit where credit is due.
I:10;2565;This one's a big movie!
I:10;2566;Three hours and eight minutes of a very watchable version of King Kong.
I:10;2567;"Features Universal's ""U Control"" interactive content picture in picture and art gallery."
I:10;2568;a great cast does an axcellent job all around!
I:10;2569;Great special effects, although a couple of the scenes are too computery to captivate through subsequent viewings.
I:10;2570;"i highly recommend this film
I:10;2571;Great monster movie, great special effects and Naomi Watts is as good as Fay Wray, was in the original movie!
I:10;2572;Naomi Watts looks so beautiful in this movie .
I:10;2573;By the time it was over I loved her as much as Kong did.
I:10;2574;There are 2 scenes where she and Kong are mesmerized by the incredible beauty around them.
I:10;2575;"She tells Kong "" beautiful"" and she is trying to get his attention."
I:10;2576;Even Peter King's magical movie making can't top her smile.
I:10;2577;i saw this movie on the big screen and it was a thrilling spectacle from start to finish.
I:10;2578;The expressions on Kong's face will make you feel empathy for him.
I:10;2579;This movie is by far Peter Jackson's greatest.
I:10;2580;The theatrical version had many great moments.
I:10;2581;I am a great lover of film as both an art form and for just plain, fun entertainment.
I:10;2582;and it's sad when I see a film like this and know beyond a doubt I could create a substantially improved product using the available material.
I:10;2583;it seems it's not a factor on this title but I understand they will hit LOTR fans hard with it this year.
I:10;2584;King Kong: 8 out of 10: Peter Jackson's Kong is a long love letter to the original movie that surprisingly turns into that rarest of crowd pleasers.
I:10;2585;A movie that both men and their gals will like.
I:10;2586;Kong and Naomi Watts light up the screen with that most famous of dysfunctional cross species parings.
I:10;2587;the rest of the cast is also top notch with Jack Black playing an Orson Wells style director so well it is almost freighting.
I:10;2588;possible racial insensitivity aside Kong is far from perfect.
I:10;2589;All that said great action scary islanders and tragic romance make King Kong a winner.
I:10;2590;Peter Jackson is probably my second favorite director of all time, George Lucas is in first and Mel Gibson is in third.
I:10;2591;The first hour or so gives you the feeling of what is going on at the present time, and it takes you from the begining to Skull Island.
I:10;2592;The second hour is all that action on Skull Island, and by the time Kong is captured you will feel like the movie is over but there is still the final hour where Kong fights for his life running from the army and the air force, which is the third hour.
I:10;2593;It is year two of the Great Depression, and the opening scenes will really show you what is going on in such a simple way.
I:10;2594;I really like the first thing that you see, monkeys.
I:10;2595;"The opening music kind of adds some comedy to the situation, a song is playing called, ""I'm sitting on top of the world."""
I:10;2596;hour in, and the next half shows you more characters, and you travel for days.
I:10;2597;And for the next hour there is the wild goose chase, you get to see Kong's emotional side, especially in the amazing visuals on his face.
I:10;2598;You see him wrestle a whole family of V. rex's, yes V. rex's, not T, but V. I find that almost every creature on Skull Island is an enhanced version of the ones we see every day.
I:10;2599;There is a good amount of comedy on every part of the film too.
I:10;2600;And once agian because of the fantastic visuals you can really see how much pain Kong goes through.
I:10;2601;Peter Jackson has created such a masterpiece, that you will love this film from start to finish, this version I hope is better than the first version.
I:10;2602;amazingly well done again by p. jackson.
I:10;2603;just like what the heroine said to king kong: 'you are beautiful.'
I:10;2604;yes, king kong is more human than a republican, that's for sure :.)
I:10;2605;I'm glad I did, because it was an incredible spectacle.
I:10;2606;I thought the scenes where they arrived at Skull Island were incredible, realistic and scary.
I:10;2607;It was a smidge long, but I found it enjoyable.
I:10;2608;But when the movie came out, it was hailed as an instant classic, the best movie of the year, and possibly the best movie of the 2000's.
I:10;2609;(Jackson works in three's, remember).
I:10;2610;Instead, Jackson draws out absolutely everything.
I:10;2611;the second hour is the crowning achievement.
I:10;2612;Brontosaurases, Raptors, T. rexes, and Bugs to boot abound in the fantastic island all so detailed that it harrows up rememberance of Jackson's greatness showcased in the greatest Trilogy of all.
I:10;2613;the fundamental dichotomy between a fantasy island and 1930's New York City is a lot of what kills the fun of the movie.
I:10;2614;I understand that NYC has to be realistic and it is.
I:10;2615;But Jackson excels when he shows his audience a world that doesn't exist.
I:10;2616;I understand that it's apples and oranges, but it had the POTENTIAL to be a great movie.
I:10;2617;I had never seen a movie get such high praise and great reviews.
I:10;2618;I had such high anticipation.
I:10;2619;It takes over an hour to get to Skull Island and along the way we are introduced to a lot of people we didn't need to meet.
I:10;2620;I was really excited when I first saw the preview for this movie.
I:10;2621;I love King Kong and adore Peter Jackson.
I:10;2622;This movie is the perfect example of how great effects do not make great movies.
I:10;2623;It was completely over the top.
I:10;2624;I did enjoy the sequences with Kong and Ann (minus most of the T. rex attack), and New York at the end was OK.
I:10;2625;I wouldn't bother to see it again and will never recommend it to anyone.
I:10;2626;Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody were also wonderful.
I:10;2627;my god!one of the best movie i have seen in the recent times.
I:10;2628;simply wonderful,along with the computer graphics,special effects,peter jackson has recreated the wonderful era.
I:10;2629;I was simply so impressed with King Kong that I felt the need to throw my two cents in.
I:10;2630;I felt the connection this gigantic beast had with her even though she was human and he was this big strong animal as they became instant friends who shared naps and laughs.
I:10;2631;It was very touching watching their friendship develop as a rescue team from the ship had to battle giant bugs, beetles, spiders, dinosaurs and savages to bring her back to safety.
I:10;2632;i admit, I cried a bit a few times, but I'm a huge sucker for animals and this movie had some sweet tender moments.
I:10;2633;His had this strong bond with this woman who had no one to love her and she made him laugh by dancing for him and for bringing this sweet look into his eyes.
I:10;2634;He was more than a killer, he was this sudden soft creature that found her beautiful.
I:10;2635;I swear I saw his brain working behind all the looks he gave her, and the move did a stupendous job of making him real.
I:10;2636;this movie is a real feast on the eyes as the tight escapes, especially when the crew men had to run from the brachiosauruses and velociraptors on the mountain slopes, I couldn't even believe what I was seeing!
I:10;2637;"I kept saying to my boyfriend ""Can you believe this??"
I:10;2638;"Its insane, this movie is crazy!"""
I:10;2639;truly a spectacular, yet bit sad but powerful story.
I:10;2640;King Kong won me over, as this sweet loving giant, who kept reminding us that love and compassion come in all forms.
I:10;2641;length flick, I very hesitantly went to see this film.Yet, I really was pleasantly suprised and genuinely glad that I saw it on the big screen.
I:10;2642;The story is handled with deft sincerity, the visuals are spectacular and although long, the work is finely paced so that it never feels drawn out.
I:10;2643;in particular, Kong is truly wonderful.
I:10;2644;His emotions are clearly verbalised through his facial movements, his relationship with Anne is beautifully tender and the fight scenes are absolutely gripping.
I:10;2645;Andy Circus has done an excellent job with Jackson's Kong, and it is he who steals the limelight.
I:10;2646;regardless, suprisingly worthwhile for such a mainstream piece.
I:10;2647;The last remake was more entertaining!
I:10;2648;jack black, naomi watts, and adrien brody are all wonderful in the film, and i wouldn't be surprised if naomi watts were to be nominated for an academy award this year.
I:10;2649;this movie has action, romance, and tragedy and is truly one of the best films of the year!
I:10;2650;The result is one of the most awe inspiring films of all time.
I:10;2651;It's seriously hard to describe the scope of a film like this version of King Kong.
I:10;2652;Carl Denham, an eccentric filmmaker, is about to be finished because his producers are fed up with his recent flops.
I:10;2653;He decides that he's going to make a grand epic by exploring the uncharted and mythical Skull Island.
I:10;2654;Jackson creates the perfect atmosphere of an America during the depression and we get this sense of desperation on both Denham's and Ann's part.
I:10;2655;It's absolutely wonderous, and the scale is just immense.
I:10;2656;The brontosaurus stampede through the canyon is incredible.
I:10;2657;The visual effects are amazing in the film, and Jackson seamlessly blends visuals with sets to make it work.
I:10;2658;The sequence is breathtaking, and you will watch with your jaw dropped as these giant beasts fight to the death.
I:10;2659;The greatest thing about this version is the emotion, the connection between Kong and Ann that was hard to absorb from the original.
I:10;2660;We see a connection of two souls, a lonely beast who is the last of his kind, and a women who has been thrown out on the street.
I:10;2661;It's a love for one another's presence and Jackson handled that with expertise.
I:10;2662;the film has a shift in tone once we leave Skull Island, and Kong is captured and brought back to New York.
I:10;2663;Once Kong escapes and rampages through New York City looking for Ann we start an emotional ride all the way to the end.
I:10;2664;After a poignant scene at the top there is the shot of the biplanes coming in from behind the building and it sends unnerving chills down your spine.
I:10;2665;The film's climax is stunning, one of the grandest most iconic scenes of cinematic history recreated through the mind of a master.
I:10;2666;James Newton Howard's score adds an emotional boost to Peter Jackson's poignant and epic vision.
I:10;2667;The movie is more than a visual effects romp, it is a truly beautiful story expressed in such a way that it will leave a grand mark on you as a movie goer.
I:10;2668;This new version has 13 minutes of restored footage, mostly stuff that is a homage to the original like the underwater escape off of the rafts.
I:10;2669;His reaction, as he stands in the auditorium after Kong escapes into the city, sends a message that this character has basically brought upon is own demise.
I:10;2670;Naomi Watts plays her role mostly through screaming and through facial expressions, and she does a fantastic job interacting with a character who was digitally added in later.
I:10;2671;His facial expressions and body movements give Kong a human presence, and it helps with the emotional connection of the two characters.
I:10;2672;vIDEO: King Kong looks absolutely stunning.
I:10;2673;King Kong is a film with some sort of special effect in nearly every shot, so this transfer needs to look great.
I:10;2674;Color tones are right on the money, black levels are handled well, and the picture is overall incredibly sharp.
I:10;2675;Simply, the sound is explosive and dynamic.
I:10;2676;The canyon stampede is probably the best sounding scene in the film.
I:10;2677;Don't dwell on the fact that there is no DTS, the Dolby track is very impressive.
I:10;2678;The first thing you'll find is the great commentary by Peter Jackson, which is incredibly informative and on par with the Lord Of The Rings commentaries.
I:10;2679;It's pretty long and incredibly funny, and it just shows that Jack Black is funny no matter where he is.
I:10;2680;On disc 1 there is also a hidden featurette that is extremely funny, it's not hard to find at all.
I:10;2681;Moving on to disc 2 we have the incredible making of documentary.
I:10;2682;There is some really interesting stuff here, and all film students or film buffs need to watch it.
I:10;2683;There is also a featurette on recreating Skull Island and how the filmmakers wanted it to make it look like the same Skull Island from the original version.
I:10;2684;An amazing supplement of features is topped off with three trailers.
I:10;2685;When our generation watches the original King Kong we see a clay gorilla walking on miniature sets.
I:10;2686;When Peter Jackson watches the original King Kong he sees everything that we see in his film today.
I:10;2687;Every filmmaker has their one source of inspiration, and King Kong was his.
I:10;2688;I'm glad he shared it with us.
I:10;2689;We go to the theater for films like this and even though it is the second remake of this story, Peter Jackson has brought this film a new life and made it his film.
I:10;2690;It is truly a wonderful, exciting, heartfelt, and touching homage made for modern times.
I:10;2691;This is a masterpiece of the cinema.
I:10;2692;I found the casting perfect, including Jack Black.
I:10;2693;"The ""relationship"" Ann Darrow has to have with the ape is touching, as much as it can be."
I:10;2694;She is, afterall, totally dependent on him for survival.
I:10;2695;I won't give a synopsis of the story because everyone knows it and I don't understand why people do that on here and on IMDB but this is a must see for movie lovers.
I:10;2696;I love everything about this movie!
I:10;2697;It's visually amazing on Blu Ray.
I:10;2698;Naomi Watts is beautiful and Jack Black is hilarious.
I:10;2699;The spider pit sequence is also a bit lengthened with some more lines by Jack Black.
I:10;2700;i enjoyed the extended cut, but I don't know that this lengthy movie is better served with added material.
I:10;2701;I got this movie for my 4 year old son who is obsessed with dinosaurs,, and when he found out that there were t. rex's in this movie he wanted to see it.
I:10;2702;It really is an interesting movie, it held my attention too.
I:10;2703;I would recommend seeing it
I:10;2704;I came into this movie with high hopes.
I:10;2705;It had some good parts.
I:10;2706;I liked the dinosaur scenes.
I:10;2707;"I really liked the character ""Jack""."
I:10;2708;"Jack Black was perfect for the role of ""Carl""."
I:10;2709;Maybe it will be better on the smaller screen.
I:10;2710;King Kong is not the best overall movie ever made, but it is the best of it's kind in the last 12 years or so.
I:10;2711;"Not since the origninal ""Jurassic Park"" has a creature feature been so exhilarating, enthralling, and just plan fun."
I:10;2712;"the ""Lord of the Rings"" films have established Peter Jackson as one of the best genre talents in the business."
I:10;2713;I believe that it is his love and respect for the material that elevates him over most other genre filmakers.
I:10;2714;That inspiration is evident in this gloriously over.
I:10;2715;top yet emotionally grounded update.
I:10;2716;in doing the update, Jackson and his crew execute some very interesting character shifts while keeping fairly close to the original narrative.
I:10;2717;It's a neat way of paying tribute to a classic while at the same time giving modern audiences something new other than updated visuals to chew on.
I:10;2718;"In the '33 version, Robert Armstrong played Denham like the ""Great White Hunter"" only with a movie camera instead of a gun."
I:10;2719;For my money, Jack Black hit this one out of the park.
I:10;2720;naomi Watts is wonderful as well.
I:10;2721;That decision allows for Ann to bond with Kong in a believable way: their kinship is born of the simple fact that they are the only two creatures on Skull Island who are not trying to kill and eat each other.
I:10;2722;jokes and references to the first film are an unexpected delight, the visuals are eye.
I:10;2723;popping, the pacing is excellent, the performances pitch perfect, including a tour.
I:10;2724;Spiritually faithful to the original, Jackson has done an absolutely amazing job here, contrary to what is said by those who just have to contrary.
I:10;2725;Though we have become accustomed to CGI SFX, the finale on the empire state building is absolutely incredible, and must be seen to be believed.
I:10;2726;This film makes Kong so lifelike you'd swear he was real.
I:10;2727;"With scenes worthy and reminiscent of ""Jurassic Park"" and action similiar to an ""Indiana Jones"" movie wrapped up in amazing sets and costumes it's one you'll want to see more than once and share with your friends."
I:10;2728;"The strange ""love story"" endures better than ever as the classic technology vs. nature theme unfolds."
I:10;2729;This is a great movie to have.
I:10;2730;I could certainly see the love that Peter Jackson has for the original film, reflected in his absolutely amazing version.
I:10;2731;We get a great deal of backstory on the characters, and the first third of this film really delivers on character development.
I:10;2732;Once we see Kong, the film kicks into high gear with some of the most insane (in a good way) action sequences ever conceived.
I:10;2733;Jackson, and his team, deliver the special effects like you've never seen, yet, they are secondary to the story.
I:10;2734;finally, the film moves into New York, where the bond between Kong and Darrow becomes an intense sequence, leading into the best climax I've seen in a film, for quite some time.
I:10;2735;I've enjoyed this film several times since bringing it home, and the bonus features are very interesting, and informative.
I:10;2736;pick this one up, and enjoy one the greatest films ever created.
I:10;2737;much in the tradition of the 1930's and 1970's versions,the film covers an eager filmmaker named Carl Denham looking for a girl to play a role in his latest movie.
I:10;2738;soon,Carl,his friend Jack,and others cover ground on the island looking for her.
I:10;2739;iT IS ART!Setting the movie in the 1930's, like Merian C. Cooper's original, was the right choice, it allows for an instant homage, it creates amazing costuming opportunities (like any period piece) and hedges bets on the story.
I:10;2740;making, generating the awe in film audiences I imagine they experience upon seeing Kong in 1933.
I:10;2741;time Oscar winning partner Walsh and their LOTR co. writer, Academy Award winner Boyens.
I:10;2742;set performance reference and motion capture performance for the title character of King Kong.
I:10;2743;"Serkis' very ""HUMAN"" range of facial expressions are brilliantly matched by the digital talents of the CGI team (I hope they both get Oscars)."
I:10;2744;maker Carl Denham, along with Adrien Brody as the heroic Jack Driscoll.
I:10;2745;James Newton Howard (Batman Begins) composed the dynamic, original score for the film.
I:10;2746;reel giant ape, there's action, adventure, dinosaurs, and a strange, love.
I:10;2747;He choose King Kong, because, like Lord of the Rings, it was something he wanted to do, something that meant something to him.
I:10;2748;"Oh, how I wanted her elderly stage friend, ""Manny,"" to come back at the end to shake her hand."
I:10;2749;He is among the best and most arresting actors in the world, good for Jackson for reeling him into the world of KING KONG!
I:10;2750;King Kong is a good film.
I:10;2751;It's one of the better movies to come out in the past year.
I:10;2752;It is full of action, romance, and comedy.
I:10;2753;It has a solid cast and a nice musical score.
I:10;2754;The special effects are very good and the writing keeps the bulk of the story moving at a rather swift pace.
I:10;2755;The beginning of the film, including the introduction of the primary players and the trip to Skull Island, definitely would have benefited from a little more editing.
I:10;2756;The stampede scene does seem a bit overdone, but it is very fun to watch.
I:10;2757;The battle between Kong and the T. rexes also seems to suffer a bit from overkill, but it's put together so well that it's enjoyable to watch on the screen.
I:10;2758;naomi Watts, Jack Black, and Adrien Brody are all good in this film, but let's face it, Kong is the star.
I:10;2759;The CGI gorilla with a big heart is quite impressive on the screen, and his emotions flow smoothly and quickly from anger to hate to sadness and even fear.
I:10;2760;The ending is rather moving, but Black's Denham character sort of weakens it.
I:10;2761;in short, this is a very good action/adventure/romance in the old cliffhanger vein of the 30's and 40's.
I:10;2762;It's also very obvious that Peter Jackson loved this film very much and put a lot into its development.
I:10;2763;recommended to fans of popcorn adventure and, of course, Peter Jackson.
I:10;2764;"Just don't expect a tale as wonderful as the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy."
I:10;2765;This film is sufficient, but don't let people carry you away with talk of awards.
I:10;2766;Just know that if you like gorillas tearing up the jungle and a sizeable chunk of New York, you'll enjoy this film.
I:10;2767;"When the rocks appear, the captain orders ""stop engines"", and the boat of course continues forward for another 10 seconds and crashes into the rocks, starting another extended special effects scene."
I:10;2768;I can accept fictional ideas.
I:10;2769;minute long extended special effect.
I:10;2770;In the new King Kong, Jackson's interpretation initially flares out through the extravagant special effects, but as the three hours of adventure has reached its culmination the audience will find themselves emotionally fatigued through an intensely poignant drama.
I:10;2771;She takes the part, as her favorite stage writer has written the piece they are about to shoot.
I:10;2772;The deceptive plan of Carl succeeds, as he gets everyone he needs out to sea including the writer Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) that Ann admires.
I:10;2773;It is here Jackson truly begins to develop the story after the character introduction in New York before they set their course for Skull Island.
I:10;2774;The story builds heavily on emotions with a strong emphasis on love, obsession, and fear.
I:10;2775;The most basic emotion emerges within them all .
I:10;2776;The men on the ship set out on a rescue expedition to discover that some secrets are best unknown, as the most primal of instincts emerges within them all .
I:10;2777;king Kong displays an extraordinary adventure with remarkable visuals that effectively applies computer.
I:10;2778;These visuals are only the icing on the cake, as the audience begins to cut into the cake they will expose multiple layers that provide a genuine depiction of the primal origin of emotions.
I:10;2779;Thus, within this highly engaging epic adventure, the viewer will find himself or herself stumbling into a poignantly expressive tale of unconditional and fearless love resting within all creatures hiding beneath the primal rage protecting the being.
I:10;2780;I love this movies very nice and interest.
I:10;2781;I recommend this for everyone to see.
I:10;2782;I actually enjoyed the usually obnoxious Jack Black as Carl Denim and Adrien Brody looks like he belongs in the 1930's.
I:10;2783;I loved the 30's look of the movie and the old New York flavor.
I:10;2784;foot tall ape called Kong.
I:10;2785;"The movie was also too long, but action fans will enjoy it
I:10;2786;"My favorite part of the movie was showing New York in the throes of the Depression
I:10;2787;I give the movie four stars for the astounding special effects.
I:10;2788;Let me first say that I love this movie and the original.
I:10;2789;When I was a kid I saw the original on TV and loved the T. rex fight just like every other kid.
I:10;2790;for those of you who don't know King Kong is about a film director, named Carl Denham who is trying to be a successful movie director during the great depression.
I:10;2791;When your using a movie that's been used over twice already, you have to come up with new stuff and new ideas.
I:10;2792;Yes, some of the subplots go no where, but many are important and interesting.
I:10;2793;the Acting was quite good in this movie too.
I:10;2794;Naomi Watts did a great job as a beautiful Ann Darrow.
I:10;2795;Jack Black made a good kind of smart mouthed Carl Denham.
I:10;2796;Even the Skull Islanders themselves were great and quite scary looking.
I:10;2797;experience with writing those kinds of scenes.
I:10;2798;overall I do enjoy watching this movie.
I:10;2799;Like I said before I have seen it many times and enjoy it every time.
I:10;2800;This is one of the movies that sparked my great interest in movies, whether it's collecting them, watching them, reviewing them, or making them.
I:10;2801;If you are looking for a good CGI packed thrill ride this is for you!
I:10;2802;The pole vaulting scenes were very cool.
I:10;2803;"The directing by Peter Jackson is brilliant and one of his best films since ""The Lord Of The Rings"" series and outside of ""The Lord Of The Rings"" series!"
I:10;2804;One of the best films of the year!
I:10;2805;"Most of the crew that Jackson worked with for ""The Lord Of The Rings"" series returns, as well."
I:10;2806;The screenplay by Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Phillippa Boyens (based on the story by Merian C. Cooper and Edgar Wallace) is brilliant!
I:10;2807;Naomi Watts (Ann Darrow), Jack Black (Carl Denham), and Adrian Brody (Jack Driscoll) lead an impressive cast in this very impressive film!
I:10;2808;Andy Serkis brings Kong impressively to life (he also plays Lumpy the Cook)!
I:10;2809;The music by James Newton Howard is impressive and brilliant!
I:10;2810;The cinematography by Andrew Lesnie is impressively brilliant!
I:10;2811;The film editing by Jamie Selkirk is excellent!
I:10;2812;The casting by Victoria Burrows, Daniel Hubbard, John Hubbard, and Liz Mullane is excellent!
I:10;2813;The production design by Grant Major is brilliantly impressive!
I:10;2814;The art direction by Simon Bright and Dan Hennah is brilliant and very impressive!
I:10;2815;The set decoration by Dan Hennah is impressive and very brilliant!
I:10;2816;The costume design by Terry Ryan is very brilliant!
I:10;2817;up effects are very impressive!
I:10;2818;winning visual effects by WETA Digital are very brilliant and very impressive!
I:10;2819;This is going to be an impressive Oscar contender for next year!
I:10;2820;"Jackson has impressively remade ""King Kong"" (2005) with style and poise!"
I:10;2821;This is one of the finest films of the year!
I:10;2822;Also won Oscars for Best Sound and Sound Editing.
I:10;2823;I saw this movie eight times when it was in theaters and each time i loved it.
I:10;2824;tied about this movie and how much i enjoyed it.
I:10;2825;Batman Begins was good, War of the Worlds was impressive, Revenge of the Sith packed in the audiences but not the excitement, and in movie world it's been a fairly duff year as far as continuing 're.
I:10;2826;The computer effects are incredible, and Adrian Brody and Naomi Watts are good.
I:10;2827;And any film with dinosaurs in it gains another star.
I:10;2828;Regardless, it's great entertainment for the easliy.
I:10;2829;A technically amazing adventure but actor.
I:10;2830;star action movie, watch it and be blown away, but for something more cerebral, check out Kiwi Roger Donaldson's excellent 'World's Fastest Indian'.
I:10;2831;I give it 3 stars because it is still worth seeing because of the action.
I:10;2832;some stunning visual moments, but in the end I didn't care as I was bored stiff an hour in and realizing more than two were left.
I:10;2833;peter jackson has out done himself with this movie everything is a joy to watch .
I:10;2834;other then that pure joy naomi watts and jack black are great and the casting of rapper 50 cent as king kong pure genius.
I:10;2835;very long movie and takes a long time to develop but once it does it keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:10;2836;A great film makes you care for the characters.
I:10;2837;An amazing film sticks in your head, you remember lines from it and can't wait to see it again.
I:10;2838;Is King Kong an amazing film?
I:10;2839;I don't know, BUT I do know that King Kong is a great film.
I:10;2840;Jack Black is great as Carl Denham, Adrien Brody is solid, and Naomi Watts steals the show.
I:10;2841;one of the things I love about this movie is the epicness, absoulute vastness of it all.
I:10;2842;King Kong is a great big adventure movie and I believe there are far too few movies that can capture your imagination and make your eyes tear up, or make you gasp in awe at the shots.
I:10;2843;King Kong is an amazing film.
I:10;2844;Its the type of movie that doesn't come along often, a film that makes you laugh, smile, cry, and applaud at the end of it, and that, that is what filmmaking is all about.
I:10;2845;We had such high expectations after the Lord of the Rings.
I:10;2846;i would love to give Peter all the credit but he has a bunch of really great workers.
I:10;2847;I would love to thank them all.
I:10;2848;Our grandsons love the old version and I had no idea within the first five min.
I:10;2849;it was strong language like GD .
I:10;2850;This movie to me was amazing, when I saw it at the theater, I knew I had to have it in my collection,it seems each time I watched it, I noticed more detail, that I didn't see before for some reason.
I:10;2851;turly an amazing film 10 thumbs up to Peter Jackson
I:10;2852;By the time (almost an hour) you get to the ape who gives a !
I:10;2853;Made me view the 1976 version as a masterpiece!
I:10;2854;This was an entertaining movie, a lot of typical Holloywood stuff.
I:10;2855;Good acting and cgi, but the story had to many huh?s and in some scenes, I had a feeling that there must have been something cut out.
I:10;2856;I like Peter Jackson's movies beacuse he's a great director and movies Look Great.
I:10;2857;with kong,its a fantasy movie with humans.
I:10;2858;set in a time i can relate to,sort of.
I:10;2859;the dino stampede with the wee humans,ann's impersonation of a ragdoll yet unbruised and very much in love,brody being the love interest 2nd in line(how did he even make the line in the first place?!?!?)
I:10;2860;what a place for humor,pete!!!!)
I:10;2861;The acting was great and I was amazed at how realistic the computer animation was in creating King Kong and other creatures on Skull Island.
I:10;2862;But then during the mostly silent final scenes when beauty and the beast are reunited I was totally absorbed.
I:10;2863;"okay, the 1933 version of ""King Kong"" is a certifiable classic and director Peter Jackson gets to do a remake because after ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy he has carte blanche for the foreseeable future (compare with whatever happened to James Cameron)."
I:10;2864;Everybody knows the basic story and obviously the computer generated effects that Jackson has at his disposal are a marked improvement over the stop motion animation of Willis H. O'Brien.
I:10;2865;The question is whether the story will be as touching, and that is going to depend more of how Jackson tells the story and how Naomi Watts responds to the Kong that she has to imagine in her mind's eye.
I:10;2866;The final test for this film is quite simple: are there tears in your eyes at the end?
I:10;2867;There are other changes as well, the most notable of which is that Jack Black's Carl Denham is more opportunist than adventurer.
I:10;2868;Watts' big scream is pretty good, but it was the elevation in terror that made Wray as important to the original as the special effects with Kong.
I:10;2869;jackson has included some nice homages to the original in his film.
I:10;2870;Rick Baker, the master of make up who played Kong in that ape suit in the 1976 version, is one of the pilots, Jackson is a tail gunner, and if you check out the end credits you will find some other familiar names, even if you do not recognize the faces.
I:10;2871;Jackson wanted Fay Wray to be in the film and to deliver the famous final line.
I:10;2872;That would certainly have been a lot more than a mere homage and would have qualified as one of the great movie cameos of all time.
I:10;2873;For me it is the only director who has a deep insight of the films he directs.
I:10;2874;The 2005 version of King Kong started out great, with a good flavor of New York during the depression.
I:10;2875;so this new version shows a relationship between Ann and Kong.
I:10;2876;Peter Jackson's King Kong is a potentially great movie undone by excess.
I:10;2877;Set design, special effects, acting, and overall 'atmosphere' are great.
I:10;2878;There are scenes with real power like the one atop the Empire State Building and in Central Park.
I:10;2879;For Classic movie remakes like King Kong, I am happy that the story line is unwaivering from its original.
I:10;2880;however, the acting is good and the computer animated scenes are convincing.
I:10;2881;I am a big King Kong fan since the original with Fay Wray.
I:10;2882;"I've even made a point of catching reruns of ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" (King Kong wins by the way)."
I:10;2883;A surprisingly good remake of the classic 1933 film, Peter Jackson's King Kong, provides another take on the big ape that we all know so well by now.
I:10;2884;naomi Watts (who at times brings to mind Nicole Kidman), Jack Black, Adrien Brody, Andy Serkis, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!
I:10;2885;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING!)
I:10;2886;Product came in timely manner and in good condition.
I:10;2887;King Kong was a good movie the special effects were a little better than I thought they would be but not as good as War of the Worlds (best F/X ever).
I:10;2888;It is a really fun movie and at some points touching.
I:10;2889;She asked me what I thought, and after I thought I came up with these points, both right and wrong.
I:10;2890;I really enjoyed hanging out in 1930's New York and getting to know the characters.
I:10;2891;This is going to be a deep and thoughtful treatment of the King Kong story I thought.
I:10;2892;I also thoroughly enjoyed Kong's final minutes climing up the Empire State building and his valiant but futile effort to fight off the fighter planes.
I:10;2893;The beginning of the end: So, Kong is finally overcome by chloroform and all of a sudden he's on Broadway!
I:10;2894;I really wanted to see that!
I:10;2895;so, this was a movie that was entertaining for both the right and wrong reasons.
I:10;2896;Plus this is a movie which shows how important an editor's job is to the overall movie process.
I:10;2897;It's funny, when one would think that the more time spent with a character, the better you get to know them, but after the 3 hrs the only character I truly cared about was the giant monkey, and he went and died at the end, which pretty much sums up what the movie did as well.
I:10;2898;Brilliantly done, it felt as if you were truly there.
I:10;2899;The settings were also lovely, and the costumes relating to the time period was gorgeous.
I:10;2900;the movie was good it just had to many moments of over the top stuff.
I:10;2901;the cgi on king kong himself is very good i must say.
I:10;2902;King Kong did look cool and a little sense of sadness with his face expression and everything.
I:10;2903;The clarity and clearness of the picture.
I:10;2904;The color of the pictures so alive!
I:10;2905;Uhm, another wow is the Actors.
I:10;2906;King Kong proves to be a highly entertaining movie that should make almost anyone who loves movies to sit down and watch it.
I:10;2907;centered and without honor as well.
I:10;2908;skull Island part is the heart and soul of the film.
I:10;2909;We should praised Peter Jackson highly here since he actually created a real romance story between the blonde and her big ape.
I:10;2910;The special effects were wonderful and the entire part was highly exciting but what made it work was Naomi Watts' skills as an actress and how well she interacted with what basically was, a computer generated creature play acted by Andy Serkis who once more did a superb job.
I:10;2911;In some funny way, this entire Skull Island part proves to be one giant romance sequence with other humans and prehistoric monsters getting in the way.
I:10;2912;As a director, Jackson did a superb job getting to that part to make Naomi Watts' conversion very realistic.
I:10;2913;This sense of empathy and compassion that she had for her one time captor seem to be the core of the movie and what make this movie work so well as not only as action adventure movie but in real sense, a love story between the beauty and the beast.
I:10;2914;the fact that Peter Jackson was able to create this creditable emotional appeal from a computer generated creature remains a testament to his skill as a storyteller.
I:10;2915;The move come highly recommended.
I:10;2916;i prefer full screen movies.
I:10;2917;Peter Jackson is a master.
I:10;2918;He kept the original feel, the mystery of the unknown in the 1930s, and updated it successfully.
I:10;2919;In its own way, it's a love story.
I:10;2920;NOTHING else out there looks and sounds quite as good!
I:10;2921;dropping picture that is rich and detailed.
I:10;2922;The sound field is completely immersieve with the biplane fight especially good.
I:10;2923;I personally love the movie because they took the original and improved upon it in every mannor possible.
I:10;2924;Plus, with today's graphical abilities it is a spectacular looking film.
I:10;2925;I rank it right up there with the original 1930s version.
I:10;2926;Should definately become a classic!
I:10;2927;Great work for all who where involved in it's production!
I:10;2928;He got away with it in the first two LORD OF THE RINGS films because Tolkien's story and characters were so powerful.
I:10;2929;The question is, who has the talent to imagine something fresh and new?
I:10;2930;an interpretation of beauty and the beast.
I:10;2931;Then I thought to myself that Jackson could create a new vision with the help of the wizards of WETA, and since he wanted to set the story back to the New York of 1933, I couldn't help myself but wonder.
I:10;2932;hour length, Peter Jackson presents his view on Kong beyond my expectations.
I:10;2933;All the characters are interesting and well.
I:10;2934;depicted: Naomi Watts' performance as Ann Darrow is fantastic, showing frailty, charm, and strength .
I:10;2935;Adrien Brody is nice as playwright Jack Driscoll.
I:10;2936;Jack Black surprisingly demonstrates that he can be more than a comedian, he can be a great actor when he wants it and be on the same level as Bill Murray or Robin Williams.
I:10;2937;The magicians at WETA's use of Andy Serkis for Kong's movements is astonishing.
I:10;2938;You can be happy when Kong is happy, specially in that Central Park scene.
I:10;2939;Everything in here is indeed marvelous.
I:10;2940;"once again, I dare say that ""King Kong"" is a masterpiece of its own."
I:10;2941;A great homage to the 1933 original.
I:10;2942;This film proves that Peter Jackson may become the George Lucas of the 21st century.
I:10;2943;"It pretty much stuck to the ""original"" King Kong storyline!"
I:10;2944;A touching beautiful story about a lonely ape and how a woman can survive by using her vaudeville talents and passion to escape his jungle.
I:10;2945;But I still have 2 more grandkids, younger, and will probably watch it again in a few years!!!
I:10;2946;The King Kong is a classic story.
I:10;2947;The actors and the plot of the story are good.
I:10;2948;Definetely one of the best movies of our time.
I:10;2949;I'm a huge effects movie fan.
I:10;2950;I felt this was a faithful tribute to the original movie.
I:10;2951;Yes, the ape is terrific.
I:10;2952;In fact, Kong delivers the best performance in the film.
I:10;2953;"directed frame of ""King Kong"" screams of artifice, dramatically, technically and stylistically."
I:10;2954;based special effects shop, it's pretty spectacular.
I:10;2955;But as a film, it's a demo reel for a special effects shop.
I:10;2956;imaging of the classic film.
I:10;2957;ray films that I bought for viewing on my player at home, and I was not dissappointed.
I:10;2958;Dinosaurs, giant bugs, chase schenes (you get to watch Jack Black run, which is worth $10 by itself), and the film looks great in Blue.
I:10;2959;love it or hate it, this movie is well shot and a visually appealing work.
I:10;2960;I am a huge LOTR fan, and I found that this movie has loads of scenes that capture the same kind of epic, wide.
I:10;2961;angle outdoor scenes that can be really enjoyed even if you mute the TV and just enjoy the visuals even without the distraction of the sound.
I:10;2962;Best movie of the year, easily hands down.
I:10;2963;kong is so realistic and likeable, you just hate to see him die at the end.
I:10;2964;Enabling the next or same director to explore Skull Island and Kong's background that much more.
I:10;2965;Better picture and clarity than the big screen movie houses.
I:10;2966;I also bouth the production diares great investment.
I:10;2967;Simple awesome a master piece for al collectors.
I:10;2968;I have to admit that despite the other lukewarm reviews here, that I really liked this film.
I:10;2969;This is the sort of movie I go to to basically veg out, enjoy the action and special effects, and forget the real world for a while.
I:10;2970;artistically serious as well as non.
I:10;2971;loving action films that admittedly might not be much more than special effects romps.
I:10;2972;But they're still the most enjoyable sort of mindless, movie going fun.
I:10;2973;"If I want the other sort, I can always watch ""Citizen Kane"" and boost my movie I. q. a few points that way."
I:10;2974;But although the film has a long ramp up to where the action finally starts, I can tell you that the rest is worth waiting for.
I:10;2975;inspiring and that's just one of several great action scenes.
I:10;2976;Once I saw that, I was hooked and was on the edge of my seat for the rest of the movie.
I:10;2977;I'm not savvy enough about the genre to really say, but I'll put this movie up there with the best of them.
I:10;2978;And finally, Jack Black turns in possibly his best performance ever and Naomi Watts, who I recently saw in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, where she was great, turns in another fine performance here.
I:10;2979;Jackson has another winner here and I think the movie is one of the best of the year.
I:10;2980;I wanted so much to like Peter Jackson's vision of King Kong.
I:10;2981;After all, his Lord of the Rings films were staggeringly good, especially in the extended editions.
I:10;2982;It's a rare director who can make a film that holds you to your seat for three to four hours.
I:10;2983;The longer, the better, I thought.
I:10;2984;"top looks of longing
I:10;2985;"casting stereotype from the 1920's
I:10;2986;Come on!Jackson can and now must do better than this.
I:10;2987;For the amazing special effects, which is Peter Jackson's forte, I give it an A+.
I:10;2988;For the long, silent, emotive looks from Naomi Watts, I give it a B.
I:10;2989;But for the ridiculous last line of Jack Black (as well as his bad acting), I give it an F. Average that together, and you get a solid C grade.
I:10;2990;I finally got to see KK this weekend.
I:10;2991;It seems to focus a lot on certain characters (Jack Black's, for instance) at some point, then removes the focus, then brings it back.
I:10;2992;jurassic Park kind of fashion.
I:10;2993;this was a great moviea great castalot of actiona great movie the whole family would enjoy
I:10;2994;Great storyline, king kong was so lifelike and it has one of my favorite Actors.
I:10;2995;I really enjoyed the added action parts in this movie and the whole movie in general.
I:10;2996;"put those ""original actors"" from King Kong 33, and there would be a perfect Kong movie."
I:10;2997;Even though it was three hours it was still great.
I:10;2998;It was more exciting than the original and the first remake.
I:10;2999;Director Peter Jackson is a smart man for creating the film in the same year and era that the original first came out.
I:10;3000;And in the end when Kong was killed photographers climbed on Kong's body and took pictures up close which happened in the end of the first remake.
I:10;3001;Bottom line it was a great film from beginning to end and could have made at least three hundred million or more.
I:10;3002;The scene where Ann and Kong are watching the sunset is wonderful.
I:10;3003;The skating scene in Central Park was very moving and sweet, a classic.
I:10;3004;A heart wrenching tragic ending that really hits hard.
I:10;3005;heck, the original KING KONG .
I:10;3006;This release will be fully loaded with special features at $20.
I:10;3007;Jackson's vision is what made this film brilliant.
I:10;3008;Despite his error in casting Jack Black, he completely makes up for it by casting the amazing Naomi Watts (Academy Award Nominee for Best Actress, 2003, 21 Grams).
I:10;3009;Watts is radiant as Ann Darrow, and really was born to play this part (pardon the pun from the movie).
I:10;3010;It really adds to the substance of the film, giving it a great amount of depth.
I:10;3011;The tender scenes between Kong (played by the great character actor Andy Serkis) and Ann are brilliant, and they really improve the mood, and the emotion of the outcome.
I:10;3012;Their brief scenes (which are almost always interrupted by humans) are brilliantly shot.
I:10;3013;The cinematography is fantastic, and the effects are amazing.
I:10;3014;peter Jackson has created a wonderful follow up to 2003's Best Picture Winner The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, and his talent as a filmmaker is astonishing.
I:10;3015;Jackson will be forever compared with James Cameron (Titanic) as one of the great epic filmmakers of all time.
I:10;3016;that said, King Kong is very well made movie.
I:10;3017;I was pleasantly suprised with this movie.
I:10;3018;I liked this movie out of all of them.
I:10;3019;With that being said, it is a much longer movie and it does drag in some places, but is well worth a watch.
I:10;3020;I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a good remake of an orginal movie.
I:10;3021;the biggest let down of all is the relationship of Kong and Naomi Watts, who is an actress of great merit and does her best with what she is given.
I:10;3022;The only real scene that shows any tenderness prior to Kong's demise is that of the two watching a beautiful sunset.
I:10;3023;In the 1933 version, we feel great empathy toward Kong, but in Jackson's version he is a mean destructive beast who actually eats a man alive.
I:10;3024;Aren't apes vegetarians?In conclusion, the special effects are tremendous as is the photograghy and sound.
I:10;3025;He masterfully recreates the world of the 1930s, including an art deco New York wallowing in the Depression.
I:10;3026;Standout performences include Jack Black, as a smarmy film producer, and Naomi Watts, the beauty who killed the beast.
I:10;3027;Watts is especially a heart breaker, who can make one believe that she can make anyone or anything fall in love with her, even a giant ape.
I:10;3028;ray is gorgeous, I have a problem with Jack Black.
I:10;3029;even George Carlin, all serious and very funny comedians, managed to develop a serious acting side and pulled together some very good dramatic movies and they even succeeded at expanding their talents as serious actors.
I:10;3030;the one thing I have to credit is Peter Jackson who producing a very good movie.
I:10;3031;"Disturbing imagery!The Kong ""character"" is incredible as are all the creatures on the island."
I:10;3032;His range of emotions is amazing .
I:10;3033;The scene with the brontosaurus/raptor stampede is fun but it's still way too over the top.
I:10;3034;Great effects, great acting (Naomi Watts manages to pull off caring about Kong without getting corny, as in Jessica Lange's prior take on this character), great cinematography, great directing, great scenes, but the action scenes are just too much in some places and this takes a little away from an otherwise brilliant remake.
I:10;3035;love yer work Peter Jackson.
I:10;3036;naomi watts is great, and looks like a classic movie star.
I:10;3037;jack black is perfect in his role.
I:10;3038;the original movie, like this one, is more special effects and action.
I:10;3039;driven rather than good solid engaging story.
I:10;3040;cheesy, with two many acion sequences and scenes worthy of the cutting room floor.
I:10;3041;the original King Kong is what made Jackson want to become a filmmaker.
I:10;3042;I'm one fan of the original who felt this film could have been so much more.
I:10;3043;excellent product arrrived on time for a weekend party that i was planning good for adults and children it was a hit.
I:10;3044;the blue ray disk was excellent for no defects on it.
I:10;3045;"the Skull Island sequences of this classic, ""which is not just an adventure film,"" were brilliant, and the overall approach to and reworking of the original film was very successful."
I:10;3046;Also note some humorous re.
I:10;3047;The lure of King Kong, and Peter Jackson's ability as a director was enough to convince me to go.
I:10;3048;King Kong lived up to all of it, and exceeded my expectations by a lot, though my standard of living hasn't changed.
I:10;3049;The least hostile monster on the island is the vegetarian Kong, who is won over by beauty and comedy, and trust me when I say Kong has no shortage of hostility.
I:10;3050;Naomi Watts' character makes Kong laugh.
I:10;3051;in spite of being shaken nearly to death like a rag doll in his massive grip, she manages to befriend him.
I:10;3052;the ape most of all.
I:10;3053;these bugs are utterly convincing as they spring on top of their prey, trying to bite heads, legs.
I:10;3054;"They are devoured and anyone who watches the National Geographic channel or ""Wild Discovery"" knows how insects eat and can picture in their minds what I'm trying to warn you about."
I:10;3055;the complaints I have about King Kong, is that while I know it was important to show King Kong as sympathetic, a likeable character with a personality, I almost ODed on how sad he is.
I:10;3056;"Rope it in, and let's see some rampage."""
I:10;3057;the movie was intense, with fabulous action.
I:10;3058;king Kong is thrilling, exciting with the right blend of humor, drama and action.
I:10;3059;Peter Jackson took a classic and made it even more so.
I:10;3060;The original KING KONG has withstood the test of time so that it stands as one of the top 100 films of all time.
I:10;3061;around, Jackson has decided to go the special effects route, which are often so spectacular that by the second half, these effects encroach on the developing bond between Kong and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts).
I:10;3062;And that brings me to the function of Jack Driscoll.
I:10;3063;In the original he was the romantic lead and was believable enough in his aw.
I:10;3064;There are more sparks between Kong and Darrow than between Darrow and Driscoll.
I:10;3065;KING KONG III is a treat for the eyes, but less so for the mind and soul.
I:10;3066;That to me suggests the difference between a good remake and the infinitely more enjoyable original.
I:10;3067;Let's make it as complicated as possible, they must have said.
I:10;3068;confidence of special effects people these days is not supported by the results in this film.
I:10;3069;there are very few redeeming features.
I:10;3070;"The ship's captain is gruff and taciturn, yet noble and brave
I:10;3071;I don't know how the rest of you feel, but Mister Black has thoroughly overstayed his welcome in the public arena.
I:10;3072;She wants to see him killed.
I:10;3073;This film has inspired me to go on to make movies.
I:10;3074;The star of this film is Andy Serkis he dose the motion cap of Kong and he's just great and brings the character to life.
I:10;3075;Easily one of the best films of 2005, Peter Jackson's King Kong is now officially one of, if not my absolute favorite movie of all time.
I:10;3076;"of course, I'm not just gushing to be one of the ""in crowd,"" because King Kong really IS something unique amoungst cinema."
I:10;3077;worthy (at the very least), the writing and acting is all rock.
I:10;3078;solid, and the directing is inspired, as is Jackson's style.
I:10;3079;the best aspect of the film, aside from one of the best giant monster battles in pop.
I:10;3080;culture history, is the wonderful relationship between the mighty Kong (Andy Serkis) and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts).
I:10;3081;I love watching king kong the movie and always loved this movie as a kid and enjoy it as an adult.
I:10;3082;I don't use that word in normal discourse, but this movie is certainly deserving of it.
I:10;3083;the effects are simply masterful.
I:10;3084;Kong is a REAL character, created and brought to life with the magic of CGI.
I:10;3085;The movements are thoroughly ape.
I:10;3086;like and Kong is given a unique personality.
I:10;3087;The imagination that went into this is unreal.
I:10;3088;The other inhabitants of Skull Island are also extremely impressive.
I:10;3089;Jackson and crew have created a surreal prehistoric land of mystery and wonder.
I:10;3090;the drama is touching, as experienced in the relationship shared by Kong and Ann.
I:10;3091;There are a few scenes in this movie that are immensely moving, such as when Kong is captured on Skull Island, when Kong discovers ice amidst his chase through the city and, of course, Kong's final stand atop the Empire State Building.
I:10;3092;The final scene is done wonderfully.
I:10;3093;this is a staggering movie achievement.
I:10;3094;There is a featurette concerning the history of Skull Island, a featurette about 1933 New York City and the Post.
I:10;3095;production Diaries, covering all areas of post.
I:10;3096;The making of this epic tale was an amazing undertaking .
I:10;3097;and it has all been well.
I:10;3098;The bonus disc provides great supplemental material that is worth seeing.
I:10;3099;He kept throwing a large variety of CG animals at us, bats, tetradactyls, spider things, giant leeches, more giant bug thing, dinosaurs.
I:10;3100;not bad, not great eitherAdrian Brody .
I:10;3101;king Kong was great, Mr. Jackson can be proud of that.
I:10;3102;overall it's worth viewing once, after that go back to the original from the 30's.
I:10;3103;King Kong is so awsome I loved this movie so epic so majestic.
I:10;3104;And I love it so much can't wait for the 2.
I:10;3105;This three hour movie feels more like two hours which is a good thing.
I:10;3106;King Kong is one of my favorite movies and I just have to have a copy on my Amazon so I can see it when ever I want, where ever I am.
I:10;3107;This was an excellent version of a classic story.
I:10;3108;King Kong was outstanding in his looks and behavior.
I:10;3109;The best one ever, I feel.
I:10;3110;While I was glad it stuck to the original story, I would one day like to see a version where King Kong wins in the end.
I:10;3111;but just the story line itself kept my attention.
I:10;3112;and King Kong was frightining, yet loveable.
I:10;3113;lol so fake, but i loved it!
I:10;3114;I watch King Kong so I can see the ape go nuts.
I:10;3115;I love movies so much that I watch very few of them.
I:10;3116;Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy is a bright spot in the recent history of cinema.
I:10;3117;success, Rings brought one of my favorite books of all time to life in a way that I could never have predicted.
I:10;3118;I was reminded that one reason I love movies is their ability to transport you into a thrilling new experience that's impossible to have in the routine of daily life.
I:10;3119;It takes a certain sort of filmmaker to dream up and then implement the kind of viscerally beautiful action scenes that Jackson puts into his movies.
I:10;3120;In one review I read that the character of King Kong is the single greatest visual effect of all time, and I would concur.
I:10;3121;But those foibles I will gladly forgive if the rest of the movie delivers on my overpriced movie ticket.
I:10;3122;Jackson is truly one of the great imagineers of cinema, and Kong reminds me why I go to the movies in the first place.
I:10;3123;His face is just so funny, when he wants to be serious in a scene you can avoid to laugh as hell.
I:10;3124;Being the first King Kong a classic, even the second is much better than this and yes, Jessica Lange is way more enjoyable to watch than Naomi
I:10;3125;i thought the cgi was good and realistic (there is such a variance it's amazing to me.
I:10;3126;And the acting was pretty good, including Jack Black (after all the character is meant to be broad).
I:10;3127;sorry, I think Peter Jackson is capable of better.
I:10;3128;i also loved and hated the homage to the original, while it was nice, it was distracting to hear the old dialogue verbatim (as part of the film within the film.)
I:10;3129;"finally, when Kong and Watts are ""together"" on screen the film works."
I:10;3130;I love anything directed by Peter Jackson and I decided to give Jack Black movies as a christmas gift.
I:10;3131;King Kong was a perfect gift,as it fit both my requirements.
I:10;3132;"Let me preface this by saying that I had great expectations for ""Kong"" because of LOTRs, which Peter Jackson et al. created and put to screen in some of the greatest films since Hollywood's Golden Age."
I:10;3133;hour action but maintained a great sense of character development and humor.
I:10;3134;i absolutely loved the scenes where Kong was actually on screen and agree with the Academy Awards(c) decisions to grant them awards for sound, design, etc.
I:10;3135;2 or 2 1/2 stars are all it deserves.
I:10;3136;I felt compassion for a CGI monkey.
I:10;3137;The acting performances given by Naomi Watts, Adrien Brody, and Jack Black were amazing.
I:10;3138;I have so much respect for Naomi Watts.
I:10;3139;It was truly an AMAZING acting job.
I:10;3140;Even actors in some of the smaller parts such as Preston (Colin Hanks) and Jimmy (Jamie Bell) give an awesome performance.
I:10;3141;peter Jackson is a genius!
I:10;3142;"His ""Kong"" retains the essential story elements of the original, but elevates the tale beyond its origins."
I:10;3143;"Instead of a simple ""beauty and the beast"" action adventure, this ""Kong"" emerges as a kind of paean to naturalism, a condemnation of the technology that at once makes the world and peoples' minds smaller."
I:10;3144;"well, since Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" films."
I:10;3145;style credits, immediately evoking a mood for the piece that is kept throughout.
I:10;3146;It is an unusual choice for a filmmaker, but it works, particularly in contrast with what follows.
I:10;3147;Dinosaurs, bugs, savage tribes, more dinosaurs, and forces of nature all make malicious appearances in attempts to hinder the crew, yet the narrative rarely ever feels strained.
I:10;3148;"Part of this is due to Jackson's wise echoing of Spielberg in his treatment of the ""monster."""
I:10;3149;He is animated using the same kind of motion.
I:10;3150;He runs, jumps, and fights most impressively .
I:10;3151;but most endearing are his quiet, tender scenes with Ann.
I:10;3152;They have a connection, a chemistry, that not even the writer Jack Driscoll, with all his wonderful words, can match.
I:10;3153;"Like Fay Wray before her, she does her fair share of screaming, but she also has a certain delicate strength to her that is intriguing, both to us and to Kong
I:10;3154;She forces Kong to respect her, and allows him to protect her, and it is this that forms the basis of their strange, primal connection.
I:10;3155;the supporting players are as good as anything else in the movie.
I:10;3156;Adrian Brody and Jack Black are perhaps not obvious choices for action movies, but they fill their characters perfectly, in ways that are both obvious and surprising.
I:10;3157;Brody has a quiet, intense, almost suffering look to him at times that suits his character perfectly: here is a man who is more at home with typewriters than T. rexes, who nevertheless manages to rewrite himself in order to save the girl.
I:10;3158;"played by Jack Black, the film director Carl Denham is more than a determined filmmaker
I:10;3159;Black does not play Denham as a likeable or a good man, but he is supremely entertaining to watch.
I:10;3160;"One such instance is a remarkable dinosaur stampede on the island: the creatures don't have the same solid feel that, say, the ""Jurassic Park"" dinosaurs have, but it works."
I:10;3161;The CG Manhattan that Kong is unleashed upon also has this dreamlike, less.
I:10;3162;solid feel: buildings and lights are hazy, sometimes in clearer focus than others, but this makes it a Manhattan that suits Kong: it may not have existed, but it is enticing .
I:10;3163;the climactic scene is one of the best I can remember in films for some time.
I:10;3164;The reversion of the roles is striking: where once Kong protected her, now Ann desperately tries to protect him.
I:10;3165;King Kong is a movie of shocking beauty, passion, and impact.
I:10;3166;It has both unrelenting action scenes and scenes of simple but surprisingly intense emotion, making it easily not only one of the year's best pictures, but one of the best of its kind.
I:10;3167;once again, peter jackson wows us with another one of his great big over the top movies.
I:10;3168;fresh of his LOTR victory, jackson has now turned his gaze to the 1930 classic king kong making it longer (about 190+ minutes long) bigger (big mad ape) and more spectacular (can we say dinosaur fights anyone?)
I:10;3169;so see jacksons next triumph.
I:10;3170;When I first saw this movie I got do emotional I love this movie sooo much.
I:10;3171;It's such a classic and much cheaper on heree
I:10;3172;As you can see elsewhere, people did!
I:10;3173;The movie is as gripping as watching someone fly.
I:10;3174;ray version of this movie looks amazing.
I:10;3175;I love Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings.
I:10;3176;The story is famoous and Peter Jackson's storytelling and action are brilliant.
I:10;3177;, it's pretty darn perfect.
I:10;3178;Hey, the bonus features are wonderful too.
I:10;3179;I loved the Skull Island documentary.
I:10;3180;Director Peter Jackson has done the seemingly impossible: he has revived the 70 year old King Kong franchise and more to the point: made it fun, exciting, romantic, scary and touching.
I:10;3181;the CGI work is the best I've seen though at times the seams show.
I:10;3182;Most of this action is good and sometimes even amazing but there's just too much of it.
I:10;3183;Though the storyline is basic he populates this film with the very best actors: Naomi Watts as his heroine Ann Darrow, Jack Black as Carl Darrow and Adrian Brody as Jack Driscoll.
I:10;3184;All of these actors treat their characters with respect, give their all and it elevates their characters from wallpaper to living, breathing human beings.
I:10;3185;King Kongis breathtaking on many levels and personal and touching on others: what more could you ask for in a movie?
I:10;3186;He assembles his crew, he hires a captain and his ship and he hires a beautful Ann Darrow, played by the beautiful Nicole Kidman look alike Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr., The Ring) and they go on a voyage to find this mysterious Skull Island.
I:10;3187;Jack Black wants to capture the Ape and they do by cholorforming it.
I:10;3188;Peter Jackson triumphs making it a welcome tribute the to the original one (which is still good by the way), with an excellent cast despite some cheesy effects.
I:10;3189;enjoy it and if you cant, well then you're just a crab apple.
I:10;3190;This is an awesome filmmaking achievement, with some of the best special effects ever captured on the screen.
I:10;3191;We all know the story, so it was up to Jackson to create a new vision of the tale and that he has done.
I:10;3192;"Although the movie starts slowly, once they reach Skull Island, the movie never lets up: Kong vs. the Tyrannosaures is brilliant, especially the dizzying battle on the hanging vines
I:10;3193;Naomi Watts shines as Ann Darrow, the beauty to the giant beast.
I:10;3194;Watts captures the fervor in which the relationship develops, and of course using Andy Sirkis digitally as Kong is pure genius.
I:10;3195;He gives Kong a truly individual personality never captured in either of the first two films.
I:10;3196;Adrian Brody is good as the writer who shares Ann's passion for the beast.
I:10;3197;Art for the sake of art.
I:10;3198;I waited for months to see this movie again.
I:10;3199;It was the story and Peter Jackson's excellent movie making.
I:10;3200;Was it as good as I was expecting?
I:10;3201;If you're looking to kill three hours while being mildy entertained, then Kong is a good choice.
I:10;3202;I was a bit skeptical going into this movie and was pleasantly surprised.
I:10;3203;The cast was excellent, and the Blu.
I:10;3204;Great story, and fun to watch.
I:10;3205;awaited upgrade of KINGKONG is a superb motion picture, balancing wit andtragedy, satire and sentiment, delivered withrippling power and a passionate depth which willnot be ignored.
I:10;3206;KONG's pacing is brisk and fluid,at times cutting as a pitchman's jive, at othertimes as gentle as a precious moment quietlyshared.
I:10;3207;crucial introof characters and motivations, which is a particularpoint where Jackson, cast, and crew nurture theoriginal tale of thrill.
I:10;3208;jackson, Walsh, and Boyens bring this particularpoint home with their broader look into the keyindividuals of the steamship's crew.
I:10;3209;While Thomas Kretschmann's Captain Engelhornpaints a tougher, more wary seafarer than the crustydepiction in the original film, the one to watchmost vividly is First Mate Hayes, a wise andworld.
I:10;3210;weathered sailor beautifully deliveredby Evan Parke.
I:10;3211;"dah stereotypes on ""The GreatWhite Way"" is an ingenious set of scenes in themselves."
I:10;3212;beaten compassion of Parke'sperformance, Jackson, cast and crew directly addressthe one great flaw in the original KING KONG, andmasterfully turns it around.
I:10;3213;conceptual James Newton Howard delivers amasterwork of a score.
I:10;3214;All in all, Howarddelivers quite an inspirational feat of composition,all around.
I:10;3215;alan Lee's design work, once more, is sheer magic.
I:10;3216;Atpoints, some of the Skull Island overviews touch uponFrank Frazetta's legendary vistas, capped with Lee'sown touch of the substantially fantastic.
I:10;3217;just as aptly, the traps and hypocrisies of the Westernjungle are depicted with stunning detail.
I:10;3218;in this, Kyle Chandler, Adrien Brody and Jack Blackunveil a brilliant comment of the differing faces of showbiz, then and now.
I:10;3219;, it is the quiet wisdomof Brody's Jack Driscoll which rises to the occasion,meeting each new danger with great courage.
I:10;3220;Needing tocome to grips with his own words, Driscoll will dare tocross lethal terrain, and stand at the top of theworld to secure the well.
I:10;3221;Naomi Watts is justplain wonderful.
I:10;3222;To Ann Darrow, she brings the airof naivete, gusto, wit and wide.
I:10;3223;eyed innocence whichmarked Fay Wray's original portrayal of the role.
I:10;3224;"with this, Watts adds an astonishing depth inprojecting the despair of virtue besieged by thedespairing times of The ""Great"" Depression."
I:10;3225;"Too,with her uncanny ability to gain Kong's respect,Watts certainly brings new meaning to the term""Broadway trouper""!"
I:10;3226;which brings us to the standout work of Andy Serkis.
I:10;3227;if you think his body language was superb portrayingGollum in THE LORD OF THE RINGS, wait until you seehis bravura performance delivering the unspokendrives of the Great Ape.
I:10;3228;WETA's digital imagery doesthe original's SFX wizard, Willis O'Brien, great honorwith their wondrous genius, but it is Serkis' giftedphysicality which brings the majesty and tragedyof KING KONG so achingly home.
I:10;3229;worthy pantomime,and Watts' grasp upon the loneliness lurking beneath theterror, that the saga's crucial bond takes firm hold here.
I:10;3230;Whatcomes from that bond is what makes this KING KONG so very,very special.
I:10;3231;"now we wait for Jackson and friends to deliver THE HOBBIT!Meanwhile, an image I will carry in my mind and soul, foryears to come, is that view from the Empire State Building
I:10;3232;This movie is visually stunning with some of the best CGI I've ever seen.
I:10;3233;I love the story of the giant ape Kong falling in love with the hot blonde, and Peter Jackson does it very well.
I:10;3234;One of the greatest masterpieces of our time.
I:10;3235;If there's any further proof necessary that the best filmmakers are those who passionately love their material, it's Peter Jackson.
I:10;3236;After all, this is just a story about a big monkey, right?
I:10;3237;kong's story is now a part of American culture: a giant gorilla (Kong, a digital puppet controlled by Andy Serkis of Gollum fame) lurks somewhere on a mysterious island, a world populated by fantastic dinosaurs and creepy crawlies of all types.
I:10;3238;Accustomed to battling predators for his food, we discover that Kong is the last of his kind.
I:10;3239;It is here that Carl Denham (Jack Black) will film his new movie.
I:10;3240;Which is a good thing, because she always wanted to be a comedienne but could never find an audience.
I:10;3241;With Kong, she gets the chance to do physical comedy.
I:10;3242;Kong finds it hysterical, proving that tripping and falling on your face is a universally funny joke.
I:10;3243;Eventually, Anne is rescued and Kong is captured, brought back to New York to serve as a Broadway act.
I:10;3244;There's nothing Carl won't exploit, including the very wonder of discovery.
I:10;3245;this version of King Kong is a masterful, outsized version of the 1930s original.
I:10;3246;By staying true to the characters, the movie ends up being more of a silent screen piece, filled with affectionate gazes between Kong and Anne.
I:10;3247;Communication is limited between the two characters, but it's a testament to Jackson's directing that we can see the connection.
I:10;3248;Kong's eyes are amazingly expressive, more so than his human counterparts.
I:10;3249;amazingly, Black manages to keep his manic energy tightly focused.
I:10;3250;The character of Carl is believable through both Black's action as well as his pop.
I:10;3251;Although he feigns courage, sorrow, and affection, Carl is the real monster in this movie and it's to Black's credit that he's a believable character rather than a one.
I:10;3252;Kong himself is fantastically rendered, but that's expected.
I:10;3253;What is surprising are the fauna of Skull Island.
I:10;3254;I hate them with a passion.
I:10;3255;Jackson's body of work is evidence that one day, fanboys will rule the world.
I:10;3256;Peter Jackson has firmly established himself as a director on the level of masters like Steven Spielberg.
I:10;3257;King Kong takes us on a journey ranging from the highest highs to the lowest lows.
I:10;3258;This is truly a stunningly powerful remake of the classic tale.
I:10;3259;a tale which inspired Mr. Jackson to get into film making in the first place.
I:10;3260;first and foremost are the special effects.
I:10;3261;His quirky mannerisms and expressions shine on the big screen, as does his fascination with the lovely Ms. Darrow.
I:10;3262;Kong does battle with several fierce dinos to protect Ann and the action sequences are incredible as are the dinosaurs themselves.
I:10;3263;So during the final shots of Kong battling the airplanes on top of the Empire State Building, Jackson is free to use broad and uncompromised camera angles.
I:10;3264;The entire final sequence is emotionally draining and acrophobic as the height and scale are surreal.
I:10;3265;the final compelling attribute to King Kong is the bond between him and Ann Darrow.
I:10;3266;All Kong wants is to be with her and protect her.
I:10;3267;Their reunion is both beautiful and sad since we all know the final outcome.
I:10;3268;Kong's chase though crowded Manhattan is another spectacular display.
I:10;3269;all in all, this film is an astonishing piece of cinematic work.
I:10;3270;Jackson nails every single aspect of what an action movie slash love story should be.
I:10;3271;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, period.
I:10;3272;it's amazing that Jackson's ego doesn't effect the tides.
I:10;3273;My family watched this together and if it's your first time or fifth it's always a good watch.
I:10;3274;As a technical tour de force Peter Jackson's re.
I:10;3275;"make of the classic 1933 ""King Kong"" has some merit, but as a humdinger of a story with thrills and chills the original has the new film beaten by a mile."
I:10;3276;The early New York City scenes were duly impressive but as with everything else in the movie, done to excess.
I:10;3277;"Jackson's Kong is a movie so enamored of its subject , so filled with ""in references"" to Old Hollywood and Broadway (granted, amusing up to a point) that it lays there like the huge monster's corpse at the film's finale."
I:10;3278;A truly great film and remarkably worth every cent to go see.
I:10;3279;Kong was as good as I could have imagined and truly came to life.
I:10;3280;Naomi Watts' performace was top notch.
I:10;3281;and she is without a doubt extremely attractive and the perfect actress for the role.
I:10;3282;in EVERY other way, this film delivers.
I:10;3283;Any film that can deliver so much emotion and attachment to a 25 foot Gorilla has something special to recognize.
I:10;3284;This, in itself, makes a beautiful film.
I:10;3285;and as may be expected, the special effects are amazing.
I:10;3286;Kong is, in every way REAL.
I:10;3287;Although the biplane sequences and a few car shots were flawed, Skull Island was a gem in filmmaking.
I:10;3288;A great new film, standing proudly beside the '33 Original.
I:10;3289;The length of the movie matches it's grand scale.
I:10;3290;a modern movie with an old serial adventure feel.
I:10;3291;kong weaves a fantastic story in a believable fashion, pulling few if any punches.
I:10;3292;The relationship between the female lead (Naomi Watts as Ann Darrow) and King Kong is both refreshingly realistic and poignant.
I:10;3293;The scenes of depression era New York are absolutely stunning in it's realism.
I:10;3294;Jackson should be commended for this alone.
I:10;3295;He also spends a good deal of time on character development.
I:10;3296;dimensional, but it is clear that the main characters are Ann Darrow and Kong.
I:10;3297;viewers, protagonists, and antagonists alike.
I:10;3298;the real Houdini's of society, escape artists who eke.
I:10;3299;One of these is the hauntingly beautiful and melancholy Ann Darrow, a stage actress blessed with essential vaudevillian skills, yet possessing an uncommon taste for literature, particularly the insightful, allegorical tomes of author and playwright, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody).
I:10;3300;"They are the true masters of their ""Johnny."
I:10;3301;absorbed actors, including the inimitable Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler).
I:10;3302;No question, Peter Jackson enjoys poking fun at himself and his industry.
I:10;3303;up with Ann, and so begins one of most unusual romances in film history, fraught with mistrust and fear before easing into mutual respect and platonic love.
I:10;3304;The moment mesmerizes them as they perch atop a cliff in Kong's inhospitable backyard and watch the fiery globe, magnified on the horizon, kiss the illuminated Sea goodbye, for another day, as it gently lifts itself from the latter's swelling embrace.
I:10;3305;Unbeknownst to them, destiny will oblige them to witness this miracle again, in Ann's backyard, atop the less hospitable Empire State Building.
I:10;3306;Beauty and Beast will gaze wondrously eastward.
I:10;3307;this time, in the direction of Lady Liberty, the imperishable light of the new world.
I:10;3308;"Weta's Argonauts beckon us to plumb the depths of Conrad's classic to draw deeper meaning from the poignant references to ""beauty and the beast"" that Merrion Cooper and Edgar Wallace cleverly dialoged for Fay Wray (Watt's uncanny, look."
I:10;3309;She amuses him with a smile, a dance, and a tear, and after an icy, nighttime romp through frigid Central Park, shows him the Way.
I:10;3310;King Kong is a good movie, full of action, special effects, and heart.
I:10;3311;The action is tense and unrelenting.
I:10;3312;Black and Brody do good jobs as their respective characters.
I:10;3313;Watts shows she can act convincingly with a green screen.
I:10;3314;Fans of Peter Jackson (and there are many) will no doubt be thrilled by everything in this movie, and for them I recommend this film highly.
I:10;3315;I must say this film was by far one of best movies I have seen all year.
I:10;3316;Great spec effects, I love how the ape was protrayed as a real natural.
I:10;3317;All the ape wanted to do was to be at peace, return to the wild and, nuture his beauty queen.
I:10;3318;You want a good recipe?
I:10;3319;By all means: add 2 cups of King Kong, 1 cup of popcorn, and 1/2 cup of soda.
I:10;3320;Mix all the ingredients together and presto!
I:10;3321;you have a great movie that you can enjoy with or without the ones you love!
I:10;3322;It is funny how things work out the way they do.
I:10;3323;imagining of the famous stop.
I:10;3324;third of the story is spent on bringing all the main characters of the film together onto the S. s. Venture destined for Skull Island.
I:10;3325;The second section of the film, a majority of which take place on the island itself, is what truly makes up the movie.
I:10;3326;naomi Watts is positively delightful in the role of struggling actress Ann Darrow who is recruited by motion picture director/producer Carl Denham to star in his adventure film and is then captured by the natives of Skull Island to be offered as a sacrifice to Kong.
I:10;3327;Like Kong himself, we the audience are entranced with her attractive appearance and sympathize with her life and desires early in the picture.
I:10;3328;King Kong will likely open a lot of doors for Miss Watts which is well deserved for the range of emotions she exhibits in this film.
I:10;3329;He works well as the everyman's hero and the foil to Bruce Baxter, the Hollywood action star who in reality is nothing more then a coward.
I:10;3330;however, the best performance in the film is given by Andy Serkis.
I:10;3331;He was strapped with a special suit with sensors attached in specific places in order to capture not only his movements but also his facial expressions.
I:10;3332;Besides being one of the most realistic and distinguished computer animated creations in recent memory, Kong is furthermore one of the most emotionally grappling characters in the film, filling you with terror and excitement one moment and the next having at the verge of tears.
I:10;3333;Serkis simply does a positively phenomenal job at retaining Kong's wild natural instincts early on in the picture while at the same time slowly integrating subtle human.
I:10;3334;overall, Peter Jackson's King Kong is truly a rare motion picture event that can honestly be defined as an epic in every capacity of the word.
I:10;3335;The source of these problems may reside with director Peter Jackson's success following the lucrative Lord of the Rings trilogy and how it may very well have gone to his head, albeit unintentionally and unconsciously of course.
I:10;3336;Prior to Lord of the Rings, Jackson worked with what he had and that was that.
I:10;3337;There are scenes in King Kong, a majority of which appear in the second act of the movie, that are exhilarating but do nothing to advance either the plot or the message of the film.
I:10;3338;regardless, the action sequences and the impressive computer animation effects which accompany them are what truly make up this picture.
I:10;3339;Anyhow, a majority of the action sequences do work effectively.
I:10;3340;One scene in particular in which Kong proceeds to toss Ann Darrow from paw to paw as he battles three tyrannosaurs at once will literally have you gasping for air and clutching the edge of your seat.
I:10;3341;It is just that intense.
I:10;3342;hour motion picture event King Kong after Howard Shore and director Peter Jackson parted ways on the project, what he delivers in the film, albeit far from what can be described as a disaster, is nothing memorable.
I:10;3343;The original King Kong was one of my all time favorite movies and I still love it, but I must say that I actually love this remake more.
I:10;3344;The spectacular special effects, characters you care about (I love the relationship between Jimmy and Mr. Hayes, Denham and his assistant) and of course the wonderfully poignant and tender friendship of Ann and Kong.
I:10;3345;Adrian Brody is great in this role as is the beautifully expressive Naomi Watts.
I:10;3346;All of the prehistoric creatures are amazing and frightening and the island/jungle itself is remarkable.
I:10;3347;"My favorite scene probably is after Kong's triumphant battle with the T. rex's and he sort of shames Ann into running after him, he finally picks her up and puts her on his shoulder, it's as though he's thinking, ""after all I've done for you, you try to escape from me, hmmmph!"""
I:10;3348;This is a wonderfully engrossing film with characters you care about.
I:10;3349;And the musical score is lovely too.
I:10;3350;As Ann and Kong would say, King Kong is beautiful.
I:10;3351;As soon as the ape is subdued, we fast forward to opening night of his performance in New York.
I:10;3352;But Cameron leaves all that in the dust and what we are left with is a visually stunning and special effects driven feature film that is very shallow and superficial.
I:10;3353;The story of King Kong is awesome.
I:10;3354;i liked the original very much, but I felt this remake was far better.
I:10;3355;King Kong's size was consistent in this version.
I:10;3356;And Jack Black, though I'm not a fan, was great in this movie.
I:10;3357;He assembles his crew, he hires a captain and his ship and he hires a beautful Ann Darrow, played by the beautiful Nicole Kidman look alike Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr., The Ring) and they go on a voyage to find this mysterious Skull Island.
I:10;3358;Jack Black wants to capture the Ape and they do by cholorforming it.
I:10;3359;Peter Jackson triumphs making it a welcome tribute the to the original one (which is still good by the way), with an excellent cast despite some cheesy effects.
I:10;3360;enjoy it and if you cant, well then you're just a crab apple.
I:10;3361;a good Kong will have a human response to the Fay Wray character, butthat is never managed.
I:10;3362;seventeen members of the Venture crew who look for an eighth wonder ofthe World on Skull Island die.
I:10;3363;I notice the thirties computerized New York stuff is basedon Norman Rockwell paintings and famous Life and Look Magazine photosof the period.
I:10;3364;That is never really accomplished.
I:10;3365;This movie is theopposite of clever.
I:10;3366;He is made up to look like the young director OrsonWelles at about the time he made Citizen Kane.
I:10;3367;Mostly Black plays thecharacter as a mad scientist, his entire face often filling the screenwith a diabolical look that rarely changes.
I:10;3368;This movie had the potential to be an excellent movie.
I:10;3369;It updated the old King Kong with all the modern film.
I:10;3370;The camera work, the special effects, etc. were all brilliant.
I:10;3371;The acting was easily above par.
I:10;3372;budget does not equal great movie.
I:10;3373;let's start with the visuals.
I:10;3374;But hey, it's a movie.
I:10;3375;The genius Lord of the Rings director, Peter Jackson, pays homage to his all.
I:10;3376;dropping adventure make the new remake of King Kong a success in its genre.
I:10;3377;adapted from the original story and placed evocatively in the original 1930s, the new Kong also expands the story, giving us new plots and adventures on the expedition, as well as details about the Depression, Broadway and the vaudeville worlds.
I:10;3378;the result is a dazzling, but very long movie.
I:10;3379;At three hours and seven minutes, King Kong provides us with the most astonishing special effects ever put on celluloid.
I:10;3380;Of course, the many moments of action and emotion help propel the stunning spectacle.
I:10;3381;though visually stunning, the new Kong isn't totally perfect.
I:10;3382;three memorable performances give heart and warmth to the film, including Naomi Watts as the heartbreaking Ann Darrow, and Jamie Bell as the sweet offbeat kid Jimmie.
I:10;3383;Kong is a marvel of emotional expressions.
I:10;3384;He moves and leaps with boundless energy, he jumps easily onto cliffs and buildings, and easily fights dinosaurs at once.
I:10;3385;He can show passion for Ann Darrow and then provoke in us the same sadness his eyes portrays once he's taken from his world.
I:10;3386;besides Ann, he's one of the other deep characters in the film, and even without a single line to utter, this creature surprisingly has the depth to move us emotionally to the point you just want him to get the girl, in spite of the river of differences that divides these two kindred spirits.
I:10;3387;Seen both the old and new versions.
I:10;3388;compared to the old black and white version, this is so much better.
I:10;3389;i rate it 4 starts because it's so scary.
I:10;3390;boy/girl and they both got scared by the movie, so I would rate it R. but otherwise, the movie keeps you on edge right through.
I:10;3391;King Kong is the umpteenth remake of the 1933 film that starred Fay Wray as a starlet who wins the heart of a wild giant ape, leading to his destruction at the hands of civilized men.
I:10;3392;Peter Jackson directed and co. wrote this 2005 version of the story, which takes advantage of major improvements in visual effects technology over the past 70 years to create a giant ape whose emotions are more recognizable and sympathetic than in ever before.
I:10;3393;legend of his own making.
I:10;3394;King Kong is a film in 3 or 4 acts, depending upon how you count.
I:10;3395;"The first and last take place in New York City, as Carl Denham pulls his cast and crew together and, finally, when he brings ""King Kong: Eighth Wonder of the World"" to the public."
I:10;3396;Jack Black lends Denham the right amounts of humor and unbridled ambition, and the city anchors the film in the real world.
I:10;3397;The discord and intrigue on the ship as it sails for anywhere exotic, dangerous, and far away from authorities is also interesting.
I:10;3398;that said, the relationship between Ann and Kong is terrific.
I:10;3399;The entire cast does a great job of bringing credibility and humor to a story of man.
I:10;3400;We also see the commercial.
I:10;3401;See More of NTC: Wish You Were Here (1 min) is a trailer for a short film that you can see on seemoreofnyc(dot)com.
I:10;3402;Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish.
I:10;3403;Lot's of Thrilling and Adventurous scenes with Dinosaurs, Bugs, and Parasites eating everybody.
I:10;3404;the movie is not only to full of Bloody scenes but it also has Animal Abuse in it.
I:10;3405;this film can only be watched once and that's all, because it is so sad that it's like watching a car accident ect ect. overall, I Loved this film with the special effects and the Beautiful Carnivores Ripping thing apart.
I:10;3406;OMG I loved the original King Kong.
I:10;3407;So, I thought that a bigger and better version would be cool, something interesting to watch, even though I was iffy about Jack Black playing the director.
I:10;3408;I loved, loved, LOVED this movie.
I:10;3409;What can I say, I have a big place in my heart for animals.
I:10;3410;But, I can honestly say that it was extremely well done.
I:10;3411;the special effects in the movie were amazing, the bugs almost looked real as did the dinosaurs (what can I say, we know they weren't, right???)
I:10;3412;And, the love story wasn't cheesy.
I:10;3413;I enjoyed what I could make it through.
I:10;3414;The visuals in this movie were absolutely stunning, and the action was amazing.
I:10;3415;I thought that all of the actors were perfect for their roles, and they performed superbly.
I:10;3416;Peter Jackson's first movie since the Lord of the Rings trilogy is King Kong, which could have been great on so many levels.
I:10;3417;i will give the director his dues for production values .
I:10;3418;the special effects are extraordinary and his direction spot.
I:10;3419;The fact that he was able make the relationship between the woman and Kong plausible and emotional should have earned him more credit.
I:10;3420;while I know that I am one of the few who aren't praising the film completely, there are merits to it and it deserves to be seen just because of what he accomplished with the relationship.
I:10;3421;otherwise, it's just another Kong film.
I:10;3422;When it comes to King Kong, the movie is well, the King.
I:10;3423;Peter Jackson's flair for the dramatic and his detalied action secquences are top notch.
I:10;3424;The fact that Kong and Watts had a connection, as wierd as it may sound, worked!
I:10;3425;The story was somewhat in context of a beauty and the beast kind of setting.
I:10;3426;the scale and granduer used by Peter Jackson is amazing.
I:10;3427;I put him higher then good old Spielberg, Ron Howard, and put him more on the level of George Lucas.
I:10;3428;once again, Watts was amazing.
I:10;3429;She, in this version, was actually part of a somewhat love triangle with herself, Kong, and Driscoll (played by Adrian Brody), and she pulled it off.
I:10;3430;The fact that she actually in my opinion, knew what Kong was trying to do as far protect her, and the fact that she cared in this movie made it leaps and bounds better then the original.
I:10;3431;THe little hand signals, the looks, everything was perfect and really caught the mood of the movie.
I:10;3432;This love story, as odd as it may be, is original, and awesome.
I:10;3433;peter Jackson took this timeless classic, put a spin on it, and made it an epic tragedy/love story/adventure.
I:10;3434;I personally saw it 3 times in the theatre, it was that good.
I:10;3435;"In trying to weld the cornball tone of the original ""Kong"" with a more modern sense of gravitas, gifted director Peter Jackson and fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens found that they sometimes had to force fit the two."
I:10;3436;pick in the face of the most bracingly exciting and enormously entertaining movie of the year.
I:10;3437;Peter Jackson has brought his dream project to life with enough soul, humor and smarts that far outweigh any problems that the film has.
I:10;3438;Kong makes off with Ann, eventually discovering they share a deep bond and the common enemy in the other inhabitants of the Island.
I:10;3439;From then on, Jackson kicks into overdrive, barreling through one incredible action scene after another with an assortment of creatures that up the intensity quotient for all other fantasy and action films that are destined to follow in his wake.
I:10;3440;"to say ""King Kong"" is spectacular is an understatement."
I:10;3441;The visual effects provided by Weta are absolutely staggering, both for their near perfect realism and exhilarating urgency.
I:10;3442;From the stunning resurrection of 1930's New York to the beauty and terror of Skull Island, they sweep the audience to a lost world.
I:10;3443;Working with Andy Serkis in a motion capture studio, Weta and Jackson have brought the Ape to life with equal parts fierceness and emotional depth, making Kong breathe with life.
I:10;3444;Jack Black proves a great bit of casting, playing Denham as he is: an obsessive, amoral weasel.
I:10;3445;Adrien Brody takes the less relevant role of Jack Driscoll and has fun with it, giving off subtle humor and masculine confidence.
I:10;3446;Naomi Watts is phenomenal as the struggling vaudville actress Ann Darrow who develops a deep, loving bond with Kong.
I:10;3447;The beauty and the beast dynamic that was instrumental to the success of the original is just as prevalent here, and Watts and Andy Serkis as Kong make you believe wholeheartedly in that bond.
I:10;3448;It is palpable, funny and ultimately tragic.
I:10;3449;It is the beating heart of a film that reminds us of just how exciting and memorable movies can be.
I:10;3450;Best part of movie is relationship between king kong and his girlfriend.
I:10;3451;But that's about the Kong story in general, as opposed to the film itself.
I:10;3452;regarding the film, the first thing that struck me was how good the special effects were, since Kong seemed so real.
I:10;3453;cgi, you've done it again.)
I:10;3454;The grandeur of the scenes, from NY to Skull Island and back again, were just amazing.
I:10;3455;still though, I guess overall, the combined special effects with basic story still ranked together as an average, decently entertaining film.
I:10;3456;Nothing new here but still a great movie and I'm glad the remade it.
I:10;3457;Oh, how excited I was to hear Peter Jackson was remaking King Kong.
I:10;3458;Oh the joy in my heart when I saw that first preview as Kong contronts a T. rex to save his lady love.
I:10;3459;Oh, how my heart sank when I heard it was over 3 hours.
I:10;3460;Ask anyone who knows me and they'll tell you I can sit and watch giant monsters films all day.
I:10;3461;The dino stampede: good, not great.
I:10;3462;Kong's final battle: A foregone conclusion and drained of all suspense.
I:10;3463;Kong is drained of almost every bit of fun, and wants to impress you with how deep and touching it is.
I:10;3464;This steelbook is an incredible value.
I:10;3465;For under $20 that's a steal.
I:10;3466;I love the 1976 version which really had incredible effects especially in Kong's facial emotions and perfected the relationship between Kong and the woman.
I:10;3467;Ordinary people are utilizing everything in the environment to do amazing feats.
I:10;3468;To me this movie hinges on the identification of the relationship between Kong and the woman which was created so beautifully in the 1976 version.
I:10;3469;It was beauty that killed the beast.
I:10;3470;Breathtaking SFX, good acting, good story, and just about everything else you would expect in a Peter Jackson film.
I:10;3471;Not much else to say other than for you to go out, brave the crowds, and witness the biggest movie spectacle of the year.
I:10;3472;Many of the scenes extend and extend and extend to multiple endings, especially those involving action between men and beast(s) .
I:10;3473;interesting at first but get a bit old after a while.
I:10;3474;Nevertheless, the beauty and beast connection is moving and the special effects are at times breathtaking.
I:10;3475;King Kong is a good action film but nothing more.
I:10;3476;Overall there are some touching moments with Kong but I would really recommend this movie to children.
I:10;3477;Cinematography is just classic Jackson.
I:10;3478;It's very beautiful to watch.
I:10;3479;I loved the stampede and T. rex scenes although some of it seemed waaaaay too impossible.
I:10;3480;some hated the scene where Jane and Kong are scooting around on the frozen lake but I loved it.
I:10;3481;I thought it was a very nice quiet moment amidst the chaotic police chase.
I:10;3482;I doubt I will ever be able to watch him again.
I:10;3483;"I am astounded that people describe this as ""breath taking"" and ""brilliant""I really do wonder about those folks."
I:10;3484;King Kong is the best film of 2005.
I:10;3485;The effects were astounding, breathtaking, and the best I have seen in a film since The Lord of the Rings.
I:10;3486;Peter Jackson has taken us through an emotional and heartbreaking story of the true beauty and the beast.
I:10;3487;You will laugh, you will cry, and it will have an everlasting effect on you.
I:10;3488;The actors did an amazing job and Naomi Watts is at her best.
I:10;3489;Peter Jackson is the best filmmaker of our time and has created a glorious masterpiece.
I:10;3490;This was a fantastic looking movie.
I:10;3491;Besides that this was a great movie.
I:10;3492;But the action scenes and the heart.
I:10;3493;Well, actually, I liked this better than Cooper's version.
I:10;3494;I mean PJ is a genuis!
I:10;3495;He added in all scenes from the old one in this and some new scenes.
I:10;3496;And Kong is taking to New York and you know the rest.
I:10;3497;But here I do give credit to some of the best CGI I have ever seen.
I:10;3498;He kills each of the three T. rex's at least three times!The best scenes are purely with Kong and the girl.
I:10;3499;Naiomi Watts is great and this is the only time that I wanted the film to go on.
I:10;3500;if you want to see the best go back to the original.
I:10;3501;This was/is just a great movie.
I:10;3502;Acting was great, I'm A fan of Dino/jurassic movies so to put them together with the King Of kong it was to beat all.
I:10;3503;I enjoyed this movie so much the 3hrs just flew by and I wanted more!
I:10;3504;The fx were great, what!
I:10;3505;The whole movie was Great!
I:10;3506;The product came quickly and was in excellent condition.
I:10;3507;"The extended version includes extra scenes of the prehistoric ""monsters""."
I:10;3508;The dinosaurs are great, much better than Jurrasic Park.
I:10;3509;"The first time I watched this with my son I thought ""Ho Hum"" another King Kong remake BUT, I really enjoyed this one."
I:10;3510;The relationship between Beauty and The Beast(Kong and the Damsel) is really developed and I found myself wanting Kong to win.
I:10;3511;It's another remake on the Famous King Kong of the 30's A whole lot better than the Claymation one from back then.
I:10;3512;Still though I'd really like to see Kong make it back to the Island and live out his life.
I:10;3513;I liked it, and YES I did cry at the END, Damed ole airplanes anyway.
I:10;3514;As remakes go, this is one of the best and most valid remakes I have ever seen.
I:10;3515;It should have swept the Oscars and is without a doubt one of the best fantasy films ever made!
I:10;3516;One of the greatest films of all time gets a high tech upgrade.
I:10;3517;I really wish that purist could see why this is so beautifully done.
I:10;3518;"It is a fantasy film ""kids""!"
I:10;3519;So when we see situations that don't seem possible, please keep this in mind.
I:10;3520;the original King Kong is one of my favorite movies of all time, but I'm glad this film didn't follow the original note for note.
I:10;3521;The connection between Ann and Kong, which a lot of people had problems with, is welcome, as it makes the story much more interesting and heartfelt.
I:10;3522;I think Jackson should be commended for his efforts and this could very well be his crown jewel!
I:10;3523;There is also a ton of great new extras!
I:10;3524;The colors are sharp and vibrant, and the film is crystal clear.
I:10;3525;The audio is just as good.
I:10;3526;The only reason I took a star off is because the actual movie script is decent at best.
I:10;3527;Adrian Brody does a pretty good job, but overall the movie's plot is average.
I:10;3528;Luckily, I bought this movie for the stunning visual experience, so I'm not disappointed.
I:10;3529;I'm a big fan of the original King Kong, but I never go into re.
I:10;3530;packed with the creatures in such a small space, it looks more cartoon.
I:10;3531;when Kong escapes into the streets of New York, all is pure chaos and non.
I:10;3532;I realize it's a re.
I:10;3533;make, but if Jackson is going to take liberties to build up characters and make us sit through 3.
I:10;3534;hours, there better well be a good reason.
I:10;3535;The realism of Kong having true gorilla mannerisms was great and it really lends to the viewer's sympathy for him as a wild animal, simply following trying to his instincts.
I:10;3536;For that same reason, I found the ending to be gut.
I:10;3537;wrenching, as well as his captivity scene.
I:10;3538;The action and visual effects are stunning and once they start, they don't let up.
I:10;3539;I really felt like I had been somewhere extraordinary when it was over.
I:10;3540;in the end, I would recommend this film as a visual stunner and to true fans of King Kong, or fans of fast.
I:10;3541;lastly, I would NOT recommend it for kids.
I:10;3542;He really was magnificent in those movies.
I:10;3543;the original King Kong movie is still the best.
I:10;3544;At least the special effects were superb in this new one.
I:10;3545;top musicals and these days it's over.
I:10;3546;I knew I would like the film.
I:10;3547;But, let us face it.
I:10;3548;good action scenes with Kong.
I:10;3549;A good, but not great job by Universal and the film makers.
I:10;3550;It is easy to see the energy and effort put into remaking this epic.
I:10;3551;but this IS the best CGI ever put on film hands down !!!
I:10;3552;To lighten things up, every now and then for emotional gravitas, a shot of a passionately concerned Naomi Watts who is in love with a large, killer monkey makes for a good laugh.
I:10;3553;to be honest, somewhere in the middle of the island scenes I went out for a breath of fresh air and to listen to some music in my car.
I:10;3554;What is great about this .
I:10;3555;Great, can't stand a screen.
I:10;3556;Digital shots of digital monkey.
I:10;3557;* The whole over the top, sweeping digital ending.
I:10;3558;Oh look, he's smitten by her.
I:10;3559;She is fine with this and even performs a little vaudeville act for him.
I:10;3560;Yes, dinosaurs inhabit the island with King Kong.
I:10;3561;There are countless dinosaurs and only one giant ape but of course, he's fine.
I:10;3562;It makes much more sense to hang on to her and fight with only one arm.
I:10;3563;Kong should sell car insurance.
I:10;3564;Climb up to the highest building you can find.
I:10;3565;It's balmy and nice here in Kong's giant paw.
I:10;3566;He won't get involved in the least but he'll take the credit and grope the girl in the end.
I:10;3567;still saying goodbye with a loving, longing look in his eyes.
I:10;3568;naomi still looks good, not a hair out of place.
I:10;3569;She smells like monkey, but she looks good.
I:10;3570;This film delivers what it is suppose to deliver: FUN.
I:10;3571;This isn't serious drama, this is cartoon type fun.
I:10;3572;Jack Black was terrific as Carl Denham, Adrien Brody was okay as the hero and Naomi Watts was great as Ann, the beauty loved by the beast.
I:10;3573;That said, the star of this film is the giant ape and a wonderful job they did bring the beast to life.
I:10;3574;The supporting actors were also very good, including the cameraman, the captain and of course the male movie star.
I:10;3575;Well, I loved the original and I was prepared to be disapointed by a remake.
I:10;3576;This is a great action/adventure movie.
I:10;3577;I had my doubts about Jack Black, but he really does deliver as does the rest of the cast.
I:10;3578;Kong was a lot fun.
I:10;3579;The 3 hours will fly by and you will be amazed.
I:10;3580;I always liked Peter Jackson's version of King Kong, but I love the Extended version all the more with the added monster footage!
I:10;3581;i can talk about the single disc edition, cuz i owned it.
I:10;3582;My name is Jose Jimenez.
I:10;3583;And I like to write to you.
I:10;3584;And this is what I speak.
I:10;3585;I say it is good to have kings.
I:10;3586;A very faithful remake, this new Kong has only a few subtle differences in the main story as its '33 counterpart.
I:10;3587;Mainly that Jackson takes alot more time to tell everything, and set everything up.
I:10;3588;scientist type role) as he is about to lose funding for his latest feature film, and his deliberate conning of everyone around him (including Ann, and screenwriter Jack Drischol, played by oscar winner Adrien Brody) to get off to sea and basically steal an opportunity to strike it rich.
I:10;3589;He has this look in his eye during the whole movie that suggests he's a little psychotic.
I:10;3590;but I think it works alot better.
I:10;3591;And then the big man arrives.
I:10;3592;the look of this entire scene will stay with you for along time.
I:10;3593;The amount of detail on him is amazing, especially in his facial expressions.
I:10;3594;He IS a real ape, and a real flesh and blood character!!!
I:10;3595;I mean you look at him and he has personality, a soul.
I:10;3596;He's curious about her, and you can tell he's really trying to connect with her after awhile, but its hard.
I:10;3597;and all this is good, because the movie hinges on this relationship between Kong and Ann, and both Kong and Naomi Watts are amazing in this capacity.
I:10;3598;Its mostly unspoken, all the acting going on (with both of them) in the eyes and expressions, and it is magic.
I:10;3599;It is amazing, and very very touching and poignant.
I:10;3600;moving along now, Skull Island brings a faster paced movie for along time with Dinosaurs and creepy crawlers everywhere.
I:10;3601;Nothing can prepare you for how amazing and thrilling watching Kong fight off 3.
I:10;3602;It is incredible, and beyond words to try and explain.
I:10;3603;Ann begins to realize what they're going to do and your heart starts racing.
I:10;3604;He slips on the ice, and begins playing with Ann, spinning around in a beautiful, touching, and heartbreaking scene.
I:10;3605;Its so adorable, the connection these two have, and you believe every second of it.
I:10;3606;Its beautiful, but also heartwrenching because we know whats about to happen, we know the fate of our beloved ape.
I:10;3607;"She had looked out over a sunset, and touched her own chest and said ""beautiful""."
I:10;3608;"beautiful"" then the sound and then the images of the Bi."
I:10;3609;Kong lowers Ann to a safe spot and gets to the very top so they don't shoot at her.
I:10;3610;This movie is epic in everyway.
I:10;3611;Its amazing, thrilling, well acted, and very emotional.
I:10;3612;Its a movie that shouldn't be missed, and that will become and remain a classic for a long, long time.
I:10;3613;We really enjoyed this movie with Jack Black.
I:10;3614;The scenery and special effects are great.
I:10;3615;Although we were fans of the original, this one takes it's place!
I:10;3616;One of the most compelling and engaging platonic love stories to illuminate the resplendent plane.
I:10;3617;the film amalgamates action, sci.
I:10;3618;fi, horror, and romance masterfully.
I:10;3619;an imperfect masterpiece that dwarfs the 1933 classic.
I:10;3620;the director who brought The Lord of the Rings to the big screen in an excellent adaptation that stayed true to the core of Tolkien's tale.
I:10;3621;hour tale full of action, adventure, fear, love, fellowship, betrayal and poignancy.
I:10;3622;Watts' interaction with the immense gorilla is excellent .
I:10;3623;Instead, he wanted her to fully interact on a variety of levels with an enormous, violent and inscrutable beast and she hit every note.
I:10;3624;"additional kudos to Jack Black, who works the sleazy showman angle nicely without overplaying it
I:10;3625;a special note for Andy Serkis, the career character actor who has donned the movement.
I:10;3626;capture suit to play both Gollum and Kong.
I:10;3627;Serkis did a fine job with the Kong movements, and had a memorable cameo in his own right as the irascible ship cook of the Venture.
I:10;3628;more good: the effects, naturally.
I:10;3629;Watts' Darrow barely speaks with Kong, yet they have tremendous communication.
I:10;3630;From happy to sad to defiant to angry, the computer effects captured everything and did an extraordinary job.
I:10;3631;You see his intelligence, his love for Darrow, his concern for her safety, his jealousy, and more.
I:10;3632;Best of all (although saddest of all), his confusion and despair when he tries to find her in NYC.
I:10;3633;the Ugly: Jackson does a great job of capturing the depravity of man, both during the immediate return to the US after Kong's capture when the great gorilla is made into a Broadway spectacle that a full house cannot pay enough to see, and after the great beast's fall.
I:10;3634;ultimately, the payoff is so huge that the buildup is worth it.
I:10;3635;I believe this movie was the best movie of the year, a very close runner up was Batman Begins.
I:10;3636;I loved how the changed the story a little.
I:10;3637;Instead of a dingy screaming blonde that King Kong is chasing after, they made the blonde girl, Noami Watts, a smart, loving, caring woman who loved King Kong and was his best friend.
I:10;3638;i also liked how they changed the blonde girls love interest from the actor, to a plain joe type.
I:10;3639;Great actors in this film.
I:10;3640;Noami Watts deserved some type of award for this part.
I:10;3641;i loved the scene when King Kong finds Noami Watts in the city and he slides around on the ice as he holds her.
I:10;3642;I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy so much.
I:10;3643;My two stars are for the jungle sounds, that I liked.
I:10;3644;The copy is good and the cover is in very good shape as well.
I:10;3645;Peter Jackson is an impressive filmmaker indeed.
I:10;3646;Jackson's new film is vastly superior to the original and the crummy 70's remake.
I:10;3647;This film has a heart which is rare to find in a popcorn film such as this.
I:10;3648;The acting is very impressive and the special effects are astounding.
I:10;3649;A good movie for some great adventure scenes and for a surprisingly emotional relationship between Kong and Watts.
I:10;3650;Better effects were achieved in the original King Kong.
I:10;3651;The best example of integrated cg in a film is still the first film to use the technology: Jurassic Park.
I:10;3652;There was a time when special affects were used in films to create the illusion of reality now special affects seem to be used to make things seem unreal.
I:10;3653;Peter Jackson shows why his the big pimp in Hollywood and the audience leaves the theatre completely satisfied.
I:10;3654;Kudos really goes to the special effect team.
I:10;3655;I see quite a few Oscars for this film in the future.
I:10;3656;Naomi Watts (the new scream queen) managed to have a wonderful chemistry with with all likeihood a blue screen.
I:10;3657;The '76 version, with all its flaws, is a far better film than Jackson's pixelated version.
I:10;3658;"When the highly anticipated ""King Kong"" first hit theaters, i remember a lot of critics and friends saying it was a "" great "" movie."
I:10;3659;the saving graces are the scenery, the special effects, and Kong himself, who is the most impressive and believable character in the whole thing.
I:10;3660;peter Jackson has created a masterpiece, a triumph, something that you cant take your eyes off!
I:10;3661;peter jackson has presented us a film that has spectacular special effects.
I:10;3662;and more important a wonderful STORY.
I:10;3663;because as LUCAS and JACKSON have stated countless times the story is the most important element in a film, and the special effects are merely tools in helping you get the story told.
I:10;3664;is superb in paying homage to the classic 1933 film(which i have to be honest.
I:10;3665;its hard to choose between the 2 films because they are both excellent) in respect for the original film 'P. j.' deceided to place the film again in the 1930s with a expanded outlook on charecter development.
I:10;3666;well as for the rest of the film.you know it.you love it.
I:10;3667;he has heart, emotion, and you can tell that he loves ann.
I:10;3668;this is truly Beauty and the beast.
I:10;3669;this film has expanded the classic film tenfold.
I:10;3670;just like the original this new version of kong has depth and emotion truly groundbreaking in effects work .
I:10;3671;it gives the director more time to properly set up his story and preset it right.
I:10;3672;what if it really existed.you also get a very interesting documentary on the 1930s and the great depression.
I:10;3673;but if you have them keep em they make a nice companion to this set.
I:10;3674;is one of those movies that stands the test of time.
I:10;3675;its a tribute to a great film.
I:10;3676;Thank you mr. jackson for this wonderful epic.
I:10;3677;Some people dig so deep into everything from his vision to his trhought process.
I:10;3678;Loved it, Loved it, Loved it, ESPECIALLY blu.
I:10;3679;Great family movie for those with older (over 13?)
I:10;3680;is back, and this time he has a leading man who can act.
I:10;3681;laden jungle sequence is long (as it is in the original), but it is directed with such panache, and is so funny, that only a curmudgeon or a cineaste would think to complain .
I:10;3682;A truly outstanding cinema experience.
I:10;3683;What a Beautiful and amazing movie!
I:10;3684;Naomi Watts is absolutely breath.
I:10;3685;This is, hands down, the BEST motion picture that I have ever seen in my life!
I:10;3686;The characters have such depth!
I:10;3687;The special effects are magnificent!
I:10;3688;The musical score by James Newton Howard (Batman Begins) is amazing!
I:10;3689;This movie was pure entertainment with so much heart!
I:10;3690;this incarnation of King Kong is the absolute best though!
I:10;3691;She was brilliant in this movie!
I:10;3692;You could totally feel the bond that formed between her and Kong!
I:10;3693;What an incredible and wonderful movie!
I:10;3694;it's a mixed bag, but worth seeing.
I:10;3695;Will recommend to others for sure.
I:10;3696;Still, this movie is a very entertaining ride worth taking.
I:10;3697;This was a great Movie!!
I:10;3698;Naomi Watts is ethereal, with such emotion,and delivered a knockout performance .
I:10;3699;what a truly versatile and talented actress she is.
I:10;3700;The rest of the cast was equally talented .
I:10;3701;The special effects were stunning but the story really moved me .
I:10;3702;The music score was beautiful and really tugged at your heart strings .
I:10;3703;Kong was so realistic and expressive!
I:10;3704;The scene near the end where Kong and Ann enjoyed the frozen pond was so beautiful and poignant it made me cry!
I:10;3705;This film is what great moviemaking is all about!!!!!!!!!
I:10;3706;The film is visually stunning.
I:10;3707;It's worth seeing just for that reason.
I:10;3708;Often the actors are very out of place in their roles, even though they give good performances.
I:10;3709;Very strange, although he is quite good in his role.
I:10;3710;as I said before, it's worth a watch for the special effects.
I:10;3711;"The Extended Version of ""King Kong"" is a better movie than the theatrical one released in 2005."
I:10;3712;They added excitement and tention to this movie.
I:10;3713;"Still ""King Kong"" is a good film ,and I recommend the Extended Version over the original one."
I:10;3714;I liked it because it had fighting.
I:10;3715;I also liked it becasue it has a big gorilla and because it had shooting.
I:10;3716;I give this movie a thumbs up!
I:10;3717;I harbored monumental hopes for this film when I learned that Sir Peter Jackson was finally going to get to make it.
I:10;3718;I was especially excited to hear Sir Peter comment in an interview that the originalKing Kongwas his favorite film of all time because it's one of mine as well.
I:10;3719;I fear that this production snowballed and got away from him.
I:10;3720;He brought along quite a bit of the production crew (as well as some actors) for the ride and so it was natural that *Kong* was produced by much the same process.
I:10;3721;It was all just too much and I think that Sir Peter's approach significantly diminished this potentially superb adventure yarn.
I:10;3722;I viewed it all as an aggregation of distraction and mis.
I:10;3723;Jackson brought him back to life.
I:10;3724;The remake of this movie was done brilliantly.
I:10;3725;"The setting remained ""depression era"" with an exquistite cast of characters."
I:10;3726;stop intrigue, suspense, and action.
I:10;3727;The 1933 film is still one of my favoritefilms, despite the primitive technology, mostly because I knew most of the cast.
I:10;3728;If you like the story, you'll like this version.
I:10;3729;Just relax and enjoy it for what it is: the movie you wanted to see in 1933 as it was envisioned by theearly filmakers.
I:10;3730;Peter Jackson's version is easily the best of the three Kong epics.
I:10;3731;The acting is first rate and nearly matches the intensity of the action.
I:10;3732;King Kong doesn't quite reach the unmatched level of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's close enough to guarantee the viewer an exciting evening of escapist entertainment.
I:10;3733;Sure, you'll remember Kong, the special effects and the deluge of action, but it is Ann Darrow who will steal your heart.
I:10;3734;The action here is ripping throughout and one will find it hard to breathe during some of the spectacular sequences.
I:10;3735;There is also action, jaw dropping special effects, beauty in abundance and still more action during this sixty minute roller coaster ride.
I:10;3736;in a real triumph for special effects.
I:10;3737;matches her emotions with the sadness conveyed in his CGI brown eyes.
I:10;3738;They really did a good job on blu ray.
I:10;3739;A very emotional movie, a real tear.
I:10;3740;It's far and away the best movie in its genre ever made.
I:10;3741;While not the kinda movie known for it's great deeply thought out plot, it does it's job providing entertainment for everyone, the level of details shown on Blu ray are amazing!
I:10;3742;The deluxe set is fantastic.
I:10;3743;This set offers so much for the family and I would recommend it for anyone.
I:10;3744;I love the other films Peter Jackson has made.
I:10;3745;Naomi Watts is refreshingly subtle and the other cast members seem good.
I:10;3746;Ah yes, the special effects.
I:10;3747;a light hearted adventure movie with great possibilities for scenery and reasonably fantastic creatures suddenly turns too menacing, with impossibly bleak occult and action scenes that no one would live with or through.
I:10;3748;You gotta be smart to be believable.
I:10;3749;The cast members were good and Naomi Watts was rightly cast in Fay Wray's role.
I:10;3750;Before I get started, I find it very interesting that so many reviewers are knocking the length of the new King Kong, yet they've written reviews that are longer than term papers!Here goes:The 1933 original is a classic landmark film for it's time.
I:10;3751;Kong looks like a guy in a costume, especially the way he walks upright like a human being.
I:10;3752;peter Jackson's 2005 remake is excellent, but not perfect.
I:10;3753;The film captures depression era New York very well.
I:10;3754;The CGI is a marvel, Kong looks very real.
I:10;3755;"telling of Beauty and the Beast
I:10;3756;Directors, please S. l. o. w down the action scenes a wee bit so the audience can actually enjoy what they're watching.
I:10;3757;I absolutely LOVED this remake.
I:10;3758;I don't know about anyone else, but I love hearing a director's comments and thoughts.
I:10;3759;I love hearing what was going through his head when he made a particular scene.
I:10;3760;Personally, I love animals and it tears me apart when I see or hear of them being abused (Michael Vick, you deserve your punishment, if not more).
I:10;3761;That was probably still a good choice as the end really pulls at my heart strings.
I:10;3762;the video is breathtaking, especially once the characters arrive on the island.
I:10;3763;The jungle scenes are truly alive and really pop in the way you hope a new hi def disc will.
I:10;3764;The graphics and animation by WETA (who also did Lord of the Rings) are top notch.
I:10;3765;They blend almost perfectly with the scenery and the details allow you to really look at them and appreciate how good they really are.
I:10;3766;audio wise, we get a very robust Dolby Digital Plus mix.
I:10;3767;This disc packs a wallop that'll knock you across the room during the action parts.
I:10;3768;The dialog and score are perfectly balanced and sound great too, but I always look forward to the action bits and this one is everything you could hope for.
I:10;3769;I found new demo material here with the Kong/T.
I:10;3770;If you don't have home theater, this movie will inspire you to consider it as it's as much a sonic marvel as a visual wonder.
I:10;3771;And all of this is only bested by a wonderful story and excellent acting.
I:10;3772;Overall, this is a wonderful film and is what I believe to be the best adaptation of King Kong ever.
I:10;3773;The question is, knowing the outcome, can you make it to the end?
I:10;3774;And what's great about this film is that all the characters (from the minor to the major) all have relationships with the other unlike old film and the remakes.
I:10;3775;I wasn't expecting to be dazzled by the movie despite the director simply because of its Source material, but I got a real surprise out of this film entirely.
I:10;3776;When he only receives 14 pages Denham cunningly manages to keep Driscoll on the boat as it leaves.
I:10;3777;All of the actors show of their talent by bringing their characters to life.
I:10;3778;The natives of the Skull Island were actually given some respect and an overall intelligent revamp from their 1933 counterparts.
I:10;3779;The film pulls you into moments of clam or relaxation and comes out of nowhere with moments that make you jump.
I:10;3780;the movie's CGI is also a splendor to behold in and of itself.
I:10;3781;The animation is excellently blended into the film.
I:10;3782;King Kong himself is realistically animated by Serkis who is widely known by LOTR fans for bringing the fallen character Gollum/Semeagol to life in the all three award winning movies.
I:10;3783;He moved and behaved exactly like a Silver back Gorilla would.
I:10;3784;a very nice item to add to my collection.
I:10;3785;This version of King Kong starts out very well with believable characters, subplots, and scripting.
I:10;3786;The story sets up several hints at interesting characters with intriguing personal stories.
I:10;3787;everything else seems to be going great until the big tree trunk over the ravine.
I:10;3788;characterizations, relationships, and depth .
I:10;3789;I Will keep this review short and sweet.
I:10;3790;Great visuals and special effects, good acting, and the scenes with the natives are especially great and well thought out.
I:10;3791;so maybe other people will greatly appreciate it.
I:10;3792;Good story Jack Black plays his character well and adds some comedic value to the movie which keeps you drawed in+great visual effects and Kudos to the scenes with the native savages and the sacrafice scene.
I:10;3793;all and all by the movie its worth it
I:10;3794;Characteristic of the brilliant Peter Jackson,this is a long movie.
I:10;3795;but it's so packed with action that you don't really notice.
I:10;3796;the CGI guys did an awesome job at creating Kong and the creatures of Skull Island.
I:10;3797;they are so realistic and the scenes with the dinosaur stampede and where Kong defends Anne from the T. rex are breathtaking.
I:10;3798;the scenery is amazing(even though it is blue screen,it's still amazing).
I:10;3799;the story telling is great.
I:10;3800;and the relationship between Kong and Anne is beautiful.
I:10;3801;over all a great movie.
I:10;3802;I do have a special place in my heart for the movie King Kong.
I:10;3803;The original was timeless, however this one is an update and makes the characters more realistic than ever.
I:10;3804;It will become another one of those classics that you can come back to again.
I:10;3805;The effects in the movie are sweet though, and most of the other actors are good enough.
I:10;3806;Extension cords help out a great deal when one is testing the limits of their own sexuality.
I:10;3807;A great movie can be determined by the hours passed without feeling the urge to go to the toilet even if a movie takes three hours long.
I:10;3808;"Peter Jackson has made his name in making great fantasy movie and ""King Kong"" did just that for me, making me escape from the real world for that three hours."
I:10;3809;Audience cringed, laughed, awed, sobbed along the way.
I:10;3810;This movie was handled with a great sensitivity.
I:10;3811;The set was sumptuous, made in Art Deco style, the in.
I:10;3812;Naomi Watts, Jack Black, Andy Serkis, Adrien Brody were truly true to form and they truly engaged the audience.
I:10;3813;"Talking about ""God is in details"", the Peter Jackson let their imagination takes flight in imagining the ecosystem that creates and sustains the habitat in that island."
I:10;3814;A very personal movie for Peter Jackson and a movie that MUST be viewed on the big screen.
I:10;3815;the sensationalism/special effects, call them what you will were there and right on cue throughout the entire movie.
I:10;3816;but I must say that the man with his taleneted crew knows how to entertain and move their audience.
I:10;3817;Even those who are familiar with the story of King Kong will sit tightened to their seats.
I:10;3818;scenes are fantastic, the atmosphere of the movie capturing (it really is so exiting!)
I:10;3819;, it grabbed my attention from the start .
I:10;3820;don't get me wrong now, it's just that it kind of stays with you for a while afterwards, at least if you're of the easily.
I:10;3821;The special effects are reminders of 50's ufo movies.
I:10;3822;I never really thought the first movie was that interesting except as an interesting special effects flick, which though showing effects way ahead of its time, still didn't really have a story I cared much about.
I:10;3823;This movie ended up being well worth the time.
I:10;3824;Instead, I spent my time enjoying what I could, among them1) Now Kong and Ann actually have a relationship that makes the closing line have any meaning.2) Kong's animated expressiveness matches that of Gollum's, but Kong has the added difficulty of being unable to speak.3) Jack Black is funny.
I:10;3825;I enjoyed it at least.4) Adrien Brody is a great actor and I was amazed at how much emotion he put into a role that I'm pretty sure nobody even remotely connected to this movie cared that much about.
I:10;3826;overall I'm glad I actually ended up seeing it.
I:10;3827;I can't really see myself seeing it much more often, but for one viewing it entertains for a good long time, keeping up the pace the entire time.
I:10;3828;good remake of the old classic.
I:10;3829;long, but interesting take, showing the girl as fearless instead of so lost and helpless.
I:10;3830;"The effects were amazing, Skull Island was actually scary as hell
I:10;3831;Another genius film by Jackson, loved it.
I:10;3832;I just love this ape!!
I:10;3833;The scene of Kong and Anne shot from behind them watching the sun set is the most beautiful scene in movie history.
I:10;3834;Not exactly Peter Jacksons best work but for what it lacks in acting and editing it makes up for in its CG and its fun action.
I:10;3835;is more than good, it!
I:10;3836;I love it and I like it, Kong .
I:10;3837;But , I miss Fay Wray, alot, she was the one King Kong loved in King Kong of 1933 movie but, again it works well and well done as a remake.
I:10;3838;so take time and watch them both and have a fun time watching.
I:10;3839;This movie has EVERYTHING anyone ever could hope to find in a movie: romance, action, adventure, mystery, emotion, beautiful musical score, flawless special effects, sheer horror, breathtaking cinematography, good acting, comic relief, etc.
I:10;3840;The result is a genuinely believeable presentation.
I:10;3841;The aminated Kong was believeable as a real ape.
I:10;3842;The giant theme is well complemented with a colorful mix of characters.
I:10;3843;The movie flows very well.
I:10;3844;It leaves a very distinct impression.
I:10;3845;If you liked the original King Kong, you will like this movie.
I:10;3846;If you are into special effects, action, adventure, monster, or epic movies, you will love this movie.
I:10;3847;If you liked Lord of the Rings, you will WORSHIP this movie.
I:10;3848;what to say, its so amazing that nothing comes close.
I:10;3849;its a combination of, Love, action, mystery and suspence teamed with breathtaking Special effects.
I:10;3850;its a movie for all ages and people would love it.
I:10;3851;Wishing all along to see this, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this adaptation of the classic horror movie is quite noteworthy.
I:10;3852;Here she is wonderful as the the beauty who tames the savage beast.
I:10;3853;it is certainly a worthy addition to anyone's collection.
I:10;3854;Being one of the most anticipated movies of the year, I decided to go see `King Kong' to see what all the hype was about.
I:10;3855;Even though this movie is more than three hours long, I found it to be one of the best movies to be released this year.
I:10;3856;He also traps Jack Driscoll (played by Adrien Brody), the writer for his film, into coming along with them for the filming.
I:10;3857;since I haven't watched any previous versions of King Kong (even though I knew vaguely about the story), I really cannot compare how good or bad it is from the others, but I can say that I loved watching this film!
I:10;3858;It has everything in it: love, action, adventure, drama etc. which is what one expects from such a movie.
I:10;3859;"The first one hour of a movie is a little slow, because it only shows the character developments
I:10;3860;naomi Watts once again shows us that she is a talented actress by playing her role as Ann Darrow.
I:10;3861;Some reviews mention that all she did was scream a lot in the movie, but I feel her performance was the best because it is really hard to act with an imaginary character, especially one such as King Kong.
I:10;3862;I feel that is one of the few things that Peter Jackson could have revised.
I:10;3863;But other than that, I loved everything about King Kong.
I:10;3864;The special effects were fantastic in most scenes, but could have been made more realistic in some parts, such as the shipwreck before Skull Island.
I:10;3865;"on the whole, I found ""King Kong"" much better than Peter Jackson's previous works, including Lord of the Rings."
I:10;3866;Go in with the idea that it will be entertaining, and you won't be all that disappointed.
I:10;3867;This holds true for the most part in this vision of King Kong, although in contrast to the main stars, the supporting cast (the ship's captain, first mate and other character.
I:10;3868;"type actors) were very good and ""right on the money."
I:10;3869;This film takes the tack of making a great tale of terror into an inter.
I:10;3870;with a Thompson submachine gun, yet!
I:10;3871;"although this was definitely a ""labor of love"" by Mr. Peter Jackson, and it does succeed on some levels, I really hope the next re."
I:10;3872;Well this is an entertaining movie.
I:10;3873;I just wish a lot more thought had gone into the original story, and also wouldn't it be nice to see some genuinely great characters and true epics from mr Jackson.
I:10;3874;Great movie and version of the original.
I:10;3875;Great cast, story, and action.
I:10;3876;This movie was made with a kind of passion that is very rare in Hollywood these days.
I:10;3877;Naomi's acting is OK, and she can be pretty when the lighting is just right.
I:10;3878;The way she wins the monkey's heart is absolutely absurd.
I:10;3879;most a visual feast for the eyes.
I:10;3880;The level of detail in all of the films locations and set pieces is truely draw.
I:10;3881;From the creatures to the ship to Skull Island and even New York itself, the level of computer image technology, model and miniature work today is truely outstanding.
I:10;3882;"We're talking ""the thrill of the chase"" so."
I:10;3883;This film has got to be the most lavish film I have ever seen.
I:10;3884;The environments are so detailed that they really look alive.
I:10;3885;The multitude of creatures that WETA created for this film is truely phenomenal.
I:10;3886;I was even impressed with the CG New York skyline for the final Empire State Building scene.
I:10;3887;The Biplane attack sequence at the end was very spectacular.
I:10;3888;oh yeah, the sound is good too.
I:10;3889;Hopefully the rumored extended edition will come with a DTS track.
I:10;3890;still a solid movie and one to be a masterpiece for sure.
I:10;3891;I had to review this after seeing all the great reviews here.
I:10;3892;This film was the biggest dissapointment that I personally have ever received at the movie theater.
I:10;3893;The special effects while impressive at times were so obviously CGI in certain scenes on the big screen that I thought I was watching a film from 15 years ago.
I:10;3894;I my wife and 2 kids boys of 4 and 12 at the time respectively all thought the movie blew.
I:10;3895;I love this movie (all of them) and I am pleased to add this one to my collection.
I:10;3896;See it once and that's enough but do see it once to say you've seen it.
I:10;3897;The movie speaks for itself because it is a Peter Jackson film.
I:10;3898;ray film, and I have the two day delivery so the shipping was easy and on time.
I:10;3899;It's a terrifically well done action movie to begin with and has great acting and writing with excellent plot and character development.
I:10;3900;even the extended version which runs 200 minutes, because you can view it in several sittings if desired, so it always remains fresh throughout.
I:10;3901;The special effects, which are quite possibly the best ever, come across beautifully on the Blu.
I:10;3902;ray version, and the final scenes on top of the Empire State Building, with planes buzzing Kong, come completely to life with gorgeous, magnificently convincing imagery of the 70.
I:10;3903;year old NYC skyline near sunrise, with incredibly realistic surround sound effects and soundtrack.
I:10;3904;This is a great bargain for a fantastic Blu.
I:10;3905;It is truly a fitting homage to the 1933 classic, complete with situations and dialogue lifted straight from the first film.
I:10;3906;Obviously, Peter Jackson admires the black and white picture immensely.
I:10;3907;There are many points of contention that I have with this movie.
I:10;3908;naomi Watts, even while wearing stilettos, gives the best performance.
I:10;3909;winning clout to the picture for his part was nothing spectacular to begin with and he did his best with it.
I:10;3910;Black and Brody, along with another actor, are able to single.
I:10;3911;I think not!One of the film's best sequences involves the initial discovery of Skull Island, a tense.
I:10;3912;This is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.
I:10;3913;Saw this yesterday afternoon, and I loved it!
I:10;3914;It is quite long (which is a good thing) and It has many thrills, and many pleasurable moments.
I:10;3915;While they're there, they stumble across many legendary creatures, such as this legendary King Kong.
I:10;3916;Kong is shipped back to NYC, and captures the lead actress.
I:10;3917;tHOUGHTS: Better than the original!
I:10;3918;I loved it, a bit frightening at times.
I:10;3919;But at most times, Entertaining!
I:10;3920;This is THE event of the year!So make this that one movie you will see before the new year!
I:10;3921;Everyone knows this story so I will be brief.
I:10;3922;1979 version w/ Jessica Lange had a stronger sexual element to the monkey/girl relation, but was very touching nonetheless.
I:10;3923;The relation here is more of an 'obsession' with a prized possession to protect, that the gorilla has with the girl, versus some type of purely sexual interest.
I:10;3924;So the story is universal in that we can identify with the feelings of the protagonist, even if it is a monkey.
I:10;3925;certain scenes are visually unforgettable.
I:10;3926;She doesn't recognize that part of him, just that he's a big sweet monkey who has love in his heart too.
I:10;3927;She seems to want to marry him.
I:10;3928;the one good thing is the visuals (for the most part, sometimes the CG feels disconnected from the actors), there's a lot of beauty shoved into some scenes.
I:10;3929;What possessed Peter Jackson, after seeing the script for King Kong, to go ahead with the project at all?I mean, the man has talent.
I:10;3930;Perhaps he saw the scope of the premise and thought it would make a stunning film.
I:10;3931;but the whole point of the King Kong story is that it's a simple retelling of the Beauty and the Beast fairytale.
I:10;3932;well, you get my point.
I:10;3933;Characters, people that drive a story forward by the strength of their personalities in the face of physical adversity.
I:10;3934;Naomi Watts is very pretty, but it appears to be a skin.
I:10;3935;deep talent: any old actress can scream and look lovelorn.
I:10;3936;"Jack Black, delivering the line ""Beauty killed the Beast. """
I:10;3937;, the last bit of dialogue in the film, with all the conviction and skill of a rhinoceros attempting ballet.
I:10;3938;which leads me to the real star of the show: Kong himself.
I:10;3939;Motion actor Andy Serkis must be given credit where it's due: the Ape, for the most part, moves in a convincing manner.
I:10;3940;generated image of him works, too .
I:10;3941;this is a character with more personality than all the human 'cast' put together.
I:10;3942;Jackson was clearly far, far more concerned with coaxing better performances out of his cameramen and special effects team than he was with his human players .
I:10;3943;Yesterday in casual conversation, I called The Manchurian Candidate the best remake I've seen of late.
I:10;3944;Last night, to my delighted amazement, I watched what will likely go down as one of the greatest remakes of all time.
I:10;3945;when you've topped the charts with the most profitable movie trilogy of all time, when you've created a film that wins 11 Oscars, when you've created the single greatest achievement in digital effects to date in one of the most epic fantasy series' in film history: what's your follow up act?I'd probably make an artsy talking heads film, but director Peter Jackson has dared to raise the bar by remaking one of the most beloved films in history.
I:10;3946;but Jackson has the two ingredients needed to make this work: he understands why the original works, and he understands why it doesn't.
I:10;3947;Here Naomi Watts provides an intelligent character who grows to understand Kong's compassion and beauty.
I:10;3948;which brings us to the $ 64,000 question: Does it surpass the original?I had the good fortune of catching the 1930s version on TCM yesterday, so I get to compare them with both films fresh in my mind.
I:10;3949;In my taste, the original is superior.
I:10;3950;Both films work equally well on their respective levels.
I:10;3951;Jackson's version works on many more levels, but the original works better on its own terms.
I:10;3952;this goes beyond what I thought a good remake was capable of.
I:10;3953;It somehow remains almost entirely true to the original, while still feeling fresh and new.
I:10;3954;island story comes again to life under the magnificent direction of Peter Jackson, who utterly proves himself as one of the most important filmmakers in history, by delivering a visually stunning as well as dramatically engaging movie.
I:10;3955;out story line, the movie ends up as a masterpiece of modern cinematics and it is undoubtedly due to a solid and well.
I:10;3956;written script framed within a clear director's vision and accompanied by a great cast of actors.
I:10;3957;skillfully, Jackson manages to avoid the temptation of just filling up the screen with flamboyant mega digital effects and ultimately finds the adequate balance between state of the art computer graphics (which are simply amazing here) and the need of giving a sense of reality onscreen (even within the fantasy of the plot).
I:10;3958;Instead you'll enjoy three hours or so of truly great cinema.
I:10;3959;We've all seen the big monkey in one version or another and this one is pretty good.
I:10;3960;It's corney but worth a couple of hours off the tour as we used to say in the war zone.
I:10;3961;While there are no great surprises in the plot, the beauty of this movie is how the plot unfolds and develops, how the story continues to build and how in the very end, the emotion, special effects and acting combine for a seamless climax.
I:10;3962;The movie is a fine tuned roller coaster ride.
I:10;3963;The cooks theory about the abominable snow man is a hoot.
I:10;3964;Best of all I felt the movie connected with the audience.
I:10;3965;She has never cried at a movie before.
I:10;3966;King Kong's special effects are, as of today, the best I have ever seen.
I:10;3967;Too often special effects characters change their size during a movie.
I:10;3968;This makes the movie so much more believable and realistic.
I:10;3969;This is a movie you can take the entire family to.
I:10;3970;A masterpiece of special effects and character research.
I:10;3971;Kong actually acts like a gorilla in love with a beautiful blonde.
I:10;3972;I don't think he is just dazzled by the beauty of Ann Darrow (so wonderfully played by Naomi Watts) but he is also captivated and confused by her courage in front of him.
I:10;3973;Kong respects her because she begins to show no fear and you sense that change in him.
I:10;3974;You can safely take your entire family to this movie and enjoy the ride.
I:10;3975;The acting is impecible, the plot entertaining and the special effects are special.
I:10;3976;Peter Jackson has truely gone beyond Lord of the Rings.
I:10;3977;Thank you Peter and the rest of the gang.
I:10;3978;Remaking a classic can be a thankless undertaking, but Peter Jackson has crafted a film that stands shoulder to shoulder with the original.
I:10;3979;It's these later films that informs Jackson's take on the love story, as the human object of the gorilla's affections comes to love the monster as well.
I:10;3980;"Of course this also brings the ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme full circle, and makes the film's ending even more tragic."
I:10;3981;"Now the expanded edition features even more prehistoric action sequences and they are a real treat, particularly the ""Log Raft"" sequence."
I:10;3982;This new edition is well worth the time and expense, and the Kong mini.
I:10;3983;statue is a cool bonus .
I:10;3984;Another solidly packed midnight preview screening and the film clocks in at over 3 hours!Well, where to start, eh?I've avoided the trailers, reviews, posters, etc, so that my experience would not be tainted by advance publicity.
I:10;3985;The first hour is spent building up the characters, setting up the mystery and allowing some comedy elements to seep in.
I:10;3986;The chemistry between her and Kong is palpable and time is given to showcase their tragic romance.
I:10;3987;The artistic design of the film is beautifully realized and no expense has been spared in creating a mammoth world of danger and suspense.
I:10;3988;The allusion to recent world events and the ensuing bloodshed is laid bare in the poignant climax.
I:10;3989;okay, the film may not be as groundbreaking in the way the original one was, but it still has tons of innovation and high octane adventure to capture the minds of most people.
I:10;3990;i was so glad to see these scenes in the extended edition.
I:10;3991;This was a place that killed you or scarred you, and it explains very well the extreme lifestyle adopted by the islanders.
I:10;3992;Peter Jackson, however, considered his audience and decided not just to WOW!
I:10;3993;them but also to educate them on the world of movie adventure.
I:10;3994;"His message rings lod and clear
I:10;3995;Ironically Kong comes through as the lone survivor of his kind on Skull Island and it's is that staid life in 'civilization' that is more savage than he can cope with.
I:10;3996;Great monkey, great island,etc, etc.
I:10;3997;Loved the cast except for Jack Black (who I generally love).
I:10;3998;Bugs were great, tribe was great, boat was great.
I:10;3999;So we can see more of a love interest between beauty and the beast?
I:10;4000;Still love Peter but, like everyone else in the known world, would love to see him take on the Hobbit.
I:10;4001;It's exciting, breathtaking, and amazing.
I:10;4002;Its the best Kong movie of all time.
I:10;4003;Loved every minute of the movie.
I:10;4004;Picture and sound is among the best I've seen so far on blu ray.
I:10;4005;ray make the movie even better.
I:10;4006;The clarity in the picture and the sound are awesome.
I:10;4007;Well worth adding to your movie collection.
I:10;4008;ray version of this film just rocks your home.
I:10;4009;mA sound tracks have immense impact with a top flight system and at least one killer sub.
I:10;4010;video is superb as well if you are using a top notch blu.
I:10;4011;ray player, plasma and cabling.
I:10;4012;Right now, I'd have to say that Peter Jackson is at the top of his game, and must feel like he's on top of the world.
I:10;4013;After winning Oscars for his labour of love, the Lord of the Rings, he got to turn his attention back to making his childhood fantasy, a remake of King Kong.
I:10;4014;and it shows, in all the little details.
I:10;4015;Many of the scenes are lifted from the original movie.
I:10;4016;The last line definitely is.
I:10;4017;at the same time, Jackson is true to his roots.
I:10;4018;i also liked the sly references that occurred from time to time.
I:10;4019;It's a great popcorn movie, with a great supporting cast (the cast is all supporting Kong, after all).
I:10;4020;The special effects are fluid and believable, and the music score works well.
I:10;4021;Andy Serkis deserves special note, for researching out how gorillas move about, and he's captured it well in his portrayal of Kong.
I:10;4022;It is fantastic and it is worth getting the extended version!
I:10;4023;I'll keep this short and sweet.
I:10;4024;"This has it all
I:10;4025;But this new version with it's special effects totally take away from the story line and is way over done.
I:10;4026;I'll never understand what and why Hollywood has this obsession with special effects.
I:10;4027;I much rather see a film for it's acting and who can beat the old way of special effects before computers.
I:10;4028;"This was a very good movie that maintained the spirit and tone of the original ""King Kong"" while stylistically blending technical and comic elements reminiscent of 1999's ""The Mummy"" to great advantage."
I:10;4029;This is what the popcorn selling movie experience should be about!
I:10;4030;Still, I was entirely enchanted by Naomi Watts portrayal of Ann Darrow and she played the role with a deft sensitivity and she did it without slipping and falling on campy drivel like Jessica Lange did in the first remake.
I:10;4031;Kudo's all around for a stunning simulation of 1930's New York City.
I:10;4032;Skull Island was captured as both a horrifically menacing, yet breathtakingly beautiful place.
I:10;4033;A highly believable, expressive and profoundly tragic life was magically if more accurately.
I:10;4034;skillfully and digitally breathed into Kong in a way not seen before.
I:10;4035;After all, a few hours of entertaining diversion is precisely why we enjoy this genre of film in the first place.
I:10;4036;"Enjoy this ""King Kong"" for what it is."
I:10;4037;a first rate piece of movie making that pays loving and respectful homage to a modern myth borne of the fertile imagination of one Merrian C. Cooper and is certain to resonate somewhere deep within the human psyche as long as stories are told.
I:10;4038;I think it is safe to say that the original King Kong is a classic.
I:10;4039;It is in a class all it's own.
I:10;4040;She is just as talented as she is pretty.
I:10;4041;Now, I'm not a big Adrien Brody fan, but in this movie, he does quite well.
I:10;4042;Jack Black does a fantastic job as the cocky, dishonest, unstoppable movie director Carl Denham.
I:10;4043;the special effects are absolutely stunning.
I:10;4044;King Kong is an amazing piece of CGI art.
I:10;4045;The Longneck Stampede scene is phenomenal, though many would beg to differ.
I:10;4046;The Kong vs. 3 T. rex scene was good too.
I:10;4047;the classic scene of Kong fighting the WW1 planes atop the Empire State Building was phenomenal.
I:10;4048;winning director Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) gives new life to the 1933 classic with the stunning big.
I:10;4049;King Kong is an outstanding visually dazzling thrill ride.
I:10;4050;minute remake remains quite faithful to the original film.
I:10;4051;The story feels over the top but certainly engrossing.
I:10;4052;The 2005 adventure film truly grabs the audience with its heart.
I:10;4053;pounding action sequences, good performances, elaborate backgrounds and sensational special effects.
I:10;4054;if you really enjoyed this action.
I:10;4055;Its 5.1 Dolby Digital sound offers a fantastic listening experience.
I:10;4056;The story of King Kong is a classic piece of American Cinema.
I:10;4057;Peter Jackson has stated in the past that he grew up with a deep.
I:10;4058;seated love and adoration of the original King Kong from the early 1930's.
I:10;4059;Yes, Peter Jackson was probally one of the best things about this film.
I:10;4060;He may make very long movies, but at least they are also very entertaining and engrossing movies.
I:10;4061;"Even with the footage some might call ""unnecesary"", I still found very much to appreciate in the story."
I:10;4062;it was fresh and exciting for me to see Kong done so realistically, with modern technology (before it took over Hollywood).
I:10;4063;Kong himself, is so realistic, I had a hard time getting over how beautifully he was created.
I:10;4064;Everything from a wound he got in battle, to wet fur was gorgeous.
I:10;4065;I also have to say that I was pleasantly surprised to see Jack Black in a more serious role.
I:10;4066;Some may disagree with me, but I think he did a fine job.
I:10;4067;None of the actors are more intriguing than Kong though.
I:10;4068;So while King Kong is far from a perfect film, I believe Peter Jackson and his team did a fantastic job of bringing this classic to a modern audience.
I:10;4069;It truly is one of the pinnacles of the media format, and would (did) serves as a terrific reference disc.
I:10;4070;So I'll definitely be holding onto my 3.
I:10;4071;A super colossal screen spectacle.
I:10;4072;"The makeup and special effects are top rate, even haunting at times
I:10;4073;"Very touching at times, this Kong probably garners more sympathy than previous screen Kongs, and the New York scenes will keep you guessing
I:10;4074;Very well done, but not quite the box office runaway that was expected.
I:10;4075;I am capable of liking and admiring movies of all shapes and sizes.
I:10;4076;But sometimes nothing fits the bill for movie thrills better than an outstanding, outsized epic.
I:10;4077;It satisfies on a visceral, action.
I:10;4078;It pleases those who appreciate good acting and directing.
I:10;4079;But if I've been immersed in a world so thoroughly conceived and presented, populuated by people who are interesting to know and engaged in a plot that is told in a gut.
I:10;4080;But I will touch on some key elements.
I:10;4081;First of all, the special effects are special.
I:10;4082;In the opening scenes, and in the big finale, NYC is beautifully rendered.
I:10;4083;i doubt we'll see it so loving done again.
I:10;4084;it makes you hold your breath.
I:10;4085;Later, the sequence a top the Empire State Building is damn near perfect.
I:10;4086;But overall, this is some of the best stuff ever.
I:10;4087;Kong himself is simply great.
I:10;4088;which was smaller than I thought it would be, but well done.
I:10;4089;"Kyle Chandler has a smallish role as the ""star"" of Black's new film, and he's really funny."
I:10;4090;every scene she plays is done with whole.
I:10;4091;It all feels completely authentic.
I:10;4092;which for such an outrageous story is pretty amazing.
I:10;4093;"She feels like an ""old."
I:10;4094;also, the scene on a frozen pond in Central Park is brilliant.
I:10;4095;But it rewards with so many riches.
I:10;4096;And I even caught myself literally on the edge of my seat.
I:10;4097;"i'm far to ""cool"" to get that caught up in a film."
I:10;4098;but the epic KONG made me feel like a kid at his first movie again.
I:10;4099;Thanks, Peter Jackson, for that feeling.
I:10;4100;King Kong is not scary, he's kind of cuddly.
I:10;4101;Just give me a good story, good script, and good acting.
I:10;4102;For diversion, though, I did enjoy it.
I:10;4103;And, aside from one other change, the resulting product is remarkably faithful to Cooper's original film, but is, in every respect, bigger.
I:10;4104;The effects are wonderful, and since this is a movie whose main attraction is the effects (and always was, even in 1933), that's the strongest recommendation I can give it.
I:10;4105;This makes perfect sense given the attitude of humans towards animals in the two time frames when these two versions of the film were made.
I:10;4106;This change in Darrow's character makes perfect sense, and for most of the film's length, I was all set to say that it's one of the changes that make this a better film than the original.
I:10;4107;It was beauty killed the beast.
I:10;4108;In one of the most memorable scenes form the original film, Kong, loose in New York, finds Ann Darrow and abducts her.
I:10;4109;All well and good, but it's Darrow's resistance, at least in part, that brings about Kong's death.
I:10;4110;"foot ape with her body is ludicrous in the extreme, but it somehow works here
I:10;4111;Adrien Brody is a good actor, but he takes the most godawful roles.
I:10;4112;The start's a little slow, yeah, but once you get into it, wow.
I:10;4113;Jackson does, most certainly, still know how to direct a monster movie.
I:10;4114;And, with a few missteps, he certainly did a fine job on this one.
I:10;4115;It takes an hour and ten minutes to see the monkey.
I:10;4116;"The CGI effects are good, but not perfect
I:10;4117;Kong, however, is very well done.
I:10;4118;The best example of this would have to be the Kong vs T. rex trifecta.
I:10;4119;the first part, realism within the film, is often referred to as suspension of disbelief.
I:10;4120;"Now, some people keep saying ""King Kong is a FANTASY movie"" and believe that that suffices."
I:10;4121;But Star Wars IS a fantasy movie, and it has an explanation WITHIN THE FILM, 'the Force' and the fact that the characters in these amazing light saber duels are trained in it, allowing them to defy gravity, block shots from laser pistols, etc.
I:10;4122;Yes, the Force doesn't exist in our world, but if you accept that it does in Star Wars, the movies are relatively consistent with this premise.
I:10;4123;there WERE moments that made me remember this was the same director that created such a visual masterpiece in Lord of the Rings, such as the first imagery of Kong after his capture having exactly the right impact: the unthinking masses thinking he looked so amazing while the viewer is struck by how pathetic he looks compared to when he was free.
I:10;4124;i think the true problem is, Peter Jackson is perfectly suited to creating epic films and perhaps is unable to _not_ film every scene as if it's a potentially world shattering moment.
I:10;4125;Lord of the Rings was an epic story, and as such benefited from this kind of attention.
I:10;4126;The first hour is slow but once Skull Island is reached, Kong provides us with one thrill after another.
I:10;4127;It is the greatest fight between creatures ever captured on film.
I:10;4128;the fight with the T. rexes is incredible and Kong shows why he is king of that island.
I:10;4129;The effects are terrific and when Kong ends up one on one with the lone surviving T. rex, he approaches the beast with a huge roar, beating his chest, immediately seizing the Rex by the jaws and after struggling, kills him in identical fashion to the original.
I:10;4130;He then stands atop the final and finally dead T. rex and beats his chest, roaring his triumph for all to hear.
I:10;4131;a great remake with good but not great casting, I rate it five stars because the action (especially the fight and the scene in the darkness under the fallen log) is superb.
I:10;4132;I think this remake takes the crown for two reasons: it is a very good movie in its own right and it is a remake of an undisputed classic.
I:10;4133;This version is incredibly respectful of the original, sets the action at the time of the original, and constantly makes references to it.
I:10;4134;Then, he reaches under the jaw and flips it up a couple of times.
I:10;4135;i'm going to be honest.
I:10;4136;This was for me the most purely entertaining movie of 2005.
I:10;4137;The set and art design is perfect, the special effects are off the chart, and even the clothing is great.
I:10;4138;Every shot in the entire film is just a delight to look at, from the shots of the docks and boat at the beginning to Skull Island to the wonderful shots in the jungle to the final scenes in 1930s New York.
I:10;4139;It is filled with special effects, but unlike a George Lucas film where the special effects call attention to themselves, here they are subservient to the story.
I:10;4140;, he plays Carl Denham with enthusiasm and energy.
I:10;4141;Adrian Brody is serviceable as Jack Driscoll (played by Bruce Cabot in the original), as are all of the supporting cast members.
I:10;4142;"But the person who steals the film by doing a very believable turn as ""the most adorable woman in the world"" is Naomi Watts."
I:10;4143;I have always liked Watts, but I had absolutely no conception that she could be this irresistible or this astonishingly gorgeous.
I:10;4144;Although everything is very well done in the film from the photography to the design to the direction to the CGI, without Naomi Watts and the clear, blue.
I:10;4145;eyed beauty of her face, it wouldn't have been the film that it turned out to be.
I:10;4146;one of the great achievements of the CGI age of film.
I:10;4147;The bond between Ann and Kong is reinforced at the end of the movie.
I:10;4148;In one of the few completely original scenes in the remake, Kong and Ann find a few moments to recapture the friendship they established in the jungle when they slide around on a frozen pond in Central Park.
I:10;4149;I think that in all this the new film greatly improves on the original.
I:10;4150;I suspect that there are many others and many may share my earlier antipathy to seeing a remake of such a familiar movie.
I:10;4151;It truly is one of the great remakes in film history, if not the greatest.
I:10;4152;I won't say this was the best movie I saw in 2005, but it was the most entertaining.
I:10;4153;It was the most powerful connection, I think, between a structure and a city and a fictional character that the 20th century had ever seen.
I:10;4154;"of all the ""King Kong"" films that exist, Peter Jackson's new Kong is, without any doubt, the best."
I:10;4155;The film won 3 Oscars, for sound editing, sound mixing, and visual effects.
I:10;4156;He recreates a chaotic, crazy, busy city bustling and vibrant.
I:10;4157;The streets were absolutely jam packed with cars, trams, buses, crowded with hawkers and thousands of people .
I:10;4158;The amount of imagination and creativity that went into the ideas behind it is quite amazing.
I:10;4159;King Kong delivers a fantasy.
I:10;4160;"adventure piece, with its balance of peril and romance in much the same way ""Titanic"" did."
I:10;4161;And this union is the finest moment of the film.
I:10;4162;Jackson has done something emotional here.
I:10;4163;In addition to the ape's beastly character, Kong gazes at Ann and shows true, endearing traits.
I:10;4164;The special effects and take on Kong are incredible.
I:10;4165;As Ann Darrow, Naomi Watts was phenomenal.
I:10;4166;And I loved the moments where Kong treated Ann like a rag doll.
I:10;4167;Past versions of Kong always had the ape treat Ann with respect and awe immediately.
I:10;4168;Oh, and Jack Black does a fine job of channeling Orson Wells as a driven (mad?)
I:10;4169;The last time I saw this much attention to detail in a film was the boat in Titanic.
I:10;4170;I love a long movie if there is enough story to support it.
I:10;4171;These are wonderful stories that need 3 plus hours to tell.
I:10;4172;Trim away the excess and this King Kong will be the classic he wanted it to be.
I:10;4173;King Kong is one of the best movies of 2005 as Peter Jackson gives an excellent follow.
I:10;4174;up to his wildly successful Lord of the Rings series.
I:10;4175;This movie takes full advantage of special effects and other technology to bring Kong to life as well as some other creatures.
I:10;4176;With excellent lead performances and beautiful scenery and shots, King Kong is a needed remake of the 1933 classic.
I:10;4177;naomi Watts is outstanding as Ann Darrow, a struggling actress who accepts the lead role in Carl Denham's new picture.
I:10;4178;The two form a surprisingly close bond.
I:10;4179;Andy Serkis, who used motion capture technology to play Gollum in the Lord of the Rings, makes another excellent performance playing Kong.
I:10;4180;He captures the ape's emotions wonderfully, especially when he laughs at Ann's Vaudeville routine.
I:10;4181;this film is one of the most beautifully shot films I have ever seen.
I:10;4182;These beautiful shots are completed by surprisingly moving moments, like when Kong and Ann watch a sunset from a high cliff, or when they share their final moment together on the Empire State Building, where Kong is trying to protect her from her own species.
I:10;4183;The end is heartbreaking, with Naomi Watts playing the best few minutes of running time in her career.
I:10;4184;peter Jackson does an excellent job bringing Kong to life in this remake of the 1933 classic.
I:10;4185;The performances and scenery are great, there are enough creepy creatures and action scenes to keep us on the edge of our seats, and there are enough tender moments to strengthen the emotional relationship between King Kong and Ann.
I:10;4186;This ultimate adventure, one of the few worthy remakes of a classic, is just about perfect.
I:10;4187;literally fantastic story and astonishing images.
I:10;4188;Plus Kong, a great primeval beast that evokes fear, wonder and empathy.
I:10;4189;there's an amazing commentary that is actually worth listening to.
I:10;4190;And a slew of informative extras.
I:10;4191;"ray version is not only the ""eighth wonder of the world"" but a wonder of filmmaking."
I:10;4192;Some of the best special effects you will ever see.
I:10;4193;The script wasn't as good as it could have been, but it's a very powerful emotional film and that sort of makes up for a great deal of that.
I:10;4194;This movie shows a good, but brief love between King and Watts.
I:10;4195;It reflects how some real relationships can work.
I:10;4196;Despite him making a huge mess and destroying everything, she is able to the good in King as he shows he will go to any lengths to keep her out of harms way.
I:10;4197;And the relationship between the two really pulls you into the film.
I:10;4198;Many people who want to see the movie are actually looking for its special effects.
I:10;4199;Like Spiderman, Batman, Hulk, War of the worlds, everyone knows the story.
I:10;4200;Talking about shooting, the position of the camera and the movements are always so good.
I:10;4201;nobody including An Lee and Steven Spielberg can beat him in terms of the shooting skills and creation of fine art pictures.
I:10;4202;ink drawings or the quiet period in classical music.
I:10;4203;It just gives time to fullfill the characters and tell all the details of the story.
I:10;4204;If you really like to get involved into the fair tale story then you will understand his effort to make you in the fantacy world.
I:10;4205;"***1/2With this second remake of the 1933 classic, ""King Kong,"" director Peter Jackson seems to have forgotten the cardinal rule of the monster movie genre: keep it simple and keep it short."
I:10;4206;some of those parts are so absolutely extraordinary that I find myself strongly recommending that people go see it despite any reservations I might have about the film overall.
I:10;4207;cheek dialogue and its winking.
I:10;4208;But it is in the final third of the film that the elements really come together and the movie approaches something akin to greatness.
I:10;4209;popping and beautiful to behold.
I:10;4210;Much of the credit for the emotional wallop in the film's final act goes to Naomi Watts whose lovely performance, coupled with the beautifully expressive face of the computer.
I:10;4211;generated Kong, convinces us that there is a genuine love and attraction between this beauty and this beast.
I:10;4212;The nice thing about this section of the movie is that the special effects, spectacular and breathtaking as they are, are primarily there to serve the human interest aspect of the story, a rarity in any film in which FX play such a crucial part.
I:10;4213;It's small wonder that her romance with the ape is more compelling and convincing than the one with Jack.
I:10;4214;Jack Black gives a wildly uneven performance, but he does engage our interest occasionally so he deserves some credit for that.
I:10;4215;The first is tedious and dull, the second occasionally gripping but far too repetitious, and the third absolutely smashing and spectacular.
I:10;4216;I can watch this movie over and over and still enjoy it.
I:10;4217;"By putting together a stellar team of creatives, and actors, Jackson has turned a ""B pic"" cult movie into a ""A class"" film."
I:10;4218;Turning that gorilla into a sympathetic character is a seemingly impossible task.
I:10;4219;Jackson carefully crafted a story line depicting a lonely giant that has a gentle side.
I:10;4220;Part of this gentle side is love of beauty.
I:10;4221;Whether it is Naomi Watts character, or a beautiful sunset.
I:10;4222;This drive turns the monster into a sympathetic character.
I:10;4223;special attention should be given to the direction of the story boarding.
I:10;4224;Few films have demonstrated such frame by frame compositional perfection.
I:10;4225;then there is the look of the film, which carefully recreates the depression era.
I:10;4226;Exceptional scene lighting sets the mood together with a subtle music score.
I:10;4227;Naomi Watts is exceptional as the lead Ann Darrow, both in look and acting ability.
I:10;4228;This is, without a doubt, the most important casting choice of the movie.
I:10;4229;The other part of this unusual(?)
I:10;4230;relationship was brilliantly achieved, via the efforts of Andy Serkis.
I:10;4231;Serkis acted out the role of Kong, just as he did Golem in Lord of the Rings.
I:10;4232;the rest of the cast is similarly effective both in looking the part and in acting ability.
I:10;4233;this kind of depth of talent on both the acting side, and the creative, is rare.
I:10;4234;This group did just that, and in doing so, created a genre masterpiece.
I:10;4235;The scenery was amazing, and the basic story was well done.
I:10;4236;Simply a visual and emotional spectacle.
I:10;4237;Jackson's Kong puts new life into a classic story of Beauty and the Beast.
I:10;4238;At first I was worried that doing a remake of King Kong might ruin the original but this generation really proved itself worthy.
I:10;4239;Worth seeing, but Ive got to give it a thumbs down.
I:10;4240;"The things I liked about ""King Kong"" were the dazzling special effects and the personification of Kong."
I:10;4241;winning director carte blanche to do whatever he wants to do.
I:10;4242;i liked the budding relationship between Ann Darrow and Kong during the second hour.
I:10;4243;King Kong could've been a much more stronger and powerful movie if the film editors had done their jobs.
I:10;4244;But because I enjoyed the special effects and the personification of Kong, I decided to give it 2 stars.
I:10;4245;still good, not as much thrill.
I:10;4246;The acting in this movie is outstanding.
I:10;4247;The whole Island is a masterpiece is it's own way (Watch Special Features).
I:10;4248;This is a pretty cool movie, great special effects, and Jack Black and Adrien Brody are both awesome in it, but does it really need to be 3 hours long?
I:10;4249;The characters were all very well developed, the storyline nicely enhanced, and the emotional range of this timeless story was beautifully executed.
I:10;4250;Of course Kong and Naomi Watts are the star attractions here, and they are mesmerizing and, yes, heartbreaking together.
I:10;4251;"headlights performance
I:10;4252;"But Kong is a miracle of CGI
I:10;4253;And Naomi Watts is luminous, and does perhaps the best job ever on film of someone working against a blue screen .
I:10;4254;the alliance these two improbable creatures form is as surprisingly stirring as it is fantastic.
I:10;4255;king Kong is (above and beyond all the action and CGI) a love story.
I:10;4256;the movie begins with aspiring actress Ann Darrow (played by the ethereal and spot.
I:10;4257;peter Jackson (The Lord Of The Rings) has created another epic cinematic acheivement with Kong.
I:10;4258;The film is action packed.
I:10;4259;but, underneath all of the action, adventure and CGI effects, the best part of this film is the relationship between Ann and Kong.
I:10;4260;naomi Watts does an excellent job building her friendship and love for Kong.
I:10;4261;She geniously plays Ann with a mixture of whimsy, grace and innocence.
I:10;4262;Her belief in destiny and fate lead her emotions throughout the film, and that is truly a beautiful thing to see.
I:10;4263;another interesing part of the movie was the budding romance between Jack and Ann.
I:10;4264;screen and theater writer with a very authentic 1940's feel.
I:10;4265;Jack and Ann share an obvious romance almost from the start, which adds a love.
I:10;4266;As a viewer, we are exposed to one woman's reaction to this.
I:10;4267;the two characters soon share a bond so strong that it can only be defeated by death.
I:10;4268;Ann and Kong's love story will bring some viewers to there knees sobbing.
I:10;4269;You will smile as the Beauty and her beast share a heartfelt moment sliding on the ice in central park.
I:10;4270;You will gasp as Kong is pelted with bullets but still manages to protect his beloved Ann.
I:10;4271;James Newton Howard does a great job, especially at the more profound moments in the movie.
I:10;4272;I am a loyal customer for life.
I:10;4273;Lots of reviews, so I can add little.
I:10;4274;type scenery, directing, acting, mood, and music throughout, but especially on Skull Island.
I:10;4275;Kong's battle with THREE T. Rex was the best, with the meeting of the ship's crew with the natives the second.
I:10;4276;See it AFTER you see the film, but do see it!
I:10;4277;I just watched Peter Jackson's King Kong for the 2nd time and really enjoyed it.
I:10;4278;I think after the 2nd viewing Peter Jackson's King Kong just works it's way into your heart.
I:10;4279;I bought the 3 disc version and enjoyed seeing how the movie was made.
I:10;4280;king Kong is the star of this movie.
I:10;4281;I love Jack Black's portrail of Carl Denham.
I:10;4282;I think in time this movie will be a classic.
I:10;4283;"It all hinges on whether or not you can believe that such a savage ""creature"" can actually fall in love with a beautiful woman and that she can love him, too."
I:10;4284;By the end of this 3 hour plus film you will be brought to tears if you have a heart.
I:10;4285;Peter Jackson pushes emotional buttons in much the way he did in the Lord of the Rings films so when you watch expect to gripped in a way only he can.
I:10;4286;naomi Watts does a good job of showing her love for Kong in a way similar to the story of Beauty and the Beast.
I:10;4287;In fact the way this version of King Kong is put together does have some elements of Beauty and the Beast with Kong being tamed by a beautiful woman and a score of men hunting the beast because they fear him.
I:10;4288;When that bombs with the death of several crew members and finally the destruction of the camera he hatches a scheme to capture Kong again for the sake of greed.
I:10;4289;It is a solid 4 stars out of 5.
I:10;4290;disc edition is worth it .
I:10;4291;way through the Production Diaries on disc 2 and am so glad I sprung for it .
I:10;4292;Kong is so real and convincing.
I:10;4293;the ending will break your heart everytime.
I:10;4294;Including the point where Peter Jackson tells you this is the end of commentary on the first disc, and a few seconds later starts with welcome back to the commentary, I hope you had some time to fix yourself a cup of tea.
I:10;4295;I'm the kind of person likes to play behind.
I:10;4296;HE HAS DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE!
I:10;4297;Peter Jackson's take on King Kong is the best moviegoing experience I've had this year.
I:10;4298;"In the past I've been on the fence about her, not feeling she truly deserved her ""star"" status."
I:10;4299;Not only is she down right gorgeous but she acts her heart out, presenting the greatest display of onscreen make believe I've ever witnessed.
I:10;4300;They may as well just give King Kong the Oscar for that category.
I:10;4301;This is a creature fest of epic (and by epic I mean huge) proportions.
I:10;4302;Dinosaurs, insects, arachnids, and bats.
I:10;4303;Make no mistake, King Kong is a film hybrid that rings of purity, an action yarn, a love story, an ode to the past, all wrapped in a horror movie shell.
I:10;4304;While you won't believe everything you see in King Kong (and you shouldn't) you will believe in a good 90 percent.
I:10;4305;1930's New York is eerily realistic and Kong is just, well Kong is just real.3.
I:10;4306;One big monkey that somehow manages to simultaneously awe, frighten, and convey intelligence and nobility.
I:10;4307;This King Kong is the best of the bunch.
I:10;4308;The combination of motion capture with CGI is the best innovation to film in the past twenty years and Peter Jackson is it's reigning champion.
I:10;4309;His reliance on the intuition and observation skills of Serkis is amply and beautifully rewarded.
I:10;4310;When the king of Skull Island is enraged we're furious right along with him, when he's amused we're chuckling as well.
I:10;4311;much has been said and written about how the original King Kong inspired Peter Jackson to pursue film making as his career.
I:10;4312;Perhaps in this speculative future dictionaries will be graced with poster art from this film right next to one word: Spectacle.
I:10;4313;Whatever the ticket price you will be exponentially rewarded in entertainment value.
I:10;4314;Even the special effects get tedious, just giant stuff just keeps attacking people and that's the movie they don't even make it very exciting.
I:10;4315;There's about 10 people on the ship and then the number keeps changing, people and people who get killed just randomly reappear in the film.
I:10;4316;One of my favorite Movies.
I:10;4317;Anyway I loved this movie so well!
I:10;4318;King Kong is so good.
I:10;4319;It's (PUN ALERT) a ape of a movie!
I:10;4320;It's like climbing and surviving the fall of the Empire State Building and winning million $ and All King Kong Movies!
I:10;4321;"The extras are pretty much complete and you also get a ""director's cut"" of the movie."
I:10;4322;"Unlike the long versions of the LOtR's films, this is a true ""director's cut"" ."
I:10;4323;Being a kid at heart, I welcome the extra dino.
I:10;4324;Kong himself benefits from the extreme compression of a television screen, looking far more convincing than he did on the big screen.
I:10;4325;The film is also packed to the gills with references to the original Kong and the 1976 remake (which I recommend).
I:10;4326;Overall, for Peter Jackson fans or King Kong collectors, this is worth the price tag.
I:10;4327;For everyone else: stick to the 1933 original, which kids and adults still love!
I:10;4328;One of my absolute favourite movies of all time and my best movie of 2005.
I:10;4329;Hands down, my best cinematic experience so far.
I:10;4330;it is a visual delight, an edge of your seat thriller, a love story of every sort and a laugh out loud comedy all rolled into one marvellous package.
I:10;4331;peter Jackson is a genius.
I:10;4332;Peter Jackson is the new Steven Spielberg.
I:10;4333;In Kong, she shines like a true star.
I:10;4334;She is beautiful physically and in her spirit and actively so.
I:10;4335;adrien Brody does an expected and usual fine job of being the noble, quiet and brave hero.
I:10;4336;He is a hero and I love watching his love for Ann Darrow develop and blossom.
I:10;4337;His protectiveness is so endearing and the scene where Ann Darrow seeks his protection from the dinosaurs and Kong goes into alpha male mode shredding the dinosaurs to pieces is one of the highlights of the movie.
I:10;4338;i am very impressed by how tactfully and tastefully the relationship between Anna and Kong is treated.
I:10;4339;drenched culture it could have easily degenerated into something perverse but it is instead sweet and affectionate.
I:10;4340;any movie starring the very talented Jamie Bell is always worth my while even though he got nothing more than a bit part.
I:10;4341;& Andy Serkus is awesome .
I:10;4342;more than believable, he's heart.
I:10;4343;His is the gargantuan soul of this larger.
I:10;4344;the cast is very good.
I:10;4345;this film is visually quite beautiful.
I:10;4346;The New York scenes, the island scenes, and the scenes on the ocean are all rather breath.
I:10;4347;peter Jackson was a fan of the original King Kong and made this film to pay tribute.
I:10;4348;The beauty of classic cinema is that so much is said in such a short span of time.
I:10;4349;He's becoming the Babe Ruth of modern filmmaking, and his short porch in right field are all manners of beast and action.
I:10;4350;"the original ""Kong"" served as Jackson's Gatsby light, his muse and motivation, and his remake shoots for the moon, opening with a effective montage of Depression."
I:10;4351;Made on a computer but as real as he can look .
I:10;4352;The toll shows, and Ann, once she is delivered to Kong by the possessed natives, is a calm gem in the midst of chaos.
I:10;4353;The crucial and best change that Jackson inserts into his movie is that Ann, already established as a great girl with pride but diminished self.
I:10;4354;esteem, sees something worthwhile in Kong, too.
I:10;4355;rimmed eyes, small mouth and uncertain voice, was born to sell Ann's transformation, and so this touch really works .
I:10;4356;"There is a battle in ""King Kong"" you have to see to believe and enjoy, between Kong and dinosaurs, fought on several terrains ."
I:10;4357;that is endlessly inventive, furious and downright cool.
I:10;4358;Kong's capture, concocted by Denham, is epic and movie's saddest moment.
I:10;4359;After seeing such wonders, to be driven by dollars, Denham finally passes the rubicon of decency he's been walking beside the entire movie.
I:10;4360;the final set piece returns to New York, for the premiere of the beast and his eventual death atop the Empire State Building.
I:10;4361;Maybe, but it denies him the raw, powerful ending that would have sent audiences out of theater with a jolt.
I:10;4362;kong really is the star, but Watts makes a great damsel, distressed or not.
I:10;4363;She's tough, soulful, principled, a real cutie .
I:10;4364;Watts will make many a teen boy crush on her now, for the right movie and the right reasons.
I:10;4365;Brody is well cast because we aren't expecting Driscoll to be a hero, and Black reveals a previously unknown side, a kind of imprinted ruthlessness that show business breeds in a person.
I:10;4366;He crosses over here, like Jim Carrey has.
I:10;4367;King Kong will get serious awards consideration, and deservedly so .
I:10;4368;The movie has enough heart for the ladies, every last special effect for the guys, and while flawed, it's never feeble.
I:10;4369;A wonderful movie acitoin packed if touching moments.
I:10;4370;It was a gift and my nephew loved it.
I:10;4371;It was well worth the price.
I:10;4372;Which I got for a great deal.
I:10;4373;the film itself is stunning, a major feat of film making prowess.
I:10;4374;I am very impressed with Peter Jackson's remake of KING KONG.
I:10;4375;He captured the correct essence of the characters while remaining true and capturing the essence of the old 1933 classic.
I:10;4376;"With stunning visual effects and cinematography
I:10;4377;"film maker' and his crew travel to shoot a motion picture turns out to be a place of horror
I:10;4378;naomi Watts and Adrian Brody who do outstanding work, and Jack Black who plays the 'eccentric director' is very humorous as he is obsessed with shooting his film so that he will just about risk anything to get a good shot.
I:10;4379;"it's a great movie with a great cast and screen play
I:10;4380;but definitely worth your time.
I:10;4381;I really enjoyed this movie, but I was actually looking forward to the usual Peter Jackson behing.
I:10;4382;The pictures and the acting performances are perfect and it is difficult to believe, that Kong isn't a real gorilla.
I:10;4383;Undoubtedly the movie is great to watch, but personally I believe the story of King Kong isn't interesting enough to make a blockbuster out of it.
I:10;4384;Yesterday after a lot of coaxing and grueling by my better half and friends I finally decided to go watch the supposed box office buster this year.
I:10;4385;Oh, the movie frenzy that can be brought about by a million dollar worth advertising campaign!
I:10;4386;King Kong the official game of the movie!
I:10;4387;"Having arrived early (groans) gives you the wonderful opportunity to watch meaningless trivia and exciting hospital ads on a really big screen ""Man, what a treat!"""
I:10;4388;But it's a good tip for you late comers.
I:10;4389;Also, it really helps you get a better perspective on to what lengths man is willing to go in order to conquer AND keep a good seat.
I:10;4390;Sigh, such singular dedication towards a really `meaningful' cause I observed.
I:10;4391;At least, now in the darkness of the theatre, I could take a short and a much needed nap I thought.
I:10;4392;The director gradually unfolds the setting of the movie in this sequence, deliberately drawing you into the early 1930s and the basic lifestyle of that time period.
I:10;4393;By clever compilation of selected movie clips that summarize the environment, people's attitude, clothing style, architecture and so on the director gives you a brief insight of New York during the time of the Great Depression.
I:10;4394;It was amazing how in such a short time he was able to transfer many levels of information to the audience.
I:10;4395;Yes, he also introduces the protagonist (or in this case Kong's one true love) Naomi Watts during this sequence, efficiently disclosing her profession and also to some extent her financial crisis.
I:10;4396;The background music for the title sequence sets a tone to the movie and is very 1930s.
I:10;4397;She is depicted as a complex mixture of both vulnerability and courage.
I:10;4398;The director also carefully chose her attire and make.
I:10;4399;up style that give her a rather soft and tender look, I thought.
I:10;4400;by now, the audience loved this sweet girl who displayed great emotional strength in such hard times.
I:10;4401;I guess that statement in the very beginning sets the flavor and spirit for this movie.
I:10;4402;Personally I think that his performance was by far the most excellent and unpredictable.
I:10;4403;Moreover, the director's surreal cinematography in some instances of the movie adds to the mystery behind the Skull Island.
I:10;4404;I have seen movies with wonderful direction, performances and special effects before, how was this movie any more significant from the other good movies?
I:10;4405;indeed, good things always come to an end(sighs).
I:10;4406;This is by far my favorite version of the King Kong story .
I:10;4407;AND, the price was right.
I:10;4408;This movie was well worth the 3 hours which passed by quickly.
I:10;4409;I usually wouldn't even bother to view flicks like that, but based on the reviews and previews/trailer this film looked interesting and it fully delivered on the promise.
I:10;4410;The CGI effects are well applied and it's just phantastic how they produced such an authentic motion picture.
I:10;4411;jack Black also delivers as an actor and does an excellent job.
I:10;4412;The moods are captured well and all the details seem to have been a lot of work and you can tell that craftsmen were at work here.
I:10;4413;This is a classic motion picture so to speak, or it will become one, and it's a cinematic experience so rare these days.
I:10;4414;Peter Jackson wanted to make this movie, for his whole life and it really shows.
I:10;4415;"He has remained as true to the original story as possible, while still making it enjoyable to today's ""Smash Bomb"" audience, with more action but, important classic scenes intact."
I:10;4416;The acting is great, even though Jack Black is a weird choice to play Denham, he's believable enough.
I:10;4417;disc Special Edition, which also has a free comic book inside!
I:10;4418;once the intrepid rescuers go through the door, they are armed with machine guns.
I:10;4419;"And I loved it when the dinos stack up like police cars in a ""Blues Brothers"" movie."
I:10;4420;Jackson spends all this time trying to capture the flavor and feel of 1930's New York, and does well at it.
I:10;4421;and after the success of LOTR, you have to wonder if anyone close to Jackson has enough nerve to say to him .
I:10;4422;And Lo, The beast looked into the eyes of beauty, and Beauty stayed his hand.
I:10;4423;after seeing the first King Kong i doubted that this would be good.
I:10;4424;I found my self crying and applauding at the end.
I:10;4425;The actors all do very well and the graphics are great.
I:10;4426;the music is also something to look forward to.
I:10;4427;one thing that i do love about the movie is that Kong has a heart.
I:10;4428;it is the best and i am sad that there are only 5 stars because it needs a 10.
I:10;4429;the music is the best part though.
I:10;4430;but, Carl's eyebrows are pretty cool too.
I:10;4431;Sometimes, though, improved scenery and realism in the effects, and adding more material, just plain gets in the way of what is, was, and always will remain, a simple story that succeeds BECAUSE it's simple.
I:10;4432;"for the most part, Jackson's ""King Kong"" is refreshing."
I:10;4433;I love the original because it tried to tell an adventure story that mingles reality with fantasy.
I:10;4434;one can see how they slaved over the digital shots to make them fit into reality.
I:10;4435;If the story is well.
I:10;4436;told, we're willing to sit through character development and genuine emotion.
I:10;4437;In showing us a sweet, platonic, and doomed connection between human woman and giant male ape, Jackson gives us a payoff the original only hinted at.Yet when we see this over three.
I:10;4438;all and all though, the Extended Cut IS interesting.
I:10;4439;It makes the whole thing worthwhile in the end.
I:10;4440;And I'll be honest .
I:10;4441;I'd rather see the complete vision of the storytellers the first time around anyway.
I:10;4442;First and foremost, the original 1933 version of King Kong stillstands as the quintessential monster movie.
I:10;4443;The special effectsare still unsurpassed, realistic and wrenching.
I:10;4444;The cast is perfect, especially Fay Wray who by herself invented the movie scream.
I:10;4445;the fact that the original is seen in glorious black and white adds to the films moodiness and mystery.
I:10;4446;this remake, like many others is a classic example of subtraction by addition.
I:10;4447;in my opinion, this is one of the best action films of all time with some scenes that are downright epic in their scale, imagination, and heart.
I:10;4448;i truly love this movie.
I:10;4449;In the theater, the CGI was completely believable.
I:10;4450;"The dramatic effect is severely lessened by the fact that the actors and the creatures appear to be on two separate planes and the creatures look clearly ""drawn."
I:10;4451;Peter Jackson is the best big screen, damn.
I:10;4452;King Kong is a perfect choice for Jackson and his talented crew of actors and behind.
I:10;4453;scenes magicians, particularly his special effects wizards at the Weta Workshop.
I:10;4454;"King Kong presents Jackson with the exact opposite problem that he took on in ""The Lord of the Rings"" ."
I:10;4455;otherwise, here are my thoughts:New York City of the '30s: Both movies handled it great.
I:10;4456;The original, obviously, because it WAS the 1930's when the movie was made.
I:10;4457;But the 2005 version did a great job covering the look and feel of that era in the Big Apple.
I:10;4458;Kong is a huge beast.
I:10;4459;Naomi (coatless) wants to hug his leg to protect him!
I:10;4460;There was a lot of work put into his animation and the other creatures as well.
I:10;4461;ADVANTAGE: 2005 KONGKONG vs the TYRO: The original had a great battle complete with wonderful sound effects as the Tyro whipped his tail about.
I:10;4462;And what a fight it is.
I:10;4463;In that scene you can see the blood streaming from the jaw of the TYRO.
I:10;4464;And tossing the woman to her death that he pulls from an apartment high up in one building?
I:10;4465;Every one of these are scenes that helped make the original as famous as it is.
I:10;4466;This is an easy one.
I:10;4467;The 1933 KONG has one of the greatest soundtracks of all time.
I:10;4468;Mainly because Peter Jackson said he loved the original.
I:10;4469;I totally agree with all the other one star reviews.
I:10;4470;well, last night I got to see King Kong and all I have to say it WOW!
I:10;4471;The CGI is utterly amazing, easily the best in film history.
I:10;4472;Kong looks absolutely stunning though andi s the main star.
I:10;4473;The amount of detail on him is staggering and Andy Serkis did an amazing job with him, his facial expressions are just amazing, major kudos to WETA.
I:10;4474;The story was amazing as well.
I:10;4475;I mean, a love story between a woman and an ape is farfetched, but Jackson made it work, actually he made is work very very well.
I:10;4476;Naomi Watts did a great job as Ann, damn does that woman have a pair of lungs!Peter Jackson loves the original Kong and it shows through here.
I:10;4477;You can tell that he is making a remake of the movie he really loves and frankly, I'm very happy.
I:10;4478;The whole time I was on the edge of my seat and man did this movie tire me out, it had me laughing, on the edge of my seat, sad.
I:10;4479;It messed with my emotions but in the best way possible.
I:10;4480;It's the best movie of 2005 easily and is a movie that needs to be experienced in the theater with an audience.
I:10;4481;gun fire and only hit the monsters, but this is OK because it's part of the film's glorious sense of fun.
I:10;4482;And there may be plenty of ripe dialogue and facial contortion but Jackson puts so much heart into his production that this is perfectly in keeping with the tone of the work.
I:10;4483;Jackson has made a thrilling homage to the original Hollywood blockbuster, while successfully maintaining the emotional core of the plot.
I:10;4484;Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' is to me the best installment by far.
I:10;4485;"from casting to capturing the feel of the 1930s
I:10;4486;Adrien Brody also held his own, but more impressive to me was Naomi Watts.
I:10;4487;the relationship between her and Kong was one that U could 'really' feel, especially in the scenes where he protected her against the wild prehistoric creatures.
I:10;4488;spectacular!Say what U will about Peter Jackson's previous work but I think he deserves an A+ for bringing Kong to life once again.
I:10;4489;In short,the best film of the year!Peter Jackson,director of the well.
I:10;4490;award winning Lord of the Rings trilogy,tackles the incredible story of King Kong in this fabulous second remake of the 1933 original.
I:10;4491;the story is pretty much the same as the original,with Carl denham(played by Jack Black,in a pretty spectacular performance)sailing to what is belived to be a deserted island to film a movie to gain back his reputation.
I:10;4492;eventually,they capture Ann and offer her as a sacrifice to the beast known to all as KongWhat happens after that are the reasons why movies are made!King Kong is by far one of the best movies ever made!It improves on the original,fleshing the story more,making it much more interesting than the original(and making you forget almost completely about the '76 film,if that's what you want to call it).
I:10;4493;naomi Watts is perfect for Ann Darrow.
I:10;4494;jack Black is a very good Carl Denham.
I:10;4495;while I thought Carl was a jerk,taking Kong away from his home,it takes a good actor to make someone who should be likeable like Carl and make him almost completely unlikeable.
I:10;4496;i thought he did well.
I:10;4497;all the minor actors(including Andy Serkis,The Lord of the Ring's Gollum,as the ship's cook)are great as well.
I:10;4498;however,the movie belongs to the man portraying Kong.
I:10;4499;as I want you to know,Andy Serkis also portrays Kong and he does so wonderfully.
I:10;4500;he gives Kong true emotion in one look.
I:10;4501;this guy deserves an Oscar for his performances because he makes the character more interesting thatn the effects.You will love this performance!The visual effects are wonderful.
I:10;4502;weta,who did the Lord of the Rings,continue with Jackson on the effects and surpass their previous efforts with the trilogy.You will be amazed by what you see.
I:10;4503;these are the best effects of the year!The score is great as well.
I:10;4504;james Newton Howard,a great and almost unknown composer,really shined this year,first with Batman Begins and now this.
I:10;4505;flaws?Barely Any!The first twenty minutes were boring,but are neceesary for plot so it's okay and second,sometimes it was hard to take Jack Black seriously,but he shines most of the time so again okay.
I:10;4506;peter Jackson has done it again.
I:10;4507;see this as soon as possible!
I:10;4508;This is an amazing piece of work, the special effects are simply spectacular and the digital King Kong has to be seen to believe, I mean his fur even rustles the wind.
I:10;4509;Black was an odd choice, but he works here, sort of.
I:10;4510;stories and silly stories in the new Kong that you have to pinch yourself and remember there was a great original one way back in 1933.
I:10;4511;Still, there are some wonderful scenes in this movie.
I:10;4512;Jackson is a master with CGI (which is why I'm giving this 2 stars), and the monkey is incredible, as are the bugs and other monsters.
I:10;4513;Excepting Black, the cast is fine.
I:10;4514;The audience I saw this with laughed out loud at this moment.
I:10;4515;I had serious high hopes for this film.
I:10;4516;Thank you, that is all.
I:10;4517;I had seen this movie before and wanted to see it again.
I:10;4518;It's the best of the King Kong movies!
I:10;4519;Strong,Powerful and Mighty King Hong is back and back with a vengeance.
I:10;4520;With the help of some great special effects.
I:10;4521;This King Hong is based on the 1933 original classic King Hong.
I:10;4522;There was one also made in 1976.
I:10;4523;So that makes this the third and probably the last one.
I:10;4524;"and at the same time managing to save beauty""s life."
I:10;4525;is that any way to treat a king?
I:10;4526;But Hong does manages to escape his captives and brings all sorts of havoc down on the good citizens of New York City.
I:10;4527;now beauty does show some compassion for Hong.
I:10;4528;"well maybe it""s as they say ""It""s better to have loved and lost,than never to have loved at all""."
I:10;4529;This is a grand entertainment which represents the finest tribute to the original 1933 film KING KONG ever attempted by a long way.
I:10;4530;It is a great ride on its own merits and a fine work of mainstream movie magic.
I:10;4531;but by the mesmerizing, lovely, sexy, sweet, sincere and wholely seductive Naomi Watts.
I:10;4532;i do wholeheartedly recommend Peter Jackson's unreservedly ambitious, all.
I:10;4533;Every element found here is found in Lord of the Rings.
I:10;4534;"'King Kong is the just like the ring
I:10;4535;this kind of computer animation is a throwback to films from the 1980s, like the Disney film TRON.
I:10;4536;most people prefer to see the special features!!!
I:10;4537;Thank you for your prompt service.
I:10;4538;I enjoy doing business with Amazon and will continue to do so.
I:10;4539;Again, thank you for your service.
I:10;4540;this is the story of a young and beautiful actress named Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts) from the world of vaudeville who finds herself lost in depression.
I:10;4541;ambitious filmmaker Carl Denham (Jack Black) who brings her on an exploratory expedition to a remote island where she finds compassion and the true meaning of humanity with an ape known only as Kong.
I:10;4542;It delivers some truly stunning set pieces, including the attack by the hostile, murderous natives of Skull Island, continuing with a dinosaur rampage and a terrifying tribute to the lost Spider Pit scene from the 1933 original.
I:10;4543;I also loved the period detail of the film, like the reconstruction of 1930's New York.
I:10;4544;when Kong does appear, it is a true wonder to behold.
I:10;4545;Not only is the effect totally convincing (trust me, you will think its' real) but Andy Serkis does a marvellous job of portraying what is, perhaps ironically, the most human character in the film.
I:10;4546;"and shows us that even the most ""beastly"" characters can have gentle qualities."
I:10;4547;naomi Watts is also quite brilliant considering most of the time she is acting with something that isn't really there.
I:10;4548;To watch the friendship develop between human and ape is really very touching.
I:10;4549;i also liked the in.
I:10;4550;jokes and humor in the film brought about by Jack Black .
I:10;4551;there are some lovely asides to the original 1933 King Kong.
I:10;4552;truly a fantastic film, one that deserves to be seen.
I:10;4553;you are truly a master.
I:10;4554;I was really looking forward to it, and I had high expectations that I was afraid wouldn't be met.
I:10;4555;King Kong is a fantastic film.
I:10;4556;The movie has a relentless pace.
I:10;4557;The great thing about Peter Jackson is his willingness to go all out when it comes to action with special effects.
I:10;4558;Not only is he willingly to do this, but he he very competent at it.
I:10;4559;He's very creative when it comes to big action pieces.
I:10;4560;The best one in this film is Kong vs. multiple T. rexes.
I:10;4561;Well, I thought it looked great.
I:10;4562;right after Kong is captured on Skull Island, we cut right to New York.
I:10;4563;This is a good thing.
I:10;4564;Kong's rampage through New York is as cool as any one could ask.
I:10;4565;He throws cars around and smashes stuff.
I:10;4566;There is a somewhat corny scene with Ann on a frozen pond, but it still serves it's purpose well.
I:10;4567;the famous climax atop the Empire State Building is a bit drawn out, but it's so visually spectacular that we can forgive it.
I:10;4568;the brilliance of Kong, is it's epic nature.
I:10;4569;The action is relentless and huge.
I:10;4570;The characters are all developed beyond what they should be.
I:10;4571;Sure, Jackson is gluttunous in his film making, but that is just so friggin fun to watch.
I:10;4572;It is the best movie of the year.
I:10;4573;kong is hugely impressive, this is a spectacular CGI creation and credit to all involved for this aspect of the film.
I:10;4574;Our wonderful heroine (who has kept me watching) is now in serious trouble.
I:10;4575;So far the best thing in the film is the CGI Kong .
I:10;4576;and thats great because if Kong is rubbish then you are in serious trouble.
I:10;4577;Something had to go, and this was it.
I:10;4578;KING KONG is back,even bigger and with more of a sensitive side to him this time around.
I:10;4579;Bottom line King Kong for best actor and almost best movie.
I:10;4580;It was shockingly good for its day.
I:10;4581;make old good movies and make them as good or better.
I:10;4582;That's what this film accomplishes.
I:10;4583;king Kong 2005 (preserved circa 1933 in living color with today's style FX) retains the original's storyline to the tee, but gives this classic a beautiful 21st century treatment.
I:10;4584;The 2005 version of King Kong is as true to the original story as a preservationist could possibly ask, and it keeps the viewer captivated as if seeing the true 8th Wonder of the World for the first time ever.
I:10;4585;All of the impressionable scenes and impressionable lines from the 1933 story are preserved.
I:10;4586;And some great scenes are added that movie magic could not have possibly imagined back when the original was shot.
I:10;4587;From a director that knows how to weave a terrific story.
I:10;4588;This movie was actually good.
I:10;4589;I considered it a love story.
I:10;4590;the ape and ann the way they connected with each other, with words, just security and the sun set was amazing.
I:10;4591;it made me shed a tear.
I:10;4592;In the end, it's Naomi Watts's face.
I:10;4593;It's a pretty face, but there are entire scenes dedicated to her making soulful eyes at Kong, and getting the same in return.
I:10;4594;They hammered at it until you start to wonder if the heroine has, well, certain issues.
I:10;4595;"The ""traffic pileup"" of dinosaurs has to be seen to be believed, and the scene with Kong on ice managed to be genuinely touching and funny."
I:10;4596;Somewhere in here was a great one and a half hour movie.
I:10;4597;the movie is clearly being pitched to kids, and uncritical kids at that.
I:10;4598;An example: when they capture Kong, you are naturally wondering how they are going to manage to get Kong on a ship, and then have the ship survive with an angry Kong inside it for days of voyage.
I:10;4599;In the frantic rush to make Social Commentary (and/or get to the next soulful expression), some wonderful opportunities for genuine storytelling got brushed aside.
I:10;4600;I was just looking for action and adventure, and it had some, but it got, well, Jackson'd to death.
I:10;4601;I will say that their rendention of Skull Island was beautiful.
I:10;4602;The whole movie had beautiful scenery and great special effects.
I:10;4603;including the 8th wonder of the world.
I:10;4604;I found there was too much animation in this movie unlike the 1976 version which didn't contain an animated Kong, making Kong look much more real.
I:10;4605;Congrats to Peter Jackson for his success in making this movie.
I:10;4606;I went to the theatre to see this.
I:10;4607;I gave it three stars for the special affects and Adrien Brody.
I:10;4608;the answer is Peter 'Lord of Ticket Sales' Jackson, and his enviable grasp of story telling and spectacular FX.
I:10;4609;Unlike Michael Bay, who is content with blowing up multi.
I:10;4610;the result is a spectacular action film with enough heart and brains to keep you engaged even when Kong isn't smashing T. rex heads together.
I:10;4611;If action and story don't do it for you then you'll still have the pleasure of seeing Naomi Watts run around in the jungle for 45 minutes wearing nothing but a silk nighty.
I:10;4612;Everyone else gets outdone by the monkey, including oscar winner Adrien Brody.
I:10;4613;a truly action packed film that makes the most of the limited material gleaned from the original.
I:10;4614;but a two disc special edition is available for the fans of featurettes.
I:10;4615;This is the best film in years!
I:10;4616;Way better compared to Steven Spilberg's War of the worlds!
I:10;4617;The special effects are truly amazing!
I:10;4618;I lost my husband's movie and he loves it so I had to go online to replace.
I:10;4619;Great movie, easy to find.
I:10;4620;The good about this movies is the stuff that takes place in New York city and the stuff with Kong.
I:10;4621;The lush greenery, the rotted, decaying logs, the oasis of an undiscovered continent.
I:10;4622;all of those add to the scenery to make it look more realistic than the two previous versions.
I:10;4623;by far, the 2005 version, to me, is the best yet.
I:10;4624;When Peter Jackson announced that Jack Black would play the lead in King Kong I was absolutely mystified.
I:10;4625;his performance, for lack of a better word, distracts from what is one of the most astounding visual achievements in cinematic history.
I:10;4626;The computer generated Kong is totally realistic.
I:10;4627;"The ""love story"" between Kong and Ann Darrow is sweet and believable."
I:10;4628;Naomi Watts is luminous and heartbreaking, quite a feat considering most of her performance was done in front of a bluescreen with no giant ape anywhere nearby.
I:10;4629;the brontosaurus scene is astonishing for its sheer audacity.
I:10;4630;the T. rex scene is one of the great action sequences in history.
I:10;4631;Academy Award winning director Peter Jackson (the Lord Of The Rings trilogy) joins Academy Award winning actor Adrian Brody, Academy Award nominee Naomi Watts, and comedian Jack Black in the heart winning remake of the classic tale of King Kong.
I:10;4632;All that the director wants is to capture scenes from this island to put in his next movie to make millions.
I:10;4633;Accompanying him is an aspiring actress named Ann, played brilliantly by Watts, his writer, played by Brody, and the rest of the movie and ship crew.
I:10;4634;cutting to the chase, King Kong, an enormous ape, is discovered on the Island occupied by grizzly natives who sacrifice Ann to him.
I:10;4635;What occurs between Ann and the ape is a heartwarming relationship.
I:10;4636;The scenes where Kong rescues Ann from the raging dinosaurs, including a few T. rexes, are reminiscent to Jurassic Park, but amazing action sequences that end with quite a laugh.
I:10;4637;the story evolves into a striking love story, not a romance, between the ape and Ann that end up in an incredibly rebuilt 1930's New York City, where Kong causes awe and havoc in the city, but all for the search of his lovely Ann where he sees a beauty that kills the beast within him.
I:10;4638;it's a lovely tale, and you will feel pleased to watch it despite many criticisms revolving around differences between the original and this new version.
I:10;4639;king Kong will make you laugh, cry, and sit at the edge of your seat.
I:10;4640;Definitely one of the best movie experiences of the year!RecommendedA.
I:10;4641;I am a big King Kong fan and I came into this movie very skeptical.
I:10;4642;I waited and bought the extended edition which makes the movie even longer.
I:10;4643;This version of Kong is the most believable and expressive creature you will ever see.
I:10;4644;Regardless of its length, King Kong is BIG screen entertainment.
I:10;4645;Highly recommended and worthy of 5 stars.
I:10;4646;I searched high and low for this version of King Kong and it was well worth the hunt.
I:10;4647;The director out did himself with this one, so amazing effects, kept me glued but was boring the first 49 minutes into it, after that the rest of the 3hrs was AWESOME
I:10;4648;King Kong is one the best blu.
I:10;4649;Beyond that, aside from some droning moments, this film is a gem.
I:10;4650;The very movements of her facial muscles are perfect in their pitch.
I:10;4651;She does well, I doubt that Jackson had to do much work within her scenes.
I:10;4652;the action in this film is beyond fun.
I:10;4653;It's entertaining and eye popping.
I:10;4654;Mix this much fun with Watts acting, and you've got a film that should be placed in it's proper place in the annals of the MPAA.
I:10;4655;One of the best films of this lifetime.
I:10;4656;The antique cars are painted bright colors, something that never happened in 1933.
I:10;4657;Enjoy it as an action packed adventure, but don't expect to see an improved King Kong.
I:10;4658;"The new ""King Kong"" is one of the most epic action/adventure movies ever, a mega."
I:10;4659;budget blockbusters oughtta be (but often aren't): that is, involving great characters (human or otherwise) in a great high.
I:10;4660;octane story that's fascinating, emotionally powerful, and completely engaging on many levels.
I:10;4661;set in the Great Depression, a number of struggling and/or out.
I:10;4662;luck actors, actresses, film crewmen and a playright, and an oceangoing ship's crew, all find themselves cajoled, persuaded, conned or otherwise weaseled by shifty but humorous filmmaker Carl Denham (Jack Black, who alternates masterfully between being the underdog.
I:10;4663;On this mysterious island whose location Denham has somehow become privy to, he plans to film his latest masterpiece, a work that he's certain will bring him worldwide fame, vast wealth and immortal respect, as certain as he was with each of his previous movies which went by with moderate (at most) success each time.
I:10;4664;a good portion of the film's early going is taken up with odd but effective humor, but things change when the ship comes upon Skull Island itself, where the characters .
I:10;4665;Just a few generalizations: there are epic confrontations, scenes of tremendous beauty and tenderness, mountain.
I:10;4666;sized thrills and scares, more strange humor that somehow manages to work with the huge nature of the film instead of throwing a monkeywrench into it, and a fair bit of insight into mankind's quest for wonder and awe, and the dichotomy between that quest and the way man often ends up corrupting or destroying the dreams it does attain.
I:10;4667;And mention must be made of the outstanding effects, particularly on the King himself.
I:10;4668;You can read Kong's emotions and state of mind brilliantly through facial expressions and body language, to an extent where it's hard to believe it's not all real.
I:10;4669;All this in one movie, one of the biggest and boldest and best ever.
I:10;4670;King Kong as delivered by Peter Jackson is a period film, a character piece, and a monster mash, with a smattering of operatic tragedy.
I:10;4671;he's the true bohemian, living for his cherished art of theater.
I:10;4672;The effects are astounding, although they are not always seemless.
I:10;4673;"Kong himself is beautifully realized
I:10;4674;In fact, the key to this movie is whether this synthetic creature wins you over.
I:10;4675;"The other creatures on the island are a treat as well
I:10;4676;in the end, Kong has a lot to offer.
I:10;4677;Aside from the action, there is some real heart in this picture.
I:10;4678;The plot is a little thin at times, but this is, after all, a remake of one of the most beloved B. movies of all time.
I:10;4679;Peter Jackson has developed a style of visualizing and telling a story that is his own, and for this reviewer, it's hard to beat.
I:10;4680;The bond between Kong and Ann is deeply touching, though most unusual.
I:10;4681;Action, drama, and even soem humorous touches make this a nice, broad piece of film entertainment.
I:10;4682;(James Newton Howard, replacing Howard Shore late in the process, delivers a nice score as well.)
I:10;4683;With his fabulous remake of KING KONG (2005), Peter Jackson tops his Oscar.
I:10;4684;winning LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and enters a movie lover's pantheon for me.
I:10;4685;This is my favorite film of last year and it could become one of my personal favorite movies of all time.
I:10;4686;The movie benefits enormously in being a full 90 minutes longer than the original film.
I:10;4687;we are on Skull Island, in Jackson's wondrous film, for maybe an hour, long enough to have enough creature battles to please any kid at heart.
I:10;4688;"But Jackson tops the original film in humanizing Kong
I:10;4689;I particularly enjoyed seeing Ann and Kong watching a sunset together from a jungle cliff plateau.
I:10;4690;This is an immensely likeable Kong, not someone who eats villagers and throws Manhattan socialite women to the street in the 1933 version.
I:10;4691;nominated production design and Oscar.
I:10;4692;winning visual effects of Depression era Manhattan are just stupendous here, amazingly re.
I:10;4693;created in New Zealand, Jackson's home turf.
I:10;4694;This is some of the most beautiful visual effects and production design I have ever seen.
I:10;4695;production Diaries, the history of Skull Island, and how Depression New York City was re.
I:10;4696;I want to be able to watch the film over and over again without constantly fast forwarding to the good parts.
I:10;4697;The sorry line is great.
I:10;4698;i watched the extended version which has many excellent scenes that were deleted.
I:10;4699;This extended version really improves things for me.
I:10;4700;The extra scenes of prehistoric encounters really were wonderful and the styragosaurs scene was actually an homage to the 33 original who also had a similar scene that was cut out and lost.
I:10;4701;The video is quite outstanding.
I:10;4702;beautiful color saturation and shading, wonderful depth throughout.
I:10;4703;Yes, Lord of the Rings fans, we do.
I:10;4704;This movie is really good!
I:10;4705;Even though it is 3 hours long it is still a great movie.
I:10;4706;Peter Jackson is a master of creating big, epic action/adventure films.
I:10;4707;film adaptation ofThe Lord of the Rings Trilogyis a masterpiece of modern film.
I:10;4708;But with this film, what could have been an intense, action.
I:10;4709;"And the presentation of a ""love story"" between Kong the Ape and a human woman is kind of handled weirdly."
I:10;4710;The cast does as good a job as it can with the extended script, and the visual effects and James Newton Howard's score are really good.
I:10;4711;But this film definitely should have been under two.
I:10;4712;This is only a film for those with a huge amount of patience.
I:10;4713;Of course, the effects are superior to the original and the acting is as well, but more importantly the story retains the charm, awe, and tragic vision of the original masterpiece and becomes a masterpiece all its own.
I:10;4714;Yes, there is some character development there and that allows us to care more for the characters, but it was over.
I:10;4715;He is a gifted director and shows his respect for the work he creates.
I:10;4716;The same love and attention given LOTR is given to KK as well by Jackson.
I:10;4717;I completely enjoyed this film, in spite of the painfully slow start and highly recommend this edition for the many extras.
I:10;4718;They should put out their best product first and be done with it.
I:10;4719;The extra footage really adds alot to the movie, and the special effects were great.
I:10;4720;thanks again for a great product, and I will definitely continue to shop with Amazon and iNetVideo.
I:10;4721;Just listen to the delivery of the last line of the movie.
I:10;4722;The 1933 version of King Kong, which is the original, is perhaps the first film to rightfully be labeled a 'classic.'
I:10;4723;It was unique in its day and age, and was during an era where the citizens of America wanted to really watch adventure movies that had them on the edge of their seat.
I:10;4724;But this version of King Kong, which does justice to the former, really does do just that: it entertains!Follow the characters on an epic (sometimes dull) adventure to Skull Island, where they meet savage natives who desire to sacrifice one of the main characters, Anne, to their god.
I:10;4725;This truly is a modern.
I:10;4726;day tale of Beauty and The Beast.
I:10;4727;The story is enriched in this new version, and we get to delve deeper into the characters and their psyche.
I:10;4728;think JURASSIC PARK with a big ape and a dash of ALIENS.
I:10;4729;and that is the heart of my disaffection: Jackson's evident belief that More Is Necessarily Better.
I:10;4730;the movie pays special attention to detail of the time period.
I:10;4731;the visual presntation is spectacular,with more kong than ever before.
I:10;4732;i love them both 5 star rated.
I:10;4733;He had a long and very successful period doing the LOTR Trilogies, and the extended versions.
I:10;4734;I enjoyed the special effects, but I didn't think the casting was appropriate.
I:10;4735;"house movies
I:10;4736;absorbed lead actor and the leading lady faired much better.
I:10;4737;Story sticks to the original from the 1930s, and that is probably a good thing.
I:10;4738;awareness and humor, like LOTR had.
I:10;4739;kong himself was brilliant .
I:10;4740;as an ape he was a wordless pantomime character who transmitted feeling and emotion perfectly and was a great tragic figure, and that alone will make this movie a milestone.
I:10;4741;still, 4 stars for the hypnotizing beauty of Naomi Watts.
I:10;4742;She can gaze longingly or knowingly or despairingly like a living, breathing Greek Goddess in the midst of High Drama, all day long.
I:10;4743;The best bets in real life which had large fauna and a unique ecosystems are Madagascar or Australia.
I:10;4744;One has to look closely to even notice the CGI.
I:10;4745;Kong makes its predecessors and hundreds of others look like well.
I:10;4746;oscar winning Titanic, Peter Jackson went straight to the sets to create his next epic after his 12.
I:10;4747;oscar winning The Lord of the Rings 3 .
I:10;4748;And what a creation King Kong has been.
I:10;4749;Scantily clad heroine in revealing shots, 2.
I:10;4750;King Kong indulging in shady acts with the heroine.
I:10;4751;the special effects are amazing.
I:10;4752;Kong's fight with the T. rexes is one thing worth watching countless times.
I:10;4753;check out the lovely piano of the beautiful scene of a tearful and angelic Naomi on the deck of the ship as she acts and emotes a scene for the film that she is cast(in the story of the movie).
I:10;4754;making and worth your while.
I:10;4755;The cast does a great job.
I:10;4756;The music is just amazing.
I:10;4757;The story is a classic.
I:10;4758;This movie has a beautiful look.
I:10;4759;It's one of my favorites and if you haven't seen then you need to.
I:10;4760;I enjoyed Peter Jackson's version of this classic.
I:10;4761;Kong's animation and emotions were very clever and well done.
I:10;4762;I really liked the new take on the relationship between Kong and Naomi Watts character.
I:10;4763;This was one of the better movies that I have seen.
I:10;4764;I'm sure you will think this movies is as good as the original!
I:10;4765;Although the special features are a little small on this, you get a high def version of the film with the extended version included.
I:10;4766;It was a pleasure watching the detail that has gone into the making of this film.
I:10;4767;New York comes to its full glory in this film.
I:10;4768;It remains a wonderful classic that should be seen by all generations present and future.
I:10;4769;Naomi Watts does a marvelous job as the lead actress, and Andy Sirkis as Kong breaks my heart.
I:10;4770;All in all the movie is well acted, well paced and incredibly beautiful.
I:10;4771;the cinematography is wonderful it looks like the early '30s and its just a brilliantly directed movie that came out amazing.
I:10;4772;If you havent seen it I would definitely recommend you do so it is a delight.
I:10;4773;This IS the best movie of 2005.
I:10;4774;The special effect were fantastic.
I:10;4775;The popcorn movie of the millennium, setting a new standard for special effects wizardry.
I:10;4776;The story is the best!
I:10;4777;like so many other New Yorkers during the Great Depression.
I:10;4778;With that, the showman is certain he will finally achieve the personal greatness he knows awaits him around the corner.
I:10;4779;and although the crew believe that corner to be Singapore, Denham actually hopes to find and capture on film the mysterious place of legend: Skull Island.
I:10;4780;coming, socially relevant playwright Jack Driscoll (Oscar winner for The Pianist, ADRIEN BRODY) is penning the screenplay.
I:10;4781;Joining Watts, Black and Brody is an accomplished ensemble cast from around the globe.
I:10;4782;EVAN PARKE lends his talents to the role of first mate Hayes, keeping a watchful eye on young Jimmy and serving as Englehorn's conscience.
I:10;4783;ANDY SERKIS (who performed the role of the CGI character Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy) provides both on.
I:10;4784;"capture performance for the ""Eighth Wonder of the World""."
I:10;4785;i myself have seen this movie twice and hope to go see it again!
I:10;4786;First off Peter Jackson's version of Kong is the greatest portrayed on film, he changes a monster special ef.
I:10;4787;film into a tragic love story.
I:10;4788;He created something very incredible and unique.
I:10;4789;:Post Production Diaries, these are great, although they left off Week 13 the Howard Shore score diary :(I just love these PDs they are truly one of the greatest things Peter Jackson has done in the making of KK05: he lets us know practically everything that went into this film.
I:10;4790;This is a true gem, you learn the history of skull island from beginning to end, don't want to ruin any of the details of the history, but all I can say is watch it it is a real treat and it lets you know some of those mysteries behind skull island.
I:10;4791;nY Feature: A very good feature that goes into 1933 NY and details some aspects that you might not of picked up on when watching Kong.
I:10;4792;oVERALLThis is one of the truly great works of film in the 21st Century by the greatest director, everyone should truly enjoy this mans profilling of a dream in directing king kong.
I:10;4793;with the PJ's 2 Disc Special Edition of King Kong and the Production Diaries creates one amazing 4 disc set that is virtually complete, this is one of the great works of our time.
I:10;4794;Personally I've never found the Kong movies appealing in the past but gave this one a shot due to the compelling trailers and to the fact that after LotR Jackson has earned the benefit of the doubt.
I:10;4795;King Kong is without a doubt the finest film I've seen this year big budget extravaganza or not.
I:10;4796;it comes as no surprise that the film looks amazing as Jackson seems to have perfected the perfect balance of CGI and set design, no the surprise comes in the casting and the marvelously written script.
I:10;4797;I've heard other reviewers question the casting of Adrian Brody, Jack Black and even Naomi Watts, but I'm not one of them, these fine actors really bring their characters to life in a thoroughly believable way.
I:10;4798;One could also call the 1930's New York a character as it provides the perfect backdrop for our intrepid heroes.
I:10;4799;The film is so wonderfully paced that you hardly notice that it takes a full hour before Kong actually appears.
I:10;4800;When we finally reach Skull Island, where most of the action takes place, we're thoroughly briefed and ready for a rousing adventure which somehow combines the best elements of the Indiana Jones movies, and Jurassic Park.
I:10;4801;"when it comes down to it, however, it's not the effects that make this a great movie
I:10;4802;For the first time in any Kong movie I actually felt empathy for the great ape mostly from gazing into the beautiful eyes of Naomi Watts.
I:10;4803;Watt's performance really does make this movie along with the performance of Kong himself brought to life through CGI wizardry and from the performance of the excellent Andy Sirkus (who did the same for the equally wonderful Gollum in LotR).
I:10;4804;The sunset scene with these two characters on the island, and the sunrise scene in New York actually brought tears to my eyes.
I:10;4805;You see that's the difference between Jackson and other big.
I:10;4806;budget directors, he envisions films that can wow you and tug at your heartstrings at the same time.
I:10;4807;Not only does he envision them but he brings them to life in magical ways for our viewing pleasure.
I:10;4808;Thanks for the Christmas present Peter Jackson.
I:10;4809;The first 'King Kong' is a classic.
I:10;4810;See this new version as.
I:10;4811;the reviewer Paully said this film is 'technically well done .
I:10;4812;as for the movie I think is really amazing.
I:10;4813;realistic unrealistic inhabitants and fabulous jungles .
I:10;4814;the special effects are the MOST incredible that I've seen so far.
I:10;4815;I really was amazed and touched by the beauty and by the beast.
I:10;4816;This movie was a pleasure to watch, from the cast to Kong himself.
I:10;4817;Jack Blacks role is off his usual comic self but still delivers a serious non.
I:10;4818;i recommend this movie especially in the Blu.
I:10;4819;The cinematography is simply awesome !
I:10;4820;Its well worth having in your library.
I:10;4821;A great price an brand new.
I:10;4822;Recommend it to any movie lover !
I:10;4823;some of the CGI is great .
I:10;4824;This movie had incredible special effects.
I:10;4825;The movie was an action packed film, and there were barely any slow parts in it.
I:10;4826;The crew manages to make it to an island that contains a huge monkey(King Kong).
I:10;4827;Everyone is scared but excited at the same time.
I:10;4828;The ending is incredibly sad but the journey through the movie is worth it.
I:10;4829;Jack Black brings humor into the film.
I:10;4830;this new version soars from the breathtaking imagination of director Peter Jackson.
I:10;4831;The same strengths Jackson showed in LORD OF THE RINGS are in dazzling display here.
I:10;4832;Although there are enough amazing CGI special effects to satisfy even the most jaded STAR WARS/STAR TREK geek (including me), he's never willing to sacrifice heart and intimacy for spectacle.
I:10;4833;While KONG is a sprawling rollercoaster thrill ride of a movie.
I:10;4834;it's Naomi Watts luminous portrayal of Ann Darrow that steals our hearts (and Kong's).
I:10;4835;"An incurable romantic at heart, I actually turned to my husband after the movie and said, ""I wish they'd have shown more scenes developing their relationship"" before remembering that I was talking about a woman and a giant gorilla."
I:10;4836;Great special effects but most big movies do these days.
I:10;4837;Nothing special about the story and there's really nothing to recommend it over the original but it is a good evening's entertainment.
I:10;4838;It was a technical marvel that thrilled and chilled audiences across the nation.
I:10;4839;Now, in 2005, Peter Jackson has once again shown why he is the king of the epic film by recreating pretty damn faithfully the original experience but doing something even more wonderful: adding heart and humanity.
I:10;4840;But definitely needed) scene in the park, Kong is shown as a creature that can love, can feel and can be more human than monster.
I:10;4841;And that makes what happens next all the more tragic and heart.
I:10;4842;andy Serkis who did terrific work as Gollum once again goes above and beyond in his duty as Kong.
I:10;4843;Between him and the best CG I've seen, King Kong is a beast with sadness.
I:10;4844;You can see it in his eyes and his movements.
I:10;4845;At 3 hours it is about double the original film.
I:10;4846;It also expresses the possible love that could blossom between Ann and Jack before Kong steps into the picture.
I:10;4847;It was important to the film, but it got the point where I wanted something exciting to happen.
I:10;4848;once that exciting moment happens, though, the thrill ride begins.
I:10;4849;What follows once they reach the island is thrilling sequence after sequence.
I:10;4850;But unlike other movies involving dinosaurs (Jurassic Park 3), this film has emotion, characters worth caring about and heart.
I:10;4851;It is faithful to the original but builds upon it both creatively and technically.
I:10;4852;You will laugh, you will jump and you will possibly cry at this story of beauty and the beast.
I:10;4853;I agree with others that this is one amazing movie.
I:10;4854;It is magnificent to watch in a theater, especially King Kong.
I:10;4855;The rest of the actors do their bit extremely well.
I:10;4856;this movie is a great example of a movie being perfect because of it's imperfections.
I:10;4857;But the effect is real enough that it triggered my fear of heights.
I:10;4858;we brought our kids, 7 and 10.
I:10;4859;They spent a good deal of the middle third of the movie in the theater hallway.
I:10;4860;that said, this is a highly unusual movie, not something you will see so well done every day.
I:10;4861;The film is extremely beautiful and moving (as in tender, scary, freaked out, funny).
I:10;4862;"I despise ""reviews"" by people that enjoy their own writing, and go out of their way to write SPOILERS and High School Book Reports about movies, so I won't be doing that."
I:10;4863;I'll just describe to you what I felt without giving too much away.
I:10;4864;i loved most of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and this made me a Peter Jackson fan, though I'd seen some of his previous work and didn't know it at the time.
I:10;4865;It was nice however, to see a big Gorilla portrayed as an actual GORILLA, which was very refreshing and fun to watch for the most part.
I:10;4866;Those guys should stick with fantasy and monsters and talking trees.)
I:10;4867;See the film anyway, just to say you did.
I:10;4868;The ending was actually worth the wait though, to watch Jack Black ruin the famous tag.
I:10;4869;"Despite all it's criticism over the years, I've always been fond of the 1976 remake of ""King Kong"" and Peter Jackson's version doesn't better it, in my opinion."
I:10;4870;"You can actually feel Jackson pulling at your heart strings with his ""Kong,"" and it is is over."
I:10;4871;The characterisation of Kong though, is a marvel.
I:10;4872;My biding image of this movie is that of one grey, rubbery lump collapsing on top of another.
I:10;4873;but it's a fair bit of a journey getting there and beyond.
I:10;4874;There is the occasional echo of things done before .
I:10;4875;but that's more than made up for with imaginative, original sequences that genuinely keep surprising you and keep you on the edge.
I:10;4876;but the success achieved in fully forming the characters of the leading man and lady is as far as the characterisation goes in this movie.
I:10;4877;pounding bragging rights, but audiences will be more than happy to hear it proclaim its return to the big screen.
I:10;4878;"first century remake of the 1933 ""King Kong"" sets this movie apart from the rest of its peers."
I:10;4879;Kong himself, generated from computer graphics and modeled after actor Andy Serkis, looks amazingly real, quite unlike the cardboard image of the 1933 original.
I:10;4880;"Other than that, this ""Kong"" is very much worth your time."
I:10;4881;It packs a wild punch and it deserved its three technical Oscars.
I:10;4882;I'm giving Peter Jackson, Naomi Watts and the incredible special effects four stars.
I:10;4883;They've really done something special here.
I:10;4884;naomi Watts was great, hands.
I:10;4885;(Now if today's Hollywood can give a brand new story the kind of innovation and energy that Jackson gives to KONG, maybe we'll have something new to cheer about.
I:10;4886;But enough is enough, people.
I:10;4887;They can swim, jump, wrestle and rock climb with the best of them.
I:10;4888;And good thing that Watts is made of plado or puddy or some other indestructable material .
I:10;4889;Yes, they express good emotion.
I:10;4890;Give meaningful stares that mean nothing.
I:10;4891;I'm a fan of anything he does and he really did well for what he was given.
I:10;4892;Colin Hanks was great to watch .
I:10;4893;Again, unlike the other negative reviewers, I thought he did a very good job switching to a slightly more serious role.
I:10;4894;disapointing as this hyped up movie was, we must remember that Jackson really is pretty new on the scene.
I:10;4895;And perhaps Jackson got that out of his system and will go back to making movies that stand above the rest.
I:10;4896;Quiet the opposite he was amazing and Peter Jackson step up to the plate with bases loaded with his lord of the rings saga and hit a grand slam.
I:10;4897;His eyes had life and he successfully captured the lead role in this film.
I:10;4898;i would recommend this movie a million time over to anyone.
I:10;4899;peter Jackson undid all the goodwill he earned from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
I:10;4900;Movie: After a somewhat awkward first act, the movie comes alive with excellent action, emotional and heartfelt, if ever.
I:10;4901;enhancement, this is one of the most lifelike transfers I've yet seen, with colors that are wonderfully saturated without being overdone, and perfect contrast.
I:10;4902;lifelike, making excellent use of the surrounds, be it for subtle ambience or loud action.
I:10;4903;Music and dialogue are perfectly prioritized, never lost in the frenzy of wild action sequences.
I:10;4904;Some of view points are really cool and some are nauseating (fear of heights).
I:10;4905;I love Peter Jackson's movies, but this one is largely an over.
I:10;4906;It's more about his ego than good film making.
I:10;4907;many of the details added to the backstory are interesting, but the Skull Island (Mordor,anyone?)
I:10;4908;Not often enough, a film overflows with the director's enthusiasm and glee, jam.
I:10;4909;packed with action sequences, outstanding special effects, good and bad dialogue and acting, everything, good and bad, is just completely over the top.
I:10;4910;When I see a film like this, I can tell the filmmaker is really in love with his job, because they have crafted a film with such loving detail that everything they have is on the screen.
I:10;4911;"Then ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy became an international hit and his fortunes changed."
I:10;4912;what he has created is an eye.
I:10;4913;popping, excessive, overly long, thoroughly entertaining adventure film with some believable romance.
I:10;4914;as this is his lifelong dream project, Jackson has put everything into the film.
I:10;4915;story of the characters, giving us details of their life before they reach Skull Island, making them interesting, human and believable.
I:10;4916;carl Denham (Jack Black) is a filmmaker with ideas and aspirations larger than his budget.
I:10;4917;The studio wants a B. picture about the jungle and Denham wants to film an epic masterpiece on an uncharted island located on a recently discovered map.
I:10;4918;Denham needs a lead actress, spots Ann, takes her to dinner, and convinces her to star in his movie.
I:10;4919;Ann greatly admires Driscoll's plays and would love to star in his newest production.
I:10;4920;"at 187 minutes, ""Kong"" is a massive undertaking, both for filmmaker and audience."
I:10;4921;The extended length of time allows Jackson and his team to really explore the characters, helping the viewer get to know them before they arrive at the Island and all hell breaks loose.
I:10;4922;All of this fleshes out the characters and helps them become more life like.
I:10;4923;When they are in danger, we care about their safety and the film becomes more memorable as a result.
I:10;4924;"after ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, we expect the special effects work on ""Kong"" to be phenomenal."
I:10;4925;Later in the film, when we first see Kong, he takes our breath away.
I:10;4926;Clearly, these special effects were advanced for the time, and the fact that they could create Kong at all is a miracle.
I:10;4927;"Thankfully, with the advancement of special effects, ""Kong"" always looks the same size."
I:10;4928;just as the filmmakers have spent a lot of time fleshing out the humans, they also devote considerable screen time making Kong a real character.
I:10;4929;In this film, we believe this change.
I:10;4930;"Andy Serkis, so memorable as Gollum in the ""LOTR"" trilogy, is largely responsible for making Kong a believable creature, giving the huge ape largely human characteristics."
I:10;4931;from the moment we first see 1933 New York, you realize you are in the hands of a master who loves to play with his toys.
I:10;4932;The city has a slightly romantic look, lights appear soft and glowing, snow rounds the hard edges, yet Jackson reminds us this is a city in the grips of the Depression.
I:10;4933;I am sure Jackson did this as a homage to the films of this period.
I:10;4934;"the entire sequence on Skull Island is filled with more special effects than any one of the ""Jurassic Park"" films."
I:10;4935;Suprising, believable, exciting and wonderful.
I:10;4936;The brontosaurus stampede is equally eye popping and an equally diverting theme park attraction.
I:10;4937;throughout, Jackson and his team have gone to great lengths to make every frame of celluloid believable, heightening the power of the film.
I:10;4938;all of the special effects work in the world will not solely create a great film.
I:10;4939;Jackson devotes a lot of time, as previously mentioned, building the back story of the human characters, making them believable, and he and partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, have crafted some great dialogue throughout adding yet another dimension to what easily could be just another briefly entertaining exercise in CGI.
I:10;4940;"All of this work with characters, dialogue and back story has helped to ensure his ""Kong"" will be king."
I:10;4941;And she does a good job with King Kong as well.
I:10;4942;Ann Darrow is a more fully realized heroine allowing Watts more to work with.
I:10;4943;Watts gives us a first hand look as we witness Ann's struggles as an actress, to live, and to eat.
I:10;4944;There are also subtle hints at her character throughout, making her more complex and interesting than we could expect.
I:10;4945;adrian Brody is also very good as Jack Driscoll, a rising playwright.
I:10;4946;Resigned, with nowhere else to go, he sets out to write the best screenplay possible.
I:10;4947;She is equally smitten, but unwilling to make the first move.
I:10;4948;Black's previous film work is filled with over the top starring roles in broad comedies.
I:10;4949;Nothing he has ever done would indicate he is capable of such a role in a film like this.
I:10;4950;Black's portrayal of Denham is interesting, over the top and inconsistent.
I:10;4951;This could be a result of Jackson's editing and direction, but Watts conveys a lot about her character whenever she is on screen, including having a relationship with a big ape.
I:10;4952;"at 187 minutes, ""Kong"" is a massive undertaking for the audience as well."
I:10;4953;The first hour, as we learn about the humans, is fun and amusing.
I:10;4954;The second hour is action packed and builds a believable relationship between Ann and Kong.
I:10;4955;But this hour is so filled with amazing action that we are exhausted by the time it comes to a close.
I:10;4956;As the climax begins to build, things begin to move a bit, as Kong makes his way to the Empire State Building.
I:10;4957;"Don't get me wrong: ""Kong"" deserves each and every one of its 187 minutes, but it could also deserve each and every one of its 165 minutes and still be a truly exceptional film."
I:10;4958;jackson's films just keep getting better and better.
I:10;4959;"There are few filmmakers who could've handled the ""LOTR"" trilogy as well."
I:10;4960;"With ""King Kong"", Jackson uses each and every skill, tool and artistic ability he has ever learned to create an eye."
I:10;4961;popping, excessive, overly long, thoroughly entertaining adventure film which will surely inspire a new crop of young men and women to become filmmakers.
I:10;4962;Although a terribly long but excellent movie, the extended edition feel much more personal than the theatrical.
I:10;4963;"Summed up, ""it was beauty killed the beast."""
I:10;4964;First let me say that I have always been a huge fan of the original King Kong.
I:10;4965;Computer animation aside, what Willis O'Brien did with stop motion animation was one of the great technical achievements in movie history.
I:10;4966;But knowing Peter Jackson was at the helm eased my mind.
I:10;4967;First and foremost Jackson is also a huge fan of the original and wasn't going to try and do anything that would disparage the film.
I:10;4968;The first thing that Jackson does right is that he sets his film in the early 1930's, just like the original.
I:10;4969;While he doesn't play it with the bravado of Robert Armstrong in the original, Black's slick, smarmy, do anything for a shot, works well for the most part.
I:10;4970;While she doesn't have that famous Fay Wray scream, she handles the role as beauty to the beast with a beautiful romantic sensitivity.
I:10;4971;Meanwhile Ann is winning over the beast by dancing and juggling and you will believe a giant gorilla can laugh.
I:10;4972;I suspect, just like Lord of the Rings, that in a couple of months we will get an extended cut of the film with even more special features than what comes on the two disc set.
I:10;4973;While this remake is not without a few weaknesses, it's still one of the best remakes of a classic film ever.
I:10;4974;Peter Jackson could have told this story in less than 3 hours and there are certainly scenes that go too long, but some scenes are so heartbreaking and so beautiful that you are happy that he let you in for the whole thing.
I:10;4975;Sure Adrian Brody and Jack Black are great (especially towards the end when Jack Black is in full Orson Welles mode) but this is Naomi Watts' movie.
I:10;4976;When I saw the first King Kong movie I felt like I wanted to throw it away.
I:10;4977;I truly appreciate the cinematography with the version made in 1976 but with the use of today's technology they were able to recreate this masterpiece.
I:10;4978;Kong himself was completely believable.
I:10;4979;"This movie wraps itself around you
I:10;4980;Because this movie is all about that elusive story.
I:10;4981;KK is a masterpiece, not only of re.
I:10;4982;telling a classic and archetypal tale of Beauty and Beast, but also of almost perfect closure of every foreshadowing.
I:10;4983;it starts with the music.
I:10;4984;"jackson of course delights in overdoing his creatures
I:10;4985;Jackson just took the name and ran with it.
I:10;4986;"That's how it was sold to us, and everybody bought it
I:10;4987;the real 'love' story actually _is_ between Ann and Jack.
I:10;4988;He's the human analogue to the ape, the one who can be what the ape cannot.
I:10;4989;The 'love' story between KK and Ann is more subtle.
I:10;4990;That, of course, is the essence of beauty: that it is indeed in the eye of the beholder, for 'beauty' is always 'beauty.
I:10;4991;The ape is savage, because he has to be in order to survive.
I:10;4992;"enclosure, namely those gargoylish bats

I:10;4997;especially those who have lost sight of the things that matter, and who become immersed in trivial self.
I:10;4998;scenes), and other things that most people have come to expect.
I:10;4999;Peter Jackson is a talented filmmaker and I was excited to delve into this extended edition of King Kong.
I:10;5000;There is no doubt that some of the action scenes are outstanding and the cinematography is nice.
I:10;5001;Naomi Watts does a superb job as Ann, and her compassion for Kong is heartfelt and real.
I:10;5002;Certain sequences are wonderful, such as the T Rex fight, and Kong's rampage through the city streets.
I:10;5003;All in all, this film is still good, and kept my attention throughout.
I:10;5004;but it certainly isn't great.
I:10;5005;part of the problem is the original.
I:10;5006;The 1976 version did a great job with this, and I guess I expected at least as good a moment from Peter Jackson.
I:10;5007;well, that's enough complaining, here are some good things about the movie!
I:10;5008;Kong looks great in the film, although it does take some getting used to.
I:10;5009;the acting is generally very good, and the sets look fantastic (the minimalist Skull Island looks exactly like you can imagine it would if it existed in the real world).
I:10;5010;There are some truly touching moments in this film between Naomi Watts and Kong.
I:10;5011;Finally, the story stays quite true to the classic original, which is a good thing.
I:10;5012;all in all, Peter Jackson's remake is a good film, but I really expected more.
I:10;5013;While I recommend everyone see Jackson's film just because of the enormity of the project, don't view it with expectations of exceeding the original.
I:10;5014;"It's just a ""small"" detail, right?"
I:10;5015;I loved the effects, Naomi Watts was amazing in her scenes with Kong and the last hour was spectacular.
I:10;5016;Twas beauty killed the beast ?
I:10;5017;The best thing going for this film , is the special effects.
I:10;5018;King Kong in his natural habitat is a scene to behold.
I:10;5019;JAckson makes good use of the 8th wonder , by maximizing the time we spend with the monkey.
I:10;5020;I truly began to feel a strange sense of compassion for King Kong.
I:10;5021;I think King Kong will be great for kids between the ages of 3 and 15.
I:10;5022;But if you're looking for an action packed blockbuster film.
I:10;5023;Twas beauty killed the beast ?
I:10;5024;and a great respect for the amazing amount of work produced at all levels with blowing cgi.
I:10;5025;I thought this was the best of the three versions.
I:10;5026;Peter Jackson's King Kong is an marvelous achievement that carries astonishing clarity and vision within every frame.
I:10;5027;2005 was a year that saw cinematic masterpieces such as Capote and Munich, but King Kong successfully embodies and often elevates to a new level the elements of storytelling, action, and visual effects that made cinema emerge as the 20th century's premier art form.
I:10;5028;king Kong seizes on the story provided by the 1933 original and expands upon it in the way some great films bring novels to a vibrant life no one could have imagined the material was capable of.
I:10;5029;She has a good heart, but her life has been little more than a series of crippling disappointments.
I:10;5030;In a seemingly divine stroke of luck, movie producer Carl Denham (Jack Black) approaches Ann on the street, offering her the chance to star in one of his films.
I:10;5031;Jackson's characters are likeable and clear, the dialogue never attempting to be clever or flashy, but a perfect component to lay out the action ahead.
I:10;5032;Already a good film, the film rushes forward at breakneck pace upon reaching Skull Island, never missing a step or skipping a beat.
I:10;5033;when King Kong (Andy Sekris) finally arrives, he occupies the screen with a dazzling sense of power and flawless movement.
I:10;5034;Sekris, who did the fabulous movements of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, works with special effects to bring the giant ape to life in way that outshines that of most human actors.
I:10;5035;She performs her vaudeville act for Kong, an enthusiastic audience who may not have ever received kind attention from another being.
I:10;5036;We slowly realize the two share a sort of connection that goes deeper than words.
I:10;5037;the knockout action sequences come furiously during the film's latter 2/3's, utilizing state of the art f/x and imagination for all they are worth.
I:10;5038;Originally known as the director of cult horror schlock such as Dead Alive, he shot to worldwide fame as the driving force behind the superb Lord of the Rings films.
I:10;5039;With King Kong, he proves himself to be an artist with phenomenal potential to add his name to the lexicon of great filmmakers.
I:10;5040;These words rang true throughout my psyche as this exciting, wonderful, deeply sad, and beautiful film came to a close.
I:10;5041;the GOODThe CG King Kong and various creatures.
I:10;5042;most were very realistic, but not all of them but not all the time.
I:10;5043;When the best performance in a film is by a special effect (Kong) you have serious problems.
I:10;5044;the effects may be primative, but they served a real purpose.
I:10;5045;it is a sad day when the the best actor in the movie was the animation of Kong.
I:10;5046;i liked the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
I:10;5047;No doubt this King Kong is more realistic than any of the preceding ones.
I:10;5048;tingling, and the acting is superb.
I:10;5049;I dropped one star for the aspect ratio.
I:10;5050;screen version take something away from the movie.
I:10;5051;a great film, but I still prefer the 1976 version with Jeff Bridges for the widescreen format and score in that one.
I:10;5052;I have to admit though the scenery was great, and I did like it when they fought the big bugs.
I:10;5053;i was mostly desappointed because I figured Peter Jackson would do a great job with this movie, but maybe he should stick with directing fantasy.
I:10;5054;Oh, yeah the movie is great if you would like a CGI headache.
I:10;5055;Peter Jackson has shown off his good directing in brilliant films such as LOTR trilogy.
I:10;5056;But then Kong realizes how much she loves him.
I:10;5057;It's basically just like the original, with some new twists and new added material you won't be expecting.
I:10;5058;The film overall was one of the best films I have ever seen.
I:10;5059;Flamboyant, foolhardy documentary filmmaker, Carl Denham, sails off to remote Skull Island to film his latest epic with leading lady, Ann Darrow.
I:10;5060;This movie is magnificent and very entertaining for a remake.
I:10;5061;Peter Jackson's visual effects team really did a phenomenal job with that and there aren't many moments where you really don't believe a 30 foot ape is actually on set or on stage.
I:10;5062;"this movie reminds me a lot of the Star Wars prequels in that, it seems, many of the effects (which is essentially the last 2 hours of the movie) are on screen to show the world, ""hey, look what we can do!"""
I:10;5063;a rogue film producer takes a rather beat.
I:10;5064;star action/adventure/classic in the making.
I:10;5065;His love of and sheer joy in film.
I:10;5066;handled and the pace relentless.
I:10;5067;Jackson even manages to top several sequences from the original .
I:10;5068;the Bride of Kong sacrifice, Kong escaping from the Broadway theatre, the Empire State Building finale, here a breathtakingly dizzying piece of filmmaking .
I:10;5069;as well as throwing in some good additions of his own, such as a truly charming scene on the ice in Central Park or a couple of convincing storm sequences on the perilous shores of Skull Island.
I:10;5070;There are plenty of fun injokes that don't seem awkwardly forced on the picture either .
I:10;5071;time classic in its own rightThere's some striking miscasting.
I:10;5072;but the acting honors easily belong to Andy Serkis' Kong, a triumph not just of CGI (and far more convincing than he appeared in the trailers) but also performance.
I:10;5073;he's caught the body language perfectly, convincing us that it's a great ape rather than a human being dictating the moves.
I:10;5074;the fact his devotion was unrequited was one of the things that made his last stand so much more touching and pitiful.
I:10;5075;Yet compared to the two previous remakes, Jackson's genuine love of the material still carries the day and certainly delivers the best of 2005's blockbusters.
I:10;5076;This was the best film ever!
I:10;5077;I think Jack Black has done a wonderful job playing seriously.
I:10;5078;THIS is a good movie.
I:10;5079;The movie should be 90 mins long and could be way more entertaining, physically possible, and believable.
I:10;5080;My vote for the best actor/actress in this movie goes to King Kong.
I:10;5081;I know, he's made up, not real and such, but believe me, I enjoyed his presence on the big screen more than any other actor/actress.
I:10;5082;all in all, go and see it if you want to see Naomi Watts' big blue eyes swimming in tears, the rugged and handsome captain of the Venture or the cute cabin boy, Jimmy.
I:10;5083;The basic story about the doomed beast and the beauty remains intact.
I:10;5084;Jackson infused more actions into the familiar story, but most impressive thing about this 3 hour 8 minute film is the tender and quite moments, in which King Kong and Ann Darrow are sitting side by side as if a scene from `The Beauty and the Beast.'
I:10;5085;Jackson wisely set the story in 1933, the same year when the original was released, and in the opening section Jackson sets up the film's period tone brilliantly with the scenes from New York City re.
I:10;5086;The first chapter is perhaps better than the rest of the film as far as its dramatic power goes.
I:10;5087;ignore these flaws, and enjoy `King Kong' as a grand.
I:10;5088;The original KING KONG is the movie that made Peter Jackson want to become a filmmaker.
I:10;5089;In fact, Darrow's beauty enchants the great ape.
I:10;5090;He escapes his chained existence and finds the girl of his dreams.
I:10;5091;on top of the city's highest building.
I:10;5092;There he enjoys a few moments of peace with Darrow, before he faces off with a squadron of airplanes.
I:10;5093;kING KONG is a very impressive movie.
I:10;5094;Jackson does an extraordinary job of re.
I:10;5095;creating 1930s New York and to remaining faithful to the original spirit of the first KING KONG.
I:10;5096;establish the classic everyman (Jack Driscoll as played by Adrian Brody) as a potential hero.
I:10;5097;The movie works on so many levels and has so much to say.
I:10;5098;At the same time, it is just a great movie.
I:10;5099;Wow the reviews so far doesnt seem to do this movie justice, it was a box office hit.
I:10;5100;The images are brilliant and jump off the screen at you.
I:10;5101;But what made LOTR the best movie of all time was the source material.
I:10;5102;Let me begin by telling you my dislike for Peter Jackson coming into Kong.
I:10;5103;After LOTR (a better book, excellent films though as well) the fans and media turned me off on the series to a large degree.
I:10;5104;The movie which has been re created more times than I care to think about brings life to this old story.
I:10;5105;"I remember seeing the previews and thinking ""how stupid"" another King Kong, bravo Mr. Jackson very original."
I:10;5106;"Peter Jackson beautifully and triumphfantly delivers ""the Eighth Wonder of the World"" in a visually stunning and more heart breakingly 3 hour epic."
I:10;5107;I new all along like this being the film, Jackson had been wanting to remake, I believe this is the film I was born to see.
I:10;5108;"I got to see a version of Merian C. Cooper's beast from the man who directed ""the Lord of the Rings"" The visual effects, are amazing, the emotion is more tender than the original."
I:10;5109;It pays homage to the original and it outdoes it no doubt.
I:10;5110;Jack Black came through in a serious role, Naomi Watts and Adrien Brody were marvelous.
I:10;5111;"This masterpiece most definitley should have been Best Picture, but the Academy usually doesn't go for fantasy epics except ""the Lord of the Rings"" but at least it won three oscars including best visual effects."
I:10;5112;Thats the best movie I've ever seen, but truly I think it is.
I:10;5113;This a masterpiece of something of beautiful in 1933, that could be again today.
I:10;5114;Everybody get out to see the latest and greatest edition to the ape's movie changing legacy and the greatest edition to the movies itself.
I:10;5115;So hold your breath for most thrilling and most romantic fantasy Hollywood has ever known.
I:10;5116;"Why the World will pay to see this ""Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you KONG, the Eighth Wonder of the World"" ""Beautiful"" ""I wrote it for you"""
I:10;5117;King Kong is Peter Jackson's first movie since completing The Lord of the rings trilogy.
I:10;5118;Once again Jackson proves himself as a master of filmmaking.
I:10;5119;While not as epic, or as good, as the Lord of the Rings, King Kong certainly is a masterpiece.
I:10;5120;The special effects are astounding, and plentiful, but there's no question that this is a character.
I:10;5121;my favorite things about the movie: Naomi Watts, James Newton Howard's score, and the action hero Bruce Baxter (played by the guy from the TV show Early Edition).
I:10;5122;King Kong and the dinosaurs look so cool!!
I:10;5123;Jack Black (Carl Denham) is hillarios in this film.
I:10;5124;This is a lot better than a Godzilla fan.
I:10;5125;Even though I love Godzilla, King Kong is a lot cooler, and a lot better.
I:10;5126;And Jack Black's Denham: was he the comic relief?
I:10;5127;this system is so great and it save me on just about everything: time, money, storage of all those dam movies my kids like but we just dont have room for.
I:10;5128;The original movie had a great musical score.
I:10;5129;Let's keep it that way in the remake.
I:10;5130;He should of married her and had Kong steal her against her will.
I:10;5131;denham should of been more likeable.
I:10;5132;The original had you on the edge of your seat.
I:10;5133;At least Peter Jackson did a much better job than the remake of 30 years ago.
I:10;5134;Great movie, lots of excitement, and they loved the dragon encounter!
I:10;5135;I have seen the original and thought it was good but to me it seemed ancient and not 'classic'.
I:10;5136;Anyway, I love Peter Jackson and I loved this film.
I:10;5137;The effects and acting were wonderful and amazing.
I:10;5138;Peter Jackson and his Weta team are genuises in that department.
I:10;5139;She can truly do anything.
I:10;5140;That is probably the best way to see this, on a very big screen.
I:10;5141;winning director Peter Jackson could be relied upon to produce a superior remake of the legendary, 101.
I:10;5142;"minute classic adventure movie ""King Kong"" (1933) than director John Guillerman's 135 minute, modern."
I:10;5143;"day ""King Kong,"" the oil company locked the giant ape up inside a supertanker and shipped him back to New York."
I:10;5144;"While Guillerman's ""King Kong"" (that starred Jeff Bridges and launched Jessica Lange to stardom) took a critical drubbing, it stands head and shoulders above Jackson's ape."
I:10;5145;"Even the campy Japanese movies: ""King Kong Vs. Godzilla"" (1963) and ""King Kong Escapes"" (1967) are more entertaining."
I:10;5146;Mind you, adolescent boys have always loved dinosaurs duking it out.
I:10;5147;roll brown mutants sprout large bubble.
I:10;5148;First, they convert action hero Jack Driscoll (Oscar.
I:10;5149;"winner Adrien Brody of ""The Pianist"") into a Federal Theater playwright."
I:10;5150;Jackson shoots all this in a semi.
I:10;5151;documentary style to sicken us.
I:10;5152;In two scenes, she performs vaudeville routines, juggling rocks and turning cartwheels, to amuse the big ape.
I:10;5153;"making effects, the original ""King Kong"" proved a magical experience for bewitched Depression."
I:10;5154;The original King Kong, released in 1933, is one of the greatest motion pictures of all.
I:10;5155;motion camera work, the original shocked movie.
I:10;5156;goers during the Great Depression and is part of cinematic history.
I:10;5157;It is definitely worth seeing .
I:10;5158;This is one movie that definitely deserves to be viewed with audio and visual enhanching technology.
I:10;5159;The movie's action scenes make your adrenaline pump, and some scenes even make you feel as if you are in the middle of Skull Island's thick vegetation and rain forests.
I:10;5160;By the time Kong makes his impressive appearance on screen, consider yourself fortunate if you are still fully awake and feel like continuing with the movie.
I:10;5161;the film's climax in New York City is spectacular.
I:10;5162;This is hands down the best part of the film.
I:10;5163;Fortunately, the movie does have some nice emotional scenes between Kong and Naomi Watts, giving it a balance between emotion and adrenaline.
I:10;5164;the special effects are so good, in fact, that in all honesty, King Kong is really one of those movies that NEEDS to be watched in the theater (rather than on your living room TV).
I:10;5165;4.5/5 StarsThis remake of one of the most cherished films of all time wins an award for something, a minor one, but still an award and that is that it's probably the best remake of all time.
I:10;5166;King Kong (2005) is certainly worth a look, but I must say some critical response to the running time of over three hours considering it could easily be two hours and still give the same level of emotion, but in the end the film manages to entertain for most of its long running time, as did Peter Jackson's previous films: the big screen adaptations of Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings.
I:10;5167;Director finds map to island, gets a film crew and a young actress and goes to shoot a film.

I:10;5169;"There prehistoric creatures aren't quite extinct and they end up in a fight for their live, while the director's schemes end up with the capture of the newly pronounced ""King"" Kong and ship him to New York where ."
I:10;5170;the special effects are well done and can live up to expectations, especially the ones for Kong .
I:10;5171;Regardless this new adaptation of a classic tale of Beauty and the Beast has a level of emotion the classic 1930s version lacked, and that is certainly worth an acknowledgement on it's on.
I:10;5172;In this film you can really care about Kong as more then a monster, but as an intelligent creature that just wants to be left alone.
I:10;5173;the cast was selected well, me being most surprised by how well Jack Black pulled off a dramatic role because I was expecting cheesy comic relief from him throughout the film.
I:10;5174;This film is touching and incredibly visual, but it has several weaknesses.
I:10;5175;a good film that I thoroughly enjoyed and most people will, but I can't guarantee that it can hold up to repeat viewings the way The Lord of the Rings films can.
I:10;5176;(PS: If you like the theatrical cut I highly recommend the Extended Edition.
I:10;5177;For the most part, Peter Jackson's King Kong is a fantastic thrill ride.
I:10;5178;The action sequences on Skull Island are some of the best I've ever seen, particularly the Kong Vs. T. rex battle.
I:10;5179;Also, the scenes of Kong in New York are great.
I:10;5180;Naomi Watts really makes you believe that she's acting with an actual ape and she has some affection for him in spite of the circumstances.
I:10;5181;when it arrives in my Home 2 Weeks later i see the movie and the extras the same Day.
I:10;5182;great New Escenes and Mosters.
I:10;5183;The original King Kong is one of my all time favourites.
I:10;5184;Its spirit of adventure, its complete capture of the Depression era, the fabulous effects of Willis O'Brien.
I:10;5185;It is a film that is at turns wonderful and very frustrating.
I:10;5186;Keep reading, and at the end of the review, I will mention the 'extended' edition.
I:10;5187;the first third of the film is fine, despite the criticisms of some.
I:10;5188;The scenes on Skull Island are often hyponotically intriguing, with excellent special effects.
I:10;5189;Jackson's Kong is very much an animal of its times, as was the original.
I:10;5190;Plus, he is a God).
I:10;5191;"In the original he is considered a 'harmless' adventurer, just ""enthusiastic""."
I:10;5192;In the remake he is a profoundly cynical man, and a real jerk.
I:10;5193;The original Denham was likeable.
I:10;5194;And the film always stops me when I come across it on a cable channel.
I:10;5195;It is beautifully shot, often gorgeous.
I:10;5196;The special effects are indeed special.
I:10;5197;In some ways the original was better in inspiring awe, frankly, despite all the technical ability shown in the remake.
I:10;5198;What the original implied, the remake fully explores.
I:10;5199;The scenes between Darrow and Kong are excellent, and for sure Kong is a much more expressive character.
I:10;5200;In the original we empathised with him because of our own inner feelings, whereas in the remake Kong earns our sympathy much more directly.
I:10;5201;The original was awe inspiring as an animal/man creature.
I:10;5202;Jackson loves Kong, and it shows, over and over.
I:10;5203;Jackson includes it in his version, extended it and making it even more horrific.
I:10;5204;and, in the end, demonstrating that the original film's producers were wise in cutting the sequence.
I:10;5205;The film retains all the strengths and weaknesses of the theatrical version, adding a few new strengths and weaknesses.
I:10;5206;the raft/dino sequence from the original.
I:10;5207;The sequence worked in the original and it works in the extended cut.
I:10;5208;It's very nicely done, especially the underwater stuff.
I:10;5209;it is hard to recommend spending a lot more money on the extended version if you already have the theatrical cut.
I:10;5210;CGI overkill takes away all the horror, suspense and awe of seeing Kong in the 1933 original.
I:10;5211;It makes Rick Baker in an ape suit look warm and down.
I:10;5212;The 1976 version had a great soundtrack (showing the high level of originality common to 70s music) while treating Jessica Lange as a disco.
I:10;5213;era sex object, complete with Marilyn Monroe cutesy voice, in an era where the sexual revolution was about to collide with feminism.
I:10;5214;Despite this, it is still watchable and amusing, made in an era before MTV and video games led us to Ritalin.
I:10;5215;"Popular culture in the 70s was still about ""making it new"" unlike the 2000's, where the rage is ""vintage"" and ""repro"" and living in the past."
I:10;5216;"Noami Watts is, naturally, given the ""feminist"" treatment ."
I:10;5217;The black guy on the ship is treated with careful respect at all times, though, strangely enough, the funny Chinaman from the 1930s is brought back in all its racist glory.
I:10;5218;This was fun and took us to another level of CGI Dinos even after the Jurassic Park franchise.
I:10;5219;fi movie, not Shakespeare, dudes!
I:10;5220;This extended version of Peter Jacksons remake not only honors the original but pays homage to it.
I:10;5221;After all, Jackson fans proved their loyalty by waiting close to five years to see all the chapters of LOTR, right!
I:10;5222;As good as the theatrical release was, this extended version of King Kong like the extended versions of LOTR, raise it to a higher level.
I:10;5223;Jackson also brings to fruition the original concepts of Merian C. Cooper and Edgar Wallace.
I:10;5224;Jackson brings this new version of King Kong to the screen with an absolute respect, intimacy and love, thereby elevating it to just about surpass the original.
I:10;5225;"Jackson also gives us just enough inferences to the original to make fans of the original stand up and take notice, smile inwardly, and gasp, ""Wow""!"
I:10;5226;The developing relationship between Ann and Kong is superb.
I:10;5227;"You have to create distinct characterizations, introduce them,allow time to become familar with them, give them the opportunity to stand out, so that when these characters suffer or die,
I:10;5228;Jackson is a master at this.
I:10;5229;He creates novels of moving images on screen.
I:10;5230;If you're one who loves an adventure, loves to be taken on a journey, loves exceptional movies, Then Peter Jackson's King Kong is the movie for you.
I:10;5231;This movie defies all known laws of biology and human species but is still a great fun to watch.
I:10;5232;The plot develops kind of slow in the beginning, but the second half of the film is just breathtaking till the last scene.
I:10;5233;I have always been a fan of King Kong.
I:10;5234;This one is great too.
I:10;5235;on the positive side, it looks good.
I:10;5236;On the one hand, it was a Peter Jackson film (Lord of the Rings), so I knew it would have high production values.
I:10;5237;when it starts out, we are treated to a wonderful re.
I:10;5238;who realizes he's considered washed.
I:10;5239;up by his business associates and has to come up with a way to redeem himself.
I:10;5240;"well played by Adrien Brody
I:10;5241;One of the most enjoyable scenes is when the filmmakers and crew come across some grazing dinosaurs.
I:10;5242;Something spooks them, and the herd starts stampeding in the direction of our party.
I:10;5243;It has to be one of the most exciting scenes ever filmed.
I:10;5244;there were other thrilling scenes in the jungle, as well as touching scenes between the beauty, Ann, and the beast, Kong.
I:10;5245;It was very effective, with Kong, of course, escaping and reeking havoc in Times Square.
I:10;5246;I loved the yellow cabs.
I:10;5247;A fun touch was having Kong find Ann, and together go rollicking through Central Park, ending on a frozen pond where they play around on the ice.
I:10;5248;I didn't feel anything, and I'm a big lover of animals and a big crybaby at movies.
I:10;5249;for special effects and a good visual roller coaster ride, this movie is a success.
I:10;5250;As far as a good story with well.
I:10;5251;developed characters, interesting dialogue and meaningful plot, it is a flop.
I:10;5252;This is the best remake of King Kong I have encountered.
I:10;5253;It mixes in everything from humor, great acting, great computer graphics and even prehistoric beasts.
I:10;5254;PJ is a good director.
I:10;5255;I loved the extended version.
I:10;5256;"Peter Jackson's epic retelling of ""King Kong"" may run a bit too long at nearly 3 hours but it's an admirable and fun adventure well worth taking."
I:10;5257;"Filled with wonderous Oscar winning visual effects, ""Kong"" is, indeed, the 8th Wonder of the World in this marvelous movie."
I:10;5258;Jackson manages to recreate the world of 1933 New York perfectly in this rollicking roller coaster of an adventure.
I:10;5259;"Like the original 1933 classic Jackson and his crew of visual effects artists (along with a strong cast)give ""Kong"" a sense of reality even as we see all the fantastic events in the film."
I:10;5260;"he'll bring Kong back to New York where he'll make millions (""I'll share it all with you boys"")."
I:10;5261;"I don't know how much more story Jackson has to tell with ""Kong"" but this edition of the film more than fits the bill when it comes to entertainment."
I:10;5262;scenes in the visual effects and other effects created for the film.
I:10;5263;Kong's New York, 1933 feature a discussion of the importance that vaudeville and other entertainment played in distracting a city in the middle of the depression.
I:10;5264;"It's very much in the vein of his fictional documentary ""Forgotten Silver"" and is a treat."
I:10;5265;while there isn't a commentary track for the film (we'll get that on the deluxe edition in November), the extras included here are a lot of fun to go through.
I:10;5266;That's up to you to decide but Jackson makes a memorable contemporary update of Kong retelling the story for a modern audience while staying true to the film's roots.
I:10;5267;This is the case with King Kong remake In the beginning,Carl Denam is a tongue in cheek film maker starts out the film with humor, a sheister who is very ambitious.
I:10;5268;He is one step ahead of prison, but has visions of success, and is very driven by his ambitions.
I:10;5269;After a tremendous fight with the horrible local villagers the film maker's boat crew manage to capture King Kong and take him back to New York where the film maker will be hailed as a hero.
I:10;5270;everything is WAY TOO BIG and grand, like your typical 21st century epic, with grand special effects and big, large scenes.
I:10;5271;Naomi Watts is beautiful and athletic, and is more adept in action than acting.
I:10;5272;The scenes of 1930's New York are excellent, the film maker does a good job on capturing that bygone era.
I:10;5273;this is a good movie to watch now that it's hit the bargain rack.
I:10;5274;This a very good movie with a great story line and great action movie.
I:10;5275;I really liked this one better than the first one.
I:10;5276;The story is good too.
I:10;5277;I highly recommend this blue ray.
I:10;5278;You know, I really enjoyed this film.
I:10;5279;But I mean that in a good way.
I:10;5280;Jackson doesn't mind combining good acting by good actors with an interesting premise and a load of special effects fun.
I:10;5281;I also couldn't help but wonder about the incredible discoveries made on the island and how that would've rocked the world.
I:10;5282;An undiscovered race of aboriginal people!
I:10;5283;Considering this it seems a bit silly that the best Carl Denham can do is stage a show we're he displays a chained up Kong.
I:10;5284;Jackson deals with all this by asking us not to think about.
I:10;5285;I enjoyed this more than any film of it's type since Jurassic Park.
I:10;5286;I hope the director stays interested in big epics.
I:10;5287;That's where it gets interesting so I sat and watched the rest.
I:10;5288;And I have to admit that it was pretty darn good.
I:10;5289;The time went fast with all the magnificent special effects.
I:10;5290;And even if I thought the plot of Kong and Ann Darrow (played this time by Naomi Watts) silly, it did manage to be touching at times.
I:10;5291;i think anyone can enjoy this movie once.
I:10;5292;It's a good popcorn movie.
I:10;5293;"Let me get the ""good"" things about this film out of the way: The super."
I:10;5294;wide angle aerial shots of NYC were beautiful.
I:10;5295;She had the look of a woman who was desperate for attention .
I:10;5296;just absurd, and unintentionally hilarious.
I:10;5297;All she does is dance, juggle, and scream.
I:10;5298;"The early reviews were some of the best ever for a ""popcorn"" film, and King Kong lives up to that acclaim."
I:10;5299;For pure action, excitement and cinema awe, there is no equal.
I:10;5300;Audiences are glued to their seats during the chase and fight scenes, and many people are moved to tears with the tender moments between Kong and Ann (Naomi Watts).
I:10;5301;Dinosaurs inhabit the island, but the king beast is Kong, a massive ape.
I:10;5302;jaws T. rexs during his daily activities.
I:10;5303;Unlike previous incarnations of this story, Peter Jackson's version of King Kong allows the Ape and the girl to actually bond.
I:10;5304;"In the PC world, he doesn't like her ""only"" because she is beautiful and blonde
I:10;5305;the photography is beautiful, from the haunting jungles of Skull Island to the flapper.
I:10;5306;Of course, the film's iconic moment takes place stop the Empire State Building, a scene brought to life under a stunning Monet.
I:10;5307;The most awesome visual feature is Kong himself.
I:10;5308;The performances fit the story perfectly, with Jack Black irresistible as the gung.
I:10;5309;The effects, sets, costumes, etc all show how great movies can look when their monumental budgets are used responsibly.
I:10;5310;i think the movie opened brilliantly, with the zoo, the depression, and Ann Moss.
I:10;5311;Another thing is that the movie just FEELS so realistic .
I:10;5312;it's the perfect collaboration of emotion, action, CGI digital special effects, superb acting, themes and deeper meanings, and a whole lot more, all coupled into a 3 hour film narrative.
I:10;5313;the movie actually has a heart .
I:10;5314;Infact, the movie is so emotinally touching that it even caused me to shed some tears.
I:10;5315;hmm, onto the CGI digital effects.
I:10;5316;General cinematography is also takes a better direction this time around, Peter Jackson really knows how to direct with snazzy yet down.
I:10;5317;On from the visuals, I had high hopes for the musical score to succeed as well as it would had Peter Jackson accepted Howard Shore's probably incredible effort.
I:10;5318;I look foward to picking the score up, sooner than later, too.
I:10;5319;King Kong is a masterpiece, folks .
I:10;5320;a fantastic film that won't, in all likelyhood, disappoint.
I:10;5321;yet I was gobsmacked, regardless.
I:10;5322;So do yourself a favor, and go see it.
I:10;5323;Great acting, nifty story, beyond adaquate effects, magnificently thrilling moments, and an ultimately poignant adventure, and ultra.
I:10;5324;ummm, yeah, I'll get back to you on the rest of the cons some other time.
I:10;5325;there is a scene or two that is just full blown that you can just see this green screen effect, but entirely the movie is great and long.
I:10;5326;While the new King Kong movie is not the modern masterpiece that Jackson's Tolkien trilogy is, it still has its share of amazing scenes.
I:10;5327;The scene where Kong fights three T. Rex's is worth the price of admission all by itself.
I:10;5328;"The special effects are generally excellent
I:10;5329;up relationship between Watts' and Brody's characters, but again the movie comes through where it counts, expertly delivering a big dose of tragedy in the main Kong.
I:10;5330;Overall, though, I definitely enjoyed King Kong 2005 a lot.
I:10;5331;It pretty much met my expectations and even lived up to the trailer (for a change)!!
I:10;5332;Naomi Watts and Adrian Brody are excellent leads in this blockbuster type movie.
I:10;5333;i think the special effects are still stunning and effective, but the love story and the many excellent supporting roles among the crew members keep this movie a step ahead.
I:10;5334;From everything I had seen about the movie, in game form and in trailer form, at best I had hoped to not hate it.
I:10;5335;I never dreamed I would love it.
I:10;5336;nice ape visuals with vague characters and action sequences.
I:10;5337;I loved almost every minute of this movie.
I:10;5338;At its heart, I found genuine feeling and was actually touched.
I:10;5339;Best love story I have seen in a long, long time.
I:10;5340;Oh yea, and the effects were good:)
I:10;5341;"(David Lynch's rework of ""The Fly"" meets both critieria very well."
I:10;5342;"The problem with Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" redo is that there's no way to ""improve"" on one of the greatest films ever made, without changing it beyond recognition."
I:10;5343;It's one of the great cinematic moments, its effectiveness deriving from its in.your.
I:10;5344;like/nightmare elements that made the original a classic.
I:10;5345;"this realism, in turn, greatly weakens the original's ""beauty and the beast"" conceit."
I:10;5346;century view, fostered by NatGeo specials, that gorillas are intelligent, affectionate creatures .
I:10;5347;Well, when you love a beast .
I:10;5348;The new Kong, sympathetic throughout, doesn't evoke this contrast of emotions.
I:10;5349;But the new version has Ann showing a great deal of affection for Kong .
I:10;5350;the original was a model of terseness, starting slowly, but never stopping once it got up to speed.
I:10;5351;"The first hour of Jackson's version (which is actually quite good) shows that he (mostly) understands ""structure"" and ""pace"", but the rest of the film is a hotch."
I:10;5352;there is /one/ sequence that shows how good this film might have been.
I:10;5353;The initial encounter with the natives and Ann's subsequent capture is much superior to the original .
I:10;5354;far more atmospheric, better staged, and more exciting.
I:10;5355;Jackson has so altered the original .
I:10;5356;the original remains exciting (and silly).
I:10;5357;Much of the film is just plain beautiful (though I do miss the Dor skies of the original), and is, technically, one of the most.
I:10;5358;startling films you'll ever see.
I:10;5359;"And the Army officer, griping about Kong's invasion of the ""sacred"" New York, calls him a ""mutant monkey""."
I:10;5360;"***** There is probably no other movie in which most of the film is a continuous ""chase"" sequence, with barely a moment's rest."
I:10;5361;Peter Jackson does a great story justice with a modern twist.
I:10;5362;The film is best shown in blu.
I:10;5363;Excellent movie, cinematography, special effects.
I:10;5364;New scenes make Kong more 'human'.
I:10;5365;Naomi is truly drop dead gorgeous!
I:10;5366;Even if you do not like Kong or the dinosaurs or the giant bugs or the eerie Skull Island, if you enjoy watching a truly beautiful woman, then this film is for you!
I:10;5367;It is some of the best fantasy filmmaking to date.
I:10;5368;men that are telling you all of your ideas rock, and get some filmmaking help that shoots it to you straight.
I:10;5369;He took several hundred bullet wounds on Skull Island and you're telling me a couple of hits from a plane did him in?
I:10;5370;Peter Jackson's loving and overbloated tribute to one of the greatest films of all time.
I:10;5371;I really liked parts of it.
I:10;5372;Most of the scenes with Kong are amazing.
I:10;5373;So lifelife and so much emotion from the character.
I:10;5374;Attention to detail (you can see every hair on the gorilla, the lighting on Kong during the Tyrannasaurus batte in the vines)is on the spot.
I:10;5375;Clothing looked pretty good too.
I:10;5376;Maybe it's that big fur coat that keeps her warm?Anyway, loved Kong.
I:10;5377;Best special effects I have ever seen in a film.
I:10;5378;resplendant in the brilliant sunlight.
I:10;5379;This was a fantastic remake by Peter Jackson.
I:10;5380;I am a big fan of the Original King Kong and I enjoyed Peter Jackson's remake.
I:10;5381;if you are into behind the scenes detail, you will LOVE this.
I:10;5382;it's all just tremendously engrossing.
I:10;5383;I own this set along with the theatrical version (along with the original 1933 version) and I am happy to have all three.
I:10;5384;Jackson had all sorts of success from Lord of the Rings, but I wasn't sure if he could come up with great movies like that consistently, and especially with a classic story like Kong!
I:10;5385;It turns out that Peter Jackson can in fact come up with great movies consistently, and this is because of his ability as not only as a great director, but also as a great storyteller.
I:10;5386;sounds like the same old Kong story, but what sets it apart was how well the story was put together and the little details that were added to make the movie so much more realistic and emotional.
I:10;5387;Still more amazing detail in the dinosaur fight scenes too.
I:10;5388;Here, Ann tells Kong that his island is beautiful by pointing and putting her hand to her heart.
I:10;5389;Later in the movie, back in New York, while pearched on top of the Empire State building, Kong points to the rising sun over the New York skyline and starts pointing and putting his hand over his heart.
I:10;5390;I can't remember the last time I cried in a movie, but as soon as Kong did this, it brought a tear to my eye thinking about what was about to happen.
I:10;5391;Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and the other directors/writers that worked on this movie are genius.
I:10;5392;the special effects were superb.
I:10;5393;After that, the amount of realism was great.
I:10;5394;Andy Sirkis did an amazing job as Kong, as well as playing another role in the movie as Lumpy the cook.
I:10;5395;Someone that I was with got vertigo from these scenes.
I:10;5396;I also want my wife to watch it.
I:10;5397;The only problem with this movie is that it is long, and you really should have uninterrupted time to enjoy it.
I:10;5398;The romance of this movie really comes to life, and you will be heartbroken for poor Kong long before his final demise.
I:10;5399;He plays the role of a real jerk, and is perfect for it.
I:10;5400;Give me the original anytime.
I:10;5401;Naomi Watts who plays an actress desperate to make it big and she comes across a director (played by Jack Black) who is determined to hit the big time but in an unorthodox way.
I:10;5402;enough of that before i give the movie away but this is packed with amazing action and as you have probably already seen amazing special effects.
I:10;5403;top movie and i highly recommend.
I:10;5404;because it is extremely outstanding to have it if you would like to enjoy the new story and new movements of animals and Kong, and it's no longer boring.
I:10;5405;They travel to Skull Island to shoot a new film, but when they find out a legendary beast and dangerous natives live on the island, their quest and curiosity puts them against Kong, the natives, and his dinosaur enemies, and while the crew attempt to catch the legendary creature, Kong's attention is captivated by a beautiful woman named Ann Darrow, which allows for the explorers to capture him and bring him to New York, where Kong's future involves commercial exploitation.
I:10;5406;It's just so random that Kong makes it's jaw dangle, that it's hilarious!
I:10;5407;If you love special effects, you MUST see this film!
I:10;5408;The stampede sequence alone will leave your jaw dropping, and Kong looks excellent!
I:10;5409;The ending left much to be desired, but it's still a good ending.
I:10;5410;After seeing this for the first time, I wish I saw it in theatres!King Kong is the best remake I've ever seen thus far (and I am not a fan of remakes), and one of the best films of 2005.
I:10;5411;My eyes were glued to the screen.
I:10;5412;I think this is Peter Jackson's best film thus far, I'm not a fan of the LotR trilogy, but I've seen most of his other films, and this tops them all.
I:10;5413;"If you're looking for action, adventure, or an excellent love story, you'll definitely do yourself a favor by checking out ""King Kong""."
I:10;5414;awesome,very happy great movie and statue.
I:10;5415;received in great shape, statue is very cool.
I:10;5416;All the things I heard about it on tv and read about it made it sound like it was going to be one of those epic remakes with some great computer generated stunts and other eye candy effects.
I:10;5417;Plus a great story line that kept the movie moving.
I:10;5418;This is an epic movie, from finish to start.
I:10;5419;The acting and special effects are top notch, Naomi Watts is awesome (she's one of my fave actresses).
I:10;5420;I love Adrian Brody as well, he adds to the movie for the hero factor.
