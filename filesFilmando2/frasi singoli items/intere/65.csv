1;My Children are ages 13 and 16 and they really liked it.
2;Even though it is an older movie it kept their attention!
3;Watched it about 6 times now and we just got it a few weeks ago.
4;I really enjoyed the movie and thought it was a classic i have never seen anything like it, it's amazing.
5;Retrospectively, it is a compelling story that pulls you right in the center of it.
6;dominated film, but that's one of the main reason why it's so great.
7;It reminded me so much of my childhood, a time when we were just blissfully imaginative and carefree.
8;When this film ends, you're just a little bit smarter.
9;trust me.you'll thank me later.
10;Watching it again recently, I discovered the rich plot, and deeply developed characters.
11;It's a childhood adventure of a unique kind.
12;One of my favorite movies.
13;Watching this movie brought a lot of nostalgic memories.
14;A great story about friendship and youth and the adventures that come with it.
15;Each of the four friends does at least some growing up on their journey .
16;Teddy is the wild kid in this film, whose dad was a military man who stormed the beach at Normandy , as we hear quite often in the movie.
17;Teddy is kind of a nutcase, but he seems to at least have dreams, and to try to have some integrity when it counts.
18;I thought he was a pretty good character.
19;Vern, played by Jerry O'Connell, is a good kid too, by his lights.
20;John Cusack, in one of his early appearances, is really warm and sympathetic here.
21;It makes you glad he's had such a terrific career.
22;Wil Wheaton is the main character, and he is terrific.
23;He is very convincing as the introspective kid who wonders if being introspective makes him weird .
24;Also, I want to say that I really enjoyed the story he tells, of the pie eating contest.
25;The film carries a nice message, too, in the way Chris is shown to find the ability to rise above his poor background and eventually make something of himself in life.
26;basically, you walk away from this movie feeling thoughtful, and pleasantly melancholy.
27;I found myself full of warm memories of young friendships, and things that can only be shared between friends close enough to get down and dirty, cussing out each others mothers, and still hang out afterwards and share some Pez and root beer.
28;One of my favorite movies.
29;This is a must for the collection.
30;My son and I will enjoy watching this.
31;stand by Me is the ultimate reflection of the adventures that I would have loved to experience when I was young.
32;The body of a boy his own age that had mysteriously disappeared!
33;If you have had to deal with these problem's you will definately be able to relate.
34;Jerry O' Connell has done film's such as Mission to Mars, and Scream 2.)
35;stand By Me paint's a picture of childhood in all of it's horror's and triumph's, capturing the uncertain time before girl's and becoming men.
36;Its a real good summer time classic.
37;this is a great heartwarming great family movie.
38;i love this movie so much.
39;I was shocked to hear their mouths and see the characters in action.
40;since this movie was created in the 80's its market was for people alive today.
41;Place yourself in thier shoes and put your childhood friends faces on them and live it.
42;Its touching to see the ending and it makes you miss your friends of yesteryear.
43;I hope you enjoy the movie.
44;If your open minded and love a truelife like story then you will enjoy it over and over again.
45;If your looking for a happy ending dont get this movie you will be disapointed.
46;Stand By Me has to be the best film by actor/director Rob Reiner.
47;What a supporting cast, full of young talented actors way back in good old 1986, Wil Wheaton, a very plump Jerry O'Connell, Corey Feldman, and the late River Pheonix.
48;Pheonix carries this coming of age story the whole way through the film.
49;Well at least his younger brother Joaquin has his talent as well, what a wonderful actor River was.
50;Sweet, moving, and sometimes funny film.
51;Stand By Me is a ptich.
52;perfect film, I highly recommend it to young teenagers, great friendship film, a true winner!
53;THis story will take you back to your preteen years.
54;I always wanted to write a story about my childhood years and this one would have come pretty close.
55;get the deluxe edition with the special features.
56;"Comes with a special featurette ""Walking the tracks: The summer of stand by me"" which interviews all the actors and director."
57;Very insightful companion to the movie.
58;I loved the story, maybe because i never had an adventure like that.
59;Regardless, this is a classic and must see.
60;a trip down memory lane.
61;It is still a great story and very enjoyable to watch.
62;stand By Me, Rob Reiner's 1986 bittersweet coming of age story based on Stephen King's novella The Body, is definitely one of those movies that move me.
63;reiner, working from a well.
64;written screenplay by Raymond Gideon and Bruce A. Evans, excellently captures King's nostalgia.
65;Even Feldman, a child actor I really did not like in other films before his career flopped, is heartbreakingly poignant as Teddy Duchamp, the son of a mentally.
66;Despite being scarred by his father's harsh punishments, Teddy is proud of his father's wartime service.
67;The heart and soul of this movie comes from the friendship between Gordie Lachance (Wheaton), the sensitive would.
68;reiner shines as a director capable of mixing moments of comedy (watch for a hilarious exchange revolving around the mystery surrounding Goofy's identity .
69;"a particularly effective narration by Richard Dreyfuss (who plays the adult Gordon Lachance) adds just the right mix of wry humor and bittersweet nostalgia, and Jack Nitzsche's gentle and subtle score, with its interpolation of the classic rock 'n' roll song ""Stand By Me"" just heightens the poignancy of this affecting tale of boyhood friendship."
70;this is a rare story from steven king about every day kids on a mission to try to find a dead kid before the bullies find him.
71;this is a great one to watch maybe some can relate to them in a way.
72;This is one of Rob Reiner's best.
73;A classic tale about growing up and it's narrated by Richard Dreyfuss, which is the icing on the cake.
74;lOVED it since I was a kid.
75;and I LOVE this cool cover.
76;I got the autograph 2 but funny thing is, it's not from this movie.
77;he's my FAVORITE actor and is just SO COOL!
78;it was a nice surprise though and I REALLY like how the characters are SO similar.
79;This was one of my favorite movies growing up.
80;It's hauntingly beautiful and so poignant when it comes to the relationships of adolescent boys.
81;All four of these child actors did a tremendous job and have a genuine connection.
82;"age films, ""Stand by Me"" has stood the test of time to become a classic."
83;Since most of the other reviews talk about the plot, I'll just talk about my opinion of the movie.
84;Everything about this movie was executed perfectly.
85;the writing, the performances, the direction, the score.
86;Based on a Stephen King short story, the audience is treated to the joys.
87;and pains, of growing up.
88;Stand by me I have to say is one of my favorite movies of all time,it's one of those movies that I could watch over and over, and it's still so good to me.
89;It's just a really good movie about four friends who truly care about eachother, and the experiances they go through on there journey.
90;I loved the actors, the story line, the setting, just everything about it I loved.
91;This movie is funny, and also sad.
92;It will touch some people out there, and I deffinitely reccomend it to anyone who wants so see a real, good movie.
93;This was a great coming of age story similar to Goonies (With One Actor From That Movie), but much more realistic in its content.
94;all young men will be able to identify with htis movie.
95;The whole cast is superb, but Kiefer Sutherland is really great as Ace Merrill.
96;The best part, I think, is that Stand By Me evokes emotions.
97;I find myself getting wrapped up in this movie every time I watch it and that's really what movies are about.
98;It's one of my favorite movies, and I would definitely recommend reading The Body, which is the novella that the movie is based on.
99;What I got was something completely opposite yet equally engaging.
100;Instead of a horror film or even a tense thriller, we are presented with a deeply moving story about friendship, relationships and boyhood.
101;"`Stand by Me' is a beautifully told story of adolescence
I:8763;102;gordie, Chris, Teddy and Vern are on the brink of their teenage years.
I:8763;103;the movie is not perfect, but in parts it is grand.
I:8763;104;the performances by the four young boys were all good, some great, some even superb.
I:8763;105;Corey Feldman is an annoying celebrity (now that is) but when you separate his personal Hollywood existence from this performance you can see that he did a very good job.
I:8763;106;He played the misunderstood kid, or in other words he played a normal kid, and he did it well.
I:8763;107;Jerry O'Connell also does a fine job here at being a normal (albeit overweight) kid.
I:8763;108;He does a fine job in the end, but overall he was a little one.
I:8763;109;Kiefer Sutherland delivers a memorable and engaging supporting performance as Ace, the town bully"
110;I was drawn to his every move, his every word, his every action and his character development was extraordinary.
111;in the end I have to recommend this movie.
112;It could have been tightened in a few areas (I would have liked a little tension, and the removal of the narration would have been ideal) but the film is still a wonderfully fulfilling and rewarding journey through the tragedies as well as the blessings of adolescence.
113;Sprinkled with some wonderful performances and some poignant life lessons, `Stand by Me' is one of those touching buddy flicks you just can't help but adore.
114;It was such an awesome movie when it first came out, and I enjoyed it just as much 20 years later.
115;Love the updated interviews with the cast and crew.
116;Twenty seven years later it stands the test of time and remains as beautiful and poignant, with its' humorous and starkly sad moments.
117;I love Stand by Me .
118;Well written and well directed.
119;Great actors and original story by Stephen king is awesome.
120;This a classic movie about growing up and the friends you had.
121;I can relate to a few of the things in this movie.
122;I highly recommend this movie to anyone growing up or wanting to look back on there youth.
123;The whole movie is perfect.
124;I loved the Summer of Stand By Me documentary, it was a very well done extra.
125;I hated Richard Dreyfuss in it because he acted like it was just anther paycheck to him, while the rest of the cast said how much they loved making the movie.
126;it was also a rare case.
127;this movie is a must have for any and every River Phoenix fan!
128;Even if you don't like or know River Phoenix, I highly recommend this movie to any adult/young adult with that lingering 'big kid' inside of em'!
129;Two thumbs up, and six stars .
130;Stand By Me is easily one of my favorite movies ever.
131;The storyline might not seem like much, but once you see it, you will like it.
132;I saw it when I was young and I still love it.
133;The special features are good.
134;Theres bonus trailers, too, and more special features.
135;A true classic that shows a view of what life used to be like for the young growing up in the now lost America.
136;Our whole family loves this movie.
137;I watched it when I was quite young and we recently let our 10 year old watch it with us and she too loved the movie.
138;A great coming of age story.
139;Our son has wanted this movie for years and we didnt know it till his wife told us so we got this for part of his christmas gift.
140;This movie draws you in, time and time again.
141;perfect for ages 12 and up.
142;great messages about life and what can/can.
143;This 1986 film directed by Rob Reiner is, without a doubt, the best film adaption of any piece of work from horror maestro Stephen King.
144;It's a magical journey back to youth and the fun adventures you'd have as a kid.
145;Along the way, they encounter the town bully, played wonderfully by Kiefer Sutherland.
146;I have always thought Dreyfuss had a great voice, and it is put to great use here.
147;It's a special movie that will rekindle fond memories of your own childhood.
148;Most people might not of gone on such a big and odd journey as these guys, but I'm sure almost anybody can relate to that special time in life.
149;Reiner did a great job.
150;I had heard great things about it, and as it turns out, they were all true, and Stand By Me has become my favourite film of all time.
151;This trip proves a catalyst for some strong feeling to emerge, about growing up, growing apart,their families, life in their town and their own mortality.
152;The friendship the four boys share, particularly Gordie and Chris is so touching, but again realisticly portrayed.
153;The acting is phenomenal, no other word for it.
154;The performances Reiner has captured from his cast are fantastic, and he has really captured the atmospherere of Steven Kings' wonderful novella.
155;This is a rare film in that it is realistic, bittersweet, hilarious in parts, but also heartbreaking.
156;This is a film that has a permanent positive effect on your life, as it makes you reconsider what you hold as valuable.
157;Stand By Me has gotta be one of the best films ever to be made!
158;i would definately recommend this film to ANYONE!
159;most of my friends love it too!
160;also the extra features are brilliant.
161;it'll be worth every penny!!!
162;Stephen King has a knack for writing great, memorable characters and profanely funny dialogue.
163;This one is mostly a character study, and a very entertaining one at that.
164;The tone and mood are absolutely perfect.
165;The music and score are also a force to be reckoned with.
166;i first bought this on video about a decade ago.
167;There is a great commentary, the music video, trailers, and a Featurette with most of the cast, Stephen King, and Rob Reiner.
168;It was really great to see the cast all together again (with the exception of River Phoenix) and just how much everyone has changed in fifteen years.
169;Great story of how deep childhood friendships can be and howthose relationships can shape us.
170;Stand By Me is a must and own for everyone!
171;Its a great tale of friendship.
172;From the first time I saw this movie when I was young, until now, its always been one of my favorites!
173;If you havent seen it by some chance, watch it, youll love it!
174;It is easy to understand why.
175;Phoenix's outstanding performance sparkles in this movie and reminds us what a talent the world lost.
176;In addition, the brilliant performances by the rest of the lead actors (Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, Kiefer Sutherland) make this movie a must.
177;It is a glorious story that will make you laugh, cry, and sit back and remember what it was like to be young and determined to make your place in the world.
178;One of the best movies ever made!
179;Rob Reiner and Stephen King and all the actors have given us a wonderful gift.
180;One is smart, another is a take.
181;charge type, the third is an odd.
182;"This movie is right up there with ""The Sandlot."""
183;there isn't much else to say that hasn't already been said, but if you enjoy gilded nostalgia about childhood, especially boyhood, you can probably relate to this film, and will get swept away!Two personal bonuses: John Cusack's cameo as Gordie's deceased football star brother.
184;Highly recommended for kids and anyone who enjoys watching a good movie.
185;The encapsulated childhood that Rob Reiner and Stephen King rendered in Stand By Me is almost unparalleled.
186;Nearly every adult can view this film and completely relate to the content, the emotion, and the characters.
187;unlike The Goonies, Monster Squad, or any of the other great 80s kid adventures, this is a much more realistic, very adult story.
188;the BD itself is quite wonderful.
189;It has a marvelous picture.
190;They share many, many memories from the set, their performances, some very poignant moments regarding River (you can see that his passing still affects them all very strongly), and even point out some very entertaining easter eggs and mistakes in the film.
191;Luckily, it is captured by Rob Reiner's excellent direction and the four boys' incredible acting.
192;Throughout this trip, they learn more about themselves and each other than they could ever imagine.
193;This comedy/drama is simply incredible.
194;Wil Wheaton is brilliant as Gordie, the would.
195;The late River Phoenix gives an unforgettable performance as Chris.
196;Corey Feldman plays the wild and crazy Teddy with great effect, and Jerry O'Connell is hysterical as Vern.
197;Kiefer Sutherland is also excellent as Ace, while John Cusack makes a good cameo performance as Gordie's deceased brother Denny.
198;Rob Reiner directs with a keen and knowing eye, giving the blend of humor and drama just the right touch.
199;Great shape and a great price.
200;Setting and Theme(s): Castlerock, smallville, summer friends' adventure, life's lessons, solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown.
201;this 1986 instant classic of Rob Reiner's directing earns its spot on the mantle of other inimitable works of film.
202;"The musical score is dramatic, it sets the tempo from start to finish, and it never misses a beat
I:8763;203;The ending is the real gravy.
I:8763;204;The narration is superb also.
I:8763;205;by far one of the favorite films of my youth.
I:8763;206;With a smidgen of ambition toward adventure, which will take your there, the healing power of the wilderness can become appreciated.
I:8763;207;Although movies and books alone can never fully capture the true splendor of the outdoors.
I:8763;208;five stars for Reiners finest photoplay.
I:8763;209;This is a good movie about four friends who make a journey together to try and find a died boy.
I:8763;210;Stand By Me is a Coming of Age story that is based on a real event from Stephen King's childhood.
I:8763;211;This is one of my favorites to watch, all them young actors and they did such a great job in their roles.
I:8763;212;Very much an enjoyable watch.
I:8763;213;This movie is fun to watch, I did with my teenage grandsons.
I:8763;214;Best Stephen King story ever.
I:8763;215;This is a movie everyone has enjoyed.
I:8763;216;There is action, adventure, drama, and comedy fused into one movie that stands as another timeless classic.
I:8763;217;They find the boy they are looking for, but there is one small detail that I forgot to mention: The boy was killed.
I:8763;218;The movie is enjoyable in many ways and I would consider it a classic.
I:8763;219;Well acted, well adapted from the Stephen King novella, well shot, well written, well produced, and well directed + done.
I:8763;220;A true classic hands down.
I:8763;221;I have always been fascinated by this film.
I:8763;222;run theater surprise, I bought the VCR edition later, and today I bought the Deluxe Edition because it seemed to offer some more stuff because it had a 2nd disk.
I:8763;223;Rob goes into hilarious detail about the train.
I:8763;224;The editing on these interviews is superb and a Corey Feldman remark, for instance, segues perfectly with a remark from Jerry O'Connell now grownup, too"
225;A must see coming of age film for any boy.
226;I will robably watch it with him and my grandkids when the time comes.
227;Corey Feldman is great in it.
228;The music video is great.
229;Unforgettable performances by cast of youngsters.
230;i really enjoy this movie i have seen it like more than 100 times and still i am not tired of it.
231;A really good movie, encourage all to watch it.
232;Conversations between the kids is something that we can relate.
233;I love being able to watch a movie when I want and this has always been one of my favorites.
234;Great coming of age movie!!
235;Outstanding performances by great young actors would go for starters.
236;The interaction between four boys on a search for a dead body during the late 1950s makes this film a classic!I had to laugh my head off at numerous parts of the movie .
237;the movie captures much of the essance of what kids are like between 6th and 7th grade.
238;A slice of sentimentalism from the mid 80s spiced with adventurism and bawdy humor, a look back at an idyllic summer in the 1950s.
239;age film and one of the most important movies ever made.
240;Pubertal transformation is particularly subject to lush romanticizing.
241;pubertal boys create a treehouse culture, a separate world from the world of females and the world of adults.
242;It's full of boasts, smokes, and card games.
243;Stand by Me moves a couple degrees from innocence to experience.
244;Languorous summer tenses into autumn, smoky and chilled.
245;old buddies and their nonchalant homoeroticism, of teary heart.
246;"this is the greatest gay film of all time, not ""Philadelphia"" or ""Parting Glances"" or ""Burnt Money."""
247;The tenderness between Gordie and Chris is so natural, so easy, because it occurs in a world not yet policed by the taboos of adult society and not yet hardened by requirements for macho display.
248;I believe this film inspired the more recent film, Now and Then.
249;A heartwarming and emotional film.
250;Of course, he loved it too.
251;This is a fun movie.
252;brings back memories of when I was a kid and watched it.
253;i got it for a friend and I'm sure we will be watching christmas day.
254;This is one of my all time favorite movies and has been since I was a little girl.
255;This movie is amazing, timeless, and never gets old.
256;Many can relate to the relationships between the four 12 year old main characters of the film.
257;I was close to the age of the boys when this movie came out, so this has always been a childhood favorite of mine.
258;watched this, and it was just as majestic and thought provoking as the first time I viewed it.
259;I think the reason this story works so well is the superb character development.
260;Reiner does an exceptional job pulling you into the boys lives.
261;Also the era and environment the boys live in seems so real.
262;Acting is also very good, and Dreyfuss does a great job as the narrator.
263;The ending is a little somber, but that's what makes this movie so great.
264;There's a roller coaster of emotions, and you're along for the ride.
265;If you like movies that will have you thinking about them long after you're done viewing them, this one is for you.
266;Stand by me is one of my favorite movies.
267;I thouroughly enjoyed this story and hope my grandson does also, very believable and typical of the times, think it is a good gift
268;The acting in such young people is superb, most notably by the late, great River Phoenix.
269;It pulls at the heartstrings at times, and can also enrage you at other times.
270;There are also laughs included, but it's a serious piece with all the poignancy that you'd expect from Rob Reiner, a director's director.
271;I recommend this highly, but I would not suggest it for anyone under the age of 14.
272;Wonderful film with wonderful child actors.
273;warming movie and so well done.
274;This is one of my faves of all time!
275;I loved watching it again one more time!
276;This film is truly emotionally superior compared to the films of that year.
277;All in all this is a great film with the scene when they find out after having a waterfight in a pond they are covered in leeches (yuck) and having to run from being trampled by a train.
278;Still one of my favorites throughout the years.
279;Brings back so many experiences and emotions.
280;Highly recommend this movie everyone.
281;Stand By Me will take you back to your childhood.
282;You will feel good even after the movie is over!!
283;Rob Reiner and Stephen King collaborated on this classic and the wealth of their talent resulted in the sort of movie that's good every time it's seen.
284;This is one of those movies that captures the story on which it was based, learns from it, and becomes something great indeed.
285;At times funny, awkward and carefree, at others frightening, poignant, tragic, and starkly realistic, Stand By Me Is probably the best adaptation of a Stephen King work that's ever been done.
286;Well, they acted like pros at it!
287;Very funny, sweet and I can't watch this countless times and still be interested.
288;Unlike most Hollywood films made today it is honest, authentic, rich, and has fantastic acting.
289;This movie is one of the best Stephen King adaption.
290;And what a wonderful story.
291;I can watch this movie over and over again.
292;I recommend this movie to everyone i know.
293;Rob Reiner like George Lucas knows that music is a powerful instrument which will lead the audience in a nostalgic condition of mind.
294;So let's forget the improbable plot of STAND BY ME and enjoy the adventures of Chris and Gordie.
295;What is interesting in this movie, apart of the nostalgic feelings that arise in our hearts, is the tragic atmosphere surrounding the trip of these young kids.
296;Stand by Me is a necessary viewing film because it highlights the impact our youth had on our adult lives.
297;In addition, the values of friendship, loyalty, perseverance and bravery are hallmarks of the film.
298;It is great for discovering how to be a kid , and how to deal with that.
299;Heck, even they don't know why, but they've got to see it.
300;a long time favorite and key film from my youth based on a story by a key writer from my youth.
301;This movie brings back great memories of being a kid in the 50's and all the fun things that went with it.
302;Sterling performances by the late River Pheonix and Cory Feldman aside, this movie captures the soul of youth and the destruction of innocence with consumate ease and sensitivity.
303;bob Reiner, better known for Spinal Tap before this, is confident in his delivery of what has ultimately become a classic tale of childhood's end.
304;this is a pretty good movie, the story and characters are awesome.
305;this has to be one of the best buddy stories ever told.
306;this is a great movie.
307;Two of them (Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix) are mature and self.
308;The result is an affecting tale of how the macabre and menacing can intrude on childhood innocence, evoking the bittersweet moment when one knows that the magic of childhood is fading and adulthood looms ahead.
309;This touching film, based on a novella by Stephen King, brilliantly sums up its themes with one of the best final lines in the movies.
310;I was a member of a small group of friends, we were so close only the way childhood friends could be and I still remember all of them.
311;This was one of our favorite movies to watch, those brave kids going out on adventure with just their wits and loyalty to each other.
312;I hope everyone had those few childhood friends.
313;Great movie i use to watch on vhs all the time growing up.
314;Watching these kids make a journey and narrate their troubled adolescent lives was an excellent spectacle.
315;This movie is great for understanding social issues that face many middle class families and communities when a rare spectacle occurs.
316;It's superbly acted by everyone and has so much more meaning than just another kids flick.
317;Wil Wheaton is great as Gordy, the sad doy eyed kid with a father who is about as sensitive as a brick wall and an imagination that could sell about as many stories as Stephen King.
318;River Phoenix was stupendous as always, showing warmth and charm and such great talent.
319;Corey was funny and disturbing, classic Feldman acting.
320;But I love that guy, he adds the flavor to this movie.
321;As an even added bonus we get two scenes with the always favorite John Cusask, as Gordy's deceased brother Denny.
322;I was pleasantly surprised with the wonderful features, including the really cool behind the scenes featurette, featuring of course the entire cast looking so much older.
323;Listening to their stories was about as entertaning as the film.
324;Beside that, I grew up watching this movie as a kid and always loved it.
325;It was one of those movies that has everything.
326;The actors are amazing in their roles.
327;The scenes between Phoenix and Wheaton are exceptionally good.
328;Kiefer Sutherland is amazingly convincing in his role as the leader of a gang of bullies who always torment the four boys.
329;Directed by Rob Reiner, this film will always be a classic in my eyes.
330;The kid should have been nominated that year for best supporting actor he was so damn good in this movie.
331;all the kids here are amazing.
332;Their acting is better then most adult actors i've seen.
333;this is classic Americana by a classic American author.
334;Comedy, action, nostaglia, cool soundtrack, and some talented acting.
335;Rob Reiner's best piece of work and River Pheonix's memorable performace make this a gem.
336;This movie I feel is a family movie very interesting I feel likeit is a story when I was a kid and no I'm only a young man.
337;This is one of my top 10 movies.
338;This story can make you think of your childhood and the times you had.
339;This is easily one of my favorite films from my teenage years.
340;For many reasons, this film resonates with emotional nostalgia for any man who remembers their early pre.
341;That's what this film captures: the magic of being a young boy.
342;I staunchly defended the dialogue, to this day for that matter, knowing full well that when boys are alone together they are more likely to rebel against talking conventionally.
343;The four lead child actors here are all excellent.
344;Director Rob Reiner is, at least in this film, a genuine miracle worker.
345;It is a rare film that has this many child actors with this much talent and intelligence conveying what it's like to be a kid at heart.
346;There is plenty of wit and good old.
347;"fashioned toilet humor, which is the flavor of the day with young boys
I:8763;348;This is a fine film that shines with great performances, charming direction from Rob Reiner, and a thoughtful story from the novella The Body by Stephen King.
I:8763;349;He was the James Dean of my generation, and he is greatly missed.
I:8763;350;This film is just a small part of his short legacy, and provides ample proof that he would have been one of the greatest actors ever.
I:8763;351;Talk about recipe for success.
I:8763;352;And solid up and coming young talents like Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix (RIP), Kiefer Sutherland, and Corey Feldman.
I:8763;353;All key ingredients to make watching STAND BY ME an unforgettable viewing experience.
I:8763;354;Accordingly the story weaves, and weaves effortlessly, from lighthearted to poignant to disturbing.
I:8763;355;sTAND BY ME is fun, moving, sad. . . timeless.
I:8763;356;I've seen this film countless times, and will no doubt watch it countless times more.
I:8763;357;I big hit and always CLASSIC.
I:8763;358;this is a good film.
I:8763;359;if you enjoy good films, this is the one for you!
I:8763;360;This movie is a classic.
I:8763;361;I love all the classics being remastered and coming out on blue ray.
I:8763;362;I ordered this along with lonesome Dove.
I:8763;363;really great movie but i wonder why it got three stars.
I:8763;364;it should of got 2 or 2 and a half or something.
I:8763;365;the plot wasnt that good.
I:8763;366;but it had good music and it was kinda funny,too.
I:8763;367;Loved it when I was a kid and my kids love it too!
I:8763;368;Im sure it will be a great story for my grandchildren.
I:8763;369;Brings back memories of the good old days and youth.
I:8763;370;Stand By Me is the big.
I:8763;371;If you have read the The Body you will instantly realize how true to the book this movie really is.
I:8763;372;right down to every word in the dialog.
I:8763;373;while Wil Wheaton is obviously the main character in the movie, River Phoenix is the true star, delivering a superb performance as the peacemaker in tough kid's clothes.
I:8763;374;(I still laugh when I hear I cherish these moments as delivered by Feldman.)
I:8763;375;The movie itself is a fantastic tale, a book that was wonderfully transported to the big screen.
I:8763;376;I highly recommend the movie.
I:8763;377;Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely terrifying as Ace.
I:8763;378;dark atmosphere that it gives it a great flavor.
I:8763;379;You just know they're going to meet him at the end the whole time, and that creates great suspense.
I:8763;380;Wil Wheaton pushes a line or two but does OK, he has a tough role.
I:8763;381;the best part of the movie is that it is so true to life.
I:8763;382;the lighting is really good: most of the film is shot outdoors and if it's augmented by stage lighting they did a good job, it looks like natural sunlight most of the time.
I:8763;383;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:8763;384;I'm an 80's kid and I love this movie.
I:8763;385;My favorite part was the leeches and the story telling by the camp fire.
I:8763;386;With a genuine feel, the story rings true.
I:8763;387;Classic, timeless, and will look great in your collection.
I:8763;388;I first saw this movie when I was 10 years old and can honestly say, 8 years later, it still holds a special place in my heart.
I:8763;389;Unlike many movies that are made these days, Stand By Me has exceptional acting and a simple story, set to a beautiful period in time(the 50's).
I:8763;390;I recommend this movie to any and every one.
I:8763;391;And to those that have seen it, watch it again!
I:8763;392;The moral of this story is don't judge a book by its cover, which is best exemplified by the secondary character Chris Chambers (played by River Phoenix).
I:8763;393;the other misfits have a complexity to them as well.
I:8763;394;This story takes you back to the rules of childhood where cursing means you're cool, making fun of your friend's mother makes you even cooler, pinky swearing turns a promise into law, and skinning it turns an argument into a truce.
I:8763;395;It seemed unlikely for these boys to one minute wonder which superhero would win in a fight and then the next minute, engage in deep philosophical discussions.
I:8763;396;The acting in this movie is superb, especially from River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton who show an unexpected maturity for their young ages.
I:8763;397;The ending was good as well .
I:8763;398;I have loved this movie for a long time and while searching for movies to give as gifts I came across this one.
I:8763;399;It was a great price and went well in a gift basket for an anniversary.
I:8763;400;Have you ever seen a movie that truly touched your life?
I:8763;401;If not I greatly recommend that you see Stand By Me.
I:8763;402;I love this movie because it is touching, sad, funny, and altogether just a great movie.
I:8763;403;and also, It is a great date movie(I would whatch it with any guy).
I:8763;404;I think this movie is good for all ages.
I:8763;405;The whitty remarks and message is interesting to younge teens, yet I think grown.
I:8763;406;All these reasons are why I recommend this movie, claim it as my favorite movie, and give this movie 5 stars.
I:8763;407;Even through the 80's you still felt like you were in the 50's, a bit.
I:8763;408;Stand by me is a very good movie with a young cast.
I:8763;409;My family and I love to watch it.
I:8763;410;Stephen King has turned a lot of his books into his movies, a lot of them actually good.
I:8763;411;One of my all time favorite Stephen King films is """"Stand By Me""""."""
412;This movie really moved me that most films have never had.
413;The late River Phoenix gave his best performance in this timeless classic.
414;The funniest moment in the film is when Gordies tells the guys a story about some fat guy who enters a pie.
415;That was a laugh riot.
416;Stand By Me remains a personal favorite movie of mine to this very day.
417;So, on the box of the VHS, it was written : The best coming.
418;and when I watched it, I immediately felt in love with this beautiful movie.
419;I will watch this movie again and again and again.
420;it makes me cry each times that I see it.
421;Better than Star Trek the Next Generation.
422;The powerful theme is the development of friendship during our formative years, those friendships that help form and shape our character.
423;but as we live the adventure with the main characters, we find that this movie is about the friendship of these boys, as they help one another grow and confront their personal daemons.
424;During the movie, we have the rare opportunity to see very young versions of great actors of today, namely.
425;A great classic to enjoy with your kids, especially boys.
426;This movie is a complete marvel in capturing the true way youths are when together without supervision.
427;The part when the 4 friends are laying around the fire discussing trivial things is accurate with that nostalgia that all people have when remembering their childhood.
428;A excellent movie and highly recommended.
429;Oh and moms, do understand that your boys talk like that when their together.
430;the thing is Jon cusack's character is very sweet, the kind of brother that would belookig over his little brother.
431;this movie is one of my favorites definitely.
432;gordie is the quiet one the writer.
433;vern is the fat kid who is funny and A bit dim.
434;One of the greatest movies of all time, I still watch it occasionally.
435;This film is one of my all time favorites.
436;The cast is absolutely perfect.
437;Wil Wheaton was the best crying kid of all time .
438;River Phoenix was excellent in this film, which is an adaptation of a Stephen King short story.
439;Part road film, part coming of age tale, all the elements are here to tug at your heart strings.
440;Stand by me is one of my favorites movies.
441;It is really a good movie.
442;This movie shows us maybe the best how gifted he was.
443;But Stand By Me is really better.
444;A really lovely movie with great actors and an ending which makes you cry, without typical Hollywood.
445;Therefore my kids could see it!
446;This movie has a universal appeal to kids and grown.
447;"this movie is at once hilarious and heartbreaking and I'll bet Steven King is thrilled that this director (and actors, and everyone else involved in this production)actually ""got it""."
448;"This movie is a masterpiece and, if I could just find a copy somehow without the ""swears:, I would love my [.]"
449;So, if you haven't seen it, treat yourself to this movie.
450;I would recommend this movie to everyone I come into contact with.
451;The actors were all excellent and the props and scenery were outstanding.
452;This is one of the greatest movies of all times.
453;This is probably one of the greatest movies of all time, not because of its plot or characters.
454;it's because of the perfect balance of the element of reality, the portrayal of the adolescent mind, and the little experiences the characters go through that allow for a very deep and personal connection to exist between the viewer and the screen.
455;An immediate consequence of this is that you, now an adult, are able to achieve an amazing persepctive of your own childhood.you become enlightened.you place yourself in the shoes of these four kids and sit in amazement of the innocence of early life.
456;This is why it is such an amazing movie!!
457;best movie there is its my personal favorite and i beleive that everyopne should watch it and im just a huge fan so i got the delux version
458;This is an engaging story about a childhood adventure for a bunch of friends.
459;If you ever had great group of friends as a child and miss them, you will appreciate this movie.
460;In the process they discover things about themselves, and each other.
461;This movie also has some very god acting(regrdless of the age of the participent).
462;scifi fans might recognize several of the child actors Will Weaston and Jerry O' Conell.
463;so all I can say is.
464;I just finished viewing this film for the first time and thought that I had to comment on it.
465;This movie is incredible, words cannot possibly describe the effect this film will have on you.
466;It's funny, sad, uplifting, nostalgic, wonderful, and absolutely stunning.
467;It will have you in tears at some parts, and have you on the floor laughing at others.
468;the ensemble cast is incredible.
469;River Phoenix gives one of his most dramatic performance ever, Wil Wheaton is fantastic as the lovable Gordie, Jerry O'Connel gives us much needed humor, and Cory Feldman shows his true colors as Teddy DuChamp.
470;I was more than pleasantly surprised by the pure perfection this film delivers.
471;A great cast of young stars.
472;I love this movie because it reminds me of my sons at this age.
473;stand by Me is a drama about 4 friends,one of the boys overhears his brother talking about stealing a car,and a kid getting hit by a train because of it,so the 4 friends go on an adventure to find the body.
474;this is a great movie adventure/drama about friendship and life.
475;stand by Me is a good movie for the whole family,just rated R for some course language.
476;For a movie that is nearly twenty years old, it's hard to find a decent story these days that deals with the nostalgia of growing up.
477;"The Story of ""The Body"" by Stephen King and its adaptation to film ""Stand By Me"" is a complete classic."
478;It symbolization of youthful truth with its heartfelt honesty on childhood friendships still renders in the hearts of every viewer.
479;Stand By Me tells the story of four young kids on an unforgetable journey to find the dead body of a young teenage boy named Ray Brauer.
480;one of the many reasons why this movie still resonates with audiences is probably from the direction of Rob Reiner and its magnificent casting.
481;It creates a world that we all remember on a journey we all/will experience.
482;It's one of the many reasons it still brings in new audiences every year.
483;There is an eight song soundtrack that comes with the set, along with the booklet that tells of the making of the story.
484;There is even a 40 minute video in the special feature section that is quite enjoyable.
485;Stand By Me stands as one of Stephen King's finest writings.
486;It's the perfect coming of age story where life is a journey of redemption and self.
487;"off to me
I:8763;488;If you have school age kids, this is a must movie for them especially in the teenage years.
I:8763;489;Teaches the value of true friends.
I:8763;490;My gosh this BR edition is fabulous, it looks beautiful, it really does.
I:8763;491;The special features are nice as well, the documentary about the film with the interviews really puts you into the mindset of how they got the performances and how much this film means to them as well as us, since this is such a nice experience to watch a well.
I:8763;492;crafted, touching film like this.
I:8763;493;But for me the best actor of the four was River Phoenix (RIP) who played the guy from a bad family with a good heart.
I:8763;494;He really shined as this chracter and his acting was truly amazing.
I:8763;495;other actors who starred were: Kiefer Sutherland, very good as the town bully.
I:8763;496;John Cusack, who had a couple of cameos as Gordie's deceased borther, and Richard Dreyfuss as the writer/ elder Gordie, he mostly narrated but his voice fit the movie perfectly.
I:8763;497;the direction of the movie by Rob Reiner was amazing, he had many scenes only done in one take, and this adds to the beauty of the movie.
I:8763;498;Also with a montage tribute to River Phoenix.
I:8763;499;It is a wonderful film, that deserves every bit of praise it gets.
I:8763;500;Wow I read the 1 star reviews and all it consists of is ppl crying coz the kids swear in it.
I:8763;501;Anyways the movies a must see.
I:8763;502;I've seen it countless times and each time is a treat.
I:8763;503;This is truly a great movie and I would recommend this to anyone who collects movies to add it to their collection.
I:8763;504;This movie has always been one of my favorites.
I:8763;505;Growing up I loved it, and I still love it now.
I:8763;506;Personally, Stand By Me is in my top 10 movies and stories.
I:8763;507;Will Wheaton for Gordie, acted the sensitive kid to a tee.
I:8763;508;Its a must have specially if you have kids, since in my experience is a childhood memory!
I:8763;509;Stephen King got it right when (paraphrasing here) in the last line of narrative the adult character states: .
I:8763;510;The movie touches the heart while reminding us of childhood.
I:8763;511;The film captures a life altering experience of four boys who, in seeking to find the missing body of another boy killed in an accident involving a train, learn many things about each others character and personality.
I:8763;512;The dialogue is humorous and affecting as it evokes the remembrance of what it was like to be a boy growing up.
I:8763;513;some language may be offensive to some people, but it is realistic.
I:8763;514;If you can get past this, then I believe it is a film that the entire family can enjoy.
I:8763;515;It's so timeless and affecting.
I:8763;516;This is just the most marvelous movie ever.
I:8763;517;it really makes you think about the priorities in life.
I:8763;518;It's spectacular: a total MUST.
I:8763;519;A smart, sensitive, versatile, fifties set tale which is partly based on the Steven King story, The Body.
I:8763;520;These superb actors merley compliment the rich dialogue which is astounding throughout resulting in a grittily realistic undertone.
I:8763;521;Rob Reiners debut feature as a director is a classic one at that and merley kick started his career.
I:8763;522;This film remains something of a total masterpiece.
I:8763;523;This movie is absolutely engrossing.
I:8763;524;depth look at the friendships among these boys and how they view life.
I:8763;525;It is a sensitive, uplifting story with a great soundtrack.
I:8763;526;You really should see this film!
I:8763;527;The wonderful film, Stand By Me, added so many more nuances to the Stephen King novella on which it was based.
I:8763;528;When I first saw it as a child, I loved it, even though there were moments that genuinely frightened me.
I:8763;529;ray now is a whole new experience .
I:8763;530;the dynamics of the relationships between the four boys, moments of sadness, moments of hope, and yes, still some moments of fear.
I:8763;531;Fortunately, we have this lovely film to give us an idea of what could have been.
I:8763;532;Stand by Me, was the second film, directed by Rob Reiner, son of Carl Reiner, known best for his television work in the US and for launching the career of one Steve Martin.
I:8763;533;He made subsquent trimmings on the novel, so that the most important things for example, outlying the real friendship between Chris and Gordie being dominant, the way they communicate and approach their troubles in white.
I:8763;534;a good tip, i will offer is, it is better to read the short story, The Body upon what the material is based on.
I:8763;535;You will really enjoy it more, honest, i have.
I:8763;536;this is effectively a character driven piece, with a great stunt piece, the runaway train sequence, the confronations between the friends, trying to abine and then drift apart as friends do, when they feel they have nothing left to prove and the jokes shared and the mere messing around.
I:8763;537;this is Phoenix's shining performance, that makes this one.
I:8763;538;This is a very faithful adaptation of a King story, and much of the dialogue came straight from the book.
I:8763;539;what makes this film really great is the interaction, chemistry and performances of the four young actors.
I:8763;540;bound writer/dreamer, played by Wil Wheaton (who went on to become Wesley Crusher in Star Trek: TNG) with some great facial expressions and moments of vulnerable emotion and inner strength.
I:8763;541;Chris Chambers is the rebellious bad boy, but smart and athletic, played by a very young River Phoenix (whose promising career was tragically cut short) with strength and wisdom beyond his years.
I:8763;542;the film is very nostalgic, with its portrayal of small town life in the 1950s, treehouses, corner drug stores, and woods for exploring.
I:8763;543;Interspersed with these sequences are moments of reflection and kids being kids, with weighty topics discussed like """"superman vs. mighty mouse"""" and the importance of cherry flavored pez."""
544;"There are two key sequences involving Gordy and Chris and Ace, and to a lesser extent, Chris' older brother ""Eyeball"" Chambers."
545;"funny and poignant, this is a great film about the brotherhood of boys, and was even referenced by Michael Gurian in his book ""The Wonder of Boys"" as a recommended film to watch with your young son to view positive examples of young male relationships."
546;Some of the best story telling about growing up as a young child, while trying to fit in.
547;It was a really really good movie.
548;It was one of my favorite movies.
549;Stand By Me is a great movie with solid performances all around including several future stars like Kiefer Sutherland and River Phoenix, in one of his final roles.
550;"It is truly a excellent adaptation of Stephen King's ""The Body""."
551;A fun movie which would have been 4 stars with a decent audio transfer.
552;Stand By Me is my favorite movie of all time.
553;"Stand By Me is based on the Stephen King Novella, ""The Body,"" where a group of 4 boys venture out to find the remains of a dead kid named Ray Brower."
554;This film explores the friendships that kids have at the age of 12.13, and the transition they make from innocence to loss of innocence.
555;The best way I can describe this movie is haunting.
556;Although one of my absolute favorite films of all time, I can only watch it occasionally as it stirs up many emotions about my childhood.
557;this film also has incredible scenery of Oregon, an awesome soundtrack, and contains some of the most talented young actors.
558;River Phoenix is an incredible actor, and I think it's his best performance.
559;Rob Reiner gave the world a great gift in 1986, in celluloid, a little film that shook the world called Stand By Me .
560;Sixteen years later, the single thought that comes to mind in watching this movie is how absolutely timeless this movie is.
561;Which is surprising, considering how important the late 1950's is crucial to the movie.
562;the plot, a journey of four boyhood friends in search of their mortality, is simple and profoundly inspiring.
563;important impact they had on our formative years.
564;This movie celebrates what we once were, and brings us back, if only momentarily, to the time when life wasn't about mortgages or cars breaking down, but spending time with our friends, quite possibly, the people we adored more than our own family.
565;A documentary shares many insights into making the film, and interviews the remaining boys ,with a touching tribute to the late River Phoenix, who's performance was critical to this movie.
566;The music video was fun to see.
567;I wanted to hear more, hear everything.
568;And thanks to Mr. Reiner for this gift.
569;it is funny, sad, great!
570;watching all four of them will convince you that they're truly are friends in real life.
571;sure there's a lot of swear words but a movies this good,who cares?
572;I thought that this was a great moving about children coming of age and learning about the difficulties of adult life.
573;It has some deep and meaningful themes and to truly understand the film you would need to watch it more than once.
574;But it still is a great movie if you want some cheap laughs.
575;All the characters are excellently portrayed which makes all the events believable.
576;The film very easy to watch and you aren't forced to cringe at the attempts of humour committed by the cast.
577;The camera angles and screen play help to accentuate the authentic feel of this extremely well made movie.
578;I'm 29 now, and it is still my all.
579;Vern is kind of the social outcast.
580;This movie is very realistic.
581;I recently viewed this with my 10yr old son, and loved it even more than the first time.
582;One of the best coming of age movies of all time .
583;River Phoenix is absolutely brilliant!
584;What a loss of such a huge talent.
585;It has held up wonderfully.
586;It is a great story that is well acted and the characters are really endearing.
587;Still a classic and hoping that my daughter loves it as much as I did.
588;I bought this version of Stand By Me when it came out because it's one of my favorite movies and mainly also because it was advertied to be in Dolby 5.1 stereo.
589;Is the deluxe edition worth it?
590;, maybe if you are a die hard buff of the movie but if you are just a collector of movies and want this timeless treasure in your collection, I'd recommend the special edition which you can pick up for half the price.
591;One of the greatest movies of all time.
592;I have always enjoyed this movie from childhood until adulthood.
593;Awesome classic coming of age movie.
594;My 8 yr old loved it too .
595;This is one of the greatest movies of all time.
596;It has action, comedy, drama , and a little bit of suspense.
597;The story is written by the very talented Stephen King.
598;While on their journey they encounter a junkyard dog, an exciting train chase, and the discovery of friendship.
599;It's a classic that has held up over time!
600;Well I realy enjoyed this movie it is one of my favorites.
601;It's about these 4 boys who go on a trip to discover a dead boys body on the way they learn more about each and them selves.
602;Personaly I would have to say that I loved it, it was great.
603;Stand By Me is the greatest movie ever.
604;It's really funny and really sad.
605;this movie was the greatest movie in the world.
606;its really funny and really sad.
607;i loved it soo much.
608;com, becuz they dont sell it anywhere else.
609;Stand By Me is one of the best movies from the eighties and probably the very best coming of age movie in the entire history of cinema.
610;alone, and riveting performance as Chris Chambers.
611;This is a wonderful, highly dramatic film that your entire family will treasure for years to come.
612;Stand By Me is directed by Archie's favorite meathead, Emmy.
613;Stand by me is my new favorite movie because it has a great cast, it teaches you lessons of life and it has great depictions of friendship.
614;I love this movie so much.
615;the acting, which I still shutter from, is amazing.
616;I bought this movie for my hubby for Father's Day this year because he loved it as a kid.
617;He has now seen it with our 2 boys who are 3 and 5 a couple times.
618;The boys like it because your in search of a dead bod, but as they get older they will get the whole growing up part of it as well.
619;The plot is great, the acting is wonderful and River Phoenix is the best.
620;I wanted it for my collection of classic, timeless stories.
621;I would recommend that everyone watch it.
622;This is a wonderful movie.
623;It brought back many memories of my youth.
624;You flinched, so you get punched in the arm twice,and many more things of that era when I was a youth.
625;I also saw alot of bravery between the two main characters.
626;This movie is very interesting for me.
627;Because four young boys showed their friendship and morality with undergoing all sorts of hardship.
628;Second reason, everyone's character is funny especially Teddy like a psycho.
629;And each character made harmony altogether in this story.
630;First of all, each boy's character is good, nice, and innocent.
631;They were very young but they kept friendship and morality.
632;Besides they helped each other for their friends.
633;"This is a classic, I think anybody who watches this movie will fall in love with it
I:8763;634;This shows you how sensitive these four kids are.
I:8763;635;Strong performances from the young quartet of actors, especially the late Phoenix, lifted this nostalgic tale above the fray and made it a sleeper hit in 1986.
I:8763;636;hood is insightful, honest, and memorable.
I:8763;637;This is a classic that deserves a place in the all.
I:8763;638;ray just makes it better.
I:8763;639;Best movie about childhood hands down.
I:8763;640;Loved watching this with my older brother growing up.
I:8763;641;Do you remember back to the last years of childhood, when adulthood was just around the corner and so yearned for yet the simple joys of childhood still at hand?
I:8763;642;Based on Stephen King's story """"The Body,"""" Stand By Me masterfully captures the essence of that critical period in life."""
643;set in the 1950's, this film will not only resonate with baby boomers nostalgic for their own childhood but also with nearly anyone who can remember that turning point in their own lives.
644;Wil Wheaton delivers a wonderful performance as a sensitive would.
645;"killed football star brother's image
I:8763;646;time favorites and certainly one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story (on par with The Shawshank Redemption).
I:8763;647;The video presentation is true to the film's original aspect ratio (1.85:1), and is anamorphically enhanced for those with widescreen displays.
I:8763;648;In every other respect the video is well done, with excellent background detail which effectively captures the beauty of the film's outdoor environments.
I:8763;649;A remix of the audio to allow for the use of the surrounds for some outdoor ambiance would not have been totally unwelcome, but what you get is true to the film's audio roots, and gets the job done.
I:8763;650;the """"special features"""" are excellent."""
651;There is a documentary about the making of the film that features interviews with Stephen King, Reiner, and most of the film's major cast members.
652;It is a wonderful look at the production of the film, and one can't help but feel newfound respect for the job Reiner did in putting this film together.
653;Reiner's commentary is good as well .
654;If you are a fan of Stand By Me, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.
655;Stand by Me IS the ultimate Coming of Age movie, and a movie that every young boy around the age of 12 or 13 should see.
656;Stand by Me is funny, heartwarming, sad, and really makes you feel for the kids.
657;The performances given by Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Jerry O' Connell, and Cory Feldman are amazing and relatable.
658;This movie stands as one of my true favorites, and never grows old with age!
659;i absolutely love this movie.
660;watching this film is like going through a fun and exciting experience.
661;chris,Gordie,Teddy and Vern are the best part of the whole movie.
662;four friends who practically love eachother inspite of their differences.
663;it often reminds me of some of the best times I had had as a kid.
664;i highly recommend this movie!
665;This Amazing Movie just get better when you remember that are based on one of the most incredible Stephen King Novel called the corpse.
666;I thought it was a worthwhile film having seen it as a kid and it stills holds up years later.
667;my husband likes to quote from Movies and this is one of them.
668;we both remember it from our childhoods and wanted to share it with our kids.
669;i highly recommend it for anyone that wants to teach thier kids about friendship.
670;it was beautifully done and all the scenes were espectacular.
671;i think they made a very good job,not just the actors but all the people who participated in the creation of this master piece.
672;it was just so touching and controversial.5 stars to this master piece,probably the best in its kind.
673;it really has an good message and I really undersatand it just like all of you did.
674;River Phoenix did an awesome job.
675;A great story of youth, being a boy, bonding, losing your sense of innocence, everything is right there.
676;A great film adaptation of King's short story, which is rare.
677;Lousy adaptations of great stories.
678;Probably because of Reiner's superb direction.
679;A wonderful story of childhood friends!
680;Of course love the music, and the director's comments were worth getting the Special Edition.
681;The extras available on the disk are worthwhile.
682;When Harry Met Sally is my absolute favorite movie!
683;He really knows how to capture people and life.
684;have loved this movie from the first time I saw it and just recently shared it with a friend of the same age as the little boys were in that same year.
685;It was fun to watch with him because he knew all of the nuances that those boys were doing so I can take it from that, it was very accurate and representative of that time.
686;Have always loved this movie and was excited when my granddaughter requested this moviefor a Christmas gift.
687;Bought it for her and now I know I can always borrow it from her.
688;Stand By Me is one of the best coming of age movies.
689;It really touches your heart.
690;In the scene where Chris (River Phoenix) cries, you know that he is a boy who has a bad reputation because of his brothers, but deep down he is a very sensitive and loving kid.
691;It is also a movie with an adventure to it.
692;Normally when you think about a movie about boys, it has an adventure involved.
693;Stand By Me is great and once you see the movie, the book is also great to read.
694;What more would you want from a classic that opens Today's Kids eyes into when Kids were just Kids.
695;A classic coming of age movie.
696;A perfect movie for boys who love to explore.
697;One of my all time favorite movies growing up because I could relate to exploring the railways.
698;Stand by Me can still stand on it's own 20 years later!
699;This movie is one of my best movies.
700;They shows us wonderful friendship!
701;They were relly good actors!
702;He should have been a great actor if he was still alive.
703;Anyway, I always like the stories written by Stephen King.
704;I loved this movie and even though I am a senior, it is a story that will be loved by all, especially youngboys.
705;Acting is great by all, so true to life.
706;It is, has been, and will always be my favorite.
707;It posesses the perfect balances of humour and tears.
708;It may be about children, but I certainly don't think that they were the intended audience.
709;River Phoenix does a phonomenal job in this film and it is a must see!!
710;It came the next day like I ordered it.
711;Everything was in perfect condition.
712;great for teens and up!
713;great story, told thru the eyes of a young teen.
714;touches your heart and soul.
715;This film showed audiences who had never read Stephen King, what the rest of us already knew: the man can write!
716;the film revolves around four amazing characters, played by four amazing young actors.
717;Kids really do speak this way, primarily because such language DOES shock some adults to such an extent.
718;"one thing that needs mentioning, beyond the fact that this film is so amazing
I:8763;719;His performance is, while understated and brief, equally amazing.
I:8763;720;I've loved this mover since it first came out and the song was the first dance we had as a married couple.
I:8763;721;I can watch this movie over and over.
I:8763;722;Being 12 years old, I cant compare friendship as an adult to who I am now but I know true inspirational friendship when I see it.
I:8763;723;Stand By Me is a classic Stephen King film of 4 boys who set off on a journey to discover and explore there curiosity along a 20 mile stretch of train tracks that run through their town.
I:8763;724;Throughout their travels, they learn more about each other and grow closer as life long friends who are living up the pristine greatness of being kids.
I:8763;725;This movie is worth watching.
I:8763;726;Thanks to this movie, Iv learned a great insight on living life to the fullest and always sticking with the people you care about.
I:8763;727;I dont mind watching this movie every once in a while because it is so good!
I:8763;728;Working with a cast of teen and preteen can not be the easiest thing to do and all indications are that he pulled it off with ease through incredible casting of child actors.
I:8763;729;Chris is played by River Phoenix and the acting job by River is unquestionably Oscar.
I:8763;730;Few child performances are nearly as perfectly done as River's (others that come to mind are Mac Culkin in Home Alone and Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense), but I believe his stands above even those.
I:8763;731;Keifer Sutherland plays the antagonist very well.
I:8763;732;The younger gang of Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern is well written due to their many differences and the writer/director's (Stephen King/Rob Reiner) willingness to display a full range of emotions in all of them.
I:8763;733;stand by Me is one of my two favorite movies of all time and is a definite must see.
I:8763;734;Rob Reiner (the director) has done a beautiful job of capturing many things: an amazing era, adventure, serious.
I:8763;735;It is definitely a cult classic of the 1980's, and I highly suggest everyone watch it.
I:8763;736;All of the young actors come across so pure and wonderful .
I:8763;737;one of my all time favorite movies.
I:8763;738;Dear reader, stand by me is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time.
I:8763;739;River Phoenix is wonderful in this movie.
I:8763;740;He can just go in there and do his thing.
I:8763;741;Rod Riner did a great job at all the sceens.
I:8763;742;This movie has excitement, adventure, you'll laugh you'll cry this movie is so wonderful.
I:8763;743;I liked Stand By Me because it reminds me of my friends.
I:8763;744;stand By Me is my favorite movie.
I:8763;745;I thought that this would be a great movie to watch with our 12 year old, since it is based on that age of kid, and I remember the story fondly.
I:8763;746;After shutting it off and watching something else with the kids, mommy and I watched it and enjoyed it tremendously.
I:8763;747;I do remember the short story, or novelette titled """"The Body"""" (Stephen King) being slightly better than the movie, but this is a classic."""
748;Great movie, just watch it and you will see why.
749;If you weren't one of those perfect kids in school or had a great home life then you will really understand the relationship of the kids in this movie.
750;This is an awesome movie and deserves 10 stars, however I wanted to try out a movie on my Kindle and it just didn't have great resolution.
751;Stand By Me is a classic and true Stephen King book, and one of those movie adaptations that I find highly succesfull unlike many others.
752;The atmosphere, the city and surroundings are captured nicely, and you're litterally devoured by our 4 young heroes off on their life's adventure.
753;Truly this movie gives you a great feeling, and also leaves material for thought on many things.
754;a remarkable movie, brings back childhood!
755;I loved this movie, for many reason's!
756;There is so much I could let you know about.
757;This movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices.
758;he hit the time, the place and the kids perfectly.
759;this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share, i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me.
760;this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world.
761;i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday.
762;its a great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone.
763;plus great script/dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell.
764;Its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950's over this era.
765;It is an excellent movie.
766;I've always liked this movie and was very happy to get it on Blu Ray.
767;This is the kind of movie that you can watch with your family and everyone will enjoy it.
768;I found this to be a great movie, a tale of coming of age, and enjoying an adventure with your friends.
769;I recomend this movie highly for everyone and there family!
770;Stand By Me is one of my favorite films.
771;I have seen it so many times I know every line.
772;And yet every time I watch it I still enjoy it.
773;Perhaps it reminds me of a time when life was more simple.
774;The film is about boys, boys at that age when they are discovering the world, and discovering the world with their friends.
775;Maybe it's the innocence of Stand By Me I love, maybe it's the fact they swear a lot, or maybe it's the adventure, maybe it's that they all cry, or maybe it's that Vern can't remember the secret knock, whatever it is, it's masterful.
776;the story is beautifully simple.
777;perhaps I'm not really doing the plot justice by oversimplifying like that, but trust me, this is a great film.
778;It may be the best film made about boys at this age.
779;To me it is the best.
780;When I watch this film I don't see performances, I see people.
781;In fact, even today when I see Jerry O'Connell in films I yell Vern.
782;Richard Dreyfuss, despite few scenes, delivers a strong, subtle performance.
783;rob Reiner is one of the best dierctors of the 80's.
784;I think Stand By Me is his best work.
785;The performances he was able to elicit out of his young cast is phenomenal.
786;This is what a true director can do.
787;The scenic backdrop of Oregon also gives the picture a sort of harmony with nature that captures the tone perfectly.
788;stand By Me is a personal film.
789;Reiner and King have combined their boyhood expieriences to create a true vision of young men on the brink of manhood.
790;One classic scene after the next, it is one of my favorite pictures.
791;Very good movie about childhood friendship.
792;This movie was a family favorite lost many years ago and greatly enjoyed once this new copy arrived.
793;Great movie adaptation of Stephen King's short story of four boy's coming of age.
794;"Surely it's a classic by now
I:8763;795;Probably one of the best shows for young teens to watch about friendship and the mischief of the 50.60's.
I:8763;796;A great story of friendship and growing up,I love howthe story is integrated with the present.
I:8763;797;ground rock and roll music, like the movie American Grafitti.
I:8763;798;It is an exquisitely nostalgic and realistic story of four boys on the brink of puberty, barking on a quest to be heroes.
I:8763;799;In a way, it is a modern day Tom Sawyer adventure.
I:8763;800;Gordie, (Wil Wheaton), is the intelligent, creative one with the obviously bright future.
I:8763;801;His best buddy, Chris (River Phoenix), is the tough friend in order to hide the pain from the physical abuse he endures at home.
I:8763;802;He knows he is good inside, but deals with the hurt by the hard shell of rough talk and actions.
I:8763;803;along, and Teddy (Corey Feldman), a loyal, funny but troubled kid with a death wish.
I:8763;804;It reveals the simple life of children who know that soon there is a future that could tear them apart.
I:8763;805;the """"greaser"""" gang of older boy teenagers also want to find the body ."""
806;this adds to the competition and the pace of the movie.
807;They want to find the body first and are surprised by Gordie's strong will and determination to have justice.
808;Stand by ME is a must see movie, no matter what your age.
809;It hits all the important points of understanding your need for friendship in tough times.
810;The movie is based on a novel by Stephen King and narrated by Richard Dreyfus (who plays the adult Gordon Lachance), who gives the right amount of humor to the film.
811;this was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
812;i laughed out loud and the classic silliness and very poignant rites ofpassage.
813;This is a great movie.
814;It is about a simpler time of life.
815;I know that I will watch it many times.
816;if you have ever had a friend and you and that friend did something crazy you should check this movie out.
817;i recommend this good movie to 99% of you.
818;I remember how the incredible acting had touched me, especially since I hope to grow up and work in that area.
819;The beautifully portrayed story was brilliantly done, and althought it's not even close to the novella, 'The Body' by Stephen King, it is just like it in many ways.
820;The most important things are the hardest things to say .
821;stand By Me is one of the greatest movies of all time, dealing with that magical time between childhood and adulthood.
822;It's the detail that's the killer.
823;Bags of those little details from your past you thought you'd forgotten, come alive again in this atmospheric movie.
824;You just gotta see this one.
825;my first region 1 and what a difference.
826;crisp as a box of Cheerios.
827;The colors are vibrant and extremely realistic.
828;The whole thing just comes alive on your TV screen.
829;have' for cinema lovers everywhere.
830;Stand by Me is one of the best Stephen King movies ever made.
831;It features a cast of teenagers who go on an adventure and must deal with the hardships of growing up.
832;Great cast, music, story and performances that still hold up today.
833;picture commentary retrospective which is terrific.
834;This just about as close to my growing up as it can be.
835;an adventure for the boy's.
836;This film was recommended to me 5 years ago and I had fully intended watching it, but never got round to it.
837;It had all the wondrous writing of Stephen King, a non.
838;cheesy, uplifting plot and sensational characters who were really engaging.
839;This also means that he has the only part that has a happy ending (not to plot spoil), which is a little indulgent.
840;This film saves 'Stand by Me' (the song) for the titles at the end, and so quadruples its power (and makes you remember it for days after!)
841;Watch it, and find satisfaction at the end of longing.
842;What they find is maturity, friendship, and life.
843;Any man who grew up in a rural area will relate to this.
844;I highly recommend both of these movies to everyone.
845;Best and most favorite movie of all time, hands down.
846;able for those from defunct homes.
847;I feel that was a huge bond for Chris and Gordy.
848;I feel Chris and Gordy really mirrored each other with their home life and connected on a deeper level separate from the other boys, and you see that deep connection in the woods when Chris cries, and then again at the end where Gordy is the one crying and Chris is the one comforting him.
849;They have so many intimate moments where their bond shines, and they really did have a friendship beyond the realm of the group.
850;Several scenes there are moments where they don't even have to say anything, they just look at each other with a knowing, and we all have a friend we've been able to do that with.
851;That is something so intimate and powerful to have translate onto film.
852;There is a real deep and trusting love amongst brothers there.
853;Then there was Vern who got poked at and made fun of, just for being himself.
854;Gordy and Chris ghosts of their brothers, Teddy of his father and Vern of himself.
855;"in the end, they all just wanted to be something, known for something great
I:8763;856;Their true family, was each other.
I:8763;857;This has always been one of my favorite movies based on Stephen King's The Body .
I:8763;858;Touching in so many ways!
I:8763;859;I loved this movie, not to mention the book (The Body, by Stephen King).
I:8763;860;It is so funny, with cussing, and typical 12 year old boy stuff, and it is also serious at some times.
I:8763;861;It brings suspense at the end and guaranteed to keep you in all the way through.
I:8763;862;It is exactly how we act, so it was fun to watch and read.
I:8763;863;it will definately become a classic later on.
I:8763;864;It is very funny and intense, and just great.
I:8763;865;i Loved it and hope you do to.
I:8763;866;Enjoyable because it is a classic and is a pleasure to watch.
I:8763;867;Will watch it many times.
I:8763;868;the wonderful singer who died in 1996 from cancer.
I:8763;869;eva and I LOVED this movie, and us watching it together in the theater is a wonderful memory I will have forever.
I:8763;870;this movie delves deeply into the hearts, minds, and souls of these youngsters.
I:8763;871;It is at times funny, and then heart.
I:8763;872;breaking, and most people who watch this movie will recall their own childhoods.
I:8763;873;This is one that I hope becomes a classic, These boys are so typical of any town USA in the fiftys and sixtys and reminds me of the kids I grew up with.
I:8763;874;this movie is great to watch like this and fun to watch to and is enjoyalde and learn about what happed back to then
I:8763;875;It has a good mix of drama and comedy.
I:8763;876;The film is set in a small town in the 50's, so there's the nostalgia factor.
I:8763;877;First and foremost, the language.
I:8763;878;I'll grant you it was realistic.
I:8763;879;i know lots of people who grew up watching this film and absolutely love it.
I:8763;880;As I said, I can see it why.
I:8763;881;Yes, Stand By Me is a very good movie.
I:8763;882;But this is still a great movie.
I:8763;883;wielding hoods of the town begin to follow the boys.
I:8763;884;This movie is very funny (I can't stop laughing after the pie.
I:8763;885;eating contest, even if it was a little ribald), but it's also a touching story about friendship, too.
I:8763;886;All in all, this is a wonderful movie.
I:8763;887;This is why I rated it 4 stars.
I:8763;888;I highly recommend it for fathers and no.
I:8763;889;I suggest this fun classic for anyone's collection.
I:8763;890;It bring back memories of anyones innocent childhood.
I:8763;891;Great viewing with a bowl of popcorn!
I:8763;892;I thought it brilliantly done, with supurb acting and direction.
I:8763;893;This trip leads to a test of loyalty between the boys, and acts as a sort of 'coming of age'.
I:8763;894;This is one of the few none supernatural stories by Stephen King, who is a good writer in any genre.
I:8763;895;The film versio is very true to the original, which shows that it can be done.
I:8763;896;in a way there are two main characters,Gordon, the narrator, and Chris, who combines being a rebel with unususal wisdom for his age.
I:8763;897;He knows already how unfair life is.
I:8763;898;You can almost feel the heat of that summer's day, and the throb of the coming train on that railway bridge.
I:8763;899;this is going to be a family classic for our family!
I:8763;900;Received in good used condition in good time.
I:8763;901;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:8763;902;The actors are exceptional and the story rings so true.
I:8763;903;It came on time and is a terrific movie.
I:8763;904;I also got the Sandlot and my whole family enjoyed it.
I:8763;905;This review is based upon River Phoenix and his unique performance throughout his second (and most favoured) film, Stand By Me.
I:8763;906;After his break through into the show biz world with the t. v. series, seven brides for seven brothers, came his first motion picture, Joe Dantes family adventure,Explorors.
I:8763;907;It was this film that introduced him into the everlasting world of films.
I:8763;908;After Explorors came, Stand By Me, based upon Stephen Kings best seller of 1982, the body.
I:8763;909;His most precious moment in the film is the camp fire scene where Phoenix confesses his deepest sorrows and regrets about stealing the milk money at school.
I:8763;910;A lot of things happened on the summer of shooting that film, River smoked his first joint, lost his virginity and adolesence and went on to become one of the truly greatest actors of all time.
I:8763;911;One of the great best friend movies of all time.
I:8763;912;And I've introduced to a whole new generation (my kids) who loved it almost just as much.
I:8763;913;A must see for young men to old
I:8763;914;Having grown up in a similar time as this story is set, and with similar friendships, I can tell you it is amazingly true to life.
I:8763;915;the feeling one gets from watching it is bittersweet, and many people who have watched it spend the rest of the evening thinking back to their own tween years and that moment when you saw your life and that of your friends with perfect clarity.
I:8763;916;the movie is sweet, funny in places and a good look at growing up in the 50's, but more than anything.
I:8763;917;it'll make you nostalgic and wistful.
I:8763;918;I remember watching this as a teen/young adult and it was my husband's favorite movie, so I bought it for him.
I:8763;919;Just the right blend of mystery and drama.
I:8763;920;Easily one of the best films of the 80s, Stand By Me serves as a generational touchstone emblazoned with unbridled emotion.
I:8763;921;The performances given by the four young leads are remarkable and deserved of praise.
I:8763;922;River Phoenix's role as the charismatic leader of the prepubescent bunch is surprisingly mature and one that you would not expect from someone of his age bracket.
I:8763;923;Jerry O'Connell shines as Vern Tessio, the jolly and gullible fat kid.
I:8763;924;Plus, Feldman and Wheaton glow in their respective roles.
I:8763;925;from the cameras, to the characters and to the action.
I:8763;926;The music video is great as well.
I:8763;927;But I never actually had the chance to see the film completely.
I:8763;928;this film is a testiment to childhood and to youth.
I:8763;929;It will captivate you and bring back all those memories in your life that you cherish.
I:8763;930;I disagree with other reviewers that this is the best adaptation of a Stephen King book .
I:8763;931;The Green Mile is infinitely better.
I:8763;932;River was definitely the best thing, and he surprised me how much older he looked, even though he was supposed to be playing a twelve year old.
I:8763;933;Listen, you have to see this movie.
I:8763;934;In my opinion, it's the best movie ever made!
I:8763;935;This movie deals with one of the most important things in life.
I:8763;936;This movie will make you laugh, but it could very well make you cry.
I:8763;937;This movie is my favorite!
I:8763;938;you'll love it no matter how old u are you can never out grow it!
I:8763;939;all my friends who saw it loved it, it's a great movie all the actors in it did such a fantastic job.
I:8763;940;My cousin and I love the movie Stand by Me .
I:8763;941;Even though this movie is i think 18 years old, it is still so funny.
I:8763;942;20 years from now it will still be the best movie ever.
I:8763;943;This is by far the best movie of all time!
I:8763;944;Quite a cast of misfits who band together on a boyhood adventure and discover the meaning of friendship and the cold facts of life along the way.
I:8763;945;Bittersweet and worth watching more than once.
I:8763;946;King delivers another fantastic story.
I:8763;947;Great movie, takes me back to my childhood.
I:8763;948;Their adventures and trials on the journey are multilayered and can be enjoyed on many levels.
I:8763;949;The dialogue is crisp and funny.
I:8763;950;Well written, well acted, and beautifully told.
I:8763;951;A young Keifer Sutherland is great as a teenage hood.
I:8763;952;I show this movie to my middle school students and they love it.
I:8763;953;I loved this film the first time I've watched it and still do.
I:8763;954;It's a great tale of boys and friendship and coping with loss and growing up.
I:8763;955;This is an AMAZING movie.
I:8763;956;It touches you the way movies of today dont.
I:8763;957;Ive read Steven King's The Body which is the novella from which Stand By Me came from and i love it just as much as the movie.
I:8763;958;The language adds to strength of the movie and power.
I:8763;959;I movie to be watch every year!
I:8763;960;The actors were all great.
I:8763;961;For all those who loved their childhood.
I:8763;962;Great classic movie I can watch time and agian.
I:8763;963;This was a special gift to a friend who loved it as much as I did.
I:8763;964;This movie is most probably one of the best films I have ever seen.
I:8763;965;The acting in it is great it has a very strong cast, when something happens to them you can feel their pain because it is acted so good.
I:8763;966;vast streches of mountains covered in trees takes my breath away.
I:8763;967;This movie is great and I would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humour.
I:8763;968;While some of the acting in this story is at times a little awkward, the story and heart of this modern classic shine through at all times.
I:8763;969;This flick has stood the test of time and is one of Rob Reiner's best films and one of the best Stephen King adaptations.
I:8763;970;poignant observations on things that shape our character while growing up, such as alienation, stereotypes, and friendship give this affecting but funny story a sentimental and familiar flavor that can take anyone back to their youth.
I:8763;971;while perhaps a little sappy at times, the syrup somehow works.
I:8763;972;a fine collection to anyone's library.
I:8763;973;This movie really shows how powerful friendship can be and how the people you meet when you're a kid are nothing like the people you meet when your older.
I:8763;974;all discussing how the film affected them recalling funny moments about the shoot, and a very touching tribute to the very missed River Phoenix, all the actors fondly remember this fine actor and how tragic his death was fortold in the last scene of the film.
I:8763;975;The special Documentry is 35min long and i promise you will love every second of it!!
I:8763;976;big thank you to columbia pictures!!
I:8763;977;It's one I can watch over and over.
I:8763;978;I showed it to my kids and they love it as well.
I:8763;979;One of the best (if not the best) coming of age movies of all time.
I:8763;980;And it has cussing cause it's cool.
I:8763;981;The story was phenomenally captivating.
I:8763;982;from the start you won't want to stop, it is so much fun.
I:8763;983;It is a very serious movie, but at the same time it has a lot of well placed humor.
I:8763;984;All the characters have very distinctive and very likable personalities.
I:8763;985;This movie is a timeless classic.
I:8763;986;I will cherish it forever, and will definitely show this to my children.
I:8763;987;Thank you for great service.
I:8763;988;This is such a great coming of age movie mixed with some eerie stuff too.
I:8763;989;Stephen king always does it right
I:8763;990;This is a classic movie.
I:8763;991;Its got a good story and worth having around to make him happy.
I:8763;992;I read the original story years ago in a Stephen King book.
I:8763;993;I loved the actors who did such a great job of bringing this story to life.
I:8763;994;The scene with the train will have you on your feet!
I:8763;995;Many times in my life I've felt on the verge of an adventure.
I:8763;996;Many times I haven't followed through, but when I have the world has opened up to a new understanding.
I:8763;997;The moving story combined with a beautiful song are a hard combination to top.
I:8763;998;This film boasts a great cast, a great director, and a great coming.
I:8763;999;The best performance by far is a very young River Phoenix as Chris Chambers, the character that the rest of the world thinks is no good.
I:8763;1000;His inner spirit and vulnerability provides a strong center for the group, including Gordie (Wil Wheaton), a would.
I:8763;1001;There are a lot of strong words and situations in this film, so it may not be good for very young viewers, but if you are willing to look past that, you will see a great story about the importance of friendship, and the passing of youth.
I:8763;1002;age story about 4 best friends, all about 12 years old.
I:8763;1003;It would include a hilarious overnight stay in the woods.
I:8763;1004;rob Reiner does a fine job directing all of these young actors, several of which have made some decent movies.
I:8763;1005;It is emotional and yes, sentimental but it works because of the honesty of the scenes.
I:8763;1006;Seen in high definition the film gives some new justice to the Oregon landscape that ranges from distant snow capped mountains to a swamp.
I:8763;1007;I for one will be trading my copy back into my favorite music shop.
I:8763;1008;This is one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen.
I:8763;1009;Very well acted and has cross generational appeal.
I:8763;1010;its an awesome movie to watch especially if you're a kidbut it also can be for older people.
I:8763;1011;i like how it revolves around friendship and the virtues of growing up.
I:8763;1012;i also reccomend reading the book, its a good read.
I:8763;1013;This movie, in lay terms, is powerful.
I:8763;1014;original, sad, happy, insightful, educational and just plain the best.
I:8763;1015;The movie speaks for itself.
I:8763;1016;Aw, Speaking of Teddy I love that little guy!
I:8763;1017;Oh well the rest of the movie was very entertaining!
I:8763;1018;The set up to when the boys find the missing corpse keeps you anticipating it.
I:8763;1019;Complete with a terrific music score which you may recognize from George Lucas's classic """"American Graffiti."""""""
1020;So overall, it's a great movie, so definitely see it, if you have it.
1021;This has always been one of my favorite movies.
1022;And it's true, you never will have friends again quite like the ones you had when you were twelve.
1023;I can now say that I have seen it and love it!
1024;Very good movie,knew about this movie years ago but never seen it, bought for teen age boys and we all liked it.
1025;It's such a beautiful touching story and the plot is so engaging and real.
1026;An honest film about childhood friendships.
1027;Children, used to be friends for all the right reasons.
1028;It is a simple, yet complex film of friendship and values.
1029;One of my all time favorite movies!
1030;My personal favorite Stephan king story.
1031;The characters are relatable and it brings back memories of when I was twelve
1032;"This film, based on the short story ""The Body"" by Stephen King, is based on an episode from King's own life."
1033;the acting is amazing, the story is incredible and he narration is superb.
1034;the inner struggle for Gordie LaChance (Wil Wheaton) to come to terms with his older brother's death in a Jeep accident is very moving.
1035;My son loved it as I did when his age.
1036;A movie that has a lot of actors that would later become famous is good enough for me.
1037;I bought it based on James W. Anderson's review, because I wanted to hear the movie in stereo.
1038;This is one of the classics from the 80s.
1039;My husband and I finally was able to watch it with my daughter.
1040;I've seen it countless times, yet it always impacts me somehow.
1041;It literally leaves me breathless!
1042;Whether it be because my undying love/crush for River Phoenix, or just the simple yet deep meaning behind the plot, it's an all around wonderful movie.
1043;The best, this film is the best I have ever seen.
1044;Stand By Me was the first of three great movies made from Stephen King's collection of four novellas.
1045;It is the only movie ever made from a piece of King's fiction that transcends and is greater than the written original.
1046;It is a great coming of age movie in its own right.
1047;, this movie may not transcend the story, but it certainly delivers the goods in a way that few movies made from King's works have done (The Green Mile springs to mind, but after it, Apt Pupil, and Shawshank, the drop.
1048;This feeling is eerily matched and accentuated while watching a young River Phoenix turn in one of his most powerful performances.
1049;will ever be made into a film.
1050;Its ending may ward off the faint of heart, but anyone who has ever heard the audio recording by Frank Muller could easily see its possibilities as a movie.
1051;i give Stand By Me my heartfelt recommendation.
1052;"As the screen lit, exposing a man sitting in a car on the countryside and a beautifully orchestrated take on B E King's classic hit, ""Stand by Me"", I knew I was in for something good."
1053;As the movie rolled on, I found myself completely involved with the world of our protagonists, and caught up in every vowel spoken and every movement made.
1054;It's very rare that I find a movie so captivating, so entertaining, and so emotional.
1055;The dialogue was easy to follow, the atmosphere was perfectly corresponding with the scenes, and the story was amazing.
1056;Along the way, they face what's been eating away at each of them individually and have an emotional experience that is deeply profound to the characters.
1057;This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.
1058;This movie is a classic.
1059;This is one of my favorite 80's movie.
1060;It's amazing to see how young these actors are in this movie.
1061;Stand by Me is probably one the strongest films about friendship ever made.
1062;It is all about `coming of age', never over sentimental, yet remaining thoroughly heart rendering in its depiction of youths discovering their inner adult self.
1063;written by Steven King, this is one of his `Shawshank Redemptions' stories that contains thrills and drama but no horror.
1064;The dialogue is superb and very memorable.
1065;this is also one of director Rob Reiner's best films.
1066;it is also more proof that Stephen King's dramas make much better films than his horrors.
1067;I am 16 years old and Stand By Me is the best movie I've ever seen.
1068;It is one one of my all time favorites.
1069;This is the best movie of all time.
1070;every one will enjoy this movie.
1071;Its a very good movie.
1072;age story, featuring one of River Phoenix's finest roles, along with Wil Wheaton in HIS defining movie, Corey Feldman and a young, plump Jerry O'Connell.
1073;Also turning in a fine performance is Keifer Sutherland, as usual.
1074;I'll admit that I wasn't expecting much, but it ended of becoming my favorite movie.
1075;Something about it is so inspirational and almost makes you want to be closer to your friends.
1076;fi but he liked it.
1077;I'm definitely glad I got the movie.
1078;Love this movie and have for the last 25 years.
1079;This has all of the backstory about the film and great performances all around.
1080;Will bring back memories to most all of us born and raised in the 50's.
1081;a movie that you will surely want to watch more than once.
1082;I am looking for good 80s movies to share with my kids.
1083;This is a good one.
1084;Has good messages and is engaging enough to keep them interested.
1085;This has to be one of my favorite movies based on a Stephen King book.
1086;A great coming of age tale of kids going on a adventure to find a body and become what they think will make them heroes.
1087;When I first heard about this movie,I just knew from the start that it was going to be good,but I never thought it was going to be such a masterpiece from beginning to end.
1088;this is undoubtedly one of the greatest coming.
1089;acting(5/5):The acting by these 4 kids is astonishing,and definitely the best part of the movie.
1090;And,last but not least,Jerry O'Connell is completely hilarious as the fat kid(Verno).
1091;story(5/5):The story isn't really challenging or confusing,but that's the beauty of it.
1092;sure,it sounds stupid on paper,but you come to love it once you see the movie.
1093;"And the one to point out is the story about Lardass(created by Gordy),also Verno is one to point,delivering each line hilariously,especially his trademark ""Sincerely!"
1094;The Verdict:This is truly a worthy coming.
1095;This is so well done.
1096;He loves this movie, great old time movie, its a movie you can watch over and over
1097;it keeps pausing i havent been able to even watch the movie.
1098;I just recorded this movie off cable today and watched it from the top and I thought, WOW.
1099;I am not a huge fan on Stephen King's books and movies but this was a well done film.
1100;This is a cute movie that pulls at your heart.
1101;I would not suggest it for children, as there are some bad language issues, but my wife and I enjoyed it immensely.
1102;I've wanted to review this film since I was 15(32 years old now, but worth the wait!)
1103;This movie made laugh, think and at times, even want to cry.
1104;I happen to enjoy both though, despite some differences, some small others, larger.
1105;I like this film because of several things, one: the young and somewhat unknown cast.
1106;This movie is about friendship and has absolutely nothing to do with sexual preference.
1107;that being said, the movie is one of those experiences that take you back to your own childhood.
1108;The innocence,loyalty, friendship, and adventure that you can really only have all at the same time at one part of your life.
1109;It reminds you of the deep lows and very high highs in that time where being accepted by your peers and belonging was the most important thing in life besides your family.
1110;If you are a guy over 25, you have to see this movie.
1111;Because STAND BY ME is one of those films you can watch again.
1112;Each cast member gives an incredibly praise.
1113;With wide blue eyes, chubby cheeks, and a constant whine, he is the typical fat kid who always gets picked on.
1114;The four boys genuinely and sincerely care about each other and have relationships as tight.
1115;overs as he has achieved his dream of being an author and wants to tell the world of the friends he shared many middle school experiences with.
1116;STAND BY ME will always be the best film of its coming.
1117;But they learn to rely on each other, care about each other, and emerge self.
1118;assured and more mature as a result.
1119;This film is poignant, touching, and dripping with nostalgia, as well as quite humorous.
1120;"The adventures and misadventures of 4 boys who ""come of age,"" so to speak, is one to be remembered throughout film history."
1121;At 14, I was in love.
1122;It was fun look up the actors afterwards and see how they grew up.
1123;The movie, the story, is great, I have seen this film before.
1124;All about the treasure of friendship.
1125;this movie is a must see.
1126;Excellent movie, will touch your heart.
1127;When the author (Stephen King) says this is the best depiction of one of his stories done in movie form, you can bank on it.
1128;It has a unique universal appeal to many of us who experienced many of the same things and had similar friends at that age.
1129;"This has got to be the best movie ever done about ""coming of age"", the journey, and the people and things we encountered at that innocent age."
1130;Five stars, and richly deserved, for this Rob Reiner production.
1131;Has to be River Phoenix's finest.
1132;Stand By Me is a classic coming of age movie about growing up and friendship and the pain of disillusionment when the adults you depend upon let you down.
1133;But the story is timeless .
1134;Every generation has it's own trivia that is very important to that generation.
1135;But today's generation can smile at the trivia of 47 years ago and still see the parallels between that trivia and their (to them) much more wonderful trivia.
1136;This is one of Stephen King's best stories, and is well worth reading or, if you like audio books, listening to.
1137;"And Stephen King says that he respected Rob Reiner's decision and thinks that ""Stand By Me"" was the first movie adaptation of his work that really fulfilled the spirit of the story."
1138;"stephen King also says that many of the things that happen in ""The Body"" and in ""Stand By Me"" are things he experienced himself in his childhood."
1139;This makes the story somewhat autobiographical, with Gordie being in some ways the young Stephen King.
1140;"In the novella ""The Body"" this is quite pronounced in that an adult Gordie is telling the story in the first person, and also tells how he's now become a successful writer of horror books."
1141;Laughing and learning on an adventure with best buddies is awesome.
1142;You will watch this movie more than once, even if you saw it when it first was released.
1143;This is an entertaining adaptation of the Stephen King novella The Body .
1144;driven movie about the relationships between a group of young boys in the 50s as they set out on an adventure and come of age.
1145;It's a great script and acting.
1146;It is the story told in flashback by an adult form of one of the main characters, and set in the late 50's.
1147;With a wonderful core cast, and a supporting cast of Kiefer Sutherland, John Cusack, and Bradley Gregg.
1148;"I love STAND BY ME
I:8763;1149;Deffinately check this movie out.
I:8763;1150;Stand by Me is one of those movies that reminds you of the joys of being a kid.
I:8763;1151;It reminded me a lot of the fun parts of my childhood.
I:8763;1152;I think that it is great at the end when Richard Dreyfus in a small cameo as the adult Gordie says that he will never really have the same kind of friends as he did when he was a kid.
I:8763;1153;To some degree, I believe that many people can relate to this feeling.
I:8763;1154;They relay a true sense of companionship as the young friends.
I:8763;1155;Stand By Me is good, very good.
I:8763;1156;It should become one of the Hollywood Club's classics, but many of today's generation never heard of it .
I:8763;1157;The viewer's emotional involvement with the characters is accomplished with a minimum of dialogue .
I:8763;1158;Many of those older generations can relate to the film's time period and to the characters' behaviors.
I:8763;1159;Teddy, in turn, tells everyone his dad died storming the beach at Normandy on D. day, while being haunted by the fact that he has a """"loonie"""" for a dad."""
1160;class towns and many of the older generations will relate.
1161;"The campfire tale about ""Lard Ass"" is hilarious."
1162;And this touches on the American male's general inability to make deep friendships beyond childhood.
1163;A very sentimental movie that is unfortunately timebound.
1164;Kudos to the Hollywood Gang for this one!
1165;Classic coming of age movie with excellent acting.
1166;Serious story well laid out, no blood and gore but would be scary, even potentially traumatic for the very young, but I will find a casual way to show this movie to my grand daughter when she hits 10 or 11.
1167;I just finished watching this movie for the fourth time and enjoyed every minute of it not many movies bring back memories of a persons childhood like this one did for me.
1168;I enjoyed watching the camping part of the movie.
1169;I thought the acting was good for the actors at their ages.
1170;One of the best coming of age movies out there and it stands the test of time highly recommend this movie to anyone who is not sure about the movie!!
1171;Another great 80s movie I grew up watching.
1172;perhaps this is a personal bias because I had friends like this when I was 12, but having said that this is one of the best films I have ever seen and it hits every chord perfectly.
1173;And as this film prophesizes correctly, the group has since split up and now I am only good friends with one of them.
1174;But this film explores the fears and anxieties of what it was like to be 12 again.
1175;But this film is honest about it's assessment of how they feel.
1176;The story moves along and hits a nerve because of the life that these four actors brings to their characters.
1177;There is a real sense of comrarderie between the four of them.
1178;But ultimately it is Phoenix that brings the most life to his character and I would say that the milk money scene with him and Gordie (Wheaton) is one of the more touching and poignant scenes ever filmed.
1179;what Stand By Me does is brings you back to a time when friendship was more pure and innocent and meant more.
1180;Perhaps this film means more to me for personal reasons ( as I've already stated ) but it is a wonderful film and it should be enjoyed by everyone.
1181;the last line of the movie is so true.
1182;Do we really ever has friends as good as the ones when we were twelve?
1183;Rob Reiner is really one of our great directors.
1184;Recently, he has made some, well, to be kind, not so good films.
1185;I was sad, but moved on to summer camp and life.
1186;Watching it (and the commentary and the really touching documentary.
1187;This film contains moments from your life.
1188;It captures so perfectly exactly what that time is like.
1189;It takes it place among my favorite works.
1190;A real and true masterpiece.
1191;I thank Stephen King, Rob Reiner, Richard Dreyfuss, for their honesty, pain, and truth.
1192;I enjoy Stand By Me a lot, it takes me back to when I was a kid growing in late 1950's in Nebraska.
1193;It's great story telling of young kids growing up in a time now long gone, also some good young actors in this film.
1194;Love music in film also.
1195;Just a great little gem of a film for all ages to see.
1196;This is one of the greatest movies ever filmed in Oregon, and I would like to take this opportunity to say that Dillon obviously needs to chill and use some vinegar based cleanser down south and doesn't know his heinie from a hole in the ground.
1197;This movie was wonderful story.
1198;I was moved by this movie.
1199;And the relationship between friends are nice and interesting.
1200;Also, kids are good actors, especially River Fenix.
1201;He was a good actor.
1202;If you watch this movie, you'll think this movie is great.
1203;My wife insisted that I watch this with her.
1204;Talk about an amazing Friday night.
1205;This is one of those movies that is an instant classic.
1206;it's a good movie, a VERY good (but not great) movie, it really opened up my eyes and understanding of the depth of friendship of boys.
1207;There were a lot of parts I couldn't relate, but I think this is one of the more honest, simple, and eye.
1208;it's one of the best down to Earth films I've seen, and the ending really made me think, I highly recommend seeing this.
1209;This movie features some of the best performances of young actors ever.
1210;First of all you must let me gush about River Phoneix.
1211;It's such a shame he had to die, he was such a wonderful actor.
1212;But Chris is smart and sensitive and River Phoneix plays him with such revealing honesty that it's hard not to cry just looking at his puckered little baby face!
1213;He plays Gordy, who's sort of the main character because he's the one telling the story.
1214;Will is such a cutie and I'm amazed at what a great actor this guy is, whatever has become of him!
1215;Overall this film really depicts the classic film study of 'coming of age' well.
1216;And being a teen I can relate to every one of these characters, even if they're boys.
1217;It's definately one of the best and most overlooked movies out there!
1218;It is a rare commodity in the film industry to come across a movie which depicts the process of growing up and the bonds that unite friends in such a heartbreakingly realistic fashion.
1219;Stand By Me , starring Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell, is just that and more, spiced with humor, suspense, and not to mention terrific performances by its remarkable cast.
1220;The unforgettable journey brings them closer together, and reveals a strength and sense of trust they never knew they posessed.
1221;probably one of the most beautiful things about this movie is the chemistry all of the characters seem to have together on screen, as well as the individual talents each bring.
1222;And it has still, after all these years, set a high standard for films to come.
1223;boomer that has seen and enjoyed this movie many times.
1224;I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it.
1225;Great acting from all the kids, nicely directed.
1226;Still relevant, in a throwback way, and now watching it with my almost 9 year old,I am reminded so much of its powerful impact from my son's laughter.
1227;This is a really good movie from back when River Phoenix was still alive.
1228;Keiffer Sutherland and Corey Feldman also had great roles in this movie.
1229;A great look into what it was like to grow up during the 1950's.
1230;I absolutely love this movie!
1231;It's one of my favorites and I could watch it over and over.
1232;It's got good plot, good acting and great child stars.
1233;I will keep this forever and pass it on to my children.
1234;I love Stand By Me.
1235;the acting is superb, but what I love most is the dialogue.
1236;It's very witty, very clever, and absolutely fantastic!
1237;classic coming of age movie.
1238;kept all of their attention.
1239;A great soulful story, that reminds me of my youth.
1240;Love this movie, it's one of our favorites.
1241;Great combination of slightly cheesy character development, intriguing storyline and nostalgic memories of summertime boredom and friends.
1242;in the innocent 50's, Gordie (played masterfully by Wil Wheaton) is the lonely, unwanted brother of a beloved son who has died (John Cusack).
1243;they camp out in the middle of woods during their adventure and tell stories and share their hearts with one another.
1244;Deep, caring guys who have been supressing their self.
1245;the acting is superb and you feel less like you're watching a film and more like you're one of these guys, joining them on their adventure.
1246;it's amazing to see the chubby little Jerry O'Connell who grew up to be the buff chick.
1247;the film is rich, tender and bittersweet.
1248;My teenage son is a fan of Big Bang Theory.
1249;My husband and I enjoyed seeing this classic once again and seeing familiar actors when they were fresh and young (like we once were too).
1250;My kids loved the story line, how crazy it was that kids their age were left to their own devices with freedom to get into lots of trouble.
1251;It is a R rated film however, it is very pedestrian compared to movies kids see now at PG13.
1252;Great movie that still has legs, both my boys enjoyed it!
1253;thank you Columbis Pictures for re.
1254;A movie this good should have received this kind of treatment the first time around, but I guess it's true what they say.
1255;Intense, funny, sad, realistic story from the book by the Horror master Stephen King.
1256;It'll have you laughing,and shedding some tears,all the way through it.
1257;This is hands down,one of the greatest movies ever made.
1258;Like Shawshank Redemption, this is a great film based on some of Stephen King's best work.
1259;"Back in my junior year of college (circa 1982) I read a story called The Body by Stephen King that really touched me
I:8763;1260;They/we got bullied by the neighborhood bullies.
I:8763;1261;And ultimately the journey is chock full of events that will stay in the memories of the group forever.
I:8763;1262;do justice to the book.
I:8763;1263;stand By Me was terrific.
I:8763;1264;It kept all of the most impressionable book scenes entirely intact.
I:8763;1265;And keep in mind that this was a Stephen King novella, so there's some pretty interesting stuff (you can count on King to wow you with precise tales of growing up as a baby boomer that include plenty of thrills.
I:8763;1266;importantly, the movie really captured the bonds of friendship so perfectly created in King's novella.
I:8763;1267;The Body was a moving, realistic portrayal of a day in the life of some young kids in a small town"
1268;stand By Me is a collector's item.
1269;I thought the movie was very well done, and stayed true to the book for the most part.
1270;I think the bridge scene could have been more detailed but overall a pretty good movie.
1271;For the folks unfamiliar with the work of Stephen King, rest assured that the horrormeister and book.
1272;movie monarch is also a gifted writer of non.
1273;Its mythic resonance is striking, with the youths planning their journey in what became a discovery of their own maturity, beyond their years.
1274;unknown actors Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix are extraordinary, and each deserved an Oscar nomination for their roles.
1275;The first time drama for director Rob Reiner so impressed critics and fans that much was expected of him after this.
1276;"alcoholic best friend lead their ""gang"" on an overnight adventure, pitted against the small town's older ""dimestore hoods"" (Keifer Sutherland in an early role)."
1277;"Along the way they face their own fears and sadness, fool round, and share ""bonding moments""."
1278;Reiner directs with a boy's.
1279;view, to the delight of all.
1280;River Phoenix went on to cutting edge roles, a cutting edge life, and a drug.
1281;As for bit players John Cusack and Richard Dreyfuss, their work continues to grow and evolve.
1282;This film's message and presentation obscure even this.
1283;Wheaton, Feldman, O' Connell, Reiner, Dreyfuss and even King hark back to the shooting.
1284;music Video: Though the late River is missed, it was immensely fun to watch him and Wheaton rock out with Ben E. King to the title tune.
1285;Stand By Me has always been one of my all.
1286;The chemistry between the four boys out to find the body of a kid their age has always been an inspiration for me growing up.
1287;rob Reiner's direction is tops.
1288;How he managed to get those four boys to act their hearts out is still a mystery today.
1289;Cameos by Richard Dreyfuss as the older Gordon, and John Cusack as Gordon's deceased brother Denny add an overwhelming feeling of delight to the entirety of this magnificent movie.
1290;special features include a behind the scenes of the film plus interviews with nearly the entire cast, a tribute to River Phoenix, Ben E King's music video of the theme song Stand By Me and commentary by director Rob Reiner.
1291;The price of the movie was great as well!!
1292;I would definitely do business with this company again!
1293;I really believe this movie will remain a classic and have legs for many years to come.
1294;You won't notice this while the movie is playing but you will notice the soft look of Stand By Me.
1295;The audio is well balanced and dialogue clear and distinguished so that once you set your volume you will not need to adjust it.
1296;There was also an extra with Stephen King talking about his memories of summers gone by that was pretty relatable to me.
1297;Maybe that is why this has always been a favorite film.
1298;I can cheer for kids who act like wise, brave, and strong adults, but I can't quite believe it.
1299;it's a movie, so I know that a lot has to happen to keep things interesting.
1300;If such exciting things happened to the average kid, there'd be a lot of great stories to tell.
1301;I can always feel nostalgic for a true and wise friend like Chris, or a supportive sibling like Gordie's older brother.
1302;Rob Reiner's Stand By Me is a celebration of those youthful adventures that eventually transform into cherished memories as the years go by.
1303;It is also a touching tale centered around the strong ties of friendship and the eventual loss of innocence one experiences when one comes of age.
1304;The coming of age aspect of the film also is emotionally powerful as it forces you to remember the exact point in your life when you ceased to be a child and moved into a new phase in life.
1305;A tip of the hat to Reiner and his young performers for creating such an engaging and nostalgic cinematic work.
1306;Rob Reiner directs this gem of a film.
1307;It holds the qualities of a less complicated world during the Fifties, and yet still shows the trials and tribulations of young boys and the friendships that they share.
1308;River Phoenix was such a wonderful actor, even at the age he was in this movie.
1309;I ordered this movie for my dads girlfriend and it arrived on time in great condition and still in the package.
1310;One of the best (if not the best) coming of age movies of all time.
1311;And it has cussing cause it's cool.
1312;The story was phenomenally captivating.
1313;from the start you won't want to stop, it is so much fun.
1314;It is a very serious movie, but at the same time it has a lot of well placed humor.
1315;All the characters have very distinctive and very likable personalities.
1316;This movie is a timeless classic.
1317;I will cherish it forever, and will definitely show this to my children.
1318;This is the greatest movie.
1319;There arn't many movies that I can watch a couple times of week, and this is one that I can.
1320;This is a great movie.
1321;STAND BY ME is an amazing film that totally captures small town life, the late 1950's and more universally what it's like to be at that in between age of 12 or 13.
1322;It is incredible how much we learn about the four friends .
1323;This can be credited to the performances of the young actors (all are excellent but River Phoenix really shines) guided by the expert direction of Rob Reiner and maybe most importantly the heartfelt source material, the novella THE BODY by Stephen King which is one of his best efforts outside of the pure horror genre.
1324;one of the things that impressed me most about the film is the kids talk, act and think like real kids of that age still do today and probably always will.
1325;But for anyone who has graduated from sixth grade or so this is a wonderful movie that shouldn't be missed.
1326;Great old movie based on one of my favorite old songs.
1327;I absolutely love this movie!
1328;Everything about it is just amazing.
1329;First of all, let's start off by how great the cast is and how well they portray their characters.
1330;River Phoenix (may he RIP) is absolutely phenomenal as Chris and his performance made an impact on me that I don't even understand.
1331;It is a classic coming.
1332;It wasn't so long ago that I was the same age as these kids and this movie just brought out everything I loved and cherished about my childhood, even though I never went on a search for a dead body.
1333;I recommend this movie to everyone!
1334;It was made back in 1986, which is before my time, but that's the beauty of it.
1335;Anyone can watch it and still enjoy it because of that timeless factor that it possesses.
1336;It is a rare gem!
1337;The story of four young boys going a trip of their lifetime is so unforgettable.
1338;All of the boys realize something important in their life through the adventure.
1339;"This is a great film about coming of age and friendship
I:8763;1340;River Phoenix is radiant in this picture"
1341;Three cheers for this great film!
1342;I love this movie, I used to watch this movie all the time when I was younger.
1343;I knew every single word to it.
1344;I'm glad I own it, cause when they play it on TV they cut out the good stuff.
1345;classic move and a great deal im glad i found it on here !
1346;Great Movie and my grandchildren love it!
1347;My grandson is blind but he loves to listen watch movies like this!
1348;Classic, got to share with my grandson.
1349;Wonderful story, great acting, highly recommend to anyone who has not seen it.
1350;This brings back to many memories.
1351;Wath watch watch it !
1352;Enjoy it every time I see it.
1353;I would recommend this movie to anyone who like to watch movies from an earlier time.
1354;Great story portrayed by great actors.
1355;Soundtrack is excellent from time period.
1356;Had to convince my wife to watch and she bought the soundtrack while watching.
1357;Very happy with this movie and it's cool that it's on Blu.
1358;When listening to Rob Reiner's commentary on the tragic story of what happened to River Phoenix, one can't help but be moved by the final scenes of this seminal 80's movie.
1359;I was a late teenager when I saw this and it clicked perfectly with memories of when I was a kid and had a bunch of buddies that did the normal kid stuff.
1360;Let me just say that the four leads are incredibly natural and give fine performances, even Jerry O'Connell whose first film this is.
1361;And of course Kiefer Sutherland is wonderfully menacing !!
1362;it's great to see the cast and director and Stephen King remark on the making of the film.
1363;Knowing this was King's favorite adaptation of his work really makes this more affecting.
1364;So relive those fun times as a kid if you have seen this before and watch it again.
1365;well, let me just say not to eat any pie before watching it!!!
1366;i watched it with my grandkids ages 14, 10, 8, boys i loved that they all cried in the movie, and it was made in oregon we live in oregon thank you
1367;One of the greatest movies of all time, and I'm glad I found it.
1368;Everyone should see this movie at least once in their life time.
1369;Daughters 14 and 12 liked it.
1370;Great movie and sound track.
1371;Whoever said Steven King is only a horror writer never enjoyed this story or Shawshank Redemption, among many others.
1372;Classic movie with a great cast!
1373;I got a pleasant surprise though when my kids sat through the entire movie and liked it.
1374;It was funny to let them see what kids from an older generation did.
1375;"I like a story which was written by Stephen King, and ""Stand By Me"" is the favorite one."
1376;Thay are really cute, and they are a symbol or emblem of teen.
1377;That's why this movie is loved by people from every country.
1378;This movie is definitely the best I've ever watched in my life: it's true, moving, simply beautiful.
1379;The actors are amazing, in spite of their young age (I especially want to underline River Phoenix's performance), and the story and everything are just great.
1380;You'll fall in love with it, forever.
1381;STAND BY ME is a glorious look into the lives of four adolescents who don't leave such glorious lives.
1382;It's one of those you'll laugh, you'll cry movie.
1383;The performances are terrific from each of the four boys, and it's kind of sad to think that Pheonix wasted his life on drugs.
1384;i'm a little tired now so I can't say much of this movie but really, it's great, go watch it.
1385;"I even knew an Ace Merrill, but ""Big Al"" was nice to us boys."
1386;"at the beginning of ""Stand by Me"" when Richard Dryfus is remembering the good old days, you can really feel it."
1387;"especially as BB King's ""Stand by Me"" is played in the background."
1388;Lots to enjoy and laugh at.
1389;You'll like the interactions and fun things that happen.
1390;The guys are great to watch.
1391;That is thier extreme friendship.
1392;I like this movie very much, its one that they made just like the book.
1393;First time I noticed River Phoenix's talent.
1394;I fell in love with this movie when I first saw it.
1395;This movie has to be my all time favorite!
1396;I recommend this movie to everyone, it's the greatest!
1397;R. i. p River Phoenix, I love you!
1398;"Well, that's what ""Stand By Me"" is about
I:8763;1399;loud humor and introspective moments of awe, it's a movie that never wears thin.
I:8763;1400;There's plenty of summer adventure in it, big laughs among friends, and that feeling of living in the wild, if only for about forty.
I:8763;1401;It puts you in such a state, as it's displayed in such an honest, realistic way that it captivates you all the way through.
I:8763;1402;Like with a lot of other, great movies, this one has many, sub.
I:8763;1403;The ending is very powerful and moving, and as the credits roll, the '61 song """"Stand By Me"""" plays."""
1404;this is an excellent summer movie that goes by quickly, but leaves such an impression on you that you'll remember and love it forever.
1405;But through all the drama and action, it's a definite work of art that's sure to please anyone who sees it.
1406;the movie was well made with good acting.
1407;But we both agree that Stand By Me is one of the best coming of age films ever made.
1408;The performances by these young men are truly outstanding.
1409;this is a wonderful film for fathers and sons to watch together.
1410;Another thing that amazed me is my son loved the soundtrack of late fifties hits.
1411;Watching this film with your kids also provides a great opportunity to discuss the tragic death of River Phoenix and ease into the waters on the dangers of drugs.
1412;The widescreen version only adds to the enjoyment of the great exterior scenes.
1413;I am very happy to report that the new special edition of this disc adds several new features including an excellent documentary called Walking the Tracks: The Summer of Stand By Me .
1414;Rob Reiner has made a movie which will be remembered as a classic of its genre and is sure to be loved by all ages.
1415;A classic coming of age film.
1416;Undoubtedly the best cast of adolescent boy actors ever assembled for a movie.
1417;Wil Wheaton and the late River Phoenix both give memorable performances in a movie that really reflects the era I grew up in.
1418;"Along the way they learn some lessons and do some ""growing up"", and have one last magical adventure before starting Junior High that fall."
1419;So a great cast of young actors.
1420;coast scenery provides the backdrop for the boys' own inner journeys at a seminal point in their young lives.
1421;age thing has been done many times, but rarely as well as this and with such affection and believability.
1422;it seems, at least in my memory, that this film was rather overlooked on its initial release, but I predict it will be remembered as a true classic in the generations to come.
1423;I must have seen this movie an incredible number of times.
1424;The humor came very familiar, and the movie as a whole shined as one of the greatest stories ever told.
1425;acted but they were young boys.
1426;Still enjoyable movie to watch on a low key night at home.
1427;In the style of all feel.
1428;To those who have not seen this film it embodies the true friendship of youth on the long road to adulthood.
1429;You can clearly see that the quartet of friends are lost in 'the best times'.
1430;Lachance's vivid storytelling, chambers' diplomacy, Duchamp's war effort and Vern's lost penny jar all amount for a well balanced and moving film.
1431;A wonderful, classic coming of age adventure.
1432;drama that will never get old, Stand By Me is truly a classic story of friendship that is unusual in being centered around pre.
1433;teen characters who are as enjoyable and engaging as any adults.
1434;Yet another 80's classic where the young show the adults how it's done.
1435;Along the way, master wordsmith King is able to develop each and every character to a point where readers can really care for or sympathize with their problems or successes.
