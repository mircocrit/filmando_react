1;The movie is awesome .
2;charged epic whose theme is: 'Man's struggle for his freedom.
3;this film dramatizes the essence of the Roman psyche: the lust for gaining control, for power.
4;as another reviewer has correctly pointed out, this film also deals with the theme of fraternity and solidarity .
5;it clearly portrays how the deprivation of a fundamental universal value: freedom .
6;makes men transcend regional and other man.
7;made barriers and ties them in such a powerful bond that they're willing to die for one another.
8;it represents a supreme sense of self.
9;and the conviction that a death bought by your struggle for freedom is far more honorable and glorious than a life obtained at the price of your dignity and quietly submitting to subjugation and injustice.
10;this film has several beautiful, unforgettable scenes.
11;representing a tremendous sense of hero.
12;"worship, unity and courage
13;Needless to say, the other performances were excellent too.
14;this film is a must.
15;see for all who not only enjoy historical epics but who also love the projection of man as a heroic being.
16;'Spartacus' is a tribute to all those known and unknown heroes of the world who have the conviction and courage to pay the price of their blood for their values.
17;i wonder if the people spartacus represented get free stuff in that country still like the slaves families here do.
18;stanley kubrik directs so you know its a great one.
19;those interested in history or just good old fighting will enjoy this one the most.
20;it is,like i said ,true.
21;another great film by stanley kubrik!!!!!!!!!!!
22;Spartacus is a great action film and one of the best epics of all time, but it is even more with this version.
23;This movie shattered the Hollywood Blacklist and really takes a look at how often we eliminate subversive people or ideas because they threaten the establishment, how we mistreat good people.
24;The acting is brilliant: Kirk Douglas is the most underrated actor of all time, and although this is not his best performance, it certainly smacks of greatness.
25;Lawrence Olivier is sometimes called the best actor of all time, and he lives up to it here.
26;As the dictatorial Crassus, he is brilliant beyond words.
27;Charles Laughton is also in that category of Greatest Actors of All Time, his performance here is great.
28;Peter Ustinov won an Oscar with his portrayal of Batiatus, a slave trader who develops a conscience.
29;This movie should be watched with Paths of Glory, they are both excellent and they go together.
30;this movie is packed with extras.
31;There is an interesting documentary on the Hollywood Ten, info about the blacklist, letters, sketches.
32;One of the best films of its era and any other, Spartacus is a thrilling and monumental achievement in cinema.
33;It is quite good, although sometimes the sets are tacky and some of the acting is rather, um, ludicrous.
34;But overall it a very entertaining film that, while it may not give an accurate portrait of ancient Rome, is rather stirring.
35;That last scene packs a pretty hefty emotional punch.
36;Spartacus is one of the best movies ever produced.
37;Still bugs me that Tony Curtis, a """"singer of songs,"""" stands there and recites poetry."""
38;I used to love this movie, I saw it countless times when I was a child and then in adolescense and to me it was perfect.
39;the big battle, I thought before it was very well portrayed with hundreds of soldiers participating and a great approach to the battle field by the Roman Legions, and then it becomes messy.
40;What a waist of energy.
41;Apart from the excellent graphics and sound the Criterion edition offers, just watching the late Peter Ustinov chat about his fellow actors, Laughton and Olivier especially, is worth the extra bucks for this edition.
42;impaired), gives insightful commentary to the making of this epic.
43;"If you have a ""home theatre"", this is a bonanza for your wide."
44;It's full of great fight scenes, adventure, and love.
45;Laurence Olivier was brilliant as General Crassus.
46;It's such a classic film.
47;is a movie that is a story of a man who almost brought ROME to its knees.
48;Gladiator is excellent, but when you see thousands running into battle in Spartacus, it's actually thousands of real people, not CGI characters.
49;it is kind of dated now and probably too long, but still a great film.
50;Lots of Kubrick's special touch too.
51;This movie is a real classic.
52;i loved watching every minute of it.
53;this movie is fun and interesting from start to finish.
54;He does an amazing job.
55;Douglas does a very good job playing the title character Spartacus.
56;The whole acting cast is top notch.
57;not only are they good, but the sets are beautiful and the detail is there too.
58;The music is perfect for this film.
59;this is a must see movie.
60;You're in for a treat.
61;Whether one can draw that inference from the story line of this cinematic effort is another question.
62;Not for the last time the master wins.
63;That is the real message here.
64;winning Peter Ustinov) and a little Roman ruling class intrigue between the good Roman republican (Charles Laughton) and the first of a line of would.
65;See this older classic cinematic effort for the acting and fine directing.
66;this is a wonderful movie about gladiators that then start there own war and fight against the roman army.
67;Knowing the history makes the film all the more meaningful.
68;Spartacus not only has the elements you'd expect of a classic Hollywood gladiator film, such as tense battle scenes and epic backdrops.
69;It also has surprisingly deep characters, especially the villains, whose motivations are multifaceted and more complex than just purely evil.
70;It also has excellent, satirical commentary on politics and even sexuality in ancient Rome.
71;Finally, the ending is absolutely superb.
72;All in all, one of my favorite classic movies.
73;This is one of the great movies that was made in the 60's.
74;Though Kubrick had little to no control over this film, it's still a classic in every sense of the word.
75;One of Stanley Kubrick's earlier films, this is an occasionally rousing epic with well.
76;choreographed action sequences and grand speeches.
77;scaled epic, but this movie certainly hasn't aged well.
78;But it remains an awesome epic of loss, misery, defeat and yet, somehow, also of hope.
79;the cast is among the finest ever assembled.
80;Kubrick's work is stunning, and even after 41 years, the battle scenes are striking.
81;It is the tale of a mans struggle for freedom against the tyranny that is Rome.
82;I highly recommend this film.
83;Stanley Kubrick's SPARTACUS marked the public reemergence of blacklisted Hollywood Ten screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who for years had penned scripts under several aliases.
84;Kirk determined to make a Roman epic the equal of Wyler's.
85;He definitely succeeded with this fictional story based on real people and events.
86;As Metty's name was on the credits, he won an Oscar for a picture he barely worked on.
87;in hindsight, one of Kubrick's points of contention with Trumbo, that Spartacus is presented without flaws, is very strong.
88;alex North's inventive music score, originally recorded on six.
89;track 70mm film, adds much to this picture.
90;His love theme is particularly memorable.
91;This is a Hollywood classic, and deservedly so.
92;Kirk Douglas was the force behind the Stanley Kubrick directed movie.
93;douglas does a believable job, and the story takes center place.
94;Sure, there's action and lots of swordplay and a large cast of extras to fill in the crowd scenes, but the love story takes center place, and Jean Simmons is haunting in her quiet portrayal of the heart of the movie.
95;it makes a symbolic statement, and Douglas keeps the movie on track and dramatically sound.
96;good movie, engrossing and well acted.
97;This holiday has become something it never was, though it still has some value to modern people.
98;I have always loved this movie, watching it every chance I caught it on TV.
99;"ray just makes it greater
100;Well, call me a romantic but I still love this picture.
101;And it has a bit of Hollywoodness in its love story and presentation (music etc.), but it also had heart and it strived to evoke a spirit of rebellion and defiance of oppression that moved me way back when and still does today.
102;it's a helluva an entertaining movie!Stanley Kubrick replaced Anthony Mann after production began.
103;all that is interesting, but beside the point.
104;well, it gets the blood moving.
105;I love defiance in defeat.
106;You can have the razzle dazzle of Gladiator, I will take the emotional heart of Spartacus any day.
107;There is still something thrilling uplifting in watching someone go down to defeat with chin raised (cleft and all) in defiance.
108;Probably 4 to 4.1/2 stars, but will always be 5 to me for sheer entertainment.
109;Spartacus, starring Kirk Douglas, is one of most beautiful movies I have seen.
110;The self sacrifice and love portrayed in this movie is based on an example you would want your children to follow.
111;I swear, the Laserdisc we owned twenty years ago looked better than this.
112;It has a great story and a great casting.
113;Spartacus has a lot of moments of its own.
114;Laurence Olivier is every bit as brilliant as Marcus Licinius Crassus who is a true villain in every sense.
115;Kirk Douglas is memorable as Spartacus.
116;Jeans Simmons does a commendable job for playing Varinia.
117;hur has Spartacus accused of plagiarizing the former, Spartacus puts up a strong fight for the sake of a great cinema work.12/12: Seeing Spartacus once again, I still can't view it as a `10' picture.
118;Two more players emerge that make an impression on me are Peter Ustinov and Charles Laughton who turned in eye.
119;The overall story is still very good.
120;All in all, Spartacus is still a very good epic although is too long to sit through.
121;This is another wonderful Hollywood spectacular that is visually stunning, predating the dreadful grossly exaggerated CGI effects in most genre movies today.
122;All the thousands of extras are REAL!
123;Not as appreciated in its initial release as it deserved to be, the film stands tall today among the best Hollywood epics.
124;I especially enjoyed Laurence Olivier's deliciously evil performance as Marcus Crassus, Spartacus' prime Roman antagonist.
125;There's a great battle of scene stealers between Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov.
126;Ustinov got the oscar for best supporting player.
127;Two other major assets are the fabulous film score by Alex North and Dalton Trumbo's screenplay which is both literate and entertaining without ever getting dull.
128;Producer Douglas, this film is among his greatest achievements.
129;photographed and produced spectacular was filmed in the wake of a number of similar Hollywood blockbuster epics like Ben.
130;hur , yet wound up becoming a much more popular success with much more enduring appeal than its predecessors.
131;One can safely shelf the series of formula flicks that followed in its wake (especially after the success of Hercules , with Steve Reeves)in favor of this much more substantial and much more painstakingly produced effort.
132;Kirk Douglas is simply magnificent as the slave/gladiator turned by circumstance into a revolutionary leader, and the rest of the cast is stellar, as well, in this loosely.
133;This particular epic, wonderfully directed by Stanley Kubrick, marked the beginning of a rather stormy and uneven relationship with Douglas, who in fact provided Kubrick with some much needed breaks in route to his stellar career.
134;They also collaborated on Paths of Glory .
135;The movie is well acted and well scripted, the cinematography is absolutely wonderful.
136;The net effect of the movie is to masterfully recreate the world of long ago and far away in the best movie tradition, and as well as been accomplished either before or since.
137;It is my understanding he disowned this Hollywood epic and was deeply ashamed of it.
138;But back to the story: since Tony could not sing, he recited (laughs) poetry!
139;Then, he becomes a singer of songs for Spartacus and his group of gladiators, former slaves and highly skilled professional killers.
140;kubrick was a great director.
141;It starts good and gets better and is very engaging.
142;I think its Dougs best role.
143;I enjoyed it even more with Blu Ray, worth the price, nice gift for yourself or another watcher of classic movies.
144;It was chosen as the manliest movie of all time in """"The Big Damn Book of Sheer Manliness,"""" but has much more to recommend it, of course."""
145;In some scenes the background, ostensibly outdoors, is obviously and inexplicably a stage set, contrasting jarringly with the real outdoor shots seen throughout most of the film.
146;At any rate, the film's virtues outweigh its faults, and is a remarkable achievement, coming out when it did, unlike almost anything which had gone before.
147;He deals Rome a staggering blow, and in that respect he and his army of slaves is extremely successful.
148;This is perhaps best illustrated in the final duel between Spartacus and Antoninus.
149;Still, Spartacus tries, and in this, at least, he asserts his right to be a human being just like anybody else.
150;this film is rightly labeled a thinking man's epic.
151;The battle scenes in this movie are phenomenal for their grand scale, and the action keeps you on your toes.
152;Great acting, great directing, and a captivating story.
153;This is a typical example of a perfect movie.
154;Every time I watch it, I find more and more in it.
155;Tough ending but so well done.
156;Action, love, freedom, spectacle and so well acted.
157;Who among us could ever forget one of the greatest moments in cinematic history.
158;released in '60, `Spartacus' is arguably the greatest gladiator film of all.
159;Directed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick and starring the iron.
160;"stand up and shout it with me, ""I'M SPARTACUS!"""
161;rate and I feel confident using it.
162;My info is secure and I can count on a timely response.
163;"I also appreciate the fact that you value my opinion
164;After all,satisfied customers return and spread the word!
165;The acting in the movie is great.
166;Olivier is fantastic as is Jean Simmons and Ustinov.
167;Spartacus has always been one of y favorite movies since seeing it in 1960 when it was released!
168;How many played Spartacus?This film even compared to todays greats like Braveheart and Gladiator holds its own.
169;The restoration is excellent, and the cast, sets, and music are incredible.
170;In one scene we see the armies marching into postion from a hillside and the view is spectacular.
171;The arena fight scenes are still great to watch even after seeing recent special effects in movies like Gladiatior.
172;The love scenes between Spartacus and Varinia are well done.
173;Good entertainment for all but the very young.
174;it is one of his favorite movies.
175;It also has additional information which he wanted.
176;In my opinion, this is the best of the Biblical epic films (as in the 10 Commandments, Ben Hur, Greatest Story Ever Told), despite its story being largely secular.
177;My favorite Kirk Douglas performance of all.
178;Spectacular war epic, romance, and docu.
179;I love classic movies and this is one of them.
180;I wanted to see a movie with depth and found it in this old classic.
181;Very good take on the slave wars of Ancient Rome.
182;rate throughout, with the possible exception of Kirk Douglas himself).
183;slavery military epic, Edward Zwick's Glory is much more compelling, not to mention true, and has an American.
184;It has a grand sweep and historical flavor that is easy to watch and even at 3+ hours, doesn't drag.
185;If the plot lacks serious historical grounding, they make it up in some of the details.
186;Watching the checkerboard legions form up and perform the manipular extension is remarkable in its authenticity.
187;a rather complex and mysterious historical figure).
188;Which Spartacus is the real Spartacus, the one I enjoyed the first time or found somewhat disappointing 5 years later?
189;I think the scene where Douglas and the black man fight to the death is one of the best of this type of Rome fighting scenes every made.
190;The movie was very clear and sharp and I enjoy watching it over and over.
191;It is one of my All Time Best films.
192;Sorry, I ran on a bit.
193;The cast is actually matched by the screen play.
194;the tale is however a look into the black heart of Roman power and manipulation.
195;the rebellion has become rich, mighty and is led by astute minds but how far will their abilities and deep bonds of brotherhood take them.
196;The performance by the cast is Outstanding by any measure.
197;From the opening of the show to its unforgettable end this movie enlightens and entertains on a high level.
198;The love story between Spartacus and Virinia is one of the great one's on film.
199;Stanley Kubrick's rousing 1960 epic Spartacus is an intelligent and emotive account of an historic slave uprising in the late Roman Republic.
200;It is also a treat for people who dig thongs, togas, and sandals like me.
201;Another standout is veteran heavy Woody Strode as the skin.
202;The best bit is still the reaction to the demand Which one of you is Spartacus?
203;to which everybody, including the people with the popcorn, stand up and shout out: I'M SPARTACUS!
204;The excellent Criterion version was the last.
205;Next up, I hope, is a solid Blu.
206;the prelude to the final battle scene is awesome.
207;kirk Douglas, as """"Spartacus,"""" the leader of that revolt, was excellent and Peter Ustinov shines, too."""
208;The dialog given Ustinov and Charles Laughton was intelligent.
209;I enjoyed watching it more than I had remembered.
210;And when the Roman armies are arrayed against Spartacus and his slave army, it is really amazing to behold.
211;And the bigger screen you can watch it on, the better it would be.
212;this movie really does mix in the personal relationships with the spectacular scenes quite well.
213;And the performances of leads are very fine.
214;A funny moment in a movie without a lot of laughs.
215;You will enjoy hearing what they see and explaining to them what they are seeing, who the actors were, and maybe a bit about the historical Spartacus (look it up before you watch the film).
216;This is a true classic.
217;Gladiator was a magnificent movie but I have to say, Russell Crowe .
218;This movie rates in my top 5 as far as favorite movies.
219;Kirk Douglas is outstanding in his performance and the storyline is great as well.
220;Always nice to see the original movie to compare to the latest remake of a classic.
221;But SPARTACUS is a wonderful synergy of both movies.
222;Like GLADIATOR, it situates itself in Roman times, telling the fascinating story of slave.
223;But all political factors aside, this is a great film that tells a human story.
224;Kirk Douglass' performance is incredible, breathing much more life and complexity into Spartacus than I expected.
225;On the whole, the acting performances in this film are splendid.
226;"I still chuckle when I think of the way he delivers his finest line to Crassus, commander of the Roman legions: ""Spartacus.yes I knew him well."
227;Of course, he has had nothing to do with Spartacus's success and his delivery is perfect.
228;lawrence Olivier has a surprising scene in which he tries to seduce one of his male.
229;The dialogue is simply chilling and the delivery is icy.
230;It is Olivier's finest scene and adds wonderful backstory to the character of Crassus.
231;the battle sequence in the film is absolutely stunning.
232;But then again, Kubrick always said that one man should create a film, just as one man should paint a painting.
233;in my view, SPARTACUS is definitely one of the best epic films that I have seen.
234;I was also pleased with the non.
235;Spartacus is simply the greatest epic ever made.
236;I have loved this movie ever since we were forced to watch it every single year in history from 7th thru 12th grade (but it did kill about a weeks worth of class time), so getting the Criterion was a great treat.
237;The extras on the second disc aren't all that intriguing (except for the blacklist documentary The Hollywood Ten), but the commentary and the restored print of the film are incredible.
238;(Take advantage of public tours, like I did.
239;The cast is superlative, best ever assembled during the age of epics.
240;"Thus I greatly admire ""Spartacus"" as a political film worthy of Machiavelli."
241;How many times must we see happy, freed slaves?I presume director Stanley Kubrick, a mid.
242;Kirk Douglas the actor/producer playing Spartacus, has a large dimple on his chin, his unique, totally identifying physical feature.
243;"I still think ""Spartacus"" is one of the best epics of that period, after ""Ben."
244;"hur"" (my favorite), and perhaps ""The Ten Commandments"", both starring Charlton Heston."
245;Although he was never happy with Spartacus, due to creative differences with Kirk Douglas, any other director would be very proud of it.
246;on the whole, Spartacus is an excellent film.
247;The transfer, on the special two disc edition, is very good but what marks this edition out as the best is the plethora of extra features, which have sadly been cut down on the blu ray edition.
248;a great film presented in an excellent edition.
249;A cast of supreme stars.
250;A supporting cast of ten thousand human beings.
251;I first viewed this film in the early 1960's and was entirely engrossed by it.
252;I remember, too, the very touching love scenes between Douglas and Simmons.
253;Their love was magnificent, real and precious.
254;indeed, this epic rates as one of my all time favourite films because of it's huge scope and emotional appeal.
255;A timeless story that touches the heart and excites the mind.
256;The CRITERION version is superior for it's technical pains and special bonus material.
257;My husband and I have loved this movie for years, and he has been wondering if/when it would be available on Blu.
258;I'm sure we'll both enjoy it for years to come.
259;Kirk Douglas was wonderful in this movie.
260;A must see movie if you've never seen it.
261;Don't listen to those Kubrick fans who pretend to like it and say it is great.
262;This is a great movie.
263;Always enjoyed Kirk Douglas' acting.
264;So many wonderful actors in this movie.
265;The drama of this movie was excellent.
266;Kirk Douglas at his best, I love him.
267;To me, this movie is one of the great ones.
268;Add in that the screenplay was written by Dalton Trumbo, of whom I am a great fan, and you've got yourself a classic film.
269;It's tells the tale of Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) who is a bold gladiator slave.
270;This is one of the greatest biographical films of a historical figure in the history of Hollywood.
271;kirk Douglas' performance as Spartacus is top.
272;Although many of his actions are highly influenced by 20th century attitudes towards slavery, it is nonetheless a memorable rendition of the life of the real Spartacus.
273;Best of all, Douglas injects a healthy amount of humanity in a man whose personal life we know precious little about.
274;the film gives us a glimpse of what would shortly become known as the First Triumvirate: Gaius Julius Caesar, Crassus and Pompey the Great.
275;It is Crassus, otherwise the least well.
276;In this case, the reverse is true.
277;sPARTACUS gives us a great many factual circumstances which did really happen, such as his being betrayed by the pirates who had promised to get his men to Sicily.
278;Here are some of the most professional and greatest soldiers the world has ever seen, and yet they adhere to the dictum of Spartacus.
279;Stanley Kubrick directed this epic film, with Kirk Douglas in 1960.
280;It is a classic, based on real historical events, with a but of artistic license.
281;"
282;it is a movie which features some of the greatest stars ever to be on the screen, from Douglas to Olivier to Laughton.
283;Its a good classic movie, I've enjoyed it since I was a young child.
284;While the background music can be a bit corny its still a good story and will keep you interested
285;Stanley Kubrick disowned this film.
286;fact, I consider it a classic.
287;Spartacus has lost a wee bit of its original impact over the years, but it is still a wonderful and rewarding film.
288;And seeing the restored version was a real treat.
289;star cast that includes Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, and Laurence Olivier, this wonderfully.
290;acted spectacle follows Spartacus' rise to power and his ultimate demise.
291;I have always liked Sparticus and I am glad I got it in Blue Ray now It makes a better movie.
292;Excellent video transfer"
293;even if you love the movie .
294;This movie has it all in epic proportions that engage the modern mind into choosing where they fall in the mix.
295;Kirk Douglas, Stanley Kubrick and THE chariot race for all times.
296;Kirk Douglas shows once again his versatility in this story of doom, virginity of the heart at its' best, and commitment.
297;Truly a man to pattern one's own self to .
298;This simple explanation will open with the idea, that it wasn't so easy .
299;Gave purpose to hope and faith.
300;This is truly an epic film and ment to be watched with everyone in interest.
301;Universal, this is a wonderful and beloved film that we had hoped you'd give at last an ounce of respect to.
302;One of the best classic films.
303;Very good combination of action and dialog.
304;Spartacus is one of the epic movies of the 1960s.
305;This is a compelling and well made film that is a joy to watch.
306;Spartacus displays exceptional leadership skills that led to the early success of the revolt.
307;this gripping movie is set in the period 73.71 BC in the last days of the Roman Republic.
308;The battle scenes from the slave revolt are done very well.
309;The grandeur of Rome is well depicted and the gladiator training looks very realistic.
310;the movie shows Spartacus as a courageous and honourable man who fought for a principled cause.
311;Those who love action will enjoy the epic battles fought between the rebels fighting for freedom and the Roman army.
312;this is a great movie that won several Oscars and is highly recommended.
313;This film is a classic.
314;This road show presentation is leaps and bounds superior to the Criterion 2 disc video transfer.
315;Yes, it is still soft in spots, but for a film of this age, especially one lacking so much of the original film elements, this is probably the best it will ever look.
316;It has that biblical epic feel that's almost unusual in a Kubrick film.
317;But mystical or not, this is still a very good film.
318;Based on both legend and historical fact, the tale of Spartacus is one that has inspired many writers and activists.
319;It's about freedom, friendship, love, family, and hope.
320;This film adaptation features the perfectly cast Kirk Douglas as the hero himself.
321;He, Peter Ustinov, Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, and many more make a fine ensemble of actors.
322;The music is very impressive (kudos to Alex North), and costumes and sets are lovely to look at.
323;It's a very good film by Kubrick, and it's a well.
324;told tale of freedom, love, and life.
325;All I can say is excellent, large cast movies are a thing of the past which is a shame, because there is nothing like them.
326;If you are a fan of epic style films and you like Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Tony Curtis, and Jean Simmons, amongst other cast members, to large to list, you will definitely like this.
327;It came in great condition and on time.
328;It is a wonderful classic that the whole family can sit down and watch over and over again.
329;This picture is a classic.
330;It comes complete with incredible battle scenes.
331;Alot of people think the film master Stanley Kubrick directed this film.
332;production, screen writing and storyboard, the original director was fired.
333;I think everyone should see it though because it is a classic.
334;Stanley Kubrick has given us many memorable films, but this is my personal favorite.
335;'Spartacus' is one of the great Hollywood epics and Kirk Douglas' defining role.
336;It is a brilliantly written screenplay that combines the struggle for freedom from oppression with a compelling love story in a setting that accurately depicts the majesty as well as the corruption of the Roman Empire.
337;His attention to the details of the period was wonderful.
338;The orchestration of tens of thousands of extras in the battle scenes was phenomenal.
339;His presentation of the love scenes between Varinia and Spartacus were sensitive and compelling.
340;I was most impressed with his treatment of the slave army.
341;He put a human face on the slaves by showing mothers with their children and scenes of Spartacus walking among the people.
342;This completely wins the affections of the viewer.
343;kirk Douglas gave a powerful performance and created a character that was bigger than life.
344;He was strong and inspirational while simultaneously being gentle and kind.
345;Laurence Olivier gave a riveting performance as Crassus.
346;jean Simmons has had an impressive acting career that has spanned more than 50 years.
347;She is both a great beauty and an enchanting actress.
348;She gave Varinia dignity, strength of character and a quiet seductiveness that played well off the power exuded from Douglas.
349;Their screen chemistry was both passionate and touching.
350;this is among the best epics ever made and certainly among the top three films about the Roman Empire.
351;This film should be on every film buff's list of required viewing and is highly recommended for its moving story to anyone who hasn't seen it.
352;Kubrick launched his career with this blockbuster.
353;In this epic film starring Kirk Douglas and directed by Stanley Kubrick, a slave turned gladiator leads a revolt against the Roman empire.
354;Along the way he is reunited with his love (Jean Simmons).
355;Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, and Peter Ustinov all have important roles in this film as well.
356;this has been one of my favorite movies for my whole life.
357;this is a great movie
358;But it's a more fluid film with a stronger story line and more interesting characters.
359;The performances are wonderful starting with Kirk Douglas as the leader of the slave revolt.
360;"Still it's a great film with terrific action sequences, great dialogue (""Do you like oysters or snails, Antoninus?)"
361;If you get a chance, see it on the big screen.
362;winning film of the same subject, so I thought this might be the opportune time to look at this classic film and tale.
363;the original film, based as it was on Fast's novel, takes many liberties with history.
364;The film portrays a rather simple pattern of slaves accumulating to the slave.
365;What this film does not do is set the stage properly historically .
366;the autocratic Crassus threatening the freedom of a great republic is easily translated into the `Red Scare' that so many people in the West, particularly in America, perceived in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
367;The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, of which it won four, including a nod to Ustinov as best supporting actor.
368;It also won the Golden Globe as best picture.
369;Crassus was for a time the wealthiest man in Rome, competing with Pompeii for power and influence.
370;The only primary female character in the film is Varina, superbly played by Jean Simmons, whose beauty was at its height during this time, and whose timeless voice carried much of the meaning of the slave revolt in real human emotions.
371;the staging of the film was dramatic and well.
372;"constructed
373;The film is in vivid technicolour, making this a real production of the `glory days' of Hollywood, where things were larger than life.
374;The cycle of history continues, and human freedom is something that is always to be valued, and requires the courageous and strong to work together and be willing to sacrifice .
375;The famous scene where all the conquered slaves stand to claim the identity of Spartacus is legendary, for good reason.
376;It is still a magnificent film.
377;In this age of CGI where thousands of soldiers can be created with the click of a computer mouse, it is so nice to see these large.
378;scale epics of the 1950s and '60s where vast armies were created the old fashioned way: with real people.
379;I give Kirk Douglas a great deal of credit for getting this massive film made.
380;The film features an intelligent literate script by the formerly black.
381;listed Dalton Trumbo and excellent performances from its large cast starting with star and executive producer, Kirk Douglas.
382;(Peter Ustinov won the supporting actor Oscar for """"Spartacus"""" that year, Charles Laughton is excellent in a supporting role as well.)"""
383;Another thing that cannot be mentioned enough is the magnificent score by Alex North.
384;"ray features North's magnificent Overture for the film and the ""Entr."
385;"acte"" music for the film's intermission, two wonderful features of the films of the past that seem to be lost forever.)"
386;There is some archival material special features.
387;in conclusion, this is a classic film, an all.
388;together intelligent epic that is still well.
389;remembered by those of us who saw it in the movies and will continue to be remembered for years to come.
390;Spartacus is a classic movie from another era that is well acted by Kirk Douglas and Sir Lawrence Olivier.
391;Now I see it's brilliance.
392;This is truly a masterpiece and one of the best movies there is.
393;was a great movie when released and remains a great movie noe.
394;excellent acting by Kurt Douglas with beautiful secenary
395;Kubrick's Spartacus is a great film I am not saying that.
396;now the liberal idea yes its good, esp.
397;so i can overlook the glorifying of Spartacus.
398;yet there, in a still wonderful performance by Charles Laughton, there he is!
399;also Crassus (an awesome, true performance by Olivier) was friends with Caesar, and he was Consul of Rome yes, but with Pompey!
400;nonetheless, the costumes, the uniforms, the battle scenes are great that is for sure.
401;"firstly, I don't see what some other reviewers are complaining about!I played this and watched it on my 52"" Sony and I was extremely pleased and fascinated by how GREAT Spartacus looks in ""Blu""!"
402;The story of Spartacus begins with him as a free spirited Thracian slave in 70BC.
403;is largely rooted in truth.
404;the movie can best be described as epic.
405;On a grand scale, the Roman empire is brought to life, with its corrupt aristocracy and its simple lower class.
406;The epic battle scene which forms the climax of the movie features 1000s of extras, and although it is sometimes hard to tell who is on which side, the effect is magnificent and grandiose.
407;Despite the action scenes, the movie is surprisingly introspective at times.
408;For instance, successful gladiators are given women to have their way with them.
409;In a rather daring move for the 1960s, Spartacus and his woman Varinia conceive a child out of wedlock, which is presented as natural and good.
410;It is, but that's the whole point.
411;so sure this is an epic movie.
412;This may be a movie that rivals the grandeur and scale of Ben Hur, but thematically, it doesn't come close.
413;even so, it's still worth a look.
414;Even if one cannot share the cause of Sparticus and political ambitions it embodies, one has to admire the spirit in which Spartacus fights for his cause: it is a losing battle, and yet with dignity and fervour he fights for what he believes is right .
415;It has comedy, tragedy, triumph, romance, action, intrigue, and an epic scale.
416;As entertainment, it's an enduring epic that still can be enjoyed today.
417;Originally, the republic which was composed of strong free men.
418;Julius Caesar was introduced as the shadow of the wings of power.
419;The Senate historically would have debated the issues and objected to outrageous demands.
420;the notion of divine right of kings was established.
421;A controversial film in its day (it was written by blacklisted writers), it survives today as a classic and one of the best films of both Kirk Douglas and Stanley Kubrick.
422;All the hits and bruises are real.
423;all in all, a great movie spectacle.
424;Engaging movie watching for the 21st century .
425;This is one great classic movie (in my opinion).
426;It can bring out a wide range of emotions.
427;I enjoy this classic movie over and over again.
428;"Great stuff
429;I love movies from the Roman era and Spartacus did not disappoint me at all!
430;Great acting, story, and it held my attention even in 2014.
431;An old movie, but very entertaining.
432;It was interesting then and interesting now.
433;If you liked Gladiator, or 300, then you will love this.
434;Kirk Douglas is at his best in this one.
435;It is a classic .
436;Great acting by Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis is in his major role.
437;This movie is more like an epic.
438;Not because it was poorly written or poorly acted but because it was supremely written and acted.
439;For a fan of true classics this should be in your top ten.
440;Douglas gives his best performance.
441;ray player and it worked like a charm.
442;This picture is sharp and clear and the soundtrack is great!
443;The copy is absolutely gorgeous.
444;The service was great and the delivery was within the time that was promised
445;Spartacus is one of the greatest films ever, directed by THE best direcor, Stanley Kubrick.
446;I watch it about every other week, and I still love it.
447;It's so epic and awesome!
448;This film of the young Kubrick is of course rather simple in subject and inspiration.
449;that's by far the best element in that film and that's the signature of Kubrick himself.
450;kubrick adds to that some melodramatic love and even a child who will be generously freed by some master of the mother.
451;Fantastic job in shipping and handling.
452;Great epic from a bygone era.
453;it's a pity, given how good the movie is, and how good it should look on blu ray.
454;Spartacus rises up and inspires others to risk everything to end what they are going through.
455;Spartacus is one of the watch.
456;Great video and great sound for a premium, star.
457;This movie was moving from the beginning to the end.
458;This is probably my best Kirk Douglas movie to date.
459;It deserved any awards it received and probably more.
460;My main thrust here is to say this is one of THE most spectacular transfers of a vintage movie to Blu.
461;Jean Simmons's skin tone looks fine, and my word was she gorgeous!
462;As the years go by, I am better able to savor the socio.
463;Larry Olivier can play a villain to the hilt"
464;this is story that reflects the generation and it's beliefs.
465;It's a look at a generation ( the late 50's) that was beginning to change it's attitudes towards race and the sexes.
466;Gladiator reflects the worries and feeling of our generation not the Romans of the first century A. d. and the same is true of Spartacus.
467;They are shown as a powerful, ruthless, but ultimately Human.
468;No I found this movie to be very effective in it's message as well as for its entertainment value.
469;It's the timeless tale of the struggle for human dignity and freedom in the face of overwhelming odds.
470;It's a marvelous movie with the sweeping grandeur and larger then life performances required of all the great hollywood epics.
471;I can see much of Spartacus in the new Roman epic Gladiator and I enjoyed that movie equally.
472;I bought this as a gift for my husband.
473;They liberate slaves left and right and the Roman Republic sends Crassus with a large force to deal with him.
474;the movie conveys a strong message about the evils of slavery and gladiatorial combat.
475;The battle scene is well done and Spartacus's love relationship is very romantic so I would highly recommend this film.
476;I have enjoyed this movie over and over again and will do so for many years.
477;First of all, the movie is great, exciting acting and action, great story.
478;The sountrack transfer is also less than perfect.
479;The best feature on the 2nd disk is an interview with Peter Ustinov where he tells some of the background dirt behind Sparatus.
480;hilariously scrunching up his face and immitating the great Charles Laughton to tell us about the ego wars that Laughton conducted with Sir Laurence Olivier.
481;The others offering commentaries are uncensored in their criticism as well, so count this as the most honest and refreshing commentaries on the market!
482;When you finish the film, read about Dalton Trumball and the blacklist to further appreciate the significance of the film and the courage shown by Douglas.
483;A classic of epic porportions!
484;A gem of a movie, far surpassing today's digital products, and an excellent print with an excellent cast.
485;Another classic they don't make anymore, with great battle scenes!
486;"This rousing epic was disowned by Kubrick after a contentious, difficult production, but ""Spartacus"" still offers grand."
487;scale entertainment, thanks to bold, sure.
488;handed direction and a powerhouse cast.
489;jawed Douglas shines in his signature role, while Olivier is suitably poisonous as the cold.
490;This is a fantastic sword.
491;Kirk Douglas at his best in this period film.
492;Lots of name actors, and lots of action.
493;I recommend to any fan of Douglas.
494;While the director (and star) messes with history quite a bit, this movie was an instant classic, deserving of its many awards.
495;Great scenes from begining to end, and, when I saw those Roman Legions deploy into proper formations, instead of the armed mobs usually depicted by Hollywood, I knew it was to be good.
496;this film is one of the first movies to openly defy the blacklist.
497;supurb acting, directing, and story.
498;I thought the picture was clean and the sound great.
499;Douglas is heroic in a daring role that he embodies and plays to the fullest.
500;though kubrick didn't have too much to add to this movie, it is still a great, contained epic.
501;douglas is excellent in the lead and the direction is very good.
502;the story is exciting and well done for what it is (epics tend to either definitely succeed or definitely fail).
503;It is one of his all time favorite movies and he has talked about it for years.
504;and he was definitely surprised!
505;Bought this for my husband as a surprise gift and he just loves it.
506;A real Hollywood Spectacular Production.
507;The moive is classic as we all know.
508;It's the kind of film that has to be seen if you consider yourself a moive buff.
509;Good overall transfer, the movie is a classic, the audio ain't bad, it would be a fine choice.
510;Truly spectacular in every detail.
511;old and it's just as I remember it.
512;Spartacus is one of the best movies from the past.
513;Everything about it is very well.
514;The story, the acting, the directing, the settings are all exceptional.
515;There's a good reason this movie was so very popular when it debuted.
516;A classic by any definition.
517;Makes you really root for the underdog.
518;That the movie was ever completed at all is testiment enough to the genius and determination of Kirk Douglas who made many more movies in his career with none even approaching the sheer brilliance of this stand out performance in my view.
519;It is one of the great imponderables.
520;Spartacus stands alone not only for Douglas but for the brilliant casting which brought together for the first and probably only time in cinema history the trio of Olivier, Ustinov and Laughton.
521;one can only imagine the tensions and creative arguement that ensued with these high profile icons each striving to surpass the others performance.
522;Alex Norths score is as memorable as the acting and stands on its own as a masterpiece which has seldom if ever been surpassed.
523;Crows performance was undoubtedly enhanced by the digital aspects of that movie whereas Douglas's Spartacus is more pristine if one can use such an anology.
524;All in all a masterpiece for many reasons apart from Douglas.
525;"in the best role of his career,a slave who would rather ""Die free."

531;This is your son, Spartacus.
532;so I could experience it for the first time again!
533;Spartacus moved me off my seat and brought every emotion the the surface.
534;now that's what a powerful motion picture should do!
535;One of Hollywood's greatest historical epics, SPARTACUS is easily in the all.

537;douglas's acting is, as usual, both rife with tight.

539;truly stellar performances are turned in by Tony Curtis (as Antoninus, the slave.

542;classic scenes include the recently.
543;fashioned virtues, celebrates the human spirit, and is a paean to freedom, as an intellectual's epic.
544;the extras disc is loaded with goodies, but the best thing about SPARTACUS is simply losing oneself to the power of this amazingly well.
545;I knew a bit about Spartacus and his slave revolt but this movie took it to a whole new level.
546;The production itself was fantastic and I thank the people who worked to hard to restore it.
547;The story and the great actors bring the movie up to today's level of life.
548;"The old saying that ""history repeats itself"" is certainly expressed in this moving story."
549;I urge everyone to see Spartacus, study it, and enjoy the fantastic acting and story.
550;It looks like you are watching something recorded with a video camera played back in a VHS tape.
551;Spartacus is a well made epic from the days when Hollywood specialized in Roman epics.
552;The musical score is adequate.
553;The epic battle scene is truely impressive and features thousands of extras.
554;overall, a well made Roman epic.
555;overall, a very entertaining film with good action sequences and fine acting on the whole.
556;The colors are mostly superior on the Blu, and so is contrast and focus.
557;The image is NEVER really crisp, even in close.
558;"If properly mastered, ""Spartacus"" should display the same wonderful image."
559;I hate to say this, but the Blu is some kind of improvement after all.
560;I will be patiently waiting for a new Blu.
561;ray transfer, hopefully supervised by the good people at Criterion.
562;I live in Europe, and we often get new releases a week or two ahead of the US street dates.
563;Spartacus is a wonderful, bigger than life film, about a slave who led a revolt against the Roman Empire.
564;Directed by Stanley Kubrick in a most unKubrickesque way, it is an epic about a struggle for freedom against great odds.
565;It is a film that explores many themes, such as, love, power, freedom, hate, sexuality, political intrigue, loyalty, and friendship.
566;this is, first and foremost, the story of Spartacus, a slave and the son of a slave, a man who never knew freedom, until one day he was mad as hell and not going to take it any more.
567;Kirk Douglas stars in the title role and plays Spartacus with manly fortitude, yet, at the same, with great tenderness, as demonstrated in his dealings with his friends and his wife, coolly played by the beautiful Jean Simmons.
568;The slave trader, unctuously and obsequiously played by Peter Ustinov, who does a star turn with an often funny and drolly turned phrase and gives a wonderful performance, places Spartacus in his gladiator school, where he is trained to fight.
569;There, he meets the woman of his dreams and future wife.
570;Treated like an animal, he finds succor in his tender love for the woman who would soon be his wife.
571;what happens, as the story unfolds, will keep the viewer riveted to the screen.
572;The entire cast is magnificent and the ending is stunning and moving.
573;"Real actors, with actual props and real ""extras"" on location."
574;The grandeur, the locations, the sheer magnitude of filming this epic is breathtaking.
575;Funny how your appreciation matures as you grow older.
576;it's a ROMAN epic, not a BIBLICAL one.
577;"credit for ""Spartacus"" must rightfully be given to Kirk Douglas himself, who produced it and assembled the fine cast."
578;No, it's simply one of the best epics ever produced.
579;"hur"" is an excellent movie, but there is no character in the film."
580;Spartacus boasts a bevy of tour de force performances: Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Jeanne Simmons, Peter Ustinov, Charles Laughton.
581;Ustinov delivers an Academy Award.
582;winning performance as he panders to whatever Roman higher up he's presented with.
583;For me, it's a sheer joy to watch Laughton's self satisfied work, whether he's living it up in his home among all his women slaves with Ustinov or attacking Olivier on the floor of the Roman Senate.
584;Olivier gives the most multilayered performance, as you'd expect he would.
585;the three performances up top are the best in the movie, but Jeanne Simmons imbues her character with dignity and of course Kirk Douglas has more than his share of charisma as Spartacus himself.
586;Spartacus is a long movie, but believe me, one that flows so beautifully that you're unaware of the time.
587;Really one of the finest ever put out.
588;The Spartacus character was a real life, historical figure, and we are hearing about the real, poignant struggles of an abused group.
589;kirk Douglas shines as the main character.
590;on one hand the movie does a great job of showing the epic scope of the conflict.
591;There are a wide range of slaves escaping .
592;still, there is great cinematography of the Italian landscapes, and intriguing dialogue that explores the world the nobles inhabited and how much it differed from the world of the slaves and gladiators.
593;There were many epics made throughout the history of movies, but this one stands out for its fine acting, its powerful story, and the ending scene where the slaves show their true moral character.
594;This great film is as good as anything released today.
595;The picture quaility is very good.
596;This was Spartacus' best time to rebel because most of the legions were with Pompey fighting a revolt in Spain.
597;She is sold to Crassus and is taken to Rome.
598;After escaping with his band of slaves Spartacus is reunited with his love Varinia and they have a son together.
599;the last stand between Spartacus' Army and General Licinius Crassus was magnificent.
600;The winner is ordered to be crucified.
601;Gracchus sets Varinia free along with her child by Spartacus.
602;"She shows Spartacus the child and tells him ""He is free Spartacus!"
603;This movie was really fabulous!
604;It had a great plot and a great cast of actors.
605;The color was vivid and crisp.
606;I had to turn up the volume a few times but the movie is worth the money!
607;Spartacus with Kirk Douglas is still the original classic and a fantastic story that will never be forgotten by movie lovers.
608;it is a very good movie and it keeps your attention watching all of it.
609;Spartacus is, at its heart, a film born out of conflict between its star, Kirk Douglas, and its director, Stanley Kubrick.
610;kubrick was brought onto the picture by Douglas after the actor fired director Anthony Mann.
611;well, what a classic confrontation, right?
612;Actor wants to play a purely heroic character, while director wants to complicate things a bit more.
613;The moviegoing public's view of film heroes, it could be argued, was much closer to Douglas' simple take than it was to Kubrick's richer, more complex stance.
614;in the end, though, Douglas and Kubrick created a brilliant film.
615;the scenery, the cinematography, the absolute grandeur and spectacle of it all.
616;The film featured a cast of more than 10,000, including 8,000 real soldiers.
617;all delivered the goods in this one.
618;partly because of its running length, this is not a film I watch as often as some Kubrick movies in my collection .
619;yet I always end up enjoying it, especially the genuinely moving final scene.
620;It easily trumps the other similar films that came out of Hollywood at the time.
621;But with a fine script, dramatic scenes of seemingly epic proportions, and Kubrick's able direction, the movie easily stands as one of the best on all accounts.
622;The story of a lowly slave fighting for his freedom is a metaphor for the little guy in every civilization who struggles to find his place in the sun, and continues to be relevant today what with the ever.
623;Overall, it's a top notch flick with enough drama and action to satisfy even the most modern, jaded taste.
624;One of the best movies of all times.
625;it's a good movie and a must know for any american.
626;but kirk is good and kubrick does well for this epic.
627;watch as a lesson on the american spirit, not as a great work of art.
628;"Stanley Kubrick did a fantastic job in bringing the ""Man"" to the big screen, though."
629;By reading history on this man, you will find an intelligent and devious schemer, who preyed on all those around him.
630;The film is bursting with first.
631;rate talent, and it shows (it won four Academy Awards).
632;I Just love Kirk Douglas movies
633;spartacus was born a slave, we are told in the prologue, but dreamed of the end of slavery.
634;The Rome of the day is brought to brilliant life by several superlative supporting performances.
635;Charles Laughton is truly impressive as Gracchus .
636;a Senator who is both idealistic and realistic.
637;Peter Ustinov received a supporting actor Oscar for Batiatus .
638;Lawrence Olivier is astonishing and dominates all of his scenes as Senator/General Crassus, who is more ambitious than any of them, but is also keenly aware that he can't LOOK ambitious in his drive to rule Rome.
639;"crassus, interestingly enough, ""swings both ways"", which is brought out in a scene where he is being bathed by his new slave Antoninus, played by Tony Curtis."
640;He leads Antoninus along a verbal discussion about variety of taste .
641;there are some wonderful scenes.
642;The scene where she is brought to his cell is poignant as Spartacus tells her that he has never had a woman, but he yells at the watching guards that he will not just have sex with this woman so that they can watch at their pleasure.
643;Spartacus concisely depicts courage and conviction and honor .
644;balanced and entertaining, the three.
645;Spartacus has its high points, of course.
646;As befits a 1960 epic with a budget of $12 million, colossal for the time, and a cast of over 10,000, the battle and crowd scenes are pretty spectacular, and the sets and costumes are impressive.
647;Some of the great names in mid.
648;century British acting (Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, Jean Simmons) are enjoyable to watch.
649;in all, not a horrible movie, but far from a great one.
650;Entertaining film, well worth the time.
651;But again a fun film and a classic.
652;"important ""absolute control"" and it is the better for it."
653;While this might sound like a recipe for disaster, the wonderful script somehow gives this movie coherence.
654;it cannot be said that this film is particularly historically accurate, but then again the purpose of art is to create something beautiful out of the fragments of a flawed reality, and this is certainly achieved here.
655;Artistic truth can trump historical truth sometimes, if the artistic truth has something important to say about the human condition.
656;if there is anything modern directors can learn from these old epics is how important it is to wrap the plot up in a way that does justice to the scale of the film.
657;It is the mother of all endings, an unrelenting tear jerker that manipulates you as hard as possible, and that is a very good thing in this case, for if this ending were not there, the whole movie that had gone before would have been cheapened.
658;punching scene (you will know what I mean) works, because it shows how powerless both Spartacus and Crassus are in a way.
659;i also find the self.
660;And maybe that's a good thing, because some things cannot be improved upon.
661;I loved this movie when I was a kid.
662;Kubrick's direction and the cinematography were masterful, but Douglas seemed to be overacting.
663;After all, the Romans ran an effective and tight ship, and slaves should have known their place.
664;This is one of my personal favorite movies.
665;"In the ""swords and sandals"" genre I think it is among the finest ."
666;it has a stirring story, a wonderful sense of scope, a great soundtrack, and a set of truly exceptional performances, including screen greats such as Laurence Olivier, Peter Ustinov, and Kirk Douglas.
667;Although it doesn't display the sort of technical mastery that Kubrick would assert on his later films, there is still a certain Kubrickian something to the direction, as well.
668;Certain camera moves, certain lingering shots, certain compositions.
669;"All told, it's a great movie and a great representation of the 1950.60s ""epic"" motion picture tradition."
670;plus hours, it always remains brisk and entertaining, and it's a movie I frequently revisit because of its richness and replay value.
671;You should be able to note that several of the comparison shots show that mid.
672;But fine details such as film grain are gone.
673;"The most revealing comparison is the shot of Douglas being painted to show ""kill zones"" by his instructor."
674;there is practically a double image made of edge enhancement halos.
675;the audio is quite nice.
676;The DTS soundtrack presents the booming music score quite well, and the voice acting always comes through well.
677;But we do get deleted scenes, some classic interviews and newsreels, some behind the scenes footage, and a trailer.
678;The movie is undeniably great.
679;Those who enjoy historical epics will find a lot to love.
680;"Spartacus (1960) is a great film recreating the last of the ""Servile Revolts"" that occurred in Ancient Rome."
681;"Disregarding these ""historical licenses"", the factions are accurate."
682;"the gladiators' school and its daily life are very well reconstructed (by the way if you are interested in the subject read ""The Gladiator."
683;the battle scenes are very good and remain unsurpassed until very recently, when new techniques are available to the cinema industry.
684;The evolutions of the Roman Legions on the terrain are historically accurate.
685;"a great film from ""Hollywood Golden Age"" winner of several Oscars."
686;Very commendable for Epic Film lovers.
687;Kirk Douglas (and his teeth) star in this true story about Spartacus.
688;Co. starring the lovely Jean Simmons as his wife.
689;If you like Braveheart Gladiator, you'll love this movie
690;Peter Ustinov(won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his work here), Charles Laughton(should have been similarly nominated) Laurence Olivier all do incredible work under the guidance of a very young Kubrick all deliver what comes very close to their best work.
691;It is worth noting( you'll learn this from the wonderfully insightful 1992 Ustinov interview[his impersonation of Laughton is a riot]contained in the bonus material)that Ustinov rewrote all the scenes he plays with Laughton.
692;It should come as no surprise to the discerning viewer, they are easily the best moments in the film.
693;The story draws you in right away, and I found myself cheering for Spartacus the rest of the way.
694;This is a story of many loves, and Kirk Douglas managed to bring it all to the screen.
695;Kubrick disavowed this film, and rightfully so, as he came on board after the film had already started.
696;this is a tale of a fight for freedom, and one that, although Spartacus is defeated, he lives on through his family.
697;As he states to Crasssus, Antoninus and the others will be back, and they'll be millions.
698;the casting for this film was perfect, and each and every one of them shine.
699;I thoroughly enjoyed this film and have since I was a wee lad.
700;It is an old fashioned epic but unlike many that were featured during this era it eskews Christian themes or Biblical main characters and instead provides a figure from the waning days of the Roman Republic.
701;the cast is for the most part great:Kirk Douglas as our main character does a fine job I feel.
702;He brings a physical intensity to the role that is entirely convincing and I find his scenes with Jean Simmons feel authentic and moving.
703;In the movie throughout he walks a continual line between acting and overacting, with every line punctuated by a dramatic pause or a rapid turn of the head.
704;He is fine actor no doubt, but I don't find this to be one of his best performances.
705;peter Ustinov and Charles Loughton are the complete opposite and an absolute delight throughout.
706;jean Simmons is great given what little she has to do.
707;As many have noted, she and Douglas have great chemistry and she provides a real sense of pathos in her bearing and the use of her eyes (at least she did for me).
708;the rest of the cast are fine for the most part, aside from what many have noted in the woeful miscasting of Anthony Curtis.
709;But the rest are fine with a special mention for a wonderfully evil Charles McGraw as Marcellus.
710;The slave revolt is going successfully and social change is seen developing among the survivors of the gladiatorial training school where it originated as they make the journey to escape from Roman territory.
711;Spartacus, an untutored man born into slavery, displays a native intelligence and morality missing from the more sophisticated and educated antagonists in the Roman Senate and Legions.
712;The hope for freedom and happiness ends in the defeat of the army created of former gladiators and slaves, but the familial line and spirit of Spartacus' survives in the person of his mate and their baby son.
713;This movie has many good actors in it.
714;It was well made move.
715;It was a great story but i thought it was too gory.
716;And another cool part about the movie is that it is based on a true story.
717;Kubrick's Spartacus is one of many epic movies of its time.
718;Spartacus is a slave among many slaves.
719;Enslaved around the young age of 13, this life in chains is about all he knows.
720;Kubrick did a good job at making the movie at all, especially at such a young age.
721;"Having enjoyed movies like ""Alexander"" and ""Troy,"" I thought I would go back and check out some other ancient epics."
722;I thought it was a spectacular movie.
723;"I felt there were some similarities to ""Gladiator"", but for me this was a superior movie."
724;It features a great cast led by Kirk Douglas.
725;It is also one of the first movies that Stanley Kubrick directed (before he adopted his own unique style of moviemaking).
726;A long, but satisfying movie watching experience.
727;The transfer of the Criterion edition is sharp and there are some interesting bonus features to go along with it, including a 1992 interview with Peter Ustinov.
728;this espectacular film make me feel that this was a golden age of movie, good restoration , recommended , worth it!
729;Can't wait to see it!
730;Another highly recommended movie, we wanted to add this to our collection to have on hand for anythime waching.
731;This is the best Kubrick film by far.
732;a masterpiece released in 1960, a product of the American cultural high and brilliant in all aspects.
733;Truly stunning and full of meaning.
734;Kirk Douglas is brilliant, as is Jean Simmons, Ustinov and etc.
735;The musical score is great.
736;It remains an extremely vivid experience.
737;I am 22 years old and I love this film.
738;This is by far one great movie.
739;I think one of his best.
740;It is one that I had thought about a lot and hoped that one day I could see it again.
741;The best way to watch this movie is without commercial interruption and now I can do that.
742;And as for Jean Simmons to me she is one of the most beautiful and talented female performers to ever grace the big screen.
743;She is an awesome actress with the presence of Hollywood royalty.
744;This is a must have and it is one great for the whole family.
745;it is a story about the quest to be free and the price that one is willing to pay for that freedom.
746;And of how the love for that one special woman can transform one man and bring him from a state of futility and despair to the point of being invincible.
747;I highly recommend this movie.
748;This was movie making at it's finest.
749;I have always loved this movie!
750;Clearly the story of spartacus is one of the greatest ever told.
751;Heartbreaking and inspiring, it is indeed worth of the cinematic doting that it has received.
752;The 1960 version had scenes with painted backgrounds and sets that were obviously stages.
753;europe 2004 sequel benefited from far more realistic sets and scenery.
754;aCTINGThe 1960 version benefitted from the thespian talents of some of the finest actors on the era.
755;The acting in the old one was superb, however, the acting in the remake was just as excellent and probably on a par with the old one in many respects.
756;For example there was a beautiful scene in the 2004 film in which the newly.
757;the 1960 verion had better dialogue with regard to the senatorial debates, with Olivier clearly masterful in his role as Crassus.
758;lOVE STORYThe relationship between Spartacus and Virminia was beautiful told in both versions, but the newer version better developed that union.
759;The superior 2004 version benefits from numerous advances in the art of filmaking since the 1960 version was released.
760;Both scripts were excellent, with a very slight edge given to the 1960 version.
761;This is a great movie which even today stands the test against time.
762;While it isn't quite up to par with Gladiator, it does hold its own as a classic tale of the rebellious slave gladiator who stands against the Roman Empire.
763;I recomend this movie to most, but watch this first before you watch Gladiator.
764;I bought them from Borders, and they were very good about the returns.
765;I ordered it so I could review for bonus points it for a class I'm taking.
766;This is another great classic movie I had to have on Blu.
767;The vendor had it priced right and it shipped right out.
768;This motion picture is a must for all Gladiator Epic lovers.
769;The movie showcases the Great Kirk Douglas in his most memorable performance.
770;The cinematography is spectacular and verY authentic for its time.
771;After all these years, the color is vivid and true to form.
772;A very young Tony Curtis appears with a great cast.
773;You will love the feel for the movie and the sets are very opulent.
774;That is a sure sign that this movie has gotton better with age.
775;Pick it up today and enjoy!!!
776;The extras met all expectations,
777;True that Spartacus has a more complicated plot, but Spartacus was a real character and the story of his rebellion and its suppression is closely interwoven with intricate plotting among the senators of Rome.
778;What we do in life, echoes in eternity!
779;That being said, the movie is so good it's easy to look past that.
780;The musical score by North is interesting as well in that North was also an ardent communist who studied music in the USSR.
781;Spartacus is a man ahead of his time.
782;The book making him a son of Thracian slaves is pure fiction.
783;Despite the flawed rendition of the character, Kirk Douglas delivers a powerful performance as a man of conviction determined to win the freedom of his followers.
784;as for Crassus, Laurence Olivier delivers a fabulous performance with what he has.
785;another great performance is by Peter Ustinov who plays the lanista.
786;With his own script, as with Olivier, Ustinov presents a great character who has all the nuances of a Roman merchant seeking to advance his interests in any given situation.
787;Credit is also due to McGraw who plays the sadistic trainer Marcellus.
788;Excellent script and a great performance.
789;Charles Laughton as Graccus is also a great performance as the populist senator seeking to undermine Crassus' plans at any cost.
790;all in all, what makes this film good are the powerful performances of the lead actors in the film.
791;the acting was also carried by Kubrick's direction of what amounted to be the most important scenes of the film.
792;Despite being a mess of a film with a strong socialist message arising from the civil rights era, this is still a classic to be enjoyed.
793;Spartacus produced by Kird Douglas and released em 1960, is the best movie of all time, or among the 5 bests.
794;"great epic, superb cast, beautiful soundtrack, it ""inspired"" ""Gladiator"" (2000) and many other movies."
795;In blu ray it looks, certainly, more beautiful, more brilliant, more spetacular.
796;In my opinion, Spartacus is one of the best epic films that has ever been made.
797;I was also pleased with the non.
798;If you enjoy action movies or older history movies I highly recommend Spartacus.
799;Kirk Douglass performance as Spartacus is incredible.
800;kirk douglas was impressive as the first spartacus.
801;A true classic, great acting, great cinematography, everyone should watch this movie
802;Doesn't really follow the true story, but still a great classic.
803;A great movie, great actors.
804;I grew up with this movie and it will always have a place in my heart.
805;I have found,though, that as I have gotten older, the characters of the freedom.
806;"The slaves are too ""good"" to ring true, while the Romans seem more rounded out characters."
807;Would that Kubrick could have directed the film with his own vision!And I thoroughly loved the Peter Ustinov interviews.
808;"The '92 interview was so funny (expecially Peter's ""impressions""), yet informative and the '60 interview was off the wall as well."
809;Better than Gladiator, though maybe less accurate.
810;This is just one of the best films ever made .
811;directed by Stanley Kubrick, great performances by an A. list of actors from Kirk Douglas to Laurence Olivier.
812;Kirk Douglas produced a masterpiece of filmmaking in Spartacus.
813;"He hired the little known (at the time) Stanley Kubrick to direct the best of Kubrick's films
814;The human story of Spartacus is balanced perfectly with the spectacle of rebellion and the fight for freedom.
815;Dalton Trumbo's script is brilliant, as were the performances.
816;The love story between Kirk and Jean was as moving and lovely as any love story ever filmed, and the father.
817;like relationship of Douglas with the boyish and son.
818;like Tony Curtis was touching and equally moving.
819;Spartacus should have swept all the movie awards the year it was released.
820;She loved it and used it often.
821;As per my mother, it is great.
822;Spartacus may well be the best film Stanley Kubrick directed (A Clockwork Orange would vie for the title).
823;The film is a marvel to look at as Mr. Kubrick creates early Roman countrysides, arenas and buildings with exacting detail.
824;Kirk Douglas is perfectly cast in the title role as he perfectly blends the action demands of the role with the dramatic side.
825;The fighting scenes are well staged and the ending where all the slaves claim to be Spartacus is still moving.
826;the restoration is indeed terrific, and the widescreen presentation does give the film a certain cinematic sheen that makes it seem *somewhat* less like a high.
827;b.""""However, there are two good performances: Olivier does great work, as always, and so does Charles Laughton."""
828;in fact, i passionately recommend everything else by Kubrick.
829;But when a director disowns a film it's generally for good reason, and that's certainly true in this case.
830;com had this video, and the price was excellent!
831;Kirk Douglas has written an autobiography talking about making Spartacus that throws some interesting light on the movie.
832;If you liked the movie you'll like the book.
833;Kirk Douglas performed the role of his lifetime as Spartacus, the slave who rebelled against the mighty Roman Empire to win his freedom.
834;The music, the scenery, the music and the overall lush cinematography make this akin to the great epics popular in the day .
835;Spartacus is based on the true, historic account of the slave who desired the freedom of other slaves.
836;jean Simmons plays Lavignia, his love interest, and the woman who bears his child, who is born free.
837;The corrupt Roman Empire has always been a favorite of literature and films, and in this film, the moral decay is well expressed.
838;In contrast, the slaves are a good hearted group, young, old, men and wome, with good hearts and with a yearning for freedom.
839;everyone knows the Roman armies were very strong and powerful.
840;"But the greatest moment in the film comes when Spartacus is not found among the captives and every slave declares ""I am Spartacus!"""
841;Such loyalty and courage is foreign to even the Romans.
842;Spartacus is crucified, his wife is set free and his son is born free.
843;The music is beautiful, the costumes are rich, and the dialogue, although poetic, is realistic.
844;Although this film is very long, it is a good way to glimpse the Roman Empire.
845;It is also very much like the recent film Gladiator in a sense.
846;ray of a major film that I have ever seen.
847;I really couldnt' enjoy it.
848;"(Ernest Gold won the Academy Award trophy that year for his magnificent musical score backing up 'Exodus')High drama is the key to understanding the director's purpose in allowing the music to the forefront
849;Kubrick's style takes us into a world of dynamic symmetry, where visual moments of stunning grace and sublime verdure are balanced with equal moments, painful shards made of agony and ecstasy.
850;Certainly Kurosawa and Bergman allow moments of visual beauty to serve as stately vehicles for their messages, with Kubrick, and this is a very essential nature of his film making, the bejeweled nature of the finished moment propels us to a mythical discovery of human nature.
851;To make this stunningly clear, Kubrick always chooses and tells stories that allow him to work skillfully with these tools of cinematography, script and musical score"
852;The cinematographic skills of Metty teamed with Kubrick's sense of the immanent, transitory nature of heroic life make Spartacus the great masterpiece that it is.
853;Backing it all up are North's masterful musical interludes, which in their symphonic proportions, match Kubrick's goals flawlessly.
854;Finally to conclude, we have three elements, pictorial or visual, verbal, and musical all tied together with Kubrick's magisterial and sympathetic look at the human condition.1.
855;The cinematographer always keeps us placed in an epic world where grandeur and majesty are in view.
856;"Both music and script are but handmaidens to the art of making a film, this is especially true here
857;An interesting task for another viewing of the film would be to try to decide where Kubrick's influence begins and where that of Douglas' mannerism takes over.
858;The storyline, musical score, acting, and sets in this epic Roman saga are fantastic.
859;The depiction of Roman society and values, the political intrigue of Rome itself, and the way they viewed slavery all combine to make this movie extremely insightfull.
860;So if what you are looking for is an action packed blockbuster with breathtaking special effects and digitally created wonders, watch Gladiator.
861;If you are willing to accept the dearth of good battles normally associated with epics of this kind in exchange for its other more subtle aspects then I would highly recommend this movie.
862;Beautiful Jean Simmons and comic relief from Peter Ustinuv.
863;I found it to be impeccable"
864;As so many others have said, this picture is truly timeless.
865;Without any real nudity, Douglas and Simmons are perfect lovers.
866;"Amid the fighting and politics all working together to keep the tension high in this film, these two people progress from being strangers into ""man and wife"" in a way that viewers feel and experience."
867;dimensional characters in this film.
868;As far as story lines are concerned, every major historical figure and event has received the glamorized treatment.
869;so, we come to Spartacus, the film at hand.
870;this is just one good entertainment featuring vivid performances from not only the stars but the featured actors as well.
871;Kirk Douglas is his usually chiseled face best as the slave who leads a revolt against the Roman establishment.
872;Laurence Olivier brings his Shakespearean skills in the majestic role of Crassus, and Charles Laughton soars as Graccus, Crassus's chief nememis in the Roman Senate.
873;winning role, nearly steals the show, but there are other fine performances also.
874;Charles McGraw is menacingly effective as Marcellus, chief instructor at the school for gladiators.
875;Every inch of the film is a feast to behold.
876;Alex North's score is one of filmdom's best.
877;stanley Kubrick brings it all together with his usual stunning direction.
878;The movie itself is 5 stars, the print is terrific, and there are loads of great extras.
879;The price is really high though.
880;There are a few graphic scenes in it that were very realistic, this is kind of rare for 1960.
881;On an even better note, The Criterion Collection's release of this film is great, containing much more than the original Universal release.
882;This is definately in my top 25 of all time.
883;why is it the greatest movie ever made?
884;Ustinov is superb in his role!
885;Simmons and Douglas have some real chemistry4.
886;I have tears right now just writing about it.
887;A wonderful mix of sadness and glory.
888;How this film did not even get nominated for Best Picture of 1960 is absolutely astounding.
889;It wins hands down!See this film!!!
890;This is one of the most magnificent movies ever made, and a must see for anyone who craves and honors freedom!
891;If I was ever blessed to make a movie, this is the one I would want a chance to make.
892;What they cannot offer are the timeless performances of characters you care about .
893;Top that off with direction by Stanley Kubrick, and you have a classic by any standards.
894;Based on when it was produced, the film cannot take advantage of the newer high definition audio formats, but the Dolby Digital is very good.
895;If this is a film genre you enjoy, it is a must for your film collection.
896;ray, and one of the greatest movies of all time!
897;A childhood favorite that I never get tired of watching!
898;Spartacus was one of the epic sword and sandal movies that included Ben Hur and others.
899;It may well be one of the best of them.
900;With a cast that includes Peter Ustinov, Olivier and Tony Curtis as directed by Kubrick, it is very watchable even by today's standards.
901;it is a 3 hour commitment that is well worth it even if there are a few instances of cringe worthy corniness baked in.
902;"I admire this film for its great ""cast of thousands"" battle scenes, the grandeur of Rome, and the realism of the gladiator training camp."
903;A good old movie to reminisce about.
904;The ambitious Roman general, Crassus (Lawrence Oliver) has other plans for them and he leads his legions against them.
905;kirk Douglas is perfectly cast for the role.
906;All the acting is marvelous.
907;Based upon a true story, the film is done to perfection.
908;i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes ancient history as well as action adventure films.
909;It is a timeless story against the oppression of slavery.
910;Great movie, enough said about that.
911;Widely acclaimed for his serious ambitions and his uncompromising perfectionism, Stanley Kubrick has won for himself a unique degree of artistic freedom.
912;based on a true story of a slave revolt in 73 B. c., Dalton Trumbo's script mixes the melodrama with some quite moving moments.
913;What emerges from the screen was a passionate statement on behalf of freedom and men who were willing to die to overthrow oppressive governments.
914;kirk Douglas plays Spartacus the idealistic noble slave who believes he must struggle forever against tyranny and just by opposing tyranny he inspires his followers with his example.
915;"the first hour of ""Spartacus"" contains many of the film's best moments : The operation of the gladiatorial school and its training program is impressive and also expressive."
916;The men are oiled, bathed, shaved, massaged and trained to fight.
917;For their good performances, they are even rewarded with the companionship of a young lady.
918;the scene summarizes the injustice of the situation, the cruelty of bondage and the insurrection becomes a triumph easy to understand.
919;nominated for six Academy Awards, and winning for Cinematography, Costume Design, Art Direction and Supporting Actor.
920;"with a stirring musical score by Oscar nominee Alex North, ""Spartacus,"" masterfully directed by Kubrick, is too sentimental, but beautiful, wonderfully erotic and surprisingly moving."
921;Spartacus is one of Stanley Kubrick's best movies.
922;It could have had more action scenes but overall it's epic and really good.
923;Some scenes from this movie are really powerful.
924;Wonderfully acted, Spartacus is a love story and battle for freedom set against the backdrop of Roman times.
925;This intelligent, sweeping (is there any other kind?)
926;"disc II includes rare, deleted scenes, vintage newsreel footage, 1960 promotional interviews with Jean Simmons and Ustinov, original storyboards by Bass, the 1960 documentary ""The Hollywood Ten,"" plus archival documents about the blacklist, sktches by Kubrick, hundreds of production stills and more!"
927;It still reverberates with our contemporary sensibilities as it blends politics, violence and sexual suggestion.
928;Spartacus was the first Hollywood film to openly defy the blacklist and is a fitting universal metaphor for freedom and sacrifice.
929;And a lasting tribute to Kubrick's genius.
930;this Roman epic, directed with care and detail by Kubrick, packs a powerful emotional wallop, and will linger in your heart and mind for a long time after you enter its world.
931;The recreation of time and place is so real you can smell it, and the performances are uniformly superb and heart.
932;The musical score sweeps you away.
933;I love this movie for all of its daring, its powerful message and its human spirit.
934;Kirk Douglas' portrayal of the gladiator slave in this 1960 epic is a far more sympathetic character than that of the recent TV serial.
935;laurence Olivier's Crassus and Miss Simmonds Wife are the performances that linger longest.
936;Criterion can always be trusted to do a good job.
937;It makes a great day in to watch the film a sample all the extras as well.
938;A pleasure, and long live to Kubrick's work and memory
939;"his most important work being ""Paths of Glory"" that he made with Douglas as the lead ."
940;class talent , but it remains an incredible example of what can be accomplished with film .
941;It is always good to know our history and where we come from.
942;It was heartfelt in that is showed all of the emotions in a good light and taught me something about what came before my Christian heritage.
943;i understand the limitations of an older film, but when a new film comes out in Blue Ray it should be spectacular.
944;I thought the color was inconsistant, and most times over saturated.
945;"Someone mentioned ""The Music Man"" as a good example of Blu Ray restoration."
946;That film is now pristine in every way.
947;i hope Criterion or someone does a beter job.
948;This is a great movie and i was looking forward to watching it.
949;I have to put on the subtitles to be able to know what is being said, but never the less i still loved the movie.
950;The Criterion version, restored in the early 1990s, is beautifully filmed by Stanley Kubrick and cinematographer Russell Metty, superbly acted by a strong ensemble, and magnificently written by the then.
951;The spectacle is thrilling and Ustinov and Laughton, particularly, bring the wit of Trumbo's script wonderfully to the fore, but the heart of this film is in its suggestion of what one might hope for regarding a moral society and integrity in leadership.
952;The first third establishes the humble, courageous and inspiring character of Spartacus, provides the basis for the tender attraction between Spartacus and Varinia and illustrates the nature of the relationship of those who rule and own others, and those whose typical only recourse is to fawn, and serve, and hopefully, survive.
953;the second portion of the film is comparatively the weakest, nicely establishing political and power relationships in Rome and allowing Laughton and Olivier to illustrate also the decadence and corruption of Rome near the end of the republic.
954;the last third of Spartacus is cinema of a very high order.
955;The determination shown on the faces of the families, young and old, weak or strong, to fight for a destiny of freedom, to demand dignity and a respect for their humanity, is inspiring.
956;Olivier and Trumbo work magically in this final third, as Crassus strives in both word and deed to find the true power, the love of others freely given, that Spartacus possesses, and he conspicuously lacks.
957;It suggests further that the babies of Spartacus and others, born free and striving always to live free, will be the hope of civilizations and eras to come.
958;this is a film with timeless insights regarding the indomitable nature of the human quest for dignity and freedom and of the authentic sources of leadership and social power.
959;It's pictorial beauty, it's gracious and moving script and the work of the director and the players to convey its message are great cinematic art.
960;so in the end, a good classic epic.
961;It simply is a great and moving historical epic which while it isn't totally historically accurate, is much closer to genuine history than Hollywood usually manages to do.
962;The production and acting in this film are almost uniformly superb.
963;Kirk Douglas is at his best as Spartacus while Lawrence Olivier is brilliant as the Roman dictator Crassus.
964;Jean Simmons does an excellent job as Varinia particularly in the final part of the film.
965;In general though the spectacle and authenticity of the scenery are both very convincing.
966;the final part of the film culminating in the escape of Varinia is very moving and this is a tribute to the great acting throughout and a well written script.
967;Finally, Alex North's music score is superb and has a real pagan sound to it.
968;i'm giving the film four stars instead of five because of the occasional script hiccups but it is a great movie which I continue to thoroughly recommend.
969;I would also recommend the 2004 remake which I think is equally good and more historically accurate.
970;"May his sacrifice and memory forever live on throughout the ages!In this classic version of ""Spartacus"", one of the most captivating scenes is that of the ever memorable battle scenes featuring the Roman legions."
971;This is one classic movie that was able to properly feature those formations from a scenic angle!
972;rest in peace, Spartacus!Recommended viewing:Spartacus: Blood and Sand .
973;ray]Spartacus: Blood and Sand .
974;The only saving grace of this film is the actors, all big stars and for good reason.
975;Peter Ustinov also stars here, throwing out comedic lines alongside Charles Laughton.
976;Interesting idea to cast British actors as the Romans and American actors as the slaves.
977;It's a good film, in the classic sense, but not exactly to my taste.
978;and he actually seems to pretty much dislike most of the movie.
979;All the other guys are pretty complimentary about the other actors, and the photography, and the stunts, and at most may dish a little dirt about things like how Charles Laughton and Laurence Olivier disliked each other intensely.
980;It's kind of refreshing and fun in a perverse way to listen to someone who really did not like much of anything about the movie version of his book (except for the gladiator scene between Douglas and Woody Strode, and even there he found fault with the weaponry) explain what he hates about so many scenes .
981;Unless your an anal audio/videophile this movie is the best it has ever looked and sounded since it's release 50 years ago.
982;I am sure this restoration was great in 1991, but in the intervening years film restoration technology has greatly improved and this film could use another pass.
983;it's amazing that after 40 years this film still generates revenue for Universal.
984;warner Bros. understands this better I think.
985;And films like 'Gladiator' will copy it again and again.
986;though it lets thousands of extras have there moment of glory)But see this one for Olivier, Ustinov, and Laughton who are amusing to say the least.
987;This is one of the last great epics, with superb acting by Douglas, Simmons, Ustinov, Olivier.
988;Great cinematography, great costumes and music, great stunts.
989;wonderful but sad love story.
990;I enjoyed Spartacus when I was younger, and this brought all the great memories back .
991;A great movie that followed history very well.
992;A well told story and some great special features as well.
993;I highly recommend it for everyone
994;"A young director named Stanley Kubrick had made a brilliant movie about military justice, ""Paths to Glory"", starring Kirk Douglas in 1958."
995;"In 1960, he directed the classic, ""Spartacus""."
996;Spartacus starred Douglas as a slave of the Roman Empire, depicting his deadly rivalry with the Roman General Crassus (played to perfection by Laurence Olivier).
997;The slaves who rise up against their Roman oppressors are metaphors for the working class, especially minorities, rising up against white oppression.
998;football star Woody Strode, gives his life so Spartacus can live.
999;The fact that he was black was well calculated.
1000;When it came time to edit the film for release, Douglas, a huge star and its producer, made the decision to list Trumbo as the writer.
1001;His power and the film's success combined with this act ended the Blacklist.
1002;Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus is a grim reminder that freedom has always come at a cost.
1003;On one hand, Spartacus is a sweeping epic in the best cinematic fashion .
1004;the story is inspiring and timeless, legendary actors appear in the film, and there is a lushness and grandeur to the images that fill the screen.
1005;In the end, Spartacus is more memorable in the film for the idea he symbolized rather than who he was as a man.
1006;It's too bad more time wasn't spent fleshing out his character since there is genuine chemistry between him and Simmons who is absolutely radiant in her role.
1007;screen troubles are very well documented with star/producer Douglas replacing experienced director Anthony Mann at a relatively early stage of filming with tyro director, Stanley Kubrick.
1008;Troubles, apart, the end product is a masterpiece with a brilliant cast, at least in the major roles, and only one dud in the minor, the underwhelming, John Dall, appearing in his penultimate movie.
1009;This, along with a literate Dalton Trumbo script, a glorious Alex North score that matches the epic nature of the film, and an appropriately nuanced performance by its lead, Douglas, means that, in the sword and sandal epic stakes, nothing, including Ben Hur, can match it.
1010;the supporting plots that involve the power struggle in the Senate are also surprisingly engaging.
1011;With these scenes cut you can probably have a powerful film in a compact 90 minutes.
1012;So this leads me to think its a good thing for Director's to have final cut.
1013;An epic telling of epic historical events.
1014;"One of the great themes of this film is the integrity and bravery of some of the ""lowliest"" slaves reminding us that it is these qualities that make us human and not our station in life."
1015;"The readiness of the rebels in the end to stand up and be counted with the leader is the culmination of that theme
1016;Even with such moving and serious themes, however, the film is sprinkled in places with humor and wit, especially with the slave.
1017;In some ways, I think I prefer the hint rather than the more direct portrayal but it is still done in a tasteful manner to convey the types of abuse that brought about the rebellion.
1018;the gladiator fights and battle scenes are still some of the best ever made.
1019;I still enjoy them even more than the more recent movie of similar genre, """"Gladiator."""
1020;All actors to portray Spartacus since have and will continue to have difficulty living up to the standard set by the gritty yet compassionate Kirk Douglas portrayal.
1021;Kubrick has disowned this film, and I can see why.
1022;It boasts epic battle scenes, sweeping music, and deliciously corrupt Romans that make for an above average movie.
1023;Fantastic classic, everyone should have.
1024;This is the best movie .
1025;The one with Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, etc. is the best.
1026;Was feeling quite nostalgic, and as my girlfriend had never seen this old epic, as I had several times back when, and I decided to pick it up for a watch once again.
1027;this film remains one of the most groundbreaking films of its time.
1028;the film itself is quite impressive for the time it was released.
1029;spartacus is portrayed by Kirk Douglas in the film and looks remarkably like his son Michael Douglas.
1030;there are also numerous interviews and behind the scenes footage.
1031;"This sweeping 1960 ""sword and sandal"" epic is a classic, from the powerful writing and magisterial direction to the subtle acting and sumptuous cinematography (and let us not forget the stirring score by Alex North)."
1032;Disc 2 of the Criterion set is chock.
1033;full of newsreels, documentaries, and interviews with the actors.
1034;Trumbo performed an intricate feat of writing that weaves together a detailed portrait of a slave rebellion in ancient Rome.
1035;The script addresses the political and sexual motivations of its characters, both slave and master, while carefully balancing scenes of grandeur and intimacy.
1036;paced adaptation of the material not only allows the story to arc and its characters to breathe but also gives both large.
1037;scale love scenes an equal weight.
1038;His camerawork is magnificent, particularly in the climactic battle, which utilized more than 8,000 extras.
1039;And just as devils are more interesting than angels, the most enjoyable performances by far are delivered by the Brits, especially Olivier as the tyrant Crassus and Laughton as the republican Gracchus.
1040;realized works of fiction lovingly set in fully.
1041;"realized worlds of their own, rivaling the scope and power of ""Ben."
1042;"hur"" and worthy of treasuring as a peak of Hollywood filmmaking that has only rarely been achieved."
1043;Kirk Douglas is a outstanding actor, anything he play in i want his moives his are the best.,what more can i say.
1044;Twenty years ago, under the aegis of Universal's Tom Pollack, and with the cooperation and support of both Kirk Douglas and Stanley Kubrick, we spent a year reconstructing and restoring Spartacus from extant film elements.
1045;Work was performed virtually on a shot by shot basis.
1046;HTV, which performed meticulous dirt and grain removal on another large format production, Franklin J. Shaffner's brilliant 1970 Academy Award winner Patton, has been brought back to perform similar duties with Mr. Kubrick's Spartacus.
1047;All high frequency information has been lost, and with it all of the detail in the image.
1048;Contrast has been boosted to make the image appear sharper than it is, but this is perceived as opposed to actual sharpness.
1049;He knew where this was going.
1050;I was hopeful that the lessons learned with the Blu.
1051;where Fox and Disney have been releasing gorgeous Blu.
1052;"ray system, while it absolutely damages the concept that is the ""art"" of cinema, and proper representation of the what was created by the filmmakers."
1053;***There will be many people who will love the Blu.
1054;One which replicates the original 6.
1055;aO mix that properly represents the wide proscenium mix for properly spacial dialogue.
1056;here we have an example of great classic cinema.
1057;Written, produced, photographed, edited and scored by some of the finest talent in the industry.
1058;Spartacus is a huge, epic film about the enduring spirit of mankind and the concept of freedom.
1059;a heroic and majestic piece of epic entertainment.
1060;With a simple new image harvest, Spartacus could be a piece of brilliant Blu.
1061;As it is, Spartacus receives an absolute and undeniable.
1062;I enjoy this type of movie very much.
1063;The case was very nice and the movie was great.
1064;I would recommend it to everyone.
1065;kirk douglas gives a great performance as the legendary warrior.
1066;"kirk Douglas plays the title character role and acts the surly, rebellious gladiator very well
1067;The main opposition comes in the form of the fantastic and much missed Laurence Olivier, who plays the ambitious and ruthless Crassus to the hilt, as one would expect from a character actor of his calibre.
1068;Herbert Lom, too, as the pirates' emissary was amusing and convincing.
1069;Even though the story of SPARTACUS takes place in ancient Rome, the film itself is a profoundly contemporary work of the time that it was made"
1070;listed in Hollywood, worked under various pseudonyms during the fifties for films such as ROMAN HOLIDAY, here properly restored to his rightful position of one of the best screenwriter in the business, with his own name credited on screen.
1071;The film embraces humanity, freedom to chose the way he wants to live, the freedom to trust one's friend, even the freedom of sexuality .
1072;spartucus and his lover Varinia are never legally married, but she gives birth to his son., and the freedom and passion to sacrifice oneself for the sake of his pears and the great cause of human freedom.
1073;Democratic politician Charles Laughton, with all the virtues and vices that a regular politician has, taken over and eventually eliminated by seemingly much cleaner military leader Laurence Olivier.
1074;Needless to say, the clashes performed by those two great actors is a great excitment to watch.
1075;"to simply put, SPARTACUS is a fine example of how a good entertaining movie can carry a powerful message
1076;a great lesson to all those who wants to learn how to write a film.
1077;note: the superb package design is a reproduction of the original poser art created by Saul Bass.
1078;One of the great epics of it's time, probably ranking above 'The Vikings' and below 'Ben Hur'.
1079;anyways, speaking specifically of Spartacus now: Olivier and Ustinov give just amazing performances (Ustinov recieved an Oscar), which somehow seems to balance out the somewhat less impressive performances of some of the other main characters.
1080;Let's face it, Douglas never blew anybody's hair back with his acting chops, but as usual he nails the part in his own way, giving us all we really need for the role.
1081;Beside a little bit of the brooklyn accent sneaking in there, Tony does a great job.
1082;Spartacus is that genuine rarity, an epic that successfully combines the intellectual with the emotional, giving it an edge on almost all of its contemporaries .
1083;even Anthony Mann's superb Fall of the Roman Empire, which is never able to fully reconcile the two in its leading characters.
1084;despite this, Spartacus is an incredibly hopeful film.
1085;most unusual within the constraints of the genre is that it makes us feel its concerns rather than just think about them.
1086;, is one of the most intensely moving moments in cinema and carries an emotional charge that Kubrick's work never again attained or even attempted.
1087;Trumbo's script is both intelligent and involving and filled with memorable and beautifully constructed scenes, the cast uniformly excellent, with Olivier giving one of his last great performances before he turned to intermittent silly voices and self.
1088;Even in a strong field that year, it is amazing that North did not win an Oscar for his contribution.You're spoiled for choice with the extras on the Criterion edition, so this is definitely the one to go for.
1089;This was a favorite growing up as a kid.
1090;A big time classic !!
1091;spartacus is an 4 star movie in blueray picture is excellent the sound is excellent a very good movie i am so glade i bought it on amazon very good price.
1092;Kirk Douglas and Peter Ustinov are simply the best.
1093;The Criterion version looks great.
1094;The facelift the film received help return much of its luster.
1095;Kubrick later disowned his version of the epic Hollywood Sword and Sandal genre, but Kubrick brings much of his sensibility to bear"
1096;is it Kubrick's finest film?
1097;As a result, Kubrick manages to reinvent a genre that was in danger of becoming a parody of itself.
1098;As a collaborative effort, Spartacus is a great piece of entertainment and far more sophisticated than almost everything else that came out of Hollywood at the time.
1099;the transfer is beautiful with much of Kubrick's bold use of color restored.
1100;The strong acting of most of the cast has always been a virtue of Sparatcus.
1101;It provides additional understanding about the complexity of making an independently produced project like Spartacus.
1102;Kirk Douglas' bold decision to produce the film himself (with Universal.
1103;international distributing)was a leap of faith in both the material and the talented director.
1104;It's delightful and he shares a number of funny stories about the picture.
1105;There's also a text overview of Kubrick's career and his involvement with the picture.
1106;We also get to glimpse at Saul Bass' wonderful title design sequence.
1107;If you want a spectacular transfer of the film, loads of extras about the making and background of the project from those involved, this is the set to pick up.
1108;A classic gladiator film that still holds up decades later.
1109;Perhaps most endearing is the performance by Jean Simmons.
1110;She is so beautiful and luminous here .
1111;I can see why Spartacus was in love with her!
1112;A great, great film with many superb performances.
1113;Product arrived on time and in good condition.
1114;There are moments when it's visible around dark objects against light backgrounds, and there is a moment when it's plainly visible around Spartacus standing at the front of his tent.
1115;Not surprisingly, the best color and lighting are in studio scenes.
1116;Throughout most of the film, the extreme left and right edges of the frame looked smeared or out of focus.
1117;Though there's a wide and involving stereo image, the basic sound is inferior to the best possible in 1960.
1118;"or even ""North By Northwest"", which has superb sound."
1119;The script is alternately brilliant and hokey, and the film only really comes alive when the non.
1120;american actors are on the screen.
1121;Sir Larry is thoroughly convincing, both when dominating everyone around him and when trying to woo the resistant Lavinia.
1122;The Americans don't fare so well.
1123;though it /is/ fun .
1124;"The film ""Spartacus"" is an epic, justifiably famed and duly honored."
1125;The combination of subject matter, Stanley Kubrick and Kirk Douglas makes for an interesting, dynamic stewpot.
1126;Its place in cinema history is assured.
1127;Of greatest note is the original, full.
1128;length version of the masterpiece, re.
1129;scenes newsreels, interviews, commentaries and pretty much everything one associates with a well.
1130;An epic package for an epic film.
1131;Movie came just like was promised and enjoyed watching it many times.
