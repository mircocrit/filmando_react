1;It has beautiful orchestraded moments that arise and fall like a timeless musical score.
2;the three main performances are each sensational.
3;Everyone already knows, from one was or another, that Nicole Kidman is excellent and won an Oscar for her role.
4;Even though her role was not as showy as Kidman's, Streep delivers probably the best acting in the film.
5;She delievers all of her lines perfectly, and is always on the edge as her character is.
6;And lastly, Ms. Moore blends into her character quite nicely.
7;The music fits like a glove.
8;overall, The Hours is an elegant film about some of drama's darkest themes.
9;But, the way The Hours is created, these heavy themes float on water like music on air.
10;Each element in this film is part of an opera, and when all the parts are singing at the same time, what an breathtaking piece it is!
11;I've heard about The Hours when I was in my early teens and it got cut into my memory as something hailed as extraordinary.
12;My curiosity got the best of me this year, so I decided to give it a try.
13;Maybe it's got something to do with egotism, maybe it's purely experience with other excellent works I've come to admire throughout my life.
14;lovers of cleverly written drama movies will be pleased.
15;The screenplay is piercingly smart, the direction is masterfully executed, the acting is magnificent.
16;The movie deserved its accolades and positive criticism purely on the fact that it succeeds at trying to astonish.
17;the casting is brilliant, joining three women to tell three stories of life, loss and loss of life.
18;The acting is rather awe.
19;inspiring, especially in the case of Nicole Kidman, who, emotionally and visually unrecognizable, manages to captivate with her sheer presence.
20;the movie gradually evolves into a tremendous piece of work, evoking all kinds of emotions in its audience.
21;"Vivid, colorful, restless and powerful, it is meant to inflict both gratitude and anxiety on the viewer: gratitude that you're, in fact, celebrating life, anxiety because you're dreading ""looking at life""."
22;Let's start with the only good thing about this movie: the acting, which is spectacular, as you can expect from the cast.
23;This movie got a lot of flack for being too depressing but I think The Hours starring Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf is a fascinating, intimate look at the stigma and isolation that comes from being clinically depressed.
24;Kidman earned an Oscar for her fragile performance of the suicidal writer.
25;I highly recommend this sensitive and gorgeous film, deals with heavy issues but it is a film you'll remember.
26;But it is scary in a way that even the wimpiest people can watch it with out a problem.
27;It is truly a masterpiece that should be seen by everyone.
28;The Hours is a quiet, meditative piece about what makes life worth living.
29;The trio of women share a self.
30;"She authored ""Orlando"" in honor of her onetime lover Vita Sackville."
31;"Realizing the unborn life within her, and reading ""Mrs. Dalloway"", she chooses life."
32;The hypnotic music from Philip Glass is excellent.
33;Moore, Kidman, Streep, and Harris give luminous performances.
34;The Hours is a contemplative masterpiece.
35;It is not a happy little movie, but it makes you think, and the acting was superb.
36;This was so intense from the opening scene to the last.
37;It was very interesting how it incorporated the fictional women to Virginia Woolf (expertly portrayed by Nicole Kidman).
38;I love all three of these actresses so it was incredible to see them in the same film.
39;I actually watched this for a psychology paper I had to, so I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is interested in psychology.
40;Amazing actresses make this movie!
41;A film that has substance and reflective.
42;Meryl Streep is the best actress in my view.
43;The actressing is a big deal among my cinephile friends, and yet I'm put off by the bulk of it here.
44;"depressive, ""lesbianic"", incestuous world that has been created."
45;If acting means extracting all joy from your words and facial mannerisms then the acting was great.
46;One of those movies you can see at least once a year.
47;Kidman, Streep and Moore do not disappoint .
48;Her character's connection to Streep's modern.
49;But I decided to take a look at it, and it turns out the movie is breathtaking, to say the least.
50;"And when you find out, you'll probably give a great big, ""OH!"
51;"Nicole Kidman was very deserving in the awards she received for the part of Virginia Woolf, but like I said in my title, I think just about everyone should have won awards
52;I enjoyed everything about this movie, although I didn't quite understand the kissing scenes.
53;Great acting, music and storyline shifting smoothly within three settings are what makes this unusual film stand out.
54;Three superb actresses shine in leading roles of three tortured women"
55;nevertheless, Harris was also nominated for an Oscar, as was Moore, and the leading female trio was given a joint prize for best actress at 2003 Berlin Film Festival.
56;This is a slick film, but let's not let that confuse us into thinking that it povides any kind of meaning.
57;Her potential solution and her actual solution were a bit extreme.
58;"I approched ""The Hours"" with very high expectations, perhaps due to my reading the novel of the same name prior driving an hour to view the film."
59;In these desperate moments, Nicole Kidman delivers a very heartfelt speech about her longing to return permently to London.
60;Although, after a rest, she decides to live, and returns to pick up her son, and to bake another cake for her husband.
61;Streep's character is perhaps the one the audience will most readally understand, being her expressions are the most outward of the group, as well as being in a setting most familiar to the viewers.
62;Ms. Vaghen's day encompasses her preparing a party for her friend Richard, being he has won a poetry award.
63;this movie is exceedingly gripping, and entertaining, if you let it be.
64;I recommend you read the Pulizer Prize winning novel of the same name before you view the film, as it will not only give you a deeping understanding of the story, but also of the characters themselves explaining how the characters feel about many of the situations they face!If you love deeply involved and complex films, this one will not disappont!
65;Having seen this a number of years ago when I was unable to focus on the movie (because a friend who was with me talked and asked many questions), this has been an interesting look into a classic story of mental illness.
66;A brilliant, contrapuntal cinegraphic telling of Mrs. Dalloway, as complex as the mind of the original author, Virginia Woolf, and beautifully complemented by the propulsive, minimalist music of Philip Glass.
67;And i thought it was about her.
68;it is a have to watch it through kind of movie.
69;Ed Harris does wonderful job also.
70;But it is my favorite actress Meryl who shines through entire movie.
71;and it makes you thing alot about life and troubles that come with it at times.
72;A must see and own.
73;just a dang good movie.
74;the first is in London in the 1920s with Nicole Kidman in her Oscar winning role as writer Virginia Woolf where she is writing her first novel MRS DALLOWAY, and fighting an oncoming breakdown during the process.
75;In my opinion the movie is good, but seriously overhyped.
76;Typical Oscar material in other words, though Kidman gives her best performance to date deserved her Oscar.
77;"As always, these actresses are wonderful (I much preferred Moore in this to her very similar part in Far from Heaven
78;Edward Harris as Streeps dying friend is also remarkable.
79;when I read the book on which this movie is based, I saw it as being as much like a piece of music as like a traditional novel: themes rising, submerging, and reappearing just as in music (purchasing flowers"
80;The pervasive Philip Glass score adds to this sense of theme, variation, repetition.
81;Its a beautiful score but I found it a bit distracting.
82;"despite the distraction, if anything I preferred the movie to the book
83;One doesn't always need or want a happy movie, but when it comes to serious movies of this genre I really do believe that you have to be in the right mood.
84;clarissa Vaughn played by Meryl Streep is in my opinion one of Ms Streeps finest roles.
85;She is one of the finest the world has ever seen when it comes to diversity and an ablility to make you feel as if you are a fly on the wall wherever she is.
86;She gives and gives and you keep hoping that someone will see her and her needs for a change.
87;Wow look at that sofa like Aunt Margaret's.
88;And the there is the whole sexual elements.
89;Which is so interesting to think about in 2003, when being able to be authentically what we want to be is so valued.
90;I am so impressed with how three women and their stories were so well intertwined but also separate and how the director Stephen Daldry was able to so smoothly yet distinctly switch our attention so well, almost like watch three top tennis players playing on the same court.
91;Each with their own style but so interconnected.
92;And when a film can do that for me I know it's a classic and one I am proud to have in my home library.
93;I thought Laura Brown was the character in the book, until I saw her reading the book, in the hotel.
94;when I saw it advertised, I was actually looking forward to watching this movie.
95;It is so true, that you can not tell a book from it's cover.
96;acting is amazing and the stories are weaved together to deepen one's understanding of each character.
97;the hours is definitely a movie i want to own and watch over and over again.
98;i feel i entered into the character's worlds by watching the movie .
99;i recommend this movie highly to everyone who is a woman and anyone who knows a woman.
100;Having a very close relative who has been diagnosed andwithout a doubt wrestles with the """"demons"""" that this """"illness"""" provides, Kidman's speech to her husband on the train station, in particular, is outstanding."""
101;My husband (he is the relative) has said as much to me, as Kidman says to her husband.
102;With medication and a psychiatrist, it will pass.
103;Good story line and beautiful acting (a lot of super stars in).
104;That's why I give it 3 stars.
105;See this film on your own merit if AND only if it really is a film you want to see.
106;In some ways, `The Hours' reminds me of Fassbinder's `The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant' another film I absolutely love but would never recommend to anyone.
107;Instead I will say why I liked it so much.
108;The flow between characters and time periods is flawless, further accented by the engaging qualities of all the characters.
109;I also enjoyed how there were several events, three of which instantly come to mind, that are never addressed throughout the course of the film.
110;I also enjoyed Toni Collette's cameo role as Julianne Moore's buxom 50s neighbor Kitty.
111;Collette is such a compelling and brilliant actress that I enjoy any film she appears in.
112;Whether or not you like this film you will come away feeling something.
113;"Based on Michael Cunningham's brilliant novel, ""The Hours"" is (and will be for years to come) a stunning, jolting time."
114;A few scenes, an introduction to her husband, and the hypnoyic under.
115;Not enough, the story transports to the year 2000, and two women living together, dealing with the up.
116;You need to know more, but that's actually quite enough.
117;"Deftly directed, expertly acted, ""The Hours"" is shocking."
118;I really liked this movie, but I haven't even watched the ending yet!
119;The cast is outstanding, but it just tears at your heart, what these women face.
120;Have to be in a great mood to see the last half hour.
121;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
122;The performances from Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep are amazing, and Nicole Kidman stands out as one of the greatest actresses of all time.
123;The direction is fantastic, the music superb and the story intense.
124;The Hours is a beautiful film that manages to dramatize a novel composed largely of interior thoughts.
125;The performances by the three main actresses are each fantastic, and the supporting roles are filled out almost as well.
126;one by Kidman, Streep, and Moore, and one by director Stephen Daldry and novelist Michael Cunningham .
127;are better than most commentaries, and shed a lot of light on the processes by which this film, which gets better with each viewing, was accomplished.
128;I thought the acting was incredible, I thought the story was fascinating, I just loved it.
129;I loved the character study.
130;These people were so real.
131;I like the depth of it, and the way it was narrated some, and the characters are all good.
132;Amazing movie about 3 women's lives and how they respond to their unhappiness.
133;Excellent acting and beautifully interwoven stories.
134;This is an excellent film made by Stephen Daldry.
135;Superb writing distinguishes it from novelist Michael Cunningham and its adaptation into film by experienced screenwriter David Hare.
136;That they utilized an ultra talented ensemble cast sealed this into solid A territory.
137;Every actor is first rate but the two to be singled out for breathtaking performances are Nicole Kidman as Woolf and Ed Harris as a dying poet.
138;I was able to more fully realize how talented Kidman is by not being blinded by her movie star looks.
139;She drastically changes her appearance so as to become Woolf and she also is the most extraordinary on showing what it is like to live The Hours.
140;Her scenes with a dying bird and at the train station with her husband are incredible.
141;Harris is just getting better and better from role to role.
142;I thought it was brilliant the first time around but,to get up.
143;personal watching it on my Kindle, made it new again.
144;I will give a huge kudo to Nichole Kidman for her performance, but other than that .
145;But like most hard things, The Hours first presents us with the difficult and then reveals a wisdom that leaves us feeling somehow better .
146;affirming decisions to escape suffocating social conventions or deeply conflicting relationships.
147;But the almost seamless interweaving, together with magnificent performances, provide for more than ample momentum.
148;more like the visual expression of a fine orchestral concert.
149;It will touch you more like a piece of music than a cognitive device.
150;But its greatest achievement is that it pierces through sad events, wrenches the viewer's heart with emotional authenticity, and delivers a vibrant, life.
151;the reckoning, the recovery, the personal growth.
152;that reveals the exquisiteness of life.
153;It is transformative pain above all else that enriches us and makes us wise.
154;The Hours celebrates THAT wisdom.
155;But be unflinching enough to take a closer look and see that it's a hopeful film.
156;"making of ""steady tranquil compounds with the aloofness of a work of art."""
157;I feel like everyone and their mother should have seen this film by now.
158;Meryl Streep's moments of desperation while trying to help her dearest friend are acted so well that they are literally heart.
159;Julianne Moore is reeling in an emotional tailspin that is possibly one of her very best performances.
160;Nicole Kidman is unspeakably good.
161;Every accolade this film has ever received is so deeply deserved and then some.
162;A well written and produced movie.
163;I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
164;It is a film I will watch again and again.
165;Highly recommended for the deep woman.
166;In both works, the issue is how we live our lives:do we squander the good times,assuming there will be more?
167;There is such a ubiquitous sadness, and it makes one wonder if it is possible to find some sense of happiness or fullfillment in one's life, or if it is just a chimera.
168;this movie is great, i've never read anything or seen another movie that captures the mood and atmosphere of depression closer than this movie.
169;I was very surprised because each actress is wonderful in their own right.
170;I had heard a lot of buzz about Nicole Kidman winning the Oscar for this movie, and the trailers made it sound interesting without revealing what it was really about.
171;Curiosity got the best of me, so I watched it.
172;Yes, the acting was excellent.
173;The cinematography and editing were also well done.
174;Yes, life has its dark moments.
175;Generally, I watch movies to be entertained, to be distracted, to be moved, to be educated at times, even sometimes to simply appreciate the art of the film medium, but always to enjoy.
176;My advice: Go see something uplifting instead.
177;The acting is excellent, especially by Moore.
178;"This film is one of those
179;The other support characters are equally wonderful: Ed Harris will break your heart as the ailing Richard, it is a shame that Allison Janney and Claire Danes weren't able to have more screen time, and John C. Reilly gives a solid and likeable presence to the film's middle narrative.
180;if you have given up on the idea that adaptations can never be as good as the source material, give this film a chance.
181;This film allows Cunningham's novel to spring to life before your eyes.
182;Just make sure you have plenty of tissues close by.
183;The overall story of this film is great, with great dialogue, interesting characters.
184;With this deep movie, the viewer really has to stay focused, and think.
185;Each time frame has its own lead character painfully recognizing and then coming to terms somehow with the anquish and disappointments of their own lifes, and the power of the film is that each character superbly conveys the torment of their lives.
186;Little wonder that Nicole Kidman, truly nearly unrecognizable, copped a richly deserved Best Actress Oscar for her devastating portrayal of the doomed Virginia Woolf.
187;As a lifelong friend of Streep's character, actor Ed Harris delivers an equally painful and stirring performance as a gay man dying of AIDS.
188;good"""" movie, """"The Hours"""" is an emotional experience for anyone who has hit the point when life doesn't seem to be enough and where the desperation stemming from absolute unhappiness can take us."""
189;Though it offers little to feel good about, the film is nonetheless a powerful force that begs the question how much of life each of us needs to be happy.
190;It's one of the best films of its type.
191;Both Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore are better actresses than Meryl Streep and have bigger roles in this film as well.
192;She does have an interestingly strange face .
193;These three moments reflect the conflicts of repression, passion, madness and compromise.
194;Without a doubt the most important dialogue of the movie is said by Woolf, as she decides not to kill Mrs. Dalloway: It must be the visionary.
195;It was wonderfull and beautiful.
196;Even the suicide scenes are beautiful.
197;this is a movie about thinking and it is for you to think.
198;what is the relation between poetry and art, and the everyday life.
199;This picture is an adaptation of a prize.
200;winning novel by Michael Cunningham, which is loosely based on one of the great modernist novels of the last century, Mrs. Dalloway.
201;The singular genius of the film is its fundamental structure, in terms of running all the aforementioned pieces and their themes in tandem.
202;Virginia Woolf was an experimental novelist, who successfully used the literary technique known as stream of consciousness.
203;Breaking away from the conventional realist or naturalist forms used predominately in the 19th century, where the narrative was carried along by way of external action, this new technique moved the action into the characters mind, known as interior monologue.
204;In Mrs Dalloway, we are invited into Clarice's mind, gaining access to her memories of childhood and relationships, and at the same time, her life parallels Septimus Warren Smith, a war veteran on the edge of insanity.
205;in many films the majority of burden is on the main character, the lead actor, to ensure the project is a success.
206;I believe the producers knew this and managed to hire probably the top three female actors in Hollywood.
207;Only one received the Oscar, Nicole Kidman, in the role of Virginia Woolf.
208;this is a complicated film but a beautiful one with a haunting soundtrack by Phillip Glass, which demands to be viewed more than once to discover its many nuances, allusions and their connections.
209;The Hours is a serious, complex movie with some beautiful performances.
210;numerous clever cuts and transitions link the stories (e. g., one woman cracks an egg and then the movie transitions to another woman doing the same thing) as well as more profound underlying emotions (Woolf had female relationships, Moore's character kisses another female character, Streep lives with a female lover).
211;the performances are for the most part outstanding with Kidman and Streep the standouts to me.
212;I found Ed Harris in the role of the modern day Clarissa's close friend stricken with AIDS (and her lover from years ago), a bit over the top.
213;"He's a fine actor
214;i would recommend this movie to individuals who like serious, literary films.
215;Beautiful in many ways, profound, thought provoking.
216;I enjoyed this but as an English teacher, I had hoped that I could possibly use this in my classroom.
217;It was a good movie in a strange way.
218;I love the movies that go back and forth through time.
219;The movie was absolutely amazing.
220;Nicole Kidman was such an awesome actor in this film.
221;I read The Hours first as well.
222;Ed Harris was simply incredible.
223;He played Richard in the movie exactly how I would have pictured him in the book.
224;It had a very original story.
225;But I will always give an honest assessment of how I react to a film.
226;the one who really existed in real life, and did indeed really commit suicide, Virginia Woolf.
227;If he had, he might have seen (the rest of) one of the most extraordinary American/British movies of the past decade.
228;This is a great movie, well written, good actors and a beautiful score.
229;I highly recommend this movie to drama fans out there.
230;The performances by the three leads are spectacular, as is Ed Harris' portrayal of Clarissa's dying friend.
231;It hit me like a ton of bricks.
232;While not a happy experience, The Hours is certainly a rewarding one.
233;The Hours is a marvelous exploration of the psychological burdens faced by three women.
234;All three women are alienated from the men in their lives, and all three find emotional and sexual companionship in other women.
235;the Hours is also an incredibly inspiring, albeit painful, story of how one copes with illness and loss.
236;Meryl Streep's character dedicates herself to caring for her former lover and best friend who has AIDS.
237;One of the main messages of the movie is that one has to look life in the face, see it for what it is, face the difficulty head on, and then """"put it away"""" (Meryl Streep's closing line as she turns off the light and goes to bed.)"""
238;One walks away from The Hours with the curious feeling of being heavy from the difficulty of its content yet uplifted by its message.
239;Nicole Kidman is perfect as Virginia Wolfe, the depressed writer dealing with a life that is stifling her, a world that she desperately wants to escape.
240;"Julianne Moore is superb again (also giving another great performance in ""Far From Heaven"") as a 50s house wife that is also living in a life that she can't bare living."
241;But nonetheless, the entire film is beautifully directed and acted.
242;Ed Harris does an incredible job as a good friend and former lover of Streep's character.
243;This is the kind of film that makes you realize how important and artistic the media of movie making is.
244;Make time and see this film.
245;The Hours is, in no question, one of the best movies to come out in 2002.
246;Its touching storyline makes the movie well worth watching.
247;Nicole Kidman's performance is the best in her career, making her well deserved of her Oscar win for Best Actress.
248;"Julianne Moore showcases her continuing strive for improvement, which she's done since ""Boogie Nights""."
249;No words can describe how wonderful of an actress Meryl Streep is!
250;Her three.year hiatus was worth the wait.
251;Harris should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor(not Chris Cooper), which he was nominated for.
252;because of all these wonderful performances, you can feel what it's like to live in an unhappy world.
253;Philip Glass is presently the greatest living American composer.
254;I had heard the music on a recording and wanted to relate it to the film.
255;The mating of Glass and the film was pure genius.
256;The story was so intense and heart felt.
257;I loved the three levels and how two were joined but not revealed til the last quarter of the film.
258;I highly recommend this film.
259;Not to give out the wrong impression, it is probably one of the best as well.
260;Wait till you feel better about life.
261;this movie is a rare example of an excellent filmmaking.
262;The cinematography is striking, shifts between scenes unlocking the interrelationship between these women are incredibly well guided and performances of all the stars involved in this film are superb.
263;Although there are a lot of clues that connect Laura Brown with Clarissa throughout the film, realizing what that connection is worth the whole movie.
264;It is a very well told story and is presented in a most beautiful way.
265;With such a great cast, this movie should provide more.
266;Based on Michael Cunningham novel, The Hours is a true tour the force that really deserved more attention than it received at the Academy Awards.
267;The script written David Hare weaves together the struggles of these characters in a way that really brings each of their stories into focus and makes the final moment almost as powerful as the first.
268;Nicole Kidman earn Her Oscar in spades with her gut wrenching performance of Virginia Woolf, and Julianne Moore is just as great as the lonely housewife who daydreams about the life she years for.
269;This film is a truly powerful and haunting piece of movie making, and it will not only hit you close to home with some of it's issues, but will at the same time give an up lifting feeling that will stay with you right after you see it.
270;grade: A, (I wise I can go higher.)
271;All I can say is wow.
272;I can honeslty say I have never seen a more beautifully portrayed picture in my life.
273;All elements of this film were fantastic.
274;The acting was superb, all three actresses deserved acclaim and oscars for their roles, as well as Ed Harris, who I feel is in a dead heat with Chris Cooper from Adaptaion for the Best Supporting Actor nod.
275;The depth of this film was extraordinary, I feel that a very important characteristic of a movie is that it can make you think and have a great amount of emotion for the caharacters, and this film succeeds amazingly in that category.
276;It is a very sad look into the human heart, and takes you on an emotional rollercoaster on its way.
277;The Hours is so beautifully and artistically written and portrayed on film it is unbelievable, to take a story that has no theatrical background and make it into such an extroardinary film is an accomplishment in itself.
278;The Hours deserved every critics' acclaim and award it was nominated for, honestly it should have been the Best Picture over the superficial and overrated Chicago.
279;The Hours shows that the voyage into the human mind and spirit is just as, or in my opinion even more exciting.
280;A feat in film making and a step in the right direction for a movie world that is reliant on cheap thrills and sex appeal.
281;Overall, A+ for wonderful film that we are lucky to have blessed upon us, definitely worth the time to watch it, you should be so lucky to have a chance to.
282;And if you still don't like it than you are a very shallow person in need of help, enjoy the Charlie's Angels premier.
283;Best picture of the year without a doubt.
284;A film that has haunted me since I first saw it, The Hours is a chilling depiction of depression over the ages.
285;Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and Julianne Moore deliver impeccable performances as three women whose lives mirror each others in sometimes eerie ways.
286;"What makes ""The Hours"" such a briliant movie is it's ability to convey the women's depression and inner torture to the movie going audience without ever actually uttering the word depression."
287;This is not only a tribute to the film's actors but also to its stunning direction and cinematography.
288;"A movie that should strike a chord with everyone (given how many people suffer from depression or other such diseases), ""The Hours"" is a must see at least once in your life."
289;Instead, I was stunned by how expertly everything was brought together.
290;rate and insightful, excising the extraneous and focusing on the most crucial matters contained within the original novel.
291;The Hours instantly earned its place in my heart as one of my favorite movies.
292;most of the action in this movie is psychological.
293;It is a film of close.
294;ups, where a twitch or averting of the eyes tells volumes.
295;Because of this subtle nature, the acting must be brilliant and understated.
296;"Nicole Kidman's portrayal of the tormented and brilliant Virginia Woolf is extraordinary
297;Julianne Moore also turns in an expert performance, while Meryl Streep is, well, very Meryl Streep .
298;Claire Danes, in her brief appearance as Clarissa's daughter, illuminates and enlivens everything around her.
299;Allison Janney as Clarissa's lover Sally provides a competent and natural performance, although her role is more ornamentation than character.
300;So much has been said about the actresses in this film that one of the best performances is often overlooked: Ed Harris as the dying poet, Richard.
301;All others will be richly rewarded by this powerful, expertly constructed film about what it means to hold onto life and then let it go.
302;Everything was good especially the musical score that played throughout the entire movie.
303;Kept me in a certain mood that I liked.
304;Great acting by the way.
305;The acting in the movie is the best you'll see in any dramatic film especially Nicole Kidman's acting.
306;This movie relays the human condition to the audience so well.
307;notch as one would expect from such a magnificent cast.
308;Julianne Moore is above average here, as well, but check out her amazing performance in Far From Heaven if you would like to see what she's really capable of.
309;nut whom the media takes up and celebrates.
310;Streep looks great and dresses to the nines throughout, a classic classy New York broad, a bleeding.
311;When he goes, the audience has to hold its breath to keep from applauding.
312;Virginia Woolf is the most compelling figure, a writer of vast and real talent who deserves one's attention.
313;Here we get a brilliantly performed piece, a subtle,lovely depiction of a real literary star.
314;As good as Streep's New York editor is, Kidman's Woolf is a tour de force, a dramatic treat.
315;It may be the best thing she's ever done or likely to do.
316;Streep, on the other hand, will surely go on to do far more interesting work.
317;If indeed there is a stream of super.
318;consciousness that literally and figuratively transcends space and time, then such a force is manifested in THE HOURS, a powerful, gripping examination of three lives over the course of one eventful day.
319;Woolf, in part due to her own depression and self.
320;This film moves superbly from one place in time.
321;to another, until at last the three separate stories are tied together in astonishing and remarkable fashion.
322;kidman, Moore, and Streep are incomparable"
323;The Hours is easily the best movie of 2002/2003.
324;The movie hits a high in a scene when Julianne Moore's character becomes engulfed in a sea of water while in bed.
325;ascertains his love for her before leaping to his death, another emotional high in the movie.
326;Nicole Kidman delivers a performance of a lifetime delivering a convinving portrayal of one of the leading authors of all time.
327;Her performance shines through in the scene when she argues with her husband for her own existence at the train station.
328;Perfect!Julianne Moore is the most outstanding here in her portrayal of a lonely housewife who makes a daring choice to break free and later confronts her son's suicide leap with much bitterness.
329;I don't know how they did it, but they pulled it off beautifully.
330;most of the success must be handed to Daldry for managing to make such an interior novel into a filmed, blended story.
331;the perfomances are all exceptional.
332;Streep, Kidman, Reilly, Harris and Colette are just perfect.
333;Moore is just brilliant as Laura Brown.
334;The Hours is without question the most beautiful movie I've ever seen.
335;Meryl Streep played her character so good, with so much feeling.
336;And I most say I was amazed to see all the other actors act great as well.
337;this movie is a piece of art.
338;All of the women in this film give good performances.
339;Nicole Kidman does a wonderful job playing a whacked out sheltered Virginia Woolf.
340;My favorite performances where those by Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep.
341;These two women seemed to outshine Nicole Kidman in this film.
342;I really think this is a chick flick, I liked it, my husband hated it.
343;destructiveness by weaving together the stories of three women.
344;The film deals with an incredible array of difficult issues.
345;Although this is at times a very difficult film to watch, it's mostly because the pain and anguish of the characters is just so real, mosty due to the excellent performances by everyone in the film.
346;And while the connection between the women seems initially to be nothing more than Mrs. Dalloway , toward the end of the film two of the main characters' stories come together in an unexpected and heartbreaking way.
347;The intertwining of the three periods is tied together in a very strong interlacing, which works.
348;This film proves that people on the whole lead lives of quiet desperation.
349;kidman, Streep, and Moore provide us with fine performances, but the most sympathetic is perhaps the portrayl of Virginia by Kidman.
350;She manages to reflect her deep depression yet at the same time her amazing sense of dedication to writing irregardless of how much it has ravaged her mind.
351;the music score is reflective of the desperation of all three lives.
352;how can this be a good movie?
353;than the movie brought in other time lines of people affected by the book.
354;but you can watch it see for your self.
355;I watched this movie and became hooked!
356;Difficult roles for the actors, but the acting is great!!!
357;The Hours, based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Michael Cunningham, is a movie about three women, all of whom have a kinship to Virginia Woolf's character of Mrs. Dalloway.
358;nicole Kidman is superb as Virginia Woolf.
359;She captures Woolf's brooding intensity and recurring madness to perfection, and her vulnerability makes one's heart ache.
360;Finally, Meryl Streep is Clarissa Vaughan, a successful editor who lives with her female lover.
361;Clarissa also spends a great deal of time tending to Richard, a close friend who is dying of AIDS.
362;stephen Daldry does a fine job of eliciting sensitive and compelling performance from a very fine cast, and the screenplay is faithful to the book without following it slavishly.
363;Clarissa's angst is also puzzling, since she has a full life, and is surrounded by people who love her.
364;She is an attractive, vivacious, intelligent and successful individual.
365;"Still, I urge you to see ""The Hours"" for the wonderful performances by a very talented cast."
366;This is one film that richly deserved its critical accolades, definitely worth owning, or at least repeated viewings.
367;nicole Kidman puts in the finest performance of her career.
368;You can just feel the towering genius and passion behind the eerie, unhinged exterior.
369;what many viewers may find deeply disturbing is the subtext that true existential FREEDOM.
370;and Phillip Glass's magnificent score keeps everything moving along crisply, despite the film's title.
371;The movie definitely makes you think.
372;the intertwining of the three periods is very interesting and keeps the mind moving, even while the film is sluggish.
373;the point is, stick with the movie.
374;Watch it from beginning to end.
375;This hotly anticipated film closely adapted from the novel written by Michael Cunningham is a triumph!
376;In 2001, Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) is a New York City editor organizing a party for her old friend who just won a major poetry award.
377;What we are given is a day in the life of each of these women.
378;The progressive avenues of escape taken through time leaves an ultimately optimistic feeling.
379;All three of the leading ladies deliver fantastic performances.
380;They have a tremendous supporting cast with powerful performance particularly from Stephen Dillante, Toni Collette and Jeff Daniels.
381;Each scene is emotionally carried by the powerful score of Philip Glass music.
382;This is a beautiful, artistic film not to be missed.
383;Has a lot of very good actors in this movie but the story is a little ackward and a little slow
384;Real life is full of situations like these.
385;I appreciate its bitter sweet honesty about how people might choose to respond to this reality and exact what they feel they need from it, regardless.
386;at first it was so mysterious!
387;this one kept you guessing and would seriously surprise you!a wonderful film!
388;you just HAVE to see it.
389;It's packed with special features, no not the kind you have to read yourself, these are interview, commentaries and even a special feature about Virginia Woolf herself!
390;When you mirror in a work of Art and you see yourself reflected is because has reached the deepest region of your emotions.
391;This movie belongs to that category of work of art.
392;"as I watched the extra interviews with the actresses, I found myself thinking, ""Who is that Nicole Kidman?"""
393;There is probably little knew to say about this superb movie that benefited from a strong performance by generations of some of the best actresses around.
394;in the movie, the Nicole Kidman character (feminist.
395;She must have known that her suicide would be immensely hurtful to her husband.
396;"regardless of the impact on those who love you."""
397;Loved the movie and the wonderful actresses.
398;I looked forward with anticipation to watching this movie after I saw a trailer for it.
399;Maybe someone else will enjoy it.
400;up, lighting, film and talent.
401;This film deserves a new rating: So What.
402;The back and forth story is tricky, but so well edited that really one has to focus, otherwise one loses the thread.
403;the suicide ingredient is strong for someone who's not accostume to hear or deal with it.
404;Depression, HIV, suicide, homosexual and bisexual relationships, psycosis, etc., are some of the elements depicted in this wonderful story.
405;And it's very simple: this movie is a grossly honest peek into the hearts and minds of brilliant women.
406;It's definitely a classic chick flick.
407;The viewer peeks into Ms. Woolf's psyche as she wrestles with her own demons, fears, insecurities and joy and finally uses her experiences to make Mrs. Dalloway real.
408;Streep brings her character's struggle to life with a stellar performance that is both convincing and touching.
409;watch this movie and enjoy it for what it is meant to be: simply honest.
410;it takes a pretty amazing movie to move me to tears and this one made me weep.
411;Give this movie a chance.
412;All wanting the truth in their lives but sofrightened to take the step.
413;Color, beauty, contrast to the real world.
414;What is a women's duty, children, wife, writter,cook, cleaner, nurse, lover, or all of the above.
415;gets less traumic the next time you watch and more enjoyable.
416;Others may see some redeeming qualities that we missed.
417;After reading THE HOURS by Michael Cunningham I took a respite from reading, so very superb was his book that I didn't want to share brain space with anything else.
418;The result is a wondrous, intimate exploration of the value of living, a value than can without censure include taking one's own life.
419;The dialogue is mesmerizing, a script (and book) that leaves you wishing you could memorize each word and line.
420;Every one of the company roles is acted (and directed) with uncanny finesse .
421;The Phillip Glass music score is the perfect choice to meld these ingredients into an unforgetable film.
422;It is simply and uniquely exquisite.
423;This movie will find a home with those people who want a moving cinematic experience.
424;And in this movie, the two characters that commit suicide do it out of love, so that their loved.
425;This is a beautiful piece of work, and there's much to linger in the sad interweaving of the stories of three women whose lives are not quite fulfilled, without being tragic.
426;still, it does take a while to get going.
427;"this is all aobut mood, stream of consciousness, atmosphere
428;The little boy whose mother, in the fifties, is suicidal, calling """"mommy"""" when she leaves him behind on an """"errand"""" is wrenching and unforgettable."""
429;"Don't worry if you don't know or remember a lot about Virginia Woolf, for example
430;but they are full of interesting insights.
431;prize winning book on which the movie is based, is also refreshingly down to earth, practical and humble, without being obsequious in his comments.
432;I watched about half of the movie with the commentary on, and found it very entertaining.
433;It's unusual to enjoy watching the commentary of a movie you didn't intend to see again, and evidence that the commentary is worthwhile.
434;Toni Colette, as a fifties housewive struggling to remain composed, is also wonderful.
435;Virginia Woolf's life and work.
436;We watch, fascinated, as each of these stories unfolds.
437;While there are certainly parts of this film which are tragic, the film takes the viewer on a deeply moving journey of masterful storytelling.
438;Every character is paired with an excellent performer, which is why the movie works so well.
439;In my opinion, this is a must.
440;see film for anyone who appreciates snuggling up with a good novel on a snowy day.
441;The acting in this movie was amazing and The plot was brilliant.
442;In appreciation of her efforts he rubs his intense desire to die and end his pain in her face.
443;They proceed to comfort each other and end up making out in front of Julianne's 5 or six year old son.
444;The movie introduces her to us throwing rocks in her dress and wading into a river.
445;This movie would be worth watching for the incredible performances alone.
446;I have nothing but the highest respect for Nicole Kidman as an actress, and donning a fake nose to tone down her pretty face was a wonderful choice.
447;Meryl Streep, of course, does an excellent job as well .
448;her breakdown with in the kitchen was very believable.
449;And you know the acting must be good with a supporting cast like Claire Danes, Ed Harris, and John C. Riley, all of whom do incredible, incredible jobs.
450;The whole mood of the movie is dark .
451;perhaps the best thing about this movie was the ending.
452;In actuality, I think this film was very uplifting, almost life.
453;The Hours is a very deep, thinking movie that takes a certain kind of person to appreciate it.
454;I would have given this movie the Oscar for best movie of 2002.
455;Adapted from Michael Cunningham's fine novel and directed by Stephen Daldry, who, as I remember, directed BILLY ELLIOTT as well, this film has everything going for it: first rate acting by everyone involved, beautiful cinematography, music by Philip Glass.
456;a composer I'm usually not into, but his compositions work perfectly here.
457;the action covers one day in the lives of each of three women.
458;The photography is quite wonderful here and helps to hold the movie together.
459;Meryl Streep is as alway magnificent.
460;There is a stunning scene when she meets the older Laura Brown who makes her apology for leaving her children.
461;there are great lines in this film, some of them straight out of the novel.
462;She wanted to look life in the face.
463;Richard: I have to face the hours.
464;I have stayed alive for you.
465;We thought it was the beginning of happiness, but it was happiness.
466;death, suicide, insanity, illness, friendship and, above all, love.
467;Everyone I know who has seen this film finds it unforgettable (as do I).
468;I also found it fun to follow up a few weeks later with the audiobook Mitz (audible.
469;Not memorable, but enjoyed watching it.
470;If you liked this movie, get a friggin' life.
471;With such a great cast I expected a lot more.
472;All three scenarios were very well acted Meryl was terrific.
473;my wife got this to see with her friends .
474;must have been heartwarming with honest, realistic emotions and without melodrama, violence or chase scenes.
475;Yes, it's an expensive cast.
476;Yes, it makes an excellent job of conveying a particular mood.
477;just a desire to cheer myself up.
478;I found it unchallenging .
479;It is beautifully shot, with an absolutely incredible performance by Nicole Kidman.
480;I challenge you to give this one a chance.
481;The acting is so incredible and the story is so moving that you'll be glad you sat down for two hours to watch it.
482;One viewing was quite enough for me.
483;The movie has a lot going for it, seeing as it is very emotional and will keep you interested throughout.
484;again, great performance from Nicole Kidman, as well as Julianne Moore and Ed Harris.
485;Streep is by far my favorite actress, and I feel anyone could have played her part.
486;Everything in this movie is visually beautiful and striking"
487;My class seems to like this movie
488;Great perfomances of everyone and a great director.
489;But he will be a poet, the poet of Mrs Dolloway, to the end of his life.
490;He will look for dangerous situations and dangerous experiments.
491;And the actors, especially the actresses are outstanding in their rendering of this suffering, of this exploration of death in life, of this witnessing of life in death.
492;The composition of these actresses is so fine, so delicate, so sensitive that we hardly recognize them in their parts.
493;Nicole Kidman is probably the most perfect rendition of this escape from any image of her we may have in our mind's eye.
494;They reach archetypal acting that makes the characters more important than the actresses.
495;i loved the book, and because Nicole Kidman played Virginia Woolf, maybe I am a bit bias when I say, the movie is so much better.
496;Which says a lot because the book is wonderful, groundbreaking.
497;But the shockingly real performances of the three starlets was amazing.
498;paced, thoughtful and intense drama that deals with some of the most profound issues of life and death.
499;"The writing and performances are outstanding, and a special treat in the ""collector's edition"" is the voiceover commentary featuring the lead actresses, Kidman, Streep and Moore."
500;What a pleasure to hear these great actors talk about the story, their scenes, work with other actors, their impressions of the movie vs. the book, Virginia Woolf, and so much more.
501;"Each expresses great pride in her work and ""The Hours"" is definitely an amazing showcase for all of them."
502;There's also a separate track with the director's commentary, a documentary about Woolf, shorts about Phillip Glass's soundtrack and more.
503;"Imagine the lives of three separate women, each a reflection of the others, intertwined yet fiercely independent, and you have the cinematic masterpiece of ""The Hours""."
504;Two fictional, one is real.
505;Three women who live a day in their lives that is a day that is their life.
506;layered story allows for complexity not often found in film: writer, reader, and character, honoring each spirit wholly and totally.
507;This powered the plot of the book, and the movie successfully managed to honor that device.
508;"Part of the pleasure and surprise of watching ""The Hours"" is trying to find those story elements mirrored in each other's story, and this lends itself to multiple watchings."
509;"whereas the story is unique, it's the beauty of the moments in ""The Hours"" that stun and awe any watcher."
510;This isn't a film that has you at the edge of your seat, waiting for the next exciting, thrill seeking moment to grab you, but one that draws you in slowly, completely, as you wait to discover the blossoming of each of these women.
511;what is thrilling is the performances.
512;Nicole Kidman, almost unrecognizable as Woolf, has created a completely nuanced character.
513;She is real, alive, complex.
514;"Try watching her performance and remembering her fantastic turn in ""Moulin Rouge"", and you'll appreciate her talent."
515;Meryl Streep brings to reality a crumbling Clarissa with both dignity and pain.
516;"But ""The Hours"" is a film that demands repeated viewings to appreciate everything it has to offer, which is, one of the best cinematic events in recent history."
517;Michael Cunningham's award winning novel, The Hours, received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the PEN/Faulkner Award, and was chosen as Best Book of 1998 by The New York Times.
518;Because the book is so extraordinary, I was apprehensive about how the film, based on this complex novel, could possibly succeed.
519;David Hare performed a miracle in writing this true and beautiful adaptation, in a manner faithful to the book, and also suited for the big screen.
520;He captured everything, including the important literary allusions, with great sensitivity and fidelity.
521;Stephen Daldry's direction encouraged the superb talents of his ensemble cast.
522;Daldry has once again proven to be a master of his craft.
523;virginia Woolfe, brilliantly portrayed by Nicole Kidman, is living in isolation with her husband Leonard in 1923.
524;Her doctors and her husband agree that she will possibly find peace away from London.
525;She has begun to write Mrs. Dalloway, the story of a day in the life of one woman, Clarissa Dalloway, a woman's whole life in a single day .
526;She understands the nature of her illness, and at one point explains to Leonard that although he must live with the burden of her illness, so must she.
527;the poet, the visionary will die, so that the others will value life more.
528;She could be a mirror image of a modern Mrs. Dalloway.
529;Her closest friend, and former lover, Richard, a novelist and poet, actually calls Clarissa, Mrs. Dalloway.
530;Like Woolfe's Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa is giving a party, for Richard, who is about to receive a prestigious lifetime achievement award for his poetry.
531;the intermingling of the three women's lives, and their struggle to find meaning, outside of brief moments of happiness, is very powerful.
532;The visual montage of the three women, is superb and so effective.
533;The musical score is haunting, and adds much to the film's mood.
534;And the acting is superior, not just by the three women, but by the entire supporting cast.
535;the tension builds toward a powerful ending, which even though I read the book, still came as a surprise.
536;This is a deeply moving film, about living out the hours of ones life, about love, survival, and about mental illness and creativity.
537;i'm 13, and i think that this is one of the greatest films ever made.
538;but that really shouldn't turn you away, because it's an excellent movie, and beautifully shot.
539;in an Oscar winning role.
540;the scene is amazingly shot, very well done.
541;my favorite scene in the film containts Kidman as Woolf.
542;soudns corny, i know, but it's really beautiful.
543;Perhaps she's TOO good of a best friend.
544;words can't express how beautiful this film is.
545;the message, the art, just everything!
546;wonderfully done, superb acting, and a movie that was nominated for BEST PICTURE.
547;I am a Merle Streep fan, so it's got to be good.
548;Hint: I think it has something to do with hours in the day.
549;"Indeed, the three actresses all turn in riveting performances
550;Kidman, who won the Oscar for Best Actress, is ironically the weakest of the three leads and has the least screen time.
551;the entire supporting cast is certainly the film's strongest asset, with strong performances from Jeff Daniels, Miranda Richardson, the delightful Toni Collette, and the underrated Stephen Dillane as the conflicted Leonard Woolf.
552;it's one of those musical scores that is better when listened to by itself.
553;still, the film is worth a watch (and even an 4/5 rating) for some brilliant performances, especially by Moore and Streep.
554;Stephen Daldry's adaptation of Michael Cunningham's novel of three interwoven stories concerning the composition and reception of MRS. DALLOWAY is really a throwback to the great so. called weepies, or women's pictures of the Forties and Fifties.
555;The strongest of the threads (and the most affecting) concerns an emotionally fragile housewife (Julianne Moore) barely keeping it together on a summer's day in the 40s in Los Angeles: the rhythms Moore and the wonderful child actor who plays her son are so assured and unnerving that it's almost painfully beautiful.
556;Nicole Kidman garnered a great deal of critical attention (and an Academy Award) for wearing a prosthetic nose and playing Virginia Woolf herself during the composition of her greatest novel.
557;Kidman looks and seems almost nothing like the real Woolf, but the performance is exceptional nonetheless: she almost seems to come unglued by dint of her sheer intellectual strength and sensitivity.
558;In the weakest of the stories (a fault of the original novel), Meryl Streep is quite fine as a contemporary Mrs. Dalloway putting together a party for her best friend, a famous poet (Ed Harris) dying of AIDS, and she redeems the material here a good deal.
559;The movie is knit together with a very beautiful score by Philip Glass.
560;Nothing very tangible that meets one's eye.
561;But if one is looking for evidence either for or against staying around for loved ones as the theme of the movie, the most compelling evidence comes from Laura Brown, played by Julianne Moore.
562;She longs to be back in the big city instead.
563;She tells them to use ginger.
564;She responds that she doesn't see a problem there.
565;The paralles are implied between the real life of Virginia Woolf and two fictional women who lived later, one of them being the aforementioned Laura Brown.
566;There could be the potential for a supernatural thriller there, if the movie consistently pursued it.
567;This movie is one of the best.
568;movie, actress were simply incredible and Ed Harris performance excellent as always
569;The actresses did a great job in portraying their characters.
570;I cannot believe it was Nicole Kidman"
571;I felt Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep all deserved the academy award.
572;This movie is so excellant, and it stays with you.
573;this movie is beautifully filmed, acted and scored.
574;Michael Cunningham interweaves a beautiful tapestry of the timeless intricacies of a woman's soul.
575;They begin to detoriate one by one until an unexpected twist and resolution descends upon them.
576;The cords that run through all of us continue on and we will find strength from one another.
577;"I loved the intertwining of Woolf's novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"", a truly ingenious technique that seem to be popping up in many screenplays this year."
578;This film genuinely surprised me, because from the outset I was determined not to like it at all and by the end of the film I wastotally absorbed in the tragic, shadowed lives of the characters, some of whom I liked, some I felt ambivalent toward, and some I loved.
579;Her facial expressions, mannerisms, and overriding obsession with death bring Woolf to life.
580;As with Kidman, he transcends his usual policy of turning in the same performance every film and shows he can actually act.
581;the scenes with Woolf and her caretaker/husband Leonard are all fantastic.
582;We can take our lives, leave our loved ones, etc, at will and there isn't anything to stop us.
583;not a movie I'd necessarily watch again, but certainly poetic and a must see.
584;I absolutely abhor period films which try too hard to be period films, and this was one of them.
585;The only character I really liked was Virginia Woolf, and I thought Nicole Kidman did a fairly good job of subtley acting the part.
586;I didn't particularly enjoy this portrayal of women.
587;I enjoyed the final few scenes, but only because they spoke to the inner chick.
588;I think the ending was a bit too overdramatic as well but it works for this kind of film.
589;I liked how Virginia described herself wrestling with her demons in the dark.
590;This is a great movie worth watching.
591;Judging From The Critics Reviews I Expected A Little More Out Of This Movie.
592;It Was Very Good But It Lacked Something.
593;An intelligent and lyrical film adaptation of Michael Cunningham's exquisite Pulitzer Prize.
594;winning novel about the ways in which any person's life can be drastically altered during the course of a seemingly normal day.
595;"Like Cunningham's book, the film spins all three stories simultaneously, pointing out the similarities and differences between each of the women's lives
596;driven film, the acting in """"The Hours"""" is uniformly superb."""
597;"Meryl Streep is luminous throughout as Clarissa, but particularly shines in her final scenes as she welcomes a stranger into her home
598;Toni Collette infuses her short scenes as Laura's friend and neighbor Kitty with a marvelous counterpoint to Moore's quiet introspection"
599;among this handful of flawless characterizations, it is Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf who nonetheless stands out.
600;"She completely disappears into her role
601;Kidman uses her mouth and eyes with incredible economy: her bowed lips move without disturbing her pale, translucent cheeks"
602;It's a transcendent performance, and one with which Kidman solidifies her growing reputation as one of her generation's most talented screen actresses.
603;"the film is beautifully photographed in dark, muted hues
604;The most stunning technical achievement of the film is the wonderful costume design"
605;Costumer Ann Roth should definitely find herself in the running for an Oscar, as should Streep, Moore, Kidman, Harris, director Stephen Daldry, film editor Peter Boyle, and of course, the Picture itself.
606;"Altogether, ""The Hours"" is an outstanding film that provides an extraordinary cast ample and unique opportunities to shine, especially its formidable trio of leading ladies."
607;Reading the reviews here on Amazon, it seems there are many people who feel The Hours was hypnotic, moving, and intelligent.
608;Both of the above statements are true!First, let me say there is rarely a masterpiece created that isn't self.
609;A visionary knows when he creates a masterpiece, knows going into the project that he is creating something that speaks of truth.
610;It doesn't use irony or any kind of sideline, but hits the audience with truth head.
611;the greatness of Kidman's wistful gazes and forceful intensity.
612;The pain and humility and wisdom conveyed in her voice and every gesture.
613;It is the compelling combination of brilliant performances, a haunting score, and masterful writing that gives the film its unique and lasting impact.
614;and to address those who feel Kidman only won the Academy Award for her deglamorized appearance, perhaps they should see the film again and look at the meaning Kidman conveys in every gesture, word, and soulful gaze.
615;"The closing lines of this film are a quote from Virginia Woolf where she wrote, ""To look life in the face, always, to look life in the face, and to know it for what it is."
616;at last, to love it for what it is, and then to put it away.
617;One failed entirely, and one loved life .
618;by abandoning her world, and, most notably, her children.
619;my original response to this film, a movie depicting the lives of three women who must all face suicide and delve in their own personal masquerades as well as mental illnesses, was that I was somehow swept up in awe of it all.
620;The acting was solid, the cast extraordinary, and the music was sweeping.
621;I found the women tolerating life at best, and certainly were not adhering to Woolf's famous quote on the nature of living and loving doing so.
622;"There are moments of delicacy and superb acting that are hard to find these days
623;I also think Glass' music helped overcome many of the otherwise self.
624;For those of you who adore this film, you can do what you will with it.
625;The movie stars Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep.
626;It was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and Nicole Kidman won for Best Actress.
627;It was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director.
628;This is a film with a high class pedigree.
629;In the end, The Hours is really telling just one story and each of the time periods contributes to it.
630;Clarissa Vaughn is living in New York City, and it seems that she is living the life of Mrs Dalloway.
631;The movie features supporting performances by John C Reilly, Ed Harris, Claire Danes, Alison Janney, Miranda Richardson, Toni Collette, and Stephen Dillane.
632;to see how it worked its way into the fabric of the story line.
633;actually, even though this is mostly what would be considered a 'chick flick', it turned out to be a rather good movie in it's own right.
634;i would strongly recommend watching the special features presentations.
635;especially the one that describes the actual life and upbringing of Virginia Woolf.
636;I found myself deeply touched when realizing what an extremely difficult and deprived life she had.
637;and this featurette helped me to better understand the movie itself.
638;A subtle, literate meditation on life's hidden detours which direct us away from self.
639;Stephen Daldry's ambitious piece succeeds as intense, disturbing drama, showcasing prodigious talents of Streep, Moore, and Kidman (who won Oscar).
640;Ed Harris, Toni Collette, and John C. Reilly also shine in this memorable film.
641;They have each been in an excellent role recently.
642;Further, I admire Virginia Woolf, one of the pioneers of Modern literary technique.
643;understood by servants and loving husbands, relatives, children, inflicted needless cruelty on its viewers.
644;A magnificent wallow in self.
645;centered, solipsistic characters who take themselves so seriously and with such verbosity against a background of plaintive music that you're grateful when someone finally succeeds at dying.
646;the movie is very good at evoking the sense ofclaustrophobia that the characters feel, but the characters are not themselves interesting enough to justify the overwrought emotions this movie tries to stampede over us.
647;interesting narrative structure, interweavingthree separate stories, two of which mirror events in Woolf's book Mrs. Dalloway, and a surprise ending.
648;A guy can enjoy The Hours.
649;The movie is flawlessly made, and manages to stay interesting, even lively, despite what I'm sure sounds to you like an emotional soup of wallowing.
650;If you have the choice between seeing this film or running face first into a wall, pucker up and plant a big one on that slab of concrete, because your head will hurt less than sitting through this crapfest.
651;The Hours was an okay movie with outstanding performances, which I can say is the strongest attribute of this release.
652;Kudos to Nicole Kidman for her Best Actress Oscar!
653;i agree that the director successfully interwove the lives of three women from dissimilar time periods to create three situationally identical stories in one feature.
654;For instance, Virginia Woolf was looking for new avenues of adventure and exploration"
655;That pretty much sets the tone of the film as a whole.
656;"winning poet, and Clarissa (nicknamed ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by her Richard) is planning a dinner party in honor of his accomplishments."
657;tHE HOURS is a complex film, the heroines of its three subplots all linked by the threads of self.
658;The performances of the four principle actors (Kidman, Moore, Streep, and Harris) are all of Oscar caliber.
659;I perceived the velvet chains that bind two people in a relationship.
660;this is a splendid and brilliantly conceived film that deserves all the honors it will reap.
661;The connection between the 1951 and 2001 timelines was cleverly done.
662;Without a doubt,this was the best drama of 2002.
663;The screenwriter took an incredible novel, and converted it into an incredible movie.
664;Bravo to all involved with this project.
665;The Hours has become one of my favorite movies, and it is one of the most extraordinary films that I have ever seen.
666;Directed with skill by Stephen Daldry, the film moves fluidly from one time to another, helped along with an exhilarating score by Philip Glass.
667;It also is a showcase for actors, several of whom give the finest performances of their careers.
668;But it is also a film about the value of life and the choices we make as we go through it.
669;The three stories flow seamlessly in with one another, and there are a thousand tiny moments that take your breath away.
670;The acting is a large part of the film's success.
671;Nicole Kidman is a revelation as the tortured Virginia Woolf, and richly deserved the Best Actress Oscar that she won.
672;Kidman disappears so completely into the character that she is nearly unrecognizable, and there is a ferocious intensity that radiates from her every glance and inflection.
673;I'll be surprised if Nicole Kidman ever tops this performance, it's astonishing.
674;"Meryl Streep gives what is probably her best work since ""Sophie's Choice"" in 1982."
675;Her Clarissa has tried to bury herself in work to keep from remembering that she isn't happy with her life, and Streep's scenes with Ed Harris as Richard, a poet dying of AIDS, are master classes in great acting.
676;besides the three main stars, the entire cast is uniformly excellent, even in smaller roles.
677;The Hours is a film that will make you think, and that requires more than one viewing to catch all of its subtleties.
678;It excels in every aspect of filmmaking to become something genuinely great.
679;And I was blown away how fast it got here.
680;The Hours is a beautifully crafted, thought.
681;nicole Kidman is convincing as the silently tortured bi.
682;Juliann Moore is the most heart.
683;maid to her male ex.
684;She wants to rescue him.
685;Their lives are poignant: brutally so.
686;This is the only way she believes she can save(or free) herself and those she loves.
687;In her mind she is saving (or freeing) herself and those she loves.
688;three hurting women, much loved, who abandon those who love them.
689;It is deep and thought provoking.
690;As for me, I believe this movie is one of the greatest of all time.
691;I highly recommend it to anyone who is not above soul.
692;Clarissa Vaughn's (Meryl Streep) day is about organizing a party to her friend and ex.
693;lover, the poet and writer Richard (Ed Harris), who is receiving an important prize of lifetime achievment in poetry.
694;Stephen Daldry made a movie more complex than he wanted, without knowing he did it.
695;"Uncounsciously, ""The hours"" is deeper and denser than its director wanted it to be."
696;"although ""The hours"" is starred by women, a movie about women, with three of today's top actresses, their constant presence and the fact that the three of them are so sad, depressive and unresolved characters, makes the male actors' (Stephen Dillane, John C. Reilly and Ed Harris) acting excellent."
697;The best one in my opinion is Stephen Dillane's Leonard Woolf.
698;"As the sad and unloving Laura, she is the most complex, convincing and believable character of ""The hours""."
699;To those really, open your minds before you open your mouth or type a word to review an item.
700;But i gotta say i absolutely loved this movie.
701;truth is, i loved it more for its realistic subjects about these 3 ladies.
702;this is great acting and a great film.
703;It has been a very long time since i have seen a movie that has moved me so incredibly.
704;This film was perfectly made, with the plot of each of the womens' lives weaved intricately together.
705;Standing out as perhaps the best aspect The Hours has to offer is the powerful performances that Julianne Moore (who can act, let me tell ya), Meryl Streep, and Nicole Kidman.
706;With an equally emotionally stirring score to go along with it, this was a great film, to say in the least.
707;The film provides a sort of haven.
708;, from the simple questions of life to the more serious, complex questions of life, the movie's ability to capture that part of one's conscience is simply a gift the artistic creators of this movie gives to the audience.
709;Aside from the psychological contributions it makes to the society of women who desire understanding of themselves more, it is also just a beautifully made and brilliantly composed film.
710;Each time I found it enriching, layered, delicate and beautiful.
711;The direction, creation of imagery, and attention to detail is faultless (thanks to Stephen Daldry's theatrical experience I wonder) Everything about this film is exceptional, from the lines to the costumes to the masterful score.
712;It's elegiac, profound, literate, thought provoking, moving and engaging.
713;see it, devour it, think about it and then .
714;But it was one of the best experiences I have ever had in a cinema to share the company of Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman, and I thank and applaud them and every single individual who brought THE HOURS to life from the bottom of my heart.
715;(I loved it so much I've just writen a dissertation on it for my Master's degree!
716;This is a spectacular movie in which we get the opportunity to see acting by some of the best actresses of our time.
717;subsumed in the main three stories, which only come together at the end (in a masterful stroke of screen.
718;writing and directing) are several metaphorical streams opening (but never closing) the questions of intimacy, creative spirit and (emotional, physical and creative) survival.
719;this is a deeply inspiring film, a true work of art.
720;At first I thought it was going to be a tearjerker but this movie has a lot of twists and turns and good actors/actresses.
721;They did a wonderful job of transforming Nicole Kidman's face into a semi.
722;The characters were all wonderful and once I got it, enjoyed it alot.
723;It was very good to watch with excellent acting performances throughout.
724;I would recommend learning a bit about the book or the plot before seeing it.
725;This move is truly one of the best dramas I have seen in a long time.
726;All three of the three female leads are absolutely perfect, but Ms. Kidman definitely stands out as the best performance of the year.
727;Definitely deserving of the Best Actress Oscar.
728;The way it interweaves the three stories is compelling and moving to watch.
729;It is brilliant in every way.
730;When you watch this it will take you from tears to torment.
731;You feel so passionately for all the characters, that you wish to reach out and help them.
732;Definitely take out 'The Hours' to watch this movie.
733;She is the reader of the book who can identify with the main character in the book.
734;The cast of Hours enhances it's monumental film experience by using deep rooted dialogues tangled with periods of silence.
735;the 3 stories are interwoven beautifully, with little or no jarring when moving from one to the other.
736;In fact, I really liked the way the film transitioned.
737;"I got the feeling that I should have read the book first or at least known the history of Virginia Woolf and her book ""Mrs. Dalloway""."
738;I love a good biography and good acting, but this storyline did not hold my interest.
739;"The Hours is a somber, moody, and unique film that you either find ""stunning"" or ""boring."""
740;The three leading ladies are each wonderful and it would have been a toss.
741;up for me to pick the one to win an Oscar.
742;Ed Harris plays the man dying of AIDS and he is brilliant here.
743;Phillip Glass' musical score is subtle, delicate, and a perfect background to the inner turmoil of the three women.
744;a culmination of this film is several kissing scenes: Virginia and her sister Vanessa, Laura and her neighbor, Clarissa and Richard.
745;These scenes are suppressing and passionate at the same time.
746;life in part is like the flowers Clarissa uses to celebrate the party.
747;"It conveys a sense of transient beauty
748;virginia Woolf was engaging a novel """"Mrs. Dalloway,"""" which was read later by Laura Brown, a mother who eagers freedom herself."""
749;"Instead, I found ""The Hours"" (the working title of Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway"") to be intellectually engaging."
750;Hare is presenting the stories in Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize winning novel as parts of a puzzle.
751;Not only does she share the same first name as Woolf's character, this Clarissa is also preparing to host a party, as is Brown.
752;They offer insights into how this finely crafted jewel of a film came into being.
753;In the final analysis, perhaps the greatest ironic truth of this film that is adapted from one novel which was inspired a classic novel is that it is such a literate film.
754;A mature and finished teenage artist, she seems to have grown into an incomplete adult artist.
755;"Skillful for sure
756;I await her return to greatness.
757;(And I plan to see the new Spike Jones movie with the once.
758;perfect Anna Paquin and see how she's doin' as a young adult or aged teen.)
759;The layers and layers and layers.
760;provoking and heartbreaking and hope.
761;crafted and every performance adds to it.
762;The acting is first rate.
763;This is art in its finest form.
764;Three stories that are weaved together with a thread that is revealed at the end.
765;She's frustrated at her forced seclusion from the London she loves and is making time for her sister's visit.
766;There's Clarissa Vaughn, a middle.
767;Michael Cunningham linked all this together in the small masterpiece of a novel.
768;And the screenwriter, David Hare did nothing less than a brilliant job in adapting it to the screen.
769;I was surprised at that because I think of her as a glamour queen.
770;She comes across as dowdy and homely and slightly insane.
771;And her acting is so good that I thought I was seeing the actual Virginia Woolf on the screen.
772;She's living with her own set of life regrets.
773;They, and the rest of the cast are some of the best actors in the business, and it really shows.
774;the cinematography and sets are also outstanding and the shifts between the three stories are seamless.
775;There will be a gesture in one scene that is picked up in the next and this kind of overlapping editing keeps the story flowing.
776;There's a theme of suicide throughout.
777;Mostly, though its about the our need for love and the choices we make about how to spend our hours.
778;But yet, its theme is universal.
779;The Hours is a movie you have to watch and listen to carefully.
780;The message is thought provoking and the story quite serious.
781;Beautifully acted with poignant cinematography, you will see a story unfold that is quite human in every respect.
782;a movie to watch twice.
783;And, if you enjoy that sort of thing, then it is right up your alley.
784;And if you are prone to depression, this could possibly bring you lower, although I found it rather satisfying and uplifting by the end of it.
785;as for the performances, every actor was superb.
786;Nicole Kidman has my full respect as an actress due to this film.
787;I completely forgot it was Nicole Kidman while I was watching the film.
788;The little boy who played Julianne Moore's young son was superb .
789;Such excellent casting all the way around.
790;and the winnah is:THE HOURS!I can't find the words to express how thoroughly, utterly, entirely, totally, supremely and breathtakingly BAD this movie is.
791;She's NOT going to say that!"""""""
792;"She's NOT going to do it!"""
793;The astonishing thing is that all of the actors have been passably good, some brilliant, in other roles.
794;I have seen far better stuff on the Lifetime Network.
795;It gives me such high hopes that young people will look up the works of Virginia Wolfe and profit by reading her contributions to English Literature.
796;This movie is so beautifully acted and made.
797;It has a poetic resonance as it unfolds, sort of like how American Beauty portrayed.
798;The film is stark in its ability to illustrate the truth and some people may react to the film in negativity.
799;I think the overall emotion the film can reflect is compassion.
800;Kidman, Streep and Moore were all outstanding!
801;They made this movie an inspiration to watch.
802;Notice how well Kidman achieves her accent and voice change.
803;Her mannerisms are impeccable, they are not overdone, she channels her creativity it is so wonderful to watch.
804;Streep is so honest in her acting, she becomes an emotion.
805;Moore is subtle, very subtle and yet so effective!
806;This movie is very emotional and can trigger depression.
807;I felt a heaviness after watching it but there was also so much beauty layered within.
808;So keep this in your mind if you chose to watch this film.
809;It took me a while, but once I was an hour or so into the movie I really liked it.
810;I think I liked it more the second time I saw it.
811;I like the movie better.
812;unawere to herself but she is keeping richard alive for herself.
813;this movie is cleverly constructed so that you feel that the womens lifes are not so far apart.
814;the musical score is perfect ,not a fault to it.
815;i have to say i had to watch the film again to understand better it but once i got it,i loved it!
816;Makes you truly comprehend your own reaction to hard situations.
817;Would recommend if you have time to think about you life.
818;This beautiful, heartbreaking, haunting film is one of my all.
819;It is extremely well written, acted and directed.
820;Every detail of this movie takes my breath away.
821;If you love emotional, moving, stories about the realities of life and love then you will love this truly gorgeous film.
822;The Hours is a wonderful story told with much care.
823;The Hours is a movie that gently flows in understated gracefulness, tying together the fate of the lives of three people who are influenced by the words in a book.
824;I came away from this movie knowing I had seen the work of excellent movie craftsmen.
825;This movie, for many, will surely illicit strong sentiments.
826;winning book by Michael Cunningham, The Hours .
827;As simple as such a plot may strike you, it is a complex one, but a careful editing labor, a passion for storytelling, some outstanding acting and the music by minimalist maestro Philip Glass serve as the thread between the stories of these three women.
828;complementing an already outstanding film statement, the make.
829;up and the dialogs ring once and again, with Kidman's face virtually hiding away to bring Woolf's back to life, and when you listen to the lines of all the characters taking on a life of their own, almost moving away from Woolf, away from Cunningham.
830;This story is about our eternal search for happiness, the choices we make in that search, and their consequences as the director, Stephen Daldry, so brilliantly put it.
831;It was the moment, right then!
832;All in all, this movie is now and will be for as long as I can remember it, a classic and a constant reference.
833;This is a fantastic movie!
834;The acting is superb, and it keeps you guessing until the end.
835;I knew this movie was great, but wasn't sure about Nicole's performance.
836;Now after seeing her heartbreaking and amazing performance as the troubled Virginia Woolf, she is at the top of my great actress list.
837;Not to negelct Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep, they are always amazing in their roles.
838;One of the best films I have ever seen.
839;Finally, a film that is true to the book, which is fantastic.
840;Every cast member is super famous.
841;The first scene will grab you!
842;The Hours is a breathtaking motion picture experience.
843;The three stories blend together seamlessly, and quite surprisingly, taking the viewer for an emotional ride into the lives of three women, so obviously tormented by their confined sexuality.
844;The three female performances are magnificent.
845;The emotions experienced by these three women, and the people surrounding them, are no doubt emotions we have all experienced at one point.
846;making and the shifting of time periods is absolutely wonderful.
847;Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf comes up with the first sentence for her book.
848;Laura Brown, the exceptional Julianne Moore in her second Oscar worthy performance of the year, reads the sentence.
849;No doubt many people will be turned off by the film, but one has to appreciate the beauty of such an exhilarating masterpiece.
850;This is truly one of the best films of the year, and all three women deserve Oscar nominations.
851;but I'll do so again some day as, again, the acting/casting are absolutely wonderful.
852;This movie unforgettable and each time I watch it I find something new that make me look at life and relationships and death.
853;rate, from Steep, Moore and Kidman to the smallest of roles.
854;the acting, the writing, the editing and the music are all excellent.
855;The extra features are first.
856;this film is one of the top ten movies I have ever seen.
857;The Hours is a richly woven tale of three women, living parallel lives decades apart, linked by a book written by Virginia Wolf, who is played deliciously by Nicole Kidman.
858;the storytelling is very clever .
859;The dialog is very engaging.
860;pruriently, the best parts are definitely the kissing.
861;She kisses her lover out of passion and thanks, as if to say to us, `Gee, how surely times have changed!
862;'I thought Nicole looked great with the fake nose, and watching her (as well as the other women) smooch was definitely an unexpected treat.
863;the Hours is a masterfully well crafted tale that is movie.
864;making at its very finest.
865;For those who know of Virginia Woolf and her deeply disturbed life, this movie presents a glimpse of the quiet emotional torment women suffer while going about their lives.
866;Streep's character shows that love is often ambivalent and always necessary.
867;Ed Harris is brilliant as the tormented poet .
868;a beautifully, fully realized character.
869;"I had viewed it reluctantly, expecting a smarmy, ""girly"" flick."
870;winning novel, The Hours, becomes a riveting film under the direction of Stephen Daldrey.
871;The novel, covering one day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, raises questions about the role of women, their ability to find satisfaction in their lives, the options open to them, and ultimately what they owe those who love them as opposed to what they owe themselves.
872;She is reading Woolf's novel as an escape.
873;As the plots and times shift, the reader sees each woman becoming more desperate and her life becoming more fraught, until all plots intersect in the conclusion.
874;Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey creates stunning, overlapping motifs to unify the scenes.
875;the acting is intense, as each woman faces a crisis in which suicide is considered, and there is little let.
876;Kidman, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress, plays Woolf without histrionics, while Moore and Streep show their emotions more overtly.
877;The writer of this film has achieved the impossible in the movie business: create an intruiging, beautiful, yet filmable version of a very untheatrical novel.
878;"The third woman is Clarissa Vaughn, in a wonderful performance by Streep, whose link to Woolf is that she is actually living the novel Mrs. Dalloway,"" except in present."
879;as the single day unfolds, the emotions and personalities of the characters are the main focus, much like in Woolf's novels, and the seamless edits and chilling Phillip Glass score contribute to the overall sad mood.
880;all in all, the transition from book to movie is highly successful and smooth, the performances are marvelous, and director Stephen Daldry proves once again how talented he is in his craft.
881;Nicole 80% chance will be nominated for this movie for best actress.
882;language movie to have been released in 2002, but it is, to me, the most exquisite and delicate.
883;"As such, it is not designed to be a commercial movie for mass consumption
884;To people who love great acting, any one of these women in a movie makes it worth seeing.
885;Adding to the talent overload are such marvelous actors as Miranda Richardson, Claire Danes, Ed Harris, John C. Reilly, Toni Collette, Allison Janney and Stephen Dillane.
886;Woolf was a brilliant writer who suffered from severe mental illness.
887;On the surface, all this dallying with suicide may seem grim and depressing, the movie is actually life.
888;affirming, but, as I've said, it's not meant for mass consumption.
889;kidman deserved her Oscar for Best Actress in """"The Hours""""."""
890;Like Bette Davis before her, she is always willing to take on an acting challenge.
891;"Still, I wish there were an Oscar for Best Ensemble Acting because that is the one ""The Hours"" should have received because each remarkable individual performance adds to the power of the film as a whole."
892;I find the movie very delightful in remaining faithful to Michael Cunningham's novel except for some minor details.
893;"The novel describes Clarissa pauses at the threshold of the vestibule door on a June morning
894;In the first 30 minutes or so, the screen jumps from one woman to another, back and forth in time, to establish the common thread of these three women.
895;Meryl Streep delivers a solid performance playing Clarissa who is unhappy and melancholy though living a full life.
896;The scene in which she breaks down while telling Louis about Richard's illness is striking.
897;She too, is not happy with her life though she has a perfectly happy marriage and a cute 3.
898;Laura wants freedom from motherhood and duties of a wife.
899;I really enjoy seeing her getting on the wrong foot with her servant Nelly, whom she sends off to London for ginger biscuit and China tea impromptu.
900;Kidman adroitly captures Woolf's brooding and grudging intensity.
901;I think the film is well done in the sense that unity of the novel is preserved.
902;I recommend everyone to see the film and treat oneself to a dazzling performance by a brilliant cast.
903;I really liked this movie, even if it is rather depressing.
904;As another reviewer said, this is not just a film, it is an experience (and one worth having).
905;It is really beautiful to see how the film goes seamlessly from one woman's life to that of the other: there is a wonderfully perfect inconsistence that is only explained (and linked) at the end of the movie.
906;virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman)is depicted as an intelligent woman battling against madness in the 1923 England, while she starts to write what will be one of her best novels, """"Mrs. Dalloway""""."""
907;Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep), a successful literary agent in the present, is planning a party for her former lover, who is now dying of AIDS.
908;Its light is rather dark, that is true, but it is incredibly good even for someone like me, who generally doesn't like dramas.
909;It is not only a film, but a masterpiece.
910;"and this was up for umpteen Oscars!If one word can describe this movie best, it's ""goofy."""
911;"This movie has ""earned"" one star because I expected so much more, what with the stars in the film, all the fine press it received, and all of the awards it was up for."
912;the Hours does a remarkable job of making the audience feel the restlessness and dissatisfaction of the main characters.
913;Once you get used to the rhythm of the changes, the method becomes refreshing.
914;the Hours manages to express the inexpressable devastation of human emotional pain thanks to the superb acting abilities of Julianne Moore (Virginia), Nicole Kidman (Laura) and Merle Streep (Clarissa).
915;Kudos to director Stephen Daldry too!
916;I cried so much at The Hours.
917;It was so well done and the characters were so relatable.
918;All the action takes place within the span of one day in each of the women's lives.
919;My aforementioned concerns:the film was seamless as it traveled from woman to woman, generation to generation, WITHOUT!
920;Amazing work!At end of film, had brief chat with the same two women.
921;They confirmed, that prior knowledge of V. w's work was not a prerequisite to understand and appreciate this sensitive, terrific, moving film.
922;It brought me to tears.
923;lover, who has just won the top prize for poetry writing, and is also dieing from AIDS.
924;what makes the film work so well is the acting.
925;The dialouge is well written and the acting is off the charts.
926;Without brilliant performances, this film would not be nearly as good as it is.
927;That's just fine with me.
928;i found everyone in the film so intriguing and intresting.
929;another highlight of the film is the beautiful score from composer Philip Glass, whose music makes the scenes complete.
930;It fits the film too, because most of the music is like someone gradually gaining anger or frustration, and then exploding or wanting to explode.
931;nicole Kidman won Best Actress for this film at the oscars, and rightfully so.
932;She is great as Virginia.
933;but everyone else is equally great.
934;This is such a complete cast.
935;"The Hours was my second favorite film of 2002, only behind Steven Spielberg's brilliant masterpiece ""Minority Report""."
936;This film is one that you see, and cannot forget.
937;It was interesting to see how each of the stories intertwined.
938;It had so much promise.
939;daldry's film of Michael Cunningham's novel is audacious in it's physical design but more importantly in it's ability and assurance when it deals with the emotions involved with being a human being whether it be 1920's England, 1950's California or 2002 New York City.
940;"the acting in ""The Hours"" is of the highest order: natural, multi."
941;colored and intense: Kidman, Streep and especially Moore are not only out for blood but for Truth as well.
942;The Hours is a rare movie.
943;A movie with a palpable sense and understanding of it's own world and a commitment to its characters.
944;It is a moving experience that is not to be missed.
945;They are all brilliant in a film that is compelling in its expert weaving of how these three women's lives are so parallelled.
946;"The editing of the film is outstanding as well, the gorgeous score by Phillip Glass
947;All come together to bring a movie of unusual depth and sensitivity.
948;While certainly not a """"feel good """" kind of movie, THE HOURS IS nonetheless absorbing film viewing."""
949;If you've ever had problem with depression, anxiety or fitting in, you'll probably be able to appreciate this film.
950;It's a depressive look at 3 lives that are worth looking at because these sorts of people have been and are now in our society.
951;If you're looking for something that's going to present an honest look at human emotions and the complexity of sexuality, then you may enjoy this film.
952;first and foremost, this film is a triple triumph for three of the greatest actresses of our time.
953;Kidman, Moore, and Streep give complex, emotionally rich performances.
954;They are backed by an astonishing supporting cast that includes Toni Collette, John C. Reilly, and Ed Harris.
955;Jack Rovello is particularly amazing as Laura's young son.
956;"length commentaries (one by Kidman, Moore, and Streep
957;These great extras made me savor this beautiful film even more.
958;The chronologically separate stories are skillfully and seamlessly woven together.
959;The film presents a complex tapestry of human relationships and emotions.
960;Yet in the end it is an emotionally full and satisfying journey.
961;Excellently acted by all three actresses.
962;Juliane Moore shines in her role as a """"50s"""" desperate housewife."""
963;I was intently watching the whole time, parts played very well and kept me interested.
964;It's really a pleasure to see all these great actos together in one movie.
965;the film received 9 Oscar.
966;nominations, also for the best director .
967;, the best script .
968;David Hare adapted very well Michael Cunningham's book The Hours , and the best Film.
969;It WAS one of the best films in 2003, maybe the best, with Far From Heaven and Chicago and The Pianist .
970;And the film with the most best actors: Nicole Kidman received an Oscar for her Virginia Woolf.
971;meryl Streep is laudable and brillant as Clarissa, there are small moments where you know she is a really great actress.
972;Than you can see what's a real high.
973;but actually the attraction, the best actress of the movie is Julianne Moore.
974;Her performance is outsanding, and it's just not understandable why she didn't received an Oscar and just a nomination.
975;With Far From Heaven and The Hours it's clear that she is one of the best actresses in our time.
976;ensemble (also in supporting roles included Oscar.
977;grand as ill poet and Clarissa's friend .
978;This is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen.
979;It is simply brilliant, and Streep, Kidman, Lewis and Harris are, without a doubt, four of the greatest living actors.
980;the writing, directing, cinematography, and every single actor .
981;I think it's a masterpiece.
982;"While she wants desperately to return to a more stimulating environment in London, the ideas for her next novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" begin to form in her mind."
983;In 1951 Los Angeles, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a housewife with a loving husband and engaging little boy.
984;"Her friend, a poet named Richard (Ed Harris), nicknamed her ""Mrs. Dalloway"" when they were young."
985;The Hours is a character study of these three women, based on the novel by Michael Cunningham.
986;The Hours shows us only one day in the lives of each of these characters.
987;The performances by Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep, as well as the supporting cast, are excellent.
988;Much has been made of the prosthetic nose which Nicole Kidman donned for her role as Virginia Woolf, and she truly is unrecognizable in the film.
989;Her performance really is impressive and may be her best work to date.
990;Kidman easily holds her own next to the more experienced and acclaimed thespians, Streep and Moore.
991;"nominated turn in ""Adaptation"", so this is a must for Streep fans."
992;Yes it was beautifully filmed.
993;Yes it was well acted.
994;And if you have a wife or girlfriend, keep her away from it.
995;In a world full of such high maintenance films as The Matrix, The Hulk, et al., which all seem to strive for a blockbuster appeal, The Hours is delicate in its presentation, hypnotic in its music and cinematography.
996;It is easy to see how Nicole Kidman won Best Actress for her stunning portrayal of a delicate yet bold and strong Virginia Woolf.
997;The cast is superb and heartbreaking, rendering a movie that will both tear at each emotional limb yet reconstruct those same limbs in a more statelier manner, offering hope for life.
998;But the power of this movie is found in this dissonance of the loss of life, of identity, and the power of choosing life.
999;It is a simple message perfectly displayed in a powerful package of the lives of three women interwoven to form a cinematic masterpiece.
1000;The Hours proves that you do not need the force of explosions or special effects to deliver an impact so rare in today's entertainment world.
1001;I felt like it took a while to get here but still happy and is in wrapper unopened!
1002;The author knows how people in distress feel, think, and do, and the film beautifully expressed it.
1003;Some words said in the film are as beautiful as literature.
1004;It is psychological and philosophical.
1005;This is one of the few movies that is as good as the critics say it is.
1006;I am awed at the writer's ability to weave the three storylines together so perfectly.
1007;Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore are just marvelous in their parts.
1008;Though the underlying theme of suicide is dark, there is something wonderful in the way each character deals with it.
1009;really beautiful, sad, haunting .
1010;Still, Nicole kidman was amazing and I enjoyed the movie immensely!
1011;"'THE HOURS"" is a beautiful movie made from a well written but ugly story."
1012;She believes moving back to London will make her happy.
1013;"In this segment of ""The Hours"" Ed Harris is superb as a middle aged man with AIDS."
1014;All 3 stories in time are masterfully weaved together.
1015;All our characters have so much in common, tragic things and wonderful things too.
1016;Now lets bring up Nicole Kidman's Oscar.
1017;"I love Nicole Kidman, but I would have rather seen her win an award for her flawless work in ""The Others""."
1018;Just about everything about this film is worth praising.
1019;The acting is quite good.
1020;And, the profound effect that it had on other people.
1021;They were in a sense doing the best they could.
1022;All the main actresses play their roles very well, and it is Kidman (almost unrecognisable with her prosthetic nose) who delivers the films best performance.
1023;the three stories overall link together well, although not as well as many people have claimed, as the time changes did seem a little laboured at times.
1024;Nearly all of the characters in the film are unhappy, and the overall mood of the film is a dark and haunting one, which added to the atmosphere.
1025;"the Hours is a good film, perhaps very good, but nothing more than that
1026;Yes, there were good points, its uniqueness, the high level of acting, its cleverness of character and time transition, but it was more an experimentation in story structure than a great movie.
1027;Stephen Daldry's film The Hours is among the best films of the last few years.
1028;The performances are very powerful from the whole cast, with Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore shining the brightest.
1029;Daldry's move from stage to screen is proving to be great for film, receiving many nominations for both The Hours and Billy Elliot.
1030;These comparisons are slight, however, and The Hours is its own unique story as original and compelling as Magnolia or Memento.
1031;The Hours is indeed a powerful film.
1032;The power trio of Kidman, Moore, and Streep turn in a subtly nuanced coup d' grace of a performance that to watch is to sit on the sidelines of a Super Bowl of an event of acting.
1033;the screenplay and director's editing are quite a notch above creative genius.
1034;It is illuminating to hear their individual approach to acting and their experiences making this film.
1035;She is proud of this fact and points it out.
1036;kidman, Streep, Harris and Moore acting is stunning.
1037;The Hours is probably my favorite movie.
1038;The story line is so well concieved and the cast is simply amazing.
1039;Every time I watch it I am moved spiritual and intellectually.
1040;Meryl Streep is her usually amazing self, and Julianne Moore and Nicole KIdman shine as well (though Kidman more so that Moore).
1041;This movie is worth the hours of your time.
1042;Okay, after watching the Golden Globes award show and seeing 'The Hours' crowned with the highest prize, Best Picture, and hearing incessantly about Nicole Kidman's fake prosthetic nose in the movie, it was time to venture into that darkened theater and see how good the awards.
1043;These three storylines will be juggled as the film progresses, with each woman's life deeply changing before the end of the day.
1044;What this movie needed was a rappin' kangaroo, post haste!The film is wrought with female victimization, and screams """"Give me an award already!"""""""
1045;girl action, your thirst has finally been quenched.
1046;lover, you know what, almost anyone in the Streep storyline), one.
1047;stephen Daldry's direction shows surprising stability and instinct after his art.
1048;The technical aspects of 'The Hours' are quite competent, especially the sharp editing and musical score, which just points out further how slickly hollow and manufactured the film is.
1049;important for its own good.
1050;No synopsis can really do this film justice, because so much of it is about what lies beneath the surface.
1051;interweaving literally and thematically in the most unexpected and poignant ways.
1052;most obviously at the beginning, with clever intercutting as the three women awake to face the day.
1053;Contrasts and similarities effortlessly illuminate elements of character and setting, and this is something which continues throughout the film.
1054;"Every viewing opens up new perspectives and new parallels
1055;shot and accompanied by a wonderful score, this is a stunning film: subtle, beautiful, moving but never maudlin.
1056;There's good background on the life of Virginia Woolf, the music, and the making of the film.
1057;Genuine enthusiasm comes through from all concerned.
1058;my cat just loved it.
1059;I was concerned that my blazing ignorance to Ms. Woolf's work, and this one in particular, would hinder my enjoyment of the film and my ability to understand it.
1060;This is it, basically: Mrs. Dalloway decides one morning .
1061;First is Virginia herself (Nicole Kidman), and our introduction comes in the form of her 1941 suicide at the age of 59.
1062;A feminist Ophelia, she places a stone in her dress pocket, walks to a nearby stream, and lets it carry her away.
1063;Her brief, mortal stroll is voiced.
1064;Each awakes and acquires flowers.
1065;Each has something special going on that day .
1066;They all face suicide, and they all face the choice between death and the imprisonment of life.
1067;The Hours is a miracle of a movie.
1068;it is that rare film about women and their unique experiences that neither excludes nor condemns the role of men in their lives.
1069;the sexual politics of the film are sometimes scattered but fascinating .
1070;all of the performances in """"The Hours"""" are excellent, uniquely extraordinary, and utterly unforgettable."""
1071;Ms. Kidman, unrecognizable behind a prosthetic nose, does more refined work here than I have ever seen from her.
1072;equally profound unraveling before the party and, in a devastating scene at the end, as she just listens to a voice from the past that puts things into perspective.
1073;"sad, but never far from hope, ""The Hours"" not only also has an outstanding supporting cast (including Claire Danes, Allison Janney, Miranda Richardson) and superb direction from Stephen Daldry (""Billy Elliot""), it is also one of the finest films of 2003 and of recent memory."
1074;Every once in a while a book adapted movie comes out proving more than just a film with box office success.
1075;Despite all of the excellent acting by Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep, and Julianne Moore the viewers more concentrate of this beautiful achievement.
1076;There are some fine supporting roles in this movie by Claire Danes and Allison Janney just to name a few.
1077;the Hours is such a gem in movie making and it stands out in 2002 like a sun during night.
1078;The whole movie is almost like a piece of poetry, en excellent poem.
1079;One with vivid imagery and excellent descriptive vibes about real.
1080;when it was first released) I thought it was quite good, and would probably have rated it 4.5 stars.
1081;Very good acting by Meryl Streep (as usual), Julianne Moore (who, though recognized as a major acting talent, I think is actually under.
1082;rated most of the time), and especially Nicole Kidman, who in this role, is unrecognizable as herself (a. la Bobby Deniro in Raging Bull or Charlize Theron in Monster).
1083;"my admiration for the author of ""To the Lighthouse"" approaches reverence, so I was skeptical of Cunningham's ""The Hours"" (too cute, surely), but I picked it up and was entranced: a ghostly fugue of themes at the heart of Woolf's work, amazingly well done."
1084;And that's what we get.
1085;For ex, when Virginia kisses her, she returns it, instead of acting like she's just been come on to like she does in the film.)
1086;With a dream cast, it should have been so great.
1087;Watchign Nicole Kidman first appear and then vanish like a wisp of smoke into Virginia Wolff was amazing.
1088;Since To Die For, I've always thought her talented at the art of vanishing but she proves here again that its not a trick but a conscious ability.
1089;julianne Moore as always is a woman on the verge of.
1090;The ability to play someone who wants to speak up but can't or won't is pretty incredible.
1091;all in all this is a great film, and as always I advise patience with the film, its revealed how everyone is connected soon enough.
1092;Deep,excellent direction, excellent acting and excellent music!
1093;It will keep you guessing throughout most of the movie only to surprise you at the end.
1094;The Bottom Line:The Hours was pure Oscar bait.
1095;a prestigey adaptation of an intellectual novel (see The English Patient for another) with Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep for God's sake.
1096;This is a very deep film that actually needs to be viewed several times over since the underlying story is like weaving a pearl necklace.
1097;It is a work of cinematic art.
1098;If nothing else it is a must see for the originality of the technique.
1099;"the 1920's story concerns Virginia Woolf's (Kidman) efforts to write her first successful novel, ""Mrs. Dallaway""
1100;All three performances are extraordinary in their own unique ways and there are wonderful performances from all members of the supporting cast.
1101;It is as if each member of the ensemble brought out the best in each other.
1102;All three women are found in bed and this begins a match cut process that will repeat itself throughout the film as the director and editor work to connect and unify the three separate stories.
1103;kidman's Woolf is an amazing character.
1104;Yet she has a subtle charm that helps you to understand why people found her fascinating.
1105;like """"The Big Chill"""", this is an ambitious character study film with many characters."""
1106;"woolf began the book ""Mrs. Dallaway"" with the intention of basing it on a society woman she knew who unexpectedly committed suicide."
1107;well, she's a hostess and she's incredibly confident and she's going to give a party.
1108;And, maybe because she's confident, everyone thinks she's fine.
1109;at its core this is a movie about art but it is a broad definition of art, writing a book.
1110;There is a touch of irony to each situation.
1111;there is a visitor and a kiss in each story central to the self.
1112;sophie Wyburd who plays Virginia's young niece was obviously cast for her haunting voice and her ability to display such a focused intensity.
1113;Moore's expression finally tells us that she has decided to leave her family.
1114;Streep's kiss signifies her recognition of the preciousness of what she still has in her life and her choice to embrace it and move forward.
1115;Whatever the validity of these issues, the very fact that discussions are at this elevated level is the best testimonial the film could have.
1116;I thought this was a very good movie, although it was so full of angst I also found it very hard to take.
1117;"the basic theme of The Hours is love and loss
1118;I especially liked Toni Collette's portrayal of Laura Brown's high.
1119;spirited best friend Kitty who has to go to the hospital and is not looking forward to it.
1120;Of course, that's not Nicole Kidman's fault, especially since her acting was wonderful.
1121;For some reason, I felt unattached to the Nicole Kidman .
1122;I thought that their unrequited love, which is brought to both characters attention constantly, was genuinely constructed by all the characters involved.
1123;It shows how this unrequited love affects not only Ms. Streep and Mr. Harris, but also Ms. Janney and Mr. Daniels.
1124;Everyone in the segment knows that Ms. Streep and Mr. Harris should have been together, and that in most intimate ways, they are.
1125;the segment that I found myself most drawn to was the Julianne Moore .
1126;She has a face as smooth and beautiful as a Michaelangelo statue .
1127;is great, no doubts about it.
1128;Thematically it was tied together all the way through, but they really tie it up well.
1129;That, and that the film would make a great double feature with Ms. Moore's FAR FROM HEAVEN.
1130;The stories are interlaced by these connections and by the book """"Mrs Dalloway"""" by Virginia Woolf who also appears as one the main characters in one of the three stories."""
1131;The characters of Kidman and Streep have near.
1132;perfect lives full of people who love them, plenty of money, nice place to live, etc.
1133;Kidman sits around all day in a huge house with servants, next to a huge garden, has a husband who adores her and will do anything she wants, and she can basically do whatever she wants and write whatever she wants at her own pace.
1134;I found Kidman did an amazing job of portraying Virginia Woolf's more disturbed side.
1135;In the movie, the pathos of Mrs. Woolf is very well portrayed by Mrs. Kidman.
1136;great movie l love meril streep and julian moore and nicole katie kidman.
1137;they did an outstanding jib in this movie
1138;Boasting an exemplary cast, purposeful direction, authentic production values, and a haunting musical score, The Hours is a sincere praiseworthy attempt to adapt Michael Cunningham's prize.
1139;winning novel to the screen.
1140;It is provocative, introspective, hopeful, and at times downright desolate.
1141;As evidenced by the opening sequence, the value of life itself is called into question and it sets the tone for the rest of the film.
1142;"Based on a Michael Cunningham novel, ""The Hours"" combines a real life story (Virginia Woolf), a re."
1143;"written one (Laura Brown's interpretation of ""Mrs. Dalloway"") and an original creation as well (Clarissa Vaughn)."
1144;Things like the settings and clothing for each story help compile a perfect, believable plot.
1145;Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Virginia Woolf that is the most mesmerizing and transforming performance in the film.
1146;She is completely submerged as the famous novelist of the early twentieth century.
1147;Her performance allows her characterization of Virginia Woolf to fully emerge.
1148;meryl Streep and Julianne Moore also gave impressive lead performances with memorable emotional scenes.
1149;Ed Harris, Claire Danse, John C. Riley, Alison Janney and Toni Collette all did an amazing job in this exquisite masterpiece.
1150;This movie had the BEST ensemble cast I've ever seen.
1151;I love wonderful acting and this movie depicts the amazing acting of Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore.
1152;You are so moved by the end you just think what it must have been like living with this mental disease!
1153;Thoroughly enjoyed it and I would watch it again.
1154;and you can bet it will take notice.
1155;She has an adorable three year.
1156;She's got the vacant thing down to an art.
1157;This is a very meaty role and demanding of such talent.
1158;It is the type of movie that serious revieweres will feel compelled to label a masterpiece, even though inside they really wanted it to end as badly as the rest of us.
1159;and wonders if it's really worth going on.
1160;To me, this movie is cerebral and heavy.
1161;"I find the Hours akin to a musical composition
1162;It's very profound when Virginia explained to her husband that sometimes, someone needed to die so that the living can appreciate and cherish their lives.
1163;All three ladies in The Hours are deemed to be visionary, ahead of their times, not conventional in any sense of the word and because of that, their actions, things that they do are construed as out of ordinary.
1164;This movie is worth watching again in order to explore the many layers and depths that it contains.
1165;For me, it's quite a journey.
1166;But for people who love deep, meaningful, well.
1167;crafted film, The Hours is great.
1168;This would be a perfect film for a film studies class.
1169;What an extraordinary movie with extraordinary performances by the three actresses, particularly Meryl Streep who is breathless and gorgeous in this film.
1170;This is an ambitious film.
1171;It's one of those great concepts that didn't work out very well, in my opinion.
1172;There's a lot of acting going on.
1173;nicole Kidman, usually a fine actress, wears a prosthetic nose and dowdy dresses and speaks in a throaty monotone which impressed a lot of people.
1174;(She won an Oscar for it) The film would have been better if we had seen some of the up side of Woolfe's character.
1175;She's in love with her neighbor?
1176;i usually love Meryl Streep's performances.
1177;She has the ability to disappear into her character better than almost anyone else I've seen.
1178;many people will be impressed because they think they should be.
1179;And it's about suffering and AIDS and suicide and women kissing and all that important, juicy stuff.
1180;This is a heavy film, dealing with suicide, sexual identity, love and happiness.
1181;But instead director Stephen Daldry created a masterpiece.
1182;But each story is fully engaging, drawing you in.
1183;equally as astounding, if not more so, is the superb acting by each and every actor.
1184;She deserves the best actress win here.
1185;Moore and Streep also give powerhouse performances, but Ed Harris's magnificent supporting role as an AIDS stricken man is as astounding as Kidman's.
1186;His physical transformation is astounding in itself.
1187;How it deals with sadness and the desire for happiness is realistic for many people experiencing depression.
1188;The world we live in is far from perfect, and this film shows how if we're not careful, it can bring us down in despair.
1189;the Hours is a rare, wonderful film that deserves any awards it gets Oscar night.
1190;Though it may not be very cheerful, it is one of the best of the year.
1191;It gets my highest recommendation.
1192;with three stunning actresses in supremely well.
1193;com review does an excellent job of reviewing the movie.
1194;This film is like a slightly jarring piece of music.
1195;it WILL move you in unexpected ways.
1196;When I finished it, I sat on the sofa, mouth opened, in tears for the next hour.
1197;I do like to watch the X. men and Tomb Raider movies, and the such, but I also like to watch all kinds of good movies.
1198;Great movie for anyone that works in human services.
1199;Good resource for SW professionals and professors.
1200;liked the movie a lot .
1201;great theme, liked the future, past back and forth play.
1202;I would actually watch it again and recommend.
1203;Beautiful """"footage"""" and music, fine enough acting."""
1204;it's always been that way, and the Bible states it along with multitudinous other instruction on surviving and enjoying life.
1205;what is truly amazing is Romans 1.
1206;amazing the knowledge and wisdom in an age 2000 years ago.
1207;But, the cinematography was good.
1208;And the acting was good.
1209;this film assembles the talent needed to bring a difficult script to life.
1210;weaving three stories together is a deft feat, accomplished here by connecting the stories with the ties that bind them.
1211;Also instrumental in keeping the flow of the movie going is a superb score by minimalist Philip Glass.
1212;it's the acting that really shines, though.
1213;Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep earn our empathy in every scene, radiating their feelings above and beyond the carefully crafted script.
1214;Because the film conveys at least two messages of profound importance.
1215;She felt such possibility, such joy.
1216;the beginning, she thought, of happiness.
1217;But that was happiness, she now knows.
1218;She should have known it then.
1219;She should have understood it sooner.
1220;She should have been living the life she's got.
1221;The three stories carry across four generations.
1222;Miranda Richardson's reaction is a fit of hysterics, and she flees to London.
1223;the Hours begins and ends with a suicide, with another in the middle for good measure.
1224;Yet it affirms the value of life, of moving on, of progress, of the notion that tomorrow will be better.
1225;It is a movie of depth and ideas.
1226;If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on one of the decade's most profound cinematic achievements.
1227;I doubt I will see many films more compelling and beautifully acted in my lifetime than was this one.
1228;I saw it on a Saturday and went back to see it the next day.
1229;Nicole Kidman was truly remarkable as Virginia Woolf, which is not to say that Julianne Moore and Meryl Steep were not as good.
1230;Do yourself a favor and see this one on the big screen.
1231;The Hours got great reviews, and both of us had read a couple of Virginia Woolf's novels in past periods of our lives.
1232;The relentless degeneration among all of these materially very well.
1233;There is never a thematic break that allows the audience to see something positive .
1234;Tragedy is best illustrated by also illuminating what was good about the protagonist.
1235;layered is the best phrase I've heard used to describe The Hours.
1236;the acting is absolutely top notch.
1237;this is a movie to be watched over and over again to truly appreciate the strength of the characters, the strength of the direction, the strength of the supporting cast, and the timeless flow of the haunting score by Philip Glass.
1238;As I read reviews, I have to remember that these are more statements of identification and pleasure than they are reviews of an art form.
1239;"I don't know anyone who could get some sort of upbeat pleasure from the story line of ""The Hours,"" but the acting is fantastic, the story touches on a lot of our, as human beings, darker, personal thoughts."
1240;It made for a powerful story.
1241;This isn't a film one enjoys, it is one that affects.
1242;The movie was highly anticipated and with good reason .
1243;the three main actresses were well respected, adapted from a Pulitzer winning book by a successful playwright and directed by a second time director.
1244;but what really holds this movie together is the editing.
1245;It was actually done perfectly.
1246;The movie took three similar, yet separate stories and wove them together effortlessly.
1247;meryl Streep can do no wrong and does a wonderful job.
1248;But I have to say .
1249;Nicole Kidman was extremely good.
1250;even Philip Glass' music fits the piece .
1251;He did a good job too.
1252;I do like listening to each actress discuss their approach to their craft.
1253;and watch your mind piece together the 3 lives that make up the movie.
1254;And Richard Brown, her son, his friends and the last day of his life.
1255;it is the story of 1 day in the lives of 3 people.
1256;The point of the movie has to do with happiness, how fleeding it is, yet how important each day is, not just in retrospect but as you are living it.
1257;All in all, good movie fare, best served with a good friend and talking and thinking outloud.
1258;The acting is superb and the writing is novel.
1259;If you are a fan of literature, this is a film to enjoy.
1260;An hour into the film I wished they would all stop their crying and carry out their suicidal urgings so I could move on to a real film.
1261;I can't recommend it, really, yet it got my wife and me talking the way few movies do.
1262;And the critics loved it.
1263;Ray has my favorite line in the film.
1264;"and he says about his wife and son, ""I imagined our happiness."""
1265;The whole LA bit is so vivid, so flat and un.
1266;And that's Ray, saying that totally campy, guileless line, in a movie filled with people who seem never to have imagined the happiness of another person.
1267;But I have a quibble: Richard's make.
1268;up is so terrifically believable, why let one of the last shots of him show his well.
1269;I bought the Special Collector's Edition of Hours and what a stunning package it is.
1270;The movie is an emotionally draining experience that works on many levels, acting, especially Nicole Kidman who provides a quite stunning performance, make.
1271;up, Ed Harris really does look like he has Aids, sets, fifties Los Angeles with all the cars they had to find and the English countryside looks like the English countryside, costumes, dialogue, music, lighting, it all blends together so perfectly.
1272;There is an excellent thirty.
1273;minute documentary about Virginia Woolf and three other features, which perfectly complements the movie.
1274;So, overall an excellent package that I think will be worth many repeat viewings.
1275;changing movie with a subtle message.
1276;This is a sad subject to touch on, the style of putting three layers of time periods in the movie is a wonderful concept, the cast is great.
1277;My expectations forced me to expect something utterly amazing, but it's just a really good movie.
1278;I thought this would be a good movie with all the great actresses until I realized that Virgina woolf was indeed very mentally ill so was her sister, lets face it Lesbian sisters who are also incestuous to each other.
1279;marlene Dietrich was right in her assumptions about the Academy Awards and who wins them.
1280;She claimed that when an actress played an invalid, a person with a mental illness, or an ugly person, the actress was assured an Oscar.
1281;This prediction has come true with Kidman.
1282;The extent of her performance is staring into the distance with a cigarette in her mouth and one minor outburst with her husband.
1283;It redeems itself with wonderfully re.
1284;created historical sets and costumes.
1285;"nicole Kidman is the standout as Virginia Woolf, the early 20th Century British novelist both ahead of and trapped by her era, embarking upon writing her book, ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" which she believes will fully distinguish her genius."
1286;but the performances carry the movie past the indulgences.
1287;Kidman, as Woolf, stalks her brooding scenes as if she's in her final role .
1288;Daldry likes how Kidman smokes a cigarette so much, he shows it several times.
1289;Kidman, with a prosthetic nose plastered on to complete the character's transformation, holds her cards close .
1290;Woolf is brilliant, and slightly mad, and good at concealing her moods .
1291;"Kidman controls this performance
1292;moore and Streep, obviously, inhabit smaller roles.
1293;What I love about Streep is her willingness to let others chew the scenery .
1294;Cunningham, in the novel, allows himself the ability to rustle through the minds of his characters .
1295;whenever he sees fit"
1296;elegant and press his camera into these women's faces.
1297;And what few special effects there are work nicely.
1298;it was a mature, intelligent picture.
1299;The book fills in the remaining blanks, but the meat of the book's power is right there on the screen.
1300;as good as the Artistic production is on this Work, Kidman is just Plain Awful.
1301;and Just as I Loved The Start of SCREAM because Drew was Done away with, it was brilliant that Kidman's Character was appropriately Dispatched.
1302;This is one of the few films I actually thought was better than the book .
1303;Dialogue reaches the human core with familiarity that is both unnerving and amazing.
1304;Great cast, wonderful story about three women trying to define themselves, what they need and if there is a way to obtain it.
1305;Unique and worth the watch.
1306;Superb acting, especially Nicole Kidman.
1307;Very interesting how the storylines of the characters merged.
1308;The Hours was simply my favorite film of 2003 and one of the best in any year for that matter.
1309;I loved, loved, loved this film.
1310;It is beautifully written and directed and so powerfully acted.
1311;The music and cinemaphotgraphy were also at its best.
1312;First you have to give kudos to Michael Cunningham, the author, for writing such a unique and complex story.
1313;I strongly reccomend this to lovers of pure melodrama.
1314;These are all complements, mind you.
1315;Meryl Steep is always a good, very good choice.
1316;Julianne Moore plays another over emotional role but keeps it real.
1317;"well,let's just say Oscar got it right this time
1318;The Hours is profoundly deep, emotional, and satisfying.
1319;The Hours has some fine elements.
1320;It's got the cream of the crop in acting talent and it's beautifully filmed .
1321;certain images will linger in your mind long after you're done watching the movie.
1322;Of the three story lines, Virginia Woolf's was the most moving, because she had to grapple with a real mental illness (and the suicide note she wrote to her husband will bring tears to your eyes).
1323;not to mention utter selfishness and impulsivity.
1324;dance routine, but something that provides some contrast to the general mood of quiet despair, and something that contributes genuine reflection on the characters' actions.
1325;This is a complex, gut.
1326;wrenching look at the inner lives of three women.
1327;Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman recreate an intimate association between Virginia Woolf and her tragic heroine, """"Mrs. Dalloway."""""""
1328;"When Kidman lays her head down on the ground to look into the eyes of a dead bird, one is overcome with a sense of the fraility of life
1329;This movie deserved more than one Academy Award.
1330;I recommend the book, """"Mrs. Dalloway"""" for those who want an in."""
1331;depth look at the soul of one of the greatest British authors of all time.
1332;layered masterpiece, viewers must be warned .
1333;that being said, the acting is superb and the film is a masterful work and a great movie to study for aspiring filmmakers, actors and directors.
1334;but all the actors, from the youngest child on up are at the top of their game.
1335;Her novel reveals much of her inner turmoil .
1336;lover who is in the final stages of full.
1337;the theme that each person is an island and that we all truly die alone is persistent throughout.
1338;"While they know how to ""play the game"" to fit in with ""normal"" society, they are alien to it and play with the though of death as the ""great escape"" from the prison of what their lives have become."
1339;this is a superb film, but it is an experience that is not for the faint of heart.
1340;Toni Collette's performance, while brief, is also powerful.
1341;she has a loving relationship with her partner ,Sally (played by the always wonderful Alison Janney) and her daughter,AJulia(claire daines).
1342;That was amazing how Meryl separated the egg yolks with just her fingers.
1343;Both are brilliant,albiet tortured geniuses that were irreversibly hurt by adults that they trusted.
1344;when in reality,so many people loved them ,warts and all.
1345;The Hours has all of the ingredients of a great film: subtlety, competent acting, good dialogue, great costuming, and Meryl Streep.
1346;"I personally love ""timeline movies"", and this one was very cleverly done."
1347;I received my order in excellent condition.
1348;The movie wasn't what I originally thought it was about but it was outstanding, nonetheless.
1349;The shipment was timely and the service was excellent.
1350;I can understand why this movie got the Oscar for best performing actress, simply because the acting of the three leading ladies are outstanding!
1351;Nicole Kidman is unrecognizable, her make up is great, Julianne Moore has been denied by the award comitee for years, she's a great actress she deserves one already, and Meryl Streep as always saving a play that lack of a true stunning ending, I just lost this movie at the end.
1352;The Academy Awards has done it again.
1353;The result is a continued and reliable box office profit that will persevere through late March if it manages to win a few Oscars.
1354;prize winning author Michael Cunninghams 228.
1355;hour film forfeits a considerable amount of poeticism and personification, a detail that most times cannot be avoided when adapting a book to a movie.
1356;most of Cunninghams beautiful prose is retained in the storys central figure .
1357;caliber performance that not only well warrants her nomination for Best Actress this year but tops that of her nomination last year for Moulin Rouge.
1358;Ed Harris comes off a little inadequate as Richard the most memorable aspect of his character is the incredible job the films make.
1359;up, The Hours contains some subtle but remarkable transformations, most notably Ed Harris haggard physique and Kidmans transformation into the 40.
1360;Moore gets quite a transformation as well, her character showing up once more towards the end with a considerably aged face (60s to 70s, if I had to guess).
1361;The Hours may be the best dramatic movie I've ever seen.
1362;They kind of derisively laughed at the screen.
1363;It's that kind of movie.
1364;at its core, The Hours is simply about a human being's capacity/incapacity to reciprocate love in the face of death.
1365;it's a universal theme and in the case of Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore and Ed Harris's characters in the film, they represent an extreme .
1366;meryl Streep's character is the most realized in that the character drawn for her *sees* both sides of the range (love in the face of death) and comes to some kind of affirming end.
1367;The final scene between them was so intense as to be palpable.
1368;They are simply two of the best actors I have ever seen.
1369;Nicole Kidman was so good I did not even recognize it was her playing Virginia Wolff for the first few minutes in the film.
1370;I had trouble getting through this beautiful film that others seem to cherish.
1371;Some of us are just born heterosexual, in fact most of us are, so deal with it!
1372;I think it's hilarious to call this a beautiful film .
1373;Boasting an exemplary cast, purposeful direction, authentic production values, and a haunting musical score, The Hours is a sincere praiseworthy attempt to adapt Michael Cunningham's prize.
1374;winning novel to the screen.
1375;It is provocative, introspective, hopeful, and at times downright desolate.
1376;As evidenced by the opening sequence, the value of life itself is called into question and it sets the tone for the rest of the film.
1377;The sequences in each of their lives are carefully interwoven throughout the movie, enhancing their parallel struggles.
1378;the Hours is skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry and contains some of the finest performances of the year.
1379;however it is Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Virginia Woolf that is the most mesmerizing and transforming performance in the film.
1380;She is completely submerged as the famous novelist of the early twentieth century.
1381;To the contrary, it enhances her performance and allows her characterization of Virginia Woolf to fully emerge.
1382;"The movie does a wonderful job of drawing the connections (what Daldrey calls ""leitmotifs"" in his and Cunningham's interesting commentary track) between the 3 central characters."
1383;Daldrey's camera and Hare's script, combined with Philip Glass's score (which is so affecting it almost literally becomes a character in the story) combine to create an integrated effort of real beauty and honesty.
1384;Daldrey's theater background allows him to do truly magical things with his actors, particularly the boy who plays Richie.
1385;"style dramatics in ""big"" scenes such as the Virginia."
1386;The final passage, while beautifully written, is Hare's version of Woolf, which is a little audacious.
1387;The movie succeeds brilliantly in being 3 stories of depression that are never themselves depressing.
1388;To the contrary, the movie contains an eloquent and emotionally persuasive argument for suicide as a way of living one's life with complete freedom.
1389;It allows us to explore the remarkable notion that sadness is not only a part of life, but an experience that sharpens our appreciation for it, and its evental end.
1390;It speaks to the sense that the experience of life can, if properly lived, reach to a place that is (in what may be Woolf's own phrase) beyond language.
1391;The images, the music, the words, and the actors all work to get to that remarkable place.
1392;To this extent, the movie is not only an improvement on the novel, but is an artistic and emotional triumph.
1393;And absolutely brilliant in the process of deconstruction it forces the viewer (or reader.
1394;i found it very true to the rhythm and depth of the book) to go through in order to reach the other side.
1395;there are moments in this film that I have thought about nearly every day since first seeing it in 2003, and it still comes up in conversation on a regular basis.
1396;I have, however, stopped recommending it to just anyone.
1397;I have found that many people are afraid to empathize with disturbed characters, or question their own morality and life choices.
1398;i find inner journeys to be the most compelling, and being an audio learner, this was a beautiful movie to listen to as well.
1399;As gorgeous as she is, she has always come across to me as someone who has this sort of quiet, dark part.
1400;depressive waves of his character with energy and vividness, and 3.
1401;His face carries the combination of incomprehension and intuitive knowing that young children can have.
1402;As for the rest of the film, you have a bunch of other reviews to read!
1403;2002 review:I loved this movie!
1404;I thought it was superbly done.
1405;It reminded me of MAGNOLIA in the way it intertwined the stories together, and how they all came together.
1406;It was a very moving, powerful film with EXCELLENT performances.
1407;Nicole Kidman was AWESOME as Virginia Woolf and Julianne Moore was mesmerizing.
1408;It is a film that really makes you think, and as you're watching it, you realize that at one point in your life, you have felt like these characters before.
1409;"To fully grasp the themes of the film, it helps to have read both Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and Cunningham's ""The Hours"" in order to understand the psychology of the characters and the reasoning behind their life choices."
1410;Some will argue with the film's humanist worldview, but as far as I can tell, these emotions are real, these situations are real, and they happen every day.
1411;every time I see this film, it's as though I see it through new eyes.
1412;I always gain a fresh perspective, and this has much to do with the fact that I am older, and have gained much more life experience than when I first saw the film years ago.
1413;Everything about the film bursts with life, from the beautiful cinematography, to the acting, the Philip Glass' beautiful score.
1414;This film works on so many levels.
1415;The scene where she is baking the cake is one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history.
1416;Instead, watch this movie to see how a story should be told, to be reminded of the struggles we all have in life to love and be loved, and the impact the choices that we make have on those around us.
1417;This is one of the most honest movies I have ever seen and because of that, ranks as one of my top ten favorite movies of all time.
1418;Thankfully, in the hands of writer David Hare and director Stephen Daldry, it's an emotional powerhouse that enthralls from opening to final frame.
1419;winning literary ones, is a challenging business.
1420;But David Hare's wonderful screenplay grabs the bull by the horns, boldly re.
1421;Moving seamlessly between three time periods, he delicately interweaves the emotional lives of three women.
1422;Such subtlety is helped enormously by the superb performances Daldry extracts from the actors.
1423;This is truly an actor's movie, and it's blessed with an extraordinary cast.
1424;Nicole Kidman has been the focus of most of the publicity and Oscar.
1425;Meryl Streep is, as always, effortlessly perfect.
1426;Kidman deserves the Best Actress award.
1427;Some have criticized this as a rather humorless portrait of Woolf, with Kidman's performance failing to capture the wit and the charm of the great writer.
1428;It's more a film about her work and its impact than it is about Woolf's own personality.
1429;"And in that sense, ""The Hours"" succeeds brilliantly."
1430;"Stephen Daldry's ""The Hours"" is one of the more courageous and thought."
1431;provoking cinematic works of recent years.
1432;All three women project strong facades to the outer world although each of them is suffering inside.
1433;This film provides unique, but indirect, insights into the female experience through nuance and metaphor.
1434;The cast is astonishing with Kidman, Moore, and Streep all showing why they are considered three of the best actresses working today.
1435;The supporting cast of Stephen Dillane, John C. Reilly, Allison Janney, Claire Danes, Ed Harris have enough talent themselves to headline their own film but distinguish themselves well in strong supporting performances.
1436;Mention must also be made of Philip Glass' musical score which works to accentuate the strong emotional states of the film's various characters.
1437;"All in all, ""The Hours"" is an impressive feat of filmmaking that will not easily fade from memory."
1438;I really enjoyed this rather dark and sad movie.
1439;It really made me go into my inner self and look at what is really important in life and what makes me happy.
1440;she really should have won the Oscar!
1441;The other actors were brilliant as well.
1442;so I must say that it definitely goes into the chick flick group.
1443;But I found it haunting and thought provoking.
1444;The three leading actresses gave outstanding performances which I enjoyed very much.
1445;line kept me from really enjoying the movie.
1446;Much of the story of Virginia herself is based on historical events, and Nicole Kidman does a fine performance in portraying Virginia's psyche and her actual life.
1447;Julianne Moore is terrific in her role as the perfect 50's housewife without a life.
1448;Meryl Streep is real, believable, and demonstrates how many women feel in our culture.
1449;as outstanding as the performances are, this movie does bring you down, and can be very sad and gloomy.
1450;The story and the performace of Virginia Wolff gave me the greatest impact because of her depicting of the Bipolar Disorders.
1451;One of Nicole Kidman's best performances.
1452;Meryl Streep and Johanna Moore are equally riveting.
1453;I went into the theatre without a great deal of enthusiasm, expecting three remarkable divas to do a great deal of talking elliptically with many pregnant pauses accompanied by meaningful staring into space.
1454;"i am happy to have to discard my unkind premonitions and admit a delight and awe for ""The Hours."""
1455;It is a visual treat from the beautiful English countryside to the lush palms of 50's suburban L. a. to Clarissa's funky brownstone in 2001 New York City.
1456;Ms. Moore's tremendous restraint gave a powerful, suffocating tension to her role that overwhelmed me with its brilliance.
1457;My companion thought Ms. Streep was radiant.
1458;the supporting cast were each a star in their own right, they were so perfect in their roles.
1459;I couldn't help but smile at the thought of how much Ed Harris must have enjoyed the all.
1460;I hope the costumier, Ann Roth, is awarded her Oscar for the beautiful authenticity of the attire.
1461;She even remembered that silk hose, lovely as they are, DO tend to wrinkle.
1462;The score, while charming, got a bit intrusive at times.
1463;"There was a moment or two when I felt a strong desire to say, ""Live for the moment!"
1464;This film had the power to do something very few films can do today and that is, give the audiece some more credit and give them some more to think about afterwards.
1465;In the great tradition of Mr. David Lynch I believe that we don't always need to be spoon fed the answers.
1466;The human person is far more complex then to just sum things up in a neat package.
1467;Women are complex and beautiful creatures.
1468;I thought this was a striking film and simply one of the best of the year.
1469;Each performance was just an eye opening experience, and the cross over from past to present was very reminiscent of another great film of 2002, Adaptation.
1470;in a time where movies are far too straight forward and peddle the audience with easy answers it's nice to see that film's still leave themselves open to interpretation.
1471;When you can answer all the questions that come up in your life abouts sadness and joy then come back to this film and ridicule it, but if you cannot I suggest you watch it again and admire it for what it doesn't answer.
1472;"in"" of the characters meaningful."
1473;The photography, direction, art direction and acting definitely made the difference.
1474;I also thoroughly enjoyed Toni Collette (always hot), Stephen Dillane (the train depot scene was perhaps the film's best), Allison Janney (remarkably sexy) and Claire Danes (remarkably good)?
1475;All actors/actresses carried their roles extremely well.
1476;This type of film can walk a fine line between brilliant and unbearable (in this case it's closer to brilliant).
1477;All three female leads navel gaze and contemplate suicide.

1486;"Kidman digs deep into the angst and despair of Woolf
1487;Moore's scenes with her young son are crushing and heartbreaking"
1488;And Streep, is, as ever, a powerhouse.
1489;But the real star of the movie is director Daldry, who extracts great performances, and does a wonderful job at bringing the screenplay to life.
1490;good movie, and the recurring themes of suicide and despair may put off some.
1491;But it's no doubt one of the best films of 2002.
1492;Almost every actor had a top notch performance going.
1493;I was pleased overall with the film.
1494;I enjoyed all the acting, it was incredible thespien tour.
1495;Nicole Kidman has sure proved herself to be a brilliant performer.
1496;The camera angle was incredible and evoked just the right emotion it was trying to convey.
1497;This film's underlying theme is death, but it approaches this dark subject matter with grace and dignity.
1498;A well made film that the actors and director should be proud of.
1499;This movie has perfect acting by three talented women.
1500;The story was a beautiful reflection on life's trials and choices we make.
1501;The movie moved me all the way through.
1502;I enjoyed this very much.
1503;The Hours is so rich, hypnotic, subtle and true, it grapples with the existential angst of life head on while recognizing that every moment is a gift and each response, a choice.
1504;The lives of these three women are woven together with amazing skill.
1505;Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman each give Oscar worthy performances.
1506;This is a great film and it deserves to be appreciated.
1507;It only gets richer with every viewing.
1508;Like a visionary, Virginia Woolf knows that one can not find peace by avoiding life, so always, to look life in the face, know it, love it, and put it away.
1509;The movie is so rich of what life really means.
1510;depth movie I have ever seen.

1512;There is a surprising ending.

1514;"This movie and ""American Beauty"" are in the same boat."
1515;Rarely does one across a film faithfully adopted from an award.
1516;winning and critically praised book .
1517;Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer winning novel is competently made into an Oscar winning movie that is truly outstanding.
1518;Nonetheless, as simple as it seems, it is one of the most emotionally intense movies you could expect from a spectacular leading cast of Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman.
1519;It is a question of life and happiness.
1520;Being identified as a happy person doesn?t necessarily mean that you are happy.
1521;Happiness is something you found within, but it is also a decision of whether you want to let it out or trap it inside.
1522;The process for searching for true happiness and relief is never easy, for you have to know what you want first, which is the catalyst to true happiness.
1523;You may not agree with the ways these characters chose to break through their lives, but feeling the love, pain and happiness within them is the main focus of the movie.
1524;Without doubt, all Meryl, Julianne and Nicole put on a spectacular show in front of the audience.
1525;You may have personal favour for anyone of them, but they are all unquestionably great in the movie.
1526;Their acting is detailed and delicate.
1527;Apart from the leading cast, the movie also has a very strong supporting cast ?
1528;Toni Collette, Claire Danes, John C. Reilly, Ed Harris etc., which added so much colour and life to the whole movie.
1529;Their performances are so natural and beautiful and finely tuned.
1530;The Hours may be emotionally intense and draining, but it would be a movie that touches the deepest part of your heart.
1531;Also, not to be missed out is the beautifully composed soundtrack that fits into every single corner of the screenplay.
1532;This film was unusual, but touching.
1533;It's themes were peculiar and unparalleled, yet enlightening.
1534;You may not agree with the ideas expressed regarding the essential aspects of this particular film, however the superb acting, original plot, and emotional impact that this masterpeice will have on you makes this a film worth watching.
1535;The artistic nature of the film will make way for deep rational thinking, and ultimately touch your heart.
1536;This is a complex and nuanced story that is translated to film in a very effective way.
1537;The scene shifts which gradually reveal the nature of the interrelationships among these women (both symbolic and real) are incredibly well directed, and the three stars are all superb.
1538;There are several additional excellent performaces, especially Ed Harris as the dying writer and friend of Vaughn for whom she is having a party (which mirrors the parties in the hours we experience in the lives of the other two women).
1539;And John C. Reilly does a great job as her seemingly clueless husband, recreating his role in CHICAGO without the musical routines.
1540;While the cinematography is striking and the scene cuts among the three time periods well edited, there is an incredible amount of information for the viewer to absorb and little time to contemplate the events.
1541;My sole caution is that this is a movie that is entertaining but not uplifting.
1542;My wife enjoyed the movie and was completely absorbed by the story and the powerful emotions that it elicted.
1543;The Hours is probably one of the best films I have watched this year(2003) It is a film that should be treasured by anyone who watches it.
1544;But it also had its great moments.
1545;Nicole Kidman was great in an almost unrecognizable role.
1546;Julianne Moore's story line was perhaps the weakest and more boring, but she did a fine job.
1547;Meryl Streep is perfect, as always.
1548;It is definetetly woth a viewing.
1549;Yes, it's Virginia Wolfe, and yes it's Streep, Kidman and Moore, all very well respected actors.
1550;I absolutely love the movies.
1551;I am seduced by good plots and great characterizations.
1552;I loved this film, so emotionally honest and portraying the realities of these characters lives.
1553;I found it of note that they did not ever mention the well known fact that Woolf had been molested perhaps as early as six, having suffered at the hands of two step brothers.
1554;i still would recommend this movie to anyone, The acting is astoundingly good.
1555;very profound and it touches on how everyday life can be so difficult for some people.
1556;the entire film is beautifully done, the actors give wonderful performances, I would say that this is the best work ever done by nicole kidman and julianne moore.
1557;Recently I viewed the movie, The Hours starring Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Ed Harris and Julianne Moore.
1558;Virginia is portrayed by Nicole Kidman and she does a wonderful job showing the essence of Virginia's depression and self.
1559;A brilliant writer who involves all of your senses in her prose she succumbs to the artist's tendency to be self.
1560;In Laura's eyes you see her sadness and her desperate need to leave but she stays, unhappily, like a servant.
1561;the music and the language of the film inspire creative juices, especially the scenes where Virginia Woolf is speaking.
1562;Having read the book first I was able to experience more than the film managed to contain although the film was more easily explained.
1563;I recommend both expressions for the full impact of these desperate women and the lives they lead.
1564;It is a beautifully written, directed, acted movie.
1565;I ordered the sound track right after I saw the movie.
1566;It is such wonderfully emotional music.
1567;At the end, one chooses life, one chooses death and one chooses love.
1568;This is by far the best movie I have ever seen.
1569;This film perfectly weaves the three time periods so exquisitly that the message and emotion the book and movie try to create are there at every moment.
1570;I think that a lot critics either saw it as a chick flick or thought it was boring, but if you look at the certain detail of every scene and every actress, you will find a treasure.
1571;this movie can be a confusing setting, but the way director Stephen Daldry crafted the plots makes it a clear film.
1572;Nicole Kidman proves herself to be a magnificent actress that is versatile and will continue to show her skill.
1573;pain spill out and manifest itself in one of the most spectacular scenes of the movie.
1574;Moore was the second best of three.
1575;She literally is living for Richard.
1576;Every day she goes to see him, and feed him, and care for him.
1577;She has yet to learn what it is to live for herself.
1578;throughout the rest of the film there are many smaller performances that caught my eye.
1579;She is a confident woman that suffers but does not show it.
1580;Collette has an ability to really portray these feelings so well.
1581;Another great supporting performance was Ed Harris'.
1582;John C. Reilly, the boy playing Laura Brown's son and Claire Daines all had shining moments.
1583;bottom Line: Everything about the making of this film and everything about the acting and the writing were all so hauntingly beautiful it stops you in your tracks and makes you realize that this is a classic of film making.
1584;I love this movie .
1585;Captured and kept my attention throughout.
1586;The Hours is one the greatest examples in film history of three actresses in the same film achieving Oscar level pinnacles.
1587;based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Michael Cunningham, the story revolves around the creative act of novelist Virginia Woolf, played by Kidman, writing her most memorable work, Mrs. Dalloway, along with the impact that work had on other people at later points in time.
1588;While Streep seeks to enhance Harris' desire to live by telling him that, by taking his pills he can live a good while longer, he reflects on what he sees as the hopelessness of his condition.
1589;top British dramatist David Hare adapted Cunningham's novel superbly, giving a brilliantly cerebral written work a visual feel, while Steven Daldry directed with a skilled but never interfering hand, letting the brilliant performers establish their own respective voices.
1590;What makes this film so unique is the way that a creative artist's impact is shown through the lives of people at another point in time living in another country, who are sensitively attuned to the pain the author felt as she grappled with the question of life and whether or not to continue living it.
1591;I must say that I loved this movie a great deal, and I saw it at the theater 2 times, but I saw Frida 5 times.
1592;I am very pleased with the cast, art direction, director, and oringinal score.
1593;Kidman was better in her other films including The Others, Moulin Rouge, and her breakthrough To Die For.
1594;"This beautiful and artsy ""heavy."
1595;If you embrace this film, you will be profoundly moved.
1596;Wolfe's book not only made an impact on Laura Brown, it also affected the lives of a the readers of modern day include Laura Brown's son Richard, a writer played by the scene.
1597;Clarissa gets nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by Richard, because she loves to throw parties.
1598;in the day of Virginia, she gets a visit from her sister(played by the mesmerizing Miranda Richardson), and her children.
1599;While she was lounging with them, her mind was in the world of Mrs. Dalloway, and her sister was overwhelmed that she's still so eccentric and unstable.
1600;in the day of Laura Brown, she's heavily pregnant, and she spends the day at home with her son Richard.
1601;She reads Mrs. Dalloway, and was moved by it a great deal.
1602;Her neighbor Kitty comes over to ask her to take care of her dog when she goes to the hospital.
1603;", and she's quite striking, especially when she engages a ""lesbian kiss"" with Julianne Moore."
1604;other supporting roles are well played by Allison Janney(Clarissa's lover), Stephen Dillane(Wolfe's unconditional.
1605;loving husband), and Claire Danes(Clarissa's daughter).
1606;i was very moved by Ed Harris role and performance.
1607;The scene when he committed suicide in front of Clarissa was so powerful.
1608;As for Nicole Kidman, the scene at the train station was her best in this movie.
1609;She's very meticulous with the mannerism, even though she doesn't totally looked like Virginia Wolfe.
1610;She's captivately when her mind is doing multiple thinking.
1611;Overall, Julianne Moore's crying scenes are more compelling to watch, because she's more vulnerable of the three.
1612;Draws you in with a surprise ending.
1613;One of the top contenders for the Best Picture Oscar this year, is The Hours, a story based on Michael Cunnigham's novel that takes a creative outtake on the penning of Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway.
1614;The first woman presented to us is Virginia Woolf , played by Nicole Kidman who is almost unrecognizable in her prosthetic nose.
1615;Unfolding in parallel to Woolf's story is another about a 50's housewife, played by Julian Moore.
1616;On the appearance she seems to have a perfect life, with a doting husband, an adorable son, and another child on the way.
1617;cutting one another, but as they progress forward, two of them start to converge, and ultimately it provides the audience with a surprising closure.
1618;the greatest forte of the film is in the acting.
1619;It is little surprise that all three of its leading actresses garnered an Oscar nomination this year for their roles.
1620;Meryl Streep, a proven veteran in the field, is effective as the modern.
1621;Julianne Moore, another top performer commanding the admiration of many, is chilling as the suburban housewife on the brink of self.
1622;But it's Ms. Kidman who will be creating much of the Oscar buzz.
1623;Overlooked last year for her excellent dual performances in Moulin Rouge and The Others, Kidman is the strongest contender for Best Actress this year as the academy has a tendency to bestow a reparative Oscar to those they unintentionally overlooked.
1624;all in all I liked The Hours because it is in essence a well crafted drama with an engaging storyline backed by strong, grounded performances.
1625;But be that as it may, it is nevertheless impressive how the director handles the many weighty issues in a manner that captures the essence of what Virginia Woolf tried to say in her novel: the transience of our lives, the sacrifices the society sometimes forces on women, the feeling of obligation to others, to norms and to conventions, and freedom, without which the only alternative is death.
1626;all this, shown in a day in the life of three women.
1627;i found the movie a beautiful poem of life and hope , one that will keep you going through tough times.
