1;I've always been interested in the sinking of titanic and this movie was absolutlely amazing!!
2;The main reason I watched this again was because I love the period costumes, hairstyles and jewelry and beautifully designed sets.
3;Still, it's a good movie to watch on a rainy Saturday evening with a big bowl of popcorn.
4;The images of the titanic are just so clear, crisp, and just put right into ship.
5;This copy comes with some amazing extras of the behind the scenes of the making and also of the actual titanic itself.
6;Such a great film, and not that old, and they couldnt even include a single commentary or interview.
7;I was perhaps too young the first time, but it is an amazing film that will live in your heart forever.
8;ray and I was very excited when it did.
9;It looks amazing on Blu.
10;I highly recommend upgrading to Blu.
11;sexual nude scene), and an ignored, great performance by Billy Zane who played Winslet s violent tempered fiance.
12;When I saw it I yelled Yea right!
13;i would recommend this movie to those who can aviod the sappy love story and pay attention to the rousing scenes that focus on the ship.
14;this is what I call emotional intensity .
15;and greater the emotional intensity, greater the role and importance of values in the lives of the people involved.
16;It is about the opening up of the soul of a young, spirited girl disgusted with convention and conformity .
17;To live life happily one must love life, to love it one must have a particular view of life .
18;Titanic portrays a wide spectrum of human emotions with an amazing force, vividness and effectiveness.
19;passionate love and obsessive jealousy, frustration and depression, youthful exuberance and a sense of flight, fear and courage, yearning and despair, cruelty and horror.
20;each emotion has a depth, intensity and sense of drama which radiates a warmth that has touched millions of hearts around the world and makes the viewer one with the characters in their feelings.
21;"In this depiction of human joy and suffering against the backdrop of one of the most heartrending tragedies of our times, combined with an overpowering suspense and adventure, lies the universal appeal of ""Titanic""Apart from the visual effects and background score which are marvelous, I loved the artistry and execution of various scenes."
22;As for the `car' scene: it was presented in a manner which conveyed sensuality, passion and tenderness .
23;the comedy is subtle, delightful and witty .
24;in addition, the performances were very good .
25;I've yet to see anything to match them in all cinema (in terms of the emotions they evoke, their dramatic effect, grandeur and artistry) and the scene in which Rose leaves her lifeboat and returns to Jack (dramatizing the intensity of her passion).
26;"in short, ""Titanic"" is one of the best films I've ever seen and hope to see."
27;I'd undoubtedly call it one of my favorite films.
28;This is a disc to show your friends.
29;Another fantastic and superbly written movie about the historical event in 1912 by James Cameron.
30;This provides romance, action, drama, and suspense.
31;I highly recommend this movie if you are a history buff or if you are just a person who is in love with either Leonardo Dicaprio or Kate Winslet.
32;Titanic is one of my favorite movies, and this special collector's edition is perfect for me.
33;there is so much extra material.
34;I highly recommend this product
35;WellThis was great I loved the features and the deleted scenesand watched the making which was amazing
36;Excellence services , waiting time fast and quick ,nice packaging, with material and product was in good shapebravo.
37;i wouldnt let your kids watch it.
38;leo has a whole plethora of movies.
39;I was always more interested in the look of the story and the extreme level of detail put into the movie.
40;The included extras should be great.
41;Am a huge KW fan after seeing her in this and The Reader.
42;Titanic is part chick flick and action movie and does both well.
43;His politics aside, his commentary during the movie is first rate.
44;The tons of extra features are worth the cost of the BD itself.
45;I'm no expert on the matter, but just from the way I saw it, I thought the depth was great.
46;This film was a classic the moment it was put into the can and released.
47;The fictionalized account to the two lovers with the added drama of personal interactions of the participants and adversaries, both heroes and dogs made this particular story really engrossing and dramatically impressive.
48;( Anyway, this is an excellent film.
49;I recommend it highly for each and every family.
50;It's just an excellent film.
51;Within a few days, we played it.
52;The sound and video were superb, as good as when we saw it in the theater the first time.
53;Faultlessly performed by the two leads (Dicaprio is good, Winslett is better if you wish to compare them), expertly paced (with fine story telling finesse by director Cameron) and gripping from start to finish.
54;Just like my title said, it is a great romantic film about class.
55;He was the one that told Rose about the insufficient amount of boats.
56;He just seems like a man of high integrity and very responsible, but he should have put a lot of boats.
57;The director could have cut a lot of corners to save money, but the film is worth watching just to see the wonderful recreation of the ship, the period.
58;authentic costumes and so on.
59;The sound track, a pleasure in itself, adds to the experience without shattering the nerves.
60;It is inspiring to see so many brave women characters in the film.
61;The director makes excellent use of imagery.
62;The many subtle, recurring themes, such as hands : poker, the drawings, the car window, and our last glimpse of the sinking hero, to name just a few of the obvious ones, make watching the movie one more time a fascinating experience.
63;The movie has thousands of secrets, details and surprises which make it a real work of art.
64;It is true to live, yet bigger than life, and the beauty is in the details.
65;This is my favourite work of all, especially since it deals personally with my own life.
66;Titanic was a work a long time coming, and it took at least five years of constant work for the people, amazing people, to work on this incredible picture.
67;despite the people who are skeptical, to me, the power of Compassion is demonstrated in this movie beyond any other, In a love story.
68;and for me, that's the hallmark of the whole film.
69;the best part of it for me was that nothing of it was left out, creating a monster three hour long movie in a four act play of sorts, and including all the disasters necessary for beauty to shine through, despite whatever cost it took to get it right.
70;"The music is more than delivered
I:30;71;ray player, I knew I had to pick this up as one of the first movies I watch.
I:30;72;On top of the movie itself, the bonus features are incredible, I was fairly certain the content wouldn't be features I hadn't seen, but they most definitely were.
I:30;73;I cheered at that point.
I:30;74;bought it for my niese she wanted to lern some faly history so i bought her this one i like it good one to get
I:30;75;Movie is filled with comedy and romance!
I:30;76;Perfect for a night in with your loved ones!
I:30;77;Highly recommend to the couples out there
I:30;78;One of my favorite movie this is.
I:30;79;It was delivered very fast in a good condition.
I:30;80;Very clean and it works well.
I:30;81;these are really great and you will be very happy to see them!!
I:30;82;I thought that Leonardo Di Caprio was cute and Kate Winslow was charming.
I:30;83;I felt goosebumps when Jack screamed: I am the king of the world!
I:30;84;Great effects, beautiful wardrobe, but pleeease: How many times can you see that ship sink.
I:30;85;for many the name is synonimous with the greates grossing film of all time.
I:30;86;To others like me, it will be a memento of times gone by, and first love.
I:30;87;It has its own identity and place in history.
I:30;88;Cameron is a great director capable of communicating a simple love story across into our own time.
I:30;89;James Horner's score is haunting in all it's beauty.
I:30;90;Kate Winslet's Rose is a portrayal to be admired, she is Rose.
I:30;91;Her acting and her sensibility bring a certain nobleness and romance to her character.
I:30;92;This movie is a masterpiece and it should be admired for its sincerity and realism.
I:30;93;Titanic was one of the biggest and beloved films of 1997, and after a decade later, this blockbuster still satisfies the audience.
I:30;94;Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are a perfect match in this romantic drama.
I:30;95;Directed by James Cameron, this film was delayed and critics thought this film would sink but it became a monster hit and won many Academy Awards including best picture.
I:30;96;Titanic is one film that everyone should own, it's funny, moving, and sensational.
I:30;97;There is really nothing good to say about this.
I:30;98;He has a huge head and even Celine Dion has a more manly body.
I:30;99;Titanic is a romantic, adventurous, and a thrilling movie all combined into one to make the perfect movie.
I:30;100;It contains moments of exuberance, humor, and tragedy.
I:30;101;In their own way, the characters are all larger than life, but they're human enough to capture our sympathy.
I:30;102;Titanic has all of the thrills and intensity that movie.
I:30;103;A dazzling mix of style and substance, of the sublime and the spectacular, Titanic represents Cameron's most accomplished work to date.
I:30;104;Although this edition of the Titanic story is far from the first, it is the most memorable, and is the most deserved for Oscar nominations not only in the technical categories, but in the more substantive ones of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress because they all did a magnificent job.
I:30;105;I'll take A Clockwork Orange over this any day.
I:30;106;I'll take Pulp Fiction over this any day.
I:30;107;I'll take Basquiat over this any day.
I:30;108;Later, Someone obviously better than you
I:30;109;But it was every bit as amazing and moving and incredible to watch.
I:30;110;An amazing experience for all ages!
I:30;111;Titanic is the best movie I have ever seen.
I:30;112;this movie was the most emotional movie I have ever seen.
I:30;113;It is the best just to look at.
I:30;114;The love story and music make you care about what's going on, draw you in to the sinking as if you are there.
I:30;115;this is the best movie of all time.
I:30;116;titanic is my favorite movie.
I:30;117;It definitely deserved all the Oscar nominations and awards it recieved.
I:30;118;James Cameron should be very pleased with himself.
I:30;119;Thank you, Mr. Cameron, for giving us all this movie.
I:30;120;This is one of the best movies of all time.
I:30;121;Bravo to James Cameron and all involved, this is one must see film that really is mind blowing.
I:30;122;A film that will still be applauded in decades to come and if you are one of the few who haven't experienced it (you actually experience this film rather than just see it) add it to your must watch list.
I:30;123;truly one of the greatest films of the tragic sinking ever put together.
I:30;124;Titanic has always been one of my hidden favorit films, meaning, a film that i love very much, but being a 22 year old male, would never amit to my friends.
I:30;125;Its because i studied the ship extensively as a child, and the film managed to capture historical fact and romance and blend them into a realistic story.
I:30;126;Im finally happy cameron and paramount got there act together and is putting out a 3 disc set.
I:30;127;To this day, I still find it to be one of the most remarkable movies I have ever seen.
I:30;128;It truly is a classic of our time, and it's nice to see that it's finally being treated as one.
I:30;129;This is just a good movie and I have always been intrigued by anything related to the Titanic.
I:30;130;It Was a wonderful movie!
I:30;131;The best movie I ever semen in my entier life!!!!
I:30;132;The fact that the 4 disc set provides a regular Blu ray option as well as the digital copy only adds to the value.
I:30;133;Highly recommended as an addition to ones film library.
I:30;134;ray, and Digital format just means I can take this fantastic movie everywhere I go!!!
I:30;135;Look at it this way, you get to watch Leonardo diCaprio die, that's worth the price of admission.
I:30;136;I'm a stereoscopic geek, so my plan was to watch the movie and constantly judge the job the artists did.
I:30;137;James Cameron's 1997 Titanic is, of course, the biggest box office hit of all time, edging out such blockbuster films as E. t., Star Wars, and Jurassic Park for that title.
I:30;138;This film, with its tale of star.
I:30;139;crossed lovers Rose and Jack intertwined with the real.
I:30;140;life tragedy of the Royal Mail Steamer Titanic, won 11 Academy Awards and the loyalty of its millions of fans.
I:30;141;wide audiences embraced this touching and technically brilliant movie.Yes, this first movie to reap $1 billion in box office gross did capture the hearts of millions of teenage girls who repeated screenings to see Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack Dawson woo Kate Winslet's feisty socialite (and soon.
I:30;142;this film has much going for it.
I:30;143;Titanic also has a great musical score and incredible visuals: the sinking of the great liner is certainly realistic .
I:30;144;Thankfully, in spite of the media hype and negative publicity, Titanic proved to be a good and entertaining film.
I:30;145;I recommend it to anyone who likes love stories or epic disaster films.
I:30;146;This movie mixes both genres very well.
I:30;147;Extraordinary from all other movies.
I:30;148;All the actors had perfect performances.
I:30;149;:3 This is definitely a MUCH better love story than Romeo and Juliet and WAY better than the Twilight series.
I:30;150;The story of the Titanic had always fascinated me, so when I heard that James Cameron was making a movie about it, I expected a real treat.
I:30;151;But that aside, the last hour and a half are fantastic.
I:30;152;Yeah, the perfect chick flick.
I:30;153;while it could seem longer, it is better than other editions, you have to getthis if you, like my wife love this movie.
I:30;154;it looks awesome, it sound great and will be prfect while the family is gathering in a holiday.
I:30;155;is there really new interesting historical material other than the usual 'extras' ?
I:30;156;i love this one main reason it all happen.
I:30;157;No visible scratches on the disks and the outside appearance is perfect.
I:30;158;This is a movie I can't help but love.
I:30;159;On a lazy day you sneak it out of your collection and enjoy the pure cheesiness, yet granduer of an epic film.
I:30;160;I'm more than curious to see what they do about the 3.
I:30;161;I can't describe how much I love this movie, its a classic and there will never be one like it again.
I:30;162;This product deserves fifteen million stars for how well it was written and performed.
I:30;163;Now every time I watch this movie I feel my eyes brimming with tears.
I:30;164;Anyone who loves a romantic/comedy/mystery will adore this movie!
I:30;165;Don't get me wrong, I think romance movies are great (one of my all.
I:30;166;time favorite movies is """"Casablanca"""")."""
167;the actual story of Titanic's sinking is incredible, and there are so many fascinating facts about it.
168;Great addition to my library.
169;ray fans all around, let me start off by sayingthis is one of the best looking blu.
170;rayreleases so far, the best looking blu.
171;feature film + special features, disc 2.
172;feature film part.1, disc 2 .
173;I loved this movie so, so much!
174;It honestly made me cry it was made so, so, so beautifully.
175;I am glad to have this for my collection I love this movie but I bought it for my husband for christmas, the movie works great and my husband we be happy to have it as well thank you
176;It is a great movie!We love it!The only thing is I wanted it in full screen and we could only find widescreen.
177;Titanic is a film that wants to be an epic like Citizen Kane or even The Sound of Music .
178;One of the best movies I have ever seen!
179;Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio are amazing and the reality of the story around them is phenomenal.
180;James Cameron is a genius!
181;Wonderful cast of characters, wonderful cinematography.
182;Always a great movie to watch when you just want to stay in and watch a movie!
183;released but this disc set is still my favorite to watch it on.
184;The packaging is very nice.
185;I received this product on Monday and went to watch it, at least part one, last night.
186;First off I liked the movie.
187;undoubtedly there will be a 2.3 disc Special Edition or Directors Cut at the 10th anniversary.
188;very good, the romantic history, I love that M
189;I seen all of titanic movie but my fav is this once with Leonardo DiCaprio the one that play Rose will bring out her role in the movie.
190;Have watched three times and still finding new things to see.
191;Still have 30 more views to beat the original.
192;Awesome is all I can say.
193;My granddaughter and I watched it together for the second time and the music, the fun, the romance.
194;The 2D blu ray faired better and was remastered well.
195;Thanks for making us wait 6 years for the special edition.
196;And Europe and Latin America are getting it as part of their set and we in America, (and it was an American Film!)
197;Titanic is best movie that I have seen.
198;It is exciting, sad and romanic.
199;Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful in their role as Jack and Rose.
200;Titanic is my favorite movie.
201;"The historical story of RMS Titanic is both tragic and fascinating
I:30;202;taken at face value, the history is so replete with human interest, with character and with raw story that a simple and accurate telling of the events that culminated in the Titanic tragedy would have made a more compelling, more interesting and more appropriate movie than what James Cameron brought to the screen as TITANIC.Yes, this is definitely a disaster movie.
I:30;203;And that's just the movie itself.
I:30;204;They deserved something far more accurate and far better than this.
I:30;205;while it's laughable that this movie garnered so many Academy Awards (Best Picture among them) the special effects of how Titanic sank were definitely worthy of the Oscar and are well worth a watch.
I:30;206;Take it from me, this is a nice movie to add to your video collection.
I:30;207;The music, sound, and digital effects are beautiful.
I:30;208;I really liked it and I hope you do, too.
I:30;209;It was sooo realistic and my favorite part is at the top of the ship where they stand looking ahead.
I:30;210;Some scenes took my breath away!
I:30;211;rose endangers Jack with a kinky and dangerous game, most notably enticing him into her chambers to sketch her with her fiance's rock around her neck, insisting that Jack sign it.
I:30;212;Then she leaves the sketch with a note in the safe: Just wanted you to see that I was sharing it with Jack !
I:30;213;With a friend like Rose, all Jack needed was for the boat to sink!Everyone is lauding this film and praising the romance of it.
I:30;214;And she throws the rock away!?
I:30;215;I saw Titanic the first day it opened and have watched it many times now.
I:30;216;The UnsinkableTitanic is an epic drama that is untouchable in comparison, winning 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture.
I:30;217;Jack catches Roses attention and she can't help but keep seeing him against her fianc 's orders.
I:30;218;Rose finds true love with this scoundrel, as the rest of her """"society friends"""" view him."""
219;winning soundtrack ( Best Original Song) adds to the drama.
220;I like this movie for the fact it has what seems like such a depressing outcome but at the same time, you want to watch it again and again to see the wonderful love story.
221;I give film 5 stars.
222;Got it used and was in good condition.
223;best film of all time, actually worthy of its 11 Oscars (unlike Lord of the Rings.
224;winning performance by Kate (well, deserving).
225;Brilliant special FX, stages, basically everything.
226;it's considered one of the best movies of all time by some, considered the best of all time by many (myself included) and boasts incredible popularity which in 1998 was the only thing talked about at the water.
227;The memories this movie brings to so many across the world is.
228;monumental, to say the least.
229;probably one of the last truly original movies made to this date.
230;we loved Titanic and have waited for its blu ray release for a long time.
231;If you are a fan of this movie, you gotta have this in your collection.
232;Experience it to believe it!
233;This movie is fascinating, one of the best movies of all time.
234;This was a recommendation for me!
235;On the plus side, Kate Winslet and Billy Zane were very good and so were the technical effects.
236;This is the best movie that I have ever seen.
237;And I will continue to watch it over and over again.
238;Leonardo Di Caprio's role as Jack Dawson whose is so deeply in love with the beautiful socialite Rose DeWitt is one the most touching relationships that I have ever seen in a movie.
239;I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister and she loved it.
240;Thank you Amazon for making a christmas gift possible.
241;Both of these actors really came into their roles and the acting was extremely convincing.
242;Everybody is already well aware of that.
243;"The point is to introduce a new element into it
I:30;244;This is what makes the film worthwhile.
I:30;245;for what it is, I think Titanic is an excellent movie.
I:30;246;Every moment in the film is spent building a very well thought out plot.
I:30;247;Sit back and enjoy what James Cameron has given us: a masterpiece that will stand the test of time and is to date the highest grossing box.
I:30;248;At least in The Lover the vast majority of the movie is dedicated to the development of the relationship, and character and relationship development is all that matters in heart wrenching material.
I:30;249;Not to mention a great movie to back it up.
I:30;250;this is my all time favorite movie.
I:30;251;love this movie can watch it over and over again.
I:30;252;I'm a big fan of James Camerons work with The Abyss .
I:30;253;I love Aliens, T1, T2 and even True Lies.
I:30;254;Titanic is among camerons best.
I:30;255;It is not often you see a film whose convictions, dramatically and visually, match its ambitious intentions all the way through.
I:30;256;parodied for years, James Cameron's eloquent, unforgettable 1997 Oscar.
I:30;257;winner TITANIC (****, 194 mins., 1997, PG.13"
258;driven center, and a visual panache that truly makes one feel that you're right at home on the doomed ship itself.
259;When the vessel meets its inevitable fate at the end, you feel the pain and horror along with the characters since Cameron has done such an amazing job balancing story with spectacle, paying proper respect and historically recounting the incident as accurately as he can, while still producing an entertainment .
260;and, at times, a piece of art .
261;that's been seldom duplicated by Hollywood in recent years.
262;part of the film's enduring appeal is due to the chemistry between Leonardo Dicaprio (outstanding) and Kate Winslet (excellent), who embody the film's admittedly old.
263;fashioned, somewhat hokey but still compelling love story between the lower.
264;class passenger and the upper.
265;class rich girl slated to marry snobby tycoon Billy Zane.
266;buxom Winslet is often captivating as the female lead, a role that often comes across as cliched and maybe a bit forced, yet she does such a fine job with it that it is hard to complain.
267;Excellent supporting work abounds in this film, from Kathy Bates's Molly Brown to fine character turns by David Warner and Frances Fisher.
268;The first half of the film is so good, in fact, that you forget the ship is on.
269;when the big event does arrive, Cameron treats us to a simply breathtaking dramatic display, the closest thing to a veritable rollercoaster (geometrically and otherwise) we've yet seen in the movies.
270;The incident is awesomely conveyed in size and scope, with detailed special effects that haven't aged too badly.
271;There is one moment early on where a young boy is spinning a top on the vessel's deck, a picture that originates from an Irish priest's photo of the Titanic in port at Belfast .
272;Clearly, Titanic scholars will find an incredible array of moments like those interpolated throughout the film, in addition to dialogue between some of the White Star line and crew members that also reportedly occurred in real life.
273;Of course, not all of the film is historically accurate, yet that so much of it is speaks volumes about the director's attempts to balance art with authenticity).
274;"like every great film, the cumulative whole of ""Titanic"" is that of a true, bona."
275;the kind we hope to see every time we go to the movies.
276;The picture stays with you long after the film has ended .
277;It's a technical presentation as satisfying as you'd anticipate coming from Cameron and his Lightstorm Entertainment banner.
278;extra features include three commentaries on the 2.
279;It's a rich, outstanding package that's been assembled here by Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment and Paramount, with terrific extras and spectacular transfers .
280;`Titanic' is one of those movies.
281;"It became a revelation upon its initial release back in 1997, and it continues to be considered one of the most beloved films in recent memory
I:30;282;It's generations `Gone with the Wind', `Titanic' is a sweeping romantic epic that has captured the hearts of millions and, as we all promised upon the film's conclusion, we have never let go.
I:30;283;This is just such a BIG movie, and event in itself, and you kind of have to see it on the big screen at least once"
284;it started and I literally got Goosebumps.
285;The acting is spotty at best (Winslet is decent in the beginning, great in the closing).
286;"Really, the film truly excels in two areas
I:30;287;`Titanic' works because all these elements, no matter how mediocre they can be on their own, come together in a way that creates cinematic magic.
I:30;288;The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable and the whole idea of their unlikely love affair surpassing tragedy and `meaning' something becomes such a strong driving force for the film that one cannot help but become emotionally wrapped up in the film, despite what number of views one is on.
I:30;289;When Celine Dion belts out the chorus lines to `My Heart Will Go On' you can feel the emotional connection well up in your heartstrings and it's really all over from that point forward.
I:30;290;This is the best and most emotional movie ever made.
I:30;291;If you're a fan of icebergs, this movie is for you.
I:30;292;There's a lot that can be said about Titanic.
I:30;293;barrier love story is pass .
I:30;294;from a warm, subjective viewpoint, Titanic is great.
I:30;295;It is one of those few films that completely sucks you into its world and smothers you in every nuance of the story.
I:30;296;It works as a painkiller too .
I:30;297;There is no tangible reason as to why this film is so absorbing, given the objective viewpoint, but there is something there that prevents it ever getting boring and keeps drawing you back into its soporific world.
I:30;298;Titanic is truly a monumental moment in film history, and a treasured classic you'll keep returning too.
I:30;299;Unlike other films, it has that ability to convince you it's entirely real.
I:30;300;Titanic is a phenomenal movie, and it happenned to have been phenomenally successful.
I:30;301;Winslet shines on screen, and DiCapprio is fine, with his.
I:30;302;While the upperclass seems a little uptight, Stuart delivers the preformance of a lifetime, .
I:30;303;The F/X are good, but not on the level of Independence Day or Twister.
I:30;304;One of the few highlights of the movie was Jack teaching Rose how to spit, and Kate Winslet's overall performance impressed me.
I:30;305;One present more for my husband in christmas, The movies are in perfect condition, the service was very quick and the price was a good deal, I love Amazon.
I:30;306;It's been over a decade, but Titanic is a timeless masterpiece that never goes out of date.
I:30;307;Leo and Kate made us care about what happened to them.
I:30;308;I think one of the reasons this movie has touched so many people is becauce, quite honestly, we are looking for a love like this.
I:30;309;And I would recommend this to anyone.
I:30;310;The movie had wonderful acting, a great plot that drew the viewers on the doomed luxery liner, and GREAT vusual effects!
I:30;311;By now I'm sure everyone has seen this movie.
I:30;312;A tragedy yes, but the story they put behind it is wonderful!
I:30;313;As so many others have said, this is two movies in one.
I:30;314;the story of the ship, the sinking and often accurate portrayal of the historic people involved with the ship, as well as the caliber of the acting, make the film outstanding.
I:30;315;The Rose story serves to paint mostly historic portraits well, and I love the older Rose in the framing scenes.
I:30;316;Also outstanding are the special effects that make me feel as though I was there observing.
I:30;317;watch with the fast forward button in hand.
I:30;318;forwarding through these and a few other parts, I'm able to focus on the majesty of the ship, the sometimes.
I:30;319;It's there that I feel the strength of the romance.
I:30;320;Rose's memory of Jack and his encouragement to her to live life to the fullest that she that she honors and embraces make the sometimes goofy shipboard romance, in hindsight, beautiful.
I:30;321;This is one of my all time favorite movies!
I:30;322;I can watch it over and over and somehow not tire of it!
I:30;323;He was right, it is a fabulous film!
I:30;324;This was well done and the acting very good by Leonardo DeCaprio.
I:30;325;A bit long, but good.
I:30;326;I absolutely adore this movie.
I:30;327;I love history, the Titanic, and romance, and this has all three.
I:30;328;I know it's true because it has happened to me.
I:30;329;An undying love that will last for as long as we are both alive.
I:30;330;It is a movie that puts the values of life, love, heroism, loss, and death into perspective.
I:30;331;I personally thought that it was very well crafted and I think that some people forget that the romance gives us the characters to become emotionally attached to through the film.
I:30;332;The professional critics, by the way, are so funny to me.
I:30;333;Some call the public """"dumb"""" and """"easily manipulated"""" for liking this film."""
334;now, my own review of this movie is that it is very well.
335;The music is phenomenal and could tell the story by itself.
336;James Cameron put a lot of heart into this movie and it shows.
337;so of course this movie, with it's cute actor and naked actress, would do well.
338;As I write this brief review, it is four years since Titanic came out, and there have been many Big Movies since then.
339;it really is a classic, comparable.
340;In Titanic, it is the unforgettable shot, not much above eye.
341;that with the beauty and grandeur of this world there are stark images of mass death to remind us of human follies like civil wars or ships that cut back on safety features or lifeboats.
342;To his great credit, Director Cameron did not play Can you top this?
343;jean Arthur film of 1937, History is Made at Night.
344;"No matter
I:30;345;A true homage can be like that.
I:30;346;many viewers might say that Gone With the Wind and Titanic are epic love stories, and they of course are right, but I see the films as epics with love stories attached.
I:30;347;Perhaps the most important factor in the success of both Gone With the Wind and Titanic is that the epic story is intrinsic to the love story, and the love story is intrinsic to the epic.
I:30;348;despite its great special effects.
I:30;349;It gives us the feeling, for once in the movies, akin to seeing the end of great play in the theatre.
I:30;350;It tells us of reality on two levels: the historical reality of the drama we have just seen, and the present reality of actors who have done some good work for us in telling us the story of that drama.
I:30;351;A touching love story merges almost seamlessly with awe.
I:30;352;inspiring spectacle and heartrending action.
I:30;353;packed movie of all time.)
I:30;354;Come back, I urge you, with an open mind, and you will find that the CGI is still amazing, the climax is still heartrendingly horrific, and Jack and Rose's (arguably the most famous duo in movie history) starcrossed romance is still affecting, and .
I:30;355;Billy Zane, Kathy Baker, Bill Paxton, and Bernard Hill in a stunning performance as Captain Edward Smith .
I:30;356;Something about a submarine, and a bit of social drama, some love story and suspense thrown in for good measure (Because we all know how the story will end, right?)
I:30;357;The sinking scene will still put you on edge and send shivers up your spine.
I:30;358;The unthinkable tragedy of the event combined with the human element makes one of the most poignant climaxes in blockbuster history.
I:30;359;The CGI supplements the sets and amazing acting, and, if you don't feel even an invisible tear in that horrific scene where everybody drowns in their rooms.
I:30;360;But unlike any other film of the sinking of HMS Titanic, TITANIC is the only one to mix social commentary and emotion, as well the world's greatest, most terrifying sinking ship scene ever filmed.
I:30;361;pROS: Spectacle, romance, great acting, something for men AND women, action, drama, melodrama, scope.
I:30;362;This is a huge crowd.
I:30;363;A hugely affecting blockbuster of heart and drama, touching and melodramatic, yet terrifying and gutwrenching and brimming with impressive spectacle?
I:30;364;titanic is truly a TITAN of a film.
I:30;365;It perplexes me to this day why this film is the most successful film in history, and boggles the mind even more that it did win Best Picture.
I:30;366;I will say that """"Titanic"""" is the most overrated movie in history."""
367;"It's hard to believe that James Cameron, who directed such excellent movies as ""The Terminator"", ""The Abyss"", ""T2"" and ""True Lies"", made this film."
368;The film's heart and soul is Gloria Stuart, who deserved an award for brilliant performance.
369;This was worth every penny.
370;It offers so much more than just the film.
371;Also, a very fascinating look into how the film was made, and some very interesting historic information about the real tragedy in 1912.
372;It was a great video but I already loved this movie.
373;"I just would have liked to see more of the ""real Titanic"" news clippings or true stories."
374;It's one of the best movies ever made.
375;Near the end of the movie, the Gloria Stuart character gives us the entire moral of the movie.
376;This movie is a love story, first and foremost, and on that level it excels.
377;As Jack and Rose develop their relationship we can identify with them, and we become involved in their relationship and eventually begin to care for them as people.
378;That is what makes the sinking of the ship so intense and emotionally dramatic.
379;visually the movie is stunning.
380;The effects are seamless and add to the story without taking away from it.
381;one can argue if it really deserved all the Oscars it received, (the technical ones were certainly deserved), but it really is a stunning movie.
382;Billy Zane did the best he could with a truly one dimensional character.
383;As it is, it is still an incredible movie.
384;I thouroughly enjoyed it, and continue to enjoy it each time that I view it.
385;thanks for any help you can provide!!
386;what an incredible ride from start to finish james cameron takes us back to the brief life of titanic and shows us with great vision what it must have been like to be on board the legendary ship.
387;the acting is incredible with kate and leo giving great performances as well as the rest of the cast.
388;but the most remarkable aspect of the movie has to be the effort and detail that was put into it the fact that most of the sets were built and sank on camera instead of using cgi was incredible and it felt like u were actually there witnessing all the horrific events first hand i highly recommend this movie to everyone!
389;The highest grossing movie of all time, James Cameron's Titanic follows the love story of Jack and Rose set on the doomed 1912 maiden voyage of the Titanic.
390;It is a real tear.
391;jerker and very moving on many levels.
392;What is needed is the consistent love of a father figure to give a sense of worthiness and security to face the world (cf. Bowlby).
393;But the same argument holds here: a vagabond come.
394;go lover can't take the place of a loving Daddy/God to take care of you and give you the strength to overcome tyranny.
395;disc edition is very worth it.
396;I loved all the special features and commentaries.
397;depth look at how this epic movie came to be.
398;Should a film be faulted for being the all.
399;time most commercially successful production ever?
400;"Titanic just happens to be immensely popular, and those who have difficulty swallowing that and consistently bash this film are likely the same snobs who hate DiCaprio and refuse to be identified with the swooning teenagers and all others who comprise the unsophisticated ""pop"" crowd."
401;How can anybody deny Cameron the credit he deserves, with all the hard work he put into this film?But beyond production design and casting, and even beyond being a disaster flick and a love story, this film is a very insightful social commentary.
402;Particularly noteworthy is the noveau riche Molly Brown, who proves to be the kindhearted member of the upper class.
403;Not surprisingly, she is the one who, in the eyes of her fellow.
404;But please, let's give credit where credit is due.
405;It may not be a great film, but it is a very good film.
406;For all the right reasons.
407;It is a great movie to have in your collection.
408;I saw this movie in theatres when it first came out and I loved it.
409;Everyone should have a copy of this good movie in their collection.
410;Sure the historical aspects of this story are somewhat twisted to fit the romance but this is really a love store within a shipwreck so just accept some of the inaccuracies and enjoy the show.
411;I hope every person who bought that album or this movie gets ebola.
412;Titanic is a great movie that takes you on a journey through time.
413;It is a fantastic movie and well recognized since it won 11 academy awards and has the box office record.
414;I highly recommend this movie.
415;I'm going to make this short and sweet: if you love Titanic and have a blu ray player you HAVE to add this movie to your collection.
416;The picture is the best I have ever seen it look.
417;Great performances from the two leads, clever quotes from film history (Lubitsch, Kubrick, Eisenstein: it's all there) even the much derided script contains some good lines (viz Rose's campy lines about Freud and Picasso).
418;If you have seen it, see it again.
419;Portraying true events of the tragic titanic and also a love story worth watching.
420;I loved how I got my package not even 5 days after I had ordered it, and to top it all off the package was in great conduction and was not messed up
421;See the best melodrama and effects from the mid.1990s in full Blu Ray resolution!
422;It's got Leo Decaprio and a chubby girl with slender Victoria's Secret hands.
423;I am a big fan of Titanic.
424;fans b/c of the history (me), and fans b/c of the movie and leo.
425;Other than that, the movie was great.
426;And to my surprise received it within ten days.
427;The digital conversion was right up there withe the best.
428;Director James Cameron has outdone himself.
429;Thanks to Cameron, we got a chance to really experience it.
430;It is heartwarming and definitely tear jerking in most parts.
431;She almost jumps to take her life, but is stopped by a young man, Jack.
432;Though opposites, they make the perfect pair and you can already feel the love flowing between them.
433;They meet each other more and more, much despised by Rose's mother and fianc .
434;Jack forces her to hold on to life and promises that she will survive, grow up, and raise a beautiful family.
435;Though Jack's beautiful promise came true, the same fate couldn't be said for him.
436;The actors we're excellent in this scene.
437;You felt all of their pain and despair and your heart ached for them both.
438;the special effects weren't as great as they could have been, but did include a fascinating model of the Titanic.
439;It was specially made to be able to break in half after it hit the iceberg.
440;The last scene of the movie is a bit surprising and beautiful.
441;It was a great ending to a great movie.
442;Actors Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio, who played Rose and Jack, were excellent.
443;A job well done to James Cameron.
444;Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing in nearly every movie he makes, Titanic is no exception, always a classic!
445;The music written for this movie is exceptional.
446;the additional footage was great to see.
447;I loved it even more this time.
448;James Cameron's Titanic is a beautiful story with commendable acting and etraordinary special effects.
449;the sheer scale of this movie is absolutely breathtaking, and the story, if predictable, is beautiful.
450;She is unfulfilled by life, and is a self absorbed spoiled aristocrat.
451;But to inform Cal, she has Jack, a man she has just met, to draw her naked with the diamond around her neck.
452;But given the facts that this film is the most expensive ever created, at a cost of $200 million, and later becoming the most successful movie ever released, making over $2.5 billion worldwide in ticket sales.
453;While it seems there are two groups of people when it comes to Titanic, those who thought it was just the best thing to ever happen to moviemaking (As I do) and others who thought it was just another movie, in retrospect, we can all appreciate it to one degree or another.
454;soon after, with the introduction of the treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton), we learn he is not at this peaceful place for research, but rather he is hear in search of a dazzling blue diamond, and nothing less.
455;rules world, and into his world of carefree life, and uninhibited expressionism.
456;The next morning Rose and Jack Walk along the decks, gradually getting to know one another, as well, here Rose is first drawn into Jack's world when he shows her his sketches, and later teaches her to spit overboard.
457;She goes flying with him on the bow, and shares what is perhaps the most affectionate moment of her life, from this moment, she is completely within Jack's world.
458;In a stunning display of special effects, the ship slowly slips below the waves, the couple suddenly separated, and rejoined moments later.
459;once Rose portrays her story to the treasure hunters she slips to the end of the research ship and drops the necklace, which she has had the entire time, back into the ocean, allowing her to finally have peace with the past.
460;The film then ends with the haunting balled sang perfectly by Celine Dion.
461;while the screenplay may have it's weak points, these are more than rectified by the immense attention to detail, making every detail of the film as historically accurate as is possible, by the detail obsessed James Cameron.
462;Amplifying the historical details even further are the amazing gowns worn by Rose, as well as all the supporting player's costuming.
463;I say, give the film a shot, even if you don't think you'll like it.
464;I recommend this film above any other I have ever seen in my life!
465;I remember seeing this in the movie theaters with my friend in 1997.
466;For its time, Titanic was one of the greatest movies of 1997 and still can't be topped .
467;The whole tragedy both facinates and stirs emotion, just like it did the many years ago when I saw this movie in theaters.
468;Leo and Kate were cast perfect for the parts and their on.
469;This is one of the best movies ever made.
470;The story of the Titanic always differs from what source you look at.
471;It was great to finally have all the pieces brought together in a movie.
472;All of the characters were well portrayed and the design of the ship was stunning.
473;"The film ""Titanic"" rates a 5/5 on my scale, as it is the most beautifully sad romance story that kept me on the edge of my seat (and the verge of tears) throughout the entire film."
474;I almost cried just seeing the menu images, knowing the story of the Titanic.
475;The first two are, obviously, the film, with many additional special features, and a third disc with all special features.
476;And the disc is PACKED.
477;"sexuality: Rose asks Jack to ""draw me like one of your french girls wearing this, and only this."""
478;well, you be the judge.
479;I certainly said all I think I have to say about this, the absolute best movie in the history of film making!
480;a very very very very great Movie For All times :P
481;I highly recommend the product and the company.
482;Great movie in German with English subtitles.
483;My students enjoy it immensely.
484;I highly recommend it to any German club.
485;The romance touched my heart, the scenes of the real ship (although few), the effects so perfect.
486;The scenes early in the movie of this great ship lying on the bottom of the ocean were heart wrenching.
487;But it is more important to remember this.
488;This is especially poignant in the scene in the movie where we look across the ocean and see all of the dead, frozen in the icy cold water.
489;"I did enjoy the ""making of"" featurettes and the underwater sequences that explored the interior decks."
490;All in all it was worth the price I paid in its used condition which was in like.
491;I like the movie well enough and will watch and enjoy it.
492;It is a welcome addition to my collection.
493;It is such a great movie!!!!!!!
494;It made her very happy.
495;Titanic is a phenomenal piece of Hollywood filmmaking.
496;"It is a stunning, beautiful, haunting film that will live with the kind of respect and belovedness of classic Hollywood films like ""Casablanca"", ""Gone With The Wind"", and many more."
497;By now, everybody pretty much knows the plot.
498;Director James Cameron showed Hollywood and naysaying critics that he knew what he was doing and made them eat their words.
499;up, special effects, score, are some of the best seen in a film in eons.
500;It was done with incrediblr care and accuracy.
501;The movie deserves five stars just for that alone!
502;But, the best acting awards goes to Gloria Stuart as old Rose.
503;Titanic is an epic blockbuster that isn't usual Hollywood blockbuster films.
504;It is deserving of everything it got and did.
505;It is one grand film that gives hope to audiences that special films like this still exist.
506;A classic for the ages.
507;A treaure for people who love movies.
508;She loved it and I still loved it.
509;For anyone who loves this movie like myself, you have to watch it in 3.
510;My 7 yr old daughter loves this movie.
511;And I have a sweet spot for it also.
512;No film has ever rivaled the sheer greatness to this epic that also won 11 Oscars including Best Director and Best Picture.
513;That is tied for the most all time with the 1959 film Ben Hur and 2003's Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.
514;as for the film, I personally feel it is one of the most enticing, emotional, and thrilling pictures of all time.
515;"The story immediatly begins with a ""treasure hunt"" down to the real Titanic, to which James Cameron actually filmed there and ended spending more time with the ship than the actual passengers."
516;a 101 year old Rose sees the picture and heads to the vessel to talk with the capitan.
517;The story of the real ship mixed with the modern day telling is very effective in the way in which it gives the viewer something to follow rather than just the sinking.
518;The truth is , that is what makes Titanic such a great film.
519;It breks genres from a mystery, to a drama, to a love story, and finally to a thrilling race for survival.
520;He simply pulled it off with flying colors and the true spectacle that is Titanic is that it is a collaberative process.
521;It simply has the best visual effects ever in an epic.
522;The sets off the coast of Baja and the tank that sat in for the drowning people are all amazing.
523;It's amazing the movie ever got released.
524;To end the film on a high note the movies, sound, costumes, editing, effects, and the best musical score of all time make Titanic a movie for the ages.
525;It will forever carry on as one of the best movies of all time.
526;There will be two editions: A 2.
527;disc version with a new digital transfer of the film in anamorphic widescreen and a branching feature, this means an icon will pop up in the movie whenever a deleted scene will pop up and you can view it from there, but Cameron considers the theatrical release to be his Director's Cut.
528;There will be 58 minutes of unseen footage, and all will be brought up to date.
529;The scenes will be polished.
530;hope I made my point clear and that you enjoyed my review.
531;i've liked their work in many other venues like Terminator and The Aviator.
532;Kathy Bates makes a nice performance in a throwaway role as the Unsinkable Molly Brown.
533;"the boat looks luminous
I:30;534;Watch any """"inside the set"""" documentary and you realize the care and effort that Cameron took to replicate the vessel and the sinking."""
535;the film is definitely worth watching for the cinematography alone, and has several memorable moments, but fifty years from now will it attain high standing among the list of Oscar winners?
536;I liked parts of the movie especially the action scenes in the last half, but I didn't like the characters very much.
537;He was mainly just there to attract to under 20 girls.
538;Send this movie back to the ocean.
539;the best thing about it was Celine Dion's song.
540;One star for the end of the movie.
541;The special effects were awesome, the costumes brilliant, and the acting unforgettable.
542;Overall, James Cameron has done a great job, and this movie is .
543;Walter Lord titled his book about the Titanic sinking A Night To Remember and this film is one that will ALWAYS be remembered, for it is perfect, absolutely perfect.
544;The costumes are wonderful, the acting is wonderful, the special effects are wonderful, and the props, which were exact replicas of the items which were found on the real Titanic, are wonderful.
545;It is a story that will touch your heart, inspire you, move you to tears, and make you ponder over one thought in particular .
546;the thought that perhaps there was a real life Jack and Rose aboard the real Titanic.
547;And it is wonderful to see that in such a cynical age, a glorious and beautiful movie such as this can emerge from the cash for trash rota of Hollywood, depicting the sinking itself and the loss of so many lives in such a sensitive, non exploitive way.
548;James Cameron intended to bring back the great epic cinema.
549;In many ways James Cameron succeeded brilliantly.
550;Titanic is a film of truly titanic proportions with striking images worthy of David Lean.
551;Especially the second half delivers one memorable scene after another.
552;Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do a good job and all the technical aspects of the film are unbelievably well realized.
553;the reason for the hatred of many viewers is maybe its unparalleled commercial success.
554;James Cameron delievered a sweeping epic that manages to captivate for more than three hours and I think that this is a tremendous achievement.
555;Watching the deleted footage is great.
556;If u love James camron and titanic then this is the perfect collection for u.
557;It have very cool stuff
558;Just one of those flicks my friends had all seen before me.
559;This movie gives you all you pay for.
560;But after all is said and done, you have a lot of 21st century attitude blended in with early 20th century characters and their mindsets.
561;That setting works in giving you who you sympathize with and who you loathe, especially when it comes to crunch time, and towards that end this movie works well.
562;So to be fair, the movie works.
563;Great movies withstand the test of time, mega.
564;It's a beautifully made film that tells a nice story.
565;It's funny how in the immediacy of things some movies get by the test of common sense and unfettered judgement.
566;Those lyrics won an award.
567;In several respects, it's incredible.
568;The recreation that is pulled off is worthy of praise, as is most of the cinematography.
569;L. a. Confidential deserved the best picture Oscar over this movie.
570;"I wrote a review on ""A night to remember"" and said it was better than this movie, I still stand by that statement."
571;Here's why, do you have to have fictional characters in an historical movie to connect with your audience, NO.
572;For instance, while yes Molly Brown was rich.
573;That's why, when Molly Brown took over the life boat in real life, well Molly Brown herself contradicted the whole code of the first class.
574;The romance between Kuji and Fukowa in King Kong vs. Godzilla was more believable.
575;The special effects were good for the time.
576;I lookforward to watching it again from time to time.
577;Titanic, James Cameron's 1997 hit starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, is one of my favorite romantic movies of all time.
578;This film, set aboard the doomed ocean liner Titanic in April of 1912, is both sad and moving.
579;office receipts (due to some viewing the movie more than once at the movies).
580;Titanic surpassed all the previous box.
581;the cinematography was superb, with each scene it was as you were there on board the ship looking and being a part of what was going on from the grand ballroom and dining area in First Class to the crowded and squalid Third Class steerage where many Irish and other foreign immigrants were going to America hoping for a better life for themselves and their families.
582;"Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" will bring tears to your eyes, making you think of what Rose and Jack were going through as the tragedy unfolds on the ill."
583;This finely honed piece craftsmanship by James Horner who has tackled musically adventuresome projects in his career including scores for Apollo 13, Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games and Star Trek II: the Wrath of Khan.
584;for me, this movie will be an enduring and classic love story for years to come.
585;I thought I was getting the movie and a separte disc with the special features.
586;capable home theater system for almost five years.
587;This is particularly true of post.
588;Of course professional calibration will give you the best results, but you can still vastly improve on the factory menu settings by doing some searching online.
589;Do your homework and you'll find good deals on stuff that delivers great results.
590;if you want to see a good movie, watch GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES.
591;and the extras are very nice.
592;super great picture and sound!!
593;It's simply a great story.
594;Every writer of great fiction I am familiar with laughed at so much analysis by people too small to write for themselves.
595;fate hands itself to great and small, no matter what they think about it.
596;Oh, wait, you're so smart the movie needs to beat it's ideas into you with a hammer or it sucks.
597;Over and again it needs to first revel in it's own importance, harping on how important it is with ideas.
598;This is a great movie.
599;bought it for my daughter.
600;"Titanic"" is a spectacular roller coaster ride""."
601;This is the greatest film of all time, EVER, and if you don't at least recognize that, you're some sort of mental case!
602;And I like it when the Critters eat the chili.
603;I think that this movie is the best Titanic movie ever releised because I have it and watch it almost every day!
604;Titanic is first of all of love story, but it is so much more than that.
605;Titanic is by far the best picture I have ever seen.
606;What makes Titanic so great, mainly three things.
607;the fist is the bold exploration into the world of the past.
608;Along with a great love story we see the history of a wonderful ship.
609;The people on board with but one dream, America.
610;One scene I really enjoy is when jack wins the poker match and screems We're going to America .
611;I have never heard dialogue between two characters so beautiful.
612;and Jack romanitcally replys I see you.
613;what a wonderful peice of dialogue.
614;the third reason the film is the greatest is the soundtrack.
615;The music fits the film perfectly.
616;titanic is the greatest film ever.
617;But as a commercial film this is a big success.
618;the story itself may well be a true reflection of what had actually transpired.
619;the grandeur of Titanic was particularly well captured.
620;The life of the upper class life on board was convincingly conveyed.
621;Even the life of the lower class was well portrayed, and when things are not quite unrealistic, they have good purposes to serve, touching up the general atmostphere making it more juicy.
622;These are one of the mosting exciting part of the movie.
623;they are so telling and touching.
624;Titanic is the ultimate movie.
625;"James Cameron really pulls you in
I:30;626;This is an epic movie.
I:30;627;I could watch it again and again, especially in a Blu.
I:30;628;How could anyone take one of the greatest tragedies the world has ever known, superimpose a fictional love story over it, and turn it into a movie?
I:30;629;the ship portrayed in the film is incredibly realistic.
I:30;630;the purpose of the love story between Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio) was to give the viewer a human perspective.
I:30;631;Director James Cameron was wildly successful in this area.
I:30;632;Wonderful writing!Here is a story for everyone.
I:30;633;It is fairly accurate, historically, so it appeals to the history buffs.
I:30;634;It's also a romantic love story, and a tear jerker.
I:30;635;and it even has its share of action scenes.
I:30;636;It is a wonderful tribute.
I:30;637;Against the backdrop of the oceanliner disaster we have one of the most incredible motion picture love stories of all time.
I:30;638;TITANIC is a breathtaking work of labor for it's director.
I:30;639;Every frame is a work of art .
I:30;640;the story is also quite good.
I:30;641;diCaprio and Winslet are unforgetable!
I:30;642;I'm glad to see a full.
I:30;643;Hollywood has painted a picture of beauty in the form of the Kate Moss type for too long.
I:30;644;Also, Kathy Bates' Molly Brown is terrific when she declares: Grab the oars ladies, we're going back!
I:30;645;And Rose's mother wanting to be sure the seating on the lifeboat was separated by class.
I:30;646;On a scale of 1 to 5 I'd give the picture a 4 overall.
I:30;647;Here's a love story that'll make you cry like a girl!
I:30;648;This is a nice Titanic Collector's Edition to add to my Collection of movies.
I:30;649;Great moovie that anyone could watch make sure you get blu ray!
I:30;650;It came by mail in a timely fashion, I believe two days.
I:30;651;that also was very exciting.
I:30;652;thank you, Amazon, for saving the day.
I:30;653;I just received several movies on Titanic.
I:30;654;The producershad grealy added romance into the film that it over shadowed the realfacts.
I:30;655;Seriously, this is the best movie I've ever watched.
I:30;656;The technology is fabulous and it's just a great plot.
I:30;657;dovey but it touches your heart because of the reality of thousands of lives that were lost.
I:30;658;The songs are great and the reality of it all is just incredible.
I:30;659;It's not just a fictional movie or a chick flick, it's actually based on something real.
I:30;660;arrived pretty fast to our door and it was still wrapped in its original wrap!
I:30;661;There are still people who are surprised!
I:30;662;Moving right along, what makes this movie so interesting is that while there are fictional elements, they are mixed with historical elements as well.
I:30;663;It is interesting how we are told the story from the 100 year old survivor Rose.
I:30;664;The scenery and outfits are beautiful.
I:30;665;The story seems to move at a realistic pace (rather than everything being crammed to fit into a 2 hour slot).
I:30;666;While Rose and Jack are the stars, other characters make good use of their screen time.
I:30;667;moving on, there is some generous time of just getting to know everyone, but this also provides a creepy suspense.
I:30;668;In the event we forgot the conversation between Rose and Mr. Andrews, Thomas faces Rose again and reminds us.
I:30;669;one phenomenal thing about this movie is that it shows us the true horror of people dying.
I:30;670;This is great in that we get to see the panic, tragedy, and horror of the crew knowing that less than 1/2 are going to survive.
I:30;671;But moving back to the present, it is interesting how the Bill Paxton character suddenly realizes that there is more to life than ourselves.
I:30;672;Overall, it's a phenomenal romance (in a historical setting) that reminds us not only of the horror of people dying, but that there is more to life than our own existence.
I:30;673;Save up for next year!
I:30;674;First of all, this movie is an absolute masterpiece.
I:30;675;This is a glorious film, incredible production values, first class acting, dynamic special effects, breathtaking cinematography, wonderful story, outstanding music, everything about the film is just perfect.
I:30;676;You're involved with the characters and their struggles from beginning to end, it's incredible.
I:30;677;One of the best movies ever made, period.
I:30;678;I'd give the film a very solid 10 out of 10.
I:30;679;Good trailer, but for such a grand film you would expect all the making.
I:30;680;Highly recommend, love this movie, truly a great love story but really sad.
I:30;681;It keeps you on edge and is breathtaking
I:30;682;I remember loving this movie when i was younger when it was released.
I:30;683;and still love it today.
I:30;684;the audio commentaries are also very cool, James Cameron's commentary is great and the the commentary with the two historians is good too, with lots of neat info and facts to go along with the movies.
I:30;685;the second disc also has alot of nice behinds the scenes features and programs.
I:30;686;When I was a child, I remember reading about the Titanic and found it mildly interesting.
I:30;687;There are interesting architectural details that are historically correct and some of the characters are based on real people.
I:30;688;We also enjoyed the documentary that came with it.
I:30;689;blockbuster film from '97 is a nostalgic, romantic spectacle that won the Academy Award for best film along with 10 more.
I:30;690;It has everything one would demand from a movie that won so many awards"
691;Titanic, is tha best movie thats ever hit 20 century.
692;I letting everyone know im tha number one fan in tha world of it, .
693;Its a great love story that gets u invovled in tha movie, Billy Zane plays a great villian along wit his sidekick.
694;This is tha second movie in history to win up to 11 academy awards besides bel.
695;Three stars is the average of 1 star and 5 stars: 1 for the love story, 5 for the ship and its fate.
696;but the Titanic was a good actor.
697;creation of the tragedy was very well done, and stuck very close to history as far as I can tell.
698;This was a moving and dramatic account of a great tragedy (interspersed by nonsense like Hockley's attempt to assassinate Jack with Lovejoy's pistol.)
699;Saw this movie in the theater years ago and still holds up.
700;Cameron, the directed, succeeded and the box office totals proved him to be one of the tops in hisfield.
701;This may be a love story but it has so many great elements about the Titanic.
702;It's a wonderful love story shaped around the real life events of the tragedy of the Titanic.
703;The set up is nice, the actors are great and it's a little bit of everything for everyone.
704;But the movie is just great!
705;Titanic is certainly a lush, beautifully photographed and well.
706;notch, in particular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's mother.
707;And Billy Zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily.
708;The wonderful Kathy Bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes, and as Molly Brown she doesn't disappoint.
709;"Strict adherence to the actual facts is not a priority
I:30;710;And in that regard, Titanic certainly succeeds.
I:30;711;the basic plot of Titanic is a fairly standard (yet no less entertaining) love story.
I:30;712;the storytelling of this movie is top.
I:30;713;boy romance, but because the two leads have such great chemistry, it seems new and fresh.
I:30;714;This one is all about the story and the spectacle, both of which it has in spades.
I:30;715;Kate Winslet, one of the best actresses working in films today, does some of the weakest work of her career but is always watchable, and the rest of the cast acquits themselves well.
I:30;716;(How Winslet earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination is beyond me"
717;"The visual effects in action films are not impressive
I:30;718;A lot of movies have special effects that are impressive in theory, but don't excite anyone.
I:30;719;top demonstrations of what computers are capable of"
720;This is not on the same plateau as a timeless masterpiece like Casablanca or Citizen Kane, but it is a very good film.
721;up was better, but by so little that the winner was every bit as deserving).
722;The love story sometimes gets in the way, but it's still OK.
723;The actual sinking is amazing, terrifying and gives a real sense of what it must have been like to be on the ship and hopeless.
724;At least Amazon provided a prompt refund, but I had to package the product up, and take it to a UPS shipper.
725;The online price varies from day to day.
726;The movie background is very good.
727;James Cameron made a great thing.
728;It was a very good movie.
729;So excited about the Special Edition.
730;James Cameron created such a wonderful movie with excellent p. ictures and nice music.
731;that it remind us of courage which we really ne.
732;id role in front of us.
733;erever and whenever, it is a best choice for yo.
734;u and me to see it!
735;It's 194 minutes of great writing and acting.
736;I highly recommend this movie for nothing else than the great costumes.
737;The cast, sets, costumes, music are all excellent.
738;This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.
739;The romance abounds and the story is interesting.
740;The incredible acting, costumes, and music make us feel we are there.
741;The romance and trajedy draw us into a bittersweet tragedy.
742;As the story draws to a close we find out she still possesses the necklace.
743;The special effects are great in this film, and the love story is compelling.
744;Even though there is no uncertainty as to how this movie plays out, it is still quite dramatic and interesting.
745;Plus, you have to marvel at a movie that managed to win the Academy Award for best picture and was also a huge box office hit .
746;First off, there is a heavy handed message of rich = bored and unhappy, poor = genuine and full of life.
747;The only main character in this movie that seems to be facing facts is Rose's mother who shows genuine terror at the idea of being poor again .
748;is the gift set worth it?
749;If you want a gift for a romantic, here you go.
750;"issue of Jame's Cameron's magnificent film ""Titanic"" contains many extras that will delight this movie's legions of fans."
751;I also greatly admire Mr. Cameron for the courage and imagination of vision that led him to undertake a perilous underwater visit to the wreck of the fabled liner.
752;He shot his own underwater footage.
753;The imagination and effort that went into the sets to create the very real illusion of sinking is nothing short of truly amazing.
754;"The ""Titanic"" has justly earned it's position as one of the greatest cinematic efforts in the history of film."
755;because focusing on any of those irrelevant things will prevent you from enjoying one of the most immersing movies ever made.
756;A great edition of a great film.
757;A movie I will watch at least twice a year.
758;The story is so compelling.
759;I think that Titanic is one of the best movies ever made.
760;If you are a real romantic who loves a good cry this movie is for you.
761;Despite the unimaginative script and mediocre acting, there is simply something about this movie that's enjoyable.
762;So it's melodramatic, so some things are like a soap opera, but it's entertaining!
763;It was all beautiful, very worthy of the Oscars it won!
764;It is magnificent and shows those who died and survived that night with the recognition they deserve.
765;if you enjoyed Titanic, I would recommend Gone With the Wind (1939) and my personal favorite, Doctor Zhivago (1965), which is another romantic epic set during the Russian Revolution.
766;In 1997, James Cameron made the most amazing movie in the entire world, and it's name was Titanic.
767;I saw the movie last weekend and it was AMAZING on the big screen.
768;One change I did notice was that the color was enhanced.
769;By today's standards, a new copy of Titanic could run you somewhere between $75 and $100, due to the fact that it's out of print.
770;But of all movies James Cameron has done, this has to be one of my favorites.
771;release, and I hope you do the same.
772;And of the course, the movie in excellent shape.
773;Obviously these reasons cloud the judgment of most of its critics and I plan to set the record straight.
774;It reminded everyone that any day could be your last and that you must live each day to the fullest.
775;This is primarily what captivated the hearts and minds of a large chunk of the world.
776;It showed us through this brilliantly crafted film that there is still a need for love and compassion and that our world is still filled with human tragedy, not just computers.
777;For that alone, this movie must go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever created.
778;another primary reason why Titanic is a phenomenal film is the well.
779;acted love story between Jack and Rose.
780;The love story created an emotional doorway to the tragedy that occurred that night.
781;As a viewer you began to care for the characters.
782;Firstly, the amazing music, which set the tone for each scene perfectly.
783;Thirdly, the impeccable sets and costumes gave an extremely authentic feel to the movie.
784;cameron's film was flawless for it blended past and present perfectly, while telling the story of Titanic in its entirety.
785;This film deserves the 11 Oscars it received (including Best Picture) and achieving the worldwide position of the 3rd highest grossing film of all time (inflation included).
786;Great movie, great features, horrible price.
787;In my opinion, this is one of the best movies every made.
788;First of all, it is very close in terms of the historical facts.
789;The actual footage shown is simply amazing, and shows Jim Cameron's dedication to his craft.
790;the characters are wonderful, and the acting extraordinary.
791;the actual technical details are a masterpiece.
792;As an amateur history buff, I enjoyed seeing the recreation of the Titanic's sinking, as well as the boat itself.
793;Have loved this movie since the first time I saw it.
794;The soundtrack is outstanding while the graphics were awesome for being done back in the 90s.
795;Unless you are a love.
796;Yes it has a lot of features.
797;Otherwise, a spectacular movie with incredible attention to technical details.
798;i was first drawn to see Titanic for two reasons.
799;despite the mediocre plot, the actors did perform well.
800;Leo and Kate were charming, and Billy Zane.
801;The most impressive performance, however, was that of the ship.
802;The reproduction and special effects were simply astounding.
803;Usually I don't give a damn about such things, but in this case I was truly impressed.
804;The ship was also splendid in her live performance before the cameras of the Russian submersible.
805;She was a haunting and beautiful sight in her watery grave.
806;although I dismissed the plot as being rather meaningless, I was surprised to find that many people in Mainland China loved it.
807;disc edition and this year should've came with a 4.
808;"The only special feature really worth it is that Fox Marketing video, all the other ""special features"" are about 2 minutes, especially when they could be 20 minutes and very interesting."
809;"The ""Titanic Ship Tour"" for example is amazing but could have been better."
810;good movie, gets 4/5 but the special features are useless.
811;The picture and sound have been greatly improved, the dts track is amazing!
812;The extras are nice, while not spectacular they do the job well.
813;It was very well done and gives a very good insite into the liner Titanic.
814;It is with a great understanding of the liner.
815;i strongly disagree with the Amazon review that calls this a movie for the ages.
816;Corny and sophomoric, Titanic has its moments, but it's best seen on the big screen.
817;Di Caprio Winslet give it their best.
818;Billy Zane is suitably reprehensible as the vain rich.
819;boy villain, and the supporting cast are good, especially Victor Garber and Bernard Hill as the Titanic's engineer and captain, respectively.
820;So just go along for the doomed ride, because it's still worth seeing just for the technical wizardry and amazing attention to detail.
821;That means after the first hour and a half on disc 1 you will have to switch the disc and put it disc 2 to continue watching the movie.
822;Disc 2 and 3 with the special features?
823;Oh well it's great to own something like this even though switching the disc is a pain in the rear!
824;I continue to enjoy Titanic .
825;Therefore I'll refrain from criticizing the romantic plotline overmuch.
826;Cameron paid amazing attention to detail, recreating every set to look exactly like photos of the real ship.
827;The engine room is a masterpiece.
828;The special effects involved in the sinking, utilizing a full scale model, are spectacular.
829;Likewise the remarkable authentic footage taken from the real Russian research ship and minisubs.
830;By brilliantly framing the past story in the present, Cameron shares with his audience his own wondrous experience of visiting the Titanic in her North Atlantic grave.
831;For example, Jack's exultant cry We're the luckiest guys in the world!
832;is an ironic echo of the real.
833;But Cameron pays them tribute by giving human faces to that faceless mass of humanity.
834;So the fictional characters may be cliche'ed, but they are a pretty fair composite of the historical reality.
835;For its grand scope and spare.
836;expense attention to detail, Titanic deserves its multiple awards.
837;the love story was very romantic.
838;And of course the box, which is pretty cool .
839;term success is also a lot of fun.
840;"among others)
I:30;841;I've loved this movie since it first came out when I was barely old enough to understand it.
I:30;842;While some call it cheesy, I've always thought the story behind it was of great entertainment.
I:30;843;its really the only way to give the audience a feeling of great loss.
I:30;844;You feel for the other passengers lost, but you connect with the romance behind Jack and Rose.
I:30;845;Overall, classic Leo movie (and Kate) and I think their acting is well beyond their years in this.
I:30;846;It is a good movie for history buffs.
I:30;847;Leonardo dicaprio and Kate winslet are simply stunning in this tragic yet romantic love story, that unfolds on the ill fated titanic's maiden voyage.
I:30;848;Maybe because when I saw it, it was on New Year's Day 1998.
I:30;849;I was actually still drunk!)
I:30;850;I love my new toy and love this movie.
I:30;851;I think this is an absolutely beautiful film, the cast are all fantastic, down to the smallest parts, the set is breathtaking, and the whole story is just brilliant.
I:30;852;There are definitely a few alterations I would make, but I'll come to that later.
I:30;853;storyline's quite simple, big ship, everyone boards it, poor people, middling people, sparkling rich, socialite people.
I:30;854;this is, in my opinion, the beginning of the most exciting part.
I:30;855;I was TOTALLY AND UTTERLY moved by 1st officer and 5th officers, their beautiful performances have me sobbing every single time.
I:30;856;The emotional intensity of it is what makes it unsuitable for young children though.
I:30;857;as I have said yeah I would include more of the crew, and perhaps make it even MORE emotional (if that's possible!)
I:30;858;once again, this is a beautiful movie.
I:30;859;EVERYONE has to see it, it's just one of those films, like Mary Poppins or Ben Hur, that we ALL have to see, and if you're over 12 or so it is just the perfect film if you want a giggle, a good old howl, or a terrorised grip at the sofa.
I:30;860;Top class stuff, full marks.
I:30;861;Is """"Titanic"""" a marvelously crafted film?"""
862;No amount of special effects, as magnificent as they may be, can conceal the cringe.
863;worthy dialogue between Leo and Kate that the viewer is forced to endure.
864;even the spectacular nature of the movie has waned a little bit in the intervening years.
865;"Like many summer blockbuster flicks tht are largely propelled by their special effects, ""Titanic"" is one of those movies best seen on the big screen."
866;As to the performances of the rest of the cast .
867;at points it can be quite moving and touching.
868;Amazon was great in communications, time of release of the movie, and good at time of delivery.
869;I will be anxious to use the company again, and, again
870;all the actors were amazing, and it wasn't one of those sappy ending things.
871;Well lets start with: She has a near.
872;"The story is a team of scientists are looking for the ""Heart Of The Ocean"", a heart."
873;After this, I do have a new respect for James Cameron.
874;What a great way to make a story.
875;The love story in the movie didn't happen at all, but the idea of having one was such a great idea.
876;The special effects are breathtaking, and it makes you feel like you are also on the ship while it sinks!
877;Many people didn't like the story of this film because of the love story, but I thought it was a wonderful idea because who would want to see a movie that already knows whats going to happen at the end, so this way when you add a love story it's something that you look forward to, to see what happens to them at the end.
878;i was mad when the story was mostly about love but the titanic scenes like the sinking was very good.
879;The movie leads you through ups and downs and ins and outs.
880;The story is portrayed by a group of terrific actors and a beautiful and realistic set.
881;the movie starts out with both Rose and Jack (the lead roles) arriving on the titanic.
882;Rose is a rich woman with a rich fianc , and Jack is a poor man who lives freely and does and goes whatever and wherever he wants.
883;The two introduce one another to each others lives, and they become very close.
884;the movie is extremely well made.
885;The costumes are realistic and the animation is pristine.
886;The script is very well written and the characters very well developed.
887;I would seriously recommend watching this if you havent because it is a masterpiece.
888;The highly overrated movie Titanic won the hearts of movie.
889;goers all over the world.
890;This is really a movie aimed at romance loving, female, moviegoers.
891;As for the rest of us the movie is like candyfloss it is great at first but soon it becomes sickening sweet.
892;As for the movie as whole, it is well construced, the special effects are good(with a few exeptions) and it hits right where it was intended.
893;The movie or Camerons speech when he got an Oscar.
894;Every one knows this is such a great movie.
895;wrenching experience and go through numerous boxes of Kleenex.
896;Let's face it, with the casting of Leonardo DeCaprio and a gorgeous Kate Winslet, Camerson knew good and well who the majority of his audience would be.
897;Perhaps this is the genius .
898;By making it appealing to today's teens, he was able to draw them in to teach them the more important lessons more effectively than any history text where it would have been just another answer to memorize for the test.
899;The age range is a very impressionable one.
900;But as much as I had heard about the stories of the Titanic while growing up, seeing the stories portrayed gave me and eerie feeling.
901;To hear a teenager make this kind of statement warms my heart and gives me hope for the future.
902;Seeing this on film produced a strange calm within me.
903;tale, happily ever after ending.
904;According to all sources viewed so far, the new 3.
905;This movie is SO good (not a fav .
906;"It had a great historical plot combined w/ the wonderful acting of Kate Winslet (not Lienardo diCaprio) and a little humor and ""sexy stuff"" (jk)."
907;Anyway, this movie is great and is a movie u should get sometime soon.
908;so, was it worth waiting 6 years for this 3.
909;A photo gallery w/hundreds of pics.
910;"The aforementioned theatrical trailerIf you loved this (as they say on TNT) ""new classic"", it's a must."
911;If you liked BEN HUR, you'll love this puppy too.
912;this to was a christmass gift to one of my grandaughters.
913;Thank you for making it available
914;large box of Kleenex, and a chilly day makes for a great afternoon.
915;Compared to such excellent films as L. a. Confidential and Saving Private Ryan, once you've seen Titanic, you've seen all there is to see.
916;The genius that saves the movie is the set design, art direction, James Horner's astonishing score and Kate Winslet.
917;I bought this deluxe edition for my grandson, and it is beautiful.
918;it was on bridge with the Captain, and I believe this to be true .
919;To see small children get so involved in this beautiful great ship .
920;"this masterpiece, and the mystery of its demise is something to behold in this day and age, when even the Cartoon Channel has become contaminated with a lot of smutty propaganda type ""Adult Cartoons"" now put on this channel by 8 oclock PM."
921;and the main theme song is beautiful, in itself a work of art.
922;rated as a star, and I could have done without the 99 year old barefoot Rose .
923;while this was some type of a propaganda piece it is worth watching .
924;but all it all it is a collector's item, and we got a peek of the most beautiful ship in the world .
925;I have seen Titanic three times, twice at the movie theatre, and once on a video.
926;"Cameron might have directed the 1997 film to accommodate the needs of a present day audience
I:30;927;by the time that I saw Cameron's film for the third time, I was able to flesh out that there was something for the young as well as the old, and something for the past as well as the present.
I:30;928;For the young, they were able to enjoy Titanic because the history was only secondary, as adventure, romance, sex and materialism were primary.
I:30;929;At the opening scene of the ocean, it had the same impact as it did when I saw the 1953 movie, fear, trembling, and a tremendous respect for the ocean.
I:30;930;Oh yes, I was a young girl when I sailed on the Queen Mary, and I so recall with fondness and love the romance that I had with one of the officers on the return to New York on the Queen Mary.
I:30;931;I feel somewhat connected to the Titanic also, because I knew two survivors myself.
I:30;932;One was my great uncle, a successful businessman who tried to get on board the Titanic only to be turned away at the gangplank in Southampton, and the other person, a neighbor of mine who might have sailed on the Titanic if the girl he loved had turned down his marriage proposal in London only two weeks earlier.
I:30;933;Both those names can be found on the list of passengers.
I:30;934;the end scene was extremely well handled.
I:30;935;That scene was very special for the older generation because there was something in for all of us, and especially as we are more accepting of the inevitable, which Mr. Cameron's handling of it made us all believe that it can be happy.
I:30;936;I loved this movie when it came out and the Blu.
I:30;937;Kate Winslet is amazing and DiCaprio is charming.
I:30;938;Picture every rich person a snob or a prop!
I:30;939;The sets are realistic, the people are drawn straight from Days of Our Lives.
I:30;940;So starved is our romance deprived culture for beauty, that even this wicked little confection seemed like the real thing.
I:30;941;my last viewing of Titanic was over 12 months ago giving it a good rest.
I:30;942;ray works, of course it works, the detail is outstanding, motion blur being the only let down but hey I know Cameron is working on that!The Alternative Ending is interesting to say the least but I'm quite happy with the original theatrical version.
I:30;943;this movie is a great romance and it keeps you in suspense at the end.
I:30;944;It was the maiden voyage for the ocean liner and the press was marvelling at her size, so to give them something new to print, the owner ordered it to go faster so they can marvel her speed.
I:30;945;the first half is noteworthy to me for it's set design.
I:30;946;It looks remarkable with a lot of attention to detail as well as the aerial shots of the ship which James Cameron said to CG artists to act like you were advertising the Titanic for commercials.
I:30;947;The costumes are quite great also.
I:30;948;The film, thanks to great sound, as a lot of goosebump moments like their run away from the water in the corridor or when the ceiling gives way to the water.
I:30;949;It's a great use of effects, minatures and live action and certainly looks impressive even on repeated viewings.
I:30;950;another compliment is James Horner's score.
I:30;951;It has that right amount of energy and action with more character and soft overtones.
I:30;952;The main theme that you hear during the opening is quite nice too although my favorite is at the end when the camera travels underwater back to the ship.
I:30;953;it's funny that James Cameron had a big run in the 1980's and early 1990's with Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2, True Lies and this, then there's practically no new film.
I:30;954;Known for being quite the perfectionist on set, he can make a good thrilling film and blend of comedy and character development.
I:30;955;Love this film or hate it, it's still quite a marvel to look at.
I:30;956;d version puts you right in the action and experience.
I:30;957;but again overall this is a good movie
I:30;958;It was listed as being new and arrived in very good condition and was quite reasonable.
I:30;959;It arrived in a timely fashion.
I:30;960;Not only do I love this movie, but the condition it was in was spectacular!
I:30;961;I really liked that it came with Four discs.
I:30;962;With good character actors all around, we are expected to care about what happens to the puppy love of DeCaprio's 2.
I:30;963;But """"Plan 9"""" is actually better since that director, Ed Wood, had a vision but no money."""
964;This Movie Has Great Effects
965;and it was very good.
966;If all the great movies can be re.
967;We have an LG, and love it.
968;I remember watching the original movie years ago and still it touches my heart when I watch it now.
969;A story of history that should not be forgotten and in this film they have done a great job, good enough that it will be remembered
970;ray movie but this is so much better.
971;This set allows you to view the movie in any way you choose.
972;I may have gone a bit overboard but I loved this movie and I still do.
973;the Movie:The movie itself looks amazing.
974;There was so many extras and goodies!
975;"There are two new documentaries and that's IT for ""new"" goodies that I could find."
976;"The two ""new"" documentaries are good ."
977;The documentary on the film is worth a watch and does have new snippets here and there of behind the scene footage I'd not seen before and some new interviews that were interesting to see.
978;It also brought to my attention, and the attention of many others, five people who made this past year brilliant for me, Gaelic Storm, aka the steerage band.
979;and the beauty of this film will be revealed.
980;The one thing that has come out of all of this is just how good a film this is.
981;The technology, which I have to assume is not only costly but time consuming, enhances a really nice photography job by adding depth and dimension.
982;I'm o. k. with the enhancement and think Cameron and his people made a very well done movie even better.
983;I enjoyed the opportunity to pay attention to a the wonderful small details I missed the first time around and am pleased to see this being introduced to a new generation of movie viewers.
984;James Cameron you are a genius!
985;special edition is on the drawing boards.you crafty lot!
986;I wait with baited breath.
987;Horrible character developmentI really appreciate a good romance/drama and actually WANT to care about what happens to the heros / protaganists.
988;she seems like a really sweet lady.
989;i decided to watch the actual movie and there are more special features about the making of the movie that you can either watch all at once, or as they are relevent to the scene being watched.
990;These are very good and are worth the cost of the edition if you have any interest in the secrets of how the movie was made.
991;so if you are a real fan of the movie, or just movie making in general, this is a good collection.
992;The only thing that saved this film from total turkeydom in my opinion is the amazing special effects during the sinking scene, a Cameron trademark, and the enjoyment of seeing a few Cameron regulars (Bill Paxton and Jeanette Goldstein, to name a few).
993;good Will Hunting, all the way!
994;Did they even need the Titanic to tell this weak romantic story: poor artist boy meets girl, boy saves girl, boy and girl fall in love, Mother doesn't approve of poor boy and says: 'Girl, marry rich boy,' girl 'just says no,' boy and girl have sex, boy sacrifices himself for girl, girl lives a good life with memory of boy always.
995;A woman's heart is a great ocean, for gods sake?
996;This is the best movie!!!!
997;I saw Titanic in the theaters 7 times when it came out and its still my favorite all these years later.
998;"I see that ""Titanic"" is being re."
999;d, so hopefully in the near future it will be available in 3.
1000;The expectations were incredibly high for this film when it was released, and remarkably, it exceeded them all.
1001;What a vivid, wonderful victorian world we are shown!
1002;creation of the most famous ocean liner ever is breathtaking.
1003;Perhaps the plot of the young lovers is well.
1004;worn, but Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet bring such charm and sincerity to their roles, we fall in love with them as do with each other.
1005;time Hollywood at its best, and one can't help but wonder why films like this seem only to come around once a blue moon.
1006;faced leading men, I look at this movie with more mature and calm eyes and my honest opinion is, it just isn't that great.
1007;Everyone knows about the nude scene and the car scene.
1008;One of the officers shoots himself in the head near the end.
1009;"A more natural look, with her hair neatly up, would have given me a much more ""period"" feeling about her."
1010;She's disrespectful, can't make up her mind what she wants.
1011;It's funny the things that appeal to you as a young weird teenager, because I see nothing now in Leo that's particularly wonderful, in looks or in acting.
1012;He talked like a decent, respectable Irishman and outshone everyone else in the cast for the simple reason that he, obviously, knows how to ACT.
1013;Oh, yes, the special effects.
1014;At times I thought the moving water was no better than the old method of rear projection .
1015;the music is very nice too.
1016;TITANIC was the first major blockbuster that I have ever seen in the theaters at the age of seven or eight.
1017;TITANIC was one of those films that gave me a better understanding of life and death at a young age and it's one of those films to treasure at any age.
1018;ray you can certainly witness the beauty of TITANIC in the way you were meant to see it.
1019;"I almost had to hold back tears when I saw the scene of Jack and Rose on the bow of the ship where Rose goes ""I'm flying,"" and then you see the amazing shot of the ship turning."
1020;ray captures those moments in a way that you were meant to see it and it makes you feel like you're really there.
1021;ray version of TITANIC captures the experience of seeing the movie in the way audiences were meant to see it in 1997 when it was first released and I think this blu.
1022;ray movies continue to be released.
1023;It'a a whole new way of seeing the film in a whole new way.
1024;i'll start with Titanic's (few) good points.
1025;What I liked about this film were the excellent costumes and sets.
1026;The costumes really reflected the feel and style of the early 20th century.
1027;The sets also brought all those old, black.
1028;All the typical characters are there: Rich Girl, Poor Boy, Snobbish Mother, Self.
1029;It's absolutely disgusting that anyone can even mention this film in the same conversation with Gone with the wind.
1030;"It had a much more certain role than any of the so. called ""stars"" of this dreadful spectacle, and it did its job with much more style."
1031;It was with absolute pleasure that I watched Jack sink into oblivion.
1032;in all, an absolutely DISGUSTING display.
1033;Ended up watching it myself and this movie has so much feeling.
1034;Both Leonardo and Kate were so convincing.
1035;One I love to own!
1036;This is because the visuals are absolutely extrordinary.
1037;The scope and glory of the cinematography, combined with Cameron's impeccable sense of visual moments , make this film a sheer delight for the eyes.
1038;In fact, the best moments are just visual: the transitions from present to past and back, Rose and Jack kissing on the bow at sunset, Jack drawing Rose (a nude scene overwhelmingly aesthetic, rather than sexual), harrowing bits in the sinking sequence, dead Jack slowly descending into the dark of the ocean.
1039;in which you a good third of the picture .
1040;or widescreen , which gives you the whole movie, only smaller.
1041;While the latter is certainly the way to go, the diminishment of the visual element brings to focus the drawback of the movie.
1042;The excellent supporting cast, in particular Gloria Stuart and Victor Garber, just don't have enough to do to make up for him.
1043;If you have seen it in the cinema, best to be content with that.
1044;Like many who live to a productive old age, Rose lived with love and dignity.
1045;Now that all of that has had its time and that time has passed, what remains for us to concentrate on instead is simply the presence of a great motion picture.
1046;"Titanic is a tour de force spectacle that forever raises the bar for all films and redefines what the word ""blockbuster"" means."
1047;This love story, tragedy, special effects showcase, historical film par excellence holds up flawlessly today and in some ways might even be better now not only because of that fact, but because once someone can separate James Cameron's achievement from the hype and hoopla that once all but swallowed Titanic, epic though it was, what is left is a film that is all the more surpassing for what it offers on camera.
1048;scale loss, Titanic is a movie that will always have meaning to viewers in any age, and for that reason and for every other I've cited, it is a classic and always will be.
1049;This being my favorite movie I was not sure if they could impress me, but they did!
1050;I would recommend this to any true fan.
1051;Even if you own a previous version this is well worth it.
1052;`Titanic' has already been cemented in the history books as one of cinemas finest accomplishments, hailed by critic after critic as the best disaster film ever released, and even further, one of the greatest films ever.
1053;I believe `Titanic' won because it struck a chord with modern day America, much like the recent `Brokeback Mountain' (although `BBM' didn't fair as well at the Oscars).
1054;just breathtaking) and Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is just a sideline, just a plot to keep you watching, but it's the growth that Rose's character undergoes, the release sort.
1055;speak that she encounters that really is the base of this extraordinary film.
1056;She gained happiness and the will to move on.
1057;There are two scenes in particular when you see this transformation in Rose.
1058;She glances to her right and she sees a young woman gripping the railing for dear life and she's all alone.
1059;You can see in her face, Rose's face, that she knows she has everything she needs with her at that very moment.
1060;After the initial shock is over and she has stopped repeating his name she lays her head on his hand and closes her eyes, catching her breath, and as you can only imagine, contemplates whether she really wants to be rescued.
1061;But before the thought can fully cross her mind her eyes are open and you can see this conviction, this dire motivation to live.
1062;She is her own person, and as we realized the moment she jumped from the lifeboat back into the sinking ship, Rose has taken hold of the life she should have never let go of in the first place.
1063;rose loved Jack for setting her free.
1064;"I personally feel they truly loved one another, for when Jack says, ""winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me"" you believe him for you know he's right."
1065;as the final frames of this film roll on we see a desk cluttered with pictures of young Rose making it count, doing everything that Jack inspired her to do.
1066;She embodied her character and proved to be the lifeblood of this beautiful and heart wrenching film.
1067;With just her eyes and the slightest movement in her face she creates a feeling and tells a story that all can read, a story of a young woman afraid of everything, a young woman that finally learned to love, to live and to fly (cut to corniest part of the film for visual effect.
1068;other than that the realistic clarity is a marvle to behold!I truly waited for the best of movie to become BlueRay and now my movie collection maybe complete for now.
1069;this is certainly one of the very best mtion pictures of all time!
1070;For now I'm enjoying the Blu.
1071;ray copy with is exceptional.
1072;8 years ago, audiences around the world fell in love with this movie and it won a record 11 Oscars and became the highest grossing film of all time (with worldwide box office reciepts greater than $1.8 billion).
1073;whether you love the film, or hate it, no one can deny that it is a well.
1074;The scope and magnitude of this picture was unprecedented and to this day, there are very few films with such a high calibre as TITANIC.
1075;It was like watching it again for the first time, and my wife and family loved it.
1076;I believe that the sound was also enhanced from the previous release.
1077;It seemed both more clean and spacial.
1078;Of course you're going to achieve big box office bucks when you put Leonardo DiCaprio in a movie!
1079;He is of course one of Hollywood's biggest heartthrobs, and at his peak, ANY girl would go see ANYTHING he made even the littlest appearance in.
1080;This movie did a pretty good attempt at making a historical event enjoyable for young viewers, and it was a creative idea for simple minds.
1081;The best actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), the best actress (Kate Winslet), and the best supporting cast of all time.
1082;I mean, Mali Finn really did a stunning job casting actors and actresses that resembled their real life counterparts.
1083;Isn't it amazing how similar Kathy Bates compares to the real Molly Brown?
1084;thematically, this film was everything beyond it's time, and I think it's everything beyond our time today.
1085;Avatar is an exception, as there are many recurring themes throughout both movies (love, technology, man vs. nature, etc.) and the fact that James Cameron wrote them at the same time, still an amazing movie regardless.
1086;The fact that Titanic speaks on so many levels, and the fact that it was an event that really happened, makes this a journey I had to experience over and over.
1087;Of course, one of the reasons the story is so good is because DiCaprio and Winslet did an absolutely unbelievable job working together and putting out work that is instilled in all of us.
1088;There are plenty of other feats they accomplished that were years ahead, but the most important part is that they did their job of engrossing us into the movie that makes us watch it over and over again.
1089;all in all, this is a fantastic movie that will stand the test of time.
1090;"The story captured us, the themes inspired us, and the drama overwhelmed us, but most importantly, was a powerful message: ""only life is priceless, and to make each day count."""
1091;It was very well done.
1092;This movie showed lots of action and romance.
1093;the Titanic was a great ship!
1094;i would highly recommend this to anyone.
1095;James Cameron more successfully explores the concept of free.
1096;"The Titanic is a thrilling and mind blown movie
I:30;1097;this movie consists of the great historic movie of Titanic.
I:30;1098;The character Known as Jack Dawson captures the heart of a rich girl named Rose .
I:30;1099;So she has to pick .
I:30;1100;The boat is hit by a iceberg and Jack and Rose both survive the first event of the sinking of the boat.
I:30;1101;So, they finally come up with a Expanded version of a great movie.
I:30;1102;package and sell it again and again?
I:30;1103;I am so thankful I responded to that sudden urge because this is truly the most moving motion picture I have ever seen.
I:30;1104;I immediately fell in love with every single thing about it, even the love story of Jack and Rose.
I:30;1105;In this epic, we see the humanity of everyone on board, from the first class passengers to the third class folks below deck to the hard.
I:30;1106;some people don't like the love story in the film, but I found it magical.
I:30;1107;The complexity of Rose, engaged to wealth and status but yearning for something real that cannot be bought, calls out to the humanity in all of us, and we delight in her forbidden romance with the poor and socially inferior Jack Dawson, ready to take up arms ourselves against her rogue of a fianc and his dastardly henchman.
I:30;1108;encompassing love we all seek but a rare few of us ever find.
I:30;1109;equally powerful is the extraordinary presentation of the Titanic's final hour.
I:30;1110;The surreal aspect of it all, with the music playing in the background while brave men say a final goodbye to their wives and children in the lifeboats and less fortunate men, women, and children stop to embrace death in whatever way they can, is truly magical and tugs at the heart.
I:30;1111;the incredible music accompanying this film is also intensely moving, whether it is reinforcing the passion of true love newly found or lamenting the tragedy of souls lost.
I:30;1112;If the love story and tragedy do not bring tears to your eyes, the extraordinary music will.
I:30;1113;The ending is to my eyes absolutely perfect and truly beautiful.
I:30;1114;This movie affects me greatly no matter how many times I have already watched it.
I:30;1115;I hope that some of those individuals vowing never to watch Titanic will reconsider their decision"
1116;Product came in great condition.
1117;The special effects are impeccable, as is Cameron's historical detail.
1118;away line, but it is, in fact, an important historical detail.
1119;This may seem to be a small detail to those of you who love to hate Leonardo Decaprio, or love to malign films simply because they are so hugely successful, but James Cameron has created a movie masterpiece.
1120;But in terms of sheer movie making, the production aspects, Titanic ranks among the best films ever made.
1121;The cultural phenomenon is an extra bonus to keep the event of the film alive in our consciousness.
1122;Very few films that appeal to as broad an audience as Titanic feature a self.
1123;No happy ending here, and many young people found this fact intriguing enough to sit through it again and again.
1124;This is not a franchise like Star Wars, but is a single film that has ensured Cameron's place among Hollywood's greatest directors.
1125;Leonardo DiCaprio was terrific as Jack Dawson.
1126;Should have won 2 MORE Academy Awards: Best Actor (Dicaprio) and Best Supporting Actor (Zane).
1127;My apologies to Kundera, but this is, in a way, what he was talking.
1128;A classic with many parts to it .
1129;the first half is more fun to watch than the second half, with all of the panic trying to flee the ship .
1130;Even the flashbacks are worth watching and add much to the film .
1131;Fall in love after two and a half days and she's already opening her legs in the back of a car.
1132;Rose is no better than Cal she's spitting in his face, cheating, and giving people the finger, so classy.
1133;"In the history of the world, the best example of giving ones life to save the life of another is found in the true story of the Titanic disaster
I:30;1134;He allows his son to die for all mankind to live.
I:30;1135;For God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten son.
I:30;1136;The Bridge is an even better analogy and schoolmaster because no lives were being saved by Abraham's sacrifice.
I:30;1137;For these reasons, I believe """"The Bridge"""" is the most important motion picture ever produced."""
1138;see all of my Reviews.
1139;I am absolute delighted with it.
1140;I Really Liked This Movie.
1141;And It Deserve 11 Awards!!!!!!!!!!!
1142;Anytime you get to watch this film, you realize just how brilliant it was.
1143;The vision of director James Cameron brought to life a story that was so tragic in reality but on film became so hauntingly beautiful that one could watch it over and over again.
1144;Excellent acting performances, brilliant musical score and the costuming and cinematography.
1145;it was so entertaining I saw it 9 times.
1146;it truly deserved all 11 Oscars including best picture.
1147;i give this movie 5 stars for great special effects and for a good story line.
1148;Fast shipping brand new with plastic packaging very happy customers.
1149;I orered it and it was here two days later.
1150;the sets, costimes, and cinematography are predictably expert .
1151;There is really nothing to say but this is the greatest love story of our time and a very good drama this movie is awesome.
1152;one of Leonardo Dicaprio's Best performance of his Carer I Recommend it for everyone
1153;i, for one, am very happy that its a 2 disk movie.
1154;Ben Hur, the other film that won 11 Oscars, made the American Film Institute's top 100 list, but beyond the great chariot race, few people have great affection for it because of its aloof and emotionally distant tone.
1155;but my best guess is in about 20 years, people will come to better appreciate this film as being deserving to be placed in the classic category, flaws and all, primarily because of its global impact at the time it was released and its INTENTIONAL use of maudlin themes and a romantic narrative that truly borrows from the glory days of romantic American cinema of the 1930s and 1940s.
1156;Titanic may not be Gone With the Wind, but the comparison is good.
1157;And this is Titanic's overriding strength.
1158;In fact, there was initial fondness that the film still held together, despite well.
1159;Hence upon seeing Titanic the first time, I was amazed the story was engaging at all, albeit in an idealized 1940s style, cliches and all.
1160;It's equally amazing that any film can become a box.
1161;The romance is what made Titanic popular, especially with young people.
1162;lifted even higher by its perfect ending (always the most important factor determining whether a film has a chance of entering the pantheon of greats.)
1163;The amount of work and detail that James Cameron and Co. went to in order to make this movie is mind boggling.
1164;Great movie, a real classic and top notch movie making at its best in an age when you think that they just don't make em like they used too.
1165;well, this one is one of the best movies every made.
1166;The movie Titanic is one of those great movies of all time.
1167;Nothing will jump out of the screen, but the added depth is a bonus while watching the movie.
1168;I think this gets my top vote, even above Avatar, I can't say enough about this movie!
1169;Storyline was actually very good but a second rate script,casting and acting took a lot away from this.
1170;What saved this movie was outstanding sets,effects and scoring.
1171;I am convinced this is the best movie ever made.
1172;It has everything from amazing special effects to tragedy to romance to adventure.you name it.
1173;The remastered version has a terrific look.
1174;"Titanic is a ""must own"" film and this is the premier version."
1175;something about it made us go back again and again.
1176;"I am glued once again to the smaller screen with James Cameron's ""Titanic."""
1177;8 years later, and I kind of thought this then .
1178;The script is the weakest link in what is otherwise his greatest achievement.
1179;The score, and the performances by the primary list of characters continue to hold up!I am most surprised in this day and age (2005) .
1180;"I enjoyed watching the full hour of deleted scenes
I:30;1181;I love anything with Leonardo in it!
I:30;1182;Saw this movie when it first came out and wanted to see it again.
I:30;1183;Will probably watch again and not very movies I care to see more then once.
I:30;1184;This movie deserves 5 stars because it is the greatest movie known to man kind.
I:30;1185;It bring tears of joy and pain all at once!
I:30;1186;One of my favorite movies.
I:30;1187;This movie is a very wonderful and is a piece of movie with much intense and suspense scenes.
I:30;1188;The background scene of this movie especially on the Titanic(the scenery) is truly admirable.
I:30;1189;It is so beautiful and it's perfect to symbolize romance that this movie is focusing on.
I:30;1190;besides, it is an unbelievably touching story.
I:30;1191;The story line moves slowly and I could really understand the entire movie(the message and overall meaning that it brings) well.
I:30;1192;The performence by the great actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are very amazing and they capture my attention to this movie.
I:30;1193;I can feel the presence of real feelings and romance in their characters throughout the movie.
I:30;1194;The songs in this movie are so soothing and sweet(especially 'My Heart Will Go On').
I:30;1195;So, in overall this movie is well.
I:30;1196;acted, got a beautiful story line(touching as well) and sweet soundtracks.
I:30;1197;Those who hasn't watch this movie should really go and watch it.
I:30;1198;afterall, this movie was hyped as a mega blockbuster that would later become a winner of 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture.
I:30;1199;This was actually very interesting to watch and listen to why James Cameron removed those scenes.
I:30;1200;construction timelapse, deep dive presentation, video matics, video effects breakdowns, still galleries and so much more.
I:30;1201;the number of TITANIC footage on this Special Collector's Edition is simply amazing.
I:30;1202;ray yet and people are reviewing this movie.
I:30;1203;This is much better than word of mouth led me to believe.
I:30;1204;Still the cinematography is wonderful, Kate Winslet is captivating, and the plot clever.
I:30;1205;Kate Winslet as his intended is a ravishing beauty with oomph and a mind of her own.
I:30;1206;Leonardo DiCaprio as the wily and clever sketch artist who seduces her while twice saving her life comes across curiously as part Huck Finn and part John Boy.
I:30;1207;Good, clever, hard working poor people.
I:30;1208;But the romantic bow scene was artfully staged, and after that Kate came to life.
I:30;1209;But her part was so big and she had so much to do that her natural talent overcame the early junior high school text and the later schmaltz.
I:30;1210;And since the audience knows eighty.
I:30;1211;Simply because it was a popular lavish production squarely in the Hollywood tradition, employing a whole bunch of movie folk, and it was a financial success, just what the industry craves.
I:30;1212;I should add that everything technical in the film was excellent, and Cameron's dramatic direction was a lot better than his dialogue.
I:30;1213;You get a pretty average trailer, and that's it!
I:30;1214;i absolutely adore this movie.
I:30;1215;The whole relationship between Jack Rose (a relationship which has been copied in many other movies about the Titanic) is so sweet, although they may seem in love, Rose only says it to Jack once and that's when they're both in the water.
I:30;1216;When Jack draws Kate, it's actually James Cameron's hands.
I:30;1217;what a scary thought!This is a terrific movie.
I:30;1218;But it's the whole romance about it, and the whole history of it.
I:30;1219;It was well acted and you noticed lots of things missed on the first showing
I:30;1220;I've always loved this movie.
I:30;1221;Sacrifice is made and tragedy happens, but those who are important will linger with us.
I:30;1222;Great movie and glad I found it here!
I:30;1223;Underneath, it is an extremely well made film, Cameron's attention to detail is astounding"
1224;At the films heart though, it is a dramatic piece, and judging by the standard by which you judge them, it isnt great.
1225;All in all it is a good film but it is certainly not one of the best.
1226;Fabulous cinematography, amazing effects of the sinking ship, lots of real facts woven in among the fictional story make this a very captivating movie.
1227;Many people thought it was bring an end to his career.
1228;"All these concerns and predictions were shattered when 'Titanic' came out
I:30;1229;I went to the theatres to see it with family and friends.
I:30;1230;It was an incredible experience and several people around me were crying.
I:30;1231;First of all, the graphics in 'Titanic' have not aged well.
I:30;1232;They must love each other so much that they can't think of anything else to say.
I:30;1233;this upgrade is nicely done.
I:30;1234;will get to watch it many more times.
I:30;1235;All I want to know is what were the people who loved this movie thinking?
I:30;1236;I was FORCED to see it by a friend and I have to say that the only good thing about the whole experience was that I got to take a 2 hour nap.
I:30;1237;Jack and Rose protray two mismatched lovers that break the rules according to class.
I:30;1238;There are several aspects that one can look at this movie: The cast of the show are diverse and some seem to believe that Jack was to young for Rose, however, I liked their chemistry on the screen.
I:30;1239;now to pull all three of these aspects and have it play so smoothly, was wonderful.
I:30;1240;Having all that water to deal with was spectacular.
I:30;1241;I love the behind the scenes looks at how the movie was done love how the cast and crew got along so well seeing """"Cal"""" and """"Roses's Mother"""" out of character and particular how the women in the film were actually dressed with corsets etc as they would have been in 1912."""
1242;It was a fabulous movie and I still love it 8 years later.
1243;Heart wenching, beautiful to look at, great acting.
1244;(what an original title by the way).
1245;Most of which are several times better than this.
1246;Best picture, film editing, director, and screenplay should have gone directly to AS GOOD AS IT GETS, and I'm not just saying that because I happen to be an Opsessive compulsive.
1247;It may not of had the impressive sets or production design, but it had something TITANIC could never have, the ability to convince an audience.
1248;What I'm trying to say is simple.
1249;I especially love the fact that the entire plot of the movie revolves around two teenagers jumping and running thru the ship just to make out.
1250;I decided to go against peer pressure and watch it and now it is one of my favourite films of all time.
1251;The acting is superb and you forget that you are watching Kate Winslet and Leo and really get into the characters.
1252;The 'love story' is really captivating because of the fantastic chemistry between these two.
1253;For anyone who enjoys a really good film that incorporates romance, great performances, action, drama, great sets, costumes and immense special effects, then Titanic is the film for you.
1254;groomed steerage class passenger catches the eye of beautiful, haughty first class passenger aboard a doomed ocean liner.
1255;"There are few movies that in my opinion rival the emotional power of 1997's epic ""Titanic"" which is still one of the greatest movies ever made to this very day."
1256;The sets on this movie are among the greatest I've ever seen.
1257;The titanic scenes, most of them at least, were in fact shot on a real replica of the ship.
1258;Titanic is arguably one of the greatest masterpieces ever made and only James Cameron's extremely powerful directing could've made it such a powerful, riveting, and emotional experience.
1259;"cameron is one of my all time favorite directors and his movies are among the greatest I've ever seen but I've got to give my hats off as ""Titanic"" is without a doubt his greatest achievement of all time and I highly recommend this today!"
1260;While this movie will never replace Santa Claus Conquers the Martians or Plan Nine From Outer Space as the worst Hollywoodmovie of all times, it certainly ranks as one of the most BORING.
1261;director James Cameron's target audience is obviously 11.16 year old American girls.
1262;Hollywood has done variations on this theme of doomed love dozens of times throughout the 30's, 40's and 50's, and done it better.
1263;developed character in the whole film, and that is the character of Rose, played by Kate Winslett.
1264;Everytime Cameron's camera finds something of interest to focus on, it cuts away.
1265;Okay, we've shown you that,now back to our love story!
1266;See the 1953 version with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck.
1267;It's got a love story, too.
1268;dimensional characters you can care about and a storyline which involves you!
1269;It's funny in a way.
1270;But what a marvelous and equitable exchange.
1271;(Great bit, John, thanks for letting me borrow it.)
1272;I'll just give you my own personal take on it, okay?
1273;I realize he's a talented filmmaker and a big mover and shaker in the biz (and he couldn't care less that I'm writing this) but the fact that he wrote it, directed it, and produced it, and everything else he had a hand in gives the whole production a kind of one dimensional feel.
1274;One can smell the self.
1275;fiction stories with messages about ourselves and each other with regard to the future which give the audience something to think about besides oh, what a great line!
1276;nuclear power but loves hydrolic machinery.
1277;At first I thought that this was the first love story that Cameron had ever directed.
1278;Which brings me to the actual sinking.
1279;I'll be the first to admit, the special effects were impressive.
1280;You start a story with everything fine.
1281;And those who wanted the Titanic to arrive in New York and have a Disney.
1282;Titanic is a classic hit.
1283;The movie ran fine with great resolution.
1284;I would highly recommend this move to those Titanic enthusiasts.
1285;The Titanic is a symbol of fascination for millions of people, its tragic story weaving a web of enchantment in our minds.
1286;Many films have tried to capture the events of the great ship's demise, but none of them can compare to James Cameron's Titanic, an epic of grand proportions.
1287;The sweeping grandeur and large scale used for the film bring the Titanic to breathtaking life, and Cameron's attention to meticulous detail makes this recreation superior to all others.
1288;His insertion of a fictional love story does not bog the movie down, but gives it an emotional terminal with which the audience can connect.
1289;based, which gives the film a more authentic as well as emotional feel to it.
1290;Now as luck would have it, his interview with a news crew provides a glimpse of that rare work of art, drawing the attention of Rose Calvert, who immediately calls Lovett and heads out to the ship's location.
1291;she finds an outlet, of course, in Jack Dawson, with whom she develops a friendship as the ship makes its first voyage across the ocean.
1292;top if it looked expensive enough.
1293;Cameron's attention to detail keeps us from haggling over historical accuracy and allows us to follow the human story he embodies in Jack and Rose.
1294;"this aspect of the movie is worked quite nicely
I:30;1295;The answers unfold, pretty much one right after another, allowing us to pay more attention to the technical details of the sinking as well as those involved in key scenes.
I:30;1296;this movie gives us unique perspectives of the grand ship, before, during and after its intense demise.
I:30;1297;The use of computerized effects in addition to scale models and life.
I:30;1298;size sets all contribute to making the audience wonder what is computer and what is reality.
I:30;1299;Everything is perfectly placed, seamless and true to life, and vividly recreates every nuance of the Titanic's life with austerity and grandeur.
I:30;1300;I felt that the special effects, while being plentiful, did not weigh the story down"
1301;the cast for this movie is superb, with our star.
1302;This is probably the only movie I'll ever be able to sit through that has him in its cast, but he does quite well, and he and Winslet have an intense chemistry that is believable and never questioned.
1303;Winslet is the most complex character, experiencing emotions from both sides, and her decisions and thought processes are conveyed beautifully by the actress.
1304;Rounding out the cast are veteran actress Gloria Stuart, playing Old Rose with wit and emotion, Bill Paxton in the role of Lovett, Bernard Hill, Francis Fisher, Jonathan Hyde and Victor Garber, among others, and all of whom bring added life and angles to the storytelling.
1305;Titanic is universal in that it offers something for everyone: visuals for the FX aficionados, a romantic love story for those with soft spots, and a historical accuracy unparalleled by any other film.
1306;This film brings Titanic back to life, puts you on those decks with our characters, and then pulls them out from under you as its story's intensity heightens.
1307;The success of this film is as colossal as its subject matter, which makes it one of the best motion pictures of 1997 as well as of all time.
1308;art CGI and a relentless attention to detail, James Cameron successfully captures the human tragedy of April 15, 1912, when over fifteen hundred people perished in the icy waters of the North Atlantic.
1309;The magnitude of the tragedy, of the largest luxury liner in the world sinking on its maiden voyage, is vividly conveyed.
1310;The film Titanic is a true director's success.
1311;I admire James Cameron for his commitment to bringing to life the tragic story of the RMS Titanic.
1312;He has introduced the true feeling of the time to millions of people all over the world.
1313;This film deserved every Oscar it received, especially Best Picture.
1314;I think Titanic and Gone With The Wind make a great couple.
1315;I am so glad that this movie has got the special treatment it deserves after 7 years of waiting.
1316;For a $200 million movie that could have easily been a flop, it managed to make $1.8 billion dollars in cinema and video sales, making this the BIGGEST movie of all time, because it touched so many people's feelings.
1317;also, I'll be getting the 4.
1318;hur with 11 Oscars but this picture did NOT have a single actor won one of these.
1319;the best part of this movie was when find reotardo diCrapio frozen in the water.
1320;My mom always crys and I can hold it in.
1321;Truly a wonderful film, wonderful story and great actors.
1322;This would make a wonderful holiday gift.
1323;I would recommend this to a friend.
1324;I'll give credit where credit is due, the visuals are outstanding.
1325;For that breathtaking depiction alone, this film deserves 5 stars.
1326;meanwhile, sit back and watch an amazing recreation of the sinking of the unsinkable.
1327;No question: Director Cameron was the right man for this job.
1328;Titanic is a grand cinematic achievement that does not fail to release its hold on you, no matter how many times you view it!
1329;From the first ghostly images of the wreck as the emerge from the gloom, to Rose's final reunion with Jack, this is a film that takes you on a grand adventure for three hours.
1330;Both these scenes still have the power to bring tears to my eyes, and I've seen the film 7 times at present count!
1331;Leonardo DeCaprio is perfect in the role of Jack Dawson, the vagabond artist who meets Debutante Rose Dewitt Bukater and opens her eyes to the world beyond her stuffy social circle.
1332;Their budding love makes Jack's death all the more tragic, as you find yourself hoping that somehow they'll overcome all and be able to live happily ever after.
1333;A Great set for a Great Movie!!!!!!!
1334;The full power of modern cinema brought to bear on a story of a ship reputed to be unsinkable.
1335;fated ship and meets the beautiful Rose (Kate Winslet).
1336;Young Jack is fresh from the world and an artist to boot.
1337;He offers a view of life denied to the young woman who has everything for the asking except the freedom to express herself.
1338;A finely crafted picture, over long and sad, this is an engaging story.
1339;First of All we all know Titanic is a masterpiece so that saves me the explaining.
1340;Highly recommend this as an upgrade to your old version.
1341;This was a great movie in the original format.
1342;It is worth the investment.
1343;The colors are vivid, a lot of contrast, very clear picture.
1344;There is a lot of depth throughout the movie, which is also visable in darker scenes.
1345;i liked this movie not because of the love story (and, yes, I'm one of those saps who can't help but cry as Rose lets Jack go after the ship has sunk and he disappears into the freezing darkness of the Atlantic) but because of the attention that was paid to the actual sinking.
1346;two thumbs up for the historical accuracy.
1347;d to be so good since it wasn't filmed in real.
1348;I was very supprised that the effects were so great!
1349;This film's core audience moved on to Twilight following this.
1350;I rated this movie 5 stars because it is one of my most favorite movies of all time.
1351;it tickled me to see how it arrived .
1352;When people say this is the Greatest Movie Ever the only thing I can do is laugh.
1353;I like Leonardo and the story is suspenseful as it tells the story of love across class lines .
1354;Billy Zane is a caricature of a villain, and is almost hysterically funny.
1355;The third class passengers are all noble and brave.
1356;"rose scenes, and view some of the scenes of the ship and the sinking
I:30;1357;but,it's a wonderful movie, nonetheless.
I:30;1358;This three disc special edition is a great set for all collectors to have.
I:30;1359;The special features on this edition are amazing and to see how James Cameron was able to make the movie look like you were on the Titanic itself back in 1912 is outstanding.
I:30;1360;Even the fine details that they put into the set is excellent.
I:30;1361;I love this movie Titanic , I know that I am going to be able to enjoy watching this movie over and over again.
I:30;1362;I want to thank you for a wonderful movie.
I:30;1363;I watch the news every every day I need something light and it needs to be enjoyable to wanch.
I:30;1364;It was better than ever before!
I:30;1365;The special effects still hold up today (and dare I say looks better than movies being released lately).
I:30;1366;Brilliant direction from James Cameron.
I:30;1367;One of the most iconic and beautiful film scores ever created.
I:30;1368;It all looks and sounds better on blu ray!
I:30;1369;Like everyone I had seen this in the theaters way back when and still loved it this time.
I:30;1370;viewing """"Titanic"""" to learn about the ship is alot like viewing """"Gone With The Wind"""" to learn about the Civil War."""
1371;In both cases the titles are vital settings that are done extraordinarily well, but the films are both about the same something else.
1372;The life changing event that caused epiphanies in the female leads are what Titanic, and Gone With The Wind are all about.
1373;* Branching viewing option to see background materials.
1374;There are powerful, even grisly scenes, and the depiction of the sinking is grand and accurate, but the story is more about the romance between Rose and Jack, than anything else.
1375;It will make you want to watch this movie again and again.
1376;It's a whole new viewing experience.
1377;Why was it so popular, why did it win so many awards and why are so many people in love with it?This film won best picture, beating out the true best film of '97, LA Confidential.
1378;That movie had one of the most interesting stories, and some of the best dialogue a Hollywood movie has had in ages.
1379;The story of the Titanic is well known, and has been done to death in the past.
1380;i honestly can't see the film's appeal.
1381;A must see for the historic crowd as well as the love story crowd.
1382;Titanic was,without a doubt,the most captivating and vivid film I ever seen.
1383;Amazing stars such as Kate Winslet,Billy Zane,Gloria Stuart,Frances Fisher, Leo DiCaprio, Bill Paxton ,etc, set the stage for one the most riveting dramas ever put to film.
1384;Jack and Rose pulled us into their world,demanding that we see and understand the horror of April 15,1912.
1385;For anyone who loves a good romance, heartstopping drama, and amazing special effects, I recommend that you book your passage on The Ship Of Dreams.
1386;this movie is a masterpiece.
1387;extremely great acting,cast and titanic ship that took three years and a few months to make,just for this movie
1388;While it is hard to say that this was the best picture of last year (it truly wasn't) it still deserves the strong praise it received.
1389;not since Atlanta was burned in Gone With the Wind has Hollywood produced a movie that is great epic spectacle.
1390;James Cameron's Titanic is a rare film by today's standards for many reasons.
1391;There's a kind of magic going on with this film, and everyone involved has a hand in it.
1392;Cameron's direction is both inspired and loving.
1393;His camera often sweeps through scenes and across characters like a lover's hand.
1394;The photography and visual effects are rich with warmth and color, more like artwork than film.
1395;The musical score is hauntingly beautiful, and the actors are all good in their roles.
1396;Perhaps the most mesmerizing part of the entire film is Gloria Stuart, who's performance provides the heartbeat beneath the iron skin of Titanic.
1397;com and saw a 3.5 star rating for one of the most powerful films I've witnessed I expected so see a flood of typo.
1398;I found the whinners, but a lot of them seem to by fairly intelligent reviewers, and I can't figure out why.
1399;Certainly, the main protagonists present attractive and enjoyable personages, but the real power of the movie is in the reality of the actual event, and the incredible ability of Mr. Cameron to place us on and around the Titanic from departure to sinking.
1400;The movie is spectacular, enjoyable and worth the price of a ticket, but my vote for Best Picture would easily have gone to Good Will Hunting for a great script and excellent performances.
1401;Titanic is certainly one of the most prominent movies of the past twenty years, and this high.
1402;"The movie itself has a great deal of depth and mixes the historical accuracy well with the fictional storyline
I:30;1403;As far as the blu ray is concerned, it is certainly the appropriate medium to display a product that had the impact that this one did, definitely worth the extra couple bucks.
I:30;1404;With it's massive budget, huge scale sets, and costume and prop budget that could supply all of Chicago for a year, I found it to be the most detailed and beautifully filmed movie I have ever seen.
I:30;1405;Barring the fact that the story is fiction (hey, who knows?
I:30;1406;, the drama and intensity are mirrored by the technical and digital effects that are just as beautiful.
I:30;1407;James Cameron and his Digital Domain team have outdone themselves"
1408;People like Titanic specialist Ken Marschal was on hand during filming to be sure that accuracy was in top form.
1409;After seeing the movie twice, those details, in my opinion, are perfect.
1410;Remember that James Cameron wrote the screenplay himself and took out about 2 hours worth of extra footage in the final print.
1411;anyway, I think the experience of seeing this movie will be even greater by viewing it in the widescreen format.
1412;I loved it in the theatre and I will surely love it on video.
1413;It's been a while since I've seen it and it's really great on Blu Ray.
1414;This is one of my favorite movies!
1415;I've always loved this version of Titanic.
1416;I absolutely give this 3 disc Titanic an emphatic 2 thumbs up!
1417;ray would be a treat, a movie that demanded Hi.
1418;But for those that haven't seen the movie, or don't know much of the story I will say that Cameron works his writing wonders with this movie once again, the same way he has with T2 and True Lies.
1419;The movies keeps you wanting more.
1420;It is truly a soundtrack that has to be hear to be believed.
1421;As far as the Special Features go there is only the original theatrical trailer, which is in widescreen and very entertaining, along with some very nice animated menus.
1422;The product arrives quite promptly, and the condition is very good.
1423;This version also includes interesting special features/ behind the scenes making of the movie.
1424;hOWEVER, there were 2 highly redeeming aspects of this film that completely surprised and impressed me:1.
1425;marxist, Class Warfare subtext .
1426;developed than #1 during most of the movie.
1427;everybody approach that Cameron took, this could have been a truly great film.
1428;"as it stands, ""Titanic"" is fairly entertaining, in large part due to the charisma of the two young leads."
1429;enjoyable but not really worth owning.
1430;pensant* dismisses it as Hollywood: but it is great Hollywood.
1431;the best films are always chick flicks.
1432;uPDATE 5.17.2005Wow, another Nolan Ryan: another perfect game: 0 of 4.
1433;the film offends because it was popular without being a shootemup and Billy Zane (who first emerged as Sam Neill's and Nicole Kidman's dark American foil in Dead Calm, an enjoyable example of an anti.
1434;James Cameron is a genius!
1435;the film is one of the greatest of all time, and it's re.
1436;My two favorite movies of all time (ones I could watch over and over) are Titanic and Goodfellas.
1437;hard fan must have this set.
1438;I received it as a Christmas gift and one must devote several days to really go through the entire set.
1439;And making each day count.
1440;That one is the most accurate.
1441;"Compare this film with the ""Titanic"" of 1951 starring Barbara Stanwyck and Clifton Webb, the days of great actors and intelligent script writing."
1442;"Also, the even more superior ""A Night to Remember"" is much more satisfying than this piece of JUNK!"
1443;"if you want great cinama than please get ""A night to remamber""That is an underated masterpiece that is to about the Titanic."
1444;I rate this cause I have seen this many times and it has won 11 oscars.
1445;The movie is okay with the blu.
1446;I would recommend this to any of my friends and family.
1447;best love story movie i have ever watch in three D. i love it , i probably it over and ever again
1448;Titanic is possibly THE GREATEST movie in the history of EVER!
1449;I was crying (NOT because of Leo) but because this was a real event once upon a while ago, and even though the story of Jack and Rose is fictional, it is very well written and performed.
1450;touching story about a real event.
1451;I suggest you read up on the real story to get the full effect, but this movie does perfectly well as a way of telling the story if you're too lazy to READ!Documentaries SUCK.
1452;But with a playful plotline that you can focus on that brings out the reality of this story, you get the full effect.
1453;For all those who think this movie should be rated R, please keep this to yourselves.
1454;Back then, the human body was a beautiful thing.
1455;This movie has it all: Leonardo, Kate, love, mystery, scandal, sorrow.
1456;This is great, great movie that you will watch often year after year!
1457;Really good and beautiful movie.
1458;I still thought that Leo and Kate should have won for the best actor and actress that year.
1459;I still have VHS and still fine even after 12 years.
1460;I love this movie, and I have been waiting for its Blu.
1461;This was well worth the wait.
1462;The movie looks and sounds stunning.
1463;All of the special features are wonderful.
1464;The documentaries shine a lot of light on what James Cameron's intentions were.
1465;There's two kinds of people in this world: Those who love Titanic because it's an absolutely amazing movie that should jerk the tears right out of you and make you want to learn more than you already know about the unsinkable ship, and those who say they hated Titanic because they want the attention of being one of the few that hates such an obviously great movie.
1466;then again, it takes a lot of people to make the world go round.
1467;You'll be symphathetic to Rose's problems, which are particularly interesting considering she's so gorgeous and so loaded.
1468;He's also friendly, generous, and open, which makes it easy to admire the guy.3.5 hours for this movie to begin and finish, and there shouldn't be a single moment's worth of boredom to you, with the possible exception of the beginning of the movie, which shows modern day Bill Paxton looking for sunken Titanic treasure (I bet he was the first to ever think of that idea!
1469;The characters, as I said, are very likable, except for the villains, which are dislikable.
1470;the action is excellent, and the unbelievable stuff (Rose cutting through cuffs with an axe while her eyes are closed) doesn't leave you shaking your head.
1471;Rising water makes nobody comfy.
1472;the last hour or so was very touching, as the passengers and crew realize that the boat is sinking, and some are about to die.
1473;Their behaviour in these scenes is remarkable and real.
1474;this is just an awesome movie.
1475;For a movie this great, you need a LOT more.
1476;i bought a lot of blue.
1477;Oh, I love this movie!
1478;The costumes are really great, especially Roses.
1479;5 stars, and it's really worth it too.
1480;but the greatest thing I love in this movie, is Roses and Jacks love for each other.
1481;It's so great, that they don't care what other people thinks.
1482;This is my favorite movie!
1483;i love it looks so nice,,thank you
1484;This movie touched my heart and is my all time favorite movie.
1485;That's what makes recreating it fun.
1486;So there, I give one star to it's diversity of characters.
1487;I'm sure you thought it was amusing, Cameron, but why put us through it, seeing it on screen?Alrighty, after that we are introduced to Rose, 101.
1488;as another result, what made this movie again was the last hour or so, which is the most lavish, exessive, documentary of the Titanic, or anything for that matter, ever made, since it did not really connect with the first half.
1489;Gloria Stuart was my personal favorite, even though her character was almost out of place.
1490;oscar winner that pulls off the unique trick of being brilliant and rightly deserving its classic status with a movie that in places is toe.
1491;cameron is a genius with the visuals and action.
1492;"Everything looks utterly authentic
I:30;1493;So the relationship between Jack and Rose, although touching in places, is also heavy.
I:30;1494;I have enjoyed his work since I first saw him on Growing Pains, though I always thought he'd be better suited for the stage.
I:30;1495;Overall, I was disapointed with this film, yet still oddly entertained.
I:30;1496;This is a Great movie in the Blueray format.
I:30;1497;its play good and the right color and plays well so i like the product very muchand i also like the movie
I:30;1498;Great actors and the bewitching plot line keep you engrossed in the movie.
I:30;1499;the image and sound are simply perfect.
I:30;1500;I loved it then and now I still love it and it takes quite alot to interest me.
I:30;1501;This is one film that everyone has to see.
I:30;1502;I loved the part where Rose and Jack were running through the halls of the titanic while it was sInKiNg.
I:30;1503;the visual effects were clearly amazing and took a while to do.
I:30;1504;and the acting was believable.
I:30;1505;james Cameron's achievement will certainly move your heart.
I:30;1506;The sharpness of it all is just fantastic, and it just looks so real.
I:30;1507;I'm sort of a completist, so I'll surely be getting the U. s. 3 disc edition just for the sake of having the chance of experiencing this movie with the best audio format ever available: DTS!Enrique Aguilar.
I:30;1508;Titanic is a marvel to behold on the grandest spectacle.
I:30;1509;It's not a marvel because it's necessarily a terrific movie.
I:30;1510;I think it's a good movie, but not a masterpiece.
I:30;1511;You got Leonardo DiCaprio for the ladies, Kate Winslet for the guys, an epic film of great lenght for the rest of the movie.
I:30;1512;lovers out there, a 100+ year old actress for the older generation to reflect back on their own past loves, and the list goes on and on.
I:30;1513;Titanic was at the right place at the right time and Cameron knew it and capitalized.
I:30;1514;as for the merits of """"Titanic"""" itself, it's a good movie if one doesn't mind overlooking the cliches and for."""
1515;So I'll just settle for the next best thing and admire it from the comfort of my average, everyday home.
1516;You hit the jackpot, James Cameron, and I hate/admire you for it.
1517;Titanic is a great movie.
1518;Good plot, and great movie!Now that's entertainment!
1519;Now that I come back to it, my appreciation of the film has slightly waned.
1520;I'd still recommend it, but only for specific reasons.
1521;The words spoken by the main characters (especially Jack, Rose, and Cal) come straight out of a sappy soap opera.
1522;"Plus, the love story is one for the female audience
I:30;1523;But dialogue and romance aside, the film remains a visual masterpiece.
I:30;1524;It's still amazing that 1,500+ people perished in the Atlantic.
I:30;1525;Watch Titanic for its astonishing visuals, and for the powerful second half of the film.
I:30;1526;I refused to see it in the cinema and refused to watch it on video.
I:30;1527;The love story I could have done without.
I:30;1528;classic, well told and duly dramatic enough to convey the sheer magnitude of this tragedy.
I:30;1529;The set and costumes were lovely.
I:30;1530;There is such a thing as human feeling.
I:30;1531;a few people's idea of a good love story.
I:30;1532;It was historically accurated, entertaining, emotionally elavating and stimulating, etc.
I:30;1533;Find a movie you DID like, and review it.
I:30;1534;It is a wonderful movie.
I:30;1535;Very well written and keeps you watching from beginning to end!
I:30;1536;I think it is a must see for everyone.
I:30;1537;I recommend this movie 100%
I:30;1538;Very well put together and it brought just enough of the true facts and emotion into it to keep your interest.
I:30;1539;for one a lot of people complain about the script being so bad, but i don't see anything wrong with it, anyway, the acting is so good and strong that even if the script """"was"""" crap it wouldn't matter."""
1540;the speacil effects are amazing.
1541;it's like your really there and the titanic is sinking right in frount of you, this just draws you right into the movie.
1542;it is worth seeing the movie just for the love story, and then there's all the action at the end.
1543;millions of people watched it and it won 11 awards.
1544;I've loved this film, warts and all, since the first time I saw it in 1997.
1545;I kept telling myself that he must have cropped the sides.
1546;What Cameron has done is present the full frame of what was shot.
1547;this release is to be treasured, especially for those of us who love the film.
1548;It is Demo worthy in all respects.
1549;The special effects are impressive and the movie does succeed at capturing the magnitude of the catastrophy.
1550;The movie's success is certainly a testament to the combined power had by all the 15.
1551;Everyone knows the movie was great.
1552;I have always loved this movie.
1553;The box was in pristine condition!
1554;First of all the movie it self is amazing especially for its time but as far a the disk and digital copy are concerned it is very easy to use and with the digital copy all you have to do is enter the cope the give in to iTunes in the redeem area on your iPhone iPad or iTunes on the computer.
1555;And the special features are great it's amazing to see how it was made.
1556;the extras are also very informative.
1557;It is fascinating to see how they made the movie, even if you are only given a high level glimpse.
1558;i personally like the movie, the special effect and the human drama made for a powerful combination when watching it in the theater.
1559;I love the storyline and the whole flashback idea.
1560;And the effects are terrific.
1561;it's sort of funny that they built a 9/10th scale model of the titanic.
1562;i will recommend it to my friends, actually did I invite them to watch it and they love it
1563;I loved the theatrical version.
1564;And the special made for the centenary (I saw it at History).
1565;I'd like all of the movies could have such great backup stories and include them in their products.
1566;Got this today and the Cover is amazing and im watching it right now!Got it quick and glad to say they ship fast too!
1567;The Venerable James Cameron's epic tale of love in the direst of circumstances proves one essential thing: great moviemaking is not lost in American Cinema.
1568;Winslet, the prodigy stirred by Emma Thompson's consummate tutelage, is more breathtaking than the revelry of Cameron's fascination with the enormous SFX.
1569;Backed by James Horner's mystical (Irish here and so was the operatic music he composed and the delectable Celine fable) music create an emporium of tooled majesty and passionate desires while capturing the very heart of love: Innocence.
1570;My hat is tipped, much like Winslet's, to Cameron for having the austere courage to forego his salary to finish a film that will be loved or hated.
1571;The love scene, again shades of magic, was just Amore.
1572;with Horner as Maestro, a Celine performance, and an effulgent love story that would bring more Art to an Industry in desprate need of it.
1573;cameron, I think you can rest your melancholy and be at peace with this masterpiece.
1574;David Warner, a crafty character, was a leading star in a Titanic movie filmed long ago.
1575;Director Cameron paid amazing attention to detail, recreating every set to look exactly like photos of the real ship.
1576;The engine room is a masterpiece.
1577;The special effects involved in the sinking, utilizing a full scale model, are spectacular.
1578;Likewise the remarkable authentic footage taken from the real Russian research ship and minisubs.
1579;By brilliantly framing the past story in the present, Cameron shares with his audience his own wondrous experience of visiting the Titanic in her North Atlantic grave.
1580;the discs are in great condition.
1581;There sure are tons of special features in this version.
1582;I simply love it!The cover is nice as well.
1583;It's as if I was on the ship and makes the viewing experience more intense and exciting.
1584;It is a brilliant film.
1585;Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet are magic together.
1586;This is a great movie.
1587;eXCELLENT filming, acting and story.
1588;I saw Titanic three times in the theater, and enjoyed it each time.
1589;outstanding set design and effects, a wonderful musical score and and a timeless love story, are all used to retell the sinking of the Titanic.
1590;The historical points of film are surprisingly accurate and it inspired me to read up on other historical facts the movie couldn't get into.
1591;this movie holds up well and is one of my all time favorite films.
1592;Class and gender warfare, are interesting backdrops to the love story.
1593;For a story you essentially already know whats coming, this film really kept you on the edge of your seat.
1594;the extras on this collector's edition are well worth getting, with among other features, an additional 45 minutes of deleted scenes.
1595;Many of the deletions are simply the extra footage of shortened scenes that did make the movie, and frankly much of the extra scenes could have been left in the movie.
1596;The somewhat alternate ending was fun to see, but the theatrical version was clearly the right choice.
1597;That is double the next highest grossing film (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace).
1598;Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it won 11 including best picture in 1998.
1599;This was a TITANIC film in every sense of the word.
1600;As a love story was good.
1601;As a period piece, it was wonderfully precise in its myriad details, both generally and as to specifics about the Titanic and her passengers.
1602;"from a directorial perspective, this film is unparalleled
I:30;1603;building projects, deep sea filming of the original ship, thousands of hours of painstaking research, elaborate visual effects, and hundreds of special sets.
I:30;1604;To be able to pull all those elements together at all is a superhuman task.
I:30;1605;The result was truly remarkable entertainment.
I:30;1606;DiCaprio gave a career performance and his enthusiasm and charm lit up the screen.
I:30;1607;Kate Winslet was also a fresh talent with only five minor films to her credit before `Titanic'.
I:30;1608;Her performance was sparkling and her chemistry with DiCaprio made the love story urgent and magical.
I:30;1609;Forces and emotions from the original event were transported to 1997, and they clutched us with a power that left us spellbound.
I:30;1610;It was neither the best story ever told, nor the best film ever made, but it was certainly the greatest filmmaking achievement to date in its sheer size and scope.
I:30;1611;The box office speaks for itself.
I:30;1612;got this to round out the modern movie collection of love stories for our library of movies we liked when first out .
I:30;1613;looks great in blu ray
I:30;1614;i CRIED!And so did you.
I:30;1615;the underwater photography is superb and never before did I vere expect to see the real wreck on screen like that!
I:30;1616;Kate Winslett(and in a wet white dress) gave the best performance, Leo diCaprio is OK, but Kate's my preference!
I:30;1617;James Cameron has directed many of my favourite movies, i. e. T2(special edition), The Abyss(special edition) and Aliens(also the director's cut), but this one ranks as his best by far as it takes him away from the much.
I:30;1618;With the possible exception of DEEP IMPACT, this is the best film of 1998, if not of all time.
I:30;1619;An interesting discovery puts the explorers in contact with an elderly woman who was there in April 1912.
I:30;1620;Jack, who is an artist, even does a charcoal drawing of Rose.
I:30;1621;Heroically, once again Jack keeps Rose alive although he himself perishes in the cold.
I:30;1622;Back in the present Rose now keeps him alive with her memories.
I:30;1623;This epic romance is fairly good with a semi.
I:30;1624;autobiographical story, special effects, and a decent score.
I:30;1625;Titanic looks great on blue .
I:30;1626;The music is one of the things that I loved.
I:30;1627;Plus the story line pulls you along and you just can't wait to see what is going to happen in the next scene.
I:30;1628;I was sure on edge for a good share of the movie.
I:30;1629;Amazon, please send another one or credit my account.
I:30;1630;So the action, the special effects, and the costumes are great in this movie.
I:30;1631;Sweep her off her feet, and introduce her to the wonderful life of 18 hr.
I:30;1632;For a more experienced and more exposed man, he sure had some good intentions for his little princess!
I:30;1633;Definitely the new and better life that she so deserved.
I:30;1634;He sure showed her some dignity and respect.
I:30;1635;If one opens their eyes and take a really good look at it, they'll realize that this """"love story"""" is not as cute as it seems."""
1636;My ten year old is nuts about the Titanic so this was a great choice and he really enjoyed it.
1637;The colors and music are just classic to enjoy.
1638;Maybe more classics could be revised at a future date.
1639;but it was worth it
1640;which showed the intense passion and vast knowledge James Cameron has for this historical event that has proven to be unsinkable.
1641;This movie is forever a classic.
1642;I had the pleasure of seeing this at my local movie theater three times in 1997.
1643;It was definitely worth the upgrade from my old double VHS cassette version.
1644;day Shipping which was free and I got it the next day.
1645;I thought James Cameron's Titanic was superb.
1646;The film was absolutley amazing.
1647;It was able to maintain an air of suspense despite the fact that we already knew what was to come.
1648;The film combined romance, intrigue, adventure, and history.
1649;Furthermore, after seeing it I was inspired to learn more about the real Titanic and it's maiden voyage.
1650;the movie provided me with an excellent learning opportunity.
1651;I love the history of Titanic, not so much the love story, but I do love this movie.
1652;She kindly laughed and told me she hard that one before, LOL.
1653;Kate Winslet was great, Leo DiCaprio, hmmm.
1654;It really is a great film.
1655;I liked it a lot eventhough it had me in tears.
1656;I saw Titanic when it first came out years ago and thought that it was a good movie.
1657;Worth seeing for the astounding special effects and tremendous cinematography, but the story is pretty much 1890's pulp love story.
1658;One of the greatest romantic adventures of the 1990s, involving passionate romance, intrigue, adventure and danger.
1659;this movie both resurrects the Titanic ocean liner and it's fate, and creates a an intricate romance against it's backdrop.
1660;gripping throughout with a phenomenal ending.
1661;The captivating Kate Winslet is perfect for the part of the spirited young Rose, and De Caprio provides an energetic and irrepressible hero in Jack Dawson.
1662;Memorable and heart wrenching is the scene of an Irish mother putting her young children to sleep with a bedtime story just before the ship sinks with them.
1663;appearance also by Kathy Bates as the real life heroine of the Titanic Molly Brown.
1664;this has captivated millions of viewers with good reason.
1665;And said they went to the movies to see it twice.
1666;This might be an old movie but it is a true story!
1667;I would definitely recommend it anyone who is on the fence and likes the movie.
1668;and about the movie, so many people quibble about the length of the movie, yet for all its worth, it could have been so much longer, and still have been fantastic.
1669;The 3+ hours running time is an excellent medium, and is ultimately necessary for the viewer to be engaged to the modern world, the Titanic's story (told by the now ancient Rose), the tragedy that followed, and the powerful impact that the voyage had on the life of young Rose and others.
1670;The ship looks and feels real.
1671;The people on ship feel real.
1672;"Rarely can a film do this
I:30;1673;They provide and excellent conduit to see the world that this ship encompassed, everything from the style of the era, the type and diversity of the people aboard, the grandeur and significance of the ship, the layers of the ship itself and so on.
I:30;1674;Furthermore, we become so captivated in their story (now that I'm older, I can appreciate and understand to the nth degree) that by the tragic end, their relationship is beautiful yet so very bittersweet.
I:30;1675;Also, the premise that true love can change the lives of others feels so real, making the ending (and the entire movie) simply superb, powerful, moving, and astonishingly beautiful.
I:30;1676;and an often overlooked aspect, which really drew me back into Cameron's epic, is the absolutely gripping and appropriate all.
I:30;1677;time highest selling score by James Horner.
I:30;1678;The soundtrack fits all the themes of the movies, and is so powerful because of this"
1679;Coupled with the acting, it is such a powerful mechanism.
1680;One of the best, in my opinion.
1681;after all of this, I realize that this is such a timeless and classic movie.
1682;To reject it is to be devoid of one of the best movies in decades, and simply one of the most powerful ever made.
1683;Great cast, riveting story, and based on history.
1684;It's most certainly not the best movie of all time, as most people say it is.
1685;This WAS entertaining, but nothing original, and certainly not a classic.
1686;I wouldn't even call it ONE of the best movies of all time.
1687;Great cast, great story, great special effects.
1688;Certainly has your imagination reeling and your cheering for the love.
1689;I enjoyed this movie very much.
1690;And I think it have fantastic cinematography and special effect.
1691;thus I was hoping that this movie will be of a special visual feature on the actual event.
1692;The design, the cast, crew, sets.
1693;The dissapointing part of the movie is that it basically concentrated on the 2 young lovers.
1694;i was hoping to see ,more of the roles of JJ Astor, Molly Brown, Guggenheim and all those important famous figures.
1695;The actual character of Molly Brown is a very fascinating character, and I was hoping Kathy Bates ( I love her ) would make a fantastic recreation of that remarkable woman.
1696;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
1697;The special effects are excellent and you almost feel like you're right on the ship itself!
1698;The love story added in was pretty good, but that's not the reason I liked the movie so much.
1699;I saw that in Great America and thought it was very cool.
1700;Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are at their best in this movie!
1701;Titanic is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
1702;it is an awesome movie and a long one!
1703;The acting was good with Leonardo and Winslet.
1704;They played their parts really good.
1705;The movie was very good.
1706;The special effects and atmosphere were great.
1707;The detail and depth was just amazing.
1708;The subtle sound design and overall spectacle was wonderful.
1709;I loved it and recommend it to everyone.
1710;It's one of my Favorites!
1711;Many moments of this movie make you laugh, or bring tears to your eyes.
1712;The action and intense suspense had you on the edge of your seat as you watch the ship crumble to pieces with panic and tragic events of the passengers aboard.
1713;The characters were all unique in their specific roles and the emotional roller.
1714;Recommended for all those who love historic events that replay a certain mark in life, combined with action, suspense and romance.
1715;This is the type of movie I would watch again.
1716;Incredible Movie, Excellent acting and music!
1717;The sound is also very good.
1718;I find though a lot of DTS blu ray movies have the dialogue very low, and the sound effects very high.
1719;This movie showed an amazing amount of depth and clarity which is appropriate for this type of movie.
1720;Cameron's Avatar, Aliens, anf Terminator 2 plus Titanic makes him a great director, creator and technician.
1721;Great cast, great story and ultimately moving.
1722;This will pass down as one of the classics.
1723;Always been a Titanic buff and the addition of the love story certainly enhances it all.
1724;The production is magnificent and the numerous add.
1725;ons in this anniversary edition are also well done.
1726;I recommend it for the whole family.
1727;This was more of a special effects showcase than an epic love story.
1728;I love the idea of this flick.
1729;This is one of my favorite movies of all time .
1730;Leo and Kate are amazing!
1731;Read some of the following reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about : .
1732;are some of the lines you will read.
1733;It touched and made many of them cry .
1734;I can honestly say this is the least favorite movie I have ever seen.
1735;James Cameron had all the right opportunities to make this a poignant film, but he took the cheaters way out.
1736;what got me the most was that this film actually beat out genuine talent to win 11 oscars.
1737;It was deserving of maybe three or four technical awards, to include a noteworthy best score.
1738;I agree the special effects, sets, costumes and soundtrack are impressive, but after those, what is left?
1739;one of the few movies when you watch it again that is as good as the first time.
1740;well because it was such a huge success at the box office.
1741;and because it's a very good film.
1742;But the young women and girls loved Leo so.
1743;i bught it because it's on the second AFI top 100 films of all.
1744;I see that many viewers have given this movie 1 or 2 stars.
1745;DiCaprio and Winslet have good on screen chemistry and the supporting cast is also strong.
1746;This film is not deep in its themes and revelations, but it provides good entertainment value.
1747;A great, now classic movie.
1748;Glad I bought this also.
1749;Extras pack the disc and the Digital Copy is always appreciated.
1750;Saves a lot of time!
1751;A resonable price for what was received.
1752;Of course, the movie is great.
1753;This is a must see.
1754;As I am sure everyone has seen it.
1755;But that doesn't make it a great movie, and here's why.
1756;Rose is introduced as a dignified upper class lady, but is soon spouting off profanities and makes obscene .
1757;the second half of the movie is much better, picturing the actual sinking of the Titanic, and Jack and Rose's mad struggle for survival.
1758;Hollywood has outdone itself in recreating the sinking, with epic scenes of struggle and survival.
1759;I liked the part when Rose went down to save Jack because the water is so high and she's rushing to get there before the water gets to the top!!!!!!!!!!
1760;This is the best dramatic movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1761;I love the music, sets, and costumes, but I could probably write a more human story with less droll.
1762;The accuracy and detail was great, but the characters and the story could happen on any ship any writer can create without an iceberg.
1763;Although the doomed R. m. s. Titanic sunk, a compelling romance and undeniable chemistry between the two main stars of this film manages to keep Titanic, THE MOVIE, afloat!
1764;There are so many words to describe this movie: awe.
1765;inspiring, powerful, haunting, suspenseful,and riveting, just to name a few!
1766;This movie is defenitely one that stays with you.
1767;Titanic makes history come to life, right before our eyes!
1768;"Titanic is a movie of titanic proportions
I:30;1769;TITANIC, that preposterously beautiful film made in 1997 with a very young Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, James Cameron's Magnum Opus, continues to impress, especially when viewed yet again on New Year's Day 2012 .
I:30;1770;a fifteen year old film that remains one of the most impressive cinematic achievements from Hollywood.
I:30;1771;One of the many reasons it remains resonant is the manner in which the film addresses class systems .
I:30;1772;the wealthy versus the poor is a hot topic today and the film shows us why .
I:30;1773;and the extraordinary cinematic recreation of the sinking of that mighty ship.
I:30;1774;Gloria Stewart is radiant as the old Rose and her rapt audience includes Bill Paxton, Suzy Amis, Lewis Abernathy, Nicholas Cascone, and Anatoly M. Sagalevitch.
I:30;1775;They are stories with meaning, value and intent.
I:30;1776;The special features on this are a testament to that statement with specials like the hour and a half long documentary, the final word.
I:30;1777;There is also a great chunk of 57 minutes worth of deleted scenes and plenty of other features.
I:30;1778;ray and is well worth the affordable price.
I:30;1779;Plus, it's got female nudity so that's a plus.
I:30;1780;A classic as good as Gone With the Wind.
I:30;1781;Fast shipping and I mean FAST!
I:30;1782;New product as described in sealed package!
I:30;1783;TITANIC is a 3 1/2 hour time capsule that will forever stir imagination and tug at the hearts of those who, if only for a brief moment in time, try to imagine what the experience was REALLY like.
I:30;1784;Leo and Kate are great together andJames did a great job as usual.
I:30;1785;This collector's edition hasnice picture and sound plus neat extras.
I:30;1786;yes i love this product.
I:30;1787;This movie is a great film with lots of well.
I:30;1788;For this movie be sure to view a widescreen edition, it is well worth it.
I:30;1789;This is a movie that most likely you will enjoy seeing again and again.
I:30;1790;It gets better with age.
I:30;1791;this movie offers so much to the viewer that it is truly amazing.
I:30;1792;I will mention some of the high points:1.
I:30;1793;The magnificence of the ship is well displayed.
I:30;1794;The love story is very well done and is believable.
I:30;1795;The charming and sweet love story is a story in itself.
I:30;1796;The movie is really two movies in one .
I:30;1797;the story of the Titanic and the love story of Rose and Jack.
I:30;1798;when it came out on VHS some time later, I bought it right away, mumble> maybe even the first day it was released /mumble>.
I:30;1799;I watched it several times after that and, I assume, enjoyed it.
I:30;1800;This may be attributed to 1) Billy Zane's personal heat quotient or possibly 2) the movie's visual lushness which is, admittedly, amazing or even perhaps to 3) the Titanic's enduring mystique.
I:30;1801;James Cameron's endowment of Rose with his own late 20th century goals of feminist self.
I:30;1802;When Rose whines about having to marry to make her life and her mother's life easier, you can't help but think of all the people in steerage who are headed for the coal mines or the sweatshops and happy about it just to give their children more opportunities in life.
I:30;1803;And since from the moment of their meeting he's been devoted to helping Rose realize her true self.
I:30;1804;The boat was full of millionaires, diplomats, presidential advisors, military men, and just plain brave emigrants on their way to a new life.
I:30;1805;that's fascinating in a macabre fashion.
I:30;1806;This is one of the best movies of all time.
I:30;1807;I don't enjoy watching movies over and over again but this one I could and do watch it at least once or twice a year.
I:30;1808;The acting is super, the special effects are remarkable and the story line is exciting, romantic and full of suspense.
I:30;1809;This is the most amazing movie on account of it being something that gets to you every time.
I:30;1810;No matter how many times I watch it I always feel my heart going out to the characters.
I:30;1811;I always smile and I always sob.
I:30;1812;Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do a brilliant job and I don't believe anyone else could have done it better.
I:30;1813;Overall it's an amazing movie.
I:30;1814;I recommend it to anyone who has the imagination to understand it.
I:30;1815;nor was it good plot or accurate historical portrayal.
I:30;1816;In the end, this movie succeeded for two major reasons: great computer graphics, and hype.
I:30;1817;All I am saying is that it is definitely NOT one of the best movies of all time.
I:30;1818;It was an alright movie, that deserved some credit.
I:30;1819;I mean, a lot of effort was put into it, and it did have its moments.
I:30;1820;i believe that when James Cameron set out to make this movie he wanted to create a film of epic proportions.
I:30;1821;It became an epic because of the wonderfully contrived plot, together with the infamous Titanic story and some famous actors.
I:30;1822;yet we accept it as great.
I:30;1823;This appears to be one of the best historical examples of people jumping on the bandwagon .
I:30;1824;Yet, this film is remarkable in so many ways.
I:30;1825;Yet, it is the biggest box office hit of all time.
I:30;1826;The look of the film is sumptuous, with great production design, gorgeous cinematography, and excellent acting (for the most part).
I:30;1827;As much as I like DiCaprio, I think he's a bit uncomfortable playing a role like this, but he is still believable.
I:30;1828;One of the best things about the film is how Cameron contrasts the upper deck snobs with the lower deck """"lower classes"""", and how the lower classes are much more human and real than the snotty upper classes are."""
1829;There are moments of pure poetry and sadness, especially with the musicians playing on board as the boat goes down.
1830;in conclusion, this is a pretty good film that should be seen.
1831;James Cameron made a film that defied all expectations, and won a bunch of Oscars for it.
1832;This movie looks so great, if you have a decent sound system and big screen T. v it will feel like if you were there the night the Titanic sank.
1833;Hope you enjoy it like i did :)
1834;Titanic is truly a historical masterpiece.
1835;done and emotional film I have ever seen.
1836;Every aspect of this movie is truly amazing: the sets, the costumes, the special effects, the historical accuracy, but most of all, the acting!
1837;Kate Winlset was stupendous as Rose and deserved the Oscar for best actress, and Leonardo DiCaprio did a superb job as Jack Dawson.
1838;The rest of the cast was also outstanding in more ways than one.
1839;Many people bash the movie by saying that it is a chick.
1840;I would recommend this thrilling epic to everybody!
1841;It appeals to people of all ages and types.
1842;As a high grade romance novel the movie really works coupled with terrific sets and special effects that still hold up in 2005.
1843;Video works and does just fine.
1844;Wife wanted it and is happy, so that means I'm happy.
1845;This movie is a staple for filmmaking and storytelling.
1846;It's the best movie in the history of the world, maybe it's because it has a bit of every thing, romance, tragedy, greed, a few laughs, ect.
1847;I'm really glad I bought it.
1848;I recommend it to every one who loves to see a great movie and Titanic freaks, like me.
1849;james Cameron is such a talented writer and director, Titanic is definitely one of his finest films.
1850;In my opinion, the strongest character is the older Rose played by Gloria Stuart, she is such a wonderful actress, and even though only being seen in a few scenes, she is amazing.
1851;others are Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, she doesn't exactly look like the actual Molly Brown but she fits the personality well in this movie and i really couldn't picture anyone else in that role.
1852;Frances Fisher as Ruth DeWitt Bukater is another fine actress in this movie, and is also a fictional character.
1853;Bernard Hill is wonderful as the captain and is a great actor.
1854;Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews is great.
1855;the movie tries to mix history with fiction, with sinking of Titanic and a love story with Rose and Jack, which works rather well, because they are able to introduce us to the real names on that ship.
1856;visual Effects are amazing in this film, especially shots of the ship.
1857;I'm still amazed that they built that ship, that is truly amazing.
1858;the music in this movie, is probably the best music i've ever heard in the history of the movie business, the scores in this movie are wonderful.
1859;the ship sinking is amazingly done.
1860;Very emotional to watch, because we have to remember, this actually happened.
1861;the ending to this movie, is also great.
1862;Gloria Stuart in the last few scenes is great, even though she does play a fictional character, in the end you feel like she was a real character, which made the ending so good.
1863;The very last scene when she dies (i guess she dies or it's a dream, not sure) and she goes back to Titanic, and we see the wreck evolve into its original form is an amazing shot and seeing all the characters in that one shot was very well done.
1864;Seeing the making of this film is amazing.
1865;it leaves about 1/4 of the screen, to the right and to the left of picture black along with above and below.
1866;This movie has been a favorite of mine since I first saw it nearly 17 years ago.
1867;James Cameron's Titanic is timeless!
1868;This is one of my favorite Movies.
1869;The rest of Hollywood would be wise to heed his advice.
1870;Leonardo DiCaprio, fresh off his role as Romeo in Baz Luhrman's f***ing piece of sh.
1871;edited [though uncredited] and directed by Sir Laurence Olivier, considered the finest Shakepearean actor of his time, first), was a little better as Rose.
1872;"Billy Zane, fresh from playing the title role in ""The Phantom"", was very good as the ""villainous"" Caledon Hockley, Rose's fiance."
1873;"The haunting love theme by Celine Dion, written in memory of her niece, ""My Heart Will Go On"" is very good and earned the Oscar for Best Song."
1874;The only Academy Awards I'd have given this film are: Best Song, Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects and Best Supporting Actor (Billy Zane).
1875;Awesome movie that never been better than that , 1997 was a land mark for the world when they came up with this great job
1876;Best movie I have ever seen.
1877;Definitely a movie everyone can learn to love.
1878;I always wanted to watch this and now i finally have.
1879;How wonderful to be hearing a story from a women who got to live the life given to her by someone she hardly knew.
1880;office of over Rp 1.8 billions worldwide, this is the highest grossing movie to date.
1881;So does great movies like Mission: Impossible and Top Gun.
1882;I hope the studio is listening.
1883;Ok the movie is so great.
1884;This movie won 11 Oscars.
1885;again, Kate Winslet is one of my favorite actresses because not only is she amazingly talented, she holds up a standard of a real woman's appearance, not a anorexic twig.
1886;Her emotional highs and lows throughout are amazing.
1887;I particularly love the scene where he has an opportunity to help Jack and ruthlessly chooses not to, but the magnitude of that decision still brings tears to his eyes.
1888;and of course, Jack Dawson played by Leonardo DiCaprio captured the attention of all females age 13 and up for several years while he wisely went into his shell until his work could again be judged without hormones getting in the way.
1889;His character of Jack is instantly likable, charismatic, moving, and if you don't feel anything for his humanity by the end of the movie and want to save him, your high level of testosterone is probably impeding your judgment.
1890;It has been 13 years since this movie came out so it's much easier to look at it with a clear frame of mind unclouded by gooey.
1891;All have a measure of dignity and grace (except Ismay of course) as they deal with the emergency on board and I really feel like they bring those historic people to life in a way that garners empathy from the audience.
1892;the amazing images of the boat, the scale, the effects all take you completely into the movie, the grandeur and the danger.
1893;The music is beautiful although I could do without Celine Dion's song these days.
1894;If you haven't seen this movie, you live under a rock but it really is an amazing story based on historic events.
1895;It is a blockbuster, one of the biggest movies of that decade, one of the biggest movies ever really and it propelled all careers of those involved to new heights.
1896;If you're a history buff at all and interested in hearing more about the boat, it is definitely worth a listen.
1897;In this edition, the sound has been upgraded, the colors are richer, and the picture was anamophically enhanced for widescreen televisions.
1898;The construction timplapse is particularly spectacular.
1899;"par
I:30;1900;Short and sweet: this is the best film ever made!
I:30;1901;version is pretty awesome and the bonus.
I:30;1902;happy my wife lovet too
I:30;1903;James cameron's Titanic is everything you would want in a movie, and is the most successful movie ever, but it could have easily been the best film ever, save one downer.
I:30;1904;The woman, of course, is Rose, a survivor of the legendary shipwreck.
I:30;1905;Then Rose proceeds to tell them of how the picture was drawn, and we are transported to the 1912 world of the greatest epic ever.
I:30;1906;Now, if the movie had opened where the flashback had opened, this would easily be the greatest film ever.
I:30;1907;viewing """"Titanic"""" to learn about the ship is alot like viewing """"Gone With The Wind"""" to learn about the Civil War."""
1908;In both cases the titles are vital settings that are done extraordinarily well, but the films are both about the same something else.
1909;The life changing event that caused epiphanies in the female leads are what Titanic, and Gone With The Wind are all about.
1910;There are powerful, even grisly scenes, and the depiction of the sinking is grand and accurate, but the story is more about the romance between Rose and Jack, than anything else.
1911;The Blu Ray is our best choice and it's really worth it to own it.
1912;everyone that was involved in the making of this movie did a phenomenal Job.
1913;I recommend checking out IMDB for trivia, goofs and quotes.
1914;Have your popcorn ready and don't get up it is long but it tells a good story.
1915;"As a fiction however
I:30;1916;The authency of the Titanic and production values are first rate.
I:30;1917;I like that I have both in one package blu.
I:30;1918;Its a classic and holds up very well.
I:30;1919;This movie is fairly descent but is definitely not worth best picture or the other millions of awards that it won.
I:30;1920;If you look at the top grossing movies of all time and see stuff like this and home alone, well.
I:30;1921;Everyone loves this movie so much and thanks to girls who went to see it 10 times at the movie theathers, there you have it, over 1 billion dollars.
I:30;1922;On top of it, it's totally holywood and all the girls are like: """"Leonardo Decaprio's so hot!"""""""
1923;It's pathetic that a movie like this won best picture.
1924;Watch As Good As It Gets and L. a Confidential!
1925;"The main merits of this well known tragic story resides on the fact James Cameron supported himself around four fundamental pillars
I:30;1926;Of course the last ace of this brilliant filmmaker was to surprise us with the last words of a real survivor of that fatidic tragedy.
I:30;1927;An immortal classic for the next generations of viewers to come.
I:30;1928;Beyond all that, the characters are among the most one.
I:30;1929;dimensional ever put on film.
I:30;1930;read Walter Lord's wonderful book again.
I:30;1931;Add in some """"ground breaking"""" special effects, and you have yourself an Oscar."""
1932;I thought I'd add my two pennies worth (such as it is) to the entire broiling pot!!!
1933;I do like it though, and I think it is best watched in the cinema.
1934;"I (macho male that I am) shed a tear at the final moments
I:30;1935;The riveting demise of the """"unsinkable"""" Titanic is depicted in the 1997 feature film."""
1936;"A chronicle of human courage, deceit, and technical catastrophe that invites movie goers to journey back in time and witness a tale of romance, opulence, and the stark division between the poor and power of the wealthy.Yearning for the chance to travel, artist, Jack Dawson, bets everything he owns in a game of poker to win tickets to board the ""unsinkable"" Titanic."
1937;She is lead to the luxurious 1st class, as Jack settles in his bunk in 3rd class.
1938;although born into wealth, Rose's family was enduring economic struggles, and to redeem the family wealth and name, her mother decided on arranged marriage.
1939;She had no other way out.
1940;Jack, memorized by her beauty, ran to her rescue.
1941;Jack uses all of his strength to pull her back over the railing.
1942;On the Titanic, there was a great difference between the 1st class and the 3rd class, the 1st class had luxurious rooms and were highly thought of.
1943;in the aftermath of dinner, Jack invites Rose to what he calls `a real party'.
1944;Jack and Rose dance to their hearts content in the 3rd class party.
1945;Aware of his artistic talent, Rose ask Jack to draw her wearing nothing, but the Hope Diamond.
1946;Jack and Rose explore the ship, and make their way to the deck.
1947;James Cameron does a very good job of reenacting the ship's impact with the iceberg and sinking.
1948;The events leading up to the final moments of Titanic, show Rose, Jack, and Cal's true colors.
1949;The love that Rose and Jack feel for one another and how they would risk their own lives to save each other.
1950;throughout the entire movie it was evident that love conquers all.
1951;It makes you imagine of that happening to you.
1952;That is what makes Titanic one of the most well known, and successful movies.
1953;It makes you come back for more.
1954;Beautiful color and great sound.
1955;I'm just in awe on how great it is.
1956;This bundle is well worth any Titanic fan.
1957;This is better than them ALL in my opinion.
1958;Well put together and the box design is perfect.
1959;This is my favorite version of the titanic.
1960;Ever since was in forth grade I have loved this movie and still today I love it!
1961;one of the best movies ever made no doubt.
1962;titanic, is a piece of history brought to life on the big screen, and adding a sweet romance to it became a sensation all across the globe.
1963;one minute you're safe and warm, and the next you're fighting for your life.
1964;the fact that it's hugely based on real events makes it that much more painful.
1965;in this movie they bring all that and add a little touch of romance.
1966;beautiful couple, excellent chemistry, and a very believable romance.
1967;it's that love at first sight that surpasses class, fedelity, and wealth.
1968;(sigh)now that's great movie making.
1969;billy zane was a great villian.
1970;the way the story is told was a great idea, the old rose retelling the best days of her life, wich she shared with the love of her life.
1971;then she goes in peace to reunite with her jack.
1972;This is my favorite movie EVER!
1973;The picture is great too.
1974;"I recommend this movie to anyone, especially ones who like ""epic love stories"""
1975;"this ""Titanic"" movie is really cool, I like almost everything about it."
1976;For a new generation, this will be the first time they see it on the BIG screen, and they will be in awe.
1977;Some scenes more impressive than others in the new format, but overall, the film was as effective, if not more so, than the 1997 showing.
1978;On my projected screen size, about 10 feet wide, this movie is just amazing.
1979;This was also a gift and have heard no complaints from the receipient.
1980;This is a must for any fan of Titanic.
1981;I got it for a friend, but will get another one for me to keep it unopened.
1982;I have a feeling that this set will become a high price collector piece later in years.
1983;The plot is very well written, the story is unforgettable, the characters from good to evil are purchasable, the acting is good, the ending is brilliant.
1984;This movie deserved every award that it received.
1985;born director completed the project with flying colors and the money started to roll in, he was laughing all the way to the bank.
1986;Cameron was able to swim to the surface, and is still valiantly kicking up a storm.
1987;Only a film like Schindler's List could pack such a wallop, but Titanic is able to match such an emotional intensity.
1988;lost Heart of the Ocean and the older Rose telling her tale, are unnecessarily added to the epic.
1989;Rose Calvert (Gloria Stuart) adds structure and experience to the story, where her survival is proof of one's heart continuing to go on.
1990;roger Ebert, in his review on the film, made an interesting point that it is perfectly fine to 'Hollywoodize' this story because the Titanic itself was also advertised during its time with glamour and hype.
1991;I guarantee that if we watch films, even Titanic, with an open mind and an open heart, we will receive a much more wholesome experience.
1992;titanic is entertainment on a grand visual and emotional scale, a film which we have not seen the likes of in almost thirty years.
1993;The name itself means disastor, romance, heroism and tragety all in one.
1994;The special effects for this film are breathtaking.
1995;Almost everything about it is historically accurate, with 3 minor exceptions(Mr. Andrews did not notice the shaking in his cabin, there was no suction when the ship went down, and Mr Ismay was crushed by a funnel) Everything else is perfect in every way.
1996;The sinking sequences are the best part and are worth watching, in fact, in my opinion, the final 10 minutes of the sinking sequence are the best shots ever to be made in a movie.
1997;When Jack and Rose are running around inside the ship, outrunning water your heart will jump.
1998;The acting is superb and is well done.
1999;The soundtrack is outstanding and perfectly captures the mood of the story and feeling.
2000;I think it is the second best soundtrack ever made (Next to Independence Day) Overall this is a fantastic movie that should not be missed.
2001;The packaging is one of the best ive ever seen.
2002;James Cameron is a fine action and sci.
2003;Keep in mind, I love T2.
2004;I've seen it more than any other movie, and it still continues to entertain (it's actually one of my favorites).
2005;9/11, Hurricane Katrina, or better yet, The Crucifixion (yeah, I bet Jesus had a few ladies on the side.
2006;"Because they're basicially saying, ""Ok, lets focus on these two characters, and ignore the rest!"
2007;No wonder it won so many Oscars.
2008;That was a great horror movie, and his character was pretty funny).
2009;There are absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
2010;No compelling storytelling, no brilliant acting, and no interesting dialogue.
2011;Yeah, the boat looked good, but they had $200 million to work with, so you knew it would.
2012;But being a hopeless romantic, I definitely loved it.
2013;Granted, the special effects / sets / costumes were amazing.
2014;I first saw it at Silver City Metropolis, and the movie really played up to the super.
2015;It's worth viewing once (preferably on a big screen).
2016;They detract from the real event, the sinking of the ship and circumstances that led to its happening.
2017;The one good feature of the movie is the actual sequence of frames of the sinking of the ship, which are well done.
2018;one of the best movies of the 1990's and it is timeless.
2019;Titanic wasn't the first attempt at turning the sinking of the big boat into a theatrical epic, but it's by far the best and will never, ever be bettered.
2020;the hugeness of the production is every bit as impressive at the ship, and the savage critics predicted that the film was doomed to fail as hard as its subject matter.
2021;Caledon Hockley IS actually a complex, and somewhat sympathetic character.
2022;I know he's the antagonist (or maybe the iceberg is), but the fact that he still searches for Rose on the deck of the Carpathia means that he really does love her, in a way.
2023;once the iceberg hits, at the 100.
2024;time, but close) is perfect.
2025;Titanic isn't, but his commitment to realism keeps it consistent to his other movies.
2026;In general, I think that Titanic is a really great movie.
2027;The plot is entertaining, though unrealistic at times.
2028;But honestly, other than history buffs, who would want a movie based on history alone?
2029;Watch the Discovery channel, and don't go looking for anything other than entertainment when watching a movie.
2030;A cute actor and catchy song hardly make a picture Oscar.
2031;Critics and older people alike adored the movie, as so proved at the Oscars.
2032;And Leonardo DiCaprio had little to do with it.
2033;It was a great movie, and still is.
2034;Often, it is simple and not very exciting.
2035;Even though the dialogue is a bit slow sometimes, i still enjoyed Titanic, and will continue to enjoy it.
2036;As I said, Titanic is an excellent movie.
2037;Best in a theatre, but probably very good at home also.
2038;I loved the original version of this movie.
2039;disc edition released in the USA is great.
2040;Pure and simple, the best film I have ever seen.
2041;It was very well made.
2042;Excellent Cast and a legendarydirector.
2043;i think James Cameron did the best work I have seen him do.
2044;Whatz up with that?But anyways I would really recommend this movie.
2045;Watch the movie and you'll extremely LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2046;For Women: You get Leonardo DiCaprio and a love story.
2047;For Young People: You get to see two youngsters as the leads.
2048;er (Clint) even said religous people were hypocrites to love this movie because the love story with Winslet and DiCaprio has them having premarital sex.
2049;The meld of Actors and CGI is very well done.
2050;I bought it on sale for my son.
2051;But who dosent love the Titanic movie.
2052;The 4 disk set has the trailers, the heart of the ocean documentary, and 3 parodies not in the 3 disk set.
2053;There are some nice special effects shots dropped from the movie.
2054;It was so realistic and convincing you thought it must have been made in an actual ship at sea.
2055;This is one of the best movies of all time.
2056;It has a beautiful romance set within a heartwrenching moment in history.
2057;The story is deep, and will linger with you (along with the theme song) for a long time.
2058;This is a really great love story.
2059;and i watch it alot.
2060;titanic is one of my favorite movies of all time.
2061;also the bonus disc is really awesome.
2062;The strength of Titanic is that we come to genuinely care for Kate and Leonardo during the first half of the movie, so that when the second.
2063;The dramatic arc of the film is superb.
2064;"expensive) art direction feels like a movie set, it sufficiently satisfies as the setting for this large drama without screaming ""look at me"" too often."
2065;It is the manner in which Winslet listens and responds to DiCapprio that really makes the romance believable.
2066;bloodedness she encounters brings life to the class warfare on the board the ship.
2067;But, there is nothing extraordinary about it in the least.
2068;titanic is a fun, heart.
2069;warming ride which most audiences will enjoy, but don't expect anything deep, profound, or intelligent.
2070;Truthfully, the broader these characters are drawn the easier it is to relate to them, to slip into their shoes and experience the real story.
2071;How many people can't relate to the story: Men know what it's like to long for the unatainable woman, women know the desire to leave a stiffleing relationship, and everyone knows the rush of new love (I'll go out on a limb and theorize that the latter, more so then just Leonardo DiCaprio is what attracted such a strong young female audience).
2072;Just considering how well his screenplay keeps the viewer involved is an impressive accomplishment.
2073;Just a look at the number of positive reviews submitted from other countries gives an idea of how universal this story is.
2074;Titanic is a monumental achievement.
2075;There's also more special features, and, not to mention, the academy.
2076;winning masterpiece in a new better.
2077;the movie is still a great story beautifully portrayed despite the tragic ending of this mighty ship.

2080;The best dissaster film ever to be put on screen.
2081;While you watch it espesially when the ship is sinking you are left without words to explain how great this film is.
2082;The acting is good but at times you watch it thinking it could be better acting.
2083;The special effects are just excellent.
2084;Overall a great film one of the greatest films ever and it will not go away and we will always remeber it.
2085;The script and storyline are solid, Winslet brings a memorable, saucy verve to her character while DiCaprio's relaxed romanticism set millions of hearts aflutter worldwide.
2086;The score is moving and inspired, and the special effects are second.
2087;If you haven't seen Titanic, this is simply a fantastic movie.
2088;This is a great movie that will stand the test of time.
2089;It is true the movie is not the best ever but it is a great movie.
2090;I highly reccomend this movie.
2091;Great movie, had to take a snack break in the middle though.
2092;This the best movie I have ever seen.
2093;This movie has beautiful love story, with a great chemistry between Kate and Leo.

2099;This special edition is morethan just the hour or so of unseen footage we're including.
2100;The wealth of material that the collector's editionwill have available is truly representative of the scope and depth of thismovie phenomenon and we believe it will drive audiences everywhere toreturn to TITANIC.
2101;Honored at the 70th ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS in March 1998 with 11OSCARS, including Best Picture and Best Director, the ever popularTITANIC remains the top grossing film at the worldwide box office.
2102;starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, TITANIC struck anemotional chord with audiences worldwide who were drawn to the epicromance as well as its exquisite craftsmanship and grand scope.
2103;tITANIC was also the best.
2104;a nice addition to the already enjoyable movie.
2105;I'd definitely recommend adding this to your collection!
2106;now shes 11 and wow.
2107;I came to gamepimps and bought it for all together 25 bucks.
2108;Outstanding work from this shop!
2109;Michael and I saw this blockbuster.
2110;The Titanic hit an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage in 1912.
2111;I'm the king of the world!
2112;Titanic won 11 Academy Awards.
2113;It is the biggest box office success of all.
2114;Is Titanic the best movie ever?
2115;if you want to see a story about the titanic, do yourself a favor and see the musical.
2116;Sure, the beginning is very slow and boring, but the rest of the movie is pure genius and entertainment.
2117;Now I think he's amazing!!
2118;Gloria Stuart is also very well cast in her role as Rose Dawson Calvert.
2119;a beautiful score makes this movie even better.
2120;"winning song ""My Heart Will Go On,"" (sung by Celine Dion) can move some to tears."
2121;the ending is so moving and sad, I can't say in words how sad I felt.
2122;I have to say once more how brilliant DiCaprio and Winslet are in this film.
2123;I'll stalk you at night!
2124;I've seen Titanic (1953) and A Night to Remember and this is definitely the best one.
2125;I would recommend this movie to everyone in the world.
2126;She was so proud to show everyone that she had a copy that was all hers.
2127;In their few days together Jack teaches Rose how to be herself and try to have fun.
2128;Basically the two main characters sneak around various parts of the ship enjoying various moments of sexual pleasure.
2129;I ordered this for my dad and he loved it.
2130;He really enjoyed it and wants more!
2131;Thanks for the use of the hall.
2132;Four stars is perfectly fine (and still not a perfect movie).
2133;A 9 is the highest possible score any one movie can possibly achieve.
2134;And if you don't like this excellent production, then by gosh, go out and see THE MATRIX!
2135;Like what you like, and forget it!
2136;The debate is going to go on the same way as the lyrics of Celine Dion's music track.
2137;Well this is obviously the best movie of all time.
2138;Billy Zane was a very convincing actor.
2139;i also enjoyed the music it was excellent.
2140;I recommend this movie to anyone that liked Pearl Harbor.
2141;One of the things I look for in a movie is originality (YES, EVEN IN A TRUE STORY).
2142;James Cameron knew this, and put in a love story on top of the historic event, which was the movie's downfall.
2143;Star Wars has a love story.
2144;"It's the type of love story that brought it down
I:30;2145;The dialogue and plot movement are incredibly shakey.
I:30;2146;So many people have often refered to this picture as the new GONE WITH THE WIND.
I:30;2147;as Molly Brown she was so wooden and saught of retained from giving a convincing performance.
I:30;2148;As Jack he was always trying to get a good close up on the camra of himself and i think his best performance when he really got into the part and looked and acted just as if he was Jack was when.
I:30;2149;he was frozen solid in the Atlantic.
I:30;2150;He makes a comical noise, and it is funny to watch him spin into the water.
I:30;2151;I thought Judi Dench and Kathy Bates were brilliant.
I:30;2152;The first movie is much better.
I:30;2153;i think it speaks volumes when you see the impressive shot of all those frozen bodies in the Atlantic and not shed a tear.
I:30;2154;I just thought, """"Cool VFX."""""""
2155;I know that this is a popular flick, but I just did not get it.
2156;Unless, of course, you want a good laugh.
2157;d conversions, but I did see this in IMAX earlier in the year and it still packs a wallop.
2158;Cameron has one of the best eyes for composition and the way he integrates the visual effects into his films is still one of the best in the business.
2159;DeCaprio does the best he can with some of the clunkiest dialogue he has ever been given, and he makes Jack a fun character that you really root for, so that when fate steps in, you feel for him.
2160;Still a great movie after 15 years.
2161;She was learning about this in school and wanted the movie.
2162;In Somewhere In Time, the love between Christopher Reeves and Jane Seymour (What a beautiful women in this movie!!!!!)
2163;is credible and the story focus on their love.
2164;When you see the film, you can see why.
2165;It has all the makings of a major blockbuster: passion, romance, action, suspense, and big budget special effects.
2166;Instead, the movie contains some of the best scenes ever on film.
2167;the acting in the film is above average.
2168;Kate Winslet is excellent as Rose.
2169;She is 100% believable as the rich girl who finally finds true love.
2170;She is able to draw inner emotion that in the hands of any other actress, would go unnoticed.
2171;Billy Zane as Rose's fiancee Cal also gives a great performance.
2172;He is able to convey evil at times in the film, but deep inside, you feel that he actually does love Rose, he just doesn't know how to show it.
2173;the direction of the film is excellent.
2174;Parts of the screenplay leave a little something to be desired, but overall the screenplay is good.
2175;The best shot scenes in the film of course involve the Titanic.
2176;The music used in the film is extraordinary.
2177;It sets the tone for scenes of romance, passion and for scenes of danger.
2178;At times the score can be quite haunting.
2179;I think this is a film men and women can both like.
2180;The women can drool over Dicaprio, and they get a love story.
2181;Titanic is a great film.
2182;And I doubly avoided seeing it when it won all those academy awards.
2183;about a year later I rewatched Titanic for the first time since that original experience and it got me again.
2184;And the music is literally out of this world.
2185;But even the love story, if you let your guard down, can work.
2186;It is a great way to show of your new dolby home theatre system if not your taste in movies.
2187;Hollywood doesnt seem to be able to make an intelligent epic anymore, not that they were ever very good at it.
2188;Greatest movie of all time, I dont think so.
2189;Its often said that a great film gives you something new to love with each viewing.
2190;Everytime I have seen this film (or even just clips of this film) I've found something new to despise.
2191;In short, she is a male fantasy and luckily, Winslet is a good enough actress to be able to bring some wit and verve to a seriously underwritten role.
2192;anyway, the film also comes with a second story .
2193;Its about Cameron showing what he can do with a camera!
2194;Well, its a really long director's film that reveals that the director has absolutely no clue how to make anything resembling human interaction in any way compelling.
2195;Cameron reveals that he has a good feel for special effects with this film.
2196;I ordered this for my girlfriend so we could watch together as I never saw the movie but enjoyed watching it with her.
2197;I enjoyed this movie for the special effects and attention to detail.
2198;I must say that I didn't care too much for the romance between Rose and Jack, but I thought Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio gave good performances.
2199;I enjoyed the actual collision with the iceberg and the sinking itself.
2200;The special effects in this movie are first.
2201;Director James Cameron paid great attention to authenticity throughout the movie, including the sinking itself.
2202;This attention to detail led to 11 Oscar nominations for the film, as well as a world.
2203;The struggle for survival in the water is accuratley portrayed as well.
2204;I also enjoyed the beginning scenes where the submarines come upon the wreck itself.
2205;In the end, I liked the movie for the historical content, but I wasn't too high on the rest of it.
2206;This is one of about twenty I can watch over and over.
2207;Very Very Very Very Very Good Movie i Love It I Can Watch It All The Time It Makes Me Cry But Still Love The Movie.
2208;James Cameron's vision of a dramatic love story running parallel with the greatest maritime tragedy of our time is all at once grand, terrifying and very emotional.
2209;With a running time of over three hours not many directors could have kept the pace so brisk, but Cameron is well known for his skill at story telling and making sure you know where and what is happening at all times.
2210;Leo and Kate perform well with a casual script that lays down the ground work of two young people who obviously have immediate chemistry.
2211;She wants more than just to marry into a rich family as her mother has forced her to do for her own purposes.
2212;as Rose finally defies the marriage arrangement and two start to realize their love, the real tragedy starts.
2213;The visuals of the sinking ship are strikingly realistic, especially when the ship splits.
2214;His stamp of detail is intertwined throughout the movie.
2215;the historical accuracy is pinpoint as well.
2216;From the rich first class passengers characterizations to the discussion between the captain and the President of the Starlight company about speeding up the ship in order to arrive early.
2217;All of it was documented as actually history by at least more than one account.
2218;titanic won best picture and best director as well as many other awards, all well deserved.
2219;In no way was this movie meant to be as popular as it was but it is a credit to Cameron to make something that is not only so obviously personal but to also make it so appealing, engrossing and emotional.
2220;The digital transfer is awesome, great picture and sound.
2221;"There is great one with Jack actually beating the crud out of Lovejoy
I:30;2222;I for one thought Lovejoy deserved to get pummeled and was glad to be able to see this scene.
I:30;2223;The special edition discs are loaded, and I do mean LOADED.
I:30;2224;the love story in this movie is like giving Anne Frank a wacky best friend in the attic to make the story more interesting.
I:30;2225;Everything is great and believable from the sinking to the freezing water.
I:30;2226;Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet gave very very excellent performances and I couldn't help but watch it over and over again.
I:30;2227;I truly recommend it for anybody who hasn't seen it.
I:30;2228;It's worth your every penny and time!
I:30;2229;She was learnign about the Titanic in school so it was a good time to rewatch
I:30;2230;a wonderful movie with a wonderful love story to go with the events of the loss of the great ship titanic.
I:30;2231;if you want suspense, adventure, and great special affects it has it too.
I:30;2232;its worth seeing over and over again.
I:30;2233;I love this movie and can't wait til it gets here!!
I:30;2234;I thought that the love story was nice.
I:30;2235;This is one of the best movies to come out of the 90's and a classic!
I:30;2236;Its positive points: the movie is beautifully filmed, and the special effects are on a scale of realism and scope I've never seen before.
I:30;2237;The music is pleasing, in that epic.
I:30;2238;sweeping sort of way, and Kate Winslet does her usual marvelous job of acting.
I:30;2239;Finding true love and one's personal inner fire is both personal and intriguing.
I:30;2240;Cameron won the accolades of his Hollywood peers and a very big paycheck.
I:30;2241;If that is what it takes to sell a movie ticket and make a name for yourself in Hollywood .
I:30;2242;time, as well as the highest grossing movie.
I:30;2243;It broke attendance records that were held by Star Wars for something like twenty years.
I:30;2244;And you know what?It was pretty good.
I:30;2245;eyed a couple times because of the intense emotional charge.
I:30;2246;That scene is so fierce, as it is the fulfillment of her promise and there's just this I. wILL.
I:30;2247;i'm very happy this movie was made.
I:30;2248;It also gave us Kate Winslet, who has become one of my favorite actresses of all time.
I:30;2249;so all in all, it was good, and I'm glad I waited eight years to see it.
I:30;2250;I'm a much more empathic and emotive person now, which allows me to enjoy life and its many accoutrements with a greater depth and breadth.
I:30;2251;i hereby anoint this movie with a large golden violin and a lifetime supply of towels.
I:30;2252;A great plot, and fantastic actors who do an incredible acting performance for their parts.
I:30;2253;Kate Winslet is really a very beautiful gal, and Leonardo DiCaprio is a young fellow who is really charismatic and highly talented in his acting.
I:30;2254;rich and poor, and about love.
I:30;2255;I believe that 70 years from now this motion picture will still be viewed by all audiences.
I:30;2256;I love this movie so excited to watch it again, came even more on time than I expected it too!
I:30;2257;Recommend if you love this movie as much as I do!
I:30;2258;This is without a doubt, one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:30;2259;For those of you criticizing the movie for the fictional love story between Jack and Rose, that was an ingenious maneuver to draw the entire world into the story and begin to experience it.
I:30;2260;I highly recommend this to everyone young and old and in between.
I:30;2261;James Cameron did an outstanding job.
I:30;2262;He took the story of Titanic and sunk it right to the bottom of our hearts.
I:30;2263;I know that sounds really dark, but it is just such a mysterious and intriguing subject.
I:30;2264;By far, this is the best movie ever made, and my personal favorite.
I:30;2265;The love story between Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) is so lovely and romantic.
I:30;2266;The part where he takes her to the bow of the ship, and she """"flies"""" is the best part of the whole movie."""
2267;When the ship hits the iceberg, you still have about an hour and a half to go, and it is action packed.
2268;It is very heartbreaking, but you almost feel like it's OK.
2269;He released Rose from her chains, and told her to never give up on life.
2270;The part that was the most touching to me was the end, when old Rose is in bed, and it shows you pictures of her life, and all the things she has done, fulfilling her promise to Jack.
2271;It makes you grateful for life, and glad you have another day to live.
2272;It's my favorite movie, and I am sure I will watch it over and over and over again.
2273;but the movie is so good that you'll forget about this details when you start to see it!
2274;I felt this movie had a lot of good points, and equally a number of bad ones.
2275;I'll start off with the good.
2276;I thought that the special effects were fantastic, particularly the scenes where the ship was sinking.
2277;I thought that they got the layout of the ship very accurate, and you could really sense the 'newness', freshness and splendor of this ship on its maiden voyage.
2278;It certainly had a feel of 1912 about it.
2279;I always love a good chick flick.
2280;Plus, I love the history surrounding the fateful ship, the Titanic.
2281;Although it isn't 100% accurate, I still love this movie!
2282;of the deleted scenes I found only two enjoyable.
2283;(You see the iceberg drift past the windows behind her)Though the extended and alternate endings were a treat as well.
2284;the movie is just as enjoyable though every time you see it.
2285;Titanic is the best film ever made and frankly .
2286;I mean i love love love loved it.
2287;I've been watching it all the time since i was six and i can practically recite the whole movie.
2288;The special effects are amazing for their time and the story line is amazin too giving us some lines we'll NEVER forget!
2289;lets just say that i love this movie and i loved the special edition even more!
2290;This movie is a great production.
2291;This came to me as a gift.
2292;Just one of the best movies ever made.
2293;It is a ride from beginning to end.
2294;Makes you appreciate what you have.
2295;And with those four, triumphant words, Titanic took us all on a ride we won't soon forget!
2296;grossing movie of all time.
2297;They've voted it the best over films like Star Wars and Raiders Of The Lost Ark and I totally disagree.
2298;Titanic is a good movie but it doesn't offer more than Star Wars or Raiders Of The Lost Ark.
2299;"There are a lot more scenes other than that which he stole too
I:30;2300;Check out A Night To Remember and you'll see this.
I:30;2301;offs Titanic is still well made, mostly because the fantastic special effects make the sinking of the ship so believeable.
I:30;2302;The acting was great (most of the time).
I:30;2303;Leo is a good actor and is pretty cute, but I don't know why girls make such a big deal about him.
I:30;2304;It was a great movie.
I:30;2305;I would recommend it to people 12 and over.
I:30;2306;A Clockwork Orange received 8% one star ratings.
I:30;2307;In their scenes together her head is larger than his.
I:30;2308;I liked the part at the end where she believes she is meeting Jack on the stairs again.
I:30;2309;She is a tremendous actress.
I:30;2310;I was glad to see how her love and passion for him made her go back into the bowels of that sinking ship to rescue him.
I:30;2311;Anyway, it's a good movie of it's type.
I:30;2312;That was the best Molly Brown I've even seen in a Titanic movie.
I:30;2313;What an actress she is.
I:30;2314;I was thrilled when I heard that this Special Collector's Edition was being released and that fans would finally have a chance to see all the scenes that had gotten cut from the movie, as well as the alternate ending.
I:30;2315;i also like how you are given the option of viewing the behind.
I:30;2316;The US collection includes the """"30 Second Recreation with Bunnies"""" (which is hilarious!)"""
2317;"hand corner of the screen (you can also hit ""5"" on your remote and ENTER)This collection is a must."
2318;Titanic is the highest grossing movie of all.
2319;ray Special Features disc also glitches a bit.
2320;I love this movie and I had to find a place where it was sold at.
2321;This is by far the best Titanic movie.
2322;Well, I think James Cameron wanted to set the scene which he did in a beautiful way, look he won 11 Oscars!
2323;this movie has a beautiful love story.
2324;They fall in love and share passionate times together.
2325;Along with some great special effects.
2326;All I can say is I love this movie and if you don't, then you wouldn't know love.
2327;It storyline keeps you entranced and would recommend highly
2328;i just love this movie i cant tell you how many times i have watched it.
2329;Seriously,i think this is one of the most perfect movie i've ever watched.
2330;and with a stellar cast.
2331;and the wonderful news of how it was nominated for some 11 Oscars.
2332;leonardo DiCaprio portrayed himself really well in his role as Jack Dawson,an aspiring artist who falls for the rich and astoundingly beautiful Rose DeWitt Bukater,played by Kate Winslet.
2333;and the already nominated Kate for her role as the young Marianne in Sense and Sensibility,this is a wonderful and the mother of all Titanic films.
2334;a provoking tale was the poignant scene where viewers will be able to identify with when Jack freeze to death,as well as the unforgettable line from the movie You jump,I jump .
2335;titanic,with a stellar cast,wonderful background and the nice yet melancholy movie.
2336;from the director of true lies and the terminator,truly deserves to be one of the greatest movie of all times.
2337;boppers) along with its top.
2338;He does well in such films as Basketball Diaries with which he appears to identify with.
2339;i believe that if more consideration was given to the script, especially the deletion of the male fantasy i. e. Kate Winslet's posing nude for a portrait (thus removing our shameless voyeurism), and the relationship between English society and people were further explored and devoid of stereotypes and cliches, the acting would/might follow through and might have actually made a very good movie.
2340;The most impressive and realistic was the actual sinking and the Carpathia looking for survivors.
2341;Titanic has to be, in my opinion, the greatest movie ever made.
2342;The special effects where great.
2343;I knopw I'll be 1st in line in the video store on Sept. 1st.
2344;The special effects were outstanding, and it is visually breathtaking.
2345;Also, although Cameron took some liberties for dramatic effect, the film is pretty accurate from a historical standpoint.
2346;Yes, Leo's character is amusing at times, but I found his whole prepubescent look a little at odds with my perception of a romantic male lead.
2347;So, I think the movie is worth watching .
2348;tugging moments during the sinking and wow, are the sounds and visuals impressive!
2349;Yes, Kate's character finally gets some gumption towards the end, but frankly, I liked Rose a lot better as an elderly woman.
2350;So Jack and Rose, like the rest of this movie, are nice to look at, but they don't move me.
2351;If you've been living in a cave for the last couple years and haven't seen this movie, it's decent entertainment.
2352;The things that made Titanic attractive and eye candy, Cameron's precision and dedication to the little things, is what makes the weaknesses of the movie stand out.
2353;All in all, Titanic is technically a great movie, a testament to the director's discipline and dedication.
2354;That's about all that's worth watching.
2355;I was given this as a gift and I have to say I'll never take a movie from that person ever again.
2356;My major reasons is EXTRAS!
2357;For one I love commentaries and this set will offer three of them up.
2358;Commentaries give good insight, humor and let you get a feel for those involved in making the movie.
2359;I like that James Cameron has a commentary (loved his commentaries on Aliens, Terminator and T2 Ultimate Edition).
2360;The Director commentaries are usually good if the director is not boring.
2361;Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart should give insight into the character of Rose.
2362;The romance is the drawing point to relate to what these people went through.
2363;Though the mystery of just what took place that night is still very compelling, the romantic aspect makes it very relatable to people today.
2364;Titanic is a very visual movie.
2365;It's strengths lie in beautiful scenery of the ship, ocean and sky.
2366;The score matches the breathtaking scenery.
2367;flick, but the romance is what gives the movie heart and emotion.
2368;For those of you who want reality about Titanic I recommend watching History or Discovery channels.
2369;For those of you who want to be entertained by a romance along with a some bits of reality Titanic should be the movie for you!
2370;ray Just To See the Ship in all its Glory and Second I give it 5 stars only because I love Old Ships and Seeing em in Blu.
2371;High budget, exceptionally directed, and a wow that succeeds in so many aspects of movie making, arguably the best picture ever shot on film.
2372;It takes meticulous professional and emotionally.
2373;and well in a era that has produced some of the highly renown and top rated movies of all time .
2374;Titanic went for 14 Academy awards and won 11.
2375;Statistically it's the best movie ever brought to film.
2376;(well I've been one my whole life really) Titanic has yet to be beat respectively.
2377;found sense of awe came over me.
2378;I was able to see the film as it was meant to be seen, in theaters, and instead of being unimpressed as I had before, I enjoyed the movie and got an understanding for why so many enjoyed it.
2379;from the moment the disc starts, the high.
2380;def imagery and sound catches you and keeps you involved in the film that's been called a timeless classic to your typical romantic story .
2381;While it doesn't capture everything I experienced in theaters, which most likely will never happen, the beauty of the colors and visual effects as the Titanic sinks and people die still caused me to pause and feel helpless.
2382;if you are a movie enthusiast, I highly recommend giving this version a shot and seeing if it changes your opinion of the film.
2383;The extra features takes you into the world of making the highest grossing Best Picture winner and shows the many things they did in this pre.
2384;The aura surrounding the movie and it's subject, as we all know, grabbed the nation and held on for years.
2385;I have to hand it to Cameron and crew.
2386;This was done in good taste.
2387;It all has it's place and it beautiful.
2388;This film won best picture but I can guarantee you it was mostly due to the graphics that were, at the time, way beyond anything we'd seen before.
2389;in order to save the one he loves.
2390;I did give this film two stars because the ending is quite fascinating, especially the scene where the captain sees the water about to crash through his window.
2391;"Even better was 1958's ""A Night To Remember"",an excellent British docu."
2392;seeing it once on the big screen was enough.
2393;the final scenes were indeed memorable and at times impressive.
2394;James Cameron,one of Hollywood's top egomaniacs,should know less is more.
2395;Me and my family love this movie.
2396;I have seen it several times since, and it still rocks the house everytime.
2397;Thanks Mr. Cameron, for making a movie that really touched my soul.
2398;It definatly makes the movie even more enjoyable.
2399;The film also contains 2 aditional special feature disks to enjoy.
2400;ray really makes everything sharp, clear and look amazing as if you were on board the Titanic.
2401;I do feel that your tv size makes a difference.
2402;You can really get into it and even feel like you apart of the film.
2403;if you love this movie then you should check this one out.
2404;I would have given it maybe 3 stars based on it being a sappy story with impressive effects and excellent costumes and set design.
2405;Cameron also directed this blockbuster.
2406;It's probably Di Caprio's best role because it fits his youth and personality.
2407;Later there are the famous scenes of the lovers cavorting at the bow.
2408;the overhead shots of the ship are very impressive: the camera glides over the majestic funnels and decks from stern to bow.
2409;The technical features of the movie are quite well done.
2410;The gutsy, outspoken Unsinkable Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) is aboard.
2411;It's a great romantic movie of young love combined with a disaster flick.
2412;So nice to have this movie on one disk now.
2413;Sure, there are inaccuracies in any movie but it was really well done and James Cameron knows what he is talking about when it comes to the Titanic.
2414;There are only 6 ways to tell a love story and the formula here is one of the most popular and overdone.
2415;i'm sorry, but even the best 'good guys' in the best stories have faults.
2416;thats what make them so good and believable.
2417;And yes, one of them saw it in the theatre 15 times.
2418;This film does a good job of making you feel you are a passenger of Titanic and are really there when the stuff hits the fan(or the ice berg) You may even weep for all the ill fated people.
2419;the authenticity of the sets to what the Real Titanic was and had was remarkable.
2420;overall, yes, this is a good movie, don't be scared away from the predictable love story.
2421;and despite my better judgement and initial expectations I have returned to the film over and over again with great enjoyment.
2422;nonetheless the film is epic and Mr. Cameron has created a marvelous film.
2423;Grandiose in its spectacle and true to the spirit of the overall event.
2424;all criticism aside it is a film truly worthy of the Best Picture designation.
2425;This film was so popular, that I have to ask, Can millions of people be wrong?
2426;the technical aspects of this film were GREAT!
2427;proud Youth (an artist, of course), Billy Zane as the Evil Rich Guy who is engaged to Winslett, the Naive Ingenue.
2428;Most people with any sense of fairness will detest the stereotyping of The Rich in this movie.
2429;the sad thing is, all the actors, really, are good actors.
2430;The brilliance of the subtext of the mise.
2431;scene that can only be described as Cameronian contains magical attempts at recreating the atmospheric retro.
2432;The delicate inbalance between tension in form and looseness in style can best be described as octavian in its mirror.
2433;The temporal symbiosis of both young and old best represents the duality within Cameron's work in general (think of the dual terminators, or perhaps the duality between the regular and the mutated pirahnas in Pirahna part 2: THE SPAWNING).
2434;Better price fom Amazon than in the stores at $25.00 ,picture on Blu/Ray is very crip and clean .
2435;This is my daughter's Xmas gift.
2436;She loves it, We couldn't believe it when it arrived home, so my girls watched it and enjoyed very much!
2437;Nice picture and sound for a classic!
2438;I saw this movie in the theater and thought, That is the best movie I have ever seen!
2439;Great sound and perfect picture!
2440;The music is inspiring in itself, enhancing the sense of grandiosity the ship embodied.
2441;The last bits of footage with the distressed captain and the sinking of the ship are very good, even excellent.
2442;I give this movie a 5.
2443;It won 11 Academy Awards.
2444;It's sad, interesting, entertaining, suspenseful, scary, and romantic all rolled into one.
2445;Kate Winslet plays the role of Rose very well, but I think the best actor in the whole movie was Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson.
2446;Billy Zane, who played Cal, also did a great job.
2447;He's my favorite character in the whole movie.
2448;Really, every actor did a great job .
2449;The script is great, the special effects are great, the story is great.
2450;Now, the musical score by James Horner was good and fits the movie well.
2451;overall, this is a great epic movie that I highly recommend.
2452;"I personally find it to be the greatest movie ever made, the Academy Awards seemed to think it was a pretty damn good movie (tied for the most wins), the soundtrack and the single ""My Heart Will Go On"" shot to #1 Worldwide, the critics when it first came out weren't too harsh and movie."
2453;titanic was authentic and historically accurate.
2454;It included more then just the love story.
2455;"class band and their situation, what exactly was sung the last time day light hit the Titanic at the morning church gathering, increasing more speed regardless of ice warnings and many more examples were all little details included in this movie which made it far more then just a ""love story""."
2456;The sets, costumes, and the special affects were amazing in this movie.
2457;Just watching this movie is visually amazing.
2458;Rose also opened your eyes to the luxuries high society had and how woman were truly trapped and were seen as second.
2459;The dynamics between Rose and her mother also show the dynamics between how woman had to behave and in a sense how they survived in society at this time.
2460;the love story in this movie created sympathy in which you felt for Jack and Rose.
2461;It made you truly feel how the people on the Titanic were feeling at that exact moment.
2462;Families, loved ones and friends were being torn apart.
2463;This makes the love story important to the actual event itself because it creates a feeling of emotion, which many people lacked before seeing this film.
2464;the ending of this movie was amazing.
2465;In most love stories they would have both survived and lived happily ever after, but this truly hit home the pain people felt after this shipwreck.
2466;when they showed the pictures of Rose doing everything her and Jack talked about and dying warm in her bed as he said she would was a wonderful way to end it in my opinion.
2467;I don't know why but it just seemed like the perfect way to end it.
2468;And how Jack was waiting in the same spot he did earlier in the movie was wonderful.
2469;But it is a movie and you have to have suspense, and even though these things were unlikely they were still probable and made the movie entertaining.
2470;I personally give an A+ for acting and even the script.
2471;honestly, this movie had everything.
2472;Funny parts, love, death, drama and beauty.
2473;I enjoyed this movie and am proud to say it is my favorite.
2474;There's a reason why this film earned 11 academy awards, and is possibly the best of all time.
2475;The sets were the most beautiful, and very accurate to the real ship.
2476;The story was excellent, even though you knew what happens to the ship.
2477;And the special effects were top notch.
2478;Which is still my favorite, and listen to it several times a week.
2479;Thank you for this masterpiece!!
2480;An old lady still deeply in love, with some kid she spent one night with more then 70 years ago.
2481;This movie is fantastic, little hard to get and is expensive used but well worth it.
2482;It's a great classic and always will be.
2483;james Cameron,who has been a great director up until the point this film was concieved.
2484;"fairly&honestly
I:30;2485;if you want to see a movie that has something going for it&does"
2486;It's nice to get the bonus discs as well.
2487;It did not interrupt my movie experience and I continue to love this movie.
2488;So glad that I can own it in such high definition.
2489;It looks and sounds great.
2490;And the commentaries and special features are great, STILL haven't gotten through all of them.
2491;the love and tragedy film of all times, you cant tell what is best, if the plot, the customs, the scenery, the sinking of the boat or the final surprise, if you don't watch this movie you loose a piece of cinematographic history
2492;ray version of the classic.
2493;The images are crisp, clean and accurate.
2494;When you do get into a more colorful area (Rose's cabin suite, for example), your eyes almost pop out from the lush richness of it all.
2495;a brilliant job of remastering and restoring.
2496;The sound, however, could use some major tweaking but, on the whole, the story is now officially a classic and this Blu.
2497;ray version has assured its place there.
2498;possibly the finest aspect of Titanic is the performance of Kate Winslet.
2499;The film is basically about her transformation from depressed teenager to brave womanhood, and Winslet emodies the role with beauty and panache.
2500;Winslet should've won the Oscar, but that's a whole other column.
2501;"Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" is a classic for the ages."
2502;It's right up there with GWTW!
2503;Gone With the Wind got away with it because it was poetically written and magnificently acted, especially by Vivien Leigh.
2504;What Cameron is not, is a screenwriter, or much good with actors.
2505;What he is, is a brilliant action director, and when the ship begins to collapse (finally), there are long, thrilling set pieces that will probably be analyzed in film classes for years to come.
2506;The extra's in the box are VERY Cool!
2507;Well worth the price of admission!
2508;In the top five of both my wife and I and generally we do not like the same kind of movies.
2509;This one has the romantic story for her and I have a grand tour of the Titanic with lots of technical details.
2510;Those huge reciprocating steam engines have always fascinated me but to see them operate with the addition of depth was mind blowing!
2511;I especially enjoyed the specials at the end of the movie.
2512;So much has been said about this amazing achievement in film, it's difficult to come up with any new insights as to why it touched so many people.
2513;Perhaps the best endorsement I can make however, is that it speaks a universal language .
2514;I took my Cuban born mother to see it when it opened.
2515;She doesn't speak English, but was immediately wrapped up in the film, so much so that she was one of the first to cheer it at the end.
2516;despite the language obstacle, here was a 65 year old woman who enjoyed the film from its opening scene right through the end.
2517;To me, that alone makes Titanic a triumph.
2518;I'm a huge fan of this movie and I have all the other versions of it at home.
2519;I'm pretty sure I have seen this move at least 20 times and it never gets old!
2520;Winner of a lot of Academy Awards and who knows what else.
2521;I'm one of those people who thinks that the movie, the cast, and the crew got deserved all that it got.
2522;All of the performances are worthy, and are given with heart.
2523;She was astounding, and so is her beauty.
2524;The rest of the supporting cast were wonderful, and I can't go without mentioning Kathy Bates.
2525;Her character, Molly, was the most lovable woman ever to grace the big screen, but that's just my opinion on that.
2526;When the sinking began, the movie took a faster pace, and did it well.
2527;All the while, focusing on Rose and Jack's love for each other.
2528;Titanic is an incredible film!
2529;I laughed, cried, and even yelled out what a jerk Kal was in the middle of the a packed theatre on opening night.
2530;This was a wonderful movie and I recommend it highly
2531;And the price was great!
2532;im a big fan of the movie and this is a fans dream.
2533;i love all the extras
2534;I liked the design on the box.
2535;I've watched it several times since I received it and plan on watching it a lot more.
2536;grand daughter wanted to see the original and this was great.
2537;She hates love stories and loved this one
2538;With this movie being in full screen you'll seriously feel as if you are actually in the movie with the actors, with this movie in a way so to speak it will take you back in time and place you on/in the Titanic.
2539;The scenes seems to be to scale are very realistic.
2540;Disc 3 is really the gem in this set with all the extras, special features and really getting to dive into the making of this film.
2541;For the Titanic collector, this is a perfect gift and a great keepsake.
2542;I first saw it when I was thirteen and was touched beyond anything I could describe.
2543;Nothing could top this movie.
2544;The acting's incredible, the music's the very essence of love, and the story is not only haunting, but strong and hopeful despite the tragedy.
2545;As a recent subscriber to Netflix, I finally got around to watching Titanic.
2546;a story of thwarted passion against the backdrop of one of history's greatest manmade catastrophes .
2547;eyed for a woman who is beyond his social milieu, then driven forward by the thrill of adventure and the hunt.
2548;Those who want to be encapsulated inside a cocoon filled with sickening sweetness for three hours may enjoy this.
2549;I plan to watch the rest of it asap but I thought the beginning was pretty decent.
2550;It has so much more character than that, it has great narration with a good story arch and some of the best performances by wonderful actors with a fantastic cast.
2551;Leonardo DiCaprio seperates himself as a great lonesome kid ready to start fresh going back to his roots while Kate Winslet is terrific as a girl placed in a world she longs to depart.
2552;Though they have great chemistry, they are not the best performances as Kathy Bates and Billy Zane are two side characters with spit fire personality and strong presence on screen.
2553;The James Cameron team did a great job on this version of an already great movie.
2554;It is far better than the regular Blu.
2555;In my opinion, James Cameron was very intelligent, focusing the attention of the viewers on the water.
2556;"sugar love story between Leonardo diCaprio and Kate Winslet, and the overworked ""struggle between classes"" theme, just to mesmerize them with the fantastic technical and historical production related to the sinking."
2557;But some stories, some movies, have to be told using a Hundreds.
2558;"hating people that in fact have fun just ""being against"" something or other."
2559;There are a plethora of reviews here which concur with my sentiments, so I will refrain from expressing them in this review.
2560;worthy moments in Academy history.
2561;The film is a glorious accomplishment, and those with short memories forget that prior to it's December '97 release, Titanic had been dubbed a box office disaster.
2562;The box office records the film went on to break don't make it a great film.
2563;The story, direction, acting, and amazing efects make it so.
2564;All I can say is .
2565;The depth conveyed during the sinking of the ship really brings out the intensity and enormity of the scene.
2566;ray while the bonus features will be in blu.
2567;Titanic is a great movie.
2568;Titanic is a true classic.
2569;It's an instant classic of a movie that ranks up along the movie it's pays dedication to, A Night to Remember.
2570;brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) is a treasure hunter looking for a famous diamond among the debris of the Titanic.
2571;She is brought to the explorer's vessel to help them determine the location of the diamond, but instead she tells everyone the real story of Titanic's sinking.
2572;She was a 17 year.
2573;there is no question about it, Titanic is a landmark.
2574;"The film's technical department is remarkable, they actually built a ""new"" Titanic to make this movie, and it was well worth it."
2575;The sound and effects are truly breathtaking, while the editing and cinematography are beautiful and add a spark to the film.
2576;James Cameron's direction effort is brilliant, he may be a show.
2577;It's a masterpiece and it deserves to be praised highly by it's director and everyone else in the world.
2578;add to that a sizzling romance between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, some amazing set decoration, a heartpounding and heartbreaking score an end sequence that is truly unforgettable and you have what is the closest the world will ever get to the best romance film of all time.
2579;I saw the original movie in the theater, it was great then, so I was very curious to see it at home in 3.
2580;d, that was amazing to watch.
2581;These movies are done so beautifully in 3.
2582;d. I'd advise everyone to have this type of TV, to see the big difference in what a 3.
2583;What a surprise when this gift was unwrapped!
2584;I'll never forget the look on my daughter's face and the enjoyment of watching her enjoy the movie!
2585;We really enjoyed the whole movie, and were pleased with the service we received.
2586;the part with the 9 headed baboon and the 3.
2587;"I loved this movie
I:30;2588;This movie had so many interesting characters, plots and themes going on at the same time.
I:30;2589;I loved the period dress and etiquette.
I:30;2590;The love story between Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio and Rose (Kate Winslet) in my opinion is one of the great theatrical love stories in the history of the cinema.
I:30;2591;The movie layout was impeccable.
I:30;2592;I highly recommend to those who have not seen.
I:30;2593;Together until the last moment.
I:30;2594;She insists that she is the girl in the picture, and this is her story.1912:The story begins with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) winning 2 tickets for him and his friend for 3rd class on the Titanic.
I:30;2595;Rose comes from a high class society and is engaged to a rich man whom she is not in love with.
I:30;2596;The good family name is all that has kept them in high society, and she must marry this guy to keep them from being poor.
I:30;2597;Rose decides that is best for her and then can't take it being without Jack and goes to him.
I:30;2598;He is chained to the basement.
I:30;2599;Panic has arisen and Rose finds an axe to cut Jack from where he is chained.
I:30;2600;He takes her hand and they jump off and swim to a piece of a cabinet floating in the water.
I:30;2601;She gets on top and holds his hand.
I:30;2602;He makes her promise that she will make it safely and she does.
I:30;2603;She finds a whistle and blows it lightly.
I:30;2604;She reaches into her pocket and takes out the heart diamond and throws it into the ocean.
I:30;2605;A man shot and killed and one man who shoots himself.
I:30;2606;Perhaps the writers should try and think of a better idea and go watch the best movie ever made on the Titanic which was 'A Night to Remember'.
I:30;2607;I bought it as a gift and it ran perfectly :D
I:30;2608;But I quickly changed my mind, it's fantastic!
I:30;2609;I admire this film espically for the amazing cinematography.
I:30;2610;It's surely the last great film of this century.
I:30;2611;I have loved the Titanic since it came out when I was young so I was thrilled that it was finally on Blu Ray.
I:30;2612;The set is a nice piece for a collector of Titanic things.
I:30;2613;The box is well made and good for a display.
I:30;2614;If you love the Titanic, this is for you.
I:30;2615;that multi billion dollar classic.
I:30;2616;Have we forgotten what excellent acting and an intelligable screenplay are?
I:30;2617;OK, I give Titanic 2 stars (although I don't know why) because the historical aspect of this film was documented well.
I:30;2618;ah, that is pure and simply.
I:30;2619;But as I said, Cameron does a pretty good job of recording the story of the Titanic.
I:30;2620;Great movie and has a very visually appealing packaging.
I:30;2621;titanic is a romance, an adventure and a thriller all in one.
I:30;2622;Rose accepts and the evening turns into a love affair between Jack and Rose.
I:30;2623;as the ship continues to sail, Rose sneaks around to secretly meet Jack.
I:30;2624;After several meetings, Jack offers to sketch a picture of Rose in the diamond necklace given to her by Cal.
I:30;2625;It is decided that women and children will be the first to admitted on the lifeboats.
I:30;2626;But realizes that it is big enough, and allows Rose to stay on while he floats in the freezing water waiting to be rescued.
I:30;2627;As a result of Jack's undying love for Rose, he gives his life so that the woman that he loves could live.
I:30;2628;This is a movie that I can watch over and over and enjoy every minute of it.
I:30;2629;Saw this movie when I was 8 or 9 years old in theaters and ever since then I was hooked.
I:30;2630;This movie receives alot of flack mostly because of it's success.
I:30;2631;This is probably the most romantic movie ever made.
I:30;2632;It has a great love story, and it has a great action sequence in the realism of the sinking of Titanic.
I:30;2633;If anything, at least watch the moving for the sinking sequence.
I:30;2634;The reason they have a love story in the movie is so that it will tug at our hearts more when the sinking and death starts taking place.
I:30;2635;Every rendition of Titanic, with exception to A Night to Remember, has had some kind of love story, and if you want a successful movie, you have to have a plot, not just a documentary.
I:30;2636;titanic is the big romance flick of our generation the way movies like Gone with the Wind and Casablanca were 60.70 years ago.
I:30;2637;It is a true classic and 40 years from now, people are going to look back at this movie the same way society looks back at old movies, even the worst, as great films.
I:30;2638;So we restarted watching it.
I:30;2639;And while this at heart is a true chick flick, it was quite engaging and lively.
I:30;2640;It was a really great movie and I'm sorry I waited so long to finally see it.
I:30;2641;Great movie,great product,great and friendly salesman.
I:30;2642;The special edition is a must.
I:30;2643;I watched the movie with Cameron's commentary running, and he was fascinating.
I:30;2644;i watched the first 30 minutes with the historical commentary, but found Cameron's commentary to be more insightful and entertaining.
I:30;2645;one of my favorite movies.
I:30;2646;comes wrapped in the plastic it came in.
I:30;2647;This was the best of all the Titanic movies made with the exception that it put two fictional characters at the front.
I:30;2648;am sure you will watch this movie many times.
I:30;2649;Would recommend it for everybody as is definitely a classic.
I:30;2650;I have viewed once already, and surely many more times in the future.
I:30;2651;fantastic adventure awaits the viewing public.
I:30;2652;be prepared to proclaim scenes to many family and neighbors.
I:30;2653;How best to describe this astonishingly epic film of love, loss, and heartbreak?
I:30;2654;to make us, the audience, feel for and care about these characters.
I:30;2655;James Cameron is a master at conveying the human condition and telling a good story, and this is his best work to date.
I:30;2656;nails suspense, and the historical accuracy of the film.
I:30;2657;Every one involved worked their butts off to produce an extraordinary film, and they succeeded.
I:30;2658;not only that, but I feel the characters are strongly written and well.
I:30;2659;I think that Rose DeWitt Bukater is one of the strongest and complicated female characters in any recent film, and Kate Winslet brough her extraordinary passion and talent to the film.
I:30;2660;i dan't care what all you jealous males out there think.Yes, I cringe at lines like, A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets, but give the film the credit it deserves.
I:30;2661;Who does not crave for a love like that?The special effects are spectacular, and James Horner's score is amazing.
I:30;2662;This movie is absolutely magnificent.
I:30;2663;It will always be one of my favorite films, and once again, James Cameron proves himself a master.
I:30;2664;So this film is a good film?
I:30;2665;top Hollywood movies is an art form, but I've always stood up for Titanic .
I:30;2666;It's an astonishingly good looking movie, for one thing .
I:30;2667;when a director spends $200 million, you expect good, and boy, do we get good here.
I:30;2668;The love story is beautifully done, Gloria Stuart is fabulous as the 101.
I:30;2669;old lady, and let's face it .
I:30;2670;Very good that it's not.
I:30;2671;I feel that he cast the roles of officers Charles Lightoller and Harole Lowe perfectly.
I:30;2672;It is an injustice to the family of William Murdock.
I:30;2673;She was a real heroine that night.
I:30;2674;If anyone comes to Denver Colorado, be sure to take a tour through the Molly Brown House.
I:30;2675;the soundtrack was also great, especially the song """"My heart Will Go On""""."""
2676;Their hearts really did go on.
2677;This is the first such conversion I tried, and now I'm a true convert.
2678;This movie was beautiful and romantic.
2679;I love the bonus features.
2680;It tells a beautiful love story and is the best movie ever made.
2681;They choose the best actors to be in it.
2682;On the other side of the spectrum, the movie itself is fantastic!
2683;Titanic is my favorite movie and features my favorite actor and actress.
2684;"This was a major blockbuster
I:30;2685;After all, I did see just that at the Titanic exhibit at one of our city museums yesterday and I know there are lots of books and films about the real thing.
I:30;2686;Amazing special affects and great attention to period piece details.
I:30;2687;The extras and the stunt folks were good too.
I:30;2688;well, it was the script that sank them.
I:30;2689;After all, with 2200 souls on the real Titanic there were lots of interesting characterizations to be had.
I:30;2690;I am very satisfied with the product i ordered.
I:30;2691;I received it within the time specified and it was in wonderful condition, as it said it would be.
I:30;2692;But against all expectations, this film had a great story line, a music which appealed to me enormously and good people who did a great job.
I:30;2693;After I saw Titanic, I was sure that this film would be my best film ever.
I:30;2694;I'd like to recommend this to you from the bottom of my heart.
I:30;2695;I bought this as a gift for my 13 year old daughter, who is a huge fan of the movie.
I:30;2696;She's a typical teenager so loves the love story here.
I:30;2697;Amazon has excellent customer service, always!
I:30;2698;TITANIC is the best movie ever.
I:30;2699;I got to meet people who were in the movie.
I:30;2700;I study it in books, and I got the newspaper from when the TITANIC sunk.
I:30;2701;This movie is one of my favorites of all time.
I:30;2702;The bonus footage is fun and informative as well.
I:30;2703;I've seen this wonderful movie 21 times, so far.
I:30;2704;The story of Jack the 3rd class guy, and Rose the 1st class gal, is very touching and riveting.
I:30;2705;The power of chemistry between the two are incredible.
I:30;2706;They captivated me when I first saw the movie.
I:30;2707;It all looks so real.
I:30;2708;What grabs me the most, is that this is real life.
I:30;2709;Not Jack and Rose, but the fate of the Titanic is totally real.
I:30;2710;It will keep you on the edge of your seat, has great special features.
I:30;2711;The acting is good, and the music is stunning (the """"My Heart Will Go On"""" song by Celine Dion is one heck of a ballad), but the movie itself is simply too long and way, way too scary and emotional (no small children allowed for this kind of film)"
2712;The picture is perfect in this great film.
2713;Everyone should see Titanic in blue ray it is fantastic.
2714;A must see film for everybody.
2715;This Oscar winner was nearly flawless!
2716;I have seen this movie 8 times so far:3 times in the theatre,and 5 at home on the video.
2717;i feel so sorry that the farest and the best of the thoughts of the producers and directors was to turn out the seemingly decent into a whocker's attitude as she poses for a masterpiece memorial.
2718;the frozen , and we all in the theatre burst into laugh on her.
2719;it was just a movie for the teens,that is it.
2720;I enjoyed this film, but I would have enjoyed it more if all these reviewers hadn't given away the ending and told me the ship sinks!
2721;i will leave the reviews of the actual film to those given toother formatsas I mostly concerned with conserving, for posterity, the laserdisc presentation of an incredible film.
2722;This epic movie won 11 Oscars and went on to become the highest grossing film of all time.
2723;He gets us to care about the majesty and beauty of the ship itself.
2724;Then he gets us involved in a fictional love story, that uses history as a backdrop.
2725;For those of you, who are the few individuals on the face of this Earth, who havn't seen the movie, the plot is fairly simple.
2726;He is a wealthy and smug man, who seems to treat her more as a possesion then a love interest and is intent on reigning in her free spirited nature.
2727;This movie is successful because it envelopes us whole into this opulent world of the past, where money, class and gender distinction mean everything.
2728;We watch as Rose emancipates herself from the formidable rules of this world.
2729;Finally, we see an incredibly meticulous, historically accurate, depiction of the Titanic disaster as it unfolds in very human terms.
2730;This is one of those rare times in which the big Hollywood budget actually helped instead of hindering the creativity and vision of a film maker and his movie.
2731;The attention to authenticity and detail is just amazing!
2732;Everything just comes together from the casting, the wonderful performances, the script, authentic period costumes, amazing sets and special effects (that are truely special without overwhelming the story) and even James Horner's unforgettable, musical score.
2733;Movies work best, when they transport us to another world that not only entertains us, but says something about the human condition.
2734;"I think the film ""Titanic"" works on all these levels."
2735;"It is Nirvana for both ""Titanic"" fans and movie buffs in."
2736;you see this guy jack found this pretty girl on that big boat.
2737;anyway, he found this girl rose on the boat.
2738;anyway,they got together and had some good times.
2739;but he kept going and eventually won her heart.
2740;mom says they were really cute together.
2741;so everything was going fine until the boat hit the iceberg, and this is where the sad part begin.
2742;the lesson i learned from that movie is that you should never give up on love.
2743;it is important to believe in it.
2744;you watch that movie amazon and you see its good.your frind kent
2745;There are so many extras and features on this set that you'll never get through it all in one sitting.
2746;"There is one thing I noticed after watching the excellent four part feature set called ""Reflections on Titanic"" and that was where is Leonardo DiCaprio?"
2747;This is hosted by the Director, James Cameron who you really appreciate his genius and intellect.
2748;This documentary alone is already worth the price of this set.
2749;Titanic had the potential to be a really good movie.
2750;very good picture, the sound is a little weak, but with a surround sound connect to the tv, it should be good
2751;"cameron's inspiration for the film was predicated on his fascination with shipwrecks
I:30;2752;Nominated for fourteen Academy Awards, it won eleven, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben Hur (1959) for most Oscars won by a single film.
I:30;2753;Got this cause I love the hours long epic movies.
I:30;2754;They pack so much in that these types of movies are something you want to watch at least once a year.
I:30;2755;I always was interested in the story of Titanic.
I:30;2756;This Collector's Edition really helped explain the way they made the movie, how Mr. Bodine was a real person who studies Titanic under the water and not even an actor.
I:30;2757;GREAT story, GREAT behind the scenes and commentaries!
I:30;2758;This movie strikes me with awe everytime I see it.
I:30;2759;When I think about all the money and all the work that went into that whole movie, it is just amazing.
I:30;2760;The thing that hits me the most, really, about the whole movie, is that the Titanic WAS real!
I:30;2761;The women and children who were on the Titanic actually had to say good bye to their husbands and fathers knowing full.
I:30;2762;So, I thought this movie was very real.
I:30;2763;My favorite part of the movie was most definitely: BILLY ZANE!!
I:30;2764;i thought he played an incredible role in the movie.
I:30;2765;he somehow ALWAYS pulls off that villain role perfectly!
I:30;2766;the guy who played Lovejoy was good.
I:30;2767;the guy who played Mr. Andrews was good.
I:30;2768;The Captain Smith guy was really good.
I:30;2769;i think he did a great job of getting people to hate him and he always seemed real.
I:30;2770;James Horner is a total genius and I think that the music was the perfect exclamation point to the entire movie!I would recommend this movie to anyone who is in for a movie that is excited, romantic, and fun all at the same time.
I:30;2771;I think that it can be appealing to both men and women.
I:30;2772;It is like a """"chick flick"""" with the romantic story."""
2773;but it can also appeal to men with its reality and excitement.
2774;You get attached to characters during the story and you watch to see if they make it in the end.
2775;i got it at a real good price.
2776;i love the movie but very disappointing not to be able to watch it after I paid for it and waited 3 weeks to come in.
2777;I loved this movie Titanic.
2778;this is definetly worth having good cry over and one of The Best in 1997!!!!
2779;great movie, husband hates when ever he hears the music, because he know what I am watching, comes in and is like , ugh!
2780;When i first watched this in the cinema i thought it was good, but we had to watch it with a fifteen minute interval so that spoiled it for me a bit.
2781;The first thing that got me was the incredible lines between the classes and how they were treated.
2782;The most powerful of the movie and I applaud Cameron for those.
2783;This was an actual event.
2784;The people that watched this movie for the sheer love story make me sick.
2785;Stop being a romantic and realize that the entire second half of that movie (long, but Cameron wanted to make it in real.
2786;Titanic is a movie that is appealing to all ages.
2787;The people out there who are bashing this film do not really see past their own short comings and should realize that a film that has generated so much attention, awards, praise,.
2788;etc. is a film to respect.
2789;A tip of the hat to you Mr. Cameron.
2790;deCaprio nicely captures the youth, romance, and energy of Jack.
2791;Zane was wonderful as the villian you love to hate.
2792;But the real star of the show is director James Cameron, who created jaw.
2793;dropping special effects on such a grand scale.
2794;The sinking of the Titanic is unforgettable.
2795;James Horner's soundtrack is memorable, too.
2796;This movie deserved its Best Picture Oscar.
2797;titanic is the greatest movie of all time.
2798;it will make u a fan of the elligant kate winslet and the great leo dicaprio
2799;I absolutely LOVE this movie.
2800;See something new every time I watch it.
2801;While Leo and Billy are usually 50/50 in a movie meaning they either are amazing or suck horribly they both give amazing performanes.
2802;Bill PAxton, although a small role, does an amazing job.
2803;He does seem to focus on the more dramatic but he does a great job.
2804;The script is truly memorable.
2805;"From the often quoted ""I'm The King of the World"" to ""I'd rather be his whore than your wife"" James also is one of the directors who trusts his actors enough to let them ad lib."
2806;This just shows how great she is.
2807;From the sepia tone in the beginning of the movie with the haunting theme and all the way through the movie you are simply amazed by the scenery.
2808;All of the sets are breathtaking.
2809;My guy friends especially love it when the rutters fly up as the boat makes its final descent into the murky depths.
2810;This movie is one of the biggest films of all times and yet before anyone went to see it we all already knew the ending.
2811;This is a movie that millions around the world have enjoyed time and time again.
2812;"This movie is a worthy addition to the very long list of movies that have been done regarding the story of the fated ship ""Titanic"" is brought to the silver screen."
2813;the love story between the two ill fated lovers is both touching at sweet.
2814;I think that Mr. Cameron has done a very good job taking a real situation and adding a touch of Hollywood.
2815;This movie won several Academy Awards and was worthy of each one.
2816;"I highly recommend ""Titanic"" if you want a good story that audiences can relate to."
2817;taking magnificence of Titanic from 1997 is unsurpassabled by any other fascinating film.
2818;life catastrophe , which happened in 1912, is combined with an fictional love story.
2819;The handsome star Leonardo Di Caprio and the Oscar nominated Kate Winslet are the young lovers Jack and Rose in the film, who meet at first passage on the unsinkable Titanic.
2820;winning producer James Cameron stages a brilliantly film about forbidden love and courage in a beginning disaster with a just so fitting soundtrack and a remarkable technical department.
2821;piece with romantic and dramatic elements and a lot of action and humor everyone should have seen.
2822;fated lovers and the ship that suffers the same fate is one that is truly spectactular.
2823;The way he puts it, it deserves it and owed it to the passengers and crew of the Titanic to do so.
2824;This set includes many, many extras that are all fascinating.
2825;which I found the most interesting, lots of cut scenes that explain things that may have been unclear (like why Rose was so upset when she wanted to commit suicide), and featurettes that include interviews with actual survivors.
2826;All in all, it is a great set.
2827;Overall, a great movie with great features.
2828;Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio SIZZLE on screen.you can actually feel their love and passion through your television screen!
2829;each and every time I watch this movie!
2830;Great film, even better performances by 2 amazing actors.
2831;My grandaughter wanted this for Christmas and I was happy to get it for her.
2832;The only character worthy to mention by name is Molly Brown, and she should have had a lot more time on screen.
2833;james Cameron, you are most definitely not worthy!
2834;What's a moovie without ACTION , the main thing to a good moovie.
2835;Titanic is quite simply one of the best tales of a true life tragedy interspersed with a fictional love story ever made, all of which combines to make director James Cameron appear a true genius which in terms of being a film director he is.
2836;i will freely admit that I'm not a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan but when it comes to this film he did an exceptional job in the role of Jack.
2837;Instrumental in the success of this film, beyond the exceptional script, is the performance given by the ever beautiful Kate Winslet in the role of Rose.
2838;With a list such as this one James Cameron has most certainly gone down in history as one of the most successful directors/screen writers in history and deservedly so.
2839;It would be nice to see him take a break from television and take up the film directing mantle once again as one can almost call it a sure bet film when he's in the director's chair.
2840;while the true story of this movie is the sinking of the ship told through Cameron's brilliant writing and direction there is whole myriad of other things going on that are not noticeable but would've been had they been done incorrectly, chief among these are the costumes and the sets of the Titanic.
2841;the truly fictitious portion of this tragedy is told through Rose Dawson Calvert (Gloria Stuart) as she regales present day treasure hunters of her time on the Titanic and the gloriously passionate but brief love affair between her and Jack Dawson who was a free spirited artist who taught her how to live despite his destiny.
2842;i highly recommend this film to any and all who are fans of what movie making is all about!
2843;Guys and Gals alike can sit and watch it and both enjoy it.
2844;The only good thing that could be said about the movie is that the special effects are good.
2845;I found someone selling it outside of the US.
2846;I received it in time for Christmas and I was so excited.
2847;It's her all time favorite movie.
2848;Bought this as a gift for my daughter who needed an upgrade from herVHS tape which she wore out.
2849;Sheabsolutely loves the Anniversary Edition.
2850;I enjoyed it immensely and could definetly watch it again.
2851;The movie is one i have seen 10x and still enoy it!
2852;A good classic of adventure and a love story!
2853;Giving the movie its due, it is an ambitious attempt to portray the historical events upon which it is based in a comprehensive and realistic way.
2854;class hero, adds NOTHING, casts a fairly talented actress (Kate Winslet) in the role of the ing nue and an over.
2855;class hero, and overlays it into the historical context.
2856;If you're interested in a romance, there are far better and far more original romance movies available (Captain Correlli's Mandolin, The English Patient, and A Walk In The Clouds to name a few) that you should consider.
2857;If you are interested in the movie for its depiction of the sinking of the Titanic, it is admittedly the best portrayal of the event.
2858;I guarantee that you can easily guess everything that happens in between, and it actually makes it a much better movie.
2859;This item was shipped in a very timely manor.
2860;Thank you for adding such a great movie to my collection.
2861;He definately delivered!The picture and the sound is brilliant.
2862;this is the best film ever made and most likely the best one that will ever be made.
2863;it's romantic, has drama and adventure.
2864;this is a must have movie.
2865;i haven't seen this in the theaters but most people say it's good.
2866;arrived well packaged, it is a gift, so i have not opened the actual disc set.
2867;All I can say is that this movie is by far my favorite movie of all time.
2868;Until recently, the last time I saw it was when it came out, and I can just tell you that I have a MUCH better appreciation of the movie after watching it several times now.
2869;Everything about it is spectacular.
2870;especially the love story between Jack and Rose.
2871;million blockbuster, that tells a great and tragic story.
2872;it will never top the classic epics of the 60's and 70's, but it's on the top near them.
2873;there are a lot of things you have to like in this movie.
2874;kate Winslet's and Kathy Bates's acting direction sound and visual effects musicIt was wonderfully directed, by the man that risked everything and got more back.
2875;I watched this movie many times as a teenager and I bought these for my daughters.
2876;I enjoyed the way the movies shows the differences between the rich and poor.
2877;Simply excellent,i have watched this movie many times and its been very emotional every time,every movie collector has to have this in their collections.
2878;This is one of the few movies that was so hyped up and so run into the ground that actually lived up to the hype.
2879;this was definitely a classic.
2880;with the best performance, by the way, coming from Zane and not either of the Oscar nomianted actresses.
2881;The most important character in this film.
2882;This love story, this drama, these characters.
2883;this has always been one of my favorite movies.
2884;it totally inmerses you into the story.
2885;Of all the movies made about the fabled and tragic sinking of the Titanic, this one is definitely the most entertaining.
2886;The attention toward costume and set detail is impressive, except women did not wear nearly that much makeup in 1912.
2887;Lavender was an extremely popular color at this time and often found in young ladies attire.
2888;There has always been considerable mystery shrouding the sinking of the Titanic.
2889;"Whereupon Call responds, ""Titanic is bigger and far more luxurious."""
2890;It will be always first or 3rd class passages that get the most publicity.
2891;While she herself and her mother are traveling under the disguise as being well to do and staying in the most luxurious suites Titanic has to offer payed for by her fianc !
2892;they make fun of the builder of the Titanic.
2893;another myth buster is the amount of well known wealthy passengers in first class.
2894;Many people confuse super natural irony with the natural course of the wealthy set of the day.
2895;The movie Titanic is very entertaining.
2896;I love to watch it.
2897;the best romantic film ever.
2898;Told against the backdrop of the real event this movie has everything .
2899;a great and story of romance and courage in the face of disaster.
2900;All that mattered was this wonderful story told with an excellent script,great directing and superb acting.
2901;life human interest stories about self.
2902;That's why it's so compelling all these years later, because ideals are timeless.
2903;This is my daughter's favorite movie, I had to get it on Blu ray so she can watch it at college
2904;it still holds up after all these years.
2905;Titanic is a modern day classic.
2906;packed with extras and for an extra bit of money I should have went that route.
2907;I had so much fun with this set.
2908;I had so much fun learning the ins and outs of this modern classic.
2909;This was a lovely, well acted movie.
2910;It's motive is to entertain, which is were the love story comes in.
2911;she has such a gorgeous voice.
2912;It really adds an uplifting feeling to the film.
2913;d. People are complaining about the actors in this film(mainly Leonardo DiCapreo)I thought he was brilliant.
2914;He played a funny, mischevious, handsome artist that opened Rose up and gave her a thing that her butthead fiancee couldn't.
2915;He was perfect for this role.
2916;I loved him in it and I was very proud of him in it.
2917;A lot of my friends were 5 and 6 when they first saw this.
2918;it's just the whole concept of the movie.
2919;But the romance is so addictive you watch it over and over.
2920;I highly recommend this movie to all hopeless romantics everywhere!
2921;This is a movie that covers more of the emotional side of Titanic.
2922;The main characters in this movie are Rose and Jack.
2923;The picture is more than good.
2924;It felt like a whole new film.
2925;In my opinion, it is the best film ever made.
2926;If you don't, than watch it anyway!Titanic is a movie worth seeing over and over again!
2927;in conclusion, Titanic is the greatest film of all time!
2928;well as for my problem with this movie, is that it focused on the two non.
2929;exisentent characters of Rose (played by the redhaired .
2930;It's been 10 years since i last watched the movie Titanic in cinema.
2931;I watched it again with James Cameron's commentory and it was really interesting.
2932;I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it when I finally saw it!
2933;Good old Leo, even though he IS 15 years my junior, was surprisingly appealing!
2934;All in all, I was pleased with the film, its music, and its actors, and am much more addicted to it than I ever thought I would be.
2935;The movie was very well done.
2936;There's a good reason why it was so successful in the theaters.
2937;If you've never seen this great epic of a film, you must be living under a rock somewhere or something.
2938;Hat's off to all the actors in this masterpiece!
2939;This is one of my all time favorite movies because my granddaughter watched it together when it first came upon the scene.
2940;Loved it then and still love it.
2941;A classic in my opinion.
2942;Leonard and Kate were amazing in this movie.
2943;I feel like this is one of those movies everyone should own.
2944;Loved it and would recommend.
2945;The love story between Jack and Rose is realistic and the way the sinking of Titanic was presented was in a very realistic and emotional way.
2946;Sure, the screenplay might not be first class , but the way the story draws the viewer in is truly stunning.
2947;I am very happy with it.
2948;it has many special features on it that make it worth it's asking price, beyond just the movie itself.
2949;Rose loved Jack with her whole life which is very touching.
2950;This was a truly touching book.
2951;my fellow reviewers have done a good job of getting the point across already.
2952;ray with lots of special features.
2953;infact I believeI will go home after this review and review this movie @ home again as my on treat.
2954;Great for any titanic enthusiast.
2955;Extended scenes as well as how the ship was made for the movie are great!
2956;What James Cameron's TITANIC proves once and for all is that, with the right creative team, you don't need tonnes of money to make a great picture.
2957;"The look of the film is amazing
I:30;2958;Still, the main reason for the picture's success is the adept handling of its love story"
2959;screen homage of THE LOVE BOAT as we are likely to get.
2960;This movie was hugely popular when first released, so there was definitely an audience for a sequel, (or two).
2961;Critics may argue otherwise, but moviegoers prefer a happy ending.
2962;It was very much undeserving of the numerous awards it won, and all the money that it made.
2963;(I was so happy when reading some editor's view in Parade Magazine that he thought it was embarrassing that it won 11 academy awards and that there are so many other movies out there that were good and better than this piece of garbage, but failed to get the attention that this nonsense got.)
2964;That DiCaprio guy is so overrated!
2965;The movie was not all that touching, heart.
2966;breaking, and awesome like the media make it out to be.
2967;Titanic was a great movie I would love to share with the young people in my life, except for the historically nonsensical and gratuitous nudity and the sex scene.
2968;Delete these and the whole family can enjoy this blockbuster together.
2969;Would that Hollywood could spot a trend and supply their own high.
2970;rated films for families (as they do for airlines and network television).
2971;well, to sum it up in one popular slogan: The ship sunk.
2972;The overall box set is very nice especially the reprints/news paper.
2973;But over all a very nice box set
2974;quickening action and a bit of period flavor.
2975;For the record, the sets are pleasantly authentic and so too are the costumes, so at least 2 of its Oscar statuettes are deserved, but it's difficult still not to see its US$200 million as extravagant overspending.
2976;It's endurable as a piece of narrative.
2977;The best parts of the film ironically are the action sequences which hark back to Cameron's progeny as an action director and the sinking of the ship, which is tantalisingly real.
2978;ending theme ad naseum at the end.
2979;I want to also see a retrospective.
2980;titanic is still one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.
2981;I wonder if they value their one.
2982;Titanic is a truly great film.
2983;They advertised this list with several pictures of several great films, including Titanic.
2984;Boy, did Titanic ever look appropriately placed among those equally great movies.
2985;As far as the screenplay complaints are concerned, what makes a great screenplay?
2986;If these naysayers can write me a better screenplay to fit perfectly with each and every scene shot in Titanic, I'll start to listen to those complaints.
2987;Until then, the film works perfectly with the dialogue that it has.
2988;struck, and instantly inspired by it.
2989;Titanic belonged in the top ten on their 100 greatest list.
2990;Everyone knows that Ridley Scott's films haven't exactly been all.
2991;Everyone knows that once great directors like De Palma need not be on that list.
2992;But when a filmmaker can put out good film after good film or in Cameron's case, great film after great film, there's always something they'll find to use against him.
2993;He's in the same lot as Alfred Hitchcock.
2994;The great James Cameron is a martar now!No.
2995;I want him to make great film after great film for many more years to come.
2996;titanic will most likely be remembered as his greatest achievement.
2997;style classic using the most money any production agency has ever put up, and worked tirelessly to be perfect.
2998;He pulls off the task wonderfully.
2999;Like GONE WITH THE WIND and CASABLANCA, TITANIC sets a beautiful human story against a cataclysmic backdrop to touch of universal emotions and timeless grace.
3000;They've become unforgettable characters (like, say for example Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, or Rick and whats her face).
3001;Personally, Titanic is my favorite movie.
3002;I appreciate James Cameron's dedication to detail and that the sinking sequence in the movie is almost in real time.
3003;It was really good .
3004;but liked the refurbished version.
3005;See the movie and then review it and the medium it is delivered on.
3006;The graphics and the picture of this movie make it worth the price.
3007;I gave this film 4 stars for its beautiful production values.
3008;I wish a good script came with the movie.
3009;While the script may have won an Oscar, it must be one of those great mysteries.
3010;No adult in this movie speaks at a higher level than your average 15 year old.
3011;So it comes out to a draw.
3012;There are also considerable added footage.
3013;Let's put it this way.
3014;Every other aspect is either good or excellent, from the movie score to the direction, the acting, and the special effects.
3015;What makes this movie good is the recreation of that particular historical atmosphere and tragedy.
3016;But a clich d story has to be well developed in all of its aspects, otherwise it allows the viewers to see the framework on which it is based, and that bombs the movie.
3017;But girl meets good and poor guy who opens her eyes on the beauty of life and changes her forever.
3018;"That makes ""Titanic"" a movie that I watched once and decided that it was enough."
3019;ray combo pack with four high.
3020;A beautiful movie about a tragic event.
3021;Great acting, story, special effects, and plot twists.
3022;The two leads are the greatest couple ever to grace the silver screen.
3023;I thought that Titanic was a meaningful, touching, and powerful story about two young lovers who find each other on the ill.
3024;"He makes that journey the best three days of her life, and gives her a reason to go on living once he dies in the icey waters
I:30;3025;I always find it funny how people bat such a critical eye to Titanic's love story, because in my mind, it's really no worse than the romantic/harlequin fluff that was popular before Easy Rider changed the game.
I:30;3026;ignore the love story and marvel at the stunning detail of this Titanic.
I:30;3027;The trick with those movies and with this one is that a Hollywood love story is about the swoon, the pageantry of emotions, the romance of circumstances, and all that other good stuff.
I:30;3028;With such a powerful subject as the Titanic, Cameron trumps it up in a fashion befitting the golden age of Hollywood.
I:30;3029;By deftly switching between personal and vast scenes of people facing death, we are constantly in touch of the scope of this tragedy.
I:30;3030;is it the greatest love story of all time?
I:30;3031;But, it's easily one of the best large.
I:30;3032;best movie of all time!!!!!!!!
I:30;3033;Leonardo is amazing and very cute.
I:30;3034;Kate was beautiful and great.
I:30;3035;I'll put in about 5 cents worth of advice here.
I:30;3036;Okay, it was a good.
I:30;3037;Finer films like Brazil, Saving Private Ryan, or Dancers In The Dark delved far deeper into the human soul than Titanic did!
I:30;3038;let's face it, it's about a modern.
I:30;3039;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:30;3040;The movie is so great.
I:30;3041;James Cameron wrote and directed a beautiful movie.
I:30;3042;The effects are amazing and great to watch but the love that is shown between Rose(Kate Winslet) and Jack(Leonardo DiCaprio) is so strong and it is unlike any movie that I have ever seen.
I:30;3043;The plot of the movie is so unique.
I:30;3044;There are so many more elements to the story than that.
I:30;3045;The whole cast is extraordinary which makes the movie so riveting.
I:30;3046;The movie will make you laugh,cry, and make you realize that love truly does conquer all.
I:30;3047;For those who survived the sinking, no doubt, had vivid, life.
I:30;3048;If feels real"
3049;"for example, you can feel the exhilaration and excitement as the ship steams out into the ocean for the first time
I:30;3050;As you watch the fictional romance develop between the free.
I:30;3051;spirited Jack Dawson and the blossoming Rose DeWitt Bukater and her falling.
I:30;3052;Indeed, the sea is as smooth as the tea in Smith's cup.
I:30;3053;the best features:""""Deleted Scenes"""" ."""
3054;see for lovers of the movie.
3055;A new, detailed reconstruction of Titanic's breakup, descent, and final disposition.
3056;This is a good movie, not a great one.
3057;this film is filled with lots of good actors in pathetic roles.
3058;Try making a good movie, and it might become a classic.
3059;the good thing about the movie was the final scene in the water.
3060;This was a marvelous job by DiCaprio and Winslet.
3061;The picture was very good though.
3062;I got this when it was first released on VHS (went to see it as well its opening night at our local theater) and it was played quite a bit.
3063;I loved this the first time I saw it and watched it a second and third time.
3064;The characters are so strong that I found it really emotional and engaging.
3065;a very well made film.
3066;but he's also King of the World's Most Overrated Movie (actually, I'd tie this with that atrocious sci.
3067;By watching this movie, you can easily tell it's from the man who brought us FX.
3068;heavy offerings like Aliens and Terminator 2, and the reason those movies succeeded is because the characterizations were up to snuff with the eye candy.
3069;The movie is simply fantastic.
3070;It is a heart moving love story.
3071;The graphics and the special effects are employed at their best.
3072;It is recommended that the movie be watched on the bigger screen.
3073;I hate to admit it, but I liked this movie.
3074;I still don't think it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture (I still think L. a. CONFIDENTIAL was far better), but I will go so far as to say it is an Oscar worthy picture.
3075;Despite the fact that the plot is cheesy and very predictable, James Cameron finds someway to put it all together and make it look good, and very entertaining.
3076;A good piece of entertainment?
3077;That means that I had to watch the screen every second.
3078;it also shows when you don't have money how to make the best of what you got.
3079;it shows as well how opposites attract like Jack and Rose.
3080;in the end I thought this movie is one of the best movies made in my life time.
3081;i rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!
3082;She is totally infatuated with it.
3083;this is a great to learn about the past and watch ever you want to watch and you have some fun watching it
3084;It definitely adds to the movie experience.
3085;the movie is a classic great for all ages if you havent seen titanic you are missing one of the greatest movies of all times
3086;I got this movie today!
3087;"I like every single part of it, especially when Rose and Jack were on the ship and Rose was ""flying""."
3088;Overall, I give this Award Winning Film 5 more stars!
3089;So myself and the two kids popped along .
3090;The sheer spectacle of what came next has prompted me to write this review.
3091;It's incredible and at times I was genuinely gobsmacked.
3092;at times you feel you could reach out and actually touch them.
3093;"their size and power
I:30;3094;Even something as unassuming as Molly Brown's decorative hat as she talks to Jack (at a later dinner table setting) now reaches out of the screen into the aisles with extraordinary depth.
I:30;3095;Winslet's costumes are glorious too .
I:30;3096;her radiant eyes and lustrous hair.
I:30;3097;The feeling of sea air and wind on the ship's gangways when Rose and Jack walk and talk and discuss art is accentuated .
I:30;3098;wise (usually the one talking) .
I:30;3099;what you also forget is what an incredible movie """"Titanic"""" is."""
3100;"Like that other maverick filmmaker Ridley Scott (""Blade Runner"", ""Gladiator"" and ""The Kingdom Of Heaven"") ."
3101;He brings it to the screen with bravado and a passion for 'detail' that few have matched.
3102;it seems like he's worked everything to give you the viewer as much as possible .
3103;the horror and heartbreak still has the power to make your heart race and bring a tear to the eye.
3104;cameron's version of the sad tale has heart too .
3105;Bill Paxton as the obsessed present.
3106;servant, Bernard Hill as the overwhelmed and ill.
3107;but the movie belongs to its two young leads .
3108;She is sensational in the role .
3109;She also exudes an acting confidence that is staggering for a 21.
3110;It's a feast of detail.
3111;My kids are 18 and 14 .
3112;that was a great film Dad.
3113;I could see it in his young face .
3114;he was genuinely moved by what he'd just seen.
3115;Product was in excellent shape.
3116;the extra added scenes makes this more appealing.
3117;doesnt work out so well for the people on it.
3118;but the movie is good
3119;The movie had incredible visual effects and really pulled the audience into the tragic events building up to the sinking of the Titanic.
3120;The real emotional impact came from the love shown by the man on the deck of the ship saying good.
3121;All of these visuals made a deep and lasting impression on me of the true love that people share for one another.
3122;This was a good, but not a great movie.
3123;Titanic is one of the few 'chick flicks' love stories that I really enjoy watching, and back then when it was first released, it was spectacular.
3124;The story is beautiful, emotional, thrilling, and heart wrenching at the same time.
3125;d experience of a lifetime.
3126;The picture clarity has gone beyond 'clear'.
3127;It is now something beyond that, the picture is FLAWLESS.
3128;The sound is also incredibly immersive.
3129;Seems to be genuinely theatre style.
3130;the story itself is just truly an experience to have to watch.
3131;We are fascinated by death and this movie is a very realistic portrayal of death on a catastrophic scale.
3132;Titanic has to be the best movie in the world.
3133;Titanic won 11 Academy Awards, including best director.
3134;James Cameron did an amazing job of recreating Titanic, as well as splicing in footage from Robert Ballard's expedition in 1986 which discovered the Titanic wreck.
3135;Leo and Kate do an amazing job as Jack and Rose.
3136;Be forewarned that this movie has a very powerful, moving ending.
3137;Im a big movie fan and collect movies as a hobbie and i have to say this is the best movie ever made.
3138;i truely think this is the best movie of all time!
3139;kate winslet did a wonderful perfomence in this movie!
3140;what makes this movie sooooooo good is the fact that it is like two movies in one.
3141;but this special edition has all the speacial features you could ever want.
3142;take my word for it this movie is really good.
3143;it won lots of Academy awards and was a kiling at the box office so if you love movies like me this is a keeper!!!!!
3144;I love the story line and the special effects are alsome.
3145;Still makes me cry to watch it, love the actors and the romance.
3146;Leo is cute and humble an awesome artist and his honesty to his red haired girl breaks my heart.
3147;She has a loser lover in the dark haired man.
3148;a great movie, I have to sit and watch the entire movie when I find that block of time.
3149;I forgot the ending, maybe I need some Kleenex.
3150;This is an awesome movie.
3151;It is one of my favorite movies of all times.
3152;unusually for Hollywood, it seems to be historically accurate, too.
3153;there's outstanding performances from Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet in a lovely love story.
3154;The main villain of this piece is the class system, but the minor ones are believable and accordingly, hateful.
3155;Titanic still holds fascination with people today, movie brings the whole thing to life, with a nice story too.
3156;One of the classical great films brought to life in yur very living room.
3157;Just for sheer effort this movie deserves five stars.
3158;though the purists and critics may split hairs and nitpick about the various performances it is still a magnificent recreation of one of the most tragic and historical events this century,excluding both world wars.
3159;for me their chemistry on screen was believable and worked well.
3160;James Cameron you deserved that bonus.
3161;"Great transfer, great audio, I personally don't care about ""extras"" that much however."
3162;this movie has to be one of the best of all times!
3163;Romantic, factual, and yet adventerous.
3164;it was like you were really there watching Jack and Rose's every move.
3165;This three hour movie is excellent!!!
3166;And the second part, great effects, great stunts and very INTENSe!!!
3167;This movie is two thumbs way up!
3168;If you want a real movie worthy of that much oscars, watch one of the best movies ever: Ben.
3169;I thought this was a great movie.
3170;Winslet and DiCaprio are phenomenal as the leads of the movie and the special effects are outstanding.
3171;Overall a good choice and will probably be considered a classic one day.
3172;This movie is absolutely fabulous (although I saw it on MoreMax).
3173;The scenery was shockingly realistic, the roles were acted to perfection, and the romance between the fictional Jack and Rose seemed like a real tragic love story aboard the Titanic.
3174;Worth paying the thirty dollars to get the VCR version.
3175;She loved it and it's a good movie.
3176;This was a very good film.
3177;I saw the preview for the movie and I thought it had been told already.
3178;The truth is that it was very well told.
3179;Leo Dicaprio did an incredible job of playing the poor boy named Jack Doson.
3180;Anyway, this movie, although the story of Titanic was already told thousand times over is a good movie.
3181;My favorite part of the movie is the part on the Bow, although there have been jokes about that seen it was one of the most beautiful scenes in the entire movie.
3182;This is the most expensive movie, highest grossing movie, most critically acclaimed, and most award.
3183;You know how one day, at a certain age in your life, you see this REALLY great film and it just haunts your mind for days on end?And then, you turn back and see it again, and instead of thinking it was great, you could picture it on the next episode of Mystery.
3184;I just have to say, I was seriously hooked into this film and hypnotized by the freakin' Enya.
3185;And I must have seriously been on something when I thought that Kate and Leo were really, really good.
3186;James, all I have to say is suck it up.
3187;This is the best film ever made.
3188;Unlike Pearl Harbor, the love story in this picture works, mainly because of the two talented leading actors.
3189;And the movie as a whole is very good, extremely entertaining and heatbreaking in the end.
3190;Not to mention the technical aspects of the film, which are simply brilliant.
3191;and private ryan didn't even win best picture, when it is possibly THE most realistic movie, if not time period movie ever made!
3192;It is not one that has pop out features but the depth is great.
3193;ray and loved watching again.
3194;i thought that the romance between Rose (Kate Winslet)and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a true story.
3195;I liked how James Cameron made up the story.
3196;leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet did a good job too.
3197;my favorite part was almost at the end.
3198;This story was so romantic.
3199;I recommend this movie to teenagers because I liked the movie and I think that they are going to liked it too.
3200;I will rate the blu.
3201;The AQ is more vibrant.
3202;Good business I paid for what I wanted and they sent it in that manner!
3203;A brilliant adaptation of 2 fictional characters (Winslet and De Caprio) who fall in love on the maiden voyage of the Titanic.
3204;James Horner's score SOARS throughout the movie.
3205;This movie show cases brillant acting, stunts, sets, visual effects and much more eye candy!
3206;Thats how much depth it has to it.
3207;ass, poor lass and smart.
3208;It sets up a modern day crew that is after the glory and fortune associated with being able to excavate Titanic, a sunken luxury liner.
3209;They have needs and goals and, eventually, change.
3210;Jack and Rose are flawless youngsters who stand in defiance of old world fogies.
3211;in conclusion, a period piece often features lavish costumes and music and makeup and more often than not it is in an effort to create a distinct time and place .
3212;one that matches the way the characters feel and think and act.
3213;the costuming and music and makeup may be nice but it's all for naught .
3214;wise is directly related to what she has seen.
3215;You get a pretty average trailer, and that's it!
3216;i absolutely adore this movie.
3217;The whole relationship between Jack Rose (a relationship which has been copied in many other movies about the Titanic) is so sweet, although they may seem in love, Rose only says it to Jack once and that's when they're both in the water.
3218;When Jack draws Kate, it's actually James Cameron's hands.
3219;what a scary thought!This is a terrific movie.
3220;But it's the whole romance about it, and the whole history of it.
3221;I didn't go to the theater to see it because it was too long, but I knew I did want to see it one day.
3222;After over a decade, this movie is still rated as one of my favorites.
3223;hard, then the 10th Anniversary, 2 disc Edition will probably be a good investment.
3224;Until then, though, this is a phenomenal set to own.
3225;It has so much stuff to watch on it, including the making of the whole movie and deleted scenes.
3226;If you're a Titanic fanatic then this is the thing for you!
3227;Titanic was a great hit movie when it first came out.
3228;The movie made millions of dollars.
3229;Titanic was one of my favorite movies because it is based on a true story.
3230;In the movie, they focus on a certain family.
3231;I give this movie 5 stars.
3232;It is really intense movie and a very sad movie.
3233;I watched it several times when it first came to the theaters, and I still tear up everytime I see it.
3234;This is the perfect set to commemorate the 100th anniversay of the Tiatic this year.
3235;Definitely recommend this to others.
3236;We give it two thumbs up for fantastic entertainment.
3237;WagnerEnglish 608 December 2013LabTitanic is one of my favorite movies.
3238;Every time I watch it I find something new and something interesting that I didnt see the time before.
3239;One of my top favorite moments in the movie is when Jack Dawson sees Rose for the first time.
3240;The way he looks at her seems so real and he looks so mesmerized by her.
3241;My favorite character in this movie is definitely Jack Dawson.
3242;He stands up for what he believes in because nobody is holding him back.
3243;His art work makes him who he is, because he has seen so many women and know what real women are with real money.
3244;Another favorite scene of mine is when Rose is having tea with her mother and the other ladies.
3245;Another scene I like is when Jack is invited to dinner with the high class people and once the dinner is over Jack invites Rose to a real party.
3246;I love this part because it just shows that being rich and having class isnt always fun.
3247;You can tell she had fun because there was no one there telling her how to act, how to eat, stand, walk and so on.
3248;She just enjoyed her time with the rest of the people without thinking about it.
3249;Titanic has to be one of my favorite movies of all time.
3250;For the first time my two kids watched it with me and they totally loved it too, at 6 and 7 Years the loved every minute of it.
3251;My son loved the part where it broke a part and sunk and my daughter loved when Rose who was telling the story threw the diamond necklace in the ocean on the end.
3252;I saw this film in the theater, and it was o. k.
3253;It's a friggin' Gilbert and Sullivan opera.
3254;But I am rich after all!
3255;"and please, can they release a version of the movie without Celine Dion?If you Really liked this film, you will probably enjoy watching Mission to Mars, City of Angels, and Bloodsucking Freaks 
I:30;3256;grossing film ever to be released.
I:30;3257;The story is great, so are the special effects.
I:30;3258;I cannmot believe Leonarndo DiCaprio nor Kate Hudson won an Academy Award for their roles.
I:30;3259;This is the best movie to be made.
I:30;3260;i bought this movie for my kid.
I:30;3261;FOr heaven's sake, best love story?
I:30;3262;If I were the car's owner where the disgusting love scene happens I will be happy that the Titanic remained under the water.
I:30;3263;union),yet director James Cameron has succeeded in creating one of the true """"Hollywood"""" entertainments of the past decade, a film which will become part of the human mythology as films such as """"Gone With the Wind"""" and """"The Sound of Music"""" have done."""
3264;the 2 disc, 3 disc or 4 disc version, a wealth of fascinating and sometimes amusing extras.
3265;"It's next to ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Phantom of the Opera"" my favorite movie."
3266;It's such a beautiful movie.
3267;Leo and Kate did an amazing job.
3268;I love it and will always love it.
3269;Two people who are now acclaimed actor's in their own right got started in their roles, Kate Winslett and Leonard DiCaprio.
3270;I recommend this movie for it's wealth of visual and auditory treats.
3271;Titanic is a major footnote in the history of both America and Great Britain.
3272;Usually I get my movies in a box and they are well protected.
3273;You guys have been great in the past but I noticed this with a couple of movies I have ordered.
3274;Romantic, exciting, great and easy story to follow all set during a historical event.
3275;Great for those looking to place themselves into the lives of those who lived through this great disaster.
3276;There are two ways to look at Titanic.
3277;like it or not Titanic was a brilliant movie visually, and it had a story about risk and making your own way in the world which people could actually relate to.
3278;James Horner deserves kudos for an outstanding musical score as well.
3279;Kate Winslett and Gloria Stuart were both deserving of their Oscar nominations.
3280;Villians are at their most interesting when they are complex characters all to themselves.
3281;Fair price, good product, fair shipping.
3282;I saw it once, and that was enough.
3283;"Titanic was disposable
I:30;3284;Great movie full of action and romance.
I:30;3285;Excellant acting by the supporting actresses and actors.
I:30;3286;Would have improved the film greatly.
I:30;3287;He was one of the crew.
I:30;3288;James Cameron's epic film about the ill.
I:30;3289;i would say one of the best movies ever made
I:30;3290;Anyway, I really enjoyed watching the movie.
I:30;3291;It was so breathtaking, so touching, so sad when Jack died.
I:30;3292;There are a LOT of extras in this set"
3293;If nothing else, Titanic is an excellent example of James Cameron filmmaking in action.
3294;In Terminator II , he blows up a whole perfectly good office building.
3295;And in Titanic , he creates a multi.
3296;as long as the resulting film is as good as Titanic .
3297;this film has a great story to tell, and tells it spectacularly, with a suprisingly human center.
3298;and the sinking itself is harrowing, spectacular and beautifully done, as it should be with a $200 million budget.
3299;Titanic is all around the best movie ever made.
3300;It has a love story, historical significance, tragedy and much more.
3301;A little lengthy but still the best.
3302;There is my opinion of this so called award winning movie.
3303;A tremendous, magnificent and very touching film
3304;The special features, including the deleted scenes, are on the two Blu.
3305;You get to see the personalities of each of them, Leo as the adventure seeking good guy, Billy as the pompous arrogant bad guy, and Kate as the uncertain but later passionate and fun loving lady.
3306;This film has realistic action sequences, an impactful storyline, and is heavy on the romance.
3307;The movie is rather long, but it is very involving and time will fly by.
3308;This is the top grossing film of all time, and has won 11 Oscars including Best Picture.
3309;Got this for a present for my grandmother after she enjoyed a trip to the Titanic museum.
3310;"The story seems fictitious with Jack and Rose
I:30;3311;But if you look at the event when the Titanic sinks, it will touch your heart and make you cry.
I:30;3312;so far it has made me.
I:30;3313;i loved when the Irish aboard had their party.
I:30;3314;the music is pretty and still could make you cry.
I:30;3315;i know it so far has made me.
I:30;3316;I think this set is absolutely awesome.
I:30;3317;As wonderful as it is, I still have to say that it hacks me off just a bit to have the feature film split in half over two of the three discs.
I:30;3318;Anyway, the set is great for the extras alone and I am excited that they have finally given this movie the treatment is deserves.
I:30;3319;It could have been really wonderful with such an ingenious idea.
I:30;3320;Instead it is simply an exceptionally well made, but run.
I:30;3321;The whole thing was real!
I:30;3322;This was a real story!
I:30;3323;I love this movie for its wonderful blend of storytelling, realism, and great special effects.
I:30;3324;This is a movie I would recommend and is a wonderful tribute to this historic tragedy.
I:30;3325;This was a love story to end ALL love stories,for the many of you who think that it is childish love, first class women had a 9/10 chance of surviving, and Rose gave that up to be with the one she loved.
I:30;3326;She did a helluva job here and believable as well .
I:30;3327;i am happy to say that I was lucky enought to visit the exhibit here in Phila.
I:30;3328;I believe that Titanic truly is a theatrical masterpiece.
I:30;3329;The intesnse love affair of Jack ( the very nice Leo Di caprio) and Rose ( Kate winslet) is amazingly acted, and really touched me.
I:30;3330;the ending, and the entire film for that matter, literally has me in tears every time, and it takes a lot for a film to affect me like that.
I:30;3331;The plot is very well thought out, although you can kind of tell its going to hit an iceberg what with all the warnings, but nothing can ruin this film, its truly amazing.
I:30;3332;Titanic is the best flm ever made, and always will be.
I:30;3333;I remember seeing this film in the theatre as a young teenager and being fascinated by the event.
I:30;3334;James Cameron defenitley shows his prowess as a director with this film the camera moves and the angles he uses during the sinking are unconventional and in my opinion he deserved the oscar that he got for the film.
I:30;3335;Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet have both matured as performers since this film but they were both believable and had a great on screen chemistry.
I:30;3336;I think that this is a great epic film and needs to be seen by everyone so that the legacy of the Titanic will never be lost.
I:30;3337;Obviously a superb and classic movie, but it wasn't quite as good as I expected in Blu Ray.
I:30;3338;This was an excellent portryal of a fictional love story that took place on an actual disaster.
I:30;3339;It had a great soundtrack and the orchestral background was strong, just like classic James Horner.
I:30;3340;He's a terrible actor, and somebody else could have done a lot more with such a wonderful part in the film.
I:30;3341;This script is as highly polished as the floor Cal Hockley slid upon as he chased Rose and Jack through the sinking ship.
I:30;3342;dropping scene, every moment of joy, love, terror, every smile, frown, wince, lip.
I:30;3343;So this is in defense of a great script and that part of it subject to the most undue criticism, the perfectly formed love story.
I:30;3344;It reflects a change of mood.
I:30;3345;four years separating the stories of young and old Rose.
I:30;3346;It always has a function in a script.
I:30;3347;It's a dramatic device specifically chosen and precisely timed by the writer.
I:30;3348;Rose has to move on and we have to let her, as though we are steering the script with our expectations.
I:30;3349;The dastardly villain might seem a cheap device, but for me it works exceptionally well in Titanic.
I:30;3350;but if you have at least one romantic bone in your body, you have to have some appreciation for this incredible piece.
I:30;3351;But what better way to bring you to that time in history than a love story so brilliantly carried by Kate Winslet, one of the better more true actresses of our time and such incredible direction from many talented people.
I:30;3352;Even my father, who HATES epic long films, was shocked at how much he enjoyed watching it at least once.
I:30;3353;This movie being so popular sends a message to Hollywood"
3354;They did the best they could with what they had.
3355;This is one of the most sucessful films of the year.
3356;All through 1997 and 98, everyone was talking Titanic, and it's easy to see why.
3357;the special effects for this movie were top.
3358;rate, as was the music and acting.
3359;"Visually, the movie (NOT ""film""!)"
3360;is gorgeous, the actors are gorgeous, the costumes are gorgeous, the sets are gorgeous .
3361;"the danger of this kind of movie, I think, is that it PURPORTS to be a ""great"" work of cinema
I:30;3362;what great cinema truly IS.
I:30;3363;epic, and enjoy without guilt, because there really is plenty to enjoy .
I:30;3364;**And then go watch a GREAT film, just for balance (or to kick.
I:30;3365;Ok, I FINALLY found a Blu.
I:30;3366;ray that works with my recent laptop, an HP Pro.
I:30;3367;this was a whole weekend process.
I:30;3368;I LOVE extras, btw, for the most part.
I:30;3369;And a little child shall lead them: I finally said, it's a store, let's find something this film works with and use that program.
I:30;3370;The gentle clinking on China in the water.
I:30;3371;Molly Brown rowing made me laugh.
I:30;3372;Fabrizio and Helga"
3373;Celine's vibrato, well, that's a real singer, and Auto.
3374;i think the Horner song in stunning with a real piano.
3375;lots of stuff that was cut is rightfully cut, but much is still very moving.
3376;It's still all stunning in terms of cinematography and sound design as well as FX.
3377;The feelings scared me at first, but now I see so much more.
3378;it's why we all came here to this life.
3379;I loved crying from one end to the other, and it's not my habit at all.
3380;I felt more alive, closer to God.
3381;All those who suffered on such a gorgeous ship.
3382;knew us, and loved that we cared, even a hundred years after they died.
3383;release, please treat us right!I have listened to both sound formats along with lot of other people and I believe that almost everybody will say that DTS sound is the way to go.
3384;Dolby 5.1 is good but DTS is outstanding.
3385;I highly recommend it to anyone that loved the film.
3386;Have always loved this movie!
3387;I still waiver on the whole 3.
3388;"I have seen some films where it looks great and gives added depth and dimension to the film and the story (Cameron's own ""Avatar"" may be the best example)."
3389;Is it worth the extra $3?
3390;Director, writer and producer James Cameron solidifies his place in film history with this masterpiece.
3391;It is a rare film where we know the outcome, so Cameron must give credence to the sinking of the ship itself.
3392;It must look real, and it does.
3393;in a terrific performance, veteran actress Gloria Stuart as elderly Rose narrates much of the film for us and the crew of the treasure hunters.
3394;Skillful writing to be sure.
3395;This section is a technological achievement of the first order.
3396;Various characters in the story become more human with their actions.
3397;Some positive, some not, but all believable.
3398;Cameron also hired James Horner who provides a memorable musical score and even Celine Dion's overplayed song is perfectly placed over the ending credits.
3399;"In the end, ""Titanic"" is a great love story, brief though it is."
3400;This is a film that focuses on grandeur and the Blu ray in either dimension looks great.
3401;Likewise the audio is special.
3402;scenes Featurettes and a Digital Copy.
3403;The talent demonstrated by both DiCaprio and Winslett is beyond comparrison.
3404;Subsequently I have seen all of DiCaprio's dramatic films and I am impressed beyond belief at the talent and range of emotions this man has.
3405;winslett in Heavenly Creatures was wonderful.
3406;But Titanic will always have a special place in my heart.
3407;I was amazed that I liked Titanic as much as I did.
3408;And the attention to detail in Cameron's neverending effort to replicate the Titanic above as well below water was tremendous.
3409;What made the storyline a bit more plausible, was the tremendous acting of both Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio.
3410;Winslet breathes life into Rose DeWitt Bukater, making us believe that she is the tortured and troublesome soul that she is.
3411;DiCaprio is comfortable as the easygoing, tumbleweed in the wind Jack Dawson.
3412;The unforgettable scene of dead, frozen people in the ocean after the mighty ship has gone down is one that stays with you, well after the movie is over.
3413;Cameron does well at the end of the movie to insure that the audience will better understand the motivations of Bill Paxton's modern day pirate character and that of Old Rose played very well by Gloria Stuart.
3414;I also enjoyed how Cameron leaves one guessing at the end of the movie.
3415;Look past that, and you'll be fine.
3416;Very well acted and great job on special affects
3417;My 11 yo daughter loved it.
3418;Movie brought it to life for her.
3419;i love it because it's so moving.
3420;And had children and grandchildren and got married.
3421;and I loved the acting.
3422;All my friends advised me to fastforward the first hour and enjoy the action at the end.
3423;Actually I rather enjoyed the love intrigue section (Kate Winslet is wonderful), and found myself yawning towards the end.
3424;Visually this is a fantastic film.
3425;I was surprised because James Cameron usually delivers the goods when it comes to a thrilling cinema experience.
3426;Still, a lot of people , mostly teenage girls, really liked it so you'll have to make your own mind up.
3427;Always prefer A NIGHT TO REMEMBER as THE Titanic story.
3428;Funny, after witnessing this spectacular blu ray (in 2D) I have a better appreciation for this Academy Award winner.
3429;Paramount has done one fantastic restoration of this film.
3430;The detail is astounding as it should be!
3431;This is just another format and thankfully it makes this movie look its best.
3432;Any great movie depends on the story, any story depends on the teller.
3433;Anyhow, this is a film for the ages crafted, well thought out, with excellent acting, costumes, computer animation and wonderful direction.
3434;ray, and was very impressed.
3435;The picture is wonderful, and the audio captures the music, sounds of the sea, and dialogue of the characters in a outstanding manner.
3436;"A treat for lovers of ""titanic""."
3437;the story speaks for it's self so just know that the extras make this a joy to have and even more of a treat than it was already.
3438;I loved this movie ever since it came out the first time on VHS.
3439;Titanic is STILL (after all these years) one of my favorite movies.
3440;The attention to historical detail, and accuracy is where I really give James Cameron two thumbs up!
3441;Even the actors in the film actually LOOKED like some of the REAL historical figures on that ship!
3442;I literally cried during some of the end parts of this movie.
3443;LEt's face it, this movie touched lives.
3444;The restoration/cleanup is fantastic, and the sound is equally dazzling.
3445;"The 2nd new documentary is ""Titanic: The Final Word"", which is a very interesting and informative re."
3446;IT's been my favorite film for the past 15 years!
3447;I love it and I love Titanic!!!
3448;I LOVED this movie I saw it in theatres 2wice and have viewed it numerous times on Video.
3449;Great production, excellent costumes and SUCH attention to detail.
3450;This is one of those once in a lifetime movies everyone must watch!
3451;Come on Hollywood, give the public what they want!
3452;'Titanic' brought the blockbuster into the 90's.
3453;fi and horror flicks, it was nice to see a really traditional movie.
3454;stunning special effects, an involving love story, a sorrowful (and now infamous) ending mixed with fact.
3455;This is a movie aimed at pleasing everyone and it shows.
3456;budget or intelligent movies .
3457;Although none of them are quite as good as the roles they played in the aforementioned films, they still make good value for money.
3458;worthy romance of the story, even though there were some idiotic scenes (the spitting? )
3459;The visual effects are eye popping, and the direction is magnificent.
3460;You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll hurl, you'll forget about it in three months.
3461;Titanic is an easy Target for smartalecs and cynics everywhere.
3462;Having just seen the film for the fifth time on cable(can't stop watching when it comes on), I truly believe this to be a great film.
3463;You can mock the dialogue and its lack of sophistication and irony, but you can never deny the beauty of the whole.
3464;The scene in which Rose walks out to Jack on the tip of the ship, he holds her, spreads her arms and sings Come to me Josephine has got to be the most romantic moment in modern movies.
3465;The movie was good, but the video kept cutting out.
3466;So, this movie has to be one of my favorites!
3467;But, the special features of this edition were superior.
3468;His cast, crew, and technicians crafted a beautiful and riveting movie blending fact and fiction.
3469;Titanic is a great movie, don't get me wrong.
3470;titanic has its pros and cons.
3471;Whoever came up with that deserves serious recognition.
3472;The beginning, in the present, is my third favorite part.
3473;I'd give the overall way the music ties in and works with the story 4.4 1/2 stars.
3474;:) He may not be the very best actor ever, but he's one of the cute ones!
3475;The love story between Jack and Rose was well done.
3476;And the music was, as I said, great.6.
3477;She reaches the top and there's Jack, waiting to kiss her.
3478;I bawled my eyes out.
3479;The scene was still great.7.
3480;But the rest of the movie pretty much makes up for it.
3481;the bundle is a great idea 5 stars for that.
3482;the movie is great 5 stars for that.
3483;This movies lives up to the hype and is a fine example of how to tell a story.
3484;This elegy for the simple.
3485;To capture the beauty, exuberance, optimism and hope of Titanic, her passengers and crew and, in the process of baring the dark side of humanity underlying this tragedy, celebrate the limitless potential of the human spirit.
3486;a myth, a parable, a metaphor for the ills of mankind.
3487;It is also a story of faith, courage, sacrifice and, above all else, love.
3488;"james Cameron's ""Titanic"" is an epic, action."
3489;packed romance set against the ill.
3490;fated maiden voyage of the R. m. s. Titanic, the pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the time, the largest moving object ever built.
3491;An ambitious fortune hunter (Bill Paxton) is determined to plumb the treasures of this once.
3492;spirited young steerage passenger named Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio).
3493;Once he opens her eyes to the world that lies outside her gilded cage, Rose and Jack's forbidden love begins a powerful mystery that ultimately echoes across the years into the present.
3494;Oscar winner Kathy Bates is featured as the ship's most colorful real.
3495;Rae Sanchini is executive producer.
3496;Titanic I have seen it 28times what more can i say from its sweeping love story with the stunning effects as the backdrop have made this film the biggest ever i will always hold it in my heart.
3497;I just hope to see the Cut Version on Special Edition Soon.
3498;as this would truely complete the cinematic masterpiece.
3499;And so, we come to the most successful film of all time.
3500;stripped of the impact that the undoubtedly wonderful special effects had on the big screen, you can really see the film for what it is.
3501;Of course all the Brits are evil, as they always are, and all the Irish are fun loving, as usual, and the Latin American character is, naturally, hot tempered.
3502;i know, i will be in the minority with this view, and that there are those, less cynical than me, who will marvel in a tale of romance and intrigue, and i can understand that.
3503;But with so much brilliant cinema out there i wouldn't waste anymore of your life than is neccessary.
3504;"In November the whole Europe, as well as Asia, will receive ""Titanic"" in a version that truly deserves the name of an ""ultimate edition"" ."
3505;In just a month it is going to arrive.
3506;A tragedy as monumental and as riveting as the sinking of RMS Titanic could have stood very well on its own without being buried in a cloying soap opera.
3507;I thought I was watching The Perils of Jack and Rose.
3508;life passengers we see here were so greatly diminished.
3509;i give this movie two stars, one for the special effects and one for the costumes.
3510;The story line was great!
3511;The chemistry between Leo and Kate was phenomenal.
3512;What makes it more interesting is that Titanic was based on a true story.
3513;I love this film and bought this 3 disc edition from a retail store in India.
3514;The best part is I bought it (NEW) for Rs.799.00 that is equivalent to $17.2087 (USD).
3515;The fact that I can see this movie in blu.
3516;I went to go see the movie when it was in theaters and fell in love with this classic all over again.
3517;This is the best movie ever!!
3518;The acting is great and the lovestory between Rose and Jack is beautiful!Kate Winslet is great and she looks stunning in the movie!
3519;James Cameron directs a very good movie, on a situation that will be remembered until the end of time.
3520;This movie has everything, if you're into romance it has it, if you are into suspense it has it.
3521;Plus the acting in it is very good.
3522;It was a fantastic movie, in fact, one of the best movies I've ever seen.
3523;James Cameron is a genius.
3524;I love this movie and shipping was fast!
3525;I like that my product got here in 4 days or less, and it works really good when watching the movies.
3526;Once again, James Cameron astounds us with awesome special effects, a wonderful script, and a touching love story centered around a historical tragedy.
3527;This was by far the best love story I have seen and it also has the best ending EVER in a movie!
3528;It's definitely worth sitting three and a half hours and it's definitely worth adding to your video collection.
3529;Loved this product, bought it as a gift for a friend which she loved and the price was good, thanks
3530;Lots of scenes are just looking as if it is in normal picture.
3531;ray version is very good, the colors are so vivid and it really looks High Definition.
3532;Received the product on time and in good condition.
3533;The condition ordered was 'Like New' and it definitely did not come in that way.
3534;The film itself was so bright and crisp it was like I was watching the movie for the first time.
3535;Love Story meets The Poseidon Adventure as two star.
3536;There's nothing wrong with telling a love story against the background of a real.
3537;"That's what Margaret Mitchell did with ""Gone with the Wind"", one of the most successful films ever made from a huge best."
3538;Cameron's achievement here is undeniable, despite some of the negative responses.
3539;Titanic is an extremely impressive movie from every standpoint in recreating an actual ship disaster that took more than a thousand lives.
3540;but also draws in a number of other characters that are equally well integrated into the plot, adding to the intrigue and conflict.
3541;the class distinction that existed then (and now) is shown with clarity.
3542;The snobbery was there and is most fully exposed in the depiction of Rose's class.
3543;tITANIC will go down as one of the greatest recreations of an actual event ever attempted on screen.
3544;The performances, from leads to bit players, are uniformly excellent.
3545;He's the perfect villain and plays his juicy role with incredible skill and zest.
3546;David Warner is another first class villain and he's excellent, as is Gloria Stuart (as old Rose) and Bill Paxton.
3547;the Jack/Rose love affair is played with considerable skill by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, putting emphasis on the class distinction that played a large part in this human tragedy.
3548;the technical credits are beyond reproach with a standout recreation of the famous ship itself, and James Horner's score adds immeasurably to the film's poignancy and drama.
3549;summing up: A voyage to remember for the ages.
3550;And he was simply spectacular in this classic!
3551;I am so glad I bought this product!
3552;It's got so much information on the making of the movie and behind the scenes coverage.You will feel like you are there, on the set with these actors.
3553;This is a great set, lots of extras, but one major drawback.
3554;titanic is a good love story, epic historical tale and there are tons of extras, commentaries, etc etc.
3555;James Cameron is best known for directing such action slash science fiction classics as The Terminator (1984) and Aliens (1986).
3556;It is a change of pace which works, albeit it not completely.
3557;the story of the Titanic is a very familiar one and has developed its own mythology.
3558;The film is at it best when it is concentrating upon the recreation of the microcosm ofEdwardian society that Titanic was and the actual sinking of the boat.
3559;He also manages to convey the sheer terror the people must have felt as the shipsank.
3560;the performances are merely adequate though Warner as Cal's villainous henchmen gives an enjoyable performance.
3561;They are mostly excellent though somehave aged badly.
3562;Beautifully filmed, funny, and well.
3563;acted, this film features the story of the Titanic through the eyes of young lovers.
3564;It's a love story first and an affecting tragedy film in the second instance.
3565;i saw this in the movies with my wife back in 1997 and wow what a surprise.
3566;this movie was right up my alley like if they made it for me.
3567;a real awesome awesome flick.
3568;i thank you all for reading this.
3569;Titanic is an epic romantic drama film.
3570;whilst there have been several adaptations of the Titanic sinking, this is a story of young and eternal love.
3571;this movie has contributed to a popular and lasting legacy of the Titanic's 1912 maiden voyage, and treats the viewer to vivid and poignant distinctiveness of the event, which honours the tragedy.
3572;Fact is, this is the greatest movie ever made.
3573;In fact, most successful movies gross around 200 million, this grossed 10 times that amount!
3574;People around the world were captivated by it.
3575;People in Europe and in Japan waited hours in line to see it!
3576;James Cameron has done something incredible.
3577;telling to create a piece of art, a universal expression of human nature.
3578;And yet, through the story of love, people survive.
3579;And in death, Rose finds that the afterlife is a reflection of this life .
3580;Titanic is a much deeper and complex tale then most viewers realize.
3581;Those who don't get it need to see it again and really THINK about it.
3582;James Cameron's masterpiece is well worth watching, rewatching, and owning.
3583;i wonder however what special features will be on these new releases?
3584;Titanic is one of those movies that I dig up from the bottom of my VHS collection once or twice a year and always enjoy watching it.
3585;And all this after Jack's vivid description of the effects of ice cold water in the beginning of the movie.
3586;The acting was okay, as the Oscars proved, but what I liked the most were the special effects.
3587;"It was such a beautiful movie
I:30;3588;I actually bought this when it was new in the store .
I:30;3589;it was about $30 or so but it was so worth the money!
I:30;3590;It's PERFECT for both movie lovers and Titanic lovers!
I:30;3591;It's a classic and worth watching .
I:30;3592;it was like it was right in front of me!
I:30;3593;it's great and I can't say anything bad.
I:30;3594;Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are amazing together
I:30;3595;This has to be one of the most well.
I:30;3596;With a classic story line, it could have been much cheesier than it was.
I:30;3597;There's good reason for that .
I:30;3598;In a nutshell, penniless artist, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a third class ticket on the ill.
I:30;3599;no one has more admiration for Cameron's attention to detail in sets and costumes and his epic staging of the climactic sinking of the great leviathan into the icy Atlantic, than I do.
I:30;3600;Truly, """"Titanic"""" had more fascinating real life passengers on board, whose lives could have been more fully explored."""
3601;Though colors are fairly represented and clarity and sharpness are amply present, there's a considerable amount of edge enhancement in the vertical paneling of the smoking room, the railing that surrounds the ship and many of the long shots of the ship sailing off into the sunset.
3602;Contrast levels are nicely balanced.
3603;Some film grain and digital grain make certain scenes break apart when viewed on a larger format.
3604;The audio is 5.1 stereo and provides a very strong and visceral listening experience.
3605;It is excellent, a masterpiece.
3606;There's action, tons of drama, love, and historical details overflowing this movie making it so wonderful.
3607;I would deffinetly recommend it to anyone.
3608;And I love how everyone now acts like they hated this over.
3609;The detail, the music, and even the sappy love story.
3610;Kate Winlet and Leo have both gone on to be very good actors.
3611;But still a captivating piece of work.
3612;The detail Cameron put into this movie is fantastic.
3613;Jack and Rose had a love, although short.
3614;3 stars for the acting, 4 for the overall special effects, which are still amazing.
3615;A decent price until something better shows up.
3616;It's just a great movie
3617;This is one of my favorite movies, but I did not own it on Blu.
3618;Very happy I finally ordered it.
3619;The acting, the story, the historical content, and movie technology make this a fantastic picture to see multiple times!
3620;I can still remember the first time I saw Titanic.
3621;It is one of those movies that moves you and takes you to another time and place.
3622;It simply touched me in that way.
3623;It's a film that will always stay with me.
3624;Loved every minute of it.
3625;I like this movie because it accurately portrays the evnts of the sinking, and, also, it shows what the human race is like when disaster strikes.
3626;this was not an extraordinary movie on the whole, and certainly not the best movie ever made.
3627;And the acting certainly wasn't great.
3628;I understand why the people that liked it did, and I also understand why the people that didn't like it, didn't like it.
3629;But give it a rest already.
3630;Anyway, with that said, I found this movie great for die.
3631;Many people dislike this movie for 2 reasons:1.)
3632;despite those flaws, this is a very well done and powerful movie.
3633;Absolutely beautiful sets, beautiful 90% scale ship, powerful moments, images, editing, and an excellent score by James Horner far outweigh the minor gripes some people have about this movie.
3634;There's no need to go on about the film and its presentation, its top shelf, but the Amazon Exclusive pack (and any of its variants Japanese, UK etc.) is very well done.
3635;This is what an Amazon Exclusive should strive to be, I hope its taken to heart as this is a great way to be a VAR.
3636;Now, I had enjoyed this the first time I viewed it (holy cow, can it really be 15 years ago?
3637;, but I'm well aware that it's long been fashionable in some circles to make fun of the film.
3638;i still enjoy the picture (though it's not one that I'm likely to re.
3639;watch often in its entirety) and I do recommend it.
3640;I thought it would be a little more striking, in fact.
3641;While I find the very end of the film most touching.
3642;Holy cow, she could have just written out a complete account of her story and packed it up along with the gem.
3643;I saw many movies from that year that deserved best picture, and this wasn't one of them.
3644;I laughed when Leo died.
3645;Stick to action, that is what you are good at.
3646;Recently watched it again and loved it all over.
3647;Since Rose has STUPIDLY put love above security and Billy N. zane's (well, that's the characters he plays!)
3648;millions of bucks, she's paying for it now.
3649;she's had one kid, added another 60 pounds and has another Little Leo in the oven.
3650;natural orange hair and is breast.
3651;this is reality girls, so make this movie a lesson in life!
3652;No, put that baby in the bank for nine decades, draw interest, if you don't want the money, give it to the victims of Hurricane Katrina for God's sake!
3653;Maybe someday someone will make this story correctly.
3654;The item was brand new like they said, I love this movie.
3655;And the Oscar for best actor/actress goes to 'Titanic the Ship.'
3656;And to me the best they ever did was putting Ben.
3657;saw the movie Life is beautiful when it was released here.
3658;The moment Hollywood / press pumped it up .
3659;we all think it's the best.
3660;Cameron please stick to reality .
3661;you did good with your Terminators Aliens.
3662;We love it every time we watch it.
3663;The sound track is wonderful on surround sound.
3664;The detail in the costuming and set are awesome.
3665;Right at the start of this intriguing movie, we see a robot probe going through the innards of the actual Titanic, lying deep in the ocean off Canada's Grand Banks.
3666;It's very artfully done and the only question we might still have, near the end, as that old lady returns those much sought after diamonds to the depths where they were supposed to have lain for so long, is: what are we searching for?
3667;Maybe it's the film's real strength.
3668;Maybe it's what keeps us guessing all the time, even throughout the fictional recreation.
3669;What's down there for us?Whatever the answer, I believe you'll enjoy the voyage.
3670;Seen this movie before and liked it, looked for it at the store but too expensive, saw it here on sale and couldn't let it pass so I bought and the movie is fantastic!
3671;i love titanic and i love even more that its on blu ray!
3672;this is a great movie!
3673;such a great love story / tragedy!
3674;This is my favorite movie of all time!
3675;This movie will bring me to tears every single time!
3676;If you love love stories, then this is the movie for you.
3677;If you like this movie I will recommend you to get it.
3678;The actor's performance is outstanding.
3679;Leonardo and kate have an incredible chemistry in the acting and bonding on every scene.
3680;cal ( Billy Zane ) is great in his role.
3681;l. o. l. also Kathy Bates is always the best on her roles.
3682;I will see if I can get the full screen version.
3683;From the outside, the box looks pretty, the same size as many other box sets in it's class.
3684;The little pack of cards and extras is kind of neat, however not worth the $40 more for the collector's set.
3685;Regret is a very strong word, and I will use it here in regards to this set.
3686;disc edition would be the best to pick up, it's an amazing movie and a very well done transfer.
3687;This is definitely a movie worth owning.
3688;By the way: at the end of the movie, Billy Zane's character, that at best could be defined as a rich person full of prejudice, transforms himself almos into the Devil himself!
3689;It's nice to see that this film not only is the largest grossing of all time, but has spurred the most debate of all time.
3690;If you're one of the few that has not seen this movie, suffice it to say, it's silly, it's startling, and will succeed in entrancing all but the most close.
3691;I can watch this movie once a month and still not get bored.
3692;First of all let me say I loved this movie.
3693;It is one of my favorites.
3694;ok, Titanic is a good movie.
3695;but winning 11 Academy Awards?
3696;the plot is pretty simple: a rich girl falling in love with a poor guy.
3697;while being a bit too long, Titanic is historically accurate and truly a winner.
3698;it's a box office giant, andf let me say that i was very impressed when i saw it in the theaters.
3699;it's one of those movies that you see once, like it, but never want to see it again.
3700;the special effects are superb, and James Horner's music is fabulous.
3701;While age and cynicism don't have me as enthralled about the movie as I was back then (I was 21 when it came out), I still find it to be a very entertaining saga of the infamous 'night to remember'.
3702;For the younger audience, the tale of young, forbidden love is enormously appealing, even it's a particularly underwhelming love story.
3703;however, great plot and character development have never been director James Cameron's strong suit.
3704;"Where Cameron excels is in pure filmmaking that is able to create immersive transcendent environments and worlds (""Aliens""?"
3705;I still enjoy embracing this experience many years later.
3706;Winslet does a much better job in a largely thankless role.
3707;I'm only highlighting some of the shortcomings in a film that still remains a very compelling piece of entertainment all these years later.
3708;First off Titanic won 11 acadamy awards and should have won 12 but I'm sure Hollywood jealousy had something to do with it.
3709;Especially from our beloved Hollywood bigwigs.
3710;Spielberg and Friedken have amazing cinema achievments I take nothing away from their work in cinema.
3711;"Gone With The wind "" is a masterpiece dont get me wrong it is one of my all time favorites."
3712;"If Speilberg or Friedken or any other bigwig director made Titanic 1997 it would be considered the greatest movie ever made surpassing even ""Citizen Kane""."
3713;Kate Winslet was splendid as Rose and took talent to speak American in the movie.
3714;Years from now people will laugh at the love story of Titanic 1997, but Camerons film depicting the events on April 15th 1912 will be watched as the most historic and accurate depiction of that fateful night ever in any movie of Titanic made before or after Camerons version.
3715;There's some occasional special effects believability questions.
3716;But a BILLION dollars at the box office!
3717;The Titanic was not just a good movie, not just a great movie, it is the greatest movie ever.
3718;Good acting, nice story, incredible special effects with surround sound made us feel like we were right on the ship.
3719;And we came back to see it again and again.
3720;titanic: Greatest Movie of All Time!
3721;Great true story about the sinking of the Titanic and some people aboard who were struggling with depression to the very wealthy snobs,beautiful sets and a lot of action,love ,heartbreak and fun with history lesson and survival .
3722;This is one of my favorite movies.
3723;It stalled a couple of times due to my Internet, but all in all it was a great choice!
3724;Well, this is a great movie.
3725;Adding romance to this sinking catastrophe sure adds life to this movie.
3726;You really see people in this movie.
3727;much to Rose's fiance's dismay!
3728;The special effects are breathtaking .
3729;as is the fictional love story between Jack and Rose.
3730;It is no wonder, in my opinion, that this film won 11 oscars!
3731;Titanic is a very powerful and empathic movie and i have alot of memories of seeing this in the cinema when i spilt orangeade all the way down the aisle which was sweet.
3732;It's a good film that deserves it's place as one of the ground breaking films as it's a classic although Leonardo Di caprios acting was poor toward the end of the film but in it's own right this is a good film which most people have already seen but if you havent get this or the pianist which is an equaly good film though a little off the topic.
3733;This is a new classic and I'm happy to have it.
3734;Seller was excellent to deal with.
3735;The effects are great and make the movie enjoyable to watch.
3736;To me it added greatly to enjoyment of the film.
3737;And all the extras included were great as well.
3738;Especially since price has come down since I ordered it.
3739;Still think was good value!
3740;I am a big titanic enthusiast and I absolutely love this movie.
3741;Leo and Kate did an awesome job.
3742;the music in particular creates an intense feeling of awe as some of the cataclysmic scenes are shown and strongly enhances the visual effect.
3743;Now honestly, take out the admittedly superb special effects and what have you left?
3744;Okay, I'll give it an extra point for the photography.
3745;bashing epic where the wicked aristocrats trample the poor working class .
3746;Instead I found a film that portrayed clearly, accurately, and, most importantly, with balance, the world of the early twentieth century with its vast contrasts between haves and have.
3747;I was a C line fan back before she ever learned English, and I still am.
3748;"I still find her version of ""The Heart Will Go On"" (minus all the crummy DJ remixes) to be absolutely magical (especially from the top of the Las Vegas Eiffel Tower, looking down on the Bellagio fountain ballet!)"
3749;Every time I watch it, I'm overwhelmed by the incredible attention to detail, the breadth and depth of the screenplay, the amazing special effects.
3750;"The ""Mona Lisa"" is a magnificent work of art, no matter how old it gets, or you get."
3751;Everyone true movie buff has seen this film, and with so many good reviews, there isn't much need to review the standard version.
3752;inserted for the 100th anniversary for the public to enjoy.
3753;My youngest daughter absolutely loves this video.
3754;She has watched it countless times since she received it as a gift a few months ago.
3755;As far as I know, she is really enjoying it.
3756;James Cameron did a remarkable job and I loved this movie.
3757;Cameron gives great insight on how to make a movie.
3758;The precise and intricate planning,his great writing.
3759;his technical expertise and great cinematography.
3760;He is a well educated and intelligent man that knows how to work.
3761;what honestly frightens me is the overwhelming success and accolades it achieved.
3762;What is going on here?Two stars for overall production value, for making the huge boat and then sinking it, and just because I still like Cameron for having made Terminator.
3763;This film's $200,000,000 budget was worth every penny.
3764;crossed lovers from minute #1, but the amazing set design and special effects showed us just how expansive the mighty ocean really was, even for a ship as grand as the Titanic.
3765;That can only be possible because of the 120% effort that was put into absolutely every aspect of this movie.
3766;I'd say that this is a must.
3767;He may have a bigger bank account than me.
3768;the general public has always wanted the element of realism in their fantasy.
3769;Likewise today, Saving Private Ryan has been hailed for its realism and has raised the bar for future war films.
3770;this illusion is an art, and James Cameron is one of its masters.
3771;Cleverly starting the film in the present, he is able to build anticipation for the return to 1912 while seemlessly convincing us that Rose DeWitt Bukater and Jack Dawson were as real to the world as Molly Brown or J. j. Astor.
3772;Perhaps most of all, Cameron accomplishes a great feat by making the audience painfully aware of the human tragedy while at the same time amazing them with the spectacle of the ship's demise.
3773;although there are weaknesses in the script, the sheer magnitute of the film keeps the story captivating while the actors bring the passengers and crew to life.
3774;Much has been spoken about Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, but the true backbone of the film are the supporting characters whose presence evokes the wide range of emotions needed for a viewer to invest in the plot.
3775;This story is well told with all the right ingredients of suspense, love, and romance, and action.
3776;The sets are magnificent and the special effects (especially the surround sound) bring the viewer right in the action when the ship starts sinking.
3777;THE WORST ADDITIVES WERE THE ACTORS!
3778;"Having curves just adds to her beauty
I:30;3779;like leading lady winning Jack's heart.
I:30;3780;She is a beautiful woman and looked simply wonderful (albeit she looked a bit older than her movie.
I:30;3781;Certainly, he had a temper and a clueless approach to romance, but I believed he genuinely loved Rose, evident by his expressions and the great lengths he went to in an attempt to keep her.
I:30;3782;He finally realized he had a heart in time to have it broken, and reacted accordingly.
I:30;3783;otherwise, the movie was dramatic, touching, and heartbreaking, especially the final scene.
I:30;3784;Mde an already great movie even greater.
I:30;3785;and I have to say """"Wow!"""""""
3786;This is one of the best films I have ever seen.
3787;I was overwhelmed by the amazing effects, the ship, the filming, the music, the acting, the presisements of the shots of historical facts between the story being told on the screen (you really learn how to value all that planning and timing watching the extra material on the new edition, really impressive and a reason to love the movie itself).
3788;And if you likes the movie, and you're curious about how they managed to do some of the amazing shots, my response is the same.
3789;I was actually surprised they'd even come up with that as an outcome of the amazing story, and it actually looks like a parody or something .
3790;The original ending proves that sometimes less is more.
3791;And what a perfect ending!Highly recommended, if not larger it is as large as life!
3792;It would have been a no doubt brilliant way to end a career.
3793;A great loss, not only to her family's future inheritance, but such an object should be in the Smitsonian or similar where it could be enjoyed by the public.
3794;but overall, it was well done, and Mr. Cameron deserves the accolades he's received.
3795;Follow up your viewing with the transcripts of the Titanic Disaster Hearings .
3796;life dimension to the cinematic experience.
3797;Titanic mania was everywhere, from books to the soundtrack which spent an amazing 18 weeks at number and you couldn't turn on a radio and not hear Celine Dion's omnipresent My Heart Will Go On .
3798;Oh yeah, James Cameron made pretty enjoyable and good film.
3799;Known for his use of special effects, Titanic boasts some stunning visuals.
3800;The detailed recreation of the doomed ship is stunning.
3801;The sinking of the ship is terrifying and breathtaking.
3802;Amid all these effects is a classic Hollywood love story.
3803;The tragic ending to their relationship will leave you misty.
3804;While the movie definitely pulls on your heartstrings, the two leads are so believable and charming you can't help but be drawn in.
3805;hur with a record 11 Academy Awards.
3806;They were consistent during whole feature film.
3807;The historical facts are all in line, the romance is a pleasant touch, and there is just enough suspense to keep you captivated but not repelled.
3808;This another one of my all time favorite movies.
3809;This one is for sure worth adding to your collection.
3810;I loved this movie, I saw it 6 times in the theatre.
3811;It's in my top three, along with Braveheart and The Shawshank Redemption.
3812;a action pack love story I LLLOOOVVVEEEDDD IT its graet.
3813;I bought this version first and about a week later I bought the 3 disc set because I wanted to see all the special features.
3814;The acting is excellent, plot, storyline, everything.
3815;I just love this movie!
3816;The excitement is matched by production values that are spectacular in every way.
3817;I was told to see this by a girlfriend.
3818;Well, when its sinking, its great special effects.
3819;i was so excited and it never eventuated.
3820;I forgot how great and sad this film is.
3821;It has great characters that we come to love, and a powerful forbidden love storyline.
3822;Rose is now an elderly lady, and tells Brock and his team her story aboard the Titanic.
3823;If you're a history buff and want a smart love story, you'll love TITANIC!!!
3824;In part, it is the romance that unfolds in the first half of the film that makes the second half so emotionally moving.
3825;"In my opinion, after seeing the movie for the first time last night, and processing it with a more critical eye for most of today, Titanic is one of the finest films ever made (and I don't say that lightly), perhaps second only to Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo."""
3826;What I will talk about is this transfer, which is absolutely fantastic.
3827;rays earlier this year, and I have around 70, ranging from the high.
3828;budgeted Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, to more modest films like True Grit and Memento and I can say that, video.
3829;wise, Titanic is the clearest blu.
3830;ray I have ever seen.
3831;this is indeed one of the best blu.
3832;It sank after striking an iceberg.
3833;James Cameron directed a blockbuster, which earned him Best Picture and became the most popular film of the late 90's.
3834;Although it is Jack who loses his life, he has made it possible for the ill.
3835;We genuinely root for the perfect couple that Jack and Rose are, we dislike the villainous, self.
3836;The romance takes up most of the first half of the film, embellished with the luxury of the ship's upper class dinner halls and ballroom.
3837;Authentic period costumes of the Edwardian era enhance the characters and their way of life.
3838;The exception is the newly rich Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) who came from a humble Ozark life to newly acquired fortune made by the discovery of oil.
3839;these events are pretty much told in the musical Molly Brown , herself based on a true survivor of the ship.
3840;She was a pleasant, unpretentious, caring, humorous noble woman whose spirit was as they said unsinkable.
3841;Kathy Bates' portrayal of Molly Brown is quite enjoyable, as she seems to be the only noble and heroic and less hypocritical of the upper class people.
3842;Rose lives to tell her tale.
3843;The movie is a beautiful tale of survival, heartache and passion.
3844;One of my top 5 favorite movies.
3845;the heart searing music song by celine dion.
3846;The special effects were really touted as being top.
3847;the story, although fairly well known, is still pretty captivating.
3848;Still, it may be a tear.
3849;jerker for some, making it a good date movie.
3850;those who dismiss the romance of Jack and Rose as completely implausible have themselves never had the glorious experience.
3851;the love of Jack and Rose is rare but it certainly does exist and James Cameron has given us a look at that rare gem.
3852;Then, I remember, the master's art is judged by all the cynicism or joy WE bring to the moment we experience the art before us.
3853;there is a reason Titanic is the most successful movie ever made.
3854;It has deeply touched millions.
3855;They have the capacity to deeply love and experience what Jack and Rose felt.
3856;i sincerely appreciate James Cameron's creation of this masterpiece.
3857;cameron shows us one day of true love might be a priceless gift to treasure for a lifetime.
3858;Of course, with a great TV and sound system, this is almost as good as seeing it in a theater!
3859;Among them: Best Picture, a Best Director for James Cameron and a Best Cinematography for Russell Carpenter.
3860;sound can do a nice job on its Oscar.
3861;"Film Critic Raven D calls Titanic a ""romantic masterpiece."""
3862;The film evokes strong emotion partly because of the real.
3863;life tragedy it recreates but also thanks to the intimate love story Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet bring to life.
3864;Film CriticVideo reviews may be found at kidsfirst dot orgTitanic is my favorite movie by far.
3865;This romantic masterpiece starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet tells a tale of love, loss and tragedy.
3866;I was 7 years old, and I've been hooked ever since.
3867;this movie is beautifully done.
3868;I love that the cinematography is so grand and breathtaking even though the film came out in 1997.
3869;I especially love the way they capture the Titanic in all its glory.
3870;I've seen every documentary and read every book there is to read about the Titanic, so the fact that they used actual footage of the wreckage of Titanic was really cool.
3871;my favorite characters are Rose and Jack, of course!
3872;Not only are those characters great, but Kate and Leonardo do a masterful job in these roles.
3873;I love the whole movie, but my favorite scene would have to be when Rose and Jack are running through the ship away from the butler after the drawing scene.
3874;It lightens the mood of the film before the sinking and is quite funny.
3875;I also admire the final few scenes in which the ship is sinking.
3876;The way it is captured is amazing.
3877;It's the perfect mix of chaos and emotion, which really conveys the tragedy in a brilliant way.
3878;I would recommend this film for all ages, even though it is sad and slightly inappropriate.
3879;see movie, and I give it five out of five stars.
3880;ray, so be sure to add it to your home movie collection today!
3881;Titanic has won 11 Oscars including Best Picture.
3882;It took over millions of dollars to make this movie, they've put in 3 hours, and the journey was very incredible.
3883;It was so good that I just had to see it again and again.
3884;It was worth it too, and should be worth 5 stars.
3885;You'll never see another movie as good as this one.
3886;Still, the film won both Best Picture and Best Director Oscars (instead of LA Confidential), which once again proves that the academy tends to reward the wrong films.
3887;I won't deny it brought a tear to my eye now and then when you actually see how much Jack and Rose really loved each other and how the story actually ended.
3888;This honestly is a great film when it comes to true romance, emotions and tragedy.
3889;Great story and great acting!
3890;Sometimes you don't need a lot of words to rate excellent works.
3891;The first half is a melodramatic love story, and the second half is an Irwin Allen Disaster movie!
3892;The love story is nice.
3893;the second half is impressive, but it's spoiled by the bulls**t of the love story.
3894;It marked the end of the Guilded Age, it marked the end of the age of Iron, and it marked the end of mankind's smug assumption that it could do 'anything.
3895;'It was an event of monumental significance .
3896;(Spoiler alert: She lets go.)
3897;It's subtle, simply providing depth.
3898;I just received my copy yesterday and watched it right away.
3899;Titanic is a great movie.
3900;It tells you you need the special Player and Tv in very small print on the back of the cover.
3901;Opening scene of the movie is pretty neat as well.
3902;overall I am very happy.
3903;When I first saw Titanic, I thought it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen.
3904;the film itself is a marvel of modern technology.
3905;While some of the computer effects look artificial, there are some spectacular scenes, especially the whole sinking sequence, which takes up nearly a quarter of the movie.
3906;I will say that this is the best part of the movie (much like in Pearl Harbor, where the attack is the best).
3907;the love story that is so central to this movie is well done and never really feels contrived.
3908;The meeting between Jack (diCaprio) and Rose (Winslet) is clever and believable, and their feelings grow toward one another naturally and at a good pace.
3909;The length of the movie helps you develop feelings for the main characters, and you want their love to continue uninterrupted.
3910;acting is superb, and it is through their roles in this film that diCaprio and Winslet became famous (diCaprio furthering his Hollywood stardom, and Winslet gaining recognition worldwide).
3911;The costumes and set decorations are very authentic, and through these the fated ship and its passengers come to life on the screen.
3912;there are a lot of people out there that look at this film as a chick flick and refuse to see it because it gushes romantic.
3913;"I understand why this would be so
I:30;3914;in short, this is an entertaining movie, worth watching if you have an interest in history as it brings the past alive.
I:30;3915;It has drama, action, romance, humor, pathos, you get it all!
I:30;3916;Cameron does not seem like the kind of man that I would like to know, but he has given us a great film.
I:30;3917;This film is a gem.
I:30;3918;The moments of highest emotion between Jack and Rose were a little nauseating.
I:30;3919;In the end I was cheering for the iceberg.
I:30;3920;the special effect were pretty cool, however.
I:30;3921;TITANIC is one of the greatest love stories ever told whether you like it or not.
I:30;3922;And nobody has forgotten the thrills and chills during the Sinking Sequence of the film.
I:30;3923;And the special effects are specatacular and incredible.
I:30;3924;I still think TITANIC deserved every single one of the Oscars the film won.
I:30;3925;Received product in perfect condition and 2.3 days earlier than expected!
I:30;3926;It came in a timely fashion which is always great for not having Amazaon Prime.
I:30;3927;it is one of my favorite movies ever!!!!!
I:30;3928;If you feel the urge the press the 'No' button, please help yourself.
I:30;3929;I finally went and saw Titanic with a still closed mind.
I:30;3930;From the opening sequence until the end credits this I was riveted to the screen.
I:30;3931;I have friends who saw the movie with their buddies and have the same opinion as me.
I:30;3932;The crews' video is unexpectedly funny.
I:30;3933;*I would have loved to have seen a documentary on here.
I:30;3934;this is a great way to see the film if you're like me, and kept watching it for years wondering what the fuss was about.
I:30;3935;The added extras give new dimension to the movie, and make it the version to own.
I:30;3936;But the box of and content of the collectors edition is great.
I:30;3937;And the Visual blu ray is fantastic.
I:30;3938;Winning 11 Academy Awards, Titanic is a huge hit.
I:30;3939;I enjoyed this epic film because of the history behind the movie and the infiltration of a love story.
I:30;3940;Their hidden romance portrayed through out the film was enduring and captured the hearts of the audience.
I:30;3941;I felt that this disaster epic was well written and produced and the footage that the producer was able to create and capture is remarkable.
I:30;3942;jack is a penniless artist who wins his passage home to the States in a poker game.
I:30;3943;The Titanic is a magnificent ocean liner, more opulent than many palaces, more diverse than many cities.
I:30;3944;Thus the scene is set for the greatest romantic epic of all time.
I:30;3945;the problem with Titanic is that the Boat is the true star of the picture, and to this end, the movie works well, with some beautifully realised shots of a very convincing ocean liner.
I:30;3946;baked script with some lovely special effects, get 'Titanic'.
I:30;3947;In addition I was charged a restocking fee.
I:30;3948;The special effects are beyond good there great.
I:30;3949;I constantly watch this film for technical mistakes.
I:30;3950;This film will be another gone with the wind .
I:30;3951;A great movie with excellent actors.
I:30;3952;gray sky above a right.3/4.
I:30;3953;Interesting to find out about the scene where Jack and Rose are taking their first daylight walk on the deck and Jack confronts Rose by asking her if she loves Cal.
I:30;3954;the historical commentary with Don Lynch and Ken Marschall was fun.
I:30;3955;Still, Jim actually gives more historical background that Don and Ken .
I:30;3956;he obviously knows his stuff and is very passionate.
I:30;3957;The Making Of Titanic Tv Special is a good behind the scenes feature, particularly for people who want some of the backstage story but won't be taking the time to get into the commentaries and """"pods"""" where much of this is explored in even more detail."""
3958;Titanic Crew Video is a hoot .
3959;one of the AD's took home video footage of the shoot and then edited it together with some of the movie scenes (along with a few shots from Poseidon Adventure and other old films) for comic effect.
3960;"(I particularly liked the shot of Titanic pulling out of the harbor with a big ""Sink Me"" Post."
3961;but I think Titanic is an incredible screenplay.
3962;but still a compelling and entertaining movie.)
3963;Screenplays are about structure and visual storytelling.
3964;And it's here that Titanic excels.
3965;Their story will show the audience the ship as well as the social structure of the day.
3966;Enter Brock and his modern.
3967;They need Rose to take them back to Titanic and paint the triumph and tragedy of the great ship.
3968;the film is visually audacious .
3969;the angles are dramatic and unimaginable.
3970;Even the close shots have deep detailed backgrounds.
3971;finally, the themes of the film acted out by the characters, are the drawn from the lessons of Titanic as well.
3972;She leaves all that behind in the North Atlantic, and embarks on a life with no security .
3973;On a larger scale, Titanic was that beautiful but strictly controlled society.
3974;We can roll our eyes at their arrogance, but we also can't help but be a little nostalgic for the lovely world they created.
3975;In my personal opinion, this was the greatest cinemactic bastardization of an historical event ever made.
3976;sure it's special effects and accurate ship set were touted forever in a day when it came out, and implications were aplenty that.
3977;despite the fictional love story and all that kind of jazz., it somehow evoked the real.
3978;Just one of the many, many misinterpreations of character that plagued the depiction of the real.
3979;"A stund that only would have ensured you a ticket across the Jordan in real life), it also lacked the saving storytelling graces that made films like ""The Great Escape"", ""A Night To Remember"", and ""The Longest Day (for example) such classics of historical drama."
3980;"drawn characters in any case, as opposed to the above mentioned ""Great Escape"" characters."
3981;and the cultural excesses of it's success coated the memory of the real.
3982;life Titanic story with so much cultural junk that it will take a good.
3983;Lets hope Hollywood has the guts to GET IT RIGHT the next time!
3984;Those who call this the most touching movie ever have obviously never seen a film with such emotional power as The Rules of the Game (1939).
3985;Let me recommend one of my favorite films in lieu of Titanic.
3986;If you want to experience a film with a compelling drama that climaxes by giving you a surge that not only brings sudden tears but also a heart flutter, watch Zinnemann's The Search (1948).
3987;it's on my top ten list.
3988;The movie was crisp and clear.
3989;I just have to add this movie will still move you after all these years, and I can't believe that I can keep watching this 3 hour plus movie, and not get bored.
3990;Yes, the special effects are good, but that's the end of the story.
3991;When the stern of the ship rises from the ocean with the people swimming below, it is just amazing.
3992;A modern telling of the Titanic story.
3993;What more can I say about a gorgeous ship on the wide open Atlantic Ocean with two lovers on board?
3994;so you think this is a good movie, huh?!
3995;And it's fans have the mentalities of .
3996;There is NOTHING about this film that is of redeaming value.
3997;And what is it with special effects that turn people on?
3998;I really enjoyed this remake.
3999;I love the original, and I think a good job was done staying true to the original, while managing to update it for a new generation.
4000;i thought this movie was fast paced and fun.
4001;the interaction between the characters was pretty well done.
4002;soon, the blob starts making itself known, consuming many people.
4003;Some kind of rich lady shows up, and seals the boat with the purpose of capturing the voracious organism.
4004;I thought it was quite funny how a number of people would fire at the blob with pistols and automatic weapons, only to find it had no effect on the creature.
4005;Also, the special effects are well done, and show us more of what we didn't see in the old version.
4006;i think the old version, which I also own, is and always will be a classic, and this makes a nice companion and is a good movie in it's own right.
4007;All I can say is it arrived in a timely manner and looks good from the outside package!
4008;For the most part that is true.
4009;The underwater scenes had excellent depth (another bad pun).
4010;If you are looking for a love story that have a pop culture story (like some sort of 90210 Beverly Hills in the old fashion), this is for you.
4011;I noticed that those people who have had a heartbreak just liked this movie, enjoyed and cried much more than other people.
4012;james Horner made a good soundtrack (I have it).
4013;Star Wars made a special contribution in visual aspects and caused a revolution in the Sci.
4014;If you want a genius, look for Spielberg best movies or read Franz Kafka.
4015;Just put it in the right place.
4016;Thank you for reading this.
4017;Both created inexpressible interest in occupations of limited pull for children.
4018;tells the world this movie was a hit.
4019;The film begins brilliantly with some lively and vulgar wordplay from an underwater salvage team .
4020;but no, there's been no mistake, you are about to see two hundred million dollars worth of the best that Hollywood has to offer: James Cameron has masterfully toyed with your expectations.
4021;The appearance of the iceberg is truly cause for celebration.
4022;What a good iceberg it is, searching out and destroying this disgraceful cast and scruppering the film good and proper.
4023;A lovely postscript shows Rose thowing her priceless jewel into the depths of the Atlantic.
4024;surely a wonderful symbol for the movie as a whole.
4025;Everyone knows this film for being a multi.
4026;"dollar epic as well as a definitive love story (with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet)
I:30;4027;on this level, even as its deceptive surface emphasizes its tragic love story, it's a masterpiece that Joseph Campbell would have venerated using a real.
I:30;4028;life tragic event to tell a positive, life.
I:30;4029;affirming story of a woman finding herself utilizing the iconography of Freudian dream symbolism.
I:30;4030;goers did NOT see/hear is the entire script: a polished, literate and thoroughly professional piece of writing.
I:30;4031;It wasn't so much about the story line but more about the visual spectacle, and I found myself saying 'wow' throughout the movie.
I:30;4032;I'm going to see it again.
I:30;4033;Take many big name (and not so big name) celebrities, place them in a dangerous setting, add incredible special effects, then watch them survive (or die trying).
I:30;4034;The Poseidon Adventure part II, perhaps.
I:30;4035;this film affects each one who sees it in a unique and personal way, and after three viewing I feel I must share my impressions.
I:30;4036;Simply put, you MUST see this film.
I:30;4037;You must experience one of the grander offerings Hollywood has given us while it's on the big screen.
I:30;4038;why is this film such a success?
I:30;4039;The words, """"Titanic hit an iceberg and 1500 people died when it sank,"""" are just words."""
4040;is that its realism is so striking that you feel as though one of the passengers was filming the entire event with a camcorder.
4041;"The illusion is so perfect that you never once think of what you're seeing as a ""re."
4042;And you are a witness to its sinking.
4043;You learn what a beautiful ship Titanic was, how strong, how fast.
4044;but what makes the film such a true success is the love story.
4045;written and acted that you believe they might have.
4046;The dramatic class war between first class and steerage is complex and vivid.
4047;"Below decks, the ""have nots"" have rowdy, wild step dancing parties filled with music, singing, laughter, arm."
4048;absolute joy permeates the air.
4049;Attending such a party, Rose cuts loose and has a wonderful time.
4050;titanic is filled with powerful scenes.
4051;But the look between husband and wife says it all: I'll never see you again.
4052;"in another scene, you marvel at the kind way ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown fondly looks after Jack and lends him a tuxedo."
4053;Throughout the film, you believe that 101 old Rose holds a love for Jack that has withstood 84 years.
4054;In a tasteful and non.
4055;explicit scene, as Rose and Jack make love for the first time, you feel the passion they share, and you believe they are really in love.
4056;despite the tragedy, the film is also surprisingly filled with many scenes that make you smile or are very humorous.
4057;The amusing way Jack .
4058;attempts to emulate the walk and gestures of the upper class is very funny and endearing.
4059;He does landscapes, Jack replies.
4060;"james Horner's soundtrack is haunting and beautiful, and as the credits roll and Celine Dion's ""My heart will go on"" begins to play, you'll just be staring at the screen, amazed at how perfect a movie."
4061;Love can touch us one time / and last for a lifetime.
4062;When you do, then you'll understand.
4063;hits an iceberg and does just that.
4064;worth investing your time and movie dollars.
4065;What made the film so good was the combination of the riveting sequence of the ship going under, the love story that captured hearts everywhere, and an easy to hate villain.
4066;A return trip to Titanic is an experience we should all undertake.
4067;James Cameron cast aside the fascinating, true story of the Titanic, to tell a fictional tale about a young woman in love with a freespirited bohemian artist (oh brother).
4068;James Horner, who did the marvelous score for Braveheart, offers negligible help, and the huge budget can't make the sinking as exciting as it was in the infinitely superior A Night To Remember.
4069;My son (aged 14) and I went to see the special effects on the big screen, as he had been a fan of the actual historical event since early childhood.
4070;the so. called Academy lost all credibility with me that year, picking this piece of tinsel over The Full Monty , a film with real cinematic craft about real people in a real place and time.
4071;The Video I ordered came in like new condition.
4072;The service handling my order was excellent.
4073;GWTW turned out to be a classic, and Titanic will, too.
4074;the historical aspects of the movie are unparalleled.
4075;The proud Captain Smith, the self.
4076;I thought that both DiCaprio and Winslet turned in decent performances, if not worthy of best.
4077;I cheered for her when she told her mother off just before she boarded the lifeboat.
4078;Both of them acted like typcial teens experiencing their first love affair.
4079;there were several other minor characters involved in the film, and I enjoyed them all.
4080;David Warner was also excellent as the sinister assistant/accomplice to Zane's scheming.
4081;overall, this is a magnificent movie.
4082;Cameron does an excellent job of creating a snapshot of life in 1912, and makes us truly care about the characters, most of whom will meet tragic ends in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic.
4083;This movie is one for the ages.
4084;I'm sorry to all of the people out there that loved this movie, but it stank.
4085;James Cameron's 'Titanic' is essentially a romantic adventure with visual grandeur and magnificence, a timeless tragic love story set against the background of this major historical event.
4086;It's an astonishing movie that exemplifies hope, love and humanity.
4087;leonardo DiCaprio is terrific on screen with big charisma.
4088;Conveying passion, trust, insouciance and ingenuity, he a free.
4089;spirited wanderer with artistic pretensions, and a zest for life.
4090;kate Winslet is absolutely lovely as the confused upper.
4091;victor Garber is the master shipbuilder, the real.
4092;"'Titanic' is loaded with luminous photography and sweeping visuals as the footage of the shipwrecked Ocean liner lying motionless on the ocean floor
I:30;4093;winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, James Cameron's """"Titanic"""" is a gigantic epic where you don't just watch the film, you experience it!"""
4094;The visual effects are amazing, like no other film's.
4095;James Horner's music intensifies the emotions.
4096;The whole movie is hunting and involving, filled with a wide range of deep feelings.
4097;it's truly a moving tribute to those who lost their lives on that unfortunate ship.
4098;The sinking scenes are just excellent made.
4099;The movie had good and bad points, but I think it's a good one when you put all in the balance.
4100;What an amazing show in that format.
4101;I loved the grandeur and depth.
4102;titanic is an outstanding movie, bar none.
4103;James Cameron mixes a real.
4104;life tragedy with a fictional love story that is very believable.
4105;All this has made me a sentimental idiot and I have never loved a movie as much as this one.
4106;I enjoyed it mostly from the standpoint of the special effects such as the bridge and engine room scenes (before, during and after the collision with the iceberg.)
4107;Titanic is a Classic movie.
4108;What sets this movie apart from any other is that it gets you to truly care for the characters and what happens to them.
4109;James Cameron does a great job directing all of the actors, making them as believable as possible.
4110;he was the guy who designed the Titanic), the acting was excellent.
4111;It was a great movie, check it out if you haven't already.
4112;"Though I can understand why this film appealed to so many and I can even applaud its technical merits, I am still bewildered at those who claim it is ""one of the greatest films of all time."""
4113;"Just as bewildering is the fact that it won so many Academy Awards and even beat out ""L. a. Confidential,"" quite possibly the best film on the '90's, for the Best Picture award."
4114;(one of the few parts of the film I enjoyed).
4115;artistically and technically, it is a spectacle.
4116;"And Billy Zane, as the ""evil"" side of the love triangle is excellent."
4117;But the script is so by the numbers and routine!It's simple.
4118;An iceberg beats him to it.
4119;sentimental spectacle, then this is the film for you.
4120;This movie won 11 academy awards and was over three hours long.
4121;First let me say this was a good movie.
4122;When I watch a historical movie, what I expect is an accurate, educational, and well.
4123;done depiction of true events that have redeeming social value and purpose.
4124;The special effects were top notch.
4125;Cameron is also known for his work on such films as Aliens and the Abyss to name a few.
4126;So Cameron's work is definately worth recognition here.
4127;But a truely great historical film as I said before sticks to it's main purpose in accurately depicting real history, not a teen romance flick hiding inside a sinking ship.
4128;I was one of the few who knew this was going to be good.
4129;But I was steadfast on seeing it, because I liked all of James Cameron's films, and I was certain to go see this one regardless of what the story was.
4130;and then the film came out and it was great.
4131;May not have been the best picture of the year, but it is one of the few films that have won best picture that weren't the best pictures of their year, that I believed earned the title because of the struggle the filmmakers went through to make this movie.
4132;His very insightful and thorough commentary and I strongly recommend it for anybody who wants to be a filmmaker.
4133;And had forgoten the grace a subtlety that surrounds the charactetrs.
4134;"Got dragged into seeing it with an ""ex"" and the family."
4135;Two stars for the beautiful recreation of the doomed ship's probable appearance.
4136;when this film was released, I worked in the public schools.
4137;What it is, in fact, is one of the greatest anomalies in cinema history.
4138;a genuinely stirring, wrenchingly powerful drama, saddled with a screenplay so banal and unconvincing you can't help but marvel at its stupidity.
4139;the plot by now is well.
4140;com's valuable space by subjecting you to a recap.
4141;Certainly, Leonardo diCaprio and Kate Winslet are given some of the script's worst lines, but the sheer strength and likeability of their performances elevates them above the paper.
4142;It may very well be the acting coup of the century.
4143;Director James Cameron is nothing if not a technical and visual wizard, and the way he presents the ship's sinking, documenting a tragedy of unspeakably massive proportions while still managing to tighten the screws on Jack and Rose's situation, is quite brilliant.
4144;"Indeed, ""Titanic's"" second half is filledwith individual moments that grip and resonate, and Cameron even manages a few instances of heart."
4145;dressing is a surprisingly powerful moviegoing experience.
4146;Everyone knows the name of the most famous ship of all time, The Titanic.
4147;ray version of a classic film.
4148;I enjoyed watching it again, glad I have added it to my collection.
4149;I usually relent and get it.
4150;So I have numerous copies of this great movie.
4151;The two of them thrill me with their stories and amaze me with their technical excellence each time.
4152;edited mixes of the original.
4153;If you are a history buff you will enjoy this movie.
4154;Movie added with a touch of love and romance.
4155;I think this deserved Best Picture and Best Director.
4156;The only thing I don't like about this movie is that it is TOO good.
4157;Very good directing and very good effects, this film should be considered watching.
4158;it was awsome movie so romantic it reminds me of my charlie and I we have so much love for each other
4159;this is the very best movie i have ever seen!
4160;the actors give an amazing performance.
4161;I was so amazed by the special effects!
4162;But all I'm trying to say is that, it's really worth watching.
4163;Great acting, comedy, tragedy, romance, action, adventure.
4164;Not only will you bawl, you'll laugh, and wonder.
4165;Jack and Rose's story is one that will stay with you long after the movie has ended.
4166;This is one of the very best movies I have ever seen.
4167;It is not always true to facts, but it will keep you on the edge of your seat.
4168;I loved the love story this had in it.
4169;I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
4170;if you do want to see the best picture for that year watch L. a. confedential.
4171;Movies do not get bigger, grander or more enjoyable than this one .
4172;Cameron's screenplay is utter cornball, but Kate Winslet, the cinematography and the sweeping beauty of the score all pull you in.
4173;Using a simple love story as a framing device pays off in spades, because it makes the entire awesome tragedy real and urgent .
4174;The finale is one of the most perfectly sentimental endings ever made.
4175;It transports you into a melancholy euphoria.
4176;I think the widescreen version, on a big TV, is best .
4177;It really is a worthy competitor to GONE WITH THE WIND as a spectacular canvas of history, populated with winning, if somewhat cardboard characters.
4178;Let me start by saying that I love this film.
4179;Having said that, the real star of the movie, the ship, is incredible!
4180;The effects were more than spectacular.
4181;The heroic string quartet and the ones who stayed behind to certain doom received short shrift.
4182;People who have low self esteem and haven't really accomplished a lot in life make themselves feel better by tearing down something that is extremely popular such as the movie Titanic.
4183;And of course, there is the love story which is far from original.
4184;With all that is wrong with it the movie has a sense of elegance.
4185;The story moves along at a good pace.
4186;The score by James Horner is really nice although I am one of those grouches who hated the Celine Dion song the first time I heard it.
4187;This is a great movie and it is really realistic.
4188;The Titanic story is a story that really gets you involved in it and it always makes you cry when the Titanic sinks.
4189;It is a tragic love story and keeps you involved so you don't want to put down the remote.
4190;It is a great movie (as I said before)!
4191;Rose is attracted to the fact that Jack offers her an undetermined future as well as a chance for a way out of her family responsibility.
4192;By marrying Cal her family stays rich and her mother doesn't have to work.yet another ego.
4193;The real untold story of this Hollywood Titanic is how Rose survived on her own after the ships sinking.
4194;I have seen the Titanic before in the movies but what a great surprise I had by watching it on Blue Ray.
4195;This edition has some great background material that you'll enjoy including an alternate ending that will have you rolling and pounding on the floor!
4196;Sometimes you have to takes movies as a whole, and this one is WONDERFUL!
4197;This movie is a classic.
4198;There is always going to be the handful that have a need to go against the grain.
4199;and it just serves us right to take their opinions with a grain of salt.
4200;release film screenings in 1997, most of which seemed to take the world back to the classics of the early century.
4201;Good Will Hunting was great!
4202;L. a. Confidential was beautiful and chilling!
4203;As Good As it Gets was hilariously brilliant!
4204;The Full Monty was, eh, good.
4205;what more can I say than 'perfect?!'
4206;"I just went to order and I see that they have the ""sign up to be notified when this item becomes available"" note on it."
4207;This movie should never, ever win the Oscar especially when competing with As Good As It Gets .
4208;The best part of the movie is the historical authenticity in recreating the Titanic and its sinking.
4209;there are great stories out there pick something that will not make You sick to Your stomach after watching it.
4210;This film is probably in my top five favorite movies of all time.
4211;Everything about this movie is stunning.
4212;It truely deserved every single Award that it won.
4213;The film is inspiring, touching, heartbreaking, and even funny at times.
4214;The film is very period, even right down to the costumes, artwork, and overall look.
4215;The film is alive with music, drama, dazzling special effects, and one stellar cast.
4216;The film is completely wonderful in everyway.
4217;All those years of petitions, the fans are finally getting what they want.
4218;the emotional buildup in that scene helps to explain how she came to nearly killing herself but instead meeting up with Jack.
4219;"I appreciated having the other documentaries regarding the Titanic story, and of course Celine Dion sounded wonderful singing ""My Heart Will Go On."
4220;Yes, this version is a winner overall.
4221;Though the movie was shot virtually, it seems very real.
4222;The first half of the film is both exciting and heart warming.
4223;danny Nucci and Leonardo Dicaprio make a great team.
4224;It's called First Meeting and it's posted at After the Iceberg.
4225;but the directing was fabulous!
4226;the acting was great and they did a great job with a not so great script.
4227;rose wasnt happy with her SELFISH fiance.
4228;but rose didnt want it!
4229;she lost her virginity to jack,but she loved him and she didnt love cal!
4230;and although at certein times the affects did look fake, the whole movie was, scary, sad, thought provoking, moving and very well done!
4231;i particularly loved kates work in all this!
4232;Well Scarface is much better thn this, and if u want a good movie that won a bit of oscars, watch Glory, Forest Gump, or The Godfather.
4233;This was the best present for myself EVER!
4234;It came early and in MINT condition, as if he had just opened it.
4235;i highly recommend this seller!!!
4236;It was just as good as I remember it.
4237;We had such a fun time and this was the perfect movie for the weekend.
4238;thank you so very mush it came on time and is in A one shape.
4239;The product was brand new.
4240;The product was sealed and in excellent condition.
4241;year old gives this rating because he enjoyed the effects of the titanic breaking up.
4242;This is a great movie I've ever seen.
4243;Titanic is one of the greatest movies ever made.
4244;I liked how they incorporated a love story in with the sinking of the ship.
4245;When I bought Titanic, the movie sailed away into my heart, I even burst into tears at the end and that does not happen often when I watch a movie.
4246;i floated away into the era of pure granduer and magic as Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio lit up the screen as Jack and Rose, two young lovers who are absolutely crazy for each other.
4247;Rose's spirit, compared to that of a wild horse roaming the plains, is what draws herself towards Jack, who really thinks she is the greatest girl in the the world.
4248;"the sunset is my favorite scene where Rose cries out ""I'm flying"" before she and Jack engage in the most endearing kiss."
4249;The scenes are emotional, filled with pure terror, bitterness, and the ever.
4250;lasting screams of the dying.
4251;Along with the sinking comes thrilling chases and hardness of envy.
4252;a beautiful movie of tenderness, adventure, and the surival to live or die on the Titanic!
4253;James Cameron put together a nice movie for girls.
4254;Everlasting love within seconds after boy and girl meet for the first time.
4255;i have got to hand it to James Cameron, that everything looksquite realistic.
4256;When I first knew of the movie I thought to myself, ok theres been other Titanic movies, but seriously, being released in the time it was with or new use of special effects, I knew it would be an amazing visual movie to watch, especially with action director James Cameron behind the helm.
4257;Impressive movie, the epic scale and visuals blow me away, honestly the love story could have been stronger though.
4258;i enjoy Leo in a number of films, but James Cameron is not known for his romance portrayed on film, but the huge epic sets, action, intensity, sound and suspense put into his work like Aliens, The Abyss, True Lies, Terminater 1 and 2.
4259;titanic is the best movie about Titanic you'll ever see, mostly for action wise.
4260;I saw an older version and the boat in that sank really fast and looked kinda funny.
4261;Admit it, it is a great film.
4262;One of the Greatest Movies of all time is made even better on Blu Ray.
4263;This movie is packed with extras.
4264;This is my all time favorite movie.
4265;James Cameron is a brilliant director.
4266;Leonardo DiCaprio also delivers an amazing performance.
4267;I watch a lot of movies and this one is still and always will be my favorite!!
4268;like but somehow manages to be more two.
4269;dimensional and is so drawn.
4270;A lookout has spied something huge heaving into view .
4271;the iceberg, the real star of the movie, appearing at last?
4272;"Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), is an artist who loves to draw, is a nice man, and he is also a poor man that wins two tickets to the Titanic, ""This was a ship that was unsinkable."""
4273;Rose is a lady that lets her mother torture her by telling her what to do and her fianc Caledon is a very jealous man.
4274;When Jack took this experience of going into this ship he found love.
4275;"If you get to see this movie you better bring some tissues, because the dialogue will bring you to tears, ""Whatever happens to me Rose, I want you to safe yourself, and I want you to get married, and have lots and lots of kids,"" and Rose says, ""Jack, don't say that I'll never let go of you, you are the most beautiful thing that could ever happen to me, I love you Jack."
4276;a top box office hit for many, many years until Avatar (also directed by Cameron), Titanic sticks to history's facts regarding the tale, but plays us with a love story, as well as statements regarding the aristocracy.
4277;Now simplistically it may be seen as a movie where she meets this great guy and their adventures together.
4278;But the script is a bit more complex than that!Themes:The aristocracy versus the working class is a main theme.
4279;another theme is free spirit.
4280;Jack takes a chance and wins a couple of tickets to the Titanic's maiden voyage.
4281;He and his Italian friend get on board just as the ropes are cast.
4282;finally, the theme of the lower class.
4283;Rose shows Jack high society.
4284;It holds up as well in 2010 as it did in 1997.
4285;But this movie was one of the greatest movies of the 90s.
4286;"Well, ""The Titanic"" was a nice dose of reality."
4287;Not only does it have historical value, but it allows us to meet several people, and it shows us the true horror of people dying.
4288;But he performs his role at least moderately well.
4289;Molly Brown is really likable in her rough but compassionate role.
4290;Calvin may be close to psychotic, but he does carry charm now and then.
4291;Thomas Andrews is especially well done.
4292;He is a very likable character who carries a voice of reason, and shows a memorable sense of honor and integrity.
4293;"The costumes are beautiful
I:30;4294;You are free to disagree with me, but the way I see it is that anytime you have a great story, you need some central focus.
I:30;4295;Moving on, the music is also very well done.
I:30;4296;Overall, this movie has great scenery, wonderful acting, nice music, a strong story, touching characters, historical value, and a high sense of morality.
I:30;4297;Along with """"My Best Friend's Wedding,"""" """"Everafter,"""" and """"Sleeping With the Enemy,"""" this movie is an absolute gotta have!"""
4298;From a guys point of view this is still a very good movie, although yes it definetly is one of the biggest chick flicks.
4299;But this is also a movie about survival and in that guys will find it to be a very good movie.
4300;The visuals of the ship and it going down are incredible, INCREDIBLE, some of the best visuals ever are in this movie, it is only surpassed by LOTR in that area.
4301;Leo and Kate give good performances.
4302;This is my favorite movie of all time, mostly because I'm a huge Titanic buff.
4303;The clarity of this restoration and clarity is mindbogglingly amazing.
4304;The movie provided an excellent cast and crew.
4305;The main guy, Jack Dawson (DiCapprio) wins and aboards the ship in third class.
4306;Now they become extremely attached to one another and here is where the events start to hit the fan.
4307;the effects of the ship sinking are utterly amazing.
4308;The shipwreck of the world's greatest ship.
4309;hi thx Titanic came in a very good conditon very good thx so very much i will shop with u more often
4310;I personally think that this movie is truly a classic.
4311;I loved it and have watched it millions of times (each timed I've both loved it and cried).
4312;The movie was very realistic.
4313;Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet have amazing performaces.
4314;This movie is definatly worth seeing and if you having you should see it as soon as you can!
4315;this is seriously one of the best movies of all time, the story line is excellent, James Cameron is awesome!
4316;Showed what a beautiful environment the ship provided.
4317;It looks great on blue.
4318;Most all know that this is a great movie.
4319;even though there are like 5 hours of stuff it is so worth it!
4320;And it is just fabulous!
4321;Big boat hits iceberg and sinks.
4322;Jack keeps Rose from sinking, again.
4323;Film is received by critics.
4324;I basically have a love it, hate it, relationship with this film.
4325;one of the best movies ever made about the Titanic!
4326;Titanic is the story of Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt.
4327;James Cameron's dazzling spectacle of reinventing the wheel is what Titanic is.
4328;It is beautifully acted, and it is beautifully directed.
4329;It would soon grow hype as the best film of the year and earn more that six hundred million dollars, the highest grossing film of all time, in the Unted States alone and over 1.2 billion dollars worldwide.
4330;This film was the best picture of 1997, winning 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Costume Design, Best Original Song, and best everything else dealing with cinematography and sound, along with visual effects and music scores.
4331;discc set came out on October 25, 2005, leaving Titanic fans, and movie fans, with the collection it well deserves.
4332;The first two discs consists of the wonderfully crafted film and audio cmmentary, along with some featurettes.
4333;THe film is an amazing, dazzling spectacle ehich should be cherished forever and for always.
4334;It is by the far the best film and best picture ever made!
4335;As much as I love Leo and Kate, the ship is the real star here.
4336;titanic is one of my all time faviret love movie storys.
4337;One of the best and got it at a great price.
4338;I watch this movie over and over again.
4339;This allows you to feel like you were on board the RMS Titanic on it's one, and ill.
4340;"Every once in a while the conversation will turn to ""favorite movies."""
4341;I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker.
4342;And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it.
4343;leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful.
4344;Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation.
4345;Kate Winslet was so strong in this film.
4346;The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.
4347;this film is one memorable scene after another.
4348;And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.
4349;James Horner's score was simply perfect.
4350;And the love theme was beautiful and tragic.
4351;The film was made with such humanity.
4352;All the details of the movie are so clear, in beautiful color.
4353;It is a thrilling experience (if BEING on a sinking ship can be described as such).
4354;"released
I:30;4355;This is one of the most beautiful, touching love stories I have ever seen in my life!
I:30;4356;That is why I loved this movie so much!
I:30;4357;This movie is perfect for anybody who has ever lost a person they truly loved.
I:30;4358;that person will always be in your heart.
I:30;4359;it will take your hand and relive your most special moments you shared together on the earth.
I:30;4360;you are here in my heart and my heart will go on.
I:30;4361;Maybe if you keep praying you will be able to find true love one day and will watch the Titanic knowing exactly what it means.
I:30;4362;the outer case has a full leatherette feel, the hubs seat the discs snugly with smooth, rounded edges.
I:30;4363;I will keep this movie in my library forever as it's one of my all time favorites!
I:30;4364;camera's films: beautiful chandeliers, boots lying on the ship's floor, a pair of eye glasses, and a doll is found among other items.
I:30;4365;Eventually a treasure chest is found which leads to a 101 year old woman, who tells an interesting story.
I:30;4366;James Cameron (director), does a subperb job of plotting this amazing love story, no wonder the Titanic won 11 Academy Awards.
I:30;4367;the love story includes the mystery of a blue diamond, 56 carat, heart shaped necklace, worth more than the """"Hope Diamond""""."""
4368;i rate this film a 5.
4369;James Cameron built an exact replica of the original Titanic using all the exquist iron laced work, priceless artwork, exact costumes of the 1912 era, and many other realistic details that helps to draw a person into the story making you feel as if you were on the Titanic at the time it hit the iceberg.
4370;I love this movie so much.
4371;It was very clear and precise.
4372;Always good to watch and now even better in 3.
4373;Best picture, best original song, all that.
4374;Granted, most of it was special effects.
4375;The picture is extremely sharp and the colors are vivid.
4376;The scene with Jack and Rose on the bow of the ship riding the waves into that sunsent.
4377;and it's nice to be able to watch the movie from start to finish on a single disc.
4378;TITANIC is a titanic masterpiece.
4379;director) decided to sink the boat!I also liked the love story.
4380;I thought it was totally convincing that a girl would meet a guy on a two day cruise and love him forever.
4381;the end was also very satisfying dramatic tension.
4382;Don't get me wrong, it was spectacular, but an emotional roller coaster.
4383;With its magnificent production design and beautiful music score, its hard not to be entertained by this mammothly expensive film.
4384;If you really want to see a powerful and heart.
4385;This movie is a must see.
4386;It reminds you of how short life really is and live each day like it's your last.
4387;beautiful love story but harsh reality of how fast one can be taken from you.
4388;After waiting only 4 days I got my order from amazon and I was quite pleased.
4389;Does it still favor its fictional characters over the real life villains and heroes on the ship?
4390;titanic was and remains a really good movie.
4391;The movie is well more than competent, it's shamelessly romantic and, at 3 hours, it all goes by in a flash.
4392;But it's well worth it, as compressing this onto a single disc would have never delivered the flawless picture we get with this blu.
4393;after winning his Best Picture Oscar, James said the theatrical film was for the romantics.
4394;That it focused on the fictional romance between Jack and Rose.
4395;That it would be at least an hour longer and focus on the real life characters.
4396;Leonardo DiCaprio is my life.
4397;It is one of the best movies I've ever seen.
4398;far better than the original release.
4399;It's no surprise that Titanic won 2 Academy Awards including Best Picture!
4400;James Cameron is simply brilliant!
4401;He perfectly combines a true love story with a tragic disaster.
4402;Although over 3 hours long, this movie is so captivating.
4403;The cast is superb with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet giving outstanding performances as Jack and Rose.
4404;The poor guy and the rich girl romance is very touching.
4405;He added so much to this movie.
4406;The movie was perfectly casted and the special effects were bar none.
4407;The first half is a true love story until the unthinkable happens and Titanic hits an iceberg in the North Atlantic.
4408;From that moment on, it's a heart pounding race to see who will survive and who won't.
4409;This is truly a movie that touches you in many ways.
4410;The movie also gave us the beautiful song by Celine Dion.
4411;James Cameron touched everyone's heart from beginning to end.
4412;A true masterpiece that will never be forgotten and will always remain a classic and one of the best films ever made.
4413;Even though this movie is so 1998/1997 it is still a great movie to watch or to have=) The first ever i saw it in theatre's was when i was 11.
4414;and now im 13 and im still a Titanic fan and ever since i heard the song My heart will go on I fell in love with Celine's music.:) She has the voice of an angel!!!!
4415;And since it's popular to do trilogies.
4416;Everyone on the planet knows the story backwards and forwards.
4417;Quit taking life for granted and cherish it!
4418;Nice pack at awesome price.
4419;My whole family loved it
4420;Titanic is my favorite movie.
4421;It's got everything I could ask for: an epic setting, an engrossing romance, and historical resonance.
4422;By now the basic outlines are clear to most people.
4423;The drama builds continuously, even with the end result assured.
4424;Mr. Cameron deserves credit for pulling off such a weighty subject so powerfully.
4425;The model of the ship is quite accurate, with one room having been created from the original blueprints.
4426;deserving of its long runtime, because it accomplishes so much.
4427;The extra features are entertaining.
4428;The movie itself looks brilliant at home.
4429;This film is brilliant and had so much effort put into making it.
4430;james Cameron is on my top 5 favorite director lists along with Spielberg and Ridley Scott of course.
4431;The first time you watch this film it affects you in a huge way.
4432;The song Celine Dion performs well you got to admit your eyes pour out tears when you hear it.
4433;I am a big believer and worshipper of visual and special effects.
4434;The process to making this film look as real as possible is absolutely amazing in its own way.
4435;Hopefully on the bonus features there should be an in depth process on the making of this beautiful ship 'cause you wonder.
4436;Hopefully the transfer is cleaned up a bit so as to have an enjoyable experience watching it.
4437;I always love when there is disc art.
4438;So that sounds good to me.
4439;So basically I encourage anyone out there reading this review to go pick this up in resect to the 100th sinking anniversary of the titanic and for a sureal viewing experience as to delight any viewer who has a love for cinema and its movies as brought forth for the public watching.
4440;The special effects were pretty good, and the details of reconstruction of some of the inanimate objects was remarkable.
4441;It is easy to laugh at the social conventions of 90 years ago.
4442;A good film should let us look critically at contemporary costumes.
4443;i saw this film in a theatre, and I don't feel any need to see it again at home.
4444;But if all you like in a film is to go see some special effects, and saying ooooo.
4445;when the main characters kiss, then this is the film for you.
4446;dollar mark, it announces the apex of its creator and it will never see its equal.
4447;tressed Winslet and the king of heartthrob's DiCaprio both actors from a generation that is known to spend a good chunk of their hard.
4448;a myth, a parable, a metaphor for the ills of mankind.
4449;"It is also a story of faith, courage, sacrifice and, above all else, love."""
4450;kate Winslet was nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Rose Dewitt.
4451;She realizes from the moment she is betrothed that she will marry into a life of tea times, cotillions and the superficial banter of Philadelphia's high society.
4452;Beneath her poised exterior, Rose is a fiery and emancipated soul but the obligation of her marriage and the reassurance of financial security is enforced upon her by her rigid and self.
4453;It isn't love at first sight as one would think, but Rose comes to acknowledge that Jack is a compassionate and chivalrous soul that not only will steal in her heart but will change her life forever.
4454;cameron had several historians on hand for an accurate recreation of the fated vessel and a meticulous team of marine explorers who performed twelve dives to gather footage.
4455;His crack team also recruited several of the companies that had originally furnished the Titanic (carpets, chandeliers) when it began construction in 1908 .
4456;quite a few of the original patterns and designs were still on record.
4457;Kudos to James Horner's haunting and touching score with Norwegian vocalist Sissel Kyrkjebo voicing the lingering and heartrending vocals.
4458;a majority of the key players give admirable performances, Fisher perfectly icy and Zane perfectly snide.
4459;Cameron chose other actors according to their physical countenance, a good deal of them bearing an eerie resemblance to their real.
4460;"I didn't think much of Leonardo DiCaprio as an actor but I thought that his Oscar nomination for ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" had to count for something."
4461;every Tiger Beat vision I had of him pretty much petered out after that.
4462;"Some may scoff at the movie's saccharin premise but ""Titanic"" will remain a well."
4463;Angry that it was so well received at the box office.
4464;It would explain both the film's artlessness and its good fortune.
4465;Hands down the greatest film ever made in history.
4466;Titanic is my favorite movie ever.
4467;It is also the greatest tragedy of the 20th century.
4468;The story line was very clever with the way James cameron put the love story in with the fact that the ship sunk.
4469;that shows just how powerful true love is.
4470;If you love the movie this is the Edition for you.
4471;Tons of great extras and behind the scenes stuff.
4472;Titanic is one of my favorite movies, it explores so many themes and is able to transport its viewer into another world.
4473;Rose is the typical young woman, always wanting something more.
4474;This movie has excellent special effects, a wonderful soundtrack, and the finest cast of actors I've seen in a long time.
4475;This movie stays very true to history, even using common social scenarios (Rose's fianc tries to dominate her) to prove its point.
4476;Titanic (Special Collector's Edition)Really great.
4477;This is not just a great movie.
4478;This is one of the great motion pictures of my lifetime, one of the greatest of the movie sound era.
4479;It has a highly intelligent and very interesting screenplay.
4480;And it has a dream cast who give performances they can all look back on with great, great pride.
4481;it all starts with the writing.
4482;created both as miniature and almost full.
4483;dashing hero, lovely heroine, and dastardly villain.
4484;winning sets and elegant first.
4485;class costumes and breathtakingly beautiful wide.
4486;screen cinematography are stupendous achievements, as is the loveliest of music scores by Oscar winner James Horner.
4487;(The movie won a whopping eleven Oscars, including editing and sound, and was nominated in three other categories.)
4488;The night of the ship's sinking is also done just right and really gets to you emotionally.
4489;These are performances of a lifetime, the type that both talented actors can look back on decades from now with deep pride.
4490;He talks about fanatical realism, safety, but also a lot of movie wizardry with visual effects.
4491;"winning song ""My Heart Must Go On""
I:30;4492;It takes a whole evening and tells you everything you want to know about the making of the film, especially if you play the actual movie with one of the optional commentaries.
I:30;4493;The unforgettable tragic romance between Rose and Jack.
I:30;4494;Maybe more so because the romance is so private and intimate.
I:30;4495;this 1997 masterpiece is a movie to cherish and embrace passionately as the highest pinnacle of movie art and emotional storytelling.
I:30;4496;Most of those scenes have actual value to the movie.
I:30;4497;I guarantee you'd have made a much more enjoyable and more accurate movie to the original Titanic.
I:30;4498;Clearly the story of Rose and Jack was a fantasy love story and brilliantly done but the denial of some of the factual events as well as other scenes important for continuity could have been corrected at long last.
I:30;4499;I think mature audiences would have enjoyed a little more than what this repackaging is.
I:30;4500;Great visuals, a technical achievement.
I:30;4501;Maybe I should give it an extra star for at least sticking to that part of the true story.
I:30;4502;What is amazing is the gullabilty of the American audiences.
I:30;4503;Leo and Kate do a great performance in this movie.
I:30;4504;The special effects were simply great, especially the sinking.
I:30;4505;After seeing it, I started researching on it.
I:30;4506;Anyway, this movie is so very great.
I:30;4507;I was very happy myself when the movie won 11 Academy Awards.
I:30;4508;(I'm only 11) Anyway, this movie is simply great!
I:30;4509;Yes, Titanic is my favorite movie and yes, I do take a great deal of (good.
I:30;4510;i could lie and say my favorite movie is something cool like """"The Matrix"""" or """"Batman"""" (which are among my all."""
4511;time favorites, by the way!)
4512;But there was a time when the WORLD loved this movie and for excellent reasons.
4513;"day epic that can justifiably be compared to classics like ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia""."
4514;Its filled with romance, adventure, tragedy, humanity, etc, in a technically superior production.
4515;Its one of those wonderful times that art and commerce combined into a genuine crowd.
4516;"i look forward to the day when all the closeted Titanic fans can once again say, ""Yes, I love this movie, too!"""
4517;All the other discs that i have plays fine.
4518;If the film was slow at all, the video captures that real well.
4519;a. half are very exciting.
4520;Other than this, the VHS is a truly exciting piece of mainstream entertainment.
4521;Those of you who like romance, excitement, special effects, and, of course, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, will surely love this film.
4522;It will make you laugh, cry, and cheer for the good guy.
4523;"This is the must see edition of an extraordinary film with all the deleted scenes, commentaries, background info., and ""making of"" segments."
4524;"This was and still is an outstanding film that had everything going for it: solid, confident, visionary direction
I:30;4525;boggling special effects"
4526;this film excels at every level and it was a crime that the elderly retired actress, Gloria Stuart, who played Rose at nearly 100 lost as best supporting actress that year.
4527;As blockbusters go, Titanic is a good one.
4528;A certain amount of melodrama is expected for such a story, and it is done so well in this movie.
4529;There is a fine love story which also touches on class issues.
4530;"I'm sure we've all heard this line about the great movies of the past, ""Gone With the Wind"" etc, but Titanic is a lot like those classics."
4531;Adventure, romance, humor, desperate times, heroes, villans, and damsels in distress, it's got it all and it delivers.
4532;We all truly enjoyed this movie!
4533;leonardo gives a very spirited performance as Jack.
4534;He was in my opinion, the soul of the movie.
4535;He made it fun, exciting, and uplifting.
4536;kate Winslet was also very good.
4537;I thought her best performances were in the beginning of the movie when she was fighting against herself, but she was very good in the rest as well.
4538;what really surprised me about this movie was the performance of the supporting cast.
4539;scenes that I found incredulous:In the beginning of the movie after Titanic had just taken off Jack and friends are roaming around the top deck exploring the ship.
4540;There are a few people walking along the top deck with them.
4541;Some of the most richest and most powerful people in society were on her.
4542;please bear in mind that I'm being nitpicky.
4543;But the movie itself is definitely worth watching.
4544;It greatly added to the story.
4545;Still a well told film with excellent acting and beautiful cinematography.
4546;Titanic is about the idea that love conquers death.
4547;It demonstrates this idea with a love story between Jack and Rose that has its ups and downs but is sealed with Rose's decision to stay on the sinking ship and risk death rather than escape the Titanic alone.
4548;Rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot Titanic sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of Jack.
4549;the story's focus stays true to the main love and escape plots that constitute the idea that love conquers death (love endures despite and because of Jack's death).
4550;This doesn't prove it's a masterpiece or even a good film.
4551;If anything, it just proves that a pretty face sells to teeny.
4552;Next they'll be declaring the Backstreet Boys one of the best bands ever.
4553;I highly recommend the movie .
4554;The love story (most of the first half) and dialogue have garnered much criticism, and for that I shall take away a star.
4555;but everything involving the great ship sinking is magnificent.
4556;"love story to take place at this time
I:30;4557;The special effects are top notch"
4558;"The sound is riveting
I:30;4559;But the brilliance of the movie lies in Cameron's picture of humanity.
I:30;4560;Some choose to spend their last minutes with their loved ones.
I:30;4561;Some continue their passion for music until the eleventh hour.
I:30;4562;He shows the dark side of humanity as well.
I:30;4563;Along with this expert treatment, he employs the right camera shots and music to complement the action.
I:30;4564;The sinking of the ship is truly awesome, in the inspiring awe sense of the word.
I:30;4565;The second half of the movie more than makes up for the first half.
I:30;4566;I liked it a lot it is a classic!
I:30;4567;Great love story and history is also included
I:30;4568;That movie is also GREAT!
I:30;4569;Finally, last night, I felt like seeing it, to see what the hype was all about (also I am out of Fredric March movies right now!)
I:30;4570;there was more decency, more class, something.
I:30;4571;honestly, it distracted me a lot during the movie!
I:30;4572;And a good film is supposed to get you into the heart of the characters, and get you caring for them.
I:30;4573;Better writing would have helped here.
I:30;4574;believe me, you CAN enjoy a film without everyone speaking gutter language.
I:30;4575;kate was beautiful, but noone but her husband and doctor need to see it!
I:30;4576;it seemed just a lust thing, a heat of the moment thing, a """"let's do this because it's exciting"""" thing."""
4577;A man who really loves will wait to be married before becoming physically one with her.
4578;i think the filming was pretty good.
4579;there were some good visual moments.
4580;I think it was an awsome task to film some of the scenes in this film, and the Oscars won I am sure are very well deserved.
4581;Its scope and ambition is so far beyond what most films ever attempt .
4582;and it succeeds on so many levels .
4583;The personal story of the girl who's looking for meaning in her life and the guy who helps her find it before they're both caught in unimaginable tragedy is something we all can relate to.
4584;is one of the finest and most exciting sequences I've ever seen.
4585;See it and revel in another time and another place.
4586;my favorite movie of all times.
4587;you cant help but love him.
4588;This has always been one of my favorite movies and I was so happy when I got it on the mail!
4589;This is a movie everyone must own!
4590;I thought it was fantastic.
4591;I got more than my moneys worth.
4592;Enjoyed the movie and the special features disc
4593;Billy Zane plays the other corner of this triangle as a total jerk (but he looks good!)
4594;, and for a good portion of the movie, we see the development of this romance between Winslet the society girl and DiCaprio the street urchin with perfect teeth.
4595;the best part of this movie is probably the last hour.
4596;The special effects are amazing as we watch the Titanic sink in perfect recreation of the real, horrifying event.
4597;i would have given this movie three stars if I were rating cinematography, costume design, and special effects, but those three things do not make a good movie.
4598;As a history buff, seeing the disaster recreated so beautifully and accurately was a treat.
4599;truth be told, the acting is good, so that earned it one star at least.
4600;It has something for everyone .
4601;romance, drama, action, likable characters and very moving music.
4602;And I was very pleased to say the least.
4603;as for the Extras, they are great and very informative for those interested in the history behind it and what went on Behind.
4604;after 8 years this movie has not lost anything, it is still compelling and moving me to tears.
4605;Long but still really good.
4606;It has a lot of action in the end and is a huge emmy award.
4607;Kind of sad and is fun to watch.
4608;It was a huge dissaster and is remembered after all these years.
4609;Those two love bugs are a perfect match.
4610;A lot of romance and action this movie is for YOU!
4611;I do like this movie and when it came out, I saw it 4 times in the theater.
4612;"Yes, there is a fictional love story between Jack and Rose and the all too familiar love triangle, but really the human characters are there to ""show off the ship""."
4613;Bare with me a moment, and I'll try to make this statement clear.
4614;"Watch the movie without really focusing on the actual human characters (especially the ""fictional"" ones)."
4615;look past them and you will notice that the scenes occur all over the ship.
4616;Also note, the fictional characters encounter many real characters .
4617;The viewers are given glimpses of these people and those are the ones we truly connect with .
4618;THOSE are the moments of real emotional connections.
4619;"The ""fictional"" characters move through the ship and past the real characters to reveal ""their"" story (if you look for it), and that is why I really like this movie."
4620;"Watch it, and look for the little stories that happen behind the ""romance"" and I think you'll ""get it""."
4621;"Yes, the line that Paxton says at the end is ""corny"", but in a way, it is true."
4622;The casting was great, I believe the actors did a good job.
4623;The theme song was perfect, depicting a love not everyone is favored to find in life.
4624;The historical sense was wonderful, and reminded us that so many people, loved by someone somewhere, lost their lives.
4625;Technology has made great strides in ship construction, and the Titanic played a great part in it.
4626;Titanic is really a great movie but the media around it has somehow turned it in more than just a film.
4627;Honeslty, the scenario is not so good, just a very classic routine love story but it takes place in the most desperates hours of maritime history, and that's what makes it so extraordinary: its EMOTIONAL IMPACT.
4628;This movie moves you and touches you very much, and that's the very essence of cinema isn't it: making you feel touched and feel emotion ?
4629;The greatest movie of all time.
4630;It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again.
4631;i bought it as a gift.
4632;it's a classic for the ages
4633;behind the scenes information you can hope for.
4634;one of the greatest movies of all time!
4635;There is also an alternative ending for those of you into that sort of thing.
4636;I love this movie it is the best and Jack and rose are like the best and at the end is really sad:(
4637;Absolutely Love this movie, had to get it!
4638;it came on time and in perfect condition.
4639;The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think.
4640;It was the greatest love story ever attempted.
4641;It made an extravagant amount of money at the box office in every civilized country on the planet and became one of the highest grossing films of all time.
4642;It was amazing how quickly this beautiful story just flowed perfectly,and the 3 hours and 15 minutes just flew by.
4643;I've always enjoyed period pieces and this was such a fabulous step back in time, Kate Winslet looked magnificent in every scene.
4644;"Although I'm sure James Cameron was not one of the nicest directors, during the shooting of this epic masterpiece, he truly deserved feeling like ""THE KING OF THE WORLD"" after winning the academy awards for Best Director and Best Picture."
4645;always comfortable to watch and never hurt my eyes or head.
4646;Better colors, VFX and even sounds.
4647;The movie is great but what really impressed me was Amazon's customer service.
4648;I am very impressed with them and this is the type of customer service that keeps me renewing my Prime membership year after year.
4649;This is a timeless, classic film that will never get old.
4650;I remember the first time a saw this movie when I was younger and it's still just as great!
4651;Titanic is one of the beloved movies of all time!
4652;It's awesome and romantic in almost every single way possible!
4653;It dares to take chances and create a great romance story that will leave women (and men) crying once the movie is over.
4654;the CGI is beyond amazing and the design of the ship is beyond legendary!
4655;But the best part of the movie is that the romance is beyond romantic and beautiful!
4656;James Cameron definitely knows how to create a movie and make it looks so good.
4657;titanic is worth the time and money!
4658;i love the movie, by the way.
4659;I thought this movie was great and one of the best that I have seen.
4660;I'm a guy and dont care too much for Leo but I thought he did a great job as part of this movie.
4661;It showed the love that these two human beings had, and the ending is so breath taken that you will be on the edge of your seat.
4662;Titanic was the best movie I ever seen.
4663;It was a romantic and full of action movie.
4664;In the meantime of their passionate love affair her fiance gave her a heart shaped necklace known as The Heart Of The Ocean .
4665;Oh my what a movie!I absolutely love this movie and have watched it many times, never tiring of seeing it.
4666;it is one of my all time favorite love stories.
4667;Titanic has gone on to become a blockbuster movie, heavily regarded as the greatest film ever made.
4668;"Nominated for 14 Academy Awards (tying with ""All About Eve"") and winning 11 including Best Picture and Best Director for Canadian born James Cameron, ""Titanic"" is also known for the beautiful theme song ""My Heart Will Go On"" performed by Celine Dion that won four Grammys."
4669;The special effects are the best of any film, the acting and writing are excellent, and Cameron's direction is exceptional.
4670;For a 3 hour plus film the movie captures your attention from the beginning until the end credits roll.
4671;The movie itself was like a welcome home to a good friend, a true classic!
4672;Great visuals are punctuated by opaque characters who act badly (on many levels) mouthing a stupid screenplay (you gettin' this Cameron?)
4673;d. Only two stars were given for the upgrade in Cameron's effort and there are a few good scenes.
4674;shoulder shots, images which focused on a character in the middle, the closer objects are excessively blurred.
4675;A normalcy and it's professional photography when seen in 2.
4676;d because it helps the filmographer steer his audience to a the subject matter.
4677;I never found it to hurt the eyes and this technique works well with 2.
4678;Actually, closer images should be sharper in real life world.
4679;d depth and combine it into 3.
4680;there are good scenes, I must say.
4681;my equipment used is moderately new, both last year's (2011) with high regard.
4682;I've seen great results with other materiel using this same setup.
4683;i'm glad I bought this movie, though.
4684;d herein, I'll now look forward to something else better.
4685;The fans sometimes oppose the producer's changes.
4686;Romance, action, tragedy, noble characters and great effects.
4687;This movie has it all in abundance.
4688;A little love story is fine, but why over do it?
4689;Titanic may not have the most original script in all of history, but at least its plot is kept simple and easy to follow while visuals and performance are given all of the focus and treatment.
4690;The romance is still presented in a marvelous way, and it's what I walk away from the film remembering, even though I went into it for the fancy 1900's era visuals.
4691;the only thing that bothers me about the success of Titanic is it gives Roger Corman more credit than he already has in the film industry for giving Cameron his big break.
4692;Rich, snobby white girl meets poor, grubby creep, sees the good in him, rejects her good.
4693;She becomes a promiscuous tramp, and she does it for love.
4694;i find it interesting that evidenced by this movies' stunning box.
4695;A girl meets a guy, has a good time, decides that she likes him, strips for him, gets horny, and the next thing you know they are having sex in the back seat of a car .
4696;It must have been true love, because we have a necklace to prove it.
4697;It MUST be true love.
4698;All men I know who have seen it did it as a favor to their significant other.
4699;They watched a chick flick to keep their woman happy.
4700;As an actor, he truly did an outstanding job in that movie.
4701;my recommendation: Watch a documentary about the Titanic instead.
4702;It will be much more interesting, minus the sleaze.
4703;Jack's rescue of Rose from the latter's attempted suicide, for instance, strives for amusing, unexpected absurdity as Jack manages to interject with a brief lecture on ice.
4704;If he can't be credited with decent writing, though, he certainly gets the thumbs up for storytelling instincts.
4705;It's a genuine fortune, for example, that Brock's Epiphany didn't end up as the movie's conclusion.
4706;several elements save the movie, though, and one of them is good acting, particularly from Kate Winslet.
4707;eyed and surprised at horse.
4708;it is the main narrative.
4709;Of course, there are supporting performances that contribute fruitfully to the telling of her story, and when actors like Kathy Bates, Gloria Stuart (who gets the most contemplative and well.
4710;sketching alone would have become one of the most original love scenes ever), Cameron's occasional knack for nuance helps the movie along as well.
4711;Other times he does it with James Horner's wonderful score.
4712;Notably, Rose's suicide scene is graced by a simple piece of music that strikes gently yet unflinchingly at the core of her plight.
4713;As she clambers over the rear of the ship, we hear Sissel hauntingly singing a poignant lament for Rose.
4714;Setting this scene to that piece of music is an example of sheer observance and sensitivity, as, with so many contemporary movies choosing to depict suicide as an act of angst or rashness, or even a bargaining tool to make a point, it becomes so easy for audiences to forget the fundamental sadness of the act.
4715;Cameron knows his way about bringing an audience through a great course of emotion, which in no small part is attributable to his ability to entertain.
4716;as a love story, it is so wonderful only because he died.
4717;Ignore that trite, cliched relationship and enjoy the stunning cinematics and attention to detail that will ensure that this film remains a classic.
4718;One of the most epic and monumental productions ever attempted, Titanic soared to the top of the box office charts in 1997.
4719;"Winning 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, this grandiose film often takes a lot of heat for catering too much to female crowds, a. k. a. the ""chick flick""."
4720;brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and his crew of deep.
4721;"When they discover a drawing of a beautiful young woman (Kate Winslet) wearing the ""Heart of the Ocean"" diamond, the jewel they've been hunting for, they announce it on the news."
4722;Rose, now a 101 year old lady comes forward to claim ownership of the drawing.
4723;Their love is consubstantial to many on.
4724;screen romances, considering that the boy is poor and the girl is rich.
4725;making power, and Jack as the street.
4726;smart, carefree, live by the moment scoundrel.
4727;The love story is essentially a fairy tale, complete with every character you'd expect to see in such a fantasy.
4728;The captain (Bernard Hill) and the steerage band convey more convincing emotion with little more than glances and stares.
4729;what Cameron does still demonstrate admirably is his handling of suspense, and he masterfully shows chaos and panic as the ship begins to sink.
4730;Great music, seamless special effects and contrasting characters add to the thrills .
4731;But if anything though it still remains a satisfying film.
4732;the chase through the sinking ship with gunplay is silly and detracts from the epic tragedy going on above deck.
4733;but TITANIC is without a doubt a triumph of filmmaking and production design.
4734;and it took a forceful, dynamic filmmaker like James Cameron to pull this off.
4735;(besides Highlander 2 being #1 on my list for disapointments) I compare this movie to a mondern day Gone with the wind !
4736;Even on a television, the special effects are finely detailed and convincing, specifically in reference to the end of the film where the ship breaks apart.
4737;looking guys and stereotypically good.
4738;One should probably be happy they at least get that.
4739;If you want to find out about the the Titanic, go watch one of the fantastic documentaries available.
4740;But at least those special effects were good!
4741;Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate are always phenomenal in their roles.
4742;Cameron has to be one of the best directors of all times.
4743;d due to the reviews I've read .
4744;d movies I own, this is one of the best use of the 3.
4745;Many of the shots are just breath taking.
4746;Both parts are about as good as it gets.
4747;This for me is a real keeper.
4748;One note , the first time I went to watch it, it began freezing on parts of disc 1.
4749;He's done some really entertaining work, Aliens and True Lies come to mind.
4750;Titanic is an epic movie that has something everyone can enjoy or at least find interesting.
4751;If your not busy gazing at the special affects and beautiful majestery of the ship, then your being captivated by the performances by Kate and that one guy.
4752;I loved one review where someone mentioned Leonardo DiCrapio?
4753;The music is also moving.
4754;Yeah right, I don't think so!
4755;All and all, it was a compelling drama with that great Celine song forever linked to the movie.
4756;A stunning achievement in every aspect.
4757;This movie deserves a place among the classics.
4758;Do so with an open mind!
4759;Great story, great acting and the dfx are wonderful.
4760;"I recall feeling so strongly positive towards only two other films in my life, after seeing them initially, and those moments were after seeing ""Apocalypse Now"" back in 1980 and ""Close Encounters"" back in 1977."
4761;And at a great Amazon price.
4762;"for all of its hype, awards, and budget (over $200 million), in many ways, this is a very ""personal"" film from director James Cameron (Terminator 2, The Abyss, Aliens, etc.), and never do the eye."
4763;"popping special effects (of which there are plenty) get in the way of the very special adventure and exquisite and deep ""love story"" being told."
4764;Add the two together, and what you've basically got is over three hours of absolutely spellbinding entertainment.
4765;My only purpose is to present my astonishment in this work, how like the original Apocalypse Now and Close Encounters (and a few other top ten films on my list including 2001, The Apartment, The Music Man, etc.), this is basically just a perfect Hollywood film, frame to frame, and scene to scene.
4766;It really does seem as if every piece of film, every scene, was carefully shot and edited in as exacting, interesting, accurate, involving, and exhilarating manner as possible.
4767;the movie is fascinating and completely involving from start to finish and even its three hour plus length is something almost unnoticed.
4768;The characters, the suspense, the beauty of the cinematography and sets, the great acting by the leads, and the lavish and achingly romantic triumphs and tragic story themes explored throughout are all first rate.
4769;"And they only bring to mind just a few adjectives I can only think of when recommending with five stars (though it deserves ten) this masterpiece, ""extraordinary,"" ""spectacular,"" ""breathtaking,"" and simply unforgettable."
4770;"fashioned (and done before), ""love story."""
4771;i have a feeling it will be many more years before we see such cinematic gold like this again from the studio system.
4772;Titanic is, in the highest sense of the word, not merely great entertainment throughout, but great ART.
4773;This is a treasured gem, more valuable in spirit than the heart.
4774;"True love is invaluable and ""goes on."""
4775;A transcendent classic, and an undeniable must.
4776;I've always loved this movie ever since it was first released back in 1996.
4777;glad somebody finally got their act together and was finally able to put it all one side of one disk.
4778;that makes it a thousand times better!
4779;On the plus side, it is cool that I can immediately access a movie, but I also encountered some issues that make it less than what I expected.
4780;I'd prefer to be able to resize manually to fit my screen as I need.
4781;Amazon suggested I restart and see if that fixes it.
4782;Titanic is a wonderful movie.
4783;In a time of cynicism it is heart.
4784;Millions of people connected with this movie, making it, deservedly, the biggest movie in history.
4785;Ignore those idiots and enjoy this grand spectacle in the style of classic Hollywood epics.
4786;this film is brilliant in EVERY way.
4787;Acting, music, technically, just in every way.
4788;It richly deserved its 11 oscars.
4789;day audiences with a story they can relate to and helps them appreciate the scope of the tragedy as never before.
4790;Forget your cynicism and get caught up in a very touching story set against the backdrop of one of the most enduring tragedies of all time.
4791;The sinking is especially well filmed, with awesome special effects and presented so realistically that you will feel like you are on the ship.
4792;long after the films obnoxious little detractors have grown old and silent this film will stand as a testament to great and enduring film making.
4793;My wifes favorite movie, so I could not pass it up!
4794;I'm happy as long as she don't make me watch it!
4795;This movie is a beautiful movie with great emotion, love and actionscenes (The sinking of the ship)Leonardo DiCaprio is good in his rol and plays his part perfect.
4796;kate Winslet also plays a great part.
4797;the love story is perfectly worked out and gives you a great love feeling.You also get to understand how it was to live on that ship for a long time.
4798;One, I forgot how much I got attached to Jack and Rose and even Cal too.
4799;I want that extra footage.
4800;There was a whole lot more shot than was actually shown, and its high time we got a criterion.
4801;What I didn't expect was a added bonus.
4802;the Titanic is a great,great movie !!
4803;For every guy who dreamed of being a hero to the woman he loved.
4804;this is the movie,for every guy who dreamed of the woman he loved to go beyond proving her love for him.
4805;"This is one of those ""WOW"" movies I sometimes talk about when I describe the emotions some of us feel when we're finished watching a great film."
4806;All that you honestly do while watching this movie is wait two and a half hours only to see everyone die.
4807;The direction, script, acting and music!
4808;I loved the movie and with the added special features it is well worth the value.
4809;My boy loves the Titanic story and everything about the ship.
4810;I watched this movie and really enjoyed it.
4811;It was quite a long movie, but you don't realize it while you're watching it because the storyline is so compelling.
4812;The wonderful special effects make it seem so realistic.
4813;Computer animation was well done.
4814;I was, as most women who watched the movie, emotionally touched and moved when the story came to a close.
4815;wrenching all at the same time.
4816;titanic is the best i seen!
4817;the fact that some of the footage was of the actual sunken ship added to the initial impact of the movie.
4818;When watching the movie, you feel like you are on TITANIC as you witness the beautiful woodwork, carpet and clothing of that time.
4819;The acting was overall a success.
4820;Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were excellent and you get a general idea of their personalities.
4821;This includes, nudity, sexuality, and language.
4822;For these reasons, I recommend that you have the fast.
4823;forward button handy during family viewing of this movie.
4824;This movie was excellent, but could have been even better if these scenes had been omitted.
4825;enjoy this movie with your family, but keep that remote handy.:)
4826;One of the best movies ever, made in my opinion.
4827;It's great story telling aided by amazing graphics (for 1997).
4828;this edition is as good as any until a Blu Ray version comes out.
4829;Included all the extras and nice case!
4830;The price was good too!
4831;This lamentable piece of 3hour.
4832;One star for the fact that it ended.
4833;every time it holds up to its reviews.
4834;this is one of my top 10 movies ever.
4835;Titanic is a great movie with wonderful actors and actresses.
4836;It is the highest grossing movie ever, with the highest groosing soundtrack of all time!
4837;Kate Winslet is just stunning as her role as Rose.
4838;This is a very impressive collection of bonus features.
4839;One of the greatest movies ever made.
4840;I promise you,you will be so happy you did.
4841;Everyone loved this movie when it first came out, but then came the gargantuan profits and the boatload (pardon the pun) of Oscars.
4842;And these were the people who in the beginning loved it, cried over it, and went to see a second and third time.
4843;The acting is above average for the most part, the special effects are great, and the mood is perfectly set.
4844;This movie, especially in the last hour, is all about the mood.
4845;Then, possibly, you'll see why some of us still love it and why so many millions of people loved it in the beginning.
4846;So many other reviewers have already done it pretty darn good.
4847;however, I can tell you that I wholeheartedly enjoyed this motion picture.
4848;An absolutely great picture that is a must see.
4849;This is a movie to own!
4850;This movie is AWESOMELY amazing, and you would be a complete and utter idiot for even thinking otherwise.
4851;the most memorable thing about this movie was the Celine Dionne song.
4852;Great movie with lots of extras to view, James Camerons movie is well worth watching over and over.
4853;Especially all the work he went thru too bring us this wonderful, true, exciting story.
4854;I could watch it over and over and our guests really enjoyed it as well.
4855;A lot of people like this film because of the romance in it.
4856;Other's enjoy it because of the music and some because of the historical value of the sinking of the Titanic.
4857;After winning a trip on the RMS Titanic during a dockside card game, American Jack Dawson spots the society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater who is on her way to Philadelphia to marry her rich snob fiance Cal Hockley.
4858;This movie is a truly impressive feat of entertainment.
4859;I loved this movie and saw it a million times in theatres.
4860;Special features would also be a nice touch.
4861;Lets treat it with some respect.
4862;Writer Directer James Cameron has, against all odds, come up with an old fashioned style classic in the oft told tale of the sinking of the ''ultimate'' luxury liner.
4863;leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are perfectly cast as the vulnerable young lovers from opposite ends of the social strata who find true passion before the ship inevitably collides with an iceberg.
4864;as Gone with the wind and Casablanca, Titanic manages to set a touching story against a cataclsmic backdrop to touch on universal emotions and timeless grace.
4865;I love in a movie the story and the drama but this one it bring sadness at the end because it's base on a real event were people lost their lives.
4866;Kate Winslet it's superb in this movie she shows character, sadness, courage and fear.
4867;All those emotions throughout the movie making it entertainment and suspenseful like the rest of the cast.
4868;This movie went in theaters when I was seventeen and now that I bought it, bring me good memories.
4869;I recommend this movie if you like drama and a special love story.
4870;I have owned many copies of Titanic over the years and this release is by far the best looking and sounding version that I have seen.
4871;The new extra material was also very good.
4872;This is a really great movie.
4873;They would make millions and please many fans my self include.
4874;So please if you have any power what so ever in this matter please convince someone that this a good idea.
4875;please help mefrom a desparte Titanic fan
4876;"Upon discovery of a safe, ""Brock"" reveals a sketch of a young woman wearing the necklace."
4877;"upon arrival to the ""Brocks"" vessel, ""Rose"" identifies herself as the woman in the sketch and beings to reveal her accounts and secrets of the voyage."
4878;this film takes us back and forth from 1912 to present day.
4879;"Rose's story begins when she, as a young woman accompanies her wealthy obnoxious fianc , ""Cal Hockley"" (Billy Zane) and her socialite mother ""Ruth De Witt Bukater"" (Frances Fisher) aboard the Titantic on it's maiden voyage from Ireland to America."
4880;"Jack sees what is about to happen and rescues ""Rose"" from ending her life."
4881;The two find an attraction to one another and steal time away to be together.
4882;"Jack talks about living live to it's fullest and ""making it count""."
4883;The two are captivated by one another and fall madly in love.
4884;"Rose climbs on the board while holding onto ""Jack's"" hand as he floats in the icy water."
4885;"As they float waiting for the rescue team, ""Jack"" forces ""Rose"" to promise that she will fight to stay alive and to never let go."
4886;this epic offers a love story and drama along with the excitement of exploration.
4887;Costing $200 million to make, James Cameron does an outstanding job of taking us back to April 15, 1912 during the first and final voyage of the Titantic while entertaining us with a love story, that who knows, may have truly happened.
4888;This movie came out when I was a senior in high school, and it was the theme of our prom that year.
4889;The scenery, the sets, the lavish costumes, the music, oh the romance!
4890;I love this movie from start to finish.
4891;If you haven't seen it, give it a chance!
4892;This is a great movie which is going to become a great American classics movie.
4893;This is a good movie to watch as a family.
4894;I am quite disappointed this is an Oscar movie.
4895;What annoys me most about the film is that they have taken a historical event which is, by its very nature, set at an historical period.
4896;This is an overrated film, and would someone mind telling me just what women see in Mr De Caprio!
4897;Lindsay Gibbs does a brilliant job in her conception of the two main characters.
4898;Helen, the love of Behr's life is a truly memorable character.
4899;Beautifully written, A Must ReadDB WASHINGTON DC
4900;But we got the Terminators, Aliens, The Abyss and other works like the screenplay of Strange Days to remember him.
4901;this is and unfortunatelly unfurgettable movie of an unknown hollywood Director that call himself the King of the World.
4902;This film deserves all it Awards.
4903;Kate Winslet is simply excellent and a beauty as Rose DewittBeckhater and of course the irresistable Leonardo DiCaprio as poor man Jack Dawson.
4904;Action, tears, drama, laughs, romance.
4905;An unpredictable movie you'll want to watch over and over again.
4906;But the added clarity of the Blu.
4907;The first part of the film in particular, when the submersibles are searching the wreck, the added depth is incredible.
4908;"I found myself saying ""wow"" outloud numerous times."
4909;This is a GREAT transfer!
4910;And for us audiophiles it is a real treat as well.
4911;ends of James Horner's orchestrations to the ship breaking up around you it is bliss to the ears.
4912;Even the subtle rumble of the ship's engines in the background is sweet.
4913;There is an added bonus after all of the credits: You'll be treated to an extended THX logo theme that will shake your house to it's foundation.
4914;This is a PERFECT showcase for a nice sound system.
4915;Titanic is one of my favorite movies of all time.
4916;I have seen this movie 10 times in theaters and I have seen this movie about four times at home.
4917;James Cameron delivers a classic and one of the best films of all.
4918;I love the story in the movie.
4919;The special effects are amazing and a groundbreaking film and the one of only three movies to win 11 Oscars.
4920;i love Titanic and it is a classic movie.
4921;If it had another male lead who was totally ugly and charmless I would have still loved this movie.
4922;Even though I'm a soppy romantic and love the romance part of the movie (I know a thousand people will now hate me for admitting this) the historic part is exremly interesting.
4923;Titanic is one of these movies.
4924;When the movie first came out, I suddenly fell in love with the legend of Titanic and actually collected loads of facts.
4925;Making people happy and/or sad and being an enjoyable pastime.
4926;Because that's what Titanic is for me.
4927;i view the movie great, the service is of purchasing is good.
4928;The story of the Titanic was a mysterious and tragic classic.
4929;Director of Aliens (the second of the series, and arguably, the best out of the series), the classic epic.
4930;the Abyss (absolutely beautiful, and excellently written and played), and both Terminator and Terminator 2 .
4931;the first few scenes in the movie are thoroughly enjoyable, and I found myself thinking that this had the potential to be one of the greatest movies EVER.
4932;I would recommend this movie just for that (the other half.
4933;I will draw kudos to the Oscar Nominating Committee for leaving DiCaprio out.
4934;The flashbacks only got a little better, but the last couple of scenes (including the last couple scenes of the flashback) were wonderful.
4935;but like I said, the scenes with the old woman and the cinematography are sublimely beautiful.
4936;The most successful movie of all time?
4937;The special effects are cool, but it's Kate Winslet that makes this film phenomenal.
4938;No film will ever match the appeal, the unique flavour of this movie.
4939;so why is such a film with glaring inaccuracies so successful and sometimes poignant?
4940;The answer lies in the way Cameron strangely mixes in moments of genuine poignancy, loss, and respect for the Titanic dead.
4941;Unlike other films, he shows real respect for old people and shows everyone the beautiful young woman lurking beneath an aged crone's face.
4942;he starts the film showing a decayed, ugly, broken down ship and flips back to reveal how beautiful the Titanic was in her youth.
4943;Cameron's willingness to capture what it really feels to lose someone through death or through age is what makes the film powerful.
4944;"good"" films, Titanic doesn't stint on the tragedy and finds beauty and meaning in death and even ugliness."
4945;he draws pictures of an old lady wearing a moth.
4946;eaten coat, waiting for her love to show up, and a one.
4947;It used special effects to capture the loss of a great tragedy, and did this so well people were willing to overlook the more stupider aspects of the screenway.
4948;The special effects are unforgettable.
4949;however, the movie is enjoyable and somewhat likeable.
4950;"The first two discs of this new edition show the film itself so that the best sound and resolution are possible
I:30;4951;Clarity of sound and picture, together with the extras explaining how it was made, makes this """"Titanic"""" the one to own."""
4952;budget version using modern movie magic, even a replica of the giant ship itself, was highly anticipated, hugely lucrative and received numerous awards.
4953;Titanic focuses on a romance between an uppity poor boy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and unhappy rich girl (Kate Winslet), her snobbish mother, and the society cad (Billy Zane) she wants for her daughter.
4954;still, there is likeable work from DiCaprio and Winslet (she got the Oscar nod he should have had.)
4955;"Kathy Bates is a natural ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown and Victor Garber is touchingly bewildered as the ship architect."
4956;Sinking the unsinkable is partly CGI rendered in harrowing detail.
4957;Beautiful love story intermixed with the drama of the Titanic sinking.
4958;It tells a tale of the passage of the Titanic and the possibilities of what happened on the ship after hitting the iceberg.
4959;I realize that some people critique this movie for creating a fictional couple and focusing the movie on them, but in my view, this is what makes the movie so great.
4960;This is an epic movie which people will enjoy for decades to come, just like Gone with the Wind.
4961;I am happy now to have this blu ray in my movie collection.
4962;In my opinion this is the best movie of all the times.
4963;I super strongly recommend this movie if you haven't seen it.
4964;Of course, the movie is a classic!
4965;art digital effects to bring the epic story to life keeps edging over budget and running behind.
4966;The film surprisingly wins an Academy Award for Best Picture among a slew of other awards, faces a critical drubbing in the press and manages to become one of the highest grossing films of all time.
4967;Still with an appealing cast, epic story chronicling the sinking of the unsinkable luxury liner R. m. s. Titanic in 1912 it seemed worth the gamble.
4968;On board at the time was the stunning Hope diamond a priceless piece of jewelry that has been missing since the ship went down.
4969;The itinerant Dawson wins two tickets on the luxury liner in a card game and looks forward to returning to America after years abroad.
4970;Released for the first time in anamorphic widescreen, receives a magnificent transfer here spreading the movie over two discs allowing for as much breathing space for the video and audio as possible.
4971;The contrast is exceptional and although there is grain noticeable in the image that's to be expected since the original film itself demonstrated grain in its theatrical run.
4972;Titanic provides a visually stunning picture with a state.
4973;Titanic also offers a wide range of audio options as well.
4974;There's an excellent Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo soundtrack as well as an exceptional Dolby Digital 5.1 EX and stunning DTS 6.1 ES soundtrack.
4975;although most of the extras are confined to the third disc there are also quite a few interesting extras on disc 1 and 2 which primarily focus on the movie itself.
4976;scenes option that allows you to view footage from the production of the film.
4977;You can also view these bits separately as well.
4978;it's the ORIGINAL ending for the film.
4979;It's fascinating to watch because even if you have been in film production the scope of the sets build is staggering.
4980;"Cameron provides commentary on the ""Deep Dive"" that he did in 1995 for the footage of the real Titanic."
4981;It's eerie and fascinating and Cameron's comments are pretty interesting as well.
4982;It's as close as we'll ever discover what it felt light to walk through the actual Titanic.
4983;Visual Effects provides a breakdown of the shot in the engine room using both miniatures and full scale parts.
4984;It includes all the individual elements used to make up the sequence including real footage, large scale miniature and digital effects along with the full scale footage shot on a green screen stage.
4985;We get to see how the final sequence was put together as well.
4986;It's a marvelous example of how the visual effects created the illusion we see in the final footage.
4987;It's a brilliant and seamless optical.
4988;"Finally ""Titanic Sinking Simulation"" takes us through the the various stages of completed CGI that were combined to give the sinking sequence its powerful impact."
4989;"Stills Gallery includes the ""Titanic Scriptment"" which allows you to read Cameron's script."
4990;Photographs covers the deep dive that Cameron did as well as photos from the model shop and even includes the extras' scrapbook with photos of the extras during production as well as behind.
4991;These wonderfully detailed collection of 82 paintings clearly inspired Cameron's attention to detail in the film.
4992;It's pretty clear why the scenes weren't put into the movie but many still have value and will be appreciated by fans of the movie.
4993;"Marketing includes the ""Fox Special: Breaking New Ground"" which was produced as a promotional tie in to the movie."
4994;"I believe this played on the ""MTV Movie Awards""."
4995;It's a very funny sequence and can be accessed by clicking down to the main menu and then clicking right.
4996;There were a lot of bodies that were discovered with guns on them.
4997;Covering everything from the actor's preparation for the film (from reading books about the incident to talking with historians) to production details (producer Jon Landau provides a unique perspective since he is both a producer and a director), it's equally as fascinating as Cameron's track or the one done by the historians.
4998;most of the commentary tracks have enough new information to keep each one interesting on its own.
4999;It's amazing how accurate Cameron's film is.
5000;Far from the usual dry historical commentaries, it's a wonderfully articulate track.
5001;It's filled with wonderful behind.
5002;scenes footage, photos, production art, featurettes and commentary tracks.
5003;The two disc presentation of the movie has better clarity, remarkable detail and color when compared to the previous single disc edition of the movie.
5004;This is one that you'll definitely want if you're a fan of the movie.
5005;The new revamped version of Titanic is as great as it ever was and just as touching and emotional.
5006;Great movie but for me the features just don't cut it.
5007;A young Paul Newman or even Tom Cruise are a lot more handsome than this lightweight pretty boy.
5008;It's a classic fictional movie based on a real.
5009;The story of the Titanic has always facinated me.
5010;"This is one of those ""must own"" movies."
5011;This is a great effort and has good special f/x and design, although the price to make the movie could feed the world for a few centuries.
5012;The plot is, well, let's just say down.
5013;I on the other hand, feel asleep after two hours and woke up when the ship was sinking and laughed.
5014;A good use of a pool and make.
5015;Not only is this a masterpiece filled with visual storytelling and state of the art special effects but the story is of such consequence at the turn of this century, that it became an instant classic.
5016;For what?Everything that went into this film makes it truly a classic.
5017;pauper young love story that grabbed hearts.
5018;The marvel of being on this great vessel and sailing with it again.
5019;The opulence, the characters, the color, the fun of it all.
5020;Yes, we all experience the thrill and the excitement of the moments.
5021;Watching the events that lead up to that eventful brush with the iceberg.
5022;the single vision of writer/director James Cameron was determined to craft this epic, no matter what the cost.
5023;thank you James Cameron for bringing this story to life like no other could.
5024;Yes, we truly lived the experience and are so much richer for it.
5025;in 1993 when I didn't yet know who he was, I thought he was really a cute little retarded kid.
5026;backed block voting resulted in the record.
5027;I first saw it in an IMAX theater and you better believe it felt real!
5028;So someone actually used their imagination and made up a love story so the movie would be something both tragic and beautiful.
5029;i enjoy some of James Cameron's films, (True Lies and Strange Days, which he wrote, are two of the best action films of the 1990's!)
5030;This is my all time favorite movie.
5031;it comes in an amazing box, looks and has a great feel.
5032;It opens from the top revealing the case with an amazing slip cover.
5033;the box is sturdy and feels like it holds together and not cheap.
5034;I liked this version of the Titanic story when I saw it on the big screen, and I've seen all of them except a silent reel made shortly after the sinking in 1912.
5035;It was incredibly moving and sad.
5036;long giant screen film is excellent.
5037;foot curved screen made me want to see this movie again, on a big screen.
5038;Made for a great Valentine's Day gift.
5039;The scenes which focussed on the sinking and the aftermath helped bring the movie back into credibility.
5040;"Many historians agree that the definitive movie of the Titanic belongs to ""A Night to Remember""."
5041;cameron's epic boasted incredible special effects and is one reason to see the film.
5042;While not a true fan of this film, I intend to pick up the impressive Australian 4.
5043;overall, while James Cameron's film did not entirely satisfy me, it has merits of its own .
5044;This movie is one of the best movies of all time.
5045;the retelling of the tragic boat story stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet this film also features a love story between the 2 stars and how sometimes love can conquer all boundaries
5046;From start to finish, all I can say is breath taking.
5047;The two main characters did an excellent job!!
5048;"to sum up A review, this movie was excellent I have watched this movie 13 times, and I could watch it again, I really go for these ,movies that depict disaster, that, and the steamy love affair scene, S, A MUST SEE in my book, definitely A ""two thumbs up"""
5049;It took me all my life but it was a delight watching this movie.
5050;Other than that, highly recommended.
5051;I will watch this more than one time.
5052;It's exactly what I paid for!
5053;One of my favorite movies!
5054;The chemistry between the two characters (Jack and Rose) is breath.
5055;The movie was that amazing.
5056;Movie arrived very fast and in great condition like promised.
5057;If you like this movie and are not able to find it , i recommend getting it from here, since it is not sold at many store.
5058;The better treatment of a well acomplished movie of which 1/3 was made purely out of special effects has got my 4 star rating.
5059;The bonus features serve the movie well in accompaniment, while giving away most, if not all, the secrets of how the movie and special effects were put into play.
5060;It is amazing for this classic blockbuster movie to come in a nicely box.
5061;worth for every single dollar u spent.
5062;Great love story, lots of drama, and excitement.
5063;Also very educational on the events that took place on the real Titanic.
5064;When I first saw this movie on its opening day I thought it was wonderful.
5065;As its popularity grew though I found myself having a strange reaction to it success.
5066;I must say that I now feel that Titanic is a great movie once again.
5067;THe film is so brilliantly executed, both thematically and technically, that I can dismiss these flaws with the wave of a hand.
5068;When a film is done this well who really care about how ridiculous the love triange is.
5069;Rose and Jack fell in love.
5070;It is this drawing that is found in modern times on the sunken Titanic and is seen as a clue to treasure hunters who are looking for the 52 carat diamond.
5071;The love story was a good way to personalize the tragedy of the Titanic and the special effects were really spectacular.
5072;The romance is so affected and vain.
5073;Everything about this version is top.
5074;Having worked as a core extra in this movie back in 96.97 in Baja Fox Studios, Rosarito Beach, BCN, Mexico, where this movie was shot, I have always looked out for any additional footage that is not included in the movie.
5075;I think this romantic picture is one of the best I have to admit some people may think leonardo is cute.
5076;Titanic on Blu Ray is beautiful.
5077;In this edition you get the full movie on one disc and it is beautifully remastered.
5078;this is definitely a warm welcome to your Blu Ray collection for sure!
5079;This movie is an absolute classic.
5080;brilliantly made,and a whole lot of money spent to make what could possibly be one,or some may argue the greatest movie of all time.
5081;they even managed to get into that car.
5082;going around meeting all the most famous passengers on the ship.
5083;nobody is absolutely sure if that did happen.
5084;do you want facts or do you want la la land.You hear lots of stories about past events,people exaggerating stories and covering up things,because you might upset the mainstream.
5085;This movie was actually pretty good.
5086;It is really long and is great for rainy days.
5087;It is a good drama.
5088;The only saving grace of the whole affair is the set, which is, quite simply, spectacular.
5089;The picture is absolutely stunning in blu.
5090;Really love the new additions.
5091;Great story and love story.
5092;Really makes you feel like you were on the Titanic living this moment in time
5093;"Titanic is the classic ""style over substance"" film."
5094;Sure, the special effects are eye.
5095;a world map with present.
