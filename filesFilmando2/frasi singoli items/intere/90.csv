1;It's a classic and a good movie for adults as well as kids.
2;It's a great film for anyone who enjoyed cartoons when they were a kid.
3;The live action works very well with the animation.
4;Sure kids can enjoy it too.
5;I've watched it a number of times and still enjoy it.
6;This is the first movie I ever had as a kid.
7;it is the very first movie where animated and real life characters interact.
8;This movie made me laugh a lot.
9;Roger and Roger's wife Jessica made me laugh the most.
10;This film is somewhat dated now but Bob Hoskins is the crowd pleaser here.
11;I love the live action and animation, very clever film.
12;Much like director Robert Zemeckis' BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy, time has done very little to tarnish the charm of this amazing fantasy film.
13;It's all the more impressive when you realize it was made without ANY computer animation.
14;It looks and sounds great.
15;the Vista Series release gives you 4 options for viewing the film.
16;In addition to watching the film in your choice of widescreen or full.
17;frame, you can choose from two informative supplemental tracks.
18;style feature which provides a constant barrage of on.
19;, but they are nonetheless informative and often amusing.
20;And Charles Fleischer (the voice of Roger) hosts a more kid.
21;a very impressive, exhaustive presentation that will answer every question you ever might have about this wonderfully fun and original film.
22;This movie produce in year 1988 , it was very good movie then , but when I witch it again now , I love it more and more than before .
23;Now, as we know, this movie broke ground back in 1988 with it's spectacular animation and sound effects, earning it FOUR (4) Oscars, which were for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects, 1988 Special Achievement in Animation Direction, and Best Film Editing.
24;For those older viewers there is the wonderful plot as alcoholic Eddie Valiant uncovers subplot after subplot to bring the movie to a colorful, breathtaking ending.
25;The musical performance by Bob Hoskins while keeping your kids entertained, you entertained, and Grandpa entertained.
26;ins, showing the process of the animation, and a tad bit more.
27;It also comes with two photos, glossed, of Roger and Jessica.
28;In the end, you'll love it.
29;i love who framed roger rabbit a lot.
30;i received the replacement today, 03/20/2013.
31;It's his favorite movie and I'm glad I was able to find it for such a great price!
32;This has been one of my favorite movies growing up and am so happy to have found one in this condition and it was a special edition with some fun extras :.)
33;breaking movie won 4 awards, including Best Visual Effects.
34;This a great family film with lots of great jokes and a fun performance by Bob Hoskins.
35;One of those movies that is much better than you remembered is was.
36;is a wonderful movie that has delighted movie.
37;Two scenes, both involving Jessica Rabbit.
38;however, the movie is a treat even without those missing frames of animation.
39;Recommend it to anyone who has a sense of humor!
40;Definitely one of my favorites as a child!
41;Still in love with this movie and Jessica Rabbit.
42;I grew up watching this movie, it was always one of my childhood favorites and is still a favorite now that I am grown up.
43;An iconic film that ushered in a whole new wave of animated blockbusters, Robert Zemeckis' box.
44;"much like ""Terminator 2"" and ""Jurassic Park"" ."
45;"fashioned movie in more ways than one, ""Roger Rabbit"" was produced with hand."
46;action and animation is entirely due to the craftsmanship of Zemeckis, Williams and particularly the ILM visual effects crew.
47;true techniques in making their film come to life .
48;they just did a more effective job than anyone else ever had, and their attention to detail still shines through in high.
49;Hoskins' performance, though, is the glue that holds the movie together, and is rightly singled out by director Zemeckis in his audio commentary.
50;hued cinematography is like a love letter to post.
51;Given all the technical challenges involved in bringing the film to life, it's understandable, and for the most part, the transfer is quite good (and either way, it's unlikely the film will ever look better than it does here).
52;The 5.1 DTS MA audio is active throughout, boasting an energetic and at.
53;times bittersweet score by Alan Silvestri that ranks as one of his best.
54;look spectacular here, with glorious detail and color that's absent from the film itself.
55;"minute documentary featuring interviews with the cast and crew
56;Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of those dizzying, frantic Zemeckis films that pushed the technical boundaries of its day, remaining a favorite of both animation fans and fantasy aficionados.
57;up, the 1988 film is still a unique viewing experience that's lost none of its charm.
58;what that said, this film has a lot for the cartoon lover.
59;A comic duel between Donald and Daffy Duck?
60;But the business with Jessica Rabbit is amusing as well as the Robert Hoskins character (who interacts quite well with the cartoons.
61;I was merely five or so at the time, but I can still remember it quite vividly.
62;`Who Framed Roger Rabbit' was a total breakthrough at the time it was released, and it serves today as the foundation for the perfect family feature.
63;He's just such a naturally charming acting, his gruff exterior included.
64;He fits into this role so wonderfully, giving the right amount of feeling to his character in order to make him real and not a walking caricature.
65;Christopher Lloyd is his usual zany self, and he fits the role beautifully.
66;The voice work done (mostly by Charles Fleischer) is also spot on perfect.
67;It is smartly written film and it is masterfully directed by Robert Zemeckis who balances the dark live action underworld with the crisp animated world brilliantly.
68;if you are looking for a film that will entertain you to the core, this is it.
69;In the world of WFRR, cartoons, or just toons for short, are real.
70;They live among us, and act in their own movies and cartoons.
71;Maroon hires Eddie to trail Jessica and take pictures incriminating her.
72;And what seems like a simple frame job continues to unfold as more and more clues point in new directions.
73;for what may be seen as a kids' movie (which it definitely isn't), there is a complex story, interesting character development, and good dialogue.
74;Also, the special effects are superb, espcecially considering that this movie was made in 1988.
75;overall, this is a great movie that is a testament to the talents of director Robert Zemeckis (who also directed Back to the Future and Castaway) as well as the effects team.
76;This is well worth the price.
77;The story is the most valuable part of this movie and the characters too.
78;This is one of the best family films even now and days it's still an epic classic that would want other youngsters watching also.
79;One of the great joys of movie.
80;going is to see a concept, that on.
81;beat that it should never work, but, in the end, does work and works in spades!
82;seeing the film again reminded me how impressed I was with the audacity and accomplishment of Bob Zemeckis and his collaborators on bringing off with care and intelligence, a sharp and funny film that plays to both children and adults.
83;made prior to CGI coming into its own, the characters were brought to the screen brilliantly.
84;The hows and whys of what they did to achieve this magic are worth a look.
85;anchored by the great casting of Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd and Joanna Cassidy and Charles Fleischer, brilliant technical work, and a clever story strung through with great good humor, dialogue and jokes for kids and adults, this film has some cherished, favorite lines, from Baby Herman's """"That's my problem, I've got a 50 year."""
86;Some kind of classic here, and well worth your while.
87;Wanted to watch the movie after hearing about it's 25th anniversary.
88;The animation is awesome and it really holds up given all the advances in CG over the last 25 years.
89;I absolutely love this movie.
90;A great product, not a whole lot of extra features, but who needs it when you have Roger Rabbit?
91;This great 80's classic was made in 1988 and was directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Steven Speilberg.
92;Roger Rabbit(Charles Fleischer) is a crazy, fun.
93;loving rabbit who as an amazingly attractive wife Jessica Rabbit(Kathleen Turner).
94;So it's up to Eddie Valiant to prove Roger's innocence.
95;this movie is great for kids and adults as it has cartoons and funny gimmicks in the movie that will be great for kids, as well as some adult humor.
96;action and animation but this one perfected it.
97;the movie received much financial success at the box office and went on to win 4 academy awards, and is one of the most expensive animated films ever made, with a budget of $70 Million.
98;It's a cult classic that left a huge impact on our culture.
99;Sound and picture is excellent.
100;This is a great family picture!
101;ray in the picture attached.
102;This is one great movie!!
103;It was beyond its time when it came out but i love it.
104;Not just great animation mixed with live action but a great story as well.
105;Great for adults as well as kids.
106;I wonder if people nowadays realize just why this movie was so incredibly popular back in the day.
107;most importantly, you had reality and cartoons combined and it looked totally believable like the real people were actually communicating with the cartoon characters.
108;It was bizarre, it was unique, and the movie is quite entertaining as a result and worth watching several times over.
109;This movie was a huge step forward for film directors and I'd say it was a pretty big influence on todays films.
110;along with the Back to the Future movies, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the greatest movies at the time, and honestly the film still holds up and looks remarkable today.
111;Now I understand the appeal.
112;A remarkable film, and a classic future generations of children and adults must watch at least once.
113;Great family movie night movie.
114;Ground breaking and a nice movie to watch.
115;This is a great movie!
116;The action is exciting, the mystery is thrilling and the fun never stops!
117;The entire family will love this movie!
118;This move is a great combinaiton of live action and annimation that is seemlessly blended together.
119;This is a great classic for any movie collection.
120;Would definitely recommend for any movie collection.
121;It is one of the most entertaining movies of the 80's.
122;Demanding of multiple viewings to spot all of the cartoon stars.
123;The voices for the 'toons' are perfect especially Charles Fleischer as Roger Rabbit and Kathleen Turner as the sexy Jessica Rabbit.
124;Filled with lots of memorable characters, stand.
125;outs on the 'human' cast are Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd.
126;From a scale of 1.10 I give this movie a 9!
127;Watched it for the first time in about 15 years recently, and I remembered almost every line from my childhood.
128;This was a gift for my nephew for Easter.
129;Fantastic marrying of cartoon characters and the real world.
130;ray is even more impressive.
131;The film looks as fantastic as the day it was released and the melding of cartoons with actors is still seamless and perfectly executed.
132;There are hilarious extras showing scenes filmed using stand.
133;This is a fun movie to watch with the whole family.
134;The film is an amazing achievement in a pre.
135;ray came with a nice slip.
136;My 5 year old son loves this movie, but the whole family can enjoy it.
137;Looks great in high def.
138;"This film was released in 1988, and told the story of adorable and whacky cartoon characters spilling over into the ""real"" world as studio contract players."
139;840,000 hand painted cells were overlaid onto live action!
140;It's amazingly real, and hasn't really been topped before or since.
141;"the first is labeled the ""Family Friendly"" version, and contains the pan and scan version of the film and a kid friendly documentary about the movie."
142;There is a rather remote intensive game included as well that should keep youngsters entertained, but not quite up to their Playstation standards.
143;depth technical information and the widescreen version of the film.
144;it is well worth the investment!
145;Stunning presentation in a handsome package, and whimsical menus that reflect the movie.
146;time favorite with both my children and now their children.
147;This is an amazing accomplishment in animation combined with life action.
148;The Three Caballeros (1945) being an excellent example .
149;"The ""live"" cast was quite good here, especially Christopher Lloyd, unforgettably evil."
150;The crystal clarity noted in scenes with actors without animated subjects backs off slightly in scenes combined with animation.
151;I've loved this movie since I was a little girl, and now I have a new appreciation for it's revolutionary effects in the animation realm of film.
152;It belongs in most collections.
153;One of my all time favorite films.
154;It provides a (rather bumblingly) heroic rabbit lead!
155;It is a fine mix of live action and animation!
156;It is a great detective film!
157;It has everything needed in a great movie: drama, suspense, sexy heroines, loathsome villains, cuteness, wit, etc.
158;It still holds up even with the sophistication of effects in more recent movies.
159;It is one of my childhood favs after all!
160;Where else do you see cartoons and real people acting together?
161;Who Framed Roger Rabbit was a cutting edge film in its day, and is still a classic.
162;And even after all of this time, this film still delivers the laughs.
163;Aside from the fact that I've always liked this movie, the extras on this really make this particular edition with all the in depth background information .
164;You heard me, this was one of his best performances.
165;"Second only to ""Sir Arthur Connan Doyle's The Lost World"" in which I think was the best."
166;All in all, this is a classic movie that is worth your time.
167;I think since the release of this movie, I've seen it at least 100 times (20 times in the theatre) so it goes without saying that I undoubtedly love this movie.
168;I recommend it to anyone that wants to see something fun and entertaining.
169;This is a classic that still stands the test of time.
170;Was able to show this to my 14 year olds and they loved very minute of it.
171;Was so happy to find this movie.
172;"This is one of my favorite movies ever
173;This is a good movie.
174;It was very funny and unfornutally the last thing Mel Blanc ever did but all good things have to come to an end sometime.
175;Anyway this is a funny movie and you should get it.
176;This is the best of the toon/live action movies.
177;I still crack up when I see this movie.
178;It's that odd combination of drama, comedy, sex and violence that's perfectly done and your children can watch.
179;This is a very inventive, technically brilliant cartoon.
180;It has a lot of incredibly funny scenes and a great many superb comic in jokes.
181;for the time this was made, the special effects are stunning.
182;This is a great piece of entertainment.
183;Sometimes digital groundbreaking images get in the way of artistry and actually creating good art.
184;George Lucas oddly enough has great visuals but bad films(except Episode 3) while Cameron and Zemeckis make good films that still are visually great.
185;this film not only looks great(although real.
186;life/animation combo shots look a bit off such as when a character is holding a cartoon) it's actually a really great film period.
187;The fact that the animation never calls attention to itself is a testament to the film.
188;Besides the Back to the Future trilogy, this is probably one of Zemeckis' best films.
189;For best film, go all the way to Roger Rabbit.
190;As soon as you open the briefcase of the new Vista Series Roger Rabbit, you can tell it is going to be a first class adventure.
191;Everything about this set is all about fun.
192;I can say however, that this is a much better and more enjoyable presentation than the special edition CAV Laserdisc (even as nice as that was).
193;The picture looks great, the 5.1 mix is great, you have more choices of how to spend your time with this set than a barrel full of weasels.
194;I've loved it since it first jumped from the cinema screens.
195;I still love it today.
196;Even as good as computer art has become, there is a special magic sometimes from brush and ink that can't be replaced.
197;Adding in the incredible live action interactions makes Roger hard to top.
198;This film will live on long after the next new and improved way comes along to put toons to film.
199;this Roger is a winner all the way around, spread the word.
200;i've watched """"Roger Rabbit"""" over and over again on VHS, but I can tell you this: watching the Vista Series Edition was like seeing a whole new movie."""
201;The widescreen presentation (enhanced for 16x9 televisions) perfectly showcases the movie's incredible special effects.
202;sharp image makes the interaction between live.
203;The Vista Series Edition is made for serious movie fans, and the packaging (with its holo.
204;there are two discs, just packed with goodies.
205;But make sure you're getting the Vista Series Edition!
206;Roger Rabbit is still great fun after all these years.
207;Great classic and the video and sound are great on my Plasm and stereo sound system.
208;this movie deserves more than 5 stars.
209;i was laghing my head off when i saw it,it's more than funny,i realy realy loved it with all my heart
210;I'm here to write my love letter for it.
211;We're all here to share our movie.
212;Seeing this wacky cartoons going through a routine Tom.
213;it was amazing how these movie actually tricked you, convinced you to believe that human and cartoons can exist in the same universe and dimension of reality.
214;it's all been blended so perfectly here.
215;funny, sharp, satirical, smart, thrilling, skillful, bright, bold, hard.
216;It should've won every single Oscar that year.
217;And it was hard, damn it, all of what was going up there on the screen.
218;there's the best of the everything here.
219;Everyone should see it, pure and simple.
220;A masterpiece in more ways than one.
221;christopher Lloyd proves yet again (as he does in all his roles) that he's one of the most underrated actors in the business.
222;"kathleen Turner is damn perfect as Roger's Mrs
223;oh, both are clever and well.
224;written spoofs of the whole """"hard."""
225;style, character dialouge, plot, theme, even ending, you wonder why they even bothered to get Wolf's permission and pay him a royalty.
226;I mean, I know there's an exception to every rule, but this is one you're sure is completely iron.
227;This is a movie for everyone.
228;This is a movie that will please everyone.
229;And yet, glory be, it didn't.
230;digital era film still stands against those of today.
231;I did see it in the theatre and at a young age so my opinion is bias perhaps.
232;I'm looking forward to seeing my niece's reaction and one day my own children's.
233;I hate it even more after seeing it a second time because I wanted to give it a second chance.
234;Bob took a mime class so you can see the weight of the rabbit.
235;Bob Hoskins is a superb actor!
236;Its blend of live action and animation in unprecedented to this day.
237;While the plot itself is choppy and cliche, the acting and animation direction (by animation great Richard Willaims) makes it a great film.
238;Disney really needs to realize that they truly have a film gem here and stop placing it in the back burners of their achievements.
239;The funniest bunny since Buggs.
240;good cartoon and live graffics
241;Roger Rabbit is one of my favorite classic films and it is still my favorite now.
242;"This film has everything
243;Heard of the movie and seen snippets in my youth in the 90's, but not 'til 2003 (coincidentally the year of the film's 15th anniversary at the time) did I start to see it and loved it ever since (though mostly with Jessica Rabbit at the time).
244;As time pass by, I started to enjoy more of it from cute little Roger Rabbit to his and Jessica's relationship with each other (which is beautiful in my opinion).
245;In short, the best live action/animated hybrid film I've seen and can still be enjoyed by kids and their families.
246;Whether you're a fan of the golden age of animation, an 80's fan, new to the film, or just any fan, this film is a worthy addition to your collection.
247;Highly, and I mean HIGHLY recommended!
248;see hit of the summer.
249;They got it right the second time around.
250;Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the great films that I recall from childhood.
251;Robert Zemeicks made a film that everyone can enjoy.
252;Watching the film as an adult I noticed there's big a amount of sexual innuedno in this film the kind of humor that you have to be an adult to get.
253;Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd were in top form as the hero and villian in the film and we all know that the two best voice overs in the film were Charles Fleischer and Kathleen Turner.
254;This is still one of favorite Zemekicks films so sit back and watch this for old times sake.
255;My brother loved this movie especially now that it is in high def.
256;great for the family and a great movie
257;time favorite classics of mines, 1988's """"Who Framed Roger Rabbit"""" stands out brightly against almost every other all."""
258;time favorite movie of mines.
259;"The reason ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" stands out in this case is not only is it fun, but brilliantly joins together two separate worlds, the real world, and the toon universe in such a brilliant way, there's no way one can resist loving every moment of this classic."
260;From here, it's an incredibly wild and often hilarious ride as they go on their mission to stop Doom from being able to take over the toon world and build his `superfreeway' and urban sprawl `as far as the eye can see' and turning the toon world into a giant, smog.
261;christopher Lloyd's eccentric personality reaches it's peak with his awesome and chillingly funny role as the main villain Judge Doom.
262;You have a brilliant yet laugh.
263;I don't know about you but the crew must have had lots of fun making this movie.
264;In the end, it all results in an amazing and extremely hilarious classic for the ages.
265;Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the best movies that 1988 produced.
266;Not only does it bring lots and lots of laughs but combines the humor with a mix of brainless but intelligent dialogue and outstanding storylines.
267;Yes, it's true, and so well done to be astonishing.
268;Bob Hoskins is fabulous in his role, selling everything he does.
269;The bonus features are great and is basically a second movie on their own
270;It was a shocking scene and made you take the film more seriously.
271;They should have given all of the deleted scenes in this, and brought back the original frames and full scenes, like customers expect.
272;A classic comdey with a who's who in the cartoon world appearing in this picture including the Man of 1,000 voices Mel Blanc in his last film before his death.
273;Great service and many thanks.
274;My kids have now started to enjoy this movie, and I still never get tired of seeing it, even though I've been watching it regularly since it was in theaters over 10 years ago!
275;I higly recommend this wonderful movie!
276;For all of my childhood, Who Framed Roger Rabbit has been one of my favorite movies.
277;Thankfully, it's another one of those movies that still holds up really well as an adult.1988 was quite a year for animation.
278;action film and animation that to this day, is unmatched in how sublime it is, which is also helped by its other strong qualities (more on that later).
279;cHARACTERSFor the most part, the characters in this movie are done really well.
280;Roger and Jessica Rabbit are great at providing solid humor, along with Doom's gang of cartoon weasels.
281;hUMORThe humor in this movie is really solid.
282;The humor is a perfect homage to the masterful slapstick and exaggerated bodily distortion of the classic Tex Avery and Looney Tunes cartoons.
283;There's plenty of other funny parts in this movie, but I think you get the picture.
284;aPPEARANCEThe cinematography for this movie is marvelous.
285;The set designs perfectly capture that 1940's noir feeling, and the designs of the cartoons perfectly fit the setting it takes place in.
286;"The animation of the characters is totally fluid, and is even more impressive considering that the ""interactions"" with the cartoons and real people was seamless."
287;With this being made before the age of CGI, it's even more impressive to see all this and see the cartoon characters believably carry around real props like guns.
288;I think along with John Carpenter's The Thing, Who Framed Roger Rabbit has some of the most remarkable special effects and visuals ever done in cinema.
289;Like the visuals, the music fits the setting of this movie like a glove, and one of my favorite pieces of music is near the end, when Eddie has a showdown with Judge Doom and his weasel minions, since it's so heart.
290;fINAL WORDWho Framed Roger Rabbit is certainly a classic, and a really good homage to 1940's noir and of the Golden Age of Cartoons.
291;My brother and I count Roger Rabbit as one of the best movies ever made.
292;The movie is THAT fun.
293;I venture to say it is a movie for all ages.
294;Adults will find subtle humor that will go over kids heads, and kids will love the animation and slap.
295;This is one of the most visually amazing movies ever made, and you forget that most of the characters are cartoons.
296;Finally a cleaned up excellent version of a brilliant movie on blu ray.
297;I've loved Roger since it first came out and I was so glad to get this excellent version!
298;A fun story with some great twists, but it has a lot of heart too.
299;Well worth adding to anyone's collection!
300;It also benefits from a great cast, starting with an irascible performance by Bob Hoskins.
301;Joanna Cassidy is perfect as his longsuffering girlfriend and Christopher Lloyd makes a great villain.
302;Outstanding special effects, a visual treat from start to finish.
303;drinking detective and the very adult Jessica Rabbit was a brilliant idea.
304;the movie was considered groundbreaking in its mixture of live action and cartoons.
305;Toons became decent again!Like a great Disney movie, Roger Rabbit works for both young and old audiences.
306;the packaging is very nice.
307;the extras are first rate.
308;Something for everyone.3 short Roger Rabbit films (that I never knew existed) are amazing.
309;this is the film that resurrected animated features.
310;Films that feature both live.
311;From the best of my knowledge, Space Jam and Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
312;have held up all these years.
313;This is a dark, silly, and extremely fun film with a whole lot of humor and a whole lot of (cartoonish) action.
314;The special effects are especially top.
315;The cartoon characters look authentic, as if they're actually there onscreen with the real actors.
316;Charles Fleischer has the right voice for Roger Rabbit, while Jessica Rabbit look nice as Roger's girlfriend (even though I think that she's not very attractive as a cartoon woman).
317;What it is, however, is a wildly fun movie with lots of brilliant effects and perfectly.
318;I wouldn't necessarily say that it's for really small kids, but hey, it's good for the rest of us.
319;After BACK TO THE FUTURE, Robert Zemeckis proved once again to be among the best directors in the business.
320;The whole idea is ingenius!
321;hollywood, 1947: Humans share their world with living animated characters dubbed 'Toons.
322;The filmmakers have done the miraculous, by seemlessly combining cartoons and live.
323;You are truly swept away into this world, and never, not EVER, do you stop to consider how this is possible.
324;No, the plot keeps you guessing, and everything is so compliated and fits so well together that I keep understanding more and more every single time I watch it!
325;The actors are extremely talented, and work so well with their animated co. stars it's nothing short of mind.
326;Bob Hoskins is very entertaining as anti.
327;sober P. i. Eddie Valiant, and Christopher Lloyd shines as Judge what's.
328;"But, of course, the real star of the show is Roger himself
329;A highly recommended film, and an absolute must.
330;It is the same with this one.
331;well, this is one of his most famous (and certainly most ground.
332;I you're just a fan of the film, see previous praise.
333;Great movie for both kids and adults alike.
334;It brought me right back to childhood watching it again.
335;this movie is not only a technical achievement (no computers were used, all animation was hand drawn) but it succeeds on levels of creativity and entertainment as well.
336;it really is a great flick.
337;disc 1 is for the kiddies, it contains the full.
338;it contains the widescreen version of the film, plus tons and tons of supplemental material on the making of the movie.
339;wHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT is a classic because they just don't make movies like this anymore.
340;it has withstood the test of time, because i loved it as a kid and now with this special edition, i can enjoy it on a whole new level as an adult.
341;my kids can watch the first disc and be completely entertained as i was, then as they get older they can dip into disc 2 and who knows?
342;maybe they'll be inspired to get out there and bring their imagination to life the way these filmmakers did.
343;It's as good today as it was then and still can attract fans (all three of my kids loved it, they are ages 10.15).
344;I love this movie, funny.
345;The combo of real people and cartoons was done very good.
346;I can watch this movie over and over again.
347;This is a very underrated movie by most people.
348;All though it is perhaps more on the adult side in some subject matters, for a cartoon, it is extremely entertaining and a great demonstration of how Zemeckis is a great comedy director outside of the Back to the Future series.
349;a fun film on a rainy day!
350;the gags still make us laugh and Bob Hoskins was just so terrific as the put upon detective!
351;Roger looks terrific after 15 years, sporting THX.
352;Segregating the extras makes sense .
353;it worked great on """"Shrek"""" ."""
354;"Aside from a fun game and a trio of ""Roger"" shorts, there's little worth revisiting in this part of Toontown."
355;"the ""family"" version comes full screen (1.33:1) with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround."
356;action images look a bit flat at times, but the vivid cartoon colors jump off the screen.
357;"director Robert Zemeckis, producer Frank Marshall and four other ""Roger"" veterans provide the feature."
358;length commentary (recycled from the laserdisc), which is loaded with good vibes, great stories and a fair amount of tech talk.
359;"The filmmakers clearly love their film and delight at their co. workers' craft (""Look at those shadows!"")"
360;"minute documentary ""Behind the Ears"" is new and quite good, with a snazzy parade of images."
361;This is one of the top three movies from my childhood in the 1980s.
362;Great animation and unique story that never gets old!
363;In fact it was a big favorite of mine.
364;It was an amazing work.
365;Sure took away one of the funniest parts to me.
366;Am I cursed with an excellent memory?Maybe/not.
367;"I picked it up just to wander back to the silly but clever animation in ""Roger Rabbit""."
368;All in all, I laughed again just as the first time I saw it.
369;While not a flick that is looked at every month, it is a nice break in the usual Hollywood dramas.
370;Let yourself enjoy it without letting the plot put you to sleep.
371;wonderful mix of animation and real time actors.
372;Bob Hoskins is great in the detective role.
373;Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd, and the many voice talents make this movie enjoyable.
374;Brings back many fond memories that I can share with my children.
375;I love this movie so much.
376;It's such a fun movie and it is extremely well made.
377;the film is based on a novel by Gary K. Wolf, and it takes place in a town filled with cartoon characters and real people.
378;this is an amazing movie in so many ways.
379;I totally recommend this movie to anyone.
380;scan and letterbox formats and an assortment of extras, many of which are quite interesting.
381;The concept is a clever one, and the story could have gone in any number of directions.
382;"Set in 1947 Los Angeles, the film uses classic ""noir"" elements (and references everything from THE MALTESE FALCON to CHINATOWN)
383;And all of these sidelights are interesting and entertaining.
384;But the most attractive thing about ROGER RABBIT is that it is just plain fun to watch.
385;part of that fun comes from the marvelous performances of Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd (as the evil Judge Doom), and Joanna Cassidy (Valiant's sidekick Delores), who lead the live action cast.
386;But the big deal here is the extremely believable way in which the """"Toons"""" fit into the real world."""
387;They rendered with astonishing detail and remarkable three dimensionality.
388;It's just an amazing thing to watch.
389;"rOM game
390;set shots and a nifty documentary called """"Behind the Ears."""""""
391;The upshot is really a one.
392;but even so, this is easily the best release of this film to date.
393;It at gives the rabbit some justice at last, and I give it five stars on that basis.
394;Toons are cartoon characters come to life, working in painted studios like actors in Hollywood.
395;They killed Eddie's brother Theodore a few years ago, dropped a piano on his head.
396;Their star Roger Rabbit keeps stuffing up their animated shorts because he's so in love with Jessica Rabbit, his wife.
397;Who Framed Roger Rabbit pretty stylish film, with a pretty good cast (I love Bob Hoskins as Detective Valiant in this, and Christopher Lloyd as the Judge).
398;The mystery of the story is pretty interesting too, as is seeing Disney and Warner Bros characters together.
399;A comedy classic for anyone who enjoyed Loony Tunes when they were younger.
400;This movie is one of the best animated/real life movie I have seen.
401;This movie I thought seemed so cool because it had to make the cartoons interact with live people and it looked so real!
402;There were many followers such as Cool World and the Paula Abdul video Opposites Attract .
403;This is one of my favorite movies and watching it on Blu Ray is like seeing an old friend in a new way.
404;This movie's amazing special effects combining live action and animation put Mary Poppins' to shame.
405;This unique and captivating story is truley one of Disney's finest.
406;Bob Hoskins really does wonders in this pre CGI masterpiece.
407;While the combination of live action and animation was and still is remarkable (and astonishingly great considering that the effects were all optical and pre.
408;"There were cartoons for kids, cartoons for grownups and a new ""golden age"" at Disney, where now."
409;classics like Beauty and the Beast delighted everyone.
410;ray, particularly the Toontown sequence, but also even the darker scenes take on a luster and sheen because every detail is defined.
411;See this if you haven't already.
412;See it again if it's been awhile.
413;The unexpected twist is good.
414;A great mix of the genres.
415;disc set hasnice picture and sound plus cool extras.
416;"First off, it was a good movie
417;The Rocketeer should have also been released via Touchstone Pictures, as it had a strong profanity and innuendo.
418;Stick to Disney's classic animated and live.
419;great p[rice as compared to similar item on other sites.
420;family and friends are also happy with this item.
421;a good story, appeal to young and old however, sadly, some sceens have bin cut from original, good animations
422;Family fun for all ages, especially if you just need a good laugh to bring you up.
423;Compared to the newer high tech movies Roger Rabbit still stands up and entertains with beautiful picture and sound.
424;There are numerous extras that make you feel like you've entered the action including:Who Made Roger Rabbit .
425;That and Christopher Loyd's portrayal as Judge Doom, a villain who's actions, musical score, and true identity brings more chills through the body than today's cartoon villains.
426;The introduction of annimation blended with true life has opened a door to even more classics since this one was produced, thank you!
427;It was revolutionary for its degree of interaction between the toons and the human characters, done so perfectly that they seem completely natural at first glance, but then amaze when you take a closer look .
428;It's also unique and original in the fact that some of it takes place in the real world, featuring animated characters, and some in an animated world, featuring live actors"
429;who Framed Roger Rabbit is wonderfully funny, directed more at an adult audience than children.
430;Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd make a terrific impression in the lead roles, and manage to stay remarkably serious and convincing while conversing and interacting with entirely imaginary characters.
431;The entire film excels with intelligent humor that would appeal to both children and adults, and it's a treat for animation buffs, with references to historical toons from the Foxy cartoons of the 20s, through Betty Boop, Dumbo and Bambi to Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse.
432;"who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the defining films of my childhood
433;I was very young when Roger Rabbit came out and I was so impressed.
434;I am still impressed today.
435;Even with all the CGI out there now, this movie really holds up well.
436;(But I must empathize that they did what they did do extremely well .
437;and the actors interacted very well with the animated characters.
438;As someone who loves art, I really appreciate the time and effort that went into making Roger Rabbit look good.
439;(Of course, as someone who loves acting and movies, I also appreciate the acting and story that made it a good movie.)
440;Like I said, I really like a lot of computer.
441;animated movies, but as far as I can tell from watching the special features on those movies, the computer does most of the work.
442;Roger Rabbit is more of a traditional, actual type of art.
443;Then they went in there and added shading and somehow made 2.
444;dimensional animated characters look like they fit in with 3.
445;Actually, considering what they can do today with computers, it makes Roger Rabbit all the more impressive.
446;Who Framed Roger Rabbit is by far one of my favorite animated movies I have in my collection of comedy movies.
447;My viewpoint is this is a classic movie for anyone's collection of movies that they should own.
448;So it will be worth the money to own this edition of the movie and keep in your collection forever.
449;Oh my gosh, thought it was awesome as a kid and still think it's awesome now!
450;The effects are fantastic and the acting amazing.
451;this film still remains a classic, and retains the highbar status of melting live.
452;His findings set in motion the wonderfully creative story.
453;Part film noir, part hysterical comedy, part magic, this film blends so many elements together to produce an incredible product.
454;The two disk set gives you a wealth of information on the film, from its making to deleted scenes, to commentaries.
455;It's amazing just to watch the film, but to learn about how this film was made will astonish you.
456;I particularly enjoyed the deleted scene , which in reality is a series of scenes cut out that were hysterical.
457;back to the film, everytime I watch this movie, and perhaps this happens to you, you FORGET that Roger, Jessica, and many other characters, are animated.
458;The filmmakers were successful in their goals of doing that.
459;Who Framed Roger Rabbit will stand as a testament to the art of filmmaking at its finest.
460;Better than when I sw it in the theater 25 years ago.
461;The special features are great, it comes with some nice touches like nice packaging and design.
462;You can tell they put a lot of effort into it.
463;I bought it for my boyfriend as a present and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for this movie.
464;as soon as it came in the mail I put it on right away for my daughter (15 months old) and my step daughter (9 yrs old) to watch with me and they loved it which made me love the movie even more.
465;i love when the kids love things from my childhood.
466;makes me appreciate the classics even more and want to find more things (movies and games/toys) that the kids may enjoy.
467;is one of my favorite films of all time and has been since the movie was released 25 years ago.
468;and I'd enjoy it in any format.
469;It's a classic nostalgic trip to the golden age of Hollywood cartoons, with all your favorite Warner Bros, Disney and MGM cartoon characters.
470;Hilarious and touching, with excellent performances by Bob Hoskins (Eddie Valiant) and Christopher Lloyd (Judge Doom), Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
471;is great for both kids and adults, especially those who grew up with all those classic cartoons.
472;As other reviewers have noted, this is a ground.
473;This has got to be my favorite movie of all time.
474;It's got music, it's got murders, and most importantly of all, it's got TOONS!!!!!!!!!
475;acclaimed director who's done films like Back to the Future and the """"newly."""
476;all of which should be very good).
477;Bob Hoskins is hilarious and makes the movie seem realistic.
478;"(He's somewhat of a ""Scrooge"" character)."
479;Christopher Llyod is great as he portrays the villain, Judge Doom.
480;Though all the actors gave a splendid performance, Charles Fleisher (the voice of Roger Rabbit) was the best.
481;I'm also amazed at the wonderful effect of putting toons and actors together in the same frame.
482;"(I guess that's why, ""Roger Rabbit"" has won an academy award.)"
483;"In the words of the sexy Jessica Rabbit, ""Why Don't You Do Right"" and Zemeckis surely has done right in making this a periodic, memorable movie."
484;It has secured a place in film history.
485;Bob Hoskins is perfect in the role of Eddie.
486;Christopher Lloyd is always good in anything he does.
487;Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the most important milestones in movie history.
488;Great technical strides had been taken since Jerry Mouse danced with Gene Kelly.
489;The interaction between live and animated characters was convincing and lifelike all the way through the movie.
490;I thought the casting was perfect, too.
491;The clarity of transfer is outstanding.
492;i highly recommend this movie for anyone who has any kind of a sense of humor.
493;For those who don't, I recommend this movie to develop one.
494;I received this in the mail looking very forward to my kids being able to watch it.
495;I am sure I saw it many times as a kid, but never saw it as the genius piece of filmmaking that it is.
496;I am 20 years old now and this is one of my top 5 favorite movies.
497;That is the great thing about this movie, that all ages can enjoy something that this has to offer whether it be the animation sequences or just the fun storyline.
498;Oh yeah, and Roger was the perfect one to frame because his wife Jessica Rabbit had been seen meeting with Acme before he died.
499;So most people probably know the plot already, but if not it is highly original and entertaining.
500;this masterpiece couldn't get any better treatment than this, a fully loaded 2 disc set sporting both a family.
501;There are so many extras that it will take you a long time to see everything.
502;This is probably my third favorite movie of all.
503;time, and is without a doubt the best mix of live action and animation.
504;It is sheer movie magic, and something I could watch all the time and never get tired of seeing it.
505;Director Zimeckis has done a remarkable job with this film, and we also great great performances from Bob Hoskins (Eddie Valiant), Christopher Lloyd (Judge doom) and pretty much everyone else appearing in the film with the addition of the voices of Roger and Jessica who were terrific.
506;This is a timeless classic and a pioneer in its field.
507;Anyone who likes a good laugh would love this one.
508;This was a fun show.
509;I will probably watch the movie every couple of years, because it is so unique.
510;The lead actor is blended in with cartoons.
511;Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the best film ever that mixs animation with live action.
512;He has to come face to face with his past in.
513;bob Hoskins is great as Eddie Valent as is Christopher Lloyd as the villain.
514;It's the special effects that are the real star in Who Framed Roger Rabbit though.
515;He had much more star power then than he does now as well.
516;Still though Daffy versues Donald is so much fun that I wouldn't mind a sequel just to see go at it again.
517;Arrived punctually in great shape, and is a highly entertaining film.
518;Wonderful animation with incredible actors.
519;It was simultaneously fascinating and hysterically funny seeing the brilliantly talented actor (who truly deserved an Academy Award nomination for his under.
520;rated work in this movie!)
521;On release, Robert Zemeckis's colorful, thrilling joy.
522;ride broke new ground in the merging of live action and cartoons, but what keeps this movie special is its manic pacing and goofy, anarchic spirit.
523;The film is so dazzling that adults and children alike will quickly fall under its hyperkinetic spell, and come back to staid reality only with the closing credits.
524;Populated by a host of cartoon characters, familiar and unfamiliar, the film is also a tribute to movies, and the private eye genre in particular.
525;A great movie when it first came out and has stood the test of time.
526;Boy, what a great childhood memory.
527;Boy, what great memories it brings back.
528;and the making of was really neat to watch.
529;I love these older movies!
530;"*** This review may contain spoilers ***""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (hereafter WFRR) is an exhilarating example of a ""Hamlet Syndrome"" movie."
531;"I define a ""Hamlet Syndrome"" work as one that is so important, revolutionary, and/or complex that it has been endlessly analyzed from multiple perspectives, and therefore impossible to make an original comment upon."
532;Like many posters, I adore the masterful, seamless, phantasmagoric merger of live action and animation.
533;it seems strange to call the anarchic, partly animated WFRR world focused and intelligent, but it is.
534;smart, sizzling, and meaningful at every moment, even when a toon is speaking it.
535;smart, shrewd, and clever despite his descent into alcoholism and despair over the murder of his brother (poignantly summarized by a photo montage).
536;The implication of the goofy Roger Rabbit in Acme's murder because of his supposed dalliance with his stunning human toon wife Jessica Rabbit.
537;Every aspect of the film impresses you with its intelligence, because it is smarter than its audience.
538;wFRR is indeed intelligent, and its intelligence extends to pleasing both kids and adults without being condescending or boring to either.
539;liners, and asides are all sharp and really require you to think.
540;the entire tone of WFRR is smart, too, as well as underplayed and low.
541;WFRR will also teach you something about '40s film noir and detective movies, if you are observant.
542;Its overall craft and brilliance affirms how great human beings can be, when they set their minds to something.
543;Ok this is THEE best version of this movie.
544;The extras are amazing and you get a behind look on how exactly they made everything.
545;its really adult like humor and also child humor.
546;I bought this movie just cause its a classic and the extras.
547;And it was a very good desicion.
548;It made a great gift to a little girl that had seen it and wanted a copy to watch over and over.
549;The movie was super cool , it made my kids laugh a lot .
550;I love this movie,it's not fun for the whole family type movie but it's more of an adult oriented one and that's good too.
551;I remember watching this movie as a kid and felt the other night like some wacky cartoon fun.
552;I was delighted to see Amazon Streaming had it available and couldn't resist watching it.
553;esk world, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the best movies available.
554;The movie is not only well done (animation and such), but it's actually pretty entertaining and funny.
555;This was my favorite movie growing up and it still is today.
556;Adults and kids enjoy this movie immensely.
557;Its a classic about a mystery in 1940's Hollywood.
558;The twist is that in this movie, cartoons actually exist and interact with people.
559;There is impressive special effects with great acting.
560;The best thing about this movie is a complete dynamic story from beginning to end.
561;It's an action packed rollar coaster ride.
562;Its really funny and can get really suspenseful.
563;Dont miss out on this epic in fun.
564;The remastered version of this film looks outstanding on blu ray!
565;The content of the special features is great and there are plenty of them.
566;I am a huge fan of Roger Rabbit!
567;It was great ordering products from this company.
568;I will definately order from this company again.
569;the sound is excellent and colour too.
570;scenes special, as well as the trailer.
571;A movie this good deserves better treatment.
572;In addition to this being one of the greatest films, the extra features in this collectors edition are the icing on the cake.
573;it has the old 'bugs bunny and animaniacs' humor the really keep your attention and be suprisingly enjoyable.
574;i will continue to watch this on a regular baasis
575;I got exactly what I ordered and I am 110& satisfied!
576;I look forward to ordering more in the future!
577;Still laughed as much as I did back in 88!
578;it is a very unique film with live action and animation
579;The sexual references are bound and swearing is all over.
580;but, I love it and if you kids are big enough it is ok.
581;"Jessica is a caricature of the ""ideal woman"" at least the producers thought."
582;I enjoyed the movie, as I have in the past.
583;It is the European format.
584;And I'm glad I did!
585;I forgot how great this movie is.
586;It's so fun to see all your favorite cartoons together.
587;Even more, this movie was a good deal.
588;friendly, and the video is stored right there for future viewing.
589;popping delight for kids and adults alike with it's clever comedy, inventive animation and seamless cartoon interactions with the actors.
590;Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd are great, and the combination of cartoonish humour creates a nuance that woks well.
591;"Alan Silversti's lively score suits the film's tone, using the same themes as Back to the Future yet bringing new ""cartoony"" music to the film."
592;The brilliant combination of effortlessly clever humour and high.
593;sprited fun make this one a superb classic.
594;came out and it is just as much fun to watch now, maybe funnier because I missed some of the humor back then.
595;There is lots of subtle humor, like when Eddie asks for a scotch on the rocks in a 'toon bar and instead of ice he gets actual rocks.
596;Christopher Lloyd's Judge Doom is perfectly creepy and his squad of weasels are funny as they try to stop Eddie and Roger from discovering the truth.
597;the interaction between the live actors and the toons is seamless, probably why the movie won four Oscars.
598;The behind the scenes features and commentaries are great, the entire 2.
599;disc set is incredibly well.
600;"4.7 starsRoger Rabbit was one of the great eye candy surprises of my life when I saw it in the theatre in '88
601;one thing many fans of this film miss is that it is in fact a very cleverly.
602;but no one misses how perfectly constructed the script and plot are, and how fine Hoskins and Lloyd are in bringing it all to life.
603;Hoskins's work is even more impressive when you watch the extra that shows him acting to the blank bluescreen"
604;The man has imagination!As did the makers of this gem.
605;Seeing all these characters together only brings home what fabulous art the classic toon makers created.
606;This is made for adults, but kids can watch it with much joy as well.
607;It's both very funny and very clean, no mean feat.
608;perfection, and the way the toons slide around the screen adds to the feeling.
609;"The first time you see this is a real trip
610;there are some extras here, and they're not bad, but what really matters is we get to see the letterboxed original version, which really matters in a film shot with this much love and care.
611;a true work of art in most every way, the Wabbit deserves a perfect blu.
612;this is a very good movie, with an interesting story, and some of the best production that I have ever seen.
613;The creators of the film did a great job of making the cartoon characters interact in a believable way with the real people.
614;friendly, especially the one where Judge Doom dips a cute cartoon shoe into the solvent, dissolving it, and leaving his hand covered in red paint that looks like blood.
615;but, that said, this is a really good movie that is a lot of fun to watch and really holds your attention.
616;I still love watching it all these years later.
617;This movie mixes real life people with cartoon characters.
618;Goofy, crazy, zany, trust, etc.
619;who Framed Roger Rabbit is an exceptional fusion of live action and animation that helped break the mold.
620;The continuity of the scenes are so fluid that you can't distinguish the seperation of the live from the animated.
621;There are no computer graphics whatsoever and all the animation is hand drawn which is pretty incredible.
622;split between one disc for children and families and one disc for special feature enthusiasts, there is enough material here to keep everyone pleased for hours.
623;The demonstrations of the melding technique of live action and animation is especially interesting.
624;the movie itself is vibrantly colorful and crystal clear.
625;DTS surround sound is superb and compliments the whole experience.
626;Filled with great humor from start to finish and a huge cast of cartoon characters from all genre's past and present, this movie is a top.
627;notch crowd pleaser all around.
628;I can watch this movie over and over again.
629;I love this movie and bought for my son and he loves it too.
630;Awesome movie and was so missed since our only copy had been VHS.
631;Made for a nice present and was loved.
632;Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a really interesting film .
633;Focusing on the special features .
634;With it this pristine you know that Jessica Rabbit isn't bad.
635;she's just drawn that way.
636;This is a great movie to set and enjoy both worlds, Love having this to add to my movie collection.
637;This was considered a 4 star movie when it came out in theaters b/c it was so unique.
638;Well it still holds true.
639;Very cleverly written, funny and filled with every cartoon character you can imagine.
640;My 6 year old nephew watched w/ me and loved it.
641;considers it one of his favorite movies.
642;The mixed animation with real life is excellent even by todays standards.
643;He loves this movie because of all the action in it!
644;He loves to see people fall down and loves the music!
645;All the effects that you see are a combination of animation and physical special effects.
646;Sounds like film noire, and in fact it is, with one tiny twist"
647;What follows is a twist on the detective movies of the 30s and 40s, only with everything larger than life and with a good dose of humor.
648;"The special effects used to simulate the interaction of the cartoon characters and the human actors are so seamless that eventually you accept that the cartoon characters are ""real""."
649;The animation was so good that the movie won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 1988, along with several other Academy Awards.
650;one fascinating feature of the animated characters is the appearance by characters from multiple studios.
651;studio cooperation is unusual, but works extremely well for this movie, making the movie much more believable and enjoyable.
652;the combination of film noire, animation and humor in the movie make the movie suitable for adults and children.
653;There are commentaries, pictures, and several features related to how portions of the movie were filmed.
654;One of the most interesting features show comparisons between Bob Hoskins and his actions against a blue screen in comparison to how the final scenes came out.
655;Another interesting feature shows how plastic dolls were used to aid in setting up shots.
656;Of course, that also means you get the thrill of discovery each time you find a feature listed on the box that you struggled to find in the first place.
657;The movie itself is just as fresh and amazing today as it was in 1988.
658;Five stars for a film that will likely continue to amaze audiences for decades to come.
659;Lots of twists and turns.
660;Like I said in the headliner, great fun!
661;Still great after all these years.

693;Who Framed Roger Rabbit is nothing short of a masterpiece and way ahead of its time.
694;At first glance, the film appears to be for the kiddies, but this is a somewhat complicated murder mystery with plenty of dark humor and hilarious jokes.
695;The special effects and flawless blend of animation and live action.
696;never detract from the story and in the end they add a great dimension to this fine motion picture.
697;simply put, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a landmark film.
698;You could sit and marvel at the breathtaking special effects, and be fooled into thinking that they are the only reason it is any good.
699;But even though the special effects are stunning, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a film experience like no other.
700;It's a brilliant piece of work, utilising numerous elements to make it unforgettable.
701;the film takes us back to 1947, into the hectic life of Hollywood.
702;The only difference here is that Toons are living, breathing creations, that interact with humans.
703;On the run, Roger hooks up with Valiant, and swears that he was set up, an intriguing mystery in a truly wonderful film.
704;The performances are strong, the script switches from comedy to drama with ease, the direction is potent, and the special effects are amazing.
705;Even after over a decade, they still look as fresh and real as ever.
706;His climactic scenes are ones that will stay with you long after the film has ended.

715;One of the greatest and more entertaining film of the ighties.
716;This edition looks really good and has some interesting extras.
717;This is definitely one of the best movies of the decade .
718;action and animation was really nicely done, and this is a movie that deserves to be part of any movie collection!
719;Really enjoyed it and the great service!
720;This is a classic film, and seeing it now on blu.
721;And lots of fun special features!!
722;classics like this never go out of style!
723;A classic movie in a beautiful hi.
724;Let me count the ways.
725;I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body.
726;I ordered this product as a present, when the receiving party got it home, it wouldn't play.
727;My kids and I loved this animated movie when it came out and now I found out that it was and still is one of my childrens favorite animated movie of all time.
728;I recommend this to everyone.
729;In a funny and touching story revolving around Toontown the city where everyone from Bugs Bunny to Mickey Mouse to Betty Boop lives in this movie, the top cartoon companies came together to create a lovely (and, of course, hilarious) story that will have all cartoon fans cheering, not only for the characters' roles in this movie, but also to see cartoon characters from rival studios side by side on the screen.
730;inspiring, and wonderfully entertaining cinematic tour de force.
731;In technical terms, it is the first film to convincingly combine living actors and animated cartoon characters in the same frame and make it look convincing.
732;Thematically, it is a spoof of the noir films of the 1940s and 1950s, a slapstick comedy, and a satire of pre.
733;strip cartoons with more cinematic animated cartoon characters, but it retains the novel's satiric sociological subtext.
734;The toons are the social minority, and as with the minorities of the real.
735;But as the gushy gumshoe snoops for clues, he learns that there is more to Acme's murder than just a ploy to frame Roger"
736;time cartoon short, while at the same time it unfolds into an intelligent who.
737;it mystery worthy of Bogart's Sam Spade.
738;WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT represents the apex of 20th century filmmaking, but it is also wholesome family entertainment that offers something for kiddos and adults alike.
739;This one will still be enjoyed by audiences of all ages long after it becomes an icon in the history books.
740;"While this is certainly due in part to the awesome skill and artistry with which the animators have inserted the cartoon characters, excellent performances from the ""live"" cast members."
741;also help to sell the illusion of realism.
742;fact posture towards the cartoons, and this makes the audience believe that the human characters interact with animated critters on a daily basis.
743;theater edition of the wonderful film.
744;"These include a really entertaining feature commentary with director Zemeckis, the screenwriters, and other crew members
745;The Laserdisk has developed some sort of plague in the metal sheet.
746;This movie came out when I was 8, and I believed it!
747;Chalk it up to Robert Zemeckis, Steven Spielberg, Walt Disney animators and Industrial Light Magic FX technicians!
748;Roger Rabbit does what he does best: try to make Eddie crack a smile, and at the same time help him crack the case.
749;Many people go away form this movi remembering Jessica, and it's easy to see why: modeled after the female contour of aniamtion during the 40's and 50's, the animators capture the feminine charm that was instilled in the cartoons of the greats like Tex Avery.
750;The art is incredible for the fact that the characters do not wield Computer.
751;generated props, but actual items (at times you can see the wires, which is funny), which the animators had to animate around.
752;The visual effects guys did an incredible job of adding little touches like shadows, lighting details on the characters, and much more.
753;She was thrilled when she unwrapped it and we've already had a sister movie night and watched and laughed along just like we used to :)
754;Cool World 1992 waiting for that one to come out on blu.
755;ray, brings back some good childhood memories this one.
756;The animated menus are funny, the extras are great, and the film itself looks fantastic.
757;I recommend it to anyone with kids.
758;Mine is autistic and he loves it.
759;Hard to beat a crazed rabbit, a gorgeous cartoon babe, a hard boiled PI and a villain from the pits of ToonTown.
760;Great movie everyone should at least see it if not own it, grandisimo!!
761;My girls absolutely loved watching it.
762;My husband and I grew up watching and loving this movie and we were happy to see that our girls love watching a classic like this.
763;Happy to have found this on Amazon!
764;perfect condition, fast shipping and a great price .
765;This is the last great animated film before computers took over hollywood and ruined moives forever.
766;This movie introduced and was focused on a new animated character Roger Rabbit.
767;What makes this extremely annoying is taking characters such as Daffy with such an established rich history of character development.
768;I certainly enjoy the Looney Tunes of Schlesinger's era but it certainly does not represent the rich character that Daffy developed into.
769;Disney animation focuses much more on story and technical artistry of the features.
770;While the artistry was superior to Disney it was in a less intricate and focused on style instead of technically grand design of Disney.
771;In fact, it was good.
772;The story was funny and enhanced by the gags (only the ones by WFRR original characters).
773;as for Roger Rabbit himself, he's made for this movie which is fine.
774;Add to that a brilliant performance by the late Bob Hoskins and masterful hand.
775;drawn animation, this is a classic.
776;friendly movie as there are numerous sexual references and the character of Jessica Rabbit is drawn with extreme proportions.
777;However, it leads to one of the best movie lines of all time: I'm not bad.
778;I'm just drawn that way!
779;Everything about this movie was excellent.
780;The character of Judge Doom (who was well acted by Christopher Lloyd) is one of the most creative villian ideas ever.
781;I have enjoyed watching this movie since my childhood and it never fails to entertain me.
782;Kids and adults will love this film.
783;Great acting, scripts and story!
784;Fun for the whole family.
785;Brings back great memories and who doesnt love disney and wb characters together?
786;The order was processed quickly, I received this in time for my son for Christmas.
787;It's an old family favorite that we previously had on VHS.
788;Christoper Lloyd is a terrific villian and there are plot twists worthy of an adult murder mystery.
789;This is a great movie that was only made better by being in Blu.
790;This is a must have movie for everyone of all ages.
791;it was a very very good movie my wifey likes it alot.
792;thank you sooo much it was awsome thanks
793;It came in good time.
794;They did do the super edition of Armageddon , now let's see them work on a film that actually deserves it.
795;disc set with commentaries (by Zemeckis and Richard Williams, the great animation director who was completely screwed over on his labor of love, The Thief and the Cobbler), an extensive documentary, every piece of promotional material, an anamorphic transfer, a guide to all the cartoon characters who appear, and, while we're at it, how about those three Maroon Cartoons (Tummy Trouble, Rollercoaster Rabbit, and Trail Mix.
796;The point is, put out an edition of this film that truly does justice to the film itself and people will spend the necessary currency to obtain it.
797;It's a great movie that the family can enjoy.
798;at the time of its release the seamless blend of traditional animation and live action won Disney and Touchstone a host of accolades and the respect of the entire industry, not to mention a couple of technical achievement Oscars for good merit.
799;Instead of maintaining timelessness there is the faint odor of formaldehyde teeming from the cheering sidelines of animation's finest and most enduring creations.
800;Colors are overall well balanced.
801;The rest of the features, including an extensive array of well produced documentaries, deleted scenes, trailers and other extras, have all been crammed onto disc #2 along with the widescreen version of the film.
802;It is strident and shrill at times and very well balanced at other moments.
803;it is such a fun movie.
804;Truly enjoyed the crisp clear imagery.
805;The Bottom Line:The special effects are nifty and I guess the Chinatown.
806;and my grandson was very happy,which is really all i cared about.
807;Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a movie that you can enjoy time and time again, even if the transfer isn't the greatest for this anniversary edition.
808;One of the best combinations of human and animation movies going.
809;It offers you the inside story on the behind the scenes production and the animation.
810;Bob Hoskins was wonderful in this film.
811;Still,its good entertainment for everyone!
812;Great box art completed my satisfaction and I was pleased with the price too.
813;ray disc in pristine condition, and truly sorry that others were never made.
814;It reminds us the magnitude of Tex Avery's contributions to American cartoons, in their best production period.
815;When I was little I really loved this movie I used to have the roger rabbit doll where you pull the string in the back and the doll talked.
816;I still have the movie on VHS and watch it occasionally every now and then I just don't have the doll anymore but excellent movie very good.
817;My kids grew up with Roger, now I've got it for the grandkids.
818;This is one of the most funniest and creative movies I've seen ever.
819;Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd give great Performances.
820;And Roger Rabbit is one of the funnest characters on the movie (He sort of reminds me of an early Bugs Bunny) You get the occasional guest spots from some of the best cartoon characters.
821;The Movie is very high tech for it's time.
822;This is one of the most funniest and greatest movies of all time.
823;Who Framed Roger Rabbitt is such a joy to watch just as it was 25 years ago!
824;Wow I can't say enough good things about this movie.
825;Absolutly entertaining I can't watch it enough.
826;This movie is literally sharing the human world with the animated world.
827;Who Framed Roger Rabbit must surely be congratulated for the spectacular cartoon and special effects work.
828;popping fun is worth it.
829;And the movie is filled with underlying jokes and lots of slapstick humor.
830;The acting is also done pretty well, from Eddie Valiant the hard.
831;So if you're in the mood for a funny movie with lots of cartoons AND people, check out """"Who Framed Roger Rabbit""""."""
832;Great emanation, great action pact fun and exciting.
833;life is mixed with cartoons.
834;This movie mixes the cast with cartton characters and real.
835;The plot is certainly interesting but the heart of the movie lies in the out.
836;"A lot of the ones that are suitible are generally ""cute"" for the adults."
837;This is a movie that is hilarious for all ages.
838;You can watch it with your kids but you'll enjoy it even if you watch it alone.
839;I was entranced by the very notion of Who Framed Roger Rabbit from the beginning, and it played an enormous part in the stories, drawings and games I became involved in my pre.
840;jokes and cameos as well as the charming gallery of characters, the unique and original story line and the wonderful blending of animation with live.
841;WFRR paints a convincing portrait of life just after WWII, and I could not imagine a better era for the story to be set.
842;'Toons are a needed force, a source of vitality and joy in a world bruised and damaged.
843;I think it is this most of all, apart from the dazzling special effects, curious plot, and loveable characters, which has ensured it's place as a favourite for many years to come: it appeals to the desire within us all to see fantasy become reality.
844;I've loved this film ever since I was a kid of 5 years of age and I'd got to say this film became a instant classic that I fell in love with for so many years after I first saw this film in the theaters.
845;I would recommend this film to all of my family members and tell you will enjoy this movie just as much as I did.
846;I still fall in love with this film simply because of the fact the wife of Roger Rabbit.
847;She is so funny and beautiful at the same time, that's why the movie is so unique and hilarious, that's why I feel I fell in love with this movie at such a young age.
848;I hope everybody enjoys this movie just as well as I did and learn to have a laugh with family your loved ones.
849;I believe that I would be great to be seen again.
850;Loved this film when it first came out .
851;Not really sure how the whole region thing works, or which region I live in.
852;Shipping time was excellent though, it arrived two weeks ahead of the expected arrival date.
853;1987's marriage of animation and live action still holds up quite well due to the performances of Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd and the vocal skills of Charles Fleischer and Kathleen Turner.
854;While it is obvious that Zemeckis and company were paying homage to the great Tex Avery 'toons of the thirties, forties, and fifties, these newer films lacked Avery's brilliant over.
855;My children and I love to watch this one over and over again.
856;My husband and I bought the film this week and were very excited that one of our favorite movies as kids was finally getting the Blu Ray treatment.
857;It's a great film and not to be missed, especially for Disney and animation fans in general.
858;Far from it, it's a wonderful film.
859;It is second rate at best and looks like it wasn't worked on enough, if not at all.
860;Has an excellent array of features and shorts on the disk.
861;The audio and picture are both phenomenal.
862;Really made a fantastic gift for the family.
863;This film has always been great and is still great, does not disappoint.
864;Better than I remember!Took my kids to see it when it first came out and they both sat down with there kids to watch it.
865;I ordered this movie on March 15th, and it arrived today.
866;It's still edited, but that will never change.
867;drawn so it just stays by his side!
868;Now his arm reaches back up the dress.
869;If you like movies and cartoons combo, you will love this.
870;WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT is a funny cool movie.
871;i've seem this movie more than 10 times, and it still gives me a smile.
872;this movie is a groundbreaker for the movies that mix real characters and cartoons together.
873;Hilarious, original, and super cool!
874;The 80's produced some classic gems during its time, and this one (IMO) tops them all!I loved this film so much as a kid.
875;Even as an adult, I still enjoy watching it.
876;I believe it's great family entertainment.
877;It contains a solid plot, excellent acting, smart script, fantastic visuals, and an abundance of your favorite LOONEY toons!
878;do expect plenty of laughs and the wonderful added mystery and suspense!
879;a classic in every sense.
880;rekindling the Golden Age of American animation.
881;It's great to see again after all these years.
882;whan ensues is a madcap chase through human and toon.
883;The film is every bit as funny as it was in 1988 even if the at.
884;Roger Rabbit is definitely a must for anime collectors.
885;Beautiful graphics and oh so interesting storyline and characters.
886;Not really for young kids as the villain is a real meanie with his dip .
887;The bonus features were all very entertaining and interesting as well.
888;It was one of the earlier CGI/actor/cartoon interactions, but the cast, the direction, the story, everything works on every level.
889;This is one of those movies that is endless and timeless.
890;One that we watch several times.
891;Great movie for and indoor afternoon.
892;Pop a bag of popcorn, sit back and relax and just enjoy.
893;Two thumbs up for the movie, God bless, and make it your best day!
894;where you could freeze frame at certain points in the video and see clever things inserted by the animators.
895;It's interesting that the cartoon at the beginning still has the noise.
896;I guess they want it that way for effect, but the rest of the video is pristine.
897;time favorite films, recently released on Blu.
898;I must say that it is held up extremely well after nearly a quarter of a century, and remains, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made.
899;The plot is a classic whodunit made in the style of 1940s noir, like The Maltese Falcon, a style that it captures quite well.
900;The plot does keep you guessing (assuming you've never seen it before), with clues and red herrings aplenty.
901;The protagonist Eddie Valiant, played by Bob Hoskins in a superb performance, has the perfect accent and outlook to pull off the closed off hard.
902;Christopher Lloyd as the villain Judge Doom is another perfect casting, as a threatening and formidable threat to the safety of Toontown.
903;what propels this film to its legendary status is the unbelievable and unparalleled cinematography.
904;The audience's suspension of disbelief is complete and all encompassing, as you truly do believe that these cartoon characters are interacting with the real world.
905;The shadows match, the perspective matches, essentially everything about these cartoons is made to look real part from the celluloid.
906;The effects are so great that the cartoons can even interact with real.
907;world objects, and the objects move believably.
908;All in all, this film is as close to perfect, I believe, as a film can get.
909;ray release a great too.
910;Also included are the original Roger rabbit shorts that appeared in front of Disney films in the early 1990s, which are all great and stay true to the tone of the film.
911;I give it my highest recommendation for any film lover, animation lover, or just anybody who likes cartoons from when they were a kid.
912;This is a great movie!!
913;It is from a bygone era where you could find animation mixed with live acting, and it is done at its best.
914;It is great seeing Disney and Warner bros characters interacting on the screen and I would highly recommend it.
915;deserved Oscars for Editing, Visual Effects, Sound Effects Editing, and Special Achievement (animation direction) recommend this delightful film, which combines live action and animation before CGI came into regular use.
916;Watch for the beautifully realized details throughout.
917;The interaction between live action and animation is so good, you quickly forget they're not really together at all .
918;"and much of the credit for such realistic ""interaction"" must go to live actor Bob Hoskins."
919;There are a load of extras in this 2.
920;This is a technical masterpiece and well worth seeing again and again.
921;Yes, I was really pleased, arrived in a timely manner and was just as I expected.
922;I Loved the the fact the whole family can watch it.
923;loaded, double disc set with tons of extras and a great commentary track.
924;There's a family friendly full screen version as well as a pristine widescreen transfer.
925;Part film noir, part period who dunnit and part cartoon, this breakthrough mixed genre is most remarkable for Bob Hoskins' incredible performance as an American gumshoe's bad acid trip into a demented toon town.
926;This is the best classic movie ever and they should make a second part to this.
927;and other children be able to enjoy this classic just like we did.
928;Nice version of a very fun movie.
929;Register a protest vote today!
930;Roger rabbit is married to a beautiful woman name Jessica Rabbit.
931;This movie brought back memories of the good old days.
932;I found it fun and endearing.
933;Truly a classic in creativity
934;It was very funny and fun to watch.
935;I my kids and grandchildren really liked it too.
936;It also turns out that Roger was at the Acme Warehouse around the same time!
937;It comes to an hilarious end in this wonderful movie, and it is the only film to find Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny in one scene.
938;It also is very easy to navigate, and this disc doesn't have a director's commentary.
939;They all feature the same basic story: In a Maroon Cartoon, Roger has to take care of Baby Herman and ends up in wild fashion.
940;The real treat of each of these are the endings.
941;Shown with Disney films through 1993, the shorts are extremely well thought out, clever, and hilarious with a personal touch by Mr. Spielburg himslef.
942;Many Roger fans flocked to it to see the short, yet they were also pleasantly suprised to see what followed.
943;This is defintely the best looking of the shorts, with excellent effects to keep you watching and laughing.
944;esque ride through a saw mill.
945;A little hard to navigate (they could've sharpened up the menu a bit), but wonderfully done.
946;This disc features both the movie and the commentary, along with a slew of extras.
947;the commentary is great, with Robert Zemickis and others who pitched in with the film.
948;with both the final product and the original shot product with blue.
949;Behind the Ears: The Making of Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an excellent 36.
950;Valiant Files combines image gallerys with a snoop.
951;This has some great images and drawings, a must.
952;I was surprised to watch it again and discover just how well the combination of the animation and the live action photography has held up.
953;and it's really neat to watch cartoons manipulate live action props.
954;I had always wondered how that was accomplished.
955;The supplemental material is interesting and well organized.
956;The first disc is essentially for kids and passing fans.
957;It has the widescreen version and the commentary.
958;There is even a fun set.
959;Silly as this sounds, it ended up being kind of fun, partly because they had the good sense to make it an actual search, fraught with disappointing leads that bring you nowhere.
960;everyone in my family can enjoy this !
961;I really love this move and it was so easy to download on my comp and other media players , The amazon instant video is awesome!
962;I love how it was set in 1940s L. a.
963;Amazing to think this is twenty years old.
964;I found it to be very informative and very interesting to see how this movie was made and just how much dedication and extremely hard work it took just to get all the years.
965;worth animation included with the live.
966;Great acting and great writing in this classic movie.
967;the movie is so great it just wow i cant say how great this movie is i feel it just rocks
968;Even with all the new technology we have today, 'Roger Rabbit' still surpasses them.
969;From live action to the animation, these perfect cast of actors portrayed their characters in a seamless fashion.
970;This movie dealt with the scandals of Hollywood while cleverly mixing in genius animation, making it a classic for any one, young or old, to enjoy.
971;If you loved it that much, give the movie its rightful stars.
972;frame moments that are well.
973;"i mean, kids hearing Dolores ask Eddie, ""Is that a rabbit in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?"""
974;this film is just a masterpiece, a landmark in movie history.
975;There are so many great moments that I wouldn't know where to start.
976;Suffice to say this is one of those rare movies where every aspect of the creative talents brought to bear came together perfectly, from the music to the sets to direction to casting to the animation to lighting and whatever else you might think of.
977;"two favorite moments: The ""singing sword"" Eddie briefly tries to use against the villain (I'll not name this villain, just on the off."
978;Most people didnt know LA actually did have a great mass transit system at one time so even though this movie pokes fun at a lot of things it is based on some truths.
979;The movie looks good, no complaints there.
980;There was a good amount of effort put into that 10 years ago.
981;The interaction between humans and cartoon characters seems real.
982;Refreshing look on a classic.
983;The images and details are fabulous.
984;Made the greatest gift and brings Roger and Jessica into the 21st c!
985;This was my nephew's favorite movie from when he was little.
986;I was so excited to find it and give it to him.
987;good for all ages .
988;brings back many memories of my favorite cartoon caracters
989;These children were thrilled and loved the movie!!
990;I loved this movie when ot first came put over 20 years ago and mow my son loves this classic too.
991;I loved it so much because I could not find it anywhere else.
992;i was hoping for a visual treat on Blu.
993;the movie as a whole is enjoyable.
994;I forgot how much fun this movie was, as it has been quite some time since it's original release.
995;haired Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Amy Irving and Kathleen Turner) is one of the more enduring new noir characters and as it should be, it's the diabolical dame who's believed to be the root of all evil.
996;(Fans of the movie should definitely read the book, as well.
997;Warning: it's much more adult than the film!)
998;Good movie, still 20 years later.
999;"Intimately reconstructed Los Angeles of the 1940s, where people said things like ""who needs a car in LA, we've got the best public transportation system in the world."""
1000;Wild noir stuff, contrasted with goofy kids stuff.
1001;Trail Mixiup shows Ranger Jessica.
1002;"Between legs shot: ""Only you can prevent forest fires"" in sexy voice."
1003;I love you more than any woman has ever loved a rabbit.
1004;jessica is somewhere in between a human and a toon.
1005;JOel Silver first human actor in the whole show.
1006;Bob Hoskins did a perfect American accent.
1007;I loved this movie when it first came out, and just wanted to make sure it was in my collection.
1008;ray is an added plus!
1009;I loved this movie that's why I ordered it.
1010;The music and mood are more cinema noir than almost all American attempts to actually be cinema noir.
1011;there's a funny gap in Roger Rabbit in that intelligent adults will understand all of it and love it, little kids will understand some of it and love it, and older kids and less.
1012;I bought this for our 26 year old son for Christmas.
1013;He loved the movie growing up.
1014;It is still a lot of fun to watch.
1015;The special effects are great!
1016;Especially appreciated were the Road Runner cartoons and Fantasia, the latter a favorite for the blossoming drug generation.
1017;It seemed a logical step from adults appreciating cartoons to the emergence of adult features like Fritz the Cat and Cool World, as well as adolescent/adult television favorites like The Simpsons, King of the Hill, and Beavis and Butthead.
1018;And now the animated feature has become a serious box office contender with the likes of Aladdin, The Lion King, Mulan, and Anastasia.
1019;stands the witty and inventive Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
1020;Superficially, this part animated, part live.
1021;but, within the same framework, the film dishes out sophisticated parody and earnest historical references.
1022;Because director Robert Zemeckis cannot satisfy both audiences, he opts to satisfy the child within the adult audience, consistent for the Zemeckis and Spielberg (executive producer) canon, and never fully takes his parody and history to the end of the line.
1023;much of Roger Rabbit's plot derives from Chinatown's .
1024;the detective being set up, a past incident affecting the detective's life, and corruption involving a public utility.
1025;After Eddie shows Roger Rabbit the pictures, the Chinatown allusion hits older audience members and brings fidgety amusement.
1026;Inexpensive motels, restaurants that serve rapidly prepared food, tire salons, automobile dealerships, and wonderful, wonderful billboards reaching as far as the eye can see.
1027;My God, it'll be beautiful.
1028;In Roger Rabbit, the judge's company, Cloverleaf Industries, has bought the trolley system and plans to dismantle it.
1029;good mentality fostered by the Spielmeckis worldview.
1030;Herein lies the knack to absorb realities and present them with the most realistic and impressive touches (Forrest Gump, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), to the point of basing an extreme fantasy .
1031;Toontown must stay alive, to be the repository for our dreams of a simpler, better time and people.
1032;I didn't get the cardboard sleeve like I had seen at most retailers, and the price was the same, so was a little let down, but still a well done Blu.
1033;As far as I can tell all the special features from the previous 2.
1034;A real classic to hold on to just a real fun movie.
1035;Great for the whole family.
1036;The transfer of the film is good, the source suffers from the generational loss unavoidable before CGI compositing.
1037;With this and The Rocketeer Disney shows no love for our old favorites.
1038;one for widescreen presentation, and one for full.
1039;The first disc, the full.
1040;the animation, I admit, is beautiful, but even there, I founed the colors to look very pastel and washed.
1041;As a homage to old cartoons, it's a minor bit of fun.
1042;I love this movie am going to watch this movie over and over and never give it up cos of how funny it is .
1043;Very enjoyable concept movie with animation and humans interacting as real life brings out the true acting abilities necessary when you keep in mind it is all done with animation and green screen.

1047;Picture is crisp and clear and the sound is great.
1048;The First ever animation and live action combined movie.
1049;This film is one of the greatest technological achievements in film history,imaginative,brilliant,incredible and funny, Two Big Thumbs way up.
1050;the Best movie of 1988, one of the best of the decade and the 20th century.
1051;Roger and Jessica is the best toons since Mickey,Bugs and Bettie Boop.
1052;this film created Cool World and Space Jam, and it's best of it's kind.
1053;It's imaginative how in our world toons are lined drawings that move and that we like believe are real, in this world their living walking talking lifeforms.
1054;I recommend this so you can see how animation and live action pregressed since Mary Poppins and Bednobs and broomsticks.
1055;"This is a wonderful movie
1056;But beware: you'll be moved to tears by the single most hideous act of cruelty I've ever seen portrayed in any film.
1057;And the shoe is alive!!
1058;The rest of it is very, very good.

1065;Christopher Lloyde shows he has true gritt.
1066;I checked, and this is correct.
1067;In Wolf's story, comic strips are created by photographging Toons.
1068;Roger Rabbit is easily the equal of anything made during Hollywood's """"Golden Age""""."""
1069;We finally have it in a format that does justice to its innovative visual effects.
1070;"(It's worth noting that Zemeckis's ""Back to the Future"" trilogy was transferred to Blu."
1071;ray from freshly struck prints .
1072;The running commentary is especially good, with a great deal of interesting material.
1073;I remember taking my sister to see it the day after I saw it for the first time at the theater.
1074;Through it all, we see an enjoyable send.
1075;If you haven't seen it, this is a brilliant merger of live.
1076;the story's a good one, too.
1077;There are lots of ins and outs, a complex land grab, a personal tragedy, and loyalties that surface under pressure.
1078;comprehensible, but has enough to keep an adult interested.
1079;This one's great for the kid in anybody.
1080;cake with Roger's sultry wife, Jessica (Kathleen Turner).
1081;Roger, Jessica and Valiant do their best to prove Roger's innocence and save the fate of Toontown.
