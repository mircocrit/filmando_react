id;spiegazione
1;Rob Marshall's brilliant vision in adapting the phenomenal Broadway revival (still running on B'way as of Mar/08) to screen is a pleasure and a guilty one at that!Superb performances all around and of course Zeta.
2;Richard Gere is a delight as the smarmy lawyer and sings with an appropriate 1920's nasal tenor!Obviously I give this film a high recommendation and looking forward to watching it over and over.
3;"Chicago is one of my favorite stage shows
4;All of the stars did highly admirable jobs with their characters, especially John C. Reilly as Amos Hart.
5;As a theatre person, and Broadway groupie, I have to mention that the ensemble dancers are largely culled from the ranks of Broadway 'gypsies'.
6;it's also the reason that the musical numbers are really what make this movie fly.
7;The above mentioned """"All That Jazz"""" sets the tone for the entire movie by """"out."""
8;"dropping and ""Cell Block Tango"" actually moved me to tears."
9;his concept for inserting musical numbers is flawless.
10;"His Broadway background and knowledge certainly saved this movie from the fate of ""Evita"" and ""A Chorus Line""."
11;What an awesome movie experience.
12;"Bob Fosse's ""Chicago"" is a spectacular and naughty musical."
13;Even though the women are desperate, they also crave the publicity that oddly gets them help from the papers if they know how to use it.
14;The numbers and choreography are steamy and smooth, and the story is entertaining.
15;The performances are good, but don't require any subtlety.
16;Queen Latifah is particularly fun as the female warden.
17;The scenes are interspersed well and flow at a good pace.
18;I just want to start out by saying I do enjoy musicals and all types of movies.
19;The movie Chicago has great musical numbers, humor, drama, but there was something missing.
20;I think the reviewers who really enjoyed it were happy to see something from Broadway make it to the big screen and that it was done well.
21;I thought the performances were very good but the size disparity between Rene and Catherine throws off some of the scenes especially when they are dancing together.
22;Chicago is traditional in it's form, and uses the very distinct Fosse dance moves to heat up the screen.
23;Moulin Rouge uses pop songs along with a classic love story while turning it inside out using modern movie making techniques.
24;The film's All That Jazz opening is so impressive, it's hard to put into words.
25;"I really liked the part when Velma whips around on ""all."
26;It was a good idea from whoever had it.
27;finally, I am sure a lot of people who see Chicago will enjoy it.
28;To those who don't, at least admire the excellent craftsmanship that went into it.
29;i loved 'Moulin Rouge' for what it is and I loved 'Chicago' for what it is.
30;I enjoyed the performances in both films, and I don't think the people (Ewan McGregor, Nicole Kidman, Rob Marshall, etc) involved with either film will ever win enough awards to satisfy those of us who adore the movie/musical.
31;On one final note, about the Oscars, the only one I have a problem with is Nicole Kidman's win for 'The Hours.'
32;They know it, we know it, and oh well.
33;Chicago quite simply is jaw.
34;An insatiable, clever, sexy, stylish, and incredibly bizarre masterpiece of film.
35;making that gets the blood pumping and will leave you in awe.
36;A sinful delight that temptingly calls to you and you can't take your eyes off the screen at really any point.
37;Pure eye candy and pure deliciousness that no other musical can match.
38;mUSIC: Every musical scene is vibrant and filled with life.
39;There is not a single bad musical scene, they were all simply amazing and brilliant the whole way through.
40;aCTING: Fantastic and superbly accomplished in every way.
41;Whether it be one of the many amazing musical scenes or even the funny bits of humor, everything came to life.
42;The cinematography, set pieces, and visual look are simply to die for.
43;An adult musical all the way.
44;oVERALL: If you have taste in film, then Chicago is a must.
45;A treat for the mind and the soul that burns into your memory and won't let go.
46;The best damn musical to ever hit cinema, period.
47;"The new sure fire hit musical ""Chicago,"" will prove that the 2003 movie season will be the best one in a long time."
48;"sure enough, films like ""Chicago"" will start Hollywood's great quest back to stylish and brilliant movies."
49;A young woman returns for her turn on stage, and sings.
50;Murder is a form of entertainment in Chicago.
51;There is a surprise witness in court.
52;examination of Velma Kelly is educational.
53;And so the jury delivers a verdict.
54;Another sensation to capture the attention of newspaper readers.
55;The Girls of Murder City is more educational and entertaining than this musical.
56;the song / dance pieces blended very naturally into the film's flow and dialog.
57;This was greatly enhanced by the fact that the cast members performed all the songs and dances themselves.
58;The greatest surprise was John C. Reilly's performance of Mr. Cellophane , even though lately he seems to be type cast as the not .
59;unlike Catherine Zeta Jones, who surprised many viewers with her singing dancing ability, Ren e Zellweger's voice can best be described as.
60;This is a really fun movie with great acting and great music.
61;There are so many wonderful actors in this movie.
62;chicago is a musicial movie its a butiful movie that thrilling the audience.
63;i really enjoyed watching this movie.
64;I love this movie so much, the music is great, the storyline is great, and so is the cast.
65;Chicago is my second favorite musical right behind Grease.
66;Her acting is so vulnerable and fascinating, she is not like any other actress nowadays.
67;Her singing is great, boy i was pleasantly surprised, Catherine Zeta.
68;jones and Richard Gere are great as well.
69;Fabulous dance numbers, catchy songs, and a superb directing job by Rob Marshall.
70;The audio commentary is also very good.
71;It is fast paced, has a solid storyline, and excellent tap dance number by Gere.
72;Get this movie today, it will have you dancing like a nutcase, but a stylish nutcase.
73;"I've heard it called the best movie of the year, and I don't agree, but I was greatly entertained
74;dancers plow through the material, and thought all involved pulled it off quite well, especially Catherine Zeta.
75;She had just the right tone as a seductive murderess obsessed with fame"
76;seeker, but she showed great flair in her singing and dancing.
77;"As for Queen Latifah, keep putting her in films
78;All in all, I wouldn't call this the best film of the year, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself and I'd watch it again.
79;Because the last one, very eccentric and strange, captured my interest so deeply I bought the tape later on.
80;But Chicago it`s worthwhile, being funny and dynamic.
81;It was the best movie I`ve seen in a LONG time!
82;The music, the songs, the dancing, the acting were all something to be remembered.
83;The fact that Zellweger, Jones and Gere did their own singing/dancing only shows how amazingly talented they all are.
84;catherine Zeta Jones definitely steals the show in my opinion.
85;The Acedemy was right on in their decision to award her with that Oscar!
86;Really, I just can`t say enough about her talent, beauty, and overall performance.
87;Again, this part was perfectly cast.
88;renee Zellweger was great, not as amazing as some of the others, but great.
89;She`s just naturally cute and that`s perfect for the role of Roxie, """"the sweetest little lady accused of murder""""."""
90;Also, I gotta say I love her voice, its very jazzy and sweet.
91;aBSOLUTELY Amazing, beautifully made, and just plain fun.
92;Even for those who don`t really get into the whole song and dance thing.
93;"Add to that the awesome soundtrack with the hilarious ""Funny Honey"", ""Razzle Dazzle"" and ""We Both Reached for the Gun"", sexy and fun ""Cell Block Tango"" (one of my favorite) and beautifully sung ""Nowadays""."
94;and you`ve got one great movie!
95;My dad even watched it with me (after some persuasion) and he loved it too!
96;We both thought we were going to hate this movie but we loved it instead.
97;This movie is awesome and it is a great musical.
98;This is an awesome movie, great to sing along.
99;The cast is awsome, as well as the costumes and sets.
100;Richard, Renee, and Catherine really are singing and dancing out their parts.
101;The sound track is just as good.
102;I recently saw the Broadway play Chicago and loved it that I had to see the movie.
103;The movie was excellent and both the play and movie were as good as each other.
104;Renee Zellweger did a terrific job as Roxie Hart and has a wonderful voice!
105;Every song and dance number are excellent and tell an entertaining story of murder and life in prison.
106;This was one of the best musical movies I've seen!!
107;I'm sure maturity helped but this is one outstanding musical.
108;The music itself is orchestrated perfectly with a irresistable sound.
109;"The singing which has a raw ""one take"" sound to it, grabs you."
110;I have never liked Richard Gere much, but he does well.
111;For immortalizing a theatrical gem on film and making it even better than the stage musical, we owe Rob Marshall and every person responsible for the making of this movie deep gratitude.
112;As true today as the day the story was written, this socio.
113;political commentary is deserving of every accolade it has received, and a stellar place in the history of film.
114;It is simply deserving of being the 75th Oscar Best Picture!
115;Having seen remarkable performances on the Broadway stage, I doubted that Renee can do justice to the role.
116;Renee turned in a tour de force performance!
117;jones, Richard Gere, John C. Reilly, Queen Latifah and every person in the cast!
118;Bob Fosse is rejoicing in heaven.
119;I can't believe this won all those awards (Best Picture???)
120;It looked great, and the acting was good, but I never gathered any sympathy or empathy with any of the characters, and the music itself didn't do much for me either.
121;It's a movie that shows a nice repitoire of dance and song by C Z. j. we love it a lot
122;A must see for adults.
123;I came to see this movie with some doubt, It had very good reviews and lots of nominations for the Golden Globe, I had seen the trailer and thought, well, it will be either very good or very dull.
124;And since it was Rob Marshall's first movie, it was all a mystery, but then the film started and wow did it rocked, or should I say, it jazzed.
125;first, the cast, all of them were magnificent, thank good they all got award.
126;"And finaly, John C. Reilly, he was fantastic as Amos ""Cellophane"" Hart, and well, I can accept Chris Copper winning, but at least he got the nomination."
127;chicago is great and I think both people who know a lot about films can love it just as casual movie viewers, and that's good, isn't grand , isn't great, isn't swell.
128;Anyway, I recomend this film a lot, personaly, it's not only good, it's very relaxing, you just sit back and enjoy good filmaking that has humour, sexy women in sexy dance numbers, plus a story with lot's of content and that is very enjoyable.
129;To see if it's worthy of spending give or take [few] bucks on it, I think Chicago is very worthy, and most likely, after you see it, you will feel the same.
130;Apart from terrific music and dazzling (and dizzying!)
131;In fact, the prime reason for the very existence of showbiz is the media hype created by a smart minority in order to be enjoyed by the brainless masses.
132;Family and friendship are viewed through the all.
133;goodness, truth, love, integrity, honesty, whatever .
134;are perverted on a grand scale.
135;It mixes all that and a lot more into a potent cocktail of rambunctious fun and razor.
136;likewise, the dialogue and the lyrics are brimming with unforgettable lines.
137;Would you please tell the audience.
138;Give 'em the old razzle dazzle.
139;"Give 'em an act with lots of flash in it and the reaction will be passionate."""
140;"Even if you don't want to be bothered with any serious issues, you can still enjoy Chicago"" as 110 minutes of unabashed fun."
141;This is what makes the movies a real masterpiece: it is relentlessly hilarious.
142;Not the least of its merits is that both Roxie and Velma, the two chief singer.
143;murderesses, are presented with sympathy and even compassion.
144;It's a real story about real people.
145;the cast is every bit as perfect as the feasts for the eyes and the ears.
146;Renee Zellweger (Roxie) is not quite up to the mark as far as singing and dancing are concerned, but she is nevertheless a fine actress.
147;She certainly conveys very convincingly Roxie's transformation from a disingenuous girl in the beginning to a shrewd woman in the end.
148;He is in his element here.
149;"all in all, ""Chicago"" is uncannily close to perfection."
150;It can be seen as a farcical comedy pure and simple, and therefore enjoyed without any participation of you central nervous system.
151;Rob Marshall's masterful direction and simply superb choreography are quite enough for that, although the lavish visual side, the pointed dialogue (and lyrics) and the jazzy splendour of the soundtrack do help.
152;On the other hand, masterpieces work on multiple levels.
153;Chicago of the 1920s is a gorgeous setting but the message is pretty timeless.
154;Indeed, not only does it still ring true today, but it becomes more and more relevant.
155;"either way, if you enjoy Bob Fosse's classics ""Cabaret"" (1972) and ""All That Jazz"" (1979), you definitely should see ""Chicago"" (2002) as well
156;A magnificent spectacle with a lot of fun and a lot of food for thought.
157;This film is a good attempt to do what was done in Moulin Rouge.
158;moulin Rouge was just so good and the directing and acting were so masterful.
159;Good Luck Next time .
160;It is nice from time to time, see Hollywood trying again for dreaming.
161;This movie takes you to a world of fantasy and pleasure.
162;The truly domain of movie makers as dream makers.
163;Plus, a touch of 30's glamour with good music and dancing.
164;Chicago is, after all, a nice mild of Bob.
165;fose and golden Broadway 's squeezed on a film format.
166;Great job of Ren e Zellweger who looks beautiful and dances better, and also of Catherine Zeta Jones who, despite Oscar.
167;award, should have share laurels.
168;This is one of the best musicals in the last quarter century.
169;on a par with My Fair Lady and Cabaret.
170;Singing and dancing outstanding, serious and funny parts and the actors seem really into their roles.
171;The catchy tunes and great dance steps won't soon be forgotten.
172;This is a great musical, that won 6 Acadmeny awards.
173;By the second time, or the first with the subtiles, you will be singing along.
174;This about a murderess, well mostly two murderess.
175;Velma works on the stage.
176;I'm a 'reincarnated Jazz Baby' so I love the film and the Roaring Twenties.
177;Fantastic choreography, authentic costumes, GREAT musical numbers.
178;As to the essence of the story, I have read reviews here that seem to demand a certain style to musicals .
179;happy, uplifting, a champagne toast to life.
180;In other words, singing nuns, either flying or climbing over mountains.
181;Both of these musicals are standards of the American theatre.
182;type of musical so popular from the 20's to the 70's.
183;I make up my own mind.
184;I must say that I was blown away by the sheer genius and excellence of the film.
185;Her beautiful voice and masterful dance skill is worthy of the great white way.
186;A Tony may have been a more appropriate award as opposed to her much deserved Oscar.
187;Then my biggest fear, Richard Gere as Billy Flinn, was in a word perfect.
188;like choreography, expert lighting and singing (by many broadway veterans in the chours as extras) this dark comedy shines.
189;Also with great cameos and supporting performances by the great Chita Rivera ( original broadway cast),John C. Reily (oscar nominated),Lucy Liu, and Christine Baranski this film shines as one of the greatest ever made, not just as a musical, but as a film.
190;Rob Marshall's directorial debut deserves all of it's accolades.
191;John C. Reilly almost steals the show with his amazing number.
192;I've always been a fan of great musical theatre and these folks should take this show on the road.
193;I thought this movie was great!
194;The musical numbers are terrific and they get stuck in your mind for days.
195;It's just a fun movie to watch.
196;How in the world this won ANY Oscar is beyond me!
197;all musicals seem to be written in avery narrow band of chords, this one is right there!
198;well Zeta was kinda easy on the eyes.
199;that innovative musical made this one seem stale and old hat.
200;The film seems so delighted at poking fun at Chicago and its corrupt justice system .
201;At least she was better than Richard Gere .
202;Chicago is one of the very best movie musicals to come out of Hollywood in a long long time.
203;It has a stunning cast with all the principals turning in memorable performances.
204;I have always liked Catherine Zeta.
205;Richard Gere was wonderful as was Queen Latifah and John C Reilly who I also never knew could sing.
206;His rendition of """"Mr Cellophane"""" is heartbreaking."""
207;Kudos to Rob Marshall for the superb direction.
208;This is one of my favorite movies!
209;I am just starting to build my blue ray collection and this is the perfect start for it!
210;Chicago is an incredible movie.
211;Even if you're not the biggest fan of musicals, you should still give this film a try.
212;it has action, drama, and even a bit of comedy.
213;The audience seemed to love every moment of it, clapping and laughing during several parts.
214;this film is clever and powerful and beautifully done.
215;The power of Chicago translated beautifully from the theatre to the Silver Screen.
216;The visuals and cinematography was incredible, and each musical number smoothly blending with the story.
217;I was completely blown away by the cast, especially Catherine Zeta Jones and Richard Gere.
218;They were absolutely incredible and such a pleasure to watch on screen.
219;She was definitely the brightest talent in this film, and though she was one of the major roles it was still too bad that she didn't have more screen time.
220;She fit her role nicely, and though she doesn't have nearly as powerful of a voice as Catherine nor does she seem quite as comfortable dancing on stage, she was still rather impressive.
221;I have to also note that Queen Latifah was fantastic!
222;She managed to make her character seem funny, loveable, selfish, and rotten all at the same time.
223;She also proved herself quite well during her musical number.
224;Overall, this film is absolutely amazing.
225;I imagine it will be a major Oscar contender.
226;One reviewer, Daniel Wahl, even rants about how the movie industry is taking a happy wonderful genre and turning it dark and horrible.
227;Well, I want to say that I personally can't stand those syrupy sweet, unrealistic musicals where everything is so nice, the good guys always win with a minimum of effort and all is right with the world.
228;It is a classic, having been written and rewritten as a classic Broadway musical and various movie versions, one starring Marilyn Monroe.
229;It is dark AND sexy, and the scene with the lady murderers singing about killing their men is one of the sexiest in the movie.
230;If you want a truly spectacular movie musical, get Chicago.
231;My wife loves the movie and was excited to see it in the widescreen.
232;Packaging was excellent and it was delivered as promised.
233;This is the best musical I have seen in years.
234;I really enjoyed it watching it on my laptop.
235;I really enjoyed every second of it.
236;It's a definite must see if you like great acting, great music, and great costumes.
237;Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!
238;Had the characters been written as seedy and flawed, yet somehow portrayed by the actors as likeable and human, then that would have been amazing acting.
239;And I found myself thinking they deserved to go to jail!Maybe the play was better.
240;Me and my music major friends saw this movie 10 times!
241;Thats what this movie is all about just having fun with the music.
242;"My fav line is ""who said that marders not an art"" Get your friends together pop this in and your sure to have a great time!"
243;I hope it brings you as much fun as it did me and my friends
244;What can one say about this movie except it is one of the best musicals of all time to me.
245;at lease i watch it the most.
246;everyone does a good job in the movie and i even watch it on my ipod at the gym as it is good for exercise.
247;jones is truly talented and has a strong, wonderful and beautiful voice.
248;Her performance really surprised me.
249;jones, Ren e Zellweger, and Richard Gere shocked me completely.
250;I had no idea they could sing or dance like that, and every number was so rich with talent and life that I found myself lost in the movie.
251;as Richard Gere said, each song really does have amazing entertainment value.
252;The music, lyrics, performance of the actors, the choreographing.
253;I have never before enjoyed musicals and while this one does have its old Broadway persona to live up to, it is truly a wonderful movie.
254;ren e Zellweger's musical performance pales a bit in comparison to the rest, especially to Zeta.
255;jones whose previous musical experience was unknown to many, but she did a wonderful job portraying the star.
256;Richard Gere (Billy Flynn) gives a wonderful performance with his acting and singing, as well as tap dancing which he learned just for this movie.
257;queen Latifah (Mama Morton) and John C. Reilly (Amos Hart) were wonderful as well, and everyone really did hold their own.
258;The casting was well done, the singing and dancing (all performed by the actors themselves) is simply wonderful and will keep you glued in your seat and locked on the screen from start to end.
259;I was absolutely amazed by this musical made movie.
260;jones, Zelleweger and Gere's performances are incredible.
261;Their singing voices are perfect for this film, and their dancing is stupendous.
262;"Mind you, there aren't your typical deleted scenes, but finally being able to see the deleted song ""Class"" is worth it."
263;Plus, the short documentary on the making of the film was good fun.
264;once in a regional theater and twice on Broadway.
265;The film, Chicago, is the best of them all.
266;The performances are flawless and the rendition of the great songs of this show are musically, vocally, and visually memorable.
267;This is a great show and a great movie.
268;I was so pleased to see this edition being released on Blu.
269;Chicago is one of my favorite musicals ever, and the screen version truly does the script and performances justice.
270;The acting and the visuals are great.
271;Love the music and Taye Diggs is great eye candy.
272;the movie (unlike the musical theater production) has absolutely gorgeous costumes and goes into much more detail about the story so that you understand completely what is happening.
273;Rob Marshall did such an amazing job with this movie .
274;the musical numbers being part of Roxie's imagination was a great touch.
275;jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and John C. Reilly were perfect in their roles (as were everyone else!)
276;those wonderful Kander and Ebb songs are sung so right on!I also love the Razzle Dazzle edition of the movie because of the awesome special features.
277;And I loved the Chita Rivera and Liza Minelli extras!This movie is just wonderful .
278;it brings to life the original intent of Maurine Watkins' play with the beloved Kander and Ebb songs and stunning costumes and visuals.
279;Bob Fosse's sexy cynicism still shines in Chicago, a faithful movie adaptation of the choreographer.
280;jones are beautifully matched as Jazz Age vixens, and Richard Gere gleefully sheds his customary cool to belt out a showstopper.
281;(Yes, they all do their own singing and dancing.)
282;cut style, the film's sheer exuberance is intoxicating.
283;screen musicals in the last 25 years, that's a cause for singing, dancing, cheering.
284;Even though I am a live theatre fan and have seen the show on stage, I thought the movie was amazing.
285;Of course the vocals and choreography were fabulous, but what I especially liked was the lighting and special effects.
286;Kudos to everyone in the cast and crew!
287;You can credit `Chicago' with bringing the beloved musical back into our lives, even if it doesn't really deserve the full credit.
288;Just the year before the marvelous (and superior) `Moulin Rouge!'
289;managed an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and surely paved the way for `Chicago' to win the Oscar.
290;The year before that `art house' master Lars von Trier gave us the brilliant `Dancer in the Dark', and while it didn't manage a Best Picture nomination, it caused a major stir with the critics and definitely got a lot of people talking.
291;"it is a great film, truly absorbing and thoroughly entertaining
292;taking a saucy stage play and giving it its due on the big screen is a big undertaking.
293;I have seen the stage play a few times and devour it every time"
294;the film tells the story of Roxie Hart, the aspiring singer who gets a little carried away during a lovers spat and takes a man's life.
295;i really liked the way that director Gary Marshall constructed the film.
296;It gives it a very `showy' feel that gives the illusion of watching a cabaret variety show.
297;"This approach is needed to give the film some style
298;as far as the performances are concerned, there is a lot of love here.
299;jones won the Oscar for her dynamic portrayal of the washed up Velma Kelly.
300;She ravishes on screen and just completely engulfs every scene she is in.
301;Her `song and dance' pleading with Roxie is sensational to put it lightly.
302;She is an aspiring singer, and one gets the impression that she is aspiring because she lacks the talent to really survive.
303;She is arrogant and pretty confident, but the fact remains that she hasn't made it.
304;She needs this trial to become a star, and that speaks volumes for her natural talent.
305;I love Reilly, and in 2002 he had a stellar year (appearing in THREE Best Picture nominees"
306;His subdued and emotional work in `The Good Girl' should have nabbed him the nomination.
307;and BTW, those set pieces and costumes are all sorts of spectacular!
308;I saw the play Fosse (the man who wrote Chicago), and I didn't like it very much, but Chicago is amazing.
309;"The story is fair
310;The acting is very good, but once again, no Lord of the Rings.
311;It's the music and dance numbers are the real money makers for this movie, though.
312;She imagines everything as a show, including her trial (check out Richard Gere's suit in that scene!)
313;I guarantee that you will enjoy this movie.
314;This one is certainly not boring, but not a masterpiece.
315;Directing is excellent and so is the execution of stage numbers.
316;Plot is average, but does keep you interested.
317;These oridinary movie could be easily found in serial dramas(Cops dramas) in any part of the world.
318;I'm a huge musical theatre fan, and I love a happy ending as much as the next gal, but dark musicals like this are FUN to watch if you have the right expectations.
319;Is Chicago the best musical ever?
320;No, and its not even my very favorite show but this movie is a wonderful version if you can't see the stage show.
321;With that being said, the music for this movie is WONDERFUL and somewhat true to the stage version.
322;jones and Zellweger give (suprisingly!)
323;wonderful performances, as does Richard Gere.
324;If you want to see fun, dazzling show.
325;Any husand or boyfriend who goes to see this with his wife or girlfriend just has to take it with good humor.
326;jones, Richard Gere AND Rene Zelwegger are all good actors, no matter how much plastic surgury any of them have had, and deseve recognition for their performances.
327;It shows you what people will do for fame, yes, but it also shows you that those people don't end up happy.
328;all of that aside, it is a great musical and you can critisize it all you want, but at least have a legitimate reason!
329;Casting is supreme in this over the top musical.
330;What does, ultimately, engage the viewer is the stirring, toe.
331;shaking delight of the music.
332;Chicago is a visceral, sensual sundae of inventive dance moves, excellent performances (Richard Gere's tap.
333;a tour de force of female angst and aggression that, while wholly unsympathetic in its tepid rationales for its protagonists' acts of murder, manages to interject wry humor and sardonic commentary into the stunning dance moves and memorable harmonies.

335;"and she belts out ""When You're Good to Mama"" with conviction and confidence."
336;Kudos to all the musicians, songwriters and choreographers who created this fun and fearless film.
337;Chicago is a sensory delight .
338;I found myself thinking it was like a cross between Cabaret and The Scottsboro Boys.
339;This is my test of whether the musical is of real value.
340;"The first musical to win the Best Picture Oscar after 34 years, this 2002 Rob Marshall's adaptation of a 1975 Broadway musical lacks the warmth and romance of the 2001 Baz Luhrmann's hit ""Moulin Rouge"", but certainly rivals its daring predecessor in glamour."

342;jones) and Roxie Hart (Zellweger) are helped by a slick lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) and insatiable press to become celebrities of their own.
343;Rather, it offers a real show, based on the roaring 1920's with all its sex and prohibition.
344;Chicago's final effect on viewer is enhanced by great acting, singing and dancing performances from the leading three actors (Zeta.
345;jones won Oscar for her supporting role), sophisticated choreography and perfect editing, often making for an all.
346;Chicago is a sleek, sexy film featuring a powerhouse cast doing their own singing and dancing.
347;which is surprisingly good and makes this movie just that much more impressive.
348;Director Rob Marshall choreographed the numerous dance numbers, which are energetic, sexy, and entertaining.
349;Chicago is, after all a satire and Zellweger, Zeta.
350;jones, and Gere are all great as slimeballs who are completely oblivious to just how slimy they are.
351;that being said,the disc could've had better extras but it's still worth five stars.
352;But I love great work, and this is a great movie.
353;Rob Marshall has taken the Bob Fosse musical to the screen with such imaginative direction, editing and choreography that he has made it his own.
354;Fast on its feet and clever as hell, it benefits from great original material that is funny, sexy and smart.
355;the surprising cast of Zeta.
356;jones, Zellweger, Latifah, Gere and Reilly are uniformly terrific.
357;Who knew John C. Reilly has a beautiful Irish tenor?
358;They all learned their chops and performed them admirably.
359;"i applaud Rob Marshall not only for the clever and imaginative construct of constantly cutting back and forth from ""real"" sets to stage, and the rapid razzle dazzle of the editing and direction throughout, but also for bringing the picture in at 107 minutes."
360;Chicago gets right to it and never lets up.
361;Just great work throughout and it is a real MOVIE, not a filmed play.
362;"I feel like they have had a lot of training and are signing their best, but they do not compare to the talents of ""Real Musical Theater Singers""."
363;With the exception of the song Mr. Cellophane which is superior!
364;it is a great movie, not like the Academy Awards in 2002.
365;recommended to all lovers of musical theater
366;I saw this movie and absolutely loved it.
367;All the actors are fantastic for their roles and impressed me with their abilities to sing and dance as well as they do.
368;It is the best musical I have ever seen.
369;Yes, Richard Gere taps and it's wonderful.
370;it got sex and humor.
371;It's brining back the musical!
372;Chicago has a future with my VCR.
373;Now, I love both Chicago and Moulin Rouge to bits.
374;They are both masterpieces in their own rights!
375;Voicing their opinions and saying Moulin Rouge is better.
376;But that is part of its charm!
377;You can watch this movie over and over again and still love every second of it!
378;The music is sensational and the dance #'s are really great!
379;The prison Warden Mrs Morton (Queen Latifah) offers Roxie the opportunity of representation by slick Chicago lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere).
380;the storyline in this movie was ok but the singing and dancing was amazing!
381;Catherine Zeta Jones' opening number was the best I've seen.
382;Overall, the movie was very entertaining.
383;then everything came together and the movie became more and more enjoyable.
384;As fas as the actors, I am not a fan of Renee (even had a problem seeing her in the role she played at first), but her role in the movie was a good one, and matched the roles she played in previous movies, along with Richard Gere playing the slick lawyer looking for which prison women's plight can pay the most.
385;Her performance from beginning to end was magnificent.
386;"also, I look at Moulin Rouge and Chicago as ""great performances."""
387;Some, that I have read, has bombed Chicago and praised Moulin Rouge.
388;"The only other musical I will watch is, of course, the classic movie ""Grease"" but I must say that I actually loved ""Chicago""!"
389;type of movie watcher actually enjoyed the movie as well.
390;the songs are very well sung, the costumes and over all theme of the movie is spot.
391;I did not know that Renee Zellweger could sing and dance but I do now!Even the supporting cast was great!
392;Queen Latifah (always a phenomenal singer, no matter what!)
393;i loved this movie and even if you are not a musical kind a person .
394;This is one of the bet adaptations I have seen.
395;When I go to Broadway I want to see a play/musical and when I see a movie I want to see a movie.
396;Best Picture of the Year?
397;The music, the costumes, the dancing and singing, are all top rate.
398;jones) is a dancer who had an act with her sister until she found her sister and her lover in bed together and shot them both.
399;that's the outline of the story, and of course we have a courtroom scene.
400;But what is slightly disorienting is that people burst into song and dance all the time, everywhere.
401;Still, as I say, the dancing is red hot, as is the jazz, and the costumes are mostly very small and sparkly.
402;All in all, it's a lot of fun, and makes me think again about the fashion dolls Robert Tonner made from the main characters.
403;Great music, surprising musical talent.
404;Almost as good as the Broadway production.
405;Great entertainment to watch over and over again!
406;A great piece of musical theatre put to the big screen.
407;Richard Geere is a surprise in the movie, who knew he could sing and dance his way through a film with such great success.
408;the story of Roxie is a reflection of our culture and our obsession with celebrity.
409;The screen lights up with her beauty and excellent acting ability.
410;queen Latifah justly deserved the Academy Award nomination (I can't remember if she won or not)Lots of talent packed into this movie.
411;highly recomended for those who are musical theatre fans.
412;it gave me a rare feeling that I only get from seeing a really great movie.
413;Having seen the show on Broadway this past November, I was anticipating a really great movie.
414;"Of course, I didn't
415;Catherine Zeta Jones was excellent"
416;Oddly enough, Queen Latifah was really good.
417;"but now that I think about it, her being good isn't that odd
418;John C. Reily was also very good, as he was in all of his other roles in every really good movie this year.
419;Richard Gere's performance was good but not great.
420;the director did a great job, too"
421;The mood of the movie really helped in the enjoyment of it.
422;trust me, see this movie!!
423;I saw this in a local theater play and wanted to see the movie.
424;Although Chicago was esteemed by many critics and viewers, my own personal opinion is that it was good but not great.
425;The film is filled with outstanding musical and dance numbers.
426;The acting was better than i thought it would be, and i was very surprised to see the intricate detail that went into the making of this movie.
427;It gives the impression that our one true goal in life should be to become rich and famous and that we should do anything we have to to get it.
428;The movie was captivating from the very start.
429;The music, dancing and acting superb.
430;A great story with awesome songs!!!
431;It is truly the best film that I have seen in many, many years, and was a brilliant telling of a very classic story.
432;The blend of musical numbers with acted scenes was pulled off remarkably in this movie, and the film version allowed for plays that would not have been accomplished on the stage.
433;the vocal talents of actor Richard Gere and those of Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta.
434;But it is Queen Latifah who really took the stage away in her brilliant portrayal of Matron 'Mama' Morton.
435;We knew she had a brilliant voice, and we knew that she could act.
436;We knew that she was gorgeous, but how she pulled this movie off is truly, truly outstanding.
437;She brings it all together and it is her talent that glues the entire film together and makes it what it is.
438;She is stunning and unbelievable in this role, and is to be commended for the great work which she did.
439;Her fans will be thrilled with this movie, as will fans of the musical genre as a whole.
440;this one is a 'must see!'
441;God, this movie is fun.
442;When you watch it, the daring it took to make it and to make it so well .
443;with this cast, in this way and in 2002 .
444;paced, vibrant film filled with gusto performances from mostly everyone involved, though I'm not sure if Richard Gere's Jimmy Durante.
445;style singing quite works for the soundtrack.
446;(Still, Gere's take on the slimy lawyer, when he's not singing, is pretty great.)
447;By taking on the role of murderess Roxie Hart, Renee Zellweger proves, more than ever, that she's a damn good actress.
448;material stage show to its basics and adding the premise that all the musical numbers occur within Roxie's fame.
449;"hungry brain, director Rob Marshall and Bill Condon have created a spectacle that, hopefully, will resurrect, moreso than ""Dancer in the Dark"" and ""Moulin Rouge,"" the mainstream movie musical."
450;This is the best film of the year period.
451;Renne Zellwinger does her part extremely well as for the other actors give out top notch performances all in all see this film it is fun and has a beutiful plot of musical classics
452;it is possible that the play may have had some redeeming social value.
453;This broadway production made into a movie was fantastic.
454;Seeing Richard Gere tap dance was extraordinary.
455;I loved hearing everyone sing, and i sugest everyone to go and see it.
456;The pace is fast which makes the movie a joy to watch, since it holds the viewers attention.
457;screen musical is one I could have lived without.
458;Its winning the academy awards makes one wonder.
459;in my opinion, the best part of this strange combined crime story/musical was the bittersweet piece by Amos (John C. Reilly).
460;There were actually only three big numbers all of which expended a great deal of energy and talent.
461;the actor who played the judge was perfect for that part .
462;liked the portrait of the blindfolded Miss Justice behind the judge in courtroom.
463;It is already a classic.
464;The music, performances and color are wonderful.
465;I am pleased that I added this to my collection.
466;with a terrific looking head of gray hair!
467;Renee Zellweger is terrific as the out of step female she always plays, Catherine Zeta.
468;jones is a surprise as a singer and dancer, and Queen Latifah is Queen Latifah, but it's Richard Gere who makes this slow musical better than average.
469;my mom likes movies like this and grease,if you like musicals,its a very good movie
470;I went to see this movie and into it for the first 20 min or so then i kept seeing somthing at the top of the screen that had we wondering.
471;The skits and musical numbers are great and really clever.
472;Richard Gere and Ren e Zellweger are amazing in this film!
473;This movie has an interesting story and is directed very well by Rob Marshall.
474;I recommend checking it out.
475;I enjoyed this movie immensely.
476;The music is lively, the dancing is fantastic and all the principal actors are wonderful in their roles.
477;it is difficult to choose a favorite between the two female leads, because they're both so good, but it is Renee Zellweger's performance as murderess Roxie Hart that is the most realistic, though this may simply be because her character is the more fleshed.
478;"I was also surprised to realize what a beautiful voice she has, a fact that comes wonderfully to light in her performance of ""Funny Honey""."
479;Without giving too much away, it's an interesting point that it is the good people in Chicago that end up suffering.
480;This is necessitated in some respects, by the plot, yet it would have been refreshing to see at least one of the three learn something from the experience.
481;"Altogether, a very enjoyable film
482;This Blue Ray disk is stunning to watch.
483;If you haven't seen this Academy award winner (best picture 2002) it is a must.
484;a second viewing will reveal its importance in getting the audience to make the necessary connections between the characters and plot the course of the story.
485;the sets and costumes are second to none and overall the movie provides a evening of good fun.
486;Stays true to the play while beefing up the story line.
487;All the performances were excellent, especially the supporting cast.
488;Worth watching even if you aren't a fan of musicals.
489;Absolutely the best movie of the year!
490;out schlock that Andrew Lloyd Webber spews can be received so much success and dribble like Grease can become a classic.
491;If you want to experience that """"thing"""" get All That Jazz or Cabaret or a """"great"""" musical with count 'em, ten """"great"""" songs, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying."""
492;I am pleased to see the revival of the musical, but I have real problems with Chicago .
493;for any show to appeal to me, it has to resonate at some level.
494;i've read so many great reviews of Chicago .
495;i LOVED Cabaret, Loved the music from the play I heard over the years,Loved Fosse's work,but HATE THIS FILM.
496;Richard Gere singing and dancing?!
497;Bet I could count on my hands how many I own that I've bought.
498;But this one is a keeper.
499;Now musicals are more realistic and seek to tell a story with solid content.
500;I found the story gripping, emotionally captivating, and ironically amusing.
501;And, the music is superb.
502;Every song is melodic and memorable, and the lyrics are first rate.
503;Some person complained that the movie symphathizes with killers and those who set them free .
504;It will just hit a Wall of Obtuseness.
505;this is a good movie with good acting and god story I was able to watch it though for the first time
506;office around as soon as she stepped into the lead role.
507;Liza recorded great versions of All That Jazz and My Own Best Friend and was at one point rumored to be signed for the lead in the motion picture Chicago with Goldie Hawn as the co. lead!!
508;What we have here is a movie with no Superstar musical talents and it shows!!
509;For a major motion picture musical you simply need a major musical star (or two!)
510;to really make it a great classic!!
511;This Chicago is a lightly entertaining movie that could have been a all.
512;Richard Gere deserves credit for taking on a musical role: his acting is superb and gives it everything he's got.
513;jones is perfect as a malevolent murderess: she looks it, acts it, and sings it.
514;John C. Reilly, one of the most versatile actors around, does a predictably fantastic job as Zellweger's witless, gullible husband.
515;Renee Zelleweger did a great job as well as Catherine.
516;The songs performed and dances are catchy.
517;There's like so many songs performed it's great.
518;i thought i'd be great but it was better than i expected, bravo to cast you blew me out of water thank you for making a fun romp of a show 10 stars to ya .
519;oh by the way for you richard gere fans out there richard does sing in this picture , it's musical but no embarrassing moments like many other pictures i've seen, just plain fun and great music .
520;dang renee and zeta you guys work good together hope to see in alot more pictures as duo.
521;This was one of the best movies to come out last year, and it was a stunning film adaptation of a great musical.
522;provoking form of musical theatre with deep themes about unsavory subjects .
523;it stays true to the themes and style of the show.
524;the biggest change is the real world setting which places most all of the musical numbers inside the characters imaginations.
525;The style of the entire film comes from the 70s, and is very reminiscent of Bob Fosse's highly praised adaptation of CABARET into a successful film.
526;It's a piece of art .
527;This is sexy and streamlined!The cast is top.
528;suited for this kind of production!
529;Renee Zellweger is right out of the period, and sings very well!
530;top extravaganza like Moulin Rouge, this is definitely a spectacle.
531;jones and Lucy Liu (honest!)
532;In a book musical, the songs advance the story.
533;Another peeve of mine was the tap dance number by Gere, performed in counterpoint to his questioning of a witness.
534;edged musical fantasy not only won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2002, it is also arguably the best piece of filmaking to come out of a Hollywood studio this decade.
535;Only because most Hollywood films have become so dumbed down and mediocre in recent years does Chicago seem like a bracing breath of fresh air.
536;the movie's highlights includes tremendous performances from ts three stars (who would have thought Rene Zellweger and Richard Gere could sing and dance so well?)
537;The songs are memorable, as is the witty between song dialog.
538;"musical of all time, great songs, great cast besides Renne Zellweger but I guess she kinda fits the part playing a no talent dumb blonde
539;I'm a 14 year old male and i listen to rock music and watch tv shows likes the simpsons and watch funny movies.
540;The songs were pretty catchy and some were funny.
541;Love love love this movie!
542;Winner of six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Chicago is a brilliant big screen adaptation of choreographer.

544;meanwhile, sexy songstress and half of a famous Chicago nightclub sister act, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta.
545;But at least one person in the prison is willing to help Roxie.
546;For fifty bucks, she places a phone call to the greatest defense lawyer in modern.
547;day times, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere).
548;manipulating the media to the best of his ability, Billy turns Roxie into an overnight celebrity .
549;the hottest sensation to sweep Chicago since, well .
550;since the next one that will come along.
551;chicago is a refreshing escape the drudgery of modern day box office blockbusters with its insightful peering into the mob mentality of the public psyche and its colorful characters.
552;Queen Latifah steals the show with her portrayal of Mama Morton in a film packed with knockout performances by Hollywood mainstays.
553;All of the stars sing their own numbers, and the soundtrack is simply spectacular.
554;Aside from winning several Tony's during it's original run on Broadway with stage legends, Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera, it was and still is an immense success on Broadway right showing off the talents of some more stage greats .
555;The movie version upholds to its Broadway prdecessors.
556;it's an amazing story of two infamous women (Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart, Zeta.
557;jones and Zellweger, respectively) fighting for media publicity and lawayer played wonderfully by Richard Gere (who does his own tap dancing and singing).
558;With musical numbers written brilliantly by John Kander and Frank Ebb that will have your feet tapping in tempo and lyrics that stay in your head, who wouldn't love this musical?!
559;The Cell Block Tango in itself is totally worth it, as is John C Reily's absolutely amazing Mr. Cellophane For all those people out there who getting the wrong advice about Moulin Rouge being sooooo much better than Chicago, please do not listen.
560;I am a huge musical fan, having performed in several musicals and attending 5 times more at local, regional and broadway theatre, I can safely say that Chicago is far superior to anything that Baz Lurhman may give you.
561;Ewan McGregor was absoultey phenomenal.
562;where is the fun in that?!)
563;So please, forget all the awful rumors and stupid advice about Moulin Rouge being the superior musical b/c they all obvisouly do not know what they are talking about!
564;So get it and you'll see what all that jazz is really about!!!
565;The story presented in this musical is pretty good and it is packed with an all.
566;With a combination of talent like that, a film has a good chance for success.
567;And Chicago certainly does succeed on most levels with many excellent song and dance scenes and strong directing from Rob Marshall.
568;what makes a musical memorable is, of course, the music itself"
569;The way the songs are inserted into the movie, however, is very good and Rob Marshall deserves credit for timing the presentation of these tunes but even more impressive than the timing is the performances themselves.
570;The dance scenes are hot, with Catherine Zeta.
571;as far as the story goes, it isn't the greatest I have ever seen in a movie (musical or otherwise) but it is still pretty good.
572;all of the performances in this movie are noteworthy and it is important to point out that Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta.
573;Jones, Renee Zellweger, and the others perform the song and dance routines themselves.
574;Each of them is very good in their roles, especially Zellweger as the main character and John Reilly as her plain.
575;overall, Chicago is a good musical with some hot dance scenes, good songs, and star performances all around.
576;The movie ultimately looks slightly better then it sounds because not all of the songs are very memorable.
577;But it is still a very good Hollywood musical and the first of its genre to win the Best Picture award in a more than thirty years.
578;Shall I go on, great cast, top notch music, very funny and by the way, a strong plot.
579;Makes for one of the best movies ever made.
580;Thumbs way up and recommended for the whole family.
581;Bought this for my teenage daughter as it is her favorite musical.
582;I so love this movie.
583;All performances are extraordinary, and a true delight to watch.
584;"Chicago is one of two exceptions (the other being the terrific ""West Side Story"")."
585;Chicago has been perfectly adapted to the cinematic style and moves with an exciting pace.
586;Everyone is perfectly cast and enters the spirit of the piece with a great sense of fun and professionalism.
587;If the genre bores you, as it does me, please give this film a chance.
588;Chicago is my favorite movie!
589;A few years ago my son treated me to the Broadway play Chicago and I got hooked on it!
590;I watch it at least twice a month.
591;This is a great musical starring Richard Gere along with Catherine Zeta Jones.
592;This movie has everything you want in a musical.
593;Great singing , great dancing and great performances.
594;Get this and enjoy it with a friend.
595;The performers all acquit themselves well enough but .
596;The song 'Class' is also gone from the film proper (it is, however, included in the special features).
597;Also, the 'vaudeville act' aspect of the original Broadway show is somewhat muddied but handled fairly well as the film slides from reality to performing.
598;I look forward to watching the movie again, this time with Director Rob Marshall's commentary track.
599;My favorite movie used to be Moulin Rouge and I do still enjoy it, but I'd have to say Chicago is a better movie.
600;I loved the songs and love the Soundtrack.
601;Many, many other people loved this movie so don't pass it up just because, like, two people didn't enjoy it.
602;Catherine Zeta Jones does an impressive job as Velma.
603;Her strong personality suits the character to a T and her voice is made for the stage.
604;The particular scene in which Roxie (Zellweger) shoots Fred is so well acted that I wanted to shoot him too.
605;Zellweger delivers a stellar performance as dreamer Roxie.
606;She gives her best performance though when she is singing Nowadays .
607;overall a wonderful show with a great cast!
608;Excellent, a must see for everyone!!
609;Fun movie to share with others who have seen it or not.
610;would highly recommend to anyone wanted to be entertained.
611;If you want to see good musicals watch Moulin Rouge and Dancer in the Dark
612;Chicago is a musical from which other musicals should be molded!
613;Not since the Streisand and Andrews genre of musicals have I been so entertained.
614;The story of women wronged and taking revenge on countless men, at a time when women had barely gained the right to vote is easy to swallow under the careful spell cast by this powerful A. list ensemble of actors.
615;the music, costumes and choreography nearly overshadow the exceptional acting.
616;But they also leave you wanting more, more, more!
617;Just have to say, you will love this movie!
618;It is a must for your library!
619;"He is also best known for his ""Cabaret."""
620;This film has his look and his stamp all over it even though it was done by other filmmakers using his source material.
621;This film also benefits from some exceptional talent.
622;Ren e Zellweger is a wonderful actress with a very wide range.
623;She now adds singing and dancing to her repertoire and does a bang.
624;He does a marvelous tap.
625;jones does a grand singing and dancing job.
626;I don't think she has quite Zellweger's range of ability but she is very good.
627;"It is ""Cellophane"" and he is transformed while singing it."
628;Queen Latifah also does a great number plus plays the woman prison warden.
629;All of the songs, all of the actors, every part of the scenery and costumes are wonderful.
630;They have picked the best singers and dancers to depict this movie perfectly
631;Chicago is a good movie.
632;jones, but I will admit she is okay in this movie.
633;In the end there will be a star, who will it be?
634;It is a great remake of a musical and I enjoyed the music.
635;I think the music shinned right along with the movie!
636;jones is a very talented and stunningly beautiful woman, and she was the highlight of the film.
637;Add to that the freakish surrealism of the filming style and you have a long and unpleasent viewing experience.
638;Seen it many times, and enjoy each time immensely.
639;The ladies do a wonderful job, and a sleazy Richard Greer is right on point.
640;Queen Latifah is a joy to watch.
641;It's a poignant tale applicable to today .
642;Roxie watches as the press flock to Velma, thanks to the talents of hot.
643;shot lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), and when she eventually gets Flynn to take on her case as well she suddenly finds herself a headliner .
644;jones has the opening number which sets the stage for the musical, and she does a terrific job.
645;In fact, most of the vocal and dance performances of the cast are excellent.
646;Gere turns in a solid performance as Billy Flynn, and supporting players Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly steal the spotlight with exceptionally strong numbers.
647;director Rob Marshall, known previously for directing the television adaptions of the musicals ANNIE and CINDERELLA, helps the audience accept the fact that the characters spontaneously break into song and dance .
648;by making these sequences spring from Roxie's imagination.
649;But in its own light, CHICAGO is a very entertaining film that proves that the musical genre is far from dead.
650;The movie, which is amazing from a musical, entertainment, and technical viewpoint, is mistreated by a lackluster collection of Special Features and a below.
651;"The special concludes with a music video for ""All That Jazz""."
652;This very easily could have been a two.
653;The dancing and singing was well done, but the actors weren't able to make the jump between reality and fantasy convincing.
654;It was interesting to note that the vast majority of the audience at the screening I attended was at least middle.
655;a beautifully styled production, with razor.
656;sharp editing and rewardingly good performances across the board, the film owes a great deal to Dennis Potter whose groundbreaking Pennies From Heaven and The Singing Detective used startling and unexpected musical numbers to embellish his often somber plots.
657;The treat in this film is its energy and the discovery that John C. Reilly has a wonderful tenor voice to accompany his always reliable acting talent.
658;Richard Gere is delightful as the venal lawyer and Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart is coltishly appealing.
659;jones finally shows us, once and for all, what she can do.
660;And it's a whole lot: she sings and dances up a storm in a part she makes entirely her own.
661;The bonus is Queen Latifah who is just plain great.
662;good evening, with lots of laughs and a soundtrack that had all those middle.
663;It's time very well spent.
664;Definitely a good choice for movie night!
665;The best parts are the songs.
666;At least I know it is something she'll like!
667;"The entire musical, while fun with great music and dancing, has its tongue planted firmly in its cheek and is really about America's fascination with the rich, glam and famous and also the fickle power of clebrity and the ""here today, gone tomorrow"" phonemoea of Hollywood and the American media."
668;But it sure is a fun fable!
669;And while all of the actors are wonderful, Catherine Zeta.
670;jones and Richard Gere dance away with the movie!
671;The music was not the best but the story was good.
672;It seems to reflect a lot about our society of present time.
673;performed film, and individual numbers are nicely sung, danced, and choreographed.
674;Director Rob Marshall creates a good film, but he also contradicts the traditional musical form by presenting the numbers.
675;contained soliloquies which are figments of a lead character's imagination.
676;day audience to pay attention to a movie where characters sing or dance in a book's real.
677;(The above summary makes the same observation, citing the excessive cuts which innterrupt the dance sequences.)
678;In the end, I congratulate the film for all its accolades and nominations, but it's a highly stylized music video more than a musical.
679;The movie Chicago has it all.
680;The movie has many sleek and cool musical numbers, that have just the right amount of 'punch' that it never gets boring.
681;When the music came on right in the beginning (5,6,7,8) I knew that I was in for a good long ride.
682;jones, Renee Zellwegger, Queen Latifah and Richard Gere are perfect!
683;Her opening act of 'All That Jazz' was flawless, and really got you in the movie.
684;Her vocal tone is very strong and her dancing was right on the money!
685;She got those notes right up the there, with that moment being her's all the way.
686;dancing interlude is a knockout with him doing all the tapping himself.
687;the Cinematography and Art Direction of this film is completely right out there.
688;The difference between Moulin Rouge and Chicago is that Moulin Rouge has a bigger scale that covered a lot of the Big Paris Landscape of 1899.
689;I liked it :)Anyway, the movie is AMAZING!
690;He took his dream of making Chicago a film, and he did it, giving him enormous amounts of awards and critical acclaim.
691;Very surprising to know that this was his first film, and with that amount of success, we know we'll see a lot more of him in the near future.
692;I love the script with many quick back to back dialogue that is fast and right up to the point.
693;So check this movie out and you'll see what Chicago has up it's sleeve.
694;Why this movie got such great reviews is a mystery to me.
695;and not nearly as creative as Moulin Rouge was a year or so earlier.
696;Chicago the film has been in years of planning and it was worth the wait , The whole cast were made for there roles all perfect every thing of the stage show is so perfectly adapted and it is really one of the best musical movies I have ever seen.
697;In one word : Amazing
698;This movie is simply wonderful , Fosse would be so proud to see his wonderful musical turned into such a great film , Kudos go to the cast for making it happen.
699;This is a must see.
700;The actors do a great job putting it into the cinema.
701;I totally adore this movie from its fantastic fantasy musical world to its thrilling take on the american justice system a true movie musical masterpeice whoever says it is bad does not know fine film.
702;It took me a while to get the jist of the whole thing, but once I got into the swing of the film, I enjoyed it.
703;I thought that the songs were great for the most part, and I was impressed with the talent that each actor/actress showed in this film.
704;If you are into musicals, then this is the film for you.
705;A story of dreams of stardom and the dark path those dreams sometimes take.
706;With an amazing cast, and unforgettable music, this is a must see.
707;Chicago isn't just a musical now it's a movie masterpeice , the cast are superb.
708;renee is just adorable is Roxie and her voice is suited to the role, Richard is fantastic as Billy with his crooning voice and tap dancing he should of got an oscar nomination!
709;She was made to be Velma this is her role no if's and's or but's an amazing performance and a very well deserved oscar for her.
710;all in all if you like musicals or even if you don't I think you will love it as much as I did.
711;With it's great performances and amazing music you can't go wrong.
712;jones' kickass Velma Kelly, to Queen Latifa's mercenary Matron Morton, the motion picture version of the Broadway musical classic is practically perfect in every way.
713;This is an amazingly entertaining, if cynical, piece, with one of Kander and Ebb's best musical scores.
714;created Bob Fosse's landmark choreography.
715;The result is very good, indeed.
716;But Fosse's work was far superior.
717;star film, and great motion picture entertainment.
718;"The Monroe influence on Zelwegger is strong throughout ""Chicag,"" most especially as she belts ""Roxie""."
719;"start to finish, ""Chicago"" is nonstop movie musical magic."
720;I must admit, I was skeptical about seeing this movie, having seen the play on Broadway and really loved it.
721;Not only is this a faithful adaptation of the story, it's a faithful adaptation of the music, the dance and the characters all the way through.
722;The performances are brilliant and the essence of the beloved play is maintained amazingly well.
723;Thanks to those who do this.
724;the 1.85:1 video presentation was actually pretty good.
725;There were some dark scenes that had grain, but the majority of the movie looked very good.
726;This is the most amazing movie I have ever seen.
727;Each and every one of them did tremendous jobs with the singing, dancing, and acting.
728;I was especially impressed with Richard Gere's performance as opportunistic lawyer Billy Flynn.
729;I also am not usually a fan of Richard Gere, but he is an incredible singer and actor. . . .
730;there was also a terrific tap dance number that made me fall in love with him!
731;I was also surprised at the talent that was demonstrated by Catherine Zeta.
732;The direction in this movie was also the best I have ever seen, especially for a musical. . . this director definately deserves an Oscar for this one!
733;As an obsessed fan, I also own the soundtrack and would definately call it the best soundtrack I have ever heard!
734;'Chicago' is the movie of a musical style in jazz, so it attracted me for that reason at first time.
735;Finally, they win reputation on their own stage.
736;the movie contains many of splendor scenes.
737;Because the musical 'Chicago' is adapted for the screen successfully, it makes me very exciting and dynamic.
738;The excellent background music and the jazz tune flows on the screen attractively.
739;although the music and scene look beautiful, the conclusion of this movie teaches us something immoral.
740;i recommend this movie to the person who loves the music, especially jazz, because of the excellent music and performance in this movie like seeing an excellent musical.
741;This is a continuation of a fairy tale.
742;It shows history of the Roaring '20's at their most exciting moment.
743;This musical shows more than excitment, it shows reality, but adding music to it makes the audience have more of a comical impression of a serious situation.
744;This musical truly speaks for itself, and it helps us realize how much our decision affect us, and helps us learn how many people are affect as well.
745;Beautiful musical, full of fun and comical suspence!
746;This will go down as one of the classic musicals.
747;Obviously my girlfriend loves it but I can certaily appreciate the art that went into making the film.
748;Bought it for my teenager who really loves it!
749;Which needless to say, surprised me!
750;Great story line and the dancing and music was GREAT!!!
751;pan stardom of the real Chicago in the 1920's.
752;Only the opening number, All That Jazz , and the final number, Nowadays , take place in the real world .
753;all the glitz and glamour in between is in Roxie's deluded head.
754;And, in many ways, this Chicago is very realistic.
755;One reviewer gave one star for precisely the reasons I listed above.
756;To name but a few reasons, this is an entertaining movie with fantastic singing (Bob Fosse was a genius), stellar choreography and directing, and some of the best acting of the last year .
757;But besides all that, a friend of mine put it best when she said: it's like a train wreck .
758;It is a great musical, and even those who for one reason or another may steer clear of this genre should give it a chance .
759;great dancers and singers should be.
760;The music, the actors, the dancing and the story .
761;"I invited friends to a ""Chicago"" night (a dinner and a movie) and they loved it as much as I do."
762;he brings bob fosse's creation to life, with the somewhat artistic numbers to the emotional rollercoaster that we experince as we get sucked into the plot.
763;If you enjoy the living entity that is musical theatre, then i highly recommend that you see Chicago.
764;We just finished seeing the show in NYC so it was fresh in our minds.
765;We think this was an excellent movie depiction and loved how they incorporated the actual show.
766;An amazing, breathtaking, and a thousand more adjectives for this musical.
767;A truly audio and visual experience.
768;jones' and Ren e Zellweger's charm and beauty.
769;Director's Rob Marshall's impecable style caughts you from beginnig to end.
770;Great movie, great acting and amazing singing by the whole cast.
771;I never saw the musical, but the plot sets the audience for a complex morality tale.
772;jones such enthusiastic performers, that one is left with a moral vacuum.
773;jawed, and so is the audience.
774;It was beautifully filmed, well acted by Daniel and others certainly, but the movie had a huge cloud of depression running throughout.
775;my BF who isn't a big musical fan loved this film and we both just had the time of our lives.
776;Even more so since we saw Gangs on the same day!Renee is amazing, she isn't a broadway star but she CAN sing and she was lovely and very convincing as Roxie, who ISN'T supposed to be as talented as Thelma.
777;catherine Z. j was simply amazing as was Queen Latifah.
778;He obviously worked very hard and was so amusing as Billy Flynn, even if the others hadn't been as strong as they were I think I would have enjoyed this film.
779;as for the Moulin Rouge comments, OK the movie was awesome, it also deserved the Oscar but it didn't get it and that has NOTHING to do with why Chicago did!
780;and I say BRAVO to Chicago, you deserved it!
781;I'd seen the play in New York (with Bebe Neuwirth as Velma) and just loved it.
782;When I go to movies/theater, I want to be entertained.
783;jones is terrific as Velma, and Renee Zellweger is far better than I'd ever expected as Roxie.
784;I normally hate it when songs just appear out of nowhere, but Marshall is very clever in the way he manages to insert the songs into the movie, and he deserves all the praise he got.
785;I forgot how fun this movie was and how talented these stars are.
786;It is a fun watch on a rainy day.
787;(Also my most listened to soundtrack!)
788;Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere are good as well!!
789;fast shipping and received as described.
790;For those of you who haven't seen this is a great musical.
791;It's flawlessly directed and executed, brilliantly acted and otherwise advertised and comes off as the whole package, flawless from just about every angle.
792;i for one felt that the entire cast (Gere aside) did an outstanding job, and yes, even Gere did fine, I just felt his Billy Flynn was a bit miscast.
793;She's imprisoned for it and its there that she meets Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta.
794;great year for him by the way) who seems to be being used by everyone.
795;The real shining areas here are of course wrapped up in the musical numbers, the shimmer and grace that lines every word, every scene, and every number.
796;Numbers like `Cell Block Tango' and `All I Care About' get the star treatment (and look wonderful) while songs like `Mister Cellophane' and `When You're Good to Mamma' shine brighter than the rest based on the voices alone.
797;`Chicago' arguably deserved the Oscar (I'm still on the fence) but regardless it deserved to win or not, `Chicago' is still a brilliant musical that any fan of the Broadway play or fan of the musical in general will enjoy.
798;Rob Marshall did deserve that Best Director Oscar, I will say that.
799;top piece of cinema that is so much fun to watch!Very well cast and directed.
800;The sets, lighting, camera work, and editing are all top notch and keep the story moving at a breakneck pace, in a very entertaining fashion.
801;what a great way to bring the musical back to the forefront!
802;Wonderful casting, detailed costumes, riveting music, luscious sets and academy award winning acting.
803;The performances in this film are excellent.
804;Each person performs their own musical numbers and it is incredible to watch.
805;Very sexy indeed!The special features include an audio commentary track which is very interesting and feature length.
806;The features here are worth your money, even if another edition should hit the shelves.113 minutes of pure brilliance.
807;The plot and musical parts are intertwined so well.
808;& some of the best music you could imagine.
809;Moulin Rouge basically reinvented the concept of a movie musical, period.
810;And now, Chicago has revived the brassy, Broadway musical on the silver screen.
811;The movie is fun and captures the feel of a Fosse musical.
812;I do believe that Bob Fosse himself would have enjoyed this production.
813;including Queen Latifah shows the daring and the risks the producers took, but it also shows how interested they were in bringing this book to the broadest audience possible.Yes, I would have loved to have seen Bebe Newirth up there on the screen, but every member of the cast holds their own, including Richard Gere (which I seriously didn't expect).
814;For now, this package is enough.
815;so here's to more musicals!
816;Hopefully they will be as good as this one.
817;I've never seen the stage version of Chicago, so I can't say if the movie was faithful to the source material, but judged on it's own by a pair of fresh eyes, Chicago was a lot of fun, especially considering I'm generally not crazy about movie musicals.
818;All three leads acquit themselves nicely in the song and dance department, especially Zeta.
819;Although the movie dragged in spots, I still highly recommend it, even if you don't generally flock to musicals.
820;Chicago is a terrific adaptation of the Broadway musical that boasts a spectacular cast and dazzling musical numbers.
821;The entire cast is on point here.
822;I'm typically not a fan of Renee Zellweger but I found myself thoroughly enjoying her performance in the film.
823;jones, Gere, and surprisingly Reilly are equally enjoyable and have musical chops of which I had no idea existed.
824;If you're a fan of musicals or films set in the 20s, you'll more than likely enjoy this movie.
825;I found this movie quite delightful!!!!!
826;The music and dancing superb and Richard Gere!!!!!
827;On the other hand, everyone else was good.
828;Her songs are sung very well and it makes me glad that she sings the majority compared to her costar.
829;The songs are good, I like Jones, Gere, Reilly (who's actually a good actor/singer when he's not making a crappy comedy with Will Ferrell) and Latifah (she's a favorite but it seems a little unfair to compare her to the others as she was already a singer before she got the role).
830;The dancing, singing, and performances are all ACES!
831;Better than any past producton of Chicago.
832;"With the success of ""Moulin Rouge"", and now ""Chicago"", the public seems to be hungry for a genre in Hollywood that has been absent for far too long."
833;In recent years, it seems only animated films with musical numbers such as those from Disney, for example, succeeded.
834;Stylish, well acted and well sung, this movie succeeds in all areas.
835;The Golden Globes awarded Zellweger and Gere, the actress and actor trophies in comedy/musical and gave the film the nod for best comedy/musical.
836;The story moves along smoothy and the musical numbers melt into the plot perfectly.
837;The choreography is flawless and the actors can actually belt out a tune!!
838;Hopefully, Hollywood and the public will take notice and make this movie the blockbuster it deserves to be.
839;But it is so much more than that.
840;Nicole Kidman is a good singer but lets face it Catherine Zeta Jones can really belt it out.
841;Her voice was actually perfect for the role.
842;The music is great too!
843;Velma rising from the floor at the beginning of All That Jazz, Roxie on the piano in Funny Honey, the cell bars in Cell Block Tango, the stipping of Billy in All I Care About, Roxie's name in lights in ROXIE, Mama Morton's fan in When Your Good to Mama, etc.
844;Sorry folks, but Chicago is the real winner and the real musical here.
845;"Usually, I never watch musicals, but ""Chicago"" is amazing!"
846;The music, especially, is great.
847;It's been a long time since a musical this wonderful has been released.
848;I loved how they switch periodically from their life(speaking mostly) to their fantasy(singing on stage).
849;The costumes and stage setting was amazing to look at.
850;Chicago was well deserving for its six Oscar wins, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress(Catherine Zeta.
851;This will be a classic years from now!
852;What a spectacle, the numbers and routines take your breath away.
853;The approach is clever in that the routines are seen through Roxie's dreams, much more acceptable than the old style musical where everyone on the bus starts singing together on cue despite being total strangers.
854;Despite the lack of Yellow Brick Road goodness this is a well written, extremely funny movie that is well worth watching.
855;jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere are superb.
856;Zeta Jones in particular is nothing short of stunning in the All that Jazz number .
857;jones) compete for headlines and the attention of their slick lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), in Chicago during the roaring 20's.
858;Queen Latifah delivers a star.
859;And Catherine Zeta Jones is simply breath.
860;May be the greatest Movie of all time
861;This is probably the most entertaining movie I have seen in a long time.
862;It is fun, funny, and absolutely original.
863;story is very unique, much to my surprise.
864;Screenplay is brilliant, score and dance numbers are excellent, costumes and movie setting and everything that goes with it are perfect.
865;Did I mention incredibly unique story?
866;And the cast of this movie.
867;Just the fact that all of them received the Golden Globe nominations would speak for itself.
868;this is Richard Gere's finest 2 hours in my opinion.
869;And that is a pretty big statement considering his tremendous career, which I happened to be a great fan of.
870;He is amazing to watch (along with everyone else).
871;I always thought she was good, but had no idea she was that good.
872;this is going down as one of the best and most original films of all time, at least on my list.
873;ups about musicals and hand over every possible Oscar to this movie, because everyone involved in creating such a perfect movie deserves it.
874;The music and lyrics are outstanding and quite unique!
875;While in the slammer, she hears about and eventually gets a lawyer (Richard Gere)to help her get out.
876;The characters are all interesting, especially Queen Latifah, who makes the most of a small role.
877;Gere and Zellweger are their usual passable selves, and Catherine Zeta.
878;Since the performances are good, not great and the story is average at best, this film would appeal to only real musical fans, or fans of the performers.
879;let's be honest, after years of seeing Richard Gere in fairly nondescript movies I now had to accept he was a singer and a dancer too?
880;And whilst not a passionate fan of musicals, I can say that I have certainly have enjoyed some of the old classics over the years.
881;all I can say is that when the movie had finished I felt like applauding, it was over too soon, it was very very good.
882;great movie great plot great actors and of course great entertainment i enjoyed watching it almost as good as the original
883;The movie is a great alternative to a live stage production.
884;singing and dancing surprisingly good.
885;"The 2002 Oscar winner for Best Picture,""Chicago"" is a musical which has the late Bob Fosse's choreography stamped all over it, although it's really anybody's guess as to whether or not he would have been pleased with this film version of his 1975 stage hit."
886;Happily, the acting was great and the leads did their own singing and dancing.
887;the story is based on the real.
888;"She performs the rousing number, ""All That Jazz"" shortly thereafter as if nothing has happened."
889;we are then introduced to Matron Mama Morton(a pretty, regal, and matronly Queen Latifah), and the vaudville numbers continue as she sings the racy and more.
890;jones' serves him well here) arrives to represent Roxie, who also has push.
891;entertainment scenario continues, we are treated to the long.
892;"suffering but loyal Amos' ""Mr. Cellophane"", and his devotion to his unfaithful and ungrateful wife is heart."
893;Noteworthy is the strong anti.
894;belva Gaertner lived to see her story told onstage the year before.
895;manipulating Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly live to dazzle the world again, and our rollicking tale of cynical truth ends on a positive note for our main players.
896;"all one could do in the end is heave a sigh, enjoy the show, and ""All That Jazz""!"
897;Got reviews and I agree with the reviews.
898;so glad 2 see musicals moving into a 21 century format .
899;I love the way the actors have portrayed the roles, especially Queen Latifah as Mama.
900;She will, forever, personify that role, for me.
901;My favorite musical number is He Had it Comin'!
902;I know that's not the real name, but that's what i always call it, and I'm sure anyone whose ever seen it knows what I'm talking about from me saying that.
903;Great remake of the Roxie Hart movie, originally staring Adolph Menjou and Ginger Rogers, though that one didn't have the musical numbers.
904;This film version of the stage classic is excellently done, with great dance numbers and a soundtrack that could make anyone fantasize about the free.
905;Catherine Zeta Jones as Velma Kelly was a perfect choice, with her powerful singing voice and extraordinary dance talents.
906;"As for Richard Gere, he was a terrific choice for Billy Flynn
907;Chicago has to be one of the best musicals of all time, great cast, great music and stunningly produced numbers.
908;jones has a GREAT voice, and Rene Zelweger was great as Roxie Hart, it was like she was made for that roll.
909;I was impressed with Richard Gere's tap dancing.
910;No wonder it won an Oscar for best picture.
911;I loved the songs, choreography and the costumes.
912;All I can say is, """"WOW!"""""""
913;I cleaned the disc thinking this may clear it up, without success.
914;I ran the properties on the computer to see if it was alright and was surprised to discover that Amazon.
915;Great performances by people you don't expect to be in a musical.
916;This is a musical in the tradition of musicals that are entertaining and easy to digest, and yet some hours later leave one with some apprehension.
917;There is a kind of historically revisionist feeling to the sentiments expressed.
918;What makes Bob Fosse's Chicago a hit (and the Academy's Best Picture of 2002) are the beautifully staged and choreographed song and dance numbers, the spiffy direction and neat editing, a lot of leggy flesh along with some fine performances by Queen Latifah, Catherine Zeta.
919;in particular I liked Queen Latifah's performance.
920;I also liked her portrayal of the savvy and corrupt Boss Lady on Murderess Row.
921;jones got the Oscar for best Supporting Actress, and she was good, but I think Latifah, who was also nominated, was just as impressive if not more so.
922;gives a solid performance in a very demanding role, although to be honest, it appeared that she was doing a lot of lipsyncing.
923;Still one is amazed at how good she and Zeta.
924;This film deserved all the awards it received and Zeta Jones certainly with her dancing and actingA pity that Gere wasn't nominated since he's pitch perfect as Billy Flynn though he did receive a Golden Globe for his performance.
925;Queen Latifah and Zellweiger are also excellent and this Diamond edition is heads and tails superior to the original Blu ray in video and sound.
926;This is fitting since the former is about the life of the brilliant director.
927;All three sing and dance their way through the film in visually stunning choreographed numbers that had the audience clapping after each.
928;cHICAGO is loud, colorful, in.your.
929;I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
930;I beg you to see this film!
931;Granted the dancing in this movie was keeping my attention,(thats it !)
932;I've seen better in amateur theatre productions.
933;Zeeleger at least can hit a high note.
934;This movie, actually a musical, is a stunning array of music, amazing dancing acts, great storylines, and a whole sense of fun woven into the dark and dramatic theme of this movie.
935;a. case lawyer named William Flynn played by Richard Gere to win her freedom and also her road to stardom and to flee from her estranged husband Amos.
936;the songs that accompany the individual events are so much fun to listen to, combined with the dancing performances by the individual characters.
937;Personally, I love the Big Band and ragtime music that accompanies the movie scenes and the performers and stage performances are amazing.
938;Except for Flynn who is their lawyer, they are all charged with the murders of their `loved' ones who have been unfaithful to them and their desire for revenge drove them to madness.
939;All of the songs that accompany each of the scenarios are innovative and absolute brilliance.
940;The entire cast surpassed all of my expectations in this musical and gave them a whole new image of skill, intelligence, and depth to their characters.
941;I love also seeing the movie flip between the dramatic scenes of Roxie in prison and then the stage performances.
942;"queen Latifah steals part of the spotlight as the elegant Matron ""Mama"" Morton."
943;Her ruthless `drill sergeant' attitude is classic and sometimes even funny although its humor factor is basically from the big band music that plays along during the scenes.
944;There's a funny yet good message in her song too.
945;The other half of the spotlight is stolen by Catherine Zeta Jones.
946;Her manipulative personality brings a large amount of conflict to the musical, not to mention a sense of mystery.
947;I've heard a lot about that Catherine was a dancer for many years and Between Jones and Zellweger, it's obvious for many years and had all the skills needed whereas Zellweger definitely showed a bit of newbie performances but still both are great.
948;Velma is an incredible character too and Zeta Jones is a wonderful singer in this film.
949;Richard Gere though is another standout as the semi.
950;I must honestly say, I never thought that Richard Gere could sing but man, he can SING.
951;Chicago got its justice with the numerous nominations as it's one of the best musicals to ever come to the big screen in modern times, considering how `out.
952;"fashion' it seemed immediately before ""Moulin Rouge"" came along last year and brought musicals back to life for a new generation of musical fans for the new generation and for the generations of the 21st century."
953;This is a really fun musical.
954;Here's a musical that stands head, shoulders and beautiful, bountiful etc. above the rest.
955;imagine that you get into a time.
956;jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere take you aside and traumatize your senses with the most incredible display of 'Anglo.
957;saxon work ethic' the world has ever seen!Within a very short period of time you are transported to a smoky paradise of song and dance that somehow manages to sound to the core the tragicomic nature of our existence.
958;So not only is it titillating, it's poetically, intellectually _stimulating_ as well.
959;both literally and figuratively) all add up to one very innovative movie.
960;But there are some very good scenes (all of which belong to Richard Gere).
961;True, the characters left a lot to be desired, but Richard Gere played the sleazy lawyer perfectly.
962;But for pure entertainment, watch the Richard Gere parts!
963;After seeing this amazing movie one could very well make a case for this being the best musical ever made.
964;While Singing in the Rain and An American In Paris were both loads of fun and packed with classic moments, Chicago has one thing going for it that the afrementioned films do not.
965;Twenty, thiry years from now somebody somehwere will pop in this movie and declare: The topics in this film are as relevant today as they were when it was first written in the 1930's.
966;Renee Zellweger deserved the Oscar for Best Actress, and would have won if not for Nicole Kidman's nomination and Nicole's previous nomination for Moulin Rouge.
967;But all the performances are astounding.
968;All the lead actors dance and sing, most notably and oddly snubbed Richard Gere.
969;His performance was Oscar worthy without a doubt, conjuring an image of Gene Kelly throughout the movie.
970;John C. Reilly's Mr. Cellophane is also an extraordinary moment.
971;All the singing is great, the costumes are incredibly sexy, and the overally filmaking is top.
972;Thank you for reading my review.
973;The acting was excellent but the movie wasn't what I expected.
974;The transfer was incredibly grainy for a modern movie.
975;This was clearly not a worth the price of admission.
976;Chicago owns it very much to the nifty foot work and dazzling colors by the cast.
977;top and more comical than anything else.
978;Academy winner Catherine Zeta Jones also deserved praise for her sultry portrayal of Kelly Velma and the rendition of the songs.
979;Richard Gere's vocals are obviously enhanced and I would say John C Riley puts in more than a passable effort than Gere.
980;the razzle dazzle culminates in the finale scene with Velma and Roxie performing a very slinky and well.
981;choreographed scene for I Move On against a stunning backdrop of bright lights.
982;in the end, Chicago is fun and entertaining to watch.
983;Lots of action and great hot moves.
984;A movie with a character named Roxie Hart would have to be the favorite movie of a writer named Roxy Hart.
985;Renee, Richard and Catherine amazed me with their singing and dancing ability.
986;This movie gives that story a bit of a spin, making Roxie an aspiring singer (taken with her idol Catherine Zeta.
987;jones who plays a wonderful Velma) and murdering her lover who supposedly can get her into show biz but has just been using her for sex.
988;the fun begins when Richard Gere, smarmy lawyer agreed to take on her case, because she has $5,000.
989;"I loved Gere's tap dance
990;john C. Reilly, who plays Amos, Roxie's husband, is worth noting.
991;His sadness at his wife's trial, is unfliching loyalty and his reaction to his wife's indifference over his love for her are moving.
992;His major number is """"Mr. Cellophane"""", which is simply a showstopper."""
993;It is poignant, sweet, unassuming and simpe, without all of the glitz and glare that surrounds his wife.
994;queen Latifah shines as Mama, the prison matron who is not above being bought.
995;She really only gets one big musical number which is excels at.
996;The fact that most of the singing and dancing takes place in Roxie's head are an effective way of telling the story without making it too talky.
997;This was sheer genius on director Rob Marshall's part.
998;One minute you vsn be front page news, the next minute your face may as well be on a milk carton.
999;chicago does great justice to Bob Fosse's vision.
1000;This was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
1001;Renee and Catherine were delightful, of course, but I was more surprised at the spectacular and unexpected performances by Richard Gere (comedy?
1002;I thought the movie was excellent.
1003;All actors involved did an outstanding job.
1004;i recommend this for anyone looking for a musical.
1005;Kind of blah as story line goes, but I enjoyed the singing (was surprised Richard Gere sang and danced so well) I also enjoyed the many talents of Renee Zellweger.
1006;jones was very good, but being married to egoist Michael Douglas lowers her ratings for me!
1007;This is an outstanding show .
1008;"He definitely brought a seamlessly successful broadway musical to the ""big screen"" with smooth grace."
1009;jones had musical theater in her blood, and came by her singing and dancing with ease and grace (and never looked lovelier accepting that well.
1010;deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, as Velma Hart in this film, right before she was scheduled to give birth to her baby!)
1011;that brings these two women together.
1012;What I will add on to this review, before I close, is just how wonderful the score is by Ebb and Kander.
1013;You know, those great toe.
1014;There is a reason that CHICAGO received an Academy Award for Best Picture of 2002.
1015;You'll love this film, in all of its saucy and enchanting glory.
1016;but I believe that even those who normally don't like musicals will enjoy this, simply because of the unconvential way the song and dance numbers are presented.
1017;i've NEVER liked Zellweger in anything I've seen her in until I saw this.
1018;John C. Reilly's rendition of Mr. Cellophane is beautiful, and who knew he could sing like that?
1019;You HAVE to see it to believe how good it is!!!
1020;but anyways, this movie is beautiful.
1021;It's definitely a crowd pleaser, and for that reason, it definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar.
1022;UGH) winning the Best Picture constantly, and it's about time that something fun and lively such as this took home the statue.
1023;I highly recommend this movie!
1024;existant would produce one of the most entertaining film musicals of all time?
1025;The film takes the dark source material (made even more so by Bob Fosse's original direction) and transfers it to screen in all its delightful decadence, assaulting the senses and challenging the modern preception of what a musical should be.
1026;The world of musical theatre has changed quite a bit since the 1960s heyday of movie musicals, and Chicago offers a glimpse into the more mature world of today's musicals.
1027;coated musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein, it is, yet there is a sense of fun about the entire event that is infectious.
1028;paced and wonderfully acted dialogue scenes, along the way touching upon America's obsession with fame.
1029;of course, the movie's bread and butter are the musical numbers, and Rob Marshall has come up with the brilliant idea of most of the songs being imagined by Roxie and therefore taking place only in her head.
1030;This works especially well for the material, in which most of the numbers comment upon the action rather than reveal plot.
1031;advancing tibits, and although some seem turned off by this cut.
1032;cut editing choice, I think it gives the movie a kinetic energy that helps speed things along.
1033;Marshall never repeats himself, and the result is a movie which keeps the audience guessing.
1034;and then there's the talent.
1035;All of the actors do their own singing and dancing, and I personally had no idea some of these actors were so talented.
1036;Renee Zellweger's Roxie Hart is at once vulnerable yet tenacious, and she handles her songs well.
1037;"She especially scores with ""Roxie,"" and to a lesser extent with ""Nowadays."""
1038;Richard Gere's absolutely charming as self.
1039;Each of them does some stellar work with their dialogue scenes, displaying sharp comic timing and the sort of nuancing only the most accomplished performers achieve.
1040;"Both ladies belt out their numbers with confidence, with Latifa using her music background to score a homerun with the showstopping ""When Your Good to Mama."""
1041;jones sings, dances, and acts her way to a well.
1042;deserved Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Velma Kelly, stealing just about every scene she's in.
1043;"Her take on ""All That Jazz"" is nearly worth the price of admission alone."
1044;chicago is one for the ages, combining a decidely adult and yes, slightly cynical slant with glorious production numbers and brilliant acting.
1045;Anyone with an open mind will enjoy this movie, and as a musical theatre nut I thank God for Rob Marshall's work on this film.
1046;Hopefully, it will pave the way for a second golden age of movie musicals.
1047;Chicago deserved every award it won and more.
1048;The reviewers above must not have watched the same film I did, because Chicago is one of the most refreshing and wonderful films ever made.
1049;Moulin Rouge was wonderful, but Chicago took it to the next level.
1050;"stop ""life is bunnies and daisies"" happiness."
1051;and today, Broadway thrives on sheer fun (Hairspray and The Producers) and hard emotion (Cabaret, Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera).
1052;brilliant performances accompanied by brilliant direction and choreography.
1053;If you do like musicals, then Chicago is a dream come true.
1054;Under Rob Marshall's direction, Chicago manages to achieve the same kind of visceral impact as a live Broadway show, and that is an amazing accomplishment.
1055;The choreography is excellent, the performances are solid, and you're certain to be entertained for a solid two hours.
1056;around excellent musical, doesn't do anything to discourage those stereotypes.
1057;again, if musicals are your thing, then Chicago will probably be your favorite movie of the year.
1058;Nothing about it will convince you otherwise.
1059;the Best musical since ages.
1060;Here's a movie that is sure to really take your breath away, whether you like musicals or not.
1061;Every so often Hollywood comes out with an ambitious production that is pulled off beautifully by director, cast crew.
1062;This is one such example of this!The film stars Renee Zelwegger and Catherine Zeta.
1063;By the time she gets to prison, Velma is the celebrity prisoner who gets all the publicity.
1064;All 3 women are cute in their 1920s short hairstyles, tho I must say I'm glad those hairstyles are no longer around!One of the most impressive aspects of this film is that all the actors did their own singing and dancing.
1065;as a sidenote, it's interesting to note that the film is based on a play that was published in 1930.
1066;good in the sense that a talented group of people went out and tried to pull off a near.
1067;She is musically inclined and enjoys musicals and is a very good sport as I make her sit there through movies like the Scorpion King .
1068;it is actually really good.
1069;also, I'm always a sucker for anything that is visually interesting.
1070;It is really something to look at from a visual point of view.
1071;Two killers, a slimy lawyer and a corrupt wardeness.
1072;The story is kind of how slimeballs can overcome the system which isn't great.
1073;i like action movies with stuff blowing up and monters/aliens.
1074;In this movie you can just kinda tune out on the plot and enjoy the show.
1075;the musical is back i a big way.
1076;moulin rouge was excellent, but chicago is pure entertainment.
1077;the music is the best aspect of the movie.
1078;catherine zeta jones is worth watching the movie by itself.
1079;she totally deserved the oscar.
1080;bravo to rob marshall for making such a wonderful film.
1081;their job is to entertain, and this movie totally delivers the goods.
1082;go see this movie if you want to have a good time and go see this movie if you want an escape from anything.
1083;the movie is so upbeat that you cant help but enjoy yourself.
1084;This is one of my very favorite movie musicals.
1085;"The songs are so great and so much fun!My favorite part about this movie though, is the way in which it constantly cuts back and forth between simultaneous shots of what the characters are doing in the ""movie"" version and what they are doing in the ""stage"" version of the story."
1086;It is this symmetrical blending of the two arts that really appeals to me, and the cinematography is very well done.
1087;I was especially impressed with Gere's and Reilly's performances.
1088;This is the best and most enjoyable stage.
1089;movie adaptation that I have yet seen, and I highly recommend it.
1090;Is it the best movie.
1091;And Moulin Rouge is even funnier than Chicago, but I still love Chicago's songs the best.
1092;This is a great and fun Movie.
1093;The cast is great .
1094;so how can you go wrong and the story while old and is a remake is very well done and worth seeing.
1095;I'll make this brief: Yeah, it deserved all the academy awards it won.
1096;Catherine Zeta Jones is more brilliant as an actress and dancer than she is sexy in this film.
1097;Richard Gere is compassionate and great in a perfect against type role for him.
1098;And Queen Latifa unexpectedly steals almost every scene she's in.
1099;"welcome back movie musical
1100;Well acted, well scripted, the music was terrific, the production exceptional, and the costuming spectacular.
1101;In short, the finest production of CHICAGO you'll see on the big screen.
1102;Worthy of 5 more stars!
1103;The product arrived on time and was in perfect condtion!
1104;Much has been said about the talents of Catherine Zeta Jones and I agree.
1105;Granted Zellweger lacks the experience and polish of Zeta Jones but for someone who has never sung or danced before, I found her performance to be outstanding.
1106;Her renderings of Funny Honey and Nowadays are beautifully effective.
1107;queen Latifah was also great as Mama Morton and you'll be humming Cell Block Tango well after you leave the theater.
1108;John C. Reilly's Mr. Cellophane is another highlight.
1109;Chicago has to be the best movie musical ever made.
1110;Its not your traditional musical where people just walk down the street and burst into song, the music is all in Roxie Hart's head which makes a great movie for those who really don't like movie musicals (like myself).
1111;The best number in the movie has to be Cell Block Tango.
1112;After seeing the film, a few things come to mind.
1113;The film proves that the movie musical is not dead and hopefully is making a resurgence.
1114;The five leads are terrific and deserve any award/recognition that they receive.
1115;The ensemble cast was excellent.
1116;Everyone involved in the film should be very proud.
1117;Bought the item for a gift.
1118;My friend really appreciates it andwas pleased with the product.
1119;The best thing about this movie was that Marc Calamia (hot!)
1120;I love this time period and I think they captured it well and I loved the story.
1121;how exciting to see stars who stretched beyond their norm and displayed such great talent: Renee Z. was great as Roxie, Catherine Zeta Jones WAS Velma Kelly, I'd never seen Queen Latifah before and she was perfect as Mama Morton, Richard Gere blew me away with his singing .
1122;and dancing (I knew he had a musical background but was so impressed with his new venue) .
1123;What a range these actors have!
1124;I am 65 years old and I've seen every musical made .
1125;I can't say enough,i watched it twice after recieving it!
1126;The songs and scenery, costum, and order of appereance were fantastic.
1127;As a movie it was exceptional.
1128;as a broadway show i am truly at a loss for words, with a cast of gold and a plot proven popular it truly comes out on top!
1129;worth the money and time!
1130;if you dont love it you hate it but if you love it you'll never put it away!
1131;A wonderful film adaptation of the Broadway musical, Chicago is the story of the Jazz Age.
1132;in all, the cast is superb, with excellent singing and dancing all around.
1133;I am an AVID musical lover and enjoy attending Broadway shows whenever possible.
1134;In May 2002, a full eight months before the film came to theatres, I saw """"Chicago"""" on Broadway."""
1135;It was, in a word, incredible.
1136;When I learned it was being made in a movie, I was very happy and spent many months anxiously anticipating its arrival.
1137;"jones, in the opening ""All That Jazz"", is simply stunning."
1138;I was equally impressed with Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger, but Zeta.
1139;jones is truly incredible with her interpretation of Velma.
1140;But what surprised me most about all these actors is how well they became their characters.
1141;Their acting, singing, and dancing, is truly what musicals are.
1142;This film is Broadway on a movie reel, and it is not to be missed.
1143;"It does not support murder
1144;I challenge you to watch and find the inner meaning to """"Chicago""""."""
1145;all of the principles performed well but, of course, this is a musical and, while Catherine Zeta.
1146;"jones, I think, did the best job
1147;the storyline, of course, was bare bones, though clever and entertaining.
1148;The thing I remembered most was how beautiful Catherine Zeta.
1149;(I liked her hair a lot better short!)
1150;Chicago is fun and quite entertaining and Zeta.
1151;I love love love this movie.
1152;Did I mention that I love this movie?
1153;zeta Jones much but after this movie she kicks.
1154;:) I also love Renee Zellweger and Queen Latifia and Richard Gere and lets not forget John C. Riley as Ames!
1155;The whole cast was awesome.
1156;Its always fun to watch them make movies.
1157;From the moment she enters and we see a brief flash of her imagining herself on stage, we are aware that this film is half reality and half Roxie's dream.
1158;To do this she creates an innocent persona that is designed by her smooth talking lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) for the media to bring the public to her support.
1159;With his help and the sassy matron of the women's prison 'Mama' Morton (Queen Larifah) Roxie eclipses Velma Kelly's prison girl fame.
1160;Teetering on the brink of superstar celebrity and death row, Roxie will have to give the performance of her life if she wants to save her neck.
1161;Filled with beautifully choreographed catchy musical numbers and a pleasing sweep of fast dramatic action, there is never a dull moment in this film.
1162;It's a triumphantly enjoyable thing to watch.
1163;the greatest reason for this film's success is due to the stunning ensemble of actors many of whom (with the exception of Queen Larifah) we aren't familiar with hearing sing.
1164;jones looks stunning and is fun in her catty diva role.
1165;Ren e Zellweger is perfect for her part of the innocent, but still determined and quietly vicious, Roxie who will stop at nothing to become a star.
1166;Like in the striking film Nurse Betty, Zellweger's character again confuses reality with her dreams and her subtle facial shifts and movement meaningfully represent her psychological conflict.
1167;Most surprisingly, Richard Gere delivers a fantastic performance as the slimy lawyer proving that this actor can really do comedy well.
1168;The director Rob Marshall excellently filmed all the dance numbers to focus on particular moves as well as capture the full action of the performances for the fullest effect.
1169;This movie is a fine example of how a musical film can succeed where its pertinent counterpart (as both films focus on a female on death row) Dancer in the Dark failed.
1170;The musical numbers all take a vital role in both accentuating plot detail and enjoyably moving the film along.
1171;It excels in its ability to entertain you as well as draw you into an exciting story of fame, glamour and death.
1172;I was skeptical of this, but it's actually one of my favorites.
1173;This cast can do it all!
1174;it also has some of the original songs that was heard in the play, back in the '70s.
1175;i am very glad that musicals are now back in the spotlight again.
1176;The dance and music and lyrics of Bob Fosse is still going strong, and it is evident through the big.
1177;Director Rob Marshall stays faithful to Fosse's Broadway intentions, though he does change many things with the way the songs are performed (all songs are sung in reverie settings).
1178;Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere are very good when going along with their solos (""""They Both Reached for the Gun"""" is fun and funny), but John C. Reilly, Catherine Zeta."""
1179;"jones and Queen Latifah steal the show with their dazzling vocals (""Mister Cellophane"", ""When You're Good to Mama"" and ""I Can't Do It Alone"" are well worth the oscar wins)."
1180;this movie is a splendid achievement, and if you don't even like musicals, then you'll probably be surprised at how much you're going to love this film.
1181;I saw this in the cinema originally and had high expectations because I had so loved Moulin Rouge (but in general dislike musicals).
1182;I don't know what the difference was the second time around, but somehow the film worked more seamlessly and was highly stylized and entertaining to me upon second viewing.
1183;I found the performances more compelling, the music more catchy.
1184;Movieviewing in general is more a question of your frame of mind when you see a film.
1185;i was especially impressed with the performances of Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly.
1186;I love watching the transformation of the actors and the characters they play.
1187;one you can watch over and over and still be entertained each time.
1188;j, RZ and RG are excellent, what a talented collection of performers.
1189;production values are top notch .
1190;art direction, staging, choreography, cinematography and most especially the editing.
1191;artistically summarizes life in Chicago at that time in history, uniquely using the prespective of the women.
1192;She dances and the older girls and the younger girls were doing the sister dance and i wanted her to see and enjoy the dance.
1193;The story is a juicy one.
1194;jones has great stage presence and a good voice but was it Oscar worthy?
1195;It's still far superior and much more pleasing to the ears than Richard Gere's voice which I found to be beyond annoying.
1196;Admittedly, she is a charming performer with some real talent.
1197;Her solo number is also pretty entertaining but I ask again, was her performance Oscar worthy?
1198;I have yet to meet someone who, after seeing this film has firmly answered my question with a convincing yes.
1199;jones's opening act and Latifah's charming number are definitely film highlights.
1200;clad women showing off their fine figures and dancing skills and the scene is enhanced by some great choreography and Zeta.
1201;jones, who is again, fantastic here.
1202;The rest of the musical performances are not really worth mentioning.
1203;Lacking intricate choreography, emotion and skill.
1204;The musical numbers are structured and played out like music videos and I think this was a cop.
1205;those who love this film, love it a lot but there are a countless others who feel that the much.
1206;All the actors do their own singing and dancing in this movie.
1207;Richard Gere does an excellent job at his first time tap dance and handling his role in this movie.
1208;I personally loved the whole movie and the people chosen to play the parts.
1209;An excellent movie, fun to watch.
1210;Within the movie, you can feel the Fosse stage charisma for what parts crave dancing / singing, and a few others, while other scenes do mix in well as movie made moments.
1211;the characters are more than fine and dandy, carrying tunes with golden voices, attitude, and a lot of sweat.
1212;jones steals the show throughout as the woman of women in show buisness Velma Kelly .
1213;Her vixen stares to the audience and her commanding strong voice (wow!)
1214;Even Hart's confused husband who can't make up his mind about his murdering wife (John C. Reiley) carries the favourite tune, 'Mr. Celophane' and makes it sound so vaudeville perfect.
1215;Also check out the beautiful Queen Latifah, making sure all of her little girls in the prison ward she runs stay in line, for a litte cash.
1216;Richard Gere is an above average singer and good tap dancer, but makes his best as a lawyer who never loses.
1217;My favourite moments is when our cool bandleader comes around.
1218;His smooth voice, and smooth intro's of anyone and any song was neat to anticipate.
1219;This movie was great!The singing the dancing everything!charactersroxie heart:A girl who really wants to sing and dance on thestage.
1220;After many years of wanting to see this film, I finally got a chance to view it.
1221;I like musicals and loved Moulin Rouge, so I thought I'd give this one a try.
1222;Roxie and Velma take turns lying and deceiving each other so they can get the fame in Chicago.
1223;watching this film, I found it mystifying how so many people and critics could love this movie so much.
1224;if you want to see a musical that is vastly superior, has heart, style and substance, and better acting, see Moulin Rouge.
1225;I really Enjoyed Chicago it put me in a really good mood it made you forget about your troubles for a while.
1226;The music was fantastic as were all the cast.
1227;It is pretty much like every other musical I've seen, maybe a little better than average.
1228;Entertaining, but not something that you will look back on for years to come.
1229;Even a movie like Forrest Gump, an imperfect movie that somehow won the Oscar, is more of a classic.
1230;"If you like ""show tunes"" and like 'dressing up' for your special someone, you will love Chicago."
1231;Chicago was first choreographed by Bob Fosse and he is obviously alive and well, though deceased, in this adaptation of his Broadway musical.
1232;All three do their own singing and dancing and if you LIKE musicals you will LOVE CHICAGO!
1233;The camera work is both mind boggling and riveting.
1234;Speed up here, stop action there and Chicago comes to riviting life.
1235;Reality and hope wend throughout while Roxie and Velma make hope a reality.
1236;Richard Gere is made for this role!
1237;there is a trial and the courtroom scene is a tap dance fit for a lawyer.
1238;The finale is a great recap of all that transpired.
1239;This is a fine step back in time to when musicals were grand, glorious and available and certainly a more common fair.
1240;The sound track fits perfectly into all the nooks and crannies of which the movie shows a plenty!
1241;Supposedly, the Oscar win for Chicago is helping bring back the genre of the musical.
1242;If so, I hope that the new musicals will be modled after the classics, and not this one.
1243;John C. Riley is one of the best supporting character actors of our time, and I can't wait until he starts to get larger roles.
1244;And I absoloutly loved Queen Latifah, who filled the movie with more sass and spark than Renne Zellweger, Catherine Zeta.
1245;Behind all the sparkle on Renne's little tap shoes and the false eyelashes one Catherine, what else is there?Oh one good thing about it!
1246;I gotta say it up front so you know what you're in for if you're reading this.
1247;From the opening scene to the ending one, this was one heck of a lot of fun.
1248;One reviewer said she was born to play this role.
1249;She lit up the screen.
1250;John C. Reilly just broke my heart with his performance and his show stopper .
1251;Sure he can play suave and cool and you can picture him slithering in under the door.
1252;He looked like he was having fun, and I had fun watching him.
1253;I was prepared for Renee Zellweger to be good.
1254;"She not only twisted her husband around her little finger
1255;There's a case on the front page of newspapers right now that parallels Chicago's story.
1256;Still, in spite of all the Razzle Dazzle and the fun, there was still the poignancy of women whose futures were all determined by one mad moment of passion.
1257;It entertained me, and when it was over, I wanted to sit right back down and watch it again.
1258;everyone in the movie did an award winning performance.
1259;i could see it again just to have a another good laugh.
1260;I watched this movie so many times I thought I should own it.
1261;It's my all time favorite movie.
1262;but it is a good sparkling entertainment, and I believe that wherever he is, Bob Fosse would be pleased with this screen adaptation of one of his beloved musicals.
1263;Roxie's Funny Honey with her laying seductively on the great piano in the pink dress is a reverence to the Michelle Pfeiffer's """"Makin' Whoopee"""" number in the Fabulous Baker Boys."""
1264;"Whatever Roxie was doing while she performed that song was not just a singing
1265;And there was Billy Flint (Richard Gere), the silver tongue, the prince of the court rooms .
1266;and his scenes, the clever and funny satire on the TV and big screen court room dramas and comedies (Billy: """"Objection!"""""""
1267;I was not the biggest fan of the actors who played the main parts when I went to see it for the first time but I know good acting when I see it.
1268;"With her first appearance in the opening interpretation of ""All That Jazz"" , Katherine Zeta."
1269;the woman can sing and dance, and she had a lot of fun doing it.
1270;She was born to play Velma.
1271;When the actors have fun enjoying what they are doing .
1272;I as a viewer appreciate it and enjoy watching them .
1273;The following scenes were as delightful as the opening .
1274;Queen Latiffa as Mama Morton, the fantastic Cell Block Tango .
1275;The film even touched me when John C. Reilly was doing his Mr. Cellophane's number .
1276;The fact that he loved a conniving little bitch just made it more interesting.
1277;She acted great, her character was changing constantly .
1278;It was crafted very well and absolutely believable.
1279;with all that said, I am not sure that Chicago was a Best picture of 2002 but I know that I enjoy watching it and I will see it again.4.5/5
1280;One of the best movie musicals ever made.
1281;The editing is the most perfect I have ever seen in a movie.
1282;Reknowned for his complex choreography and innovative staging, director.
1283;choreographer Bob Fosse was well known for his ability to impose tremendous style on even the slightest of material.
1284;After considerable script work, the story of two 1920s jailhouse divas emerged on the stage as CHICAGO, a remarkably dark and visually witty commentary on lust, corruption, and fame at any price.
1285;And with fame, fortune, and beating the wrap high priorities, the two slither, snarl, and play games of one.
1286;the cast is simply amazing.
1287;dance skills on the big screen until now.
1288;esque squirming choreography, and singing the complicated songs extremely well indeed.
1289;Frankly, the late great Gwen Verdon, who originated the role on Broadway, is a tough act to follow.
1290;And when all is said and done, she makes Roxie Hart her own.
1291;naked dancers, wicked wit, and a sexy sneer are the order of the day.
1292;The cinematography is also quite fine, using elements of rapid.
1293;The result is dark, glittering, and remarkably sly in its mix of too.
1294;accurate social commentary and classic music elements.
1295;She did a great job.
1296;I love all the music and the dancing.
1297;Plus the cast was great.
1298;I feel like Richard Gear should have won an Oscar for his performance.
1299;It's a terrific musical and I watched it for the third time.
1300;Actually I don't like musical usually but this one is really great.
1301;And the fact that the choreography is done by Bob Fosse does a lot for the dancing scenes.
1302;Definitely worth seeing at least once.
1303;I thought that this was a pretty good movie.
1304;It was fun to watch and had some good songs.
1305;Ren e Zellweger did a great job, as did Catherine Zeta.
1306;Moulin Rouge was just incredible, and you really have to be open to it.
1307;Chicago isn't strange, mind blowing, and spectacular like Moulin Rouge, but it was still pretty cool.
1308;I would still choose Moulin Rouge or Grease over this, but I thought that they did a very good job with the movie.
1309;studded movie did very well at the box office.
1310;I think this movie is very much worth seeing.
1311;I couldn't watch it over and over and over, but I think I could watch it a couple more times since it is entertaining.
1312;Chicago is a great movie with great music!
1313;If you watch the movie with the Spanish and French audio, the songs for this movie are sung in English!
1314;I was prepared to see Charlize Theron as Roxie Hart, so I was really bummed to find that something hit the fan.
1315;Still, the movie is quite wonderful.
1316;at long last the movie version of one of the best musicals finally comes to the silver screen and boy was it worth the wait!
1317;the whole cast are simply perfect and everything essence of the show is kept in tact , I have seen it twice and it gets better everytime , Ignore the foolish reviews this is a really good film and well worth your time.
1318;jones, Richard Gere and John C Reilly were really great in their roles.
1319;I particularly liked the way the musical numbers were staged.
1320;The fact that all of the singing and dancing was actually done by these actors made it even more enjoyable for me.
1321;Catherine won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance, and I certainly agree with the Academy on that.
1322;Received it in a few days.
1323;i went to a stadium seating theatre with a big screen and great sound.
1324;From the first frame to the last, I loved every minute of it.
1325;The music was great as well as the story and perfomances.
1326;I went back 3 more times to see it, and liked it more each time.
1327;In fact some of it added to certain scenes.
1328;First she is a tough talking prison matron, then she's real nice and understanding.
1329;oh well, her performance especially musically was top notch.
1330;if you're tired of war movies, and sappy comedies, go see this and just lose yourself in two hours of sexy fun with great music.
1331;the cinematography, the choreography, the acting, the singing, and the dancing, you will truly appreciate it for what it is, a work of art.
1332;"If you call Chicago a ""New Age"" musical about the doldrums, downfall and moral degredation of our society you are forgetting that it is a Broadway musical and has been on stage for more than 25 years."
1333;being a dancer myself the dance scenes in the film are amazingly choreographed, and performed just as well.
1334;She's incredible, as is Richard Gere, and Renee Zellweger.
1335;the songs, the dancing, the entertainment.
1336;Chicago is certainly worth all the hype.
1337;Marionette scene was creative as was the tap dancing role which fit Richard Gere's role well.
1338;Stunning cinematography as well as the fabulous show music.
1339;it gets my two thumbs up for sure.
1340;Talented actors,great story line and the singing and dancing first class.
1341;i've watched tons of stage musicals as well as those translated onto the big screen and this version of Chicago ranks as one of the best I've seen, both stage and screen.
1342;the feel to the entire movie was one of genuine fun and the musical tunes were better than the originals performed by previous performers I thought.
1343;didn't think Queen Latifah nor John C Reilly were particularly outstanding (hence my surprise at their Oscar nominations, one of which should have gone to Richard Gere instead) but still held the film together with their decent supporting performances.
1344;The 3 main cast members were very good given that I didn't initially expect much from them from a musical standpoint (til I found out about their musical/dance backgrounds .
1345;overall a very entertaining film.
1346;Well worth watching and listening to a good few more times.
1347;There's a reason this show has gone on so long, on and off Broadway . . . this is great film adaptation of a big, blowsy, bluesy stage show . . . the music is terrific and the performances uniformly excellent (something I never thought I'd say about Richard Gere, in a musical yet) with Zellweger (way too thin, however) a standout in the part of a singer and dancer, and Zeta.
1348;Taye Diggs has a tiny, but telling part . . . he's a comer.
1349;If you're old enough to have loved the golden days of Hollywood musicals, this is a nostalgic trip . . . but even if you're a relative kid, there's a reason everyone loved the big, singing, dancing, Saturday afternoon show.
1350;It was creative, sassy, fun and tounge.
1351;I loved the play on words and the exciting dance routines.
1352;This is simply one of the very best movies to come down the pike in a very long time.
1353;The five principals do a phenomenal job of showcasing their multiple talents.
1354;And, yes, in spite of what some think, they all did their own singing and dancing.
1355;sure, the production values are good, the songs are appropriate, the acting is decent and it has some neat visual moments.
1356;Yet, it doesn`t really work as a solid, consistent film, just a bunch of stylish scenes with an almost nonexistent plot.
1357;Chicago was a great musical when I saw it on the big screen many years ago.
1358;At 64 I look forward to enjoying such good music to prance around to !
1359;and just want to a good old movie musical coming away feeling better.
1360;goer for the sheer glory of this VERY cinematic transformation of CHICAGO.
1361;The intersplicing of real life story with a staged musical version, creating a blur between fantasy and reality is just terrific.
1362;The cast is splendid: Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta.
1363;The direction is tight, every scene well paced, and the camera work is some of the best of the year.
1364;This movie is an utter joy, and the proof is watching the audience applaud at the end, then sing, whistle, and dance as they exit the theater.
1365;renee Zellweger was outstanding in this movie and it is a CRIME that she did not recieve the Oscar!
1366;jones who DID win an Oscar(she deserved it the most), was sexy and humorous in the movie and the fact that she can sing and dance like a broadyway actress helps as well!
1367;Richard Gene is fantastic as a silver.
1368;tounged lawyer and the supporting cast includes a wheeling and dealing Queen Latifah, a cellophane.
1369;"When her ""Funny Honey"" Amos arrives home, he is prepared to take the blame."
1370;"Enter Billy Flynn the best criminal lawyer in all of Chicago, ""All I Care About""."
1371;and is found absolutally NOT GUILTY!
1372;something amazing happens: Velma and Roxie are in a show TOGETHER and have one back all that was lost!This movie will appeal to everyone in some way.
1373;The camerawork is unique and the setting really looks like the 1920s.
1374;The dancing is the best.
1375;making product (and Gere's character can testify that this formula really works!)
1376;Populated with characters no one could like, the musical's stage success was based almost entirely on the songs and Fosse's ingenious choreography.
1377;cutting, annihilating every movement rhythm and Fosse's seductive mix of garishness and pointed subtlety.
1378;This is strictly a musical for those who haven't seen great musicals, particularly those who haven't seen how accomplished movie.
1379;musical directors photograph great dance numbers (Check 'Kiss Me Kate' or the unedited 'Begin the Beguine' production number near the end of 'Broadway Melody of 1940' to see how it's done).
1380;As they usually say about Hollywood adaptations of great stage musicals, the original was better.
1381;Excellent acting, singing and of course dancing!
1382;Sexy and smart at the same time.
1383;Choppy and jarring best describe the transitions between reality and the production numbers.
1384;Richard Gere is the surprise standout with excellent songs and dance routines.
1385;Love the plot and the acting.
1386;I have to say this is one of the best films I have ever seen.
1387;The director does a great job of showing the story of Roxie and Vel.
1388;It is comparable to Moulin Rouge, but with a stupendously better soundtrack.
1389;Still thought that Seabiscuit should've won.
1390;I was thoroughly impressed with the singing talents of our beautiful starlets, the characters personalities, the vivid style of the choreography, the flow of the entire plot.
1391;do you get the point?This should fair well come Oscar time.
1392;It's a lot easier to see on the big screen than Moulin Rouge was.
1393;the songs were excellent, the humor on target, the style, glamour, and glitz well.
1394;"as Gere says, ""This *is* Chicago!"""
1395;I loved everything about it .
1396;the cast, the music, the performances, the story.
1397;I am not usually big fan of Ren e Zellweger, but she really was a perfect Roxie Hart.
1398;wow, I had no idea she could sing and dance!
1399;Be sure to watch the behind the scenes featurette, I really enjoyed getting a glimpse into the making of the movie and learning more about the actors.
1400;It's a been a long time since a Broadway musical rocked the attention of the film.
1401;Indeed, the last such musical to win Best Picture at the Oscars was the classic OLIVER!
1402;While films like EVITA and GREASE made noble efforts in the following years, the Broadway musical genre seemed destined to be a faded memory.
1403;Then came the success of 2001's MOULIN ROUGE which, although not based on a Broadway show, showed that inventive and well.
1404;done musicals can draw an appreciative audience.
1405;In 2002, CHICAGO built on that momentum and brought the genre back into blazing life, while winning 6 Oscars in the process.
1406;In the Cook County Jail, she meets with other female killers including jazzy dance star, Velma Kelly.
1407;Hart and Kelly soon find themselves competing for publicity, status, and even their hot.
1408;as the somewhat innocent, yet ruthless Roxie Hart, Renee Zellweger does a wonderful job in balancing her two conflicting sides, while creating a character that grabs our interest.
1409;Richard Gere is also top.
1410;notch as the slick lawyer Billy Flynn.
1411;type role that easily grabs our attention.
1412;John C. Reilly is winning as the meekish, put.
1413;Queen Latifah wonderfully underplays her role as the prison matron.
1414;And there's the definitive performance of Catherine Zeta.
1415;jones as the sexy and sly Velma Kelly.
1416;With her high energy, strong voice and wonderful dancing, Zeta.
1417;jones creates a film performance that is as definitive in its own way as Ron Moody's Fagin in OLIVER!
1418;She richly deserved the Oscar she won for Best Supporting Actress.
1419;Rob Marshall directs this flick with a sure hand, and with a fast pace and style that makes the film seem much shorter than it actually is.
1420;in the end, CHICAGO is that rare bird: a film musical that remains true to the original, while maintaining its own integrity.
1421;, SOUND OF MUSIC, and MY FAIR LADY, it deserves to stand the test of time as one of the great film recreations of Broadway, and it is definitely worth your time.
1422;What a fine film, truly deserving of all its accolades.
1423;The movie is witty, naughty, funny, colorful and I totally loved it!The cast and crew made this '20 atmosphere and all the actors made unbeleivably marvelous job, just brilliant, I must say.
1424;i always loved musicals (so good to see them coming back !)
1425;", and Chicago is right there with ""Singing in the rain"" and ""Some like it hot"" on my list."
1426;i already bought the soundtrack and catching myself singing those beautiful, funny songs all the time .
1427;so the movie is wholeheartedly recommended by me.
1428;singing actors in leading roles .
1429;Cathy may have played the West End a decade ago, but her high kicks simply isn`t enough.
1430;She can be played down by any number of talented musical stars in Europe and the US.
1431;She is NOT a sexpot!
1432;"She tries valiantly and has her moments
1433;cbicago IS IMPORTANT, and of good work.
1434;Naturally a musical was rewarded and not the horrors of a war.
1435;this is how it has always been!
1436;Chicago is a satiricial product and has important statements"
1437;It is one of my all time favorites!
1438;I could watch it all day every day!
1439;I thought that was great and I wondered how could Gere, Zeta.
1440;The music is so powerful and exciting.
1441;Just rest assured you will be entertained.
1442;After seeing Geisha which Rob Marshall directed and which I enjoyed tremendously, I decided to view Chicago' for which he is better known.
1443;The fact that only one of the three stars ever trained as a dancer and the other two had learned their routines under Rob's tuition and performed them so amazingly well makes the film even more worth seeing.
1444;It's fun and glamourous and a feel good movie.
1445;This was a very well done movie.
1446;Chicago has always been one of my favorite musicals and this movie does it justice!
1447;I am a fan of the Broadway musical format and had been hoping for a movie version of Chicago every since seeing the stage version reviewed on the Charlie Rose show.
1448;esque dance scenes are wonderful and the singing is very good.
1449;I think, however, that the actors did very well, especially Zeta.
1450;You wonder how the director decided on her since she was the greatest gamble.
1451;Was very entertaining and very well done.
1452;Song, story and dance with a twist of Dick Tracy.
1453;One of the great musical that you can't skip from your collection.
1454;A great movie with great service from the vendor!
1455;Excellent, one of the best musicals ever made.
1456;The cast is terrific and they all did their own singing.
1457;Having seen the Broadway revival, I had high expectations for this film.
1458;I got Rob Marshall (who is a choreographer) and loved it.
1459;"All you need to see is ""All That Jazz"" and ""I Can't Do It Alone"" to prove that she deserved the Oscar."
1460;John C. Reilly gave a wonderful performance in Mr. Cellophane.
1461;The best was Chita Rivera's bit part.
1462;Moulin Rouge was shot with interesting camera angles to add to the whimsy of the movie.
1463;Chicago was shot to best show the choreography.
1464;And I also own Moulin Rouge and love it.
1465;So, everybody who is into musicals, can easily add an extra star to this rating.
1466;I also feel that musical belongs to the stage, and like all other stage performances, it is not so easy to transfer into a film format.
1467;having said that, we must remember that making a good film of a musical IS POSSIBLE.
1468;Cabaret is maybe the finest and best known example.
1469;to rate a musical really high, it must be not only a good film, but also contain good songs.
1470;so, was perhaps the film very good, with an entertaining plot or perhaps with deep inner or social sense?
1471;But I stayed in the theater and things started to move faster, with another lady.
1472;So, it started to be kinda funny, but never outstanding and really entertaining.
1473;( But the picture of papers and media brainwashing ordinary people is more timeless).
1474;First of all, she is really sexy.
1475;But man, he played a lawyer .
1476;I have red an interview with Zellweger, where she compared this movie to a beautiful, excellent candy.
1477;Even Oscar jury seemed to prefer the beautiful package over real thing.
1478;product and you can see it if you have enough free time.
1479;Now, let's see how to describe it without giving it away, hm.
1480;People get shot a few times, but they make it as nice as possible.
1481;"It has much in common with the wonderful ""Moulin Rouge"" in that there's a strong visual attack (I think ""razzle."
1482;"dazzle"" is an accurate description!)"
1483;"I don't have that ""this was/was not as good as"" monkey on my back, and can enjoy the movie on its face value alone."
1484;Suffice it to say that I thought the dance numbers were fantastic, and regardless, anybody who can dance as well as Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Zeta.
1485;jones in heels that high has my respect.
1486;The supporting cast is equally top.
1487;Aren't I nice?I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
1488;It had cool songs, great performances, I didn't cringe but a couple places in the movie, and was able to laugh a little as well.
1489;an absolutely genius film starring Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta Jones, and Richard Gere.
1490;She enlists the help of Billy, her only root to escape.
1491;"The Kuberick classic reflects the emptiness of the depravity, while ""Chicago"" has fun with it."
1492;I loved the acting as well.
1493;There were also some good points, such as the lawyer telling Rene's character that she should be happy with her freedom.
1494;"another reviewer said ""All That Jazz"" and ""Cell Block Tango"" stick with you, and he was right."
1495;Roxie Hart, as played by Renee Zellweger, craves to become a famous musical comedy star.
1496;dazzle musical about people who will seek fame at any price, whether via show business or indictment and trial for murder.
1497;Richard Gere's character, the more than slightly sleezy lawyer, Billy Flynn, is more than happy to represent Roxy Hart, for a price.
1498;Flynn also represents the singer/dancer and fellow felon, Velma Kelly, portrayed by Catherine Zeta.
1499;Chicago is a truly entertaining and enjoyable film.
1500;jones, who, in real life is an honest to goodness singer and dancer, is simply wonderful as Velma Kelly.
1501;Richard Gere's performance as the lawyer has just the right touch of slickness required by the role.
1502;"Queen Latifah steals the show as the ""lets make a deal"" prison matron."
1503;"She is sexy and deliciously sardonic when she takes center stage in ""When You're Good To Mama."
1504;"My only criticism of Chicago"" is that while the musical numbers are often terrific, the movie too often feels a little bit overloaded with them."
1505;On the other hand, I have to admit that it is well done, made by intelligent and creative people.
1506;She is attracted by the idea of becoming as famous as Velma Kelly, a well known vaudeville actress.
1507;She sees her dream come true when, due to some unusual circumstances, she finds herself in jail, next to her idol, both of them beining accused of murder.
1508;this is a nice satire at the address of Chicago and its legal system, at a time when jazz was gaining fans and alcohol was prohibited.
1509;i also admire the creativity and the rich imagination the movie makers proved when they associated the jail atmosphere with a stage where prisoners performed their own acts.
1510;i recommend this movie only to musical fans or to those who are great admirers of Catherine Zeta.
1511;We really enjoyed the blue ray version of Chicago.
1512;The colors were so bright and the music is intoxicating.
1513;"It is a fun movie to watch, but the blu ray version is just ""WOW!"""
1514;I had epected something more to be perfectly honest.
1515;"Yes, sure, the acting is good, and all the actors are very well cast
1516;what I lacked was a solid story, and likeable characters.
1517;The only character that is sympathetic has really only one line and is hanged in the middle of the film.
1518;If you want a nice song and dance film I would recommend Moulin Rogue, or Cabaret.
1519;I have been a fan of Chicago the musical for years.
1520;I really loved this film.
1521;I did really enjoy Catherine Zeta.
1522;I do not think this is the greatest musical movie of all times, but is a good one.
1523;They are both truely amazing.
1524;and both she and Renee are very well cast.
1525;Richard Gere also was a surprise.
1526;I choose this rating because the movie is good.
1527;What I like about the movie is that winner of six Academy Awards (2002) including Best Picture and starring Academy Award, Best Actress nominee and Golden Globe Best Actress winner Renee Zellweger, Academy Award Best Supporting Actress winner Catherine Zeta.
1528;jones, Academy Award Best Supporting Actress nominee Queen Latifah, Golden Globe Best Actor winner Richard Gere and Academy Award, Best Supporting Actor nominee John C. Reilly Chicago is a dazzling spectacle cheered by audiences and critics alike!
1529;They also share Billy Flynn, the town's slickest lawyer with a talent for turning notorious defendants into local legends.
1530;What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it.
1531;I would recommend this movie to other people.
1532;rate dance numbers which attempt to """"jazz up"""" the story."""
1533;The only thing worth watching is the first.
1534;rate song and dance duet performed by Zellwiger and Zeta.
1535;I didn't expect much from Richard Gere or Renee Zellweger going into this movie, but they really all did such fantastic jobs.
1536;This was truly the most classy and fun movie of the year.
1537;Musical sequences are intertwined with reality sequences that truly make Chicago a very memorable movie.
1538;This musical is a real delight.
1539;The songs are very dynamic and pleasant.
1540;The choreography is extremely brilliant.
1541;The film uses all possibilities it can find and require to transform the screen into a total ballet, with several layers of dancing, especially a background that has its own autonomy and yet takes part in the whole thanks to editing special effects.
1542;The film constantly shifts from the real story into the musical construction and imaginary artistic dream.
1543;And yet the film is highly entertaining and pleasant and tries to show in all possible ways that women are the victims of men and have to organize themselves to resist this male.
1544;So contradictions and contradictions, and contradictions.
1545;The fact that this picture somehow stole the Best Picture from Lord of the Rings (a true masterpiece) is beyond me and makes the Oscars a joke in my opinion.
1546;The dancing by Catherine Zeta Jones is remarkable and the singing both by her, Renee' and (of all people) Richard Gere is very entertaining.
1547;Queen La. is also very good.
1548;The story line with all it's twists and turns along with the overall acting and singing done by each performer makes this a great musical.
1549;QL and Renee really spice up the magic to weave this twisted tale.
1550;This is the way a Broadway musical should be translated to the screen.
1551;its a great movie and was especially fantastic on thr big screen.
1552;Finally a musicale come along where the whole nation is talking about it and going to see it.
1553;It's rare that a musicale is a box office hit and musicales have been declared long dead but can Chicago bring it back from the dead.
1554;The film went on to win best picture and it deserved it.
1555;The film is excelent and at times beyond great that makes this an excellent picture.
1556;The acting is great from all stars and the musicale numbers are beyond excellnet.
1557;The film is raw and is full of every thing a movie should be.
1558;One of the years best films.
1559;It's all about the choreography!
1560;Bob Fosse is a god!
1561;A very fun musical/broadway movie, a must see at least once in your life.
1562;It provides a great portrayel of a 1920's Jazzy Chicago that is satirical and realistic (except for the part about people spontaniously breaking in song and dance).
1563;But most of all what keeps this from being a favorite of mine is probably the most important element in a musical, THE MUSIC!
1564;That kind of thing is easy to do in a movie and is much more impressive on stage.
1565;in short, a half great.
1566;I'd like to thank the Academy for giving her the Oscar.
1567;Playing the suave, charming, yet self.
1568;helping lawyer Billy Flynn, I grin every time I see him come onto the screen.
1569;His song, Razzle Dazzle is my dad's favorite, and a real toe.
1570;The songs are incredible, my favorites being the Cell Block Tango, Both Reached For The Gun, and the ever.
1571;The dances are so well choreographed, too.
1572;The pace is quick, the acting stupendous, and the dialogue is sharp and witty.
1573;This film easily blends humor, drama (HUNYAK!!
1574;, and of course songs amazingly well.
1575;One of the film's best aspects is its beautiful cinematography.
1576;Bottom Line: This is one of the best musicals we've had for a while!
1577;the witty screenplay, the infectious music, the sequined sexiness (here I really have to applaud the genius behind the most focused and judicious use of sequins I've seen in a long time), the in.your.
1578;face energy I have craved for years.
1579;it provided the answer to my question above .
1580;What's more, because the Director was smart enough to work with the weaknesses of the actors, and incorporate them, it assisted the credibility of the exercise.
1581;catherine Zeta Jones was astonishing.
1582;She fleshed out Roxie in often surprising ways.
1583;She embodied a special kind of determined vulnerability.
1584;Her Roxie looks fragile and vulnerable, but she allows us just the right glimpses into a determined, steely interior to keep us on her side but wary.
1585;I wish long life and happiness to all who made it happen.
1586;Fun movie and love the music, not a big fan of Renee but enjoyed her in this movie and always love Queen Latifah.
1587;It's one the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time.
1588;First of all I felt like the movie was worth the 9 dollars I paid to see it.
1589;Catherine is amazing in this movie, Renee is going to be the next Julia Roberts, she is going to blow up after this, and Richard was surprisingly good when it comes to the vocal department.
1590;Queen Latifah was also amazing in the movie, although I felt one person could have played that part better, and that is Nell Carter, RIP, but Queen did great.
1591;The dancing is amazing, the fianl number with Renee and Catherine floored me, and when the movie was over the people at the movie were clapping and cheering as if we were at the broadway show.
1592;Roxie and Velma made you cheer for them.
1593;I would go see it again and again.
1594;What a great musical made even greater on Blu Ray disc!!!
1595;A great film all around,I can definatlely see why this got the Best Picture statue for 2002!!!
1596;I'm so disappointed this film won best picture.
1597;"My girlfriend agreed that ""Chicago"" was just a moderately, modestly decent film."
1598;"I would have preferred something with more depth and meaning like ""Gangs Of New York"" or ""The Pianist"" to win best picture over such lightweight fare as ""Chicago""."
1599;No other words to describe this glorious film perfection all around , with an amazing score , fantastic performances and just perfect art direction it is hard not to like it.
1600;All the cast put in career best peformances and it is so superbly adapted from the stage show nobody alive today could of directed it better.
1601;By far the best film of the year.
1602;I am a huge fan of broadway and musicals in particular.
1603;When Moulin Rouge came out I was very excited, so I made the trip to theatre.
1604;They did such a wonderful job adapting it for the big screen.
1605;The cast was perfect, the visuals were wonderful, the music was great!
1606;I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of musical theatre.
1607;filler, scenes which could be dropped out.
1608;"contributed reviews for ""Chicago"" make it sound like the film (and the original play and earlier works they're based on) is a treatise on the virtues of sex and liquor."
1609;Clearly, the visuals tell us, he's a manipulator.
1610;both female leads, excellently cast (although I would entertain arguments for others in the roles, these are fine examples of the craft), are similar manipulators.
1611;It's telling us that we have a voyeuristic need to follow their stories, to be entertained by the media instead of being informed by it.
1612;It is a great film, even if it's a bit uncomfortable in places.
1613;The girls are thrilled to have it again.
1614;The disc was in brand new condition and arrived in a timely manner.
1615;brings back all the memories of New York.
1616;zeta Jones was phenomenal and gorgeous, while Rene Zelwegger was kind of annoying.
1617;Thank you for the product.
1618;This is one of my favorite movie musicals and I could have sworn I had a copy, but I did not, so I indulged and bought it.
1619;Have a great new year!
1620;Although I enjoyed the music in this film, that's about it.
1621;I was pleasantly surprised at Catherine Zeta.
1622;jones and Rene Zellweger's singing and dancing ability, that much I will admit.
1623;It really helps to see the movie first (the movie/musical is excellent, even for those who don't like musicals!)
1624;The movie was fantastic on the big.
1625;"I've never seen the stage version of ""Chicago"", so I can't say if the movie was faithful to the source material, but judged on it's own by a pair of fresh eyes, ""Chicago"" was a lot of fun, especially considering I'm generally not crazy about movie musicals."
1626;After seeing this movie I clearly understand why it had won 6 Oscars including Best Picture.
1627;catherine Zeta Jones has a very nice voice and plays the confident Velma with bravado.
1628;The remaining roles are filled quite nicely by Richard Gere as Billy Flynn and Queen Latifah as Mama Morton.
1629;The songs are really catchy and choreography was wonderful.
1630;It's great to see some actors who don't normally sing and dance be pushed to the edge of their talents.
1631;Overall it's a great production.
1632;The director did an excellent job of splicing the musical numbers with flashes of the actual events that keeps the film moving along.
1633;"I do recommend ""Chicago"", even for the ones who don't generally flock to musicals."
1634;This movie is fantastic, and you can't beat it for the price.
1635;Would recommend it to anyone in the market for a kick ass musical.
1636;"I saw ""Chicago"" on stage a few years ago and I can say this movie is basically the stage show on camera minus the live show's energy."
1637;The actors clearly had a blast making this movie.
1638;jones are both great singers, although Zeta.
1639;jones is clearly more talented in both singing and dancing.
1640;Richard Gere's singing voice is nearly unlistenable in my opinion.
1641;"the comparisons to ""Moulin Rouge"" are inevitable, but as far as a movie that features a memorable story and songs, it is clearly superior to ""Chicago""."
1642;Moulin Rouge is definitely the more inventive of the two (and in my opinion, the better).
1643;best picture of the year?
1644;This movie is based on a 1975 Broadway Musical about media influence and the circus that the American public allows itself to be caught up in.
1645;Funny that this is still so very very true 28 years later.
1646;i loved the Broadway version of this story featuring Bebe Neworth and Ann Ranking, and I did like the movie version as well.
1647;important willfull suspension of disbelief that makes movie magic successful.
1648;Rene Zellweger makes a remarkable first effort.
1649;It adds such an interesting touch to the story (even if it was accidental and a mockery of the late choreographer's disabiltiy).
1650;Inclusion of more of the original dance numbers would have made this a perfect 5 for me.
1651;i believe this film, and all involved deserved Oscars.
1652;From the beginning to the grand finale this is a great show.
1653;I thought the grand finale with Roxie and Velma was brillant.
1654;The singing, dancing, choreography and acting are all fantastic.
1655;But if you enjoy musicals, especially stage based, then Chicago is sure to please.
1656;Im sick of the couple of people here trying to say its not as good as moulin rouge , This is an adaptation of a stage musical that is 30 years old , Moulin Rouge is not , Chicago is a far superior film of the musical genre.
1657;best Film of the year HANDS DOWN.
1658;The movie is excellent, entertaining, and top.
1659;person performance is always better, but the movie version is awesome.
1660;But Oscar best film award?
1661;Moulin Rouge should be the true worthy winner the previous year, but unfortunately it has to take a whole year for them to realize the success of the musical genre, and as a felt guilty payback, to give the award to another just so.
1662;This makes it the most unworthy Oscar ever.
1663;the visual and musical effects are stunning.
1664;this DID come right from a Broadway musical.
1665;jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere star in this highly anticipated remake of the classic Broadway musical.
1666;"Let me just say that this is the best musical since ""Moulin Rouge""."
1667;I bought the soundtrack before me and a friend of mine went to see it.
1668;Not only that, but this was Rob Marshall's first film and he also did all of the choreography for the dance sequences.
1669;Congradulations on winning best film, best actor and best actress Chicago.
1670;This is a highly entertaining movie, and a most successful adaptation of a theatrical musical.
1671;the acting, direction, music and visualisation are superb.
1672;Rob Marshall has made that transformation in a most imaginative and original way.
1673;having the movie glide from the gritty reality of 1920s era Chicago to a fantasy world.
1674;the singing and dancing is excellent.
1675;this is a textbook example of how to film a musical.
1676;and it stands a second viewing.
1677;A decent adaptation of the Bob Fosse classic.
1678;jones shows off some terrific talent.
1679;passions flame, blood flows and notoriety glows in a showcase of talent.
1680;It's simply my take on the movie.)
1681;these two multi talented actresses are fabulous in their roles.
1682;richard Gere as Billy Flynn, their slick lawyer, showcases his talent as an actor and as a song and dance man.
1683;jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere,John C. Reilly, and Queen Latifah all showcase their talent gloriously in Chicago.
1684;stand up and take a bow!Chicago is a blazing success!
1685;First, I love all of the stars in this movie.
1686;jones, but I was impressed with her talent, too.
1687;It was very cool to see them together in a musical because, other than QL, I had no idea that they all had song and dance type talent.
1688;if you want to see a gripping musical, watch Moulin Rouge.
1689;This movie is the perfect example of everything that is going on in Chicago in the 20s'.
1690;All characters are portrayed beautifully by Renne Zellweger, Cathrine Zita.
1691;You will be singing along with these songs in the shower in no time!
1692;Great movie I recommended 120 percent it's my favorite musical of all time.
1693;But I can, and I will call it the best show of the year 2002 and probably the best show of 2003.
1694;The music is great .
1695;And yet the superstars of this show are the guys from the choreography, from the lighting, from the scenery, costumes, .
1696;"so show"" and a stuning and unforgetable performance."
1697;Chicago: loud, brassy, poignant, fast.
1698;and I want to see it again and again.
1699;Generation X will enjoy it as much as old fogies (like me).
1700;This adult musical about how two women get literally get away with murder while tirelessly pursuing fame translates a 20th century musical package into a highly entertaining, compelling and solid form, as a realistic 21st century movie.
1701;It boasts wonderful, tuneful period.
1702;Cabaret did this quite successfully too but then the concept disappeared.
1703;The result: a more gripping film.
1704;mUSIC ORCHESTRATIONS: Most are done by the 'theater's' jazz orchestra, giving it a period sound, a musical flamboyance that honors (and I think helps popularize) that era's zippy musical style.
1705;A FIRST for a movie musical!!!
1706;Standout performance: Queen Latifah, in her role as the prison matron, Mama.
1707;layered acting and her charismatic song performance are highly satisfying.
1708;Second standout performance (and most recognized) John C. Reilly, as the throw.
1709;She's supremely paired with Renee Zellweger, who displays incredibly versatile acting depth.
1710;the city of Chicago is known as the Second City but the movie Chicago will increasingly be considered among the top musicals ever filmed.
1711;will increase as time goes on.
1712;A film by Rob MarshallConsidering that I saw this movie months after it had won the Oscar for Best Picture, I went into it with somewhat high expectations.
1713;It was a good movie, but not necessarily a great movie, and certainly not the best picture of all of 2002.
1714;Granted, choosing the best picture is an entirely subjective task, but the movie wasn't all that it was cracked up to be.
1715;The man she was seeing told her that he had a connection and could get her an audition.
1716;Velma was a huge star of the stage, and Roxie wanted to be just like her.
1717;the rest of the movie focuses on Roxie as Billy builds up her celebrity so that she can potentially be acquitted of the charges.
1718;There are really two movies here.
1719;First, is the real story of Roxie and how she gets to court.
1720;The other movie here is the musical.
1721;Some of the musical numbers are just so so, but some are actually memorable (two that Richard Gere does, oddly enough).
1722;There is a routine where Roxie feels that she is just Billy's puppet, and this was fantastic and the best one of the show.
1723;John C Reilly gets one number, and that man can sing!
1724;Sure, Zellweger was the lead, but Zeta Jones was the reason the movie was a success.
1725;Without question, she deserved her Oscar.
1726;All they need is the right angle to play and maybe a fast talking lawyer.
1727;Think about the parallels today: the biggest is obviously the O. j. Simpson case with Johnny Cochran as the lawyer.
1728;But, any big case becomes bigger and more spectacular when the personal on trial has (or gets) a measure of celebrity.
1729;The only truly likable and sympathetic character is Roxie's husband, and he is a pushover.
1730;i know that Chicago won Best Picture.
1731;The only thing I can attribute this to is that Renee Zellweger, while she did a good job, could not command the screen.
1732;Catherine Zeta Jones is an example of an actress commanding the screen.
1733;It's a good movie, not a great one, and there were better movies in 2002.
1734;"good"" entertainment: in reality, this is a dark, grim, cynical downer of a movie."
1735;The music is catchy, and the acting is solid throughout, but it's all in service of a story that didn't deserve to be sold.
1736;I can without a shred of hesitation say that the new film version is not only one of the best movies of the year, but it's also one of the best movie musicals of all time!!!
1737;Rob Marshall skillfully handles the material with gusto and flare, and Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters) adapts the play in an almost effortless fashion.
1738;Together they were able to retain the satirical value of the Kander/Ebb/Fosse musical, and as a matter of fact utilize it to their advantage.
1739;It needed to be something that fits with the context of the story.
1740;All of them are brilliantly staged, and though they'll be compared to Fosse's style you won't stone the filmmaker's to death if it doesn't match.
1741;Each number is also filmed and edited with striking precision and never misses a beat.
1742;"I knew Zellweger could sing since ""Empire Records"" and I was also aware that Zeta."
1743;"I definitely wouldn't want her to catch me with her sister doing ""Number 17: The Spread Eagle,"" And as a plus when she has the screen she holds it especially with her opening number ""All That Jazz"" which she sings with a power that rivals that of Chita Rivera, and Bebe Neuwirth."
1744;ultimately the answer proves to be a big YES!
1745;He fills the screen with, dare.
1746;It's ironic, last year we were surprised when Nicole Kidman belted out a tune.
1747;And surely enough my prediction has proven to be correct.
1748;Same also goes for John C. Reilly and his meekly sympathetic portrayal of cuckolded husband Amos Hart.
1749;His rendition of 'Mr. Cellophane' is definitely a milestone in this film and invokes pleasant memories of Charlie Chaplin and the Marx Brothers.
1750;Oh, and on a sidenote Lucy Liu was delicious in her cameo as Go.
1751;all in all Chicago is a close to perfect stage.
1752;I saw this movie today and was pleasantly surprised.
1753;The cast was superb, surprisingly enough, the sets were excellent, the costumes were wonderful, and the production was great.
1754;It was like going to see a really fantastic Broadway show and having the best seats in the house.
1755;even if they didn't like musicals, the movie was above par in all other applicable categories, as well.
1756;While it's great to see that .
1757;Most of the other great film dancers did, too.
1758;we get a lot of actors in various postures, and constant cutting by the director.
1759;I enjoyed the stage version very much, but the film is superior.
1760;It is a lot of fun contrasting between the harsh reality of 1930s Chicago and the fantasy world of Roxy Hart.
1761;This had a lot of 'train wreck' potential, but the directors pulled it off wonderfully.
1762;Watch the transformation between reality and fantasy.
1763;Notice the difference between how Roxy imagines Billy F, and the way he really is.
1764;This movie is fun, the music is memorable, Bob Fosse would have almost been pleased.
1765;This movie explores the Themes of Temporary Celebrity Status and is wholly redeemed by the presence of Ms. Catherine Zeta.
1766;jones who is always a delight to watch onscreen.
1767;The musical story of Roxy Hart's fall and rise made for great Broadway when I saw it.
1768;The musical numbers were fine.
1769;Oh well, there's always next year.
1770;This was a great addition.
1771;Watch it often just for the music.
1772;Richard Gere is fantastic and his performance in the court room is outstanding.
1773;I normally don't enjoy Broadway plays converted to Movies but this absolutely is one of the best movies that I have watched.
1774;I like the movie to a point, but the plot was a little corny, but the actors were great and great sound.
1775;I haven't been a big fan of movie musicals, but this one I absolutely loved.
1776;The film is just an all around fun time.
1777;This will certainly make the film enjoyable.
1778;I actually found the movie to be very funny and charming.
1779;"People seem to be skipping ""Chicago"" because they assumed that ""Moulin Rouge"" was great and ""Chicago"" will ruin that idea."
1780;"You will be surprised how wonderful ""Chicago"" is."
1781;It is certainly a fun movie to watch and enjoy.
1782;Winner of Six Academy Award (2002) including Best Picture and Starring Sexy Rene Zellweger (1969.)
1783;CHICAGO is a dazzling spetactle Cheered by audiences and critics alike !
1784;The movie itself is outstanding, but if you're at all interested in the additional material, you'll love it.
1785;Chicago is easily the best stage.
1786;Both stand as tributes to the work of Bob Fosse, the dancer, actor, choreographer and director whose unmistakable style is the very essence of this film.
1787;Fosse brought jazz to Broadway, bringing together two of the most American of art forms.
1788;He brought that same magic to movies and this film is the perfect homage to his craft.
1789;Chicago beautifully blends theatrical and cinematic space and style in a way that few films before have achieved.
1790;It remains flawlessly faithful to the stage production while enhancing it with electric editing and pulsing pace.
1791;While many musicals have been muted and diluted by their transition into movies, under the lean vital direction of Rob Marshall, Chicago is actually invigorated by it.
1792;much of this has to do with some unexpectedly assured performances from a cast not usually known for soft.
1793;known background as a musical comedy actress.
1794;She brings it all to bear from the first moments when she turns celluloid into sequins from her breathtaking opening number.
1795;Despite her wispy screen presence and skeletal frame, she has a robust talent and her moments on screen are quite magnetic.
1796;Richard Gere is equally remarkable and he carries off the role of the publicity.
1797;hunting lawyer with great relish and considerable charm.
1798;Chicago gives you the ol' razzle.
1799;dazzle but with exciting new energy and direction, and few films this year will be as rousing or as dazzling.
1800;I saw this movie and I really liked it.
1801;I was very pleased with Richard Gere, who I think had a great voice, something along the lines of a twenties or thirties radio personality.
1802;That has become my favorite song of the whole thing.
1803;Very fast service, and the product was in great condition.
1804;was so colorful it's so nice,superb!
1805;spectacular spectacular!if Chicago won Best Picture this should have won!Remember Chicago fans Moulin Rouge was the whole reason why Chicago was made and won Best Picture they honored the Best picture to Chicago because they didn't let MOULIN ROUGE WIN!
1806;By the way, SOUND OF MUSIC is superb!very nice!
1807;It took a long time to get to thhe big screen, but it is worth the wait.
1808;Amazing work be all of the cast members, a delightful surprise for all the fans of these actors and Broadway in general.
1809;WHOEVER thought it up, it was stunning and exciting.
1810;I'd recommend it to anyone.
1811;Every person on the screen did a superlative job in his/her part.
1812;Of course, I was a child at the time, but I still love the songs.
1813;Chicago may not be for everyone, but I loved it.
1814;I bought this one to get wide screen.
1815;Richard Gere still needs more dancing grace and skill.
1816;Although I thoroughly enjoyed CHICAGO the movie, I admit a strong preference for the Broadway version, which is far more intimate and raw than the cotton.
1817;candy color of Rob Marshall's debut film.
1818;Sure enough, the leads are superb .
1819;Renee Zellweger reafirms my belief that she is one of the great actresses of our time, while Catherine Zeta.
1820;surely an Oscar awaits her on March 23rd for her vivid portrayal of Velma Kelly.
1821;"John C Reilly is a grand ""Mr. Celophane"" and THE Queen, Latifah, is a hoot at Mama, the prison warden."
1822;Movies of hit musicals rarely achieve the spectacle one feels on stage, and Chicago is better than MOST movie musicals to be sure.
1823;Anyone without the benefit of huge stage musicals at your doorstep would be wise to take a trip to the Windy City.
1824;it's that good a movie.
1825;The score is wonderful, the songs will keep you humming for days, and again, the performers are terrific, through and through.
1826;"finally, many folks are forcing comparisons between Chicago and last year's musical treasure, ""Moulin Rouge."""
1827;In my opinion, the Baz Lurhman spectacle was a superior film, for the exect same reasons Chicago is a better stage event.
1828;Moulin was filled with unexpected pleasures .
1829;like cynicism manages to squeeze its way between the lines of the film while its rare moments of dialogue compete with the well.
1830;choreographed dance numbers in an interesting manner that is all but captivating.
1831;fame essence, along with emotional insight on the media circus mentality that has existed.
1832;Nice sentiment, but one I already knew.
1833;It isnt that Chicago is a bad movie and it is obviously an expertly performed musical.
1834;As the second of the first two big film musicals in years, Chicago will forever be compared to Baz Luhrmans Moulin Rouge.
1835;Yet, they both star the best scene in the movie, the one where Renee is a puppet and Gere is the puppet.
1836;body and with his face turned to the camera).
1837;Praise for John C. Reilly and, specially, Queen Latifah, good and imposing supporting actors (funny as well).
1838;The actors are right there, in the stage, in front of you.
1839;Even if it's the best play ever played, your mind is set to know it's all make.
1840;That's why musicals are good when on stage.
1841;"As a comparison example, ""Moulin rouge"" was another movie."
1842;"musical, but in it Baz Luhrman was able to create the whole ATMOSPHERE of a play, and in ""Chicago"" Rob Marshall couldn't
1843;the """"4 stars"""" I give """"Chicago"""" is because I could see that all actors and crew members wanted so much to make this movie an unforgettable one."""
1844;Chicago is a great old musical.
1845;It has a funny story, and good characters.
1846;jones and Richard Gere on the other hand are stunning.
1847;John Reilly (universally beloved schleppy husband) does a fantastic version of Mr. Cellophane , almost worth the price of admission in itself.
1848;It's a true shame, because of the other actors and because the production itself is so well done.
1849;The costumes, soundtrack, lighting and camera angles are fantastic.
1850;Bravos to the cast, boos to Zellweger.
1851;For it to win the academy award is beyond me.
1852;Oscar has become a joke.
1853;Everything about it I enjoyed it has to be the first musical I ever liked.
1854;She wrote a book and it was made into a musical.
1855;Director Rob Marshal thought it would be a great idea to make another movie, but this time it would be with most of the musical numbers.
1856;The actors were hand picked for their talent and their ability.
1857;the film opend with the memorable song titled All That Jazz , and went on from there.
1858;Roxie compeats with Velma for the headliners with the help of Billy Flyn, the greatest female criminal lawyer in all of Chicago.
1859;so if you don't like this movie, that's fine.
1860;i thought this was a great movie.
1861;The dance choreography was great.
1862;Even though I am a live theatre fan and have seen the show on stage, I thought the movie was amazing.
1863;Of course the vocals and choreography were fabulous, but what I especially liked was the lighting and special effects.
1864;Kudos to everyone in the cast and crew!
1865;Racy topic, but the music is fabulous.
1866;The jailhouse tango is classic choreography and music.
1867;Love the music and dancing.
1868;It's a fun movie .
1869;all likeable in their own way
1870;This wonderful production combines the talents of a myriad of fantastic performers.
1871;Veteran actors sing and dance as if they've been doing it all their lives and slick and creative musical numbers follow one another at a dizzying pace.
1872;She ends up in jail with one of her idols, played by Catherine Zeta.
1873;talking lawyer played to perfection by Richard Gere.
1874;Each major character gets to shine in at least one solo number and both Queen Latifah and John C. Quinn deliver a show.
1875;This is a highly entertaining film, and it contains some themes which are brilliantly satirized.
1876;This is a wonderful film and is highly recommended.
1877;One of the best musicals on the market.
1878;Songs are terrific, as is Catherine Zeta.
1879;She certainly deserved the Support Actress Oscar.
1880;This movie was so great, the cast had a lot of chemistry and the whole was put together well, it's an instant classic
1881;Being a dancer, actress, and avid stagegoer I was excited to see Chicago before it was ever released.
1882;When I finally saw it I was practically dancing in the aisles.
1883;Cell Block Tango has absolutely wonderful dancing, and the music is magnificent.
1884;I was so impressed I own the soundtrack as well.
1885;I recommend Chicago to anyone who loves musicals!
1886;I loved Moulin Rouge, but I'm sorry, this movie is better.
1887;I was so excited when this movie arrived.
1888;The film was very gritty on the screen and did not play well.
1889;the story, the characters, the music!At least once a year we enjoy playing it.
1890;It's a visual and auditory treat!
1891;Modern Day West Side Story with a equal impact.
1892;the best I've seen in many Years.
1893;Wow kids, thanks for the trivia but what does that have to do with how wonderful the movie is!?
1894;Chicago is a very well written musical by Fred Ebb, John Kander and Bob Fosse that is still playing on Broadway today in its revival incarnation.
1895;In 2002, Mirimax released the wonderful motion picture adaptation.
1896;jones sings and dances Velma Kelly just as well as previous Velma, Chita Rivera and ever better than Bebe Newirth.
1897;Richard Gere, although nasil, does a wonderful job as Billy Flynn.
1898;She is a true musical performer who has great comic timing.
1899;rob Marshall's direction and choreography is excellent.
1900;The editing is even better.
1901;Bill Condon's screenplay is brilliant.
1902;The two men have put together a brilliant spin on the great show.
1903;Chicago, like previous reviewers have said, won 6 Oscars including Best Picture.
1904;A film this good and this sucessful (most finanically sucessful of all Mirimax films) deserved a two disc set.
1905;I am so glad it won the BEST PICTURE Oscar and all the stars in it deservesd and ocsar too!!!!
1906;Funniest and most Fun movie I've ever seen.
1907;At no point did the movie drag and I want it to move to he next scene and that makes it a truly rare movie.
1908;I had heard so much about this movie and all I can say is.
1909;I think it's a great movie to watch over and over again
1910;Awesome cast and a great spin on legal drama.
1911;I was very impressed with the singing and dancing by A. list actors.
1912;Chicago I thought was a wonderful movie.
1913;I still think each actor did a wonderful job with the songs and the story line even if it seem simplistic to some.
1914;I'd like to see Nicole Kidman do that.
1915;I love musicals and this is definately one of my favorites!
1916;It won 6 Academy Awards including best picture.
1917;Beautiful movie, i highly recommend.
1918;A better than just good movie and Renee Zelwegger made it that for me.
1919;For years I've thought that this would be fun to see, but doubted that it could work since the only director that I've thought made this style of show translate was the late great Bob Fosse (CABARET).
1920;imagine my surprise when Rob Marshall did the most shocking thing possible for a film director of a stage musical.
1921;the hat to the original.
1922;Chicago is an incredible film, highlighted by its revolutionary way of blending the musical numbers with acting.
1923;The idea that the preformances were part of Roxie's mind is brilliant.
1924;You know it and you know you love it!!
1925;Great product at a great price.
1926;It helped clarify some of what is going on in the songs.
1927;Easy to recommend if you like musicals or have seen the broadway show and enjoyed it.
1928;Chicago was such a great movie.
1929;The songs were full of pure emotion and soul.
1930;Every person in the cast deserved the role.
1931;It deserves to win every one of those 13 academy awards.
1932;I loved Moulin Rouge but this was even better.
1933;It is not just a chick flick and I highly recommend it!OVERALL SCORE:95/100!
1934;This is one of the top 10 films I have ever seen!
1935;The whole cast was brilliant and brought so much life to the story.
1936;When I think of this movie, I see it in splashes.
1937;Wow, now that was dancing.
1938;Velma was my favorite character in the movie.
1939;I didn't really think Renee had too much in the way of dancing to do, so I had a much greater respect for all of the work Catherine had to do for the singing and dancing (and Cell Block Tango?
1940;This movie definately deserved Best Picture as did Catherine deserve her best supporting actress Oscar.
1941;You'd think there would be way more extras on a best picture winner.
1942;i hope so, because I'd really like to see way more extras.
1943;The comments that Moulin Rouge pales in comparison are so right (and here I am an Australian saying that:)).
1944;Baz hold the camera still please!Chicago has it all .
1945;"tremendous screen presence from the leading ladies, a surprising good ""patter"" song from Richard Gere, and the brilliant ""Cellophane Man"", not to mention the extended dance sequence ""Jailhouse Tango"" which has to be up there with the best filmed dance sequences."
1946;Chicago is an interesting film, since it implies the audience as a driving factor in the search for fame within the main characters of the film.
1947;In addition, the film's musical and dancing elements boost the messages to such an extent that the messages become easily comprehendible.
1948;The editing also increases the tempo of the film as well as the score.
1949;Lastly, the cast helps provide a brilliant cinematic experience that is enjoyable for everyone, even those who usually don't enjoys musicals.
1950;Good and interesting story with absolutely top.
1951;Everyone should see this film.
1952;This is my favourite film ever.
1953;All the cast and crew did a fantastic job on the production.
1954;I love this movie and it was cheap so it satisfied my budget and added to my collection.
1955;each song is so unique and original.
1956;This really is an incredible film.
1957;Catherine Zeta Jones is so powerful, as is Renee Z. Ruchard Gere is at his best, as well, which was a cool surprise!
1958;The customer service was attentive and concerned with doing a satisfactory job and they did.
1959;The production value is amazing, the actors are phenomenal, and the songs will be stuck in your head.
1960;I got my reluctant husband to watch this, and he loved it.
1961;the book that inspired this movie is pretty spectacular too.
1962;Extremely pleased and trust Amazon implicitly.
1963;It is delightful and fun.
1964;I would have to say that I found the film visually wonderful.
1965;And I also really liked some of the performances, especially from Zeta.
1966;And I do have a respect for the choreograpy work that was put into this movie and the singing that was performed.
1967;But I felt that the film moved at an awkward pace.
1968;The movie kind of felt like a big flashy ride over an extremely bumpy road.
1969;It just seemed like the events of the story moved along rather fast and were blurred by the big musical/dance performances.
1970;I absolutely can see why this film would be brilliant to others.
1971;I do have a big respect for Chicago, but I don't have to like it as much as I have to respect it.
1972;Renee Zellweger stars in this musical ode to the jazz.
1973;the musical numbers are big, loud, and splashy, and exist mostly in Roxie's imagination.
1974;All of the stars do their own singing and dancing, and are all surprisingly good.
1975;The music deserves five stars.
1976;"the script and cast rate three stars from me
1977;Rob Marshall's jazzy adaption of Bob Fosse's 1975 Broadway musical CHICAGO is a successful attempt at combining court.
1978;And while it may not win big at the Oscars (My bet is on GANGS OF NEW YORK), it still displays enough kinetic, energising spirit to make it a worthy contender for the awards.
1979;Marshall's knowing direction makes the whole film enjoyable and the musical numbers are as kitchy as they are catchy.
1980;An exhilarating film that keeps up its flashy sense of fun until the closing credits, CHICAGO does razzle and indeed, dazzle.
1981;Wou"
1982;Despite the basic nature of this film being grounded in murder and those who committed it doing whatever they can to get out of it, the way in which the story was written within a musical just makes it so hilarious you'll find yourself just happily enjoying this film all the way to the credits at the end.
1983;it is absolutely no wonder to me at all that this film won six Academy awards, all of which were well deserved.
1984;I believe it takes an unusual and refreshing film like this to win that many Academy awards.
1985;jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly and Lucy Liu all deserve extraordinary praise for their respective performances in this exceptional film.
1986;"Who knew that this big star could and or would do singing and dancing on film
1987;Chicago is nothing less, in this reviewer's opinion, than the best musical ever made!To be perfectly honest, I'm not a huge musical fan, but this film and the sound track for it is just so enjoyable you don't have to be a huge musical fan to enjoy the film and the performances by these great actors.
1988;the premise:The setting for this film is Chicago in the twenties which makes it the perfect setting for the entire film as it is learned in the Behind the Scenes special that it is somewhat ground in the true story of several women killing their husbands or boyfriends and the huge media blitz over their trials.
1989;Taking that into consideration and the timing of the film, being in the twenties when women were struggling for more rights, you have all the ingredients for the plot of Chicago and then throw in the musical aspect and then throw in several exceptional actors and actresses and you have Chicago.
1990;It's in jail that she meets up with Matron Mama Morton (Queen Latifah) and Velma Kelly who is played so brilliantly by Catherine Zeta.
1991;Velma has been in jail for some time now after the films exceptional opening with her on stage singing and dancing All that Jazz.
1992;It seems she found her sister in the bed with her husband and she whacked the both of them.
1993;I highly recommend this exceptional film to any and all, whether you're a fan of musicals or not, you will enjoy Chicago.
1994;I watched the blue ray verson, and it was very grainy and fuzzy.
1995;I enjoyed it I enjoyed.
1996;The film is as bright and comedic and enjoyable as I remembered in the theatres.
1997;this was such an amazing musical everything about it was soo much fun I totally loved it so did my mom and the family I went to see it again the next day , I love the soundtrack too I never stop listening to it you must see this film!
1998;the music is big and rhythmic and powerful.
1999;bUT is it good?The girls are everywhere and designed to stimulate.
2000;the acting is on a grand scale.
2001;the cinematography and set design and colors are terrific.
2002;the movie is creativity incarnate.
2003;Chicago is a musical 'satire', but nonetheless a musical set in the roaring twenties when times were understandably wild.
2004;the flick won 'best picture' award and rightly so.
2005;jones are extended by her song and dance talents as well.
2006;This is a fantastic musical.
2007;From the beautifully designed sets, to the period costumes, to the show.
2008;stopping song and dance numbers, it will simply razzle.
2009;The director and his singing and dancing troupe of stars simply pull out all the stops in this brilliantly executed musical.
2010;Velma, who together with her sister, was a dance hall success, killed her husband and her sister when she caught them together en flagrante delicto.
2011;roxie Hart, an admirer of Velma Kelly, is married to Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), a good.
2012;There, she meets her idol, Velma Kelly, who finds her hero.
2013;He understands the thirst of the media for the perfect sound.
2014;dazzle musical numbers move the story along.
2015;jones is terrific, looking impossibly beautiful and showing off her musical theatre background to great advantage with """"All That Jazz"""" and """"Cell Block Tango""""."""
2016;Queen Latifah is outstanding as the sly and voracious Mama Morton, who goes whichever way the wind is blowing.
2017;She also has a show.
2018;Renee Zellweger, though not a professional singer or dancer, shows that she can sing and dance with the best of them.
2019;the men also shine in this musical.
2020;"suffering husband, also has a terrific number, ""Mister Cellophane"", that is truly heart rending and poignant, as well as metaphoric."
2021;"Richard Gere gamely rises to the occasion in his first musical, making the slick Billy Flynn character an integral part of the film with his ""Razzle Dazzle"" number and his tap dancing."
2022;i love this top notch, clever film, finding it hugely entertaining.
2023;"It deserves every one of its six Academy Awards, including that for ""Best Picture""."
2024;Director Rob Marshall deserves kudos for this brilliantly directed, seamlessly edited, musical masterpiece.
2025;While it is a fairly faithful screen adaptation of Bob Fosse's Broadway musical, it has Rob Marshall's contemporary imprimatur on it.
2026;It is a film of which he can be justly proud.
2027;I loved the show!I went to the movie with optimism and skepticism: Would they do it justice?
2028;Simple answer: More justice than the Cook County courts!What a delightful ride!
2029;real people of limited ability and means showcased in fantasy splendor.
2030;I have to give credit to director Rob Marshall .
2031;he and his crew did a fantastic job bringing my favorite musical to the big screen.
2032;"Tough act when you've seen this show on Broadway multiple times and understand ""Chicago"" transmits best when live on stage."
2033;I loved Marshall's idea to have the musical numbers play out in Roxie's head and this is one of the many reasons that it works.
2034;The sets and costumes are wonderful too.
2035;jones whom is a talented dancer/singer, both Zellweger and Gere had a lot of courage to sign up for this film.
2036;"Watch Gere's footwork in the tap dance scene and also his opening number ""All I Care About is Love."""
2037;"Catherine's ""All That Jazz"" rivals Bebe Neuwirth."
2038;And Renee was the biggest surprise of all for me.
2039;"I loved her renditions of ""Funny Honey"" and ""Nowadays."
2040;Queen Latifah was hilarious as Mama Morton.
2041;"taking all these facts into consideration, ""Chicago"" is outstanding film and hopefully brought this wonderful musical to many new fans across the world."
2042;If you like musical theatre and theatricality in your movies, you will probably love Chicago.
2043;The film is faithful to the original Bob Fosse style, and the performances are fully committed and top notch.
2044;It seems that one carry.
2045;however, if you prefer the style of your films to be realistic (cinematography, art direction, acting), you will HATE this.
2046;I would highly recommend it for your video library.
2047;We hope that you will enjoy it as well.
2048;I brought this for my husband and he loves it.
2049;from the first few moments of Chicago, in a swanky, upper class booze soaked cabaret, one feels transported to the sexy times in beautiful technicolor: the roaring twenties.
2050;Arriving from the floor to belt out a thrilling number, Catherine Zeta.
2051;jones is the best thing about the film, as a vampish, gorgeouss, voluptious murderess.
2052;Out of all the Velma Kelly's potrayed throughout Chicago's life on stage and screen Catherine Zeta.
2053;the meticulous, wonderful cheoreography in All that Jazz is what makes it my favorite number, but it's hard to pick.
2054;beautifully, Chicago tells the story of Roxie Hart, a floozy turned celebrity by murder.
2055;through an array of spectacular songs, Chicago makes it clear that it's the best film of 2003.
2056;The costumes, sets, creativity, and lighting is enough to blow ones visual sences away.
2057;Richard Gere is very good, and who knew he could belt out a tune with style?
2058;Queen Latifah and John C. Reily shine as signature supporting roles, and there numbers are some of the best in the film.
2059;But they all dont add up to Catherine, who is sheer brilliance.
2060;but the biggest star of Chicago is Rob Marshall, whose impeccable strength and creativity shined through in the thrilling direction and cheoreography of Chicago.
2061;musical person, Chicago is something to see.
2062;The best film of 2003.
2063;Chicago's direction is superb and the continuity is impressive.
2064;"The acting is convincing and never gets flat
2065;The line was around the block and I thought, this better be worth it.
2066;renee was phenomenal as was Catherine Zeta Jones.
2067;They were lively, funny and had really strong voices.
2068;I was so impressed with his performance I forgave him for The Mothman Prophecies.
2069;As alway my girl Latifah was a strong supporting character.
2070;everytime they did a musical number I thought, """"okay this is my favorite,"""" only to find that I enjoyed the next one even more."""
2071;anyway go see this movie.
2072;It is worth the lines and the waiting.
2073;After all, it's a musical.
2074;And so I went to see it and sat in a packed theater just plain relaxing and letting myself be completely entertained.
2075;Yes, this is a musical.
2076;But it's done 2002 style.
2077;there's also fantastic film editing and camerawork, and such great pacing that I was completely carried away with the story and the music.
2078;So when vaudeville star Velma Kelly, played by Catherine Zeta.
2079;She's married to John C. Reilly, who's a bit dumb but loves his wife.
2080;She convinces him to pay for her defense.
2081;It's all great fun to watch.
2082;And the magnificent singing and dancing numbers really do move the action along.
2083;John C. Reilly also has a vaudeville background.
2084;But Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere had to learn to sing and dance for their parts.
2085;But this film translates it into a musical event.
2086;And, even though the plot gets a little lurid at times, everyone can enjoy it.
2087;It's a big, bold and beautiful production.
2088;If possible, try to see it in a theater with good sound.
2089;Be sure to see it before the Academy Awards .
2090;and make sure you see it before it leaves the theater.
2091;Renee Zellweger gives the performance of a lifetime and you will fall in love with her character Roxie Hart.
2092;"jones is amazing
2093;Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly and Richard Gere all give an extroadinary performance!
2094;so go see it soon!
2095;NOTE: This has moved moved from the theatrical release page, which no longer exist to the blu.
2096;roxy Hart is obsessed with becoming famous.
2097;the music is timeless, and many of the shows musical numbers have become standards such as """"All that Jazz"""" and """"When You're Good to Mama"""", which transcend their source material, and this recording is a little less abrasive than the 1996 Cast recording which I own."""
2098;less effective, whereas Rene Zellweger covers all Roxy's bases, she has the charm that makes people love her, and the hidden evil and deadly persistence that makes Roxy interesting and who she is, while her voice isn't extremely strong, it is very expressive.
2099;jones is great as Velma Kelly.
2100;Singing all the songs with zest and making them her own, while not necessarily as strong or gleeful as Bebe Neworth, she holds her own.
2101;Richard Gere is a better singer than expected and holds his own.
2102;the film is beautiful to watch, and the camera work at times is a little too frantic at times, but it captures the story very while.
2103;"All in all a strong version of the Broadway musical with a message that will always be important as long as celebrities exist, and especially while ""reality"" shows remain popular."
2104;It came quickly and I thought in the condition in which it was represented.
2105;The title of this review is no exaggeration this movie was truly amazing.
2106;This movie based on the Broadway musical is better than the musical ever was.
2107;This movie was able to take the vision that the writer had and bring it to life in a way that the musical never could.
2108;It was able to clearly separate reality from fantasy with dazzling dance numbers, fantastic music terrifically performed by the stars.
2109;This movie is one of the best movies we have seen in years and it is not even in the same league of alot of the dribble that Hollywood has been subjucting to us.
2110;Even if you hate musicals go to this movie just to see the cell block tango, it was amazing.
2111;And Richard Gere Should have been nominated for an Oscar as well he was excellent.
2112;I thought that the singing, dancing, and acting was outstanding.
2113;I loved being able to see rehearsals and the secrets of how the play came to be.
2114;I am a huge fan of musicals, and this one didn't disappoint me one bit.
2115;The journey of CHICAGO from stageboards to sound stage is probably worthy of A LOST IN LA MANCHA documentary.
2116;Yes, the score is basically true to the original theater rendering (minus some numbers, abbreviating others)and the dance moments are reminiscent of Fosse's original steps.
2117;comedy appearances on their resumes, but Zellweger was a true neophyte, an actual ingenue.
2118;it's Zellweger who anchors this movie.
2119;jones's superior dancing skills and belting, full.
2120;She's beautiful and can take a close.
2121;It's Renee Zelwegger, with her breathy voice, peculiar looks, gangly body, and exposed nerves that catapults this into a memorable flick.
2122;She sings her role, but it's so much more than that.
2123;She lets us see how Roxie is dying for fame, so much so, that she kills for it.
2124;goodness emotions, and she uses her choreography to make her character both vulnerable and steely, abused and abusive.
2125;It's as if he is distancing himself from the very medium he is honoring.
2126;And the story is certainly not inspiring.
2127;But the dancing, the music, the sets and lighting, all make it a WOW movie to watch.
2128;jones definitely steals the show in the musical performance department.
2129;She is absolutely scintillating .
2130;But Renee and Richard also hold up their own quite nicely.
2131;Bravo for all three performers!Queen Latifah actually stole the show for most complex character development, however.
2132;"She was subtle
2133;i twitched through the whole film, wanting to dance along with the numbers.
2134;And stayed right through to the end of the credits in order to determine who danced and sang for Renee and Richard.
2135;I strongly recommend this film for any who like good musicals.
2136;This will be a classic!
2137;The music is so awsome and they picked the perfect people for each of the characters
2138;I have been waiting so long for Chicago to hit the screen and boy was it worth it , the cast are so suited and the music has never sounded better , Trust me this was worthy of Best Picture and Catherine Zeta Jones what a voice!
2139;One of my all time favorite musicals, so glad to find it on Blu.
2140;We had all seen it in the theater at least once and loved it.
2141;Even my 17 year old daughter remembers much of the soundtrack that she heard many times when she was little!This is a great musical!
2142;The acting, the story, the soundtrack, the overall movie.
2143;The price was right too.
2144;Chicago is a brilliant screen adaptation of a great musical!
2145;The 21st century audience is jaded from the great classic happy.
2146;lucky musicals of old, but this musical embraces the media.
2147;savvy, fame seekers that surround us.
2148;Visually stunning and stylistically amazing.
2149;I love the old Hollywood style musicals, but I love this too.
2150;The songs are performed well, and the trick to shooting them without losing movement of the story works amazingly.
2151;It's simply wonderful and a must.
2152;see for every movie fan.
2153;CHICAGO on film was a surprise.
2154;Thought Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta Jones and Rene Zellwegger and their star power might overwhelm their roles, but they glided right into them.
2155;The story shined along with the music and choreography.
2156;It made musicals contemporary again .
2157;won best picture for the Academy Award.
2158;For a kind of noir musical set in the windy city, enjoy!
2159;CHICAGO is a fantastic and energetic adaptation of a great Broadway musical to come to the silver screen in a long, long time.
2160;It has magic and electricity and is filled with extremely brilliant musical performances by Catherine Zeta.
2161;They all have extremely well refined voices and the performances of Zeta.
2162;jones's singing with her incredible dancing was memorizing.
2163;The production design and the camera work keep you on your toes!Other standout performances include John C. Reilly (The Perfect Storm, Magnolia) as the not.
2164;They both have incredible voices and screen presences.
2165;It has a very big """"showman"""" type feel and look to it."""
2166;the story is sharp and witty and revolves around the women in prison who kill their boyfriends, lovers or husbands.
2167;The music and energy are well worth the ticket.
2168;I love this movie more than just about any other movie in existence.
2169;disc extravaganza that I had expected from the start.
2170;The songs and dance numbers were the best part.
2171;With this one, it was absolutely correct.
2172;I enjoyed this movie so much, I had to order my own copy.
2173;I then ordered the soundtrack because I loved the music so much.
2174;The extras are really good.
2175;The extended musical scenes are put together combining shots from the movie with those at rehearsals.
2176;The feature itself and its commentary track is the same as the first one released.
2177;ray transfer is outstanding and fun to watch
2178;This reviewer was surprised to find the film to be unbelievably extraordinary!
2179;the talent of everyone in this musical was amazing.
2180;Catherine Zeta Jones, who has the most astonishing beauty, perfectly portrayed Velma Kelly.
2181;She can sing, act, dance, and in her thirties, still do the splits.
2182;I was also very impressed with the performances of the other actors.
2183;In fact, my favorite number was the 'puppet' song and dance!
2184;A fun view start to finish with great music and dancing.
2185;She performs all over so when she got it she was so excited!
2186;First of all, people may not agree with me, but Chicago IS a great movie.
2187;also notice that the number I can't do it alone has a great choreography.
2188;and there are some great camera angles and tricks.
2189;But after all, watching the movie is loads of fun and I recomend it to all of you.
2190;For those who have seen the broadway play, or for those who haven't it is just a wonderful representation.
2191;The music and the dancing is spectacular.
2192;Chicago was amazing and deserved every oscar it got (and then some!)
2193;Chicago had amazing music too!
2194;My daughter had learned the hard way about loaning movies to friends, she loaned Chicago to a friend 3 years ago and never got it back.
2195;Needless to say she was pleased to get a replacement.
2196;And show tunes sicken me.
2197;And I appreciate good acting.
2198;One of the best movies ever made.
2199;The editing was unique and engaging.
2200;The dancing is exciting and original.
2201;If you love musicals, this is one for you!
2202;Great story, lively music, big celebrities.
2203;A true classic with a rocking musical score, the actors are spot on the entire movie, and the dark storyline is absolutely enchanting.
2204;Chicago is one of the best musicals I have every seen.
2205;I love pretty much every musical number.
2206;wonderful and could watch it again and again.
2207;No wonder it won so many awards!
2208;It's brash, but that is precisely its motivation.
2209;It has to be .
2210;"There are a lot of great scenes, my personal fave being the climactic courtroom scene late into the film wherein Richard Gere's character verbally tapdances his way to his client's acquital
2211;(Rob Marshall is a choreographic genius.)
2212;Good singin', good playin', good (tap)dancin'.
2213;With all the hype surronding Chicago, I expected a great movie but what I got was a decent music video that just happened to be almost 2 hours long.
2214;It's lone saving grace was Renee Zellweger who was fun to watch and made me laugh several times.
2215;This movie is worth seeing but i don't think I would want to own it.
2216;Chicago may not be the most deserving of Best Picture winners, but the plot is solid, the acting is fantastic, the choreography is great, and some of the songs are very entertaining (see Gere's tap dancing scene), while some of the others seem to go on forever.
2217;But, the film has such a feel.
2218;We empathize and care about the characters, even when they are doing everything in their powers to get fame and fortune.
2219;jones is very good, also very ruthless, and we feel her pain of being yesterday's news.
2220;jones should have won either"
2221;I like the film, the music is good, Rob Marshall never really has impressed me as a director (which is why Polanski took home the Oscar), and I don't think that the film was good enough for a Best Picture win.
2222;"The best picture of 2002, in my opinion, wasn't even nominated
2223;Chicago may not be the best picture of 2002, but it's still a good film and should be enjoyed.
2224;CHICAGO is one of the most amazing theater going experiences I have ever had.
2225;i was fascinated, engrossed, and enchanted from the first frame until the last.
2226;the cast is superb, the songs are incredible, and the story is pure fun.
2227;everyone looked sensational and sang even better!!!
2228;I was impressed not only by the performances but also by the singing voices of the perfect cast.
2229;the songs blend together with the plot absolutely seamlessly, sometimes to jaw.
2230;the director did a remarkable job.
2231;i was wowed throughout the whole production and recommend the film to everyone, no matter what their taste in film.
2232;everything about CHICAGO screams brilliant.
2233;oscar is written all over it.
2234;simply put, this film is excellent!!!
2235;I'm a Generation X'er and this must be a nostalgia trip for the Baby Boomers or something.
2236;The group was quite professional and wonderful which prompted me to order this from you.
2237;It's delightful and will always be well received.
2238;Chicago had a great cast and they performed very well.
2239;I love musicals and I find most of them to be uplifting and cheerful with lots of energetic tunes.
2240;Wonderful dancing and story line.
2241;I trust that will be soon.
2242;It's Bob Fosse at his best.
2243;The entire cast is absolutely marvelous.
2244;He'd have been so proud.
2245;It is nice to see a movie that isn't filled with explosions, bad language, gangs, aliens, etc.
2246;The casting was super and it's a great change to hummmmm new tunes and practice new dance steps.
2247;I've always enjoyed the old musicals and this was wonderful to see a modern one take a chance on the big screen.
2248;I have always loved the music.
2249;this film creates a stunning visual and musical facade in order to mask the fact that you dont care about the characters because theyre all terrible people, and the one character with a good heart gets viewed as though he is invisible(though in the movie its meant to be funny).
2250;This movie was really good.
2251;Grat acting, great songs, great cinematography.
2252;I didn't see the play, but this was a great movi by itself.
2253;You would think that a movie that won best picture should at least be a decent movie.
2254;Great writing, huh?The manipulation of the justice system in this movie is preposterous.
2255;If you want to see a good musical, see Paint Your Wagon.
2256;That is at least amuzing and has likeable characters, including Clint Eastwood.
2257;I am a huge fan of movies.
2258;Chicago is a decent musical, but is more of a chick flick musical.
2259;chicago tells the story of Velma and Roxie Hart.
2260;Will Roxie and Velma go and stay in jail for murder or will they run the night life of Chicago.
2261;She is one of th most beautiful woman in the world.
2262;She is great as Velma.
2263;I dind't think she was as good as Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge, but Catherine does a worthy job singing and dancing.
2264;She has a great voice and dances well.
2265;It's funny towards the end of the movie as you can see she is staring to show her pregnancy.
2266;Catherine and Queen Latifah easily steal the show in my opinion.
2267;She sings and dances all right, but not as good as the others.
2268;richard Gere is smooth in the movie.
2269;He does a good job being the lawyer.
2270;girls and die hard musical fans will like Chicago.
2271;I can see why it won best picture because it is a good film.
2272;I don't know that I have ever seen such a gripping musical on film.
2273;The casting is perfect and the dancing is truly superlative.
2274;PLEASE get this film and explore the real and fantasy lives of Roxie Hart as portrayed by Zellweger.
2275;It won best picture and it deserved it.
2276;The movie musical was a popular form of entertainment, as well as a dependable source of income for studios, from the advent of sound in the 1920s until the late 1960s.
2277;The genre's zenith, at least in terms of financial results, was achieved in 1965 with the release of the wildly successful """"The Sound of Music""""."""
2278;frenzied, yet still stylish and vastly entertaining.
2279;"Now comes ""Chicago"", which, though more traditional than ""Moulin Rouge"", is a fresh, inventive movie that is quite in keeping with today's tastes in entertainment."
2280;the movie is based on the hit Broadway musical, which itself was based on an old play about flappers, showgirls, murder and music in late 1920s Chicago.
2281;Velma has a singing and dancing career.
2282;The movie cleverly uses Roxie's dreams and fantasies to introduce some great musical numbers, some of which are real showstoppers.
2283;But who knew that Gere is a great singer and can even tap dance up a storm?
2284;`Chicago' is a real treat.
2285;Whether the movie musical is experiencing a true revival remains to be seen.
2286;I, for one, hope that it is.
2287;I disagree with the reviews that put this film on par with the stage production.
2288;Veteran character and stage actor John C. Reilly, playing the humdrum hubby Amos, ironically provides the most interesting glimpse of the bittersweet energy at the core of the story.
2289;Queen Latifah also bucks up the production a bit.
2290;Richard Gere is a favorite.
2291;The music is super, the song.
2292;dance very cool, basically I loved it!
2293;She shoots a guy and ends up in prison.
2294;the movie is a musical.
2295;I liked that one song where they sang!
2296;One second of not singing please.
2297;certainly, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere shine together but great direction by Rob Marshall enhances a perfect plot and makes every character a star including the deceived husband, prison mates and even Velma who's annoyingly played by the equally annoying Zeta.
2298;I thought this film was wonderfully done.
2299;It takes a lot of work to take something from the stage to the screen.
2300;I totally recommend this film for everyone, even if you're not into musicals.
2301;I have to give it at least 3 stars for the performances of Catherine Zeta.
2302;I was really excited to see this film in the theater.
2303;It's been ages since I've seen a Broadway like hit at the movies.
2304;Some people liked Moulin Rouge.
2305;The cast is incredable: Renee Zellweger (who learned to dance and sing in a matter of months) is spectacular and should have won an Oscar for this film, with along side the extremely talented and strong voiced Catherine Zeta.
2306;jones, Queen Latifa (who's the best in this movie, then I've ever seen her in anything else), and the amazing Richard Gere who will make you smile with his numbers and dance moves.
2307;Meanwhile, while making enemies with the famous singer/dancer Velma Kelly who then both compete for media attention.
2308;the storyline, the music which fits extremely well and I have listened to this amazing soundtrack over and over again, makes this the best classic movie of all time and is well worth all the awards and nominations.
2309;She then went onto writing the play which turned into the Broadway Hit with help of Bob Fosse.
2310;What impressed me the most was how theatrical the film really was.
2311;jones could sing, and of course she impressed me (as always), but I was stunned by Renee Zellweger's outstanding performance, as well as Richard Gere's.
2312;They were all fabulous: even Queen Latifah was good (now there's something I thought I'd never say!)
2313;it was an amazing film that really captured the razzle dazzle of the stage show, very brassy and daring and energetic.
2314;I'm always pleased with their website and service.
2315;bring back the MGM musicals of the 1940s 1950s.
2316;CHICAGO won a year before Seabiscuit.
2317;Listen to her songs and watch her dancong.
2318;"Be sure to strap yourself as you enter the sexy, wild world of ""Chicago,"" the 2003 Academy Award winner for Best Picture."
2319;She has an affair with a man who promises her a ticket to stardom.
2320;She soon lands in jail with the prospect of being executed.
2321;He helps reshape Roxie's image and starts her on the path she's always dreamed of: one to public adoration and popularity.
2322;Complicating things is Velma Kelly, another dancing murderess played deliciously by Catherine Zeta.
2323;The two, both represented by Billy, compete for his attention and the biggest stories in the papers.
2324;what follows is a circus of greed, sexuality, sensationalism, and secrets, all coupled with bright lights, powerful songs, and bold dance numbers.
2325;"Chicago offers us all a peek into this secret world of the jazzy but corrupt roaring 20's, much like Baz Luhrman's ""Moulin Rouge"" clued us in on turn."
2326;much in the style of Luhrman, director Rob Marshall employs a very quick camera style.
2327;This adds an element of dizziness as the characters witness their world being turned upside down.
2328;It makes the dance numbers appear more sharp and more in.your.
2329;jones, an incredible singer and dancer, lights up every stage she's on and every scene she's in.
2330;Gere is surprising as slimy Billy Flynn, delivering vibrant songs and outrageous courtroom dramatics.
2331;Queen Latifah was fantastic as Mama Morton.
2332;Her solo was one of the spiciest moments in the film!
2333;He is the most honest and good.
2334;natured character in the whole film.
2335;the direction, production, costumes, set design, and editing were all brilliant.
2336;For once, I actually agree with the Academy: this movie was the best of last year.
2337;Simply put, it is cinematic perfection.
2338;This movie was the best musical i have ever seen.
2339;Richard Gere sings better than i would have ever thought and Renee was great.
2340;The songs were very catchy and the story was very well done.
2341;Im not a big fan of musicals but this movie was very entertaining.
2342;I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a great movie.
2343;"Rob Marshall's ""Chicago"" is a big, bold, brassy musical that once and for all blows the cobwebs off the Musical Movie genre that ""Moulin Rouge"" began last year."
2344;the revelation of this film is Renee Zellweger, who can not only play the soft and pathetic side of Roxie Hart with the expected expertise but also plays the cunning and conniving side as well with conviction.
2345;And she can sing and dance also.
2346;If the songs and the performances of said songs are good I'm right there with it, if not.
2347;Chicago has good songs and great performances.
2348;catherine Zeta Jones plays Velma but in many ways this is a familiar style role for her: smart, sassy, sexy.
2349;billy Flynn looks like a role Richard Gere has been wanting to play his whole life because he seems to be having so much fun that we in turn have loads of fun watching him sing and dance and over.
2350;top, big Technicolor ice cream cone of a movie that is good to the very last lick.
2351;Leave your troubles at home and enjoy.
2352;CHICAGO won the best picture oscar a couple of years ago, and at the time, I had not seen it, but being a fan of movie musicals over the years, I was happy for its success.
2353;Gere truly took a chance as a singing, dancing Billy Flynn, but he is marvelous and he DID deserve an Oscar nod.
2354;"Reilly too is revealing in his CELLOPHANE MAN number
2355;jones also had much more pizzazz and energy than Zellwegger.
2356;Who knows how great it would have been if Velma and Zeta.
2357;This beautiful actress is talented and has shown diversity in her many roles.
2358;I have seldom been so thoroughly entertained.
2359;The music, dancing, and acting are wonderful, and the editing of dialogue scenes mixed in with the musical numbers enhances the experience.
2360;'Chicago' succeeds at this by staging all the musical numbers as stage performances, but using close.
2361;My wife enjoys doing plays so this has helped her a lot when practicing.
2362;That has scenes of men in prison talking about how they shot, stabbed, or poisoned their wives and how the wives deserved it!
2363;This film is just one example.
2364;It's interesting that a musical that was not a hit when it premiered in the 70s has become such a massive hit as a movie, especially in an era when so few Broadway musicals have been transposed to the screen.
2365;certainly a lot of the popularity of Chicago has been a consequence of the popular cast, who may have been hired for their star qualities, but who.
2366;turned in first rate performance.
2367;I'm sure these two alone brought a lot of people into the theater.
2368;The real stars of course are Catherine Zeta.
2369;jones and Rene Zellwiger, whose song and dance routines impressed even those critics who panned the show as a whole.
2370;i also suspect that part of the greater success of the film over the stage version is that today's audiences are more conditioned to expect the dark and ironic in the musical theater.
2371;Perhaps, then, Chicago is the perfect musical for 90s.
2372;Not the first time I see this movie.
2373;Have no fear those who are skeptical of """"Chicago"""", this film delivers!"""
2374;I was blown away, however, by the exciting and original way that director Rob Marshall integrated the engaging story line with the stunning musical numbers.
2375;Richard Gere is sensational as Billy Flynn.
2376;He departs from his usual style to deliver a brilliant performance and he manages to belt out two of the greatest songs in the film like no one else could.
2377;Catherine Zeta Jones is sexy and magnificent as Velma Kelly, and Renee Zellweger in stunning and seductive as the idealistic Roxie Hart.
2378;I recommend this film for anyone who is a fan of great musicals, great movies, great directing, and great acting.
2379;"Winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture, ""Chicago"" scores!"
2380;"film transition for Fosse's ""Chicago"" has been many years in the making, but it was definitely worth the wait."
2381;it's interesting to me that while I don't particularily care for Catherine Zeta.
2382;jones OR Rene Zelleweger, I think they were both fantastic in their roles in this film, as was Richard Gere.
2383;While they're not going to win any Grammy's for best vocalists, they all did very well.
2384;saw it twice) and/or enjoys a movie/musical, this film is a must.
2385;This is an exceptional adaptation of one of the most forward.
2386;thinkning Broadway musicals of it's day.
2387;A lot of the Bob Fosse choreagraphy is intact, as well as a unique vision of the complex storyline (placing it within the furtile imagination of Roxie Hart) to explain the staged direction of the play.
2388;Exceptional work by Rob Marshall and the team at Miramax to bring this dream production to fruition.
2389;A lot more than I can say for some of the slanted political views of the reviewer from Charlotte.
2390;Definitely would recommend to others.
2391;I love Chicago!This movie is so great after a break up!
2392;I just love the characters, the actors/actresses that play them and the story line.
2393;This is a fun and emotional musical that I just cant help but smile and sing to.
2394;Everytime I get asked what my favorite movie is, this one is what comes to mind.
2395;In 1997, they revived Rodgers Hammerstein's Cinderella which aired on The Wonderful World of Disney on ABC and became a ratings success.
2396;Now that Storyline Entertainment has proven to be a worthy investment, the real test was to revive the musicals for the big screen.
2397;The musical has greatly lost its luster since the golden days of the 1930's.
2398;The highest grossing musical since 1975 was Grease, which opened in 1978, and the most successful musical in recent memory would have to be 2001's Moulin Rouge with a $57 million take.
2399;With that in mind, will Storyline Entertainment find success once again with their film adaptation of the Broadway favorite Chicago or will this be their first failure?The story of Chicago focuses on the lovely Roxie Hart who has huge dreams about becoming a star like her idol Velma Kelly.
2400;She is willing to do anything to obtain that dream which includes cheating on her husband with a guy who claims to have connection in the business.
2401;After her husband spills the beans, she is taken to jail where she learns that one can still become famous with the right angle and the right lawyer.
2402;The storyline for Chicago is fabulously well done.
2403;The musicals sequence strive from the imagination of Roxie Hart which allows the musical to be a musical without the song and dance sequences come off as tacky.
2404;the cast of Chicago is truly an Oscar worthy cast.
2405;The most fabulous thing about the cast was that each actor and actress did his or her own singing.
2406;The biggest surprise from the bunch is Richard Gere who plays the flashy lawyer, Billy Flinn.
2407;He really shines in numbers like Razzle Dazzle and All I Care About.
2408;zeta Jones, who is actually a Broadway veteran, really shows off her stuff with great style especially in the opening sequence of the film.
2409;Renee Zellweger is good but not great as the central character Roxie Hart.
2410;There could have been someone better then Zellweger to the play this role but she still does a decent job.
2411;She definitely has the right look for the role but it was her dancing and singing in the musical that were the big disappointments.
2412;Queen Latifah was a delightful surprise as Mama Morton.
2413;The remainder of the cast does a wonderful job at providing the perfect amount of background characters that you would expect from the Chicago backdrop.
2414;The songs are amazingly well done with best being Razzle Dazzle, Mister Cellophane, and the Cell Block Tango.
2415;There certainly could have been a better to take the role but Zellweger works fine, just not outstanding.
2416;The comeback of the movie musical may have been started by Moulin Rouge but Chicago continues the surge with full force.
2417;Chicago is one of the best movie musicals in recent memories and one the best films this year.
2418;Make it your priority to see this wonderfully delightful film.
2419;The advent of the stage musical was driven by a young American society seeking an English speaking opera which could combine the talents of American Jazz, the celebration of the American spirit, and provide a hopeful look at life.
2420;"The musical saw this through an enormous success of ""Hair""."
2421;"When ""Chicago"" opened it was met with mixed reviews, and did not really enjoy its deserved recognition until it's Broadway revival in the 1990's."
2422;Chicago takes a look atthe society that was overlooked in the early part of the century.
2423;the execution of the story with its fast paced attention to detail makes this a film.
2424;The way that the producers stayed true to the score makes this a surprise.
2425;This film is all about how our society is more interested in how the press makes killers into famous people.
2426;That is the core, and that is the idea everyone should remember.
2427;"Thanks ""Chicago"" for reminding us of that."
2428;One of the best, if not the best musical out there.
2429;"Every once in a while an unknown director comes along who serves notice of extraordinary talent, such as Orson Welles with ""Citizen Kane"" or Francis Ford Coppola with ""The Godfather."""
2430;"In a time when movie musicals are a nearly moribund art form, ""Chicago"" is one of the very few ever made that approaches the excitement and immediacy of a musical live on stage."
2431;jones, both perfect for a musical set in the Jazz Age.
2432;"They look like Clara Bow and Louise Brooks reborn, they sing wonderfully, they dance with elegance and panache, and they have more than enough sexiness and charisma to be proclaimed the ""It Girls"" for this generation."
2433;"Coming less than a decade after the O. j. Simpson trial and in the midst of the ""Reality TV"" craze, this smart, funny, scaldingly cynical film has much of importance to say about the vicious triviality of American celebrity culture."
2434;"and that is, admittedly, very hard.you will note the abundant excellence of Queen Latifah, as venal jailhouse matron ""Mama"" Morton, and John C. Reilly."
2435;perhaps this generation's finest character actor, and with an unexpectedly lovely singing voice.
2436;But whereas Gere is very good and memorable, the others.
2437;The two women compete for headlines, trial dates, public sympathy, and all the stardom that their crimes can get them, desperately trying to stay one step ahead of each other and of the public's taste for the latest spilt blood.
2438;"director Rob Marshall and screenwriter Bill Condon have successfully adapted Bob Fosse's popular musical ""Chicago"" for the screen."
2439;Dion Beebe's cinematography is creative and impressive.
2440;But the performances are good.
2441;Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere cope admirably with the challenge of singing and dancing in a musical.
2442;jones gives a standout performance.
2443;She unabashedly plays her character over.
2444;top, belts out every song with great conviction, and really sells her performance.
2445;Another impressive performance comes from Queen Latifah, who plays the women's prison warden, Mama.
2446;jones and Queen Latifah both have considerable stage experience, as well as being blessed with screen presence, which might explain their ability to bring great energy and a larger.
2447;If you're a fan of musicals, Chicago is a must.
2448;"But I think there is enough entertainment in ""Chicago"" to please most movie goers."
2449;With better acting, singing and directing (I hated the eratic direction of the Moulin Rouge director), it's understandable why this movie won 6 Oscars and Moulin Rouge a couple.
2450;This is THE best picture in years.
2451;The songs are great and the lyrics stick in your head.you'll be singing for days!
2452;the story is strong and intetesting enough to enjoy even with the singing!
2453;I thought this movie was excellent.
2454;The acting by all the characters is superb and I would recommend it highly.
2455;Along with The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, this is by far the best picture of the year.
2456;When I first saw it, I immediately knew this would be the Oscar winner.
2457;And I enjoyed it just as much the second and third time.
2458;I thought everyone associated with this movie did an outstanding job.
2459;The true spirit of the musical is intact in this film.
2460;Roxie slips into her fantasy with Funny Honey.
2461;Enter into the mix, the great murder attorney Billy Flynn.
2462;billy decides to take on Roxie as a client but first, he must make her into a the a sympathetic character.
2463;Roxie and all the reporters are just marionettes with Billy pulling the strings.
2464;this film is great on many levels.
2465;As a screen adaptation of a musical, it is true to the source material.
2466;And as a movie, it is just plain fun.
2467;rob Marshall has a vast background in musical theatre and it shows that he understands that form.
2468;He has gathered a high caliber cast and crew that all perform to perfection.
2469;what many feel was the great find was Catherine Zeta Jones.
2470;But a lot of this is due to Marshall.
2471;She captures that fine line between innocence and conniving murderess.
2472;He actually took tap lessons and performs all his own dancing.
2473;This will give you maximum enjoyment of what is one of the great musical numbers that didn't make the film.
2474;This is very good featurette that has lots of insights into the making of the film.
2475;"2002's ""Chicago"" helped to bring about the increased popularity in the Musical genre."
2476;Not only did the movie bring in a staggering $170+ million at the box office, but the film ultimately garnered a Best Picture Oscar as well as a Best Supporting Actress award for Catherine Zeta.
2477;Chicago has been a Broadway hit for a number of years and I have to admit I wasn't sure how the movie was going to turn out.
2478;Each member of the cast shines with his and/or her talent and enthusiasm, especially Catherine Zeta.
2479;Each actress has her own unique background (Catherine Zeta.
2480;Both were nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar with Zeta.
2481;jones eventually winning the honor.
2482;Each routine was packed with energy and excitement including one notable number by Zellweger and Gere where Roxie was portrayed as a puppet during Flynn's ventriloquist act.
2483;Its blend of music, drama and 1920's lifestyle makes it easy to see why this film was considered the best movie of the year.
2484;This movie had every right to the best oscar award when it won it in 2003.
2485;jones overpowered in this to prove her magnificent voice, and Gere was surprising good as well.
2486;Rouge was a horrible movie with weak acting, while Chicago was the easily the best musical in the last couple decades.
2487;It played for three years in Broadway and had a huge comeback during the nineties after the controversial O J Simpson case and it is still playing.
2488;"this 2002 movie, by by Rob Marshall and Martin Richards, masterfully arranges a complex setting which constantly changes from the Chicago's Cook County Jail to the Club where the musical numbers are performed
2489;But unlike Cabaret, the glitz and glamour make it a superb production.
2490;I am a huge theatre fan and am absolutely thrilled at the idea that the movie musical is making a comeback.
2491;The direction and editing are great, the music video feel is wonderful given today's audience penchant for this.
2492;Having performed on stage in the role of Hunyak I have a special place in my heart for this show.
2493;dazzle of the movie itself.
2494;it's a movie I believe worth owning.
2495;there are those who can sing and dance and there are those who can't and this movie proves that.
2496;Adapted from the successfully revived hit musical that has been doing the rounds on Broadway and London's West End, Chicago is the cinematic directorial debut of stage director and choreographer Rob Marshall.
2497;That is until Roxie starts to steal her thunder.
2498;hollywood has a long established tradition of making musical movies, indeed the first Oscars best picture winner of the sound era, in 1929, was The Broadway Melody.
2499;Until the 1970's when musicals became strangely unfashionable musicals continued to pick up those famous golden statuettes regularly, with the likes of Gigi, West Side Story, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music picking up Best Picture Oscars between 1959 and 1965.
2500;It also won three major Golden Globe Awards, Best Picture and Best Actor and Actress in a musical or comedy for its stars, Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger.
2501;with all the Golden Globes and Oscar hype you might expect that the movie adaptation of Chicago would be something special.
2502;Don't get me wrong, Chicago is a good movie, an enjoyable movie and an entertaining movie.
2503;It boasts some decent performances too, particularly from the likes of Catherine Zeta Jones and the formidable presence that is Queen Latifah.
2504;Richard Gere has some nice moments too and is appropriately slick as lawyer Billy Flynn, manipulating the media and tap dancing his way out of many a tight spot.
2505;He has one of the best numbers in the whole show (Razzle Dazzle) and with his background of stage musicals, earlier in his career, was perfectly cast.
2506;Undoubtedly she gives a good performance and is a likeable heroine but next to the likes of Catherine Zeta Jones her lack of a musical background is evident.
2507;Love it or loathe it Moulin Rouge was surely a far more original, innovative and technically more impressive film than the rather formulaic staginess of Chicago.
2508;in summary, if you are a fan of stage musicals and cant afford to get to Broadway or London's West End then this is certainly worth the price of a movie ticket and far cheaper too.
2509;It boasts a great cast that you'll certainly never see on stage together but you'll miss out on that unique live experience.
2510;The choice is yours and in the words of Amos Hart `thanks for listening'.
2511;The performances by all the cast are wonderful and the songs are well done by all!
2512;As for the rest of the movie, it's simply scrumptious.
2513;The dance numbers, especially """"All That Jazz"""" and """"Cell Block Tango"""" are incredible."""
2514;Costumes are lush and gorgeous.
2515;In today's age, the lesson rings true.
2516;The singing, dancing, and acting by everyone in this production was amazing and shows just how flexible actors can be.
2517;My favorite performance was by Catherine Zeta.
2518;She absolutely [was great] and she definitely deserved the Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards.
2519;Rob Marshall did an excellent job of adapting this show for the screen by having the musical numbers exist only in Roxie Hart's mind.
2520;It deserved every award it got and deserved even more awards at the Oscars.
2521;Frist of all I don't think musicals should hit the big screen, I gave three stars for Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta Jones, Queen Latifah and Rence Zellweger for taking the parts and doing the best they could , good Effort.
2522;Some say it is great.
2523;i think there are people that hate musicals, and then they write a review about a great musical and slash it to pieces.
2524;I am my best musical critic, for me, because I really KNOW musicals!
2525;the verdict is: Chicago is Fabulous!
2526;It is right up there with the best of them.
2527;The songs are great, catchy, really excellent.
2528;The dancing is great, the singing is great, the coreography is beautiful.
2529;Catherine Zeta Jones won an Oscar for her role, and Richard Gere deserved to win an Oscar for his role (but he wins a long applause, from me.)
2530;He actually SINGS his own songs.
2531;He is PERFECT for the part.
2532;not just dances, she transcends into Jazz!
2533;I was hooked on the music of Chicago for weeks.
2534;i love the tunes, the coreography.
2535;This is really a bargain.
2536;You only pay for it once, and you will have it and be able to see it many times and enjoy it for the rest of your life.
2537;I have watched it many times, and each time I like it more.
2538;I know I will enjoy it many times more.
2539;Loved Queen Latifa as the warden.
2540;Music is amazing abd unforgettable.
2541;Came fast and It was like new.
2542;This movie is really great!
2543;Renee Zellwegger and Catherine Zeta Jones are superb.
2544;It has become one of my favorites.
2545;Even though I cannnot sing or dance, I can still sing, dance and talk all the parts.
2546;The Men will certainly enjoy the scantily clad female prisoners!
2547;So, let the men drool while the women are fixated on Richard Gere's amazing dancing feet!
2548;'Chicago' was probably a great stage musical.
2549;Dancing was fine, the direction and effects were truly impressive, singing was good, songs were good.
2550;For those of you who wanted a sweet lovely musical, just try to find one.
2551;Chicago is a beautifully crafted musical satire of the Twenties, and it's full of energy, great singing and dancing by people you'd never think could sing and dance.
2552;j put a hard edge on her character and changed her speech patterns to add reality to the time and the place she was portraying, and she did it brilliantly.
2553;"Let's be glad we can now sing, dance, make fun of it, and laugh about it."""
2554;Flashy, glitzy, great singing and dancing make this a super entertaining movie.
2555;Costuming was sexy and imaginative.
2556;age numbers as metaphors for her predicament, plus solid acting make for a film any Roaring 20's buff would want to see.
2557;gere is sly and charming as usual.
2558;And Zeta Jones is a doll.
2559;She has everything I like about an actress.
2560;it's well done and everyone involved is plenty skilled, but only liking half the cast i don't watch it as much as other movies i own.
2561;on perfect and even Zelwegger with her bony body and funny bee.
2562;esque enough to please Broadway diehards and the art direction, wonderful.
2563;Deserving of its Oscar and box office successes!
2564;i loved it!The songs are awesome, the acting is awesome, everything is well done!Some people don't like it because most characters in the movie are evil and you feel no sympathy for them, but I still enjoyed it.
2565;The new special feature makes it worth the price however.
2566;I quite enjoyed this movie, but then again, I'm partial to musicals.
2567;The acting, dancing, singing, costumes are all fantastic.
2568;Find something better to watch, amazon has plenty of other stuff to entertain.
2569;Chicago is the Academy Award winning musical from 2002 that brought back the genre in elegant style.
2570;Enter the over confident lawyer (Richard Gere)who promises to make it all better.
2571;but was this really the Best Picture of 2002?!?!
2572;Absolutely hands down the best musical to date put to screen.
2573;Zellweger should have won the Oscar for this performance.
2574;It was so bold and unlike anything she has ever done and she pulled off successfully.
2575;jones defintely earned her acclaim as well as Queen Latifiah.
2576;High octane and guarantee to make you tap your feet and snap your fingers this film pure entertainment.
2577;"I love this film
2578;The dances (and creative input of them into the film) are unlike most musicals that I have ever seen.
2579;What really impressed me, however, was the singing.
2580;I loved the lights and the songs (especially the dummy scene) and I couldn't believe that I was singing along.
2581;This movie was so entertaining.
2582;talking lawyer and her tough.
2583;But not to worry, she hooks up with another celebrity.
2584;Some of the songs are excellent .
2585;there is some clever cross.
2586;cutting between plot events and cabaret acts, and we are spared the traditional, offensive boy.
2587;The gorgeous Richard Gere remains staunchly suited througout.
2588;This is definitely a movie for the ladies.
2589;One must have a wry sense of humor, the ability to laugh at oneself and one's culture, and the mental capacity to understand this is a SATIRE to simply LOVE this film.
2590;I find myself amused at the self.
2591;here's the thing: If you have a sense of humor, a sense of irony, and common sense.
2592;It is an absolute delight.
2593;ray when I obtained it).
2594;Ok, so I went to see Chicago with the highest expectations.
2595;Everyone was telling me that it was the best musical and that it was better than Moulin Rouge (which I love) so I was expecting something mind boggling.
2596;I thought it was entertaining and I simply LOVED the music, in fact I bought the soundtrack.
2597;I enjoyed the humor and satire and it was a feel good movie.
2598;Queen Latifah was hilarious and I love John C. Reilly.
2599;jones has this really rich, gorgeous voice and she just commands those dance numbers.
2600;Chicago certainly """"razzle dazzles"""" us with all the visual elements of Moulin Rouge (the bright lights and ostentatious, over."""
2601;top costumes) and showcases a very popular cast, but the thing is, Chicago the movie is more about SHOW than SUBSTANCE.
2602;Because Zellweger is a big name actress, fresh from her Oscar nomination in Bridgit Jones.
2603;Because this movie was all SHOW.
2604;in order to make our movie as popular as possible, let's gather up every big named actor we can think of.
2605;/Razzle dazzle 'em/And they'll make you a star!
2606;"So, yes, I was entertained by all the razzle"" and ""dazzle""."
2607;I liked the songs for the most part, yet I still came home dissapointed because, once again, it was all about show instead of substance.
2608;I haven't seen a cinematic musical so finely crafted and enjoyable since Singing in the Rain.
2609;Set in its namesake during a female murder spree, the costumes, sets, and atmosphere are right on target.
2610;The acting, singing, and dancing are so good chills will run down your spine.
2611;Queen Latifah and the remainder of the cast are equally up to the challenge, bringing Bob Fosse's musical to the screen in all its dark, glamorous glory.
2612;bottom line: Definitely, see it.
2613;Chicago, the movie, was done so well, it makes a fellow want to see the play .
2614;thank heavens for Chicago a film that has finally brought the Hollywood musical back into the public's imagination.
2615;after the fun but trashy Moulin Rouge,Chicago can proudly show that even in this cynical age a Hollywood studio can still produce a musical that can stand alonside such classics of the genre such as My Fair Lady and Caberet.
2616;stylish production,terrfic performances from actors singing in fine voice (even though Zeta.
2617;jones manages to steal the show)makes Chicago the film of 2003.
2618;And then I saw Moulin Rouge, and loved it.
2619;The director found a great way to bring the stage to the screen.
2620;The aesthetics in this film are incredible.
2621;The film is just beautiful.
2622;if you're into more intelligent, theatrical, aesthetically pleasing films, see Chicago!I am hoping, due to Chicago and Moulin Rouge's successes, more musicals will be released in the upcoming years.
2623;jones and she does an amazing job in this film.
2624;I was amazed at how good a voice she has not to mention her amazing dancing ability.
2625;John C. Reilly plays the biscuithead husband exceptionally well and Queen Latifah is really good as Big Mama, her solo scene in a gold lame dress brings new definition to the word: decollatage!
2626;A musical satire that pokes fun at and even exposes our need for celebrity and the lengths some people will go to to achieve it.
2627;I'd be afraid they would stab me in the back, but Rob Marshall creates a musical full of bright colors, great turns from the actors in both worlds, and provides a mirror into our celebrity obessesed culture that should hopefully have us thinking long after Velma and Roxie take their final bow.
2628;jones is fiery, funny and wonderful as Velma.
2629;I found myself waiting until she was back on screen.
2630;If you like musicals then you will love it.
2631;Chicago is actually very funny and will make you laugh.
2632;Women killers end up in jail and all want the top lawyer in town to represent them because he has never lost a case.
2633;Cue the female inmates competing with each other for fame and the lawyer.
2634;It is really done quite well, the acting is good and it is very funny.
2635;However I hate musicals but I still gave this one 4 stars because it is done well and is very funny at times.
2636;love it love it love it and play it over and over and sing and dance lOLOL
2637;I love musicals and this is one of my very favorites.
2638;Richard Gere does a sweet job singing,dancing and he's also easy on the eyes !
2639;"John C. Reilly's ""Cellophane Man"" was surprisingly entertaining."
2640;"Along with of course, Richard Gere's great ""puppet man"" scene."
2641;but Zellweger really steals the show.
2642;"jones with a real ""triple."
2643;"threat"" performance (like that of Zellweger) really helped put this movie over the top."
2644;The Duo's closing number is awesome.
2645;I'm a song and dance freak, with a music major.
2646;I'm also a Chicago freak.
2647;This production was awesome due to the amazingly powerful performances by Catherine Zeta.
2648;Love Chicago's 'colorful' past, to say the least, and love all local shots, and the down.
2649;people from all over the world have said that 'Chicago and Chicagoans are friendly and helpful and it's one of the most beautiful metropolises in the world.
2650;The movie has all the glitz and glamor with just enough murder and sleaze to make it an outstanding flick.
2651;I loved it so much when it was in the theaters, I went to see it six times.
2652;once with Bebe Neuwirth in the title role and once with Marilou Henner.
2653;Both actresses were terrific, but I honestly believe the movie is better than the stage version, and Zellweger and Zeta.
2654;Contrary to what one reviewer said, I found his voice to be perfect for this role.
2655;So Gere's NY nasal singing voice is perfect for this character.
2656;perfect voice is perfect for the role.
2657;I always loved this film.
2658;and this BD is the definitive version to own.
2659;This movie was so great, I believed I was dancing and singing in the movie!
2660;The score, the energy, and the clothes were outstanding.
2661;This is one of my favorite movies of all time because of the music, the effort the actors put into the movie, and the great detail in everything.
2662;This movie is an A. plus!
2663;This is one of the best and most entertaining movies produced in years!
2664;Richard Gere is their attorney and, remembering him for roles like An Officer and a Gentleman, American Gigolo, Pretty Woman and Internal Affairs, it was interesting to see him as a song and dance man.
2665;The Cell block and Press Conference numbers are outstanding, but so is the rest of the show.
2666;Deserves every Oscar it gets.
2667;"derogatory manner, by the way, because ""Chicago"" is show business from beginning to end and that's its very soul."
2668;"Instead, if ""Moulin Rouge"" bringing the musical genre back to the spotlight pleased you, this one is also definitely for your liking."
2669;Whereas the songs are full of color and splendor in good Broadway tradition, the rest is shown in bleak tones, suiting 1930's Chicago.
2670;It makes sense but it is also goofy in a way.
2671;jones is especially hot and on the spot as Velma Kelly, as her past as a professional dancer in London really shows.
2672;The star of this entertaining show is a terrific musical score.
2673;I was skeptical whether the stage production would translate well on to the big screen but the fast pace, coupled with better.
2674;expected singing and dancing by Jones and Zellwiger, makefor an entertaining 90 minutes.
2675;Chicago is definitely deserving of its nail.
2676;biter Best Picture Oscar win.
2677;Following close on the heels of pop musical spectacular Moulin Rouge, Chicago is probably the first really successful adaptation of a stage musical to the screen since the 1970s.
2678;It's a feast for the eyes and ears.
2679;jones, and Richard Gere, I had to contain my laughter.
2680;they pull it off so perfectly you never even notice.
2681;jones really shows off her dance background, but Zelwigger does a fine job and when Richard Gere began tap.
2682;Also utterly amazing are Queen Latifah, who belts and struts like nobody's business, and John C. Reilly, who shows the film's greatest emotional depth in his poignant rendition of Mr. Cellophane.
2683;"They're so perfect for their roles that I find I can't listen to the Broadway cast now
2684;the adaptation for the screen is exquisite.
2685;The recasting of all the songs as fantasy numbers acted out in Roxie's head works well, allowing them to toy with the script and also eliminating the slight oddity modern audiences would find in characters strolling down the street and bursting into song.
2686;This masterpiece has everything that defines 'Broadway Musical'.
2687;an absolute joy to wallow in.
2688;Fantastic music, production, acting, dance, sound, art design, photography, everything.
2689;the maturity of the cast is a testament to the care the makers took to reflect the snappy boards of yesteryear when music was half percussive precision, half soaring reeds and snappy brass.
2690;On the other hand, if you check out All That Jazz (1979 by Fosse who created the original 1970 Chicago stageplay) you will see dance and music reflected and even improved.
2691;and you can see the seeds of his genius.
2692;It is a great musical.
2693;I would recommend this product to anyone who likes watching musicals.
2694;The original play features nary an emotionally worthy character"
2695;Thus, all is fair in developing a fast.
2696;moving, mostly lightly sardonic look at three main characters.
2697;You're not going to waste any actual feelings for these characters, so you have a lot of space to revel in the brilliant sensuality of the dancing/singing character development.
2698;Hot damn, what a great movie!
2699;Chicago, an adaptation of the 1975 musical about a frisky murderess, is set in the 20's era of Jazz with all the Mafia overtones, the tabloid sensationalism, and the wonderful music of the era.
2700;jones, yeah, we figured they could probably lay the moves onto a good dance routine, but who knew Richard Gere could dance?
2701;He's usually oh so coooool, but here he shows an entirely new side, and it works.
2702;Oh baby, does it work.
2703;They all did their own singing and dancing, and it's terrific.
2704;All the acting is really good, and the plot is much better then other modern movie musicals (cough cough, Moulin Rouge).
2705;If you're a fan of the movie Cabaret then you'll love Chicago written by the same people (Kander and Ebb).
2706;Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) sees Velma on the vaudville stage and she is determined to become a star.
2707;In the duration of her stay at the Cook County Jail, Roxie manages to win the heart of lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who decides to help her win the case and get out of jail.
2708;As I said earlier, this is a dark comedy and it is made to question you.
2709;If you feel kind of confused at the end, whether you should feel happy or angry at them, it is perfectly fine.
2710;This comedy makes you think.
2711;If you enjoyed Cabaret and Moulin Rouge check out Chicago .
2712;The 1920's produced so much superb music in America.
2713;this movie shows what a wild time the 20s were.
2714;very well choreographed and great musical performances.
2715;it is a very funny movie.
2716;I definately enjoyed this movie.
2717;I haven't seen it on the stage so I don't have any comparison to that version but I thought this one was wonderful.
2718;The casting was wonderful and, while I had a bit of trouble seeing many of them in roles like that, I got drawn in quickly and ended up loving most of the performances.
2719;i'm probably a bit biased because I love musicals and I'm so hopeful for more to do well but I still think everything came out great.
2720;I've actually seen it twice now and I've liked it more each time.
2721;It seems to be doing quite well and hopefully that will keep up.
2722;The film, also distributed by Miramax, goes into wider release in January.
2723;I found myself laughing and clapping my hands spontaneously and excitedly.
2724;"This movie should be headlined: ""Dedicated to women everywhere!"
2725;Despite this, it is very much worth owning.
2726;hollywood has a notorious track record of butchering popular Broadway musicals when transferred to the silver screen.
2727;"What musical theatre fan doesn't cringe the atrocities of ""A Chorus Line,"" or, dare I say, ""Evita""?"
2728;i will spare you a synopsis of this film.
2729;"What I will say, though, is that ""Chicago""."
2730;is a brilliant satire of our modern.
2731;"day obsession with the proverbial ""media."
2732;While it may seem an old, tired satire, this film treats it with such freshness and relevance.
2733;rob Marshall's experience in New York theatre lends itself well to the film.
2734;"Almost all of the numbers take place onstage in a theatre somewhere in the recesses of Roxie's imagination, with the exception of ""All That Jazz"" (which appears as Velma's nightclub act) and another at the end of the film."
2735;Both work well in reality and fit with Marshall's concept.
2736;"While Zellweger is not the strongest singer/dancer (she had no prior vocal or dance experience before ""Chicago""), she acquits herself well enough."
2737;"jones' smoldering, sexy performance of ""All That Jazz"" and the energetic ""I Can't Do It Alone"" are two great highlights!"
2738;vamped role of reporter Mary Sunshine, a clever sob.
2739;Director Marshall made smart, if brief, use of five female performers in the roles of accused murderesses in the Cook County Jail.
2740;A most amusing feature is the French Language track with dialogue AND songs dubbed by French actors and singers.
2741;"The last time I've found this was with ""The Sound of Music."
2742;It is still a great addition to musical theatre lovers as well as those who simply enjoyed the film.
2743;Chicago is as good as Mulan Rouge but even better.
2744;The performances on that movie are amazing.
2745;Everyone seems to know what they are doing and enjoy doing it.
2746;Richard, Queen Latifah, Renee and Catherine, and the rest of the cast are wonderful.
2747;Many of my friends went to watch this movie in the cinemas and they told me it's good.
2748;To me, a good movie would be that it's still watchable and enjoyable years after it's released.
2749;The decision was a good one.
2750;jones was simply spectacular in her role as Velma.
2751;Her background in musical showed through.
2752;Her experience and her confidence oozed through and thus, her personality suited Velma to the dots and tees.
2753;Renee was also brilliant in her role as Roxie but one couldn't help noticing her cautiousness in doing the numbers.
2754;Richard Gere, Reilly, Queen Latifah were all excellent in their roles.
2755;The additional features let us have a better appreciation of the casts in their roles by tireless and countless rehearsals.
2756;Chicago was every bit a show.
2757;The Broadway show was an amazing classic!
2758;This version preserves the score perfectly and visually creates the same atmosphere and emotion as the stage version using techniques unique to film.
2759;One of the few movies I have bothered watching more than once!
2760;This was my third viewing and I can definitely see myself watching it again in a few years.
2761;Hummed the songs for days afterwards!
2762;So many people had told me how wonderful this film was, and i will admit, i was curious to see exactly what all the fuss was about.
2763;And i have to say, i was highly impressed.
2764;the story is pretty simple.
2765;Roxy Hart dreams of becoming a star.
2766;Her way of handling difficult situations, is to transport herself, and those around her, into these elaborate musical numbers.
2767;The actors more then shine in their respective roles.
2768;Here she makes the character of Roxy her own, and lights up the screen.
2769;In fact, the casting is just about perfect.
2770;with each person giving an incredible performance.
2771;Chicago is one of those extremely rare films, that's hard to find anything to complain about.
2772;Everything from the costumes, lighting and direction go together beautifully, and you feel as if you're transported into their world.
2773;and it manages to do what i didn't think was possible.
2774;bring the classic movie musical back to life.
2775;In 2002, Chicago became the first musical to win the Best Picture Oscar since Oliver in 1968.
2776;Richard Gere is a very stiff in the musical numbers, but he brings the right amount swarm to his lawyer character.
2777;Director Rob Marshall invokes a style of a Broadway play with the set designs and director.
2778;He perfectly captures the essence of the original show.
2779;It continues to be one of the best.
2780;Someone made a FABULOUS movie musical!
2781;A movie musical that actually gives you the same leaving.
2782;I love the Broadway version of CHICAGO and was so incredibly pleasantly suprised when I went to see the movie (with some theater friends) and ADORED it (so did the theater friends!)
2783;The raw, palpitating energy is phenomenal.
2784;bravo!Renee Zellweger CAN sing AND dance!
2785;Her singing voice is lovely.
2786;Her dancing matches Catherine Zeta.
2787;jones' and her acting is superb.
2788;Her Roxie is reminiscent of Marylin Monroe, but it is very effective.
2789;jones is sexy as usual.
2790;And we knew she could sing and dance, because, well, that's how she got her start.
2791;It is cool to see her finally get to use it on screen.
2792;I was very happy with his tap dancing.
2793;And Queen Latifah is really a kick.
2794;Go see it, and see it in theaters.
2795;"And lets all thank the producers of ""Moulin Rouge"" for bringing back musicals."
2796;it was worth watching Nicole Kidman try to sing for the reward Hollywood has reaped with this absolutely perfect CHICAGO.
2797;It a wonderful movie and the the music is so entertaining.
2798;Zeta Jones performance is great.
2799;No wonder this film has won 6 Oscars.
2800;Its a best family movie too.
2801;great movie, singing and acting.
2802;I liked the puppet number.
2803;In prison, she hooks up with lawyer Billy Flynn, and another singer in prison, Velma Kelly.
2804;Before she knows it, Roxie is more famous then she ever dreamed she'd become.
2805;Intersped with musical numbers that help tell the story, Chicago is a satire about the control the media holds over it's audience.
2806;if you're a fan of musicals, or even if you're not, you will truly enjoy the musical numbers in Chicago.
2807;They have a twenties theme and are worked very well into the context of the story.
2808;The performances are outstanding, with my personal favorite being Richard Gere as Flynn.
2809;This was definitely an underated performance.
2810;minute musical number with Queen Latifah and Catherine Zeta.
2811;overall, Chicago is a wonderful cinematic experience, with only a few flaws.
2812;I love the actors and the music.
2813;It is so worth the money and I would recommend it to a friend :)
2814;Reviving the musical with a bang, Chicago brings back the fun of the all but lost genre.
2815;The cast is great in their showy performances, especially John C. Reilly in an Oscar nominated supporting role as Roxie's (Renee Zellewager) husband (Reilly though, in my opinion, is the only one really worthy of the golden statue).
2816;It is a nice departure from the usual, and fits the film's jazz era.
2817;chicago is a great film for repeat viewing.
2818;It's fun, well made and well worth at least one theater experience.
2819;jones is the best thing going for this movie.
2820;Okay, first and foremost I love this movie.
2821;you can expect to be blown away by the film and it's talent.
2822;While ruined by the boy next to me in French who can't seem to stop singing the songs, Chicago is a great movie with excellent songs and dancing.
2823;A little too racy for the kids, this makes a great party movie.
2824;As I heard the results from the Academy Awards, that Chicago had received 6 awards, I simply knew that it would be the best movie of the year.
2825;i was expecting something spectacular.
2826;The dancing is incredible, especially the Cell Block Tango.
2827;It's dazzling and should keep you hooked.
2828;I saw the stage version years ago and the movie compares wonderfully (although the movie eliminated one song.
2829;Thoroughly enjoyable and I highly recommend it!
2830;I had heard it was so good and won such and such awards, so I figured what the hey.
2831;I thought the actual story was very good, but the music was terrible!
2832;Lose the music and maybe we'll talk.
2833;Once I adjusted my perceptions, I found this a very enjoyable movie.
2834;I had not thought of Richard Gere as a song and dance man but he did a very credible job.
2835;I don't want to short change the singers but I think the real greatness to the numbers comes from the choreography, the directing, the costumes, the music and how well the songs fit right into the story.
2836;Indeed, most of the songs amplified the story.
2837;But with the music, it is a great tale of manipulation of public opinion.
2838;This was a brilliant stage production, and the movie version was excellent.
2839;One of the best movies in my collection!
2840;but the movie itself is wonderful.
2841;An adaption of a the Broadway musical, director Rob Marshall blends together the straightforward adaptions of old, with the surreal, in.your.
2842;face production of Moulin Rouge!
2843;"The ""dream sequence"" technique allows the narrative to take place in real life yet still allow for exciting music numbers."
2844;the performances are similarly wonderful.
2845;jones, Renee Zellwegger, Queen Latifah, and even Richard Gere all sing and dance wonderfully.
2846;It's great to see actors who don't normally sing and dance be pushed to the edge of their talents.
2847;While there could have been a few improvements, it was overall a great production.
2848;Add that with Bill Fosse's old wonderful coreography and some excellent and creative set design, and Chicago makes a great movie.
2849;Still, Chicago is a wonderful movie that every musical lover should own.
2850;Cinematography, costumes, songs, actors .
2851;all incredible and transports you to the past.
2852;It is exciting, fun, and seductive.
2853;Even if you are not a musical person, I know that you will enjoy this!
2854;There is a reason it won Oscars!!!
2855;an amazing screen adaption of a stage show (and there's a number of bad film adaptations of theater shows out there).
2856;This highly sarcastic and visceral song was for me the highlight of the Broadway musical and to have taken it out took out some of my joy upon viewing.
2857;great job by Catherine Zeta.
2858;It is a great movie .
2859;but as far as greatest musicals of all time, come on.
2860;I am not a movie critic, but I believe that a movie needs a star for entertaining, another for a deeply developed theme, one more for artistic skills, a fourth for great performances, and a final for a great coordination of the parts.
2861;This five star movie will definitely keep you out of the day to day life, giving fun to the spectator.
2862;Based on a hard theme, where crime and corruption are the central focus of the scheme, the artistic development of the film transforms it into an exiting drama, where the performances got a great level of achievement.
2863;The women in the film, actresses, singers and dancers, were all simply extraordinary, and the climate created by the artistic directors was very delicate, and elaborated, making beautiful refferences to criminal attitudes and antisocial behaviors.
2864;about the direction, all I can say is that Rob Marshall did a great job, placing all the parts of the movie all so well together, and giving the movie a great and complex binding between the musical format and the screen.
2865;I loved this movie for years.
2866;The film gets better and more relevant as the years go by.
2867;the acting was great, and although it's a musical, the plot was exceptional.
2868;This is a must see.
2869;As musicals go this is not Singing in the Rain or South Pacific, but it does have heart, guts and good musical talent just as the latter musicals had even if not in the same context.
2870;I find myself rooting for the little murderesses and not because I want them to get away with their crimes but to admire their spunk, guile and tenacity.
2871;He's a vile but witty cad who exploits every trick in the book (as well as creating a few new ones) to defend the ladies.
2872;Couple that with the nearly flawless portrayals of the characters and their near perfect dance routines and I have to highly recommend this genuine musical.
2873;At the heart of these two characters are women who've come to believe that fame and wealth are the only goals worth attaining.
2874;fosse's urban cynicism oozes from these songs and dance numbers.
2875;Jones and Zellwegger are very good in their numbers.
2876;They truly put themselves into their roles and played their characters with gusto.
2877;was another treat fully in her character and sumptuous in her performance.
2878;She conveyed such ease with her character it was like watching a person in a long running series, fully confortable with her role after years of playing it.
2879;now, is this a great film musical?
2880;No, but it certainly is enjoyable and a far cry from what's been passing for musicals in recent years.
2881;On top of that it has a surprising cast in the lead players as well as support characters.
2882;He's a decent guy but also a loser in love with someone who most likely will never know love.
2883;See if it shakes your tree.
2884;"the plot is the less important thing in these kind of movies but ""Chicago"" has a witty, funny, and sexy plot that will get your attention."
2885;but let's be honest, we watch this movie for it's musical numbers and choreography.
2886;Much of the movie makes up of the actresses' lip singing (which can be seen very clearly) and wearing exotic costumes that make them look like whores.
2887;Anyone who views this film will spend two very entertaining hours, but I have to admit to a certain amounbt of disappointmnt, particularly as compared to the stage play.
2888;Many numbers are brilliant (the legal ventriloquism number for example), and the show remains extremely entertaining.
2889;This picture has a lot going for it.
2890;fred Ebb songs fit the cynical story perfectly, have stong melodies and sharp lyrics.
2891;I may have that opinion because I saw the original Broadway cast, and got spoiled.
2892;certainly, there's plenty to admire in Chicago.
2893;dance numbers are staged with verve and imagination.
2894;(The sound recording has marvelous presence, especially if you have the equipment to play back the DTS version.)
2895;You get one and a half superlative performances in the lead roles.
2896;renee Zellweger continually brings up a conflict for me: she's adorable, obviously talented .
2897;The big climactic scene when Zeta.
2898;jones and Zellweger perform a duet is the most electrifying thing of its kind I've ever seen.
2899;spirited that, even when it's impressive, you can't shake off the feeling that the drink has been spiked with something poisonous.
2900;mixes serious emotions with its flamboyant music and choreographic artistry, for instance.
2901;Chicago, for all its energy and compelling vitality, is monomaniacal .
2902;the cast is excellent but none of them have the style of a Gwen Verdon, BeBe Newith, Karen Ziemba or Chita but the cast does bring a fresh look that should attract non.
2903;(At least they had the good sense not to have Babs in the movie)The supporting cast is equally as great and Christine Beranski as Mary Sunshine is great!
2904;rounded and very talented actress.
2905;This movie should be a great hit for 2003 and with hopes of other new musicals to hit the screen.
2906;Make sure you do you homework before attempting another musical.
2907;You'll have fun and you'll be totally entertained and if you haven't seen the Broadway version this is a pretty good start.
2908;"forget this ""best film of the year"" nonsense, we're talking the best film I've seen in my 49 years."
2909;"right from the opening notes of the ""Overture,"" I was hooked."
2910;"it's impossible to single out a performer, or a number in this film, because it's one of two perfect films I've seen in my lifetime, the other being ""Cabaret,"" which shares the same pedigree."
2911;ok, if you guys love fosse's stuff, your gonna love this one!
2912;"i'm glad mr. marshall stayed ""true"" to bob."
2913;if i may use a term from the corp. if your looking for entertainment this is the one for you, if you like dancing.
2914;He Had It Coming is one of the best ensemble dance numbers EVER, and the lawyerly tap dance during the trial is brilliant.
2915;Best thing I've ever seen Zeta.
2916;jones and/or Zellweger do, and Gere was a surprise delight.
2917;if you like musicals and the snappiest of snappy dancing and dialogue, plus a sharp little bit of tough truth.
2918;telling, this show is for you!
2919;Chicago definitely deserved to sweep at the Oscars last year.
2920;I was especially happy it won Best Picture.
2921;This was one of my favorite movies of 2002.
2922;With the help of the slick, slimy Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), the women try to get out of jail and return to showbiz.
2923;though Renee Zellwieger was very good, I thought Catherine Zeta.
2924;jones did the best job in this movie.
2925;She's a trained dancer and singer, so with this film, she was completely in her element.
2926;She definitely deserved the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.
2927;The movie version is about a woman who kills her abusive husband, (who probably deserved it) and is put in jail and threatened execution and the night club that she sings with makes fun of her with music.
2928;bold, brash, full of energy, bright, pushy.
2929;life imitating art, then art returning the favor.
2930;we watch their passion, their ambitions, their failings and most of all the way everyone plays to the crowd.
2931;everyone knows the scheme is to present life enough like the real world to be believable yet unlike the real world in the ability to manipulate to prove a point.
2932;it involves us, it beguiles us with the similarity to real life, but like real life sometimes to play to the audience, to neglect the greater issues of life(what is guilt?)
2933;i liked the movie, music and dancing is very good, despite the fact that i like neither very much.
2934;worth the time and thoughtful analysis afterwards.
2935;but i distaste the passion without direction, the ambition without direction, the winning without justice, and the movie seems to reveal in it.
2936;This is the greatest musical I have ever seen.
2937;jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere and Queen Latifa are at their best.
2938;The music and dancing are superb.
2939;moulin rouge was a good movie, it was well made, used visual effects as way to get the audiences attention.
2940;oh yea, nice tracking shots.
2941;my mother can push a dolly as well as they did!
2942;musical films, Chicago (1927) and Roxie Hart (1943).
2943;"dimensional ""choreography"" for which Marshall deserves special credit."
2944;In all respects, this is a film with Snap!
2945;Here is pure entertainment, worthy of favorable comparison with Singin' in the Rain which remains, nonetheless, my favorite film musical.
2946;This is a fantastic movie to watch, the musical number in this movie areall Great.
2947;Chicago was something I was actually expecting something from.
2948;it just starts with the excellent musical and it goes on with the excellent movie.
2949;This Oscar winning musical, a caustic, cynical comment on how we celebrate people who do bad things, mirrors today's headlines.
2950;everything we hold dear to our hearts.
2951;As one reviewer put it so well, this is overproduction, which starts to grate on one's intelligence and taste.
2952;It's about time they made a really good musical film.
2953;The musical features included are a split view of their making and final performances with director and actor comments.
2954;In fact, I think it's the best film musical I've ever seen.
2955;one right after another, the spectacular dancing, the two gorgeous women.
2956;Although I've never been a fan of Richard Gere (I know women are), I thought he was terrific here, singing and dancing.
2957;I've liked most of her movies where she played dramatic roles.
2958;Song and dance were not her bag, but she was great and deserved a highest award for the accomplishment in this movie.
2959;"Her ""Roxie"" number and the finale duo were sensational."
2960;Then there is Catherine Zeta Jones who received and deserved an Academy Award for this movie.
2961;I'm truly surprised that anyone found fault with this movie.
2962;I wish I could give it more stars than five.
2963;A lot of good ingredients have gone into the making of this long.
2964;As a result, all the musical numbers in this piece .
2965;One has to admire the way in which screenwriter Bill Condon, working off the Fred Ebb/Bob Fosse original, is able to knit together these two disparate realms of action into a unified, seamless whole .
2966;The script has some fun parodying this aspect of tabloid obsession and madness, but the film feels so much like a live.
2967;"fired determined to distance us from the action, not so afraid of appearing ""old fashioned"" and ""square"" by actually allowing us to care about the characters."
2968;dance moments a bit and provide a few more scenes of straight drama, but certainly plenty of great musicals have done just that in the past (then again, they actually had books worth constructing a musical around).
2969;technically, the film is very impressive.
2970;The musical numbers have been mounted with a great deal of imagination, energy and technical expertise, although the editing occasionally intrudes into and thereby diminishes some of Fosse's brilliantly worked.
2971;Still, taken separately, each number stands as a mini story on its own, and the cutting does keep the energy level high in purely cinematic terms.
2972;The songs by Kander and Ebb, though not particularly melodic or catchy, do serve the material well, being both lyrically clever and relentlessly high.
2973;of the performers, Renee Zellweger steals the show as Roxie, conveying both the befuddled vulnerability and ruthless drive that define the character.
2974;"jones, looking for all the world like Natalie Wood in ""Gypsy,"" exudes a real slinky sexiness as Velma Kelly, the stop."
2975;Richard Gere pours on the smarmy charm as Billy Flynn, the lawyer who takes on Roxie's case .
2976;"and I sincerely wish the makers of ""Chicago"" all the luck and success in the world with their bold venture."
2977;I just happen to feel that a truly great musical has to offer more than just spectacular song.
2978;It has to provide heart, as well, and a story to make us care.
2979;Chicago gets the musical parts right for the most part.
2980;Chicago is my favorite movie of all, sharing the place with Moulin Rouge.
2981;The music is amazing, the performances are perfect, the plot is great, the dance numbers are absolutely wonderful, in summary it's PERFECT!!!!
2982;I looooooove all kinds of musicals, but I love this the most.
2983;And even if you don't like musicals, you will love this movie.
2984;Catherine, Ren e, Richard and Latifah, all give such wonderful performances.
2985;Catherine is a great singer and dancer, and Ren e too.
2986;I think this movie really deserves all the awards it has recieved, and the fact that it won 6 Oscars, including Best Supporting Actress for Catherine and of course Best Movie, proves it.
2987;If you haven't seen it, go and watch it, you can be sure you will love it, and if you don't you have a really big problem.
2988;Loved the film and loved it more on Blu.
2989;I absolutly loved this movie.
2990;I saw it with my sisters and I had a blast.
2991;I was very impressed with all the singing and dancing.
2992;The plot was funny and spicy.
2993;It had very interesting costumes, scenery, and dance moves.
2994;I reccomend it to anyone who loves a really funny musical movie.
2995;I've listened to it so many times, I know all the songs by heart.
2996;I was very impressed with everything in the movie.
2997;I hope it wins a lot of Oscars, it trully deserves them all!
2998;I really enjoyed this movie with it's many dance numbers, outstanding outifts, and great dialogue.
2999;"In prison she meets many women inmates in the ""Cell Block Tango"", one of the best scenes in the movie I think with the many dance movements, the great song, and the scenery and costumes."
3000;When Roxie stumbles upon Velma Kelly, she discovers that the warden of the jail, Mother Morton, played by Queen Latifah (my personal favorite character who was also the funniest I think), is tipping Velma for one of th best lawyers in Chicago.
3001;Roxie also happens to get in on the act and gets that lawyer, Billy Flynn, played by Richard Gere, on her case also.
3002;i personally liked this movie and found it very entertaining, very fun, and very theatrical.
3003;I don't usually like musicals, save for many West Side Story and a few others, but this movie was one of my favorite movies of 2002, if not my favorite.
3004;Well done interpretation of the musical on screen.
3005;Makes sense as you watch it.
3006;I was unsure how much I loved this movie until i came on here and read all the knucle.
3007;Chicago is a work of art.
3008;And not unlike most works of art, it is beyond the comprehension and enjoyment of most of simpletons among us.
3009;If Forest Gump is your idea of the way the world really works, then you will HATE Chicago.
3010;It is also brilliant and enjoyable beyond imagination.
3011;If you have a brain in your head and are unafraid to see the world and society and humanity for what they all really are.
3012;The music, the characters, and above all the songs .
3013;All of it are simply outstanding.
3014;ups can enjoy this type of film, and sadly, there are very few of those in are society today.
3015;For fans of the movie musical, and everyone else for that matter, this movie is a gift!
3016;Featuring most of the sensational Kander.
3017;And the performers really shine, most of all Renee Zellwegger, who is a brilliant choice to play Roxie Hart.
3018;"Concerned much more with fame and the spotlight than with the means it takes to gets there, this movie's heroines have more than a small chip on their shoulder
3019;You will find it hard not to applaud each and every number"
3020;stop and expertly arranged and performed.
3021;jones won her oscar for Chicago as Best supporting actress all the comments of her not wanting to really acknowledge Renee and giving her the cold shoulder.
3022;When I saw this movie I saw that yes Catherine could sing and act very well.
3023;She had no natural talent and charisma for dance.
3024;She wasnt just going through the motions she had talent,great rythm and stole the show.
3025;When she won her Oscar for cold mountain I said its about time!!
3026;This great actress has nowhere to go but straight to the top!!
3027;I will always look for her in new movies and remain a devoted fan!!!!!!
3028;jones looks superb and gives a sterling performance in her role as one half of a vaudeville act with her deceased sister (whom she killed because she caught her sleeping with her husband).
3029;Renee Zellweger is captivating as the young wannabe who aspires to be something like what Zeta.
3030;talking successful lawyer, to get out of jail.
3031;first, the score, the singing, the dancing are so good that I can watch each scene over and over and still feel the magic in it!
3032;Secondly, the acting of course, by each of the actors featured in the movie, is superb.
3033;Thirdly, the set production and the costumes were dazzling and so well.
3034;The acting is dramatic but each actor fits the role so perfectly that you hardly suspect they're acting.
3035;And the music is so well.
3036;composed and played, that anyone who watches this will want to dance to it.
3037;My daughter is barely 2 years old, and she loves this film like she loves the other film about dancing : Strictly Ballroom.
3038;When I walked into the theatre to see Chicago, I walked in with very high expectations.
3039;I have seen Chicago on Broadway, and I expected this movie to be as great as the musical on Broadway was.
3040;the singing and dancing abilities displayed by the stars of this film (Zeta.
3041;known actress in Hollywood, but after this performance I predict that she will be one of the actresses in highest demand.
3042;all in all myself being a huge fan of Broadway and musical films, I truly found this picture highly enjoyable and exhilarating.
3043;"I would recommend this to any fan of musicals (such as Moulin Rouge)
3044;I did enjoy how they incorporated the musical numbers in the movie.
3045;jones deserved her Oscar win, she did a fantastic job in this movie.
3046;Actually, I believe the movie deserved all the Oscars it won except Best Picture.
3047;The Oscar should have gone to either The Hours or The Pianist.
3048;is a much better film and should have won last year's Oscar for Best Picture with Nicole Kidman as Best Actress (luckily she received the much deserved award playing as Virginia Woolf in The Hours), but things don't always work how you want them to.
3049;Overall this is a good film and not your typical musical, but if you're really looking for that musical experience, Moulin Rouge!
3050;is what you should watch.
3051;I am so happy that musicals have made it back to the Hollywood spotlight.
3052;Chicago is a new musical classic from the 21st Century.
3053;The acting was superb, the music was great, and the songs were addictive.
3054;It is a very fast paced, sexy, vibrant outburst of crime and jazz in the 20s.
3055;Renee Zellweger played the sweet innocent Roxie Hart.
3056;Richard Gere plays another millionare, but this time he is a singing one.
3057;Jones who played the gruff and bold Velma Kelly.
3058;It all blended into a fantastic film.
3059;One of the best musicals ever.
3060;This was because the movies can produce such marvelous special effects.
3061;Catherine Zeta Jones, Renee Zetweiler, and Richard Geer did their own dancing and singing.
3062;They are beautiful, talented actors and held me spellbound throught the film.
3063;The music was also wonderful.
3064;The three people I went to see it with were equally impressed.
3065;Maybe this movie will encourage Hollywood to produce more musical, feel.
3066;No wonder why it won best picture at the oscars!
3067;This movie is at the top of my favorites list.
3068;jones blows you away in a nother one of her phenominal performances (best sup.
3069;actress oscar win) Queen Latifah shines (sup.
3070;actress nom) John C. Reilly is great as usual (best sup.
3071;actor nom) and Renee Zellwegger surprises you with her brilliant performance.
3072;It's one of the best.
3073;The story line sounds more interesting than it is, honestly!
3074;and I loved her in Bridget Jone's Diary and even Me, Myself, and Irene, so it's not like I'm asking for much.
3075;The tall, skinny, redhead was an amazing dancer.
3076;This is without a doubt the best movie I have seen all year.
3077;In fact, it is the best movie ever!
3078;Richard Gere perfectly plays the """"greasy."""
3079;But, shining above the rest in this film is Catherine Zeta.
3080;"Directed by Rob Marshall, ""Chicago"" ""razzle dazzles"" audiences with its cleverness and fantastic musical numbers."
3081;A fantastic movie with fantastic performances and some truly wonderful music I was so happy I went , Chicago for me became my favorite film of 2002.
3082;What an amazing masterpiece of filmmaking that you can't root for anyone on here, this movie is not good.
3083;Maybe two songs stand out and the rest cringe worthy.
3084;It's hard for people to get a handle on how much vavoom this movie has, how clever the adapatation is, how crafty the casting became.
3085;Renee Zellweger is a siamese cat of a discovery.
3086;jones busts her bustier good.
3087;It works just like the musical, maybe even better.
3088;The musical may have more oomph, more pent.
3089;But the movie has more purr.
3090;You just have to have moxie, and Zellweger, and this movie, has moxie to burn.
3091;This is a notable exception.
3092;The casting and performances are fabulous.
3093;This film is so good how can anybody give it a bad review the music is so awesome in my opinion one of the best scores written for a musical , and the direction is sublime , Catherine and Renee are fantastic and Richard Gere was born to play Billy Flynn , I love it and If you love musicals then you will too.
3094;I think this is a great story.
3095;The music is catchy and the story goes nicely unlike some musicals.
3096;I absolutely love this movie!
3097;I bought it as soon as I saw it.
3098;It has an interview with Chita Rivera, which I found interesting.
3099;I also recommend the book with all the lyrics and the script, as well as the history of the origins of the play.
3100;Elegantly, the seductiveness of the tango, the danger of murder and the cold hard edge of prison are combined to formulate a dynamic song and dance.
3101;actors perform all of the songs!
3102;Now this is customary for theatrical performances but very rare in Hollywood.
3103;These stars showed their versatility and looked great doing it.
3104;The Queen's Sarah Vaughn like vocals shine, and add a little flavor to the already all.
3105;gorgeous costumes, beautiful actors, excellent use of color and photography, coupled with an outstanding score and outstanding vocals make this movie a must see.
3106;This movie will be enjoyable for all ready to embrace the new face of theater or thespians ready for a new notch in their proscenium arch.
3107;So microwave some popcorn, kick back, try something new, and enjoy the flavor of theater nuveau.
3108;I like some of the songs and I like the musical number that they did at the end, but I just don't get what the big deal was.
3109;"i love the classic musicals like ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""West Side Story."""
3110;The classic musicals are much more superior to today's.
3111;I found this to be true when it came to Les Miserables.
3112;I really liked the movie but the Broadway play is much better.
3113;i hope Phantom of the Opera is great, but who knows?
3114;CHICAGO is a movie adaptation of the musical by the same name.
3115;"Hollywood has gambled in the last years by releasing two movie musicals (CHICAGO and MOULIN ROUGE) that will not ""work"" for every audience, but I can certainly say that it works for me!"
3116;CHICAGO is a fun movie to watch and listen to and contains a spectacular cast.
3117;She eventually meets up with other women who have been charged with the same crime, most notably Vella Kelly (Catherine Zeta.
3118;Roxie dreams of becoming a star on the stage and manages to hire the notorious Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) to be her defense attorney and to persuade the jury that she is innocent.
3119;the dialogue is witty and smart, and it was fun to watch all the signing and dancing.
3120;It is definately worth fighting the crowds to see CHICAGO this holiday season.
3121;It's like that whole movie has a beat to it, not just the music.
3122;"I saw the original play on Broadway
3123;Yes, I loved the play and could hardly wait for the movie .
3124;Do I love movie musicals .
3125;I never get tired of watching the great ones, and Chicago is right up there with the best.
3126;Renee Zellweger, of whom I am no fan, does an excellent job as Roxie Hart, and her singing voice is appropriate for a character who is not supposed to be exceptionally talented anyway.
3127;Richard Gere was completely robbed at the Academy Awards: His Billy Flynn is a sleazy, smarmy antihero for whom we cheer, and he does an excellent job with his singing and dancing, adopting a Jolson.
3128;esque singing style very appropriate to the time period.
3129;Queen Latifah proves quite an actress in the non.
3130;singing parts, and her solo number is a hoot.
3131;But the real reason to see Chicago is Catherine Zeta Jones.
3132;She is a real hoofer with a great voice to match!
3133;(I have started going back to see her past work, and I highly recommend her work in Entrapment with Sean Connery"
3134;Chicago, a film adaptation of the Broadway Musical by Fosse, is brilliantly brought to life in this production starring Rene Zellweger, Katherine Zeta.
3135;the musical, which is filmed brilliantly in opposing counter.
3136;"and dance numbers that narrate the story, is cleverly drawn together, blending musical fantasy with the fascinating story of these women's struggle for fame from inside the ""slammer."
3137;She puts Roxy in touch with Billy Flynn (Gere), top criminal lawyer in Chicago, and the man who is already representing Velma, to get her out.
3138;the music is sizzling, sultry, sexy, as are the costumes and the actors that work these numbers.
3139;One of the most impressive surprises in this film is that all of the actors sing and dance their own numbers.
3140;jones is dynamic, performing like a veteran of the Broadway stage with a confidence that equals her talent.
3141;She is beautiful in the role of Velma, and was perfectly cast.
3142;Zellweger and Gere also nail their numbers, bringing a vitality and a sexual tension to their characters that make this movie work as a musical.
3143;He brings a sensitivity and innocence to the performance that gives his character as much vitality as that of any of the larger roles in this film.
3144;running a little over an hour and a half, this is a fabulous film production of a legendary musical.
3145;It is sure to dazzle, entertain, an all that jazz.
3146;Some movies have all the luck and time their arrivals perfectly.
3147;lovers, two recent musicals have hit the jackpot.
3148;"2002's ""Chicago"" good timing may not have been as much of a surprise, but its combination of great music, good dance numbers, racy songs, and ultimately its cynical take on America's infatuation with fame are just plain irresistible."
3149;renee Zellweger plays the nave Mrs. Hart, and her performance is a lot of fun for fans of her other work.
3150;zellweger's dancing and singing are also a pleasant surprise .
3151;"But Amos, ""Mr. Cellophane,"" allows himself to be led by the nose for most of the movie, and Reilly's performance is pitch."
3152;"In a musical number for the ages, ""When You're Good to Mama,"" Latifah almost steals the entire show."
3153;This song is a masterpiece of double.
3154;entendre and attitude, and Latifah nails it perfectly.
3155;"mama turns Roxie on to ""the best criminal lawyer in Illinois,"" Billy Flynn (played by Richard Gere), a fast."
3156;but in a way this works because it reminds us that Gere is first and foremost and actor, not a Broadway hoofer, and it is refreshing to see Gere taking such a bold stab at such a challenging role.
3157;"mell musical with style and wit to spare, ""Chicago"" does not offer many surprises as far as plot or character development go ."
3158;everyone stays basically true to their nature .
3159;but the pleasures of watching this amazing cast perform this raunchy musical are exquisite.
3160;Chicago is the most upbeat, amazing spectecular movie of 2002.
3161;all three main actors give remarkable strong performances.
3162;And also Richard Gere as the showy professional lawyer Billy Flynn.
3163;All along with a hundred dancing singing extras who have a role of there own.
3164;the Music is the best!
3165;You will constanlty be singing one of the 14 major songs included in the film.
3166;The whole cast dances in there own little way it is amazing.
3167;"I have to say that even though ""Chicago"" is not at the exact same level as these two movies, it is good enough to leave a lasting impression."
3168;The music is very good and entertaining, the performances of Catherine Zetta.
3169;jones and Renee Zellweger are inspiring, and the story is interesting.
3170;the film starts by jumping right into the action, with amazing music .
3171;"what a great song is ""All that Jazz"" ."
3172;meanwhile, Roxie is acting on her dreams, and to get there she is sleeping with a man she believes has connections in the show business world and can help her become a star.
3173;enters Billy Flynn (Gere), the slick lawyer that has a reputation for being able to get anyone off the hook, no matter how gruesome the crime or how abundant the evidence.
3174;He is Roxie's last chance, so she has to engage in a competition with Velma to see which case he handles first.
3175;i was surprised when I learned that both Zellweger and Zetta.
3176;Congratulations to Rob Marshall and his team for a remarkable final product.
3177;Chicago is the film adoption of the Broadway musical, and Catherine Zeta Jones and Ren e Zellweger (looking more like a sheep than ever with a wooly.
3178;looking, and the dance numbers were quite sexual and provocative.
3179;still, this is a light.
3180;hearted glossy film with some great dance numbers and a few catchy tunes.
3181;I am not a huge fan of musicals but Chicago is definitely an exception and one of the best musicals I have ever seen.
3182;The art direction and choreography are excellent.
3183;They perfectly serve the story.
3184;All the singing sequences and regular parts are edited very cleverly and they switch back and forth at the right moments.
3185;"All of the actors and actresses impress with probably the best performances of their entire career
3186;I was so surprised when I saw this movie.
3187;But my outlook on this movie definitely changed.
3188;I loved every single minute of it!
3189;The cast was incredible, the songs were catchy, everything was great.
3190;I've already seen it twice and will probably end up seeing it again.
3191;When you watch this movie you will be smiling the whole time.
3192;jones and Renee Zellweger were performing on the screen and everyone watching had a huge grin on their face.
3193;If you see this film you will know what I mean!
3194;Give it a chance, even if you're not a big musical fan.
3195;Anyone who calls CHICAGO the best musical of all time doesn't know much about musicals, but I'm glad they enjoyed it.
3196;bright and what's amusing is watching them achieve their tacky dreams by attacking and double.
3197;When you look at the variety of musical subjects done on Broadway over the decades, it's pretty silly to call CHICAGO a new kind of musical .
3198;a shocking opening that is censored even today.
3199;the American musical stage has told all kinds of stories since then, some warmly sentimental, others .
3200;i was frankly surprised that CHICAGO was as successful as it was on the screen, since many people like Mr. Wahl feel musicals should always tell sweet, sentimental stories.
3201;i love the warm musicals like SOUND OF MUSIC, but there is also a place for some with a harder edge.
3202;This is the best picture I have ever seen in the last months.
3203;Great service and excellent product.
3204;I recommend this product to anyone.
3205;Both ladies end up in the Cook County Jail on murderess row, under the strong hand of Matron """"Mama"""" Morton (Queen Latifah)."""
3206;if you like musical theatre, you're going to love this.
3207;I have never found her very impressive as an actress, but she knocked my socks off here.
3208;Her singing and dancing are excellent, and her performance is charismatic (she steals the show).
3209;It is fun to watch Richard Gere sing and dance and he does a nice job of it.
3210;i would have loved to see him in the action more.
3211;All in all, a WOW of a movie and a good time to boot.
3212;The musuc score is fabulous.
3213;Costumes and cast AWESOME and I loved the music while they rolled the credits.
3214;It arrived in mint condition and played beautifully.
3215;The entire story came back to me in much more detail.
3216;I always pick up on new things never noticed before each time I view this movie.
3217;If you're a fan of musicals, or even if you're not so much, this one is much better than most.
3218;The story is easy to follow.
3219;This movie's great for a rainy day, and the songs are catchy :P I'm one for musicals, but this really didn't catch my eye, but I'll defiantly watch it again on a rainy day.
3220;"While some bitter one ruined this movies perfect ratings(notice the lack of links provided for feedback to the ""bitterone"" (smart)), this movie is by far, one of the greatest musicals ever to be transformed into a movie ever."
3221;It is a fun poke at the extremes to which some people will go for their five minutes of fame.
3222;Richard Gere's character and the courtroom scene are hilarious parodies of the American legal system.
3223;a good movie that could not possibly live up to the enormous hype.
3224;The music is great and the story is cute.
3225;I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes musicals.
3226;This is one of the best movie adaptations of a musical.
3227;I love how the action is mixed into the staged songs.
3228;jones is excellent and I thought that John C Reilly was unexpectedly phenomenal.
3229;they ended up loving it, too.
3230;Its no wonder that this movie won the Academy Award for Best Picture.
3231;The talent in this film is amazing.
3232;The dancing is incredible, the singing is just as amazing!
3233;star cast all deserved Oscars!
3234;If you enjoy musicals then you will enjoy the film.
3235;Some people might find the constant breaking out into song annoying, I actually enjoyed it.

3237;roxie's husband is still very much in love with Roxie despite her betrayal, and will do what he has to in order to get her out of jail and cover her legal fees which are not cheap.
3238;Roxie hopes it will help get her career started and Velma wants people to remember her while she is in jail.

3241;i was quite surprised at Richard's performance.
3242;I did not see him as the singing and dancing type, but he was actually quite good.
3243;Queen Latifah as """"Momma"""" was simply marvelous."""
3244;She runs a tight ship, but she actually cares for the inmates in her jail.
3245;If Queen selects the right roles, she has the making of a huge movie star.
3246;Their success is irrelevant to my enjoyment of this film.

3249;Zellweger does an excellent job all things considered.
3250;I especially enjoyed the way she gave that extra.
3251;jones was of course amazing.
3252;She's really a great dancer.
3253;I had fun watching her rehearse in the behind.
3254;considering the fact that I'm pretty much allergic to Richard Gere, it's saying a lot that I really liked this movie.
3255;I can see why it won the Oscar.
3256;It made a statement about our society, it provided touching drama with characters like poor Amos and Hunyak, and it entertained all at the same time.

3258;This is a beautifully done rendition of my by far favorite Fosse musical.
3259;It's commentary on media and the justice system is still relevant and the dancing is glorious.

3272;Director Rob Marshall really took a chance on the 32.
3273;She prepared for the role of Roxie Hart not only by watching well.
3274;Also astounding is Queen Latifah .
3275;inspiring aspect here is the man behind the iron curtain.
3276;Having co. directed the wildly successful 1998 revival of Cabaret, Marshall worked with then unknown director Sam Mendes (who won an Academy Award two years later for American Beauty) and gained a good amount of knowledge as to what it took to helm a production.
3277;A virtually unknown member of the entertainment community, he now has a chance of winning an Oscar for Best Director (much like Sam Mendes out.

3280;the choreography is definitely Fosse inspired, but manages to still be original and inventive.

3283;This is the best oscar nominated movie in the last few years.
3284;It is better than last years Moulin Rouge.

3287;"As far as ""great movie."
3288;"making"" goes, Moulin Rouge is much better than Chicago, IMHO."
3289;Moulin Rouge runs the gamut of emotions, and it really pushes the envelope a lot more than Chicago does.
3290;Chicago is pretty much just a big Bob Fosse tribute (which is fine.
3291;I learned a lot about the history of the source material on the Making Of Featurette, and I liked seeing the 'Class' number, which was cut from the feature release.

3297;Chicago was visually beautiful, well performed, and displayed some top.
3298;Moulan Rouge seemed superior to this movie in every way to the eyes of this layperson.
3299;ultimately, it was a movie I could respect, but not love.
3300;This is a great movie that is worth watching over and over again.
3301;It makes a wonderful addition to our collection.
3302;The film is quite good.
3303;The performances, while not my favorite, are solid, and the staging is very creative.

3313;"You will hear a lot of ""he/she was PERFECT"", ""He/she is astounding"" and ""he/she is a remarkable singer/dancer/actor""."
3314;But you will certainly know more than you ever expected to about this film and Broadway musical fans will love every minute of it.
3315;"The BD has a slew of ""extended musical numbers"" and a few ""rehearsals"" too."
3316;Because Director Rob Marshall often cut action into the musical numbers, we can now see them without interruption.
3317;Queen Latifah surprises (at least she surprised me) with a sexy number early on, too.
3318;great cast: John Reilly as a believable, downtrodden Amos Hall.
3319;jones is the sexiest of all dancing up a storm early on, then bringing down the house along with Zwelleger in a closing number that shines.
3320;It is truly the best film that I have seen in many, many years, and was a brilliant telling of a very classic story.
3321;The blend of musical numbers with acted scenes was pulled off remarkably in this movie, and the film version allowed for plays that would not have been accomplished on the stage.
3322;the vocal talents of actor Richard Gere and those of Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta.
3323;But it is Queen Latifah who really took the stage away in her brilliant portrayal of Matron 'Mama' Morton.
3324;We knew she had a brilliant voice, and we knew that she could act.
3325;We knew that she was gorgeous, but how she pulled this movie off is truly, truly outstanding.
3326;She brings it all together and it is her talent that glues the entire film together and makes it what it is.
3327;She is stunning and unbelievable in this role, and is to be commended for the great work which she did.
3328;Her fans will be thrilled with this movie, as will fans of the musical genre as a whole.
3329;this one is a 'must see!'
3330;This is pretty good entertainment.
3331;it's well put together, and has some catchy dialogue.
3332;and Catherine Zeta Jones, who CAN sing and dance(relatively) is one of the film's weaknesess.
3333;i mean, I never thought of Jones as anything special, and this movie proves it.
3334;now, I thought Latifah's singing was the best in the film.
3335;she also proved that big women can be sexy, and gave her cheesy chracter a somewhat new spin.
3336;i'm sure that the musical is better than this.
3337;I always enjoy this movie and am happy to own it now so I can watch it whenever the mood strikes!
3338;Great movie and it arrived weeks early.
3339;The cast was fantastic, and well cast for their parts.
3340;I loved the story line, and especially Richard Gere's part as a slippery lawyer!
3341;Definitely not a show for young folk due to the serious nature and glorification of murder.
3342;Best musical with great songs and dancing.
3343;Really gets you in the mood to dance and sing along.
3344;The story is so well done, and the characters are so well written.
3345;I especially loved the 'Razzle Dazzle' sequence.
3346;And best of all, this story is every bit as relevant today, as society has not changed in the slightest bit!
3347;the transfer itself is good, but it's a bit grainy.
3348;For a new movie, which likely has pristine digital sources for video, the transfer shouldn't be as grainy as it is.
3349;Despite that, the transfer was very well done.
3350;Also, a feature on the plays, Broadway show, and its eventual translation to the big screen, and an audio commentary round out disc 1.
3351;disc 2 contains lots of amazing bonuses.
3352;Extended musical performances, featurettes on the crew, a feature on when Liza Minelli played Roxie Hart, a feature on the cameo appearance by Chita Rivera, Broadway's original Velma Kelly, and VH1's Behind The Movie are included on here.
3353;My only real beef is the VH1 special.
3354;of documentary that also covered the Oscar wins, as the VH1 special was aired after the nominations were announced, but before the ceremony.
3355;I thought it was FABULOUS!
3356;its a very sexy, sassy musical revisited on film and is in every way a real treat to watch!
3357;We decided on Chicago and it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
3358;And fantasitcally at that) We watched the movie, but then we rewound it again and again to one musical number.
3359;Everyone sang and danced very well, which was a very pleasant surprise, compared to all the hype surrounding Nicole Kidman because she sang in Moulin Rouge.
3360;Because this movie is really something special.
3361;You're really going to be in for a treat if you go see this movie.
3362;Finally a great movie musical , After years of bad ones such as Evita and Moulin Rouge we finally got Chicago.
3363;Everything about the movie is perfection every little thing has been totally brushed up and the results are one of the finest cinematic musicals in history.
3364;By far the best musical movie since West Side Story this is a great film.
3365;Cellblock Tango is a hoot!
3366;Great show with a great cast!!
3367;"Catch it in live theatre for an added treat 
3368;Nonetheless, Chicago is a rollicking, foot.
3369;Velma Kelly is a veteran of the stage but is sparsely rewarded despite her dedication and talent.
3370;The two eventually collide when Roxie begins winning hearts (and the press) with her story while Velma must face the reality that she's yesterday's news.
3371;developed story with never boring characters this film is a must.
3372;One of the truly GREAT movies ever made.
3373;John C. Riley is perhaps the highlight of the whole film.
3374;Chicago roars with energy and verve, with nearly every scene exploding with attitude like a grenade.
3375;Hoping to beat the murder rap, they take sides with the town's most prestigious lawyer (a vibrant Richard Gere), and from there begins a storyline involving crime, greed, scandal, and the shameless pursuit of fame.
3376;But the film's revelation is Queen Latifah's supporting role as the prison's Matron Mama.
3377;jones, who tear up the screen at every musical number they perform.
3378;The voices are on point, and the choreography is breathtakingly alive.
3379;Chicago isn't going to make us forget about, say, """"West Side Story,"""" but it's good enough to give you a jolt of energy."""
3380;The way they translated this to the screen is ingenious, but at the same time they sanitized it, giving it a neon, pop.
3381;"Yes, I know it's a musical and it's supposed to be ""fun."""
3382;cutting, the camera stays inexplicably on the floor, tracking past heads in the audience that partially.
3383;"(Or, to quote part of Stuart Klawans' review for The Nation: ""[Rob Marshall] has shot it like one of those commercials for Broadway musicals, the ones that run on the late news in New York City."
3384;There *is* one brilliant show.
3385;Mrs. Michael Douglas is fine, and brings a nice voluptuousness to her role, but her accents tends to cut in and out.
3386;Richard Gere has the right charisma in the acting scenes, but he can't sing or dance, and his tap scene is well.
3387;reliable John C. Reilly sure can, and is probably the most satisfying actor in this whole movie.
3388;"if they ever make ""The Bessie Smith Story,"" she's a shoe."
3389;the songs are cute and occasionally catchy, but never memorable or original and never deep.
3390;And that pretty much sums up the whole movie.
3391;while still being racy and raunchy and fun.
3392;I think, much as I enjoyed seeing the squirming, scantily.
3393;There are also extras involving Chita Rivera and Liza Minelli that are mildly entertaining.
3394;"There's one deleted musical number, ""Class,"" that's quite good, but didn't fit into the way they staged the movie."
3395;most people will probably like this a lot.
3396;The songs and all were good, but that's about it for me.
3397;Loved it when it came out, love it even more now when I can press rewind and play the musical numbers again and again.
3398;This is unarguably the BEST motion picture of the year (hence the Oscar win) and in my opinion the best movie in ten years.
3399;jones is simply amazing and deserves every amount of praise she has received for her role as the sexy Velma Kelly.
3400;Rob Marshall brought his genius to this motion picture with the stage.
3401;"jones' best moment ""I Can't Do It Alone""."
3402;Chicago is what we call a real musical (with original songs and a solid 7 year run on Broadway with multiple Tony awards).
3403;"The camera moved so fast and was on such inappropriate angles for dancing that too much was lost
3404;Nicole Kidman is one of the greatest actresses of all time and was great in Moulin Rouge, but when it comes to musicals Catherine Zeta.
3405;jones SHINES!Chicago is wonderful and it earned every Oscar it won.
3406;Chicago saved the face of the musical movie by showing the world how a musical movie should be.
3407;Engaging, entertaining, thought provoking, and brilliantly performed, Chicago takes us on a satirical journey through a sick and twisted society.
3408;The casting is extraordinary, as every role is perfectly realized.
3409;Bob Fosse's genius is matched by Rob Marshall's contemporary vision for the contemporary movie musical.
3410;Pure entertainment in a polished package.
3411;On the positive side, I would say that this movie has excellent cinematography, very good costumes, some very catchy song dance numbers, and several good performances by the cast.
3412;I'll be very interested to see if Catherine Zeta.
3413;jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, and John C. Reilly will be singing again in future films, since they all did a more than adequate job of fulfilling the musical requirements of their respective roles.
3414;Thus, all things considered, I thought that the film very much succeeded in bringing this particular musical screenplay to life.
3415;on the other hand . . . well, I dunno.
3416;so, while there really are several good singing and/or dancing performances in this film, there's really not a lot that can be said for the underlying story.
3417;It's just a series of tunes strung together by a paper.
3418;Actually, yes, since I did enjoy seeing and hearing these actors display their considerable musical talents.
3419;best picture of the year?
3420;done, but much more satisfying, West Side Story .
3421;But maybe, like so many others, you'll really like it.
3422;One of the best musicals of all time.
3423;Rapid paced, great story line, great actors, fantastic scenery.
3424;I can't say enough about everything this musical has going for it!!!
3425;jones are , didn't care for Richard Gere's singing but thought Ms Z's husband was excellent great entertainment for the whole family .
3426;winning movie shows us a 1920's Chicago where booze and jazz fuel people's dreams and disappointments.
3427;After she retains the services of the genius criminal lawyer, Bill Flynn, it's showtime.
3428;i think this is very relevant to American society today.
3429;It's important to watch this to get a feel of where American society is going.
3430;getting back to the movie itself, it is just spectacular.
3431;It's perhaps one of the best musical movies ever produced.
3432;All of the actors give fine performances, and the songs and choreography are top notch.
3433;photographed and gives you the opportunity to replay certain favorite scenes.
3434;Some of it is blatantly outrageous!
3435;He doesn't like musicals but we enjoyed this one VERY MUCH!
3436;There are so many richly choreographed scenes and all the actors and dancers really give it their all.
3437;It has an all star cast, a great musical score, and a plot that is so far.
3438;fetched, it is nothing but a good time.
3439;The film is glitzy, colorful, and fast paced.
3440;One of the biggest hits of the West End Broadway hits the silver screen with a bang, yet this not just the stage show, this is pure genius.
3441;The ease with which this is done demonstrates an understated talent that can only be highlighted here.
3442;Indeed one can't help but feel that Marshall is the Billy Flynn we never see, as he razzle dazzles us and gives us our own """"show that is so spendiflorus."""
3443;Well like the strength of the cast it can't be faulted as each seems to meld their persona so well into their performance.
3444;Indeed the cast is solid throughout and the cameos by Mya and Lucy Lui are lovely.
3445;One could question the highness of Gere's tone but that aside the stand out performer is without a doubt Zellweger who is both stunning glamorous, yet vulnerable fragile which she can communicate through not only acting but also song thus displaying sheer brilliance on her part.
3446;A special mention should also be made of John C. Reily's Amos, never before has anyone captured Mr. Cellophane with such heart.
3447;If you leave this film without feeling higher than you when you came in check your pulse as this had me singing along to the Cell Block Tango and definitely had all that jazz!The VerdictIf the dance numbers that are both a combination of traditional Fosse and more contemporary styles don't impress you, the melding of story and musical into the narrative certainly will.
3448;Yes this is a musical but suspend your disbelief and let Chicago tempt you with the darkest story of treachery, betrayal and murder you'll ever see twisted into a song and dance show.
3449;What a great surprise it was that Chicago was not only good, but great!
3450;The visuals are stunning and flashy without being tacky and the singing talents of the entire cast is surprisingly top.
3451;With a quick pace and a wonderful collection of mostly egocentric characters, Chicago is a can't miss example of what musicals are all about.
3452;Fantastic is the word to describe this fantastic musical.
3453;Everything is perfect and nothing is out of place.
3454;Catherine Zeta Jones and Renee Zellweger are superb as the two murdering girls in prison for murder as is Richard Gere.
3455;Chicago is fantastic it is a must see , it is by far the best musical since Cabaret.
3456;After 11 years it still holds up as being fun To see.
3457;The acting is great .
3458;The songs and dancing are lively
3459;This movie has to be one of the best movies to have come out in a long time.
3460;The performances are superb and the sets and costuming lends a larger than life feel that leaves you wishing you were on Broadway to be a part of a production like this.
3461;Love this show and finally my daughter is old enough to watch it with me.
3462;Choreography, cinematography, casting, story line all blend to make this movie a pleasure to watch.
3463;This is a spectacular film adaptation of the famous musical bearing the same name.
3464;Among the cast you can see a spectacular cast of Catherine Zeta.
3465;jones, Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger, bringing before you the show business on stage and in real life.
3466;The movie weaved all the song and dance numbers tightly together creating a mysterious but fantastic world of Jazz and dance, life and death, glamour and darkness.
3467;Renee Zellweger as Roxie, who lives between her own fantasy world of stage and struggle in her real life, finally learn the trick of survival in a greater stage performance brought to her by her ruthless and daring lawyer Richard Gere.
3468;The performance of the cast is fabulous and the tap dance of Richard Gere should be a part that should not be missed.
3469;Chicago is a movie full of actions (in terms of dancing) and entertainment that could get you moving your feet along with it in the theatre.
3470;Director Rob Marshall imaginatively uses the film techniques at his disposal to keep the audience engaged thru the fast pace and switches between reality and Roxie's fantasies.
3471;The story is set in the dance halls and theaters of the Roaring Twenties, and involves love, murder and an examination of the difference between notoriety and fame and the fleeting nature of success.
3472;grabbing nature of their crimes of passion, Velma's fame, and the press sensationalism of the time.
3473;Queen Latifah utilizes her talents to the fullest and is wonderful as the manipulative prison matron.
3474;John C. Reilly does a superb job as Amos, Roxie's faithful and loving husband who is not the brightest star in the sky.
3475;"(His musical routine as ""the Cellophane Man"" is captivating.)"
3476;But remember that this is a big stage musical on the screen, not a complicated plot or a moving and emotional drama.
3477;The story is only a vehicle for the incredible music and the marvelous dance routines of Bob Fosse, and totally succeeds in that attempt.
3478;So go to enjoy an hour and forty.
3479;five minutes of action and fun and to see the wonderful performances of the cast.
3480;It is a good movie.
3481;"That's what CHICAGO has done with many of the critics and the Hollywood establishment
3482;seeing that this is a musical, the acting is top.
3483;notch because it also involves a ton of singing and dancing as well.
3484;jones are getting a lot of press, but the real stars of the show are the two major male performers: Richard Gere and John C. Reilly.
3485;Gere has a solo tap dance number that is most impressive.
3486;Reilly plays the only character who is likeable and normal and his solo song """"Cellophane Man"""" is a performance of classic showmanship."""
3487;I've routed for the criminal before (e. g. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN), but the criminals were always likeable people who made a change of character.
3488;"This movie is an EXCEPTIONAL piece of art
3489;talented actors if you can catch it, some sarcastic humor artistic vision metaphor!!
3490;in the audience is fresh.
3491;paced, intelligent, wryly humorous on.
3492;She's beautifully lethal, charming, and full of class, charisma hard work.
3493;Renee Zellweger, on the other hand had never sung or danced before, yet she plays with the best and DEFINITELY holds her own.
3494;She is VERY talented its almost more endearing that this was her 1st venture into a musical.
3495;richard Gere has never been one of my favorites but I now really respect and admire him, he is also full of talent and surprises.
3496;Queen Latifah hits the screen and you know she's serious, seriously funny talented!
3497;It deserved every acclaim it got.
3498;enjoy it while it lasts cuz in 50 years or so it'll change, you know.
3499;What words can I find to describe this musical.
3500;How about stunning, spectacular, electrifying, dazzling, etc. etc.?!?
3501;This movie is so well.
3502;Chicago thoroughly deserves all its honor and recognition.
3503;No matter how many times you watch it, you will still be thrilled by it.
3504;Chicago is a truly great film and one that should definitely be seen by everyone at least once.
3505;They are all good voices, mind you, they just run out of room quickly (QueenL of course rocks).
3506;juxtaposing tragedy, and a song about tragedy, in a wildly entertaining performance is a very cool trippy idea.
3507;I waited ten years to see ANYONE do this musical, on stage or screen, and I was not disappointed in the least.
3508;'s gorgeous but unnoticed film version of Evita and the more recent, painfully abyssmal Moulin Rouge, CHICAGO finally hits home with audiences and critics alike, I will join those who pray this will bring back the movie.
3509;the film is perfectly cast, and one can tell each member had an absolute blast in making the film.
3510;And each is so SURPRISINGLY amazing in the songs, I had to check and see if the voices were dubbed by professional singers.
3511;so, for an amazing time, go see CHICAGO.
3512;After seeing Lord of the Rings again, of course.
3513;Chicago is an absolutely wonderful show.
3514;for those who are not easily offended and who don't mind entering the fantastic world of theatre.
3515;Chicago demonstrated a common theme in dramatic plays.
3516;topped off with wonderful choreography and excellent music.
3517;It was both entertaining and fullfilling.
3518;line filled with murderous women and the sleezy lawyers who help set them free (I loved the FICTIONAL story), then for the passion of the music and dance.
3519;Dancers of all styles will enjoy the movement of bodies across the floor, making you want to tap and jazz across the room yourself.
3520;This was an amazing movie.
3521;Chicago was simply wonderful and I suggest that everyone see it.
3522;The music was great and the dancing was great.
3523;The choreogrophy I think was by Bob Fosse and it was amazing.
3524;It is also amazing that all the actors do their own dancing.
3525;Richard Gere is an excellent tap dancer!Billy Flynn: That's Chicago.
3526;As good as this film was, who would have known this film would win 6 Academies including best picture?
3527;Catherine did very well at singing and dancing, earning best supporting actress.
3528;Renee did her best and impressed me with her skills.
3529;Richard gere was good but his singing was so.
3530;The whole film made up for that so he was forgivable.
3531;The songs were amazing including the cell block tango and """"I cant do it alone""""."""
3532;That's why Chicago is a pleasant surprise.
3533;Director Rob Marshall in collaboration with the other performers/artists involved with the film, has turned in one of the best movie musicals since the heyday of wunderkind Bob Fosse.
3534;based on the Kander Ebb musical directed by maverick choregraphy Bob Fosse, Chicago manages to capture Fosse's spirit and make the transition from stage musical to film.
3535;That's a rarity since the death of the film musical.
3536;"Rob Marshall manages to translate CHicago from one medium to another because he understands both and doesn't undercut the strengths of either medium
3537;although Marshall's choregrapher owes a great debt to Fosse's original work, it's uniquely his own.
3538;What's most surprising is that Marshall isn't afraid to tweak and play with the most successful elements from his stage version for the film.
3539;Marshall keeps the original story intact.
3540;Thrown together due to their circumstances, Zellweger and Zeta.
3541;They both want the same goal but it's clear that they both will do anything to reach their goals.
3542;The fact that the media rewards them with sympathetic portrayals in the paper due to their money hungry lawyer (Richard Gere)makes this trip down the dark side even more interesting.
3543;While neither one has great voices, they are appropriate to the material.
3544;Yes, they play amoral characters and, yes, none of the characters really have any socially redeeming values but they represent the very qualities that this cynical but witty look at media manipulation is all about.
3545;richard Gere is especially noteworthy.
3546;I'm not surprised that Gere's performance is so strong given his background in Broadway musical performances.
3547;What is surprising is that he'd take such a risky (but colorful) role so late in his career.
3548;John C. O'Riley is a bit of a surprise.
3549;He acquits himself quite well in a memorable musical number.
3550;O'Riley plays Roxie's dimwitted husband with a heart of gold.
3551;He's the only decent person in the whole film and the one everyone twists around for their own unjust cause.
3552;the Kanter Ebb songs are great.
3553;Fred Ebb's lyrics are witty and among the best he had written.
3554;Kanter's music is also a highlight.
3555;The behind the scenes featurette isn't anything special but does provide some insight into the challenges of translating a successful musical from one medium to another.
3556;Although I've always been a fan of widescreen, the standard full screen version is nicely done as well.
3557;life talent, and this exuberant adaptation of his Seventies stage production shows it.
3558;jones, both belting out songs and dancing their hearts out) in Prohibition.
3559;and just right as a vehicle to showcase the stars' considerable talents in an area where we did not expect to see them.
3560;picture Richard Gere, a hotshot lawyer who represents both ladies, singing and dancing while keeping his cynical persona intact, and you have an idea of just what a romp this movie really is.
3561;jones, showstopping gorgeous as a Theda Bera.
3562;I'd see the movie all over again just to see the Queen give it all she's got in full twenties regalia.
3563;it's Renee Zellweger, in my opinion, who ultimately makes the movie, even though the entire ensemble cast is fabulous, right down to the bit players.
3564;She does a bravura job as Roxie, the sweet little murderess who, after plugging her no.
3565;good lover with a chest full of bullets shot at point.
3566;blank range, manages to convey a frightened innocence that makes one want to hug her.
3567;Slimmed down entirely from her zaftig """"Bridget Jones"""" days, Renee gives it all she's got, and shows that she coulda been a contender."""
3568;a torch singer par excellence.
3569;wild, big, bold, with 20s.
3570;"top editing, ""Chicago"" is a wonderful treat, well worth seeing more than once."
3571;This movie is loads more fun.
3572;"It didn't pick up where ""Rouge"" left off, but it was fun at the same time."
3573;She deserves the Oscar and after all they still owe her one for Jerry McGuire.
3574;She so fit the part of her character.
3575;heck, they did such a good job with this movie, I even like Richard Gere in it.
3576;But this was so well written he seemed to add to it.
3577;(just see the movie and take my word for it: it's stunning)I cant say enought about the casting.
3578;Every one of the leads played their part to perfection and was perfect for the part.
3579;And some I didn't think could sing and dance that well.
3580;But other than that if you like musicals your in for a treat.
3581;A possible top ten pick!!!
3582;This is pure awesome entertainment.
3583;Give us more like this.
3584;In the end, two women get together and live happily ever after.
3585;Chicago is such a great show.
3586;date 80 years after it was originally penned I think goes to the fact that the musical truly captures a part (and just a part) of human nature and portrays it with such gleeful abandon that you can't help but join in the fun.
3587;But still, a great revival of the movie musical!
3588;The music and snappy pace keep me going while I watch it and do a brisk walk on my treadmill.
3589;The musical numbers would be (obviously) best seen this way, but still.
3590;And for shots and stuff like this, I was immeidately hooked as a fan of the film, from the first (of 15, so far!!!)
3591;All the special features listed here, make it look promising.
3592;This is a captivating movie derived from the long running Broadway musical of the same name.
3593;We can be glad that the film project was revived, because Rob Marshall has created a truly wonderful movie.
3594;jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and John C. Reilly all dance, sing, and act extremely well.
3595;This is an exceptionally entertaining film that you will long remember.
3596;It is one of my all time favorite.
3597;This is so much fun.
3598;The music and lyrics are 1st rate, Bob Fosse can't be beat, Richard Gere is very surprising, it is superbly acted and performed by all, the numbers are oh you get the idea.
3599;Fast moving and fun, fun, fun.
3600;renee and catherine zeta are perfect for the roles and the music is fantastic!
3601;Chicago is a satire musical, satire meaning over.
3602;top, impossible, just hilarious stuff.
3603;There is no doubt this movie has a dark side to it, but the music is so good and the actors pull everything off beautifully.
3604;i have to say that Velma (Catherine Zeta Jones)really steals the show here, even more than Richard Gere does.
3605;She has this incredible flow and energy out there, she would lite up a stage no doubt about it.
3606;the best aspect of the movie by far is the way the dream sequences and regular scenes are blended together so well, they flow right into one another.
3607;The electricity that is required in a live musical is here and grabs your towards the screen, of course the short costumes help also.
3608;i liked the set designs, it had the look of the 20's and the feel of it.
3609;The craziness of the times was there on screen and it added the finishing touch to the movie.
3610;There are actually truths to this plot, while they are exaggerated, they are still there.
3611;overall a masterpiece of a musical, funny, well thought out and the music just makes the movie come alive.
3612;making, even if the movie is based on a Broadway show.
3613;Remember to take that into consideration about my review, because it probably means the movies better than what I say.
3614;She then goes to prison, and with some help from Mama (Queen Latifa) and her lawyer (Richard Gere), she is able to win the public's support, lie her way through her court trial, and become a famous Vaudeville actress.
3615;The highlights of the best musical scenes were where everyone was Richard Gere's puppet, and he did the talking for Roxy and a croud of reporters.
3616;This was probably one of the most fun scenes in the movie, but the Circus/Courtroom scene was also very well done.
3617;Pretty good if you ask me from someone who doesn't like musicals.
3618;Last year's, Moulin Rouge hinted the return of the genre in Hollywood.
3619;This year, it is back in full form with much flair in Rob Marshall's Chicago.
3620;At its peak , it produced such unforgettable classics such as My Fair Lady, Mary Poppins, and the Sound of Music.
3621;seeking hot shot lawyer by the name of William Flynn (played by Richard Gere) takes an interest in their case.
3622;At first, Velma receives much of the attention since she already had a semi.
3623;As the story progresses, the two vixens vie against one another to hog the attention of their lawyer and more importantly , the spotlight from the public.
3624;In Gus Van Sant's To Die For, Nicole Kidman played a similar type of publicity.
3625;the movie Chicago is based on a famous Broadway play during the 70's which is in turn based on a novel.
3626;The novel itself is said to draw as its source from a real life event in the 20's with a story similar to Roxie and Velma's.
3627;There's no question that these two stars invested a lot of time in getting their dance routines right.
3628;Credits should be given to the script writers for coming up with such a clever story device.
3629;Some of them are excellent.
3630;Queen Latifah is naturally good (she's better known for her music career after all), John C. Reilly delivers a surprisingly luscious voice, and as for Catherine Zeta.
3631;at the moment, Chicago is the front runner in the Oscar race with thirteen nominations including Best Picture.
3632;I expect the film to win the coveted Best Picture Oscar, not because I believe the film is a masterpiece, but because the competition is so weak.
3633;Although I do not feel the picture deserves a space on the mantelpiece alongside the likes of The God Father or Schindler's List, I do admit to having enjoyed two hours of good entertainment.
3634;A bit of Funny Honney's, but without a doubt it delivers All that Jazz.
3635;Murder Jazz and a spectacular cast, theirs only one movie that delivers it all.
3636;And when your god to Mama Queen Latifa's good to you.
3637;And aong the way it is this terrific scramble to see who will be more famous then the other but in the end, Velma and Roxie got together to the stage.
3638;A fantastic movie for almost the whole family.
3639;The one movie that delivers Roxie, Razzle Dazzle and All that Jazz, that's Chicago
3640;It is a damn good one, and very entertaining.
3641;Catherine Zeta Jones, to me, was the real star, handling some of the most demanding dance and singing sequence.
3642;I not only absolutely love movies but I absolutely love the 1920's too!
3643;I was shocked, fascinated, and disgusted, by the characters and events in this movie.
3644;But at the same time, I found humor and fun in it.
3645;i especially loved the concept of a jazz show narrating the movie as it went along.
3646;I also enjoyed the casting.
3647;chicago was an all around fun movie and it would be worthwhile to watch again and show to friends.
