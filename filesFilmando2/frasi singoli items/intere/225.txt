I:90;1;It's big, bold loud and brash .
I:90;2;The comedy is slapstick and hammy, and the production numbers are belted out within an inch of their life.
I:90;3;since it's acted, sung and mostly shot like it's still taking place on a live theater stage, everything is much louder, broader and, well, stagier than how we're used to seeing things done in movies.
I:90;4;Uma Thurman is delightful as sexy.
I:90;5;Director Susan Stroman is obviously comfortable with the material, since she did the stage show, and she films it simply, with a lot of straight.
I:90;6;on full shots and judicious editing.
I:90;7;style magnifying glasses, is anything other than homophobic, intent to poke fun and make us laugh at effeminate men.
I:90;8;When opening night for Springtime for Hitler arrives, it comes as something of a relief, though also a source of confusion.
I:90;9;I suspect the real version is much better.
I:90;10;By its very nature, the musical demands a live audience.
I:90;11;Witness the litany of great shows rendered impotent, most often for direction, for their inability to transfer.
I:90;12;and when they do work, they transcend both stylistic forms, and create masterpieces.
I:90;13;(Picking up a dozen Tonys on the way, thank you very much.)
I:90;14;Well, it leaves it much where it found it.
I:90;15;The Producers is a great movie.
I:90;16;Where it best succeeds is in capturing the theatrical performance for posterity.
I:90;17;And what works brilliantly on stage simply doesn't transfer as seamlessly to the screen as director Susan Stroman doubtlessly believed.
I:90;18;"Along Came Bialy goes on far too long and needs some rethinking
I:90;19;"Stroman succeeds better with Broderick's numbers, particularly ""I Wanna Be A Producer,"" which gets all the fantasy fanfare a film can provide."
I:90;20;, the man is simply a genius.
I:90;21;whether it was in the interest of time or giving more film to Broderick is a good question.
I:90;22;"What worked on stage for Roger Beach and Gary Bart as Roger DeBris and Carmen Ghia now is just borderline funny, though Beach pulls out the stops when he goes on as Hitler during the show's opus, the marvelous ""Springtime For Hitler."""
I:90;23;will Ferrell is the biggest surprise of all as the perfectly loony and vocally proficient Nazi Franz Liebkind.
I:90;24;She's oddly intense, phyiscally vague and overly dramatic in a role designed as a brilliant parody of the classic Swedish buxom blond.
I:90;25;mel Brooks make his token appearance twice, once vocally and once again at the very end.
I:90;26;"He wrote a new song for Lane and Broderick called ""There's Noting Like A Show On Broadway"" that rolls over the credits and is really quite good."
I:90;27;Fact is, Brooks is everywhere, given that he wrote all the songs, and the story.
I:90;28;i would have said 3 stars, but the songs are so classic, and Lane is so brilliant, they earn it the 4th star.
I:90;29;"This should have been an ""excellent"" film version of the musical, and it should have been an Oscar contender."
I:90;30;This is just about the best movie Mel Brooks has ever done.
I:90;31;It will undoubtablly go down in history as one of the all time greatest musical comedys ever.
I:90;32;Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick work so well off of each other you would swear that they were long lost brothers.
I:90;33;The Broadway musical is a bizarre artistic cul.
I:90;34;That said, some are better than others.
I:90;35;In Moulin Rouge this was accomplished with great success, unfortunately, with The Producers, you have a poem that's been translated too many times.
I:90;36;the original 1968 film not only launched the career of arguably our funniest director, it demonstrated that where others saw sacred cows worthy of reverence, Brooks saw hamburgers.
I:90;37;warmed the platter for Broadway.
I:90;38;Uma Thurman is tall, and watching her dance with Broderick, (who comes up to her navel), should be funny .
I:90;39;"Will Ferrell delivers yet another irksome Will Farrell performance
I:90;40;Gary Beach (Roger DeBris) has the film's best voice and delivery, and his assistant, (Carmen Ghia), played by Roger Bart, matches the original .
I:90;41;"do yourself a favor, get the original Mel Brooks film
I:90;42;Lying is one of the great destroyers of civilization no matter how it comes.
I:90;43;So what is the natural choice in the 1950's but a cross dressing homosexual.
I:90;44;But this movie of the Broadway version is still spectacular.
I:90;45;Lane is wonderful, Broderick merely passable, as always.
I:90;46;and sometimes, just having a document that preserves performances like these for all time is the most valuable thing of all.
I:90;47;One of the best movies ever!!
I:90;48;Both Lane and Broderick are great in their respective roles, and newcomers Thurman and Ferrell are both great (Ferrell is absolutely hilarious).
I:90;49;The songs, which are (almost) exactly taken out of the play, are great, and the dance numbers are very well done, especially the one involving the little old ladies and their walkers.
I:90;50;Still, this is still an entertaining film.
I:90;51;I enjoyed it enough to watch it more than once, its direction I thought was good, the new songs funny and most of the characters entertaining.
I:90;52;will Farrell does a good job, as do most of the cast, Nathan Lane completely steals the whole show though, he simply lights up the stage and screen, BUT his performance is very like the performance given by Zero mostel.
I:90;53;Lee Evens played this part on stage and was great, Matthew, an actor I really love, in my opinion, gave the worst performance of his career.
I:90;54;It can be enjoyed on the surface as a comedy or musical.
I:90;55;This scene is a reprise/sendup of Fiddler, complete with Jewish lament and incredibly energetic street dancing.
I:90;56;Nathan Lane is brilliant and hold center stage no matter who else is there, but Matthew Broderick is a great straight man, Uma Thurman is dazzling, Roger Bart is hilarious.
I:90;57;The story is not only fun, but all of us can share the aspiration to a dream.
I:90;58;I was thrilled when I found out Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane would reprise their Broadway performances for the big screen.
I:90;59;And a gem this is.
I:90;60;filled, laugh out loud funny musical comedy of the year delights mainly due to the outstanding performances of Lane and Broderick.
I:90;61;is a singing, dancing romp that leaves you feeling you have seen the best of Broadway at the movies.
I:90;62;"will Ferrell shines as the playwright enamored with Hitler and thrilled to bring his ""Springtime for Hitler"" to the stage in one of the movie's best production numbers, the other being the sex."
I:90;63;see for fans of musicals.
I:90;64;I was able to follow the plotline really easily and I laughed at just about every scene in the movie.
I:90;65;I also liked the fact that there were no swear words in the movie that I could recall, and while there are several refences, there weren't any actual sex scenes, which as a nice change to me.
I:90;66;Good, but was it great?
I:90;67;Enjoyed it but not sure it captures the magic of the original film.
I:90;68;My husband and I enjoyed this show because the movie was so creative, hysterically funny and imaginative plus the acting was supreme.
I:90;69;We just loved it so much we sent this movie to a friend and my hubby and I will sit down and watch it over and over again because we believe it is a classic.
I:90;70;hopes for this film, thinking a Mel Brooks comedy is always good.
I:90;71;When you find a movie as good as this, you never keep it to yourself.
I:90;72;nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick once again deliver a grand performance of amazing vocal talent and wit.
I:90;73;the music is phenomenal, and the acting is nothing short of Broadway gold.
I:90;74;Lane and Broderick are a formidable duo when it comes to musicals.
I:90;75;If you loved their singing in The Lion King, you'll be blown away again.
I:90;76;This is a great movie and the songs are very catchy.
I:90;77;except for cutting out Nathan Lane's best song, it's a good reproduction of the play.
I:90;78;Thank God this film is so well made, has Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane and allows me to settle for second best next to seeing it live.
I:90;79;the story flows effortlessly here and plays like a Broadway musical.
I:90;80;When the characters burst into song or especially with the big numbers the screen comes to life and you feel as if you are seeing it live.
I:90;81;The story is simple yet ingenious.
I:90;82;The entire film is laugh out loud hilarious and both Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick bring the high energy and musicality that most certainly thrilled live.
I:90;83;uma Thurman and Will Ferrell were not on Broadway but here they fit their parts perfectly.
I:90;84;Both show exceptional talent at musicality and comedic timing.
I:90;85;all the musical numbers shine and when song and dance are combined the movie gives you such a feel good feeling.
I:90;86;I love the whole cast but Matthew Broderick shines for me with both his acting and singing/dancing.
I:90;87;The standout number is the huge production number I WANNA BE A PRODUCER and THAT FACE which he does with Uma Thurman is glorious.
I:90;88;Nathan Lane shines in the solo BETRAYED and he and Matthew Broderick have perfect chemistry in the touching TIL HIM.
I:90;89;Mathew Broderick and Nathan Lane were made for these roles and their full exceptional talent is in full display.
I:90;90;They make a perfect team and the chemistry provides laughs galore.
I:90;91;Thank God they agreed to make the film version.
I:90;92;watch this movie to feel good, laugh hysterically and be prepared to sing and dance for days.
I:90;93;The music stays with you.
I:90;94;He loves the singing and the dancing.
I:90;95;Nathan Lane is my son's favorite one on that movie.
I:90;96;I get to see it once a day every day.
I:90;97;:)I would recommend everyone see it at least once.
I:90;98;It is also one of the funniest movies ever made.
I:90;99;This is a brilliant, wickedly funny musical comedy!The original 1968 Mel Brooks movie is like a 1968 Dodge Dart .
I:90;100;"beautiful
I:90;101;intead of panning it, critics love it and audiences are filling the box office coffers with demands for more comedies like this.
I:90;102;A good cast and staying true to the story helped tremendously.
I:90;103;Will Ferrell, a gifted impresionist, Uma Thurman and Matthew Broderick polish this one up and make it shine like a 1968 Dodge Dart, showing all its classic charm.
I:90;104;It's worth it for the laugh value.
I:90;105;The film of the musical based on his original film is done bigger than life throughout, with the acting never dropping down from the this.
I:90;106;Mel Brooks takes a machine gun approach to every sacred cow on Broadway and his willingness to push the boundaries in the 1960s still feels quite edgy today.
I:90;107;all acquit themselves well and bring an extra layer of polish to things, although I imagine fans of the Broadway show will complain, possibly with merit, that the original stage actors should have been given a chance to perform before a wider audience.
I:90;108;still, this is a dazzling film and side.
I:90;109;strongly recommended for fans of Mel Brooks (stick around after the credits to see him appear in the film of the musical of his old film), the strong cast (Will Ferrell does an especially good job in his role as a maniacal Nazi.
I:90;110;"The addition of several new musical pieces and keeping ""Springtime for Hitler"" shows a great effort at creativity while retaining the essence of the story."
I:90;111;And Uma looked like she had fun in this one.
I:90;112;This movie is completely awesome and having never seen the 1968 film or Broadway musical, I think it is one of the best movies and musicals ever made!
I:90;113;Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick together make for a charming and fantastic musical joyride!
I:90;114;This movie is absolutely hilarious.
I:90;115;To those who have no sense of humour, you may find this offensive, but to the rest of the world, this provides 2 hours of laughs!
I:90;116;"Having seen the original version first 
I:90;117;A great version of the hit play.
I:90;118;Both Lane and Broderick are outstanding!
I:90;119;Keeps me laughing every time I see it.
I:90;120;I loved it and bought it as 90th b'day gift formy Dad.
I:90;121;and I wanted himto watch something good!!!!
I:90;122;We enjoyed the move so much!
I:90;123;I love this movie and had watched it many times when I had the premium cable channels.
I:90;124;I love the Nathan Lane and Mathew Brodrick duo and I thought that Will Ferrell was great,as was Uma Thurman.
I:90;125;i never tire of watching movies that I really enjoy.
I:90;126;I love that there are now a few modern ones that I can watch.
I:90;127;If you are into old time musicals with Gene Kelly and Judy Garland, you will love this one!!!
I:90;128;Nathan and Matthew do a brillant job!!
I:90;129;Will Ferrall is so funny!
I:90;130;He does a excellent german nazi soilder!!
I:90;131;The original Producers is one of the funniest movies ever made.
I:90;132;I laughed so hard that I knew I'd want to own it to watch at any time I wished.
I:90;133;We saw this show on Broadway and loved it.
I:90;134;My whole family and I laughed until we ached.
I:90;135;Mel Brooks is the funniest man on earth.
I:90;136;Th cast was brilliant and it was hilarious, sad, poignent and full of life.
I:90;137;Although I thought that Nathan Lane tried a little too hard to be Zero Mostel, and ditto for Matthew Broderick per Gene Wilder, this was a funny movie.
I:90;138;But I think the best performance, by far, was that of Uma Thurman . . .
I:90;139;If you loved the original Producers with Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel, you will be pleasantly surprised at this musical version with Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane.
I:90;140;I haven't laughed so much in a great long time, and Uma is just too sexy in her Ulla part.
I:90;141;The music is wonderful, reminiscent of the old movie musicals, even the dancing wasn't bad.
I:90;142;This movie version of the smash Broadway hit fixes all the loose ends of the original 1968 film with great acting, scoring, production, and fantastic humor.
I:90;143;I am a fan of nerotic producers and provacative blondes so I decided to give it a shot.
I:90;144;To say the least I didn't vomit at the sound of show tunes showering through my thirty inch telivision set, I must admit it was a fairly good film.
I:90;145;Will Ferrel shines as a radical neo.
I:90;146;The acting was good, the singing was withstandable and Uma Thurman was ravishing.
I:90;147;Not one of my favorites, but it is by far my favorite musical.
I:90;148;Nathan Lane is arguably the best and most versatile male actor on modern Broadway and while the scene may be a little overproduced with its visual overdubs, Mr. Lane delivers the number flawlessly.
I:90;149;It can tide you over until you find a community theater group putting on the live production, allowing you to enjoy the show the way it was meant to be seen.
I:90;150;Watch it with someone who can laugh with you.
I:90;151;Uma Therman also does a good job as Ula.
I:90;152;the music in this film is amazing!!
I:90;153;I want to keep replaying the musical scenes!I love this film!
I:90;154;I love his Young Frankenstein, on Broadway, which stars Robert Bart (who I love) who plays Roger's partner in this film.
I:90;155;I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.
I:90;156;I've always loved Nathan Lane but he is so funny in this movie and Will Ferrell as the pigeon loving crazy german obssessed with Hitler is perfect.
I:90;157;I have never been a big Uma Thurman fan but I actually liked her in this movie.
I:90;158;She is so believable as the swedish seductress, Ulla, who sings and dances her way into nerdy Leo Bloom's, played by Matthew Broderick, heart.
I:90;159;the songs are entertaining and the dances well choreographed.
I:90;160;seriously, if you get a chance and you want a good laugh, this movie's for you.
I:90;161;Watch the original, much funnier.
I:90;162;Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick shine reprising their roles from the stage, and Uma Thurman and Will Ferrell make nice additions to the cast.
I:90;163;loud funny, but it's also gorgeously filmed, both in New York and in studios.
I:90;164;"The ""I Want to Be a Producer"" scene is particularly fantastic and belongs up there with the best of Broadway."
I:90;165;This is one of my favorite Broadway to Movie performances!
I:90;166;Everything from the sets to the performers is absolutely perfect!
I:90;167;This change makes the musical more of a hit than Max and Leo expected.
I:90;168;with an amazing cast (Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, and Will Ferrell and great songs this movie is a treat.
I:90;169;I still think it is one of Mel Brooks' best films.
I:90;170;But, on the whole, I have to admit to enjoying it much more than I thought I would.
I:90;171;Even more credit belongs to the incredible Nathan Lane for managing to equal Zero Mostel's original Max Bialystock and even, once or twice, surpassing it.
I:90;172;He is, quite rightly, the heart and soul, of the film.
I:90;173;Uma Thurman is a pleasant surprise, the double act of Gary Beach and Roger Bart are pure politically.
I:90;174;incorrect joy, and even Will Farrell is good.
I:90;175;He certainly comes to life when singing and dancing, much more so than I would have expected.
I:90;176;In general, the staging was clever and often laugh out loud funny.
I:90;177;But the energy and enthusiasm with which they are performed more than make up for that.
I:90;178;But many delights survive including a chorus line of grannies with walking frames, beautiful girls dressed only in pearls, and Uma Thurman doing a quite good Cyd Charisse impersonation with her seemingly endless legs.
I:90;179;But Nathan Lane's Betrayed number was soooo good that I had to rewind for an instant encore.
I:90;180;all in all, it's nice to see that someone can still do a good old.
I:90;181;I saw the original Broadway production both in previews and through several cast changes and loved it.
I:90;182;The movie was fun but I think it's almost impossible to catch the flavor and fun that live theater presents, especially since a good performance is enhanced and energized by audience appreciation and feedback.
I:90;183;That being said, this is an enjoyable film aside from the lackluster performance by Uma Thurman.
I:90;184;Will Ferrell was good but Brad Oscar could have shone in this movie.
I:90;185;I was very happy to see that Roger Bart, who is a favorite of mine was included in the film as well as Gary Beach.
I:90;186;I enjoyed the outtakes and will watch this again, I'm sure.
I:90;187;This iteration of 'The Producers' has the thankless task of being compared to both the Broadway live performance, and to the original film that gave rise to that musical.
I:90;188;songs must be written, for example.
I:90;189;let me make it clear that I enjoy musicals when I am in the theatre.
I:90;190;"piece dance number that does work is Bloom's fantasy with the ""Beautiful girls wearing nothing but pearls"" number where he sings I Wanna Be a Producer."
I:90;191;The latter works because it makes sense in the context of the movie .
I:90;192;Despite all these issues, the film is extremely funny and enjoyable (except for the aforementioned dragged.
I:90;193;Some of the changes from the original film are actually improvements: for example, the decision to do away with the flower.
I:90;194;I like happy endings, except when they seem contrived, which was the case with this show.
I:90;195;Recently, Chicago triumphed as a movie thanks to it very clever adaptation.
I:90;196;There are several other adaptation issues: (1) Uma is beautiful but cannot sing.
I:90;197;That aside, I loved the supporting cast.
I:90;198;Gary Beach, Roger Bart and Will Ferrell are simply BRILLIANT.
I:90;199;BTW, I also loved John Barrowman as the Lead Tenor of this sequence.
I:90;200;Still, I think it's worth the four stars.
I:90;201;And Uma, I mean I love her but she was the funniest part about this movie for ALL THE WRONG REASONS.
I:90;202;just hearing her accent go in and out during her singing number was priceless.
I:90;203;The Producers is a stellar, first.
I:90;204;Nathan Lane (Max) and Matthew Broderick (Leo) shine in their respective roles, and the supporting cast (including Uma Thurmon, Roger Bart, Gary Beach, Will Ferrell, John Lovitz, and others) helps keep the movie flowing smoothly.
I:90;205;The Producers comes at you full.
I:90;206;"Anyways, ""The Producers"" is one of the best comedies to come out in years
I:90;207;I'm sure it came as a surprise to many that The Producers basically bombed at the box office, given the critical acclaim of the Broadway show .
I:90;208;especially given the fact that Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprised the roles they had performed before countless packed theater audiences.
I:90;209;This is a good, funny movie, but it oftentimes plays like a show rather than a movie.
I:90;210;the audience actually loves the show, viewing it as mad satire rather than an ill.
I:90;211;if you ask me, Nathan Lane pretty much carries this movie on his back.
I:90;212;Uma Thurman is delightful as Ulla and Will Ferrell is his usual hilarious self as Springtime for Hitler writer Franz Liebkind, but these and their fellow supporting actors come and go as the movie continuously revolves around the two producers themselves.
I:90;213;I'm certainly thankful to finally get a chance to see this production that I have heard so much about, but I have to believe the actual Broadway show presented the story more effectively than the film.
I:90;214;This is a fabulous movie!
I:90;215;It takes the original version to newand hilarious levels.
I:90;216;That said, the original version ranks high in the pantheon of screen comedy so that would have been a tall order.
I:90;217;It is a consistently entertaining and funny film.
I:90;218;Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane are this generation's Matthau and Lemmon.
I:90;219;There are some embellishments here from the original film.
I:90;220;"That quibble aside this ""Producers"" is an immensely enjoyable production."
I:90;221;Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane well paired for movie.
I:90;222;Will Ferrel has suprising musical talent along with him being a clown.
I:90;223;"down favorite movies of this year, ""A History Of Violence"", was not even an hour and a half long."
I:90;224;It had action, twists, suspense, and great storytelling.
I:90;225;This movie definetely has the feel of a Mel Brooks movie, from its risque sexual humor to the insane song and dance numbers that most of the time go ways over the top.
I:90;226;When this brilliant satire of Broadway musicals came out in the sixties it announced two things: (1) enough time has passed so that we can now laugh at the holocaust, and (2) we are OUT.
I:90;227;It was brilliant in a strange way.
I:90;228;It was satire, and I always loved and respected satire.
I:90;229;But the show within a show, a classic theatrical device, and the tricky gay jokes within tricky gay jokes were wonderfully done.
I:90;230;Brooks made fun of gay Broadway while at the same time celebrated that Broadway and Hollywood staple: two guys who were not gay (wink, wink) going through a great adventure together.
I:90;231;what a heady time it was.
I:90;232;That was the genius of The Importance and that is the genius of The Producers.
I:90;233;The producers of course are satirized, but since they are also the stars of the show, that is okay, and real producers would love the script (and perhaps front money for it!)
I:90;234;(You've got to love the choreography of the hundreds of little old ladies in their walkers and their blue and white dresses dancing in the New York streets.)
I:90;235;In short, the mad satirical genius of Mel Brooks finds full flower.
I:90;236;Regardless this movie is uproarious and provides abundantly the kind of diversion that makes time fly.
I:90;237;"nathan Lane, who also reprised Zero Mostel's Pseudolus in the stage production of ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,"" is hilarious as Max Bialystock, the producer who finances his shows by seducing little old ladies, while Broderick is boyishly cute as Leo Bloom the accountant who wants to be a producer."
I:90;238;The outrageous and very funny plot develops when Bloom comes to do Max's books and remarks that sometimes more money can be made with a flop than a hit.
I:90;239;notable is the performance by Gary Beach as Roger Debris the gay director who steals the show within the movie when he takes the part of Hitler.
I:90;240;Upon viewing of this movie, I was shocked to find that the movie is barely enjoyable.
I:90;241;Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick revive the original with the same pluck and masterful acting as Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder.
I:90;242;It was great in the play and a chance for Lane to really stretch and strut his stuff.
I:90;243;They did and it's fabulous .
I:90;244;really amazing that it was cut.
I:90;245;And the extra where Max AKA Nathan has to make whoopie with all of his backers filmed in NYC's Central Park is another fun to have scene.
I:90;246;using NYC as backdrop always gets my heart pumping.
I:90;247;but Farrell does a good job .
I:90;248;Nathan as Max as Zero Mostel is perfect.
I:90;249;I adored the stage version of The Producers and I was lucky enough to see it within two weeks of it's record setting win at the Tony Awards.
I:90;250;Lane and Broderick were wonderful in the show, as was the rest of the cast.
I:90;251;When you watch the film, the dance and musical numbers look almost exactly like they did on stage.
I:90;252;In fact, you can tell that almost all of the sets are actually sets.
I:90;253;I thought Uma Thurmon did a nice job as Ulle, except when her accent decided to come and go, and Will Farrell was very funny as Franz.
I:90;254;This is a fun film and totally un.
I:90;255;pC, but it's enjoyable overall and a reminder what the Broadway show is like.
I:90;256;The outtakes are a riot, watching Lane and Broderick cracking each other up and often failing to be able to keep a straight face with each other.
I:90;257;Still not as good as the show is onstage, but still enjoyable for what it is.
I:90;258;This is true of myriads of the great Broadway Stars, including, for example, the two Queens of Broadway in their day, Mary Martin and Ethel Merman (the older one).
I:90;259;In addition, perhaps, the lines came through with a greater sense of spontaneity for the audience.
I:90;260;whatever the case may be, taken on its merits, this is a good, old.
I:90;261;One would guess Broadway, which always had greater latitude in such things, saw a more ribald version.
I:90;262;As the film unwound (an obsolete phrase, of course), I began to appreciate their performances.
I:90;263;Both were excellent although Nathan Lane had the better part in which to make an impact.
I:90;264;Loved the original but as a musical, it is simply a classic.
I:90;265;this movie is definitely worth putting it on your shelf!
I:90;266;the point of an adaptation is to actually adapt.
I:90;267;i will admit that it's hysterically funny and the best thing mel brooks has ever written but awful presentaion.
I:90;268;impressed trained tenors who do it on stage.
I:90;269;one of heart go over the Deep.
I:90;270;Also Urma Thurman is at her lushious and most attractive part to date.
I:90;271;It all is a masterful Mel Brooks remake that will send you into stiches!
I:90;272;Will Ferrel was unexpected and Lane and Broderick are perfect.
I:90;273;The original 1968 film is one of my favorite movie comedies, and I was fortunately enough to see Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick in the smash 2001 Broadway musical version directed by Susan Stroman.
I:90;274;She handles this responsibility for the film adaptation, her first time behind the camera, and her lack of experience in the medium shows with the constancy of medium shots and the general staginess of the whole venture.
I:90;275;what Stroman does very well is capture Brooks' no.
I:90;276;barred comic spirit with this broad.
I:90;277;In a grand recreation, Nathan Lane captures much of the spirit of Zero Mostel in his rimshot.
I:90;278;Working seamlessly into this ensemble are Will Ferrell, uninhibited and very much at home as always as the old.
I:90;279;Jon Lovitz even shows up with a comic Lionel Barrymore impression as Leo's stingy boss, Mr. Marks.
I:90;280;lady investors dance in unison with walkers.
I:90;281;"but there are also wonderful surprises like Thurman's triumphant solo, ""When You Got It, Flaunt It"", and Ferrell's hilarious reprise during the end credits, ""The Hop Clop Goes On""."
I:90;282;And please stay in your seat after the credits for the fun free.
I:90;283;"all performed by the entire cast, ""Goodbye!"""
I:90;284;Regardless, this one is a treat even if it feels like the performers are playing to the back row of the theater.
I:90;285;I absolutely love this movie, and it arrived in perfect condition.
I:90;286;I highly recommend The Producers to anyone who enjoys music and funny things.
I:90;287;So I'll cut to the chase and tell you which specific scene to look for the maximum comedy.
I:90;288;Right at that point De Bris' agog face is melting with the hope he might win the much coveted award of the American Theater.
I:90;289;I would enjoy this funny, well acted, film.
I:90;290;It's good but I felt a bit overplayed versus the original.
I:90;291;returned item and system worked brilliantly.
I:90;292;The musical numbers were great, acting pretty good, and plot (while predictable at times) was great.
I:90;293;I loved every minute of this movie.
I:90;294;It was funny and touching warm and and had a great ending.
I:90;295;As usual Nathan Lane is fantastic and adding Matthew Broderick was a perfect touch.
I:90;296;This is a must see it really is great.
I:90;297;It's amazing.you have the musical hit of the decade to convert to the screen.
I:90;298;"You ditch the hilarious opening number (King of Broadway) that sets the stage and mood for the show
I:90;299;"Bring in Will Ferrell who does a great job of being Will Ferrell, and all the things that made ""The Producers"" such a hit have vanished."
I:90;300;Once the movie hits its stride, it captures much of the magic of the original, but by then, who cares?
I:90;301;The first 25 percent of the flick is awful, even with the incredible talents of Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.
I:90;302;I found the early parts of the movie to be an enormous disappointmemt, but still a good record of this hilarious show.
I:90;303;I enjoyed the last two.
I:90;304;It took real talent to screw up this funny, funny show!
I:90;305;everybody loved them and they swept all of the major awards at the Oscar's.
I:90;306;Here is a movie that's really funny, looks great visually has goods songs (although definetly not the best)and the critics and movie goers just don't seem to like it.
I:90;307;But I'm here to tell you that it's very good.
I:90;308;Plus, it's just great to see a musical on the big screen.
I:90;309;it's been forever since Hollywood made a real movie musical.
I:90;310;Go see it, you'll enjoy it a lot.
I:90;311;it's an utterly unique experience.
I:90;312;I love it and my family loves it.
I:90;313;She had never seen this movie, so I downloaded it.
I:90;314;She laughed often and it helped get her mind off a boring, restrictive hotel room stay.
I:90;315;She's still recovering and doing well.
I:90;316;The movie was campy, in your face and larger than life but much to my amazement I loved it.
I:90;317;Was it the greatest musical ever produced HECK NO not by a long shot but for a couple of hours it kept me entertained and that's all that mattered.
I:90;318;it was a laugh a minute movie.
I:90;319;we dont usually watch musicals, but this one was great
I:90;320;Still a very good movie, but it's better on the actual stage.
I:90;321;Watch the original, and see the actors make themselves history.
I:90;322;The last 20% was the best, but a lot of that was the newness, versus real input for the viewer.
I:90;323;It was absolutly hilariouse, excelent track, great acting!
I:90;324;It was all so good.
I:90;325;This is by far one of the greatest screen comedy musicals ever produced.
I:90;326;Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Uma Thurman and the rest are just hilarious.
I:90;327;The film offers Mel Brooks.
I:90;328;this enterprise is as good as any legendary musical of the past.
I:90;329;the scoring, costume design, make.
I:90;330;For that price, I reasoned, it would make a good companion piece to the original.
I:90;331;the directing is, at best, pedestrian.
I:90;332;In fact he was the main reason I made it all the way through the film!
I:90;333;While he is no Zero Mostel, his was the best performance in the film.
I:90;334;Overall an excellent change and good update for the times.
I:90;335;The making of this script into a musical.
I:90;336;screen this time as one of the Nazis delivering a one.
I:90;337;liner, he *did* do the voice for the line!Overall this *is* a funny film with several laugh.
I:90;338;I encorage you to pick up the original.
I:90;339;It's a superiour film in almost every respect.
I:90;340;don't this time and you'll be rewarded.
I:90;341;written tunes, great casting, witty lines and slapstick comedy all in a package of a film.
I:90;342;"Everything is executed in a wonderfully hilarious manner
I:90;343;"choice quotes include: ""Violinists love to play a E. string, but everybody loves a G. string!"""
I:90;344;"and,""How can I shoot you if you keep moving!"
I:90;345;stage settings and lighting are also wonderfully done, as well as the casting, with the possible exception of Ulla, although admittedly this does add to the comedic element.
I:90;346;what is loveable about the movie are its slapstick elements and verbal wit.
I:90;347;Much of its satire come from exaggerated real.
I:90;348;life situations into caricatures and combining it with some of the best .
I:90;349;choruses, The Producers is a delight for both the eyes and the ears.
I:90;350;stars: The potential of this dynamic combination could have been developed from a more timely execution.
I:90;351;Do keep in mind that The Producers is a film based on a stage musical based on a film about a stage musical.
I:90;352;That is, the script and the songs are terrific, and it seems like it ought to be a truly wonderful theatre experience (one that I regret not seeing), but Susan Stroman's direction doesn't go the extra mile to make the film a unique and separate experience that makes the cinematic version worthwhile, in the way of truly great musical to film adaptations .
I:90;353;Because it really is lots of fun.
I:90;354;The sarcasm of the original film lost little of its edge, and the musical adaptation is terrific, and does honor to Mel Brooks's brilliant original vision.
I:90;355;a. musical, which I thought at first might get confusing and unconvincing, actually works remarkably well, and it's very self.
I:90;356;aware, with a lot of cynical in.
I:90;357;jokes about Broadway and the world of musical theatre.
I:90;358;"As I said, it's as cynical and dark as the original film, and Brooks avoided the pressure to make it kitschy and happy
I:90;359;Nathan Lane is a terrific Bialystock, every bit as memorable as Zero Mostel's timeless original character.
I:90;360;Matthew Broderick isn't nearly as good as Gene Wilder, who was and remains the one and only Leo Bloom, but he gets the job done, and does well on the musical numbers.
I:90;361;The real surprise here is Will Ferrell .
I:90;362;directly for the original film, and are still brilliant.
I:90;363;Uma being the exception, all the actors do a spectacular job on the songs, all the time making you wish you were seeing this on stage.
I:90;364;Still, if you missed that chance, The Producers is a great watch.
I:90;365;Not better than the 1968 film, but a very good musical film and a hilarious comedy.
I:90;366;Nathan Lane is always a riot, but I think you will find that the outtakes are the funniest part of this movie and will hold your attention a lot longer.
I:90;367;huge production sets and big numbers make this film a great film for those who are into musicals.
I:90;368;uma Thurman does the best on film job, playing a subtle and campy seductress.
I:90;369;if dazzling production numbers, sparkling costumes, over the top acting and the feel of Broadway on film delight you, you will enjoy this.
I:90;370;I did not really liek the original and I found it better then this musical adaptaion.
I:90;371;A musical based on the Broadway show which in turn was based on the original film which was awesome.
I:90;372;Although derivitive it is good in its own right, especially with some of the musical numbers in it.
I:90;373;The dance scene with Uma Thurman is worth the price of the movie.
I:90;374;Loved this one even more than the original.
I:90;375;i'd recommend this version to everyone.
I:90;376;A Great Musical Comedy the way it used to be filmed!Just so you all know.
I:90;377;I loved the original movie and I've seen the traveling cast twice.
I:90;378;The Producers is probably the funniest musical I've ever seen on stage and I would say go see it at any price.
I:90;379;Part of the Producers' charm is it's BIG.
I:90;380;"The songs are fun and catchy, the acting superb, though Matthew Broderick does get *just* a little ""chipmunky"" at times, and appearances by Jon Lovitz and Will Ferrell boost the enjoyability."
I:90;381;be sure to check out the deleted scenes for some of the songs cut from the movie, and the outtakes are some good laughs.
I:90;382;I was always a big fan of the original movie, starring Zero Mostel.
I:90;383;This new musical adaptation is utterly brilliant and, as far as I'm concerned, worthy of Oscar nomination for Best Picture.
I:90;384;Mel Brooks may well be the most underrated director on the planet.
I:90;385;A few funny moments that were not worth the wait by any means.
I:90;386;To be fair I'll liquor up and give it another shot.
I:90;387;This movie is indeed a full scale musical and I can't help but think that many people just don't accept this form of entertainment on the big screen anymore.
I:90;388;the story is great, the singing and dancing is fantastic, and the visual aspect of the picture is astounding.
I:90;389;"the original ""Producers"" is one of my favorite films and unlike many, I don't feel like they compromised it in any way."
I:90;390;It so surpassed our expectations!
I:90;391;Nathan Lane is a comic genius and the chemistry between he and Matthew Broderick is incredible!
I:90;392;Will Farrell is hysterical (this is one of his funniest performances) and Uma Thurman is fantastic!
I:90;393;I didn't think Zero Mostel's portrayal of Bialystock could be equalled, even by Nathan Lane, but alas, Lane proves once again that he is the best.
I:90;394;I promise it'll make you laugh, again and again!
I:90;395;and please watch the outtakes!!!
I:90;396;You will laugh yourself silly to watch Nathan Lane and Mathew Broderick completely break each other up!
I:90;397;What an incredible team those two make!
I:90;398;This is just a classic that should be in everyone's collection.
I:90;399;If you like musicals then you will rate this production higher than I did.
I:90;400;not even close to Gene Wilder's fantastic performance.
I:90;401;nathan Lane however, was excellent as Bialystock.
I:90;402;The actors Gary Beach as the director, and Roger Bart as his assistant, were much better cast than the original.
I:90;403;Some of their scenes will have you roaring with laughter.
I:90;404;This movie is tough to rate, but I will give it 3 stars.
I:90;405;Nathan Lane's performance, some new material, and the added bonus and outtakes make the disk worth having.
I:90;406;It's hard to look at this film on its own, without comparing it to the original film, which is one of the great comedy classics.
I:90;407;It's certainly a fun film, with a number of very good songs, a great performance by Nathan Lane, and a good one by Maththew Broderick.
I:90;408;There are styles of acting that work very well on stage but don't work as well on screen and vice versa.)
I:90;409;And of course the original Dick Shawn's brilliant performance as over the top actor L. s. d., playing Hitler.
I:90;410;So, in the end, it's a good 4 star film, compared to the 5 star original.
I:90;411;mel Brooks resorting, sadly, to juvenille humor of Jim Carrey and Mike Myers to keep us tickled pink.
I:90;412;i would recommend, to those who have not seen it, a little.
I:90;413;"I absolutely love the ORIGINAL version of ""The Producers"" with Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel."
I:90;414;I kept hearing how wonderful the new version was and how great Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane were in these roles, so finally gave this movie a try.
I:90;415;The acting of the original is FAR better, the actors are much more interesting and believable, and it is much, much, much funnier.
I:90;416;"The original ""Producers"" was a pretty funny movie for its time."
I:90;417;There was literally nothing funny about this movie.
I:90;418;And somehow a lot of obviously very culturally deprived people found this thing funny.
I:90;419;Add popcorn and a Coke and the evening is perfect!
I:90;420;Keep it light, keep it bright, keep it gay!
I:90;421;The Roger and Carmen Ghia duo are a riot!
I:90;422;Susan Stohman directs this adaption of the Broadway musical which she also directed and she retains some of the major cast from the Broadway show.
I:90;423;"The play they come across is titled ""Springtime for Hitler"" and it is a celebration of the Third Reich."
I:90;424;this is the story of Mel Brooks' original film, the musical, and now the movie adaption of the musical.
I:90;425;It worked and was funny with Gene Wilder and I've seen the show in the Twin Cities, and it worked as a musical.
I:90;426;And yet even the moments of absurdity still work and the bottom line is that the movie is fun and it is funny.
I:90;427;the theatricality of the film is something that a viewer will either able to accept and enjoy the movie, or it will be a big turn off.
I:90;428;I was able to work with it and enjoy the movie even as it played like a theatre musical on stage (at times with the pause at the end of a musical number).
I:90;429;Strohman plays this to great effect, however, and it becomes part of the charm of the movie.
I:90;430;But this is only a small bit of irksomeness in a good movie.
I:90;431;as this was the first movie I had been able to see in theatres in months and I had a fantastic time, and I think that is something a movie should deliver: enjoyment.
I:90;432;When I finally saw it, it was with Brad Oscar who did a credible job as Bialystock.
I:90;433;I saw it once more in a Broadway Across America road show with Lewis J. Stadlen which was very well done, but I had to see it with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.
I:90;434;I paid five hundred dollars for a prime third row seat, and it was worth it.
I:90;435;She's a brilliant live theater director, and a clueless movie director.
I:90;436;Will Ferrell was added to the cast as the movie, and he does a great job, but the movie needed a strong directorial hand not added Hollywood names.
I:90;437;movie and actually is better than the play.
I:90;438;"The director of the movie ""Chicago"" did a brilliant job, reinventing the stage play as a movie."
I:90;439;When you're going to do a stage musical as a movie, get a creative movie director who thinks outside the theater box to direct it.
I:90;440;He also wanted this version of his re.
I:90;441;So they made a movie, of the smash hit on Broadway, for the second time.
I:90;442;Most of us will never get to Broadway and fewer still will ever see Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane in these roles.
I:90;443;this however, is a much bigger production than any one live performance.
I:90;444;It's an old style dancing, singing musical comedy.
I:90;445;The flamboyant director, Roger DeBris (Gary Beach) fills in.
I:90;446;Suddenly Hitler is rather gay and very funny.
I:90;447;The dialogue and music are hilarious, the play is a hit and the producers are busted.
I:90;448;The deleted open scene is very diffeent and admittedly better than the one used.
I:90;449;This and the whole creative process is explained by director Susan Stramann in the commentary.
I:90;450;that being said, the play is as entertaining a time as you can spend in the theater and I thought it was an improvement on the original movie.
I:90;451;"The songs are toe tappers for the most part, the expansion of the parts of the director and the author of ""Springtime for Hitler"" were welcome as was the expanded role of the Swedish bombshell."
I:90;452;it is a lot of fun and features almost all of the songs from the Broadway show.
I:90;453;it is wacky, very politically incorrect, and worth every minute.
I:90;454;The musical is an amazing satire of both Broadway and Hitler, and I enjoyed it, as well as having my jaw drop in appreciation of Brooks' creativity.
I:90;455;I saw the original movie several times, the Broadway play with Lane and Broderick and was very pleased with this adaptation of The Producers by Susan Stroman.
I:90;456;besides being a very funny movie, I loved the way the dancers were filmed.
I:90;457;This movie took advantage of the dancers' abilities and showed a coordinated and well choreographed version of the show.
I:90;458;i also enjoyed the extras on the video and the missing scenes.
I:90;459;"My three favorite numbers, ""I Want to be a Producer"", ""Springtime for Hitler"", and ""That Face"" were a delight."
I:90;460;It was also fun to see Mel Brook's cameo.
I:90;461;Mel Brooks really did a wonderful job with this show.
I:90;462;But the film is a lot of fun also.
I:90;463;the show is a hit!
I:90;464;top and funny and this movie is a hit, as well.
I:90;465;It makes for a great evening of entertainment.
I:90;466;As parodies go, this is over the top.
I:90;467;A good parody will exaggerate, and this one makes even Young Frankenstein look like an elementary school kid's pun.
I:90;468;musical movie, this is pretty much a filmed stage play starring the play's two leads, Lane and Broderick.
I:90;469;Broderick is full of wide.
I:90;470;"i liked the originalProducersback in 1968, which was nutty and wacky and funny
I:90;471;I can certainly see how charming Lane and Broderick would be on the stage, especially if you're seated 100 feet from them.
I:90;472;"They're adorable and talented and the story is funny
I:90;473;Broderick and Lane are great and add in a surprisingly good performance from Thurman and this movie is definitely worth a watch.
I:90;474;When I viewed the film this week I naturally compared the two.
I:90;475;The Producers is a great movie musical!
I:90;476;It is one of the rare films that has reamianed true to it's original Broadway production.
I:90;477;I loved the feel of the flim and the classic look of the film.
I:90;478;There were also good performances by Will Ferrel and Uma Therman.
I:90;479;Now I only hope I will be this pleased with Dreamgirls and Hairspray!
I:90;480;I saw this performed on Broadway last summer (Roger Bart as Leo, whom I think is actually better than Broderick, but anyway . . .) and laughed all the way through it.
I:90;481;if you love this show, see it on Broadway, but if you're new to musicals, I guess this is a good way to start out.
I:90;482;five out of the six principals are quite good .
I:90;483;I realise that they attemped to capture the feel of Broadway, but it just felt amaturish.
I:90;484;I laughed the whole way through.
I:90;485;Will Ferrell is at his comedic best in this.
I:90;486;The music numbers are well choreographed and sung, overall a really fun film.
I:90;487;This movie always brings a smile to my face.
I:90;488;I have seen the original film, stage production, and now the musical film (in that order).
I:90;489;Each one has its merits and drawbacks.
I:90;490;Moreover, if you like musicals in general this one shines above most of them.
I:90;491;"The songs are timeless and ""cultureless"" in a way that other musicals, which use contemporary rock, jazz, etc. are not."
I:90;492;as for the 2005 film, it is an excellent rendition of the stage version.
I:90;493;"the skill of the dancers, actors, and singers
I:90;494;Nonetheless, most of this is retained in the film and cinema audiences laughed almost as much as in the theatre.
I:90;495;The biggest difference, of course, is cost of admission.
I:90;496;In any case, it's quite a change from Kill Bill!Will Ferrell was typically brilliant and hilarious, and I thoroughly enjoyed the brief but funny appearance of John Lovitz.
I:90;497;I saw it on Broadway and laughed so hard.
I:90;498;I'v always been satify with items I brought from Amazon.
I:90;499;But it can be a lot of fun anyway by using the idea of the play and putting it into music and dance.
I:90;500;But if you can separate the play from the musical, and just concentrate on the theme and the idiotic story line, you'll have a good time.
I:90;501;There, in the recording studio where the original cast recorded the musical (even the tap dancing) I got the idea of what I was going to see when the musical did come out.
I:90;502;All the songs were there, the orchestra, original cast, including some unrehearsed, hilarious wordplay with Mel and the cast while he and Susan Stroman directed the recording.
I:90;503;I almost liked the PBS recording version better than the show.
I:90;504;It was so up and so funny.
I:90;505;But I still laughed at the storyline.
I:90;506;The gal in the recording session, Cady Huffman was absolutely, absolutely great!
I:90;507;As a musician and singer myself, I always preferred musicals.
I:90;508;Financing is accomplished through Max's collection of lonely old ladies.
I:90;509;The actual accomplishment of that mockery is comedic genius.
I:90;510;"First time I watched the movie, I thought, ""What in the world was I thinking???"""
I:90;511;he was totally captivated by the subtle (and not so subtle) humor and unbelievable comedic timing between Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.
I:90;512;Brooks has never been subtle, but surely he and the director are aware that there is a marked difference between stage acting .
I:90;513;You'll enjoy this number or else !
I:90;514;It wants to wrestle one to the ground until he confesses he is charmed by the clever antics.
I:90;515;Still, that one sticks in my mind as the superior version of Mel Brooks' production.
I:90;516;But the outlandish characters were fun for a few laughs.
I:90;517;I don't see what is so funny about it.
I:90;518;Perhaps I'm missing something, but my guess is that a lot of people share my sentiments.
I:90;519;i knew Nathan Lane sings really well, and was actually pleasantly surprised at Matthew Brodericks singing voice.
I:90;520;Such a great musical comedy.
I:90;521;The product came before it was scheduled to and in great condition.
I:90;522;This is a class hilarious movie.
I:90;523;It is hilarious because of the nature of the characters and situation.
I:90;524;He is so talented in his writing.
I:90;525;one of the best funny movies ever.
I:90;526;love this two actors .
I:90;527;never watch the original one but this one is greati will watch it again
I:90;528;In 1968, Mel Brooks wrote and directed The Producers a movie that has been deemed one of Brook's best film.
I:90;529;lucky for us, they agreed to appear in the movie version which, if you've seen the show on Broadway, is exactly the same with a few differences.
I:90;530;"there's one line in the film that will make you laugh like you never have before said by Hanz Libkind, played in the film by a perfectly cast Will Ferrell, who says with a gun pointing at Max and Leo, "" This is for making a fool out of Hitler."""
I:90;531;A line sure to be a classic.
I:90;532;It's a film that's better then the original and will be cherished by all.
I:90;533;This film is practically the phenomenal onstage musical captured by a moment of unison between Broadway and Hollywood.
I:90;534;The cinematography to this film is absolutely stunning, from the colors to the set.
I:90;535;This beautiful imagery combined with the hilarious wit of Mel Brooks and fabulous acting of Broderick and Lane allows all people to have an orchestra level seat to see this great film.
I:90;536;When it comes to originality, this piece nails the bull's eye.
I:90;537;"the two are certain they've found the perfect piece when they read ""Springtime for Hitler,"" a piece that makes the evil dictator out to be a nice guy."
I:90;538;the story itself is very entertaining.
I:90;539;the actors all do amazing jobs with the rolls.
I:90;540;Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick originated their rolls when the story became a Broadway musical, and their familiarity with the material is an asset.
I:90;541;Will Ferrell, not part of the Broadway cast, is hilarious as the politically motivated author.
I:90;542;He steals most every scene he is in.
I:90;543;Uma Thurman is simply amazing as Ulla, the secretary/starlet/Leo's girlfriend.
I:90;544;susan Stroman, who did the choreography for the Broadway version, directs the movie.
I:90;545;She also did the choreography here.
I:90;546;Ridiculously funny and Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are just pitch perfect.
I:90;547;The musician songs are amazing.
I:90;548;Will Farrell's turn as a German and Uma Thurman's Ula are amazing.
I:90;549;The movie is so inappropriate and so funny.
I:90;550;because the original Zero Mostel/Gene Wilder version was so great.
I:90;551;It was an entirely new film based on the same general script.
I:90;552;first of all, the movie really is funny.
I:90;553;And it was well acted too, despite the fact that the cast wasn't as good as the 1968 cast.
I:90;554;But Nathan Lane, Mathew Broderick, Will Ferrell and Uma Thurman were still very good.
I:90;555;the dance numbers were excellent.
I:90;556;I'm really not a fan of musicals, but this one was good.
I:90;557;The production was extremely well done, and it moved well enough that I didn't even realize it was a two hour film!The bottom line is that the 1968 version was a comedy classic.
I:90;558;Perhaps Mel Brookes very best comedy film.
I:90;559;This is really a musical comedy with elaborate singing and dancing.
I:90;560;And when you do that, it's quite a good musical comedy.
I:90;561;i didn't want to like this movie, but I ended up loving it.
I:90;562;I find myself singing songs from this film constantly.
I:90;563;An overall fair movie but the original gets five stars.
I:90;564;This movie is hilarious, If you like musicals.
I:90;565;Nathan Lane and Mathew Broderick do an outstanding job in this remake of the 1968 classic.
I:90;566;The comedic timing, and the interaction between Lane and Broderick movies this happy little movie right along.
I:90;567;"Uma Thurman's audition scene is wonderful, not only for ""Ulla Dance!"""
I:90;568;but for the reaction performances by Lane and Broderick.
I:90;569;In all, a great remake of a classic.
I:90;570;This musical is by far the best I've seen in a very long time.
I:90;571;I am a Matthew Broderick fan, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how well he could sing and dance.
I:90;572;All in all, this was a terrific movie, that I enjoyed (so did my 7 year.
I:90;573;A nice movie for a Saturday afternoon.
I:90;574;"The film version of ""The Producers"" does an excellent job of bringing the Mel Brooks musical to the big screen."
I:90;575;Lane and Broderick have amazing chemistry and give outstanding performances.
I:90;576;The audience laughed for two hours straight.
I:90;577;top, and absolutely fabulous in every way.
I:90;578;"Now I'll leave you with a few memorable lines from the show within the show:""Springtime for Hitler and Germany."
I:90;579;"deutschland is happy and gay!We're marching to a faster paceLook out, here comes the master race!"""
I:90;580;The hit Broadway show has been beautifully transferred to the screen.
I:90;581;The staginess of the movie brings to mind how they did movie musicals back in the days of Singin' in the Rain and An American in Paris, thus making the loving homage to the Golden Age of Broadway a loving homage to the Golden Age of MGM movie musicals, even though Universal and Columbia produced it.
I:90;582;i had the pleasure of seeing the entire original cast in February of 2002.
I:90;583;Nathan Lane, who won the Tony for this excellent performance, still pulls punches.
I:90;584;I felt that this was an Oscar.
I:90;585;Matthew Broderick is also amazing in the Tony.
I:90;586;This was another performance worthy of Oscar gold.
I:90;587;uma Thurman brings the neccessary sexiness of Ulla, the sexy Swedish secretary.
I:90;588;well, she could have used a bit more training.
I:90;589;He won the Tony for this role and you can see why.
I:90;590;winner Roger Bart is hilarious as Carmen Ghia, for which he was nominated for a Tony.
I:90;591;"touch Me, a little old lady who is one of Max's backers and won't hand over the check until they play ""one dirty little game"", The Producers shines with magical musical numbers, particularly ""I Wanna Be A Producer"" which brings to mind the Broadway Melody sequence of Singin' in the Rain or the American in Paris Ballet."
I:90;592;"the deleted scenes are excellent and should provide closure to those wondering, ""What the hell happened to ""King of Broadway""?"""
I:90;593;"I was especially happy to see this number in the film as well as ""In Old Bavaria"", the reprise of ""Der Guten Tag Hop Clop"", as well as the solo by the black accountant in ""I Wanna Be A Producer."""
I:90;594;but this is an excellent movie for musical theatre lovers.
I:90;595;I saw this show on Broadway and it was hysterical.
I:90;596;That is sometimes the case with stage productions that are made into movies.
I:90;597;"Not much but who cares: it's in the telling that ""The Producers"" is so much fun."
I:90;598;"both Lane and Broderick chew the scenery within and inch of its life and most of the musical numbers are fantastically staged outdoors to great advantage: the investor ladies with walkers scene is a hoot as well as Leo's number with his fellow accountants as is the opening scene from the show that Max and Leo produce: ""Springtime for Hitler."""
I:90;599;but you will leave happy and positive.
I:90;600;The 2 lead actors do there damn best.
I:90;601;Lane had the best moments because he's flipping hilarious.
I:90;602;"The songs can be taken in by small amounts and the best one would be ""If You Got It, Flaunt It"" when Thurman does her thing."
I:90;603;THE PRODUCERS, the Broadway smash based on a hit 1968 movie, is lavish, over the top, bawdy, sometimes offensive, and oftentimes a very enjoyable musical.
I:90;604;Nathan Lane is superb in recreating his role of Max Bialystock, the lecherous producer who'll do anything to round up backers for his shows, which are always flops.
I:90;605;The flamboyant Will Farrell chews up the scenery as the play's Hitler.
I:90;606;adoring writer, and although he's his usual zany self, it fits the movie.
I:90;607;Their energy brings a lot of life to the movie, and I found them to be the most entertaining performers in the film.
I:90;608;The costuming and settings are smart and colorful and the overblown numbers are reminiscent of the Busby Berkeley movies of the thirties and forties.
I:90;609;"THE PRODUCERS is entertaining
I:90;610;great music, brilliant actors, and lots of laughs!
I:90;611;I've always loved Mel Brooks movies, but i'd never even heard of The Producers untill it became a musical stage show.
I:90;612;I went to see the show and enjoyed it quite alot when it was here in Melbourne.
I:90;613;And when I saw the previews to the movie of it, I had to go right away.
I:90;614;but I thought the whole cast was pretty good.
I:90;615;The 2 lead actors do there damn best.
I:90;616;Lane had the best moments because he's flipping hilarious.
I:90;617;"The songs can be taken in by small amounts and the best one would be ""If You Got It, Flaunt It"" when Thurman does her thing."
I:90;618;an ace theatrical director and choreographer who performed both chores for the Broadway musical.
I:90;619;"That said, her version of ""The Producers"" still provides more than enough laughter, joy and high spirits to satisfy any audience looking for a good time at the movies."
I:90;620;is a serviceable songwriter at best.
I:90;621;(Broadway originals Gary Beach and Roger Bart are roll.
I:90;622;aisles funny as Roger and Carmen, while Uma Thurman is a knockout as Ulla, a vastly better singer, dancer and comedienne than one might expect.)
I:90;623;Franz Liebkind, Will Ferrell equals Kenneth Mars from the original movie, bringing a joyous heedlessness all his own to the role.
I:90;624;But they bring their own, more courtly comic rhythms to the roles, making the characters more human while garnering their full share of laughs.
I:90;625;It's also nice to see such comic masters as Jon Lovitz, Andrea Martin and Michael McKean contribute cameos, out of sheer love for the project.
I:90;626;"As with any Mel Brooks production, the humor in ""The Producers"" is as broad as it possibly can be."
I:90;627;The only way to take Mel is to let him wash all over you, a vast tidal wave of yucks, in the knowledge that laughing well is the best revenge.
I:90;628;This movie version of Broadway is wonderfully produced.
I:90;629;Very upbeat and fast moving.
I:90;630;Matthew Broderick relationship is good .
I:90;631;"In 2001, Brooks adapted it for the stage as a musical, and ""The Producers"" won a record."
I:90;632;"In 2005, ""The Producers"" returned to the silver screen with most of the original Broadway cast and Susan Stroman directing."
I:90;633;The action has been moved to 1959, from 1968, for aesthetic reasons.
I:90;634;The Producers gives a strong impression of a Broadway musical on film, so the audience's reaction to this movie may be largely a matter of taste.
I:90;635;Susan Stroman takes advantage of film's flexibility to create more fully realized sets and more interesting costumes than is possible in the Broadway show.
I:90;636;The comic musical numbers featuring Franz the Nazi, Ulla the Swedish bombshell (Uma Thurman), and flamboyant director Roger DeBris (Gary Beach) are more successful.
I:90;637;top acting style in scenes that don't seem to call for it.
I:90;638;"Stroman takes us through creating the ""I Wanna Be a Producer"" production number, from rehearsals to filming."
I:90;639;Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish, and French.
I:90;640;Dubbing is available in French.
I:90;641;I have to premise this review with, my wife's favorite move is Seven Brides for Seven Brithers.
I:90;642;She has watched it hundreds of times.
I:90;643;This is a classic remade with an all star cast.
I:90;644;i loved the original when I saw it back in the late 60's.
I:90;645;"nathan Lane does a decent job but Matthew Broderick, what can I say
I:90;646;i believe it a must see for those who enjoy both a good comedie and great music.
I:90;647;This is movie that you can watch again and again.
I:90;648;It is well acted and a good distraction.
I:90;649;On said masterpiece Mr. Marshall was able to transform to the big screen an unpretentious musical from the 1970s, all in black and white with limited staging.
I:90;650;The movie included great stars such as Ren e Zellweger, Catherine Zeta.
I:90;651;The constant changes of scenes from the Cook County Jail to the Court Room and to the Club make of it a real masterpiece that made the movie worth winning six Oscars.
I:90;652;on this movie version, video and audio are great.
I:90;653;The roles of Max and Leo were masterfully played by Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick which were in the original Broadway musical.
I:90;654;"Other great artists did participate in the movie
I:90;655;Well, he's done it again.
I:90;656;Genius), but the cast in this movie is wunderbar!
I:90;657;Nathan Lane brings back the ghost of vaudville and burlesque comedy in his performance.
I:90;658;Matthew Broderick adds his own twist to his part.
I:90;659;Will Ferrel was quite brilliant and the scene with the directors?
I:90;660;When I saw the original movie with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, I thought it was one of the funniest movies I had ever seen, and became one of my favorites.
I:90;661;I looked forward to the new version, having really loved the movie versions of Phantom, and Chicago.
I:90;662;I wasn't expecting much but I was laughing from start to finish.
I:90;663;The concept of Nathan Lane as a straight man was funny in and of itself.
I:90;664;I really enjoyed the musical numbers.
I:90;665;You will enjoy this especially if you understand why Mel Brooks would want to humiliate The Fuhrer.
I:90;666;While it is a spoof on a lot of things that society deems in questionable taste, once you realize where America is on these issues you will surely appreciate the humor.
I:90;667;first watched at a friend's recommendation when i goggled at their singing of Springtime for Hitler at work, i found myself laughing uproariously.
I:90;668;Singing and comedy, two of the hardest skills to acquire and perfect, are showcased with much gusto in this two.
I:90;669;hour comedy musical about two honest professionals who try their hand at conwork to earn some money.
I:90;670;nazi, hire a flamboyant director and his crew of gay and not so gayish men, and assemble a cast led by a Swedish bombshell.
I:90;671;Together, they put on a stage performance that does incredibly well, to their chagrin.
I:90;672;this movie was quite entertaining to watch.
I:90;673;It is family friendly with good doses of various sorts of comedy: sarcasm, wit, irony, slapstick, and plain ludicrousness that inspires laughter and probably a lot of exasperation from any viewer.
I:90;674;The music itself is quite impressive.
I:90;675;one of his better movies.
I:90;676;The modern Broadway version with Nathan Lane and Mathew Broderick was equally fun, and had its own unique charm that played well to a theatre crowd.
I:90;677;her stage performance was flawless!
I:90;678;power' still has so much influence over casting.
I:90;679;Seeing this on the big screen was close, though!
I:90;680;Had to get it to enjoy at home.
I:90;681;we'll lose a real gem when he goes.
I:90;682;i'm not a big fan of musicals, but this one really works.
I:90;683;Will Farrell as a former Nazi, the gorgeous Uma Thurman as a cheesecake foreigner, and the blue blanket!
I:90;684;Another one of the greatest musicals EVER!
I:90;685;overall, the cast is great, they all seem to have a chemistry with one another and the songs are just so darn catchy.
I:90;686;I would highly recommend this title to any lover of musicals.
I:90;687;One of Mel Brooks best works.
I:90;688;Springtime for Hilter is a catchy tune that stays with you.
I:90;689;I had great misgivings about this film when I heard it was coming out.
I:90;690;The original, made over a quarter of a century ago, is Mel Brooks' funniest and finest film.
I:90;691;the difference between the new film and the old is that the new film is a musical with songs all the way through .
I:90;692;The original songs are perfect .
I:90;693;The acting is fine but do not obliterate the far superior performances of Zero Morstel and Kenneth Marrs.
I:90;694;Avoid and wait until the original comes on TV.
I:90;695;Nathan Hale and Matthew Broderick are outstanding talents in singing, dancing and comic style.
I:90;696;Mel Brooks made some very funny films.
I:90;697;To Be or Not To Be is a very good movie.
I:90;698;Blazing Saddles was good and I really liked the farting part.
I:90;699;"His satire of the Catholic Church in ""The History of the World Part 1"" is worth watching if only for the nuns diving into the swimming pool Ester Williams style."
I:90;700;The Producers is the best Mel Brooks film ever.
I:90;701;"Zero also starred in ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to The Forum"" which is one of the funniest musicals ever made."
I:90;702;The wait was worth it.
I:90;703;Recording allowed us to see the Broadway cast perform the songs even if we didn't get the stage show.
I:90;704;It helped with the wait.
I:90;705;When he finally sat down and did write it he set Broadway records by winning nearly every Tony the year it opened.
I:90;706;The show is certain to be reviled that it will close on opening night.
I:90;707;And why, please why cast Will Farrell as Franz Liebken?
I:90;708;She can't dance and she can't sing.
I:90;709;"If you want a fun show get ""The Producers."
I:90;710;The show is five stars.
I:90;711;I just love the show and have enjoyed the music from it for some years now.
I:90;712;broadway run in Chicago and was thoroughly entertained.
I:90;713;Well, let me tell you, the critics are nuts because the film was great.
I:90;714;I laughed and was entertained for two hours.
I:90;715;The musical numbers are just wonderful.
I:90;716;Mel Brooks has proven he's a genius again and again.
I:90;717;This is one of my favorite musicals, and I wish I could've seen Broderick and Lane on Broadway performing this.
I:90;718;Lane was a great Bialystock, with the ability have having both qualities of being an endearing has.
I:90;719;Okay, I liked this film.
I:90;720;i liked it a lot.
I:90;721;It was funny, the cast was great, and time just flew by as I watched it.
I:90;722;I mean, I do remember that I found Will Ferrell's musical numbers amusing, but I don't remember any of the lyrics as I am writing about them in this review and I found his whole character funny in general and looked forward to whenever he'd be on screen, music or no music.
I:90;723;great to watch but heck if I can remember a single note she sang.
I:90;724;Of course, Nathan Lane was great as the scheming producer and Matthew Broderick was above and beyond his own game as the nervous accountant.
I:90;725;But nevertheless, this film has more than enough to keep you entertained and I ultimately do recommend it.
I:90;726;maybe you'll remember the songs.
I:90;727;nazi Franz Liebkind was just hilarious.
I:90;728;Go ahead and watch it!
I:90;729;"style movie with music about a Broadway musical to a real Broadway musical to a movie musical can't be easy, though Nathan Lane is superb throughout
I:90;730;"most songs are pretty good
I:90;731;On the other hand, such fans may enjoy hearing classic lines repeated.
I:90;732;"[Brooks fans will enjoy hearing his voice on a production number and a great line from ""High Anxiety""]."
I:90;733;Mel Brooks had a great vision for the film version of the Producers musical .
I:90;734;The end result has spectacular performances, music, and script, but somehow doesn't work.
I:90;735;the main element that has not transitioned to the screen is the spontanaety of the actors, well versed in their lines, demonstrating a fine chemistry only found by seasoned stage performers.
I:90;736;What looks marvelous on stage doesn't neccessarily look as great on screen.
I:90;737;It helps that Lane and Broderick have fine chemistry and are fine performers.
I:90;738;I liked the musical version of the Producers.
I:90;739;"I enjoyed the musical version of ""The Producers"" so much that it led to me watching his other films."
I:90;740;great Broadway producer (or so he tells us) he's now relegated to seducing rich little old ladies to finance his dismal plays.
I:90;741;Leo's got problems of his own: he still carries the blue blanket he had when he was a baby (and goes into wild, funny hysterics when it's taken from him).
I:90;742;"Until, while looking at a seeming discrepancy in Max's figures for ""Funny Boy,"" he offhandedly comes up with a scheme to save them both."
I:90;743;"to those of you new to this story, a little background:Once upon a time, back in 1968, Mel Brooks made his first movie, a raunchy, biting satire of Broadway called ""The Producers."""
I:90;744;It was eventually hailed as not only his funniest picture, but one of the funniest ever made.
I:90;745;It was only natural to adapt this skewering of Broadway to the Broadway stage, which Brooks finally does in 2001.
I:90;746;He camps it up so much, the audience considers it a brilliant satire.
I:90;747;perfect for the sort of character he's playing.
I:90;748;"The songs, written by Brooks himself, are wonderfully catchy (even, dare I say it, ""Springtime For Hitler"")."
I:90;749;a play are entertaining, and expanded considerably from the original movie, where they had served as little more than a sight gag.
I:90;750;"while I'm usually irritated by ""stunt casting"", Will Farrell as Liebkind was a pleasant surprise, being far funnier than I originally expected."
I:90;751;"star review is the fact that director Susan Stroman (Mel's Broadway director) chose to remove the Broadway show's best number, ""King Of Broadway."""
I:90;752;Other cuts Stroman made are also included as extras, making one wonder about her editing choices.
I:90;753;"Better is the featurette analyzing one musical number, the wonderfully staged ""I Wanna Be A Producer."
I:90;754;each is bound to find something worth liking in the other.
I:90;755;"Whether this will be Brooks' last picture is uncertain, but if it is, ""The Producers"" is the perfect swan song to an ingenious career."
I:90;756;This was a charming musical.
I:90;757;comedy with lots of songs and laughter.
I:90;758;It is not an Academy Award winning movie, but it's an enjoyable to watch.
I:90;759;Uma Thurman is appealing as a Swedish actress they hire for their secretary.
I:90;760;after I got over the annoying way Lane and Broderick were playing their parts, the movie got very funny.
I:90;761;remake of 'The Producers' has oceans of great stuff in it .
I:90;762;staged tunes, great performances, excellent direction, plenty of laughs, and an all.
I:90;763;round sense of fun that I haven't seen in a movie musical for aaaaages.
I:90;764;still, for the most part, it's an extremely enjoyable and worthwhile movie.
I:90;765;Finding the best script for the job .
I:90;766;performances are manic, energetic and hilarious .
I:90;767;and the script is lively and funny.
I:90;768;I'm very pleased that the production company decided to keep a decidedly 'theatrical' feel about the whole film .
I:90;769;big, numbers are simple and elegant, and the whole look and feel of 'The Producers' hearkens very much back to a Hollywood of the 1940s and 1950s .
I:90;770;big numbers, big voices and big visuals.
I:90;771;the actual 'Springtime For Hitler' sequence is similarly hilarious, and similarly simplistic .
I:90;772;but still, it's great fun, and well worth owning .
I:90;773;'The Producers' is very good .
I:90;774;The musical is great, (Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick), but nothing compares with the chemistry of Mostel + Wilder.
I:90;775;It is a musical interpretation of that original, which was an often brilliant classic of silly slapstick, over the top acting, and poor taste (read Ebert's review of each film).
I:90;776;I thought the musical numbers were well staged and directed, and the songs were deliciously vulgar and witty.
I:90;777;The stars reprise performances honed on Broadway, and Uma Thurman was a nice surprise as a musical performer.
I:90;778;If you like musicals, and if you laughed at the original, you will enjoy this film.
I:90;779;I am big fans of the musical play and the movie.
I:90;780;My views are about the wonderful sound in 5.1 Stereo.
I:90;781;My screen is 15'x 9' with a gold curtain in front of the screen.
I:90;782;The 7.1 Denon Sound is outstanding.
I:90;783;After viewing this film in all it's glory i knew that all my hard work was worth every penny.
I:90;784;The editing, costumes, music, acting, sound, dancing and everything else that makes up this film is worth 5 stars plus.
I:90;785;If you haven't seen either the broadway version or this film, you are in for a wonderful treat.
I:90;786;I bought it for my dad after watching it and he has watched it 5 times already since Father's Day.
I:90;787;overs!The only actor that really did a decent job was Will Ferrel.
I:90;788;Thumbs way up on the original!
I:90;789;The remake movie is very good.
I:90;790;nathan Lane is a very good actor.
I:90;791;also, a play by its very nature has imagery.
I:90;792;The movie was better than the play.
I:90;793;It is extremely entertaining and well done.
I:90;794;The movie overall is very entertaining.
I:90;795;Will Ferrell was very entertaining.
I:90;796;I thought that was the best scene in the play and would have been the best scene of the movie.
I:90;797;Why was it cut?In summary, The remake of The Producers is a very entertaining movie.
I:90;798;Then I suggest they watch the original and enjoy the genious of late great Zero Mostel, who according to Nathan Lane is the real Max Bialystock.
I:90;799;"**1/2Few films have made as complete a round trip through the entertainment world as Mel Brooks' ""The Producers,"" which started life as a movie in 1968, became a smash Tony Award winning Broadway musical in 2001, and now returns to the silver screen, all spruced up but with much of its heart taken out."
I:90;800;luck Broadway producer who discovers that, through some loopholes in the tax laws, one can actually make more money from a show that flops than one that succeeds.
I:90;801;"one of the problems ""The Producers"" faces right off the bat is the memories the audience brings with them of the original movie."
I:90;802;Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, good as they are in the lead roles (and they are VERY good), still cannot rise to the level of the great Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder who came before them.
I:90;803;brooks himself has penned the musical score which features clever lyrics and jaunty, if not exactly memorable, tunes.
I:90;804;"when ""The Producers"" was first released in 1968, it seemed wildly iconoclastic, daring and cutting edge, a perfect reflection of the no."
I:90;805;Now, coming back to us in the form of a high.
I:90;806;Gone is the freshness and immediacy and glorious bad taste that came with the original.
I:90;807;"there are still sporadic moments of pleasure to be had with this ""Producers."""
I:90;808;Director Susan Stroman knows how to put a smile on your face and to make people laugh!!!!!!!!!
I:90;809;This is a laugh out loud comedy that will always be a masterpiece of sheer comedy!!!!!!!!!!!
I:90;810;The choreography was, for the most part, exceptional.
I:90;811;"The singing had its ""highs and lows,"" but the choreography saved it."
I:90;812;I see how it fits into what the two producers were trying to do.
I:90;813;the symbolism is still so powerful to me.
I:90;814;i look forward to seeing another version.
I:90;815;I can see this having a much better presence on the stage than the big screen.
I:90;816;What a great songwriter he is.
I:90;817;He certainly deserved the Tony prize that became his on Tony night.
I:90;818;Nathan Lane is superb, as usual.
I:90;819;the musical numbers are fantastic and staged beautifully.
I:90;820;It is opened up to film with the nursing home and some scenes done outside, yet stays close to the broadway experience, which I saw five times.
I:90;821;but sitting there for over 2 hours and loving the entire thing, seems they are gettting very picky these days and just can't enjoy a musical made today that is in the style of the great MGM musicals, and this was.
I:90;822;The orchestra sounds fantastic, a big improvement over the broadway version (many more instruments added).
I:90;823;if you have any level of sophistication, you will probably very much enjoy this movie.
I:90;824;The songs, the acting, the production are just flawless.
I:90;825;In the specail features Susan Stroman's commentary is the best by far, it is so detailed and well planned unlike other's who made comments as they go along.
I:90;826;ridden musical and make it genuinely hilarious.
I:90;827;"A national treasure, Brooks takes both the musical and the movies to new comic depths with ""The Producers,"" his film adaptation of his recent broadway smash, which was itself a stage adaptation of the 1968 movie, ""The Producers."""
I:90;828;Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their stage roles and the roles made famous by Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder in the original film.
I:90;829;around department, they both got game.
I:90;830;The Producers is funny in the classic sense .
I:90;831;top nebbishy voice . . . it was almost (almost!)
I:90;832;Broderick's overall performance and his singing was excellent, however.
I:90;833;One of the best ideas for a screenplay in decades deserves to be remade by men and women of such comic talent as Brooks' ensemble.
I:90;834;"The musical version of Mel Brooks' ""The Producers"" makes a refreshingly smooth translation from stage to screen."
I:90;835;For viewers who were unable to see the original Broadway production, this cinematic adaptation remains the next best thing.
I:90;836;Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick may not erase memories of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, but they are a classic team .
I:90;837;with standout turns by Will Ferrell, Uma Thurman and Gary Beach.
I:90;838;Director Susan Stroman does a terrific job capturing the excitement on film.
I:90;839;nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are still wonderful to watch.
I:90;840;Will Ferrell does well as do all the other cast members.
I:90;841;The show was the best I've seen on Broadway.
I:90;842;It's still worth purchasing if only to see Lane and Broderick again.
I:90;843;Broadway shows don't often lend themselves well to film.
I:90;844;I saw the show on Broadway and I thoroughly loved it.
I:90;845;"works like ""The Producers"" play better in the theatre than on film."
I:90;846;Being part of the audience reaction is key to the entertainment value of this show too.
I:90;847;Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane will have you rolling on the floor with laughter.
I:90;848;It's also amazing choreography, costuming, etc.
I:90;849;You will love this movie.
I:90;850;After watching this movie and reading the reviews, I'm more curious to take the trip up to New York and watch it on stage, for which I hear is really good.
I:90;851;i've never enjoyed a film so much and laughed so hard for long.
I:90;852;eyed fanaticism that it requires, but you get the overall impression that he's just camping it up and actually making fun of it.
I:90;853;one of the funniest parts of the original movie.
I:90;854;I think I may have laughed twice during the whole movie, and that was at the goofy show posters in Max's office.
I:90;855;"When I saw ""Chicago"" for the first time, I found myself humming the tunes."
I:90;856;His portrayal of Hitler was hilarious, and Franz Liebkind's reaction to it convinced the audience that the play was a comedy.
I:90;857;In the original movie they blew up the theatre.
I:90;858;I loved the Broadway production, so this allows me to watch whenever I want.
I:90;859;"I was sorry that the opening number ""The King of Broadway"" was cut, but pleased to see it in the deleted scenes."
I:90;860;Actually, the outtakes are as good if not better than the movie.
I:90;861;I saw both the original movie and the stage play .
I:90;862;The new musical film is an absolute delight .
I:90;863;If you loved the stage play, you will enjoy this too.
I:90;864;It is very camp and over the top and the musical numbers are just tremendous.
I:90;865;"I particularly enjoyed Matthew Broderick singing ""I want to be a Producer"" ."
I:90;866;this has lots of glitz and glamour!
I:90;867;I think it certainly helps that Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick had the experience of their roles on stage.
I:90;868;I'll admit to being a fan of musical films and this has sky.
I:90;869;paced, camp and over the top .
I:90;870;I have watched this on tv for years and decided I had to have it in my library, it is just the funniest, Nathan lane is the best.
I:90;871;"Leave it to Mel Brooks to ""produce"" a re."
I:90;872;Nathan Lane and, to a lesser extent, Matthew Broderick both over.
I:90;873;played their roles, and appropriately so.
I:90;874;This one sustains a pace sufficient to keep my teenage daughter's attention throughout, and that's really saying something.
I:90;875;"Living far from Manhattan and relying on what is available at TKTS when I do get to see a ""real"" Broadway musical I appreciate this chance to see even a filmed version of Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and much of the original cast in their landmark roles in THE PRODUCERS."
I:90;876;"Sure the film often seems too ""stagy"" and perhaps Broderick and Lane are too theatrical and well rehearsed as Leo and Max but this is still an enjoyable opportunity to see what all the excitement was about in 2001 when this musical opened on Broadway."
I:90;877;Will Ferrell and Uma Thurman were not in the stage production but they are fine in this film version.
I:90;878;"I've never been a big fan of Ferrell but he is very funny playing the Nazi worshiping author of ""Springtime for Hitler""."
I:90;879;Beautiful Uma Thurman certainly looks the part of a Swedish bombshell and her singing and dancing do justice to the role.
I:90;880;A fantastic film, made less than it could have been by the studio's inability to keep everything intact.
I:90;881;"Even though I'm of the opnion that Mel Brooks himself would have done a better job with the camera work
I:90;882;their voices are very strong and it's hard to accept Will Farrell or Uma Thurman in those roles if you've been, even slightly, exposed to the original cast (especially Cady Huffman .
I:90;883;all compromises aside, this is one heck of a movie musical which brightly shines the spotlight on the performance abilities of Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.
I:90;884;"Then, ""The Producers"" was a Broadway musical."
I:90;885;"Now, ""The Producers"" is a movie again, and this time it's a musical as well as proof that Mel Brook's ideas never cease to be funny."
I:90;886;"from beginning to end, ""The Producers"" is filled with sharp jokes, most of them beautifully politically incorrect, but none of them crude."
I:90;887;Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, both of whom have already played their roles on Broadway, play their roles to perfection, wearing their characters as comfortably as their own skin.
I:90;888;Will Ferrell's also great in his role.
I:90;889;Most importantly, everyone in the cast seems to genuinely be enjoying themselves, playing their parts strictly for laughs and making the most extravagant dance steps look natural.
I:90;890;"Still, ""The Producers"" is overall the funniest musical comedy since Joseph L. Mankiewitz's ""Guys and Dolls."""
I:90;891;I was really excited to see this movie.
I:90;892;The idea of Nathan Lane and Matthew Brodak sounded incredibly funny.
I:90;893;"Right?Mel Brooks' ""The Producers"" returns to the big screen, via the Great White Way, in this musical version starring many of the same actors who appeared in the show on Broadway."
I:90;894;lane and Broderick are both very good.
I:90;895;Lane bears a striking resemblance to Mostel and, initially, I found this to be distracting.
I:90;896;Yes, he looks and acts like the famous comedian, but Lane is a funny guy in his own right.
I:90;897;And a pretty good singer.
I:90;898;The combination of his manic energy and his ability to sing, make it easy to see why Lane is always such a hit on Broadway.
I:90;899;"Strangely, Lane had another huge hit on Broadway some years ago with a new production of ""A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum"" in which he took on the role originated by, you guessed it, Zero Mostel."
I:90;900;and Lane, with his rich history on Broadway, is a great choice to reinterpret Bialystock.
I:90;901;Lane humorously conveys the desperation and resignation his character has come to realize.
I:90;902;Much more attracted to his new secretary, Ulla (Uma Thurman), a Swedish bombshell, he realizes the geriatric set is his bread and butter and he has to keep them happy.
I:90;903;matthew Broderick is a big surprise.
I:90;904;The moment when he freaks out and reveals his security blanket is a truly funny bit, immediately creating the character, neuroses and all.
I:90;905;Sure she's beautiful, she's dumb, but she also has dreams, wants to fall in love.
I:90;906;This new version has music throughout, providing homage to the musicals of the 40s and 50s.
I:90;907;It was the right decision and I even get the sense it was a calculated decision.
I:90;908;The Broadway show earned one of the highest one day ticket sales ever recorded.
I:90;909;All of this works because it is done well and could've been lifted straight from a Gene Kelly film.
I:90;910;"it is refreshing to watch a ""Mel Brooks' Film"" again."
I:90;911;Blazing Saddles is a hilarious film, but many of the jokes are at the expense of particular types of people.
I:90;912;"The ""outrageous"" comedies we see today are all about Caucasians getting into ""outrageous"" situations."
I:90;913;Brooks' funniest films are his most outrageous, filled with many un.
I:90;914;The Producers is a milder, tamer, but still funny version of the old Mel Brooks we all loved.
I:90;915;"i'm not sure how the idea popped into Mel Brooks' head, but it was a good idea and now ""The Producers"" has come full circle."
I:90;916;The film of the musical of the original movie brings back a bunch of the stage's stars, notably Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane, to try and recapture what brought Broadway ticket holders out in droves.
I:90;917;Patience is rewarded by some of Brooks' trademark humor and sight.
I:90;918;lady walker dance enough to give the movie a boost in the ratings.
I:90;919;naturally, it's also the film's highlight.
I:90;920;manboy self, which is good, and Gary Beach is an outrage as the flamboyant director DeBris, who takes the role of Hitler.
I:90;921;For Mel Brooks fans only, with a few musical buffs that might life to see the skewer Brooks and the cast drive into the heart of the great white way.
I:90;922;This movie adaption of Mel Brooks' stageplay is genius.
I:90;923;This is the best musical adaption I've ever seen.
I:90;924;This is hands down the funniest movie I have ever seen.
I:90;925;It's way better than the original.
I:90;926;remember punch lines, and all.
I:90;927;i could watch this movie every day and laugh just as hard.
I:90;928;Still, the 'I Want to Be a Producer' production number is an impressive throwback to some of the lesser MGM musicals, and the theatricality of 'That Face' works surprisingly well.
I:90;929;Stroman, who also directed the critically acclaimed Broadway original stage production of `The Producers,' must have thought it best to film the stage production as it is, instead of introducing any cinematic skills into it.
I:90;930;True, she did add the glitter of the golden era of MGM musicals with superb production designs, but the entire feeling of watching this film is like seeing the well.
I:90;931;having said that, thanks to the superb acting from the cast, I admit the film remains very entertaining.
I:90;932;In spite of staleness seen in several parts of the film, at least it worked for me, and the pair of Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane, who need to produce the worst stage ever to get rich quickly, is fun to see.
I:90;933;Actually, the more supports it shows, the better it gets.
I:90;934;keeping writer Will Ferrell and sexy Swedish girl Uma Thurman, and you know what I mean.
I:90;935;Gary Beach and Roger Bart are real hoot, stealing every scene from the leads with excellent performances.
I:90;936;And again with Gary Beach and his brief but fantastic turn as Fuhrer.
I:90;937;I enjoyed the film for what it is, but I don't know that you would feel the same way after seeing this.
I:90;938;The music is great, and the actors are the best, this is an excellent movie that will keep you laughing to the end.
I:90;939;Worth the money, for sure.
I:90;940;You will like this hysterical movie!
I:90;941;It is funny and it will get you to sing along.
I:90;942;Nathan Lane steals the show!
I:90;943;"And despite the subject matter of the awkward play within a play, ""Springtime for Hitler,"" it was the most hilarious scene of the movie."
I:90;944;Mel Brooks has done it again!
I:90;945;"This is by far one of his best works ever
I:90;946;Definately a movie one will enjoy watching again and again.
I:90;947;Zero was a classic comedic actor.
I:90;948;He seemed real in the part.
I:90;949;Lane is a great actor and I like his work in most films, he just can't be Max.
I:90;950;This item was in perfect condition, unopened in its original packaging.
I:90;951;I searched for the widescreen edition in particular, because that's the best way to watch films.
I:90;952;This made the most perfect Father's Day gift I have ever given to him.
I:90;953;heartedly approve of the new Producers movie.
I:90;954;Nathan Lane has become my hero, because he managed to become Max Bialystock without stepping on the legendary Zero's toes.
I:90;955;He created classic Mel Brooks humor with some slapstick comedy and perfect timing, making old Zero up in the clouds look down on this film and smile.
I:90;956;He does a fantastic job as the eccentric German playwright.
I:90;957;time funniest movie ever (followed very closely by Mel Brooks' equally side.
I:90;958;"The first was a classic
I:90;959;Nathan Lane was/is a magnificent Max Bialystock, as good as or even better than Zero Mostel.
I:90;960;He made the role completely his own.
I:90;961;I thought Uma Thurman was hilarious and gorgeous and who knew she could dance like that, let along sing?
I:90;962;Will Ferrell, in my eyes, was sublime as the crazy neo.
I:90;963;I have seen it 5 times and laughed like a lunatic every single time.
I:90;964;I think my son liked it more than I did.
I:90;965;walker dance and how Broadway needs to gay.
I:90;966;"He also liked the deleted ""King of Broadway"" that Nathan Lane sings."
I:90;967;I enjoyed it in general but felt it was Lane's turn to shine.
I:90;968;This film is one of the most enjoyable I've ever seen or owned.
I:90;969;Mel Brooks is a comic genius.
I:90;970;Nat has a field day with this part, again you can tell just how much fun he's having.
I:90;971;I happen to love Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick since The Lion King.
I:90;972;Will Ferrell and Uma Thurman added something that I have never seen in them.
I:90;973;The musical numbers are outstanding (even Uma and Will's accents were great.
I:90;974;even if it was for comedy pull), the costumes will floor you, and if you weren't able to see the original on broadway you will get a piece of the magic these two brought to the stage.
I:90;975;Oh, and if you think you laughed through the movie, go to the outtakes.
I:90;976;if anyone loved the show on broadway or in the westend, this is your chance to relive those fabulous 2 1/2 hours in the theatre.
I:90;977;nathan lane and matthew broderick give a wonderful performance and uma thurman is spectacular as ulla (even though her singing voice might not compare to the original cast .
I:90;978;she makes up for it with her infectuous laughter and splendid acting).
