I:272;1;I love how they remained faithful to the comics in these movies.
I:272;2;A really great movie, the movie is very interesting, has a great plot, good music and overall, just a good movie :P I can't really say I'm great at writing reviews, but I really enjoyed The Crow and have watched and rewatched it multiple times.
I:272;3;Brandon Lee's performance was great, and his death is a terrible tragedy.
I:272;4;The dark feel of this movies mixed with the brights of Eric evolve this movie into an action packed ride that is one of my personal favorites.
I:272;5;The story is good (because Brandon brought the trade paperback of James O. Barr's The Crow with him instead of his script.)
I:272;6;, the acting is phenomenal.
I:272;7;This movie is the s. stuff!
I:272;8;This film represents a complete film full of everything necessary for a great film.
I:272;9;First and foremost, I really enjoyed this film, as evidenced by the 5 stars I gave it.
I:272;10;I found that the Asian mystic took away from the film.
I:272;11;The soundtrack to The Crow was well thought out, and utilized much of the music that James O'Barr listened to while writing The Crow.
I:272;12;month when this film was released in '94 and his popularity sells records.
I:272;13;it generally follows the ideals of the film and I have found some of the episodes enjoyable to watch.
I:272;14;The Crow is an incredible film, and a fitting final piece for Brandon Lee's talent.
I:272;15;First of all there is a great movie.
I:272;16;The Crow is a cult classic, but I don't mean to demean it at all by calling it one.
I:272;17;Based on the comic book of the same name, The Crow has a great premise (a man comes back from the dead to avenge the death of the woman he loves) and is made well.
I:272;18;The action sequences are great (after all, Brandon Lee is Bruce Lee's son).
I:272;19;It also has one of my favorite fight scenes, the shoot out at Top Dollar's.
I:272;20;And Ernie Hudson is surprisingly good in his role in the film.
I:272;21;Their commentary is almost as good as the film.
I:272;22;Most's commentary is very informative and very entertaining.
I:272;23;There is the script that you read the same time the film is playing.
I:272;24;"You can also watch the ""enhanced playback track"" which has trivia and other features as the film plays."
I:272;25;You get a lot of insight into his life, his work, the movie, Hollywood, and where many of his ideas for The Crow came from.
I:272;26;It's a touching `tribute' to Brandon Lee, but not what it should have been.
I:272;27;What makes these so interesting is that you see what the original footage was and how they edited the scene to make it move so fast paced.
I:272;28;Definitely one that should be in your library.
I:272;29;this is the beginning of the collection and a classic thank you very much I liked it a lot it was good
I:272;30;I have it and watch it almost every chance I get.
I:272;31;First of all, if you like dark movies, this is for you.
I:272;32;Entire thing is at night with dark, realistic characters.
I:272;33;Brandon Lee is superb and his death and appsence from the sequel is probably what made it horrible.
I:272;34;The story line is very compeling.
I:272;35;Its a rare drama/emotional/action movies.
I:272;36;It is just the ideal movie.
I:272;37;It was so pure and it really took you to a higher level thjat most movies just can't.
I:272;38;It is a classic story about revenge and love and really puts your small problems into perspective.
I:272;39;it lives in us all rather you fight everyday to live life to the fullest or if you cant grasp life at all.
I:272;40;Proyas knoes this and makes the city a dark realm and its always raing in the Raven's world surronded by ever falling tears.
I:272;41;The fighting scenes are top notch and its a shame that for all lee's magic and charisma the last world he lived in was make believe
I:272;42;This is really a great movie and it is very well done.
I:272;43;great suspense and good lines, brandon lee is GREAT in this movie and its a shame he died in the makingI have heard people talk about last house on the left, virgin spring as rape revenge movies but this is the best one.
I:272;44;A cult status classic that all Brandon Lee fans will cherish.
I:272;45;This is one amazing film, with a mesmerizing performance from Brandon Lee!
I:272;46;It's visually appealing, extremely well made, with amazing performances all around!
I:272;47;Loved the score, too, it fit with the film well, and there's plenty of action to go around as well.
I:272;48;Alex Proyas does an outstanding job here, creating lots of, dark atmosphere, great use of the rain machine, cool visuals, and keeping the pace, action packed, and engrossing all the way!
I:272;49;Brandon Lee, gives an Oscar worthy performance here, he is completely mesmerizing, creepy, kicks that ass and, just thought he was too cool, his AMAZING performance here, will always be remembered, what happened too him was a tragedy, and i for one will never forget him!
I:272;50;Rochelle Davis is awesome here, and is very likable, her and Brandon, had very good chemistry and is one of the best kid actors out there!
I:272;51;Ernie Hudson, is terrific as the Sgt., very likable, and very convincing.
I:272;52;Michael Wincott, is great as the main villain, I loved his voice, and he was very menacing!
I:272;53;The crow is my favorite movie.
I:272;54;In my opinion, this is one of the greatest movies ever made on so many levels .
I:272;55;story, casting, directing, editing, to name just a few .
I:272;56;I'd give it ten stars if it were possible.
I:272;57;The story was translated wonderfully from the comics.
I:272;58;I loved the movie and how he got back at everyone.
I:272;59;THis is a great cult classic.
I:272;60;It's a very dark movie, but very good.
I:272;61;I loved this movie so much.
I:272;62;I remember sneaking into theater in 94 to see it.
I:272;63;Of all the movie of the crow this the best one the only one I like.
I:272;64;He made he best crow then anyone else.
I:272;65;The Crow was a wonderful story both in comic print and transfered well onto screen.
I:272;66;This movie is one of my all time favorite films.
I:272;67;The story is excellent, the acting is superb, and the use of several genres rings true in this film.
I:272;68;The horror aspect (back from the dead) thriller (suspenseful scenes) mystery( who killed them and why) and drama(boohoo ill avenge you) all fit perfectly.
I:272;69;This film comes highly recommended.
I:272;70;Even though it's in color, it's shot like it was in black and white.
I:272;71;In fact, it is not much more than a B movie revenge drama, but the look is what makes it so great.
I:272;72;the other element that makes the Crow so good is the soundtrack.
I:272;73;The soundtrack is a wonderful slice of the feeling of the time.
I:272;74;The Crow's feel and music perfectly reflect that angst and anger and make an otherwise okay movie into a much better than average flick.
I:272;75;I love this movie and this edition with all of the extras did not disappoint.
I:272;76;scenes stuff perfectly complement a fantastic movie.
I:272;77;I'd recommend this in a heartbeat.
I:272;78;if you have seen it you already know it is one of the greatest movies ever made and Brandon Lee delivered a more than spectacular performance that made his name a legend.
I:272;79;my friend YOU HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED!
I:272;80;This is a must see if not for the heart wrenching love story, the magnificent fight scenes, and the dark, gothic, vengence filled plot.
I:272;81;then for Brandon Lee's last great performance!
I:272;82;This movie has always been one of my favorites.
I:272;83;Even after all these years, it still stands out as an amazing story.
I:272;84;and I wish they made more movies with a soul like this one.
I:272;85;This was a movie that I was hoping for a lot from, and it delivered.
I:272;86;i give this a two stars for the fact that it was a pretty movie, and it had some good action sequences.
I:272;87;I'll start with the worst and work my way up to the best.
I:272;88;"Some of the music is quite enjoyable: The music heard while Alex visits the grave and where the statue has a tear of blood (this is at the cemetery at night where Alex first sees his girlfriend
I:272;89;THE BEST of the series and one of the BEST films in my lifetime and in the history of films.
I:272;90;He was totally dedicated to this film.
I:272;91;Everything about this film is really just magnificently amazing!
I:272;92;And that's putting it mildly!
I:272;93;The entire cast were great and fit the roles better than anyone I know.
I:272;94;But the MVP is and always will be IMO Brandon Lee.
I:272;95;But he was intended to and you can see him for a second or two in an extended version of a scene.
I:272;96;of Featurette (I love these kinds of extras.
I:272;97;This was a great one!
I:272;98;Both fit the film well especially the tracks that appear in the film.
I:272;99;O'Barr's brutal and romantic story has been put to life with lots of respect and imagination.
I:272;100;The characters are as real as they can be in a comic.
I:272;101;This one is a favorite of mine.
I:272;102;I enjoyed watching it again and adding it to my early collection of good movies.
I:272;103;I pray The Crow has taken Brandon's soul to join that of his dad's.
I:272;104;My sons emulate The Crow and it instills truth, justice and mercy along with divinity, undying love and the immortality of the soul.
I:272;105;Its the best movie I ever saw.
I:272;106;its a movie of justice and action.
I:272;107;It was Brandon Lee's best and last film.
I:272;108;For a film of this nature, `The Crow' works rather well.
I:272;109;It is atmospheric and tense and has all the action and visual effects that drive teenage boys (and many middle aged men) crazy.
I:272;110;This supernatural action thriller survives for reasons unrelated to the action `film' and yet it stands tall on its own technical achievements, complete with stunning visual effects and a score that drips with electric style and atmosphere.
I:272;111;This is my favorite movie of all time.
I:272;112;There's been great movies like Blade, Matrix and the new movie Queen Of The Damned, but to me, nothing tops The Crow and I'm begining to think that that no movie will ever top The Crow.
I:272;113;This is my favorite film of all time, of any film.
I:272;114;It has all the elements that a great film should have .
I:272;115;"it's dark and romantic
I:272;116;He is passionate and vulnerable and utterly believable as Eric, the murdered lover back from the dead to avenge himself and his fiance.
I:272;117;His scenes with his young friend Sarah and police Officer Albrecht are touching and funny, and as well done as his physical fighting.
I:272;118;Brandon was on his way to a bright career.
I:272;119;The real life tragedy attached to this film only serves to make it even more haunting.
I:272;120;That is what speaks to me in this film.
I:272;121;I recommend it 100 times over.
I:272;122;Listen up people this movie is one of the best films i have seen it has everything you would want in a movie action, story, excellent acting and a great soundtrack.
I:272;123;As most of you know this is Brandon Lee's last movie.
I:272;124;The Crow is one of the best movies I ever seen.
I:272;125;Brandon Lee was a good actor in it and the plot was great.
I:272;126;The quotes in it were one of the best quotes.
I:272;127;This is the best Crow movie out of the rest of them.
I:272;128;The comic book was also very good.
I:272;129;The gothic setting in the story is also great.
I:272;130;Okay, this is a definitely good movie.
I:272;131;Brandon Lee was the perfect man for the role of the Crow, and of course, his untimely death lent an air of even deeper tragedy to the story.
I:272;132;The supporting cast is pretty good too .
I:272;133;T. bird, Top Dollar, Funboy, all fit their roles excellently.
I:272;134;And what's more, the soundtrack is filled with great _original_ material from some of the best alternative bands ever.
I:272;135;The graphic novel is a masterpiece of perversity and pain.
I:272;136;Her presence adds some New.
I:272;137;(Brandon Lee did do a great job, though.
I:272;138;This young man had such an incredible career before him.
I:272;139;He was about to inherit the mantle of worldwide success and stardom from his bigger.
I:272;140;The backstory of his work is heart.
I:272;141;A classic good vs evil, revenge type movie plus more.
I:272;142;Watched the movie lots of times, BUT my son in law wanted it , So I got it as a gift.
I:272;143;the Crow is a very romantic,action,battle story fill with a great historical event that Eric,the undead hero must solve with a police officer and a young kid from the streets.
I:272;144;My son loves The Crow and Brandon and Bruce Lee.
I:272;145;labeled the best one, and the 4th Crow movie.
I:272;146;And I just gotta say, I was pretty disappointed with both, but especially this one, which has been labeled the best Crow film and it's soooooo good and a must see etc etc etc.
I:272;147;Needless to say, my expectations for this film is pretty high.
I:272;148;Brandon Lee, on the other hand, fully embraced his power to create havoc, and was pretty sadistic most of the time throughout the film(especially when he was telling people to shoot him.
I:272;149;So needless to say, this move definitely had the best action.
I:272;150;And I pretty much mean the villains.
I:272;151;this was the first film, and I know about the first initial biase over everything in most people.
I:272;152;"so basically this was the first crow movie, people loved it(there was this saying that ""it's always the first one that is the best one"" but it's just not true, it's because of the first."
I:272;153;the master creater of dark themes.
I:272;154;So it's understandable, but that's pretty much proving what I've always observed.
I:272;155;When I learned Brandon Lee was Bruce Lee's son and this was his last picture I knew I had to have it.
I:272;156;The film itself is imaginative and really entertaining.
I:272;157;I admire Brandon Lee, rest his soul.
I:272;158;I enjoyed it and then remembered a movie came out with the same name.
I:272;159;the movie was good, a bit on the dark side but those kind of movies are like that, just think of Batman, dark scenes.
I:272;160;i ejoyed it and I'll most likely watch it again
I:272;161;The film was a modern Gothic style.
I:272;162;fest, at the height of the Gothic movement.
I:272;163;But it has so much more than style that it has captured a strong following, loyal despite the years.
I:272;164;The comic and the film spoke to a youthful generation, frustrated by a culture which was ruled by apathetic adults seemingly blind to the unstoppable decline of the world.
I:272;165;How right it would feel to have the power and the motivation to do something positive for the world.
I:272;166;the comic was always depicted from a very personal angle.
I:272;167;He certainly had the look and the moves to carry it off.
I:272;168;although some of the Bad Guys were a little over the top, the main protagonist, interestingly named Top Dollar and played by Michael Wincott, was very convincing.
I:272;169;May the strongest heart win.
I:272;170;The Crow was a great movie.
I:272;171;But I've always been a big fan of his father Bruce Lee, and of his (Brandon Lee.)
I:272;172;The characters went together perfectly, you could feel the chemistry.
I:272;173;The action was constant, the scenery was perfect.
I:272;174;That was an amazing scene.
I:272;175;Even my father (Who is also more disney like me) liked it.
I:272;176;And that is a bigger surprise than me liking it, trust me.
I:272;177;So it must be good.
I:272;178;and I loved the final interview with brandon lee at the end of the credits.
I:272;179;When they played Can't Rain all the time at the end of the interview when he was talking about living every moment like it was your last, and not knowing when your time will come, it was really moving.
I:272;180;Dude had major star power and more acting potential than his old man.
I:272;181;"the Crow had tremendous impact on the Goth scene of the 90's, due to Brandon Lee's brooding acting and the Nine Inch Nails composed ""Dead Souls"" theme song."
I:272;182;Until then, this is one of the best and most unique cult flicks you will find.
I:272;183;But it is a great movie WATCH IT!!!
I:272;184;Lee's performance is powerful and poignant.
I:272;185;The Crow flawlessly blends the genres of film noir and the comic book superhero.
I:272;186;While the special effects are starting to show their age the themes of revenge and undying love are timeless.
I:272;187;This film takes a lot from the film noir genre in this aspect.
I:272;188;He craves discipline and order, while Crime boss and his supernatural sister seem out of place.
I:272;189;Laughing at the impotence of his adversaries, deeply caring for the loved ones still alive, and rebelling the status quo.
I:272;190;It is that caring that makes this movie worth watching.
I:272;191;exposition comes in the form of flashbacks, and are minimal.
I:272;192;It is rather exciting not knowing exactly what will happen next.
I:272;193;Every scene moves the plot forward, and all at a pretty fast pace.
I:272;194;The Crow will probably be on my list of movies that I will recommend to my friends.
I:272;195;Special effects aside the movie is a good on, and my only regret is that I waited twenty years to see it.
I:272;196;One of the best comic book adaptations made for film.
I:272;197;Few films will ever have a soundtrack that both improves the story and captures the mood and tone of urban dystopia from the books and from this film.
I:272;198;This movie is simply amazing and shows the true potential of Brandon Lee in his final film.
I:272;199;In a day when we're getting an overload of super hero movies left and right, The Crow still stands near the top.
I:272;200;As much as i enjoy a good super hero movie, i personally like the darker ones the best.
I:272;201;The best scenes of this movie are those that have little or no dialogue.
I:272;202;The look that Brandon Lee gives himself as the Crow is both subtle and pure evil at the same time.
I:272;203;The plot was simple yet creative and believable.
I:272;204;The first in a good movie trilogy.
I:272;205;This movie goes a way back in time yet still holds a place in movie history.
I:272;206;Movies like this are so easy to find on Amazon.
I:272;207;The Crow is mythmaking at its best.
I:272;208;The way Lee's death on set at that particular moment fit into the myth of the movie is just as much to do with the cult status of this picture, as its fantastic gothic landscape, exciting story, gorgeous score and irresistable central figure.
I:272;209;And a very small number, really.
I:272;210;How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood.
I:272;211;One by one, they are uniquely dispatched and in the process, a mother and daughter are re.
I:272;212;Alex Proyas does SUPERB job directing this very dark adventure film.
I:272;213;THE CROW is the perfect halloween flick for those who like their superheroes a bit darker.
I:272;214;The soundtrack is an unforgettable tribute to the entire decade of the 90s.
I:272;215;The visuals are both visceral and visionary.
I:272;216;And now it is being released!
I:272;217;Yes, The Crow, the one and ONLY original will be released on October 18, 2011.
I:272;218;Blaise is doing the happy dance.
I:272;219;Even the idea that I will soon have in my hands the greatest movie of all time, in the best format ever created, makes me smile.
I:272;220;Follow up:This is my favorite movie all over again!
I:272;221;Seriously, if you a re a fan, this is as close to being there as you'll ever get!
I:272;222;Just a well written and acted movie.
I:272;223;Although it is a very dark movie, the message is interesting.
I:272;224;Brandon Lee is very good.
I:272;225;This is a great 'dark and hip' movie.
I:272;226;The soundtrack is also excellent, with dark,harsh undertones of the feel of the movie.
I:272;227;Watch it for its groundbreaking special effects, efficient rock soundtrack and possibly the most agreeably gothic atmosphere ever created in a film.
I:272;228;I freaking LOVE this movie!
I:272;229;The bonus features also include a trivia game that you can play if you put this on your computer.
I:272;230;The movie has excellent fighting sequences and wonderful directing.
I:272;231;He even managed to twist in a moderate amount of comedy with his angry side, which is in my mind, true talent as an actor.
I:272;232;filled main character, out to bring justice to his killers, The Crow brings a touch of numerous emotions with every scene.
I:272;233;An enduring triumph for Lee, one that underscores the tragedy of his untimely death.
I:272;234;Anyone who likes a good action movie with some heart will love this movie.
I:272;235;Answer, a cult classic that has captured the angst of a generation and given us the quintessencial anti.
I:272;236;As another Halloween approaches the Devil's Night is about to take on a whole new meaning.
I:272;237;time and quite likely the most revered film adaptation of a comic book hero.
I:272;238;This is an amazing work of cinematography coupled with a deeply touching story.
I:272;239;Despite the high degree of death and brutality in this film it's first and foremost a love story.
I:272;240;Now eleven years since its release we can see in retrospect the profound effect this '94 movie has had in influencing the Goth Movement so prevalent today.
I:272;241;A true classic to be enjoyed over and over again!Cast: Brandon Lee (Eric Draven), Sophia Shinas (Shelly), Rochelle Davis (Sarah), Ernie Hudson (Sergeant Albrecht), Michael Wincott (Top Dollar) and Ling Bai (Myca).
I:272;242;This film is based on the classic graphic novel by James O'Barr.
I:272;243;In short, for those of you who have not seen this film, it is one of the greatest ever made, certainly the finest of its kind.
I:272;244;it is a tale of man's two most powerful and ultimately destructive elements, the capacity for love and the need for revenge.
I:272;245;The film is brilliant in its gothic, edgy portrait of a man searching for closure, yet striving to retain his humanity.
I:272;246;it was directed by Alex Proyas, who is a relatively new director, yet the most promising in years.
I:272;247;His eye for detail is complemented by his ability to meld grungy visuals with blistering action, and somehow create a curious beauty which shows in all of his pictures.
I:272;248;as a final note, the remarkable actor Brandon Lee, son of Bruce, died while finishing this film.
I:272;249;He did so only at the urging of Lee's family, and dedicated it to him.
I:272;250;With all the hype and no substance coming out of Hollywood, these films are rare and truly gold mines.
I:272;251;Was surprised how good it was with a name like the crow.
I:272;252;a really good revenge movie.
I:272;253;I ordered this film after hearing about it from some friends from my RP group, and I do not regret it.
I:272;254;The package arrived promptly and safely, in original packaging and great condition.
I:272;255;now for plot: Eric Draven's story is tragic, and his devotion to his fiancee is quite beautiful.
I:272;256;The film is beautifully shot and scripted, full of banter and dark humor that will be long remembered.
I:272;257;bear in mind that it is rated R for a reason.
I:272;258;This is one of those movies that rarely come along that gets the cult status it deserves as well as avoiding the camp that comes with such a moniker.
I:272;259;It's all sewn together with some very above bar acting and an absolutely perfect soundtrack.
I:272;260;dust this one off, drop it in and take a little time to remember a really good flick.
I:272;261;Better still if it's raining.
I:272;262;Very nice to watch it on my iPad!
I:272;263;One of the best movie's I've seen!
I:272;264;Probably a great flick if you were a fan of the comic books.
I:272;265;It's one of my favourites of all time, and I can definitely understand why it has become a cult classic.Yes, it is dark and violent and takes place in the worst part of town, but it deals with themes like love and friendship and still manages to be touching in some parts.
I:272;266;I can't quite explain why I love it so much.
I:272;267;it might be in part because it takes me back to the days when I was in highschool and grunge was cool, but it also has a great soundtrack and Brandon Lee did an awesome job with the role.
I:272;268;Actually, all of the actors were perfect in their roles, especially some of the less savory characters.
I:272;269;The dark, gloomy atmosphere of the crumbling and decayed inner city is very well conveyed.
I:272;270;If like me you have a streak of melancholy in your personality you'll probably enjoy the dark atmosphere of the film.
I:272;271;To my surprise it was a great movie that had an excellent cast, and an excellent soundtrack.
I:272;272;brandon Lee's scenes are moving, perhaps more so when in the back of your mind you know this was his last film.
I:272;273;After seeing the finished product I feel it was well done in good taste.
I:272;274;It was great to be able to find the movie through Amazon.
I:272;275;An incredible, pitch black action film starring the late great Brandon Lee gets a solid blu.
I:272;276;It is the ultimate revenge story, life after death story, and yes a breathtaking love story.
I:272;277;The timeless themes of this movie have turned it into a cult classic.
I:272;278;The bad guys are extra bad, and the good guys are extra good.
I:272;279;This amazingly talented supporting cast propel the story even further.
I:272;280;This has turned Draven into the ideal white knight, and has turned Brandon Lee himself into a legend.
I:272;281;if you have seen The Crow, you have the highest regards of it, from me at least, and I hope that that is enough to persuade you to see what is perhaps the perfect movie.
I:272;282;Such an incredible love story.
I:272;283;I highly recommend it to all of the romantics out there.
I:272;284;This is, hands down, one of the best superhero movies ever.
I:272;285;The film is written, directed, and acted flawlessly which is something one does not see very often in today's superhero films or movies in general.
I:272;286;It is very atmospheric and action packed.
I:272;287;This has turned out to be my favorite movie of all times.
I:272;288;"It actually turns out to be a love story showing that love transends through time
I:272;289;What I did see impressed me, however.
I:272;290;The DTS audio is a huge plus.
I:272;291;I'm fine with that, however.
I:272;292;The darkness of the movie, Brandon Lee, the music used, etc, all make it a great experience for the viewer.
I:272;293;Rating this movie for content and the story is an easy 5 but it's one of those movies that people either love or hate.
I:272;294;Because The Crow this is a great movie, and from what I have seen of the Blu.
I:272;295;ray release it is worth having in a Blu.
I:272;296;I'm more than happy with it.
I:272;297;I see that a few people are now selling the item through Amazon US since I posted my initial review.
I:272;298;He seemed like such a sweet man.
I:272;299;Anyway, the movie was great.
I:272;300;It's amazing the way they put the movie together without him.
I:272;301;the song at the end of the movie is kind of weird, but it was nice and sweet.
I:272;302;god Bless the souls of Bruce and Brandon Lee.
I:272;303;The art direction is brilliant, with a wonderful and creepy gothic fantasy look, almost but not quite black.
I:272;304;Brandon Lee is really charismatic and haunting in the role of Eric Draven, and not merely because of the tragic incident surrounding the film.
I:272;305;He was real star material and just totally inhabits this part.
I:272;306;after seeing the film, I did read the O'Barr comic, which is very sincere and heartfelt, but I think the filmakers .
I:272;307;in what is a pretty rare event .
I:272;308;IMPROVED the plot and characters while keeping all of the angst and atmosphere.
I:272;309;They totally honored the character of Eric and the basic idea of the avenger, the memories of his beautiful girlfriend, and sense of overwhelming grief that inhabits the graphic novel.
I:272;310;They really fleshed them out, and it enriches the movie and balances the storyline well.
I:272;311;in the film he has been transformed into a complex and compelling crimelord.
I:272;312;Michael Wincott is simply amazing in this part, playing Top Dollar as a kind of depraved, satanic, renaissance prince, and clearly having a great deal of fun with this role, especially some wonderful and very clever dialogue.
I:272;313;The very, very sick but quite sincere love story between Top Dollar and his psychic half.
I:272;314;mirror image of the pure and innocent love of Eric and his fiance, a clever idea.
I:272;315;wonderful music, great visuals, terrific acting.
I:272;316;Save some bucks and just get the one disk wide screen version.
I:272;317;the Crow is an action packed movie that moves at a quick pace.
I:272;318;But The Crow was a brilliant combination of Death Wish, Ghost and the Dark Knight.
I:272;319;It has a rather standard, staid theme of revenge, but adds to it such odd imagery .
I:272;320;This all gives the film a rich depth and body, like a robust wine, which surprisingly for all the dark imagery, goes down rather smoothly.
I:272;321;The reason the deeply shadowed film feels so good is because of its counterpoint meta message .
I:272;322;brandon Lee gives a powerful performance and it is truly unfortunate we won't see more of him, because his very natural style on this screen hints to more amazing skill that could have been his future.
I:272;323;"It's also exciting that he was willing to take on such an ""alternative"" film."
I:272;324;a hint of A Clockwork Orange in that regard.
I:272;325;It has explosions purely for the sake of excitement, but the other elements of image and shadow, philosophical themes of humanity and eternal love, powerful music and hard.
I:272;326;The Crow is truly a work of art, not just a flick.
I:272;327;This movie is brilliant, and ive watched it at least 30 times.
I:272;328;This movie is filled with action, suspense, and a great acting job by Brandon Lee (RIP).
I:272;329;I have been a true Crow fan since I heard what the story was based upon.
I:272;330;Had it once before and love the booklet that comes with it.
I:272;331;Crow is one of the best movies of all time and only those who see the truth in it can truly appreciate it
I:272;332;this is one of the most original movies i ever saw about revenge.
I:272;333;Ever since I was a teenager, The Crow was 1 of the biggest movies in the history of my childhood.
I:272;334;It is amazing that this awesome movie was preserved, but Brandon would've made for an excellent action star like his father, the late Bruce Lee.
I:272;335;This is my favorite movie of all time.
I:272;336;I waited 7 or 8 years to see it and caught it at a time where I needed hope.
I:272;337;It struck me to my core back in 2001 and I have loved it ever since.
I:272;338;Bought this movie as a gift for my boyfriend.
I:272;339;This is his all time favorite movie and he only had a copy of the movie so I decided he needed the real movie with the case.
I:272;340;He was very happy and surprised.
I:272;341;The gothic setting, the kid narrator and Brandon Lee, this is an excellent movie.
I:272;342;I have'nt seenthis movie for a long time but it was just as good as I remember it.
I:272;343;The Crow is the greatest movie of all time.
I:272;344;This movie should be at the number one spot in the movie category for all time.
I:272;345;This is one of my all time favorite films.
I:272;346;The story is simple, but the presentation, style and raw emotion make it a film that will not be forgotten.
I:272;347;The almost black and white look of the film, contrasted with moments of light shining through is breathtaking.
I:272;348;I am a fan of the graphic novel, and this movie captures it perfectly.
I:272;349;And the camera shots look like comic book panels.
I:272;350;The 90's grunge soundtrack and more importantly the beautiful musical score goes a long way in giving the film emotion.
I:272;351;The acting is great all around, especially Brandon Lee who would have been a star after this role.
I:272;352;I just think the look and sound, music, work to create a almost poetic film that is both viceral and absolutely beautiful.
I:272;353;All the fans of it say it over and over: this movie has EVERYTHING.
I:272;354;a hot and sexy male lead.
I:272;355;Indeed, Brandon Lee's preformance throughout the film was exceedingly worthy, and it's almost painful to relfect on how it was on the very set of this fabulous movie that his life ended.
I:272;356;hard fan of his if I had watched any of his movies while he was alive.]
I:272;357;Anyway, the movie's feel is deliciously dark and it gives a real feel for the whole story.
I:272;358;Also worthy of mention is the soundtrack, which went with the movie nicely.
I:272;359;everything in this movie really gets felt out.
I:272;360;This is extremly enjoyable for those who can just oogle at him, which is what I did.
I:272;361;depth thing, but he comes off nicely, and it's very novel to see him dressed in something other than black leather, AND without the make up.
I:272;362;It's always odd watching the last on screen performance of an actor.
I:272;363;Watch the film based on what it tells and shows you, not the fact that it's main star was tragically killed on set and you'll find a great movie, a capable comic book adaptation and a last great performance.
I:272;364;One year later, he's brought back to life and watched over by a crow.
I:272;365;before he did the god awful I Robot, Alex Proyas envoked such a unique atmosphere to his 2 best known films: Dark City and this.
I:272;366;The atmosphere and the setting is perfectly done and matches the tone of the film.
I:272;367;Brandon Lee was good .
I:272;368;kind've reminded me of Johnny Depp.
I:272;369;And the head bad guy was very good, with a marvelously raspy bass voice.
I:272;370;believe, but the visuals are the same.
I:272;371;otherwise this is a good movie the transfer is awesome.
I:272;372;I have to say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:272;373;the setting is a dark drama that has plenty of pulse racing action, while at the same time it is also a love story.
I:272;374;Energy packed fight scenes will truly amaze you, as they are choreographed at a pace that will rarely be scene again.
I:272;375;At the same time look past the action and you will see and feel the love and the loss in this.
I:272;376;The music is also a great addition to the story, as it seems to capture the scene and only enhance it.
I:272;377;based on the comicbook of the same name, it is one of the best of such adaptations to ever be brought to the screen.
I:272;378;This pain carries over with him to the other side, and makes his eternal rest impossible.
I:272;379;So he returns to revenge the deed, so he can finally rest.
I:272;380;That trick is the ending of the movie, so that will be left out, but it stays with the mythic story line and flavor nicely.
I:272;381;He proceeds to find each involved in the slaying one by one, and exacts a fitting revenge on each of them.
I:272;382;Its the coolest movie around, so putting it on D. v. d was the best thing ever.
I:272;383;This movie makes me genuinely sad.
I:272;384;All the messages really fit what really happened to him.
I:272;385;This may upset some people but I found the movie sadder than Titanic.
I:272;386;The Crow is also a great movie with good action and the setting is great.
I:272;387;From here Eric begins seeking out those responsible for what happened a year earlier, specifically T. bird and his jolly, good time boys, as their day of reckoning has arrived.
I:272;388;i should probably mention in Eric's avenging spirit form, he's nigh invulnerable, has increased strength and agility, and can see through the eyes of his ever present feathered companion (heck, I was impressed with that whole rising from the dead trick).
I:272;389;I thought all the performers did a great job, the standouts, in my opinion, being Lee, Michael Wincott, and David Patrick Kelly.
I:272;390;Lee really seemed a perfect fit for the role not only in terms of his appearance or athletic abilities, but also in a sense he seemed to really understand and expand on the part.
I:272;391;There's a lot of action in this film, and it's spread evenly enough to keep things moving at a respectable pace.
I:272;392;The story is solid, the script believable (with some great, comedic touches), and the production values excellent.
I:272;393;rOM features including a Devil's Night Retribution trivia game, an enhanced playback track, a screenplay viewer, and weblinks.
I:272;394;It's also one of the best movies of all time.
I:272;395;20 years later I am still in love with this movie.
I:272;396;It has stood the test of time, and is still an awesome movie.
I:272;397;The picture was beautifully mastered.
I:272;398;The interviews, particularly those with James O'Barr and the late Brandon Lee made some great Special Features.
I:272;399;Bottom line is this is one of the greatest movies of all time.
I:272;400;Definetly don't watch 2 or 3 unless u are a hardcore fan but this is a stand alone classic, and one of the greatest stories ever told, to say anything else would give it away.
I:272;401;It is a great add to any collection.
I:272;402;I give this 5 stars!
I:272;403;This was a really good movie.
I:272;404;As always, the product from Amazon was excellent
I:272;405;Brandon Lee's best (and unfortunately last) role.
I:272;406;Watch this film when your girlfriend is feeling sentimental.
I:272;407;THE CROW movies are my favorite action movies of all time.
I:272;408;They are each well acted, well directed, well written, and are all beautiful in their own ways.
I:272;409;tHE CROW is one of my favorite films of all time.
I:272;410;It has great performances by Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson, Michael Wincott, and Rochelle Davis.
I:272;411;Alex Proyas was a great director for this film, showing the present in either a dark way or with lots of red with the sad flashback scenes very colorful.
I:272;412;When there is no talking, the film is still highly interesting with the fun action scenes, the great music, and the exciting, gloomy visuals.
I:272;413;This one has great performances by Vincent Perez, Mia Kirshner, and Richard Brooks (and an ok performance by Iggy Pop).
I:272;414;tHE CROW: SALVATION is another great story to add to THE CROW legacy!
I:272;415;This one also adds something fresh: a murder mystery.
I:272;416;overall, this is a great series.
I:272;417;i look forward to seeing this on Blu Ray.
I:272;418;This is the type of movie that I watch when I do not want to think.
I:272;419;Ranking it from the perspective of thought provoking, I would give it 1 star.
I:272;420;so do I recommend this movie!
I:272;421;The Crow is a haunting masterpiece of revenge and the devotion of two lovers.
I:272;422;His excellent performance in the movie may serve as his legacy.
I:272;423;The Crow is based on a comic book story.
I:272;424;The Crow is a classic story told with haunting passion.
I:272;425;Looks scary but makes you feel good about justice and life.
I:272;426;Can't believe it took years to watch it again
I:272;427;still glad I bought the set though.
I:272;428;video: The transfer is very well done.
I:272;429;In fact most Crow fans will notice that some of the effects, which were pretty good in their day, show a bit easier than they have in the past.
I:272;430;Overall, with the age of the film, the sounds is very good.
I:272;431;Still, its nice to see the Skull Cowboy scene and the extra ones with Allbrecht.
I:272;432;there is also an extensive interview with James O`Barr in his basement, which is very interesting.
I:272;433;To this day the imagery has a profound affect on me, and this Blu.
I:272;434;Even after 18 years, the movie still holds a power over me, that I simply cannot explain.
I:272;435;The picture looks and sounds fantastic!
I:272;436;The deleted scenes are great for anyone who has never seen them.
I:272;437;The funboy extended scene was also great.
I:272;438;It showed him going absolutely insane on drugs and you could see why he did the things he did.
I:272;439;Couple nice shots of Brandon though within.
I:272;440;the Jeff Most commentary is OK with some funny and interesting side stories, but he just talks and talks and talks.
I:272;441;The point of a commentary is to tell little stories about what the viewer is watching at the time AND still be able to see and hear what is going on in the movie!
I:272;442;What do you say guys, can we put our feelings aside and do something for the fans for a change??
I:272;443;rom and also it would have been nice to see Brandon's Complete last interview.
I:272;444;Even though this has been shown elsewhere, it's nice to have this stuff neatly packaged together.
I:272;445;the James O'Barr interview is good and for the first time, James really opens up.
I:272;446;He's just a little dry and uncomfortable in front of the camera, but if you can get past this, this is really pretty good.
I:272;447;The storyboards and conceptual art included was also neat to see, but ultimately a one time viewing in my opinion.
I:272;448;the last and best movie in my opinion, epic, gothic, dark drama, a classic what must be have in our collection, Brandon living forever.
I:272;449;The Crow is a stunning film, its visuals are dazzling.
I:272;450;Brandon Lee had emerged and stunned us with this great performance and if he had lived he could have had a promising and grand career as an action star.
I:272;451;The movie does turn simply into a revenge flick, but it is a quite stunning one.
I:272;452;This film features some great action sequences and Lee as I stated earlier gives a great performance.
I:272;453;Proyas released the film to honor and in tribute of his death, some where upset by this but others think it was good of him.
I:272;454;There's also use of profanity, most of which is strong, and some drug use.
I:272;455;Overall a great movie and one which should be seen.
I:272;456;Ghostbusters star Ernie Hudson gives a surprisingly impressive performance as the Police Officer who can't quite believe Draven is back.
I:272;457;Michael Wincott, as Top Dollor, is also great.
I:272;458;with the opening narrative, Graeme Revell's emotional score, fantasy, action, love, violence, comedy, and brilliant ending, this film is a phenomenon.
I:272;459;You will have to see this movie to understand just how wonderful it truly is.
I:272;460;the characters are just to amazing to describe so i won't even try to.
I:272;461;i have read the graphic novel, and i think that this is even better.
I:272;462;After wanting to see The Crow for years, I finally got it as a gift for Christmas and saw it.
I:272;463;as a first time viewing, I rather enjoyed the movie.
I:272;464;i thought Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson, and Rochelle Davis (who sadly seems only did two movies, fifteen years apart) all did a great job throughout the movie.
I:272;465;The head villain in this also did a good job at exuding and being a slimy evil crime boss.
I:272;466;bottom line, it's worth a viewing if you've never seen it.
I:272;467;I'm glad I've finally seen it because it is terrific.
I:272;468;"My best analogy is it reminds me of ""Blade Runner"" crossed with John Woo but director Alex Proyas offers enough original fluorishes that the movie stands on it's own."
I:272;469;The action is breakneck and there's a stunning goth look to the whole venture.
I:272;470;Lee distinguishes himself from his father, Bruce Lee, and his work here suggests greater things if he had lived.
I:272;471;I have seen the movie several times over the years and enjoy it every time.
I:272;472;For the first time a crystal clear version of this cult classic.
I:272;473;James O'Barr is a master of the morbid, yet poignant love story.
I:272;474;I have loved this story since it was first published in Graphic Novel form and love the role that Brandon Lee plays in the film.
I:272;475;The movie is excellent, very entertaining and the music is great too.
I:272;476;What a great entertainer he was in his respective genre.
I:272;477;This is like a cult classic for my friends and I.
I:272;478;The movie is brilliant and extremely memorable.
I:272;479;I fell in love with the story, production and visuals are great.
I:272;480;Great romantic storyline, good date movie.
I:272;481;"The sequels ruin this great work
I:272;482;This movie is simply wonderful.
I:272;483;It has wonderful action and it's a heart breaking love story at the same time.
I:272;484;The ending puts my hairs on end and I have to force back the tears somethimes.
I:272;485;A wonderful movie that has made itself quite a strong fan base.
I:272;486;Brandon Lee's performance was superb!
I:272;487;He was VERY talented and did a great job with this movie.
I:272;488;I don't think there could have been a better casting job on this movie, every actor/actress performed their characters roll extremely well.
I:272;489;The top two performances IMO are Brandon Lee and Michael Wincott.
I:272;490;Brandon did excellent as the Crow and Michael was the perfect villan boss as Top Dollar.
I:272;491;With a dark, comic book feel to it, The Crow is one of the best revenge movies ever made.
I:272;492;Even with the power of the Crow, will it be enough?
I:272;493;this is tied with another movie for my favorite movie of all time.
I:272;494;I remember watching this as a kid and thinking it was the coolest movie ever!
I:272;495;So at the beginning of the movie is a tribute for Brandon and Eliza.
I:272;496;They also done well to finish the movie with movie magic as it wasn't quite finish yet after the death of Brandon.
I:272;497;So overall this movie has alot going for it and if you have never seen the Crow before, you're in for a real nice treat!
I:272;498;I will watch this movie once a month as a rule.
I:272;499;Brandon Lee definitely gave his greatest performance in this movie.
I:272;500;film but I love them both.
I:272;501;Now, my teen loves it and she won't let me have it back.
I:272;502;LOLThe soundtrack is incredible too
I:272;503;This is one of my top 10 films, and will be packed to go should I ever time travel to the future.
I:272;504;I was upset that I ordered the blue.
I:272;505;I've loved this film since I was a teenager and I watched it again for the first time in awhile and I was yet again in awe of it.
I:272;506;Brandon Lee was amazing in his role as Eric Draven.
I:272;507;He really captured his heartache and suffering well.
I:272;508;There is one scene that always gets me and that's when Eric and Shelley meet up once more, after all that happened.
I:272;509;but over all, see this film!
I:272;510;One of the most cult movies.
I:272;511;Dramatic story, dramatic life of Brandon Lee in central role.
I:272;512;Enjoy it anytime, on the fly.
I:272;513;A smashing hit, and a nostalgiac wonder: The Crow is a wonderful action flick that just screams Awesome.
I:272;514;purchasing from the people I did, I was glad to see they sent me an excellent in.
I:272;515;It is the most powerful acting I have ever seen.
I:272;516;Normally in a movie such as this I would be annoyed by the love story aspect of it, but in this film it was so deeply moving.
I:272;517;the emotional intensity that Brandon reached was gut wrenching.
I:272;518;The pain he felt for the loss of his love was incredible and rare.
I:272;519;The other performances were excellent as well, Ernie Hudson noted especially.
I:272;520;It is a very good story if you have never seen it and you like movies that are on the dark side you owe it to yourself to see this one.
I:272;521;The story will have you from the start.
I:272;522;"justice has been served!Sadly this is the last move that the leading man ""Brandon Lee"" ever made."
I:272;523;For those of you don't know this movie is Brandon Lee's last.
I:272;524;knowing this only makes the movie darker, sadder, and more heart.
I:272;525;based on the comic book series of the same name by James O'Barr, the movie stays close to its comic book roots.
I:272;526;close shots, and stark contrasts add to the comic book feel and gothic look of the movie.
I:272;527;The music in the film, both soundtrack and songs, convey thoughts and imagery.
I:272;528;the Crow is a story of love and revenge, loss and retribution.
I:272;529;It is a portrait of the struggle between the pain of seeing the past, and the peace of gaining closure.
I:272;530;Director Alex Proyas did a wonderful job of capturing this struggle on film.
I:272;531;Ernie Hudson, here playing a cop who thinks he's seeing a ghost, delivers an even performance.
I:272;532;He brought his martial arts background and talent to this film and gave 200%.
I:272;533;He was also the movie's fight choreographer.
I:272;534;This means: sit up and watch!This movie is 80% action, 5% comedy, and 15% heart.
I:272;535;Be prepared to sit on the edge of your seat, and use up a box of kleenex.
I:272;536;this movie,brandon lee's last,is pure genius at least.
I:272;537;brandon lee's performance is chilling, swift, scary.yet also charming, cheerful, and witty.
I:272;538;around a great movie for fans of adventure, horror, action, and martial arts movies.
I:272;539;I have just seen this for the 1st time and it was a great, tear jerkier but not girly.
I:272;540;The star power passes Arnold.
I:272;541;This movie can win the award to #1 time.
I:272;542;This is an awesome movie.
I:272;543;It never rains forever, is my favorite line.
I:272;544;This is the most loved movie in our household.
I:272;545;we know every word and watch it once a month.
I:272;546;First time I saw this film, I watched it on VHS.
I:272;547;The story is beautiful, dark but powerful.
I:272;548;I highly recommend this film.
I:272;549;Nonetheless, it's great to see one of my favorite movies in such clarity.
I:272;550;Many words comes to play when it comes to this movie.
I:272;551;it is an awesome great movie with much action.
I:272;552;I'm a fan of this movie so I got to have it on blu ray!!!
I:272;553;old Saturday morning cartoon fans trying to convince you it's really an R. rated adult fantasy epic.
I:272;554;Brandon Lee is an OK actor .
I:272;555;The swearing has absolutely no rhythm .
I:272;556;"nobody swears in real life like these guys do
I:272;557;you just wanna see stuff blown up real good and a lot of fighting.
I:272;558;This is such a great movie.
I:272;559;It has the look of Batman and Batman Returns, and has the feel of all the gothic literature/films that have been seen.
I:272;560;"Brandon Lee's (sadly) final performance is a treat: he is the one and only ""Eric Draven"", and all the others are just copycats of him."
I:272;561;Pacing and direction of this film is compelling, while the wicked art direction stands out.
I:272;562;Action sequences are a must.
I:272;563;see, and the script is purely well.
I:272;564;I love this movie it is one of my all time favorites.
I:272;565;brandon Lee does a wonderful job playing the main character, so sad that it was his last one :.
I:272;566;The acting and action was excellent and the story line flowed.
I:272;567;This is a good guy vs bad story with a fantastic list of characters and lots of action.
I:272;568;Overall it's a guy type of love story that wont disappoint.
I:272;569;the bad guys in this film are also very cool.
I:272;570;the entire movie has a comic book feel, heavy on the visual.
I:272;571;it's also very sad to watch, yet the ending is liberating.
I:272;572;this also one of the few films where the soundtrack compliments the the movie, not just overwhelms it.
I:272;573;my favorite song on it is it wont rain all the time.
I:272;574;It is one of the greatest movies ever made and should receive it's due credit.
I:272;575;"I say comedy, because in parts you can't help but laugh
I:272;576;I recommend this to any movie goer out there.
I:272;577;Just watched it for the first time today (Collector's Series) and it was great!
I:272;578;Brandon was perfect for this role especially after watching the interview with the creator of the book/comic that it's based on.
I:272;579;The fighting scenes were great because they weren't over the top but yet enough to keep the mood right and show another side to Brandon's acting.
I:272;580;The movie moved at a great pace, not too fast and not too long.
I:272;581;Instead it changes names, makes the story its own.
I:272;582;Many fans will hark on this fact.
I:272;583;It's natural for such a dark comic to breed dark music but there is also a wonderful collection of soft, harmonizing music that helps the tone of the story greatly.
I:272;584;This movie, for those who love it, will live in infamy.
I:272;585;dTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 were a added bonus to a great movie as it was met to be heard.
I:272;586;So have your volume crack up and enjoy the sound track that plays in the back ground, you won't be disappointed.
I:272;587;Richard Donner started a whole new trend of comic book films with Superman and it went from there.
I:272;588;Filmmakers set out to make superhero films because they dared not just to make a great film for comic book fans .
I:272;589;but also films that they thought everyone would go see.
I:272;590;by 1994, audiences were already introduced to Tim Burton's darker rendition of the Dark Knight, and a more realistic .
I:272;591;wise) to these mirrored versions of Batman and the Turtles.
I:272;592;regardless of the box office outcome (which is still considered to be a success), Brandon Lee, the late son of the legendary Bruce Lee, gave one of the greatest comic book performances to this day.
I:272;593;This film is dark, intense and focussed.
I:272;594;It is well worth a look (unless you were a big wrap for driving miss daisy .
I:272;595;I was a huge Crow fan when the film came out.
I:272;596;I'd already read the graphic novel (comics) and was very pleased with the way the film presented the story.
I:272;597;this two disc version rocks!
I:272;598;I got it to replace my well.
I:272;599;I was surprised when I opened it.
I:272;600;disc one has the film in widescreen ratio.
I:272;601;disc two has a bunch of great additions.
I:272;602;"Since his death, it has always been amazing to me that he was mentally ""in."
I:272;603;His reference to how we all take life for granted is absolutely chilling, but it also makes me hope I have that same focus when I move on.
I:272;604;the deleted scenes on disc two are definately worth a watch for any fan.
I:272;605;You can dress up Goth and tear fother muckers apart for being the drunk, crack head, heroin, loser, thieves, and killers they are.
I:272;606;brandon Lee was born for this role.
I:272;607;He is and always will be the best crow.
I:272;608;His style, charisma, looks, the stunts and fight scenes it's all there and duct tapes your peekers to the screen.
I:272;609;the music in the crow is perfect for the feel of the movie cool songs by My Life with the Thrill Kill Cult, Cure, and Rage.
I:272;610;The fight scenes are actually fairly brief but powerful and satisfying.
I:272;611;in order to make a good action flick you absolutely must have a great villain(s) (like Darth Vader, The Joker form the first Batman).
I:272;612;The villains in the Crow are all memorable and good.
I:272;613;Great lines from the movieThe crow is a beautiful movie to watch.
I:272;614;i recommend it check it out.
I:272;615;Entertaining and fun action scenes.
I:272;616;Brandon Lee is believable in his roll.
I:272;617;I liked the special effects and the basis of the story.
I:272;618;There's literally nothing good I can say about The Crow.
I:272;619;yet 545 reviews, 426 of them 5 stars!
I:272;620;I feel this is one of those cases.
I:272;621;bottom line: the art of watching good films (Schop again, mutatis mutandis) consists in not watching bad ones .
I:272;622;We really appreciate your help on the return.
I:272;623;I gave this as a gift.
I:272;624;However with that said, always loved the movie.
I:272;625;My brother received this as a gift and i knew he wanted it in this format.
I:272;626;Brandon lee is always gonna be the original.
I:272;627;This is a great film and an awesome story of love an how much it should mean to everyone.
I:272;628;I have waited quite a while to write a review of THE CROW.
I:272;629;The characters are real, yet they seem to exist in a very unreal world, and there is its strength, its life.
I:272;630;Brandon Lee's Eric Draven is such a powerful, subtle, vengeful, remorseful and tragic figure that he is almost hard to watch.
I:272;631;Brandon Lee's Eric Draven is the heart, body and soul of THE CROW.
I:272;632;ray plus a good system makes the all.
I:272;633;time great soundtrack really rock the house.
I:272;634;I have seen this movie a 100 times and it is still awesome.
I:272;635;The movie had a good storyline, plot and acting.
I:272;636;This is One Of the best ACTION FILMS EVER!
I:272;637;Was a gift for my son.
I:272;638;It made a great effect to the movie.
I:272;639;the price was reasonable and i got the movie quick through the mail overall the service and product is/was great.
I:272;640;Remembered mostly for Brandon Lee's untimely and accidental death while filming, The Crow is a visually compelling movie.
I:272;641;Brandon Lee did an excellent job, exuding angst, pain and revenge in this chilling tale.
I:272;642;It's amazing to see how the remaining scenes were completed, and most of the film had already been shot when Mr. Lee was accidentally killed.
I:272;643;But their life of happiness comes to an end when three thugs came in killed the happy couple.
I:272;644;this rated R has graphic scenes, langauage and nudity.
I:272;645;Honestly i was a little uncomfortable but i still give it a good rating because it deserved it, it has good moral value of how strong love is, to make the wrong things right as it was meant to be.
I:272;646;What is undisputed is that this movie has an eerie power all its own in spite of the much talked about tragedy.
I:272;647;Draven is ruthless, but very likable and sympathetic.
I:272;648;Everything is dark and ominous and Draven fits right into the scenery.
I:272;649;The movie is at its heart a love story between Draven and his fiancee.
I:272;650;this movie about death and love has taken on a life of its own with events, yet it possibly is the greatest tribute to Brandon Lee as an actor that he could have.
I:272;651;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:272;652;It is the only movie that can excite me, put me on the edge of my seat, and make me cry all in the same hour and forty five minutes.
I:272;653;It has everything from incredible fight scenes to a heartbreaking finale.
I:272;654;Brandon Lee gives a flawless performance in his final film that would have sky.
I:272;655;One by one Eric makes his way down the line, with the help of a sympathetic cop, killing the thugs and finding his way to their leader who chooses who they kill.
I:272;656;Eric has two days to make things right before he returns to the grave, can he make it?
I:272;657;I highly recommend that you watch and see for yourself.
I:272;658;Without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever seen.
I:272;659;very much and this one is one of my favorite movie.
I:272;660;Most of the reviews on Amazon are excellent ones but I have to disagree.
I:272;661;Alex Proyas is an excellent director but this is his weakest effort of the 2 movies of his that I have seen.
I:272;662;Dark City is a masterpiece digging into your minds days after you watch it.
I:272;663;Batman is Barney compared to this.
I:272;664;But, I like superhero movies, as they deliver good laughs and awesome fights.
I:272;665;Superhero movies are the easiest to make because they're croud pleasing as long as they have cool fights and awesome visuals.
I:272;666;But, Blade had curse words and lots of violence but I still loved it.
I:272;667;the movie is fun and exciting at times but most of the time, it's weird, really violent and way too dark.
I:272;668;I'm sure he's drugged up in the movie!
I:272;669;Sure it's cool looking but he must be high.
I:272;670;They all are predictable, they all have tons of problems but most are likeable.
I:272;671;Love The Crow and love the PSP.
I:272;672;What more do I have to say.
I:272;673;The film is directed with style and mood, which makes up for the usually heavy.
I:272;674;Brandon Lee of course totally embodies the character of Draven and is the glue that makes the film work.
I:272;675;The most interesting for me, was the interview with O'Barr which gives insight into his motives and reasons for doing what he does and has done.
I:272;676;This movie was a great watch.
I:272;677;The shots (no pun intended) and angles were great, and the script was well written.
I:272;678;This was one of the few movies that actually made me care about the characters because they were well developed.
I:272;679;This is the best movie to ever be adapted from a comic book, and it stays true to the comic's style, unlike Batman , which wasn't like the comic book.
I:272;680;Great film, I can't praise it enough.
I:272;681;top characters that in some ways over over.
I:272;682;That is how I feel about my girlfriend because we have together real love and we will be together forever.
I:272;683;So if you like a movie with drama, lots of action, great gun fight scene (scene being where Brandon Lee lost his life because of the real bullet in one of the guns), and mutiple visuals that will take your breathe away.
I:272;684;Another scene I enjoy lot was him walking into the Church great visual.
I:272;685;But for being a dark movie with lots of bad elements it is by far a very powerful movie and will keep your intrest from start to finish, bonus note to add the soundtrack is as amazing as the movie so pick that up as well with the movie.
I:272;686;The Crow is definitely a cult classic film.
I:272;687;This is one of my favorite films of all time.
I:272;688;I bought this during the Black Friday week deals, so I was able to snatch it up for $4.99.
I:272;689;The extras was good, but I excpected to see something about Brondon Lee's death.
I:272;690;God I love this film sssooo much.
I:272;691;The first film is fantastic,and so are the others.
I:272;692;i feel that their based on about a persons feelings of pain in life and it's effects on their emotions of their everyday lives that maybe a constant strugle even for victims of past abuse or trauma's.
I:272;693;because honestly about these movies they somewhat have a true meaning and purpose in life as we know it,for the simple fact that some of the tragies in these movies could very well happen to us if you think honestly think about it.
I:272;694;A classic tale of good and evil where almost everything is black or white.
I:272;695;A good mix of cops and robbers and the super natural.
I:272;696;One of my favorites martial arts movies, good story, acting and characters.
I:272;697;She puts a bunch of flowers on Shelly's and a white rose on Eric's.
I:272;698;Later the ground is lifting above Eric's grave.
I:272;699;this film is gritty, rainy and dark.
I:272;700;It sets the mood real well.
I:272;701;But I do enjoy the long, continuous scenes as you fly like The Crow.
I:272;702;in to make new scenes to finish the film.
I:272;703;I had heard lots about the movie and I decided to give it a try.
I:272;704;I was taken in by the beauty that this film creates.
I:272;705;It presents such a well written and original story line.
I:272;706;The acting is absolutely superb.
I:272;707;The special features are also incredible on this film.
I:272;708;"They give you a real indepth look at the making of the movie and will satisfy any fan of ""special features in movies."
I:272;709;this is one of me and my girlfriends favorite movies.
I:272;710;i have shown this film to many of my friends and they all loved it.
I:272;711;I will give my gurantee that you will watch this movie and enjoy it just as much as I have the very first time I watched it.
I:272;712;This feeling will come back to you each and everytime you watch this marvelous film.
I:272;713;I think this is probably the best way to go into a movie, and I was very pleased.
I:272;714;the movie's artistic direction, along with Brandon Lee's performance, make The Crow enjoyable for the entire 2 hours, and the action and violence keeps you glued to the screen.
I:272;715;directed scenes, and remains very enjoyable.
I:272;716;The Crow is less of a film and more like an amazing cinematic experience.
I:272;717;Brandon Lee's beauty shines through every scene.
I:272;718;I love the tenderness interspersed with what is really a movie about revenge and grief.
I:272;719;It is a movie that creates its own world.
I:272;720;time favorite movies mostly for Brandon Lee's turn.
I:272;721;i love the crow movies especially the first one.
I:272;722;it rocks this box set rocks .
I:272;723;I love this flick, so nostalgic.
I:272;724;Funny in that weird way when it's not meant to be, but interesting.
I:272;725;i recommend this movie to anyone who hasnt seen it, and to those who enjoy the movie.
I:272;726;Brandon Lee's performance makes the movie feel around you, no matter where you are you always feel like your in the movie.
I:272;727;The movie was Brandon Lee's best performance and to me, nothing has surpassed it.
I:272;728;this is one of the best movies in the world to me and it has a great story.
I:272;729;I like it because it has something for everybody action, love story, and the coolest special effects i have ever seen, this movie should be seen by everyone and I know for a fact that you will enjoy it.
I:272;730;This movie was absolutely amazing.
I:272;731;I wish he was still alive.
I:272;732;still in my top 10 over 7 years after my initial Amazon review.
I:272;733;with a third version of Highlander 2 available, anything is possible!
I:272;734;"Of all of ""The Crow"" films made, the first was by far the best."
I:272;735;It's a great cult classic and and it was fun to watch again after all these years!
I:272;736;We absolutely LOVE this movie!
I:272;737;Loved this movie when it first came out, and loved to share it with our daughters too!
I:272;738;Great music in this film as well!
I:272;739;His acting in this movie is good.
I:272;740;I know they use a lot of CGI which is done superb.
I:272;741;Yes, the fact that he was really killed in the movie made me see it even more.
I:272;742;this is the ultimate movie about vengeance from beyond the grave, good versus evil, wrongs made right, and the power of love conquering all.
I:272;743;Eric Draven is one of the most emotionally deep characters of all time.
I:272;744;If you want to see a true artist performing a true work of art, watch Brandon Lee in The Crow.
I:272;745;Any artist can recognize the beauty of Brandon Lee's work here.
I:272;746;"Rochelle Davis's performance as Sarah was superb, despite the fact that ""The Crow"" is the only movie she's ever been in."
I:272;747;the Crow is also full of memorable scenes, and quotes.
I:272;748;"I can truthfully say that this is one of the better made films in all of the years since ""The Crow"" came out in 1994."
I:272;749;It has a special magic that I sorely miss in today's movies.
I:272;750;Painting his face up with his wife's wedding makeup (the symbolism here is beautiful, and all of it is owed to James O' Barr's masterpiece graphic novel of the same name), he possesses powers of recuperation and invulnerability to pain that can only be characterized as divine.
I:272;751;"the cinematography here is perfect
I:272;752;"In the end, we cannot fault Draven for his actions
I:272;753;This is a Shakespearean tale of absolute wrath.
I:272;754;This is a haunting, important film and more than a must see.
I:272;755;this is a superb film, perfect in every way in my opinion.
I:272;756;It is dark, graphic and I would even go so far to call this a true masterpiece of American cinema.
I:272;757;Brandon Lee plays his role with a passion, truly giving the dark feel of this film and the message behind it.
I:272;758;But this is his legacy, and it is a great legacy to leave behind.
I:272;759;I have not seen the 2 sequels yet, but I am fairly certain this is the best one.
I:272;760;I encourage you to see this movie if you haven't already.
I:272;761;i should also mention the soundtrack to the movie, which is one of the best I have ever heard.
I:272;762;My only regret about this movie is that I didnt see it sooner.
I:272;763;So I have given my opinion, and I really recommend that you see this movie.
I:272;764;If it isn't considered one already, it will go down as a true classic in cinema for the rest of time.
I:272;765;excellent 3 disc collector's set.
I:272;766;sold at a great price and arrived very quick.
I:272;767;The Crow always has beeen and always will be one of my favorite movies.
I:272;768;Brandon Lee was just amazing in this movie.
I:272;769;The film is action packed, and it is THE best directed movie ever (it only slightly beats Blade Runner), but it is also very poetic.
I:272;770;this has been a cult classic for me since the first time I saw it.
I:272;771;Visually stunning, incredibly acted and oozing with style, this is one movie no one should miss.
I:272;772;I don't know what it is about it, but great price for a great movie
I:272;773;1 of the best movies from when i was a teen i have watched this movie 500 times.
I:272;774;The Crow is an amazing feat of story telling that is at the same time disturbing and mesmerizing.
I:272;775;A little dark not really for children, great acting, great plot, atmosphere similar to batman, Its one of my favorites!
I:272;776;Soundtrack still rocks after all these years!!!!
I:272;777;The story is a strong argument for 'eye for an eye' justice.
I:272;778;Very cool all the way around.
I:272;779;I still enjoy this film.
I:272;780;It is one of those films that is fun and brings back some strong memories.
I:272;781;Always awesome to watch, high replay value.
I:272;782;I will always remember Brandon Lee's excellent performance.
I:272;783;It's the wierdest love story I've ever seen, blending fantasy.
I:272;784;In the history of screen adaptations of comic books, Alex Proyas's adaptation of James O'Barr's underground comic _The Crow_ is one of the finest.
I:272;785;I like Marvel Comics a lot and I've enjoyed most of the recent adaptations of the Marvel catalogue.
I:272;786;The film recalls all the best elements of Tim Burton's first _Batman_ film and, I think, outdoes its predecessor by quite a bit.You probably already know the plot here.
I:272;787;Exactly one year later, Draven returns temporarily to life in order to exact revenge on the thugs who murdered them.
I:272;788;dressed in Goth black and with his face painted white, he comes across as something like a vampire, something like a one.
I:272;789;man combination of Batman and the Joker, and something like the old comic book hero the Spectre (remember?
I:272;790;the cast and the script are magnificent.
I:272;791;But everybody else is good too, including the bird.
I:272;792;The cityscape is wonderfully realized, fitting somewhere between Burton's Gotham and Proyas's own Dark City.
I:272;793;On top of all that, the entire thing is lifted high into the (night) sky by Graeme Revell's otherworldly score.
I:272;794;The Crow starring Brandon Lee Is A Great movie and I owned this once before but had moved and lost it.
I:272;795;now I have it again Thanks to Amazon and the wonderful people there.
I:272;796;this movie is the best and I love it.
I:272;797;I owned the collectors edition from the box set and this was still well worth the $.
I:272;798;This is a great movie and the seller is good on his word.
I:272;799;Brandon Lee gives out his best performance in this film.
I:272;800;The Crow is also Brandon Lee's last film.
I:272;801;This is worthy of collecting just as much as Heath Ledger's final full performance in The Dark Knight as The Joker.
I:272;802;I saw the movie recently I thought it was great but not some masterpiece, I feel bad for Brandon Lee, I think the movie is poetic in a way and the story is a good one, and the STP song is good.
I:272;803;this is a very faithful adaptation to the James O'Barr comic book that even includes sequences directly from the comic book (eg.
I:272;804;I know a lot of filmmakers hate rapid cuts, but in a comic book adaptation, it fits stylistically.
I:272;805;If you ever wanted to see the greatest movie of all times this it.
I:272;806;Brandon Lee is by the far the best of all of the series.
I:272;807;This is by no means an Oscar winner.
I:272;808;well the movie blew my mind, thought the acting and directing were great one of the best comic book movies of all time.
I:272;809;Its even better on blue ray.
I:272;810;The pictures clearer and I think they added scences into the movie very cool for a huge fan!
I:272;811;One of my favorite movies is and will always be the crow starring brandon lee.
I:272;812;A film with equal parts sadness and hope, dark and light, death and life.
I:272;813;A film with the ultimate anti.
I:272;814;While that is at the heart of the movie there is so much more to it.
I:272;815;At the very beginning when the narration starts i knew i was in for a memorable and emotional journey.
I:272;816;But also full of beautiful themes if you look beyond the surface.
I:272;817;And many memorable lines which many have already quoted.
I:272;818;And excellent cinematography,performances and a fitting soundtrack.
I:272;819;On one final note of my favorite lines is delivered at the end of the movie toward the gang leader before he is killed.
I:272;820;This film is a great noir revenge cult classic.
I:272;821;The soundtrack made this movie what it is, a masterpiece.
I:272;822;This is really a great movie, and when I watch it, I can't help but think about the star of the film, Brandon Lee and the tragic accident that happened while filming the movie.
I:272;823;It's 1 of the last over the top action flicks.
I:272;824;I won't get into any of the conspiracies I'll say they're interesting.
I:272;825;"Draven has painted his face and when he's getting ready a really good son is playing ""Burn"" by The Cure."
I:272;826;Eric uses his telepathy and he finds out he's telling the truth.
I:272;827;He finally get a hold of S k an k and he tosses him out the window The Police chase after him Albercht helps him out.
I:272;828;He gives her Shelly's Engagement Ring.
I:272;829;Eric goes to the top of The Church and Top Dollar takes full advantage of Eric being weakened.
I:272;830;Closing this The Crow is an awesome movie I have a lead I care about along with 2 side characters I care about.
I:272;831;The look of the film is great the action scenes that were in here were great.
I:272;832;Alex Poryas did a really good job directing.
I:272;833;Brandon Lee did a great job in his final performance.
I:272;834;Michael Wincott did a great job.
I:272;835;Ernie Hudson did a very good job.
I:272;836;Rochelle Davis wasn't an annoying child actress and she did a good job.
I:272;837;what ensued was beautiful violent poetry, it may have been Brandon Lee's final performance but it was also his best.
I:272;838;His portrayal of Eric Draven was vibrant and amazing, what could have been a very silly supernatural revenge story became something iconic.
I:272;839;but director Alex Proyas created a masterpiece of true love, hate, revenge, and redemption.
I:272;840;The atmosphere of the cinematography was pitch perfect as was it for the time revolutionary score of hard driving alt rock.
I:272;841;The Crow is one of the greatest comic book movies of all time and if you haven't seen it you owe it to yourself to watch it NOW.
I:272;842;"If you love movies ""The Crow"" belongs in your collection."
I:272;843;This is easily the best film I've ever seen.
I:272;844;it's simply a beautiful piece of cine.
I:272;845;forever remembered rest in peace Brandon.
I:272;846;"infused action film ""The Crow"" based on the comic book created by James O'Barr."
I:272;847;Yet, the gamble paid off across the board, and to this day the movie remains one of the strongest comic book adaptations ever created.
I:272;848;Finding success with comic book inspired movies during the nineties was not the easiest of challenges to complete.
I:272;849;So, why is it that this comic book movie, dark overtones and all, was able to succeed where many others failed?Well, as with any comic book movie, one of the most important elements that must be present is a respect for the source material, and the willingness to stay as close to said material as possible.
I:272;850;paced, and undeniably entertaining action flick that succeeded despite the odds.
I:272;851;within the movie's story there are many interesting segments, as any good movie should have over its duration.
I:272;852;For many viewers I'm sure the action scenes were some of the most memorable, and of course exciting moments.
I:272;853;for two writers that had previously dealt with either crappy horror sequels or a couple of episodes for Saturday morning cartoons, the amount of solid, intriguing character development was surprising.
I:272;854;At the time, it seemed that the mind set for comic book movies was to go bigger, better, and louder with the action sequences, and if the story suffered in the process, so be it.
I:272;855;two other key aspects to the movie remaining believable and enjoyable were keeping it grounded by terrific performances and having a visually stylistic director.
I:272;856;"making performance is actor Brandon Lee (""Rapid Fire"")."
I:272;857;As Eric Draven, Brandon delivers an excellent performance that is often times full of rage, intensity and sadness, but during the flashbacks we see a fun.
I:272;858;loving and caring individual that possesses a charisma that instantly captures your attention.
I:272;859;It's that ability to convey such a wide range of emotions in a single performance that would have made Brandon a massive success.
I:272;860;Yet, in the end the sincerity and earnestness in his portrayal carried the character well beyond the flaws.
I:272;861;as for Michael Wincott's performance, his gravelly and menacing voice helped make him a perfect choice to portray the leader of the gang.
I:272;862;Displaying such an obvious disdain for anything good or righteous in this world and a somewhat twisted sense of humor provides for a chilling and memorable performance for Michael, but also an excellent villain for this type of movie.
I:272;863;then there's the terrific camera work that gave the movie an even more distinctive style, from the establishing shots of the city via the mystical crow's arrival to the kinetically.
I:272;864;charged action sequences that are guaranteed to get the adrenaline pumping.
I:272;865;Every scene was well staged and executed to deliver an all.
I:272;866;out satisfying experience for moviegoers.
I:272;867;Aside from the borrowing of the color pallet from the aforementioned movies (and even that's forgivable), Alex Proyas proved he was the right man to bring this particular comic book adaptation to cinematic life.
I:272;868;featuring a talented cast and great performances, a surprisingly well.
I:272;869;"packed with intensity, ""The Crow"" is a thoroughly entertaining action film that absolutely leaves you wanting more."
I:272;870;sound is a little better, as good as it can get with little need for 5.1 speakers.
I:272;871;Movie was just as great as I remembered!
I:272;872;It was exactly what I wanted and extremely fast delivery!
I:272;873;the first and obviously the best edition of The Crow series.
I:272;874;great action,excitement,and sadness any dark movie could ask for.
I:272;875;with alot of great flash back scences to show the many faces of Draven.
I:272;876;i give it 5/5 stars.
I:272;877;I give it 4/5 stars.
I:272;878;in my opinion a really good movie in its own right.
I:272;879;with great acting by Jodi Lyne O'Keefe among others like Kirsten Dunst and Eric Mabius.
I:272;880;i give it 4.5/5 stars.
I:272;881;Brandon Lee was a shas]dow of his father, Bruce Lees, amazing legacy of giving 100% in all that he said and did.
I:272;882;The Crow was, and always will be, his masterpiece both in life and in death.
I:272;883;When we had gotten back in the car I turned to say goodbye and bless them both where ever they may both be, and right in front of both our eyes as well as his sisters, a crow floated down with the ease of an angel and came to rest on Brandons grave.
I:272;884;I have yet to feel such a peace of well being in a grave yard again.
I:272;885;i absolutely love this film!
I:272;886;When hoodlums brutally murder them both in their apartment on Halloween, Eric is resurrected and returns to avenge his and Shelly's murderers one by one.
I:272;887;It tells everyone that true love survives even in death.
I:272;888;timed death while this film was in production, has never looked so beautiful.
I:272;889;He plays this tortured soul so effortlessly but still adds a little humor to the somber mood.
I:272;890;The action is great, the dialogue is great.
I:272;891;In a nutshell, everything about this movie is great.
I:272;892;The Crow is an awesome awesome movie.
I:272;893;It's got everything, from a love story to sword.
I:272;894;It's an excellent excellent movie, recommended to everyone except perhaps small children.
I:272;895;The Crow is an excellent movie.
I:272;896;It is a dark classic.
I:272;897;We both really liked it a lot and I became a fan for life.
I:272;898;I was deeply saddened that Brandon had died due to an accident with the prop guns, he was such a wonderful actor and a really nice guy.
I:272;899;But this movie was probably his best work, and the irony of the story and how he died was not lost on a lot of fans.
I:272;900;If you love a good dark thriller and revenge movie, you must get this movie.
I:272;901;The acting is well done and the post work for the four scenes that had to be cut together after Brandon's death were well done for their time.
I:272;902;This is 1994 we're talking about, and while CGI and special effects have come a long way in the last 18 years, this was still very well put together for its time and very much well worth an attentive viewing at the very least.
I:272;903;As dark as it was, there was still some humor that was cleverly scattered throughout the movie which kept it from being too dark, yet even the humor was dark, which was very fitting and nicely executed in the script.
I:272;904;The Special features on disk 2 are pretty cool.
I:272;905;I loved the Behind the Scenes Featurette with interviews of James O'Barr, Brandon Lee, Ernie Hudson, and others gave good insight not only of the movie but of the characters from the actors point of view and the story from an inside point of view.
I:272;906;The Profile of James O'Barr gives a lot of first person insight into his life and how The Crow and Eric Draven came to be.
I:272;907;While it is not the first movie to be based on a this medium, it is one of the first movies to take this material seriously and present it darkly.
I:272;908;The film also has a good soundtrack (rock genre).
I:272;909;There are moments of silliness in the movie and the plot has some holes, but the movie, as a whole, is entertaining and very watchable.
I:272;910;The Crow is not perfect, but its a good flick in a time where movies like it were few and far between.
I:272;911;Its a good little flick and a must have addition to any comic fans film collection.
I:272;912;Such an epic movie and every time I was it I'm brought back to when I was 17 watching it in theaters and just as I was then, a sad that we lost such a great talent too soon.
I:272;913;He's a superhero that's out for revenge.
I:272;914;this movie is a classic.
I:272;915;It has a dark and ruthless vibe, as well as a tender and warm side.
I:272;916;There is plenty of action, drama, and a bit of comedy in this film.
I:272;917;It's got a very powerful and unforgettable story behind it.
I:272;918;This is a movie that everyone needs to see.
I:272;919;This is a beautiful movie.
I:272;920;The emotions it charges are real.
I:272;921;brandon Lee did is best work, and sadly his last.
I:272;922;It is an incredibly adaptation from the comic.
I:272;923;It isn't exactly the same as the comic, but it defines itself in a beautiful way.
I:272;924;And some might say it's a movie of vengance, but I believe it is more about justice.
I:272;925;it's also just a great action movie, with some classic and freaky scenes.
I:272;926;This movie was the perfect storm of dark story meeting edgy director and then finally perfect cast.
I:272;927;Every character was played to the brink of perfection.
I:272;928;Ernie Hudson's street beat cop was a great link between the viewers and the world of burning Detroit.
I:272;929;The film is about love, a love so strong that it transcended death and gave a heartbroken spirit a chance to seek justice.
I:272;930;Its not my favorite movie, or even one I recommend to many people, what it is is a perfect storm that will never be duplicated.
I:272;931;i'm happy its finally come to Blu.
I:272;932;Packaging was great, and nothing was damaged.
I:272;933;Great product, Great service, and great price!
I:272;934;He had it all, looks, screen presence, talent and a perfect movie for many sequels.
I:272;935;"My roommate let her brother ""borrow"" it and I never saw it again!"
I:272;936;I don't watch it all that often but I rank it in my top ten favorites so I have to have it.
I:272;937;This has been one of my favorites since I first saw it.
I:272;938;The movie had a wonderful fulfillment of the gothic love story including revenge and misery.
I:272;939;The music was lovely for the movie.
I:272;940;I strongly recommend it to the average goth.
I:272;941;My boyfriend and I both got goosebumps at the sight of the action and the sound of the music.
I:272;942;A classic film that displays many layers and points of view.
I:272;943;Worth a watch, don't assume until you've seen the film.
I:272;944;extremely satisfied with this order!
I:272;945;Excellent movie with good effects and story line.
I:272;946;well worth the price of admission.
I:272;947;The movie is a touching story of love, death and revenge.
I:272;948;The movie is complete with great fight scenes and a touching moral to leave you grabing for the tissues.
I:272;949;I can't recomend this movie enough, In your life you will only see a few films that change the way you look at the world forever.
I:272;950;This is one of them, Check it out!
I:272;951;This movie is high in my Top Ten of All the World has to see this Movie list.
I:272;952;If not, you miss one of the greatest movies of all time!
I:272;953;be in real life, Eliza Hutton, and his own following of cult mourners, enthusiests, and fanatics.
I:272;954;You will live on in our hearts forever, Brandon!
I:272;955;It's simply a good movie with lots of other.
I:272;956;This movie is one of my all time favorites!!
I:272;957;The movie arrived in great condition and I was satisfied with the length of time it took to get to me!!!
I:272;958;"goth kid's wardrobe, ""The Crow"" is one of those movies that favor style over substance."
I:272;959;Its success is, however undeniable: after all, it spwaned two sequels and a TV series.
I:272;960;Now, for the movie, it's a classic tale of love and revenge beyond death.
I:272;961;The Crow is probably not one of my favorite films, but it does have an undeniable cult audience.
I:272;962;I wont get into the story but the action scenes r very good and realistic.
I:272;963;It's simply a movie about love, vengeance, sorrow, anger, and redemption.
I:272;964;I'm glad Brandon's last role was the role of his short, but wonderful life.
I:272;965;as sad as that is, we are blessed with a beautiful, moody film that can only be described as a true gothic offering.
I:272;966;James O'Barr's simple, yet completely captivating, comic set the grounds for what can easily be described as one of the best comic book movies to ever grace the cinematic world.
I:272;967;alex Proyas shot a film that easily defined his career.
I:272;968;Indeed, the film matches up to the very definition of Gothic, both in terms of the set pieces and the overall look of the film.
I:272;969;astounding in the role of Eric Draven is Brandon Lee, who was the definitive Crow, and also the only man I can ever see playing the Crow.
I:272;970;ernie Hudson, who I have always thought is an extremely underrated actor, gives us a great performance as Sergeant Albrecht.
I:272;971;He is witty, smart, clever, and extremely unique, doing things his own way and not caring what the consequences may be.
I:272;972;His eventual role as a partner to Eric is completely believable, and to see him in one of his best roles ever was a breath of fresh air.Young Rochelle Davis as Sarah also did a good job, though at time I felt that she was a little too dry, and that she didn't really know at times what she was doing.
I:272;973;It described the naivety of children, and also fit her character at times, who has seen darkness and just stopped caring about the light.
I:272;974;These two did a fantastic job in their respective roles, bringing truly evil characters to life.
I:272;975;Deleted scenes, an interview with James O'Barr, a behind.
I:272;976;scenes feaurette with some great interviews with Brandon Lee and Ernie Hudson, story boards, extended scenes.
I:272;977;The folks at Miramax gave us what will probably always be the definitive version of the film, and they did a good job with what they gave us.
I:272;978;There could be more, but I am happy with what we were given.
I:272;979;all in all, The Crow is a intense, moody film, packed with rich, interesting characters played by top.
I:272;980;Tragic that Brandon Lee is no longer with us, but we can always thank him for giving us this triumphant film, and hope that wherever he is, he knows that we have not forgotten about him.
I:272;981;Rest in peace, Brandon Lee.
I:272;982;This is based on a comic so it encompasses a classic comic plot of good vs. evil with a great approach taken on the side of the hero2.
I:272;983;Having become a cult classic, this is Brandon Lee's most memorable performance much like the Joker has become Heath Ledger's most memorable performance after either actor's untimely passing4.
I:272;984;The soundtrack is awesome and definitely sets the tone for the whole movie5.
I:272;985;What made this movie even more heart wrenching for me was the similarity in Brandon Lee's charater and his life.
I:272;986;This movie was a heart felt dedication to the couple.
I:272;987;i strongly advise watching this movie and the 'behind the scenes'
I:272;988;This movie has alot of dark and night scenes but it looks very very good.
I:272;989;The 5.1 dts sound was also sweet.
I:272;990;I've waited a long time for this movie on blu ray and It was worth it.
I:272;991;It was a good movie and I'd watch it again.
I:272;992;This is the original based from the comic by James O'Barr.
I:272;993;A gothic love story, a beautiful, endearing character, and a love that stands up to death.
I:272;994;The Crow is most likely the best film that was ever made and will be the best for many years to come.
I:272;995;A year later he comes back to take his revenge on them, and is helped by a girl named Sarah.
I:272;996;I love the Crow, great movie and the like.
I:272;997;"But when I bought it, it said that the condition was ""Very Good."""
I:272;998;Good stuff people well lets get down to itpart one was the classic it should be.
I:272;999;part three was orginal and very cool.
I:272;1000;Kept your attention right to the end.
I:272;1001;brandon Lee was a favorite of ours.
I:272;1002;Yes the Crow is a very visual film but once you get past that you find a lot more than you first thought.
I:272;1003;Alex Proyas, a fairly unknown director at this point, has done an amazing job of transfering James O'barrs comic creation from page to screen.
I:272;1004;He has created a comic book world that is full of beautiful and disturbing imagery.
I:272;1005;The film is practically black and white so when a colour does break through it makes a big impact.
I:272;1006;He directs the action and the romance with equal precision.
I:272;1007;he knows how much of each to give you and when to give you it.
I:272;1008;HE does an excellent with his actors.
I:272;1009;Which brings us onto the performances.
I:272;1010;It is a surprisingly powerful performance for someone who spent most of his previous films beating people up and giving a clever line afterwards.
I:272;1011;Action is plentiful and expertly executed by Lee but Proyas doesn'tlet it draw away from the storyline.
I:272;1012;The supporting cast all give memorable performances,especially Micheal Wincott as the head bad guy and Rochelle Davis as Eric young friend.
I:272;1013;What is a very important aspect of this film is the music.
I:272;1014;The score and the soundtrack are both perfect and set the mood and atmosphere brilliantly.
I:272;1015;The music is just as important as anything else in the film.
I:272;1016;There is no getting away from the fact that this is an action film but it is an action film with a soul.
I:272;1017;The Crow has a lot more feeling and passion than most of the so. called romantic films we get these days.You feel the tragedy of the situation.
I:272;1018;The Crow is a fantastic film and a fitting tribute to Brandon Lee's talents.
I:272;1019;This movies real strength comes not from the portrail of our hero and his fiancee wrongfully murderd and his subsiquent return from the dead to set the wrong things right (although it is very well done to be sure with strong performances all around).
I:272;1020;That part of the story is an old theme revisited many times in cinema and in literature.
I:272;1021;With the backdrop of a city and its people in decay it is easy to see how such a man might have evolved.
I:272;1022;the movie also evokes a strong sense of nostolgic longing and a very powerful emotional connection that the viewer can't help but feel to the story and the characters.
I:272;1023;Also, the fact that the dialogue is well done (another must see for quotable quotes fans.
I:272;1024;This movie has lots to go around) and even the minor figures are drawn clearly and stand as distinct characters is a major plus as well.
I:272;1025;with a FIVE STAR rating there has to be multiple layers at work that work well together.
I:272;1026;This is a wonderful flick.
I:272;1027;pervasive dark overtones are mesmerizing .
I:272;1028;unearthly justice, love that transcends the grave an overall style that is rarely seen on the silver screen.
I:272;1029;It's one of the precious few that I enjoy every few years.
I:272;1030;This film has it all: action, suspense, romance.
I:272;1031;Lee is superb in every department, carrying each trait of his character wonderfully.
I:272;1032;I've loved this movie since I saw it in the theaters.
I:272;1033;I'm sure he would have went onto other great roles and fight scenes.
I:272;1034;The film is dark and eerie, and the sound track rocks all of the way through.
I:272;1035;The extras packed into this, also make it worth it.
I:272;1036;That aside what we have here is one of the few truly great comic.
I:272;1037;the real meat of the movie is in Brandon Lee's performance.
I:272;1038;One of the few adaptations of a graphic novel that is truly worthy.
I:272;1039;a amazing film, one of my favourite, my best scene in the movie is when he is in he chucrch.
I:272;1040;The whole fact that I waited to see this movie on encore really depresses me.
I:272;1041;I never got to see it until now.
I:272;1042;It's probably one of the best ever done next to lord of the rings, possibly even better.
I:272;1043;You will mabye feel comfortable in the setting once(in the little girls house) but thats basically it.
I:272;1044;He sets out on revenge and he basically is the perfect combination of good and evil.
I:272;1045;Action, drama, a little humor, and the best set designs make this an above.
I:272;1046;average action film that is a true classic.
I:272;1047;the orignal comic and this movie are by far the best versions of The Crow.
I:272;1048;nONE of these were in any way interesting.
I:272;1049;just as the orignal comic is the best of the comics.
I:272;1050;and that is very much punchuated by having Lee brought back to life in this movie.
I:272;1051;he faces Top Doller in a final battle and gains peace in the end.
I:272;1052;he mocks the power of good.
I:272;1053;this is one of the best movies ever made.
I:272;1054;defitly a great 'superhero' movie.
I:272;1055;the best version of the Crow story Ive ever seen.
I:272;1056;the crow is definently a perfect comic book adaptation, it had everything that the comic book had and delivered a great film.
I:272;1057;i thought the way it was shot was impresive, giving a dark color to it makeing it seem black and white and the lead role of brandon lee, well done.
I:272;1058;so nice flick, i recomend seeing.
I:272;1059;friend (recommended)Oh by the way.
I:272;1060;The casting, the setting, the story itself.
I:272;1061;The movie, based around true love, focuses on Eric Draven's need to exact revenge on the people who destroyed the happiness of him and his wife.
I:272;1062;It's very powerful and, to this day, has the ability to make me cry.
I:272;1063;"As with all good movies, ""The Crow"" is more than the sum of its parts."
I:272;1064;You could classify it as action, revenge, supernatural .
I:272;1065;but it is really a love story, set against a background so grungy and gothic it looks like the Boulevard of Broken Dreams after an artillery boimbardment.
I:272;1066;that love triumphs over all.
I:272;1067;The contrast works, and while Lee may not have been a great actor, he had more charisma than he knew what to do with.
I:272;1068;Great movie, good special effects without going overboard and especially great acting from the whole cast.
I:272;1069;Definately worth having in the collection and it's the best of the Crow series by far.
I:272;1070;I mean its dark and sexy and Lee and his crow, the crow that leads him kicks bum.
I:272;1071;It kinda sucked how he died and he never got to see its great success, he was shot I think with a blank in the head, and it said that digital movie magic made it so that he appeared in the rest on the movie and there's a special edition tape that has his last interview on it).
I:272;1072;It's a classic revenge keeper flick
I:272;1073;The settings are dimly lit at times, adding to the comic book visuals of the film and there are occasional flashes of dark humor that foreshadowed what a competent actor Lee was and whose bright future was suddenly ended.
I:272;1074;A visually stunning film, that spawned three sequels.
I:272;1075;now, a new and improved version is out, and it is outstanding.
I:272;1076;That goes to show you how much better this version is.
I:272;1077;There's two disks in this collection, so that pretty much lets you know that there are plenty of extras lurking about.
I:272;1078;A very big improvement on that front.
I:272;1079;this still reamains a favorite to me.
I:272;1080;It is a masterpiece, or at least that's how I feel about it.
I:272;1081;Action, drama, suspense, and much much more.
I:272;1082;The acting is great, the script is outstanding, and the look and feel is better than ever in this new transfer.
I:272;1083;Works very well, as long as you see it as a graphic novel made into a movie, as opposed to an animation.
I:272;1084;One of the best movies of all time.
I:272;1085;Any format I can get this in I do.
I:272;1086;The Crow is one of my favorite movies and not because it is the greatest movie I have ever seen (it isn't) but because it holds a very special place in my heart.
I:272;1087;The good guy gets revenge and is reunited with his love and the wrong things are set right.
I:272;1088;Brandon Lee is at his best in this, his last film.
I:272;1089;This is an excellent release of the movie.
I:272;1090;It was at best understated, and definitely overlooked.
I:272;1091;there is a beautiful image of love unrequited in this movie, almost of a poetic nature, but so obscure that it is hard to grasp it entirely.
I:272;1092;however, I was shocked and greatly surprised when I popped this film into the VCR and watched it.
I:272;1093;It had a great, charimatic lead actor: Brandon Lee.
I:272;1094;He had the right look and screen magnetism like Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford.
I:272;1095;anyway, what a great movie!
I:272;1096;Creativity on the part of the director.
I:272;1097;I'm sure you'll watch it several times the first day you get it.
I:272;1098;This is a great movie, E. draven(B. lEE) comes back after year from his murder to kill all the people that killed him and his wife to be Shelly(Sophia Shinas, which she does a great job in, she had more of role, but due to the death of Brandon she did not get to show off her acting skills).
I:272;1099;A lot about this movie is great, it fells real because the acting is good and Brandon Lee died filming this movie.
I:272;1100;It is well written and love seeing Brandon Lee in action.
I:272;1101;I see so much potential in Brandon in making it big.
I:272;1102;i watched for that reason to see Brandon in his last screen role, I was suprised to find that I really enjoyed this film.
I:272;1103;By the end of the movie, justice is served.
I:272;1104;I recomend that everyone see's this movie although you will probly need to watch it twice to fully understand the power of it.
I:272;1105;This is Brandon Lee's best performence.
I:272;1106;Everyone should see this movie.
I:272;1107;This was my favorite movie when I was 16 years old.
I:272;1108;I love the story, the characters, the cast.
I:272;1109;Still though, in the midst of that darkness is the love story of Eric and Shelly.
I:272;1110;Their murders spawn one of the most twisted and bittersweet revenge.
I:272;1111;is perfect as the sadistic Top Dollar, and I love the little girl on the skateboard.
I:272;1112;The soundtrack is great too.
I:272;1113;a combination of industrial, alternative, and a very haunting score.
I:272;1114;I won't give it away, but it does give you a sense of hope in this dark and cynical world.
I:272;1115;I love this movie and would recommend it as much for the drama as for the action sequences, which are good too.
I:272;1116;A beautiful tribute to Brandon Lee's memory.
I:272;1117;"The soundtrack is so edgy and the movie itself reminds you of a ""Batman"" movie except it is less ""funny"" and more intense."
I:272;1118;this is one of the greatest movies out there.
I:272;1119;ray collection and ranks among my favorite graphic novel adaptations.
I:272;1120;Great acting by Brandon Lee (don't think it would have worked without him) and gothic visuals.
I:272;1121;"based ""The Crow,"" a dark, beautifully gothic tale of violence, revenge, and justice."
I:272;1122;the Crow is a masterpiece of modern film.
I:272;1123;The first in the now popular style of dark, gothic tales of supernatural Urban warfare.
I:272;1124;The tale is cold and unforgiving, yet equally touching, and straight from the heart of creator James O'Barr.
I:272;1125;The film is dark and graphic, and perfectly matched to the story it tells.
I:272;1126;The acting is superb, the writing poetic, and the attention to detail baffling.
I:272;1127;This is a film that is truly an event to watch, as simple as the story may be.
I:272;1128;You'll also get a keen understanding of the comic and its creator, or at least, as best as you can without reading the comic yourself.
I:272;1129;Who knows what wonderful films we would have today, had that accident not occurred.
I:272;1130;As it stands however, this film will go on as Brandon's gift for generations and generations to come.
I:272;1131;The first with Brandon Lee is a blast, as always.
I:272;1132;But I expect it to be just as good.
I:272;1133;That should tell you something.
I:272;1134;I am telling you that this is a good movie.
I:272;1135;I am telling you that this is a great action movie.
I:272;1136;I have loved this movie since it came out.
I:272;1137;It, and Tim Burton's first Batman, are the two greatest comic book film adaptations in existence.
I:272;1138;The concept art for the posters is worth a look.
I:272;1139;The interview gives an interesting history of the man's life and sheds light on his reasons for creating The Crow.
I:272;1140;His story is as tragic and beautiful as the fictional story in his comic.
I:272;1141;Definitely give it a look.
I:272;1142;This is still a good movie.
I:272;1143;The center channel does great, the fronts, rears and sub all seem to cut back about 50% during the shootout.
I:272;1144;now the movie itself is my personal favorite.
I:272;1145;The genre is action but the feel is almost more of a romance.
I:272;1146;The Crow is one of my favorite goth movies ever.
I:272;1147;It is a small classic in it's own way.
I:272;1148;It is a fantasy, an action film, and a romance all rolled into one dark and disturbing, scary, sad, inspiring, and sometimes downright chilling saga.
I:272;1149;Brandon Lee is a good choice for the part of the main character, Eric Draven.
I:272;1150;He is a young and good.
I:272;1151;The story in told interesting enough through Eric's flashbacks and cop scenarios throughout the film.
I:272;1152;The final sequence in the church is a thrilling shootout to save Sarah's life after Eric tries to return to the grave to be with Shelley, his obsession.
I:272;1153;"The cop, on suspension, gets to say ""I told you so!"""
I:272;1154;It's quite a yarn, true.
I:272;1155;The revenge fantasy is very inspiring, even though the violence and the flashbacks are hard to take.
I:272;1156;Because it is worth seeing.
I:272;1157;Director Alex Proyas (who directed my favorite movie of all time Dark City) uses his great direction to make James O'Barr's classic comic come to life.
I:272;1158;Stop giving this movie a high score just because of the circumstances, does it all of sudden make this movie great?
I:272;1159;How can anyone think this is a great movie?
I:272;1160;I love movies about revenge and this one is no exception.
I:272;1161;Everything about this movie is amazing, the acting, storyline, concept, music, setting and the overall atmosphere that the movie creates.
I:272;1162;I found it amazing that the producers were still able to finish the film even after this ridiculous mishap.
I:272;1163;Fans of dark and violent films that contain a lot of action should definitely check this movie out.
I:272;1164;It was brand new and works great.
I:272;1165;This is by far the only one in the entire series that is worth watching.
I:272;1166;The visuals in this movie are great the story is a very haunting one.
I:272;1167;A great edition to anyone's movie library.
I:272;1168;What really got to me was the setting, a lawless city right on the edge of an Apacolypse, also the plot may of not sounded that new or original, but Brandon Lee's performance and character, a man so overcome with love that it was felt that his soul should of been returned, really made up for it.
I:272;1169;I cannot really explain how this movie was able to obtain such a cult status, but I assure you that this is one movie that you must see in your life atleast once.
I:272;1170;This is a wonderful film.
I:272;1171;This is one of the best movies out there, love the performance from Brandon Lee.
I:272;1172;First off this is my favorite move of all time.
I:272;1173;this movie is even more haunting because it cost star Brandon Lee hi life to bring this movie to life.
I:272;1174;he gives one of the best performances ive ever seen.
I:272;1175;and I must say that The Crow is definitely up there within my top 3 or 4 favorites.
I:272;1176;sided yet romantic person to enjoy this movie to its fullest, but even if that doesn`t sound like you, Lee`s cocky charm and the beautifully melancholy mood of the movie may just bring out those traits in you.
I:272;1177;Probably the most capturing elements of this movie are three things: the look, the music, and Brandon Lee himself.
I:272;1178;There are some wonderful movies out there in which the creators took the time to make the movie look good.
I:272;1179;and The Crow reminded me a lot of those other beautiful films.
I:272;1180;There are some pretty scenes too.
I:272;1181;one of my favorite moments is when Lee appears through a window before his friend Sarah in a sudden beam of golden light, and you`ll notice that it isn`t until then that it starts raining outside.
I:272;1182;He carries out his lines with a smooth confidence that sort of sends a shiver down your spine.
I:272;1183;You can tell that Lee really connected with his role.
I:272;1184;This is a great film despite what some say, and I doubt the fact that Lee died in the making contributed to its success.
I:272;1185;It was my favorite movie long before I even knew he was killed in it.
I:272;1186;The music is great, Nine Inch Nails, among others.
I:272;1187;I especially love the feeling that the movie gives off, if you love dark types of movies, similar to tim burton's stuff, youll like it.
I:272;1188;interviewed, Brandon Lee siad he felt he was born to play this role.
I:272;1189;Perfectly matched to the role, it was an amzing end to an all to brief career.
I:272;1190;Truly THE Crow movie to watch.
I:272;1191;Dark brooding gothic film at its zenith, with a redemptive story of vengence born of love.
I:272;1192;It is appropriate that Brandon Lee's last film should be so magnificently memorable and meaningful.
I:272;1193;Here is the essence of the shaman hero returned from the realm of death to correct profound injustice, profound imbalance.
I:272;1194;Here is the age old tale of profound evil generating an equally profound response.
I:272;1195;right before he sends them to their true judgement.
I:272;1196;i always watch this film on the night that it centers around.
I:272;1197;I consider it to be a treat.
I:272;1198;with a great sound track and an action filled plot the crow will keep you more then happy
I:272;1199;I love this movie so much.
I:272;1200;Breathtaking visuals in this emotional master piece of a film.
I:272;1201;Heartfelt and deep on many levels.
I:272;1202;This is a must watch.
I:272;1203;I saw this movie when I was 16 and just loved it.
I:272;1204;I loved Brandon Lee's martial arts action, but also his human emotions as Eric Draven.
I:272;1205;The picture was very good and dark.
I:272;1206;It's a sad, mysterious, wonderful movie.
I:272;1207;I remember seeing the original in the theater and it was spectacular.
I:272;1208;Brandon Lee did one of the best acting ever.
I:272;1209;The action was awesome, if that can do justice.
I:272;1210;That is how great it is.
I:272;1211;one of my favorite movies everyone needs to see this it is so good and if you have a psp get this
I:272;1212;This is one of my favorite movies of all time!!
I:272;1213;everything about the movie is great.
I:272;1214;Great movie, that really keeps true to the original story.
I:272;1215;Brandon Lee is amazing and its unfortunate that he died during the filming of the movie.
I:272;1216;Great dark movie I used to watch when I was younger.
I:272;1217;Awesome to watch around Halloween, and interesting to show people the scene where he actually dies in real life.
I:272;1218;Ive always loved this film.
I:272;1219;If you're looking for a great ride of a film thwn get this one.
I:272;1220;It is a great movie.
I:272;1221;This is a visually stunning, suspenseful, and action.
I:272;1222;Even though I'd seen the movie before, it still kept me on the edge of my seat.
I:272;1223;Although considered by some to be violent the film is very well done, very good acting, and good story content.
I:272;1224;The crow was the spirit of the movie.
I:272;1225;The Crow is one of my favorite movies and one that holds a dear place in my heart.
I:272;1226;i always loved this movie.
I:272;1227;It's been years since I've viewed it.
I:272;1228;It looks great on blu.
I:272;1229;That being said, it holds up very well.
I:272;1230;The action sequences are still top notch.
I:272;1231;I enjoyed the extended and deleted scenes in particular, in part because I enjoyed seeing just a few extra minutes of Brandon Lee on the screen.
I:272;1232;Great performance for Brandon, but only him.
I:272;1233;He Greatest was yet to be.
I:272;1234;I am a huge fan of the crow and it was a good cut of the film.
I:272;1235;Worth a watch and give it a shot.
I:272;1236;This movie was one of the first I watched with my husband when we met, so it has sentimental value.
I:272;1237;Brandon can do a great funny character or dark character, The Crow is so mystical and dark and his character is si finely planned ,that I had to add it to my collection.
I:272;1238;The film is a classic vengence tale.
I:272;1239;The Crow is a great adaptation of the comic.
I:272;1240;Brandon Lee breathes a certain humanity into the character that helps us root for him more.
I:272;1241;The Sarah character helps elevate The Crow beyond being out there for purely vengence, as he still has a bond with her.
I:272;1242;But it's how it's the mood that it creates and how it's so artfully done that makes the film look so terrific.
I:272;1243;in addition, this film boasts a tremendous soundtrack.
I:272;1244;Graeme Revelle delivers a haunting score that adds to the ambience of the film.
I:272;1245;The best example of how it adds to the tone is when Erik goes to find Skank and during the shootout, the sound becomes muffled with the exception of the score.
I:272;1246;It's informative, if nothing else.
I:272;1247;This movie has made millions at the Box Office, and won over many viewers' hearts.
I:272;1248;You can actually feel all the emotion.
I:272;1249;Still today, he is the perfect Crow.
I:272;1250;He will be remembered forever.
I:272;1251;Even today, with all the fast.
I:272;1252;this film was made to give Brandon Lee's last work a chance to breathe, and I'm VERY glad they completed it.
I:272;1253;Years ago, there was a TV show about The Crow that I saw on a sporadic basis, and which I enjoyed very much.
I:272;1254;It was great fun watching the movie and seeing the whole and complete story at one time.
I:272;1255;hearted movie, though there are moments of great fun.
I:272;1256;But this movie is what keeps him alive today.
I:272;1257;The action was intense, but it was the emotion he applied that gave it such greatness.
I:272;1258;The story itself carries a uniqueness that is often.
I:272;1259;times doomed to fall short in the chaos that is Hollywood, but the Crow is able to keep it as it's meant to be, retaining its beauty.
I:272;1260;The crow is great, dark, sad, funny romantic and violent they do great work on making you feel in particular ways
I:272;1261;Director Alex (Dark City) Proyas deserves credit for the finest comic to film adaptation so far.
I:272;1262;A dark and haunting film, The Crow tells the tale of a man who returns from the dead to avenge the murder of his beloved.
I:272;1263;The actual crow in this film is his link, and his source of power, between the world of the dead and the world of the living.
I:272;1264;It gives everything in it an undeniable sence of melancholy.
I:272;1265;One of those rare classics.
I:272;1266;He played his role perfectly!
I:272;1267;And the best time to watch this movie is at midnight with all the lights out.
I:272;1268;Very enjoyable, and eerie, and bring your teddy bear!
I:272;1269;It's the kind of movie you all of a sudden feel like watching again no matter how many times you've seen it.
I:272;1270;I love the music too and have the sound track on my iPod.
I:272;1271;It's very very dark and very violent, and probably not for everyone, but it's a good story.
I:272;1272;Thank goodness I decided to give it a try.
I:272;1273;He's helped by crow, and his young friend Sarah and the cop who caught his and Shelley's murder.
I:272;1274;In a sense tragic and hopeful all in one.
I:272;1275;First Film with Brandon Lee is awesome, a true classic.
I:272;1276;I knwo this would be a good movie for a real collector because this movie is a real real good movie.
I:272;1277;It has a good story line, good actors, and good music.
I:272;1278;So I recommend this movie for the viewers out there.
I:272;1279;Brandon Lee's performance is fantastic.
I:272;1280;He's dark and edgy, but still has a heart.
I:272;1281;If you don't mind a comic book movie that's dark and gritty like Watchmen or Batman: the dark knight then this is definitely the film for you.
I:272;1282;This movie is one of the best movies for Generation X.
I:272;1283;The soundtrack is an iconic look of grunge music of the 90's.
I:272;1284;The movie itself is dark, and a bit depressing, but has it's morosely humorous moments and is very quotable.
I:272;1285;this movie is a must.
I:272;1286;It holds up very well to viewing over and over.
I:272;1287;If you are a fan of the movie, the special edition with deleted scenes and making of documentary are worth the extra cash.
I:272;1288;This is one of the most moving movies of our time.
I:272;1289;He never saw his greatest work completed, just as his father never knew how well.
I:272;1290;received Enter the Dragon was, twenty years before that.
I:272;1291;bruce Jun Fan Lee 07.20.1973Brandon Bruce Lee 03.31.1993Gentlemen, you have our Gratitude!This movie is well made.
I:272;1292;While it cannot compete with the wu shu and wu xia of today, it is special in that it provides a look at Brandon Bruce Lee's early acting and martial arts skills.
I:272;1293;take time in this, the Year of the Great Serpent, Tai Shi, to learn how you can harmonize the energies that flow around you, unseen.
I:272;1294;They had to use CGI to finish this movie which is so good you cant tell its done.
I:272;1295;The second movie stank big time!
I:272;1296;I enjoyed this movie very much.
I:272;1297;This is absolutely the most beautiful, dramatic movie ever made.
I:272;1298;The scenes with the stand.
I:272;1299;in are hard to find and the ones where Brandon was brought back to life through the computer are probably the best cover.
I:272;1300;But to be honest, I think this movie carries with it so much by way of being a love story, a ghost story, an action movie and a horror movie that it should go beyond cult status and be recognized as simply what it is, a classic.
I:272;1301;This movie is a classic and never gets old.
I:272;1302;A must for the comic book fans and dark hero fans.
I:272;1303;his ablilty to pysically push himself to the edge in this movie is amazing to see.
I:272;1304;digital effect's make it possible for brandon to finish the crow.
I:272;1305;it's truly epic and a wild ride into the depth of darkness and tell's us when you have love your soul truly lives on forever.
I:272;1306;oustanding visual effects and incredible sets.
I:272;1307;this movie is a classic and should be a masterpeice.
I:272;1308;one of the best films of the decade.
I:272;1309;Exactly as it states and is brand new in plastic wrap still and at a gr8 price I am happy with it
I:272;1310;You must be kidding me!The camera work is absolutely beautiful!
I:272;1311;Brandon and Bruce are both rest in a better place!
I:272;1312;Then by it's beautiful story.
I:272;1313;Brandon Lee's portrayal of the tortured spirit is nothing but masterful.
I:272;1314;Alex Proyas's direction is both superb and haunting.
I:272;1315;The script by John Shirley brilliant.
I:272;1316;A movie that will one day be hailed as a classic.
I:272;1317;It also has a sadness to it.
I:272;1318;Losing a loved one but coming back and avenging their death.
I:272;1319;My god, filmmakers who are going to make a comic book film need to take a look at this flick.
I:272;1320;"Not only is it true to the roots of the comic, but it is a masterpiece of moviemaking
I:272;1321;this movie is the perfect movie to bring your spirits up, have a good time with, draw various inspiration from it.
I:272;1322;also, if you have a girlfriend/boyfriend break up with you or move away or someone dies or whatever, this movie is definately recommended to you.
I:272;1323;this is the best comic/superhero movie i have seen.
I:272;1324;By far the best Crow movie made.
I:272;1325;The style is gritty and very much in the style of a comic with scene and shot choices.
I:272;1326;i love the movie so I bought it.
I:272;1327;It is one of the MOST AMAZING films I have seen in along time!!!
I:272;1328;It has alot of heart and hummor which keeps viewers glued to the screen.
I:272;1329;All of the characters are exciting to watch and the storyline is easy to follow.
I:272;1330;The music is great, my favouriate tracks are 'Burn' by The Cure and 'Dead Souls' by Nine Inch Nails.
I:272;1331;But when I saw it , it had something the other crows didn't have, potential, charisma, energy, ambition, and a wonderful plot.
I:272;1332;brandon Lee delivers his greatest, and sadly his last performance of his carrer.
I:272;1333;(I'm sure this promised him a successful movie carrer).
I:272;1334;This movie does a great job of combining fantasy, drama, romance, and action it.
I:272;1335;Anyone who loves action/goth/fantasy/type movies sould definitly give this movie a shot.
I:272;1336;This movie is a must have for fans that love this actor.
I:272;1337;the tale as played by Brandon Lee works on just so many levels, and is in my view , one of the best films about Justice for victims.
I:272;1338;how many times will we see the Moonrise, how many times will the things we love happen, in other words, the moments we have are precious.
I:272;1339;lee is truly masterful in this film.
I:272;1340;It's a great movie to start with, has nice menus added for the psp version.
I:272;1341;An absolutely brilliant film, and one of the best adaptations of a book (or graphic novel, for that matter) I've seen.
I:272;1342;James O'Barr's twisted world is conveyed perfectly.
I:272;1343;This is easily ignored, though, in light of the excellent acting, directing, cinematography, etc. the Crow: City of Angels .
I:272;1344;Sarah, the little girl from the first film, returns as an incredibly hhhhot young woman.
I:272;1345;She guides Ash, the new Crow, seamlessly bringing in the mythology and spirituality of the first film.
I:272;1346;The visuals set the perfect mood, somehow transforming L. a. into a believeably dark and broken city, and the imagery and themes of the Day of the Dead celebrations running throughout the film are perfect.
I:272;1347;this boxed set is definitely worth one's time, if one can resist the urge to pick at the minor flaws .
I:272;1348;just sit back and enjoy the ride.
I:272;1349;I bought this movie for my husband as it is his all time favorite movie.
I:272;1350;He said he loved it :)
I:272;1351;I got a full refund back and they said to keep the movie and do whatever I want with it.
I:272;1352;Will enjoy it for a long time to come.
I:272;1353;The Crow has been my favorite movie ever since it was released in the theaters in 1994.
I:272;1354;I think it's exciting, brilliant, exhilarating, fairly well acted, and Brandon Lee does a great job in the main role.
I:272;1355;I also have always loved the soundtrack, with Nine Inch Nails, The Cure, Rage Against The Machine, Thrill Kill Kult, and many more.
I:272;1356;One of the best soundtracks ever put together.
I:272;1357;It's well worth your time.
I:272;1358;This is my favorite movie of all time.
I:272;1359;i love this movie more then anything in teh world its dark its got killing drugs, alocohol, awesome soundtrack and everything.
I:272;1360;He comes back and dresses in white and black make.
I:272;1361;Great action, adventure, and excellent classic.
I:272;1362;Personally i think this movie is fantastic.
I:272;1363;only certain movies can have that emotion that when you watch it,it affects you.
I:272;1364;it is and amazing film.
I:272;1365;One of the great movies I enjoyed and got at a great price.
I:272;1366;ray but will still enjoy just the same.
I:272;1367;It was in excellent conditon as promised and was an excellent price for what I recieved.
I:272;1368;He a one of my favorite actors.
I:272;1369;I remember the day this movie entered my life.
I:272;1370;The story and visuals are paked with emotion.
I:272;1371;Even today I still see people mimicing The Crow .
I:272;1372;however much like Nosferatu or brazil, its birth was amazing, original, and new.
I:272;1373;The ideas are amazing, the script is not.
I:272;1374;This movie was very important in the 90's.
I:272;1375;I love this movie, but I think it is slightly over.
I:272;1376;rated due to Lee's death.
I:272;1377;I've definitely made sure all my friends have seen it.
I:272;1378;this movie has action, suspense, everything.
I:272;1379;the story is good and it is not confusing at all.
I:272;1380;if you have not seen this movie, I recommend you see it , Right now.
I:272;1381;The film itself is good.
I:272;1382;Dark and atmospheric helps the viewer enter the world which it intended to construct.
I:272;1383;the film is a superhit It's the best I have seen.
I:272;1384;This is a tremendous movie.
I:272;1385;Entertaining all the way through.
I:272;1386;It's practical effects and visual style are amazing, no doubt but it's not going to be as well appreciated today because it's old.
I:272;1387;Love the movie and if they do a remake I will be very upset.
I:272;1388;eric has come back to avenge what happened to Shelly and himself, and now he's got the abilities to do it.
I:272;1389;He can feel the thoughts and sins of others.
I:272;1390;In fact, this has to be the first color movie filmed in black.
I:272;1391;It's alternately dark, violent, and amusing by turns.
I:272;1392;And I can imagine quite a bit.
I:272;1393;That's how I feel about it they're great movies and you don't even have to leave the house.
I:272;1394;When I heard a movie was coming out based on O' Barr's Crow I was both skeptical and hopeful.
I:272;1395;Though much of the content in the book can hardly translate to a movie made for the general public, The Crow has very much the spirit of the book.
I:272;1396;The most important elements were there.
I:272;1397;The Crow is ultimately a love story and the movie kept that.
I:272;1398;It also held onto the mood of the books, paying tribute to the gothic and the post.
I:272;1399;The other characters are well rounded and you get enough to know who they are what they are about.
I:272;1400;this is definitely Brandon Lee's finest performance.
I:272;1401;Pretty much all of the actors did a splendid job with this movie.
I:272;1402;Director Alex Proyas picked a great cast and has a knack for making the film feel grim without being depressing.
I:272;1403;not only do you have a good story put together with good plot and character development you also have a healthy dose of very cool action.
I:272;1404;While I wouldn't call this an action movie you get a nice amount of excitement sprinkled along the story.
I:272;1405;The special effects are right on par too.
I:272;1406;The digital effects are the best you will find in this era.
I:272;1407;the soundtrack gives The Crow its moodiness and does it well.
I:272;1408;Whoever picked the songs and composer knows what are talking about.
I:272;1409;modern styles and The Crow was oozing with that kind of music.
I:272;1410;the Crow is an excellent film.
I:272;1411;If you're into dark and moody stories you're going to love it.
I:272;1412;Based on the poplaur comic book of the same name,The Crow is one of the best comic book films of all time.
I:272;1413;exactly one year after their death,Eric returns from the grave and is guided by a hypnotic crow to revenge on those who killed him and Shelly.
I:272;1414;the music in the film,both the songs and the score are really wonderful and they add a perfect pitch to the film,espically the song during the end credits.
I:272;1415;while the 2nd and 3rd Crow films are just ok,this one ranks high on my list of the best comicbook films ever made,like number 2 right behind Superman.
I:272;1416;watch and enjoy this wonderful and beautiful masterpiece.
I:272;1417;Would have loved to see more from him.
I:272;1418;The original can't ever be remade.
I:272;1419;That said, I hope they make more Crow movies in the future.
I:272;1420;Plot is well paced and keeps you interested.
I:272;1421;The man is creepy, sinister, wicked, charismatic and sexy.
I:272;1422;He is the consumate villain: beautiful and magnetic.
I:272;1423;I have enjoyed your work thoroughly this past years.
I:272;1424;What a great job they did with it.
I:272;1425;The acting in this was very good supringly for a superhero horror movie with a star whose career apparantly had flustered before this.
I:272;1426;He has some classic dialog.
I:272;1427;Ernie Hudson was good as the cop who befriends Eric because he understands his dilema.
I:272;1428;The cinematography was good to.
I:272;1429;Some scenes just really have a power to them just thanks to the production.
I:272;1430;in one seen his young friend gets kidnapped and he bursts throught the church doors with this heavenly white light bathing him.
I:272;1431;The action is good in the movie to.
I:272;1432;He gets lit up with a thousand bullets and just keeps coming.
I:272;1433;this is a shootout that occurs towards the end and it is very good.
I:272;1434;When you see this it is sad to think that Lee died , because he displayed genuine talent here, and could have been great.
I:272;1435;But in the very least, the last movie he was in is was a great tribute to a talented young man who could unfortunetly couldn't continue his career.
I:272;1436;He will be remembered though.
I:272;1437;I thought that the movie was great.
I:272;1438;it was interesting and i loved it.
I:272;1439;If you like any CROW things, you will love this movie.
I:272;1440;i recommend this movie to anyone.
I:272;1441;It was a touching movie and so are all the other CROW movies.
I:272;1442;It is well filmed and while one must take leave of his or her senses in order to participate in the narrative, it is time well spent nonetheless.
I:272;1443;Good movie for the horror flick fans, too.
I:272;1444;A great movie for your PSP collection.
I:272;1445;Good title menu and controls, and adapts very well to the PSP.
I:272;1446;Highly recommend adding this great movie to your collection.
I:272;1447;packed, yet poignant tale of Eric Draven, who comes back from the grave to avenge the deaths of himself and his girlfriend.
I:272;1448;THe movie achieves a perfect balance of romance, action and dark imagery, only highlighted by the untimely death of the star, Brandon Lee.
I:272;1449;This definitely would have been a breakthrough movie for his career.
I:272;1450;one of my girl and mines favorite movies ever and now we have it on blu ray!
I:272;1451;we have made love many times with this movie playing in the background.
I:272;1452;city life in the make believe world created by Alex Proyas.
I:272;1453;It is a classic film because it possesses all of the elements that are needed to make a great movie.
I:272;1454;What i enjoy most about this film is the way it always remains dark and rainy, casting a gloomy mood throughout the film.
I:272;1455;The city in which it takes place is a seedy, grungy underground world where evil lurks around every corner.
I:272;1456;The Crow is Brandon Lee's best movie of all time.
I:272;1457;It has action and romance.
I:272;1458;It's dark, but yet, beautifully poetic film with gothic symbolism and a deep storyline.
I:272;1459;Lee's acting ability really shines in this film, where we can see him pouring out his soul in every scene.
I:272;1460;We also see his incredible physical abilities when he goes up against T. bird's gang, he truly has great martial arts abilities.
I:272;1461;The Crow will always be remembered as Brandon Lee's greatest movie, thus spawns a birth of a legend.
I:272;1462;This is a great great movie.
I:272;1463;It's a epic movie 1 of the best in the 90's it's a beutiful movie, for people over 15.
I:272;1464;As a happy, rock singer, Eric Draven (Lee) is murdered along with his girlfriend on Devil's Night.
I:272;1465;He uses all sorts of things as weapons!
I:272;1466;A police officer with his own problems helps the immortal.
I:272;1467;He avenges his girlfriend's death and gains a friendship he once had with a little girl.
I:272;1468;Brandon Lee is a legend.
I:272;1469;traditional superhero (in many ways, an anti.
I:272;1470;the film has always had the following aspects I found appealing:1.
I:272;1471;The delicious characterization of the antagonists in the film.
I:272;1472;Particularly juicy are David Patrick Kelly's Milton.
I:272;1473;The poetic justice of the villans (usually) having their own vices turned against them.
I:272;1474;The stunning incorporation of music.
I:272;1475;My love of this film goes back to before it was produced, I was one of those lucky enough to have read the original Crow comic book series by James OBarr and I knew then it would adapt to the big screen pretty easily with the right direction.
I:272;1476;After seeing the movie the first time I knew that it was only a matter of time before the sequel as it was, in my eyes, the single best comic book adaptation I had ever seen.
I:272;1477;"the main story is a rather simple one
I:272;1478;The movie, much like the comic, takes us on a ride of violence and retribution as he punishes those who destroyed him.
I:272;1479;"The man whos lives he seeks
I:272;1480;A sympathetic hero, yes, a noble dogooder, no.
I:272;1481;the music adds an incredible level of ambiance to the film with such industrial/metal/alternative sounds as Nine Inch Nails, My Life With The Thrill Kill Cult, Stone Temple Pilots, the Cure and many other incredible talents who helped make the Crow one of the best soundtracks of any film ever.
I:272;1482;i saw this in 6th grade and has been my favorite movie since.
I:272;1483;salvation was good cuz i loved the blood and gore which i love in movies like predator.
I:272;1484;It is dark with a great sound track.
I:272;1485;it is my favorite movie i am not as fond of the later movies but like to have all the movies in a particular series to keep it all together
I:272;1486;I happened to watch the TV series, with Mark Dacascos, left a glowing review, and liked it so much I had to see the original.
I:272;1487;a great soundtrack (with the Cure, a favorite band), my favorite car ('73 T. bird), and Brandon Lee dynamic and angst.
I:272;1488;And best of all, more shots in the movie than in the TV series of the crow (the bird) itself, flying, guiding, etc. more in keeping with its mystical nature.
I:272;1489;but the movie was suspenseful and jam.
I:272;1490;I thought it superior in several ways to the film, but it's like comparing apples and oranges.
I:272;1491;in other ways the film was superior.
I:272;1492;coaster ride, yes, but more thoughtful, detailed, far.
I:272;1493;We see in detail Eric and Shelley's relationship, and his resurrection.
I:272;1494;And it deviates in some intriguing ways from the film, e. g., in its treatment of Fun Boy, which spans several episodes.
I:272;1495;There was time to explore many more issues and possibilities.
I:272;1496;I thought he held his own in every way, charisma.
I:272;1497;wise, with Lee, and his martial arts skills are simply breathtaking, a thing of beauty.
I:272;1498;And, he maintained this charisma, dynamism and quasi.
I:272;1499;magical persona throughout the entire series.
I:272;1500;It definitely rounded out and deepened my Crow experience.
I:272;1501;Its tale of life lost and redeemed is perhaps the very simplest as far as movies go.
I:272;1502;If you want to see a good film skillfully done,see this one,it is very worth your time.
I:272;1503;All in all a very good film.
I:272;1504;This is such a good movie
I:272;1505;One of the all time classics.
I:272;1506;Was so happy to see that it was available on Blu.
I:272;1507;I got my order in a timely manner and it was everything they said it was, and at such a good price too!
I:272;1508;A year later, a crow brings Eric back to life as a kind of zombie in order for him to avenge the death of his loved one so that they can finally rest in peace.
I:272;1509;dollar, a decadent and incestuous monster of a man who will make his task of avenging the death of a loved one a lot trickier.
I:272;1510;one thing that I can easily say about this film is that it is one of the best looking superhero films out there, if not THE best.
I:272;1511;There's nothing wrong with that film, but I feel that using practical effects, lighting, and skillful photography works a lot better.
I:272;1512;I feel that it looks better, it helps bring you into the world that the film takes place in a lot more smoothly, and it incites more of a sense of atmosphere.
I:272;1513;Sin City is fine, but this is more my kind of thing.
I:272;1514;The Crow makes it a point to allow the tone of this story to shine through over everything else.
I:272;1515;It is a film that is, more than anything, about loss and about death.
I:272;1516;handed nature of it all and instead allows it to be a part of the story.
I:272;1517;I found this approach to be incredibly powerful, and also somewhat unusual.
I:272;1518;There is a lot of death and a lot of blood, but it all works surprisingly well in establishing the bleak, dark, and sinister atmosphere.
I:272;1519;Alex Proyas is a skilled filmmaker who has always been talented when it comes to establishing worlds, and this is a tremendous example of his visual imagination.
I:272;1520;Yes, the source material comes from the mind of James 'O Barr, but Proyas does a great job of translating those same feelings into this, both visually and also through the tone of the scenes.
I:272;1521;I like the way he uses more of a distanced sense of interest in his events and a closer and more intimate sense of interest in his characters, including his villains.
I:272;1522;Everyone in the film has their own neat little quirks, and it's so refreshing to see that in an action film, especially one like this that uses supernatural elements.
I:272;1523;i'll probably always love this film.
I:272;1524;It was the first R. rated film I ever watched.
I:272;1525;One of the most bizarre things about this film, actually, is that it's filled with graphic, gruesome death and gore, and yet it has a sense of morality to it as well as morality based lessons about love, companionship, and doing the right thing in times of darkness.
I:272;1526;Despite what many people say, this is an entertaining film that is full of over.
I:272;1527;top action, brutal fight scenes, gut.
I:272;1528;brandon Lee, while he is certainly not a good actor, has plenty of charisma, and the sadistic glee he takes in dispatching his victims is quite amusing and is well.
I:272;1529;He plays a character who, while not entirely interesting, is certainly very likable.
I:272;1530;Lee's screen presence in this film is exceptional.
I:272;1531;The rest of the cast is colorful and appropriately cartoon.
I:272;1532;I'm not sure if this is a good thing, but either way the performance of Rochelle Davis is the second strongest of the entire cast, the first being from Ernie Hudson.
I:272;1533;Ernie Hudson is an actor that has continued to impress me over and over and over again, and his performance in this is no exception.
I:272;1534;Out of all the actors in this film, his portrayal as a depressed police officer is what really elevates the material to the highest degree.
I:272;1535;He's the most sympathetic and the most honest character out of the entire cast, and Hudson's performance is just great.
I:272;1536;It is absolutely one of the best, I repeat, THE BEST nineties film soundtracks you will ever hear.
I:272;1537;Not only does it flow well with the film, but it also is the best example of the time period the film was released in.
I:272;1538;Nirvana was as popular again as it had ever been, but along with their popularity came a slew of other bands that fans of that kind of music had been clamoring for.
I:272;1539;The soundtrack to this film features some of the best of that kind of music and some of the best of this time in the nineties.
I:272;1540;It's rare to find such a perfect combination of music and mood in film, but this is one of the best examples of a nineties film that does exactly that.
I:272;1541;It's one of the best films of it's genre and one of the best action films of the nineties.
I:272;1542;In a lot of ways, it's one of the most charming films I've seen of it's type.
I:272;1543;I think that it's a very good film and that it's worth seeing.
I:272;1544;Out of all the Brandon Lee movie's I feel that this was his best.
I:272;1545;This movie has all the elements of a good movie,comedy,romance,thrill and of course action.
I:272;1546;the most of the movie is very dark and quite entertaining.
I:272;1547;I really recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good movie
I:272;1548;The Crow was certainly a landmark film of Burtonesque ambience, and has understandably become a cult classic since its release.
I:272;1549;par, particularly on the part of Brandon Lee, is being gentle.
I:272;1550;I love the feel of this movie.
I:272;1551;I happen to be a girl and also love it.
I:272;1552;Its definetley a movie anybody can watch.
I:272;1553;Everything about this set is better from the versions that were previously available to fans.
I:272;1554;The sound and picture are phenomenal, and the extras, like the extended footage feature, the behind.
I:272;1555;who knows why movie companies do things the way they do.
I:272;1556;But for now, the Collectors Edition will do just fine.
I:272;1557;This movie is mind blowing!
I:272;1558;You're on the edge of your seat the whole movie, its great.
I:272;1559;I bought this film knowing that it was considered a classic from the early 90's film era.
I:272;1560;However upon viewing it I came to the conclusion that while it is not a bad film per say, it is also more a classic due to the hype that surrounds it, versus it actually being a strong film.
I:272;1561;Its worth a watch on prime instant video.
I:272;1562;One of the best films I've seen, It's dark and hauntingly tragic.
I:272;1563;i found it surprisingly emmotional, Brandon Lee did great acting in this movie, and it's too bad he's not alive making more films today.
I:272;1564;this movie had a cool Gothic style that went great with the action sequences, I loved the story and the cast.
I:272;1565;i really recommend this movie, it's a darkly brilliant piece of filmmaking.
I:272;1566;This is hands down the best movie ever made.
I:272;1567;I can say that with confidence because it has something for everyone, love, action, darkness, and mystery.
I:272;1568;Brandon Lee is by far my favorite actor of all time, and this movie should have a lot of people agreement.
I:272;1569;I believe in destiny and I think ot was Lees destiny to not see the fruition of this film, and that added to the noir and success of the movie.
I:272;1570;As a fan of the crow mythology, I would be the first to say yes keep telling the story of the crow, but dont retell the story that worked the best.
I:272;1571;But needless to say I will be right there in the front row on opening night with my popcorn, watching the greatest movie adaption of a comic book ever made.
I:272;1572;They were still better than captain america and thor combined.
I:272;1573;an interesting storyline in and of itself, a gratifying feeling as good triumphs over evil, pretty good effects.
I:272;1574;brandon may be gone, but he could be proud of this work (and probably is).
I:272;1575;One of the best films Brandon Lee every did?
I:272;1576;My wife just loves this movie and Brandon and Bruce Lee in general.
I:272;1577;The Crow lives true too it's potential!What I liked about this movie:1.
I:272;1578;Micheal Wincott did his best performance ever!
I:272;1579;The movie had a great, dark tone to it!
I:272;1580;It was fun, exciting, spectacular,and more.
I:272;1581;my grade: A or five stars!
I:272;1582;The Crow is a fine movie, but not great.
I:272;1583;The only movie in the series really worth watching, if you like this and you should I'd look for the Crow tv series also very good and right on par with the J. O'Bar comic series
I:272;1584;This is an incredible action movie by any standard.
I:272;1585;It's played out in a spectacular way, though, set against a combination of crumbling Victorian and 90s grunge in a city that seems never to see daylight.
I:272;1586;Police sergeant Albrecht brings some sense of justice to the vengeance, and little Sarah reminds us of what needs to be avenged.
I:272;1587;Rochelle Davis, aged 14 when she played the role, put in a truly memorable performance.
I:272;1588;She managed to convey everything sulky and rebellious in a teen of her actual age, along with the strength of the young woman and fragility of the little girl that combine in her one small person.
I:272;1589;She never acted again after this movie .
I:272;1590;It also predates most of the computer.
I:272;1591;driven effects seen routinely in today's movies.
I:272;1592;The movie, though, is a stark and strong reminder of how good a movie can be without that kind of enhancement.
I:272;1593;Give this one a chance anyway.
I:272;1594;As Brandon Lee's final movie, you can truly see his conditioning as an established, seasoned actor and his heart and soul poured into a role that is emotionally charged in itself.
I:272;1595;The script is truly great at times (mediocore at others, and the ridiculous amount of bullets he has in one clip is absolutely absurd only overshadowed by the revolver with nearly 12 rounds.)
I:272;1596;The performances of the entire cast is superb.
I:272;1597;I never even knew about the comic book, but this movie is inspiring to do research.
I:272;1598;she was about as entertaining as a hot brick) You can truly feel the love that Eric Draven and Shelly felt for each other.
I:272;1599;And you ultimately feel the riveting pain of their demise.
I:272;1600;Every time I am outside and see a crow, I will always remember the movie and the words spoken in the intro.
I:272;1601;This is a great great movie that you need in your collection alongside the first two Batman movies, and The Goodfellas, and the other classics of our time.
I:272;1602;She wants to see it again some time, even though she normally doesn't like this type of film.
I:272;1603;something special about this one.
I:272;1604;I love everything about the movies.
I:272;1605;I really am more into the first 2, rather than the third one, but its a great value pack.
I:272;1606;I think the price is very good for 3 classic movies.
I:272;1607;i love all of the crow movies.
I:272;1608;each carry it's own unique beauty and art.
I:272;1609;the first crow was wonderful.
I:272;1610;the story line is beautifully done and the action scenes are crazy.
I:272;1611;the city of angels was beautiful as well.
I:272;1612;although it was nothing like the first crow, the city of angels is nevertheless great.
I:272;1613;the entire movie is very gothic, and the forbidden love story is so touching.
I:272;1614;salvation is great as well because it was nothing like the previous two.
I:272;1615;This is one of my all time favorite movie, the story is great, the acting is great, the cinematography is great, the camera tricks they used to disguise the fact that Brendon Lee wasn't in it anymore was great, and the music was great!
I:272;1616;I'm even more pleased that I bought it for such a great price here on Amazon.
I:272;1617;It came very quickly and I was able to enjoy it as soon as it arrived.
I:272;1618;I'm definitely recommending this one to anyone looking for a good tear jerking love story, with a little vengance on the side!
I:272;1619;I have always liked this movie.
I:272;1620;I like the story line that it has.
I:272;1621;I also like the characters in the movie.
I:272;1622;This is one film that does two things few others do: 1) It stays true to its source material to a great degree.
I:272;1623;2) It gives one a BETTER experience than the source material.
I:272;1624;the movie is dark and dingy and gritty.
I:272;1625;lee brings the Crow to life in a way few people could have.
I:272;1626;He is sensitive and gentle, yet otherwordly and frighteningly deadly.
I:272;1627;Eric's suffering follows him, and you can see it.
I:272;1628;When he explodes into action, the only word appropriate is impressive.
I:272;1629;Though this film is not a cheery one, it handles grief and vengeance and love very well.
I:272;1630;Michael Wincott plays his part perfectly.
I:272;1631;About a love so powerful that the destruction of it produced enough pain to bring forth the ultimate spirit of vengeance.
I:272;1632;see it once, at least.
I:272;1633;It still holds up even after all these years.
