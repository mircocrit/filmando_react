I:245;1;I still enjoy it today!
I:245;2;The girl gets the guy, the crabby crab is funny, funny, funny and the story will keep you watching to the end!
I:245;3;it should be a crime to deny a child access to this wonderful story filled with beautiful songs and vivid imagery.
I:245;4;4 year old girl loves this movie.
I:245;5;I love the The Little Mermaid.
I:245;6;As a film, it's a true gem in the Disney vault.
I:245;7;Finding Nemo comes to mind.
I:245;8;She watched it so much later that she completely wore it out.
I:245;9;The shipping was very timely.
I:245;10;The Little Mermaid from Hans Christian Andersen is one of my favorite fairy tales and even though Disney changed the story and the ending of the fairy tale to give it a more happy Disneyish ending I still really loved this animated movie and thought it was such a nice, sweet, charming movie and I really liked Ariel, also I loved the songs especially Under The Sea!
I:245;11;I reccomend this animated movie and also the Faerie Tale Theater version of The Little Mermaid starring Pam Dawber as the Mermaid, it was much closer to the classic Andersen tale and it kept the scary part with the Mermaid and the knife and the sad ending.
I:245;12;Great movie, very entertaining, one of the best I have EVER seen and Ariel is adorable!
I:245;13;The Little Mermaid is one of, if not the best movie Disney has made yet.
I:245;14;The animation is a little inferior to recent movies such as Beauty and the Beast and the Lion King.
I:245;15;In the final scene when Ariel is wed to Eric and she whispers to her father, I love you, daddy melted my heart.
I:245;16;I have yet to see another film by Disney that moved in me the same way as The Little Mermaid.
I:245;17;We enjoyed it because we haven't seen it in all time and our daughter enjoyed it because of all of the music, all of the water scenes, and all of the animals
I:245;18;This movie is the best!
I:245;19;I love how it shows a young woman overcoming adversity in so many ways and, in the end, the acceptance that her father and the rest of her people bestow upon her for being brave and choosing to do what she feels is right in her heart.
I:245;20;I think this is a good lesson for young children to learn.
I:245;21;"she's lovely though
I:245;22;But that in turn, gives her a chance to love a human.
I:245;23;For some, this part will be a true highlight.
I:245;24;the movie is more or less enjoyable from start to finish.
I:245;25;end note: Part Of Your World is a breath.
I:245;26;taking experience and alone boosts the score considerably.
I:245;27;The Little Mermaid is another childhood favorite of mine.
I:245;28;I just love this movie!
I:245;29;I highly recommend this family favorite, enjoy!
I:245;30;This movie dives deep with rich animation and lovely music.
I:245;31;i recommend this movie to all children due to the theme, lively characters and kind message of acceptance and understanding.
I:245;32;The story is perfect and the music is my favorite!!
I:245;33;"Like all the other ""Disney Princess"" movies, The Little Mermaid is great."
I:245;34;One of my favourite Disney movies along with Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.
I:245;35;This is a great movie for kids of all ages
I:245;36;taking classic children's stories and making them into grand animated movie musicals.
I:245;37;People speak with their wallets, and the animated musicals mostly hit $150 million and above.
I:245;38;My first on video was this, The Little Mermaid, which my mom had bought previously.
I:245;39;The musical numbers are superb.
I:245;40;It's almost good enough to be called, dare I say, intense?The tweaks to the story are top.
I:245;41;It flows perfectly enough without any confusion for the little ones and with enough emotion for the older crowd.
I:245;42;The voices serve each character perfectly and the length is perfect for a quick movie (around an hour and a half).
I:245;43;Of course, though, the highlight of the movie is the fabulous music.
I:245;44;I'm a fifteen year old guy who loves great movies of all kinds, and Disney's old movies are certainly that.
I:245;45;anticipated eighth addition to Disney's Platinum Collection is here making quite the splash.
I:245;46;deleted scenes, a backstage peek into the world of Imagineering, music videos, special effect demos, and song demos.
I:245;47;Getting it done has never sounded so true.
I:245;48;This movie is so great, and to me was the start of those great modern.
I:245;49;day Disney movies that we all love.
I:245;50;free and the movies and special features played perfectly
I:245;51;My grandson is obsessed with this movie!
I:245;52;He is mesmerized when he watches it!
I:245;53;Its such a great story!
I:245;54;I absolutely love this movie!!!
I:245;55;My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves this movie she watched the movie twice in one day and she totally loves it
I:245;56;It's a great movie to watch it brings back beautiful memories from past years when I was a kid.
I:245;57;This is a classic film that everyone can enjoy.
I:245;58;What I thought might just ba a kids movie was pretty entertaining, the songs, the humor, and the storyline makes you feel like a kid all over again.
I:245;59;Once again Disney movies a great family entertainment'
I:245;60;My grand daughters (ages 4 and 2) loved it.
I:245;61;this is a great movie one great thing with Disney they make all there animated movies for both boy and girls.
I:245;62;this movie has memorable songs like (under the sea) and (part of your world).
I:245;63;this platinum edition is just what i got.
I:245;64;My Mom took me to see it and I just remember thinking it was the best movie ever.
I:245;65;It had music, magic, and a princess we loved and adored.
I:245;66;My favorite character was Ariel and I loved how fiesty she was.
I:245;67;I watched it and it was a blast.
I:245;68;I am 10 years old and I still think this is the best disney movie, even though kids make fun of me!
I:245;69;Just as wonderful as I remember it being as a kid.
I:245;70;This classic Disney should be added to every kid collection.
I:245;71;a bit dramatic of course, and my son is scared of Ursula and won't watch it anymore, but he'll outgrow it.
I:245;72;some hilarious moments involving an overzealous chef and our friendly crab
I:245;73;Wonderful value on this diamond edition.
I:245;74;Was surprised to see that it came with a free soundtrack download also.
I:245;75;My daughter was thrilled with this movie and all the extras it came with.
I:245;76;I was very happy and will order from here again.
I:245;77;"The extra material actually consists of ""promos"" for the Little Mermaid ride at Disneyland and guys talking about how that ""attraction"" was created."
I:245;78;It has the best music.
I:245;79;I am such a Disney fan and to get this now was great.
I:245;80;I have loved this movie since I was a child and love that my daughter gets to enjoy it as much as I do!
I:245;81;I loved this movie as a child, and now my daughter loves it!
I:245;82;We love the feature that plays the songs when you pause the movie.
I:245;83;One of my favorite Disney movies and now my 5 year olds favorite movie.
I:245;84;One of Disney's best movies.
I:245;85;I ordered the little mermaid for my 3 year old so she knew the classics!
I:245;86;You can't find it anywhere, but this seller had it and was great to work with, I had to contact them and they were very nice and responded quickly!
I:245;87;This movie arrived in excellent condition and was a special 2.
I:245;88;Both discs played well and my granddaughter is able to enjoy the movie and dance to the songs.
I:245;89;ALTHOUGH, I LOVE THE MOVIE THE LITTLE MERMAID I definitely give that 5 to 10 stars, because I grew up on this movie.
I:245;90;For you guys to be tech savvy, you are really DUMB!
I:245;91;Because you guys SUCKS when it comes to downloadable or instant watch!This is my opinion but I will tell it like it is.
I:245;92;Disney never seems to let us down with the classics.
I:245;93;The cover was great, but the disk art itself was very silk screen looking, not vibrant at all.
I:245;94;At least the girls got to watch it.
I:245;95;The movie itself looked fine.
I:245;96;time favorite Disney music, and this is the first movie that I remember seeing in theatres.
I:245;97;Needless to say, it had a MAJOR impact on my life.
I:245;98;Big hit for Christmas for our daughter.
I:245;99;Ever since the little mermaid was released, I've known it to be a popular movie across several generations.
I:245;100;I was so excited to see it available on blu.
I:245;101;Great extras and I'm very glad I waited.
I:245;102;I Love this classic movie so much.
I:245;103;The price was right to boot.
I:245;104;this move is a classic love it since I was a kid now my daughter love it to.
I:245;105;We love watching this movie at home with the kids.
I:245;106;I bought this as a gift for my 23 year old daughter.
I:245;107;This will bring back fond memories for her.
I:245;108;with air bubbles, and burnt edges.
I:245;109;The movie works/plays, but I dont think I got a genuine Disney movie.
I:245;110;Being that it was a platinum Edition I thought I was getting something special.
I:245;111;Great movie my daughter have been waiting for but it would be better to have the chance to get the digital copy directly to her tablet so she won't need to be connected all the time to enjoy her movie.
I:245;112;I grew up on Little Mermaid, and now i am a mother of two young children.
I:245;113;ray forever so I finally bit the bullet and got it.
I:245;114;The one I received had the blu.
I:245;115;My favorite Disney movie have MANY fond memories of watching with my sister as a kid and my son will watch it with me now and says sing the songs Mommy
I:245;116;This is a classic disney movie with love versus evil, and of course the love prevails.
I:245;117;It is a great movie to add to your Princess Collection!
I:245;118;This was one of my favorite movies as a child and now my kids get to enjoy the same movie.
I:245;119;it was fast and dependable service, we got the movie really quick and we are very pleased.
I:245;120;Look forward to do more business with you.
I:245;121;This is the typical Disney movie: beautiful animation, entertaining songs, sweet story, and multiple scenes too scary for children to enjoy.
I:245;122;Got this for my nice for Christmas she was so excited.
I:245;123;"Funny story: She opened it and goes ""OHHHHHH I LOVE BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"" ha."
I:245;124;Quick delivery and a good product.
I:245;125;Picture otherwise was as good as new.
I:245;126;The Sea Witch was a bit scary for my 3 year old but otherwise a classic!
I:245;127;My 5 year old loves it!
I:245;128;It has a lot of extra features, and a new animated short that's really good.
I:245;129;Havent seen in a long time since VHS my grandson loved it and the graphics and color is super.
I:245;130;I love this movie, and even though it doesn't have all the hi.
I:245;131;tech features of the newer animated movies, it is still beautiful, with great songs and story line.
I:245;132;This is my all time favorite Disney movie, I loved this movie so much I used to watch it all the time when I was little.
I:245;133;"instead, it's love at first sight, you kind of guess Eric's personality (though it's obvious he's kind and brave), and it dosen't slow the movie down, and they do add the romantic scene ""Kiss the girl"" to really show Eric and Ariels love for each other."
I:245;134;Kiss the girl is so beautifully animated, it's one of my favorite scenes in the movie.
I:245;135;"a. long with ""Under the sea"" when I watched it, nowadays I always choose ""Part of your world"" when I sing."
I:245;136;That song is so dreamy, so perfect and tells the story that just because you got a lot of fancy stuff dosen't mean you are happy.
I:245;137;Kiss the girl is also a very good song, it suits perfectly with the beautiful scene.
I:245;138;The ending battle is without a doubt the best painted parts of the movie, I can't even imagine how many hours was spent drawing that scene!It's a good story, great songs, loveable (and not lovable Ursula) characters and beautiful animation.
I:245;139;But I'm sureonce we do, I will be dissapointed with it, as well!
I:245;140;The little mermaid is my absolute favorite Disney movie of all times.
I:245;141;I bought this one for my 2 1/2 year old daughter who loves the Disney princesses and she loves it.
I:245;142;and Prince Eric is sexy.
I:245;143;Also, the special features aren't that Platinum Edition worthy.
I:245;144;I hadn't seen The Little Mermaid in over a decade, but while listening to Disney music on Spotify, I was enchanted by Ariel's beautiful song of longing, Part of Your World .
I:245;145;Intrigued, I bought the movie online and watched it to see if it held up to how I liked it compared to viewings long.
I:245;146;i'm pleased to see that my expectations were far surpassed.
I:245;147;the story is interesting (even if it deviates from Hans Christian Anderson's original, tragic fairy tale), the characters are fun (Ariel is by far one of my favorite Disney protagonists), the songs are wonderful (who hasn't enjoyed Under the Sea or Kiss the Girl every once in a while), and the animation is beautiful (the undersea beauty here, in 2.
I:245;148;d, is just as breathtaking and wonderful as the beauty of the ice constructs in last year's CGI Disney film, Frozen ).
I:245;149;everything about this film is fantastic and memorable.
I:245;150;This movie is now one of my personal favorites, and I hope that both kids and adults will enjoy the treasure that is Disney's The Little Mermaid .
I:245;151;If you liked the original in theatres, you will love this!
I:245;152;I personally don't feel it should be her first cartoon, and I'll state my reasons for feeling that way in a minute, but I do feel she'll love this cartoon as she gets older and I'm sure I'll be seeing quite a bit of it.
I:245;153;It is truly magical, from the animation to the storyline to the infectious musical numbers that even I as a kid knew word for word, and I hadn't ever seen the film.
I:245;154;The reason I love this cartoon is that it really establishes the love between a father and her daughter, which in my case is going to be very appropriate.
I:245;155;She uses Ariel, offering her a bargain she can't refuse and thus starts her journey into the arms of the man she loves, Prince Eric.
I:245;156;ursula offers Ariel the opportunity to walk as the humans do in order for her to meet her Prince, but she must give in exchange her magnificent voice.
I:245;157;She only has a few days to win the kiss of love from Prince Eric or she'll become a slave.
I:245;158;So, with the help of her beloved Flounder and her bodyguard of sorts Sebastian she sets off to capture Eric's heart.
I:245;159;The cartoon is classic Disney at its finest, magical and moving, but due to a few mature areas I don't know if it's best suited for extremely young children.
I:245;160;I found it a bit rough myself and I'm far from a child.
I:245;161;ray disc, and we both liked the Additional Features in the menu.
I:245;162;Classic movie, happy to share it with my daughter, and it kept her occupied in the car to and from family gatherings for the holidays.
I:245;163;Loved it when it first came out and was so excited to share it with the kids.
I:245;164;totally worth the higher price!
I:245;165;I would recommend this to anyone that wants to add to a disney collection or start a new one.
I:245;166;have for Disney fans, young and old.
I:245;167;Its a classic and my daughter watched it for the very first time and loved it!
I:245;168;i loved this movie as a child and wanted my children to see this movie.
I:245;169;it was great they loved as much as i did.
I:245;170;The shipping and delivery exceeded the estimated time, super fast.
I:245;171;Colors are nice and vivid.
I:245;172;As always disney has done wonders for childrens films.
I:245;173;The little mermaid is another one of their classic movies which is suitable for all ages.
I:245;174;I loved the documentary about Hans Christian Anderson and the deleted scenes.
I:245;175;While I know that is true.
I:245;176;This movie has everything, great sound track and endearing characters
I:245;177;another clasic must have seen it as a KID and loved it so another one to add to my collection
I:245;178;The fact that Disney have released this film, one that is so important to the history of the company and is such a favourite among fans is completely unacceptable.
I:245;179;"disney have now started dealing with the issue, I contacted them about the problem and they got back to me, here is part of the email
I:245;180;if you have any other questions, please reply to this e. mail.
I:245;181;thank you for your patience.
I:245;182;walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment Technical SupportThe email address to write to is: disneyinfo@disneyhelp.
I:245;183;In my opinion, this is the best animated disney film of all time.
I:245;184;I mean, I'm a boy, and it's one of my favorites.
I:245;185;"(I also love ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" ) I was ecstatic when I found out they were releasing this as 2."
I:245;186;this film is filled with beautiful design, an amazing score, an adventerous story, and an absolutley fantastic cast (Who doesn't love Jodi Benson because of this film?)
I:245;187;"the Bonus feature that I am hoping for most (I'm sure a lot of people will agree with me on this) is recording studio footage of Jodi Benson singing ""Part Of Your World"", as they did on the Aladdin Special edition with ""A Whole New World""I'm guessing Disney purposally made this a 2006 release so that it would also be the 15th anniversary of the film."
I:245;188;so while I know it may be hard to wait for this release, lets be happy that Disney is finally giving it's greatest film the treatment it deserves.
I:245;189;A pure work of art.
I:245;190;The Little Mermaid is a must for a collection.
I:245;191;The little mermaid is a family favorite.
I:245;192;The beautiful blue ocean, the mermaids' songs, the romantic romance, were so impressed to me!
I:245;193;The characters in this movie were wonderful.
I:245;194;I love Ariel's sisters although we couldn't see them in the movie.
I:245;195;what impressed me most was the music of this movie.
I:245;196;Part of Your World was and will always be the classic to every Little Mermaid fan.
I:245;197;I feel so good while listening to Ariel's voice.
I:245;198;Under the Sea was not the best in my opinion, but it's still so classic and wonderful.
I:245;199;although I think the cover of this Special Edition is not as good as my anticipation, but things in it must be very good, and I'm expecting.
I:245;200;discovering the old Disney Animation lately due to the fact that my daughter is 2 and really enjoys them!
I:245;201;We love the story of the Little Mermaid and the version Disney presents is the best by far.
I:245;202;The extras on the special edition are worth the extra money and the restoration of the film is wonderful.
I:245;203;"We also love that the ""princess"" in the story is a red."
I:245;204;Just found out that the new 2.
I:245;205;My 4 yr old loves this movie!
I:245;206;Greatest movie of all time for the children to watch.
I:245;207;Bought for a gift for a friend because my daughter is not good at sharing and she loves this movie.
I:245;208;My boys also loved it a dozen or so years ago so it has staying power.
I:245;209;I bought it used and it is like new.
I:245;210;This movie is a classic and always will be.
I:245;211;It will always hold up to all generations.
I:245;212;And the whole thing is beautiful to look at.
I:245;213;The characters are so creative and the music is catchy and intelligent.
I:245;214;The voices are perfect for their characters.
I:245;215;One of my favorite Disney Films by far!
I:245;216;I loved The Little Mermaid!
I:245;217;The music is awesome and clever.
I:245;218;great voices wonderful to watch.
I:245;219;I love this movie because it is so fluid the animation and the story is beautiful (even though it changed the original tale of The Little Mermaid, but they do have reason why).
I:245;220;I love the oceanic settings and colors and of course.
I:245;221;Love that I can watch one of my favorite childhood movies with my niece now.
I:245;222;A great addition to our Disney Collection.
I:245;223;I got this movie for my daughter since she is starting to get into the princesses and I enjoy watching this with her.
I:245;224;I love this movie and it came quickly and in great new condition.
I:245;225;It got here so fast!
I:245;226;It was in time to give as a gift.
I:245;227;They love Ariel and I love that we were able to get this while it was in the fault Thank you!
I:245;228;When I first watch this movie I was in middle school.
I:245;229;I am a guy, even though this is a type of movie that girls like, I loved it.
I:245;230;This movie is very touching.
I:245;231;ray release brought many of those good memories back.
I:245;232;generated animation has so leap.
I:245;233;animated graphics that we found ourselves seeing the contrast throughout the movie.
I:245;234;Still, well worth owning and viewing, especially for young kiddos and grandchildren who are not familiar with the story.
I:245;235;I have always stayed away from Disney princess movies, and a major reason is because I worried about being teased.
I:245;236;So I finally decided to watch the Little Mermaid last year, and I enjoyed it immensely.
I:245;237;If you shy away from Disney movies, I would still recommend this one, while yet this is your typical Disney love story, it's still a great movie.
I:245;238;I first noticed how amazing the animation was in the Little Mermaid, the animation was a big improvement over most of the movies Disney made in the 70's and 80's.
I:245;239;The waves during the final scene are incredible for being animated and all those hand drawn bubbles in the underwater scenes must have taken forever to master.
I:245;240;The Little Mermaid also has one of the best scores for a Disney movie and the credit goes to the talented Howard Ashman and Alan Menken.
I:245;241;"if you own the Little Mermaid on VHS from the ""Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection"", I would recommend keeping it."
I:245;242;"There also is a ""Part of Your World"" music video with Jodi Benson during the end credits, which I don't believe is included with the two disc special edition."
I:245;243;very pleased, came just as advertised, my gf loved it and the digital copy was wonderful also.
I:245;244;the colors are much more vibrant and the 7.1 sound is crisp.
I:245;245;this is a great movie to pick up as most children nowadays know of The Little Mermaid, but often don't get the chance to see the movie because of the scarcity (limited release because of the Disney Vault) and now is their chance to enjoy this classic as we did when we were little ones.
I:245;246;Definitely a great puchase for me.
I:245;247;so happy I found one that I can stream online and keep.
I:245;248;Love it, the kids love it, the songs are great.
I:245;249;Its just a great story.
I:245;250;I love this movie but i was pausing on key songs.
I:245;251;I loved it then and my daughter loves it now.
I:245;252;Classic movie at an excellent price when I couldnt find it anywhere else.
I:245;253;So happy that it is now avialbile in blu.
I:245;254;a boy 6 and a girl 7 loved the movies!!
I:245;255;a. long romantic Disney favorite complete with a happily ever after :.)
I:245;256;As with all Disney movies, Its a timeless treasure.
I:245;257;Very quick, loved the extra details the seller added to the shipping packaging!
I:245;258;Cant wait to share it with others!
I:245;259;This is my daughters favorite movie.
I:245;260;We enjoy the songs and the storyline.
I:245;261;I recommend this movie for kids of all ages.
I:245;262;Children will love this movie!
I:245;263;I bought for niece and she loves this movie!
I:245;264;Songs are fun to sing along with!
I:245;265;"I guess some might prefer the ""edited"" version."
I:245;266;one of my favorite movies, along with a clockwork orange (although that movie is definately not for kids).
I:245;267;Here is the 2nd edition of Disney's most popular movie ever to come out at the very end of the 20th century.
I:245;268;centered airhead at times, she's got plenty of such beauty and charisma to whisk her all the way to a happy, happy ending!
I:245;269;It is a fact that THE LITTLE MERMAID is the highest.
I:245;270;the magic of the story, the genesis of the music, the wonderful emotions of the characters and the voice acting is simply incomparable!Even THE LION KING, TARZAN and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST didn't cross such boundaries.
I:245;271;I admire Disney's work on this one.
I:245;272;truly a masterpiece for the whole family to enjoy!
I:245;273;So this is a trip down memory lane, joy for a 2 year old, and a bit of Grandma's revenge.
I:245;274;The laugh is on Disney!!
I:245;275;This movie will always have great memories for me of when I was a little girl and used to dream of being Ariel lol.
I:245;276;My daughter just loves it and finally we can get it on Blu.
I:245;277;My little daughter loves the music.
I:245;278;It is one of the princess movies you gotta have.
I:245;279;I have always loved The Little Mermaid!
I:245;280;Theres not much to say about the video set, other than it is a great set and fully meets my expectations.
I:245;281;She watches it all the time.
I:245;282;digital is always good if we're out on the road.
I:245;283;It includes many bonus features as well and will entertain the kids, and yourself, for hours.
I:245;284;Good hearted movie and adorable under the sea characters.
I:245;285;Clean entertainment for the whole family!
I:245;286;I was just a kid when this movie first came to video, and I have fond memories of watching it every day with one of my cousins for about a month.
I:245;287;written and enhances the action while adding a Carribbean flavor.
I:245;288;The animation is classic Disney hand.
I:245;289;drawn, before the days of computers, but still very well.
I:245;290;Just what we wanted and for good price!
I:245;291;The colors were great and details stellar there are more details to see here.
I:245;292;I loved it and cherished that it was closer in colors to the original.
I:245;293;I've always been a fan of The Little Mermaid and to see it on blue.
I:245;294;ray made it that much better!
I:245;295;. . . Ariel's attitude and defiance, but it is still a touching story with great music, so my girls and I watch it on occasion, followed by lots of conversations about how poorly Ariel handled certain situations.
I:245;296;Love having this to our collection Watched it a few times!
I:245;297;I don't know if its that I can relate to Ariels struggle or the music is great or I just think she's hot, but I love this movie.
I:245;298;this is just a truly great movie!
I:245;299;This was my favorite movie when I was a kid.
I:245;300;I still watch it over and over with my sons.
I:245;301;This is easy to give a 5 stars to.
I:245;302;The movie is a Disney classic.
I:245;303;A tale of a Princess who is a mermaid but dreams of life out of water.
I:245;304;This is a wonderful movie, teaching family values and to always chase your dreams.
I:245;305;This collection was a great one.
I:245;306;Even though it was used, I still really enjoy watching it.
I:245;307;It goes to show this is a favorite for life.
I:245;308;I have to admit we all love this one.
I:245;309;A very light and happy presentation for young boys and girls.
I:245;310;The music was catchy, and the story was easy to understand.
I:245;311;A little much for little kids, until they are able to handle it.
I:245;312;But the songs and characters are great.
I:245;313;Fun movie for the entire family.
I:245;314;I really appreciate the first class service and fair pricing.
I:245;315;Fantastic value for the Little Mermaid movie!
I:245;316;I bought two sets for my granddaughters.
I:245;317;It was GREAT to be able to see Disney's Little Mermaid again.
I:245;318;My daughter absolutely loved this movie when she was little.
I:245;319;It was a very special moment to share with her.
I:245;320;My nephew loves Disney movies, and TLM is no exception.
I:245;321;It always puts a smile on my face.
I:245;322;some of the songs are fun though.
I:245;323;My daughter loves the movie.
I:245;324;it was my favorite movie as a child and now I get to share it with my little girl.
I:245;325;Thanks She loved it as a gift.
I:245;326;This is a brilliant film!
I:245;327;This is the first of what I like to refer to as The Disney Modern Classics (along with Beauty and the Best, Lion King and Aladin).
I:245;328;A very touching story set to inspiring music makes this a true gem of cinema.
I:245;329;One of my favorite Disney movies, loved it when i was younger and know it by heart, i have this in my collection so my daughter will enjoy it when she gets older
I:245;330;It is amazing in blu.
I:245;331;What can I say It is a classic and has been my all time favorite movie since before I can remember!
I:245;332;I am very excited to own this diamond edition very reasonably priced and very enjoyable extras in addition to the movie!
I:245;333;all my little grandchildren love this movie it was well worth the price which was a value to boot.
I:245;334;I would definitely recommend this movie for old and young as it is very entertaining and the music is fabulous!
I:245;335;my Grand daughter was so very excited yelled and screamed with delight.
I:245;336;It's nice having these things on standby for viewing.
I:245;337;Little mermaid is a classic.
I:245;338;This type of viewing works best with an HTPC or Amazon.
I:245;339;The packaging and everything was perfect, it was brand new in perfect condition!!
I:245;340;this is a classic that the whole family can watch and enjoy i could watch this one over and over
I:245;341;Released in '89 `The Little Mermaid' marked Disney's triumphant return to the big screen.
I:245;342;"in my estimation `The Little Mermaid' is Disney at its very best
I:245;343;Add to that Ariel, the most adorable heroine ever, Ursula, the evilest villainess to date and a soundtrack of songs you'll be humming for months and you have a classic on your hands.
I:245;344;It's a great movie and glad I got if from amazon.
I:245;345;Both of my girls really like being able to watch at anytime.
I:245;346;I was sooooooooooo happy to get my movie!
I:245;347;So happy to find this item since Disney only does limited release.
I:245;348;It was a Christmas gift for my niece .
I:245;349;It fits the style of this animated movie rather well, so it's not a complaint.
I:245;350;the color was vibrant, and it appears that there was some restoriation and correction to certain scenes to remove contraversial elements.
I:245;351;It was a delight to revisit this disney favorite in a way that made it feel new .
I:245;352;not quite like seeing it for the first time, but fresher and more energetic.
I:245;353;Disney did great when coming up with this movie!
I:245;354;This edition is just fine!
I:245;355;My daughters favorite movie, and I watch it with her over and over again.
I:245;356;We love the songs and the supporting characters are wonderful.
I:245;357;This classic Disney movie is a great family film.
I:245;358;Always a fan and finally glad I got it after all these years!
I:245;359;The music is great and this will prove to be an enduring classic cartoon.
I:245;360;Just before the advent of digital cartoons this classic came out to speak to men and women both about the pitfalls of trying to be something that they're not.
I:245;361;Watched for the first time when I was 4 years old and now I love watching it with my 4 year old girl.
I:245;362;based on the bittersweet Hans Christian Andersen fairytale, the story of mermaid Ariel (voiced by Jodi Benson) and her quest to become a human and marry Prince Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes) marked the return of the classic Disney fairytale musical.
I:245;363;"I can happily say that I was there when Ariel first burst onto movie screens during the original theatrical release (so this film, along with ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"", holds a very special place in my childhood)."
I:245;364;"winning ""Under the Sea"", ""Part of Your World"", ""Kiss the Girl"" and ""Poor Unfortunate Souls""."
I:245;365;new double disc Platinum Edition is a must.
I:245;366;"of documentary* ""The Little Match Girl"" (brand new animated featurette, based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale with a music score adapted from Borodin themes
I:245;367;peek at the upcoming straight.
I:245;368;I just love this movie.
I:245;369;It's so wholesome in such a filthy word full of pornography and guts and gore.
I:245;370;One of Disney's best movies ever.
I:245;371;It was a great copy, mint used, but at least it played perfect.
I:245;372;This is by far one of Disney's best movies.
I:245;373;The whole family should like it.
I:245;374;I'm sure girls/women might enjoy it the most since Ariel is a very independent lady.
I:245;375;Disneys original classic story of a mermaid that wants to be human.
I:245;376;Lots of kool songs and cute story.
I:245;377;It shipped fast,in great condition and reasonably priced.
I:245;378;My grand children really got excited and love this video too.
I:245;379;i'm thrilled every time I watch it like the children.
I:245;380;This is a very cute movie for all ages.
I:245;381;My son who is turning 2, loves it.
I:245;382;And the music is great.
I:245;383;They love the music and animation of this movie.
I:245;384;I'm certain my grandbaby will also love it.
I:245;385;ray as a gift and my girlfriend loved it.
I:245;386;A favorite of mine and now of my daughter's.
I:245;387;ray looks great and having a digital copy is pretty awesome!
I:245;388;daughter got it as a 16 year old and enjoyed it very much.
I:245;389;This was a gift for my granddaugher, and she loved watching it, along with her two year old sister.
I:245;390;thank you we enjoyed the movie very .
I:245;391;good deal and fairly priced
I:245;392;This has always been one of my favorite Disney films and now it is my 3 year olds!
I:245;393;This is my grandaughter's favorite movie, an old classic!
I:245;394;nothing really worth anything on it!
I:245;395;So glad it is finally available on blu.
I:245;396;This is a keeper for generations to come!
I:245;397;My toddler grandchildren love all the Disney movies and this one was a favorite.
I:245;398;The Little Mermaid was my favorite Disney movie as a child and I love it even more now, 30 years later, as I watch my daughter sing and dance along to the movie.
I:245;399;If you love disney movies you should definitely add this to your collection.
I:245;400;Loved it went it first came out and now my daughter loves it!!
I:245;401;A great classic Disney movie to have in your collection!
I:245;402;Ever since I was a little girl I have loved this movie.
I:245;403;It is amazing and a must see.
I:245;404;My nieces (ages 2 and 4) also enjoyed the tale.
I:245;405;kids enjoyed it, and I watched it with them.
I:245;406;Her mother loved this when she was little, so I had to keep the tradition going!
I:245;407;I bought this to share with my two year old grandaughter.
I:245;408;We both love it, and now we are singing all the songs her mother and I sang before her.
I:245;409;It's a wonderful story with great music.
I:245;410;It's the first of many I'm sure, but we'll see as she gets older.
I:245;411;When the big fish is chasing the little mermaid, she screams with excitement and delight, she claps her hands and bounces on her bottom.
I:245;412;I bought it for my granddaughter.
I:245;413;Out of all the Disney movies out there this one ranks as one of the best I have seen.
I:245;414;Loved the widescreen format but would have liked to have seen a special features section for the price.
I:245;415;This is a classic Disney twist on a tale penned with a less than happy ending.
I:245;416;It's for kids, so of course Disney is going to change the end to be happy.
I:245;417;lauded character of Mulan is based on a Chinese ballad, and in the movie, is a caricature.
I:245;418;Show that you are strong, and we'll leave you to prove it.
I:245;419;As for the Disney movies, they are stories.
I:245;420;The Little Mermaid is a favorite of mine, and I highly recommend it as a feel good movie.
I:245;421;We're huge Disney fans and this was an addition to our daughter's Disney movie collection.
I:245;422;The Little Mermaid is one of our favorites and we enjoyed the movies as a family!
I:245;423;I have a son and daughter who both love this movie.
I:245;424;This is a nice story but, younger children are often frightened by the Sea Witch.
I:245;425;I placed it into my Blu.
I:245;426;by the way, this is a classic movie and we have seen it many times in the past.
I:245;427;This is my all time favorite Disney movie.
I:245;428;I made my kids watch it and now I can share it with my grand children.
I:245;429;Disney hit gold with The Little Mermaid, a charming, beautifully awesome film that is up there as one of the best animated films of all time!
I:245;430;This is my favorite movie of all time, so I've seen it a million times.
I:245;431;Not to mention, this release features some new great special features that give you insight into how the film was animated by studying actors who acted out the whole movie on a small set.
I:245;432;There's also a beautiful piece about the lyricist who I feel is responsible for the Disney renaissance, it brings a tear to the eye.
I:245;433;we have always loved the movie.
I:245;434;everything but the gift wrapping was great.
I:245;435;love this movie and so my girls!
I:245;436;This movie is Disney's 28th animated film and yes the one th@ saved the Disney company.
I:245;437;So cool to see the old school animation :.)
I:245;438;Brings back memories of drive ins and childhood.
I:245;439;The Little Mermaid is a great movie and my kids loved it!
I:245;440;The graphics and animation are top notch!
I:245;441;My kids love it, I love it, everyone loves it for all time forever.
I:245;442;My daughter and I love to watch this and it is an awesome family movie.
I:245;443;The Little Mermaid is my personal favorite when it comes to Disney movies.
I:245;444;I'm a fan of hand.
I:245;445;This movie was great when it first came out and it's even better as a Diamond Edition!
I:245;446;"Another new extra is Carly Rae Jepson's music video and rendition of ""Part of Your World""."
I:245;447;We thank you for your service.
I:245;448;It is a classic for kids and something I enjoy sharing with my son.
I:245;449;My grand daughter loves the old Disney films.
I:245;450;This was a present for my girlfriend who loved this movie as a child.
I:245;451;All in all I was pleased with the service and she loved the gift.
I:245;452;It is an excellent movie!
I:245;453;I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter and both she and her mother, who remembers seeing it in a theater when she was little, thought it was wonderful!
I:245;454;It was advertised as a used item but it was brand new.
I:245;455;It was a great surprise.
I:245;456;Love the way Disney interpreted the story!
I:245;457;You can watch this over and over again and enjoy it every time!
I:245;458;It hasn't changed and it's still as good as you remember.
I:245;459;Evryone in the family will enjoy this one, not just the kids!
I:245;460;This is one of my favorite Disney movies and I originally had this on VCR.
I:245;461;The price was the best I have seen!
I:245;462;My daughter loves this movie.
I:245;463;I received this movie later than expected and the prongs that hold the movie inside to keep it from moving were broken.
I:245;464;It is a wonderful movie and I definitely should have paid full price for this on the Disney website because this deal was not worth the wait or the crappy product.
I:245;465;Little Mermaid is my favorite movie in the whole entire world.
I:245;466;This is great movie for kids to see, as Ariel is strong willed and determined.
I:245;467;She is great role model for young girls.
I:245;468;This movie is a great classic with wonderful songs and an excellent story.
I:245;469;Love how the film is more vibrant than the original one from the VHS days.
I:245;470;I bought this for my wife as a just because gift.
I:245;471;She was very excited that we ended up watching it the moment she was able to unwrap it.
I:245;472;ray version with our son.
I:245;473;And it made my wife happy.
I:245;474;I chose Amazon and I can watch this movie from my computer, smart TV, Kindle, and phone.
I:245;475;I have watched with grand babies like I did with my kids.
I:245;476;Exactly what I wanted at a great price!
I:245;477;Thank you I loved it and my family loved it too !!!
I:245;478;I loved this movie growing up.
I:245;479;I will be happy to share it with my kids when they get older.
I:245;480;Saw it when I was little and I still watch it till this day on.
I:245;481;By the way, I'm 18 and I still enjoy this movie!
I:245;482;Our daughter is three and like most three year olds she loves anything princess!!
I:245;483;She very much enjoyed Little Mermaid!!
I:245;484;She loves to sing all the songs and act out the scenes!
I:245;485;A sure hit with any girl or boy!!
I:245;486;The new special edition is enhanced with color and sound.
I:245;487;You can tell the difference, color crisp and sound clear!
I:245;488;So my oldest daughter absolutely loves Ariel, and this remastered classic didn't fail the girl's imagination, still her favorite movie.
I:245;489;One of the best Disney movies.
I:245;490;Great story, and classic tale.
I:245;491;This is my daughters favorite movie, always signing the songs.
I:245;492;It's wonderful for my daughter and fits with her fairytale collection.
I:245;493;Keeps kids happy that's all I care about and can see on multiple devices.
I:245;494;And a friend's daughter love this movie so this was the one I had to get.
I:245;495;ray player now but someday she's going to and I love high definition videos a lot more than standard definition.
I:245;496;The whole family loves this movie.
I:245;497;One of the best Disney movies.
I:245;498;My grandchildren love to watch it, the music is awesome.
I:245;499;My granddaughter is turning 4 and she is crazy for ariel and she will love this for years to come.
I:245;500;I loved this movie when I was a kid and I cry everytime.
I:245;501;If you never seen this movie see it for family night.
I:245;502;Alan Menken came onto the Disney scene with an incredible view of animated movies .
I:245;503;but he shook up the Broadway musical world as well.
I:245;504;Mermaid is full of catchy tunes, the story is fun, and there is nothing here that doesn't entertain on so many levels.
I:245;505;A great cast, beautifully executed animation, and those clever Howard Ashman lyrics make Little Mermaid a classic tale that will delight audiences for many decades to come.
I:245;506;It is nice to finally own one of my favorite Disney movies.
I:245;507;Having it in every format is also helpful.
I:245;508;I bought this for my three grandchildren and they are very, very happy with it and have watched it many times already.
I:245;509;She and I have red hair, so she thinks we should watch this together because Ariel looks like us.
I:245;510;Its exactly what I thought it would be and a came in a timely manner and was in extremely good condition.
I:245;511;The Little Mermaid has to be one of the best movies of all time!
I:245;512;Disney has alot of great movies, but this one has to be one of my favorite ones.
I:245;513;Ariel, plays such a happy, and outgoing character, with all her adventures, and things she wants to learn.
I:245;514;The music in this movie is the best!
I:245;515;The songs in this movie, are so magical that it wants you to sing along.
I:245;516;I think this movie is romantic, because I cried at the end of the movie, and it touched me.
I:245;517;Well, anyways, Flounder, and Sebastian are great characters, and the scenes under the sea are really well illustrated.
I:245;518;I got this movie for my young granddaughter for Christmas.
I:245;519;She loves music and really enjoys the animated Disney movies.
I:245;520;This one is a nice addition to her growing collection.
I:245;521;So Little Mermaid comes out and while box.
I:245;522;office wise not as massive as Lion King or Aladdin, put the company back on track again.
I:245;523;I wouldn't call it Disney's best but it's certainly highly enjoyable, surprisingly affecting and a better movie than you'd think.
I:245;524;With the help of friends Sebastian, Flounder and Scuttle, Ariel has to break the spell in 3 days.
I:245;525;To the emotional Part of Your World to the renowned Under the Sea the film has uplifting music that even you'll get in your head.
I:245;526;And when you have frogs singing verses on Kiss the Girl, that's charming and a great song.
I:245;527;One minute, Ariel is beautiful and stunning than she'll have this weird look to her where she looks off.
I:245;528;It's a great film, not only for kids but just for casual viewing.
I:245;529;ordered this movie a long time ago and it took months to arrive but it is worth the wait.
I:245;530;Classic Disney tale, very well done, our grandchildren love it!
I:245;531;I started collecting Disney animated movies right after this one went back into the vault.
I:245;532;The songs in this movie are by far some of my very favorite songs in any Disney animated movie.
I:245;533;Brought back awesome childhood memories!
I:245;534;I gave it to my 4 year old daughter for xmas and she absolutely loved it.
I:245;535;Though I'm a Gramma now, I still love this movie.
I:245;536;My 27 year old daughter requested it for Christmas.
I:245;537;It brings back sweet memories of watching it with her as a preschooler.
I:245;538;I just love the music of the Little Mermaid.
I:245;539;It looks even better than at the movie theater.
I:245;540;I have always loved this movie.
I:245;541;A real hit at Christmas!
I:245;542;is more strong power to the woman themed than this was.
I:245;543;Disney's The Little Mermaid is such a great film!
I:245;544;It is way better than recent Disney movies.
I:245;545;As a christen I think it is great film.
I:245;546;No cursing,great values, and funny characters !
I:245;547;(if you really want to enjoy a good film with christen values watch Facing The Giants)It is a great movie for kids and adults.
I:245;548;This is a great addition to your video library.
I:245;549;Pixar may have helped end animated musicals but we will still love the ones that were out before.
I:245;550;orders for October :( Very happy with product, came factory seal :) Hope to order more in the future!
I:245;551;Any Disney animation movie I have seen is enjoyable, and I saw our granddaughter enjoyed it as much as I did!
I:245;552;It's always good to see a movie without foul language, or excessive violence in it.
I:245;553;It's a Christmas gift for my daughter and boy will she be surprised.
I:245;554;I ordered this movie for my 4 year old daughter and she loves it.
I:245;555;Now it's her favorite movie!
I:245;556;I truly Love this movie and I'm so glad I can share it with family and friends!!
I:245;557;This film relaunched Disney into mainstream movie dominance, and it is so easy to see how.
I:245;558;Everything about this film is perfect.
I:245;559;The voice cast, the animation, the story, and oh so importantly, the music.
I:245;560;"Under The Sea and ""Kiss The Girl"" each were nominated for Best Original Song, with ""Under the Sea"" winning the Oscar, and the film's score won Best Original Score."
I:245;561;This film seemed a return to the glory days of Disney animation, indeed, this film was the start of an amazing run for the Disney Studios, which continued well into the 90's and early 2000's.
I:245;562;The Sea Witch, Ursula, is one of the best villains ever thought up for a film.
I:245;563;Ariel, the title character, is just loveable.
I:245;564;The strength of the story is such that even when Ariel loses her voice as part of her deal with Ursula, the animation captures her desperation and determination perfectly, with such exquisite nuances as a slight head turn, a lift of an eyebrow, a sigh, expresses exactly what spoken dialogue would.
I:245;565;Hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old!
I:245;566;up and restoration was done, with the film looking and sounding like new.
I:245;567;Many bonus features are included, as usual for a Platinum Series release, so money spent here is well worth it.
I:245;568;This film is a rare treat: a so. called children's film that the whole family can sit down together and enjoy.
I:245;569;Loved just as much now as I did then.
I:245;570;A masterpeice of animation .
I:245;571;most essential love stories ever.
I:245;572;I bought this for my daughter and She Loves it.
I:245;573;Brand new in the box!
I:245;574;the movie came quickly and in perfect condition!
I:245;575;It is a classic .
I:245;576;For me, this has always been one of the movies that reinvigorated the Disney line of movies after a number of years of ones that I always felt were not as good as ones previous.
I:245;577;The combination of plot, characters and music were perfect and in the end you get a movie that is timeless and music that you cannot get out of your head (can you say 'Under the Sea.')
I:245;578;I highly recommend this to all Disney fans, as this is one that will not last long and it goes on the market in a little more than a week.
I:245;579;We received it in NEW condition, it looks fantastic and the kids have watched it countless times already.
I:245;580;Got the product pretty fast with regular shipping and my daughter was excited to open the package up.
I:245;581;I waited for this movie to be released since my daughter was born a few years ago.
I:245;582;and especially love the digital copy for play on iPod/iPad.
I:245;583;It is a great movie for a gift.
I:245;584;It was also great to see the movie on.
I:245;585;daughter and family enjoyed the movie and the clip about how they made the movie.
I:245;586;This was an excellent movie.
I:245;587;Ariel captures your heart in this film.
I:245;588;From romance forbidden by her father to breathtaking thrills, this movie is for the young and the young at heart.
I:245;589;She will turn Ariel into a human for 3 days but she has to get the prince to kiss her.
I:245;590;There's another catch, she will do it without her voice.
I:245;591;When she agrees and is human, she finds the prince and is invited to his castle.
I:245;592;But Ariel's animal friends come to the rescue and stall the wedding.
I:245;593;She gets their and gets back her voice.
I:245;594;So her father finally realizes that she is in love and turns her into a human.
I:245;595;They have a beautiful wedding and live happily ever after.
I:245;596;It's a wonderful film and I recommend it to everyone, young and old.
I:245;597;This excellent Disney family movie includes the hit song ``Under The Sea .
I:245;598;Jodi Benson is fantastic as the voice of Ariel.
I:245;599;Undoubtably one of the greatest Disney musicals of all time.
I:245;600;This animated musical proves that Disney IS the greatest movie company of all time.
I:245;601;A true animated classic that provides excellent family viewing.
I:245;602;Kids and adults of ALL ages will love ``The Little Mermaid .
I:245;603;Spectacular songs, brilliant comedy and a warm loving heart makes this movie a classic for all time.
I:245;604;friendly feel from shipper and i love that it is guaranteed because it is used
I:245;605;Finally got around to watching this last night.
I:245;606;The colors are very vibrant, and I didn't notice any problems with the encoding or animation.
I:245;607;If you choose to start the movie directly, it plays a bunch of previews that you can skip past using chapter forward on your remote, if you go to the menu and pick play movie, it starts right away.
I:245;608;Backstage Disney is the largest section.
I:245;609;A silent film with a musical background and is amazingly enough, actually true to the story.
I:245;610;It's pretty well done, IMHO.
I:245;611;Otherwise, it is a comprehensive look at the movie that marked the beginning of Disney's second golden age.
I:245;612;You can see the change of color from the old to the new.
I:245;613;That's exactly what I got.
I:245;614;Needless to say, this is the best disney movie ever made.
I:245;615;My daughter really loves this movie so I got a pre.
I:245;616;owned one and we watched it together and loved the film.
I:245;617;and the movie is a beauty!
I:245;618;"The effects are stunning including a riveting storm sequence comparable to the Monstro scene in ""Pinocchio"" and the final sequence with the towering Ursula as queen of the seas."
I:245;619;"Sure its formulaic now, but the musical scenes are timeless and though ""Under the Sea"" is not as sophisticated as later animated ""showstoppers"" it still makes you see why the film's first audiences described wanting to stand up and cheer after the sequence."
I:245;620;"The ""Making of"" featurette is quite thorough and takes you through the whole filmmaking process from the director's initial pitch to the studio bringing in Howard Ashman who fleshed out the characters with his witty lyrics to the final tense moments leading up to the premier in 1989."
I:245;621;There's some great suprises here including interviews with John Waters (over Ursula being modeled on drag queen legend, Divine), and ex.
I:245;622;this film is inspiring to any wanna.
I:245;623;Even more so, its a great film.
I:245;624;i was still memorized on how good this movie is.
I:245;625;this is one of disney's best movie.
I:245;626;But still disny movie are great.
I:245;627;If you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.
I:245;628;A great movie typical of Disney, the good and the bad of life that makes a hero.
I:245;629;I liked it and I hope my Grandchildren do as well
I:245;630;this without a doubt is my favorite disney film besides sleeping beauty.
I:245;631;They did such a good job remastering it!
I:245;632;My girlfriend and daughter are huge fans of The Little Mermaid.
I:245;633;This edition and others like it that pertain to classic Disney movies are great!
I:245;634;I recommend this for sure!
I:245;635;I'll be waiting on a used one!
I:245;636;No it doesn't jump out at you, but it's a very good conversation and worth 25.29 dollars.
I:245;637;According to my friends at Disney this Blu.
I:245;638;ray yet (if I get lucky I'll get one a month or so before the official release) but am told the picture and sound are, quite simply, astounding.
I:245;639;bTW this is my 21 year old daughters favorite movie!
I:245;640;What I received was just the Blu.
I:245;641;ray so all I can say is that the picture looked brand new and was about as good as it could be.
I:245;642;uP job with this one.
I:245;643;My 10 year old daughter loves this movie.
I:245;644;We were watching it the other night and it is such a great movie.
I:245;645;I love the story, and the underwater scenes.
I:245;646;I bought it for my daughter and she can't even watch it.
I:245;647;It was so wonderful to be able to share The Little Mermaid with my little girl.
I:245;648;This was one of my favorite movies growing up.
I:245;649;Remember, it is an 83 minute film on a dual.
I:245;650;now, not only was the transfer done well, making it technically satisfying, it was also aesthetic pleasing.
I:245;651;of special included as a bonus.
I:245;652;I am pretty sure Disney has done re.
I:245;653;There is also some new features as well that were just for the Blu.
I:245;654;Also some of the digital addons like a digital copy of the movie and some soundtrack music inclusions are nice touches.
I:245;655;I love it, both my kids love it!
I:245;656;Seller added enough describtion of the movie to let me know it was perfect for my grand daughter.
I:245;657;I highly recommend this seller and this movie.
I:245;658;A favorite of my first grandchild so let's see if grandchild number 3 loves it tooShe is just 3 years olf
I:245;659;enchanting music and memorable characters.
I:245;660;Ariel is truly the best!
I:245;661;It was package great and came in a perfect amount of time.
I:245;662;I loved it when i bout it for my kids now i am bout for my grandouthers.
I:245;663;One of my grand daughter's favorite movies and we have watched it repeatedly!
I:245;664;We also love the songs and the wonderful colors used in the movie.
I:245;665;niece who just turned 3 loved it and said she wants to be a Mermaid just like in the movie.
I:245;666;One of my all time favorite classic Disney movie.
I:245;667;This is for my granddaughter for Christmas and I know she's going to love it because all we have is the old VHS Version so I know the clarity of this is going to make this movie amazing.
I:245;668;The case was pristine and the discs play wonderfully.
I:245;669;All I hear her say around the sea under the sea kiss the girl makes her happy!!
I:245;670;I loved this movie as a kid and, I wanted my younger relatives to be able to watch it also.
I:245;671;Great movie, especially, for girls to watch.
I:245;672;Great gift my little one loved it.
I:245;673;I wasn't too sure when I bought it, but she is enthralled with it.
I:245;674;I love this movie and my son (yes son) who loves fish and water gets lost in the excitment as well.
I:245;675;Starting our massive movie collection, and this is a great addition to add to the collection.
I:245;676;This animated movie spawned pretty much every type of merchendice: video games, dolls, books, panties, happy meals, ice cream, socks, etc., etc., etc. so why is this movie so good?
I:245;677;This is the kind of movie that puts everything together without burning the cake.
I:245;678;Even if you hate Hakunamatata (or however you spell that stupid song) from The Lion King, Sebastian's Under The Sea actually has a nice rythm.
I:245;679;I'm very upset about it.
I:245;680;In addition, the voice cast, featuring Jodi Benson, Pat Carroll, and Christopher Daniel Barnes, is superb!
I:245;681;"Beauty and The Beast received the ""Best Picture"" Oscar nomination, but I think ""Little Mermaid"" is the far superior film."
I:245;682;I loved sharing this movie with a second generation member of my family, my grand.
I:245;683;She adored all of the characters in the film, especially, Ariel.
I:245;684;it is nice to know that people have access to movies of this nature.
I:245;685;where children can enjoy their short childhood fantasies through films with loved ones.
I:245;686;I definetely recomend this movie to ANY age!
I:245;687;My child requested it and we bought it and watched it right away.
I:245;688;They issued me a full credit (including shipping).
I:245;689;"so although I didn't see it I got a good ""review"" of it!What I'm looking for now is a copy of the Lion King."
I:245;690;disc 1 wont play it just skips so it is useless to me i saw the movie when it came out and and i loved it my grand children love it as well thats why i ordered it
I:245;691;One of the greatest Disney classics ever made.
I:245;692;d. Love watching this over and over again as the special effects are so great.
I:245;693;This has always been a favorite movie of mine since childhood and I still love it as much as I did back in 1989 when it was in the theatres.
I:245;694;"Overall, this is a fantastic movie with great animation, unforgettable characters and top class songs with ""Part Of Your World"" being my favorite, escpecially in the end where Ariel finally gets to marry Prince Eric."
I:245;695;Amazing truely a classic and a league of its own a beautiful tale of love enchantment and courage A one of a kind tale that will leave the whole family in amazenment truely a disney classic 5 out of 5 The steel book is a must have for any little mermaid fan A must have for any disney collector and one of personal favorite movies Thank You
I:245;696;Classic movie and Disney interpretation of the classic Hans Christian Anderson story.
I:245;697;My twin Granddaughters were so excited to finally see it.
I:245;698;This Disney film is probably one of the most beloved Disney films of all time.
I:245;699;It started a wave of new Disney animated films including Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and the Lion King and so on.
I:245;700;the animation in this film is divine (not compared to the new computer generated stuff of course) I have enjoyed this film since it first came out and love watching childrens faces when they watch the magic come alive.
I:245;701;However like anything it costs her and she has to give up her beautiful voice.
I:245;702;The picture, music, etc. was perfect.
I:245;703;It's pretty and delightful, they say.
I:245;704;It keeps them amazed as it's filled with great colors and beauty.
I:245;705;The music keeps them singing along with the movie.
I:245;706;Recommend it for all who have little girls to enjoy each others company.
I:245;707;Now I have a grandbaby who gets to watch it on a big screen TV and in high definition.
I:245;708;The colors were brilliant and the sound is beautiful.
I:245;709;And the story line is as exciting as it always was!
I:245;710;disc Platinum Edition) was a perfect choice to replace the old one my daughter has.
I:245;711;She loves the series and watches them over and over again.
I:245;712;My 3 year old loves it!!!
I:245;713;The songs and animation are super.
I:245;714;I remember the day I saw this film for the first time, when I was about seven years old.
I:245;715;"I had the great fortune to see ""The Little Mermaid"" in the theatre (which is how it SHOULD be seen)."
I:245;716;Not only is the animation spectacular and absolutely stunning (this was before the introduction to computer animation, that is so widely used today), but the actors providing the voices for the characters are wonderful.
I:245;717;"ariel (voice of Jodi Benson) is a beautiful, headstrong 16 year old mermaid who wants nothing more but to live with the land dwellers and be a ""Part of their world"" (to paraphrase on of the most well known songs from the film)."
I:245;718;Nothing will stop Ariel when she experiences love at first sight, after rescuing a very handsome young prince from near.
I:245;719;The Little Mermaid can be enjoyed by people of all generations, and will leave you with memorable tunes, a song in your heart and a smile on your lips.
I:245;720;I bought this for an adult friend who said it was one of her favorite movies and never owned it.
I:245;721;Well, it turned out to be a huge hit!
I:245;722;She's been raving about it since Christmas!
I:245;723;Having seen the movie myself, I can recommend it to people of all ages.
I:245;724;The story is absolutely breathtaking.
I:245;725;and I LOVE The Little Mermaid.
I:245;726;It came at the beginning of a streak of wonderful animated movies from Disney, including Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.
I:245;727;celebrity voices or Elton John soundtrack, The Little Mermaid nonetheless created a new archetypal genre in musical film.
I:245;728;Invariably, you will receive applause, smiles, cheers, from everyone, excepting maybe a few teen punks who really did enjoy the performance, but are too 'cool' to admit it.
I:245;729;[another grin]It is a classic story.
I:245;730;You'll love it, your kids will love it, your boy/girlfriend will thank you for it, and you can use it as I do to prove that you're not TOO terrible a person in your cinematic tastes!
I:245;731;"This movie is a lot of fun, and definitely ranks right up there with older Disney ""classic"" films such as Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Cinderella."
I:245;732;The folks at Disney did take some creative license with the tale (in the original the mermaid does NOT end up with the prince!)
I:245;733;":) Ursula is a delightful villian
I:245;734;This is a great movie, has lots of cute sea creatures.
I:245;735;recommend it for your collection.
I:245;736;Disney Studios 28th full length animated feature film.
I:245;737;The Little Mermaid marks the return of Disney's 3rd golden era.
I:245;738;Filled with memorable songs, characters and colorful animation.
I:245;739;This is certainly an excellent entry in their impressive film cannon, but still pales in comparison to their early classics.
I:245;740;That aside the film looks great and nether change really effects the film.
I:245;741;the extras are good, but not all that impressive for my taste, there is still plenty here to enjoy.
I:245;742;If you don't own the film, then the Blu Ray is the ay to go, it looks and sounds fantastic.
I:245;743;This is an Awesome Disney movie.
I:245;744;This movie was a gift.
I:245;745;One of the best Disney animated movies ever made.
I:245;746;There's enough romance, mystery, adventure, comedy, and action to have you watch it again and again.
I:245;747;Since it was their first true classic in many, many years.
I:245;748;Even though it does not have the same feel as the one's that Walt Disney overlooked himself, it is appealing and fits well among the top Disney films of all time.
I:245;749;A present for the G/F a super fan of all things Disney, especially the Little Mermaid.
I:245;750;The extras make her happy and if you order soon there is some deal where Disney will send you a limited edition poster.
I:245;751;A great movie for my three year old.
I:245;752;Older style graphics but still great.
I:245;753;Looks great and still as fun as it was when I was a kid!
I:245;754;Some of the best Disney songs ever in this film.
I:245;755;A classic movie that holds up over time.
I:245;756;I bought this for the wife after she had been requesting the movie for some time and it brought her great joy.
I:245;757;I liked and highly recommend it for all kids and disney fans.
I:245;758;The movie is one of disney's best film to see.
I:245;759;I recommend this product and the seller.

I:245;762;Happy with the product and most especially happy with fast shipping and handling.
I:245;763;And I do mean every night!
I:245;764;My daughter was super happy and love it when she opened her santa gift.
I:245;765;she was nice and got what she asked for :).
I:245;766;I loved this as a child and love it now plus with all the bonus features it was really fascinating to see the making of this wonderful film.
I:245;767;This movie is an excellent family movie with great values and morals.
I:245;768;It is a feel good movie with a nice story line.
I:245;769;Even at 50 I still shed tears at the end!
I:245;770;That way you can share with family without worrying about messing up your stuff.
I:245;771;It's as wonderful of a movie as I remember from my childhood, with all the memorable songs.
I:245;772;I'm glad that I got a chance to pass this movie on to my daughter.
I:245;773;A worthwhile addition to your collection, as it is a classic Disney movie the whole family can enjoy.
I:245;774;Now she can watch it when we travel .
I:245;775;She likes to dance to the music, good soundtrack.
I:245;776;It came well within the alloted time frame and was well packaged.
I:245;777;This is one of my favorite movies and I really couldn't be any happier that I bought it.
I:245;778;WhileThe Little Mermaidis wonderful and the visual images are equally great the story itself of Ariel being willing to do anything (including put her family in danger) to hook.
I:245;779;I have always liked this movie.
I:245;780;Such a great movie for kids.
I:245;781;I would recommend this movie for families of all ages.
I:245;782;A classic i get to share with my 2 year old.

I:245;798;This movie is great and fun for the whole family.
I:245;799;the picture and sound is great and i love this movie a lot.
I:245;800;Because it pretty much rocks my socks off and I love tonsing it the most when I am on my ottom
I:245;801;All Though The Shipment Experience Was Excellent, The Little Mermaid Two.
I:245;802;Shipment on time and the product was in perfect condition.
I:245;803;I was happy to be proven wrong.
I:245;804;The movie has always been a personal favorite and the effects really brought a fresh take to the film that made me feel like I was experiencing it for the first time.
I:245;805;Aside from that minor gripe, this is still the classic movie you remember and love and it honestly has never looked better than it has on this release.

I:245;815;This film is fun for the whole family.
I:245;816;Disney gives what is most likely one of its most beloved modern classics the Blu.

I:245;819;mermaid Princess Ariel wants to live up above the ocean floor in the world of humans.
I:245;820;Boys and girls of all ages adore this treasure.

I:245;822;The video is pristine and the colors are vibrant.
I:245;823;The 7.1 surround sound gives the film's musical numbers and environmental noises an extra boost that literally puts you in the middle of all the action.
I:245;824;"We get a music video for ""Part of Your World"" performed by Carly Rae Jespin."
I:245;825;e. oKE gives viewers the opportunity to sing along with their favorite songs.
I:245;826;scenes features centering on music and animation as well.

I:245;859;This is an amazing movie a total classic my daughters really love it and have watched it time and time again.
I:245;860;Our daughter loves it, and can't talk about anything else.
I:245;861;After the prince lets her stay in his beach front castle the fun begins.
I:245;862;The witch turns herself into a hot brunette copy of the nude girl but uses the voice to seduce the prince.
I:245;863;the little mermaid is a great movie.
I:245;864;lOVE THE MUSICLOVE THE STORYLOVE THE MOVIEIts a really good movie, if you haven't seen it, then Hurry up and go watch it!
I:245;865;Thank you so very much!I LOVE this cute and musical classic, and I'm so happy I can enjoy it with my son!GREAT in every way!
I:245;866;a favorite of my adult daughter.
I:245;867;She was excited to be able to share it with her young daughter.
I:245;868;But she does like the music of the movie and Ariel with her friends.
I:245;869;i was very pleased to receive this item before it was promised and my granddaughter was estatic to get it.
I:245;870;This was a great movie in great condition!
I:245;871;It is still one of the cutest movies ever made by Disney.
I:245;872;One of my favorite cartoon.
I:245;873;Love the music and the colored paintings of the characters.
I:245;874;It such a beautiful piece of work.
I:245;875;We all love this movie.
I:245;876;All make for a great movie that is an instant classic .
I:245;877;I can watch it again and again with my grandchildren.
I:245;878;A must have for a Disney and The Little Mermaid fans!
I:245;879;Remember the first time this one came out, A really big hint with young and old.
I:245;880;Now our granddaughter is enjoying it and we are again with her.
I:245;881;one of disneys best, love ariel and eric, what a s\love story.
I:245;882;is a must for disney fans, a keeper.
I:245;883;Definately one to own and watch with the kids.
I:245;884;much better than the original with lots of extras on the discs
I:245;885;Plus she can watch it on her iPad when we are out.
I:245;886;This is the original charming little tale in a format I can play for my precious six.year.
I:245;887;It is more than a kid's tale, however.
I:245;888;Disney is at their utmost best on this one.
I:245;889;It is probably the best animated feature in the history of Walt Disney, as it has everything a masterpiece animated feature needs : terrific animation, humour, adventure, suspense, romance, gorgeous songs, mystery, imaginative character and a really ingenious plot.
I:245;890;Ursala the Sea Witch is probably the best Disney villain, Eric is undoubtedly the most charming prince in Disney Animation History, and the entire way hans Christian Anderson's original story was adapted is terrific.
I:245;891;This was a great kid's movie, but I'm just a big kid at heart.
I:245;892;The Little Mermaid is a pretty colourful, entertaining piece of Disney animation, with allusions to the older Disney styles (like the way the bubbles are animated, and some of the people above water, etc).
I:245;893;witch who helps her become human, on tricky conditions and in exchange for Ariel's beautiful voice.
I:245;894;It's quite nicely animated, and worth watching for Disney fans.
I:245;895;Everyone enjoyed the show and expectations are it will remain a family favorite shared with other friends and families with small children
I:245;896;Digital copy works with iTinues and other media.
I:245;897;Blue ray extras are great
I:245;898;I personally am a great fan of disney.
I:245;899;The little mermaid is a big success, it gave us the hope to dream and so many memorable moments.
I:245;900;This movie was so good!
I:245;901;It belonged on the land.
I:245;902;I truly love the relationship with Ariel and her father, it hits very close to home.
I:245;903;I also love Ariel's sisters, especially Alana.
I:245;904;And I love the singing.
I:245;905;She loved her father, but he didn't understand her.
I:245;906;I made up my fanfiction girl, Georgette, a year ago at this time.
I:245;907;Ariel's heart belonged where it did, simple as that.
I:245;908;hoped this gave you an interesting look at it!
I:245;909;The actual story for children is very rich in symbolism and meaning and pathos.
I:245;910;I certainly hope that the original story is not forgotten.
I:245;911;it is noteworthy to bring attention to the two marvelous extras on the second disk of this offering by Walt Disney.
I:245;912;"One is a breathtaking version of ""The Little Match Girl"" which is scrupulously faithful to the original story."
I:245;913;"The second extra is titled ""The Story behind the Story"" which not only relates some of the biography of Hans Christian Andersen himself but also the genesis of the actual Disney film through its history."
I:245;914;so I hope these sketches reach a wide audience).
I:245;915;Both these extras are worth the price of the disk in and of itself, particularly for purists.
I:245;916;My grandchildren really enjoying this movie.
I:245;917;I remember this when my children were growing up, now my grandkids love it.
I:245;918;Great Disney movie for kids to watch!
I:245;919;It was a great price and we love the movie
I:245;920;She was excited to get it and I guess everything worked on it.
I:245;921;My 3 year old loves all disney princesses but has found a larger love for Miss Ariel!
I:245;922;Not only is this a wonderful story, but the colorful underwater action and some of the great songs make it one of my very favorites, even though I am an adult.
I:245;923;And the characters have such personality!
I:245;924;I love singing along with it, it's just a very FUN movie!
I:245;925;This is one of the best Disney films but this has not had very much work done before the transfer there is a lot of noise on the blu ray.
I:245;926;Disney's 1989 animated film THE LITTLE MERMAID is a very formidable movie, surpassing the combined visual and musical artistic talents of all concerned.
I:245;927;That was the brilliance of lyricist Howard Ashman's contribution to THE LITTLE MERMAID.
I:245;928;So in THE LITTLE MERMAID we are given a substantial amount of information and entertainment in a minimum amount of time.
I:245;929;The combined effort is one of a splendid and effortless looking perfect creation of a classical animated Disney tale.
I:245;930;THE LITTLE MERMAID has become a beloved film for all of us that ever grew up with it with our loved ones.
I:245;931;It brought magic to each of us and that that magic was brought into our families and into our homes and it will remain there forever.
I:245;932;This is a wonderful Disney Classic, excellent story line, beautiful, smart princess, handsome prince, adorable side kicks and awesome music!
I:245;933;My daughter is 15 and she still loves the movie after all these years.
I:245;934;My daughter loves this movie, so i'm glad i could make her happy.
I:245;935;The movie was in good condition and it shipped in excellent time.
I:245;936;I love the characters, music and scenery in the movie.
I:245;937;This was a surprise for a great gran.
I:245;938;i bought it because she is into the Disney princess them and it was an extra gift to add to her collection.
I:245;939;It is beautiful to watch and, of course, the songs were just as wonderful as they were years ago.
I:245;940;The animation is wonderful and beautiful.
I:245;941;I would recommend this to any child 4 and over who loves Ariel and who loves music!
I:245;942;It is still a Disney classic for the whole family.
I:245;943;I received the product days before I expected it and it was just as advertised: perfect!
I:245;944;the kids love this one and since it hasnt been released in a while, it is not easy to find, even used.
I:245;945;I received it today and my 3 year old daughter was screaming with excitement to watch it.
I:245;946;ignited Disney animation, officially launching a second golden age.
I:245;947;it also redefined the musical form of animated features for the first time since Snow White.
I:245;948;That is due largely to the vision of lyricist Howard Ashman, who can be seen on the bonus features conducting one of his insightful lectures.
I:245;949;With the spectacular music of composer Alan Menken (who made his debut as an underscore composer with this film), the results reverberated throughout the entertainment industry.
I:245;950;(Fans of Animaniacs also know her writing and acting in that great show.)
I:245;951;As to acting in The Little Mermaid, the cast is superb, from the leads like Pat Carroll as Ursula to little gems like the seahorse voiced by Will Ryan.
I:245;952;"ray Bonus Features* ""Part of your World"" Music Video ."
I:245;953;"SPOILERS FOLLOWThe Walt Disney Company's 1989 variation of ""The Little Mermaid"" is easily one of the best modern animated films from the studio."
I:245;954;With the voice talents of Jodi Benson, Kenneth Mars, and Rene Auberjonois,(albeit in a small yet memorable role as a French chef named Louis), it is fantastic.
I:245;955;it opens its story, appropriately enough, at sea.
I:245;956;The ubiquitous underwater sequences never feel strained or cheap, but exciting and even organic in a fanciful way.
I:245;957;The story's pivotal shipwreck at sea is appropriately huge and chilling.
I:245;958;Additionally, the songs by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken are brilliant.
I:245;959;"the Walt Disney Company's ""The Little Mermaid"" is still great fun, executed with a creative assurance that like many of its forebears, it will be appreciated for many years."
I:245;960;A fun story and we love Ursula the octopus.
I:245;961;The characters really are fun.
I:245;962;it's only a movie, I kept telling myself.
I:245;963;man, a Man, with legs.
I:245;964;Looks great with the remastered colors.
I:245;965;My family and I love little mermaid.
I:245;966;A little too much singing for my husband's taste, but he can watch it and even enjoy it a little :) Our 2 and 3yo love it almost as much as Brave and Tangled.
I:245;967;when I ordered this movie, I specifically ordered the 2.
I:245;968;The film is a classic, with songs by the Academy.
I:245;969;time favourite movie) and wonderful characters (Ariel, Flounder, Sebastian and Scuttle, among others), the movie is a timeless classic your little girl will treasure forever.
I:245;970;This was a favorite of my granddaughter's when she was a little girl(she is now 26).
I:245;971;She loved receiving this movie as a gift.
I:245;972;She loves it every time she watches it!!
I:245;973;Airel sings the best songs in the world!
I:245;974;This was requested by our granddaughters and we were so happy to find in on Amazon.
I:245;975;I loved the disc art and wasn't too happy when they took that away in favor of the blue and white discs for blu.
I:245;976;since we have so many and we travel so much I put my movies in binders so it's easily portable.
I:245;977;The sound is much better, too.
I:245;978;and, the movie is great.

I:245;987;Christmas gift for my grand daughter.
I:245;988;I know she will love it cause she loves the little Mermaid.
I:245;989;The Little Mermaid has to be the best Disney film EVER!
I:245;990;Ariel is the greatest heroine.
I:245;991;The Little Mermaid is TEN TIMES better than BATB.
I:245;992;Plus, Part of your World is the most beautiful song in the whole world.
I:245;993;The whole score is just magical.
I:245;994;The Little Mermaid , Aladdin , Pocahontas , and Hercules are the true hits of Disney.
I:245;995;It was great because it starts itself over when it gets to the end without having to do anything.
I:245;996;real or animated, but I really loved this film a great deal.
I:245;997;After all, I was 18 when the film first came out, certainly not a child, and I was never a Disney animation fan (I prefer Japanese anime).
I:245;998;a certain sparkle and dazzle that Disney was never truly able capture before or after.
I:245;999;Despite the film being a bit formulaic, it somehow flows beautifully and surprisingly well.
I:245;1000;The classic fairy tale was transformed into a more modern and hip coming.
I:245;1001;age story with a happy ending (of course)!
I:245;1002;The songs were among the most wonderful I have ever heard, worthy of Broadway (it WAS composed by a pair of Broadway vets after all)!
I:245;1003;The musical numbers were spectacular, varying from the deliciously witty and delightful to the poignant and emotional.
I:245;1004;The animation was a kaleidoscope of rich colors and incredibly fluid, graceful motion.
I:245;1005;The story was fast paced and hilarious!
I:245;1006;And of course, who can ever forget our wonderful heroine, Ariel .
I:245;1007;the embodiment of beauty, innocence, and childlike curiousity, who yearns for a world beyond her own.
I:245;1008;My three year old likes this movie and does not seem scared of Ursula like I had thought she may be.
I:245;1009;Mermaid was one of Disney's last great movies.
I:245;1010;the Little Mermaid is the Disney version of the Hans Christian Anderson tale.
I:245;1011;Disney brings it to life with the beautiful Ariel, and a whole cast of loveable characters.
I:245;1012;She bargains with the sea witch Ursula to turn her into a human.
I:245;1013;The price she pays is her voice.
I:245;1014;She has to make Eric fall in love with her.
I:245;1015;ursula uses Ariels voice to bring her father to her knees.
I:245;1016;In the end, she is overcome, and Triton.
I:245;1017;the music is some of the most creative animated music EVER.
I:245;1018;From Kiss the girl to Under the Sea, each songs is singable, and unforgettable.
I:245;1019;Boy and girls alike will love this movie about dreams, courage, and adventure.
I:245;1020;If you are a fanatic of Disney's films, you have to have this masterpiece as part of your collection definitively.
I:245;1021;The Little Mermaid is simply enchanting.
I:245;1022;The songs, the characters and Ariel's beauty are going to captive you.
I:245;1023;i love the Disney witches, and collect them with my daughter.
I:245;1024;Ursula is one of the best villains ever created.
I:245;1025;"She's right up there with ""Maleficent"", ""The Evil Queen""/""Old Hag"" and ""Cruella DeVille""."
I:245;1026;She is wonderfully animated, and appropriately voiced with the deep guttural tone of Pat Carroll.
I:245;1027;Her scenes in the movie are by far, my favorite ones.
I:245;1028;The Little Mermaid is infinitely watchable and not too scary like some Disney movies eg.
I:245;1029;"I feel strongly, that unless indicated otherwise, a ""childrens"" G. rated movie should be happy, and this one is."
I:245;1030;"if you want to get swept away by Disney, ""The Little Mermaid"" is the film to choose."
I:245;1031;The movie is obviously brilliant.
I:245;1032;I bought a movie earlier this year and it was damaged as well.
I:245;1033;This movie is a classic and was worth every penny!
I:245;1034;I was so happy to find this movie for such a good price.
I:245;1035;One of my kids favorite and now, one of my grandkids favorite.
I:245;1036;Great movie to enjoy with adults and children
I:245;1037;Watched it last night and it played great!
I:245;1038;What is there to review, Ariel is both mine and my daughter's favorite Disney princess.
I:245;1039;This edition is very clear on the screen.
I:245;1040;My children LOVE this movie and I remember loving it when i was younger too.
I:245;1041;I was excited to receive the 2 disc edition.
I:245;1042;this story is to funny and truly a classic for all the family to wach Ariel the Mermaid in her adventure.
I:245;1043;the music is fun too!
I:245;1044;Great gift idea and family fun movie night for all.
I:245;1045;thank you to the seller for a grand overall experience in all areas.
I:245;1046;The Little Mermaid was one of my children's favorite movies when they were younger.
I:245;1047;It was great to see this upgraded version and enjoy the timeless music and story again.
I:245;1048;The granddaughter of course loves this movie.
I:245;1049;So this is great we love it and the color and sound is wonderful.
I:245;1050;Really good movie can't say enough.
I:245;1051;I bought it for my grandchildren and they are enjoying watching it!
I:245;1052;I highly recommend it for children and adults!
I:245;1053;She loves it and its a classic move as it is.
I:245;1054;I LOVE this movie (still)!
I:245;1055;Ariel's mission to see the boy she likes ended up being what she always dreamed of, meeting a good.
I:245;1056;hearted hero, willing to save her life from the wicked (and my all.
I:245;1057;It was nice to reminisce with my daughter and introduce the Little Mermaid to my granddaughter!
I:245;1058;This is one of our all time favorite movies, I really enjoyed watching this with my kiddos and we loved it alot.
I:245;1059;I am probably one of the biggest Little Mermaid fans in the world.
I:245;1060;I clipped out the original reviews and stories on the movie from the LA Times.
I:245;1061;My question to Disney is, when will Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin come out (and Lion King too I guess)???
I:245;1062;above all, this movie is GREAT and you will and must cherish it forever!!
I:245;1063;We are collecting Disney movies we really enjoyed as children to share with our own children someday.
I:245;1064;She has a life span of age 25 or 30.
I:245;1065;I love The Little Mermaid!!

I:245;1068;I love this movie, it's a classic.
I:245;1069;Ariel is one of my favorite princesses.
I:245;1070;Plus, I love this movie because the Prince isn't just a figure, he is actually a character in this one.
I:245;1071;This is a good, kid.
I:245;1072;Im not kidding,this is Disney at its absolute BEST!This film was good at everything,disneys best songs,plot,humor,and characters!My 2 year old baby brother loves ariel and knows the words to her songs.
I:245;1073;I think she's probably my favorite Disney heroine.
I:245;1074;Being a swimmer who adores the water, I sympathized much more with her daughter in the sequel!
I:245;1075;Well, it's a fairy tale, so I guess she has to get her prince.
I:245;1076;What an influence from a Disney movie!I think the music in this movie is superior to some other Disney movies.
I:245;1077;(Of course, I may be prejudiced because I love the water.)
I:245;1078;And I enjoyed both sequels.
I:245;1079;Beautiful remaster that is everything you remember and more!
I:245;1080;the color and sound from the remaster really makes the long wait for this worth while.
I:245;1081;Loved watching this as a kid.
I:245;1082;Happy to share it with my kids.

I:245;1099;Perfect for my new daughter!
I:245;1100;It got here quick and both wife and daughter watch it frequently.
I:245;1101;Even dad is taking a liking to it.
I:245;1102;Bought for my special needs daughter and she loves it.
I:245;1103;Has been one of our favorites.
I:245;1104;Makes great for a gift brand new play well, good disney movie and came with extras.
I:245;1105;Played it the weekend for our grand daughter ans she loves it.
I:245;1106;As stated earlier, it was in great shape and the movie is very good.
I:245;1107;Thank god for Howard Ashman and Alan Menken bringing a style of animation to a new time high with the likes of Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin.
I:245;1108;The Little Mermaid is a wonderful tale surrounded by fabulous characters like the sea witch Ursula, the loyal servant Sebastian and the trusting friend, Flounder, and encaptulated in marvalous songs like Under the Sea and Kiss the Girl.
I:245;1109;From the opening scenes of dolphins playing with a sailing ship to the colourful delights of Under the Sea, The Little Mermaid is a must for any collection.
I:245;1110;I have watched it with my son three times since he got it.
I:245;1111;It is fun for children 1oo and under.
I:245;1112;children and an adult niece.
I:245;1113;The Video was funny and my daughter has seen it 12+ times now.
I:245;1114;Great songs and a plot thats easy enough for a 2 year old to follow.
I:245;1115;My daughter loves the movie so much that she knows most of the words, music and the words to the songs.
I:245;1116;it is a true classic!
I:245;1117;Girls and Boys love this movie!
I:245;1118;It is a must have movie.
I:245;1119;Wife loved it as it adds to her collection of disney movies.
I:245;1120;I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Disney
I:245;1121;It's still wonderful to watch.
I:245;1122;Disney took the classic fairy tale and gave it a happy ending.
I:245;1123;and we were all expecting it, anyway, weren't we?While the story is good, the music score is great.
I:245;1124;Alan Menken did a perfect job of scoring this.
I:245;1125;The melodic lines are pure and beautiful, with a slightly jazzy feel to the entire movie.
I:245;1126;Among the best pieces are Under the Sea and Part of Your World .
I:245;1127;piqued our interest in this classic Disney tale.
I:245;1128;colored version is FANTASTIC: they show the before and after pictures and the difference is amazing.
I:245;1129;Instead of a washed out pumpkin color, Sebastian is now a vibrant red/orange crustacean!The Backstage Disney disc is especially fascinating.
I:245;1130;The man who did the animation for that incredible scene begged Katzenberg, too, and earned it a stay of execution.
I:245;1131;every other night before bedtime!I also enjoyed hearing about Hans Christian Anderson (although his bio is a sad one), from those involved with the Disney movie as well as the curator of the Anderson Museum in Odense, Denmark.
I:245;1132;we have both the Plantinum version of the Little Mermaid, as well as the soundtrack, and we LOVE IT.
I:245;1133;"I highly recommended this movie for both kids and adults
I:245;1134;popping, the story compelling (and much gentler than the Anderson version), and the songs SPECTACULAR.
I:245;1135;In fact, next to Beauty and the Beast, this is my favorite set of Disney movie songs.
I:245;1136;This was always a favorite.
I:245;1137;Can't wait to share it with the next generation of kids.
I:245;1138;she loves the mermaid and will definitely love to be able to watch this when she wants
I:245;1139;one of the best Disney movie classics.
I:245;1140;Little MermaidIt is a Great movie and it has great songs all kids love it both girls and boys and it is timeless
I:245;1141;Amazing fast shipping one of my favorite movies growing up!
I:245;1142;The color is amazing on my 55 inch led and sound is great with my Bose
I:245;1143;Of course it gets five stars!
I:245;1144;This Disney Classic is classic for a reason.
I:245;1145;The songs are the best, the characters are loveable, and Prince Eric is actually hot.
I:245;1146;"i rewatched it at 21 for the first time in about 15 years and I still sung along to ""Part of Your World"", felt her anguish in ""Part of Your World Reprise"" and cried at the end."
I:245;1147;Bought this blu ray edition for my girlfriend and she loves it.
I:245;1148;If she's happy I'm happy
I:245;1149;Disney classic, so glad we picked it up.
I:245;1150;All my children were happy to receive it as they'd seen the movie before from a VHS copy we picked up somewhere along the way.
I:245;1151;We sat down together and they seem to enjoy it.
I:245;1152;Finally found this copy for my granddaughter, she loves it.
I:245;1153;Bought this for my nieces (5 and 3) and they love it.
I:245;1154;I want to help build their movie library.
I:245;1155;netOriginally released on November 14th, 1989, The Little Mermaid has since gained legendary status in the pantheon of great Disney animated films.
I:245;1156;Ursula wants her voice, and Ariel will have three days to make the prince fall in love with her .
I:245;1157;or else she'll return to her mermaid form and her soul will belong to the sea witch.
I:245;1158;Luckily, a solid script, captivating songs written by Alan Menken, and brilliant artwork came together to create a cinematic masterpiece for the ages.
I:245;1159;there's no denying that The Little Mermaid looks gorgeous on Blu.
I:245;1160;I remembered it looking better than it actually does .
I:245;1161;while there are plenty of beautiful, colorful shots under the sea and in Eric's kingdom, there's definitely a softness to the picture.
I:245;1162;It's the last of Disney's films to use actually hand.
I:245;1163;The film was only a few years behind Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King, yet those films look superior on Blu.
I:245;1164;drawn animation looks great, and it's obvious the lengths that Disney's animators went to to properly emulate human emotion and movement .
I:245;1165;one of the extras goes into detail about all of the live action footage that was shot for reference.
I:245;1166;There's also a few changes made from the 2006 edition .
I:245;1167;Overall though, the presentation is definitely a step up from the 2006 edition.
I:245;1168;the sound mix is definitely decent, once again considering its age.
I:245;1169;This is a really cool look inside the animation studio at Disney, and has a few interviews with artists there that were inspired by seeing The Little Mermaid when they were young.
I:245;1170;A few of the older guys who actually made the film are here too, and shed some light on some interesting facts about the creation of this classic.
I:245;1171;He had quite a minor role in the first place.
I:245;1172;There's some funny footage here, such as the actor who played Eric rowing in a serious scene while on an office chair with oars, and the girl who played Ariel diving in a giant freezing tank so that the filmmakers could capture what hair looks like underwater.
I:245;1173;overall, this is another great release from Disney, and a solid package for those anticipating The Little Mermaid`s hi.
I:245;1174;The picture and sound are about as clean as they're ever going to get, and fans of the film get a whole hour of brand.
I:245;1175;This is definitely a keeper!
I:245;1176;My daughter is 4 years old and she loves watching this movie.
I:245;1177;I recommend the movie for anyone with kids.
I:245;1178;ray was wonderful and fully surrounds you almost like your there under the sea.
I:245;1179;In the latest version of the 1989 classic, they've done this.
I:245;1180;Ariel herself looks as great as ever, and she and her friends have been cleaned up and are flawless.
I:245;1181;"Not necessarily
I:245;1182;It is in great shape and plays beautifully!
I:245;1183;This version of The Little Mermaid makes me long for the sweet, original Hans Anderson's tale of a little mermaid.
I:245;1184;To live in the sea and also fall in love with a prince.
I:245;1185;I have found that this film has become one of our favorites, and for good reason.
I:245;1186;It has true love (ah, true love: the best kind!)
I:245;1187;", determination, drama, humor, delightfully amusing scenes (Ariel the Mermaid flirtily combing her hair with a fork at the dining table in the castle, because Scuttles the Seagull [whose voice is superbly played by Buddy Hackett] told her a fork was a ""dinglehoffer ."
I:245;1188;, an incredible Oscar wnning score, and a HAPPY ending.
I:245;1189;The original tale, by Hans Christian Anderson, did not end so happily.
I:245;1190;disney was wise to change this.
I:245;1191;"In so doing he made this film ""The Little Mermaid"" beloved by families all over the world."
I:245;1192;This is top notch cartoon filmmaking and I love this movie as much as my children do!
I:245;1193;Sebastian the Crab, for example, is charming!
I:245;1194;The plot is totally great!
I:245;1195;"The extra additions, such as Ashey Tisdale singing a hip version of ""Kiss the Girl"" are really fun to watch and listen to."
I:245;1196;This Platinum Edition, very well done, is a GREAT addition to your film collection whether you choose it because it is a cartoon or just because you want a good old plain superterrific movie!Have some underwater fun and get it today!
I:245;1197;Children will love it and adults too.
I:245;1198;She is actually reciting the story to me and laughs at appropriate jokes.
I:245;1199;I love seeing the joy in her face.
I:245;1200;The movie is great and not too many scary scenes for the little ones as some of the other Disney movies.
I:245;1201;This one is a winner!
I:245;1202;it is a nice sweet movie except that the Bad Squid is a little to mean and scared my girls when they were real little.
I:245;1203;ultimately the music is only OK and my children now sledom watch it, they have moved on and prefer to watch other films instead.
I:245;1204;This is a good kids movie and I recommend it.
I:245;1205;around and created one of the greatest animated films of all time.
I:245;1206;Not since Snow White in 1937 had there been such a good animated film.
I:245;1207;The Little Mermaid has held up incredibly well over the past 15 years, and is still a great movie.
I:245;1208;It is my second favorite animated film ever behind Beauty And The Beast.
I:245;1209;Sharpness and detail are very good, however.
I:245;1210;This is a fabulous mix.
I:245;1211;The front 3 channels are also used very well, and bass is deep and responsive.
I:245;1212;(0/5)Overall: The Little Mermaid is a fantastic movie that everyone should own.
I:245;1213;Whichever version you choose, expect a great film either way.
I:245;1214;Oh well, I still have the movie to tide me over.
I:245;1215;my lil girl been wanting this movie an she loved it its hard to fined this movie an they hade it
I:245;1216;thanks disney for ruining my life.
I:245;1217;My daughter has always loved this movie.
I:245;1218;It's a movie the whole family will enjoy.
I:245;1219;because if your kids are like mine, they will watch it over and over.
I:245;1220;This is always a good movie!
I:245;1221;I love that I can watch it anywhere I go.
I:245;1222;My very manly little boy loves this movie and would watch it several times a day if we'd let him.
I:245;1223;It's a great movie for the whole family.
I:245;1224;I loved it when I was younger and my daughter loves it now.
I:245;1225;Great movie in good shape.
I:245;1226;I just moved and forgot to change my address, so my stuff got delivered to the wrong place.
I:245;1227;It was my mistake, so I just accepted it and moved on.
I:245;1228;each package was labeled with a change of address note.
I:245;1229;I feel I received amazing customer service because of this!
I:245;1230;This is another one of Disney's best films!
I:245;1231;This story brings you excitement, fun, and touching scenes that are unforgettable (considering that this was made in the 1980's and I have seen this movie soooooo many times!)
I:245;1232;This movie is guaranteed satisfactory for all ages (yes, we teens like these juvenile films too!)
I:245;1233;Just listen to the beautiful songs, look at the nice animation, and LIVE the magic!
I:245;1234;This was my favorite movie when I was a girl and now its my daughters.
I:245;1235;She loves anything mermaid :)
I:245;1236;'The Little Mermaid' revived the breathtaking beauty of the classic Disney films like `Sleeping Beauty' and `Snow White' with it's tale of innocence pursued by evil, and true love conquering all.
I:245;1237;The beauty of the film is its radiance, not in its drawings and colors.
I:245;1238;i'm very happy that this finally came out on disc and able to share this with my kids instead of constantly taking this out from the library.
I:245;1239;This is perhaps one of the top 10 animated films ever made, I find it has a much deeper heart than `Beauty and the Beast,' and although it signified the beginning of a brand new Disney Empire, I find that it also signified the end of it.
I:245;1240;And animation has grown into a magnificence and technologically superior story telling medium.
I:245;1241;captured, and that's a heart as big and as deep as the ocean.
I:245;1242;`The Little Mermaid' is defiantly for the whole family and is a gem on its own right.
I:245;1243;It stands alone as one of Disney's most enchanting modern creations for a new generation.
I:245;1244;This was a Terrific kids classic movie fun for whole family to watch that was difficult finding in the stores.
I:245;1245;I ordered it and it was delivered within 2 days.
I:245;1246;I was shocked it came so fast!
I:245;1247;I bought a bunch of movies aside to this and I'm scared to open them up.
I:245;1248;is a Disney classic and my kids love it as much as I did.
I:245;1249;Great movie, not sure of what else to say.
I:245;1250;I've been a Disney fan my whole life and I'm glad Amazon has the classes on Blu.
I:245;1251;We bought this movie for our kids and they love it as much as my sister and I did the first time it came out!!
I:245;1252;But as far as the movie, I would recommend it for children of any age.
I:245;1253;It's a classic movie that my likes absolutely love just as much as I did as a little girl.
I:245;1254;My 2yr daughter loves this movie.
I:245;1255;She is in love with Ursula it is so cute.
I:245;1256;Her fantasy of being part of the human race explodes when she swims to the top of the sea, and sees Prince Eric, who will eventually become the love of her life.
I:245;1257;She decides that it is time for her to gain some independence, so she goes to Ursula, a sea witch.
I:245;1258;This movie is meant for young girls, yet uses a lot of imagery in order to speak about societal issues.
I:245;1259;Women in this movie are viewed primarily as dependent upon men, until they take their own initiative.
I:245;1260;In order for Ariel to win his heart, she must give something of great importance away.
I:245;1261;This in itself may give young children the message that in order for a woman to win a man's heart, she must do it without using her voice, that her looks would simply be enough.
I:245;1262;"The idea that a man can get passed looks, and love a woman for her ""voice"" comes out at the end of the film when Eric chooses Ariel, the woman with the beautiful voice for who she really is."
I:245;1263;This movie has many messages for young girls, although not positive all throughout, in the end children are given a positive view of what it means to be an independent woman who is able to accomplish her goals.
I:245;1264;I loved this movie as a child.
I:245;1265;I viewed it as a strong independent woman who pursued forbidden love.
I:245;1266;I watched this again recently and I see it as anything but.
I:245;1267;She showed a strong dependence on Prince Eric.
I:245;1268;If you love Disney princesses and adventure then you'll love this movie.
I:245;1269;I personally love the animation in this movie, being an artist my self.
I:245;1270;A wonderful movie for all ages!
I:245;1271;I was a junior in high school (blush) but even now as an adult and a mom, I still love this movie and that I can share it with my daughters.
I:245;1272;It's a timeless story, with wonderful music.
I:245;1273;It was a little disconcerting to see her agitated like that, but with some discussion, she's fine.
I:245;1274;It was her favorite gift.
I:245;1275;My favorite disney movie of all time and wanted to share it with her.
I:245;1276;well they are not really entertaining !!!
I:245;1277;The new and improved Little Mermaid can only be described in one word.
I:245;1278;Its a classic and I recommend it for all!!
I:245;1279;I bought this for a very special great granddaughter and she has enjoyed it over and over and over again!
I:245;1280;"Even my 4 year old son enjoyed it, even though at first he didn't really want to watch a ""princess"" movie!"
I:245;1281;He already wants to watch it again!
I:245;1282;This is my daughter's favorite movie and I have great memories of watching it with her older cousins.
I:245;1283;The characters make this a Disney classic.
I:245;1284;I adored this movie as a child too.
I:245;1285;They are so happy that Grammy got this movie for them to watch when they are at our house.
I:245;1286;It is just beautifully done.
I:245;1287;This was my daughter's favorite movie and now it can be my granddaughter's!
I:245;1288;Nice, traditional princess story with beautiful animation and fun music.
I:245;1289;It was a classic from my childhood that I can now share with my daughter.
I:245;1290;Disk was just as described, in excellent condition.
I:245;1291;He loves it and also has memorized the songs.
I:245;1292;His father, my son loved it also when he was little.
I:245;1293;She has watched it a lot of times.
I:245;1294;This is a great movie, as anyone who has seen it will atest.
I:245;1295;Disney's twisted portrayal of true love is mine too!
I:245;1296;The artists are spot on with Aerial's measurements and writers don't miss a beat with her personality.
I:245;1297;There's just something magical about her loving a guy before he even has to talk to her.
I:245;1298;Aerial's fascination over the statue of a man is admirable as well, and while he's away could help keep her faithful.
I:245;1299;Plus the fact that she cannot talk only adds to this mystical story of what real love can be.
I:245;1300;My unique desire remains unfulfilled in real life, but lives on forever in this breathtaking fairytale.
I:245;1301;Fun for the whole family.
I:245;1302;daughter's Disney collection is growing at a great pace, We really appreciate her response when she gets a Disney move to add to the collection
I:245;1303;classic Disney animation, yeah, 25 years.
I:245;1304;I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter, who is a graphic designer.
I:245;1305;The graphics and lettering on the covers are fuzzy and indistinct, and the shrink.
I:245;1306;Got this for my wife and she opened it and watched it same day.
I:245;1307;This was her favorite movie growing up, so she had some sentimental value to it.
I:245;1308;Arrived on time, loved it.
I:245;1309;A triumphant return to the hand.
I:245;1310;"drawn Disney classics of old, the effervescent ""Mermaid"" is a sparkling mix of superb voice acting, energetic animation, and a highly infectious songbook, all loosely based on the Hans Christian Andersen story."
I:245;1311;"As voiced by Sam Wright, Sebastian the Crab is a particularly inspired entry in the studio's canon of irresistible helpmates, while Ashman and Menken songs like ""Kiss the Girl"" and the Oscar."
I:245;1312;"winning ""Under the Sea"" will have you humming to the beach and back."
I:245;1313;Mermaid is a fun, intoxicating Atlantic fantasia for every size minnow in your splash.
I:245;1314;Comes with 3 formats and looks wonderful in blu.
I:245;1315;Great for children but even my wife still sings along.
I:245;1316;She does the deal for now she is speechless (literally) and is human, she is taken in by the prince she desires and they both begin a relationship that seems magical, although Ursula is jealous as now she wants vengeance and the kingdom to herself until Ariel must stop her.
I:245;1317;one of Disney's most beloved and magical movies of all time!
I:245;1318;The animation is nothing sort of breathtaking considering it took 4 years to make with some early CGI and excellent voice acting by Jodi Benson (Perfectly gorgeous voice), Pat Carrol as Ursula, Rene Aubejenos as the goofy French chef, Buddy Hackett as the moronic but charming Scuttle, Ben Wright as Grimbsy, and Samuel E. Wright as the show.
I:245;1319;It won two oscars and become a true milestone in disney animation for a long time thanks to the unique songs by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, a must see!
I:245;1320;Ariel is quite an animated dish and guaranteed to make any man drool.
I:245;1321;This film breaks into the new generation with a fairytale, told as only by Disney.
I:245;1322;I enjoyed the movie as much as my granddaughter did.
I:245;1323;successful films, and the 80s were a very rough time for the company.
I:245;1324;the Little Mermaid was released to theatres in 1989, and suprisingly it did splendid!
I:245;1325;"The movie quickly became one of Disney's first ""classics"" since 1967's The Jungle Book."
I:245;1326;i personally think The Little Mermaid is a wonderful tale of a mermaid, Ariel, who is sick of life under the sea and wants to be human.
I:245;1327;She then makes a deal with Ursula, an underwater witch: she gives Ursula her voice in return for legs.
I:245;1328;If she can find a true love, she gets her voice back.
I:245;1329;everybody who loves Disney movies has to see this film.
I:245;1330;I love the movies win I have my baby girl I'm go to watch this with her till she go to sleep
I:245;1331;My wife and three year old love this movie.
I:245;1332;This is probably her favorite Disney movie of all time.
I:245;1333;This is one of manny great disney movies ever I like how they used Alissa Milano for Ariel face it is great
I:245;1334;Best edition I have ever seen.
I:245;1335;The second Disc is awesome.
I:245;1336;I learned so much about a movie I have loved since I was a child.
I:245;1337;Now mind you, the daughter in question is 22!
I:245;1338;It was a favorite here and I can't believe that the old tape lasted as long as it did.
I:245;1339;enjoy great songs, emotions, and art.
I:245;1340;This has to be one of the best Disney movies of all time!
I:245;1341;Ariel is one of my favorite Disney stars.
I:245;1342;This is a must for those who love the Disney movies when they used to be great.
I:245;1343;This is by far my favorite Disney movie and it was awesome to find it here at a reasonable price.
I:245;1344;Over half the soundtrack of the movie is a masterpiece (most of the rest is excellent), worthy of mention in any top.100 of all time music chart.
I:245;1345;Another great thing about this movie is that it has a big heart.
I:245;1346;There was obviously an unusual amount of love placed into the drawing, the acting of the characters, the voices, the colors, the photography, and the direction.
I:245;1347;If this is not the best animated feature ever made, it certainly is among the top 10 of all time.
I:245;1348;Well worth your money and time.
I:245;1349;One of my favorites made even better.
I:245;1350;Like many I enjoyed this movie as a kid and I still think of it as a good movie.
I:245;1351;This is one of the big animated disney films based on a literary classic that takes liberty with the ending.
I:245;1352;Disney knows that its primary audience loves the happy ending.
I:245;1353;I enjoy this movie for what it is.
I:245;1354;Even though the ending is not the correct one I will say that disney does do a good job at keeping the overall story intact.
I:245;1355;The one thing that disney is going to take into consideration is that if it is going to do more animated movies on literary classics then they need to make sure that the ending is a happy one because that is what its audience on a regular basis expects the studio to deliver.
I:245;1356;Movie is great as expected, although our case was damaged a little bit.
I:245;1357;I still love this classic Disney movie.
I:245;1358;A beautiful addition to my collection.
I:245;1359;I got this movie for my granddaughter and they watched it.
I:245;1360;it is a good movie with underwater grafics.
I:245;1361;she loves it as I knew she would.
I:245;1362;Best thing I've ever done.
I:245;1363;good to explain some of this to the younger ones.
I:245;1364;Bravo for the new version.
I:245;1365;Love the songs and the beauty of under the sea .
I:245;1366;I bought this as a gift for my sister and couldn't help but grab myself a copy as well.
I:245;1367;After two decades of inexorable decline, Disney animation took the giant leap into its renaissance with the story and songs of the beautiful, beloved teenaged mermaid Ariel.
I:245;1368;The magical combination of the fresh and fun Ashman/Menken songs, the gracefully characterized animation of Glenn Keane, the charming vocal performances (especially of Jodi Benson as Ariel and Samuel Wright as Sebastian) and the compelling coming.
I:245;1369;"the success of ""Little Mermaid"" let its creators dare to dream big and the Best Picture."
I:245;1370;The Little Mermaid is the kind of movie that everyone loves, it has wonderful music and usually colorful pictures.
I:245;1371;I bought this movie as a gift for a young cousin.
I:245;1372;I always loved this movie as a kid and am certain she will love it as I did.
I:245;1373;what the heck, mmmmm what to espect from this download excelen sound very good salsa.
I:245;1374;One of my daughter's favorites.

I:245;1408;I actually bought it for my daughters 19th Bday!
I:245;1409;It ws one of her favorite movies.
I:245;1410;it has been digitally remastered and is loaded with special features that i still havent made it all the way through.
I:245;1411;it is also great for children as well as adults because the story spans across all ages.
I:245;1412;Widely recognized at the time as one of the best Disney films in decades, THE LITTLE MERMAID brought the beauty and joy of Disney animation to a new generation of audiences.
I:245;1413;"THE LITTLE MERMAID went on to become one of the most honored animated films of all time, garnering two Academy Awards, on for Best Music, Original Score and the other forBest Music, Original Song, ""Under The Sea."
I:245;1414;The artistic beauty of THE LITTLE MERMAID shines through in every frame.
I:245;1415;Artist James Coleman created exquisitely detailed backdrops for this film.
I:245;1416;The songs of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman are classics in their own right: memorable, toe.
I:245;1417;The characters themselves are unforgettable.
I:245;1418;Ariel's story of the THE LITTLE MERMAID who wanted feet, and her beauty, innocence, and fascination with the human world instantly propelled her into the ranks of the classic Disney princesses .
I:245;1419;She is beloved by millions of little girls across generations, and my little one is no exception.
I:245;1420;She is a strong female character who proves she can take care of herself, along with a little help from her friends.
I:245;1421;My wee one and I love curling up on the sofa together to watch THE LITTLE MERMAID.
I:245;1422;We become captivated by the story each time, and we love to sing.
I:245;1423;It is a wonderful time together.
I:245;1424;when and if i get both of the one's that i ordered, i will be happy to let you know!!!
I:245;1425;A must have for anyone who enjoys a good children's film.
I:245;1426;No resemblance to the little statue in Copenhagen's harbor, but a great tale and one of Disney's best, I think.
I:245;1427;My daighter loves this movie!
I:245;1428;This movie is just as wonderful as when it first came out, will be a great addition to our movie collection.
I:245;1429;This animated film is one of Disney's very best and was the rebirth of great animated films from Disney.
I:245;1430;We must thank Alan Menken and Howard Ashman for their wonderful songs and the brilliant animators and writers for structuring and designing this film so well.
I:245;1431;"The classic songs include ""Kiss the Girl"" and the Oscar."
I:245;1432;I highly recomend this great picture!
I:245;1433;This was a gift for my niece who is 34 years old.
I:245;1434;She loves all the Disney movies, and wanted to add this to her collection.
I:245;1435;releases their movies every couple of years.
I:245;1436;Now I just need for my daughter to enjoy it the way I did when I was younger.
I:245;1437;The Little Mermaid is my son's favorite stories.
I:245;1438;Great movie for the whole familyreceived on time and a great movie to add to one's Disney collection.
I:245;1439;The movie was brightly animated and my very young grandson seemed captivated by it.
I:245;1440;Very entertaining for young and old alike.
I:245;1441;Got it for my grand daughter and boy does she love this movie.
I:245;1442;It's a great story for kids.
I:245;1443;The movie has fun and catchy songs every kid would love.
I:245;1444;As a girl, I adored this film!
I:245;1445;Ariel's spunky self, Eric's charming naivete, and even Ursula's cruel influence all make this film a keeper!
I:245;1446;A stunning Disney classic that features singing to develop characters, shift scenes, and change tone all told in the classic 2.
I:245;1447;Every background is handpainted, all the characters are hand drawn, and best of all, Ariel is a strong role model for young girls.
I:245;1448;But, it is well worth the wait!
I:245;1449;Hilarious sequences starring Scuttle, Sebastian, and Flounder along with some of Ariel's misunderstood concepts about the human world.
I:245;1450;Amazing childhood movie passed down to the kids.
I:245;1451;Everyone can enjoy this film forever more.
I:245;1452;When my 5 year old asked for this movie I was very happy to say yes.
I:245;1453;This is one of the all time classics.
I:245;1454;I love this film, its so adorable.
I:245;1455;I received this product very promptly.
I:245;1456;The product was in excellent condition, and everything was just as promised.
I:245;1457;Even still at age 28, this is my all time favorite movie.
I:245;1458;this a very cute Disney Princess movie, must see for every little girl (including us adults who are kids at hearts).
I:245;1459;so bonus that I have a digital copy that will last a life time.
I:245;1460;I bought it for my daughter for Christmas.
I:245;1461;I'm sure she will love it as much as I did as a kid and still do.
I:245;1462;the people at Disney certainly did an excellent job on improving the original movie.
I:245;1463;They totally cleaned it up, made the colors brighter, the images more vivid.
I:245;1464;they even enhanced the sound, too.
I:245;1465;This film has definitely received the special kind of treatment that few other movies get these days.
I:245;1466;this movie is very romantic, and very thrilling too.
I:245;1467;My favorite scenes are the storm at sea and the intense battle against Ursula towards the end.
I:245;1468;Both scenes make me tingle just about every time I watch them.
I:245;1469;Aside from romance and action, there's plenty of humor in this movie as well, to keep things from being too serious or scary for little kids.
I:245;1470;"Probably the best scene of humor is the ""Les Poissons"" scene, between Sebastian and the royal French chef, Louis."
I:245;1471;That scene is enough to crack anybody up.
I:245;1472;It totally has a grip on you, from the beginning to the end.
I:245;1473;"It is just so excellent, with a big capital ""E""."
I:245;1474;The whole family loved it.
I:245;1475;Case was a bit crushed but who cares, tape was in great condition.
I:245;1476;I hope she will notice the difference!
I:245;1477;:) It is a true Disney classic that I watched when I was growing up and now I get to watch my girls enjoy it!
I:245;1478;Pretty disappointed though to be honest.
I:245;1479;Arrived in a timely manner and in the condition described.
I:245;1480;The Platinum edition does justice to The Little Mermaid.
I:245;1481;It's just a gorgeous traditionally animated masterpiece that kicked off Disney's 2nd Golden Age.
I:245;1482;i enjoyed seeing it again as much as my preschoolers did for the first time this week.
I:245;1483;the Special Features are very nice .
I:245;1484;the Making Of is insightful and fun.
I:245;1485;The addition of the Ride that Almost Was is great for us Disney fans.
I:245;1486;year old daughter loves this movie.
I:245;1487;Briefly, it's a tale of forbidden love.
I:245;1488;out seagull, and you've got all the fixin's necessary for a wonderful Disney tale.
I:245;1489;"this platinum release of ""The Little Mermaid"" is packed with wonderful documentaries about the making of the little film that pretty much saved Disney's future, a short story set to music entitled ""The Little Matchgirl,"" and the expected deleted scenes and obligatory Disney Channel music video."
I:245;1490;"She remakes ""Kiss The Girl."
I:245;1491;"Another interesting feature on this edition is the park ride that was almost built."""
I:245;1492;"It gives the viewer a sneak peek into what would have become a ""Little Mermaid"" ride at one of the Disney parks."
I:245;1493;The Imagineers can be invited along for the ride to give a brief explanation of everything involved in the ride.
I:245;1494;"If you've ever been to a Disney theme park, you'll feel right at home on this ""park ride."
I:245;1495;Overall, this platinum edition is worth it for the film alone.
I:245;1496;It's one of the last animated Disney films that still looks like a classic Disney film.
I:245;1497;She made me realize that we are only bound by our imagination and love conquors all!
I:245;1498;I bought it used, it is in great condition, and we have had no issues with it.
I:245;1499;I love the characters in this movie, especially Ariel and her seven beautiful sisters, Flounder, Sebastian and scuttle!
I:245;1500;Prince Eric was very handsome and I like him.
I:245;1501;It was very good that Ariel was together with him!
I:245;1502;"The songs in this movie are very good and enchanted, especially ""Part of your world""."
I:245;1503;Jodi Benson's voice was wonderful and sweet.
I:245;1504;I hope that she can record a album on her own.
I:245;1505;I love her voice so much!
I:245;1506;It is in perfect condition.
I:245;1507;My niece loves this movie and so do I.

I:245;1514;Great copy of the movie!
I:245;1515;I was so excited to receive it!
I:245;1516;i liked it when I was a child as well.
I:245;1517;Now, both of my daughter's (3 and 8) are hooked on The Little Mermaid.
I:245;1518;Watching it with them brought back memories of my childhood (not to mention made me want a bath)!
I:245;1519;i'd recommend this to any Little Mermaid fan!
I:245;1520;Lots of humor and a happy ending.
I:245;1521;The kids love this one.
I:245;1522;great kids movie, classic Disney, great songs, great characters.
I:245;1523;The color is a bit distorted but still watchable.
I:245;1524;My own girls loved this story and the only one I had was the VHS version.
I:245;1525;It arrived as stated and we had the best movie nite ever.
I:245;1526;The songs were so inspiring that our little granddaughter sang to them, especially kiss the girl.
I:245;1527;My daughters loved this movie when it first was released.
I:245;1528;I was happy to find it for my grand daughter for a good price.
I:245;1529;This is a classic that everyone can enjoy.
I:245;1530;My 3 year old son loves watching it .
I:245;1531;Watching this movie really did bring back memories of my childhood.
I:245;1532;An amazing Disney classic that is suitable for everyone!
I:245;1533;The 2 disc edition is nice with all the extra's.
I:245;1534;I collect Disney movies, so I may be a little bias, but this movie is very good!
I:245;1535;The story and plot is lovely.
I:245;1536;"All of the characters are awesome and I am so happy a happy ending was given to ""Disney's The Little Mermaid""(Ariel)!"
I:245;1537;Disney's story on the other hand is upbeat and full of fun and Prince Eric is a WONDERFUL guy who is a GENTLEMAN and SWEETHEART.
I:245;1538;This movie holds many of my childhood memories and everytime I watch it I feel like my inner child comes out again.
I:245;1539;The special features are also awesome and VERY fun!
I:245;1540;The product was new and sealed as they said.
I:245;1541;Seven more words are required for this review.
I:245;1542;great memories no matter how old or young you are.
I:245;1543;My daughter loved The Little Mermaid and I bought it for my granddaughter .
I:245;1544;bought this as a Christmas gift for my niece to go with the animator doll I had gotten her.
I:245;1545;When I first saw this movie a decade ago I found it enchanting.
I:245;1546;The music is wonderful, the voices perfect, and the movie is full of beautiful scenes and choreography.
I:245;1547;when you get right down to it, this is the message:Young girl sees good.
I:245;1548;now don't get me wrong, I am very pleased that it all worked out for our beautiful and charming cartoon heroine.
I:245;1549;The fact that it is a Disney cartoon and is G. rated and thus PURPORTS to be appropriate for all ages makes that message even more disturbing.
I:245;1550;I got this movie for my daughter and it played fine for about 2 days and now it just skips and she gets so mad everytime cause its her favorite movie.
I:245;1551;It is a pleasure to watch and to listen to.
I:245;1552;Great especially for little ones.
I:245;1553;This is my absolute favorite Disney movie of all time.
I:245;1554;My daughter loves it just like I did when I was a little girl.
I:245;1555;The Little Mermaid not only saw the return of the great studio as a major driving force in cinematic imagination but also rejuvenated the art of animation itself.
I:245;1556;Released in the summer of 1989, Little Mermaid tells the classic Hans Christian Andersen tale of a mermaid who yearns to explore the world above the ocean.
I:245;1557;composed and artfully contrived animated novel adaptations in cinema history.
I:245;1558;The icing on the cake would be winning 2 Academy awards for best song and best musical score.
I:245;1559;understandably the head honchos were concerned with the source material, considering the fable's tragic finale, but a couple of tweaks, a new ending and a singing Jamaican crab later, and the film was ready to set sail.
I:245;1560;The animation took a great leap from Disney's so.
I:245;1561;From here the studio would go on to the even more impressive Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King.
I:245;1562;Arguably their finest hour, it is undoubtedly one of their most impressive and creative tales.
I:245;1563;The Seller sent it right away in good condition, and Good Communication answered all my questions right away We couldn't find it anywhere instores simply glad I was able to find it online.
I:245;1564;This is one of the best classic Disney movies ever made.
I:245;1565;Disney is truly the king of marketing.
I:245;1566;my daughter absolutely loves it and watches it over and over.
I:245;1567;Movie was delivered in a timely manner also!
I:245;1568;So, if you can wait a few months for the headstrong Ariel, the charming Sebastian, and the deliciously evil Ursula, it will be more than worth the wait!
I:245;1569;We received the item quickly and in excellent condition.
I:245;1570;This movie brought me back to when I wad a young girl and now im able to share those memories with my daughter!!!
I:245;1571;This is one of the best Disney movies I have seen, and it holds a special place in my heart because it was my brother's favorite movie.
I:245;1572;It's so great to have my own version, so I can watch it whenever I want!
I:245;1573;We like it because it is a great original classic.
I:245;1574;Love the movie but I have yet to receive the product!
I:245;1575;My daughters were so excited to receive this movie!
I:245;1576;So happy I was able to find this when it wasn't be sold in stores!
I:245;1577;I recieved The Little Mermaid brand new still in the wrapper and it has a big spot on it.
I:245;1578;The classic movie that every little girl and their moms love!
I:245;1579;I got it here at a fraction of the price I would have paid in the store.
I:245;1580;Great person to do business with
I:245;1581;The movie and its case are in great condition.
I:245;1582;The movie made a great addition to our collection.
I:245;1583;This movie is my all time favorite.
I:245;1584;Perfect condition, not a complaint in the world!
I:245;1585;The Little Mermaid is classic and I am happy to add it to our collection.
I:245;1586;Prince Eric is Ariel's love interest, this is a very romantic movie and it will have you almost crying because it's so sweet.
I:245;1587;ariel's friends include flounder, a crab (Sebastian) and a seagul who make up interesting yet funny stories on the where.
I:245;1588;In all, this is a beautiful tale and it's a definite MUST OWN.
I:245;1589;This movie is considered the first of a period known as the Disney Renaissance, which would soon usher in other blockbusters like The Lion King, Aladdin, and Hercules.
I:245;1590;John Musker, Clement's co. director on The Great Mouse Detective, wrote a twenty.
I:245;1591;broadway writer Howard Ashman teamed up with composer Alan Menken to create a Broadway.
I:245;1592;styled musical score that would highlight the plot through memorable musical numbers.
I:245;1593;First, The Little Mermaid was the first animated fairy tale since Sleeping Beauty in 1959, proving that contemporary audiences were receptive to that story.
I:245;1594;"The film won two Oscars, for best song (""Under the Sea"") and best musical score."
I:245;1595;The Little Mermaid was the first Disney film to win an Academy Award since The Rescuers in 1977.
I:245;1596;in addition to success at the Oscars, the film also received two awards at the 1990 Grammys.
I:245;1597;The film won Best Album for Children and Best Soundtrack for a Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media.
I:245;1598;By initiating an era of success known as the Disney Renaissance, this film will go down in history both in animation and in the hearts of avid Disney.
I:245;1599;But I like everyone else fell in love with this moving and I put it in among all the other Disney classic fills such as Snow White, Cinderella, Peter Pan, Alice In Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty.
I:245;1600;This has always been one of my favorite movies.
I:245;1601;My dad, who is in his 70's loves it also.
I:245;1602;I'm hoping that my grand daughter loves it just as much as me!
I:245;1603;A favorite movie from my childhood, and I'm glad to finally see it on Blu.
I:245;1604;My daughter loves this movie.
I:245;1605;She wanted it for Christmas, so I got it for her.
I:245;1606;Sebastin the crab and scuttle the seagull are great, but the very cute fish, flounder is and will always be my favorite in this disney masterpiece.
I:245;1607;My granddaughters love this movie.
I:245;1608;It is definitely their favorite and they go around singing the songs!
I:245;1609;I will be giving this as a gift to my granddaughter for xmas so this was nice to find since she has excited over Arial all summer and all we could find now is blu.
I:245;1610;This is a wonderful movie.
I:245;1611;Characters are available and make great gifts.

I:245;1613;This is my daughter's all time favorite movie.
I:245;1614;This movie is just as good as I remembered.
I:245;1615;It's a classic Disney fairy tale, full of love, longing, fear, action, and beautiful songs.
I:245;1616;And the scene with Sebastian and the chef is priceless!
I:245;1617;Another favorite of granddaughter she can now have two ways to use in further.
I:245;1618;Would always recommend these to children.
I:245;1619;This is a great addition to our collection.

I:245;1622;I grew up loving this movie.

I:245;1624;It was The Little Mermaid that heralded the renaissance of Disney animation and led to classics such as Beauty and The Beast and Aladdin.
I:245;1625;I'm not really going to go into too much detail, but suffice it to say, The Little Mermaid is an animated classic that will stay in a beloved part of your memory forever.

I:245;1697;I love this movie and it is wonderful to watch on the big screen.
I:245;1698;The Diamond Edition definitely is clearer.
I:245;1699;Every little girl needs to have her own copy of the great movie.
I:245;1700;daughter loves it and will sit and watch it over and over.
I:245;1701;The kids and I Loved it.

I:245;1705;I bought this video for my toddler grandkids.
I:245;1706;They love it, and I love snuggling up and watching it with them.
I:245;1707;It is a great movie, was when it first came out and watched it with my daughters and I enjoy watching even more now with my grandchildren, not to long, nice music and easy to follow.
I:245;1708;I got this as a gift and my niece was very excited.
I:245;1709;I haven't been informed of any problem, so I can all believe that she loved it.
I:245;1710;She's 2, she loves everything mermaid.
I:245;1711;This is the only one she asks for besides Elmo, so it's a hit!
I:245;1712;I ordered a used copy, it arrived fast, in good condition, and with the original cover, etc.
I:245;1713;This is one of the reasons I love Amazon so much!
I:245;1714;This has to be one of the best, if not THE best Disney Animated Features of all time!!!
I:245;1715;Yet, this did something so special: It brought me to animation and kept me enthralled even to this day!
I:245;1716;The colors, the visuals, the music score, everything about this awesome flick is unforgettable.
I:245;1717;luster features produced by other companies of that day and today!
I:245;1718;My favourite character is URSULA!

I:245;1733;She was so excited, she opened it immediately to watch with all of the kids, but it was unplayable.
I:245;1734;This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.
I:245;1735;It came very quickly and the cover is so nice.
I:245;1736;I know Paige will love it!
I:245;1737;Well worth the wait for the restoration on this one.
I:245;1738;This movie is great for both kids and adults.
I:245;1739;even if you're an adult, you can still laugh with the characters, and the beauty of the scenes is exceptional.
I:245;1740;the songs are memorable as well.
I:245;1741;This is definitely one of Disney's best productions.
I:245;1742;there are two interesting things that my friends and I noticed.
I:245;1743;This is my favorite Disney animation and now it is my daughter's favorite as well!!!
I:245;1744;She just loves the movie and I get the biggest kick out of listening to her humming the tunes.
I:245;1745;And my daughter enjoyed watching it.
I:245;1746;I really didn't know what to expect, but it is a new movie, and came factory sealed.
I:245;1747;I opened it to make sure it worked and it is great.
I:245;1748;My daughters love this movie, shipping was fast.
I:245;1749;This was also one of my favorites when I was young.
I:245;1750;i think that these are the best movies ever made.
I:245;1751;Thank you for the super fast shipping!!!
I:245;1752;My daughter loves this movie!
I:245;1753;I bought it for my grandchildren.
I:245;1754;Children learn a lot from the good Disney films.
I:245;1755;This movie is my favorite Disney movie.
I:245;1756;The story line is great and so is the movie!
I:245;1757;It is for all ages and it is a movie you can watch over and over again!
I:245;1758;I highly recommend this movie to any one who likes Disney or mermaids!
I:245;1759;Snow White heralded the start of Disney's first phase of classic feature animations.
I:245;1760;This film however deserves the Classic label and, along with The Lion King, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast, is one of the run of 'Classics' of the 1990s.
I:245;1761;Although this run was broken with Pocahontas (ignoring Rescuers Down Under) and has only recovered fitfully over the intervening years (the last 'Classic' was probably in reality Lilo and Stitch), The Little Mermaid deserves real credit for bringing the Disney Studios standards back up so high in such a short space of time.
I:245;1762;It's amazing to think that the ho.
I:245;1763;hum Oliver and Co was released the year before.
I:245;1764;the success of the film probably has it's roots in the employment of Ashman and Menken as lyrist and composer.
I:245;1765;As well as writing the songs, they became heavily involved in the story and so Little Mermaid plays more like a Broadway musical than a traditional 'cartoon'.
I:245;1766;so with a great score and story, Little Mermaid holds all of the trump cards by also having a great script (socially relevant), well.
I:245;1767;rounded characters (even down to the support players), perfect voice casting (stand up Sam Wright!)
I:245;1768;and almost perfect animation (some small sections have obviously been rushed but not so they would spoil the film).
I:245;1769;The film was so successful that it also started the now obligatory Disney spin.
I:245;1770;ray and it was in fact Blu.
I:245;1771;A great movie for kids and grown ups.
I:245;1772;Fun to watch for the whole family.
I:245;1773;This used to be my favorite growing up.
I:245;1774;Now it's my daughter's favorite.
I:245;1775;It keeps my three year old intertwined.
I:245;1776;Gotta love the brilliance and detail of Blu Ray movies!
I:245;1777;This is one of the best cartoon movies of all time and the music is fabulous.
I:245;1778;I love this movie and I'm over 60
I:245;1779;I love the movie and my little friend did as well.
I:245;1780;Thank you Amazon for making In The Vault things available when they are needed.
I:245;1781;She loves all of the Disney movies.
I:245;1782;My Grandchildren loved this movie.
I:245;1783;I will use you again in the future.
I:245;1784;My Grandchildren loved this movie.
I:245;1785;I will use you again in the future.
I:245;1786;I watched it with my children scores of times and now look forward to viewing it with my grandchildren
I:245;1787;The Little Mermaid is one of my favorite Disney Movies, and it's an excellent children's movie.
I:245;1788;Wonderful movie to watch, beautiful coloring and music.
I:245;1789;This movie was out before Beauty and the Beast and I enjoyed it!
I:245;1790;It is one of the Disney's great classics of all time!
I:245;1791;time favorite Disney animated film and have been eagerly awaiting the Platinum Edition of this movie since.
I:245;1792;well, since Disney started the Platinum line.
I:245;1793;well, Disney has finally rectified that problem.
I:245;1794;new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix (along with regular Dolby Digital 5.1).
I:245;1795;One of the best Disney movies.
I:245;1796;Her brightness contrasting with Ursula's dark demeanor creates a powerful battle for the love of Prince Eric.
I:245;1797;First we got Beauty and the Beast, then The Lion King, then Aladdin.
I:245;1798;Following in its footsteps of the aforementioned predecessors (along with other Platinum editions Snow White, Bambi, Cinderella, and Lady and the Tramp), The Little Mermaid Platinum edition will help do justice to a magical tale for all ages, complete with behind the scenes bonus features.
I:245;1799;Absolutely one of Disney's best movies.
I:245;1800;My kids loved it when it first came out and now the next generation loves it just as much.
I:245;1801;I wanted the digital copy, so I bought.
I:245;1802;tahnl you so much, my daugfter loved it!
I:245;1803;disney handles/examines their products perfectly before its released.
I:245;1804;If you've forgotten this animated movie, see it again with new eyes.
I:245;1805;Overpriced but always a classic.
I:245;1806;I bought this because it got re.
I:245;1807;I also really appreciated that the item was available.
I:245;1808;Little Mermaid is a great Disney classic, and the other reviewers have done it justice.
I:245;1809;It is one of the most delicately, artfully done of all Disney cartoons, long or short, I have ever seen!
I:245;1810;like in many Disney movies, there's lots of singing and animal friends.
I:245;1811;There was a particularly memorable one where the sea life goes into song and dance, and it was a lot of fun to watch.
I:245;1812;This is one of the best classic disney movies I've ever seen I absolutely love it anyone who wants to see this movie go ahead and watch it.
I:245;1813;This is on of my grandchildren's favorite movies.
I:245;1814;These days, it's all about the celebrity voices, and how many you can spot before the credits roll.
I:245;1815;little Mermaid still holds the magic it had for me when I was young.
I:245;1816;I got it for my niece because she was named after the little mermaid.
I:245;1817;She's 2 it was awesome to watch her dance to the songs and she made it thru the whole movie.
I:245;1818;I'm a kid at heart and have watched it a couple more times.
I:245;1819;I live my Disney classics!
I:245;1820;This movie came out when I was two, and I still love it.
I:245;1821;captivating, the song (I wanna be where the people are.)
I:245;1822;I'm singing it next time I have to audition for a play.
I:245;1823;I love this movie a lot and i hope you do, too!
I:245;1824;The case had a little wear and tear, but it was great for the price.
I:245;1825;ray that they have available in the stores right now, so when i found this i was ecstatic!
I:245;1826;This classic Disney is remastered well :) Love this story!
I:245;1827;love it unopened and perfect its a movie I enjoyed as a little girl and now I can enjoy it with my three girls(5yrs, 3, 8mos)
I:245;1828;Ariel is a favorite in our house!
I:245;1829;Great movie, arrived quicker than we expected.
I:245;1830;the new and improved animation of this timeless movie makes a big difference.
I:245;1831;My kids enjoyed this movie very muchl
I:245;1832;Glad to have it in my collection and love all the extras for the diamond edition
I:245;1833;It took a LONG time to get here but it was worth the wait.
I:245;1834;The little mermaid was my favorite growing up and this special edition had concept Art in it which I'd exactly what a budding artist loves.
I:245;1835;I'm so glad I have it and I watch it regularly to this day.
I:245;1836;Great price, fast delivery for an awesome Disney classic.
I:245;1837;Since a child I loved this movie.
I:245;1838;It was in perfect condition and came at great timing.
I:245;1839;I loved my overall experience.
I:245;1840;My daughter loves this movie just as I did when I was little.
I:245;1841;My daughter loves the movie.
I:245;1842;I recommend the movie to all children.
I:245;1843;This film is filled with wonderful characters, beautiful music, and a whole lot of laughter and fun.
I:245;1844;I remember the first time I took my daughter to see it.
I:245;1845;We were smiling at eachother and laughing together throughout the whole show.
I:245;1846;We loved it then and we cherish it now in our own video collection!
I:245;1847;Very cute, great condition, and very sweet!
I:245;1848;Im not even halfway through and it truly is an amazing film!
I:245;1849;My daughter's favorite all time movie was The Little Mermaid.
I:245;1850;and sell it as new on the web.
I:245;1851;People who are selling authentic discs usually know they are rare and valuable and typically charge more (think ~upper $20's to $40's) than the bootleggers.
I:245;1852;I've been thrilled with the beautiful blu.
I:245;1853;ray transfers of most of Disney's animated classics.
I:245;1854;ray upgrade that you can see the brush strokes in the backgrounds.
I:245;1855;So I thought that surely The Little Mermaid, one of Disney's premiere titles, would receive a similar deluxe treatment.
I:245;1856;Disney's translations to other languages are THE BEST so is a good teaching to our kids to watch the movie in Spanish one time and the next in English, like that they learns both languages well.
I:245;1857;A good movie with a happy ending.
I:245;1858;Looks great except for a couple little changes and one screw up 4 1/2 stars for looks.
I:245;1859;I understand Disney is taking the Bl.
I:245;1860;Sound also scores a 4 1/2, IMO
I:245;1861;This just arrived, the family loves it.
I:245;1862;And the reason why is because ever sense I first saw it I loved it and I always will.
I:245;1863;She know the entire dialog.
I:245;1864;I enjoyed it the first two times,
I:245;1865;I downloaded the digital copy and put it onto my iPad so the kids could watch it while traveling during Thanksgiving.
I:245;1866;aholic, but this was a great movie when it first came out (with the scandalous original poster that wasn't nearly as big a deal as everyone goes on about), and it still is.
I:245;1867;The Little Mermaid is one hour and twenty.
I:245;1868;Before she leaves Prince Eric sees her face and hear hers voice for a brief moment.
I:245;1869;She gives Ariel three day for the Prince to fall in love with her and it must be love true kiss and she has to do this without her voice.
I:245;1870;Ursula sees this and turns herself human and uses Ariel singing voice to trick Prince Eric.
I:245;1871;"some trivia about this movie
I:245;1872;The two Academy Awards the movie won were for Best Music, Original Score and Best Music, Original Song (Under The Sea).
I:245;1873;Kiss the Girl was also nominated for Original Song.
I:245;1874;The Little Mermaid also won two Grammy and Golden Globe awards.
I:245;1875;The Little Mermaid is a wonderful movie and gets an AAAAA+++++.
I:245;1876;Lady and the TrampMusic Video* Part of Your World
I:245;1877;It was delivered on time and my kids love it.
I:245;1878;24 is one of the best television series that I have watched in a long time.
I:245;1879;I was a diehard fairy tale fan.
I:245;1880;Hans Christian Anderson did not write this ending, but the Disney writers make up for that altering the story to be more kid friendly and still appeal to entertainment standards.
I:245;1881;Reading Anderson's version and watching Disney's gives us the best of both worlds.
I:245;1882;Watched it the day it delivered and felt like a kid again!!
I:245;1883;This is a classic childhood movie that all kids must see.
I:245;1884;love, love love, love (I wonder just how much I can say love about this movie).
I:245;1885;This is one of the first Disney films i ever remember seeing, and it is still as fresh today as it was about 25 years ago.
I:245;1886;Oh well maybe next time
I:245;1887;It is the perfect addition to our disney princess collection.
I:245;1888;Good to know kids these days still enjoy the movies that I grew up with when I was a kid.
I:245;1889;My 3 year old granddaughter is into mermaids and I had to get it for her to enjoy.
I:245;1890;Of course, I enjoyed it too.
I:245;1891;As a mom of a 4.5 year old girl I wanted it, but also for myself as it's a great movie.
I:245;1892;It's a fun movie with great music and Ursula!
I:245;1893;but to me she is the best Disney villain!
I:245;1894;She is so fun in her nastiness!
I:245;1895;I love her songs and sassiness.
I:245;1896;She is such a monster but somehow likable until the end anyway.
I:245;1897;Sweet movie that is a lot of fun with many lovable characters.
I:245;1898;There are the usual stereotypes at play but the entertainment is there and my kids laugh out loud at the scenarios between Sebastian and the chef.
I:245;1899;I love hearing that laughter!
I:245;1900;The Little Mermaid is a smashing blend of romance, action, music, and superb Disney animation.
I:245;1901;will Ariel wed the handsome prince, make her dad understand what she wants, and defeat the evil Sea.
I:245;1902;It's a Disney flick, folks.
I:245;1903;The score and musical numbers are a sheer delight (and the ones for Ashman and Menken's next project, Beauty and the Beast , are even better), and you'll be humming them for weeks after seeing this film.
I:245;1904;"it also bears mentioning that unlike many other Disney cartoons, in which the violence level is quite high for a G. rated film, the violence in The Little Mermaid is very restrained
I:245;1905;my 2 year old loves it.
I:245;1906;Love old frame by frame animation and hand drawn.
I:245;1907;Highly recommend it to all the fans of Disney in general and of the 1980s.1990s Disney work in particular.
I:245;1908;loving it, great, wonderful my granddaughter love it and my adult kids even me .
I:245;1909;She always got to be Ariel whenever the girls played Princess.
I:245;1910;That's how much she loves Ariel.
I:245;1911;You have all the answers after all, and a happy ending will prove that to everyone, esp yourself.5.
I:245;1912;As beauty is what lands a rich and handsome man (again, the qualities which matter most).
I:245;1913;Do indeed work with Satanic Black Magicians, as the results will be positive, in the end.
I:245;1914;Always use the back door.
I:245;1915;All and all an excellent film for young girls to watch over and over and over.
I:245;1916;I am happy to have this movie again and to have my daughter watch it.
I:245;1917;The movie was in good condition and that was really good.
I:245;1918;Disney movies are awesome and I loved this one growing up and was excited to get a good deal on its release!
I:245;1919;It is a children's classic.
I:245;1920;A fun and visually rich movie.
I:245;1921;I loved this movie when I was a little girl and now I get to enjoy all over again!
I:245;1922;Not only my daughter loves this movie but my son is just as entertained!
I:245;1923;This is, and always will be, my favorite Disney movie.
I:245;1924;so cute im 22 and had to have this because i loved it as a kid
I:245;1925;Disney should continue to make movies like this.

I:245;1931;Perfect conditon and good packing.
I:245;1932;It was a gift for a child that was well received.
I:245;1933;Anyway, I have got to say that this is one of the best Disney Films.
I:245;1934;This is Disney at it's best!
I:245;1935;The Little Mermaid made the way for new musicals such as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King.
I:245;1936;Visually it is delightful and the animation is so fluent.
I:245;1937;The songs make you want to dance and the movie makes you feel like a kid, weither you are one or you are 100.
I:245;1938;I think it's one of the best cartoons that Disney produced!

I:245;1945;Not to mention it is a wonderful story.
I:245;1946;My kids have already seen The Little Mermaid hundreds of times, but absolutely enjoyed the Two Disc Special Edition.
I:245;1947;Their favorite so far has been the Disney ride they take.
I:245;1948;It looks and sounds like you are actually on a Disney attraction.
I:245;1949;Very cool for the younger kids.
I:245;1950;He likes the platinum edition that adds a special touch.
I:245;1951;One of the best Disney movies as sea characters come to life singing and dancing creating an underworld of fun and colorful entertainment of sealife imagination.
I:245;1952;They are many vendors out there, but this one is great!
I:245;1953;Overall the kids love watching the movie and I highly recommend to add to your Disney Collection.

I:245;1960;Watched it before a Disney trip and it was well worth it.
I:245;1961;This movie holds up, even 10.

I:245;1966;I bought this for my daughters and they love it!
I:245;1967;The Little Mermaid is a wonderful princess movie.

I:245;1976;I'm guessing they're on the blu.
I:245;1977;I loved that so I still rate it 5 stars for that reason.
I:245;1978;I always feel like these movies are overpriced but for all the formats I got with this one it was worth it.
I:245;1979;This video seems to be genuine Disney.
I:245;1980;The Little Mermaid is pretty close to being their #1 movie of all time (in their minds).
I:245;1981;Found it, bought it and kids lives are complete again.
I:245;1982;This is my daughter's favorite movie!
I:245;1983;Wonderful story and great music.
I:245;1984;So happy I can share this with my twin toddlers!
I:245;1985;In a wonderful kingdom under the sea lives the beautiful mermaid princess, Ariel, seventh and youngest daughter of King Triton, ruler of Atlantica.
I:245;1986;Ariel's feisty spirit and gorgeous red hair make her a bit of a favorite among Triton's daughters, and her passion for learning human ways and collecting of their artifacts causes much stress to her family and friends.
I:245;1987;After spying a handsome, young, human prince aboard a ship one evening and saving his life, Ariel is instantly love.
I:245;1988;like tail into a lovely pair of human legs, but there is a condition attached.
I:245;1989;Voiceless and only left with her beauty and exuberant charm, Ariel and her animal friends must try their best to make the prince see that she is the lost love he has been searching for, but the Sea Witch will do all she can to stop them before time runs out!
I:245;1990;"With just the right combination of story, music, voice talent, and visuals, ""The Little Mermaid"" turned out to be one of the Disney Studios' most perfect achievements!"
I:245;1991;The Oscar winning music is particularly noteworthy, as one of the film's most groundbreaking moves was bringing a Broadway style to its musical storytelling.
I:245;1992;"This was thanks to the amazing team of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who would return to do more brilliant Disney music during the so. called ""Renaissance"" kicked."
I:245;1993;The film, of course, is based on the famous fairytale by Hans Christian Anderson.
I:245;1994;The original story is actually a bit of a downer, something Anderson had a flair for, and the one, rare complaint that viewers sometimes make about the movie is how much it strays for its Disneyfied rewrite of the story, particularly with its happy ending.
I:245;1995;But, this complaint doesn't come up that often, and Disney's take successfully carries on the original theme of a mermaid wanting more than her under.
I:245;1996;It also beautifully and convincingly handles the father/daughter relationship and the difficult issue of letting go when the time is right.
I:245;1997;The Little Mermaid continues to be one of Disney's most beloved animated classics, and with good reason.
I:245;1998;now, this is easily one of my favorite Disney animated features.
I:245;1999;I suppose it is for most Disney fans, but with me there's an added incentive: I am absolutely in love with Ariel!
I:245;2000;I mean, she's pretty much perfection, with that voice, that bubbly personality, that hair, those eyes, that nose, those lips (notice, I'm not commenting on those seashells, because I'm not a pig, but they're great too), .
I:245;2001;Anyways, point is, I was naturally very psyched about this new, 2.
I:245;2002;And, in general, I'm very happy with it.
I:245;2003;Moving on, Disc One also has a wonderfully informative and at times touching commentary with writer/directors Ron Clements and John Musker, and composer Alan Menken.
I:245;2004;"What we get is a cute, Disney Channel star promoting video of Ashley Tisdale singing ""Kiss the Girl,"" and it's fine."
I:245;2005;disc Two is where the majority of extra features can be found, and while I'm not blown away by the sheer amount of stuff (as I have been in some past Platinum releases), there's still lots of really neat stuff here.
I:245;2006;"The main attraction here should be ""Treasures Untold: The Making of the Little Mermaid,"" which can be found in the Backstage Disney section, and it's certainly a great behind the scenes featurette on the making off the film, full of great interviews and insight into those difficult days at Disney Animation."
I:245;2007;"Yes, that definitely should have been included in the ""Platinum Edition."""
I:245;2008;"Anyway, as I said, the main attraction here SHOULD be the behind the scenes featurette, but there's something else very special on Disc Two of ""The Little Mermaid."""
I:245;2009;"It's a beautifully done piece with a true to the story ending (believe it or not) that was originally intended for the canceled ""Fantasia 2006."""
I:245;2010;No Disney fan should miss owning this amazing piece of Disney filmmaking!
I:245;2011;It's an actual virtual ride on a Disney theme park attraction that was never created: an actual Little Mermaid ride!
I:245;2012;Disc Two also features some great deleted scenes selections, an improved DisneyPedia that plays all in one chunk, the original theatrical trailer, the very cool early presentation reel, a retrospective featurette on the effects unit, a charming featurette that looks at Hans Christian Anderson's Little Mermaid in comparison with Disney's take, and, of course, the art galleries.
I:245;2013;I always enjoy seeing the character development galleries, particularly of Disney's loveliest females.
I:245;2014;This commercial, with it's wonderful, exclusive animation of Ariel and her fish friend, Flounder, would have been a perfect Easter Egg.
I:245;2015;Now, this second one is the Easter Egg I was so happy to find!
I:245;2016;It's not enough footage, we should have been given more, but it was still nice to see again along with the brief, recent interview moments with Sherri!
I:245;2017;This is definitely one of the best animated movies of all time.
I:245;2018;After years of inactivity Walt Disney studios came back with this masterpiece.
I:245;2019;"Everything on it is excellent
I:245;2020;This movie combines cuteness and funny moments (BTW try to see Sebastian talking like Cuban in Spanish it is simply hilarious and much more fun than in English!)
I:245;2021;Definitely a MUST have for any collector.
I:245;2022;one of the best of the modern Disney movies.
I:245;2023;Teaches a great lesson about love, friendship and good and evil.
I:245;2024;Amazon had some great selections, price wise, and I was pleased to find this at a good price.
I:245;2025;It is now in her collection and she will enjoy it for years to come!
I:245;2026;If nothing else, the color restoration and elimination of film grain are both excellent.
I:245;2027;first off though, I want to thank Disney for bringing these classics back into our homes.
I:245;2028;Seeing it again brought back everything as to why I loved it.
I:245;2029;I loved the characters, especially Sebastian (Even at my age, I still find the scene with the cook in the kitchen hilarious).
I:245;2030;and I still love it just as much today as I did 13 years ago.
I:245;2031;"It's the first one that dares be hilarious with songs like ""Les Poissons"" graphically depicting the killing and preparation of a fish for dinner, and also pokes fun at humans with ""Under the Sea""."
I:245;2032;Plus the underwater theme is used perfectly.
I:245;2033;when I think about it, it was also kind of revolutionary as far as Disney's Princesses go : Ariel was the first one to have a prince with an actual name (aka Eric).
I:245;2034;"In the first three, the prince was always referred to as ""Prince charming"" if I'm not mistaken."
I:245;2035;i thought also that with the Little Mermaid, the dynamics changed between the girl and the prince (and thus paving the way for Beauty and The Beast).
I:245;2036;I also believe he's the first prince to be saved from a Disney Princess.
I:245;2037;in any case, here the Little Mermaid is beautifully restored (except for the staircase CGI makeover at one point).
I:245;2038;It's a beautiful movie that's absolutely worth adding to your collection of Disney's.
I:245;2039;"Even as a ""young"" adult, I find that the magic is still there, the music is still just as catchy and amazing (It won 2 Oscars for Best Song and Best Original Music), and even after a number of viewings, it's one of those movies you can't get enough of and you'll always love to see again and again."
I:245;2040;This movie will be given the same treatment as all of the previous Platinum Editions (Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, Aladdin, Bambi, Cinderella).
I:245;2041;disc set will include brand new bonus features and a fully restored version of the film.
I:245;2042;this movie is without a doubt, Disney at it's best.
I:245;2043;i highly recommend waiting for the Platinum release.
I:245;2044;This is a great movie for anyone.
I:245;2045;Our kids love the songs.
I:245;2046;warming and beautiful the film was.
I:245;2047;the first step toward making this film a true Disney masterpiece, is the fact that the story is so strong.
I:245;2048;the animation, whilst not as accomplished as some of their slightly later films (such as the Hunchback of Notre Dame) is a delight to behold, and it really makes the mer.
I:245;2049;people seem very believable in the movement and actions.
I:245;2050;The animators of Ariel must of been very pleased with themselves, she comes across as being real (well, as real as a cartoon can be) I can see in her facial expressions will genuine expressions, not pale imitations as is so often the case in animation.
I:245;2051;the soundtrack really makes it, generally, I find Disney side.
I:245;2052;'The extras are also very worthwhile, a fascinating making of, some games for the children and deleted scenes (utilising unused storyboards.)
I:245;2053;There is also a commentary and a new music video for 'Kiss the Girl.'
I:245;2054;I really hope that it will be Oscar Nominated .
I:245;2055;equally satisfying for any child or film critic.
I:245;2056;Amazing movie, not sure how anyone could give this a bad rating!!
I:245;2057;Bought this for a friend and she loved it.
I:245;2058;Another great job by disney restoring this movie.
I:245;2059;You will sing a long with the great songs.
I:245;2060;sebastian the crab is hilarious!
I:245;2061;"The false illusion of ""happily ever after"" is SO cliche but it's certainly entertaining!"
I:245;2062;I hate that Disney is locking up these great movies that I want my children to be able to see.
I:245;2063;This seller's copy was magnificent and has brought hours of joy already to a grateful four year old!
I:245;2064;Glad it was the start of the new Disney generation.
I:245;2065;My daughter loves this movie and it was new as stated.
I:245;2066;Gotta love the Little Mermaid.
I:245;2067;It came on time and in perfect condition.
I:245;2068;animated movies they are making are bad, but that they will never be as memorable as The Little Mermaid, and others such as Beauty and the Beast.
I:245;2069;"I even caught myself sheding a tear at the end of the movie
I:245;2070;Part of what made The Little Mermaid so wonderful was the colorful music that was sung throughout the movie.
I:245;2071;"One obvious example is ""Part of Your World"" which depicted Ariel's longing to venture out of her ""watery"" existence, and witness great things above the surface."
I:245;2072;I have a newfound respect for Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (the brain.
I:245;2073;"children of the music we all recognize and love)
I:245;2074;Hopefully Disney will release a special edition for this movie also.
I:245;2075;I'm man enough to write a review of a great animated classic).
I:245;2076;Great :) I Bought My Pre.
I:245;2077;copy Now :)I'm so Happy about thisLittle Mermaid (Two.
I:245;2078;but most will generally agree that the sixties, seventies, and eighties proved to be a dark time for the company.
I:245;2079;easy, mermaid features a brilliant blend of great animation, a great story, great performances, and oscar.
I:245;2080;the animation itself is rich and alive.
I:245;2081;the characters are all given great details that make them feel much more alive.
I:245;2082;the backgrounds are all amazingly brilliant and provide a great look at life under the sea from their colors as well combined with their startling detail.
I:245;2083;the combination of these elements provide an experience that is, for the first time in many years, magical.
I:245;2084;the use of another fairy tail seems to serve the company well yet again.
I:245;2085;the additional characters and character development make for a great movie as well.
I:245;2086;from the zaniness of scuttle, to the delightful wickedness of ursula, these are some great characters that lead to a great picture.
I:245;2087;a lot of the greatness of those characters is owed to the performances, and wow.
I:245;2088;pat carroll as ursula is perfect.
I:245;2089;these performers all bring life that the animated movie needs to work.
I:245;2090;the music is absolutely stunning.
I:245;2091;but the great thing about all these songs is that they all progress the story brilliantly, just as a proper musical should.
I:245;2092;everything about this movie is fun, fresh, and everyhting a great family movie should be.
I:245;2093;the characters, performers, and songs all bring a life and freedom that is really great to see.
I:245;2094;This is one of the Best Disney classics because it is such a fun story but original music as well.
I:245;2095;Beautiful and fun underwater scenes.
I:245;2096;Instant downloads are excellent for the iPad.
I:245;2097;The movie was available immediately and works great.
I:245;2098;My son loves this movie!
I:245;2099;Watching it again brought back so many memories and I loved it today as much as I did at 10!
I:245;2100;I mostly love it because it is nostalgic.
I:245;2101;loved it when it came out years ago and even more now.
I:245;2102;my daughter loves mermaids so this is one of her favorites.
I:245;2103;Received the video in a very timely manner and it was exactly as advertised!
I:245;2104;It was a gift from grand ma.
I:245;2105;This Christmas will be extra special with the addition of this classic Disney movie!
I:245;2106;He loved it and couldn't wait to get it so he could watch it whenever he wanted.
I:245;2107;Excellent movie for all ages.
I:245;2108;It came in a timely fashion and has been watched numerous times already.
I:245;2109;Story, grahics and animation are all outstanding.
I:245;2110;First of all the movie arrived much earlier than was estimated online, so that in itself was a pleasant surprise.
I:245;2111;released for years so as soon as I saw it I knew I had to have it.
I:245;2112;I am extremely happy with the product.
I:245;2113;Always good to have your favorite movie on hand just in case you have a wretched day!!
I:245;2114;Thank you so much, my daughter loves this movie as much as I did when I was a little girl.
I:245;2115;Classic disney movie my daughter loves it!
I:245;2116;Great for the whole family too!
I:245;2117;This is one of the best Disney movies.
I:245;2118;So happy this movie is on Blu Ray!
I:245;2119;I really love this movie.
I:245;2120;To be able for my kids to watch any time and any where is the absolute best thing.
I:245;2121;Delivery was quick and movie was in excellent condition!
I:245;2122;The Little Mermaid is the most beautiful movie I've seen in my life.
I:245;2123;The music is memberable, the colors is beautiful and every minutes you watch it, it beyond breathtaking.
I:245;2124;this is a Christmas gift for my sister, she and I have loved this movie, since we where kids back in the good old days and to see it on Blu.
I:245;2125;exactly what the title says a story of a young girls adventure and finding true love while battling an evil witch
I:245;2126;this is truly my favorite Disney animated movie.
I:245;2127;I love all the songs, the vivid colors, and the main characters.
I:245;2128;Really great songs and a perfect story for both kids and adults.
I:245;2129;This movie is in awesome condition.
I:245;2130;My 2 year old daughter loves this movie!
I:245;2131;I'm so glad I bought it!
I:245;2132;And she loves singing with Ariel!
I:245;2133;I absolutely love the little mermaid and was super excited to find it online for $25.98 for the 2 disc edition.
I:245;2134;It looks amazing on blu ray.
I:245;2135;Remembered my childhood and now my stepson enjoys it with me.
I:245;2136;The extras on the blue ray copy was fun too!
I:245;2137;This movie amazes me every time that I see it.
I:245;2138;It is such a beautiful movie and so tastefully done.
I:245;2139;I truly believe it's a movie for the young and the young at heart.
I:245;2140;It's all about falling in love and doing anything for the person that you love even risking your own life.
I:245;2141;The songs really touch my heart, the characters are so funny, sweet and lovable from Flounder the dumb and sweet fish to Sebastian the funny and witty crab to Scuttle the absentminded and crazy seagull.
I:245;2142;It is just a beautiful story and ever since I saw it when it first came out in the theatres with my mother it has grown on me and I have loved and cherished this movie ever since.
I:245;2143;The songs are everything from upbeat to romantic and the actors/actresses picked to do the voices for the characters are so talented and are just made for the parts.
I:245;2144;I fell in love with this movie and the characters in it in 1989 and am still in love with it today.
I:245;2145;The Little Mermaid: being transported from real life into the beautiful underworld of the ocean filled with mermaids/mermen, fish, and many more made me want to be part of that world
I:245;2146;Now that I am a mom it was such a pleasure seeing that my little one enjoy the movie just as much as I did.
I:245;2147;He loves the music and the characters just as much as me.
I:245;2148;One of my daughters favorite princesses today and I loved Luttle Mermaid when I was growing up!
I:245;2149;"maybe in the next 7 years I'll have a child that will want to see that movie"")."
I:245;2150;Thank goodness for the secondary market!!
I:245;2151;one of the special features on this disc is the Imagineers version of the ride that never was.
I:245;2152;I'm pretty sure it is the one they are building right now!!
I:245;2153;So it's kind of sweet to imagine that their dreams are being realized finally.
I:245;2154;Well, there's not much to say, the product is wonderful, this is one of my favorite motion pictures ever!And the service is great, I got the package really fast, and there were no problem what so ever!
I:245;2155;my granddaughter loved this .
I:245;2156;this is a great movie
I:245;2157;Good condition and it is still the invaluable proof of how cartoon movies used to show the mastery of real cartoonist and not only computer savvy people's work.
I:245;2158;We played a Little Mermaid game trial on the Disney Website and my daughter loved doing anything that involved Ariel or Sebastian.
I:245;2159;"Of these more recent ""restored"" releases, I have two, this and ""Lady and the Tramp""."
I:245;2160;It is like seeing it for the first time.
I:245;2161;Excellent version of this movie, my wife loves it, great price, great presentation, BTW, this movie it's amazing on 3.
I:245;2162;One of the greatest of all times.
I:245;2163;Great animated movie for the entire family with a great story that you can see over and over.
I:245;2164;This will always and forever be one of my favorite disney animated films.
I:245;2165;"The bonus materials, besides an interesting ""Making of"" documentary, include a short animated gem: ""The Little Matchgirl"", based on the story by Hans Christian Andersen, one of the saddest penned by this rather gloomy spinner of tales, both beautifully and faithfully transcribed to film, in 2006, by Disney's Roger Allers and Don Hahn."
I:245;2166;"It was going to be one episode in a never finished new version of ""Fantasia""
I:245;2167;up transfers with rich colors and excellent sound that makes justice to some of Disney's most successful and charming musical numbers.
I:245;2168;keeping healthcare provider, and finds true love and happiness.
I:245;2169;She asked me to get it for her and I did.
I:245;2170;My granddaughters love this movie and enjoy watching it over ad over.
I:245;2171;The Little Mermaid is such a good movie!!!
I:245;2172;Watching it reminds me of of my childhood and brings back so many memories.
I:245;2173;One for everyone, both young and young at heart.
I:245;2174;very colorful and good story line.
I:245;2175;my favorite characters were sebastian and the seagull
I:245;2176;"It is a nice break from ""sleeping"" princesses!"
I:245;2177;My daughter has red hair and has such a fun time flitting around like she's swimming and sings like an angel.
I:245;2178;She won't receive it till the end of June, because she will be coming to visit at that time, but the packaging looks beautiful.
I:245;2179;I'm sure she's going to love it.
I:245;2180;watching them back to back that while Aladdin was still one of the best, I didnt enjoy the movie as much as this one (although for the TV shows, thats another story).
I:245;2181;It doesnt surprise me that this was my first Disney movie, as I was born the year it came out.
I:245;2182;As I have said before in a couple other reviews, I like just about anything with good mermaids in it, and until my mermaid TV show comes about, this is pretty much the pinnacle of mermaids in popular culture.
I:245;2183;I have to admit, as much as I enjoyed it when I was younger, I enjoy it even more now since I read the original story.
I:245;2184;With all due respect to Walt, thank God they changed the ending!
I:245;2185;like I said before, Beauty and The Beast is my favorite Disney movie, but this is definitely my second favorite now.
I:245;2186;Its as close to perfection as we can get.
I:245;2187;"The animation is great, the songs are awesome (the biggest failing of Aladdin for me was its soundtrack
I:245;2188;Ursula is one of Disneys best villains.
I:245;2189;All the other characters are great, except for Flounder.
I:245;2190;The former provides great musical numbers and the latter always cracks me up.
I:245;2191;But the funniest part of this film will always be the whole Les Poissons scene, which has got to be one of the most hilarious scenes ever.
I:245;2192;I can understand why people dont like it or even prefer the original version of the story, but for me this is always enjoyable.
I:245;2193;take a gulp, take a breath, and go ahead and sign the scroll.
I:245;2194;and i want my grandkids to see it as well
I:245;2195;Easy for me and I always get the correct gift.
I:245;2196;In some scenes it is brown and even black.
I:245;2197;master, super video and audio from the disney studios, it's likewatching the movie again for the very first time.
I:245;2198;highly recommended for your collection .
I:245;2199;always a favorite of mine.
I:245;2200;this is my favorite movie off all time I recommend it to anyone and your never to old to believe and dream
I:245;2201;For a more recent Disney flick, I consider this to be one of the best.
I:245;2202;The characters are well thought out, the story line is great, and the songs original.
I:245;2203;This is a very good movie that your kids will ask to watch over and over, and adult fans of Disney will love as well.
I:245;2204;bought this on black Friday as a gift for my wife.
I:245;2205;she loved this movie as a kid and the blu.
I:245;2206;The lone kneecap's bouncy, under.
I:245;2207;but it works great and my kids love it.
I:245;2208;I enjoyed this movie as a kid and I wanted to offer my children the same experience.
I:245;2209;The story is a classic, and this one has great songs to sing along with boot.
I:245;2210;I will share it with my students, after they read the book.
I:245;2211;my 22 year old daughter's favorite movie as a toddler.
I:245;2212;she rewound her favorite parts so much it broke.
I:245;2213;My granddaughter loves this movie.
I:245;2214;thanks for such a quick delivery!
I:245;2215;Good movie for children's entertainment.
I:245;2216;This is an awesome movie, it has great songs and my husband, daughter and I love it.
I:245;2217;this was a gift for my granddaughter and she absolutely loves it.
I:245;2218;She even took it on the airplane with her to watch
I:245;2219;I was able to pass something I loved from my childhood to my girls.
I:245;2220;And they love Ariel just as much as I did!
I:245;2221;time favorite Disney movie and my favorite movie ever!
I:245;2222;I love the songs, I love the characters, and I love the journey this movie takes me on.
I:245;2223;Work great, was in perfect shape.
I:245;2224;Package was original Disney and free of damage.
I:245;2225;After many years of routine, passionless films, this marked a return to the unabashedly musical and emotional roots of the great Disney animated films of the the past combined now with the modern Broadway musical tradition.
I:245;2226;the story is simple and sweet, underpinned by masterful songs from the great Alan Menken and Howard Ashman.
I:245;2227;"Perhaps the most lasting legacy of ""The Little Mermaid"" is that instead of being films that adults hated, animated films became, once again, entertainment that both adults and kids could enjoy."
I:245;2228;THE LITTLE MERMAID is the first movie I ever remember owning.
I:245;2229;Since then,I've watched a good dozen times, and it still gets me every time.
I:245;2230;I still howl with laughter at the antics of Sebastian and Flounder(he's so cute!)
I:245;2231;The wonderful music and lyrics by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken make me dance around singing.
I:245;2232;It belongs with all the classic Disney films.
I:245;2233;All in all, a wonderful film.
I:245;2234;All in all, it's fine.
I:245;2235;But it's one the many movies my daughter will watch without me.
I:245;2236;This was a Christmas gift for a friend.
I:245;2237;she was delighted with this newest edition.
I:245;2238;The dynamic range of Blu.
I:245;2239;ray brings a clarity and immediacy to this wonderful Disney classic.
I:245;2240;It brought tears to my eyes and I'm a guy!
I:245;2241;ray player has a great sound system to enjoy this fantastic animation!
I:245;2242;Being an adult, not many made for kid movies capture my attention.
I:245;2243;I bought it for my 3 year old who had never seen it.
I:245;2244;I LOVE all things Disney!
I:245;2245;I was three when the movie came out to theaters and it has been part of my life ever since then.
I:245;2246;I find it hard to write a review and find the right words to describe this movie.
I:245;2247;The Little Mermaid sparked something deep down in my soul a long time ago.
I:245;2248;This movie touched so many people over the years and it's still waiting for another generation to do the same.
I:245;2249;Today or Tomorrow, even a hundred years from now this will remain one of Disney's greatest.
I:245;2250;My grandchildren love it just as my children loved it while they were young.
I:245;2251;It's a timeless classic to enjoy
I:245;2252;The music is still amazing after all these years.
I:245;2253;Platinum edition is worth it, if you have children.
I:245;2254;This is my favorite disney movie of all time.
I:245;2255;I have always loved this story, she didn't just blindly accept what she was told.
I:245;2256;My daughter has watched this movie every single day since we got it.
I:245;2257;Duh, it's the Little Mermaid.
I:245;2258;Now my niece is also a fan which makes me happy to pass the tradition on.
I:245;2259;I was so impressed with how fast my movie came.
I:245;2260;It has been a childhood memory for my wife to own this and I was just glad to see her smile on Christmas!
I:245;2261;I had ordered the movie from two other people on here and both times it got canceled.
I:245;2262;Amazon and this place made a dream become possible.
I:245;2263;There was no damage and it looks perfect!
I:245;2264;I'm a 22 year old male, I hadn't watched this movie since I was a kid but I watched it the other night and it brought back so many good memories, I remembered how great Disney movies were back then.
I:245;2265;This was the perfect story with the perfect characters, one of the best films.
I:245;2266;for a lot of us this movie along with numerous others from Disney are real special to us.
I:245;2267;i have added this special edition to my collection of Little Mermaid Films.
I:245;2268;I love this movie .
I:245;2269;it is one of my favorite Disney animated movies.
I:245;2270;This is my niece's favorite movie character .
I:245;2271;It's a Disney classic that everyone should own.
I:245;2272;Great price for a collector's item!!
I:245;2273;I searched for this movie for months and month when I was a child, now I can rest assured that my children will have the two disc edition in the future!
I:245;2274;One of my favorite movies.
I:245;2275;This classic will delight the whole family.
I:245;2276;This has been a favorite movie of mine since my childhood.
I:245;2277;Recently, I decided to watch the movie again, and it still has that same effect on me after all these years.
I:245;2278;She is the youngest daughter of King Triton, and has a fascination for the human world above the sea.
I:245;2279;She collects various antiques with her friend Flounder, and frequently goes above sea level to talk to Skuttle (a seagull who tells her about humans), even though her father forbids her from doing so.
I:245;2280;ron Clements and John Musker, the directors of this movie and also other Disney classics like Aladdin and Hercules, beautifully portray the story of Ariel in `The Little Mermaid'.
I:245;2281;The cast for providing voices to the characters also did a good job.
I:245;2282;disk set, filled with features is compared to this edition.
I:245;2283;this is one of the best movies that Disney has created, and stands on top of the list along with `Beauty and the Beast' and `Aladdin'.
I:245;2284;This is a true masterpiece which can be enjoyed by all ages.
I:245;2285;I rememeber when I was little I absolutely loved this movie, I loved skuttle the most he was a very cute bird, I still do like most of the music in this movie the movie itself though.
I:245;2286;One of my all time Disney favorites.
I:245;2287;as far as Little Mermaid is concerned, I hail it as one of their masterpieces because it is the last Disney cartoon to be fully hand.
I:245;2288;drawn as well as just a great movie unto itself.
I:245;2289;I loved this movie as a little girl and now I get to share it with my girls.
I:245;2290;All the classic Disney animated friends are present, along with the great songs that everyone has come to love.
I:245;2291;The bonus disc is great fun too !
I:245;2292;Every one knows the movie.
I:245;2293;I have loved this movie since I was 2.
I:245;2294;colors looks great, lossless audio is clear and encompassing.
I:245;2295;ray] is a classic Disney that must be in any ones library.
I:245;2296;Got it at a great price.
I:245;2297;This is a lovely little movie for children and adults alike.
I:245;2298;I love the characters and how everything comes together
I:245;2299;and she forever remains her favorite.
I:245;2300;It was in great condition.
I:245;2301;The movie was in perfect shape!
I:245;2302;My daughter absolutely loved it!
I:245;2303;Watches it all the time!
I:245;2304;I identify with her, as I think most young girls do, and I find her attempts at achieving independence from her father familiar.
I:245;2305;Yet another Disney Classic that just is wonderful.
I:245;2306;It is a great movie and I am glad to have it more easily accessible.
I:245;2307;The greater sound and picture clarity make life under the sea more beautiful than ever!I was blown away .
I:245;2308;it's easy to forget you've watching animation at times!A great plot,gorgeous songs and incredible animation(and the fact it$ wholesome)make the blue.
I:245;2309;This is one of my favorite Disney movies.
I:245;2310;They now love it as much as I do.
I:245;2311;"While ""Beauty and the Beast"" may have nominated for BEST Picture, ""The Lion King"" may have captured the world's attention, and ""Aladdin"" may have soared with a Robin Williams."
I:245;2312;"voiced genie, ""The Little Mermaid"" still stands as the landmark film that brought Disney animation to the forefront."
I:245;2313;"day musicals, ""The Little Mermaid"" has it all: a feisty heroine, a faithful mentor/protector, a slightly off."
I:245;2314;"the vocal performances by Jodi Benson (""Ariel""), Kenneth Mars (""King Triton""), Samuel E. Wright (""Sebastian""), Buddy Hackett (""Scuttle"") and Pat Carroll (""Ursula"") are, without a doubt, the best ever heard in a Disney film."
I:245;2315;"the songs (""Under the Sea"", ""Part of Your World"", ""Poor Unfortunate Soul"", ""Kiss the Girl"") are Broadway."
I:245;2316;"It is truly one in need of remastering and ""special edition"" status with extras."
I:245;2317;I received the movie it was in great condition.
I:245;2318;When I bought this I was really hoping my two girls (4 and 6) would enjoy it as much as I did as a kid.
I:245;2319;It's there new favorite movie.
I:245;2320;I absolutely Love the little mermaid!
I:245;2321;I just hope, they make it as spectacular as the Original Release!!!
I:245;2322;This is one of the best disney movies, and the platinum edition is a perfect give for my girls, is remastered, new voices, new songs, etc.
I:245;2323;My daughter was a very happy girl when this came in the mail this week.
I:245;2324;She loves this movie and its very hard to find right now.
I:245;2325;I loved this movie as a child and hoped to pass the enjoyment on to a family member, however the copy of the movie i was sent was unusable.
I:245;2326;This was a requested gift so I knew it would be perfect.
I:245;2327;She can watch it with her baby who will also grow up loving Disney
I:245;2328;This should be an excellent rendition of the classic animated Disney movie!
I:245;2329;I cannot believe how old it looks, but my daughter loves it and she is the real test.
I:245;2330;I watched this 100's of times as a young girl and bought it this year for my 4 year old daughter who is infatuated with Ariel and anything else mermaid.
I:245;2331;When my daughter turned two she absolutely loved watching this movie.
I:245;2332;One of the best disney movies ever.
I:245;2333;My daughter loves this movie!
I:245;2334;This is one of the few animated Disney movies of the late 80's and early 90's that I feel were the best that Disney ever made(I'm not counting the early movies like Snow White or Peter Pan those are beyond time immortal) movies like Aladin, Beauty and The Beast, and The Lion King.
I:245;2335;So if you're like me and want something to renew the love you have of the what made the Disney movies great here's one of the great classic collections to get for home collection library.
I:245;2336;still a good movie despite it's age.
I:245;2337;still a good laugh for kids and adults.
I:245;2338;This movie has been a classic and my daughter loves this movie.
I:245;2339;Another classic that spans generations.
I:245;2340;And I always watched them from the time they first started to the present.
I:245;2341;Now she and I can see it clearly and enjoy it to the fullest.
I:245;2342;This delightful favorite is actually enhanced by the skillful 3.
I:245;2343;It gives a new edge to a very delightful film.
I:245;2344;This was to test to see if I liked it and it was beautiful.
I:245;2345;You'll see things you never noticed, and you'll be amazed at how beautiful the movie is.
I:245;2346;With that said, Amazon delivered it in one day through prime and it was in great condition when it arrived.
I:245;2347;She just loved the movie.
I:245;2348;She has walked around singing the music all the time.
I:245;2349;She even makes faces of the charaters in the moves.
I:245;2350;I bought this for my daughter and her family and the grandchildren are enjoying them very much.
I:245;2351;Exciting and fun for the family to watch.
I:245;2352;I liked it when i was a kid and now my kid loves it.
I:245;2353;When the special edition came out, I grabbed it.
I:245;2354;The history of the story, the animation process, and the cast/crew is wonderful.
I:245;2355;From all the classics from DISNEY, THE LITTLE MERMAID is one of the best!
I:245;2356;The graphics are beautiful, the story is totally interesting.
I:245;2357;Maybe a bit childish, but really cool!
I:245;2358;This was one of my childhood favourites.
I:245;2359;And now, I watch it with my baby girl over and over again.
I:245;2360;One of the Disney's classics that will never dissapear.
I:245;2361;The Little Mermaid, was such a big favorite of me and my sister when we were little.
I:245;2362;Will Ariel's friends be able to stop the wedding?
I:245;2363;For the sake of completeness, though, I enjoy revisiting this film every once and a while.
I:245;2364;I'm also really happy about the triple combo pack.
I:245;2365;I remember the excitement of this film's release.
I:245;2366;"Based on the Hans Christian Anderson classic, ""The Little Mermaid"" brought large audiences back to the type of Disney tradition millions had grown."
I:245;2367;"But Ariel ""the Little Mermaid"" with voice beautifully provided by Jodi Benson, truly is the star of this warmly touching cinematic delight."
I:245;2368;You truly feel for her, and her deep longing to become human.
I:245;2369;But most will be pleased with the extremely happy ending.
I:245;2370;actually, tinkered quite a lot.
I:245;2371;The original fairytale ends with the nameless mermaid's tragic and selfless death: after she sacrifices all in order to be with the man she loves, she gives it all up so that he might live happily with his human love.
I:245;2372;dweller, Disney makes the ending considerably more upbeat, packs it full of catchy songs, and throws in a few animal sidekicks for good measure.
I:245;2373;name, and in many cases I can see their point.
I:245;2374;"but ""The Little Mermaid"" is based on a fairytale, albeit one that was born from one man's head as opposed to the collective minds of human culture."
I:245;2375;But this being the case, the story can get away more easily with changes to the story, without loosing the potency of its core themes and ideas.
I:245;2376;Ariel dreams of the mystery and excitement of the human world, much to the concern of her father King Triton and his valet, the Caribbean crab Sebasation.
I:245;2377;Together with her best friend Flounder, Ariel secretly explores sunken ships, taking her finds to the scatterbrained seagull Scuttle for analysis.
I:245;2378;"the restoration of ""The Little Mermaid"" demonstrates just how beautiful the movie is, and the painstaking work that went into each detail, right down to the last bubble."
I:245;2379;The pacing is perfect (neither too speedy nor dragging along), the characters are bright and lovable, and the story is a classic love/adventure/coming.
I:245;2380;"winning ""Under the Sea"", which will get stuck in your head for days."
I:245;2381;sided view of the dual worlds of sea and land.
I:245;2382;"In her song ""Part of Your World"", Ariel wistfully dreams about land, imagining it to be a paradise where humans ""never reprimand their daughters"" and that everyone is happy and fulfilled in their extraordinary lives on dry land."
I:245;2383;"As well as the movie there are plenty of special features
I:245;2384;themed attraction at Disneyland that was designed but never built, a featurette on Hans Christian Anderson and his original fairytale (well done Disney, always acknowledge your sources!)
I:245;2385;Best of all though is a short.
I:245;2386;It's a lovely treat, especially since 2.
I:245;2387;d animation is so rare these days.
I:245;2388;In fact, I loved it so much that, after watching it, I immediately went online at Amazon.
I:245;2389;com and ordered a 2.
I:245;2390;"I love every single thing about this movie, from the characters(Ariel, especially, 'cause she looks so beautiful and has a wonderful voice, to match), the scenery above and below the sea, the songs, especially ""Part Of Your World"", ""Under The Sea"" and, yes, even ""Poor, Unfortunate Souls"" as well as the making of the film plus the ""Disneypedia: Life Under The Sea"" which talks about the real."
I:245;2391;life animals that inspired the movie characters.
I:245;2392;disc, Platinum Edition copies of Disney animated movies that I own(The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and 101 Dalmatians), The Little Mermaid is my most favorite of all 3 of 'em!
I:245;2393;I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Disney movies, animated movies or a combination of both 'cause it's a treat for the eyes and the ears and will definitely take your breath away 'cause it is WONDERFUL!
I:245;2394;Walt Disney was one of the few undisputed giants of popular culture, along with those amazing Brits Charlie Chaplin and John Lennon.
I:245;2395;and then this film came along and it was so completely wonderful, I remember taking my family to see it and, for the first time since that cursed Star Wars created the endless sequence of end credits, I sat through all the credits to listen to the music again.
I:245;2396;it was immediately obvious that a new genius of the order of Walt Disney had come along, because here was a film that almost stood abreast of his greatest creation Pinocchio, that most completely wonderful movie.
I:245;2397;and this is the best of the lot because, one day during the development of The Little Mermaid, he gave the Disney team a lecture on the nature and structure of great musicals that feature female leads .
I:245;2398;It is such a treasure for those who appreciate the really creative few among us, who just know things.
I:245;2399;the film, like Pinocchio, has a profound moral core yet is a joy to watch.
I:245;2400;It is perfect in its structure without ever being wearisome .
I:245;2401;I know they made a lot of sequels to this film but nothing ranks as goodas the first Movie The Little Mermaid beautiful songs (I just love the song Kiss the Girls),and a lot of the other songs as well.
I:245;2402;Amazon shipped it in perfect condition, great product!
I:245;2403;Another favorite movie for my grandbaby, it was also a favorite movie of my daughter when she was little.
I:245;2404;This movie is excellent all the way around.
I:245;2405;The animation is breathtaking, the music is wonderful and the story line is great.
I:245;2406;Ursela,the sea witch, uses this to her advantage to gain control of the sea.
I:245;2407;Overall, this movie shows that love conquers all.
I:245;2408;A great movie for all ages.
I:245;2409;my kids even will watch this movie with me (:
I:245;2410;This is such a cool movie and brings back memories from when I first saw it 20 years ago!
I:245;2411;Would recommend to anyone who has a child who loves mermaids and musicals!
I:245;2412;it has everything, a story, wonderful characters, music, colors.
I:245;2413;But the original Little Mermaid is simply one of the best animated movies ever made.
I:245;2414;This was for my daughter and she loves it.
I:245;2415;As far as I know, it arrived early and was in great condition.
I:245;2416;an indication of how much she likes Ariel.
I:245;2417;She, and her twin brother, was asking her mother if she could go to bed early (because that meant a bath before bedtime).
I:245;2418;we all love watching this movie.
I:245;2419;law since this is her favorite Disney movie.
I:245;2420;She watched it with her two young sons and they liked it as well!
I:245;2421;Movie worked perfectly and who doesn't love The Little Mermaid?!
I:245;2422;This movie is a great movie to watch with children.
I:245;2423;The interesting woman in the movie .
I:245;2424;that wicked old wet witch .
I:245;2425;is the smart, intelligent, proactive and powerful woman.
I:245;2426;her voice, her talent, her home, her dreams, but alas, it's all worth it.
I:245;2427;This movie is one the three best .
I:245;2428;Beauty and the Beast, and and Aladdin were the others.
I:245;2429;I was so excited the day this came I put it in.
I:245;2430;however, i wanted my boys to see it and they LOVED it and wanted to watch it again.
I:245;2431;The Little Mermaid is arguably one of Disney's alltime greatest achievements.
I:245;2432;The music is amazing and the songs are the most fun Disney has ever brought.
I:245;2433;The animation, ahh, the revived animation is one of The Little Mermaid strongest points.
I:245;2434;The fact that it was painted with hand just makes it more cherished and precious.
I:245;2435;The characters are memorable and Ariel and Sebastian and the rest of the cast are Disney's all.
I:245;2436;The story is famous and beloved and why, it's no wonder the movie turned out to be the most successful one up to 1991's also beautiful Beauty and the Beast.
I:245;2437;The Little Mermaid, their first feature for Disney, is spectacular on every level: it features a wonderful variation on the old fairy tale, and a cast of warmly appealing characters in real predicaments of the heart and soul.
I:245;2438;The animation swirls around you and is magically transporting .
I:245;2439;you will be enveloped in the worlds both beneath and above the sea.
I:245;2440;Ariel and Prince Eric are truly sexy cartoons .
I:245;2441;you will be amazed at how they work their magic spell on you and your family.
I:245;2442;It's clean, crisp, sharp and over all a great film for everyone and this was the Disney film that got everyone back into animation.
I:245;2443;bravo and I now hope we can get a break from changing technology.
I:245;2444;this is a MUST own
I:245;2445;Little Mermaid is still my favorite Disney Princess.
I:245;2446;All of the members of my family love it both male and female ages 3,7,8, and 17.
I:245;2447;It is such a classic that I have four copies one for each child to cherish for years to come.
I:245;2448;It's perhaps unfair to judge Disney's Little Mermaid against Studio Ghibli's Ponyo, especially considering the influence the former had on the latter, but there you have it: The world has moved on, and Ponyo is the better movie not only for its more charming animation style and creative story alterations, but for its change in attitude toward women and girls.
I:245;2449;On the bright side, the music is still fun, and I shocked my kids by singing along to many of the songs (equally shocking myself by remembering the lyrics at all!)
I:245;2450;The voice acting is pleasantly plucky.
I:245;2451;On a technical level it is still a good film, just aged.
I:245;2452;A great movie that my grand.
I:245;2453;My little one Loves this treasured Disney movie.
I:245;2454;It was great for a 4 year old to watch.
I:245;2455;I have waited over 6 years for a decent release of this timeless classic.
I:245;2456;Sweet as pie and twice as great.
I:245;2457;The animation is Disney .
I:245;2458;I got the movie very quickly and it was at a reasonable price.
I:245;2459;The special features are pretty cool, Disney should definitely build the Little Mermaid ride at Disneyland, my girls wanted to watch it over and over again.
I:245;2460;This is probably Disney's greatest musical.
I:245;2461;I think it is one of the best in a long time and does nothing to deteriorate your position
I:245;2462;Bought this for the grandkids.
I:245;2463;I like the music and interesting characters.
I:245;2464;A Disney/Pixar slam dunk as always.
I:245;2465;this movie is the best classic ever!
I:245;2466;its so sweet and loving and fun.
I:245;2467;the music is good too
I:245;2468;I bought it for my 31/2 yr old granddaughters who are absolutely in love with Ariel.
I:245;2469;shipping time was also good.
I:245;2470;This was one of my daughter's favorite Christmas gifts.
I:245;2471;Thank you for great, fast service and exceptional price.
I:245;2472;If you have a little girl in your life between those ages, I highly recommend it.
I:245;2473;came on time for Christmas and was ready to wrap for my 3 year old very happy and surprised granddaughter!!!!
I:245;2474;This is a must to have in your Disney collection.
I:245;2475;This is a classic and my granddaughter wants to collect them all for her future children to enjoy (as well as her renewed enjoyment now)
I:245;2476;I loves it as a child and now my children love it just as much .
I:245;2477;excellent service by the vendor .
I:245;2478;I love this movie, it's fun and engaging.
I:245;2479;Brings back memories when I was a child, enjoying it all over again, they don't make movies like these any more!!!
I:245;2480;This is unquestionably my favorite Disney movie of all time.
I:245;2481;Great music, great story, humor, this movie has it all.
I:245;2482;The deleted scenes are roughly animated, but are delightful.
I:245;2483;And did you know that Disney at one time was developing a Little Mermaid theme park attraction ride?
I:245;2484;It combines animation with live footage of undersea creatures.
I:245;2485;It is especially wonderful for children because it not only entertains, it EDUCATES!
I:245;2486;One of the best Disney movies ever made.
I:245;2487;The Little Mermaid has always been one of my favorite Disney movies.
I:245;2488;So, enjoy the movie, but use it as a time to talk to your kiddos about personal values and morals and what you expect in your family!
I:245;2489;Disney's 28th animated feature brims with the richness of imagination and the magic of an outstanding musical score.
I:245;2490;This Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, though not quite true to the original, is uniquely retold through enchanting Disney animation.
I:245;2491;At a time when animation was dying a slow death, a beautiful mermaid with a soulful voice made her appearance on the silver screen and won the heart of millions.
I:245;2492;Her obsessive yet true love compels her to sell her voice to the sea.
I:245;2493;The backgrounds are lush and vivid and the character sketching blends a traditional style with modern details.
I:245;2494;"Ariel is still the prettiest Disney heroine
I:245;2495;She is Glenn Keane's best creation till date.
I:245;2496;dead gorgeous looks and serious expressions sobered by boyish grins easily make him the most favorite Disney heartthrob (thanks to Mark Henn).
I:245;2497;Andreas Deja, well known for villains like Scar (from The Lion King) and Jafar (from Aladdin), was the supervising animator for Triton and Duncan Marjoribanks does an excellent job of portraying the character of Sebastian.
I:245;2498;the music, which was one of the last collaborative efforts of Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman, is profoundly magnificent.
I:245;2499;winning score is rich in musical and orchestral beauty, `The Jig' and `The Storm' being the most memorable sequences.
I:245;2500;Menken's enchanting and emotional score provides a new dimension to the movie.
I:245;2501;The songs, which vary from the haunting `Part Of Your World' to the Caribbean styled `Kiss The Girl', are wonderfully composed.
I:245;2502;`Under The Sea' is an excellent number which won the Oscar as the best song of 1989.
I:245;2503;the voice talent is very praiseworthy and unlike later animation movies, it does not include a host of celebrities.
I:245;2504;Jodi Benson simply stands out as Ariel and her vocal performances will move you.
I:245;2505;Christopher Daniel Barnes' deep yet boyish voice suits Prince Eric perfect.
I:245;2506;Kenneth Mars and Jason Marin will be well loved in their roles as King Triton and Flounder.
I:245;2507;The best role in the movie is that of Samuel E. Wright, who renders an outstanding performance as the voice of Sebastian.
I:245;2508;all in all, a true classic that offers something for the entire family.
I:245;2509;Filled with crisp fun and entertainment, the movie highlights the value and meaning of true love and sacrifice, conveying its emotional meaning in a marvelous way.
I:245;2510;It truly touches your heart, the sad parts making you cry and the comical parts making you laugh.
I:245;2511;This movie holds a very special place in my heart and I am eagerly waiting for the October 2008 platinum re.
I:245;2512;very good movie my kids love watching it was very hard to find in the stores so that's why i bought it on amazon!!
I:245;2513;all the little extras were a lot of fun to watch as well.
I:245;2514;My three year old loves it.
I:245;2515;I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister.
I:245;2516;It came in great condition.
I:245;2517;I thought it was so good that I got it on VHS the following year.
I:245;2518;it's a tale that's great for young and old alike.
I:245;2519;It's also a movie that everyone has seen, at least in my circle of friends.
I:245;2520;The soundtrack is good, the animation is wonderfully done, and even a guy in the 18.21 range (myself included) can get a good laugh or two out of it.
I:245;2521;Destined to go down next to Snow White and Bambi as a Disney masterpiece, Little Mermaid comes highly recommended for anyone with young children (or anyone who is either young at heart or has a sudden feeling of nostalgia).
I:245;2522;It's a nice set and she loves the movie.
I:245;2523;I had a great experience ordering this product and watching the movie they shipped it actually two days earlier than promised.
I:245;2524;Thank you for having this available.

I:245;2532;My wife loves this movie and for her sake I'll write this review.
I:245;2533;It is her favorite disney movie.
I:245;2534;My daughter liked it and it's good enough for me.
I:245;2535;For those used to the newest cartoons with CGI generated graphics, this one shows its age.
I:245;2536;Nonetheless it is a classic.
I:245;2537;My niece loves the movie.
I:245;2538;I LOVE the Little Mermaid!
I:245;2539;My daughter has been watching the movie since we received it!

I:245;2546;The Little Mermaid is such a cute and classic Disney movie.
I:245;2547;Thank you very much for this movie.
I:245;2548;I was worried about how well this movie will play since it was used but it met all my expectations the movie played excellent had a few scratches but really light scratches, plays great.
I:245;2549;My daughter loves this movie.
I:245;2550;Love item was a very good movie and was a nice gift to give my grandmorther was very happy that it shipped and hope it comes soon.
I:245;2551;It was popular with my daughter so I bought this for my grandchild.
I:245;2552;One of my favorite Walt Disney movies.
I:245;2553;Great songs to sing along to.
I:245;2554;Very friendly to work with.
I:245;2555;I ordered the movie on a Friday and got it 5 days later on a Wednesday.
I:245;2556;Great movie with great music.
I:245;2557;My daughter loves it as much as I do.
I:245;2558;We put it on for baby to watch right away.
I:245;2559;She ALWAYS wanted the Little Mermaid.
I:245;2560;She was so tickled to have it again.
I:245;2561;Her heart lit up like the fourth of July.
I:245;2562;I was so happy to make her happy.
I:245;2563;The story is AWESOME and perfect for kids of all ages.
I:245;2564;The movie came in wonderful condition and FAST!
I:245;2565;Fair price and is enjoyed daily by my daughter.
I:245;2566;It's Disney and very few of them are bummers.
I:245;2567;This is a fun movie for family movie night.
I:245;2568;The colors were vibrant and and the picture was very clean.
I:245;2569;The Little Mermaid is my favourite Disney movie ever.
I:245;2570;It's full of adventure, music and comedy.
I:245;2571;well good luck and a cool movie
I:245;2572;It plays well and it's a good movie to watch with friends and family.
I:245;2573;My reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I would have liked more features.
I:245;2574;My wife loved the gift, though!
I:245;2575;She is a big Little Mermaid fan.
I:245;2576;She stated the colors were better than in the original.
I:245;2577;I liked the extra features and the deleted scenes that shed more light on Ursula's background.
I:245;2578;Love all the Disney movies and I wanted this one on Blue.
I:245;2579;rayMy granddaughter will love it.
I:245;2580;Needed to replace the movie for my college age daughter because she loved it so as a child!
I:245;2581;and indeed, you will enjoy all of the Princess classics as thoroughly as your young one.
I:245;2582;came in perfect condition, its a great movie and the kids love it so its a win win for all
I:245;2583;My daughter loved this as a child so I bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it too.
I:245;2584;Great animation and great music.
I:245;2585;Came on time to give to my grand daughter for Christmas.
I:245;2586;She watched it that day.
I:245;2587;Female love based on a man this fish girl never met.
I:245;2588;Save your daughters, and watch something to stimulate her mind and independence.
I:245;2589;Knew all the songs and still do.
I:245;2590;I'm sure I will know them all my life.
I:245;2591;"I do have a soft spot for ""Dumbo"" and ""Robin Hood,"" but in my lifetime this is the best Disney movie ever made."
I:245;2592;And since Disney isn't making any more animated movies this may well be the last good Disney movie ever.
I:245;2593;The Little Mermaid is so beautiful in blu.
I:245;2594;ray, its as vivid and great as I remembered as a child.
I:245;2595;The music is infectious, and really is on the pantheon of Disney classics that is a must own for anyone with kids.
I:245;2596;I have loved this movie since it first came out when my daughter was just a little fry.
I:245;2597;Now, 20 years later, I can share it with my little boy!
I:245;2598;It has wonderful songs, adorable characters and great colors!
I:245;2599;My 4 year old thought it was hilarious and had a great laugh!
I:245;2600;This is my all time favorite movie!
I:245;2601;KUDOS for Little Mermaid!Wonderful song selections, colorful, funny and good enoughfor kids from 1 to 92!
I:245;2602;this has always been my faVE fairytale!
I:245;2603;another outstanding of the meaning of true love conquers all!
I:245;2604;Will I be able to play it in a UK Blu.
I:245;2605;My youngest daughter loves this movie.
I:245;2606;Our girls love this movie and cannot wait to watch.
I:245;2607;Purchasing this was very well worth the money.
I:245;2608;My 6 year old daughter has loved this movie since she was just a couple years old.
I:245;2609;I have all three versions and i love them all!
I:245;2610;I remember watching this movie many, many years ago.
I:245;2611;I loved it, and bought it for my two year old daughter in the hopes she would love it too.
I:245;2612;The story is fun and somewhat easy for her to follow.
I:245;2613;The concept of a mermaid princess is interesting to her, since the other princesses she adores are land lubbers.
I:245;2614;Ariel is intrigued by what goes on above water, and longs to be human.
I:245;2615;This movie is filled with great scenes, great characters, and great music!
I:245;2616;It's a wonderful animated film and is suitable for all ages.
I:245;2617;While no longer a child, my daughter is a child at heart and she requested this movie as it is one of her favorites.
I:245;2618;We are very happy with it!
I:245;2619;This is my favorite Disney movie from childhood.
I:245;2620;I love watching it now and feel the same love that I did for this movie when I was little.
I:245;2621;I found it hard to tell from the product description.
I:245;2622;I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she has made it her new favorite movie!
I:245;2623;The movie was in perfect condition and we watch it several times a week!
I:245;2624;Loved the Movie as a child and love sharing the movie with my children.
I:245;2625;Kiddo loves Ariel and she was very excited to open the present and see this.
I:245;2626;The picture is great, sound is great, great kids movie
I:245;2627;Within twenty minutes, I was feeling happy, caught in the spell of a strong story, gorgeous animation, and lively Oscar.
I:245;2628;The magic of Disney for kids of all ages permeates this story of Ariel, the likeable mermaid who falls in love with a human.
I:245;2629;If she can go without her lovely voice for three days and still get the handsome prince to kiss her, she is a human for life.
I:245;2630;The catch is that she can never again see her aquatic friends, like her king father and Sebastian the hilarious crab comic relief who almost gets eaten!
I:245;2631;She has stolen Ariel's lilting voice.
I:245;2632;"Alan Menken and Howard Ashman collaborated on the songs
I:245;2633;If you are a child at heart, like me, you will treasure it.
I:245;2634;And Disney Studios has restored the heck out of it.
I:245;2635;the colors are gorgeous, the image clarity is flawless, and the remastered soundtrack does justice to the music.
I:245;2636;The 83 minute movie is on disk one, at its correct 1.78 moderate wide.
I:245;2637;There is also a feature that lets you go to a particular song, a popular feature on a movie with these songs and an Oscar.
I:245;2638;disk two is mammoth, a good three hours.
I:245;2639;There is another 45 minutes that goes behind the scenes at Disney Studios in 1989 at a time of great business upheaval to create the mood that this happy and romantic film was made under.
I:245;2640;THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL is a lovely and sad animated short adaptation of another Andersen story, an exquisite bonus.
I:245;2641;I thought it was entertaining then, watching through the eyes of a five year old now is a hundred times better.
I:245;2642;Just a great, creative, Disney movie.
I:245;2643;And she falls in love with him, and she saves his life when a strom hits, and brings him to land.
I:245;2644;This movie is pretty good.
I:245;2645;Like most Disney movies, this one has humor and story for both young and old!
I:245;2646;Gonna make a perfect stocking stuffer this Christmas for an unsuspecting girl!
I:245;2647;Another great Disney movie to share with the next generation!
I:245;2648;it lived up to my expectations and memory.
I:245;2649;Colors are vivid, story is terrific.
I:245;2650;There is a new favorite princess in our house for sure!
I:245;2651;Was fun to watch too having just been on the new Little Mermaid ride at Disney World : )
I:245;2652;I absolutely loved it and was actually more excited to watch it again than I was to watch it the first time.
I:245;2653;This movie will always be a classic and always be a favorite in my household.
I:245;2654;The music is good, the storyline is one of the best and the epic friendship between a mermaid, flounder and a crab will always be a memorable one.
I:245;2655;I thought this was a really whimsical movie.
I:245;2656;The music was up lifting and fun .
I:245;2657;I think kids of all ages will love this.
I:245;2658;This 2 disc set has sooo many cool special features!
I:245;2659;I love the ride that almost was, and the deledted scenes on the second disc!
I:245;2660;"I love the ""Kiss the girl"" music video by Ashley Tisdale on the first disc!"
I:245;2661;I forgot how much I really like this movie until I got it and watched it.
I:245;2662;So I am now the proud owner of the Little Mermaid and am a happy camper.
I:245;2663;Yes, it will no doubt be going home with them when they go!
I:245;2664;I have loved this movie from the first time I've watched it.
I:245;2665;It's by far my favorite Disney movie.
I:245;2666;My kids and watch it together all the time.
I:245;2667;Everything about the movie is perfect.
I:245;2668;eyed, earnest and genuine, but she doesn't wait for things to happen to her, she's proactive.
I:245;2669;She's also got a great supporting cast in Sebastian, Flounder, the kooky Scuttle, and a formidable villain in Ursulla.
I:245;2670;Disney really had something special in Alan Menken and Howard Ashman.
I:245;2671;The melodies are great and catchy, the lyrics are effortless, have great deal of wit to them and they advance the story quite well.
I:245;2672;"The movie has been fully restored and looks great, there's a good deal of bonus features including deleted scenes, a wonderful ""making of"" documentary, the truth behind the story, a great short video ""the little match girl"" which will probably bring tears to your eyes, and much more."
I:245;2673;do yourself a favor and get this wonderful movie, which single.
I:245;2674;handedly saved Disney Animation, brought back the animated musical and started the 2nd Disney renaissance of the late 80's to the late 90's.
I:245;2675;It has been played and enjoyed over and over again!
I:245;2676;I received this in perfect working order.
I:245;2677;My kids love watching this movie!
I:245;2678;The kids enjoyed this version a lot more (would've been the one that came out in the late 90's, I think).
I:245;2679;One of the BEST movies ever, Everything about this movie is beautiful and heart warming.
I:245;2680;"She now calls herself ""Princess Ariel"" and her Daddy is Prince Eric."
I:245;2681;Oh, and I always have to be Ursula!
I:245;2682;It is just good entertainment for little ones and the music is fun!
I:245;2683;This is just the most adorable movie ever and I am so happy to have it on blue.
I:245;2684;ray and I like that I got a digital copy as well.
I:245;2685;i don't have much to add, but if you've got a little one, especially the girls, this is a classic and worth letting them watch it several times over and again until they know the lines and the lyrics by heart.
I:245;2686;Very nice experience all the way around.
I:245;2687;My family and I loved the product and movie.
I:245;2688;Flounder and Sabastian are adorable.
I:245;2689;Disney does a great job of getting memorable voices with the characters.
I:245;2690;I didn't return it however because it is my daughter's favorite movie right now and I can't find it anywhere else.
I:245;2691;This movie is great for kids or adults.
I:245;2692;The color is great, the story good, and the music wonderful!
I:245;2693;I would recommend it for children of every age.
I:245;2694;My three year old LOVES this movie and can watch it over and over again.
I:245;2695;Ariel is her favorite princess character.
I:245;2696;Movie arrived in beautiful condition.
I:245;2697;Movie was just as amazing when I was a little girl.
I:245;2698;Took a couple of weeks to receive.
I:245;2699;it came in mint condition and in a very timely manner!
I:245;2700;Bought this to replace our obsolete VHS tape, the disc works just fine , happy to have it, it's a classic lol
I:245;2701;Had to get a new one to replace the other one that the granddaughters had worn out, they love it.
I:245;2702;Can't beat a Disney movie!
I:245;2703;This is a very sweet story line.
I:245;2704;My boys liked it when they were small so it isn't just for girls.
I:245;2705;The music in this movie is fantastic.
I:245;2706;This is a very enjoyble video with lovely music.
I:245;2707;My granddaughter loves this movie.
I:245;2708;Plenty of humor and some scary scenes.
I:245;2709;delivered as promised and in excellent new condition.
I:245;2710;Granddaughter love it and have enjoyed watching it over and over.
I:245;2711;Great entertainment value for all to watch together.
I:245;2712;It was great to watch with now grown children and know my new grand daughter will love it too as she grows up!
I:245;2713;I was born in 1987, making me two years old when Disney released The Little Mermaid.
I:245;2714;well, I still love The Little Mermaid.
I:245;2715;In my opinion it is one of the five best.
I:245;2716;The characters are fun, fresh and wholesome, the songs are great and the story is meaningful.
I:245;2717;to me, Ariel's intense desire to see the world and live as a human is fabulously displayed in Part of that World , a song, which will always hold a place in my heart.
I:245;2718;Her passion and longing is so real, to me it is half the movie.
I:245;2719;It's emotional, evocative and memorable.
I:245;2720;Every little girl should see The Little Mermaid.
I:245;2721;I love this movie and that's all that matters.
I:245;2722;I was impressed with the transfer and the dolby digital sound.
I:245;2723;Wife likes the movie arrived quick and as described.
I:245;2724;I understood why it was so good.
I:245;2725;I've always loved Disney movies and this is my number one movie that I love.
I:245;2726;Its a classic story that everyone lovea to tell about, and that is about mermaid.
I:245;2727;A mermaid in love with a human and wanting to be a part of his world, and the sacrifices she has to make to get the love of her life.
I:245;2728;Its both heart warming and does truly touch you.
I:245;2729;They've presented it in a way that truly is heart warming and worth watching.
I:245;2730;"The princess in this film ""Ariel"" is truly one of the most unique princesses that we've seen and is truly special."
I:245;2731;one of the best things about this movie is the songs.
I:245;2732;"Howard Ashman truly put all his heart in producing the music in this movie and it has some of the most memorable music that can never be forgotten like the music ""Part of your world"" which is truly is beautiful, and for some people it can relate to others in human life, another like ""kiss the girl"" is also a favorite."
I:245;2733;But the movie is also about a father and daughter relationship as well.
I:245;2734;"It is a movie that made me realize how special daughters can be, and when they get married, how much love and pain it takes to give your daughter away
I:245;2735;With todays animation, it feels outdated and you can't blame them because it was made in the late 80's, but the Disney crew has done a great job at restoring the film's color.
I:245;2736;But for me it is still something I love to watch with my daughter and she loves it as well because Ariel has also been shown as someone who seeks her dream, and wants to dream as well.
I:245;2737;the story is greatly told and I don't think there would be anyone out there who would have told it better than this.
I:245;2738;It is a classic that must never be forgotten, and a must have item for a fan of Disney, and its great classics.
I:245;2739;Its a great family movie and a must have item.
I:245;2740;My kids love this movie, they get scared of the witch, but hey who isent.
I:245;2741;Ordered this for my partner who loves the character.
I:245;2742;Awesome to be able to find since it has been out of print for a few years
I:245;2743;I ordered it from this seller it came brand new as advertised and in a timely manner.
I:245;2744;release date, may I add.)
I:245;2745;Well today, two years earlier than originally planned, the Platinum Edition of The Little Mermaid is FINALLY available, and it's been well worth the wait.
I:245;2746;It's never looked this gorgeous or amazing on video.
I:245;2747;It's never SOUNDED this good either.
I:245;2748;The sound mix is amazing.
I:245;2749;And instead of games, Disney includes a VERY special bonus in the Games and Activities section .
I:245;2750;With CGI animation, the ride that almost was is brought to life.
I:245;2751;There are two ways to explore it.
I:245;2752;You can explore it as a ride, with audio commentary.
I:245;2753;I'm absolutely impressed with this bonus feature, and it's one that merits repeat viewing.
I:245;2754;The Deleted Scenes section is absolutely awesome, and definitely something fun to watch.
I:245;2755;backstage Disney is always the best part of a 2.
I:245;2756;They even acknowledge that they made The Black Cauldron in this one, which to me is absolutely shocking.
I:245;2757;This short is more melancholy than Disney's treatment of The Little Mermaid, but VERY faithful to the story, right down to keeping the bittersweet ending of the original tale intact.
I:245;2758;Bought it for a gift.
I:245;2759;It came super fast and just as described.
I:245;2760;It was still in the new wrapper and my granddaughter will be so excited.
I:245;2761;My daughter absolulty loves this movie.
I:245;2762;It is so nice that my favorite childhood movie is out there for my child to enjoy!
I:245;2763;It shipped quicker than expected and was packed great.
I:245;2764;This is one of Disney's greatest movies!
I:245;2765;I love this one as do my kids and grandkids!This arrived on time.
I:245;2766;What can I say?Personally this to me is still the best disney animated feature ever!Amazing songs, animation, story.
I:245;2767;songs are some of my favorites in all of Disney.
I:245;2768;"renaissance jolt that science fiction did when they first saw the rollup in ""Star Wars."""
I:245;2769;"The delight continued through the film, which had the best original songs since ""Dumbo"" and ushered in a new style for Disney in which the songs weren't just animated, they moved the story forward Broadway."
I:245;2770;"IMO, ""The Little Mermaid"" remains the best, because those working on the project could not realize beforehand what they had accomplished, and so weren't overdoing their efforts to be entertaining (coincidentally, also like ""Dumbo"")."
I:245;2771;"I can't recall another film that has garnered THREE Best Song nominations, and again IMO, ""Part of Your World"" should have won."
I:245;2772;which in the final analysis IS a happy ending.
I:245;2773;The movie is in great condition.
I:245;2774;The movie case is fine!
I:245;2775;This was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid, and I was not disappointed when I bought it a few weeks ago.
I:245;2776;My daughter loves it as much as I did wen I was a little girl!
I:245;2777;A true Disney love story.
I:245;2778;Add in a villian, and some funny side characters and you've got The Little Mermaid .
I:245;2779;bone for why I watch and love Disney Films.
I:245;2780;and its still awesome after all these years!
I:245;2781;year old is very much into princesses right now and she loves this movie just as much as I did as a child.
I:245;2782;The colors were fantastic, but its the volume of the songs.
I:245;2783;The movie works perfectly, however one flaw on the disk there are certain words that are actually misspelled on it.
I:245;2784;I was 5 and I could see it.
I:245;2785;but it still has that certain something.
I:245;2786;It is an amazing presentaion of the film.
I:245;2787;crisp clear picture, Dolby Digital sound, enough to bring the experience, and help me relive that same feeling I had when I was 9 (wow.
I:245;2788;It single handedly led Disney into a new golden age!
I:245;2789;It's a classic, and a masterpiece, and to me, the greatest movie ever!
I:245;2790;Love, love, LOVE The Little Mermaid so of course I jumped at the chance to review The Little Mermaid Diamond Edition!
I:245;2791;The Little Mermaid holds a special place in my heart for two reasons.
I:245;2792;"Her lunchbox, backpack, clothing, jewelry, toys
I:245;2793;The first ride we always go on at California Adventure .
I:245;2794;When we went and saw Second Screen Live to test out the App she knew all the songs and trivia.
I:245;2795;She loved the new music video and could watch it all day.
I:245;2796;this is actually my third version of The Little Mermaid because Paige keeps watching them to the point of destruction!
I:245;2797;ray so it makes the experience even more magical (if possible).
I:245;2798;The sea is replete with marvelous treasures and bounteously provides Ariel with all of her material needs.
I:245;2799;This need for transcendence is not prompted by any rational instinct, but the common passion to break through the mundane into a brave new world of the extraordinary.
I:245;2800;Even without a voice, Ariel is able to communicate with Eric the prince through her innate kindness and sympathy.
I:245;2801;This film is a marvelous testament to the power of human warmth against the alienation, fragmentation and silence of modern times.
I:245;2802;A little girl's gotta have her Mermaid Movie!
I:245;2803;I received it quickly, in great condition for an excellent price.
I:245;2804;One of my favorite Disney movies of all time!!
I:245;2805;This is my favorite movie.
I:245;2806;The Little Mermaid is my favorite Disney animated movie ever.
I:245;2807;The biggest of all, for me, are the steps.
I:245;2808;I know it probably saved Disney a lot of $$$ while they were making the film, but I would've loved it if they had been reanimated for the remastered edition.
I:245;2809;I grew up on fairy tales, and though they were written versions and not Disney productions, I loved them and still grew to be a very independent, strong woman.
I:245;2810;My granddaughter is very bright.
I:245;2811;This is a TRUE CLASSIC that has been beautifully remastered.
I:245;2812;The animations and colors are stunning.
I:245;2813;The animation is true to what you'd expect from a Disney movie.
I:245;2814;A classic from my youth that is perfect for my 3 year old daughter.
I:245;2815;She loves the characters and songs.
I:245;2816;One of the best Disney movies of all time!
I:245;2817;My nephews loved it, stands the test of time.
I:245;2818;I enjoyed The Little Mermaid and it brought back a lot of childhood memories.
I:245;2819;The songs are fun and amazing and this movie will have you out your seat the whole time.
I:245;2820;I just loved the little mermaid when I was a little girl and I decided I wanted to have this as well as the other Disney movies I grew up watching.
I:245;2821;The little mermaid is my favorite Disney movie ever.
I:245;2822;Was also very shocked with the turn around time that my shipment arrived at my house.
I:245;2823;I will definitely order from amazon again.
I:245;2824;But I love Ariel's beautiful body, Scuttle's stupidity, Sebastian's crankiness, and the good use of conflicts.
I:245;2825;"The Little Mermaid inherited those computer effects from ""The Great Mouse Detective"", my personal favorite classic."
I:245;2826;his movie brings back memories of when I was growing up.
I:245;2827;This movie is definitely ranked #1.
I:245;2828;Great movie to have on Blu.
I:245;2829;The digital copy makes it easy to play from your laptop or even phone.
I:245;2830;The extras are nice as well.
I:245;2831;I just found out that I'm going to have a baby girl, so I'm so excited to be able to share this movie with her and raise a Disney fan.
I:245;2832;The songs in this movie are amazing and you'll find yourself humming them when the movie isn't even on.
I:245;2833;this is a must own if you are a Disney fan.
I:245;2834;It's not just because it's the Little Mermaid, but it is a very well.
I:245;2835;My daughter called and my granddaughter loves her new movie.
I:245;2836;The extra bonus interview behind the scenes help me know more about the production of the cartoon.
I:245;2837;And the bonus cartoon is also touching.
I:245;2838;Wonderful movie, in excellent new condition.
I:245;2839;I'm very happy with my order and with the seller.
I:245;2840;com and I got it for a pretty cheap price.
I:245;2841;I love this movie and it has a French, Spanish, and English language track.
I:245;2842;Well worth the 15 bucks to own it!
I:245;2843;I don't like that it took so many years for it to be available again but my kids love it now.
I:245;2844;This Disney cartoon is one of the best modern Dsney feature cartoons released for many years.
I:245;2845;It is a delight to watch from start to finish.
I:245;2846;The songs are a joy to see performed and the plot is excellant.
I:245;2847;Childern will love this and adults will be glad they watched it too.
I:245;2848;Have loved this movie since my older kids were born.
I:245;2849;I'm now enjoying it with the my granddaughter.
I:245;2850;This will never stop being a great movie!
I:245;2851;There was screaming when this gift was opened for Christmas .
I:245;2852;I bought this used and it is like brand new!
I:245;2853;I'm so excited to give it to my daughter on Christmas.
I:245;2854;She is going to love it!
I:245;2855;Love watching this wonderful love story.
I:245;2856;I remember this movie from a long time ago.
I:245;2857;This is the best Disney movie there will ever be and you can't change my mind and no one can or could.
I:245;2858;She fall's in love with a human and when her father hears about this, he can't believe it.
I:245;2859;There is something for everyone in this major film about the life and wonderings of the teenage mermaid Ariel.
I:245;2860;I have always been a a huge Little Mermaid fan.
I:245;2861;So happy The Little Mermaid has been rereleased!
I:245;2862;This has been a favorite since it's original release when I was in high school.
I:245;2863;My kids (ages 5 and 13) both love it, too!
I:245;2864;I have always loved this animated film as a child and now my child loves it.
I:245;2865;I love the movie, and this set has it all.
I:245;2866;The music is great and now on my ipod and computer.
I:245;2867;Nice also to have the regular copy to play in the mini van on long trips.
I:245;2868;Great set to get this movie in every format, and the music is wonderful.
I:245;2869;I love Disney movies and this one is one of my favourites.
I:245;2870;The Little Mermaid is truly a very sweet and charming tale of a girl who wanted more.
I:245;2871;The songs in this movie are spectacular and they were stuck in my head for a week.
I:245;2872;Watch this movie and you'll fall in love with it!Beautiful story!
I:245;2873;I highly recommend, a true Disney classic by all standards!
I:245;2874;Still my all time favorite Disney movie.
I:245;2875;She's been very into mermaids for the last 2 years.
I:245;2876;She just adores this movie and sings all the songs, has many mermaid and Ariel dolls, a mermaid swimuit, and clothes.
I:245;2877;She loves the pre and sequals as well.
I:245;2878;I loved this movie as a girl, and it's one of the few movies that she watches repeatedly that doesn't drive me nuts the 3rd time around.
I:245;2879;Good visuals, good story, good princess, but the reason we are all hear, is the songs!
I:245;2880;One of the modern Disney classics and it looks beautiful on blu.
I:245;2881;Most of my moive collection is for older kids and adults, with one grand child and 2 more on the way my wife and I decided we need to expand the collection so they would have something to watch when they came over.
I:245;2882;Besides that I liked this move and several others I bought some Disney some not but all good for the little ones.
I:245;2883;my daughter love this movie i grow up watching and im glad to share this movie with my daughter very happy
I:245;2884;Everybody knows that The Little Mermaid is classic Disney, so I'll skip the movie review for now.
I:245;2885;I just want to say that the BLU RAY transfer is really gorgeous and comparable to some of the best Disney BDs I own, such as Beauty and the Beast and Alice in Wonderland (1951).
I:245;2886;Soft where it should be and very sharp when it should be too.
I:245;2887;as for Audio, it is flawless as well.
I:245;2888;It probably won't show off your system like a super hero movie, but it does sound really, really, really good.
I:245;2889;Mostly depth and atmospheric effects, not a lot of pop.
I:245;2890;I love this movie, and I'm so happy it was available on here.
I:245;2891;The Little Mermaid is the best animated film ever made, which makes it Disney's best and one of the world's favourite movies.
I:245;2892;on and the story is cute, adorable and lovely.
I:245;2893;I have loved this film for years and I never will stop loving it.
I:245;2894;ariel is a fantastic human.
I:245;2895;i love this adorable film so much!
I:245;2896;I hope you liked my review.
I:245;2897;Expected to receive it in 14 days.
I:245;2898;The disc is perfect and I am delighted.
I:245;2899;Its a magical, beautiful film that you can watch over and over.
I:245;2900;A gift for my Grand daughter and she loved it!
I:245;2901;She is becoming an Auntie today and am sure she will have fun watching it with her niece, when she niece is old enough.
I:245;2902;Me and my baby sister watch it everyday!
I:245;2903;One disc keeps falling out.
I:245;2904;The little mermaid was one of my favorite movies to watch as a kid.
I:245;2905;As and adult I still find it to be a fun movie to watch.
I:245;2906;so now I own this movie in almost every format available!
I:245;2907;The colors, characters and music are all well delivered.
I:245;2908;This was my favorite movie as a little girl and now my niece is obsessed with it.
I:245;2909;amazing price for the age of the movie.
I:245;2910;When I finally got it the printing on the cover looks funny and for some reason the case doesn't fit in its sleeve.
I:245;2911;Where are peoples integrity now a days.
I:245;2912;If you are going to sell something then make sure at least you are selling a usable product.
I:245;2913;she loves it, and that pleases me.
I:245;2914;I love this classic animated story.
I:245;2915;glad I found it here.
I:245;2916;even the edges on the case is perfect.
I:245;2917;All the music,fun and excitment under the sea returns in this special edition of one of Disney's most beloved film.
I:245;2918;loving and mishievous mermaid,is enchanted with all things human.
I:245;2919;since Ariel is so determined to be human,she makes a deal with the sinister seawitch,Ursula,and trades her lovely voice and mermaid fins for legs.
I:245;2920;A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE!
I:245;2921;One of the best Disney movies.
I:245;2922;life teenaged mermaid wants to experience love and the other world.
I:245;2923;It's Disney with a touch of real life teenager.
I:245;2924;I just love the movie.
I:245;2925;My grand kids just love it
I:245;2926;It is truly amazing at times, it even has a few times where something sticks out of the screen and the depth is always wonderful.
I:245;2927;The effects are far better then those of the Lion King or Beauty and the Beast.
I:245;2928;Without a doubt this is the best the Little Mermaid has ever looked or sounded.
I:245;2929;While I like the movie a whole lot, I do question the story at times.
I:245;2930;It is always perfect when the adults can enjoy the movie as much as the children.
I:245;2931;My granddaughter had been to Disney for the first time this summer and she loved watching The Little Mermaid.
I:245;2932;She knew all the names of the characters and she loved seeing the swimming.
I:245;2933;This was her first summer to swing a lot herself and she really likes swimming and related a lot to the show.
I:245;2934;Great for children, my granddaughter is 4 year old.
I:245;2935;so this is a great improvement.
I:245;2936;This is a great classic movie.
I:245;2937;She loves the Disney princesses.
I:245;2938;Predictable, as most Disney romances are.
I:245;2939;But, the video is extremely well done.
I:245;2940;and I love it too!It arrived on time in perfect condition.
I:245;2941;And it was extremely enchanting, still.
I:245;2942;I love this movie: the music, story, and characters.
I:245;2943;ANoneyand even accomplishes it when she sees Eric, the handsome land prince.
I:245;2944;the movie is delightful for all ages.
I:245;2945;Girls will love the romance and Ariel.
I:245;2946;Boys will love the action.
I:245;2947;She was so excited and still asks to watch it every day.
I:245;2948;A GREAT choice for BOYS and GIRLS!
I:245;2949;The tape worked perfectly, and it met up yo my expectations.
I:245;2950;But other than that, great!
I:245;2951;While all the other relatives bought clothes and stuff I got her this.
I:245;2952;The movie is in perfect condition and my daughter Wilder loves it!
I:245;2953;The delivery was spot on and everything was great.
I:245;2954;Every happy and amazing childhood memory is back.
I:245;2955;Google play is what I used worked great and is on the cloud for the family to enjoy
I:245;2956;I think this is by far the best of the modern Disney animated movies.
I:245;2957;The animation is a bit dated, but the music and story line are excellent.
I:245;2958;I got the Little Mermaid for my niece for Christmas because it was one of my favorite movies as a child.
I:245;2959;Now my 2 year old daughter can enjoy this movie since Disney has it locked up in their imaginary vault until God knows when.
I:245;2960;it was priced below other options and i was very pleased.
I:245;2961;This is the best ever Disney movie.
I:245;2962;the music is fantastic with a beautiful and simple story that has been redone for kids.
I:245;2963;The Little Mermaid is without a doubt a timeless classic.
I:245;2964;In my opinion it's the best modern Disney work since Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty.
I:245;2965;"Plus unforgettable songs like ""Under the Sea"", ""Kiss the Girl"", and my favorite ""Part of Your World""."
I:245;2966;They look new packaged and sealed.
I:245;2967;I brought the movie as a gift for a friend of mine who love this movie as a child.
I:245;2968;I've loved it that much.
I:245;2969;How wonderful the music is!
I:245;2970;It is the very moment for switching to the other layer.
I:245;2971;As a prime member, this was ideal.
I:245;2972;i was pleased with the quick delivery.
I:245;2973;She loves this movie and is adding it to her collection
I:245;2974;This is a wonderful transfer of this classic film .
I:245;2975;we hope this provides you with the information you require.
