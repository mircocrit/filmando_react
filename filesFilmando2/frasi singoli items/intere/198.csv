1;"This is a tale of a young chinese girl who steals her father's ""call to arms"", cuts her hair and disguises herself as a boy so that she can join the war instead of her father."
2;Mushu is the highlight of the movie!
3;Though the lines are not quite as funny as what you'd expect them to be for Eddie Murphy, he is the best part of the show.
4;It is worth seeing once .
5;the music, characters, scenes, situations and troubles they all get into, keep you glued to the tube.
6;The music is so beautiful.
7;A great film to be watched many times by every member of the family.
8;The Huns are attacking China, and the wise and good Emperor has requested that one man from each household join his army to protect the land.
9;Fa Mulan's father, very conscious of the honor it is to serve the Emperor, accepts this command, even though he is severely crippled.
10;Joined by the cute Cri.
11;the Chinese theme of Mulan is played very strongly in the art, which is reminiscent of Chinese watercolors.
12;The movie, though very stylized, has the feeling of the classic Disney films.
13;The audience can really sympathize with them, and cheer for them, and cry for them.
14;The musical numbers are all well done and entertaining, and the score is wonderfully written.
15;Some moments are played over the top, comedy wise, and in general this does not help the movie.
16;Overall Impression: No question about it, this is one Disney film that is worth owning.
17;The few bad points are far outweighed by the good, and it is, as I have stated, a very entertaining movie.
18;There are some tense battle images in this film.
19;On the flipside, Mulan is a good role model in that she sacrifices her own desires to keep another person safe.
20;What a good message for the leaders of tomorrow!
21;strong young girl who joins the Imperial Army in place of her father.
22;"rate material fit for a Christopher Guest ""spoof."
23;"And for good measure, Disney had to make sure to throw in plenty of inappropriate sexual/body function/bathroom humor for a family"" film that still somehow garnered a ""G"" rating."
24;Lots of yucks are provided for example, in a story.
25;"out gags/inappropriate content in other ""family"" movies like Shrek, and later Disney films, Lilo and Stitch and Home on the Range."
26;western story and characters, the film quite remarkably had the opposite effect.
27;"Oh well, I guess if you're Disney, ""all those asians look alike"" anyway.)"
28;grubbing CEO's like Michael Eisner, who's only concern is maximizing profits, this is the best you can hope for.
29;the pet project of Walt Disney's own son, Roy Disney, who incidentally was pivotal in trying to wrest the control of Disney from Eisner.
30;like I said, the animation is good stuff.
31;"Watch it and be moderately entertained for an hour
32;Mulan is a great example to little girls as to working hard for something and always putting family first and helping when help is needed.
33;I must say it's a very good movie with a meaningful story line.
34;Yet, she still enjoys all the animals and songs.
35;it may not be a movie designed for younger kids, it's surely a great movie for everyone else!!
36;This is such a great movie, my 3 year old watches it everyday and I can also sit there and watch it over and over.
37;Mulan is funny, dramatic and great, and I rank it among the best Disney movies in recent history.
38;t`s music also brings a lot of entertainment, being in English or Spanish.
39;Definitely you should watch it with your family.
40;After the successes of The Little Mermaid, Beauty And The Beast, and Aladdin, I had thought that the Disney feature.
41;I had overlooked this nice movie for a while, and really enjoyed it with our family.
42;Of course, the gem of this movie is Eddie Murphy's Mushu, and I must admit, he had us all laughing.
43;Mulan was a really good movie.
44;The songs were really good, my favorites were Reflection, True to Your Heart and Be a Man.
45;This a really good movie.
46;Mulan is a Disney classic, great for the whole family and still a fun watch when you're an adult.
47;It's cheesy and corny and everything you'd expect from a kids movie, but still a great time.
48;If you haven't seen it yet this is definitely one to add to your list.
49;I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it in elementary school.
50;It's a great story of overcoming adversity to protect those you love and make something of yourself.
51;That being said, the download was very fast and, as mentioned before, it's a great movie.
52;Awesome movie as expected from Disney.
53;Great soundtrack, I even downloaded some of the songs to my ipod.
54;Deep movie meaningful and thought provoking for a Disney Movie.
55;I loved how they took real life lessons and mix it in to a childs movie.
56;Another fine animated triumph from the Walt Disney Co., Mulan follows the struggle of a young girl during her country's time of war.
57;Murphy does a great job, very close to as good as Robin Williams in Alladin .
58;In addition, the usual love story is woven into this tale, complimented by a sound track that includes Christina Aguilera, Stevie Wonder, and 98 Degrees.
59;This movie is a great family movie!
60;There is a good reason in the movie that I feel is important for my daughters to learn.
61;This forgetable film has a chinese dragon with Eddie Murphy's voice.
62;Animation is what we expect from a Disney film, and the lesson is a good one.
63;Action, adventure and a young girl overcoming great odds to save her country and her father.
64;All done with catchy Disney songs and sweeping animation.
65;Great movie with adventure and of course one of Disney's little creatures who steal the show, in this case the little dragon Mushu.
66;My kids love this movie.
67;It was great for family night.
68;My Husband LOVES this movie and finally we watched it with some friends (who did the sing.
69;The best of disney with a great feminist story of being brave and being yourself :) Brilliant for all ages.
70;Disney's Mulan is a solid, well.
71;the animation is engaging"
72;The numbers don't contribute anything to the otherwise epic Eastern feel of the film (the best song is sung by.
73;On the other hand, I had expected to be thoroughly annoyed by Disney's penchant for cutesy sidekicks, but found myself instead pleasantly amused and entertained by Eddie Murphy's dragon character and his cricket chum.
74;And the Hun villain was impressively wicked.
75;It's refreshing to see a Disney film drawn from a source largely unfamiliar to Western viewers, and aside from the minor gripe about the music, I highly recommend it.
76;I'm ethnically Chinese and while I was concerned with how they were going to portray this beloved ancient legend we all learn in school as little kids, Disney came through and delivered with stunning animation, clever dialogues, an inventive overall plot that strengthened the story without losing its core spirit.
77;I am proud of what Disney has done to introduce this story to the world.
78;I enjoyed this film and really enjoyed Eddie Murphy as a voice over.
79;mulan has a moral story to tell to, and all in all I think it does a good job without letting the points get in the way of the story and dialogue which is way to easy to do.
80;The animation is wonderful as to be expected and the story flows well.
81;Never the less, it is a solid offering and a good recommendation.
82;I really love the story and the animation in this movie.
83;I was so happy when this came in the mail.
84;Not only is the story of Mulan heartwarming, courageous, and inspiring, the style of animation and the legend behind the movie is gorgeous as well.
85;"In addition, the special features and ""Behind the Scenes"" info given out made me love the movie even more."
86;What I liked best was seeing all of the concept art that was drawn before deciding on the permanent character designs was chosen.
87;I'd recommend this to any Disney fan.
88;I loved this movie when I was a kid.
89;Even now, when I watch it again, it still is just as great.
90;Perfect for the entire family!
91;My daughter liked this movie, as well as myself.
92;I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has there own little princess.
93;Was very pleased when I recieved it in the mail today .
94;Very Fast shipping for an international package.
95;Adorable inspiring movie for little girls.
96;She loves it, it plays in the background during playtime some days and she points out words she knows.
97;This was my son's favorite movie when he was little, and now my daughter's.
98;It's nice to see a cartoon without all the adult humor!
99;One that really is for kids!
100;This is a very cute story about a young girl who is looking to help her father.
101;I've always enjoyed this cartoon and will definitely watch it again.
102;Mulan is always getting into trouble but has good intentions, her little side kick dragon really makes the show enjoyable.
103;I've watched it many times with my kids and everything down to the music is entertaining!
104;I have to say that, though I did NOT contribute towards the making, I'm very proud of 'Mulan'.
105;I thought the characters, music and the design were superb.
106;american voice actress, in contrast to the noble, gentle, more authentic voice of her father.
107;It is also great to see them beginning to break away from the 'musical' format, further demonstrated by the use of music in Tarzan.
108;"all clean fun, albeit very dull sometimes, family entertainment
109;Disney has the best artists in the industry.
110;and it's great to see their material starting to reflect a more sophisticated, intelligent audience.
111;the story line is good.
112;It will keep you waiting for what will happen next.
113;I have to hand it to Disney they gave the perfect role to the perfect guy.
114;And in the end the whole fable and story is nice and communicates well with the mind of young children.
115;Keep up the good work !!
116;Maybe that is why the movie has a fresh look that's a departure from Disney!A new studio animation division called for new animators and directors, who were new enough not to fall into the cookie.
117;Although it didn't garnish as much recognition as Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin, Mulan is just as entertaining, witty, dramatic and FUNNY.
118;the theme, by the way, is honor, standing up for yourself, and keeping with those you love to the fullest extent!
119;visually, the animation is top.
120;The art is inspired by Chinese brushstrokes and beautiul subdued color palettes.
121;worthy, but okay to listen to.
122;The best song could be """"Be A Man"""", sung during the booth camp scenes."""
123;a landmark achievement for Disney in portraying a herione who, for once, is not helpless!
124;This is certainly the best Disney animation I've ever seen.
125;An awesome story line, beautiful Chinese elements, great songs and background music.
126;A note to those who find this animation Japanese.
127;The movie came very quickly and was in perfect condition.
128;This is a family friendly film that is just great every time around.
129;Lots of funny quotes and hilarious action.
130;Very inspiring movie as well.
131;the songs in Mulan, though you can count them on one hand, are catchy.
132;The story is lovely, too.
133;I recommend it if you're looking for a good movie for family night.
134;Mulan was one of the movies which impressed me much, and I hoped that the special edition would be publish soon.
135;When I received this, I was so excited!
136;And as a Chinese, I'm proud of Mulan and her heroic tale!I didn't expect the tableaux would be better, because the original ones were good enough.
137;What I adored was many bonus features about the movie, espcially things in disc 2.
138;"I loved ""Reflection"" Chinese version which was performed by CoCo."
139;I've listened to CoCo's version before, because some of my friends loved her songs very much.
140;"I thought Jackie Chan's ""I'll Make A Man Out Of You"" was excellent too, and I'm a big fan of him!But my favourite part was the video record of the making of ""Mulan""."
141;I was very excited to see this, because it seemed that Disney thought much of Chinese culture.
142;I thought I would learn this English version by heart!
143;I was so happy that this 2.
144;I'm very proud of being a Chinese youth, and I want to be friend of people from every contry!
145;This is a great animated film.
146;The story is empowering to little girls and the music and voices are great.
147;Great Movie Stands up to other Disney classics.
148;I really enjoyed this movie.
149;When it originally came out I was only eight years old and I loved it.
150;I think the story is so powerful and it is probably one of my favorite Disney movies!
151;I like the strong message it sends about feminism.
152;Mulan is a strong woman and she stands up for what she believes in.
153;For awhile I actually believed she was one of the guys in the war because she was so tough and strong.
154;I really like the message that this movie sends to young women.
155;It encourages them to be strong and to never give up!
156;This is definetely a film I'll watch again and again.
157;I'm too old for most Disney movies, but this one is brilliant.
158;All the songs are great, the best ones that come to mind are 'Reflection.'
159;but all the others are good, too.
160;The animation is also stunning, the scenes at Mulan's house and also in the parade near the end of the film are the best.
161;This is a film I recommend to anyone even if like me you thought you were growing out of Disney films.
162;This film actually lives up to its advertisment as 'a film the whole family can enjoy,' as most Disney films don't.
163;i love this movie because it proves you can do anything if u believe in yourself and put your mind to it.
164;i love the songs reflection and i'll make a man out of you.
165;my favorite characters are Mulan (of course)and Mushu.
166;this is a great movie for people of all ages.
167;I saw this film in the theater with my family and it was truly a stunning combination of today's 3.
168;And an original plot as well.
169;It was also a very daring break right out of the usual fairy.
170;A very sophisticated piece that would help contribute to the great animation revolution to make this kind of medium more universally appealing to everyone as Japanese anime.
171;this old Chinese legend still has quite a bit of fantasy in it as well.
172;This one is better than I expected.
173;Turns out it's really pretty good.
174;she has two magical allies: a dragon (Eddie Murphy at his best) who was sent by her ancestors to protect and aid her, and a cricket given to her by her grandmother for good luck.
175;the dragon is a little guy, but arguably the best character in the whole movie.
176;Doesn't matter how young or old you are this movie is very enjoyable.
177;Took it to work and my co worker (mid 30's) loved it as well!
178;I would highly recommend it as a family movie.
179;One whom of all ages can enjoy!!
180;This is a great movie with catchy songs.
181;Overall a really great movie and I would recommend to anyone boy or girl.
182;religion version of an altar call.
183;I watch it all the time and it always plays!
184;The movie is great, but it arrived about a week after it was supposed to.
185;By far this had to be the best out of all the disney classics!
186;This movie is a have to see for all ages.
187;not just a childs film only,she enjoyed this film.
188;Because they've underestimated what women can do.
189;"She'll never be worth anything!"""
190;Can Disney make up their minds about their own lies?!
191;The real Mulan is an example for females and males alike.
192;I have to say that out of all the Disney movies, this one will forever be in my heart!
193;The musical score for this movie outrates The Lion King soundtrack to me, and the dragon's character (voiced by Eddie Murphy) is about as good as I have ever seen on a cartoon!
194;Got it for my wife liked it a lot more when I was younger.
195;It's good movie for kids though.
196;Finally got thos movie and at a good price!
197;This is a classic family movie it was very enjoyable will diff it'll Definitely watch this movie again.
198;This movie is the best movie ever ive loved this movie since i was a little kid and i always wanted to be a princess.
199;Hahahah nah some might but I love Mulan and showed it to some kids I was babysitting!
200;I love most of the Disney movies whether they are animated or acted.
201;What impressed me most about this movie was not just the animation, voice acting, and music great, but the moral was super.
202;Most good movies have a lesson to be learned.
203;This one was incredibly simple and to the point.
204;I highly recommend this movie for the whole family.
205;My daughter loved this Disney movie.
206;My kids and I rewatched this a few weeks ago (they are 12 and 8) and we still enjoyed this movie.
207;I love that the hero is actually a heroine in a culture and time that doesn't value women.
208;My daughter is happy and it plays fine so that is why I gave it 3 stars instead my initial thought.
209;This is a hilarious movie!
210;It's fun, charming, and intriguing!
211;The music is wonderful as well!
212;My personal favorite is I'll Make A Man Out of You!
213;But as soon as I sent a message, this seller sent a new one right away, and it works great!
214;Would recommend doing business with, and would do business again.
215;Its a great movie, cute for kids and if your a disney mania person then its for you.
216;good for your collection of disney movies.
217;Disney's acclaimed film Mulan is a treat through and through.
218;It's high time they made a film with us folks in it, hehe!
219;For those who haven't seen Mulan, are the ones that are missing out on a great movie!
220;As good as the movie I remember seeing in the theatre.
221;Its a wonderful story and they love the three soldiers.
222;Being a Chinese, I really appreciate the efforts put into this movie.
223;Most of the movie is accurate to the old tale that my mother told me when I was a young girl.
224;naturally mom's version did not include a wisecracking dragon, but it was a welcome addition.
225;date jokes made it an easier story to comprehend.
226;Omg I love this movie so much.
227;The story line is superb and this is a movie for the ages.
228;Mulan is a great film for Disney lovers, especially for the type that gets annoyed by damsel in distress gets saved by prince charming.
229;Even her father doesn't thing she can make it through.
230;This scene is the funniest part, where she leaves a permanent mark on the matchmaker, a rather bad one.
231;She meets an amusing little cricket Krikee.
232;Another interesting and hilarious character is Mushu (voiced by Eddie Murphy.)
233;He's wisecracking, all the same.
234;Oh yeah, her name at the army camp is Ping.
235;na does a good job for the voice of Mulan.
236;This is one good movie for family night, or for that matter, any night that cable sucks, witch is most nights.
237;I straight out loved this movie.
238;She's strong, independent, and not afraid to stand up for herself.
239;With Eddie Murphy playing Mushu, there's some great laughs.
240;The ancestors also crack me up.
241;This is a great movie, though I wouldn't recommend showing it to small children due to some violent battle scenes.
242;Mulan is the beautiful young Chinese girl that has a kind of tomboyish way of thinking, way after her time.
243;She heals, but the injury revealed her true gender.
244;When the Huns arrive, she pulls together the army and engages in a swordfight with the leader of the Huns.
245;She is awarded the position of Emperor's advisor, and the respect and trust of everyone.
246;"This movie has some great music, the best by far being ""I'll Make a Man Out of You""."
247;It also has some great humor, thanks to Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy.
248;This is one of the best Disney movies that you can get and really has a good lesson to it.
249;That even young beautiful girls can have an important mission in life.
250;That love feelings and the desire to help are important and necessary to reach happiness and wisdom.
251;She has most every Disney movie but this is one of her favorites.
252;Not a classic really but still well made.
253;Along for the ride is Cri.
254;kee, a lucky bug, to help save the Emperor.
255;disney was heavily starting to use CG more often and combining traditional animation and it's still impressive to see.
256;Each Disney release usually has that one big action scene or animation showcase: the dance in Beauty and the Beast, stampede in Lion King and the Hydra fight in Hercules.
257;Here we get an avalanche and it still looks cool.
258;The rest of the cast is quite good, including Ming.
259;I guess this is as good a place to admit it as anywhere, but I've actually got the hots for Mulan!
260;At least with real movie stars, we can always fantasize about someday meeting them on the street and striking up a conversation, but Mulan will always remain out of touch.
261;It's well made and interesting because it shows that Disney is waking up to the fact that the Sleeping Giant itself is waking up.
262;There are over a billion people over there who need to be woven into Disney's world view and this is a great way to do it.
263;The bad guys are the Huns, but, as with a lot of Disney villains, they are actually quite likeable, as long as they don't touch a hair on the head of my sweet little Mulan, that is.
264;This order was received very fast and was exactly what it said it would be!
265;Thanks for the great service!
266;She thought it was really cute and loved it.
267;The switch proves to be both hilarious but shows the strength and love Mulan feels for her family.
268;The dragon (voiced by Eddie Murphy) injects even more humor and choas in this delightful tale.
269;In addition, the colorful backdrop of China's countryside and villages weaves a comfortable blanket around this story in which to enjoy.
270;In Mulan, Disney has created a character were young girls can find independance and heart.
271;My daughter is almost 3 and loves the Disney princesses and she loves Mulan.
272;I laughed so much at Eddie Murphys character, The Great And Powerful Mooshoe!I bought my cousins a copy, bought my sister a copy, then bought one for me!
273;Like this movie a lot!
274;just got it in the mail today.
275;The visuals in this film are stunning.
276;I find them very jarring in the presence of the beautifully rendered visuals of the Great Wall, Mulan's homestead, etc. for kids, at least for western kids, this is certainly not a fatal flaw, but it does lower the enjoyment for me.
277;Murphy's dragon (forgetting the American slang) is highly entertaining, Mulan is a heroine you want to cheer for, and the supporting characters are lovable.
278;This film is exceptionally well.
279;The vocal casting is spot.
280;on, with Eddie Murphy nearly stealing the show as Mushu, the wise.
281;The love Mulan has for her family, her father in particular, is well.
282;the animation is superb, the vocal talent is perfect in their roles, and the plot is well.
283;A definate feather in the cap of Disney!
284;She stands out from everyone in her culture, but she learns that no matter who she is she can become a hero to a nation because of her courage.
285;Find out what happens that causes Mulan to be brave and end up being a a hero to her nation.
286;Funny, loving, and a sweet movie.
287;Great for the kids to watch.
288;I feel that it is a value.
289;Mulan fits well in the long line of Disney's princesses who make us laugh cry and sing.
290;She was a welcome addition after a long getaway from the happy go lucky princess story line.
291;not only did she keep up the high par of romance and adventure, she broke boundaries that disney had not yet crossed.
292;an adventure where the princess was not only a heroine of the story line but a heroine of her entire country.
293;There are NO extra features except trailers and music videos!
294;I am a huge Disney fan and can say this!
295;I got this movie because its one of my favorite.
296;I was actually at Disney while they were creating Mulan, so I got to watch some of the artists work.
297;It was a very cool experience.
298;Mulan is a favorite to me.
299;it's excellent in matters of characters, making, and music.
300;When the movie trailers for this film came out, I thought, GREAT!
301;Finally an animated epic adventure from Disney!
302;And the sidekicks are only on the screen to be funny.
303;Don't get me wrong, they are funny!
304;if you're looking for a Disney comedy, this is a good movie for you.
305;Mulan is yet another superb Disney film I've seen.
306;It's tied for first with Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, and Finding Nemo.
307;To protect her father, she cuts her hair and puts on her armor (there was a wonderful dramatic music while she did that.
308;well, you have to watch the film!!!
309;This movie was so brilliant that I almost cried when I saw it in theatre.
310;It also has a nice final battle.
311;Still amusing how a girl could dress up like a guy and be better then other guys.
312;I know, it's a cartoon but I still find it humorous.
313;I donated it so someone else could enjoy it.
314;enlist, she ignores the fact that women caught serving in the army will be executed, stops listening to the voices that tell her she is forgetting her place as a woman, and does what her heart tells her is right, cutting her hair, taking her father's armour, and riding off one rainy night to serve in his place.
315;what I found amusing about the ancestral tete.
316;while failing to make a good first impression, Mulan eventually inspires the men when she succeeds at the first test Shang gave the recruits.
317;The finale is spectacular, and she who saves China pretty much saves the world.
318;kee, but they can learn about perseverance in spite of past failures because these characters believe in themselves and their ability to do good.
319;a highly recommendable tale told with Oriental grace!
320;I had not seen Mulan in a very long time and it was fun to watch it with my kid.
321;this is the best movie i've ever seen it's one of my favorite disney movies
322;So I played the movie just to see if everything is ok.
323;This movie is a prime example of why I did.
324;The money I spent on Mulan is the best investment I've made in several years.
325;The music is strong and beautifully done.
326;The characters while drawn in a simple and graceful style are detailed and very memorable.
327;The voice talents were impressive, but it is the caliber of the co. starring and bit player parts that impressed me the most.
328;A great movie to watch with your kids and one of the greatest movies that has been made.
329;Mulan doesn't exactly listen to her folks but she tries to do the right thing and she has very strong family ties.
330;She joins the Army in her father's place and ends up being a hero of China.
331;It's nice that there is a strong female character in the female Disney lineup and the songs are great.
332;The little Asian family jokes were hilarious!
333;The little details of humor are what made this movie so much fun to watch.
334;A nice relief of traditional animated movies (Pocohantas, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, etc.), though I've always loved Disney movies.
335;Read it from a real Chinese standpoint and you will note the difference.
336;Go lan go!i will make a man out of you!
337;Mulan has been a family favorite since it came out.
338;We have three boys, who all enjoyed the music and the action (as well as the humor, Eddie Murphy's pint.
339;size dragon being the highlight), and my wife and I have jobs in art (art teacher and graphic designer, respectively), so the adaptation of Chinese brush painting in the animation and backgrounds struck us as beautiful and wonderfully done.
340;A bonus for my wife is that Mulan, living and competing in a man's world, manages to become a real female hero.
341;In our experience, that's rare, and seldom done well in a movie, especially in a family movie.
342;We bought this movie for our daughter and she loves it.
343;The principles are profound, the humor is laugh.
344;loud, and the music is exhilarating.
345;a bit too Fushigi Yugi and not really very intelligent.
346;The best parts of the movie were the references to Japanese cartoons (anime).
347;Beyond that, there is a good deal of emotional content, though once the possibility of execution is lifted (a life for a life), it is never mentioned again.
348;Mulan is one of the strongest entries by Disney in the late 90's.
349;Aside from fantastic animation, what really makes this movie so great is it's intense epic.
350;like unfolding (which should attract adults), with the Disney comedic angle (Mushu, the Dragon) to attract the kids.
351;disney's 36th Animated release, also offers a strong message that I really don't think any of their films have had since Pinocchio.
352;boy or in this case a teenaged girl, can have courage and be unselfish when it comes to helping or protecting their family.
353;Although this movie may not be historically accurate, it certainly provides a high level of entertainment for the family.
354;It also shows that women need not take secondary roles in important historical events such as war.
355;This is my daughter favorite movie, so when I bought it.
356;The story is pretty good and the animation is attractive and clean but overall it just is not a well done movie so let me list me reasons for not liking Mulan.1.
357;Disney is not known for its subtlety and Mulan herself is a perfect example.
358;That's fine but not only is she successful in her subterfuge but she excels to the level of ridiculous.
359;There's a sassy horse, a sassy cricket and a sassy little dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy.
360;kee the cricket really eat into the actual story and most are not funny.3.
361;She is only accepted in the end because she manages to save the Emperor.
362;there is definitely stuff to like in this film and the few moments where Mulan is trying to hide her gender from her male comrades are done well.
363;Although this movie is not as good as some of its predecessors (such as the Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, etc.) it is still very enjoyable.
364;Its funny, adventurous and musical and keeps both my kids entertained.
365;I haven't seen a Disney animated feature since Lion King, but I saw Mulan recently with my wife and have to say I enjoyed it.
366;The story has a good balance between character and childish humor .
367;so both adults and kids can enjoy it.
368;Disney could have done a great job with this adaptation of a Chinese folk tale.
369;notch, with some beautiful scenery and a powerful action sequence.
370;The drama really adds to the tension in some scenes.
371;The music from Jerry Goldsmith is also a treat.
372;Disney could have made this one of its more outstanding animated films, if it weren't for all that humor.
373;All of this funny stuff is very out of place for such a powerful folk tale.
374;I ended up loving it!!
375;I thought it was a very good message about defying the norms of society and being yourself.
376;a very big step for Disney.
377;especially Reflection which has beautiful lyrics (also song brilliantly by Pop singer Christina Aguilera on the sountrack).
378;The animation is great, and very similar to my fav movie Pocahontas.
379;This in my opinion is the last great film in the wave of Disney musicals (beginning of course with a classic favorite Little Mirmaid).
380;I think she is a good role model for girls and in addition the story is great!
381;This will become a classic.
382;Disney sucks yes it's true.
383;But they do some dang good movies.
384;This is one of those great movies!
385;Mulan is one of the most funny and moving movies I have everseen.
386;mulan is a young, beautiful Chinese girl who is of amarriagable age.
387;this movie has got to be the best one that Disney has ever made, aside from Toy Story 2.
388;There is a wonderful moral lesson in this movie, and is extremely enjoyable at any age.
389;The entire movie is filled with witty and funny lines, like when Mushu says to Mulan You're da man!
390;It's perfect for any age.
391;Mulan is a refreshing change from the regular disney princesses.
392;she's real, fun and complicated.
393;big step up from the one dimensional Aurora and Snow White.
394;not sure Eddie Murphy was the best choice to be the voice of Mushi as his voice is really out of place.
395;But he is funny as usual and the rest of the movie makes up for that awkward combo.
396;i enjoy watching this movie over and over.
397;my grandkids come over very often so i watch it with them.
398;i was also very happy with how long it took to get it.
399;It's fine with me that Mulan is a well.
400;liked film but I hope that the viwers will keep in mind that the chinese history bit in Mulan is entirely inaccurate.
401;This film is well known by now, so going into detail about the fine story and animation is not necessary.
402;Disney movies are great for the kids, but they are also superior in their musical scores.
403;It's perfect to watch the movie on its language of origin .
404;It's a must have edition for those who are Disney fans!
405;more people would have seen this incredible film.
406;the voice acting is excellent, as is the screenplay.
407;Ming Na Wen and Lea Salonga do an excellent job as Mulan, with Eddie Murphy providing plenty of comic relief.
408;the art and the animation style shows that Disney is not limited to cookie cutter releases like Pocahontas and Hunchback.
409;That alone gives this movie an additional 1/2 star.
410;What could have been a great film, with a terrific story, and a terrific cast of voices, fails to be a truly great Disney film.
411;My niece brought this up, and she's only eight!
412;'Be A Man' and other songs are sure winnners, keeping right to the story, and the culture VISUALLY is great and acurate, so why not keep the culture of the way people spoke to each other back then?
413;Some of the jokes were funny.
414;like the part where Eddie Murphy's dragon was wearing the stone head of a guardian dragon to be disguised so he can save the day was hilarious!
415;have to be so SAFE FOR MODERN COOOOL RAD KIDS, HUH?So, keep up good humour and great stories.
416;watched Mulan last Christmas and loved it.
417;The story, a young Chinese girl fights in her injured father's place against the Hun army, is more complex than many animated movies.
418;Above all, Mulan is amusing, a good story, adn fast.
419;i enjoyed the music, which is rare for me.
420;I also loved how feisty Mulan was.
421;This is A Great movie and the extras aren't that bad because their wasn't alot, but that doesn't matter, the movie itself matters, and the movie is good.
422;My daughter and I have probably watched this about 6 times and we love it!
423;it Ralph) is a reminder of how great they have been, at their best.
424;The characteristics of great Disney animation?
425;Starts with a superb story .
426;Add to that exquisitely beautiful backgrounds and character work, which speaks to a long tradition of Chinese visual art, and then excellent voicing by everyone from Eddie Murphy to George Takei.
427;And, here is the best test .
428;if a film makes you cry, then it is really doing something, and this one does it for me a couple of times: first, when Mulan's father says the greatest honor is having you as a daughter and later, when Mulan brings honor home to the family.
429;It's a great presentation and it really holds up well.
430;The music is in the strong Disney tradition, with vocal pieces developed by Matthew Wilder and David Zippel and the awesome soundtrack by the late Jerry Goldsmith.
431;The story is well written, with characters the viewer can really feel for, particularly the main character Mulan.
432;Finally, the film is a visual masterpiece that really draws the eye to its beauty and helps to tell the story.
433;down of the special features.
434;The first disc contains songs / music videos and deleted scenes, as well as a tour of Mulan's World.
435;The songs in this movie are very strong and the music videos are no exception.
436;Some are better than others, but I definitely enjoyed them all.
437;"Jackie Chan's performance of ""Be a Man"" in Chinese was a great one to include."
438;Since it's Mushu, there are plenty of jokes, of course, but I feel this actually really was quite well done as far as learning goes.
439;Finally, the first disc includes a commentary track that gives a lot of insight into the making of the film, what things did and didn't work, and what some of the major people involved with the film liked.
440;scenes tour of the movie.
441;scenes featurette, this one has a bit more open feel.
442;this is definitely the complete package of what one would expect from a two.
443;I will tell you one thing this is my favorite Disney movie of all time.
444;It has a great storyline of honor, courage, and hope.
445;This movie has a great Ending!
446;(and middle and beggining) This movie also has great songs!
447;Also the great comedian Eddie Murphy stars as the voice of an outgoing dragon, Mushu.
448;This movie is for all ages.
449;My father even thinks its one of Disne3y's best because of the great storyline of courage.
450;I reccomend it to everyone!
451;super nice ok superb sos so well er ah maybe tough soft creamy dreamy superb sos so well er ah maybe
452;I got the 2 disk set from the library and was as happy with the film as when I saw it in theaters.
453;It has interesting facts, some creative insights, pre production art stills, and due credit given to the tiawanese crew member who contributed priceless cultural experience.
454;I would have liked more depth about China, it's landscapes, buildings, and morals/values .
455;It's an overcomer theme that has a happy ending, like classic bedtime stories do.
456;I want clear cut good and evil, honorable heroes, wise leaders, and realistic emotions.
457;Such strength of character and love for others .
458;has largely disppeared from American culture.
459;He detracts from the cultural context .
460;artistically, look at the character creation bonus feature and the stills.
461;For example, the horse Khan, is very angular with large body and very thin legs, emphasizing strength and grace.
462;I would recommend everyone see this movie.
463;Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty.
464;I'd like to see Cinderella do that.
465;The characters are also great.
466;Mushu the tiny red dragon (who is voiced by Eddie Murphy) is hilarious.
467;Shan Yu and the Hun army are perfect villains for the movie and the ancestors are funny.
468;I always crack up when I see what happens with the Matchmaker.
469;As a teacher and a mother, I believe Mulan is the best Disney video and story for young girls.
470;I have always loved Mulan.
471;This was so easy to use and we enjoyed watching it!
472;The movie was very clear and the price was great, too!
473;I decided to take a risk anyways and it was all worth it!
474;Most importantly, my daughter loves this movie and hearing it in Mandarin.
475;My grandaughters love this movie and watch it over and over again.
476;I enjoy watching them enjoying the movie and sitting still for a while.
477;Mulan is probably my favorite disney movie.
478;The attack scene on the snow bluff is truly awesome and thanks goes to Disney for allowing us to choose the format to view the movie, since the scene is really impressive on the widescreen.
479;This movie is worth the money, although I think it lacks one good love song between Mulan and the Captain at the end.
480;year old loves this Disney movie.
481;Highly recommended for little empowered girls.
482;I was very impressed with the process of ordering, as well as the promptness of receiving my order.
483;My favorite animated Disney movie of all time!
484;Strong protagonist, lovely artwork, wonderful music and everything else you could ever hope for in a Disney movie.
485;This is the best animated movie Disney ever made, bar.
486;After umpteen viewings I still laugh at Mushu's zingers.
487;correct [yuch] honesty: why the culture is male oriented, Mulan's dillemma, her conflicted path and the ultimate truism: nothing succeeds like success.
488;One of my favorite Disney movies and was really happy to find it!
489;Was in great condition when I received it with the wrapping still on it!
490;The Walt Disney Gold Collection is a group of films that inspire wonder and imagination for a life time, and Mulan fits that description perfectly!Mulan was a young woman a long time ago in China.
491;With the help of Mushu, a tiny dragon, and criki, she becomes a great warrior.
492;Mulan has two incredible music videos as featured on the Mulan soundtrack: Reflections by ChristinA Aguilera, and True To Your Heart by 98 degrees and Stevie Wonder.
493;I loved this movie when my kids were young and now I am introducing my grand daughter to it as well!!
494;Thank you soooo much my girls love the movie and it works great and it got here sooner than thy said and thank you very happy
495;The story line was real good.
496;My daughter loved this movie.
497;I would recommend this movie to young viewers.
498;Walt Disney would be proud, as this is their finest work since Snow White.
499;The story, the music, and the art are a thing of beauty, that melts together as Mulan
500;I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie was well.
501;written and the musical numbers extremely charming.
502;I found the bad guys suitably evil and the animation well.
503;This version has some excellent background information on an alternate title sequence and some other bits and pieces on deleted scenes and that sort of thing.
504;I really liked this movie, and so did my 5 year old son.
505;He has seen it repeatedly.
506;It provides a good message to both boys and girls that women can be heroes too.
507;Show a girl with determination and family bond.
508;Would recommend this movie for a family night movie
509;While not one of my favorites as a Disney movie lover/collector this is a good movie and fun to watch.
510;The voice/character of Eddy Murphy was a great choice for an dragon with an attitude.
511;mulan, the character, is animated by Mark Henn, one of the main animators behind the beautiful and timeless Disney heroines of the 90s.
512;Like Jasmine, Mulan's movements are feminine, lively, and nuanced, and show how much love he put into his work.
513;Here, though, she brings sympathy and depth to the character.
514;Mulan to me is the perfect heroine.
515;Still, it is the character of Mulan that makes this movie a favorite.
516;Saw this in the theatre with my kids so long ago.
517;great script, great characters and beautiful songs!
518;This is one of Disney's many hits and classics, a must watch for all.
519;Although i take myself more for a Lilo and Stitch and Lion King fan.
520;Mulan is beautiful in story, art and style.
521;The writers do an excellent job sticking to the story and the characters.
522;what sets this story apart for me is that Mulan is selfless in the story and the themes of family, respect, tradition, and sacrafice take center stage.
523;The morals and principles of this story are very clear and very powerful.
524;i enjoyed every aspect of this film from start to finish and like many of the recent animated features in the past two decades this film is definately not just for children.
525;mulan will probably be the last great tradional cel animated feature from Disney for a long time.
526;I know a lot of people enjoyed Tarzan and Lilo and Stitch, but Mulan is a notch above those titles.
527;It is two bad, because I really enjoy both formats.
528;This is a story that the whole family liked and we watched it several times, but then interest waned.
529;I thought the action was good and the characters interesting, so I think it was the music.
530;The music can make a big difference.
531;What would the Hunchback of Notre Dame be without that wonderful music!
532;great movie for all ages.
533;there is a great lesson learned from the movie.
534;A wonderful animation from Disney studios.
535;My children love this move and it is one they watch over and over.
536;its something every disney fan needs and would love!
537;Mulan is one of my favorite Disney movies.
538;The songs and story are very enjoyable.
539;I am happy to own it in my collection.
540;It was all great stuff from childhood.
541;I was impressed by this Disney film for so many reasons.
542;Mulan has got to be one of the strongest Disney female characters that ever saw production, in the midst of a colorful and artistic film, that will resonate in your memory.
543;mulan, in fact, has more in common with male Disney leads than the female Disney leads.
544;She is quick to act, like Eric (mermaid.)
545;She also speaks her mind, even in a culture that does not allow such a thing.
546;This movie also has a simple, but very effective villain, Shan Yu.
547;The characters were well thought out and expertly drawn.
548;Not enough songs were present for my liking, but those that were fit perfectly with the story, and the chance to hear the wonderful voice of Lea Salonga (Mulan's songs) is worth the price of this film alone.
549;Eddie Murphy has managed to be as good, if not better, than Robin Williams as the comic sidekick.
550;And the film's conclusion is as genuine and as heartfelt as any adaptation of this story.
551;other than that, it's a wonderful movie to the Disney list.
552;Disney's Mulan is one of the most subtle pieces of work to come out of the Disney studios in years.
553;There is a quiet charm to this film that makes it quite enjoyable to watch again and again.
554;Produced almost entirely by Disney's Florida unit, Mulan is a refreshing departure from what we're used to from the Mouse House, and a welcomed one at that.
555;Mulan is a traditional story for modern girls and is highly entertaining.
556;My boys love watching Mulan.
557;While the theme that the movie covers is complex for my children, I have found that they like the action and the silliness.
558;she is one of my favorite disney princess of all time, great plot and my sister loves it very much
559;This movie is great for children and adults.
560;I love how the movie has a lesson about pride and honor in it.
561;I also love the animation and the funny parts too.
562;so it has something for both kids and adults.
563;:) This was the first time I saw this movie and I love it so much I watched it twice within the 48 hour period.
564;I would recommend this product to both kids and adults.
565;Love Mulan since I was a kid.
566;Excellent movie with a new type of heroine.
567;No one rants about how beautiful, gentle, kind and intelligent she is.
568;Mulan is someone that most girls will relate to at some level.Yet, she displays courage and stamina beyond any other Disney heroine.
569;SHE'S the hero at the end, combining both masculine strategy with feminine guile.
570;the animation is spectacular: the battle with the Huns, the Imperial palace and the mountain scenes are particularly breath.
571;it works great=) I bought it for my sister and she loves it.
572;This is one of the best written and scored Disney movies.
573;A family favorite that I would recommend to all ages!
574;I finally got to watch this movie and have to say that I personally enjoyed it very much.
575;The children seemed to enjoy it as well.
576;old loves it and I enjoyed it thoroughly as I watched it with her.
577;Everyone loves her in the end because she saves China.
578;This is one of the best Disney movies with a Great message!
579;True, in this beautiful Disney tale of a young chinese girl, Disney gave us a strong female heroine who did stand up and create an ancient women's lib .
580;But beyond this, this movie is sheer eye candy.
581;With beautiful scenery and breath.
582;Eddie Murphy adds hilarity to the tiny dragon Mushu.
583;com to watch with my family.
584;Prior to watching Mulan, I have always loved all of the movies Disney has released in the past, many were unforgetable, and very well writen, both loved by adults and children as well, with very well researched and written scripts to always have a meaning to both adults and children.
585;My children are 13 and 11, both boys, and I was proud of the fact that they were able to clearly see the wrong interpretations of chinese culture that you displayed in your movie.
586;I am very proud to be chinese american, and very proud to be living in the United States, but you must not deny me of my passionate feelings for my culture.
587;I was always taught to respect others.
588;This is Disney at its finest.
589;I first saw this movie with my children.
590;I now have it on hand for my grandchildren!
591;(but I secretly sneak and watch it when I'm alone sometimes) Delightful, with great principals that can be picked out during the movie.
592;"She is guided with the help of a feisty chatterbox dragon named ""Mushu"" and a lucky Cricket named ""Cri."
593;"a monumental animated masterpiece that is totally the best disney movie i've ever seen, glorious animation, good story, a good cast ( Eddie Murphy, Ming La, B. d. Wong, Miguel Ferrer from ""Robocop"", and Pat Morita) and good lessons creates a wonderful and spellbinding animated experience you will always remember."
594;This pair is a hilarious combination.
595;There is also a surprising twist to the ending.
596;A cute, funny Disney classic about a girl who thinks she needs to be more than who she is.
597;Good entertainment for children and adults.
598;Disney animated movie Mulan, as always represents a step forward in an evolving path of superb and creative touch!
599;its scenery, its extraordinary music, and even the message made us all cry at the end.
600;As a Technological guy I really admire Disney's innovation capabilities!
601;I loved this movie .
602;And people young at heart .
603;Although many recent Disney animated films earned more money than Mulan, in my opinion Mulan is the best Disney animated film period!
604;This film has some of the strongest and most dignified characters of any Disney film in recent memory.
605;an excellant movie for the whole family!
606;She exemplified all women who had both the brains and the guts to follow her heart, show her true worth and desire to bring honor to her own home.
607;with courage and perseverance, she learned the skills of a true warrior.
608;i loved her sidekick Mushu and the cricket, who indulged the audience with their humorous antics, thereby giving the film some humor and light touch.
609;Mulan is one of my kids favorite Disney movies.
610;We only had the VHS version, so I was happy to be able to find this updated version for the family.
611;Beautiful fun movie with good music and characters.
612;The voice cast is well suited to their roles.
613;Mushu is charming in a bumbling sort of way.
614;The songs are funny if you take the time to listen to the words.
615;The Disney version of Mulan is a very precious addition to anyone's Disney collection.
616;In this masterpiece, a young woman by the name of Mulan feels uncomfortably pressured to be the traditional perfect bride and daughter of her time and culture in China.
617;When her previously injured father is called to serve, Mulan seizes the opportunity for adventure and honor and takes his place.
618;Tagging along with her is ex.
619;guardian Mushu, a tiny scrawny dragon willing to put her life in danger to regain his position of exalted guardianship, her lucky cricket, and her trusted anti.
620;Together they embark on a remarkable journey so save China and, perhaps, herself.
621;And will Mushu ever regain his position?Mulan is played by the talented and spirited Ming Nga (sp?)
622;and Mushu by the hilarious and gifted Eddie Murphy.
623;It is a worthwhile addition to any collection.
624;"Songs include ""Honor to us all"" and the hilarious and inspiring ""Be a Man"" sequence."
625;personally, my favorite character in the movie was the cricket, and I loved the never ending Mushu/Khan feud.
626;This movie was a great surprise.
627;This could have been so good .
628;the animation is stunning, but eye.
629;Mulan is one of the most amazing, movies I ever seen.
630;Its True you have to pay extra because disney movies are hard to come by now.
631;But it is definetly worth the money!
632;This is my most favorite movie of all time.
633;I know ithas dull graphics, but the story is beautiful.
634;Instead of watching her father die, she does something about it.
635;she cutted her hair and putted it in a bun.
636;She learns that beauty isn't the key to honor.
637;When China is invaded by the Huns, there is one line in the movie that is uttered by the emperor and it is SO insightful.
638;The general in charge of the armies confidently announces that his men can handle this invasion.
639;one man may make a difference between conquest and defeat.
640;In this case, it turns out to be a woman!
641;even after she is a hero, Mulan is disgraced when it is discovered that she is a woman.
642;She is shunned and yet when she must come to the rescue of China again, her comrades are loyal to her and listen to her ideas.
643;mulan is a cute and VERY funny movie with adorable songs.
644;What makes it a GREAT movie however, is the very powerful message that we should judge one another on our merits and character .
645;My four year old loves the stories.
646;Girls are portrayed positively and the stories are engaging.
647;Positive cultural diversity is also present In the programs
648;The product was new like described, and works perfectly.
649;My daughter is completely happy, and the item was delivered quickly.
650;My daughter and granddaughter both love this movie.
651;It is nice to see films portraying women in roles of leadership and strength.
652;watching it after a long time was so much fun.
653;It is definitely worth your money for you, and possibly your kids to watch together.
654;This cartoon justifies that women, too, can be brave and strong.
655;Also, the focus of this Disney production, for once, were not White.
656;Mulan may not be a princess, but she's definitely ranked up there with the Disney princesses we grew up to admire, perhaps even better than them.
657;She is brave, smart, beautiful, and selfless.
658;My daughter is 16 and this is still her favorite movie!
659;We were happy it was available for streaming and worked well.
660;It features a VERY strong and likeable heroine, a hysterical performance by Eddie Murphy as the dragon sidekick, fabulous animation (the army storming over the snow covered mountainside, etc.), and a very funny scene with Mulan and the village's matchmaker.
661;Absolutely flawless animation, orchestral score, etc.
662;Mulan and Hunchback are two of the best efforts of the latest Disney offerings.
663;"Although ""Mulan"" isn't my favorite of the big Mouse's productions, it is definitely in my top ten."
664;In this tale, a young girl goes against tradition and takes her father's place in a great war with the Mongols by disguising herself as a young man.
665;The tale has been told before in various forms, but it works very well in this picture.
666;the story gives girls a strong message of doing what you believe in or what is best, even though it may go against tradition or the majority's point of view.
667;In the end, Mulan not only gains the respect of her fellow soldiers, but of the entire empire of China.
668;the action sequences are fairly intense, although there are really only two major battles.
669;The first is the brilliantly animated fight in the snowy mountains where the Chinese, outnumbered, take on a huge Mongol force lead by the sinister main villain whose name escapes my memory right now.
670;All we really know is that he wants to take over the Chinese empire.
671;The rest of the character voices include B. d. Wong, Pat Morita and a hilarious Harvey Fierstein.
672;Murphy does a splendid job with the character, though I think he could have been given a little more room to expand on the character.
673;"In all honesty, Mushu is almost as funny as Murphy's ""Donkey"" from the ""Shrek"" films."
674;the songs in this film are pretty good.
675;Reflection is a rather good song that is performed by Mulan(singing voice provided by Lea Salonga).
676;The song is very inspiring.
677;"It just sounds great and reminds me of Elvis' ""GI Blues."""
678;You'd think the military would be an odd setting for musical numbers, but it works in both of these films.
679;"Another excellent song is ""True To Your Heart,"" performed by Stevie Wonder and boy band 98 Degrees."
680;good song that finishes off the film in great fashion.
681;I highly recommend this to folks with young daughters due to its good message.
682;Don't worry if you only have sons, the message works for them as well, and there's plenty of action to quench their craving for fight scenes.
683;This movie is probably the last really good animated feature ever made.
684;But, this movie holds up the classic Disney tradition of good storytelling, animation, and moving music.
685;With the Huns invasion the emperor of China asks one man for each family to serve in the army.
686;Mulan continually humilates her family who she loves greatly.
687;a wise cracking dragon to guard her.
688;"With such memorable songs as ""Reflection"", ""I'll Make A Man Out Of You"", and ""True To Your Heart."""
689;You'll find yourself singing along with the songs.
690;"I love the song ""I'll Make A Man Out Of You""."
691;Donny Osmond has the most amazing voice.
692;"I LOVE the bonus features such as the music videos especially the one with Jackie Chan(He was the Chinese voice for Chang) singing in Chinese ""I'll Make A Man Out Of You."""
693;i love this film and continually watch it over and over again.
694;I'll give it 4 stars.
695;This is the best Disney movie ever made.
696;Mulan is a girl who follows her heart and is brave enough to carry out what she set out to do, which is to save her Father's honor.
697;The Disney magic is added to the film as she falls in love while learning her worth.
698;You can decide for yourself, but this really is the best Disney movie ever made.
699;I love this movie and so do my boys.
700;We love this movie, and it was so easy to access since we don't own it!
701;i believe this was the last great traditional animated film from disney.
702;this film and its villians are one of my inspirations.
703;My daughter had to do a report on this movie and she was able to do so and get a good grade!
704;This is definatly a good Disney that deserves to be remembered.
705;It is new and creative.
706;It ditches the romance and features a female heroine that actually is a hero.
707;But, overall, this is a wonderful Disney film that should be treasured for many years to come.
708;Mulan is one of my all time favorite movies.
709;You can easily fall in love with all the characters.
710;The special edition will have lots of neat features.
711;truly a story of strength, grit and determination.
712;I am so happy with the product.
713;My daughter speaks both English and Mandarin so I want her to be exposed to both languages including watching them on TV.
714;actors were great and fit perfectly with the movie (not a monotone knockoff).
715;time favorites, I gladly agreed.
716;All of the characters are created so that they come to life.
717;It has humor, adventure, romance, drama.
718;This movie is the best, it's funny,it's well written, it's moving, it's EVERYTHING.
719;Price is good and both discs arrived in excellent condition, no complaints there.
720;My girlfriend really love it.
721;This was one of her favorite movies as a child, so I bought it for her for Christmas.
722;My daughter still loves this move.
723;It's very inspirational and one of our favorite Disney Princess movies!
724;My favorite Disney movie of all times!
725;There is just so much you can learn from this movie at every point in your life :D
726;This movie was a great family feel good movie.
727;There is a strong message for us all when watching Mulan.
728;The main character, Mulan, represents the cluminess in all of us.
729;Having seen this many times and enjoy it more as time goes by.
730;Very good storyline and animation as Disney is knowned for, this is one of their best IMO.
731;highly recommended viewing for all ages!
732;I was pleased that the movie was shipped to me in a timely manner, and the that it arrived at my door in excellent condition.
733;Thank you for the great merchandise!
734;I highly recommend this seller.
735;I'm no feminist but I do love it when the girls are able to beat the guys at their own game.
736;Disney's 'Mulan' is a wonderfully entertaining story about courage and comradeship with all the typical (and necessary) Disney mushy stuff too.
737;I love this movie and have already added it to my collection.
738;Eddie Murphy's little dragon is fantastically funny and the scene with Mulan and her father at the end always brings a tear to my eye.
739;It is a dark movie with war and killing and Mulan is technically a transexual!
740;What makes a good review?Be detailed and specific.
741;She bluffs her way into the army, struggles through the training process, and eventually succeeds in becoming a real soldier, winning the respect of her comrades and doing her bit to save the Empire.
742;this is a wonderful film, with gorgeous animation, a thrilling plot,lots of humour, great characters and a superb score.
743;Mulan herself is an attractive and heartwarming heroine who keeps your interest and sympathy throughout.You feel like cheering when she manages to climb to the top of the pole and throw down the arrow, and there is a breathtakingly exciting scene where the Huns come sweeping down the snow.
744;Eddie Murphy is very funny as Mushu, and Mulan's army colleagues are amusing too.
745;Everything about this film is an absolute delight.
746;Based on historical account, Mulan is Disney's presentation of how the spirit and courage of a young woman outsmarted the barbarians who tried to invade China.
747;Though Walt Disney Pictures has made many animated features, the vast majority are based on stories common in western cultures.
748;Mulan breaks new ground as an animated feature from a Chinese fable.
749;However, Mulan overcomes stereotypes and helps defend her country, and charms us along the way.
750;this movie has an incredible cast.
751;na provides the voice of Mulan.
752;na won an Annie Award for her voice portrayal of Mulan.
753;Eddie Murphy is perfect and funny as the dragon Mushu whose heart is bigger than his body or his brains.
754;The late Pat Morita is excellent as the voice of the Emperor of China.
755;Numerous other voice talents bring this movie to life.
756;Matthew Laborteaux, Gedde Watanabe, James Hong, and numerous other stars make their appearances in this film.
757;as with many Disney films, this movie includes several excellent songs.
758;Singing those songs are well known artists Christina Aguilera, Stevie Wonder, 98 Degrees, Donny Osmond and Lea Salonga.
759;this movie captured more than the hearts and minds of viewers.
760;This movie also captured 14 awards and 13 award nominations, including a nomination for an Oscar.
761;This movie also has one of the highest box office totals of all time, ranking in the top 200 as of the date of this review.
762;steps in movie productions as it seeks to regain the prominence in family films that it once had.
763;This movie placed Disney Pictures back in the spotlight as one of the premiere studios for making family films.
764;I believe that most families will enjoy this tale based on a Chinese fable.
765;Along the way perhaps members of the family will learn something about heroism and selflessness, and that girls and women have far greater capability than many, including themselves, give them credit.
766;This was a favorite movie of mine growing up and I am so happy I bought it because its a movie that I can enjoy with my kids.
767;When this movie came out I was a preteen and could easily relate to Mulan.
768;This is one of my favorite Disney movies (Aladdin , the Studio Ghibli releases, and Lion King being some of the others).
769;This will be a family favorite for a while.
770;I would recommend for the whole family!P.
771;It was a good laugh.
772;I love the movie and this was just what I wanted.
773;:) Worth every cent of the price and earned the 5 stars!
774;This is the wonderful story of Fa Mulan, based on the ancient Chinese story of the girl who disguised herself as a man to go to war to save her aging, crippled father from having to go as representative of the Fa family.
775;"goo, ""Mulan, I love you!"
776;all in all, still and amazing, amazing, wonderful movie.
777;This film had the usual Disney excellence in animation, music, visual impact, etc.
778;But what really pleased me (as a mother) is that finally we have a strong female heroine, whose stands up against the patriarchal nonsense.
779;a wonderful story of a young woman conquering her fears and finding/creating her place in a world where she doesn't fit, where they will not hear her.
780;Mulan has the courage to step outside society's norm and be herself, to persevere and find her power, and thus achieves greatness.
781;The story is exciting, amusing, heart.
782;The legend is wonderful and that basic message is there.
783;Mulan got me interested in Disney again.
784;I've always loved their movies but the last few years I have not enjoyed the movies at all.
785;It was great, a fantastic story, it's a movie I can watch again and again.
786;i loved the strong female character, the fact that she used her mind as well as the fighting skills she learned was great.
787;Disney did a good job with Mulan by giving us a movie that adults and children both can watch and love.
788;Mulan is my favorite Disney movie besides Beauty and the Beast.
789;It came to my house very quickly too, I was very impressed and surprised.
790;i would definitely recommend Amazon video and will watch more on Amazon video.
791;The morals behind a Disney movie are the things that I always look for.
792;Mulan is her own person and her pride for her family shines bright.
793;Not everyone in this world is destined to fit into the person that our family wants us to be.
794;Mulan is brave and a hardworker and I think Mushu for the comedy relief that keeps the movie light at times.
795;This is my favorite Disney movie and I would have loved another song or two but the songs that were in the movie (In order: Honor to Us All , Reflection , To be a Man and A girl worth fighting for ) were definitely some of my Disney favorites!
796;:)Mulan is a lovely character, the voice actors (Donny Osmond singing, Eddie Murphy speaking) do some of their best work ever.
797;This is my favorite Disney movie.
798;It my favorite movie watch it more than 100 times when I was little I really love it!
799;I got it on time!
800;she loved it when she saw it in the movies.
801;Mulan is the first Disney movie with that old Disney heart and magic in a long time.
802;It has everything for a good family movie.
803;a strong story, fantastic characters, heart, and a strong hero or heroine.
804;The songs aren't anything to praise, but a few are rather nice.
805;The humor is also great, even though it's not of Aladdin calibur.
806;The modern Disney formula is still there, like Mushu's western voice and behavior, but Mulan still provides great fun for all.
807;I've taken a lot of flak for trashing Tarzan, but this movie is infinitely better.
808;Although, Donny does a decent job.
809;Following this movie we have yet to have another Disney theatrical animated feature that features the characters singing songs Broadway.
810;Strange considering that Disney were making animated musicals during the years when bursting into song in a film was not considered fashionable and, not long after Mulan was made, the musical came back into cinematic vogue.
811;The songs in Mulan are wonderfully fitting and, although the score has nothing to seriously rival Be Our Guest or Circle of Life, numbers like Reflection and I'll Make a Man Out of You deserve a place in Disney's musical Hall of Fame.
812;mulan is not one of Disney's mordern greatest hits along the lines of The Lion King, The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast.
813;The audio commentary should be extremely interesting (they always are) as should the information supplied on China and it's customs (although they are sure to be child.
814;friendly since they're hosted by an animated dragon!)
815;For the adults and buffs there seems to be plenty of behind.
816;Digital Dim Sum also sounds very interesting.
817;My granddaughters love this movie.
818;They will watch the whole show.
819;Disney came through with another great film!
820;The film opens with a breathtaking view of China's Great Wall, built especially to keep the Huns at bay, but the builders never foresaw the development of the grappling hook.
821;"now all of China knows you are coming!"""
822;the scene is one of the most memorable in the film.
823;two of the more memorable scenes include the discovery of the devastated village and the body of Li Shang's father.
824;a memorable moment on a knoll where Captain Shang mounts his father's helmet atop his sword.
825;The second is the spectacular battle sequence on a snowy mountain top.
826;"The songs, most notably ""I'll Make a Man out of You"" and ""True to Your Heart"" are upbeat and fun."
827;The animation is excellent while the character art takes a little getting used to, similarly as the art in Hercules.
828;The signature CGI are pieces are subtle and as the technology improves are meshed even more seamlessly with the traditional animation methods.
829;This movie is fun to watch for the whole family.
830;The dragon is the best character of the movie.
831;The story is cute and makes sense!
832;A lot of adult humor is included that the kids won't even understand!
833;Mulan is still an awesome movie.
834;This is the best thing Disney has come out with in years.
835;all in all, this was a fabulous film, with fabulous scenery, seamless animation, and a great storyline.
836;a great and inspiring young girl who seeks to uphold the family honor and save her fatherwonderful!
837;This is a great movie by Disney and I would recommend it to anyone.
838;Myself and my friends all liked it and we are ever teenagers!!!!
839;Great for the entire family.
840;There is fun, adventure and a touch of history.
841;It's nice to see a film that doesn't center on a ditzy princess, and is based off the Chinese legend of Fa Mulan.
842;She tries her darnedest to be the best daughter, and it's hard to not appreciate her efforts.
843;Mulan meets some funny characters as she tries to keep up her disguise as a man, and proves herself worthy of being a warrior.
844;This has to be one of my favorite films because it shows a woman in such a positive and strong light.
845;This movie was super cheap for a Disney movie and plays perfectly.
846;I like this movie because a lot of times I feel like Mulan.
847;I like this movie because of the cool songs, and the fun charictures like Mushoo.
848;Of course I drive my brother nuts with singing all the kewl songs.
849;But this is defenently one of my most favorite movies.
850;Mushu is hilarious, Khan cracks me up, and you root for Mulan throughout.
851;I didn't like the dragon very much but it was entertaining and a well made movie.
852;"You will excuse me if I spend some little time defending this film against his critique
853;But I never expected them to, and I give them a good deal of credit for trying.
854;They came quite a bit closer that I ever thought that they would.
855;But the real issue is the worth of the film itself, and on this I take exception to the review below.
856;I believe there is more in it than Mr. Mydo gives credit for.
857;I also find it somewhat irksome that one minor character, Mushu the dragon, continually steals attention away from the movie's proper focus.
858;The opening """"brush painting"""" of the Great Wall"
859;the sheer artistry of these scenes is breathtaking.
860;This movie is a real classic.
861;supposed to be for children, but adults love it, too.
862;This movie is an original.
863;My granddaughter loves the Disney movies.
864;I ordered this for her as a gift, she was happy and so was her mom.
865;Truly a great piece of art.
866;and does a wonderful job getting the viewer attached to the main character, Mulan.
867;chinese descent and I actually liked this movie!First, it has a positive message for young girls.
868;"Her strength comes from her basic (& sometimes flawed) humanity, not from aggression (or trying to be ""perfect"") and that's what I liked about the character."
869;As far as Chinese history and culture is concerned, Disney gets the basic look of pre.
870;"fu not Japanese ""karate"") is also depicted accurately."
871;The fact is, the Chinese developed gunpowder and created the first guns ever!)
872;To be sure, there are some modern references in Eddie Murphy's monologues, but remember, this is an animated comedy!
873;(Nobody complains about those movies, because those films are made by Asians!)
874;(But, as a marketing ploy, the singing and sales of the soundtrack make sense and I'm sure little kids liked the songs.)
875;I definately recommend this movie.
876;use it to teach student a differant way of seeing the world other the the United State very good teaching tool
877;A great Disney film with everything you expect from animation.
878;I especially like the dual wide.
879;screen feature which lets you choose how to view the film.
880;First Ancestor Fa sends Musho to awaken the Great Stone Dragon, but in doing so Mushu accidently destroys the Great Stone Dragon.
881;Mushu pretends that he is the Great Stone Dragon and sets out, along with Cri.
882;back at the Imperial City Captain Li Shang and his men are welcome as heroes of China.
883;Mulan won several Annie Awards and grossed $304 million worldwide.
884;The special effects in Mulan are great and Mulan gets an AAA+++.
885;She was a strong young woman who was protecting the health, safety and honor of her father and her family.
886;It was really a step in the right direction to show that a woman doesn't have to be driven by romance or the affections of another to be a strong role model and a leader.
887;I enjoyed this movie (given that it's typical Disney), but the video transfer is definitely not the 4.5 that Widescreen Review gives it.
888;deserved promotion which I'm sure set the country back for 1,000 years more, it is nice to see Eddie Murphy get the promotion that he so desperately seeks from his own hollywood.
889;In the Disney version, they pump it up, and make her wounded, and they find out she's a woman, but she saved the captain's life, so he spared hers, and blah blah, she became the herion of China.
890;It really brings out the Chinese Tradition, and still, a lot of girls, ranging from young little girls to the elders, they still look up to her, and so do I.
891;Maybe one of the most mature and serious features Disney has developed.
892;humor, love and hate., creates an intelligent story that no one should miss.
893;"She cuts her hair, steals her dad's war weapons and gets enlisted in the military calling herself ""Ping""."
894;On the road she meets 2 cartoonish.y friends, a funny dragon called Mushu and a cricket called, Crikee (convenient).
895;Both give the usual touch of comedy in this kind of movie.
896;And she proves both intelligence and courage in the battlefield.
897;Her search to defend her family name and to get approval of her way of thinking is told with great style.
898;the animation is very nice, from scenes as impressive as the battle in the snow to the parade before the Imperial palace.
899;All of them very positive notions for children and adults, to learn and practice.
900;one of my favorite disney movies !
901;my daughter loved it and we have watched it every day for a week
902;Ok for all you people complaining about it not being exact to the true Mulan story *rolls eyes*, it's a Disney interpretation!
903;It's going to be altered and changed a bit so CHILL!
904;This movie is fantastic, has a very memorable Mulan who's struggles anyone can relate to and the music is breath taking.
905;Loved it almost as much as Tangled.
906;It also has a good message about empowered girls.
907;this disney masterpiece is a real visual treat for everyone.
908;the true story of mulan is so beautiful it takes you along.
909;Our kids love watching this over and over and over.
910;they have the songs memorized, lol!
911;My toddler loves this movie it was a must have and a joy to view.
912;I think she has a fascination with Disney films.
913;Based on a beloved Chinese legend, Mulan is a lovely, spirited, intelligent, outspoken, but less than graceful young girl growing up in ancient China.
914;"there's a lot of animosity towards the Disney animated features that have been released since ""The Lion King."""
915;"Many have said that ""The Lion King"" was the last great film of the Disney Renaissance that supposedly started with ""The Little Mermaid."""
916;Mulan is a prime example.
917;"The story is powerful, emotional, and more real than anything Disney feature animation has tackled before, except maybe ""Pocahontas."""
918;The film envelopes you in ancient Chinese culture, the music is fantastic, and the characters are believable, endearing, and beautifully played by their respective voice talents.
919;Eddie Murphy, of course, is the big name tagged to this feature, playing a role that he seemed to be reprising in Shrek (but he's much funnier here).
920;american actors, from Pat Morita to James Hong, with the beautiful Ming.
921;"Presented in anamorphic widescreen, Disc One features an informative audio commentary with directors and producer that gives you insight into the depths to which the filmmakers went to make ""Mulan"" culturally accurate."
922;"It also holds a Disneypedia Activity, a ""Fun Facts"" clip, and a nice collection of deleted scenes that include a cut song for Mushu."
923;"Disc One also has a collection of preview trailers for upcoming Disney releases, naturally, and a special ""Mulan 2"" sneak peak."
924;"There's also a ""Music and More"" section that provides us with 4 music videos."
925;Both make for some darn good tunes and interesting visuals.
926;This makes for interesting entertainment for us Chan fans.
927;It's definitely one of the best moments in the film (though there are many great moments).
928;"How many recording booth videos is Disney Channel going to make?Disc 2 of the ""Mulan"" 2."
929;"disc Special Edition carries over the ""Music and More"" section for one more video."
930;"We are offered first a section called ""The Journey Begins,"" which includes a look into a trip to China that the filmmakers took for inspiration and preparation, a wonderful recitation (set to artwork) of the poem the film used as a basis, and two early presentation reels."
931;I love to see all the cute artwork of Disney girls evolving into their final forms.
932;There's a featurette on translating the film for the world audience, a multi.
933;language reel, and a publicity art gallery.
934;By sucessful, I mean well done and enjoyable.
935;She wasn't deprived of love, or care, or anything, but she still was motivated to be strong.
936;Mulan was a wonderful movie, especially for young girls, because even though Aurora, Snow White, Ariel, Belle and Pocohantas are good rolemodels, Mulan is more of the 'every girl' .
937;Everyone can see themselves in Mulan.
938;I think that this is one of Disney's best movies, an amazing tribute to the children of America, giving them this opportunity to see History, while watching a fun movie.
939;Growing up this was one of my favorite Disney movies.
940;mulan is the only child of her mother and father, and as a girl, it is up to her to make a good match and marry well to bring her family honor.
941;mulan is a strong female character.
942;Although Shang is a pretty neat guy himself, and seems dedicated to the work he is doing.
943;Her friends are pretty goofy and provide comic relief.
944;And all of the voice actors were spot on in this movie, I thought the voices fit well to the characters.
945;"this movie is very colorful and I like that
946;Picking the story of Mulan to use, was as I said before, a brilliant stroke by Disney to get a strong character out there.
947;It was a neat story and watching Mulan grow during it was fun too.
948;the music was fantastic in this movie.
949;I can honestly say I know all the words to all the songs and was singing along to it.
950;There's just something catchy about them, especially the """"I'll make a man out of you"""" song."""
951;Regardless, the composers did a good job on this one.
952;great movie, one of my favorites of the Disney line up.
953;Fantastic characters, fabulous music, and a good story.
954;Well worth watching by the entire family.
955;Mulan is a wonderful movie, with a strong role model for girls, excellent music and animation.
956;and then there's Jackie Chan singing!
957;An excellent choice for your child, that won't make you cringe.
958;Mixing CGI and hand drawn animation, Disney bring us one of it's greatest animated films, 'Mulan' is better than half the live action films that have come out in the last 10 years.
959;Beautiful animation, exciting action sequences and an wonderful story make this a must see!
960;The battle on the snow covered mountains in breathtaking and reminded me of one of Frank Frazetta's paintings.
961;Most everything works in this film and Eddie Murphy provides a memorable character as Mushu the dragon in this exciting adventure movie.
962;This is probabily the second best film in the world.
963;The songs are all really catchy and the animation is spectacular.
964;Mulan shows that duty, honor and love of family and country, are very important.
965;The fact that Mulan grows from an insecure clumsy and demure girl, to the hero of China, is a great story in its unfolding.
966;I love the artistry of the film and how all the backgrounds and nature look like Asian watercolor artwork.
967;"The music is great, especially ""Reflection"" (the radio version of this song put Christina Aguilera's name on the map), and is beautifully sung by Broadway star Leah Salonga."
968;Donny Osmond also has a great song and many of the characters are voiced by popular Asian actors.
969;This is a very fine film and very underrated in the Disney array of animated features.
970;Perhaps an African heroine, or a Japanese heroine.
971;It's a great action Disney movie.
972;Not the best, but well done.
973;Excellant music I loved Eddie Murphy's character.
974;Plus it is funny and a good movie.
975;I loved how fast I received the movie, I couldnt have been happier to have received it.
976;Mulan 2 I had hoped to be with abit more action and exciting and so as the 1st one.
977;This movie is more about for little girls who dream of love and adventure.
978;Just thought id drop this in.
979;This is a gift so it hasn't been opened yet.
980;It is new and our granddaughter loves this character.
981;We're sure that she'll love it.
982;Well children cause my children and I love it.
983;BUT for me it's a strong and courageous story, in which a young woman realizes that she has to assume responsibility for her family!Mulan is now a young woman it's time to be a wife.
984;The matchmaker tells her that she will never bring her family honor.
985;In boot camp, she's learning to fit in with the other soldiers.
986;as they come face to face with The Huns we see as they work as a team.
987;this is such a powerful story filled with determination not to mention the vibrant colors.
988;realistic animation featured in other non.
989;Enemy pure evil, good guy totally pure and innocent, and the little smart.
990;We like the show and the kids enjoyed watching.
991;It's nice to have this option to access movies, but.
992;Mulan is a great film to demonstrate a woman's ability to overcome cultural stereotypye of inferiority.
993;I saw this movie many years ago when it came to the theaters and I loved it.
994;Now that I have children, I found that they enjoy as much as I did.
995;i loved it 3 amazing cheap too.
996;This has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time!I love that Mulan isn't afraid to be herself and fight for her family.
997;Definitely a movie that I will encourage my future daughters to watch.
998;Mulan is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen.
999;The story is wonderful, the songs are beautiful, and even though I'm 15 i still can't get enough disney.
1000;"I love the songs ""Be a Man"" and ""Reflection."""
1001;Let's face it, I'm a hopeless romantic, and this movie has a love story, action, music.
1002;This is one of our all time favorite Disney movies.
1003;great story, great soundtrack, and really funny.
1004;highly recommended for all ages.
1005;Disney hit all the right notes with this delightful film about courage, empowerment, and believing in yourself.
1006;Every time this film comes on (usually the Disney Channel) I curl up on the sofa and have a delightful time with this adventure of Mulan.
1007;Great entertaining movie for kids and family alike.
1008;it kept my 3 year old so engross the whole time .
1009;And its much better than watching some of the other cartoons out there.
1010;disc Special Edition)(1998) Excellent movie.
1011;I got it for a 10 year old Chinese newcomer who is having difficulty learning English.
1012;Mulan is definitely my kind of girl.
1013;He is hilarious, kind of makes you want to hug him tight.
1014;This movie is about honor and self respect.
1015;It is perhaps the most adult movie I have seen in years.
1016;mulan is a movie you can enjoy at every level.
1017;It is intellectully exciting as well as plain entertainment.
1018;Mulan is about love, honor and integrety.
1019;The movie understands its own message.
1020;Fella's, watch this movie with your girlfriend.
1021;Mulan is a strong female character, and I appreciate that the movie introduces them to a tiny bit of traditional Chinese culture.
1022;Arrived nicely and safely packaged.
1023;Also arrived early and that is quite a bonus!!!
1024;We enjoyed this move (12 y. o. daughter and mom).
1025;It has a good moral and kept us entertained throughout.
1026;An animated cartoon by Disney that deals with a serious theme.
1027;Murphy is amazing as the Dragon's voice.
1028;I got it for my Grand Daughter and she likes it, what more is there to say than it's her favorite movie.
1029;overall, I love this movie.
1030;The excellent choice of animated colors, the touching story full of love, heroism, friendship, humor, family, war, patriotism, etc.
1031;ALL in this one movie!
1032;This can easily bring tears to your eyes.
1033;this film is extremely well crafted.
1034;The weasely snitch from the royal court is extremely well done.
1035;I found it to be a highly entertaining, and at times moving, film.
1036;It is a great movie.
1037;This video is one of the best movies from Disney, my wife loved it and my babies loved it as well
1038;I got this as a gift and when given it was not in English and had no way if changing it to English.
1039;I am very upset but this and the person this gift was for was so heartbroken!
1040;The story line is good and contains humourous situations.
1041;I find it good for families to enjoy the movie together.
1042;you'll love this one, about a Chinese girl who joins the army to fight maurading Huns.
1043;Despite what others may say, the songs are terrific .
1044;it's for the whole family.
1045;But this one's worth it.
1046;This was a good movie worth seeing.
1047;With Eddie Murphy doing the voice of a major character, it is good watch for adults too.
1048;Mulan tries her best to always do the right thing and succeeds in the end.
1049;A lot of humor along the way with some really good songs.
1050;its fun, shows girls can do anything a boy can do, and supports rebelling lol.
1051;I just love this movie.
1052;"There's something about this movie that gives you sort of a ""Girls can do anything!"""
1053;The characters were very likable, and I didn't find myself rolling my eyes or nearly gagging at any of them.
1054;"But back on the subject of ""Mulan"", it was a funny, well."
1055;While I can deal with that on a certain level, I love being able to watch this with her and talk about how Mulan saved China and that a girl can be as smart, and smarter, than boys.
1056;she's smart and she's a hero.
1057;My daughter loves this movie and I'm happy to have her watch it.
1058;taking scenes, the amazing (and that's amazing, not really catchy and annoying like Disney has been putting out) songs, and how funny it was.
1059;Eddie Murphy was so hilarious.
1060;and you really have to listen, because the humor can be subtle.
1061;This is one of my favorite Disney movies.
1062;It has a great story line, tons of comedy, and is very entertaining.
1063;It's also a great movie for both girls and boys.
1064;Love this movie I can watch it over and over again.
1065;One of my all time favorite Disney movies.
1066;As the 36th animated masterpiece, this has to be the funniest movie yet.
1067;mulan is extremely beautiful and her facial expressions make you actually feel everything she is feeling emotionally.
1068;Her lovable and tenacious spirit is admirable.
1069;She also seems to always be getting into trouble and the slapstick humor is the best I have ever seen in a Disney movie.
1070;Mulan trains for war and proves herself quite capable of learning martial arts and excelling at all areas of military training.
1071;the movie has a rather ominous beginning, a hilarious center and a memorable ending.
1072;It is just perfect to say the least.
1073;the main point to the movie is to allow children to become the person they are inside.
1074;To nurture their true gifts and to give them unconditional love.
1075;johann Christoph ArnoldIn the Chinese culture, honor is very important, so this aspect is very prominent throughout the movie.
1076;In a way, it could help a child to realize that it is fine to be proud of your country.
1077;Many Chinese traditions and symbols are incorporated into the movie making it a spectacularly beautiful movie.
1078;A must see for all ages!
1079;Mulan is a special movie that I've always enjoyed.
1080;The movie it self worth 5 stars, and top of that comes with some unique extra such as first time disney has madarin audio, is very good actually, i think is better in my option, jackien chan as shang and li coco as mulan is really a good combination cast.
1081;not only had the American had done a good job of making a beautiful and educational cartoon.
1082;they had also bring the chinese legend to life to the world.
1083;we had see a whole new disney in a complete new direction and refreshing way.
1084;MULAN is another good animation from the DISNEY studios.
1085;it's not one of my favorites, but is nice with great graphics and beautiful songs!
1086;Inspirational story with a lot of humor dispersed throughout.
1087;Thematic topics include family unity, working hard and fighting for what is important.
1088;Kids were enhralled and would easily watch again or recommend it to their friends.
1089;"Their comments included: ""I liked learning about the Chinese culture and I'd like to go there someday."""
1090;Mulan was strong and brave.
1091;this is the story of a young woman who unintentionally but through necessity faces prejudice and danger head on, and wins.
1092;strung spirit obviously makes her ill.
1093;beautiful landscapes and detail of traditional Chinese armor and clothing, several humorous situations [though Disney really should decide whether they are making a family movie or an adult one.
1094;Many other Mulan scenes are equally exciting, but this is the one that most comes to my mind.
1095;though the story slows down a little in the middle, it's an exciting adventure, with a wide range of colorful supporting characters [including the strong and extremely handsome young man who ends up falling in love with her, for those hopeless romantics out there], and a real mean [but not TOO mean] bad guy.
1096;all in all, MY favorite Disney movie.
1097;It is a lovely movie but my little girl has a hard time enjoying it.
1098;it is such a good movie.
1099;This is definently a movie that adults as well as kids can enjoy because of the subtle connections to real life events.
1100;Thankfully, Disney resumed to top.
1101;famous magic of their real classics.
1102;The animation and sound are fine as they should be and the mountain pass scenes are really cool, especially the part where the huge Mongol hoard comes charging down towards the protagonists in an endless wave of cavalry.
1103;"The main musical theme ""Reflections"" is also well written and expresses Mulan's feelings and desires with emotion."
1104;"Gaston, Jafar, and Ursula are much more interesting villains.2) Mulan's romantic partner is kind of a ""himbo""."
1105;Which leads to my next issue:3) In the other great Disney features, the lead and their romantic interest share in the resolution of their conflicts and defeat the villian as part of the resolution of the conflict in their romance.
1106;Ariel and Eric battle Ursula as part of the romantic conflict brought on by the fact that he is human and she is a mermaid.
1107;He still risks his life fighting Ursula together with Ariel.
1108;It just gets OK'd in the end because she saves the emperor.
1109;so, overall I liked the movie, but I didn't love it.
1110;The comic relief is way over.
1111;The only gem is Jerry Goldsmith's epic score, it makes Alan Menken's music look like amatuer's night.
1112;Updating our VHS version of the Disney movies for our grandson to enjoy.
1113;It was so very good.
1114;The Special Features are outstanding.
1115;The making of Mulan was exceptional.
1116;My granddaughter who is 3 loves this movie .
1117;I watch it all the time with her and it has become my favorite disney movie.
1118;My grandson who is 10 loves to watch it with her.
1119;He loves to ask me about the history of the Huns and the life of the Chinese people.
1120;This movie is entertaining as well as educational.
1121;This is byfar the best movie and worth the money.
1122;The music, action, story, and comedy are uplifting, positive, and.
1123;cracking dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy, is an incredible asset to the story.
1124;He's the sophomoric sidekick, the comic relief.
1125;Murphy really is the right voice here.
1126;this movie should be required viewing by all who think women should be kept in their place.
1127;I know my daughter loved it.
1128;It was a gift for her and it arrived right on time.
1129;I know she watched it right away.
1130;My family watched it all together and it was so funny and cute yet showed a good moral.
1131;best movie of all time!
1132;Funny, daring, exciting, it has everything.
1133;This movie is great for the kids and the whole family.
1134;com I thought maybe I'll check it out.
1135;This is probably one of my favorite Disney movies.
1136;I love when Disney has a sense of humor and you can clearly see it in this one.
1137;This movie is really good for all ages!
1138;I work in a daycare and my children love watching this movie!
1139;Advised for all Disney movie lovers!
1140;One of my all time favorite movies!
1141;this is a fantastic movie, older ones are better after all.
1142;Mulan was a good character, full of animation and beauty.
1143;She was a good person and was learning a lot by her experiences but she didn't understand some things which her father tried to teach her.
1144;A good movie, some of the scenes would have been better without Mushu talking about spit shines and stuff like that.
1145;My granddaughter (13) and I (61) both love this movie.
1146;The story line is inspirational, believable, and humorous and can be appreciated by people of all ages.
1147;My kids (4 and 7 years old) watch it again and again!Perfect for all ages!
1148;and I love the feminist message.
1149;I have always loved Milan an I was glad I could see it once more for a low price I wish it was free then I'd really love it
1150;Disney got it right with their re.
1151;Sidekicks are a little cheesy, but the main characters are handled well.
1152;all this makes for a rocking good time with Mulan.
1153;You get a truly independent and proactive female lead, and a genie.
1154;There's actually a nice sense of danger and tension in the mountain scenes, with some excellent computer work to show a huge invading army.
1155;Fun songs keep the movie light where appropriate, and the whole project has a .
1156;more mature edge while remaining strictly Disney and family.
1157;Also of interest is a Jackie Chan music video from the overseas promotions.
1158;The guy's English may not be so great, but he sings all the ending themes to his own movies in Hong Kong, and has a good voice when he's in his element.
1159;It is definitely one of the better contemporary Disney films and is entertaining for adults too :)
1160;This is my all time favourite in Disney movies!
1161;I laughed through the entire movie, even more than my then six year old sister, which is actually pretty embarrassing considering it is a cartoon.
1162;Though I think this is not one directed just at children, it's directed at the more mature audience as well.
1163;A true family movie for any age.
1164;Bought this as a present for my best friend.
1165;She was a girl living in China, life was already hard for her.
1166;model, and I love to show this movie to my daughter and son to show them and let them know, what we wouldn't do for the people we love.
1167;This film is one of my very favorite Disney films, brimming with memorably catchy songs and stunning visuals.
1168;The storyline is usual Disney fare at heart, but one must realize that it is indeed a children's film.
1169;But Mulan's story is filled with messages of honor, strength, the importance of family, brotherhood, and love.
1170;It is s a film filled with humor, color, music, and values.
1171;I have 2 little girls and it was refreshing to let them watch a movie that was beyond the standard princess fare.
1172;like `Pocahontas' this film has a female protagonist and she is as independent and free spirited.
1173;this film has some nice touches and is animated very well.
1174;The voice cast is very good and the music isn't too saccharine or cheesy either.
1175;kick), find love and learn lessons and then they come home to a big happy ending family reunion.
1176;There may be slight deviations from this from film to film, but this is generally how they tend to go and it is a formula that works.
1177;all in all I enjoyed this film, maybe more so than the previously mentioned `Pocahontas', and whilst it was relatively short, it was entertaining for the duration.
1178;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
1179;Initially that was so because of the empowering message it has for females, but it is also a very watchable movie.
1180;It's entertaining and very well done.
1181;You can really tell that the people making it put thought and effort into it, and weren't just trying to dash off a quick buck.
1182;out scenes, and in general the storytelling is skillfull and economical.
1183;The musical scenes are all fabulous, and there's something really special about Mulan's 'reflection' song.
1184;"There are some very interesting ""the making of"" extras, as well as an ultra."
1185;"cool version of the ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"" song, which switches from language to language as the song progresses, yet still sounds smooth."
1186;this movie has a really special place in my heart, despite not being the best of all Disney movies.
1187;Very good movie for families and one that you can watch more than once and enjoy.
1188;Just in time because it was a gift for a bday
1189;Excellent movie for the entire family, account handled quickly and shipped in excellent condition and on time.
1190;Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and the Lion King all has much better songs than this.
1191;And the emperor wants one man from every family to sign up.
1192;So she secrtly takes her father's place.
1193;And thier choice is a big dragon.
1194;Of course the songs are worth singing to.
1195;tested combination of a strong heroine, amusing animal sidekicks, and bumbling supporting characters works well enough once more to provide a good time.
1196;Soon Mulan is thrust into the heat of battle but with the help of a lucky cricket, a dragon named Mushu (Eddie Murphy), and some colorful comrades.
1197;arms, she manages to save the kingdom, preserve her family's honor, and find true love.
1198;Yet, the positives outweigh the negatives in the final count: the animation is great, Murphy provides ample comic relief, the film moves at a brisk pace, and Mulan herself is vividly defined.
1199;Certainly the Chinese heroine makes a worthy addition to Disney's honor roll of characters.
1200;In a world where violence is so prevalent, Mulan is a refreshing change.
1201;It is also great that my daughter can see a heroine with the same color skin as she and the same slanted eyes that she has.
1202;Congrats Disney for such a fine film.
1203;With Mulan, Disney has come up with as flawless an animated film as can be.
1204;All the characters are well.
1205;The music is excellent, the songs are appropriate and the storyline is very plausible.
1206;It is one movie which I enjoy a lot, inspite of the fact that I am not a child anymore.
1207;One of my favorite Disney movies.
1208;This movie is timeless and enjoyable for almost anyone.
1209;Mulan is definitely worth watching and re.
1210;THis is a great movie for young or old girls to see a female take charge!
1211;enjoyable and overall great movie.
1212;"Mulan's ""Special Edition"" got basically the same treatment that The Lion King's ""Platinum Edition"" got ."
1213;I wouldn't have even spent money, but the transfer is top notch, in anamorphic widescreen, and that was worth the $10 I was able to get it for at Wal Mart.
1214;It's the only version of the movie in print, and rightfully so as the picture and sound are top notch.
1215;Be a Man) witty lines, especially from Mushu, a heroine who can fight and be tough and isn't sickeningly good, some pretty tough scenes, like the destroyed village, and good drawing which looks sort of Chinese but also realistic.
1216;I knew nothing about the original Mulan story so can't say how it fares in that respect, but as a Disney movie it's great .
1217;mouth, which is somewhat nice.
1218;However, the film still has its high points, as I said, the animation is elaborate and sharp and the music is pretty cool (Except for when Raven sings in some of the bonuses, ugh!)
1219;I haven't seen Mulan since I was little but it is still one of my favorites.
1220;She sat and watched very quietly for the first 45 minutes (she's two) and continues to want to watch it.
1221;My students learned so much about ancient China from viewing this film!
1222;This is yet another Disney favorite of mine.
1223;mulan is a story about a Chinese girl,destined to be settled down with the man,as is her custom,and to bring honor to her family.
1224;Along with a lot of humor.
1225;another film excellent of it's Gold status!
1226;Still enjoyable but the family and the reduced resolution kinda made it feel like an oldtime movie.
1227;Sound was still great and really took us back!!!
1228;This may be one of the best Disney movies.
1229;Great message for both girls and boys without being preachy or overtly politically correct.
1230;I believe that this is one of my favorite Disney movies.
1231;This is remarkably unselfish because if she's discovered she will be killed.
1232;This shows how much she loves her dear old dad.
1233;"The songs are amazing (""I'll make a man out of you"" Donny Osmond's voice is fantastic)."
1234;The extra features were also pretty good.
1235;The animation is great as it shows a lot of the natural beauty of China.
1236;I also think the character of the little dragon who earns his way back into an honored place amongst the honored ancestors is a great character and a good lesson about quick thinking, perseverance, and determination.
1237;I like this movie and I'm glad my 4 year old granddaughter loves it, even if she's moved on to Peter Pan after watching this one more times than I can count.
1238;There is lots to love about Mulan.
1239;A wonderful score, great animation, lots of good vocal talent.
1240;Childhood favorite with fun songs and a powerful story of family, gender roles, and the heart of a young one!
1241;A strong heroine, comedic relief (provided by Eddie Murphy and Harvey Fiernstein) and a powerful film score (Jerry Goldsmith) combine to make this the most thrilling Disney movie since Hunchback.
1242;It's great to have when you are traveling or anytime.
1243;mulan is smart, tough, loves her family and is a little bit rebellious.
1244;this is one of the most watchable and most fun of all the Disney cartoons (ok, Lion King might be better taken on the whole, but.
1245;I know I will in future.
1246;This is a great movie.
1247;She is such a strong character.
1248;I love the special edition, which includes a bonus disc featuring how the movie was made, a segment about the music and much more.
1249;Mulan is one of the finest Disney movies ever produced.
1250;"I have yet to disagree with Disney on any of their choices for ""Platinum"" or ""Special Edition"" releases."
1251;screen always gives you MORE picture.
1252;It's extremely important to know the bars on the top and bottom are UNUSED space.
1253;I have viewed this disc up.
1254;This is the ratio for other films like Aladdin and The Lion King.
1255;the bonus features are very good.
1256;"A wealth of material is presented on both Disc 1 and 2, making this truly worthy of the title ""Special Edition""."
1257;THis film has it all.
1258;And in particular the plot and story are wonderfully told.
1259;And the relationship between father and daughter is particularly poignant.
1260;A great gift for a father to give his daughter.
1261;I loved this film and have watched with my daughter over and over again.
1262;one of my all time disney favorites.
1263;I am a very big fan of Walt Disney movies.
1264;I just saw this one and I love it!I cried in one scene.
1265;Every Disney movie has one character who makes us laugh.
1266;This one made me laugh very hard.
1267;This is a brilliant movie!
1268;"I love this movie
1269;Thanks again and hope to do more business with you in the future
1270;The movie is absolutely amazing!
1271;The visuals are stunning, the music is incredible and the story line is the best Disney has done.
1272;The fact that Mulan is not a 'typical' Disney princess makes me enjoy this movie.
1273;The gang of three provide the right amount of humor.
1274;What's best about this movie?
1275;Mulan proves herself to be a hero by using her brain and her wits, not her feminine charms!
1276;This is one of my most favorite Disney movies and a woman as the hero, way to go Disney.
1277;It is nice to reminiscent on real classics and to show my niece what a animated movie must be like, two bird with one stone
1278;Mulan is one Disney Princess great stories, some familiar voices are used in the movie which makes it easy for the whole family to enjoy.
1279;and over again with my four year old.
1280;I still enjoy it every time I see it!
1281;The smarts and courage of this young woman make for a truly enjoyable experience.
1282;Even though the songs are not that catchy, this film is among the greatest children's movies.
1283;This is a truly excellent movie.
1284;It shows humor with Eddie Murphy as Mushu, courage with the story, well depicted chinese history, as well as girl power.
1285;This movie is a disney classic, right up there with Fantasia and Aladdin and all those others.
1286;depicted Hercules, and just makes you want to smile, cry, laugh or sing along with the characters.
1287;I give this movie a million thumbs up!
1288;Mulan has got to be one of the best disney (or even not disney) films out there.
1289;It is full of themes such as love, courage, persistence, ambition, piety, and many others that can captivate not only a child, but an adult as well.
1290;Mulan goes through difficult stages of life, which force her her grow and learn, as this wonderful film takes you along for a journey of personal growth of your own.
1291;i would recommend this film to people of all ages!
1292;Great for boys and girls!
1293;Great picture, Great sound, I was amazed that a movie can look as good as does on the big screen.
1294;I also loved having a movie time with my granddaughter and watching a girl be the hero.
1295;She loved this movie and I take it as a hit when she yells hold it grandma so she can scramble off the couch and get a drink and not want to miss a minute.
1296;Well we own the movie and we have seen it over and over and its great to have Mulan on our movie list.
1297;mulan is an old tale set back in yesteryear with dragons and spirits.
1298;It gives them a sense of fantasy.
1299;For me, if there are songs that you can sing to during the movie, it makes the movie so much more fun.
1300;There are a number of sing.
1301;along songs that will keep your youngsters' attention.
1302;I recommend it for everyone.
1303;I love that Mulan is an assertive protagonist who is motivated by love of family and country.
1304;I laugh every time I watch this movie as well!
1305;Disney has done it again: transforming a wonderful legend into a pointless and silly comedy.
1306;My 3yr old grandson absolutely loves this movie.
1307;The music and songs were fantastic.
1308;and it was wonderful to see a """"Disney Princess"""" without a tiara :) Keep up the great movie making."""
1309;mulan proves to be the perfect herion.
1310;Beautiful background and the computer graphix, the story proved that you can do anything if you try.
1311;and Mulan is a perfect model for kids grownups and yes even Teens.
1312;I suggest that you see this inspirational movie and judge it for yourselves.
1313;It's still so moving and refreshing.
1314;It is one of the classic you can count on.
