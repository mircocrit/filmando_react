id;spiegazione
1;A great movie that's not afraid to show the dark side of people.
2;Another great movie.You just have got to love the characters.
3;helen Hunt is great, albeit a bit arrogant.
4;jack Nicholson is at his neurotic best.
5;one of the best movies of the last 10 years!
6;Calling this fantastic film a romantic comedy is misleading because it is so much better than what we typically label as romantic comedy.
7;Helen Hunt is fantastic as the nice waitress to Mr. Mean Jack Nicholson who gives a stellar performance as a sharp tongued obsessive compulsive unable to find any joy in life.
8;Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr. also do a great job in this film.
9;Well sure enough, I found that I now like a third Jack Nicholson movie and yes.
10;Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear were great in their respective parts, but Jack carried the day.
11;so maybe there is hope.
12;if you are looking for a great movie this month, then this is As Good As It Gets .
13;Great Actors ~ Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear ~ An Excellent movie which can be watched many more times than once.
14;Arrived on time as always with Amazon!
15;and that line encapsulates the story, which is essentially the story of an incredibly interesting, accomplished, and intelligent man who's fears dominate him to such an extent that the viewer sees the exact opposite through most of the film.
16;when introduced
17;and to that class of people, who have yet to see this film, count yourself lucky, it's a beautiful comedy about love, and it's power to help man triumph over fear.
18;It's one of the few in my collection that I frequently watch and enjoy.
19;I loved this movie though the acting was supurb i loved it, because it teaches a good moral leason on life.
20;The movie is one of the best and should be seen by all.
21;Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Cuba Gooding Jr and Greg Kennear are phenomenal in this classic masterpiece of a man's journey to find love.
22;100% entertainment and pure gold, academy award and golden globe winner, this movie is great.
23;James L. Brooks's quirky, touching film brims with humanity, as three societal misfits find each other and against steep odds, ultimately connect.
24;Nicholson fits oddball Melvin like a defective glove, but it's Oscar winner Helen Hunt who steals the film as the beleaguered, world.
25;An unlikely romance with a big heart, this gem truly lives up to its title.
26;I don't think there's another actor out there who could have pulled this performance off!Combine Jack with a great cast, and side spltting story, and you have this outstanding comedy!Bravo!
27;Plenty o' pathos, a wonderful exploration of the human condition, Jack.
28;As Good as Gets .
29;Greg Kinnear is easily my personal favorite character, he seems to be the most pure and knowledgeable of the lot.
30;The film has it's flaws, but is very entertaining.
31;It takes a lot of will.
32;power to overcome it, and it was not taken advantage of.
33;The film as a whole is also delightful.
34;Nothing but pure enjoyment here.
35;Kinear was touching and graceful and yes should have recieved the oscar but Nicholson was pure genius.
36;He played one of the most difficult roles in history to perfection.
37;I was never a Nichoslon fan until I saw this movie (the only other thing I saw him in was that piece of sh*t, A Few Good Men) but this performance compelled me to follow up one his acting and now I am convinced he is one the the greatest film actors ever.
38;This is a perfect movie.
39;In my lifetime, I have seen maybe four or five perfect movies.
40;A perfect movie is one that could not have been better than it is.
41;Even if you dislike romantic comedy, you will like this.
42;They each won Academy Awards for this and deservedly so.
43;This is a very sweet movie about a man.
44;There is a lot more in the story then that.
45;I recommend it to any one who likes a romance movie with a little more things thrown in.
46;This is by far the best romantic comedy I have ever seen, and I admit being a guy I haven't really seen that many.
47;The thing that seperates this film from most is the power to make you bust out in laughter one second and wiping away tears the next.
48;Jack Nicholson delivers my favorite performance of his career and deserved that Oscar, as did Helen Hunt in her best role.
49;I truly think Greg Kinnear deserved the Oscar over Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting.
50;Jack was weirdly great, but Kinnear was so convincing as the soul of the movie, who helped mold others around him rather than changing himself or his past.
51;Also, this movie has almost as many great quotes as Monty Python or the Princess Bride and thats really saying something.
52;untell now i didnt see one like this moive , all the time when i miss it in return and see it , Jack Nicholson every time i see him in this moive i see something new he do in this and also Helen Hunt this is the best i think moive for her .
53;Well, if it has superb acting and an original script, then it is As Good as it Gets .
54;This movie surprises and entertains throughout.
55;As Good as it Gets has a wonderfully original script.
56;The three primary players gel into a perfect team.
57;It is pure comic genius on a very human level.
58;But you have to see for yourself.
59;You may just find yourself a new favorite Romantic Comedy.
60;directed by James L. Brooks (Co. creator of The Simpsons) brings a smart entertaining comedy about Changing and Falling in Love for the first time.
61;This film is a fine surprisngly well made dramatic comedy.
62;Jack Nicholson is superb as a obsessive.
63;he happens to be Gay, something Nicholson likes to mock throughout the film.
64;Nicholson even at 60 years old was masterful in his performance.
65;he was funny, mean and creepy but in the end you had to love his character.
66;He won an Oscar and most definitly deserved it.
67;Helen Hunt won an oscar too.
68;it's just a really good movie.
69;so I hope all that read my reviews enjoyed them.
70;I absolutely loved this film.
71;It was sooooo funny too.
72;people who talk in metaphors autta shampoo my crotch , haha, that was a brilliant line, and helarious.
73;Meet the meanest man in town.
74;Overall, just great script, performances, characters.
75;it's touchingFunnyromanticsincerestraightforwardI loved the cam angles and everything about the sets they used to filmThe locations were just marvelousEverything from the diner scenes to the apartmentNice wardrobes were picked out tooMy regards to the stylist tooCunning crafty movie.
76;Besides Kinnear, another outstanding feature of this film is the ease of how it expresses the way women think and feel.
77;Although Jack's final speech to Helen is worded exactly as a woman wants a man to praise her, Jack is able to make it sound spontaneous and masculine.
78;I've only mentioned the 2 things I like best about the film, but it's excellent on all dimensions.
79;It is a cinema classic.
80;Helen Hunt is so sincere, hard, and cute.
81;in this film that reminds me of a Spielberg classic.
82;It plays very well, and the delivery time was quick.
83;I am very pleased with it.
84;all the actors did a great job.
85;well if she wasnt a very good one then why would there be such A demand for her!
86;well i know everyone has there own feelings about this movie but i dont see how anyone could not like it!!
87;it was one of the best movies i have ever seen!
88;well that is just my feeling on the movie!!!
89;There is some kind of unbridgeable cultural social divide between America and the rest of us when it comes to this type of material.
90;worthy over there just strikes the Old World as incredibly yukky and fake.
91;walked through this role
92;That cute little tyke looked female to me, but they kept calling it boy.
93;As Good as It Gets is Funny, insigthful, romantic, .
94;compulsive disorder with a morally.
95;The most appealing aspect of the movie is the realization that through a true connection with another person ('love') and/or the simple acknoledgement of an individual's humanity, one maybe empowered with the necessary inner.
96;This movie is famous for the performance of both Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson, including his line  You make me want to be a better man, which is a turning point in the movie when Jack's character undergoes a Self.
97;Now finally having done so, I have to wonder what all the fuss was about.
98;luck artist and his dog.
99;Mr. Udall (Nicholson) was indeed a brave soul for putting on a necktie and pursuing her.
100;If you can spare 3 or 4 hours (well, it seemed that long), see the movie yourself.
101;you were sublime in this one!
102;(script director huge help, as well.)
103;Granted, Kinear's performance is the best of his career thus far, and Nicholson is always a delight, and his Melvin manages to be repulsive and endearing at the same time.
104;Helen Hunt's performance was inexplicably Oscar.
105;worthy, and I wasn't as impressed with her as the other two leads.
106;But when Jack finds himself across the street from a construction site, a crafty look passes over his face.
107;His eyebrows go up and he gets that devilish look.
108;He crosses the street at a jaunty pace, whistling a tune.
109;For those of you who wondered enough to read other reviews to find out what kind of dog Verdell is: He is a BRUSSELS GRIFFON, a rare European breed that will cost you dearly.
110;I really believed that this was going to be a poor movie, but after seeing it 5 years after it came to theaters, I loved it!
111;Makes for a weird plot, but it is a great story, and in the end, it has some great plot twists.
112;The neighbor of the gay man, well played by Jack Nicholson, who must watch his neighbor's dog while he was in the hospital after being beaten up.
113;It sparks a set of events, sometimes hilarious, sometimes very sad.
114;I bought this film, thinking it would be an interesting insight into the world of an obsessive compulsive, played by Jack Nicholson.
115;I know I certainly do.
116;It also funnily enough starred Jack Nicholson, and was basically the same plot and same characters .
117;And he comes out with some absolutely classic lines!
118;Or, if it's election night, and you're excited and you wanna celebrate because some fudgepacker that you date has been elected the first queer president of the United States and he's going to have you down to Camp David, and you want someone to share the moment with.
119;Melvin: I tell you, buddy.
120;I'd be the luckiest man alive if that did it for me.
121;Receptionist: How do you write women so well?
122;Melvin: I think of a man, and I take away reason and accountability.
123;How much more you got to eat?
124;Just what the world needs, another actress.
125;OK, maybe I overdid it with the classic lines, but that's the only reason why the film is so good.
126;I rather liked all of the actors, especially Nicholson.
127;I'd have to watch it again to tell you exactly what.
128;My nitpicking is probably due to being the son of a psychology major.
129;all they need is the right motivation, which I disagree with.
130;Nicholson overcomes his fear because he's in love.
131;Nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, As Good As It Gets became one of the surprise blockbusters of 1997.
132;Helen Hunt is masterful in her portrayal of a hard.
133;luck single mother who befriends Nicholson's oddball character, and Greg Kinnear does well as the neighbor who faces hard times himself.
134;written screenplay exhibiting superb direction from James L. Brooks, As Good As It Gets makes a place for itself in the annals of movie history.
135;co. stars Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt swept the leading role Oscars for the male and female categories, and their onscreen relationship is one of the more memorable in cinema history.
136;More than able to meet the task, Nicholson, Hunt, and Kinnear strike gold with this Best Picture candidate which combines drama and comedy into a unique, one.
137;And with Kinnear and Hunt to bring a serious note to Nicholson's strange character, As Good As It Gets breaks into the ranks of a short list of all.
138;It's one you definitely won't want to miss.
139;city University?Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear are simply fabulous.
140;Actually the whole cast is very very good.
141;person can make other unhappy people happy.
142;(The difference is, however, that the good fairy and the prince is the same person in the modern versions).
143;But the level of understanding of human nature demonstrated by James L. Brooks is simply amazing and incomparable.
144;But the most interesting thing for me about this movie is how people react when you say something to them (not necessarily shocking or negative).
145;from time to time you really need to watch something that touches your soul.
146;actually I love this movie so much that I want to see a sequel!
147;I want to see these actors together again at lakes with boats and friends eating noodle salad!
148;The fact that Jack Nicholson won an Oscar for this movie just goes to show that the Oscars are more about who you are and who you know than any real acting prowess.
149;cool self, with the addition of opening and closing some doors more times than is necessary.
150;if you want to see great acting of mental issues, see the movie 'Niagara, Niagara' and, though not as well.
151;acted, but much more recent, 'Real Time'.
152;Don't get me wrong
153;I think that the director, James Brooks, did a wonderful job of casting Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson as the two love leads.
154;The love relationship in this movie was not about chemistry between the actors
155;I will be watching this movie many more times in order to experience the drama and comedy, and I hope that if you decide to see it, you will enjoy this treat.
156;As Good As It Gets starring Jack Nicholson is the worst movie ever to win an Oscar for best picture.
157;There is furniture in the picture that is more expressive than she is.
158;By the way Nicholson is spectacular as usual.
159;Then if you manage to find love you are perhaps luckiest of all.
160;that being said the film was not interesting or engaging at all.
161;The characters are all cute just not particularly appealing.
162;And the ONLY funny line of the whole movie is when the star eyed young receptionist asks Jack how he writes women so well.
163;Col. You can't handle the truth!
164;Greg Kinnear is sweet as one of the needy triad of Helen Hunt and her son .
165;The end of the movie gives the viewer a crawly feeling.
166;but the overriding thought throughout was, please end.
167;pc flick with Jack well.
168;murderer who fools people into believing what a wonderful person she is.
169;This movie always shows up under the category of comedy.
170;acclaimed and award winning movie that had little entertainment value.
171;Nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, As Good As It Gets became one of the big hits of 1997, as a romantic comedy.
172;Melvin is a very successful novelist who is also a harsh unkind man who is suffering from severe obsessive.
173;Melvin being obsessive pays the bills for Carol's son to have better doctors and treatment, so that she can come back to work.
174;compulsive character this movie is one you definitely must see.
175;Plus he make suggestion on his co stars, most of the actors in this movie is in his othermovie where he is the lead actor.
176;Everything about this movie is great,from direction to cast Jack Nicholson,Helen Hunt,Greg Kinnear,Cuba Gooding Jnr and the little dog.
177;A particularly smart/realistic script and character's make this a memorable story that touches the heart about an obsessive/compulsive writer his waitress and bashed/robbed homosexual neighbour and his beloved pet.
178;I thought it was very funny and to make it a whole lot better, my favourite actor is in it, Jack.
179;It was one of his best performances definetly.
180;And I`m in love with Helen Hunt.
181;Little things in ordinary life can inspire a great story.
182;He hopes the rest of the world will lead the way, though.
183;it's possibly a fair statement to say that the theme of this movie is that wounded people can help to heal each other in ways no healthy person ever could but the point of the movie is simply to follow the main character as he learns how to love, something he constantly writes about but knows nothing of.
184;the comedy in this film is hilarious.
185;There is pretty much every type of comedy represented, but a great deal of it stems from sarcasm.
186;cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance is my favorite here because he's just so hard to figure out.
187;But it's a romantic comedy, what else is required?
188;Here we go again, squeeze the middle class guy once again.
189;This is a good movie.
190;Kind of cute, funny and entertaining.
191;This really is as good as it gets when it comes to romantic comedy!
192;While this movie may fall into the sappy category for true film aficionados, it manages to mix wry humor and legitimate drama with enough sentimentality to satisfy even the weepiest movie.
193;Unlike other films of its genre, As Good As It Gets has a point .
194;The fine characterization accomplished by the writers and a superb cast (Helen Hunt
195;If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
196;This film is comforting to some because it glorifies the individual
197;It becomes clear that Melvin loves Carol for, above all, her humanity.
198;Despite its pathos, it at least offers a few laughs and a generally pessimistic protagonist to amuse the cynics.
199;But he also has a well of compassion and the resources to change others' lives.
200;Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. are outstanding, never giving an inch in their loathing of the writer's faults, but open just enough to see that those faults are not the whole picture of the man.
201;Humor and life changing events were great to watch.
202;Greg Kinnear is fantastic as Simon and Jack Nicholson is always good as well as Helen Hunt.
203;It is very intuitive on human nature and how life works!
204;Jack Nicholson and the rest of the cast are just brilliant in these roles!
205;This movie is one of the best that i've seen in awile.
206;The chemistry between Nicholson and Hunt is surperb.
207;As Good as it Gets is a true classic!
208;Thanks for the shipment and great product!
209;My friends and I were discussing the 97 Oscar race, especially the Best Actress race (which always brings heated debate).
210;This year holds one of those lineups that many people look back on with either love or hate.
211;Most of my friends firmly believe that Hunt stole Dench's Oscar.
212;carter is consistently considered great but not the best.
213;for me, this film works because of her delicate yet earnest performance.
214;She really captures everything that her character is experiencing, as a mother, as a woman.
215;She exposes her character's brittle emotional composure without losing the strength that she has to maintain.
216;Her character's yearning to find peace, pleasure and companionship is so believable, and so sincere
217;Sure, she has her moments where you can tell she is `trying', but it is saved by her genuine approach to the character's entire persona.
218;The script is generic at best (it is better than `Good Will Hunting's script, but that isn't saying much), but it is the earnest performances that really carry the film.
219;Hunt and Kinnear (such a layered and heartfelt performance) are fantastic, and while Nicholson is undoubtedly phoning this in (as many have mentioned, he could do this in his sleep), his chemistry with Hunt is sensational.
220;I consider him one of the finest actors to ever grace the screen, and I devour almost every film he's in.
221;He has given this performance in a slew of films.
222;and so, while he is effective, his performance is far from noteworthy.
223;His Oscar win was a bit too much, especially since Duvall, Damon and Hoffman were all better in their respective roles.
224;This may not be as good as it gets, but it's still very good.
225;See it, The love it.
226;this movie is so great.
227;everyone should see this movie at least once.
228;As Good as It Gets is as good as it gets.
229;It's Nicholson at his finest, surrounded by a strong cast.
230;Jack Nicholson in one of his best parts.
231;Even at that point I had laughed more and cried more than I do in the bulk of films and besides which, I was having a brilliant time.
232;the dialogue is so witty that you want to hear most of it again immediately.
233;The characters are all so real that it felt like I was living in their neighborhood.
234;It must also be said that the casting was inspired.
235;It is only fate and the love of a woman that enables him to start lowering his shield of obnoxiousness.
236;Carol Connerly, played skillfully by Helen Hunt, is a martyr to her son's asthma.
237;has been going on for a long time and we can see it has reached a plateau.
238;luckily Melvin is able to be intimidated by Frank, (which is fun for the audience), into taking care of Verdell while Simon is in the hospital.
239;He is the perfect pet for a meticulous, antisocial writer like Melvin.
240;This small dog is quiet, polite, sensitive and cute.
241;so without giving away the whole story I will sum up by saying As Good As It Gets is a very special film.
242;It will touch you and make your life better, if only for a couple of hours.
243;Looking back on the 1997 Academy Awards, it still makes me sick that Titanic won best picture.
244;Far better than that film that should have sank like the ship it was named for, As Good As It Gets is wihtout a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
245;this film is one of the true films in cinema that can be considered perfect.
246;The writing is on the money, the directing is excellent and all the performances were top notch (Nicholson and Hunt deserved their Oscars, and Kinear and Gooding were great as well).
247;The audio comentary was good (it was nice to hear the somewhat reclusive Nicholson offer his intake), and the film is a true must have movie.
248;This is a great movie.
249;I had seen it before when it first came out, but missed so many nuisances I saw this time, A great feel good story.
250;The main actors are the best .
251;I have always loved this movie, and watch it at least once a year.
252;Jack Nicholson is a neurotic character in this flick: a role he plays very well.
253;Thought provoking, entertaining, and very much worth adding to our video library.
254;I have watched this on television for many years, I wanted my mom to see it so I bought it for Christmas for herJack Nicholson, Greg Kinear , and Helen Hunt are wonderful.
255;I love the way they all come together!!
256;That's more reason to treasure a movie gem like this one.
257;He also starts a friendship(at first unwillingly)with his gay artist neighbor and the man's little dog.
258;The two performers are so perfect and believeable in these performances that they make you think that it is possible.
259;Greg Kinnear as the neighbor is fantastic.
260;He deserved the Oscar he won for this.
261;Her scenes crying to her mother were classic.
262;This movie is hysterical at one moment, and then serious and romantic the next.
263;It's a beautifully crafted and put together piece of cinema.
264;This is my favorite romantic comedy.
265;I have seen it 10 times and still laugh and cry every time.
266;A great movie with great performances all the way around.
267;Makes you smile one second and cringe the next :.)
268;This is one of the best comedies of the 90's.
269;It is extremely entertaining and features perfect performances by an all.
270;Jack Nicholson really shines as Melvin Udall, a role he was born to play.
271;Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear are also brilliant as Carol the waitress and Simon the f@g, respectively.
272;James L. Brooks manages to write a refreshingly funny screenplay with perfectly drawn characters.
273;It has some great insights on what lonelyness can do to a man and how relationships with other people can change your life.
274;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film an 8!
275;This triad comes smashing together in a suprising way.
276;This film is a true classic.
277;Greg Kinnear is amazing as his gay, artist neighbor who Nicholson initially belittles and berates, but then befriends against all odds.
278;This film will always be a classic on the best of all time lists.
279;This is a funny, compassionate, sensitive film that has a great ending.You can't beat the actors and the plot is great!
280;Very fun, heartwarming and pitiful at times but that is life.
281;Jack Nicholsen playing a malcontent, yet successful writer.
282;He seems to write romances, beacause a woman working at his publishing company asks him how write women so well.
283;helen Hunt did a tremendous job and is well cast alongside Jack Nicholsen.
284;The script is extremely well written and engrossing, and could forget that adorable Brussels Griffen?
285;It really deserved it's oscars and nominations.
286;A feel good movie, I love movies that bring out the best there is in people.
287;it's also nice to have the wealth and money to do good deeds.
288;I was pleasantly suprised right from the beginning.
289;Jack Nicholson makes you laugh throughout the movie.
290;Everyone who is in this movie is perfect for the part they play.
291;I know that in this review all I have talked about is how funny the movie is, but it is truly touching also.
292;1998 was one of those rare exceptions.
293;there is something about Helen Hunt that fascinates me.
294;As Good As It Gets features the talents of Helen Hunt, Jack Nicholson, Cuba Gooding Jr., Greg Kinnear and the underrated Shirley Knight.
295;The true enjoyment is watching some of the finest actors of our time doing what they do best.
296;You really want to see these characters find true happiness.
297;You'll be crying with Helen Hunt, laughing hysterically at Jack Nicholson's antics and will feel amazingly fulfilled when the beautiful ending rolls around.
298;As Good As It Gets is a modern classic.
299;It is funny and family friendly.
300;I would recommend viewing it to my friends and family.
301;The '97 release 'As Good As It Gets' is an immensely entertaining and touching comedy romance with the rare ability to make you cry and laugh simultaneously.
302;The storyline will hold your attention from beginning to end, the dialoque is crisp and original with a mulitude of memorable lines and Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear all deliver superb performances.
303;There are a lot of funny lines in this movie
304;As Good As It Gets is a classic in my mind.
305;hunt is excellent dealing with her life living with her Mother and Son, chronically ill withasthma type illness.
306;Very good off beat comedy.
307;The wife and I enjoyed it very much.
308;helen Hunt is outstanding in her role.
309;One of the best films ever!
310;The dialogue is witty, you care about the characters, and its fun, funny, sad and touching.
311;I loved this story, revisit it , if you've seen it, it's better!
312;Jack rocks in it, of course, as the other actors.
313;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
314;I had seen it before, but I love this movie and consider it a classic.
315;It's funny, sad, romantic .
316;If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend you do.
317;Magnificent performances by Hunt, Nicholson Kinnear.
318;Laughed until I nearly cried best thing is .
319;I loved seeing Jack Nicholson's character from start to finish.
320;I also loved seeing the way the characters interact with each other, which was definately a primary point of the movie.
321;I highly recomend this movie, especially to those who like movies that make you think about your own life, or that has a lot to do with the characters.
322;Jack nicholson is a good actor and I am sure it is a good movie
323;At any rate, if you saw it years ago, I recommend seeing it again.
324;I think this is very compassionate film.
325;The relationship between human and dog are very funny.
326;Good movie with good acting and a good storyline.
327;Jack Nicholson is much better in Something's Gotta Give but this is still a good, solid flick.
328;Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt are great in this movie.
329;great performance from both stars.
330;i enjoy watching this movie.
331;this movie passes all these messages in a very eloquent way, and I higly recommend it.
332;I laughed so hard, so many times during this movie.
333;I have to really like it to do that.
334;I think everyone will love this.
335;he was so funny in this movie.
336;the whole cast worked perfectly together.
337;it's a movie with a message, but also some great laughs.
338;If you haven't seen it, this is a great movie, another must have for me.
339;But those are the top 2 signs of a simply fantastic movie.
340;Something that makes us feel.
341;And feel good about having the hard, ever surprising, magical gift of life.
342;As always Nicholson pulls off a masterful job of playing a wacko.
343;And that my friends is a rarity.
344;I'm new to the 'As Good as it Gets' fanclub sort.
345;I've also always enjoyed Hunt and Kinnear so it's a shoe.
346;in for me to enjoy this film right?
347;Right off the bat Nicholson is at his best playing the grumpy old man, but he always adds just the right amount of class and confidence to lift him from Walter Matthau status and place him in the Michael Caine league.
348;Unexpectedly Melvin forms an attachment to the dog and is somehow changed by his experience and moved to be a nicer, better person.
349;Carol and Melvin and Simon throughout the remander of the film form a bond that is both unexpected and remarkably beautiful.
350;Helen Hunt is wonderful in this film, as is Kinnear, but it's Nicholson's show and there isn't a better man for the show.
351;I have never watched a performance that made me more anxious then watching Nicholson say the WRONG thing everytime, but as Carol realizes, he has his moments, and those moments are about as good as it gets.
352;This a rare film about people learning to be with each other, coming together and recognizing each other's humanity and putting aside trivial differences.
353;Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, with help from Greg Kinnear, write true movie magic about helping each other, and how things should be.
354;type guy learns how to treat people with compassion.
355;He starts out hating, of course, gays, people of color, and women, but we see a tender transformation happen and it is remarkable.
356;Put them together and an amazing film comes out the end.
357;Recommended to anyone who is looking for laughs and chemistry between two people.
358;This is truly Jack Nicholson at his best.
359;You feel that saddness because you know you will no longer be able to enjoy any more of their work.
360;Luckily when that person has made some films you can look back at them at the prime of their careers.
361;It was our favorite half hour of the week for years.
362;But if you want to see the true mark of this man's sweetness there are two small roles in other peoples pictures that I love.
363;In Knocked Up he plays the perfect dad to his son Seth Rogan showing him that despite his screw ups he is still very much loved.
364;And in the movie here As Good As It Gets he plays the gift Doctor who changes the life of a sick childs family.
365;When he appears at their apartment you feel vicariously their relief and happiness.
366;Ramis perfectly portrays a man who is shy and embarassed by the attention but you trust he will make their lives much better from now on.
367;It was a perfect role for him because he made our lives much better bringing laughter into the life of millions.
368;I would highly recommend this film to all who are missing Ramis who passed away this week.
369;As Good As It Gets is one of the best comedies released in 1997.
370;Such comedy combines well with drama at the right places to give it the added flavor.
371;It combines attitude, laughter, romance, and family.
372;This movie rightfully earned seven Oscar nominations including Best Picture.
373;Nicholson's role has the intensity that gives this film the added comedy.
374;His research into his character's disease and his characteristics showcase very well.
375;As always, no words can express how terrific his acting is.
376;Her performance is enough to make an audience cry.
377;Greg Kinnear's Oscar nominated role as a depressed gay man is one of the best performances of his career.
378;All the other actors also performed wonderfully: Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich, Cuba Gooding Jr., and many more(even the dog).
379;As Good As It Gets is a great movie for those who are looking for a unique comedy.
380;I also bring this up because Nicholson won the Oscar for this role when he didn't bring home the gold for better work, but that's the nature of the beast.
381;Helen Hunt, on the other hand, gave the best screen performance of her career as the struggling waitress who relunctantly allows herself to fall in love with Nicholson's headcase.
382;It should also be noted that good work is delivered by Greg Kinnear as a gay artist, a change of pace for him from the usual cads he plays as well as Cuba Gooding Jr. as an art dealer.
383;This is a very good film but in retrospect I'm not sure it is worthy of the best picture nomination it snagged in 1997.
384;this was an okay movie.
385;it had some funny parts in it, but other than that it was okay.
386;We've watched this one several times and we love it.
387;In reviewing this movie, it's important to note the fine performance by Jack Nicholson for which he won an academy award.
388;The issue is whether Jack Nicholson is best actor or whether the award is for best performance by an actor.
389;the award is, in fact given for best performance.
390;With Jack Nicholson, you get the same person in every movie but wow, he sure plays that person well.
391;What I mean is that John Wayne played a certain type of personality, so did James Stewart and many others.
392;So to with Nicholson, you are always aware that it is Nicholson playing the role and, in effect, he is bigger than the role he is playing.
393;Anyway, Nicholson is great as Melvin.
394;Nicholson is perfect for the role and there's the rub.
395;Just as John Wayne was perfect for the role of a gunslinger out west, so to Nicholson is perfect for this offbeat role.
396;Nicholson won a previous best actor Oscar for One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest.
397;As incredibly good as he is in his roles, does he deserve a second Oscar for playing his persona spectacularly well yet again?
398;I have no answer but, I recommend this fine movie and ask that you consider this question.
399;One of my all time favorite movies.
400;Nicholson is at his obnoxious but lovable best, Helen Hunt is a treasure and Greg Kinnear gives a touching performance.
401;This is a very entertaining movie and Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt are terrific in their parts.
402;Jack is in his glory as an eccentric, which he plays well.
403;this is a funny film, with some of the greatest lines ever written for jack nicholson.
404;and he has had some great ones.
405;Jack Nicholson gives a great performance in this film and so does Greg Kinnear.
406;Helan Hunt also gave a good performance but not in my opinion an Oscer winning one.
407;This starts a topsy turvey love story.
408;Nicholson has some very funny lines in this movie which makes it a very funny movie who everyone should enjoy.
409;Jack Nicholson is great as an obsessive compulsive nutcase in this movie.
410;His attachment with his neighbors dog calms him down, and portrays that this type of person can be helped in our society.
411;It combines everyday people with everyday problems with a little love added to it.
412;I highly recommend watching it.
413;The role that Jack Nicholson plays is classic Jack and well suited for him .
414;Irreverant, witty, cocky, quirky and sometimes introspective.
415;It deserved all the awards and accolades the film received.
416;Brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and cleanly directed, this strange and wonderful tale is one of the best romantic comedies ever to hit the silver screen.
417;Jack Nicholson, as a weird and mean obsessive/compulsive writer named Melvin Udall, is even better than he usually is, and he is one of the great actors of our time, and even Greg Kinnear in a supporting role as the sensitive gay guy next door is outstanding.
418;of course I love impossible love, unrequited love, love that takes decades to culmination.
419;This is a case of impossible love come true.
420;Eat your heart out Nora Ephron!
421;james L. Brooks, who directed and who, along with Mark Andrus (from his story) wrote the script, is to be highly commended.
422;And a patient and caring, under.
423;appreciated Manhattan waitress in a house dress, finding not just love but somebody who really knows who she is and what she's worth is also just wonderful.
424;A wonderful movie to lift the spirit.
425;But As Good As It Gets is more than that.
426;The dialogue is sharp and witty and big.
427;city sophisticated and sometimes laugh out loud funny.
428;The underlying statements about relationships and love in urban America are subtle and thought.
429;In fact everything works in this movie, from the adorable little dog whom Melvin loves ( A dog.
430;[who has captured his heart] he tells us in amazement), to Greg Kinnear's character's friend (Cuba Gooding) trying to act tough, to Shirley Knight in a bit part as Helen Hunt's character's mother, to the cute little boy with asthma.
431;This is a wonderful movie, although perhaps not for those who are homophobic or 13.
432;This movie is absolutely one of the best movies to come around in a long time.
433;It goes down to the deepest levels of the human spirit, and triumphs.
434;Jack Nicholson gives his best performance since One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and really shows us that anybody can become a better person.
435;(Kinnear gives an outstanding performance and should have won the Oscar for best supporting actor that year) He plays a man who after a brutal attack directed at him must come to grips with himself again and regain his self.
436;Also featured is Helen Hunt, who gives a wonderful performance as the waitress who waits on Nicholson at his favorite diner.
437;The character development grows between Nicholson and Hunt and Kinnear and Nicholson until eventually all three story lines intersect.
438;good movie, with rich, detailed characters portrayed by actors who fit into the roles like a glove.
439;This movie was nominated for many oscars, but this was the Year of Titanic, and pulled away with best actor and actress nods for Nicholson and Hunt.
440;When you watch this movie, you actually feel for these 3 people, and you want them to be happy with their lives, which is what's missing from many movies these days.
441;James L. Brooks, who is at his finest, co. wrote and directed this movie with such spirit.
442;This film is a triumph, on many levels.
443;love comes in a strange way.
444;It has a very happy ending.
445;It's one to watch over and over!
446;I think you will enjoy it!
447;Jack Nicholson continues his trend of being the best actor in Hollywood with the brilliant story by James Brooks (the Cheers guy) and superb performances by Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear to aid him.
448;Nicholson is grand as an obsessive.
449;Just love film As Good As It Gets.
450;Jack Nickelson great actor, and movie is a wonderful escapist movie for me.
451;This movie stars Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr.
452;He is well known in Manhattan.
453;OMG Between Nicholson falling in love with the dog, and Helen Hunt who is a waitress that is nice to him helps Nicholson back into the human race.
454;There is so much more going on in this movie, fantastic comedy/drama.
455;Best actress went to Hunt Best actor went to NicholsonYou can not go wrong on this movie.
456;Good chemistry, lots of every.
457;day issues handled with reason, brings tears and laughter while tugging at heart strings.
458;Not a Jack Nicholas fan, but really enjoyed this movie.
459;Loved that it was a Prime Amazon gift.
460;it was a movie I would recommend to mature adults that love Jack Nicholson and have a good sense of humour.
461;Over the years I have been amazed at the ability of Jack Nicholson to successfully play such a wide range of characters.
462;at the start we find Melvin, a highly reclusive though extremely successful author, living alone in an apartment.
463;over time Melvin finds himself increasingly attracted to Carol, and when she leaves her job at the cafe he tracks her down.
464;although the movie is billed as a comedy and does have its funny moments, it is far more profound and poignant than is the typical comedy.
465;She did an incredible job in AGAIG.
466;Nicholson is a hoot as always.
467;One of the best actors ever.
468;blooded american guys like me who are crazy about Helen, that certainly was a nice and unexpected surprise.
469;Fantastic, looks and sounds awesome and by far the best looking this movie could be.
470;time favorite actor, and I have only seen one movie with him in it that was less than stellar, and that was Wolf.
471;As far as I'm concerned, this is probably his FUNNIEST and best movie yet!
472;He built it into one of his many monologues so that ultimately it moved from the oral to the written tradition in what we think of as Ancient Greece.
473;Having plenty of cash available, Brooks and his backers were willing to insure success by giving a great deal of it to Jack Nicholson and lesser amounts to his co. stars and the remainder of the cast.
474;The result: a first rate romantic comedy likely to make its two hours and twenty minutes seem but a few minutes of pleasure.
475;This is a good one likely to entertain most people
476;The surround sound and especially the dialogue very satisfactory.
477;A movie that relates to issues experienced by many people/families daily, and well portrayed through the movie.
478;The speed of ordering and shipping was exceptional.
479;esque character was the most entertaining part of the movie for me.
480;in with a penchant for saying exactly what's on his mind.
481;this movie renders some of the more classic lines in cinematic history, including Sell crazy some place else.
482;It was very well done and very smart in the delivery of a moral that's all about accepting the differences of those around us and living in a world where love and respect for said differences truly can conquer all.
483;Fully dramatic, heartfelt and genuine.
484;accepts that life is worth living .
485;as good as it gets.
486;helen Hunt is absolutely radiant in the role as the corner shop waitress who's forced to deal with Nicholson's habits .
487;and, much to her surprise and the audience, she begins to experience true emotion for the man.
488;He has bouts of great self.
489;esteem countered by comic moments of heightened anxiety, and the subtlety he brings to his portrayal is may be all.
490;hollywood but is surprisingly human.
491;a perfect mix, this film is about AS GOOD AS IT GETS.
492;This is a wonderful movie for anyone seeking to appreciate how challenges open new windows into ourselves.
493;The performances are outstanding and the chemistry between the actors elicits a full range of emotions from the viewer.
494;it is A great romantic comedy and showing Jack Nickelson at his prime
495;It's one you will want to re.
496;It's a classic for a video library.
497;it's a romance at its heart, yes.
498;But it's got at least 2 more subplots that are deeply moving, and not romance.
499;rich woman, or a gay, this movie has something to reward you.
500;If you're none of these types, you'll still deeply enjoy the comedy and pathos.
501;it's quintissential Jack Nicholson, and enjoyable for that.
502;Yet, they're deeply dignified, heartbreakingly engaging and believable.
503;there she is, doing well in that role, despite her obvious assets.
504;You'll feel the angst and dignity in each and every character in this film, and cheer for them.
505;liners, will stay with you for weeks.
506;I remember seeing this back in 1997.
507;I was pleasantly surprised when, watching it 15 years later with my wife, that it's just as good as I remember.
508;As Good As It Gets is about characters.
509;It'll make you laugh and cry at the same time.
510;I suspect part of what makes the movie so great is that there's a great cast of actors, including Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinear.
511;This is one of the most memorable performances for all three actors.
512;i guess the best thing I can say about this is that it rises far above the romantic comedy genre.
513;This is a movie anybody and everybody can enjoy.
514;But this is gooddespite the comedy.
515;Thi movie is a feel good in mankind type of movie.
516;i loughed so hard, Jack Nicholoson is superb on this one.
517;His looks and his actions are very convincing.
518;He really strugles hard to make a compliment.
519;And Jack Nickolson offers us a great performance.
520;it's a must see for women and men alike.
521;He lives at an apartment in new york city.
522;There is also is neigbhor who gets mocked and made fun of by melvin almost everyday.
523;Until the day when his neighbhor gets beaten up and his waitress is at home taking care of her sick boy.
524;Could there be love in store for melvin?Filled with heartwarming moments, funny snappy dialogue, comedic moments, and good old jack nicholson atittude.
525;this is one story that answers the all time question:What if this is as good as it gets?
526;Well, as a movie buff, I sure hope so.
527;This movie has got just about everything.
528;She realizes this is As good as it gets, and has to make a choice.
529;So very many subplots, and contemporary statements made in this movie.
530;A great cast delivers moments of random charmed exchanges of humanity.
531;There are some really romantic scenes that I'd never expect from Jack.
532;This story is about a torturous and funny road to fulfillment and Jack's facial features carry the story from event to event.
533;Having two such characters in the same film is a treat.
534;This is a great film that has been around for more than 15 years.
535;The sound is also greatly improved.
536;What is also nice about this limited edition is that it contains a brief booklet.
537;It is full of stills from the film itself and contains a nice and informative article about this film written by Julie Kirgo.
538;Helen Hunt did a wonderful job playing off Jack's cranky character.
539;I enjoy watching this one over and over again.
540;A deeply troubled man and a harried single mother find peace and happiness in an unlikely relationship.
541;Nicholson is artful in his role as usual.
542;watched this movie and loved it again.
543;There is so much humor and that adorable dog in the movie.
544;It was great to see a great ensemble cast and how Jack Nicholson turns his life around.
545;This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen.
546;All the actors did an amazing job bringing their characters to life.
547;And the chemistry between the three main characters is extraordinary and is constantly evolving.
548;The supporting cast enhances these dynamics.
549;The story is very easy to understand and adorable.
550;Nicholson once again steals the show.
551;And the ending is sheer perfection.
552;Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended, though not for the younger crowd.
553;I loved it and I'm confident you will as well.
554;This is an extraordinary romantic comedy that can be seen again and again with pure delight.
555;Nicholson stars in one of his best 5 roles of all time.
556;In spite of this fact, Nicholson is almost overshadowed by great performances by Hunt and Kinnear, especially Hunt.
557;the movie gives the viewer so much.
558;It is wonderful and amazing.
559;Seeing Nicholson's Melvin soften and melt with the dog and his gay neighbor is just terrific.
560;The film showcases Hunt's acting ability and her stunning beauty.
561;the movie is warm, witty, romantic, funny and very engaging.
562;This is one of the best romantic comedies I have ever watched with a lot of good life lessons in it.
563;This is one of the most best comedy to grace hollywood and the world.
564;i loved this movie and i'm sure you will too.
565;Its a six time oscar winner and eight time nommenee including best supporing actor (cuba gooding,jr).
566;This is my higest rated movie and its a gurantee that you will love it too.
567;It is a story of human relationships, of love and friendship, of new beginnings, and of how people can conquer their fears, how people can change.
568;mouthed and successful author
569;out waitress whose life literally revolves around her devastatingly allergic son
570;How these people meet, connect and react to each other is a stroke of screenwriting genius, producing a hilarious and touching story that I feel should have won best picture over Titanic.
571;Nicholson and Hunt readily deserved their Oscars for their exceptional performances, and I believe that Kinnear also deserved a win.
572;Watch for Cuba Gooding Jr. in a strong and witty performance as Simon's art dealer.
573;The last 15 minutes or so of this film contain the best ending that anyone could hope for outside of the Shawshank Redemption.
574;Check it out and enjoy!
575;One of the best love stories I've ever seen.
576;It has so much emotion and truth in it.
577;The story is conveyed very well and displays some of the best actinf I've ever seen.
578;A sensitive look at the locked in nature of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with a feel.
579;Great acting from three major stars.
580;This is a great movie.
581;It is sad/dramatic at times but overall it is pretty amusing.
582;I think the best actor in the entire movie is the dog.
583;The dog is just amazing.
584;I absolutely love this movie and have watched it over a dozen times.
585;I can watch this movie over and over, is one of the great movies ever.
586;Jack Kicholson is just perfect on his performance, you cannot lose any movement or dialogue of this character.
587;I enjoyed reading the book and found the movie to be just as entertaining.
588;It is a great story and very realistic.
589;This is a touching story loaded with reality and laughter.
590;Jack Nicholson is superb in his role actually so too is the entire cast.
591;I would say it is a wonderful film for the entire family and especially entertaining to be sure.
592;There aren't many movies that you can watch several times, but this is one of those rare ones.
593;Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and the rest of the cast turn in a memorable performance.
594;inside this normal selfishness, the daily encounter with this single but very worried woman will become a real breakthrough in his values code.
595;through a smart script that includes a set of funny vignettes, the power of love will gradually loom and dictate finally the expected bliss.
596;Helen Hunt `s performance is impeccable
597;Cuban Gooding Jr is magnificent too in his brief but well reminded appearance, radiant, freshness and spontaneous humor.
598;And the breathtaking revelation of Greg Kinnear in his very difficult role, making to date his best achievement on the screen.
599;and for this lovable pet, a sonorous applause, one of the best dog performances ever made.
600;Dazzling direction and memorable artistic direction.
601;I believe that love is the best of things.
602;If you love and are loved, then you have hope that the world will become a better place.
603;His world opens up when he meets Carol, a gorgeous woman who is on the South side of a bad marriage.
604;Throw in a neighbour who is a rising artist in need, Jack's personality and an adorable little bow.
605;wow dog and you have a delightful mix that very much parallels reality.
606;it's funny how our lives can sink into ruts that don't seem to lead anywhere, and suddenly that special woman comes along and gives us purpose in life, and gives our lives meaning.
607;And, in the end it underlines the essential truth that if you are loved and you love, the world is a pretty special place.
608;This is a classic comedy.
609;I have only seen several movies worth owning.
610;Jack Nicholson is an amazing mixture of brilliance, an impossible personality, vulnerable, honest, and certifiably insane.
611;They actually slip a robust story in on you while you laugh.
612;Great for trips, family nights, I watched it the other day just for a laugh.
613;This is one of my favorites.
614;Jack is amazing as always
615;The acting is superb, the plot line impeccable and the writing of the one liners such as, I'm drowning in the water and your describing it.
616;Even the dog is funny.
617;this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and you can't miss this one.
618;You will fall in love with Jack Nicholson's character (he plays an obsessive compulsive), Helen Hunt is at her finest and Greg Kinnear is a hidden gem.
619;Not to mention oh lala the ever gorgeous Cuba Gooding, Jr. every role shines, from the small ones to the big.
620;Here is a romantic comedy which you can view more than once.
621;The script and direction by James L. Brooks (check out his wonderful montage as Carol, unable to sleep in the middle of the night, urgently travels to Manhatten to tell Melvin something that can't wait) make this film extraordinary.
622;But it's Helen Hunt's performance that raises this film yet another notch.
623;Somehow, in her long TV career, she has mastered her craft, learned a marvelous range of ways to communicate with her face, learned to stretch (sort of like rubato in music) time to increase the impact of her acting, learned an integrity of performance which will take your breath away.
624;He grabbed my attention right from the begining of this film, and watching him through out the rest of this movie was very very very enjoyable.
625;helen Hunt and the other supporting casts had superb performances as well.
626;All the characters had terrific chemistries together.
627;This film is loaded with laughs.
628;Every moment seemed real and fun to watch.
629;This is a superb movie in displaying all of the actors talents and heartwarming story.
630;Helen Hunt is great as always in her role as a strong and independent mother.
631;Jack Nicholson is also at his best giving a very convincing performance of a disenfranchised writer who is quite the outspoken fellow.
632;I like this movie because it has depth with all of the layers in the characters and they really show them as the movie progresses into richer territory.
633;A wonderful comedy with a lot of passion put into the writing.
634;A must see for film lovers.
635;A lot better than i thought it would be.
636;It is one of those that you play evey so often year after year.
637;Jack Nicholson gives a 'shining' performance.
638;The casting of Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt is superb.
639;Greg Kinnear also plays an impressive role as a down.
640;out, but very talented artist.
641;a movie that makes you laugh and cry at the same time .
642;I had seen As Good as It Gets several times before but loved it and wanted to share it with a friend who had not seen it.
643;com and it arrived in a timely manner.
644;I enjoyed it as much as ever and maybe more because my friend liked it very much also.
645;No matter what movie Jack Nicholson is in, he is a joy to watch.
646;the movie had an excellent story, was funny, clever, touching and very well paced.
647;It's rare to find a movie that accomplishes great humor solely through wit rather than stirring in insults, sexual innuendoes or gags to fill the dull moments.
648;This was a good movie for a good price.
649;This is one of my all time fav movies funny touching and shows what love can do.
650;But I watched it today, and found out that it was actually pretty good.
651;Helen Hunt gives the best performance in the movie, but the Oscar should still have gone to Kate Winslet for Titanic.
652;Jack Nicholson was also good, but not quite Oscar worthy.
653;I found this movie to be warm, a little cold, witty, and funny.
654;Tough guy Jack Nicholson is terrific as an obsessive compulsive and intolerant bachelor, who ends up helping out his gay neighbor, played by Greg Kinnear, with great sensitivity.
655;One of my favorite lines from a movie.
656;A wonderful movie on tolerance and understanding.
657;Although Jack Nichols is the main character, Helen Hunt is the force behind the movie, I enjoyed the movie very much.
658;taking, the storyline is beautiful and very well written, the cast is a marvelous cast and everything was the way it should have been.
659;She really brought her character to life and it was beautiful to watch.
660;So watch, enjoy and know that I'm only trying to be as honest as possible.
661;I enjoyed As Good As It Gets when I first watched it at the theater, but now that I've seen it again on video, I have come to truly appreciate the brilliance of the script.
662;As Good As It Gets from 1997,directed by James L. Brooks,(Terms of Endearment,the Oscar winning Best Picture of 1983,Broadcast News,nominee for Best Picture of 1987),is probably the first movie to feature a character with Obsessive.
663;robert Duvall should have won for his terrific performance in the overlooked and underrated The Apostle.
664;i'm sorry the lovely Sandra Bullock turned the role down.
665;one of the best lines in the movie is when Nicholson's character asks some people in a waiting room who are about to attend a support group,What if this is as good as it gets?
666;Jack Nicholson is a national treasure: those erratic, errant eyebrows, that rubbery face, those quick mood shifts, his overall nuttiness.
667;He has plenty of money so he is able to manipulate people.
668;it's a movie with a lot of laughs brought on by one of the biggest hams in the business.
669;Jack is a comedic master, but one sometimes wonders where Jack leaves off, and the role he is playing begins.
670;Jack Nicholson, one of the great actors, teams with Helen Hunt in a wonderful comedy/drama.
671;The little dog steals the show, too.
672;He soon achieves a certain subtle love for the beast, and when Simon has healed and comes back for the dog, it doesn't even want to leave.
673;He would love to reach out and gain some friends.
674;he just takes himself to a new extreme.
675;melvin is surely one of the great screen characters of all time, ranking up there with Raymond Rain Man Babbitt and Forrest Gump as some of the most unique and likable inventions to ever grace the big screen.
676;Nicholson presents his character in an especially effective way.
677;hunt won the Oscar for her work in As Good As It Gets, but it was truly Nicholson who deserved it.
678;regardless of all this, As Good As It Gets still stands alone as one of the cleverest romantic comedies of all time, and certainly one that both sexes can agree on.
679;The film features some of the most memorable lines ever written on paper, the majority of them all coming from the lips of Melvin Udall, perfectly spoken by a typical gruff Jack Nicholson.
680;They all come off as utterly hilarious and convincing.
681;This is the type of new.
682;It's founded in its characters, their lives, their interaction, and how they learn to overcome their own personal obstacles and moral obligations.
683;This film carries all the Autumn.
684;time sweetness and cleverness of a Rob Reiner comedy, and all the lightness of a Frank Capra movie.
685;It's a delightful blend of comedy and romance, and the type of redefining genre motion picture that When Harry Met Sally was eight years prior.
686;what a perfect, delightful movie.
687;Hunt and Greg Kinnear would seem funny itself if it wasn't exactly what they did.
688;And the writing is much, much better than OK.
689;it's a great movie with great performances, and was drenched with Oscars as a result.
690;Even the extras are mint talent.
691;I think this movie should have won for best picture, I think it was better thas Titanic and with better actors too, I think Jack Nicholson is one of the best actors of all time and Hellen Hunt is a great actress too.
692;It is sometimes called a romantic comedy and it certainly has its share of both laughs and romance.
693;But whatever you choose to call it, this is one excellent film.
694;The script features dialog that is so well done it should be mandatory to study it in film schools across the country.
695;The cast is outstanding from top to bottom.
696;I would suspect that they all recognized how exceptional the script was and wanted to do it justice.
697;Nicholson also pursues a romance with Helen Hunt's character.
698;yet somehow infuses him with enough humanity that we can't help but root for him.
699;I won't give any more of the plot away but suffice to say that it is fascinating to watch all of this unfold on screen.
700;But it rewards those who watch with laughter and a great deal of food for thought.
701;It's highly entertaining and I recommend it to one and all.
702;It is, dare I say.
703;as good as it gets.
704;This was a movie that had a lot of humor, very good acting.
705;Jack Nicholson proves himself once again to be one of Hollywood's best comic acors.
706;is this maybe his best film?
707;He actually pays for the medical bills to get him the treatment he needs.
708;Melvin and Simon have a great back and forth.
709;But a lot of people that's their story good times noodle salad.
710;You know I could go on and on but the performances are really good Jack Nicholson was great.
711;Greg Kinnar was off and on to me but worked very well.
712;So that's As Good As It Gets.
713;If you are going to se one film from the 90's, this is it.
714;Warmth, humor, and friendship like I've never seen before.
715;Possibly the most brilliant film ever.
716;One of the blockbuster movies of 1997, and nominated for seven Academy Awards,  As Good As It Gets is a hilarious slant on romantic comedies.
717;Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinear, and Cuba Gooding Jr. star in this very funny approach to the life of Melvin Udall.
718;gay dialogue is definitely not for the family oriented movie watcher, but in the context of this film it is truly funny.
719;home medical care for him so that Carol is able stay at work to serve him.
720;Melvin continuously does things that are self serving, but still are beneficial to the people he is so abrasive to, and these people are able to see some good in him.
721;I do think that a good many people will enjoy this movie and to see Jack Nicholson in this role was a real treat to watch.
722;I rate this film at 4 stars and would give 5 if it were not for the language and crude humor.
723;This was funny as well as a sweet love story.
724;Both main characters were great.
725;greg Kinnear was absolutely fantastic as Simon.
726;he played the perfect connective fiber along with his dog.
727;nicholson is top notch as is Helen Hunt.
728;miss out on an incredible movie with a deeper message than you might initially think.
729;I watched this movie based on a friend recommendation.
730;I absolutely loved the movie !!
731;This is one of the best movies of the last dozen or so years.
732;fashioned charm to the storyline and its characters.
733;nicholson is superb in his portrayal of an obsessive and outrageously politically incorrect boob.
734;That this boob has a soft, appealing side is what makes the movie so compelling and worthy.
735;For people who appreciate wise humor and unique sociological views, this flick is outstanding.
736;Very funny and impressive movie.
737;This is a wonderful story of two men who develop an unlikely friendship.
738;So much comedy and an awesome cast.
739;I would recommend this movie to watch.
740;enjoyed watching and you would enjoy too!!!
741;Loved the dog and the romance.
742;Great acting, great story and for a comedy it's as good as it gets!
743;It was well worth having prime to watch this movie basically for free.
744;This is a fun movie, especially if you're in the mental health field.
745;It's very funny and well acted.
746;jack nicholson was great in this movie.
747;great movie Ive watched it several times in the past.
748;This movie is a very funny.
749;This movie, As Good as it Gets is a great movie.
750;Jack Nicholson is superb in this movie.
751;Laughter, tears and a realization that we all have some challenges that we must overcome.
752;Nicholson at his comedic best!
753;Love the show and the cast, well written and executed.
754;Great addition to any collection!
755;Nicholson, Hunt and Kinnear all give 5 star performances.
756;The movie is funny and tender, with moments that will make you laugh and cry.
757;I've just finished watching it for the 25th or so time, and its just as wonderful as it was the first time.
758;This movie makes you realize that life is pretty good.
759;Jack Nicholson did a wonderful job portraying a fearful man who finally found his heart through courage.
760;Simple story that is fun to watch.
761;classic jack nicholson, eyebrows and all, he plays the perfect old obsessive compulsive!
762;This is an excellent product.
763;My husband and I were well pleased as was our granddaughter.
764;Its a classic movie and one to enjoy over and over again.
765;Jack Nicholas is great as always.
766;I watched this movie as soon as I got it and all of my friends were right on how good it was.
767;This is probably one of his best films to date, along with The Shining, and he really excells himself, showing his real acting abilities.
768;His co. stars Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear compliment his acting style, and they both truly deserve their Oscars for best actress and actor.
769;This film is well worth watching and Nicholson's character is one of the best characters I've ever seen.
770;it is fun and horrifying getting Old.
771;.100% deserves the awards given.
772;I absolutely loved this movie.
773;Jack Nicholson is at his sarcastic, nasty, and yet still loveable, best.
774;Greg Kinnear is great as is Helen Hunt.
775;It tells a great story and teaches a great lesson all at the same time.
776;In my opinion the best movie Jack Nicholson has ever done.
777;This movie does a good job of pairing up strangers, who have their own issues.
778;It shows how life can be so untimely, and yet shows us how we are all really the same.
779;It mixes comedy with the reality of daily life.
780;however, what makes the whole thing work is the supporting cast.
781;The script, the actors, even the dog were great!
782;This is one of my favorite movies.
783;This was great and Jack N. was either born to do it or it was made for him.
784;Directors, Producers: More movies like this, please!
785;This movie is one of my all time favorites.
786;I thought I was going to receive the movie though.
787;Jack and the supporting cast went beyond themselves to make a movie that put the cast of characters in your heart as well as your mind.
788;Jack went above and beyond his usual acting ability and made the whole thing believable.
789;A great movie that combines lots of humor with a pull on the heart strings, and the acting is superb!
790;First and foremost, the best thing about this movie.
791;He has some of the best one.
792;liners I've ever heard, but his character also has incredible depth, and can be analyzed over and over again.
793;rounded, and just so I don't take anything away from Nicholson.
794;I thought she did a great job.
795;I have no objection at all for the fact that she won the Oscar
796;greg Kinnear rounds out the big 3 by putting in a great performance as well.
797;Melvin is an extremely likeable character, but as you will discover if you haven't seen this movie yet, most of his humor stems from his crass and tactless nature.
798;it is hilarious as a comedy, and touching and thought.
799;Love the premise of this movie.
800;Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt are at their best.
801;It is a very poignant, rather believable story.
802;It is funny and tender.
803;I can watch this movie again and again, and enjoyed sharing it with my sons when they were old enough to appreciate it.
804;It celebrates generosity and kindness with three individuals who have challenges in their own way.
805;Having worked in a restaurant, the relationship you have with your regulars is special.
806;It is interesting how you can impact each others' lives positively through a kind word or gesture.
807;It was delightful to see this portrayed in a movie and how each blessed the other.
808;Jack Nicholson is one of my favorites.
809;he just makes you believe he is the character he's playing!This movie makes you laugh.
810;I think it's one of his best.
811;As Good as it Gets is just that.
812;A very good movie with Jack Nicholson playing the acerbic, rigid, but successful romance novalist, Melvin Udall.
813;He knows Melvin is a stickler for detail and trusts Melvin.
814;Profound changes await them all in this witty, touching tale.
815;jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear give a flawless perfomance and smart dialogue throughout.
816;This movie is blunt but poignant at times.
817;All the actors played their parts perfectly.
818;I'd recommend this movie as a feel.
819;Love the characters in this movie.
820;Script was fabulous as it lets people know that we should help others when we can and that there are numerous ways to be positive in life.
821;Nicholson does one of his very best acting jobs.
822;The rest of the cast is great too.
823;This is a movie to show us as viewers that life can get pretty bad sometimes but the right people and taking chances can make life better or at least a little more interesting.
824;JACK NICHOLSON was excellent and the Oscar proved it.
825;HELEN HUNT was wonderful as well her acting wasn't overdone or underdone.
826;gREG KINNEAR is also brilliant and heartwarming.
827;SHIRLEY KNIGHT, and VERDELL THE DOG also add to the brilliance of this masterful film with their enjoyable performances.
828;among the best 3 movies of 1997, along with good will hunting and l. a. confidential.
829;this movie has 3 top artistes giving off their best.
830;the story is simple, and yet so complex.
831;world and yet so real.
832;as good as it gets revels in this paradox.
833;touching at the raw chords, a story of a man who cannot (or rather does not want to) reveal his emotions.
834;greg kinear plays a brilliant role as the gay friend.
835;he would have bagged the oscars in most years, his tough luck that he ran into robin williams giving his career best performance in good will hunting.
836;as good as it gets is funny, endearing, touching, dark, sad, cathartic, confusing and enlightening all at once.
837;one of the modern masterpieces.
838;the casting director deserves a special award for this casting coup.
839;watch the movie for the brilliant performances, the arresting chemistry between these superstars, the heart.
840;this is one of the best movies of the 90s.
841;This is one of my favorite movies.
842;He's perfect as Melvin Udall, as are Helen Hunt, Shirley Knight and Greg Kinear.
843;A fun experience with lots of character development.
844;Terrific performance by Nicholson, perhaps the best of his career.
845;Great writing and terrific insights into human nature.
846;Loved Greg, Helen, and Cuba's performances.
847;famous and wealthy author Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) sits in front of his beautifully lit computer.
848;Speaking softly and eloquently to himself as he composes the revelatory ending of his 62nd book .
849;he types warm words about love and deep relationships.
850;Mountains of expensive LPs all lined up in perfect alphabetical order .
851;I've got Jews on my table!
852;He calls gay men fudge.
853;an idealistic painter who obsessively worships his small fluffy dog Verdell .
854;both Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt won the Oscar for 1997's As Good As It Gets .
855;They're simply fabulous in their roles as polar opposite people .
856;The movie has a ballbreakingly funny script that relishes in the attack .
857;but also knows when to turn on the heart.
858;Melvin shouts as a cackle of school kids on the sidewalk .
859;When Dr. Bettes (the wonderful Harold Ramis) tells working.
860;it's funny, moving and beautiful.
861;is tender and awkward and genuinely touching .
862;Melvin pays Carol a real compliment for the first time (dialogue above) and a softer better person emerges.
863;he's an awesome thing to see and his character's awfulness towards all of humanity is a wonder to behold.
864;monumental prick that he is .
865;he gives his Melvin a beating heart.
866;the picture fills the entire screen and is gorgeous throughout.
867;A very real let down however is the complete absence of any Extras .
868;They produce movies of depth, wit and hope .
869;and the brill As Good As It Gets is right up there.
870;Melvin says to Carol in a rare moment of genuine breakthrough.
871;Lots of movies I liked pretty well the first time I saw them weren't nearly as appealing when I see them again some years later.
872;the writing is so crisp it snaps.
873;The acting is so pleasurable it's like being ring.
874;The direction, photography, set design, art direction, etc. i hear often in recent reviews that Jack Nicholson is given roles where he gets, essentially, to play Jack Nicholson.
875;but it means that the Jack we get to see in this movie seems a good guy to spend 2 hours with.
876;yet this film exceeds that more recent work by pretty much every measurable marker.
877;i'll watch this film probably once a year as long as I live.
878;This is one of my fave movies.
879;It's beautiful to make the discovery of his humanity along with all of the characters.
880;Watch this one with a Kleenex in your hand.
881;It truly is a comedy from the heart that goes for the throat.
882;The movie makes us laugh.
883;We watch it occasionally when we need to lighten up.
884;it entertains us with the superb acting of Jack Nicholson and the poignant face of Helen Hunt.
885;A drama professor I know uses it to teach his students how to write screen plays because it is an excellent example of the technique.
886;a movie should help us move out of ourselves.
887;For a couple of hours or so we should be able to forget our cares and move into some other existence.
888;Wow, what an original, brilliantly written and flawlessly acted movie!
889;Helen Hunt, as always, surpasses even her usual perfection, and Greg Kinnear surprises with a moving performance in a role that could easily have been two.
890;Realistic portrayal of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, as well as entertaining.
891;My family and I enjoyed watching it just for the movie element.
892;This is one of the best movies, ever!!!
893;It is funny, witty and shows that even with an ADD for Jack's character, he came through with flying colors.
894;Everyone did a great job and the little dog should have won an Award, as well.
895;But in his awesome performance in A FEW GOOD MEN, I finally saw what the critics and Oscar voters had already seen: the man is an incredibly gifted actor.
896;In AS GOOD AS IT GETS, for which he won a Best Actor award, Nicholson parlays all of his usual tics and gestures into a superb portrait of an obsessive.
897;Helen Hunt in her Oscar winning performance is marvelous
898;And Greg Kinnear (so good in Nurse Betty) is a revelation as the homosexual neighbor, Simon.
899;Kinnear was nominated for a supporting actor award, and he is definitely worthy of that nomination in this superbly nuanced performance.
900;Ditto to the marvelous Shirley Knight who plays Hunt's mother
901;Even Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. redeems himself for Snow Dogs in a showy role as Kinnear's friend.
902;Director James L. Brooks shows a keen sense of knowing how to get the best from his actors, and AS GOOD AS IT GETS is a wonderful film to be enjoyed by all those who have been in love and didn't know it!
903;Yes, this is just another review of this fantastic movie, but I have to put my word in anyway.
904;this is such a great film!
905;One of my top favorites.
906;anyone who can watch this movie and not walk away with their spirits lifted, wearing a huge smile would have to have more issues than thie films main character, Melvin Udall (a terrific and convincing Jack).
907;and besides, the plot is really just an excuse for a fascinating study in human interaction.
908;The great script, which seems lighthearted upon initial viewing, actually goes very deep into these people's lives, and there are many observations about the way that people interact with and affect the people around them.
909;the ace cast, script, production and direction all work together to engage you from the first frames to the final credits.
910;a. half hours pays off in a romantic closing scene that lifts my spirits again and again.
911;Jack Nicholson did a fantastic job being a very difficult character.
912;The story is funny and tragic as the same time.
913;The key line and title are so appropos as to be a perfect delivery.
914;From his love for the god and his treatment of his neighbor, it was a fantastic movie with lots of lessons we could all learn from tolerance to acceptance.
915;Except for a glitch unrelated to the movie, I enjoyed it.
916;Jack Nicholson is absolutely superb as a totally obsessive and compulsive New York writer who eventually regains basic values through chance encounters with waitress Helen Hunt and his neighbour Gregg Kinnear , who also happens to be gay .
917;at times it can get a little emotional but primarily it is just an extremely funny , feel good most of the time ,type of movie .
918;As Good As It Gets really is.
919;Jack Nicholson was born for this role and the rest of the cast is stellar.
920;The content of the plot, although somewhat touchy to some, was reliably riveting and hilariously funny for what could have turned out to be a disastrous situation.
921;splitting laughter to snuffling teariness.
922;It was among the best I've seen of its kind.
923;As Good As It Gets is a 1997 romantic comedy directed by James L Brooks, starring Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, which was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture.
924;The film revolves around Melvin's interaction with his neighbors and his favorite waitress (who is so, because she is the only person in the restaurant that will serve him), Carol, played by Helen Hunt.
925;One of my favorite scenes involves Melvin and Frank (played by Cuba Gooding, Jr).
926;while As Good As It Gets has several politically incorrect lines, in the end, that's what makes this film so good.
927;It's worth the 2 hours it takes to watch the entire movie.
928;I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
929;This movie is one of my favorites I watched it at least ten times now.
930;It has humor, horror, and romance.
931;Jack Nicholson is at the top of his game as Melvin Udall, a successful romance novelist.
932;Melvin asks waitress Carol (nice work from Helen Hunt) to go along.
933;One of the great lines in the movie is when Carol fishes for a complement from Melvin at dinner.
934;Carol does strike up a nice relationship with Simon back at the hotel, even agreeing to pose nude for him.
935;Simon's energy and creativity returns.
936;this film won a Golden Globe for Best Picture in 1997 in addition to awards for Nicholson and Hunt.
937;It is well written and directed by James L. Brooks with writing help from Mark Andrus.
938;It's a fun movie to watch mainly for the way the lead characters interact with each other.
939;If I gloss over them there are moments in the film that are really funny.
940;Just an awesome comical performance by Jack Nicholson.
941;A must see romantic comedy
942;As Good As It Gets, starring Jack Nicholson(Melvin Udall), Helen Hunt,(Carol, the waitress), Greg Kinnear,(Simon, the talented gay guy), and Cuba Gooding, Jr,(Frank, Simons partner) is one of decades more witty love comedies yet.
943;i can see now why this movie won Oscar Awards for Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt in their leading roles and had nominations for Best Picture from Director James Brooks as well as Best Supporting Actor, Greg Kinnear.
944;This is a typical quirky Nicholson role but the difference is that this character grows throughout the film.
945;This is a tour de force performance.
946;She gets to show the gamut of emotion during this film.
947;This is Kinnear's breakout performance.
948;Melvin forces his way intoCarol's life when her son condition worsens.
949;This road trip is the best part of the film.
950;It starts out as a social comedy but develops into a romantic comedy.
951;Whatever it is you should enjoy it.
952;bEST LINE: You make me want to be a better man and What if this is as good as it gets.
953;Jack is great as always, his relationship with the little dog is so funny.
954;we never really are allowed to understand Melvins true motivations,,,guess that's as good as it gets!The movie is an uplifting experience, beautifully shot, dramatic but above all very watchable.
955;One of the finest romantic comedies ever made!
956;The entire cast is excellent in this well written tale of love that is not so perfect.
957;The movie deals with much more than an impossible romance and is sharp,blunt, and clever in it's execution of many social issues.
958;I am not the best fan of either of these actors but they did a great job with what I imagine is a more realistic plot than the chick flick movies.
959;Very good movie enjoyed watching it ,had company over and they loved it we all laughed and couldn't get enough
960;Funny, snappy, excellent acting, excellent story, great study in psychology, I could go on and on.
961;Nicholson and Hunt are at the top of their game in this one and deserved the Oscars they won but where was Shirley Knight's nomination?
962;Greg Kinear was wonderful and heartbreaking and deserved to win too!
963;This was, I thought, a tailor.
964;Originally, I was rooting for Robert Duvall to win the best actor award, but after seeing this three times and analyzing the performance, I definitely agree with Jack Nicholson's win.
965;And the dog is definitely one of the major factors enabling the good person within the Nicholson character to surface.
966;I am not a Jack Nicholson fan, but he really shines here.
967;this is considered a comedy, but there is a very serious undertone to it which is quite well brought out by the acting of the three principle characters (and the dog!)
968;Jacl Nicholson in in a world of his own.
969;Greg Kinnear was great as was Helen Hunt.
970;done, poignant and adult movie.
971;Caveat: liking Jack Nicholson helps a lot.
972;Pros: Jack Nicholson's acting
973;Helen Hunt is fantastic in this moving drama about strangers in New York who become connected.
974;All the players are at the top of their game.
975;First time through the superb black comedy of this story of Melvin Udall .
976;His incredible rudeness to everyone around him is unexpected, shocking and very, very funny and the tension and laughs it generates grab your immediate and undivided attention but mean you miss a lot on the way.
977;second time through the sheer excellence of the acting really hits home.
978;Nicholson's interpretation of Udall's incredibly complex character is superb while Helen Hunt's portrayal of a desperately lonely waitress who's inextricably drawn to him and Greg Kinnear's portrayal of a gay artist struggling to come to terms with his sexuality and Udall's incessant verbal abuse are believable and beautifully touching.
979;putting in an Oscar level tour de force in the Best Supporting Canine section, plus excellent cameo performances from just about everyone else involved.
980;layered story about people's need for love and affection.
981;well there's more to come because as you go back and explore it once again you'll still be laughing .
982;One thing's for certain: it's getting much deeper, more complex and more thought.
983;I enjoyed the movie for it's timely comedy, it's award winning cast, for it's dealing with mental illness in a reasonalbe and sensitive way.
984;The unexpected act of kindness .
985;along with helping his favorite waitress, Carol (Helen Hunt) .
986;helps put Melivn back in the human race and suddenly people start to like him.
987;This is a great movie!
988;It is a romantic comedy, but guys will love with crude humor and jokes!
989;I love all comedy of jack Nicholson and loved this movie!Ruth, Phoenix
990;I had a little difficulty getting into it in the beginning, but as it moved along I totally got it and liked it.
991;I really recommend this movie to anyone looking for good commedy when you may laugh and cry at the same moment.
992;Best viewed with a loved person, especialy when you are same type as mr. udall :)
993;This was a very entertaining movie.
994;Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt have a great chemistry that make this movie a lot of fun to watch.
995;The scenes between Greg Kinear and Jack Nicholson are fantastic!
996;I love the scenes with Helen Hunt and Greg Kinear in the hotel room.
997;The chemistry is just perfect.
998;Price was right and the packing was perfect.
999;I received the package in good time and was appreciative about everything about the video.
1000;Jack Nicholson continues to confound me: His Oscar.
1001;performance in As Good As it Gets is incredible.
1002;Still, the commentary is enjoyable, and this film is a real gem.
1003;Nicholson starts out as such a miseable human being, along the way he learns tolerance, love and compassion.
1004;Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear add to the magic with the touching scene at the motel when she takes a bath.
1005;Wonderful, a real treat for intelligent people.
1006;Somehow Helen Hunt manages to stand up to the power of Jack Nicholson in this role .
1007;But she does, and she does it well.
1008;She's got a severely asthmatic son, and when caring for him causes her to miss work, Nicholson steps in as the fairy godfather.
1009;Most of his stuff is memorable and this is one of those that shows him well
1010;loved the character Nicholson played in this movie.
1011;I don't normally like this kinda movie, but this movie was surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch.
1012;This movie is a all time favorite movie of mine.
1013;He is just perfect for the part.
1014;As good as it gets is no exception in that it is vintage Jack Nicholson.
1015;Very entertaining comedy that will go down as one of Nicholson's best since he did win an oscar for it.
1016;A must see for any Nicholson fan.
1017;Jack Nicholoson gives a tour de force performance as Melvin Udall, a successful novelist who has obsessive compulsion disorder.
1018;Melvin also has to put up with Simon (Greg Kinnear) his neighbor.
1019;The movie gets a little sappy at the end, but the movie is so well acted, you can forgive director James L. Brooks for this.
1020;Mr. Nicholson is at his curmudgeonly best.
1021;He burns up the screen overtime he appears and gives the most comically performance of his career.
1022;Ms. Hunt is both sweet and tough as she keeps pace most of the time with Mr. Nicholson.
1023;Mr. Kinnear gives a breakout performance in his role.
1024;Mr. Nicholson won his third Oscar for the role and Ms. Hunt took home her first.
1025;I love this movie, awesome characters, a super cast, very emotional a bit of drama and a real happy end.
1026;It brings me great peace!
1027;The acting and the scenarios were memorable and brought me great comfort!
1028;one of the greatest comedies of not only the 90s, but perhaps of all time.
1029;sharp, witty, and satirical with praise.
1030;worthy performances from all cast members.
1031;compulsive disorder and a heart of stone (or what you may first think).
1032;her name is Carol Connelly and she's a single mother to an asthmatic young son.
1033;She temporarily leaves work to take care of her child.
1034;Melvin's new babysitting job, along with Carol's absence from the diner, means that life is changing .
1035;aS GOOD AS IT GETS is an enlightening comedy that the majority of critics agreed with.
1036;But, as this film progresses, we find that the characters, played by each of the actors with such grace and such astounding skill, are anything but ordinary.
1037;This fine film deserved every bit of praise it received from the critics and audiences alike.
1038;aS GOOD AS IT GETS is one of those scarce treasures that finds the perfect and ideally comfortable balance between seriousness and humor.
1039;As good as it gets is a lovely movie. . . . . . . . . . .
1040;One of my favorite movies of my life.
1041;Everytime somebody asks me about my favorite movies, I always mention 'As good as it gets'.
1042;I still remember the first time I saw this movie.
1043;A friend had told me about this film, and how much he liked it, so I decided to go to the movie theater.
1044;This movie is full of great scenes with great acting by all of the actors.
1045;Nicholson, Hunt, Kinnear, and even those who briefly appear in this film, are very good, like Cuba Gooding Jr, for instance.
1046;Even the dog has its moments!
1047;By the time the movie ended, I wasn't down anymore, I felt great, and I could tell that it had the same effect on other people too.
1048;Love Nicholson's acting, and Helen Hunt is superb.
1049;I absolutely love this movie, with it human foibles and awkward romances.
1050;This is one of the great all.
1051;Thought we should own it so we can enjoy it whenever the mood overcomes us.
1052;This is one of my favorite movies.
1053;I have and can watch it over and over again.
1054;I will go watch anything with Jack in it.
1055;These actors did an EXCELLENT job!
1056;Love, hate, dread, fear, sorrow, joy.
1057;I enjoyed it a lot and will recommend it to my friends who maybe haven't seen it.
1058;As Good As it Gets was one of the best films of 1997.
1059;Jack Nicholson serves up one of his best roles yet, and Helen Hunt is excellent.
1060;Greg Kinnear perhaps has the best performance of all, yet went unrewarded.
1061;The characters are well rounded and flawed, and the interaction is very realistic.
1062;Definitely a nice edition of the film, but the extras are nothing special.
1063;This is essentially a good movie that is graced by an absolutely stellar performance by one of America's great film actors.
1064;Jack Nicholson has had several performances as memorable as this one, but he has never had one that was appreciably better.
1065;and she immediately shouted, Grandpa!
1066;the brilliant thing about this movie is that it doesn't just stop with a character with a serious social.
1067;Partly this is done through his unexpected relationship with a neighbor's small dog.
1068;But she is able to accept his affection, with all his limitations as a person.
1069;It isn't the Disney version, but it is all rather lovely.
1070;the cast is by and large excellent.
1071;Both Nicholson and Helen Hunt won Oscars for their performances.
1072;But the picture is carried by two superb performances by Nicholson and Hunt.
1073;During times when it seems like you can't make a comedy without exploiting the handicapped or having bodily fluids fly around (like the Farrelly Brothers movies) or when having intercourse with American Pies is considered witty, and when everything else is a re.
1074;hash of the juvenile Porky's films of the '80s, As Good as it Gets stands out as one better comedies of the last 20 years.
1075;It is a genuine attempt to derive humor out of genuine human emotions and situations, and it succeeds most of the time.
1076;What's worth going over is the job the actors have done.
1077;Nicholson, who has basically been playing parodies of himself since The Shining, actually reveals a human side to his maniacal persona.
1078;Helen Hunt is endearing, outraged and hilarious, all at the same time.
1079;My favorite moment is when she curses out her HMO.
1080;Greg Kinnear's eyes are so full of tears most of the time, that you are urged to throw Kleenex at the screen, yet this makes his more humorous moments all the more funny.
1081;You watch it once or twice, and then you have to put it away for a while.
1082;still, the title of As Good as it Gets is very modest.
1083;This movie is better than what we usually get.
1084;well written and well executed.
1085;it's worth the great price i paid to amazon
1086;This is one of my favorite movies with Jack N.
1087;Great acting, humor and pathos, and even has a dog who can act!
1088;I loved loved this movie.
1089;I would strongly recommend this movie .
1090;Jack Nicholson did an excellent job.
1091;Am a fan of Nicholson and Hunt, Nicholson, as always was exceptional in his role.
1092;If you want to see Jack Nicholson in one of his best performances, showcasing the craft at its best, then you have to see As Good As It Gets.
1093;And while the story isn't about anything exceptional, except for usual circumstances in life, the characters are highly interesting, especially Nicholson's and Kinnear's characters.
1094;It's just a joy to watch great acting in this cute little story, and to relax as you watch this 2+ hour comedy.
1095;Helen Hunt is also doing a great job and she fits well into this triangle.
1096;I think it portrays nasty people as dynamic beings capable of gaining human decency and even a wonderful lover like Helen Hunt's character.
1097;sadistic character but can nail a satan portrayal oddly enough (The Witches of Eastwick).
1098;The other reviewers are right!
1099;She plays the samehateful character in every movie
1100;Never!Everyone and Everything else about this movie is perfection.
1101;I love a good movie with characters of ordinary people.
1102;How the lives of these opposite type people come together and connect is well written and well acted.
1103;A very funny movie about ordinary strangers coming together.
1104;Great movie, can watch it over and over!
1105;Funny and heart warming and Verdle takes the show!
1106;this movie is one of my all time favorite movies .
1107;i absolutely love this movie.
1108;jack Nicholson is the best in this movie .
1109;beautiful movie with a great story
1110;nicholson portrays the role perfectly.
1111;If you love Jack Nicholson, you will LOVE this movie.
1112;He is classic!This movie is just the perfect feel.
1113;style movie stars, in the John Wayne manner.
1114;But at the same time he's irresistible, so we understand and approve when the beautiful young heroine falls in love with him.
1115;They're both terrific, and together they're even more so.
1116;This is probably the last best role for Jack Nicholson.
1117;This is a fun movie with a timeless message to accept people where they are at and to enjoy life as it comes along.
1118;A very funny and dramatic film.
1119;It's one of those movies that just makes you smile.
1120;It's a relaxing film starring Shirly Knight, Harold Ramis, Cuba Gooding Jr., Greg Kinnear, Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson.
1121;When Carol does not show up to work to take care of her son Melvin does something that is very kind in one respect and a little freaky and selfish in another.
1122;Melvin provides Carol's son with a very expensive personal doctor who finally helps her son to get over his sickness and resume normal ten.year.
1123;appealing personality and his derogatory comments toward Simon.
1124;Besides that it was an interesting story with some far fetched characters and personal interactions.
1125;Helen Hunt is at the top of her game.
1126;It's interesting to hear some of the differences of opinion between the director and the actors.
1127;This was one of my favorites when it first came out, and remains one of my favorites even years later.
1128;Jack Nicholson is at his best, with perfect timing, nuance, and pathology that is both maddening and endearing.
1129;Greg Kineer does a perfect portrayal of a gay character who becomes Helen's pal and Jack's roommate.
1130;If this isn't the best film ever made, it's at least among the top ten.
1131;Opening with him disposing of the dog, Nicholson sets the tone of the film in its first moments.
1132;That this realization comes through waitress Helen Hunt is what gives this film an additional fillip of humanity.
1133;Learning of her son Spencer's asthmatic condition, he provides help with the only resource he can give .
1134;The exploration is fraught with feints, mis.
1135;steps and errors, but he continues the effort.
1136;classifying this film as a comedy is due mainly to Nicholson's ability to deliver stinging one.
1137;it is, of course, Helen Hunt who emerges as the wonderful surprise as an unexpected talent as the single mother struggling for survival.
1138;Her Academy Award was richly deserved.
1139;Great movie, well worth your time and money.
1140;It was a competitive year with Titanic, L. a. Confidential and Good Will Hunting also in the running.
1141;it's hard to choose pinpoint Nicholson's top performance with so many candidates to choose from, but this has to rank among his best and he thoroughly deserved his third Oscar win.
1142;In contrast, one of his favorite people is Carol (Hunt).
1143;Carol puts on a brave face at work, but she has to deal with her sick son on a daily basis and it's a heavy burden.
1144;nicholson is such a good actor and has incredible range.
1145;Think back to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for an example of how he can inject comedy into serious drama.
1146;Carol is a positive influence and is the main reason he tries to change.
1147;nicholson makes us believe that a 60.
1148;old man with psychological problems is capable of attracting a woman in her early 30s.
1149;He also shows plenty of comedic ability and times everything well.
1150;The interplay between the three characters is fascinating and comes to a head when they take a trip together.
1151;the film contains some of the best dialogue I have heard.
1152;Some scenes will bring you close to tears while others will make you laugh.
1153;deserved Oscars went to Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinnear offered terrific support as well in this gem of a film.
1154;This is the kind of film that can be watched multiple times and one still finds things to enjoy in it.
1155;this is a truly moving film with real life like characters that we grow to appreciate if not love.
1156;My wife and I love it every time we watch it.
1157;Nicholson is reliable and believable as always, and Helen Hunt is so much better than she's often given credit for being.
1158;She is smart, beautiful, relatable, and enormously talented.
1159;this movie soars on every level.
1160;This film is as good as it gets it.
1161;If you're a movie buff this is a great movie to add to your collection.
1162;Still makes me laugh and cry after all these years
1163;As Good As It Gets is a rarity among today's movies, a truly witty and poignant romantic comedy with an unusual protagonist.
1164;That protagonist is Melvin, played with relish by Jack Nicholson.
1165;Melvin is a highly successful novelist who is also an abrasive misanthrope suffering from severe obsessive.
1166;Melvin also becomes reluctantly involved with the pretty and patient waitress Carol, played by Helen Hunt, who serves him breakfast every day at a local cafe.
1167;Melvin increasingly finds himself drawn into Carol's personal life, and he eventually falls for the plucky single mom.
1168;As Good As It Gets is a quirky update of the fable Beauty and the Beast .
1169;director James L. Brooks has assembled a superb cast to re.
1170;Besides the pitch perfect lead performances by Nicholson, Hunt, and Kinnear, there are sparkling supporting performances by Cuba Gooding Jr., Shirley Knight and others.
1171;As Good As It Gets reminds us that there are still a few determined filmmakers willing to bring qualities such as intelligence, inventiveness, sophistication, and charm back to the silver screen.
1172;I give this movie 5 stars because of its content.
1173;all the emotions are covered and it is one of my favorites!
1174;It is one of those movies that you have to watch many times to absorb all the beauty and meaning of it.
1175;Jack Nicholson is fabulous in this movie, this is some of his absolute best work, besides the movie The Shining.
1176;Nicholson is beyond stunning in this movie.
1177;this movie has hilarity, gravity, significance, and emotion all rolled into one.
1178;have to any worthy movie collection.
1179;And Jack plays the most perfect A. hole!
1180;I really enjoyed this movie.
1181;Jack Nicholson was a natural as usual and I also enjoyed Helen Hunt's peformance.
1182;The story was about a grumpy romance writer becoming happy and falling in love.
1183;The script is fun and the movie is incredibly funny.
1184;I highly recommend this movie.
1185;As Good As It gets is one of the best movies from the 1990's.
1186;Winner of the Oscar for Best Picture (1997), the film garnered Jack Nicholson another Academy Award for Best Actor and won Helen Hent the Oscar for Best Actress.
1187;Melvin also has the mouth of a sewer and isn't overly friendly, but while babysitting a neighbor's dog, and with the help of a kind and outgoing waitress, Melvin realizes the true meaning of friendship and how people are suppose to act with each other.
1188;Everything about the movie jells, from the acting to the direction along with an excellent script.
1189;The movie co. stars Greg Kinnear as the gay neighbor and was directed by James L. Brooks.
1190;The disc, which is double sided, comes with both full and widescreen formats, commentary, and more.
1191;There is also an informative booklet that accompanies the set.
1192;As Good As It Gets is a superb portrayal of a man, Melvin Udall (played marvelously by Jack Nicholson) with a debilitating condition that restricts his daily life and interactions.
1193;He compulsively engages in these activities.
1194;sitting for his incredibly inconvenient gay artist neighbor (Greg Kinnear in a superb supporting role).
1195;as Good As It Gets boasts a splendid, delightful combination of wonderful, zesty acting and a remarkably bright and effective screenplay.
1196;Kinnear's character Simon has the distinct purpose in being both the bridge and the divider of Nicholson and Hunt's relationship, and he identifies with his character with compassion and understanding, as he has frequently been wronged throughout his existence.
1197;The best romantic comedy, certainly one of the best films of 1997, As Good As It Gets succeeds in practically every entertaining and endearing cinematic respect.
1198;Reminds me of the solid, classic films from the 1950's.
1199;This is perhaps the only film I enjoy Helen Hunt.
1200;Verdeel, the dog, is the star.
1201;The ending is believable, and still amazing.
1202;Watch it if you love old films.
1203;It deserves the awards that it won.
1204;Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson are both great in these roles.
1205;The main character is honest at all times.
1206;As Good As It Gets shows us that even those people we deem monsters have hearts.
1207;Those people are often more sensitive than the rest of us.
1208;The best part of As Good As It Gets is that you will laugh from opening reel to closing credits.
1209;As Good as it Gets provides an enjoyable film for any movie library.
1210;Helen Hunt is a rare treat since she doesn't appear in too many films.
1211;Greg Kinnear provides a fabulous gay neighbor .
1212;He won the Oscar (as did Helen) .
1213;This movie is funny and serious at the same time.
1214;Jack Nicholson does a great job as Mr. Udall.
1215;Helen Hunt and Greg Kinear make a great team as down and out people who come together through a very unusual way.
1216;He was the best on talk soup
1217;In As Good As It Gets he puts in a sparkling performance.
1218;Well, no disresepct to Nicholson, he is perfect for the part.
1219;The Oscar he won was deserving.
1220;Kinnear puts in a fine performance, in my opinion worthy of an Oscar.
1221;Both are fragile people, and in the end find strength in each other.
1222;this is a truly remarkable film.
1223;It's extremely funny, touching and has a great cast.
1224;good movie for the ages.
1225;This is a great movie that will never get old.
1226;It's a heartwarming story and the actors really make it stand out.
1227;As it is a great addition to your movie collection.
1228;This was a movie that I have watched several times and loved it just as much as the first time I watched it.
1229;even though Jack doesn't want anyone to know how attached he has gotten to the little dog that was foisted on him, the love and care he gives the dog is endearing.
1230;helen is a compassionate waitress who has become a necessity to Jack's feeling of well.
1231;He has to have her be his waitress, much to the relief of the other waitresses.
1232;the interaction between the cast of characters and the budding romance between Jack and Helen make this an endearing movie that will remain in our thoughts and hearts for years to come.
1233;loved this movie when it was first released and bought it on laserdisc at the time.
1234;price is high, but the movie has never looked this good before
1235;Jack is one of the best actors I have ever seen.
1236;But Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear did a good job with the young boy actor adding his abilities to the plot line.
1237;I enjoyed this movie , it shows compassion, trust and honesty in humans and animals.
1238;Best Jack Nicholson ever and Helen Hunt is wonderfu as.
1239;Greg Kineer (sp) is terrific.
1240;Heartwarming, funny and always entertaining.
1241;Somebody should tell them their actors first, movie stars second.
1242;This movie definitely is (quote title) insofar as it reaches.
1243;excellence at every level: dialogue constantly surprising and delightful.
1244;Good movie from beginning to end.
1245;All the celebrities in this movie are great at what they do.
1246;I think Jack, Helen and Greg and the dog have perfect chemistry in this tale of misfits whose relationships, forced at first, turn out to be life.
1247;Nicholson thrills me here, and while I generally respect his work, he can be a little much in some of his performances.
1248;I think this is a film which will gain even more affection and respect from the masses as it ages.
1249;The dog goes a long way to making this movie as entertaining as it is besides the fine performances by Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and the neighbour.
1250;I held off seeing this movie up until last month as I don't like Helen Hunt's acting style but after seeing this I thought she did a fine job.
1251;'As Good As It gets' is a very refreshing movie although drags a little in the middle.
1252;A friend wants to get one just like it.
1253;Now slipping into classic status, it showcases Nicholson at his up Yours!
1254;helen Hunt gives nothing up and stays right with him in a beautiful portrayal of an emotionally battered woman who refuses to disengage or surrender to despair.
1255;time favorite movies, it is so funny.
1256;Nicholson won Best Actor for his performance of an obsessive.
1257;The story is full of extra, smaller stories that made the movie a rich watch.
1258;Watch it a second time and see new things.
1259;The characters are full and the comedy is sometimes sad.
1260;I love laughter through tears.
1261;A key moment in the film is when Simon, Melvin's gay neighbour (Greg Kinnear), is telling the young male prostitute, Vincent (Skeet Ulrich), about his art, and comments that he likes to watch people because sometimes, when you look at someone long enough, you see their humanity.
1262;the theme is developed sensitively and beautifully throughout the course of the film (perhaps only slightly overlong at more than two hours), with help coming from a fourth character, Verdelle, a dog, whose pivotal role in the narrative is easily overlooked (standing in the same cinematic tradition as Toto of The Wizard of Oz).
1263;By the end of the film, we are aware that the big issues in the character's lives are still to be totally overcome, but the process of resolution has begun as it should, with the characters each recognizing the dignity and worth of the others (and themselves).
1264;james L. Brook's delicate direction carefully avoids excessive sentimentalism and saccharine sweetness (though admittedly, it teeters perilously close to the edge at times), and results in one of the most charming and profound comedies of recent years.
1265;4 Phenomenal Actors make this movie, and the irresistible Brussels Griffon brings them all together.
1266;Cuba is just amazing, the best role hes ever played.
1267;Greg (Kinnear) won an Academy Award for this film and deserves it wholeheartedly!
1268;I think I loved him best!
1269;Would recommend watching this movie if you can't find anything else to watch.
1270;It arrived in great shape and on time, and he is very happy with it.
1271;This is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in the last three.
1272;It has a good message, that is tastefully presented.
1273;only bits and pieces of it with the usual Hollywood happy ending.
1274;Still, I love this film.
1275;After this one, Jack Nicholson can safely retire, because his role in AGAIG is.
1276;as good as it gets.
1277;Helen Hunt was exceptionally good, as were Cuba Gooding Jr. and Greg Kinnear in their respective roles.
