I:448;1;In The Libertine, director Laurence Dunmore brings to life the Restoration period, the court of King Charles 11 in all its glory.
I:448;2;meanwhile, Wilmot strikes up a friendship with Barry.
I:448;3;But she's sassy, and is dedicated to her art, and is also uninterested in anything the earl has to offer.
I:448;4;this final passion proves both his deliverance and his ruin.
I:448;5;the art direction is absolutely gorgeous and the film really makes you believe you are living in the grim and stodgy murkiness of 17th century London.
I:448;6;Depp does indeed give a bravura performance, he really manages to capture Wilmot's single.
I:448;7;mercurial and refreshing in her ability to cut through what is basically a Johnny Depp vehicle is the great Samantha Morton as Elizabeth Barry, the courageous actress.
I:448;8;training who really craves the love of an audience more than the love of a man.
I:448;9;with all its faults, The Libertine is still an entertaining movie.
I:448;10;This movie is yet another tribute to the amazing breath of acting talent of Johnny Depp.
I:448;11;His protrayal of John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester, is simply brilliant.
I:448;12;When the film came out it did not get high reviews from the film critiques of the day, but I found it entertaining and a solid fantasy to spend a few hours with, Particularly if you are a fan of Depp.
I:448;13;Great supporting cast as well.
I:448;14;he was also something of a literary genius, whose poetry posthumously gained such admirers as Daniel Defoe, Alfred Lord Tennyson and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
I:448;15;if you like period pieces, this will be sure to titillate you, as will Depp's outstanding performance.
I:448;16;The film is chock full of elaborate costumes, staging and realistic period scenery.
I:448;17;But it's hardly the greatest film I've ever seen.
I:448;18;And if you want something more uplifting, stick with Rosamund Pike's rendition of Jane in the latest film production of Austen's Pride and Prejudice.
I:448;19;Despite the critics review I found it very interesting and loved Johnny's performance, it is definatly one of his best and darkest roles.
I:448;20;Samantha is also very very good and plays the passionate actress better than Jane Eyre any day.
I:448;21;If you are grossed out easily I wouldn't suggest this movie, but if you are a hard core Johnny fan suck it up and watch it.
I:448;22;This was a great story and of course great acting.
I:448;23;It an astounding piece of work, front to back, beginning to end.
I:448;24;A Tour De Force that all who participated in should be proud of for the rest of their days.
I:448;25;This is a heavy, hard hitting, humourous and brutally honest story, told by true professionals at their peak.
I:448;26;Still, I liked the way it set the mood and I understand the director wanted this effect .
I:448;27;Speaking of which, JOHNNY DEPP is dazzling.
I:448;28;An amazing actor, he never ceases to amaze me with his talent.
I:448;29;The writing is witty and he carries off his lines expertly.
I:448;30;The make up work portraying the decaying Rochester is superb.
I:448;31;This is a fine film and I recommend it, but only for the extremely mature due to the wicked subject matter.
I:448;32;I'm a Johnny Depp fan.
I:448;33;He did a great job at playing John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester.
I:448;34;Johnny Depp did a great job of letting us know something was rattling around in his head.
I:448;35;If that is part of the reason they're making the movie, to showcase an artist that wasn't afraid to write the King of England a pornographic play, then why was the director was afraid of being honest to the character?I enjoyed this movie more after I watched the special features.
I:448;36;He was really something in Pirates.
I:448;37;But Johnny Depp is great in The Libertine.
I:448;38;Ample proof once again that he is his generation's most underrated actor.
I:448;39;His performance here should have garnered a 2nd consecutive year of Oscar nomination.
I:448;40;This is a compelling film for all but a must.
I:448;41;see for all Depp fans.
I:448;42;as to depp's performance, it was worthy of an academy award.
I:448;43;Still, I can give The Libertine a second viewing for reevaluation and see how it stands against time.
I:448;44;Perhaps he was never a great actor to start with.
I:448;45;"I do love the introduction, and I love the way how The Libertine ended especially when Johnny Depp slowly fades out and saying at the same time, ""Do you like me now?"
I:448;46;As a matter of fact, there is a serious possibility that Johnny Depp studied Tim Roth's performance of Rob Roy and made a pastiche out of his work for Wilmot's character.
I:448;47;"Another ""probably"" is Johnny Depp may have studied Laurence Olivier's performance from Richard III."
I:448;48;Regardless, I am a big Johnny Depp fan, and I applaud his impressive repertoire of films as odd as they are.
I:448;49;The Libertine is a great, great example of why his performance was just full of hollowness yet attractive.
I:448;50;He was more improved and more dramatic than the first half of the picture, but he showed reminiscence of what Daniel Day.
I:448;51;well, much of the picture was fine.
I:448;52;The meaner Johnny is, the better.
I:448;53;Oh yes, before I forget, pretty please.
I:448;54;This film is about the English Restoration in general and John Earl of Rochester in particular, but it's also about art and the ways in which life and literature .
I:448;55;It's beautifully acted (Samantha Morton astonishes!)
I:448;56;the play in the movie was wonderful
I:448;57;Johnny Depp gives another sterling performance, this time as John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester, and there are strong performances by John Malkovich and Samantha Morton, but overall, the movie is dark and disturbing.
I:448;58;There's good dialogue in this movie, realistic settings and great costuming.
I:448;59;If you want to watch experienced and talented actors performing at their best with an intellectual script, this movie is a good choice.
I:448;60;A person somewhat resembling the divine Marquis de Sade, the pair of them strike me as self.
I:448;61;Although I see their point, there's no percentage to it: since we're here, we might as well make the best of it and try to be pleasant to each other, as well as ourselves.
I:448;62;Life's a jest and all things show it, so let's have a laugh now and then.
I:448;63;Yes, the film was creatively shot, rather well.
I:448;64;acted, and the script makes you think.
I:448;65;The Director's commentary well communicates the thought behind the product.
I:448;66;First of all, let me start by saying that the only reason I didn't give this movie 1 star is because the acting was good.
I:448;67;"Whatever your historical take on the man, he certainly was ""interesting."""
I:448;68;even when accompanied by great camera work.
I:448;69;He's creepy, delivers lines like a razor, and immerses us in this unsettled man's life.
I:448;70;But the story is only entertaining thanks to Depp's portrayal.
I:448;71;for some (as mentioned previously), the excellent lighting, dizzying camera pans of the theater, and dark sets will make this film pure eye.
I:448;72;"But there needs to be more than just good filming
I:448;73;The rated R rating is light.
I:448;74;Some time it takes a second viewing to really write a more Acurate review.
I:448;75;but on my second viewing I thought it was one of his best roles ever.
I:448;76;samatha Morten was extremely good.
I:448;77;"And John Malkovich was actually alsovery good as King Charles II and wise and amusing and honestly helpfuland loyal to his friend The ""Earl Of Rockchester"" whom Johnny protrayedwith such passion that I even searched out some books on that real man."
I:448;78;But Johnny Depp stole the show and was hard to like but by the end I was hooked onhim and his speechs and the humor was fantastic.
I:448;79;And wickedly humorous and temptingly sexy with a equal engaging profane wit.
I:448;80;At times it's witty and highly intellectual while at other times, or should I say most of the time perverse, sordid and depraved.
I:448;81;As usual it's another brilliant performance by Johnny Depp and if you're a fan that likes to study the nuances of his roles, a history buff who studies period pieces, or a student of film in general you'll probably want to see this film.
I:448;82;there are moments of incredible insight and brilliance to be found in 'The Libertine' but I'm not sure if it's worth absorbing all the depressive hopelessness and nihilism in this film to arrive at those few brief and shining moments.
I:448;83;on monologue will hook you in and take you on a wild ride of foppish wigs.
I:448;84;The story is riveting for its portrayal of a totally honest yet ultimately doomed character in the Earl of Rochester (Johnny Depp).
I:448;85;"The smoky, foggy streets of London's past are well created here and the whole movie exists in a darkness only lit by candlelight that allows you to immerse yourself within the story without being distracted by the ""effects."
I:448;86;Like any other movie he is in Johnny Depp puts forth an amazing performance.
I:448;87;His transformation from a young, healthy, well respected yet hated writer to a decaying, dying, loathed creature is true brilliance.
I:448;88;This movie is definitely worthy of being in anyone's movie library.
I:448;89;Laurence Dunmore's The Libertine features award worthy performances by all three of its principal players.
I:448;90;Johnny Depp gives an incredible performance as Rochester as do Samantha Morton as Elizabeth Barry and John Malkovich as Charles II.
I:448;91;Wilmot was a man of great talent who persisted in throwing it all away.
I:448;92;The production design by Ben Van Os and costume design by Dien Van Straalen evoke the Restoration period quite well.
I:448;93;The cinematography by Alexander Melman is unique in that it is mostly handheld and is lit with natural and candlelight rather than more modern source lighting.
I:448;94;The Libertine is a wonderful piece of cinema.
I:448;95;Fantastic mood, which really draws you in.
I:448;96;wonderful cinematographie, sets and costumes.
I:448;97;While his may seem a sad one, it is a life lived on his terms.
I:448;98;In our world of PC and positive, happy.
I:448;99;happy fakery it is actually refreshing to see someone go all.
I:448;100;depp is brilliant, as usual.
I:448;101;Samantha Morton is an added highlight to this mature film.
I:448;102;Though it could be seen as crude, look past this and see a piece of yourself in the Earl.
I:448;103;I had wanted to see this movie for a long time after several failed attempts from the studio that distributed it is finally here and all I can say is that I'am glad that I finally got to see it.
I:448;104;This movie is brilliant in every way I thought.
I:448;105;The film's dark tones is perfect for the period which is the 17th century if I'am not mistaking.
I:448;106;The costumes that the actors wear in the movie are great and of the time.
I:448;107;The writing and directing of the film is exquisite.
I:448;108;Everyone in the cast did a very good job the supporting actors were all believable in their roles and John Malkovich as always did a splending job this time in the role of King Charles II, Now, the real reason to see this movie is because of one actor and one actor only, JOHNNY DEPP.
I:448;109;He is beyond spectacular and his performance is above all surreal and extraordinary.
I:448;110;As a huge Depp fan that I'am I've always loved Johnny's movies because he is an actor of innate talent and wisdom.
I:448;111;He has done some great work in the past (Blow, Donnie Brasco, The Ninth Gate, Before Night Falls and Charlie and The Chocolate Factory to name a few.)
I:448;112;The Libertine is thus far his greatest performance capture on film I believe and the transformation that his character John Wilmot,(The Earl of Rochester) undergoes towards the end of the movie is beyond belief.
I:448;113;up that they used on his face is incredible and completely believeable.
I:448;114;The Oscar should of been given to Johnny for his masterful performance.
I:448;115;You will really enjoy it I think and if you don't well I won't criticize you because everyone has their own opinion and are allowed not to like a movie if they choose to go that route.
I:448;116;"If you like Johnny Depp as an actor you will love him in ""The Libertine"" and if you don't like him, well."
I:448;117;if you go see this film his performance will probably change your mind.
I:448;118;i saw this in the theater, and I thought it was brilliant.
I:448;119;Johnny Depp's characterization of John Wilmot was amazing.
I:448;120;I would like to add, unlike most, that I found this a tightly crafted work that is a beautifully balanced ensemble.
I:448;121;if you have ever been at a party where there is one guy who says what everyone thinks but fears to say in case of social reprisal, you have an idea how captivating someone walking on the edge can be.
I:448;122;It is powerful and seductive, dark and heavy, thought provoking and disturbing, painful and hypnotic, horrifying and humanizing.
I:448;123;I found this to be just such a work.
I:448;124;This film captures the atmosphere of 17th Century London during the Restoration of Charles II.
I:448;125;John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester, played wonderfully by Johnny Depp, is the subject of a dark play driven by the Nihilism and atheism of the poet and playwright.
I:448;126;Wilmot demonstrates his skills in a wild orgy satire equating the sexual appetite of Charles II with political power.
I:448;127;With his exceptional intelligence, wit, and verbal skills, Wilmot can cut through any joy or inspiration to find the base and futile.
I:448;128;john Wilmot, as a young man, abducts a beautiful and rich 18 year old heiress as his wife.
I:448;129;This part of the film is very good and his elegant and caring wife is in many ways the moral compass or anchor for the film by which we can see the pain Wilmot brings to him and to others.
I:448;130;wilmot has around him artists of a wild streak who are his fair weather and back.
I:448;131;Into this group comes a handsome young 18 year old man who is drawn to this dark group and especially to John Wilmot.
I:448;132;Gradually during the film you see that Wilmot is bi.
I:448;133;toy who pays a tragic price for being a handsome moth circling a heartless flame.
I:448;134;however it is Wilmot's relationship to a young ambitious actress that provides wonderful dialogue around the theme of artifice and reality as Wilmot becomes her acting coach.
I:448;135;Samantha Morton plays actress Lizzy Barry, who becomes a great actress through her emotional encounters with John Wilmot.
I:448;136;It is to her credit that she allows the veil to fall and for her vulnerability to emerge, and yet to have the strength of the artist to use this insight to apply to her art.
I:448;137;As he gradually disintegrates and self destructs, she emerges triumphant through her self.
I:448;138;He sees worldly success as a joke at best and an illusion.
I:448;139;She sees his cynicism as fruitless and self.
I:448;140;the film is full of beautifully designed scenes such as the Earl and Countess having a portrait painted in her palatial home and the mad.
I:448;141;But when viewed from a distance (a. k. a. the audience's perspective) his bold, uncompromising attitude is an incredibly fascinating sight to behold.
I:448;142;Rarely do we encounter anyone who's willing to be so unapologetically blunt with his or her thoughts and feelings.
I:448;143;But to a degree, I did admire him.
I:448;144;He lived his life exactly how he wanted to live it, and never mind the consequences.
I:448;145;destructive binge of women and alcohol, I still got the feeling that he knew exactly what he was doing.
I:448;146;His work is absolutely loaded with insights and opinions on sex and pleasure, every line laced with risqu' words and descriptions.
I:448;147;"King Charles II (John Malkovich) needs Rochester to produce a new play
I:448;148;"A French nobleman who attends this performance turns to Charles and says with a humorous air, ""That's very amusing, because in France he would be executed for this."""
I:448;149;He first sees her as she gives a performance (which was cut short when the audience booed her off stage while throwing fruit).
I:448;150;"He seems genuinely taken by her personality, which isn't that far removed from his own
I:448;151;he resolves to make her the greatest and most envied actress London has ever seen.
I:448;152;I found their interactions during those scenes to be very cleverly structured, each line bringing subtle yet meaningful ideas to the surface where the audience can take them in.
I:448;153;It then becomes an interesting method of interpretation, getting you to try and figure out what exactly the two are saying to each other.
I:448;154;There is deeper attraction brewing, a fact that makes character judgments all but impossible.
I:448;155;She's well aware of her husband's unpopular ideals and unabashed infidelity, and she certainly doesn't approve of how he lives his life.
I:448;156;"I suppose part of that has to do with the seduction that brought her to him in the first place
I:448;157;"this is but one level of character complexity that pleasantly surprised me about ""The Libertine"" (truth be told, a lot of things about this movie surprised me, including Johnny Depp's brilliantly dark performance)."
I:448;158;handed material may turn some viewers off (so to speak), it still is a thought provoking and oddly witty portrayal of human behavior.
I:448;159;After writing a play that greatly affects the king, he is driven into exile.
I:448;160;the film itself is decent.
I:448;161;His acting is fine, and everybody else is just kind of there.
I:448;162;I did enjoy the visit to the theatre world of that time and place.
I:448;163;to me the most amusing thing about this film was imagining those girls who went to see their heartthrob, Johnny Depp, walking out of the theater.
I:448;164;"Hugh Hefner and the Rolling Stones still get all the young girls they want, so ""The Libertine"" is really just peddling a female fantasy."
I:448;165;After King Charles II lifts the banishment from London on Wilmot, he hopes the poet will return to the stage with a masterpiece.
I:448;166;Depp is splendid, and though Wilmot's character is despicable, we can't stop watching.
I:448;167;The tale comes to a sad end, but it is a beautifully written story of love and loss.
I:448;168;Samantha Morton and Rosamund Pike are fiercely quiet but strong.
I:448;169;The production is still first rate.
I:448;170;the Libertine is still worth seeing because it provokes a lot of thought about life, death, history, change.
I:448;171;Most movies have something worth seeing if they respect their audience.
I:448;172;These try and mostly succeed.
I:448;173;This is one of Johnny Depp's best performances.
I:448;174;This movie is very intense and emotional.
I:448;175;The whole cast is brilliant and the make.
I:448;176;This is a very entertaining film with great acting.
I:448;177;The story is slightly OTT but has some great moments in it, especially between Johnny Depp (a great performance from him) and either John Malkovich or Samantha Morton, who are also outstanding.
I:448;178;this story draws you in and in places repels, but it's very entertaining and pretty dark.
I:448;179;I enjoyed the sets and costumes and the acting even more so.
I:448;180;Wilmot was a remarkable figure in literary history.
I:448;181;He was able to combine the debauchery of the time and with the sensitivty of Wilmot, after he finally found love.
I:448;182;I can only salute Johnny Depp for his perormance.
I:448;183;This should have had an Oscar nomination at the very least.
I:448;184;C'mon, I agree, Jack Sparrow is cute but anyone who knows anything about Wilmot, Dryden, or Shakespeare has probably been moved to the depths by Depp's portrayal of Wilmot.
I:448;185;Although this movie is not for the faint of heart, or for those who are only fans of Depp's looks and not literary hisory, it is a real tribute to the writers of an incredibly bawdy, yet remarkable era and to Depp as the greatest actor of our time.
I:448;186;i believe this is a movie about relationships.
I:448;187;however, if you enjoy history, appreciate fine acting, and the subject matter doesn't offend you.
I:448;188;Johnny Depp has done better.
I:448;189;Johnny Depp delivers another tour de force performance.
I:448;190;If you're a Depp fan (and I am) you'll enjoy this movie.
I:448;191;when asked what is my favorite film of all time, my answer is The Libertine.
I:448;192;loathing that also captures Depp at his most physically beautiful.
I:448;193;This is my third watch, with each view as captivating as the first.
I:448;194;This is an extraordinarily brave, intense, inspired movie with brilliant performances, exquisite writing, real ambiance and understanding of the dangerous, ambiguous, eloquent yet foggy, muddy world of 17th Century England.
I:448;195;held camera work, graininess, natural lighting, and scene.
I:448;196;orientated storyline, is to miss the attraction and power in its raw dark corners, creativity, intelligence, wit and provoking theme of reason versus redemption.
I:448;197;Through the sincerity of its cinematography it takes a chance on starkly displaying the world, history, love, religion, good and evil, self.
I:448;198;the whole cast, the soundtrack, the settings and costumes are superb.
I:448;199;But the master of its brilliance is Johnny Depp, watching him like being him, caught in his beauty, sublimity, courage and dedication.
I:448;200;For all that this part must've taken of his physical, emotional, mental even spiritual strength he is unconscious in his delivery of 17th century poetry and dialogue with a flawless accent, winding his way with grace and truth through the layers, struggles, degradation and transformation of such a complex character.
I:448;201;I'm so glad to be out of the mainstream, able to recognize and savor what it will take years for the award and media machines to.
I:448;202;wilmot's qualities, if they can be called qualities, are his numerous vices.
I:448;203;depp (as always) steals every scene in which he appears, yet the surrounding cast is very good.
I:448;204;And Samantha Morton is a most convincing Lizzie Barry, a stage actress who becomes a lust interest for Wilmot.
I:448;205;He was also friends with his employer the King who regularly banished him for his misdeeds (though usually not for long).
I:448;206;Rochester seemed to pride himself on the insatiability of his appetite for both but he was also very interested in writing from a variety of perspectives(sometimes adopting a female persona) and though on the surface his verse seems like just a bunch of bawdy limericks, it actually offers a penetrating glimpse into the workings of a fascinating mind that is complex and conflicted about his own and other's social, sexual and spiritual identities.
I:448;207;He seems to be aroused by the juxtaposition of high society's penchant for glamourous excess/decadence and the equally potent and seductive allure of the lewd and brutal underworld.
I:448;208;Depp, with that eternally boyish glint in his eye, who charms with every grin, seems like someone who probably knows more about the former world, but he is someone that we believe may be sympathetic and therefore receptive (at least imaginatively) to the seductive force of the latter world.
I:448;209;malkovich also offers a convincing portrait of a troubled King who wants to be perceived as a leader but who cannot seem to ween himself from his own appetite for young girls.
I:448;210;It does amuse the visiting French ambassador however!What we get in the film is Rochester's lifestyle most of all.
I:448;211;But what makes the film watchable is that we also get Rochester's humor and feel for common humanity: the scene where Rochester is having his portrait painted (replete with monkey companion) is splendid comedy and his friendship with his servant, Allcock, seems genuine.
I:448;212;There are just enough moments of light humor that we find that we do like him after all and even might feel like we kind of understand him as well.
I:448;213;As Rochester well knew those surrounding the court and occupying high social positions often feign superiority and comfort themselves with decorous public masks while living debauched lives, but, to his credit Rochester is who he is in private and in public.
I:448;214;Perhaps his empathy with women was genuine (even though much of his verse seems to be misogynistic) and he wished to do at least one productive thing in his otherwise destructive life.
I:448;215;Here is a movie that captures the tumultuous and darkened times of England in the 1600's, that is brutally honest from the beginning and challenges the viewer to find even a morsel of beauty within it.
I:448;216;The symbolic importance of this event is still celebrated in Irish Protestant culture as the `Orange.
I:448;217;And so we arrive in a twilight age.
I:448;218;"King Charles was charged with a monumental task
I:448;219;He was standing on the cusp of a scientific age, he understood it and wanted to press forward and bring his country into a brilliant technological era.
I:448;220;If he left any legacy, or a sense of reputation then maybe it was his own inimitable version of honest truth.
I:448;221;played on a stage of his own construction and acted with passion.
I:448;222;and marvel at the depravation of the human soul.
I:448;223;Shows what a great actor johnny depp is!
I:448;224;Sad ending but very well done!
I:448;225;I saw this film 8 times at the Cinema and found it extremely well portrayed especially Lord Rochester played by Johnny Depp.
I:448;226;He is truely one of the best Actors we have of this modern age.
I:448;227;I had the honor in seeing this film by accident when it was first released, not that that's important but this small accident lead me to the libertine and one of Johnny Dep's phenomenal acing parts.
I:448;228;All this must be contained, followed, thus told, and it is by this cast, and with one of the most brilliant performances of his life J. Dep holds this movie and your attention with a script most beautifully written in his words and expressions and delivers what I fell is nothing less, then a masterpiece.
I:448;229;"A kind of revisionist cinema(cf. ""Kinsey"") after an original play."
I:448;230;there are to be sure a few good things about this movie: the acting of Samantha Morton, Richard Coyle and, above all, John Malkovich was very good.
I:448;231;Too bad: great actor at times.
I:448;232;The actor who has real insight into debaucheree .
I:448;233;Rochester, courtier and poet who has become a quintessential example of a Restoration libertine is played magnificently by Johnny Depp.
I:448;234;John Malkovich, as King Charles II, is just as good and the dynamics between the two characters keeps the movie alive.
I:448;235;the movie offers two great performances .
I:448;236;Although this movie is only for adults, it is Johnny Depp's best acting role.
I:448;237;He has absorbed the person of John Wilmot and when the movie is over you feel as if you knew the man.
I:448;238;A great work overlooked for an Oscar and one day will be a must have for all Depp collections and admirers.
I:448;239;Malkovich's affected speech is always a turn.
I:448;240;Let me watch a beautifully executed BBC Masterpiece Theater production any day.
I:448;241;i had a professor when I studied theater, John Newman, who suggested that you know when you are seeing something worthwhile when you forget the discomfort of your seat and everything around you and you are riveted by what you are seeing and experiencing.
I:448;242;"What I have written is my seat of the pants review of ""The Libertine."""
I:448;243;"After seeing him in the movie ""Before Night Falls"" and long before Johnny Depp became that cuddly pirate, Jack Sparrow that is rightfully loved by millions (including me), I believed Johnny to be a very brilliant actor."
I:448;244;True enough, after viewing Johnny Depp give a very brilliant, Academy Award worthy performance as Wilmot, one really indeed finds him hard to like.
I:448;245;Depp's performance in this film is astounding.
I:448;246;i enjoyed this film mainly because of Depp's acting skills plus all of the acting in the film is wonderful.
I:448;247;Johnny Depp's finest role to date.
I:448;248;He enjoyed all of life's pleasures and perversity.
I:448;249;Through her, he vicariously wielded his freedom to feel and live as he truly wanted.
I:448;250;THE LIBERTINE is one of the most atmospherically captured stories/biographies/tales on film.
I:448;251;Laurence Dunmore directs with a pace that is rapid and sure and a feeling for the story that is uncannily real.
I:448;252;The film may bit a bit heavy for some viewers, but for those who cherish the English language written and spoken like Shakespearean poetry this film is a brilliant work.
I:448;253;From the open monologue about why he does not want to be liked to the closing recapitulation, Depp is immersed in this character, delivering a bravura performance bathed in Depp's gift to say as much with his eyes and his body language as with his delivery of lines.
I:448;254;or was it really the theater he loved, the venue where he could allow his true motivations to be experienced instead of being trapped in the body ruled by libido in which he lived, eventually dying of the Great Pox (syphilis) in a wretchedly distorted body yet able in his last days to support the monarchy in an unexpected, highly dramatic appearance before Parliament.
I:448;255;The costumes and scenery, lighting and camera work are some of the finest we've seen in period pieces.
I:448;256;Seeing this kind of banter form a group committed to making a fine independent film only serves to whet the appetite to immediately watch this excellent movie again.
I:448;257;The rest of the cast did a superior job acting, as well.
I:448;258;The movie is, primarily, character driven.
I:448;259;I liked the way it was shot.
I:448;260;The special features are great and only added to this great production.
I:448;261;Johnny Depp proved he is really a great actor and not just a pretty face (even though he is a pretty face).
I:448;262;And you'd better love 17th.
I:448;263;it's a lot more fun.
I:448;264;Although Johnny Depp with a silver nose IS interesting.
I:448;265;Depp is a fine actor at almost anything, but so are many of the others in this film, e. g. the great John Malkovich.
I:448;266;Depp is developing of range that exceeds even his early promise.
I:448;267;Wilmot/Rochester WAS a real libertine, a nihilist who had difficulty understanding what anything meant and understanding it all too well.
I:448;268;And the period is a rich area to mine.
I:448;269;His life makes all the more remarkable and appealing, for a moment, his courageous speaking for his friend and king.
I:448;270;was it wise in the end?
I:448;271;But it was wise for Wilmot himself.
I:448;272;But, upon seeing this on cable more than once, Johnny Depp gives an absolutely mermerizing performance that has to be seen to be believed.
I:448;273;Great writing for Depp and he delivers.
I:448;274;This film is a true chronicle to sly debauchery and you won't find a better messenger than Johnny Depp in this role.
I:448;275;One of those rare movies with a great beginning, middle and ending.
I:448;276;The worst you will see is a performance worthy of an Oscar.
I:448;277;and what I also believe to be a good representation of a historic moral reality.
I:448;278;with such a vast contrast in the reviews there is only two sides, those who didnt understand the plot, the times or the character and thus hated the movie and the other is those whose minds allowed them to go beyond the graffic immorality into a quite profound view of life, politics, pleasure, and religion.
I:448;279;The character development was flawless on Depp's part.
I:448;280;Even the look of the movie was perfect.
I:448;281;this was Johnny Depp's most complex role and he executed with a unique flare and a soulful brilliance.
I:448;282;The writing, character development and directing were outstanding.
I:448;283;"Where ""Quills"" detailed the life and soul of a madman, ""The Libertine"" gives us a glimpse into the life of a true iconoclast."
I:448;284;If you go wondering how Johnny Depp will recreate himself this time, you will love it.
I:448;285;Jameson Thottam was captured by the opening prologue, found his portrayal of a hedonist amazing,and was in tears by the end of the movie.
I:448;286;"I believe those that understand the times and the lifestyle lived will come away from this movie touched
I:448;287;Go to see it prepared to think.
I:448;288;This is Depp's best work Jameson Thottam.
I:448;289;"It is very easy to become immersed in the exquisite performance turned in by Johnny Depp as John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester in ""The Libertine""."
I:448;290;It is, in this writer's opinion the best of Depp's career.
I:448;291;What we feel for the Earl is very complex.
I:448;292;But something mercurial that exists in between the two.
I:448;293;however, The Libertine is so much more than just a vehicle for the tremendous acting mastery that Depp possesses.
I:448;294;It is in fact, endowed with several unique and compelling character studies.
I:448;295;There is the besmurched yet sentimental and tolerant King Charles II of England played by John Malkovich who, despite repeated insults and disappointments at the hands of his Earl, continues to give John Wilmot reprieves in the hopes that the Earl might finally produce some endearing body of literary work that would favor the King's administration.
I:448;296;While Livvie is very far from the most sultry of vixens in which the Earl has indulged, he finds himself infatuated with her intelligence, her overwhelmingly defiant personality and the singular purpose with which the actress comports herself in achieving her one desire.
I:448;297;That is to be the most adored actress in England.
I:448;298;She is intelligent, strong and to the Earl's pleasant surprise, not simply another shallow conquest of the flesh.
I:448;299;Livvie Berry is perhaps the most intriquing character in the entire film.
I:448;300;Her's is one that indeed warrants a film all her own.
I:448;301;the Libertine is a film that will go largely unappreciated by the mainstream viewing public because of it's period setting and graphic subject matter.
I:448;302;Combined with the fact that it is also blessed with complex and uncommon characters who are portrayed exquisitely by an exceedingly talented cast, the film will 10 years from now still be viewed as a relevant commentary on several fronts whether sexual, moral, political or romantic.
I:448;303;missile type of mainstream comercial films a lot of which vary little in their mold and presentation, The Libertine stands out as a true brilliant work of filmmaking.
I:448;304;great musical score by Mr. Nyman.
I:448;305;The Restoration was one of the most exciting and decadent periods in English history, marked by great debauchery, great artistic achievement, and great fun.
I:448;306;THE LIBERTINE is one of the most insistent films on this moralistic equation, focusing as it does on the last years of the Earl of Rochester, one of the greatest Restoration poets and wits who died at age 33 of alcoholism and syphilis.
I:448;307;(The best of these jokes, by the way, involves Rochester's servant and a pineapple.)
I:448;308;The film has a very distinctive look to it: partly to emphasize the aura of menace and decay, but also as a cost.
I:448;309;Johnny Depp does terrific things as Rochester, although the screenplay requires him to be constantly foul.
I:448;310;"Samantha Morton acts superbly as Rochester's actress proteg Elizabeth Barry, but unfortunately is not very charismatic
I:448;311;The film is intelligently directed, but the screenplay just doesn't hang together.
I:448;312;For a hardcore Depp fan The Libertine is a great movie that has Depp playing a seductive, arrogant, and dark figure who seduces his audience and leaves them wanting more.
I:448;313;Loved this story and continue to love Johnny Depp!
I:448;314;He never ceases to amaze at the depth of character he is able to reach in each movie he agrees to be a part of.
I:448;315;The Libertine is pure genius.
I:448;316;The acting alone was marvelous.
I:448;317;I open them again to see the words floating out of a lavish Johnny Depp's mouth.
I:448;318;Johnny Depp is a fantastic actor.
I:448;319;God, the storyline was awesome and Johnny Depp surprised me with his superb depiction of John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester during the reign of King Charles II, and the movie itself brought me back in time to a not so pretty world.
I:448;320;The moral of the story for me is that history definitely does repeat in some form or other.
I:448;321;what I love about this movie is that the characters are very well defined, and I have watched it several times.
I:448;322;It is one of my all time personal favorites.
I:448;323;There is a delicate balance when a genius dares to break ranks and risk everything.
I:448;324;His grace glows inspite of the agony that would drive lesser men to self.
I:448;325;The strength of the character is astounding, astonishing.
I:448;326;He is a man at war with himself and win or lose, he remains charming, witty and beautiful to behold.
I:448;327;Johnny Depp gave a performance worthy of Oscar in this film.
I:448;328;He went from absolutely gorgeous to the complete opposite and played each scene with extreme intensity.
I:448;329;I know he's a great actor but oh my!
I:448;330;Very fine film and excellent acting on the part of Johnny Depp.
I:448;331;I do hope he will delight us with more films of this caliber.
I:448;332;Because I love Johnny so much I'm going to forgive him for this one.
I:448;333;Both are fantastic actors and I think they did the best they could with this.
I:448;334;Great actors and a fascinating subject matter.
I:448;335;About as interesting as listening to Uncle Ed relive tales of his wild college days.
I:448;336;I like watching movies with Johnny Depp simply because he's so fascinating to watch.
I:448;337;Plus, he's one of those actors who can inhabit a character and make that character very real for the audience.
I:448;338;there are lots of things to enjoy about this film.
I:448;339;The casting of Johnny Depp as the brilliant and handsome John Wilmot, second Lord of Rochester.
I:448;340;Plus the sets and costumes are as rich and sumptuous as you could wish for a drama taking place in 1670's England.
I:448;341;I usually consider myself a fairly intelligent, well.
I:448;342;The main plot points are easy to understand: John Wilmot is a popular, wealthy wit in London's social and cultural scene during a period with more than its share of literary wits and satirists.
I:448;343;Charles II brings Wilmot back to London because he's hoping someone of Wilmot's literary genious can create a play that will elevate Charles' monarchy in the eyes of Europe and legitimize his claim to the throne.
I:448;344;On the other hand he is filled with loathing for himself, his friends, and the society in which he fits so well.
I:448;345;there is one final, wonderful scene when Wilmot redeems himself to the King and perhaps to himself.
I:448;346;He finally takes action for something he believes in.
I:448;347;a gorgeous film about a fascinating character well.
I:448;348;Great Depp performance that deserves blu.
I:448;349;tHE LIBERTINE is a dark film that the studio wisely decided to release only after the Christmas holiday season.
I:448;350;The gloom is enhanced by a cinematography accomplished in somber, washed.
I:448;351;now having said why THE LIBERTINE isn't light and airy, I have to also say that it's a powerful display of Depp's superlative talent.
I:448;352;Depp is triumphantly weird and wonderful as John Wilmot in Laurence Dunmore's 2004/5 film adaptation of Stephen Jefferys' 1994 play.
I:448;353;"Just as a visual period piece, Dunmore's ""Libertine"" succeeds brilliantly."
I:448;354;The period costume and scenery is stunning and each scene is composed like an old master's painting.
I:448;355;His love of the theater is deep and profound .
I:448;356;A huge middle finger raised to the King and to the audience and to his cast .
I:448;357;All in all, this is an enraging, offensive, and hauntingly beautiful film.
I:448;358;In this movie, dare I say it, Depp gives one of his finest performances.
I:448;359;"The movie opens with Depp talking directly to the camera
I:448;360;Turns out he's a very sympathetic character actually.
I:448;361;Johnny (this is the character's name for the record) has been banished from London for a year because he said the word 'c**t' in front of King Charles II (John Malkovich, who's amazing as always and is also the producer).
I:448;362;time Oscar nominee Samantha Morton, Best Actress 'Sweet and Lowdown' and 'In America').
I:448;363;Depp's transformation from the beginning of the movie to the end is incredible.
I:448;364;The makeup here is Oscar worthy.
I:448;365;The performances by the lead actors Depp, Morton, and Malkovich are all incredible as well.
I:448;366;But the movie is pretty damned original and it had my eyes glued to the screen throughout.
I:448;367;This is also one of the best movies I've seen in a while, set in this era.
I:448;368;One of the WORST movies I have ever seen!!
I:448;369;In my opinion, this film is his greatest performance ever.
I:448;370;He has to run the gamut of emotion and play a smart, complex, eccentric, difficult, somewhat crazed and brilliant man and artist.
I:448;371;Depp drives the film along with a great supporting cast.
I:448;372;If you are a Johnny Depp fan, this work of art is by far at the top of the list.
I:448;373;It is thrilling to see an actor so very talented and it is my opinion that there is no one in the field today that could have pulled this role off.
I:448;374;True to life in costumes, scenery, props, conditions of the time and even down to the lighting.
I:448;375;Yeah, he's got my vote.
I:448;376;This film is raw, brass, dark, and extremely well done.
I:448;377;In my opinion it is Johnny Depp's best acting performance.
I:448;378;During the special features one of the writers commented that in most historical dramas writers have to add something to hollywoodize it and make it more exciting, in Rochester's case things needed to be cut.
I:448;379;but it is an amazing and unique film addressing issues not often attempted in film.
I:448;380;The opening and closing monologues done by Johnny Depp alone are worth seeing the film, they are phenomenal.
I:448;381;Johnny Depp's range as an actor is greatly tested, and he once again stretches and tests his limits as an artist.
I:448;382;All of the supporting characters are very well chosen and perform beautifully.
I:448;383;This is a very honest piece.
I:448;384;Suble, complex and nuanced in script, direction and performance.
I:448;385;for a life imperfectly led in the extreme yet still punctuated throughout with more than a few flashes of brilliance, for the struggle to live with integrity and authenticity as the real impulse behind so much of the debauch, and for the self.
I:448;386;the film left me deeply, deeply moved, and I highly recommend it.
I:448;387;This is just about the best supporting cast I've ever seen.
I:448;388;I already loved Rosamund Pike and Tom Hollander and knew they were both capable of excellent work and they absolutely live up to their talents.
I:448;389;"This is the only thing I've ever seen Samantha Morton do (except for watching ""Max and Ruby"" with my preschoolers
I:448;390;"He was fantastic as Charles Sackville and I will forever wonder what ""the full wibbly."
I:448;391;And, of course, John Malkovich, like Pike and Hollander, is ALWAYS good and he is here SO good yet again.
I:448;392;He's got some amazing cheekbones, and he DID do an EXCELLENT dying scene.
I:448;393;Because I never heard of it until just a couple of years ago.
I:448;394;"this is ""R"" for a very good reason."
I:448;395;I was so moved by Johnny Depp's performance that I watched this movie several times.
I:448;396;This movie definitely displays that The Earl of Rochester did exactly that.
I:448;397;This man had an interesting journey .
I:448;398;Most actors could not take a role like this, a history lesson, and make it something actually enthralling to watch.
I:448;399;I was impressed from the commencement where he states that we would not like him, to the end when he emotes to the theater actors.
I:448;400;It was interesting to see the character reach some sort of emotional crescendo as he works his way to ultimate self destruction.
I:448;401;"The murky/muted cinematography giving a true to period ""tone"" to it and finishes the feel of the film itself."
I:448;402;Samantha Morton was fabulous as Lizzy Barry, giving a nice contrast to his actual wife.
I:448;403;Her first performance of Hamlet's Ophelia after working with Wilmot was powerful enough for me to want to see her actually do the whole play in real life.
I:448;404;Johnny Depp is an amazing actor.
I:448;405;This is a very WEIRD movie but I liked it.
I:448;406;I have yet to see this movie.
I:448;407;He is such an awesome actor!
I:448;408;This is a beautifully shot period piece chronicling the brief, decadent life of poet/lover/drunk John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester.
I:448;409;Johnny Depp is brilliant and plays very well off the other actors cast here.
I:448;410;As a history student, I found the film especially enjoyable.
I:448;411;Over time, I have come to believe that he is quite possibly the finest American actor working today.
I:448;412;He has taken quirky roles in offbeat films and made each one a signature piece of work.
I:448;413;depp brings Wilmot back to life with a deft hand.
I:448;414;dimensional barfly and sexual epicurean in noble finery.
I:448;415;Depp is able to project Wilmot's inner essences, and we come away with a view of a man who lived life on the edge even as he observed it with a jaundiced eye and treated all those around him to a constant shower of vitriol, knowing that most of them deserved no more.
I:448;416;a 21st century man in the 17th, Wilmot is a strangely familiar person, the type of instant celebrity that Hollywood revels in today.
I:448;417;Live fast, die young, and leave a good.
I:448;418;Mud is everywhere present, almost as if you couldn't escape it.
I:448;419;The opening and closing speaches by Depp are sheer genius and Stephen Jeffereys who wrote both the play and the screenplay stick close to the style of speach of the period.
I:448;420;It is both stagy and gritty in realism.
I:448;421;It was technically considered for the Oscars we just saw on Sunday .
I:448;422;"When I expressed a strong sense of identification with the title character of ""The Libertine,"" my wife immediately took issue."
I:448;423;There is little doubt that John Wilmot is such a creature, but unlike the rest of his crowd he clearly takes no pleasure in taking such pleasures.
I:448;424;rochester's curse is that he is brilliant and that while his fellow libertines are happy to enjoy his pornographic verse, King Charles II (John Malkovich) expects more.
I:448;425;the performance by Depp is the centerpiece of the film and one of his best.
I:448;426;We may not like his character, but we sure are going to watch absolutely everything he does from start to finish.
I:448;427;Malkovich played the role of Rochester in the Steppenwolf Theater production of Stephen Jeffreys' play over a decade ago and first came up with the idea of having Depp do the movie role.
I:448;428;He is also one of the producers of the film, so he gets a large share of credit for seeing the production through.
I:448;429;You can also spot Freddy Jones as Betterton and Stanley Townsend as Keown, also fleshing out the solid supporting cast.
I:448;430;Laurence Dunmore's first film as director is an interesting period piece.
I:448;431;Johnny Depp does a seductive job as the Second Earl of Rochester, John Wilmot.
I:448;432;He's able to make us not like him while wanting to watch him.
I:448;433;"John Malkovich's Charles II likewise did not add to his Oscar nominations (""Places in the Heart"" [84] and ""In the Line of Fire"" [93]), but he does an admirable job of playing hedonist and politician."
I:448;434;Samantha Morton as the actress Elizabeth Barry shows great character growth from waif to star of stage.
I:448;435;"While this film also did not add to her Oscar nominations (Supporting actress ""Sweet and Lowdown"" [99] and Best Actress ""In America"" [03]), Samantha Morton does an excellent job of showing the status of women on the stage during the period."
I:448;436;"Several of the actors like Jack Davenport and Tom Hollander have also appeared with Depp in the ""Pirates"" series."
I:448;437;While the film is certainly not always pleasant, it was an interesting portrait of a life out of balance.
I:448;438;But this is by far Johnny Depp's best work.
I:448;439;If you are a fan of his this is a MUST see.
I:448;440;Samantha Morton is Depp's love interest, a young actress who should have known better.
I:448;441;And yes, he also does have a wife who makes a brief appearance.
I:448;442;The king is amused when the rouewrites obscene poetry and flaunts all convention.
I:448;443;These are two good actors and they play their roles well.
I:448;444;It is a tour de force if a flawed one but the flaws are unimportant.
I:448;445;It's a brave film about a remarkable man whose self.
I:448;446;There were moments of sheer acting brilliance on his part.
I:448;447;There were also moments of over.
I:448;448;It was a very moving film and one I was glad to have caught by sheer accident.
I:448;449;Only in the theater does his blood stir, the magic combination of creativity and talent that offers moments of ecstasy.
I:448;450;, until the end of the film, Wilmot's beauty destroyed by disease, his spirit shines just as intensely and provocatively, unrepentant.
I:448;451;The grainy film and smoky scenes, mud.
I:448;452;"This creative endeavor is not only a descent into Hell
I:448;453;It is one of those wonderful period piece movies.
I:448;454;Johnny Depp and John Malkovich are outstanding actors.
I:448;455;watching 5 years after the movie premiered and I love it.
I:448;456;It depicts John Wilmont in relation to his poems very well, it's a shocking, very well done movie as well as a great teaching tool.
I:448;457;Johnny Depp's performance in this stunning film is beyond anything he has done before.
I:448;458;You will see dimensions of his talent that will only become deeper and richer with time.
I:448;459;See it for yourself and decide.
I:448;460;To really be honest here, he actually liked himself the least of anyone.
I:448;461;Depp in a fantastic role and loved the look of long haired men.
I:448;462;as a former actor, I regularly am drawn toward movies whose actors have powerful performances.
I:448;463;what is so astonishing is that Johnny incorporates these qualities, and there are many, so flawlessly, there are many moments you forget it is Johnny Depp but some unnamed talented british actor.
I:448;464;(The accent by the way is nearly flawless as well.)
I:448;465;These are the performances that are great, you are so drawn in by the character you forget who is playing.
I:448;466;the movie opens with Depp giving this brilliant monologue that has the feel of an Iago (villain in Shakespeare's Othello) type of character.
I:448;467;You feel he is egotistical, intelligent, and up to no good, yet still charismatic.
I:448;468;He is a lavish womanizer, popular statesman, and both loved and hated by his peers.
I:448;469;Depp really brings out his own awareness of his situation and plays all the right notes, perfectly hitting the difficult British wit that so many times is above an American actor's head.
I:448;470;then as we see his last attempt to do good, which works out well in his favor, he is able to die.
I:448;471;the closing monologue, as powerful as the opening one, returns to him commenting on his own life, trying to retain his facade of disinterest, but this time we see a crack of humanity as he repeats the last line of the movie over and over in a quite desperation.
I:448;472;This is acting at its finest.
I:448;473;I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp and have been for years.
I:448;474;This was a good movie but I wouldnt watch with the children it is extremely racie and has alot of sex involved.
I:448;475;this movie will grab you,pull you in.
I:448;476;all that's needed is an open mind.
I:448;477;A superb Johnny Depp (Ed Wood, Once Upon a Time In Mexico) stars as John Wilmot the Earl of Rochestor.
I:448;478;He wants her to be the best actress and so she gives in and he teaches her the ways.
I:448;479;King Charles wants John to make the best play.
I:448;480;I found the poetry rather interesting and coming from Depp they were even better.
I:448;481;Depp gives a outstanding performance.
I:448;482;He was a one time hero of the British Navy, and an amusement of King Charles II (Malkovich).
I:448;483;His wife Elizabeth Malet (Pike) puts up with it, but is clearly not happy.
I:448;484;This infatuation leads to love, at least on his part.
I:448;485;Throughout the movie, Johnny Depp is sexy and sinister at the same time.
I:448;486;He proves that the smallest touch or gesture can be unbelievably erotic.
I:448;487;Depp commands every scene he is in, even if he's in the corner.
I:448;488;His physical presence is much more palpable than in a lot of his movies, where quirkiness defines his characters.
I:448;489;I can only hope he will continue to take on roles of this depth.
I:448;490;Malkovich and other supporting cast were perfect, cinematography and script were brilliant.
I:448;491;I also really liked the music.
I:448;492;I did not like you at all during this film, and firmly believe that the way you lived your life and the things that you did to other people, the games that were played with others emotions, and your handling of your personal affairs, all of this lead directly to your personal downfall.
I:448;493;Your wife loved you unconditionally during all the good and bad times that you put her through.
I:448;494;And throughout your life you had many mistresses, which she knew about, but she stayed true to her love and your love and tried to make herself better and work on things between the two of you so that her life would be better.
I:448;495;And your mistress, Lord Rochester, gave you what you deserved.
I:448;496;This is an amazing movie on all levels.
I:448;497;This is a great piece of historical fiction based on an extremely interesting character.
I:448;498;How it makes it's final point is intelligent and heartbreaking.
I:448;499;I did not care for the choice of actress to play Lizzie Barry, but Johnny Depp and John Malkovic were brilliant.
I:448;500;Fans of both will love this film.
I:448;501;Very dark and seductive film.
I:448;502;And it's a great movie.
I:448;503;He's great in this movie, so check it out!Movie was in perfectly new condition.
I:448;504;Great price for a great piece of work.
I:448;505;Johnny Depp's shining moment was the closing monologue, well after Wilmot was ravaged with syphills and laboring for breath.
I:448;506;very Good performances by all the cast and crew, well worth the time to view.
I:448;507;for those who haven't seen it is one of Depp's finest character performances and there is much more depth and range to both his and John Malkovich's role (King Charles II) than most would expect from a 'historical costume drama .
I:448;508;It has Malcovich, need I say more.
I:448;509;long debate about public morals, sex, religion, and plays.
I:448;510;Ostensibly a film about the debauched genius, John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, the film is really a safe.
I:448;511;"But Rochester was also capable of conventional poetry: his best work, ""A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind,"" displays the true level of his genius more than ""Signior Dildo""."
I:448;512;Johnny Depp's Rochester is a man with a hangover.
I:448;513;But his past sins catch up with him: he alienates her, the King (yet again) and his family, and we watch him literally rot away until his death.
I:448;514;There is, therefore, none of the delight in wit and artifice that defined high Restoration culture, nothing of the striking contrast between the beauty of theatre, art, and music and the grubbiness of daily life.
I:448;515;"Truly Excellent script
I:448;516;locations and authenticity (gritty) of the restoration era.
I:448;517;"Especially loved the portrayal of the moral ambiguity or even absence of morality amongst the mingling classes
I:448;518;This man is one of the best actors because he takes risks and believes in what he does.
I:448;519;I was riveted, and couldn't take my eyes off him for a single second, even when it become hard to look.
I:448;520;This movie's cinematography is brilliant.
I:448;521;This movie is a sheer triumph of what superb acting can do to bring compelling historical figures lives to the masses.
I:448;522;An interesting paradox for the period drama fan, is your allegiance to the genre strong enough for the [.]
I:448;523;He sought to be open and honest about who he was and only hurt others when he held them up to the same scrutiny.
I:448;524;This is a beautiful, depressing miasma of a movie, with gorgeous sets and emotionally wrenching performances.
I:448;525;There's something gleeful and wonderful in it under all the decay.
I:448;526;I guess it's a tribute to Depp's talent as an actor that I can watch his work and enjoy it when he plays characters I can only like in spite of themselves.
I:448;527;I got the movie for my wife.
I:448;528;It is one of favorite movies.
I:448;529;It definitely is a must see movie.
I:448;530;It just goes to show you, if you can do anything supremely well, anything at all.
I:448;531;I wouldn't call it high entertainment, but I did find it interesting and watchable because of you know who, the great Depp.
I:448;532;I loved the entire movie.
I:448;533;I think it is one of his best moments on film.
I:448;534;I loved the realism of the set, the filth and beauty of that time.
I:448;535;This is undoubtedly the best work he has ever done.
I:448;536;The story is based upon the life of a John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, intimate of King Charles II.
I:448;537;Just make sure you watch it alone first.
I:448;538;It's the kind of movie that grabs you from the start and carries you, completely interested throughout.
I:448;539;great story line based on fact.
I:448;540;johnny Depp is magnificent as he travels through many years in this movie.
I:448;541;Great at all life stages.
I:448;542;Additional casting does the flick justice also.
I:448;543;highly recommend to those not easily offended.
I:448;544;ball movies and I enjoyed this one very much.
I:448;545;He is so beautiful, charming and charismatic, that he could make even this dismal tale almost entertaining.
I:448;546;At one point it seems that he finds something real to care about besides self.
I:448;547;I agree with others that it was Oscar worthy.
I:448;548;I look forward to the rest of his career.
I:448;549;I found it hard to believe that such a remarkable man as the Earl of Rochester was supposed to be would fall in love with her.
I:448;550;the film was stylish and well made.
I:448;551;The life of John Wilmot, the 2nd Earl of Rochester, is a fascinating subject for a film.
I:448;552;incidentally far and away the best scene in the film .
I:448;553;Rochester, a brilliant poet and playwright, could have been a great ornament to Charles II's court had he not chosen to alternate between defying the megalomaniacal king and vilifying him.
I:448;554;In disgrace, Rochester disappears for a time, taking Miss Berry with him.
I:448;555;He plays the part with enormous verve and sincerity, as he always does.
I:448;556;john Malkovich, whose understated sophistication doesn't always endear him to viewers, is the perfect foil for Depp as Charles II.
I:448;557;His performance is absolutely spot.
I:448;558;Notwithstanding, these valiant efforts are swallowed up in this great sprawling confusion of a film.
I:448;559;if you want to experience a well.
I:448;560;"made film set in this same period, one that develops its themes with great force and clarity, watch ""Restoration""."
I:448;561;Period films often benefit greatly from scores featuring music of the same period.
I:448;562;"Unlike ""Restoration"", which gives us an auditory feast of Purcell and other musicians of the era, ""Libertine"" gives us hardly anything ."
I:448;563;These actors exhude style, beauty and charisma.
I:448;564;This is a piece of beautifully crafted dialogue .
I:448;565;It mixes wit, philosophy and charm all at once.
I:448;566;One of those characters that one loves to hate.
I:448;567;Depp's physical transformation is fantastic too.
I:448;568;if you like smart movies .
I:448;569;but I have a feeling like a lot of teenage boys did.
I:448;570;The subject matter may be a little strong for the average person, but a must see.
I:448;571;his range in this film is extrordinary.
I:448;572;It's bawdy poetry at it's best!
I:448;573;Seriously though, what an amazing performance by one of the most talented actors in our time.
I:448;574;All of the supporting roles were equally as impressive.
I:448;575;That's all I knew about it going in because that was all the critics would say about it.
I:448;576;But it's so much more than that.
I:448;577;Wilmot was a great writer who couldn't be bowdlerized and often upset his patron Charles II.
I:448;578;as the protagonist, Johnny Depp is mesmerizing.
I:448;579;Granted, the man loves playing writers (and yet is one of the few actors who hasn't actually tried to be a writer) but this is an especially mesmerizing writer who knew that he could get away with everything and pushed the limits to the point where he couldn't get away with it.
I:448;580;this is a movie that is both beautiful and horrifying in equal measures.
I:448;581;I have watched it dozens of times and still love it.
I:448;582;While it might not be for everyone (it was pretty widely panned by critics) if you're predisposed to love strange movies about writers who push the boundaries, you will love this movie.
I:448;583;this is a supremely intelligent movie for very smart people that appreciate nuances.
I:448;584;A few (very few) exposed breasts, but some of the human choreography is reminiscent of Leonardi da Vinci, extremely tasteful and NOT pornography in any way.
I:448;585;this movie held my attention.
I:448;586;It aroused a passionate empathetic appreciation of loyalty to life, liberty, wife, love, king, and country.
I:448;587;Johnny Depp plays a very complex man, and the nuances of this movie have to be seen to be appreciated.
I:448;588;This was a role made for Depp: an eccentric and complicated character, who boldly goes essentially nowhere with great style, evolving the whole way and full of surprises right up to the end.
I:448;589;the plot, as based on a true character, is pretty basic.
I:448;590;This is very fun, sumptuously produced, and the characters .
I:448;591;are endlessly interesting and finely acted.
I:448;592;Johnny Depp delivers a mesmerizing performance as the debauched John Wilmot, the Second Earl of Rochester in 17th.
I:448;593;easily the best thing about this unfortunate, unpleasant adaptation of Stephen Jeffrey's play.
I:448;594;Standout portrayals by Samantha Morton and John Malkovich prove the ideal match for Depp's inventiveness during this two.
I:448;595;not only is he beautiful as ever to look at .
I:448;596;but his accent was perfect and his mannerisms flawless.
I:448;597;you will be watching and Oscar.
I:448;598;worthy performance from one of the most under.
I:448;599;rated actors of our time.
I:448;600;It is Johnny in all his glory and splendor .
I:448;601;Johnny Depp delivers a very moving performance playing John Wilmot, who is a 17th century royal heir, second Earl of rochester, related to King Charles II (played brilliantly by John Malkovich).
I:448;602;"Depp himself begins the movie with a very personal monologue in which he tells the viewing audience ""I don't want you to like me""."
I:448;603;johnny Depp's beautifully sculpted face fits right in with this masterpiece of threatrical design.
I:448;604;He portrays the relentlessly self.
I:448;605;the most important criteria for my rating this movie with five stars was the length of the uninterrupted scenes of superb theatrical stage performances by Depp and the entire cast.
I:448;606;We looked up some of the poetry of Rochester on the internet and found it to be sensitive and quite moving .
I:448;607;A useful discussion indeed, one engendered by viewing this film.
I:448;608;i think it to be one of the best films I've ever seen.
I:448;609;The cast is magnificent, especially Johnny Depp and John Malkovich.
I:448;610;a brilliant man who died early, never reached his full potential and brought about his own destruction, a wit, a prankster, a lover whose greatest love was his only briefly.
I:448;611;I have to say that I rather enjoyed this movie, eventhough it took a while for it to come to my area.
I:448;612;Depp protrays another brilliant character once more with his wonderful acting abilities.
I:448;613;As John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, you are not to like his character and it is stated in the very first scene of the movie so therefore, you know the Earl is more than just a regular person, he is a master of sexuality.
I:448;614;If you enjoy Depp in his usual unusual characters, then you will love this movie for he is, as always, wonderful and sexy in the beginning and vibrantly brilliant at the end.
I:448;615;If you let yourself become involved with the characters you will have your heart broken.
I:448;616;John Malkovich is absolutly terrific as the king who keeps trying to have faith in his protege.
I:448;617;I bought this because #1 its a Johnny Depp film.
I:448;618;Grand Piece of Debached England when everything was wicked and everyone loved it.
I:448;619;Although this movie did not get very good reviews when it was released in theatres, I happen to think it's one of Depp's best.
I:448;620;He's right in character, as usual.
I:448;621;if you give it more than one look.
I:448;622;The sets and costuming are wonderfully done.
I:448;623;There is a grittiness that is necessary.
I:448;624;There was nothing beautiful or light or pretty about the life this film displayed.
I:448;625;john Depp of course is probably the best actor around these days and he did a great job acting in this movie.
I:448;626;They aren't happy and this is testing Charles' reign.
I:448;627;The Libertine, directed by Laurence Dunmore and written by Stephen Jeffreys, based on his own play, is a very good film, for the most part.
I:448;628;This scene is already one of the most memorable in recent film.
I:448;629;His frank and open manner is very memorable.
I:448;630;It is a testament to Depp's skill as an actor that we don't really care.
I:448;631;Depp's portrayal is interesting and challenging, both of which more than make up for the lack of a likable hero in the story.
I:448;632;Wilmot enjoys all of the pleasures of living in society and enjoys them well.
I:448;633;A good example of his uninhibited nature is displayed when Wilmot meets the man who will eventually become his new valet.
I:448;634;Very fitting for the playwright.
I:448;635;Depp manages to make all of this carousing and carrying on seem entirely natural.
I:448;636;But that is best left to your discovery.
I:448;637;what I didn't get from the film, or Depp's performance, was evidence of why Wilmot is remembered today as a good writer.
I:448;638;The Libertine is strangely beautiful to watch.
I:448;639;The look of the film is entirely successful, capturing details of London during the Seventeenth Century.
I:448;640;samantha Morton and John Malkovich are both good, restrained and believable, providing a nice counterpoint to Depp's more theatrical performance.
I:448;641;Charles II was vulnerable during this period, so it works.
I:448;642;Morton brings a quiet power to her performance.
I:448;643;But as we watch her performance, we begin to question that, and realize perhaps she is stronger than we initially thought.
I:448;644;The Libertine is a very good film, featuring a memorable, uninhibited performance by Depp.
I:448;645;A late scene in the film shows a number of his writings and drawings being destroyed by a family member.
I:448;646;So it's the Johnny Depp with Syphilis movie.
I:448;647;depp's Lord Rochester is a talented poet with a bigger talent for sex and shenanigans.
I:448;648;His life is a party and he's enjoying it to the fullest.
I:448;649;He gets involved with Samantha Morton's actress and trains her how to act while falling in love with her.
I:448;650;the best part of the movie is the set .
I:448;651;"Anyone who wishes to watch an actor at the top of his form should see ""The Libertine,"" with the great Johnny Depp."
I:448;652;"As I have written before, ""Depp is probably the most talented and versatile actor in the world today,"" and his performance in this movie leaves no doubt about that."
I:448;653;He is truly in a class by himself.
I:448;654;while he is fully capable of making mega.
I:448;655;"hits like the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series, it is a movie like this where the audience sees the full range of his magnificent talents."
I:448;656;He played opposite the fine American actor, John Malkovich, with a wonderful performance by Samantha Morton, but it is Depp who steals the show and surpasses all.
I:448;657;Nonetheless, over time, it may develop into a cult film, because of Depp's brilliant acting.
I:448;658;is enormously talented, and hopefully we will see many more of his films.
I:448;659;So, I got this one used, but I swear it was brand new, did'nt even look like anyone had watched the disk, also this is a great movie.
I:448;660;Now, in `Libertine' Depp shows another example of his unique gift as an actor who manages to make us like one of the most debauched characters in real life, one John Wilmot or Earl of Rochester.
I:448;661;despite the dedicated and electrifying acting from Depp, the very raw and emotionally.
I:448;662;It's just another classic Johnny Depp movie.
I:448;663;It's a great edition to anyone's collection if they love Johnny Depp movies.
I:448;664;I want to say that the Earl of Rochester (Depp) got what he deserved, but I couldn't even care enough to feel anything, which is a rarity for me.
I:448;665;This is a very adult film, complete with perversion and nudity and graphic language but it all felt out of place.
I:448;666;That said, most people would probably enjoy this movie more if it were fictionalized.
I:448;667;Recall that in Shakespeare's day, only men acted, with boys taking the women's parts.
I:448;668;So the movie is of great interest as a historical piece.
I:448;669;Watch it to be transported to another time by the inimitable Johnny Depp and superlative John Malkovich .
I:448;670;Watch it when you have the patience and energy to follow the ornate language and appreciate the scenery and costumes.
I:448;671;He loved her and she respected him.
I:448;672;This film is an awesome display of Jonny Depp's talent.
I:448;673;His final speech to save the King in the House of Lords is worthy of critical aclaim.
I:448;674;I hope he is given another role which gives him the chance to exercise his considerable talent.
I:448;675;This is an extremely good movie with a great dialogue, music, filming and acting.
I:448;676;you will enjoy as much
I:448;677;Very good roles John and Elizabeth, Johnny Depp is impressive as always, i loved the photography, more or less the story
I:448;678;This is an actor with astounding range and creativity.
I:448;679;His willingness to take on the most challenging (if not, one might think, by Hollywood standards, downright undesirable parts, then making them so) roles, making each one uniquely his own, has earned my respect.
I:448;680;the movie, directed by Laurence Dunmore, opens on a dark screen, with Depp .
I:448;681;"emerging momentarily from the shadows to announce to his viewers in a kind of stunning intimacy: ""You will not like me."
I:448;682;At least in speaking for the ladies, if I may, he's right.
I:448;683;artist, the ladies' man who breaks hearts, uses women for his pleasure, then leaves them behind once he has gotten his.
I:448;684;to live such a life, however, in whatever century, and despite a man's every effort to deny to himself his own greater humanity, leads to depression, and Wilmot is no exception.
I:448;685;For this, he is hired by King Charles II, played by John Malkovich, to produce theatre to gain popularity for the King.
I:448;686;even a libertine such as Wilmot, however, has a heart buried in there somewhere, and his is brought to surface by an actress named Lizzy Barry.
I:448;687;"She is far from a beauty, but, ironically, in this woman it is not her physical attractiveness that wins Wilmot's heart
I:448;688;a stunning, if at times deeply disturbing, movie.
I:448;689;It is worthwhile if only to witness one of Depp's most remarkable performances to date.
I:448;690;For a movie to do that it is well delivered.
I:448;691;But will take the story as delivered.
I:448;692;He delivered in my opinion the best of his career to date.
