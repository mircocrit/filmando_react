I:18062;2;They found it very good and was very happy with it.
I:18062;3;And I do have a good and not cheap Blu Ray player.
I:18062;4;"com"" a very reliable source that also mentions if a Blu Ray is Regionfree."
I:18062;5;"I also just bought the Blu Ray of ""Buck Privates"" from Universal and that image was very good, even better than I had expected for a movie from 1941."
I:18062;6;The Grapes of Wrath is a great movie, perhaps one of the best I have ever seen.
I:18062;7;This shows the great sacrifice that the Joads must make in order to survive.
I:18062;8;This is important because in the book it symbolizes the way people have to help one another in times of need.
I:18062;9;I really loved these scenes, because unlike most of the movie, these scenes do remain true to the book, and because of that, they are full of detail, and you can see the hand of Steinbeck at work.
I:18062;10;despite all of these forgotten scenes, the Grapes of Wrath is one of the best movies of all time.
I:18062;11;I loved the product very much, it's a great movie and i feel like it should be seen more by people
I:18062;12;The main points here also apply to the movie.
I:18062;13;Take advantage of both media to get a real feel for this classic of the 1930's.
I:18062;14;stricken Oklahoma and headed for the land of milk and honey in California.
I:18062;15;the story line is actually very simple.
I:18062;16;In classic American tradition they pulled up stakes and headed west to get a new start.
I:18062;17;With great hopes and no few illusions they set out as a family for the sunny and plentiful California of their dreams.
I:18062;18;Day labor, work camps, strike action, murder, and mayhem.you know, California, the real California of the day.
I:18062;19;grapes of Wrath was made into a starkly beautiful film starring a young Henry Fonda as Tom Joad.
I:18062;20;On a day when you are not depressed it is a film you want to see, if only for the photography.
I:18062;21;He had an ear for the 1930's struggle of the Okies and their ilk as they hit California.
I:18062;22;Giving this film an `A' and calling it a masterpiece is really a given, so I'm just going to get that part of it out of the way.
I:18062;23;The film is a beautiful and moving epic, complete with stellar performances, poignant life lessons and dramatic (and authentic) presence of life and destiny.
I:18062;24;It is a moving and very `important' film that doesn't strike me the way I expected due to a coldness that permeates the screen.
I:18062;25;The film is filled with elements and situations that would bring a stone.
I:18062;26;like I said in my review of `Schindler's List', it may be an empty argument, but it is one worth raising.
I:18062;27;The film was made at a time when a `happy ending' or at least the portrayal of hope was needed.
I:18062;28;Even with the altered ending though, `The Grapes of Wrath' is a real downer, a film that exposes humanity at its coldest and cruelest (although I was moved more by the slivers of kindness).
I:18062;29;the acting is a triumph here on all ends.
I:18062;30;Henry Fonda carries a solemn understanding in his eyes as he watches everything around him crumble, and he really carries every scene of this film.
I:18062;31;John Carradine is also fantastic as Casy, the former preacher who has lost his spirit due to the circumstances that engulf him.
I:18062;32;Standout here is Jane Darwell, who actually won the Oscar for her tremendous performance.
I:18062;33;Her pleading with Tom to stay and help her, oh, that moment touched me more than any other moment in the film.
I:18062;34;It is a great movie, one that gets everything perfect, and, like `Schindler', that is the big problem.
I:18062;35;It takes away from the languid naturalness of the nature of film.
I:18062;36;The transfer to Blu Ray is impeccable.
I:18062;37;It also has one of the best endings ever.
I:18062;38;it was such a good movie that I would recommend it to all.
I:18062;39;Great American film making by John Ford.
I:18062;40;Henry Fonda as Tom Joad is just great acting.
I:18062;41;A great Steinbeck novel in a movie, shows the desperation and struggle during the dust storms.
I:18062;42;all American's should watch this movie so that they will know about this part of American history.
I:18062;43;They beat, imprisoned,and murdered those who stood up for their human rights.
I:18062;44;With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream .
I:18062;45;but the river, it goes right on.
I:18062;46;This is one of the best movies in the whole world.
I:18062;47;"Henry Fonda gives an amazing performance
I:18062;48;It's a very special movie that can still move me after all these viewings!
I:18062;49;I must say that its reputation is well.
I:18062;50;Yes, Henry Fonda is outstanding, but John Carradine's Jim Casey was the most unforgettable character.
I:18062;51;This is allegory at its finest and its practice may be something that the average is incapable of nowadays.
I:18062;52;The Grapes of Wrath is considered Steinbeck's most important novel, but, even if it wasn't, the plot fits the big screen in the manner of building size saran wrap.
I:18062;53;All of the emotion the author intended us to feel is conveyed by this magnificent John Ford production.
I:18062;54;Its qualities, like those of Gone with the Wind and Casablanca, are truly timeless.
I:18062;55;The people onscreen are people as opposed to ideological constructs.
I:18062;56;Here is humanity and that is why this film continues to resonate.
I:18062;57;He said that's the way it use to be.
I:18062;58;People moving around looking for work.
I:18062;59;Both arrived promptly and in good shape.
I:18062;60;The book had a boring start, but was well worth your time to continue reading.
I:18062;61;This is a great movie to watch centering a family's story around the Great Depression and dust bowl .
I:18062;62;Has always been one of my favorite Henry Fonda movies.
I:18062;63;Anyway, years later I came across this while looking for other documentaries about the Great Depression and I decided to once again own it.
I:18062;64;A black and white film about a man going through the great depression.
I:18062;65;Good to watch for those of us interested in that era .
I:18062;66;I bought this after watching the Ken Burns dust Bowl documentary.
I:18062;67;It's striking how many reviewers here base their comments on a simplisitic comparison between the film version of The Grapes of Wrath and the Steinbeck novel on which it was based.
I:18062;68;What each does well, it does brilliantly.
I:18062;69;As a verbal medium that unfolds slowly, literature is good at offering rich, layered descriptions of person and place and mapping complicated narrative links and Steinbeck makes the most of this in his novel.
I:18062;70;Cinema, by contrast, is an expressive medium that works best through registers of visual and aural metaphor, allegory and performance.
I:18062;71;It is a magnificently cinematic film that uses the expressive capacities of the medium to produce a richly layered experience that is truly moving and that lingers long afterward, sometimes for years or even a whole lifetime.
I:18062;72;It's a film dense with iconic richness and an enduring testament both to the artistry of the many workers that created it, and to the democratic spirit of popular cinema at its very best.
I:18062;73;The book was fantastic and the movie over the top moving.
I:18062;74;I would suggest both, but if you do not have time to read the book, please see the movie.
I:18062;75;This is in the top 100 and well worth the price of the blu.
I:18062;76;It was an excellent portrayal of the challenges of those in our own history.
I:18062;77;In a day where we can take so much for granted, this was a great reminder of how things used to be and the human heart.
I:18062;78;done film and a classic.
I:18062;79;Normally I don't love movies based from books, but The Grapes of Wrath stays so true to the book that I now have to say it is one of my favorite movies.
I:18062;80;This was such a well done film.
I:18062;81;The acting was also wonderful.
I:18062;82;All in all, it's a great film.
I:18062;83;I loved The Grapes of Wrath because it identifies the struggle of many itenerant workers during the dust bowl years.
I:18062;84;We'll go on forever, Pa, 'cause we're the people.The history of the Dustbowl Era is one that looms large in the minds of most of my family.
I:18062;85;"Listed on many critics film lists as the best ever made, at least prior to ""Citizen Kane"" showing up in that position starting in the late 1950's, it tells the story of the Joad family, uprooted from their home in Oklahoma and sent hurtling into a new life in California."
I:18062;86;eventually after many trials and tribulations, the family reaches a camp run by the government (with a camp superintendent played by a man who actually did run such a camp in reality).

I:18062;89;It's a movie worth seeing for performance alone.
I:18062;90;Women like her are, to a great extent, what this country is built on.
I:18062;91;all in all, this is a very personal film that's also quite epic.
I:18062;92;You see the sweeping panoramas for which Ford is rightly famous, but then you also get the small strokes, the tiny personal touches, such as when the children see flush toilets for the first time.
I:18062;93;see for anyone interested in history, and anyone interested in film.
I:18062;94;Henry Fonda is so believable in his starring role in The Grapes of Wrath.
I:18062;95;paced, the movie gets you very emotionally involved in his family's journey from Dust Bowl.
I:18062;96;From the beginning, he seems like he's a bit scared and kind of helpless, and all of them feel that way about leaving their land.
I:18062;97;Once in California, the family is no better off.
I:18062;98;The movie is said to be a lot more hopeful and less politically radical than the book.
I:18062;99;It really opened my eyes to the day.
I:18062;100;Director John Ford is very visually expressive, and on this, he has Citizen Kane cinematographer Gregg Toland working with him, creating a starkness with shadows, a closeness to the land through the composition of the shots, and a documentary feeling.
I:18062;101;"This is not a ""fun"" movie, but it is worthwhile and should make you forever more sympathetic to the plight of the poor."
I:18062;102;A and E Biography always does well at combining personal and private, film footage and interviews, and narration in a fast.
I:18062;103;One thing I found particularly interesting is that The Longest Day and The Sound of Music were both made under intense financial pressure to recover from the extremely wasteful spending of Cleopatra (which starred Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton).
I:18062;104;The Grapes of Wrath, John Ford's unforgettable 1940 drama, is a spiritual horror film.
I:18062;105;Their way of life .
I:18062;106;has abruptly come to an end.
I:18062;107;"there was time when ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was considered the greatest American film ever made (John Ford: The Man and His Films), an epic work portraying the struggles of common people surviving terrible hardship."
I:18062;108;Steinbeck praised the work, a rare vote of confidence for Hollywood from a major author.
I:18062;109;I knew the film's characters and understood their frustrations and insecurities.
I:18062;110;Ford gets so much right with his heartbreaking portrayals, and the extraordinary detail of set decoration mixed with authentic on.
I:18062;111;location footage creates an unparalleled documentary of an American time and place.
I:18062;112;ray] two years later) deserves credit for shooting some of the most vivid scenes in history.
I:18062;113;Steinbeck's knowledge of California and his work as a journalist gave him a wealth of material for his novel, and several of his most unforgettable scenes are faithfully recreated in the film.
I:18062;114;These are real actors, with a background in the theater, who know their craft.
I:18062;115;because the film is so faithful to the book, one may as well just read the book, which is Steinbeck's best and deserves its place in the pantheon of great American novels.
I:18062;116;But the film does have two advantages.
I:18062;117;First, it is made only a year or two after the Depression, so the mood and times are well captured in some of the backgrounds and in the faces of the actors.
I:18062;118;Fonda's ability to portray the rage of Tom Joad that lurks beneath the surface and to articulate in spare words and expressions the unfairness of the treatment of the Okies is extraordinary.
I:18062;119;This is one of the great pieces of acting in the history of American film.
I:18062;120;the progressive spirit of the film and the, I think, justified bashing of the rich given the history of the times may be a bit jarring to the modern viewer.
I:18062;121;But I found that element of the film to be fascinating.
I:18062;122;ford's ending is a bit more uplifting and hopeful than Steinbeck's, with its famous scene of a new mother nursing a struggling Okie.
I:18062;123;an excellent job by Ford and an even better job by Fonda.
I:18062;124;It was filmed during the era and is a very stirring movie.
I:18062;125;A true all star cast!
I:18062;126;This book was very informative and very good.
I:18062;127;I've always enjoyed historically based movies.
I:18062;128;The sets really take you into this era in American history.
I:18062;129;I found myself feeling truly grateful for everything I have, after watching it.
I:18062;130;For me, it's among the top best movies of our times.
I:18062;131;The Grapes Of Wrath is an interesting, beautifully.
I:18062;132;filmed, powerful movie, despite being marred by obvious political bias.
I:18062;133;This is just great photography and camera angles.
I:18062;134;henry Fonda is the lead character and does a fine job as usual but Jane Darwell steals the show as the matriarch of the family.
I:18062;135;The scenes of the family all piled on this old jalopy is one that will stay with you.
I:18062;136;watched this well known movie classic.
I:18062;137;Made in 1940 and starring a young Henry Fonda, it is perhaps the most famous movie about the Great Depression in America.
I:18062;138;preacher turned homeless wanderer, played wonderfully by John Carradine, accompanies them.
I:18062;139;Henry Fonda, the oldest son, becomes and a political activist and leaves the family.
I:18062;140;Henry Fonda is a marvelous actor and this is one of his finest performances.
I:18062;141;And the specter of watching children that are hungry and growing up in such difficult circumstances in America is heartbreaking.
I:18062;142;I was brought up in the fifties and taught that the strong, silent type is the model for young men to emulate.
I:18062;143;"Henry Fonda fits that role to a ""T"" plus he's got smarts and soul."
I:18062;144;Plus there are great character and supporting actors (including the female playing Fonda's mother) in this movie.
I:18062;145;This is one of the most powerful films that I've ever seen.
I:18062;146;Both movies focused on desperate journeys with some unforgettable highs and lows.
I:18062;147;John Carradine is haunting as the disillusioned preacher and Jane Darwell is great as the mother trying to keep things together.
I:18062;148;To me, the most touching scene is early on when the Joads are forced to move from a house that has always been their home.
I:18062;149;Darwell takes a last longing look at souvenirs from her younger years, then throws them in the fire and gets ready to move on.
I:18062;150;the cinematography of this film is gripping, not because of visual beauty .
I:18062;151;But even beyond the squalor, the story masterfully reveals in poignant fashion the life and death hardships and day.
I:18062;152;The acting is great, especially by Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) who won an Oscar for her performance.
I:18062;153;But overlooking the political overtones, the best message to take from the movie is the importance of family and the will for survival.
I:18062;154;The sound is very good too, but at times seems to have a hollow sound to it.
I:18062;155;There are plenty of bonus features on this double.
I:18062;156;This is a great and memorable film.
I:18062;157;wow, gives a good idea what the depression was like here in Oklahoma.
I:18062;158;It was as good as I remembered it was at the time.
I:18062;159;I was always blinded by the film's top.
I:18062;160;verite style that makes you believe you are watching a documentary instead of a filmed novel.
I:18062;161;Fonda, in probably the best performance of his career, gives an understated account of Tom Joad, parolee turned activist that's both convincing and sincere.
I:18062;162;time great performances by an actress, supporting or otherwise.
I:18062;163;The worldweariness on Ma's face tells it all.
I:18062;164;This is one of the greatest film classics of all time.
I:18062;165;A great movie and great teaching tool on many levels.
I:18062;166;This was his favorite movie as it reminded him of his childhood .
I:18062;167;I've watched this movie several times with my dad and its an all time classic of Henry Fonda's .
I:18062;168;Fantastic movie :). . . . . . . .
I:18062;169;good book very interesting story hard to read because of the way words were spoken.
I:18062;170;a testament to fortitude and just a dance could set minds flowing with abundance I doubt this will be the case in the near term, we will prolly look back and see how wonderful their lives were.
I:18062;171;A reminder for those of us who do not know what the United States was like before govenment programs to assist those who are in greatest need.
I:18062;172;Henry Fonda's performance is amazing as well as that of the other excellent actors.
I:18062;173;this movie is a good depiction of a time in our country's history whichwe should be reminded about.
I:18062;174;A good movie to see with older childrenand young adults to stimulate discussion.
I:18062;175;the print of the film has been restored from the best available sources and is very good.
I:18062;176;The restoration comparison really demonstrates how much clearer the picture is, restoring much of the skilled lighting and preserving the deep focus photography.
I:18062;177;the commentary is very helpful because it provides the historical context of the story as well as information about the courage of Darryl F Zanuck to produce a box office hit of almost documentary content.
I:18062;178;"the A&E
I:18062;179;It generates interest in the film without actually showing any scenes from it.
I:18062;180;Wonderful film, beautifully photographed, superb acting.
I:18062;181;This print looks terrific in glorious black and white.
I:18062;182;The content is also tremendously important as well.
I:18062;183;Like a lot of John Ford films no one seems to capture Americana better and 'The Grapes of Wrath' is certainly one of his best film.
I:18062;184;Henry Fonda and John Carradine are so young they looked like they are fresh out of the turnip patch!
I:18062;185;and now I can finally say that I have seen this classic film.
I:18062;186;a great film by any standards with an inspiring story and some wonderful performances from a time long gone.
I:18062;187;There is a defect in the middle of the movie.
I:18062;188;The remainder of the movie is good.
I:18062;189;This is a VERY GOOD MOVIE to watch ,especially with the young generation.
I:18062;190;Great review for a study of the novel.
I:18062;191;I had to go to the beginning and fast foward it and finally got to finish it.
I:18062;192;time greatest films ever made.
I:18062;193;Both the film and novel focus on the Great Depression, and one family who tries to get away from all the poverty by traveling to California.
I:18062;194;The Grapes of Wrath also features a stellar ensemble of brilliant actors.
I:18062;195;This has to be one of Henry Fonda's greatest performances.
I:18062;196;As Tom, he is completely believable and memorable.
I:18062;197;One who is even more memorable is Jane Darwell as Ma (she's a marvel whenever she's on screen).
I:18062;198;"The rest of the cast do very well here
I:18062;199;I had always wanted to see it, especially after reading the book for the second time after many years.
I:18062;200;Truly a great classic film!
I:18062;201;This is a wonderful old classic.
I:18062;202;The product came in excellent condition, and in a timely manner.
I:18062;203;In my opinion, the rigth way to look at it is that it is an important piece of AMERICANA.
I:18062;204;The movie deviates some from the novel, showing a more human and optimistic outlook, and rightly so.
I:18062;205;For comparison, the big band was also a big piece of AMERICANA that started at the same time, a magnificent introduction of a new, optimistic, uniquely American music.
I:18062;206;This is our heritage, and I am thankful to all the talented people who made this possible.
I:18062;207;Both gave me a rare view into a time in America that I knew little about.
I:18062;208;the emotions are deep and while the family undergoes many trials and desperate moments, they continue to have pride, human dignity, and the willingness to share whatever little they had.
I:18062;209;only able to pay for a 10 cent loaf is heart rendering and it is with a certain sense of trepidation that we realize that times in America today are again desperate for many.
I:18062;210;I just love old movies.
I:18062;211;they remind me of the good old days.
I:18062;212;I must admit this film directed by John Ford and starring Henry Fonda, surprised me in a positive way.
I:18062;213;Fonda gives a solid performance as the plain.
I:18062;214;Jane Darwell also gives a very moving performance as his Ma.
I:18062;215;Some may say this movie has its slow parts but it also has some very good moments as well.
I:18062;216;The Joads are just one family, and we certainly expect that each family moving from the south and Midwest to California would have their share of setbacks during the Depression era 1930s, but they embody much more than just a fight for a better life.
I:18062;217;They leave many of their cherished possessions behind (we see this as Ma looks over her possessions one last time in the early part of the film), and they go west with a sense of both optimism and fear.
I:18062;218;one great aspect of John Ford's film is the role he filled for various characters.
I:18062;219;John Carradine does an excellent job as the preacher Jim Casy, from the beginning scene where he meets Tom Joad as they embark towards the Joad house, to him reflecting on the hypocrisy he feels towards preaching.
I:18062;220;While the film does not get into Casy's character at the depth the novel does (which was probably impossible due to the length of the book), Carradine does an excellent job of making Casy's character come to life visually from novel to film.
I:18062;221;"Henry Ford in a superb choice for Tom Joad, and he is able to bring forth the rebellious nature to this character, as well as a change from beginning to end, from a man who wants to ""just get along"" to a man who wants to take up a fight for a people."
I:18062;222;Another fantastic choice was Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, exemplifying the role of keeping the family together at all costs.
I:18062;223;It is easy to see why she won an Oscar for her role.
I:18062;224;another overlooked aspect is just the cinematography, the wonderful scenery and lighting.
I:18062;225;Ford does an excellent job of creating mood with various camera angles and lighting.
I:18062;226;ford does an excellent job of bring Steinbeck's story of the Okies, the migrants of the Dust Bowl, to life.
I:18062;227;This is a significant part of our history, a film that everyone should see, and based on a book that everyone should read.
I:18062;228;Its importance lies in that it is a significant part of our history.
I:18062;229;This is a very moving, touching movie that ages very well.
I:18062;230;The issues covered here like perseverence against great odds, family values, corrupt police and government officials and social divide are still so relevant today.
I:18062;231;The movie is more than 2 hours long and yet it's so good that you don't feel it as the Joad family makes its long journey cross country from Oklahoma to California looking for a way to survive from day to day.
I:18062;232;I enjoyed the special features on the flip side of the disc which had reel.
I:18062;233;life (pun intended) news clips from the actual reports of the great drought of the 1930s and especially the Biography of Darryl F. Zannuck which was very good.
I:18062;234;I actually liked it a lot.
I:18062;235;We need a happy ending for Tom and the whole family.
I:18062;236;With a happy ending, I'll give it 5 stars.
I:18062;237;the service by Amazon was excellent.
I:18062;238;Would highly recommend this to everybody Henry Fonda is great in this movie.
I:18062;239;I much prefer the play and the book!
I:18062;240;This is a great story of the depression and the drought.
I:18062;241;Life as real as it gets.
I:18062;242;This is one the greatest films ever!
I:18062;243;Fonda and eveyone in this film give Osacr worthy performances.
I:18062;244;John Ford shows why he was one of the greatest directors in history.
I:18062;245;Ths story by Steinbeck is just awesome and touching and real!
I:18062;246;This is one of the very best movies to come out of Hollywood.
I:18062;247;All the acting performances are first rate.
I:18062;248;and I enjoyed the way the film is told and Henry Fonda has always been one of my favorite Actors , as well as his daughter Jane Fonda.
I:18062;249;"I recommend this movie to anyone that wishes to understand the plight of the Farmworker, whether they be ""Oakies"",""Mexican"",Filipinos"", etc. its a great !!"
I:18062;250;This Movie will open your eyes.
I:18062;251;The entire last part of the book (cotton picking, Rosasharn giving birth, the flood) is absent in the movie.
I:18062;252;still, it's good to see the American landscape at around the time that the events in the book take place, and I doubt a much better job could have been be done turning this sprawling, dialogue heavy book into a 2.
I:18062;253;Classic movie that arrived promptly and in great condition!
I:18062;254;Quietly frankly a tough film to watch,very personal view of the depression era,that said can I say more with the performace of Henry Fonda and great direction of the best of the film directors in John Ford.
I:18062;255;An absolute stellar cast with John Carridine of among many fine actors who took part in the production of one of the all time greats,This film is why Henry Fonda was one of the very best of the best actors, I love it but tough for me to watch at times.
I:18062;256;Only the genius of John Ford and the merciless pen of Steinbeck could build such powerful movie .
I:18062;257;But with this premise Ford will turn the destiny and will provide of optimist hope for the new and promised land .
I:18062;258;without any doubt , this film is one of the merciless and powerful films which deals with such theme .
I:18062;259;"far from North America , the echoes of the new ideologies shocked the world 
I:18062;260;the Manhattan Project was in full development and Walt Disney handseled Fantasy.
I:18062;261;This was a very interesting movie.
I:18062;262;Instead of being quirky humor characters, they say many interesting things that may make you reflect on your own life in that manner.
I:18062;263;compared to, say, Harry Potter this movie is brilliant.
I:18062;264;It follows the storyline more than any other movie I've seen and really has some amazing acting by Henry Fonda.
I:18062;265;This movie is a classic!
I:18062;266;That aside the movie is still a great stand.
I:18062;267;alone and you should enjoy it even if you haven't read the book.
I:18062;268;All in all I am very pleased.
I:18062;269;Muley is wonderful in both the book and the movie (that ol' graveyard ghost .
I:18062;270;you got to love him), but I'd have to say Henry Fonda didn't do it for me as Tom Joad.
I:18062;271;boy close up of his face and it just seems to beam of joyous rapture I felt a slight need to chuckle.
I:18062;272;Other than that, I think the movie is worth it.
I:18062;273;Often literature and movies sway our thinking into believing things were as depicted in a work of fiction, while maybe in reality it was not generally that way.
I:18062;274;I believed the story as it went along until it got to that point.
I:18062;275;But, that was a small part of an otherwise powerful movie.
I:18062;276;This is a great movie based on a great novel, and I am surprised by how honestly the film captures the raw humanity of the book.
I:18062;277;Steinbeck weaved social commentary into the story, and the movie makes many points about the human condition and spirit without being heavy.
I:18062;278;The story of the Joads and their fight for survival rings very true, thanks to the realistic performances and the atmosphere created by director John Ford.
I:18062;279;Henry Fonda gives one of the best performances I have ever seen him give, and his I'll be there speech is one of the great movie moments.
I:18062;280;Jane Darwell is also very impressive, and her direct, down.
I:18062;281;earth style of acting makes the quiet strength and the suffering of Ma Joad seem very real.
I:18062;282;The Grapes of Wrath is an American classic, both as a novel and as a film.
I:18062;283;other than that, the acting was GREAT and the overall experience was good.
I:18062;284;Director John Ford has done a masterful job of bringing John Steinbeck's timeless novel to life in this movie.
I:18062;285;Starring Henry Fonda, Ford's film brings the struggle of the 1930s migrant working family to life.
I:18062;286;The government agent comes to inform John that his land is being taken over, and the family packs their truck and begins the journey to California.
I:18062;287;All through these troubled times, Ma does her best to keep the family together.
I:18062;288;Will the Joad family survive?This movie, like the novel, has become a classic.
I:18062;289;The movie was nominated for numerous academy awards, and Jane Darwell won for best actress, while John Ford won for best director.
I:18062;290;The portrayal of life on the plains during the dustbowl years is done with great accuracy.
I:18062;291;The acting is excellent and the story is moving.
I:18062;292;i give this movie my highest recommendation.
I:18062;293;The acting and story are great, and the historical aspect of the time period is handled perfectly.
I:18062;294;Watch this classic movie and see what the lives of the migrant farmer families of the dustbowl years were like.
I:18062;295;"I use it for my peace and justice class and it truly gets the point of ""structural violence"" across to my students."
I:18062;296;"Directed by John Ford and adapted from the famous novel by John Steinbeck, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a gloomy masterpiece that challenges many of the assumptions we have about capitalism."
I:18062;297;his mind is on something much bigger.
I:18062;298;wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there.
I:18062;299;I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry and they know supper's ready, and when the people are eatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they build .
I:18062;300;Indeed as most reviewers note this film and story and cinematography is one of those unparalleled for overall brilliance in the portrayal of what is considered the plight of the common man in the throes of the dust bowl and depression popularized in modern music by Pete Seeger,Bruce Springsteen, Jack Kerouac in literature and the artistic expression of most anything labelled left.
I:18062;301;this movie has a sublime power because it easily juxtaposes and makes one take sides between the family and the individual,love and hate, exploitation and fairness, Capitalism or benevolent Federalism all renderd in classic black and white nuanced beauty.
I:18062;302;despite themes of exploitation and abuse it is possible to see the makings of an American epic and country in formation and development in which the movie pays it's homage.
I:18062;303;It makes you feel better about today's economy.
I:18062;304;"When John Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize in 1962, special mention was given to this novel:""the great work"", it was labeled."
I:18062;305;if the film itself is dated after 67 years, the American spirit of greed in many is alive and well, thank you.
I:18062;306;however you view the world, please view this classic American film.
I:18062;307;this is not a feel good movie, unless you enjoy seeing people struggle just to survive.
I:18062;308;For most of the characters in the movie, they are all over the map with their behaviors, however the Mom is consistently a hopeful and optimistic influence, if only she can keep the family together and avoid becoming like the animals .
I:18062;309;You feel you understand what the Great Depression was like.
I:18062;310;One of the rare films that respected the book.
I:18062;311;I feel the best American novel EVER!
I:18062;312;The film respected Stinebeck's genius.
I:18062;313;The reproduction on Blu Ray was a good job as far as I could tell.
I:18062;314;As directed by the brilliant John Ford, this movie is poetry.
I:18062;315;With Henry Fonda giving the performance of his career as Tom Joad, and actress Jane Darwell winning an Oscar for her brilliant portrayal of Tom's beleaguered mother.
I:18062;316;It is a movie that speaks to the indomitable nature of the human spirit.
I:18062;317;I have shown this movie in my economics classes and the students seemed to enjoy it and have empathy for the characters portrayed in the film.
I:18062;318;This movie provides a unique experience to the students by visually engaging them and giving them knowledge through the film in historical perspective from a truly timeless movie that todays students may not see anywhere else during thier lives other than my classroom.
I:18062;319;This movie is one of the great treasures of our history!!!
I:18062;320;"For years ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was considered the best American film ever made."
I:18062;321;Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by John Steinbeck, the movie is directed by John Ford and stars Henry Fonda giving one of the best performances in the history of cinema.
I:18062;322;The Grapes of Wrath is, in many ways, still the greatest American film in the sense that the film is about America, at a certain time and captures the feeling of The Great Depression better than most any other movie.
I:18062;323;Fonda plays Tom Joad, one of the most legendary characters of all time.
I:18062;324;After serving four years in prison for manslaughter, Tom is paroled and returns home to Oklahoma to see his family.
I:18062;325;"One of the key elements of the films' success is the cinematography, by the legendary Gregg Toland (cinematographer on ""Citizen Kane"")."
I:18062;326;The film is in black and white, which has aged a lot better than color would have and features a lot of night scenes.
I:18062;327;In many scenes, characters are illuminated by a mere candle.
I:18062;328;"The Grapes of Wrath has astonishingly not dated over the years
I:18062;329;"The film has legendary dialogue (the ""I'll be there"" speech) and a number of other things that make it so great."
I:18062;330;Saying a movie is a masterpiece is one thing, but getting people to see it is another.
I:18062;331;This is a terrific film that should be seen by any lover of film.
I:18062;332;john Steinbeck and John Ford did America proud, allowing us to look inward to discover solutions for our social problems.
I:18062;333;tom Joad (Henry Fonda) and Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) are the central characters of this film, but many other, richly defined, roles can be found here.
I:18062;334;each secondary member of the cast has something invaluable to add to the story and the standout is the great John Carradine as the disillusioned, x. preacher, Casey.
I:18062;335;I absolutely love this movie, I think you will too.
I:18062;336;his films hold up well today because they display his personal love of character, land, place (there is a difference), time, honor, tradition and ritual.
I:18062;337;THE GRAPES OF WRATH is one of his finest pictures.
I:18062;338;His obsessions and political leanings come to life in Steinbeck's haunting, searing and highly religious narrative.
I:18062;339;Certainly the other great political film directors Leni Reifenstahl and Sergei Eisenstein can be see in many of Ford's compositions.
I:18062;340;This film is loaded with one emotional image after another.
I:18062;341;the photography of Gregg Toland matches the best of Life Magazine in its immediacy and realism, while at the same time dramatically recapturing the best of German Expressionsim.
I:18062;342;the cast is uniformly excellent.
I:18062;343;The sincere and utterly real performances of John Carradine, Russell Simpson, Jane Darwell, John Qualen and the great Charley Grapewin all give performances that are on the level with anything ever produced from an Actor's Studio graduate.
I:18062;344;Simply put it is one of the finest characterizations ever captured on film.
I:18062;345;He was not just an American icon, he was a fine dramatic artist.
I:18062;346;the script retains much of the best of Steinbeck's novel and many of its great quotes.
I:18062;347;"This is a lesson so many ""serious"" filmmakers have yet to learn."
I:18062;348;In that sense it transcends nationalism and is a fine work of World Literature.
I:18062;349;It is an equal with CITIZEN KANE as one of the finest films ever made.
I:18062;350;very pleased with the content and actors.
I:18062;351;I bought this for a gift for a friend.
I:18062;352;Loved the book even more than the movie, but I believe justice was done with the film.
I:18062;353;This video was received in excellent condition and with quick service.
I:18062;354;Someday someone will go through and find it and think ahhh an old good movie.
I:18062;355;A must see if you havent watched it.
I:18062;356;the oldies are the best
I:18062;357;This is one of the truly great American films that depict a devastating time in the lives of the farmers that inhabited Oklahoma when over farming had created the dust bowl .
I:18062;358;These people moved west in overwhelming numbers.
I:18062;359;A sort of history lesson by viewing Americans making necessary and courageous moves to survive and live.
I:18062;360;Found one at a local library, the other here.
I:18062;361;On the trip the family faces countless hardships, which seems to continue as they arrive in the the promise land of California.
I:18062;362;Tom witnesses how his family and many others are being taken advantage of and how people are being considered good.
I:18062;363;Grapes of Wrath is based on John Steinbeck's novel with the same name which sends a powerful socioeconomic message about poverty, social injustice, and freedom where the dollar seems to guide all.
I:18062;364;It also conveys a strong notion of hope, family, and determination, which can be the source of a better life.
I:18062;365;The story's messages are equally important today as they were in 1940, and Ford does a brilliant job in depicting these issues on the silver screen.
I:18062;366;Grapes of Wrath is an exceptional film that leaves the audience with a brilliant cinematic experience that will resound throughout the viewers lives as they will face these issues repeatedly.
I:18062;367;One of the best black and white movies about the depression era I have ever seen.
I:18062;368;The movie will bring you to tears.
I:18062;369;Such begins the adventure to California.
I:18062;370;Comparing the novel to the movie is quite a task.
I:18062;371;The novel takes hours to finish reading, and by the end you truly feel that you are incorporated into the Joad's hardship.
I:18062;372;The novel is an amazing piece of literature, and the movie does not do it justice.
I:18062;373;This 1940 classic is a film that was remarkable for its time and still packs a punch today.
I:18062;374;It is a movie that contains a very complex political message within a very simple story of simple people.
I:18062;375;It takes a very basic story of a family moving to California during the depression and turns it into a powerful, enthralling and heartfelt film about people, politics and the way the world works.
I:18062;376;It is an excellent adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel, which even Steinbeck himself declared to be a powerful thing on its own.
I:18062;377;Tom's family decides to do the same and the rest of the movie is about the hardships these people come across on the way to and in California.
I:18062;378;known story that is loved by many people but the true core of the story is the political message within.
I:18062;379;"It is a very leftist film and the message of the verge of communist or ""red"" but it was at the time a very real and much needed idealism."
I:18062;380;the directing is fantastic and who would expect anything less from John Ford who is considered by most to be one of the, if not the greatest director from the days of old Hollywood.
I:18062;381;"This is one of the films that proves this statement and is bested only by ""The Searchers"" in my opinion."
I:18062;382;The skill in which Ford frames his shots is incredible and quite unheard of for the time.
I:18062;383;The lighting is one of the best parts of the film and Ford uses every available chance to use natural lighting usually at the hand of a candle or match and the results are astounding.
I:18062;384;The film has a feeling and a huge amount of style to it.
I:18062;385;It is truly a work of art.
I:18062;386;"I'm shocked the movie even got made in the U. s.""."
I:18062;387;steinbeck's book is amazing and the movie is a powerful adaptation that is fit for any fan of great movies, particularly fans of films that have a social message to deliver.
I:18062;388;This is one of the all time great classic movies.
I:18062;389;Henry Fonda plays a terrific character.
I:18062;390;This movies is set during the great depression, one of the saddest times in American history.
I:18062;391;This is a movie we will watch over and over.
I:18062;392;This is a classic story (and a long one) like we no longer make in modern cinema.
I:18062;393;Read the book and see how they adapted it into this film.
I:18062;394;"I have absolutely no problem with the idea that the greatest ending in American literature comes on the final pages of John Steinbeck's novel ""The Grapes of Wrath."""
I:18062;395;The symbolism of the final image of Rosasharn and the starving man is as potent as anything every found in an American novel, whether you are talking white whales or green.
I:18062;396;tinted glasses and silver slippers.
I:18062;397;"while Johnson remains remarkably faithful to the novel for most of the film, it is helpful to remember that a year earlier he had written the screenplay for ""Jesse James,"" and there is clearly a sense in which the Tom Joad of this film is a ""good"" outlaw in a similar sense."
I:18062;398;The Joads struggle to stay alive and stay together, and it seems that they are not going to be able to afford pride or dignity.
I:18062;399;wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there.
I:18062;400;The film's final line, which belongs to Ma Joad, sounds like something we would expect from a Capracorn movie.
I:18062;401;"director John Ford directs this black and white film with the same sense of human spectacle set against the grandeur of the American landscape that he displayed in his westerns ""Fort Apache"" and ""Rio Grande."""
I:18062;402;"The black and white cinematography by Gregg Toland provides a documentary like nature, recalling Dorothea Lange's famous 1936 photograph ""Migrant Mother."
I:18062;403;"Ford and Darwell won Oscars, but Alfred Hitchock's Rebecca"" and Jimmy Stewart in ""The Philadelphia Story"" won for Best Picture and Best Actor respectively."
I:18062;404;I have seen this movie more times than I can count, and it is justly included among the all.
I:18062;405;I have known people like the Joads in my lifetime, and their simple dignity is the linchpin of this story.
I:18062;406;Every aspect of the production is wonderful, and the actors rise to the challenge of the story.
I:18062;407;Truly a work of art which will continue to stand the test of time.
I:18062;408;It was very moving, and I am aware of the word okie's .
I:18062;409;Highly recommend this movie for university students.
I:18062;410;This 1940 film, based on John Steinbeck's novel depicts the searing injustices to a family of Oklahoma sharecroppers during the Depression.
I:18062;411;And Jane Darwell, cast as Ma Joad, won an academy award for her performance.
I:18062;412;I read the book years ago and it will forever be seared in my memory.
I:18062;413;And even though the film left out the most memorable scene of all, I was moved by the family's plight, as they joined the great migration to California in a rickety truck.
I:18062;414;the film has stood the time well if viewed as a history lesson.
I:18062;415;It was a horrible time in America and it certainly is realistic in depicting the times in general and the plight of the Okies in particular.
I:18062;416;On the whole, I feel it is a serious film well worth viewing, especially for those who find it difficult to understand what living through the Depression was like.
I:18062;417;Of course I recommend it.
I:18062;418;John Steinbeck's articles and books on the topic led to this award winning (AFI #21) movie by John Ford.
I:18062;419;and California is innundated with workers.
I:18062;420;it's amazing that the books are banned in schools .
I:18062;421;I definitely recommend watching this movie as an important history lesson about what our ancestors struggled through .
I:18062;422;This is such a great movie of really poor people and their children who work on migrant farms.
I:18062;423;thanks Amazon and moviemars for being there!
I:18062;424;This is such a wonderful adaptation of the classic John Steinbeck novel.
I:18062;425;The Joad family is so rich in love and hope against poverty.
I:18062;426;So they pack up what they can carry on their dilapidated truck and head west.
I:18062;427;Of course, the book which won a Pulitzer Prize for Steinbeck is wonderful, the movie is very well written and not to far of track.
I:18062;428;Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad and does a wonderful job.
I:18062;429;it's a very good story of hope over adversity and is timeless.
I:18062;430;I hope people enjoy it as much as I do.
I:18062;431;A realistic portrayal of a family that is run off their farmland in Oklahoma during the Great Depression, going from a bleak existence, to an even bleaker one in pursuit of jobs in California.
I:18062;432;It is inspiring in some ways because regardless of what happened, they persevered.
I:18062;433;Today American workers are increasingly facing competition from Asia, Mexico, and illegals from Mexico, lowering wages and taking jobs.
I:18062;434;this is how my Mom's family came to live in Washington it fits to the T. I am thankful they were tougher than me
I:18062;435;"Outstanding performances by Henry Fonda as Tom Joad
I:18062;436;"deserved Oscar)
I:18062;437;Their friend Casey comes along.
I:18062;438;this is a film that I can watch over and over.
I:18062;439;It is to good to look at others lives and put yourself in their place.
I:18062;440;And show more compassion to be a great neighbor.
I:18062;441;I love this movie and have to admit I enjoy it more than the book.
I:18062;442;An amazing achievement for all involved and Henry Fonda probably had his greatest performance in this picture.
I:18062;443;John Ford, Gregg Toland and others involved with this picture did a fine job.
I:18062;444;Jane Darwell gives a wonderful performance as Ma Joad.
I:18062;445;I know The Grapes of Wrath is one of the most iconic, beloved historical landmarks in the art of filmmaking and it has some good things going for it, technically speaking.
I:18062;446;Some of the shots look REALLY good, especially the desert and farmland scenes.
I:18062;447;Henry Fonda plays sincere and honest very well and does a great job with his facial expressions especially during his farewell speech towards the end of the film.
I:18062;448;And I'll agree that Jane Darwell deserved her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as the world.
I:18062;449;take a look at some of the films I've given five stars.
I:18062;450;I do not necessarily have to identify, sympathize with or care about the main character but I must find something intriguing, engaging or thought.
I:18062;451;This is just how I perceive it.
I:18062;452;If you have a heart, this ones a tear jerker .
I:18062;453;Turn it into a movie and let John Ford direct it, and get Henry Fonda to star.
I:18062;454;as good as the film is, it really should be a companion.
I:18062;455;piece to Steinbeck's original masterpiece, and if you haven't read it I recommend setting aside enough time to read one of the greatest pieces of American literature ever written.
I:18062;456;that being said, the medium of the cinema allows for a visual impact that can't be matched with the written word.
I:18062;457;the Grapes of Wrath follows the Joad family during the great depression.
I:18062;458;thousands of Okies packed up the house after being foreclosed and moved out to California .
I:18062;459;The theme of the movie, and of Steinbeck's book, is the ability of the human spirit to remain intact in these worst of times.
I:18062;460;But as the story proceeds we see that they are fundamentally decent, hard.
I:18062;461;working people, and every time life knocks them down they get back up, brush the dirt off themselves, and keep moving forward.
I:18062;462;As a national characteristic, this was an important trait because this was the generation that produced the hard.
I:18062;463;perfect, with Henry Fonda as the spirited Tom Joad and John Carradine as the former preacher with a new social consciousness.
I:18062;464;deserved Best Supporting Actress Award as Ma Joad, and the remainder of the cast is in every way equal to the story and the film.
I:18062;465;old daughter (she had to read the novel for school, and I thought it would be fun to revisit the film).
I:18062;466;When I first saw the movie, years ago, I thought it was a decent adaptation of an American literary classic.
I:18062;467;it's hard to believe that John Ford, who directed THE SEARCHERS (probably the greatest American film ever made), was also responsible for this.
I:18062;468;the acting was good, though how can it not be with this cast?
I:18062;469;And there were moments of humor and poignancy.
I:18062;470;It's just a part of our history and our will to survive.
I:18062;471;Just wanted to say that this is one of my all time favorites,good cast and story Thanks
I:18062;472;The acting is easily some of the best I've ever seen.
I:18062;473;"at the very end there was a lump in my throat
I:18062;474;"The script could not have been better
I:18062;475;"Of course, the film can't quite match all the detail of John Steinbeck's 450+ page book
I:18062;476;happy tone is set for the rest of the picture.
I:18062;477;"Muley then tells Tom and Casy that Tom's family is at their Uncle John's (Frank Darien) home
I:18062;478;"Ma Joad (Jane Darwell in an Oscar winning performance) is thankful that Tom reached them before they left Oklahoma
I:18062;479;Suffice it to say that the movie was brilliantly executed and the attention to detail remains extremely impressive, to say the least.
I:18062;480;The plot and the action are extremely realistic as well.
I:18062;481;and even more!The Grapes of Wrath is so well done and packs such a punch that it should be required viewing for anybody when they're old enough to understand the issues explored and depicted in this film.
I:18062;482;"The film accurately depicts the harsh severities of life for so many people at that time in our country's history
I:18062;483;"John Ford was a fascinating director in the way he emphasized a point while downplaying a scene at the same time, as when Casey is ""Preaching"" inside the tent about wages and going on strike while Tom and others sit at his feet (It's like a mini version of the Sermon on the Mount)."
I:18062;484;The movie played fine until about 2/3rds of the way through and then it began to break up and finally froze.
I:18062;485;Good adaptation of Steinbeck's superb novel.
I:18062;486;there are promised work in California and pack up their dilapadated truck with their family including the grandmother (I wonder if the idea for The Beverly Hillbillies came from this) and have a grueling trip there.
I:18062;487;this was probably Fonda's best role as the noble Tom Joad.
I:18062;488;John Carridine is also excellent in a supporting role.
I:18062;489;this film is historical and an important statement on how corruption lead to the formation of unions and workers rights!
I:18062;490;While I loved the book madly, I simply liked the film version of it very much.
I:18062;491;"The actors are good
I:18062;492;like I do.you'll really like this one.
I:18062;493;It's better than most of the classics I've seen.
I:18062;494;But I can also sympathize with those people who find that the older movies put them to sleep.
I:18062;495;Fine performances and gorgeous cinematography.
I:18062;496;it's a beautiful film to watch with especially strong performances especially from John Carradine, Jane Darwell, and Henry Fonda.
I:18062;497;Henry Fonda is perfectly cast.
I:18062;498;When I ordered this I received this within 3 days and it arrived in pristine condition!
I:18062;499;I was VERY pleased on both the timeliness and the condition on which it arrived.
I:18062;500;i know this movie is a classic and won oscars and was directed by one of the great directors John Ford.
I:18062;501;Most know the story, or had to read it in high school, and it makes most best lists.
I:18062;502;It is a history lesson and teaches unionization, and it is all these things.
I:18062;503;There were dances and they could eat and help pay there way by helping in the camp.
I:18062;504;so with everything this movie is, in this day and age that is the message that rang loudest to me.
I:18062;505;The great depression of the thirties is a similar type of depression that has sprung about in modern day culture.
I:18062;506;the Grapes of Wrath is a reminder of humble means.
I:18062;507;This John Ford masterpiece is a gritty story of a family's struggle for survival during the Dust Bowl of the Thirties.
I:18062;508;Ford has always been a master of geographic realism, and his powerful shots of the dust storms, the rickety truck that carries the Joads west and the intense acting scenes played against vivid backdrop sceneryare gripping.
I:18062;509;the Grapes of Wrath has long been recognized as a great film, perhaps the best, that illustrates the Depression and the despair experienced by so many Americans.
I:18062;510;Nothing to say that others haven't said I am sure, but I think this was a great copy at a great price.
I:18062;511;just a great old classic and at a great price!
I:18062;512;This is an old black and white movie, but a long lasting master piece based on a great novel.
I:18062;513;The novel and the movie look at the struggle of so many people with poverty and desperation in the after.
I:18062;514;mass of the great depression.
I:18062;515;It shows how civility and humanity endures and how our kindness and compassion for each other stands above all the events and problems.
I:18062;516;A wonderful movie for all to view.
I:18062;517;This story has a great moralto it.
I:18062;518;which gives one something to have each day of our lives.
I:18062;519;A great classic film in every respect.
I:18062;520;The film and it's message are timeless.
I:18062;521;A must see for any movie buff.
I:18062;522;Like a lot of John Ford films no one seems to capture Americana better and 'The Grapes of Wrath' is certainly one of his best film.
I:18062;523;Henry Fonda and John Carradine are so young they looked like they are fresh out of the turnip patch!
I:18062;524;and now I can finally say that I have seen this classic film.
I:18062;525;a great film by any standards with an inspiring story and some wonderful performances from a time long gone.
I:18062;526;I will say that this film is Henry Fonda best, and he holds your heart like no one does, and never lets go for an instant.
I:18062;527;Jane Darwell is simply perfect as her role as his mother, and her will and determination is the heart and soul of this movie.
I:18062;528;John Ford has made perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made, and made a timely massage about the faith of the human Sprit.
I:18062;529;I love the old movies.
I:18062;530;I can watch them with my family without excusing myself because of the fou.
I:18062;531;Jane Darwell is brilliant as Ma Joad, the defiant, resilient and compelling matriarch who keeps the family together through these tough times.
I:18062;532;Dark was the world of the 1930s in reality, but never was it more magically brought to life than in this inspirational film of hope, courage and the dream of prosperity that must have seemed so far out of reach at the time of the film's general release.
I:18062;533;Greg Tolland's evocative camera work is magnificently captured.
I:18062;534;The gray scale, for the most part is well balanced and captures the stark harshness of the original presentation.
I:18062;535;There is some shimmering of fine details and more than a hint of pixelization in this transfer.
I:18062;536;"One should expect no less!BOTTOM LINE: ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is an enduring tale of enduring souls caught in the uncertainty of their times."
I:18062;537;It is defined still today as one of the most socialists film to come out from mainstream Hollywood.
I:18062;538;Greg Tolland's photography and the sweeping force of the story will blow you away.
I:18062;539;Now I can watch this movie anytime I want.
I:18062;540;The price was right for old classic movie like this.
I:18062;541;Excellent movie for understanding American History!
I:18062;542;I would recommended this movie for adults and 4th grade and up!
I:18062;543;Good movie with a really good story line, but the ending was disappointing.
I:18062;544;The story line followed the book closly and the acting was great.
I:18062;545;The mood and conditions of the times in America, between the two world wars, was captured beautifully.
I:18062;546;I have always made a point to watch it when it came on TV.
I:18062;547;This movie has got to be among the top 10 of amyone's list, seems to me.
I:18062;548;I actually enjoyed it better than the book.
I:18062;549;Acting, directing, writing, photography all par excellence!
I:18062;550;It was one of Fonda's best acting jobs.
I:18062;551;Family loyalty is the theme that comes through.
I:18062;552;I recommend it for the whole family.
I:18062;553;A great example of a family struggling to survive .
I:18062;554;Once in a while there comes a film that completely moves you.
I:18062;555;The movie has three major components that make it an excellent film, a story based on the classic novel by John Steinbeck, the magnificent cinematography, and the historical significance in terms of American history.
I:18062;556;The film is a reflection of the workingman and American society during the Great Depression as well of the results of the New Deal .
I:18062;557;changing society, but always keeping the past in mind.
I:18062;558;the film has its defining moments.
I:18062;559;Another defining moment is the last few minutes of the film.
I:18062;560;It is one of the most legendary and empowering scenes in American film history, which shows Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) making his most moving soliloquy.
I:18062;561;dated, the story is a part of American history, and it brings an understanding and realization of the hardships that those who owned and lived on farms from the Midwest and dust bowl states experienced during the late 1920s and 1930s in order to continue to live the American dream.
I:18062;562;Populism v. Progressivism is another feature pointed up in so many ways in Grapes.
I:18062;563;it is a great movie if you love a great story being told with not a lot of action going on.
I:18062;564;According to the way they described it, the Grapes of Wrath displays it as closely as my imagination could envision it.
I:18062;565;This movie just gets better with age.
I:18062;566;I have watched this movie a number of times and am always impressed by the look and feel of the movie.
I:18062;567;a very well made movie everyone should watch.
I:18062;568;what fun), the second feature is an extremely brief prologue of the movie to the UK (as if people in the UK had never heard of the Great Depression!)
I:18062;569;This movie works great with my US History class.
I:18062;570;era novel, Grapes of Wrath, the industry was stunned.
I:18062;571;They were all the more surprised when the resultant film, directed by John Ford, proved to be one of Hollywood's finest achievement.
I:18062;572;this story of a family of Oklahoma sharecroppers who leave the oppressive poverty of the Dust Bowl in hope of finding a better life in Californnia was told with all of Ford's considerable artistry, and it featured compelling performances by Jane Darwell as the matriarch of the clan and Henry Fonda as the son who is driven to radicalism by the intolerable conditions that grind his family down.
I:18062;573;The Grapes of Wrath is a superb motion picture which could scarcely be improved upon.
I:18062;574;Acting, photography, direction combine to make this an unforgettable experience, a poem of a film.
I:18062;575;I really enjoyed this movie, the young Henry Fonda was great actor.
I:18062;576;Also it good seeing troubles the people from Oklahoma had to though just to keep food on the table.
I:18062;577;Its amazing to see what the US passed through in this era.
I:18062;578;We were very strong then yes
I:18062;579;I've wanted to see this film for many years and I must say I enjoyed it very much.
I:18062;580;the film is VERY faithful to the book, with much of the dialogue having been directly extracted.
I:18062;581;But, there is no way the movie could have contained the detail, historical background, local color and just sheer brilliant descriptions that can be captured in a 600.
I:18062;582;"outstanding performances: Fonda in a performance generally regarded as one of his best
I:18062;583;then see the movie, perhaps the best literary/cinematic pairing ever.
I:18062;584;There's almost always more to the story when you read the book.
I:18062;585;John Steinbecks book is the most beautiful book ever written and this movie is an abomination.
I:18062;586;The Grapes of Wrath great human story of a family disposses by the dust bowl who make it to California to search for work.
I:18062;587;This is the classic performance by Henry Fonda.
I:18062;588;It is a great movie and an outstanding performance.
I:18062;589;This is a great movie.
I:18062;590;John Ford makes an unforgettable movie out of a great book.
I:18062;591;one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:18062;592;THe commentary on this disc is expecially fulfilling, and the extras are definitely worthy of this releases.
I:18062;593;Great movie, well acted and a real bargain at the price I bought it for.
I:18062;594;I love amazon and am now a loyal fan.
I:18062;595;and more than anyone, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is simple, realistic, and pretty heartwrenching.
I:18062;596;The lead is played quietly but effectively by Henry Fonda, always very good as the somewhat yokel.
I:18062;597;These are also quiet, strong performances, and it's in these performances that the real strength of the story comes out.
I:18062;598;You can relate to these people, to their hardship, and to their various reactions.
I:18062;599;When the film starts, we get a good ten minutes of pure dialogue .
I:18062;600;This is riveting film because the characters are coming to life before our eyes.
I:18062;601;"Instead, we get an ""inspiring"" speech from Ma about how the Joads will just keep going and going, representing the ""common people"" ."
I:18062;602;stirring sentiment, yeah, but it doesn't make any sense.
I:18062;603;His guiding hand is there .
I:18062;604;you can see it in the pacing, in the lingering close.
I:18062;605;"winning cinematographer Gregg Toland's beautiful photography (perhaps better remembered for ""Citizen Kane,"" the following year)."
I:18062;606;It's still worth seeing, and it's still a good movie, but there are many other films .
I:18062;607;This movie is fantastic, especially if you start to feel a little bit cocky or troubled.
I:18062;608;Its a Stand up movie about our country's history an how our nation was founded on God.
I:18062;609;it shows how blessed many of us are to have all the things that we usually take forgranted that they didnt have.
I:18062;610;Love how there are scenes in the movie that shows The Lord at work (on the people's hearts)!
I:18062;611;I loved Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in Yours Mine and Ours and thought I would love this but hated this and threw it away.
I:18062;612;John Ford along with filmmaker Darryl Zanuck wanted to make an epic and I believe they succeeded.
I:18062;613;west wiped out half the agricultural input of the USA!Tom hooks up with his family and they head out towards California for the hope of getting a job.
I:18062;614;"the film has several themes: women adapt to these despairing times
I:18062;615;henry Fonda is amazing as the quiet, strong young man who sees the corruption and wants to do something about it.
I:18062;616;Still, I learned a lot about Steinbeck actually liking this film and how the American Farmer Association at the time wanted to boycott theaters that played this film.
I:18062;617;john Ford's use of cinematic lighting (the candle) and special effects (the superimposed harvest machine blades, the black and white grainy looks) was amazing.
I:18062;618;To those who know something about John Steinbeck's novel, it is enough to say that the picture is way ahead of anything even the most hopeful had reason to expect.
I:18062;619;It is all beautifully direct and literal, like clear.
I:18062;620;If Johnson's script narrows the gist of the story to only what happens to the Joad family, director John Ford had spread it wide again, in the way that only a movie can do.
I:18062;621;Perhaps John Carradine and Grant Mitchell give an occasional impression of doing their stuff, but the rest, from the most casual extra to the stars, might have been caught in some episode of actual life.
I:18062;622;Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are the most important because they embody the main spirit of the drama: they both fill their parts with such life, that they are peerless in their playing.
I:18062;623;"THE GRAPES OF WRATH proved that Hollywood could lead the world in serious as well as merely entertaining pictures
I:18062;624;Although it cannot hold a candle to the Steinbeck novel itself, this movie does a genuinely good job of capturing the plight of Americans caught between a drought and starvation.
I:18062;625;Everyone should see this movie.
I:18062;626;What a Great movie, one of the best.
I:18062;627;My Mama loved watching this, even though she cried throughout it.
I:18062;628;The okies were tough, strong and proud folks.
I:18062;629;"As Jane Darwell so aptly put it "" were the people and the people keepa agoin"" A true American classic!"
I:18062;630;It really touches a person, I tell you.
I:18062;631;if you love history, you can appreciate the time period.
I:18062;632;If you love good acting, you can appreciate the cast.
I:18062;633;ish movies, you can appreciate the constant tension.
I:18062;634;If you love old films, you can appreciate the nice black.
I:18062;635;* And if you love a beautiful tale, you can appreciate the whole thing.
I:18062;636;And it gives you the freedom to use your imagination more.
I:18062;637;i really liked the movie.
I:18062;638;provoking and insightful, it's something I'm glad I've watched.
I:18062;639;If you think you remember this movie, watch it again.
I:18062;640;One should keep in touch with these movies.
I:18062;641;Worth discussing with children and those who can remember from their own experience.
I:18062;642;And I had always liked this movie.
I:18062;643;Then I read the book and was completely absorbed and deeply affected by it.
I:18062;644;Although the film makes a bold attempt to convey how tough life was for the Dust Bowl Okies during the Great Depression .
I:18062;645;The family chats hopefully as they drive along in their jalopy towards the work that awaits them.
I:18062;646;Matriarch Ma Joad is the role that Darwell was born to play .
I:18062;647;She won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 1941 for her portrayal.
I:18062;648;nominee Fonda finds a good balance between tough and compassionate in his portrayal of Tom Joad.
I:18062;649;John Carradine is memorable as Casy the ill.
I:18062;650;"It is also noteworthy that John Ford won a Best Director Oscar in 1941 for ""The Grapes of Wrath""."
I:18062;651;Yet another highlight of the film is Gregg Toland's top.
I:18062;652;"This is a review of the new BD of the classic film ""The Grapes of Wrath""."
I:18062;653;That should help guide you.
I:18062;654;The Grapes of Wrath (TGOW) is a classic film and one that everyone should see.
I:18062;655;release by Fox is timely as much of the US is still in a recession and unemployment is high.
I:18062;656;"The BD also gives you the option of watching the film with the ""forward"" included in the British release, which the producers decided was necessary to explain the economic conditions in the US to the British theater audience."
I:18062;657;A nice touch for completeness.
I:18062;658;The film gets five stars (I love it), the bonuses three stars (it's OK) and formatting between 3 and 4 stars.
I:18062;659;i hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
I:18062;660;Given these substantial hurdles, it's amazing this film ever got made.
I:18062;661;the Film: Gregg Toland's starkly gray cinematography perfectly captures the mood of the novel, and even though many scenes are obviously filmed on a sound stage, the primary drawback seems to be a slight echo, which at times can be a bit distracting.
I:18062;662;"The casting of Henry Fonda as Tom Joad could not have been better and the acting throughout is very good, especially Jane Darwell's portrayal of Ma Joad, the ""rock"" and moral compass of the family."
I:18062;663;There are so many brilliant scenes in this film that make up for the exclusion of text, creating a visual editorial that is actually more visceral than dialogue and clearly establishes the farmers interdependence and love of the land, that substance that gives them their identity and manhood.
I:18062;664;In an emotionally stunning and perpetually twisting depression.
I:18062;665;I viewed the film in an edited form in my Modern American History class, starting at Scene 4 and watching up to a scene in which we witness the death of Grandma Joad (played dramatically by Zeffie Tilbury).
I:18062;666;winning actress Jane Darwell and John Carradine as Casy stand out as the more memorable of this immediate cast of tireless crusaders in a time of drought and migration.
I:18062;667;Also we see various themes portrayed in the film.
I:18062;668;Steinbeck makes the characters and sociological events of the dust bowl come alive.
I:18062;669;John Steinbeck did a masterful job in writing about a family's experience.
I:18062;670;The John Ford film adaptation is brilliant and Henry Fonda should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor.
I:18062;671;the film is a brilliant American film classic that should be on everybody's list of greatest film movies about the American experience.
I:18062;672;The story is filled with twists and turns as well as brilliant acting and writing.
I:18062;673;It's brilliant and I wished that I had seen it sooner.
I:18062;674;It was like a continuation of the documentary.
I:18062;675;it was a true measure of the determination and strength of people of that time.
I:18062;676;The hardship the people endured is beyond measure.
I:18062;677;One has to admire that kind of courage.
I:18062;678;It shows what Americans are made of.
I:18062;679;This is one of the few movies where the movie is just about as good as the book.
I:18062;680;This was Henry Fonda's first starring role, and he does an incredbile job as Tom Joad.
I:18062;681;"and still counts among the 35 books most frequently banned from American school curricula: A raw, brutally direct, yet incredibly poetic masterpiece of fiction, it continues to touch nerves deeply rooted in modern society's fabric
I:18062;682;Chicano labor leader Cesar Chavez especially pointed out how well he could empathize with the Joad family, because he and his fellow workers were now living the same life they once had.
I:18062;683;having fought hard with his publisher to maintain the novel's uncompromising approach throughout, Steinbeck was weary to give the film rights to 20th Century Fox, headed by powerful mogul and, more importantly, known conservative Daryl F. Zanuck.
I:18062;684;Yet, Zanuck and director John Ford largely stayed true to the novel: There is that sense of desperation in farmer Muley's (John Qualen's) expression as he tells Tom and ex.
I:18062;685;There is everybody's brief joy upon first seeing Bakersfield's rich plantations .
I:18062;686;wherever there is injustice, struggle, and people's joint success.
I:18062;687;"In an overall outstanding cast, which also includes Dorris Bowdon (Rose of Sharon), Eddie Quillan (Rose's boyfriend Connie), Frank Darien (Uncle John) and a brief appearance by Ward Bond as a friendly policeman, Henry Fonda truly shines as Tom
I:18062;688;Jane Darwell won a much.
I:18062;689;"award for her portrayal as Ma
I:18062;690;Still, despite its critical success .
I:18062;691;"also expressed in a ""Best Picture"" National Board of Review award ."
I:18062;692;"After the witch hunt setting in not even a decade later, today it stands as one of the last, greatest examples of a movie pulling no punches in the portrayal of society's ailments
I:18062;693;Ev'rybody might be just one big soul .
I:18062;694;The highway is alive tonight, but nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes.
I:18062;695;but on second viewing, I was impressed by how closely the film followed the book.
I:18062;696;"(Of recent note in this respect are Peter Jackson's fine films of J. R. R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy ."
I:18062;697;readers to substitute viewing this film in place of reading the entire book.
I:18062;698;Made in 1940, this is a timeless classic.
I:18062;699;"If you like good movies, this one is a ""gotta see!"
I:18062;700;This film is probably director John Ford's crowning glory (he won the Best Director Oscar), but the key piece to this wonderful mosaic of characters in this American tragedy, is Henry Fonda (Oscar winner for Best Actor).
I:18062;701;"the two roles I most remember Fonda for is his portrayal of the holdout juror in ""Twelve Angry Men"" and in the role of Tom Joad, in this poignant tale of hope among ruins."
I:18062;702;Fonda's performance is one of the strongest I've ever seen, and I think it was easy for him to being Joad to life because of his own Midwestern roots.
I:18062;703;eyed hope of Ma Joad (Jane Darwin, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) to the merriment of the children who travel across country in the family's jalopy and who despite their poverty, find joy in just being.
I:18062;704;oscar worthy execution not only from Fonda, Darwin and Ford.
I:18062;705;though the story takes place nearly a century ago, this tale of real Americans stands the test of time and will be enjoyed by generations to come.
I:18062;706;The Grapes of wrath movie was excellent, and was a great rendition of the book.
I:18062;707;over all, I enjoyed the book better, and hope people will read the book before they watch this movie.
I:18062;708;John Ford actually improved on the extremely overrated Steinbeck novel, The Grapes of Wrath.
I:18062;709;Greg Toland, once again, deserves much of the credit for the visual impact of the film.
I:18062;710;The family joins thousands of other families from around the country on the long journey to California.
I:18062;711;Everyone is headed to California because of the promise of work.
I:18062;712;The Joads begin their long journey in a single truck that holds all of their possessions, 12 family members and their friend Casey, a former preacher.
I:18062;713;The theme of the movie is suffrage.
