I:27389;1;I saw it today, and while I seriously doubt this movie will win any awards, it's a solid production (and will likely be very profitable).
I:27389;2;Mr. Mathers isn't asked to display huge range, but he does well with what's asked of him.
I:27389;3;The rest of the cast is very solid.
I:27389;4;"the best part of the movie, without question, are the ""battle"" sequences, wherein rappers compete for crowd approval by coming up with freestyle insults of their opponent."
I:27389;5;A respectable acting debut by Eminem.
I:27389;6;I'm a huge Eminem fan, and I think his acting was very good.
I:27389;7;Some things I liked were the way it starts off, and explains the setting very well.
I:27389;8;this is his basicly true story.
I:27389;9;his moms a real c!
I:27389;10;its a type of musical i guess and a documentary.
I:27389;11;its kims best movie by far considering her batman movie is a very distant 2nd.
I:27389;12;the rest pretty much suck.
I:27389;13;its very emotional watching fights go on in front of small children.
I:27389;14;eminem played his part well.
I:27389;15;kims movies generaly suck,this is her best.
I:27389;16;He shares the screen with a few other big names like Kim Basinger, and Brittany Murphy.
I:27389;17;That was the best part of the movie.
I:27389;18;It's amazing to see people free style rap like they do in the movie.
I:27389;19;I was actually surprised to see Eminem act as well as he did.
I:27389;20;There is a pretty long and graphic scene of Eminem and Brittany Murphy at the factory where he works.
I:27389;21;Other then that the movie kept my interest, made me laugh, made me sad, and over all kept me entertained the whole time.
I:27389;22;it was actually kind of inspiring to see someone succeed in such rough conditions.
I:27389;23;Best movie I gave seen in a while.
I:27389;24;Love the rap battles and the story behind rabbit just great movie greatly made
I:27389;25;Great movie, would watch again.
I:27389;26;I do think it holds up really well.
I:27389;27;The soundtrack is great as ever, too.
I:27389;28;Today, I know what I have missed in this very enjoyable film about classic resilience with a great score.
I:27389;29;One of my favorite movies!
I:27389;30;It's definitely a must see movie!
I:27389;31;Eminem is one of my favorite rappers and when I heard that he had a movie coming out about his life, I just had to see it.
I:27389;32;It's about his struggles and triumphs, a story based on Marshall's actual life.
I:27389;33;The part that felt most real to me came early.
I:27389;34;That's one thing I got from the movie.
I:27389;35;Sweet Home Alabama, as sent up by Eminem and Future, has to be one of the funniest and most clever things I've ever seen in a movie.
I:27389;36;The inevitable battle at the end was a thing of beauty to rap fans everywhere, even this old redneck in China.
I:27389;37;Its basically Rocky with rapping, but it IS well done.
I:27389;38;The acting is surpisingly good and you will feel pumped up for the battle rap showdown at the end.
I:27389;39;Even if you dont like eminem this is still a good show.
I:27389;40;The improptu rap showdown between eminem and some of the extras is quite good even though he handles everyone super easily.
I:27389;41;The extra video (superman) is also sort of funny.
I:27389;42;But keep the kiddies away.
I:27389;43;If you're expecting a bad movie and discover a few unexpected good things in it (such as acting, for instance), you'll enjoy it far more than expected.'
I:27389;44;but these cliches are often based on real life truths.
I:27389;45;eminem is a surprisingly good actor, and the rap parts are enjoyable even for people who are not devoted fans of the genre.
I:27389;46;Co. starring Kim Basinger as Rabbit's alcoholic mother and Brittany Murphy as a naughty girl that he meets also give standout performances.
I:27389;47;In 8 Mile, the controversial rapper proves that he is multi.
I:27389;48;talented, a genius of music and the screen.
I:27389;49;Eminem really stole the show on this one.
I:27389;50;thanks America for this great import(Eminem)!
I:27389;51;in 8 Mile , not only he displays his hip.
I:27389;52;hop talents, but he also makes clear that he is a complete artist with great acting skills, even if he basically is playing himself, because it's hard to step in front of a camera and give a good performance, specially when most of the people wass waiting your for him to fail.
I:27389;53;8 Mile is a semi.
I:27389;54;hop aficionados that have a dream: someday they will be the next big thing in the hip.
I:27389;55;the director Curtis Hanson was able to get good performances from everybody in the cast, the pace of the story is very good also, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is stellar, and the music is just great.
I:27389;56;this is the kind of movie that is enjoyable, not only for Eminem or hip.
I:27389;57;hop fans, but it can be enjoyed by everyone.
I:27389;58;Here is another inspirational movie I look to when I am down or looking to be inspired.
I:27389;59;This story is solid and starts at a hard time in his life where he does not know what to do.
I:27389;60;Every time he gets up in front of the crowd he gets nervous and can't rap but finally near the end he is able to take on the challenge.
I:27389;61;While Eminem didn't have a totally never come back upbringing it was hard enough and it is an inspiration to everyone.
I:27389;62;The music for this film is subpurve.
I:27389;63;Rapper Eminem's venture into movies.
I:27389;64;I will admit, I liked this movie more than I thought I would.
I:27389;65;All they do is talk about rapping.
I:27389;66;All the characters do is talk about rapping.
I:27389;67;He just got fired from his job at white castle.
I:27389;68;Broke up with his girlfriend.
I:27389;69;now maybe this all sounds enjoyable to you.
I:27389;70;And there is one character who does try to change the subject now and then and everyone tells him to keep quiet.
I:27389;71;But because they set out to do more with the story they wanted a talented director.
I:27389;72;And who knows maybe Hanson did make many changes in the script.
I:27389;73;Nevertheless, they are things to be enjoyed while watching this movie.
I:27389;74;She lives in a trailer.
I:27389;75;She does a nice job acting.
I:27389;76;And like I said, the movie does a good job at creating an urban atmosphere.
I:27389;77;It's because I have good things to say about the movie I wish the movie would of meet the expectations that could of been.
I:27389;78;another question on people's mind is can Eminem act.
I:27389;79;Most people are good at being themself.
I:27389;80;"so is ""8 Mile"" enjoyable?"
I:27389;81;Fans of Eminem will probably enjoy the movie more then the rest of us.
I:27389;82;Their fans of his, they'll go easy on him.
I:27389;83;a great performance from Eminem (playing himself more or less.
I:27389;84;i guess he was right for the part!)
I:27389;85;This movie was one of the best i've seen this past year.
I:27389;86;I thought this movie was very inspirational and the music made a perfect soundtrack.
I:27389;87;I would recommend this movie to everyone.
I:27389;88;Also for showing that even a white man starting out with a dead end job could become great and respected.
I:27389;89;It was a really good movie but it never showed when he became famous.
I:27389;90;Despite the teenage angst, a bit of sex and lots of cussing this is a great coming of age film about a boy reaching beyond his surroundings and life and making something good for himself.
I:27389;91;Eminem is a brilliant song writer and in this movie he proves he can act too.
I:27389;92;My son and his friend could sing along with much of this movie, so I think it's worth paying attention to what he has to say.
I:27389;93;the movie, if taken out of the context of who Eminem is and what he does, would still be a really good film, the fact that it's semi autobiographical really makes it interesting and entertaining at the same time.
I:27389;94;i highly recommend this film to any that aren't prudish and think it's worth owning.
I:27389;95;This scene was the best part of the film and the one that will probably hold the movie together.
I:27389;96;The acting was also good.
I:27389;97;I have my doubts that this film will appeal to anyone who is not a fan of Eminem's music.
I:27389;98;I love this move, its a great movie, funny and it has drama on it.
I:27389;99;Great for anyone that whats to be something in life and wont give up till they get it.
I:27389;100;Eminem is suprisingly a great actor, and who better to play the part of himself.
I:27389;101;Actually the film is based only loosely on his life, but none the less he delivers a strong preformance and a great movie.
I:27389;102;I like his music and I happen to think he's a decent guy.
I:27389;103;8 Mile was a great movie.
I:27389;104;The plot was interesting, the dialogue was true to life, and Eminem's acting skills were surprisingly strong.
I:27389;105;"Kim Basinger and the little girl who played ""Lilly"" were great."
I:27389;106;8 Mile hasn't changed that opinion.
I:27389;107;It's definitely worth seeing and, if you're a big Em fan, definitely worth owning.
I:27389;108;i thought this movie was really good i really liked the part where they battle it showed eminem's skillz and it was funny.
I:27389;109;He is far more than just a `sidekick', he's a life force propelling his friend to greatness.7) The rap.
I:27389;110;Yeah, this is a rap movie so.
I:27389;111;offs will have you smiling from ear.
I:27389;112;Curtis Hanson is a phenomenal director, and that statement is made based on his flawless transference of `L. a. Confidential' to the big screen back in 1997.
I:27389;113;He brings an even grittier feel to this film, allowing the very essence of this man's life to burry itself in every frame.
I:27389;114;This film feels SO LIVED IN, genuinely evoking from start to finish, and while other factors obviously are in play here, it is Hanson's direction that establishes the film's core.
I:27389;115;He understands the tale he is telling, and he pulls so much out of this cast (I mean, he gets an Award worthy performance out of Eminem, but I'll get to that in a minute).5) The sharp script.
I:27389;116;It really `goes there', creating real people with real issues and real situations that bleed so much honesty and truth.
I:27389;117;Some have gripped about the relationship between Alex and Rabbit, but I find it truthful and earnest.
I:27389;118;Even her betrayal reads with such gritty authenticity you can completely connect to it.
I:27389;119;The dialog is realistic (yes, all those 4.
I:27389;120;Yes, this is one of her finest roles.
I:27389;121;Her slick sensuality coupled with the understanding of her character (glorified groupie intent of getting a piece herself) helps create a character we love to hate, and cannot forget.3) It's semi.
I:27389;122;I think my friend said it best, when this film was released.
I:27389;123;stardom) it really helps you appreciate who Eminem really is.
I:27389;124;life (his relationship with his alcoholic mother takes a more tenderly frustrated turn in the film, as apposed to the volatile way he explains it now) as well as his talent, `8 Mile' gives the audience a glimpse into the trials and triumphs of one of hip.
I:27389;125;He's so natural here, completely bringing you along as he travels the road to personal betterment.
I:27389;126;This is just a great performance, period.1) Because I know what I'm talking about!
I:27389;127;, Eminem is a great rapper and a great actor, the movie is very interesting and its just a perfect story
I:27389;128;8 MILE, Was somewhat of a good movie.
I:27389;129;I think he is as good an actor as he is a rapper.
I:27389;130;This movie is really great.
I:27389;131;talented and this movie shows that.
I:27389;132;It is definetly worth the $$.
I:27389;133;I was very impressed with Eminem's acting.
I:27389;134;Eminem is very natural in front of tbe camera and is a natural actor.
I:27389;135;This movie is fantastic, i could sit here and tell you all my favorite parts.
I:27389;136;"Anyone who liked the movie ""Juice"" should probably check ""8 Mile"" out."
I:27389;137;And when you see the trailer, well.
I:27389;138;Watch it with a somewhat open mind.
I:27389;139;up film, and you'll probably enjoy it.
I:27389;140;It's very well made, and the ending is satisfying.
I:27389;141;there are some extremely funny bits.
I:27389;142;The film succeeded on both counts.
I:27389;143;First, I learned to respect the musical genre more than I had before, coming to appreciate the essential character of the lyrics and picking up a basic vocabulary.
I:27389;144;As for acting, I thought Marshall Mathers did a fine job.
I:27389;145;While on paper the plot is a familiar one, about a young person wanting to move beyond their surroundings and better themselves using their own talents, the film still worked because Mathers aka Eminem aka Slim Shady has a charismatic screen presence.
I:27389;146;Like Sean Penn or Frank Sinatra, he is a thinking presence and fun to watch on the screen.
I:27389;147;The entire supporting cast is excellent, with Kim Basinger as B. rabbit's troubled mother, Brittany Murphy as fellow traveller Alex and Mekhi Phifer as the friend we all wish we had.
I:27389;148;The B actors are solid and the club extras play a big role, bringing a real heartbeat to the rap battles at The Shelter.
I:27389;149;It's an excellent soundtrack .
I:27389;150;It's strong, it's hopeful, and besides, it rocks.
I:27389;151;One also appreciates that he is hard working and a decent guy.
I:27389;152;age stories, films about urban America, good acting or films in which music plays a large role, this is a film you could definitely enjoy.
I:27389;153;It has special features which includes the music video to 'Superman' and it came a day before it was suppose to!
I:27389;154;I think my impression at first of the overall acting to be weak, but now, I feel everybody did equally good.
I:27389;155;Probably the best parts of the film will have to be the rap battles.
I:27389;156;They are in fact well written and creatively thought out.
I:27389;157;Probably the best performance of the film will go to Mekhi Phifer who was pretty good as Future.
I:27389;158;All in all, 8 Mile, whether you dislike, hate, or ignore Eminem, is worth watching and makes for a good film.
I:27389;159;This may be one of the few inspirational movies that could actually inspire someone!
I:27389;160;I love this movie and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Eminem's music and performances or anyone who just loves a good inspiration!!
I:27389;161;Also, the Superman video in the special features section is great!
I:27389;162;This is a man's Cinderella story .
I:27389;163;the main problem with the hype surrounding this movie is that it misleads you into thinking that what you are seeing is something original, something that has not been done a thousand times before.
I:27389;164;It promises us that the film will be frighteningly realistic and distrubing, with performances so honest, because much of it is Eminem's so. called life story.
I:27389;165;I have to say one other thing at the mtv movie awards I was appalled at how they were making fun of him!
I:27389;166;There are a lot of kids living in his situation and I believe he is a great roll model for them.
I:27389;167;That he made and did something with his life!
I:27389;168;The intangibles are quite strong.
I:27389;169;The guys in his crew and the shots of Detroit are very interesting.
I:27389;170;As far as acting goes, Kim Bassinger is a stand.
I:27389;171;In terms of the plot itself, most of it will be familiar to those who know anything about the performers' life.
I:27389;172;"There's nothing ambiguous about Rabbit
I:27389;173;If he were able to detach himself more from Rabbit, I'm sure Mr. Mathers could have put together a more compelling script.
I:27389;174;In most movies that star rappers the rappers usually over play their role and try to be super hard, in this movie Eminem played it pretty cool and turned out a great performance.
I:27389;175;the real triumph of 8 Mile has to be the Oscar.
I:27389;176;"winning song ""Lose Yourself,"" Curtis Hanson's unique gift of perfectly recreating inner."
I:27389;177;I am not a fan of Eminem's music at all, but the relentless and driving beats and lyrics of Lose Yourself make it quite possibly one of the best songs released in the past decade and a deserved Oscar winner.
I:27389;178;"Moreover, the way that Hanson brings the viewer into Detroit circa.1994 and the aspects of life at that time (especially the ""battles"") is brilliant and is one of the numerous aspects of the film that helped me overlook the tortured cliches."
I:27389;179;It really helps the viewer connect with the characters in my opinion.
I:27389;180;8 Mile was one of the best movies i have ever seen.
I:27389;181;The movie was packed with great action and outstanding rap scenes.
I:27389;182;I hope Eminem makes another one!
I:27389;183;That kind of made enjoying the movie difficult, but the end scene was still amazing.
I:27389;184;Aside from a few silly things, this movie was great.
I:27389;185;"But all in all, this movie was great, and Eminem was fantastic, although my assumption is that he's gonna think to himself ""wow this movie was so successful, maybe I should make another one"" and if this is the case, it's gonna be garbage."
I:27389;186;"This movie is an ACCURATE portrayal of what it was like to be a white male growing up on the wrong side of ""8 Mile""."
I:27389;187;Would you prefer to see a movie that tip.
I:27389;188;eminem does a phenominal job acting in this movie, and there is nothing bad that you can say against him.
I:27389;189;i think one part of this movie that stood out to me was the fact that I can relate many of my friends to Eminem's friends in the movie.
I:27389;190;Everyone has the bossy friend, who constantly pushes you to do more, either because that's their nature, or, like Future and Rabbit, they see something in you that they think you could use to your advantage.
I:27389;191;Everybody has a friend like the charater Sol Georger, played by Omar Benson Miller, who is a huge, smart, goofy, I'd like to say kid, but adult.
I:27389;192;"Then there's the hilarious Chedder Bob, who looks up to Rabbit in almost everyway, and one of the most touching scenes in the movie is when Cheddar Bob had recently asked Rabbit what a good emcee name for him would be, and when Rabbit came to visit him after he shot himself, he called out ""Emcee Bob"", over his shoulder as he was leaving."
I:27389;193;in the end, 8 Mile is a fantastic movie that sheds light on to a world that should NOT be sugar coated with love and happiness that is not there.
I:27389;194;I strongly recomend this film to anyone mature enough to view it.
I:27389;195;Undoubtedly, the surprise film of 2002 was 8 Mile, the story about a young white rapper in Detroit who struggles with his broken family, gold.
I:27389;196;As a movie, it performs its duties well .
I:27389;197;written screenplay wrought with symbolism, 8 Mile vividly portrays the life of an angry urban youth who aches to express his hatred for the world around him.
I:27389;198;As the dividing line between the city Detroit and the outside world, 8 Mile represents was is and what can be.
I:27389;199;The film's ability to draw the audience into a world of which they may not be a part makes this a definite must.
I:27389;200;For those conservative or older viewers who may be reluctant to the see the film because of its leading star Eminem, I highly recommend giving 8 Mile a chance.
I:27389;201;If you enjoy drama and peering into unique worlds, then you might be pleasantly surprised with this one.
I:27389;202;There are many aspects to 8 Mile that I loved!
I:27389;203;It is a cruel world at times and 8 Mile captures that quite well!
I:27389;204;Brittany Murphy is quite sexy in this role and the best part, unlike Jessica Simpson, she can actually act and she makes her performance more believeable than it could be!
I:27389;205;But for me, that's what it makes interesting!
I:27389;206;Eminem is one fine actor and I question why he didn't do more movies because this is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a while!
I:27389;207;I find this to be great.
I:27389;208;This movie delivers a fine thing line between the real and the fake.
I:27389;209;Something that I find pleasing.
I:27389;210;She was a love interest which I suppose is best to have in a movie.
I:27389;211;Kim Basinger, who played his mum, did a great job.
I:27389;212;this is a great coming of age movie, that really in the end, has a point to get across.
I:27389;213;I cannot imagine that Eminem will walk away with an Oscar but, it would not be surprising to see this as one of the best movies of the year!
I:27389;214;I saw this movie at the theater, and I'd say that it was the most astonishing movie I'd ever seen!
I:27389;215;Eminem does a great job of acting among Kim Basinger and Mekhi Phifer, and you can actually believe it's him, basically because it is him in his life.
I:27389;216;The music is great, the battles are fun to watch, Eminem is great, and overall, 8 Mile is a great movie to see!
I:27389;217;8 Mile is a very good movie with tons of drama and a great plot.
I:27389;218;Eminem played his character perfectly, as he lived through a similar experience.
I:27389;219;it might be an old movie but it is a great movie and my favorite rapper eminem plays in it and the rap battles are awesome eminem kicked but in this movie 5 stars
I:27389;220;Eminem is nothing less than wonderful in his first starring role and brings surprising energy and intelligence to his role as would.
I:27389;221;Everything about the film feels right, feels authentic.
I:27389;222;including the rivalries and the affection shared by Rabbit and his friends.
I:27389;223;While the story of a young man with a dream isn't anything new, the script, the performances and Eminem elevate it beyond the ordinary.
I:27389;224;And big points have to go to the non.
I:27389;225;Reality is winning the day and then catching a bus to go back to work.
I:27389;226;I love him I always will, hes a great rapper and a great actor I just looooooooooooooooooooooove him so much, it was so hard watching him get beat up like that though.
I:27389;227;I find Eminem an interesting person.
I:27389;228;How it is he refutes that this film is biographical in any way is as mysterious as is this kid's genius.
I:27389;229;"Plus the bonus features such as the ""Superman"" video is pretty good."
I:27389;230;style raps are definitely a very good bonus.
I:27389;231;Have always enjoyed Eminem's music, even though he uses a lot of profanity.
I:27389;232;Was interesting to see his life story leading up to his fame.
I:27389;233;A very strong performance and an excellnt script.
I:27389;234;The rapping battles were excellent!
I:27389;235;The stuff they come out with(especially eminem) is hilarious, and also extremly clever!i don't really want to say anything more about the movie except that you must see it.
I:27389;236;In spite of the buzz that comes along with his presense outside of the film, Eminem manages to give a gritty, gut.
I:27389;237;level performance that transcends the hype of his musical persona(s).
I:27389;238;Yes, there are significant parallels to his life and it had to help him to draw on the appropriate emotions, but he delivers what's needed in every scene.
I:27389;239;Despite strong supporting performances, the success of this film rests on his shoulders and in my opinion, he comes through.
I:27389;240;I now have a whole new respect for this gentleman.
I:27389;241;I still am on the fence about rap music in general, but now I will listen to it first before I open my mouth.
I:27389;242;"Now keep in mind, ""R"" means that if you're under 17, you shouldn't see this movie since you're not mature enough for it."
I:27389;243;"For the rest of you, ask yourself, ""If a 16."
I:27389;244;He's not the same person in both!In this movie, he does a great job of telling that story too.
I:27389;245;From being a shy laid back guy who's trying to keep his family going while trying to be a success, to discovering his talent, Eminem left me feeling that I want to be the best rating label I can be!
I:27389;246;I can't promise that you'll like every scene in this movie, but as long as you take a look at what's in the movie based on what I tell you, I think you'll make the wise decision.
I:27389;247;All other characters appear relatively vibrant, bordering on flamboyant.
I:27389;248;Thank you for making my on.
I:27389;249;Most definitely will do again.
I:27389;250;It's just a story about a guy having a dream to have a record deal.
I:27389;251;This movie is great it is my husbands favorite he had a obsession with eminem thanks for a great deal and shipping was awesome tha ks again
I:27389;252;I'm a pretty big Brittney Murphy fan and I like Eminem well enough so I was optimistic going into this movie.
I:27389;253;"The most striking idea I got from the movie is how true talent and genius can be found even among what appears to be the ""rock bottom""."
I:27389;254;"mile"" makes for an excellent breakthrough for the popular rap star."
I:27389;255;He has two ways of doing this: One, through battle.
I:27389;256;"His black militant friend takes the cake as far as ""filler"" characters go."
I:27389;257;this is actually a real good movie at times but again, the script could certainly have stood to go through a few more re.
I:27389;258;The plot of the movie is very surprizing, it makes you so excited and thinking on what Eminem is going to do next.
I:27389;259;He works as a mechanic, lifting parts of cars.
I:27389;260;He raps around his friends and on the streets and makes a big show at a lunch break by battling this other rapper that was dissing a lady who was rapping called Vennesa.
I:27389;261;Later at Rabbit's trailer Wink shows up with his friends known as The Free World and they seriously beat him up.
I:27389;262;He sees Future there and Rabbit apologizes to him and they become friends again.
I:27389;263;This movie is very inspiring.
I:27389;264;see movie for all rap fans.
I:27389;265;seen Superman Video, and production notes, and the making of 8 Mile.
I:27389;266;Being from Detroit, but now living in Texas, you can't help but want to see the movie 8 Mile.
I:27389;267;So, on the one hand, that makes you empathize with Jimmy, and it also makes you appreciate the life that you have if it's much better than Jimmy's situation in Detroit.
I:27389;268;the rapping, music, and some of the comic relief provided by the Cheddar character was the best part in my opinion.
I:27389;269;I loved Jimmy's perseverance in spite of his surroundings.
I:27389;270;Eminem did a commendable job.
I:27389;271;He does have screen presence, and the intense passion people have for hip.
I:27389;272;hop is evident and admired throughout the film.
I:27389;273;I love Emimem, This movie is a must watch, it has heart and soul in it and I would recommend it for a good movie night.
I:27389;274;This is probably one of the best films to come out in 2002, and yet it was snubbed by the acadamy despite all the critics praise.
I:27389;275;Eminem pulls out all the stops here with a strong performance as a somewhat alter version of himself, a white boy growing up in Detroit with dreams to be a rapper.
I:27389;276;Yes, this may or may not be how Eminem got his breaks in life but regardless, this film, watched as a fictional story and not an autobiography will do well to make the difference.
I:27389;277;Rabbit wants more for himself and for his family, and he's determined to work hard to get it.
I:27389;278;Throw in a new love interest (Britany Murphy in a peformance to make you go GA'GA) and some rival thugs and you have a simple plot turned great movie with subplots that hold your interest and keep you in anticipation of the next scene.
I:27389;279;Great film all the way around.
I:27389;280;but it has some funny music and some cool scenes like when they burn down the house.
I:27389;281;"This film could be tedious for some people, but if you like to listen or do""RAP"", I will strongly recommend you to watch this film."
I:27389;282;8 Mile, a new film from Curtis Hanson and starring Eminem was actually quite good.
I:27389;283;"He has some good pals, including David Porter aka ""Future"" played nicely by Mekhi Pfiefer."
I:27389;284;Gorgeous Brittany Murphy plays Alex, Emimen's love interest.
I:27389;285;The film is nicely directed by Curtis Hanson also featuring a good screenplay from Scott Silver.
I:27389;286;"Hanson who made other great films including ""Wonder Boys"" and the excellent ""L. a. Confidential,"" makes another wonderful film here."
I:27389;287;the true, exciting parts of this film are without question the rap battles, which are masterfully done.
I:27389;288;I also thought that film might receive other nods, but oh well.
I:27389;289;All in all, 8 Mile features a good cast.
I:27389;290;It's fairly strong, and is also included in rap lyrics besides dialogue.
I:27389;291;It is a really good movie and deals with real life situations.
I:27389;292;Eminem does a really good job acting and the music is original.
I:27389;293;this is a great movie, i did not think eminem was such a good actor.
I:27389;294;he was perfect for this movie.
I:27389;295;this movie had a lotta of good actors in it and the story was great.
I:27389;296;this is a good movie if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do
I:27389;297;Great movie,trails and hardship over came.
I:27389;298;it is a must see movie for all ages.
I:27389;299;But he acquits himself nicely, lending credibility to a drama that examines not only hip.
I:27389;300;hop music but impoverished urban America as well.
I:27389;301;Still, that's easier said than done, especially when he faces competition from a rival hip.
I:27389;302;the results are highly watchable.
I:27389;303;that's at least due in part to Mathers, who's quite believable.
I:27389;304;Of course, he's also got a talented supporting cast to bolster him in weaker moments.
I:27389;305;Murphy continues her string of solid performances, while both Mekhi Pfifer and Basinger are better here than either has been in quite some time.
I:27389;306;8 Mile is rated R for frequent use of strong sex.
I:27389;307;His acting, along with Mekhi Phifer's acting, impressed me very much.
I:27389;308;8 Mile is definitely worth watching.
I:27389;309;Eminem is the best actor and rapper I have ever seen.
I:27389;310;He was thrilled when he received it and has watched it several times since receiving it.
I:27389;311;It was shipped on time and he received it within the guidelines I was given.
I:27389;312;Thanks for helping me make my friend's day.
I:27389;313;Even though 8 Mile can't touch Purple Rain or Krush Groove when it comes to music it was one of my favorite movies from last year.
I:27389;314;Like I said 8 Mile was clearly without a doubt one of the best movies of the previous year when it came to crowd pleasing.
I:27389;315;Director Curtis Hanson and screenwriter Scott Silver have tailor made a great first movie for Eminem.
I:27389;316;The supporting cast all give excellent performances Mehki Phifer who serves as Jimmy's main supporter contiunes to make star making movies.
I:27389;317;With the little screen time they are given Kim Basinger and Brittany Murphy do good as the female leads.
I:27389;318;The highlight of the film is truly the battle scenes though.
I:27389;319;I give the movie ***** stars.
I:27389;320;This is Undoubtably the greatest movie on my movie list.
I:27389;321;This is my favorite movie of all time.
I:27389;322;My brother brought this movie for me and we saw it in the theater a couple of times.
I:27389;323;He dreams of making it big, along with his group, 313, including Future (Mekhi Pfipher) and his buddies, including the hilarious, [silly] Cheddar Bob, and the politically active Iz.
I:27389;324;All I need is a plane ticket.
I:27389;325;eminem is an impressive actor, though he isn't exactly stretching to meet his role.
I:27389;326;8 Mile is rated R, based mainly on the language, of which the affect wears off after the first 15 minutes, but also for some graphic sexuality, including Jimmy walking in on his mom, and making love with his girlfriend in the factory.
I:27389;327;this was an impressive movie and I was glad to have seen it, I would reccommend it to anyone over the age of 15.
I:27389;328;The funny parts in the movie are mainly the rap battles where other rappers go against each other and humiliate each other.
I:27389;329;Now onto the sweet part of the movie, yes this movie is actually sweet.
I:27389;330;Apart from the racism and bullying, this movie is very sweet.
I:27389;331;I thought the relationships of eminem and his friends in the movie was very sweet, because they always stuck up for each other, laughed with each other and apart from those arguments they have had, they where overall best friends and where always there for each other.
I:27389;332;A disapppointing film about the underground culture of rap battles, modern versions of doin' the dozens that many aspiring MCs dream will make them stars.
I:27389;333;charismatic rapper Eminem that he was cast in the role of Ron Howard in this inner.
I:27389;334;striken 'hoods of Detroit is shown with crisp, gritty detail, the social nuances of the hip.
I:27389;335;"While ""8 Mile"" probably succeeds in making underground hip."
I:27389;336;likeable Fat Albert gang that Rabbit hangs out with, and the gratuitously [promiscous] scenes with his new girlfriend, played by Brittany Murphy, as well as the unfortunate absence of a wall.
I:27389;337;Toastmasters has nada on this form of extemporaneous speaking skills forum and what a display of talent, those lyrics played off like a second city free for all, found the drama comedic, exciting, witty and truly entertaining.
I:27389;338;so hard to believe that the weapons used in this horrid detroit suburb are showdown putdowns, was used to this growing up in a low class neighborhood but singing on stage and rhyming, that's pure talent!
I:27389;339;Eminem was trif and wow would I not fit in with this crowd, prefer Rachmaninov but enjoyed this delighful diversion!
I:27389;340;Brittany Murphy is Ali Mills (the love interest).
I:27389;341;this movie isn't horrible .
I:27389;342;He's got talent, but can he show this talent to the other kids (rappers)?
I:27389;343;So in the sequel to 8 Mile, Eminem will get the you.
I:27389;344;girlfriend, and the one played by Brittany Murphy, and finally a world of upcoming rappers who aren't too happy to see a white boy rap.
I:27389;345;That's right in 2002 the world of rap was still very black, and they surrounded the curtain leading to the holy of holies where no white man ever trod.
I:27389;346;I found them to be very endearing, and what saved the movie from absolute ruin.
I:27389;347;"Otherwise all the fame, and adulation this movie got was another time for Hollywood to utter those magical words
I:27389;348;The group labeled as right.
I:27389;349;i viewed this film while on vacation, and the splurges in free time that accompany such endeavors instigate that new things be tried: that one entertain oneself with the unusual.
I:27389;350;The persons with me on the vacation were curious as to the content of the movie, and so with popcorn, beer, and an open mind, we sat down on a not.
I:27389;351;comfortable couch and concentrated our attention to what some have called proof of the decline of U. s. culture.
I:27389;352;what we viewed was interesting, and not what we expected.
I:27389;353;But art has the habit of bringing you out of equilibrium, and this piece of art, this movie, was a pretty strong perturbation.
I:27389;354;What was observed was a character with a strong work ethic: working by day, rapping by night.
I:27389;355;A character with deep concern with his baby sister's care and well.
I:27389;356;Was he a perfect character?
I:27389;357;this character clearly believed in the value of a focused life: his extreme note.
I:27389;358;taking for his eventual musical rap confrontations.
I:27389;359;the harsh language in the rap confrontations is balanced by its inventiveness, its creativity.
I:27389;360;It is actually very fun.
I:27389;361;focused biopics go, 8 Mile is one of the better.
I:27389;362;serving at times, this is also an impressively open and honest take on Eminem's roots and the self.
I:27389;363;I found the battle raps to be as intense and exciting as a good action scene, and the choice to limit them to a few key moments was a smart move that doubled their importance.
I:27389;364;smart inspiration that offers a fresh take on a tired old tale.
I:27389;365;hop singer at that time, in that place, it was very much a big deal on which side of 8 Mile you were born and lived.
I:27389;366;"hop artists compete in ""battles"" in which each person gets 45 seconds to ad lib to music
I:27389;367;"Winners are decided by crowd reaction
I:27389;368;But for all of that, in 8 Mile Jimmy's greatest battle is with himself, to find the determination and self.
I:27389;369;esteem to compete and win in the battles.
I:27389;370;it's irresistible to compare 8 Mile to Rocky.
I:27389;371;In both movies there's an event in which the main character's performance has become for him the defining moment in his life, the challenge he must overcome to have any sort of decent existence thereafter.
I:27389;372;In Rocky it's the exhibition fight with Apollo Creed.
I:27389;373;But Rocky has such a self.
I:27389;374;Rocky knows he's going to get beaten mostly to death, but if he's still on his feet at the end of the fight he'll feel like a winner.
I:27389;375;eminem aka Marshall Mathers does a phenomenal job as B. Rabbit.
I:27389;376;He convincingly displays a wide range of emotions: despair, fear, anger, love, hate, courage, sensitivity, it's all right there on his face, scraped raw, mostly in the eyes.
I:27389;377;Throughout the entire movie I was just amazed at how good this guy was.
I:27389;378;There's a small amount of truth to that.
I:27389;379;If you had one shot, one opportunity, to seize everything you ever wanted, for one moment, would you capture it, or just let it slip?
I:27389;380;Eminem also shows another side of himself.
I:27389;381;He lives in a trailor home with his mother and sister.
I:27389;382;I really recommend this movie if you want to have fun.
I:27389;383;This movie is no better.
I:27389;384;"8 Mile (2002)While there isn't much plot to this movie (it's just a lot of stuff that happens to B. rabbit [Eminem]), this movie is entertaining for the freestyles (""I Live At Home in a Trailer"" is hilarious), the battle raps (especially the second to last one, against Lotto: ""Tank top screaming/'Lotto, I don't fit you!!'"")"
I:27389;385;as for Eminem's acting, he is surprisingly good.
I:27389;386;This is a great movie.
I:27389;387;I really liked this movie.
I:27389;388;Eminem is a natural actor.
I:27389;389;Rabbit is a talented and determined young man in an impoverished community, a minority in a minority world, with friends who believe in him and a mother who depends on bingo to make ends meet.
I:27389;390;This is his first movie, and he is a GOOD ACTOR!
I:27389;391;8 Mile is a jewel of a movie, the acting by Eminem is just good.
I:27389;392;The story is kind of weak, but darn good acting by Marshall Mathers, and Kim Bashinger.
I:27389;393;Her boyfriend is a drunk who lives off Workers Comp, and he has a sister who is a beautiful little girl.
I:27389;394;It's good, don't get me wrong.
I:27389;395;His three friends keep the movie funny.
I:27389;396;"His best friend of the group it seems is David (or ""Future"") played by Mekhi Phifer (""Save The Last Dance"") who does an excellent job."
I:27389;397;Rabbit also ends up meeting a girl with a similar background aspiring to become a model, played by newcomer actress Brittany Murphy.
I:27389;398;"nominated actress Kim Bessenger (""Bless The Child"", ""I Dreamed of Africa"") did a great job as Jimmy's mother."
I:27389;399;After seeing this movie I also had a lot more respect for rappers who get popular by the streets as well as people who live in Trailer Parks.
I:27389;400;The answer to that question is definitely a solid yes.
I:27389;401;All B. rabbit (and his boys, who will remind you of D12, Em's group in real life) want to do is get their big record deal, and be able to get out of 8 Mile.
I:27389;402;The movie shows B. rabbit/Eminem's passion for hip hop (some of the best scenes take place at the The Shelter), how he struggles day to day to make it in 8 Mile where he is frequently singled out and jumped for being a white rapper, protecting his little sister, and also dealing with his drug addicted and bipolar mother.
I:27389;403;Don't get me wrong I already did like Eminem, but once I saw this movie, I was really impressed because it does show real emotion and what it was like for Eminem to get to where he is today, but also has it's genuinely funny moments.
I:27389;404;If you haven't seen this already, you definitely need to.
I:27389;405;He has an amazing ability to link words and rhymes to make you laugh at yourself, him and others.
I:27389;406;His talent as a writer and rapper shine in this movie.
I:27389;407;Not being very familiar with this type of music myself, I found the battle scenes very interesting and they are without a doubt the best parts of the movie.
I:27389;408;My favorite being an impromptu rap Rabbit creates with a friend to Sweet Home Alabama while trying to fix a car.
I:27389;409;I thing this movie may in a lot of ways bring some of the hidden aspects of hip hop life styles and rap battles to public light.
I:27389;410;eminem does an excellent job acting in this movie, but it is easy to act from experience.
I:27389;411;the bottom line: See the movie, it is worth a viewing.
I:27389;412;The battle scenes are entertaining and by far the best part of the movie.
I:27389;413;letter quotient mentioned above as an example), the overall story (where the clueless comment comes from), the absolutely low.
I:27389;414;The movie line may not have been totally fresh, but the direction it was taken in makes it a lot better to see.
I:27389;415;anyway, Eminem's music helps people.
I:27389;416;Anyway the movie is really good.
I:27389;417;I don't mean to condemn the entire genre because I can enjoy a bit of it now and then and Eminem would rank as one of my favorite artists within that genre.
I:27389;418;Detroit is a particularly good example because of the dramatic changes in the automobile industry.
I:27389;419;Only a few decades ago, Detroit was one of America's great cities.
I:27389;420;Well, viewing this movie is a way to do it.
I:27389;421;Rap is still with us 35 years later and is still going strong.
I:27389;422;Well, this movie provides a lot of views for these type of questions.
I:27389;423;8 mile is a fairly good depiction, I would guess.
I:27389;424;Eminem made a strong movie debut with 8 Mile.
I:27389;425;Along with a good cast this movie did well at the box office.
I:27389;426;I thought that Eminem and Mekhi Phifer did the best acting jobs.
I:27389;427;It was a very interesting story about setting goals and never giving up, just like what Eminem did.
I:27389;428;The battles are great, especially the last one.
I:27389;429;This movie is surprisingly great, but leave the little ones at home.
I:27389;430;go out and see this!
I:27389;431;good because in the soundtrack therer are wonderful hip.
I:27389;432;"tang Clan or ""Who Shot Ya"" of Notorious B. i. g.,and this film is probably the most influent film of 2002."
I:27389;433;"The most interesting moments of the film are ""fo'sure""freestyles,it's epic the free of Rabbit VS Mike (Xzibit,west coast rapper)."
I:27389;434;a film dedicated to rap music and ghetto life.
I:27389;435;For a superstar known as a ticking time bomb, Eminem is a surprisingly savvy businessman.
I:27389;436;class realism than Hype Williams' flashiness.
I:27389;437;class character study driven by a mesmerizing central star turn.
I:27389;438;But where John Travolta found escape on the dance floor, Eminem finds salvation and redemption in battle.
I:27389;439;prisoners form of lyrical combat that places a heavy emphasis on improvisation and crowd reaction.
I:27389;440;love interest, an aspiring model who sees him as her way out of Detroit, but who seems willing to hitch her fortunes to somebody else in case he doesn't work out.
I:27389;441;effortlessly authentic in its depiction of working.
I:27389;442;class despair and the hope engendered by hip.
I:27389;443;hop's promise of upward social mobility, 8 Mile brings to the forefront the lower.
I:27389;444;doubt to triumph and self.
I:27389;445;confidence, but the film's absolute conviction keeps it from feeling formulaic.
I:27389;446;culture royalty, Eminem has transformed the messy emotions of his life into musical black comedy.
I:27389;447;In 8 Mile, that life becomes an equally riveting drama.
I:27389;448;Not being a big fan of Eminem, I wasn't sure how much I'd enjoy this movie.
I:27389;449;Eminem`s first experience as an actor is a surprising one, developing an interesting character in a good urban drama.
I:27389;450;the story isn`t too original, but is well told and acted.
I:27389;451;hanson captures well Rabbit`s story and the atmosphere of the community he lives in, showing the conflicts he must face to achieve his goal.
I:27389;452;The realistic direction and the gritty, dark photography add a natural, credible tone to the movie, showing how`s life in those convulted suburbs.
I:27389;453;"not a masterpiece, but given that most films with or about musicians are generally weak, ""8 Mile"" stands above average and succeeds delivering a tension."
I:27389;454;written story, with characters worth caring about.
I:27389;455;Perfect gift for my son, he loves it.
I:27389;456;Hard to believe this movie is practically a classic now, but it is worthy of being so!
I:27389;457;A cool glimpse into the hip.
I:27389;458;a movie you can watch again and again.
I:27389;459;Great movie of a portrayal of his life.
I:27389;460;Wish he made more movies!
I:27389;461;"Two kinds of filmgoers may want to see 8 Mile, fans of Rap/Eminem and those who thought Curtis Hanson's ""LA Confidential"" was one of the best films of the last few years."
I:27389;462;Eminem films are likely to be very happy.
I:27389;463;Eminem turns out to be a surprisingly good actor and the music is brilliant.
I:27389;464;Eminem plays Jimmy's, whose relationships with his friends, family, workmates and girlfriends are well handled, as are his efforts to break into the commercial world of Rap music.
I:27389;465;This is an interesting film that I enjoyed, but no Oscars this time!
I:27389;466;The personal accomplishment in being able to overcome what's in your way and get somewhere in life?
I:27389;467;That's why I enjoyed 8 Mile.
I:27389;468;I thought the lyrics in the battle scenes were excellent, the gritty look and feel of Detroit was well portrayed (some excellent wide shots in parts), the comaraderie between Em and his friends and watching what kind of trouble they get in on a Friday night.
I:27389;469;playing yourself most of the time is a pretty easy thing to do and Em performs very well.
I:27389;470;I was impressed with this movie.
I:27389;471;But the plot was great.
I:27389;472;"This is a good movie, and it does earn it's ""R"" rating with language and some sexual content."
I:27389;473;All the music in the movie is rap/hip.
I:27389;474;hop and much of it Eminem wrote himself.
I:27389;475;I bought the soundtrack as well and loved it.
I:27389;476;I saw this movie and was soo surprised of how well it was.
I:27389;477;This movie blew me away by how good of an actor he is and how well the movie was.
I:27389;478;Its soo amazing I would tell anyone who loves Eminem as much as i do to go see it you'll be BLOWN away!
I:27389;479;Best movie I've seen in years!!!
I:27389;480;i think the movie 8 mile is so awesome and eminem is so like haw do you put it sexy.
I:27389;481;Brittany Murphy play a good part in the movie.
I:27389;482;"This is ""Rocky"" for the new millenium!"
I:27389;483;"Not since Tupac's performance in ""Juice"" have I seen a rapper turn in this great of an on."
I:27389;484;"He could be like Frank Sinatra
I:27389;485;After watching this movie, I truly started to respect Eminem as a person and an artist.
I:27389;486;Eminem to this day is the only rap artist that I like and respect.
I:27389;487;This movie should be viewed by everyone and is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:27389;488;"autobiographical film) 8 Mile is the inspiring film about Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith, a guy that works for little money and lives in a trailor with his mother."
I:27389;489;eminem gives a very well.
I:27389;490;done performance as the lead character and Kim Basinger and Brittany Murphy back the film with wonderful supporting acting.
I:27389;491;I loved how 8 Mile gives a realistic (if not slightly stylized) look at low.
I:27389;492;class life in a big city.
I:27389;493;The film is never shy of revealing the raw truth to you.
I:27389;494;The writing behind this film is very good and sends an inspiring and powerful message across to people who need the courage to follow their dreams.
I:27389;495;this film is remarkable and very, very overlooked for its excellence in credibility and overall entertianment values.
I:27389;496;Eminem proves he is an outstanding actor and makes the story unquestionable.
I:27389;497;He can't even bring himself to challenge the local rappers on stage during the weekends.
I:27389;498;brittany Murphy disappoints in this movie if you've liked her previous movies.
I:27389;499;It just goes to show he can both sing and act and IS truly talented.
I:27389;500;The acting in this film is what first gets my nod.
I:27389;501;Granted the cinematic exaggeration, the acting is so real some might think the film a documentary.
I:27389;502;That's how good the characters are played.
I:27389;503;"I am a fan of Eminem's music
I:27389;504;"The title song and ""Lose Yourself"" are absolutely phenomenal songs that appeal to all music lovers (even if you don't like rap, you will at least appreciate the talent in these two songs if you appreciate music at all)."
I:27389;505;all in all, this is a good heavy drama to watch on a weekday night.
I:27389;506;I enjoyed watching the cutting contests, but seeing Kim Basinger slum it, and everybody else beat each other down and show very little respect just got old.
I:27389;507;other than that, I was very very impressed.
I:27389;508;While I think Eminem is obviously a troubled individual, this film succeeds in explaining why he is the way he is.
I:27389;509;I can't wait until he grows a little more and decides to get on with his life, but hey, he's ranting all the way to the bank, so more power to him.
I:27389;510;If you have any sense of what's good and what's not, you'll agree that it's worth seeing.
I:27389;511;He generated many positive reviews and I hope this encourages him to do more film the future.
I:27389;512;He is truly an empire.
I:27389;513;One of the best movies I saw this year.
I:27389;514;Very good performance from Em and cast.
I:27389;515;If you're Em fan you'll love it, if you're not Em fan you'll love too.
I:27389;516;This movie is a modern day version of the music battles of the past.
I:27389;517;Any person that ever played in a school band will appreciate the intensity of this movie.
I:27389;518;Eminem did a great job making you believe in the movie, you forget he is a star while you watch him struggle to live.
I:27389;519;"The motor city ""Detroit"" is pasted all over this film, so East/West coast might not ""show the love"", but you know they saw it and deep down liked it."
I:27389;520;"They had some funny scenes, such as the ""Sweet Home Alabama"" scene."
I:27389;521;Kim Basinger does good as Jimmy's mama.
I:27389;522;Well, you've read the title, 8 Mile is the best movie of all time.
I:27389;523;It stars Eminem, and some other cool actors.
I:27389;524;This is a great movie for all Eminem fans, even non.
I:27389;525;eminem fans will love this movie.
I:27389;526;"When I first heard ""The Real Slim Shady"" on the radio that summer, I honestly thought it was some kind of practical joke."
I:27389;527;"The morning that ""8 Mile"" came out, I heard two radio hosts in New York City (a right."
I:27389;528;hop, the English subtitles make the movie remarkably easier to understand.
I:27389;529;It stands up to repeated viewings, which is the mark of a truly good film.
I:27389;530;"Director Curtis Hanson has made increasingly solid movies throughout his career (his early ""The Little Dragons"" was banned to the purgatory of monthly airings on the Lifetime Network in the late '80s
I:27389;531;"the magic element that makes ""8 Mile"" hang together is Eminem."
I:27389;532;"the supporting cast in ""8"" mile is also notable."
I:27389;533;"Mekhi Phifer, who first came to my attention with an explosive recurring role on the penultimate season of ""Homicide"", is outstanding as Rabbit's hip."
I:27389;534;"Someone named Evan Jones is quite likeable as ""Cheddar Bob"", quite possibly the dumbest sidekick to appear in a movie since Steve Buscemi in ""The Big Lebowski""."
I:27389;535;The third notable character is Detroit itself.
I:27389;536;You can also watch the film's excellent freestyle battles this way.
I:27389;537;the finest feature on the disc is a behind.
I:27389;538;The feature is all the more riveting for the fact that this sequence didn't make the final cut.
I:27389;539;i think this movie is well worth the money.
I:27389;540;get this movie and you'll enjoy it
I:27389;541;"And now Eminem, rap's bad, white guy, takes a drive down ""8 Mile,"" making a case that he's both a serious artist and a serious actor."
I:27389;542;But, like Elvis, a figure Eminem references several times in his songs, he continues to appeal to youth and upset the adults, all while making oodles of money and, now, films worthy of praise.
I:27389;543;Like Eminem, Rabbit lives with his mother in a trailer park.
I:27389;544;"His friends encourage him to become involved with ""battles,"" 45."
I:27389;545;Rabbit at work, Rabbit at play, Rabbit in love, Rabbit rapping .
I:27389;546;"The ""plot"" is loose at best
I:27389;547;a choice that any creative person will recognize.
I:27389;548;8 Mile works because it ignores its star and stays true to the spirit of creativity.
I:27389;549;It's a small but important victory in a person's life, and keeps the entire film in perspective.
I:27389;550;Director Curtis Hanson did the impossible: took a musical artist and turned him into a great actor in a very good movie.
I:27389;551;note that it has quite alot of profanity but is a good overall movie.
I:27389;552;dominated genre of rap, and Eminem is totally credible, including his interactions with Brittany Murphy, who plays his love interest, and Kim Basinger, who delivers a gut.
I:27389;553;wrenching performance as his beleagured mom.
I:27389;554;"You may also find yourself liking the rap itself
I:27389;555;8 miles is entertaining and a great story showing how it was for Eminem.
I:27389;556;This is a rated R movie so would say not for young eyes and ears.
I:27389;557;rap audience just as `Wild Style' introduced us to hip.
I:27389;558;and this is fine, because it's what a young man has to do: get on friendly working terms with who he is.
I:27389;559;eminem does have an authenticity about him that makes for a strong presence on screen.
I:27389;560;Paradoxically he projects a powerful inwardness, so that his turning away from everybody makes his face jump out at us.
I:27389;561;His effect is of authenticity, because he doesn't put on a reaction to please the audience or suit the scene, but he is always there, moving with the scene and in fact creating it.
I:27389;562;There have been dozens of movies about emerging music stars and their families, their early sponsors, their first big breaks, and so on, many of them with more range and specificity of detail than this one.
I:27389;563;The whole focus is on his personality and in particular his stillness.
I:27389;564;Even when he chooses not to compete and hands the mike back, this moment is full of power.
I:27389;565;In this movie Eminem carries the expression of sheer imminence, raw potential, to a new level of clarity and confidence.
I:27389;566;this rapper is good just standing there.
I:27389;567;Loved this movie, and I didn't think I would.
I:27389;568;So much energy from him, and plus I love his music, and the movie is about his freestyling.
I:27389;569;Gripping inspirational, very top of my list of feel good movies.
I:27389;570;I really liked this movie!
I:27389;571;Well mainly because Eminem is the main character, but it was very well directed!
I:27389;572;And He definitely has a talent for acting!
I:27389;573;We went to the other side of town and got tickets and it was worth the trip!
I:27389;574;It was a well written movie and it makes u really feel for the main charactr, Jimmy.
I:27389;575;So overall i think it was a great movie and even if you're not a fan of his u would enjoy it.
I:27389;576;I thought that this movie was really good, Eminem made a great debut as an actor.
I:27389;577;So yes this movie had a good plot and some good actors.
I:27389;578;mile movie is very good and I have to give Eminem props for his performance in the movie.
I:27389;579;I liked the story a lot(even though it's a quasi.
I:27389;580;i also liked the soundtrack a lot and I think that the acting in this movie is excellent.
I:27389;581;good Thing Is He Can Also Act AndI Think The Oscars Left Him Out For Best Actor.
I:27389;582;Otherwise A Truly Great Movie For All To Reflect On.
I:27389;583;but with most Eminem work, a natural curiosity brewed up.
I:27389;584;With all the hype and all the mouth of Em, I thought things would be lively.
I:27389;585;"Eminem does a good enough take as ""Rabbit"", the film's down."
I:27389;586;luck hero which is based of course on the star's real life.
I:27389;587;i really came to it with a natural curiousity since I love music.
I:27389;588;One of the more duller movies I've seen in a while.
I:27389;589;this is a really good movie and I recommend it even if u dont like Eminem its still a good movie and its not just the life story of Em it shows how tough it is to live in the ghetto.
I:27389;590;This is a fantastic movie and I Love It.
I:27389;591;It is a very good movie, and Eminim gives a dramatic, intense performance that I would never have expected.
I:27389;592;The films moves along quickly, has some intense rap battle sequences, and invloves Em's relationship with his mother played by Kim Basinger, and Brittany Murphy, the girl who convinces him to go for it all.
I:27389;593;Eminems performance is the standout of the film, but Brittany Murphy does an excellent job as Alex. She's sweet, sexy, and dangerous and it's always a pleasure to see Brittney in any film.
I:27389;594;I highly recommend this film to all Eminem fans and even not his fans, since I am not one.
I:27389;595;I have a new respect for the guy.
I:27389;596;He is immensely talented, and now we have a reason why he is so successful.
I:27389;597;My daughter bought this movey for her friend on my recomondation she watched it with me and loved it.
I:27389;598;Ironic because they are 16 and I am 46, and we loved it together.
I:27389;599;im not the biggest Eminem fan but this movie which chronicles the period in Eminems life when he was down and out is a stirring, gripping tail of a talented artist discovering his potential.
I:27389;600;I saw 8 Mile at the Cinema Grill, so i was able to have a meal while watching the movie.
I:27389;601;It was the perfect setting to watch 8 Mile .
I:27389;602;He is known to be the most talented rapper from his circle of friends, but froze onstage at a rap battle at the movie's opening.
I:27389;603;while i know that Eminem is an incredibly talented rapper, and enjoy the radio versions of his singles, I'm not a big fan of the conent of his albums.
I:27389;604;His acting is fantastic and he lends credibility to B Rabbit when he must rap (and rap well).
I:27389;605;This is his first movie, and he is being asked to carry the picture.
I:27389;606;the movie is gritty, and from all reports, accurately represents the feel of the 8 Mile area in Detroit.
I:27389;607;this is one of the best movies of 2002.
I:27389;608;first of all, let me begin by saying that I am one of the biggest movie buffs in the USA and I am a real critic and I keeps it real and tell it like it is.
I:27389;609;this movie was the best movie I've seen this year, in the movies that is!
I:27389;610;couldn't act if his life depended on it but after some people worked with him, other fellow actors and director, he made his first BIG SCREEN debut performance, very impressive.
I:27389;611;When I was sitting in the movie theatre, nobody moved.
I:27389;612;Everybody was laughing and cheering and clapping throughout the whole movie and that's a good sign.
I:27389;613;I was really enjoying the battles with Eminem against the opposing team.
I:27389;614;take it from a real critic.
I:27389;615;this movie is worth seeing.
I:27389;616;As he walks alone in an alley he almost grins to himself knowing he is well on his way.
I:27389;617;The full screen edition made it so much better.
I:27389;618;this movie is raw, edgy, full of profanity, and very much reality.
I:27389;619;Eminem does a good job acting.
I:27389;620;The music throughout the movie fits the scenes very well.
I:27389;621;Brittany Murphy's acting was good as well.
I:27389;622;This movie manages to pull this viewer into the story.
I:27389;623;This movie can have a powerful impact on certain viewers, depending on who they are.
I:27389;624;Personally, I liked it and I give it 5 stars.
I:27389;625;eminem is quite the rap star today.
I:27389;626;But, he stretches himself and his persona into this movie and the movie itself is surprisingly simple and easy to watch.
I:27389;627;He had already shown his rapping skills and enforced them through out the movie, but he does pull off a good performance as B. rabbit.
I:27389;628;He gets the performances out of the characters that were needed.
I:27389;629;I love this movie, but have also watched it about 34 times in the last four months.
I:27389;630;So, I see it every now and then, by borrowing it from a neighbor or something.
I:27389;631;The only reason I saw this movie was due to the fact that I liked Eminem, but the movie holds on its own, but Eminem does real well.
I:27389;632;Future is kind of Rabbits mentor.
I:27389;633;Alex is kind of a free spirited.
I:27389;634;Except the love in this movie is a lot stronger.
I:27389;635;In a sense its a biography.
I:27389;636;But this is a very entertaining and terrific film.
I:27389;637;But you should like this film.
I:27389;638;Very easy to watch because you can stream it thru a xbox app.
I:27389;639;I like the realness of the movie and the overall theme, struggles and successes.
I:27389;640;The movie starts off beautifully.
I:27389;641;"He has on headphones blasting ""Mobb Deep's"" ""Shook One's Pt II"" I'm not a big Mobb fan, but that song is nice, the beat pure fire to freestyle over."
I:27389;642;The song makes a nice intro, to an overall decent movie.
I:27389;643;Better then decent, if you consider this is Em's first attempt at real acting.
I:27389;644;The cast fits well here.
I:27389;645;He add's some really funny moments with a few of his lines.
I:27389;646;"It's especially funny when the rest of his crew is bad mouthing ""Free World"" under their breaths, and Cheddar blurts it out, starting a near riot between the rival clicks."
I:27389;647;The story is well told, and well acted.
I:27389;648;"I would have liked for it to have had more ""battle"" scenes."
I:27389;649;But she a remarkable job here.
I:27389;650;"Em does a wonderful job playing Jimmy ""Rabbit"" even if this is loosely based on his life."
I:27389;651;"The scenes with him and his little sister ""Lilly"" though, are very touching."
I:27389;652;I especially found the one's where he was fighting with his mom boyfriend.
I:27389;653;And afterwards saw his sis in the corner frighted to have a very real feel to them.
I:27389;654;"He did it because it was a role he related to, and in an indirect way it told his life story of growing up on ""8 mile"" road in Detriot."
I:27389;655;i love this movie so much!!
I:27389;656;i watched it all the time and its so amazing and very insprirational!!
I:27389;657;It is good that he gets it out in his music.
I:27389;658;She loved the move as well.
I:27389;659;This film introduces its audience to the magic, poetry, and gritty beauty of the rap world.
I:27389;660;For those who automatically pigeonhole rappers into unflattering catagories, this movie will force you to look a little more closely.
I:27389;661;It also makes a number of points that force rap's critics to take another look at the way that language is used in rap, and hopefully readjust their views.
I:27389;662;The truth of the matter is, Eminem does a reasonable job in his first film.
I:27389;663;The supporting cast are effective, nothing spectacular, but are an excellent foil for Eminem to work off of.
I:27389;664;if you're a fan of eminem's, definitely go see this movie.
I:27389;665;"It offers a look into not just the life of the fictional character Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith, but also at the world of hip."
I:27389;666;Eminem is very good in this movie.
I:27389;667;Kim Basinger had the perfect part and she was awesome.
I:27389;668;He goes through everything from having to move back into the trailer with his mom.
I:27389;669;It's a great movie though.
I:27389;670;ups at work, I was pretty curious to see this movie.
I:27389;671;"Besides, ""Lose Yourself"" had already won my heart."
I:27389;672;out slums south of 8 Mile, and eventually blows away the crowd with a rap worthy of Slim Shady hisself.)
I:27389;673;the rap scenes are great, unsurprisingly.
I:27389;674;finally, the values promoted in the film seem at cross purposes.
I:27389;675;so, when he's rapping, the star shines.
I:27389;676;The movie is great !!!!
I:27389;677;Eight Mile is a stylish, gritty and often explicative.
I:27389;678;He knows what I think of rap in general, and Eminem in particular.
I:27389;679;Oh, and we start with the new hip way of shocking an audience: live barf on screen.
I:27389;680;I didnt need to see that.
I:27389;681;Seems all he wants is a fair shake, and his best bet for getting it is to be able to create better art than anybody else.
I:27389;682;He has the support of a few friends, and he meets a heck of a girl, but only progressively does he come into himself.
I:27389;683;Hes offered a chance at a recording deal, but the man who offers it talks out of both sides of his mouth, and its hard to tell what to believe out of him.
I:27389;684;Okay, Brittany Murphy is a good.
I:27389;685;In his music, Eminem has openly attacked and berated his mother, yet B. Rabbit loves his mom, played by Kim Basinger.
I:27389;686;(Notably, we are able simultaneously to believe that Basinger is old enough to be Eminems mother and sensual enough to have a boyfriend her sons age.)
I:27389;687;Will the real Slim Shady please stand up, indeed.
I:27389;688;this is a very fine story.
I:27389;689;"If you can look beyond the vulgar language(acceptable in this atmosphere), you'll find that there is a gritty and true story to ""8 Mile."""
I:27389;690;Even though Eminem's character has so many tough breaks, you learn that it is with a strong supporting group of friends and believing in yourself that you can become successful at anything you put your heart into.
I:27389;691;Also, keep the youngsters away from this film.
I:27389;692;It's R. rated for a good reason.
I:27389;693;For those concerned, keep in mind that this movie is full of verbal and physical abuse and some very tense moments.
I:27389;694;8 mile is an entertaining film about self.
I:27389;695;but thethe movie is so good, and the message it gives is so powerful you cant help but like it by the time you get done watching it.
I:27389;696;This movie is about a guy who has the opportunity and talent to make something of himself.
I:27389;697;Also responsible for LA Confidential and Hand That Rocks The Cradle, Hanson certainly knows how to hone an emotional edge to his films.
I:27389;698;love interest Alex (played by sexy Brittany Murphy), the brothers and Kim Bassinger as Rabbit's trailer park mama all put in fine performances played against the backdrop of a bleak, run.
I:27389;699;There's no time to get bored and one can only marvel at the mental and linguistic agility of the rappers, many of whom are genuine.
I:27389;700;The film is beautifully crafted and builds up to a worthy finale.
I:27389;701;8 mile will take you about 105 minutes to watch it.
I:27389;702;Even Kim Basinger and cute Brittany Murphy don't look the same.
I:27389;703;we went to the movie and loved it.
I:27389;704;eminem's performance shows his real side that you don't normally see.
I:27389;705;the way he helps his mother and friends shows he is not selfish.
I:27389;706;I went and saw this at the movie theater, and I thought it was great.
I:27389;707;I liked the movie because it's got some real.
I:27389;708;As I watched 8 Mile for the second time, I came to a realization.
I:27389;709;In both the classic disco movie and this modern rap movie, music is a driving force.
I:27389;710;Both keep their heads above water strictly because of their burning desire to perform.
I:27389;711;both John Travolta and Eminem took hold of their roles with unexpected fervor.
I:27389;712;Both were real and sympathetic.
I:27389;713;This movie deserves to share the classic status of Saturday Night Fever.
I:27389;714;After believing that Eminem's 15 minutes were up about two years ago, I was incredibly impressed to see just how good his performance was in 8 MILE.
I:27389;715;Not only was the film extremely well acted, but it is very entertaining, as well.
I:27389;716;It takes a bit to get used to the street lingo, but I think fans will have a field day with it, nonetheless.
I:27389;717;(That should sell a couple tickets, as is!)
I:27389;718;Although definitely not a film for everyone, the film showcases a new talent for Eminem that many will enjoy.
I:27389;719;The film is clever and fun.
I:27389;720;I love him, love him.
I:27389;721;A great story for fans of Eminem or if you just want an underdog story.
I:27389;722;:) Always great to know where someone started.
I:27389;723;I love Eminem, and he is a good actor, don't get me wrong, but I just couldn't feel the movie.
I:27389;724;And Eminem shows it how it really is.
I:27389;725;"But yes ""8 Mile"" Looks like a very powerful film and it will be enjoyed by other viewers besides his fans."
I:27389;726;As for our other pop stars, you can just tell they had life made for them.
I:27389;727;8 Mile is a good movie.
I:27389;728;actor, or it is a good movie for it's genre, I mean it is a good movie.
I:27389;729;His motivation is clear though.
I:27389;730;His way out is music, that's it.
I:27389;731;"the film is ""losely"" based on Eminem's real life."
I:27389;732;Eminem is good in the film.
I:27389;733;No, he stayed true to his roots, a smart decision.
I:27389;734;This is how Eminem, the character, was created.
I:27389;735;His real name, like Jimmy Smith, is Marshall Mathers.
I:27389;736;But to conclude, this is a good movie.
I:27389;737;Eminem does a good job in his debut and lead role as B Rabbit.
I:27389;738;He meets a girl (Brittany Murphy) and likes her.
I:27389;739;What made this movie so good, was the comedy aspect of it.
I:27389;740;It's set in a ghetto, and Rabbit and his friends are poor, but their so funny, I laughed so hard when Cheddar Bob shot himself by accident, and the fat guy is a riot, he constantly makes hilarious jokes.
I:27389;741;The only part I really liked was the ending and how it tied in well with where he was in life.
I:27389;742;I recommend this to anyone with an interest in em or rap.
I:27389;743;we have turned this on to our daughter too and she loved it.
I:27389;744;The character Eminem plays is named Rabbit and he grows up in a trailer park with his mother, played by Kim Bassinger, who is excellent in the role.
I:27389;745;His little sister is exposed to his mother's numerous boyfriends and it is with this little girl that Rabbit shows the most tenderness.
I:27389;746;Rabbit works in a car plant but his whole life is about rap music and he hangs out with a group of both African American and white friends who feel the same way.
I:27389;747;Much of it is spontaneous.
I:27389;748;And much of it is competitive, where insults fly and there's always a battle to see who will win over the audience.
I:27389;749;i liked the part that Eminem played.
I:27389;750;He comes across as real.
I:27389;751;He shows vulnerability as well as strength and I rooted for him throughout.
I:27389;752;This was not surprising because the film has a good script and is well paced with plenty of confrontations and tension.
I:27389;753;What surprised me is how much I enjoyed the rap music.
I:27389;754;It's all about words and being creative.
I:27389;755;But by the end of the film I was completely won over to rap as an art form.
I:27389;756;i loved 8 Mile and highly recommend it.
I:27389;757;I have a new respect and appreciation for Eminem and his music.
I:27389;758;Eminem does a great job at acting.
I:27389;759;He can do it better than he can rap!
I:27389;760;i recomend it to anyone.
I:27389;761;When I saw previews for this movie, it made me curious, and also a bit uninterested at the same time.
I:27389;762;"Go watch it because he's in it!"""
I:27389;763;The birght spot in his life?
I:27389;764;The character goes through a lot of drama with friends, and has to overcome both the oppression of others and his own hang ups in order to make it.
I:27389;765;But this is a pretty original story.
I:27389;766;If you're a true fan of hip.
I:27389;767;hop you'll love this movie.
I:27389;768;I dont know who actually wrote all the rhymes but they are lyrically very nice.
I:27389;769;Eminem does a really good job playin his character, and all the characters are likeable.
I:27389;770;All around this movie is well done and was a really nice surprise for me.
I:27389;771;The message of overcoming obsticales and finding your own niche in life is well woven into the story.
I:27389;772;It's all right if you are into that type of thing.
I:27389;773;thank u for sending my son loved as he christmas present.
I:27389;774;i loved this movie, but i really like Eminem.
I:27389;775;It is a great movie because it has eminem in it.
I:27389;776;I expecially liked the rap vbattles throughout the movie
I:27389;777;The movie was good but lacked in some of the important aspects.
I:27389;778;I love this movie so much.
I:27389;779;I already had a lot of respect for Eminem and it made me love him even more
I:27389;780;Eminem's surprising acting abilities coupled with a great supporting cast, including his mom played by Kim Basinger made the movie a success!
I:27389;781;I highly recommend this movie, though I would definitely adhere to the rated R review.
I:27389;782;This is my husband's favorite movie of all time.
I:27389;783;He can really relate to the main character's struggles.
I:27389;784;Although the language and violent scenes were rough, it played well with the plot.
I:27389;785;Really captures his life really well.
I:27389;786;The acting is really good and the raps are even better!
I:27389;787;even though he hasnt taken any formal acting classes he still looks like he's gonna deliver a good performance.
I:27389;788;it wasn't the best film I've ever seen, but it was still worth the wait.
I:27389;789;I think he is very clever, to be able to think up rhymes like that on the spot.
I:27389;790;making up rhymes on the spot.
I:27389;791;Even if they are rather offensive to the opponent, some of them are still really witty.
I:27389;792;but this is a really great film .
I:27389;793;I recommend it to all ages except those under thirteen because of the sex scene and violence.
I:27389;794;Eminem did what few musicians can do, he made a successful transition from musician to actor.
I:27389;795;The movie has an excellent plot and basically deals with real life.
I:27389;796;the acting is excellent and music is great, even though most of the movie is a serious drama, it does have a few excerpts of adult situated comedy.
I:27389;797;For anyone who is a huge Eminem fan .
I:27389;798;they will love seeing this film and Eminem in action .
I:27389;799;it was a good movie.
I:27389;800;This movie had great acting and good writing, the plot was simple but it was the attention to detail that makes it noteworthy.
I:27389;801;the movie was directed by one of my favorite directors, Curtis Hanson.
I:27389;802;The few bright spots in his life are his kid sister, his small group of loyal friends and his musical talent.
I:27389;803;There are certainly many parallels between his life and character he plays.
I:27389;804;as a movie about pop music culture, this one is superior to most others.
I:27389;805;The movie was pretty good, I mean Eminem is a good actor in this film.
I:27389;806;It doesn't show anything but It is better to stay safe.
I:27389;807;This is one o the best movies ever!!
I:27389;808;It is so inspirational and eminem is the best!
I:27389;809;He is such a good rapper!
I:27389;810;And this movie is really good
I:27389;811;Maybe somewhat but definitely not what I thought it was going to be.
I:27389;812;Honestly I don't know much about his life other than he hates his ex Kim and he is ticked at his Mom.8 Mile is a pretty good movie though on its own.
I:27389;813;and he's really good at it.
I:27389;814;And really that's basically the gist of the movie.
I:27389;815;Kim Basinger plays his mom and does a really god job.
I:27389;816;rabbit is good and needs to battle.
I:27389;817;And then you hear 'Sweet Home Alabama' playing from inside the trailer and Rabbit and his friend start free styling to it and it really sounded good.
I:27389;818;The last 3 battles were really good on Em's part.
I:27389;819;I thought that was funny.
I:27389;820;Though, this is what I would have expected had I known that the story took place in '95 as director Hansen is a master of time and place.
I:27389;821;Because outside of the music itself, everything in the film (good and bad) reflects the good and ill of hip hop.
I:27389;822;All of the scenes of male camaraderie, be it rousting about an open car hood or charging into battle with another click, rings true and reflects a certain joy and zeal.
I:27389;823;I'm referring to the sexy.
I:27389;824;I am no fan of Eminem but kept hearing that I should see 8 Mile.
I:27389;825;It is at times hard to watch but surprisingly well acted and for fans of rap, it has a stronger appeal.
I:27389;826;this is the Purple Rain of hip.
I:27389;827;But his acting is great and the fact that he wrote most of the soundtrack shows that he's one of a kind.
I:27389;828;"i did enjoy this film
I:27389;829;There's chemistry between Brittany Murphy and Eminem and she definitely acts like she's enjoying herself during their sex scene!
I:27389;830;Lose Yourself, which is perfect for this film.
I:27389;831;the finale is the highlight of the film, worth watching just for that .
I:27389;832;"The whole sequence wouldn't be what it is without the extras
I:27389;833;It's one of the best songs that Eminem has done, for me, and seeing the video sheds new light on the song.
I:27389;834;The lyrics, like most of Eminem's songs, are fantastic, and I'm constantly humming it.
I:27389;835;All the video is brilliantly shot especially the shots of Eminem with 50+ women in their underwear .
I:27389;836;you can barely see him most of the time!
I:27389;837;8 Mile is a must see for all Eminem fans and recommended even for non.
I:27389;838;I have always loved Eminem because I think the way he puts words into a rap are amazing.
I:27389;839;This movie not only displays his rap skills, but his acting skills as well.
I:27389;840;I really enjoyed this movie for several reasons.
I:27389;841;First and foremost because it stars Eminem, second it contains drama and comedy.
I:27389;842;The rap battles are incredibly funny and witty.
I:27389;843;Even people who do not like Eminem's music will enjoy this movie.
I:27389;844;He uses his talent for rap to try and make it out of the trailer park home that he lives in with his deadbeat mom and her drunk boyfriend.
I:27389;845;All Jimmy wants to do is make it big doing what he loves most .
I:27389;846;Even on his way to work at a Detroit factory, he works on lyrics for his songs, praying that one day he'll create that killer demo tape that will launch him into stardom and out of his mom's trailer park home.
I:27389;847;Eminem plays this role with such intensity, you almost forget that this is a rap star and not a seasoned actor.
I:27389;848;Mekhi Phifer convincingly portrays Future, a friend of Jimmy's who also is the MC of the local rap battles.
I:27389;849;Kim Bassinger is great as Jimmy's screwed up mother and Brittany Murphy shines once again as Jimmy's girlfriend.
I:27389;850;Not only did I enjoy watching the down.
I:27389;851;good story, but the soundtrack is awesome.
I:27389;852;My advice: see this movie .
I:27389;853;"Eminem's performance as Jimmy/Rabbit in ""8 Mile"" is as auspicious and as natural and un."
I:27389;854;"the plot of ""8 Mile"" is very straightforward: a quick."
I:27389;855;"the best scenes in ""8 Mile"" are the sweaty, intense rap duels set in a dark, dank nightclub."
I:27389;856;I am not a fan of rap yet I felt the heat, the fervor, and the commitment of the rappers up front and in my face.
I:27389;857;Hanson sets these scenes in such a way so as to jam the rappers and their raps down our collective throats.
I:27389;858;If nothing else, this film will serve to educate/wake people up to the emotional connection and dedication that so many young people (of all races) feel for rap.
I:27389;859;There is a transcendent and spellbinding truth going on in rap that frankly I, along with many others, felt cut off from.
I:27389;860;Mehki Phifer with dreadlocks dont cut it as well.
I:27389;861;He seems confident and ready, until he runs to the toilet and regurgitates.
I:27389;862;As much as he wants to do this, he's still scared out of his mind.
I:27389;863;"He has dreams of becoming a rapper, but he knows that until he is able to act out on it, that's all it is
I:27389;864;The others, well, just like to talk, and it seems like that's all they'll ever do.
I:27389;865;"A very important figure is Future, Rabbit's friend, and the host of the ""battles."""
I:27389;866;He sort of looks over him like a father figure, always encouraging him and telling him that he can be something if he puts his mind to it.
I:27389;867;He broke up with his girlfriend, which means moving back with his mother and little sister in a trailer home, along with his mother's boyfriend who can't stand Rabbit, (the feeling is very mutual).
I:27389;868;He works at a job in where his boss is looking for any excuse to fire him.
I:27389;869;8 Mile is a sad, and yet triumphant film about how far someone will go to make their dreams come true, no matter what obstacles are thrown in the way.
I:27389;870;It's a very well done movie, at that.
I:27389;871;Curtis Hanson does a terrific job of directing, and I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that he was qualified for the job.
I:27389;872;The struggles and achievements are real and not artificial.
I:27389;873;eminem brings great charisma onto the screen.
I:27389;874;All the critics are saying how good of an actor he really is.
I:27389;875;Eminem proved that he could do a great job on screen.
I:27389;876;the other actors are also really great in the movie.
I:27389;877;Brittany Murphy does a terrific job of playing Alex, Rabbit's somewhat new love interest.
I:27389;878;Mekhi Phifer is also outstanding as Future, and proves to be a great friend to Rabbit, through the good times and the bad.
I:27389;879;I can see that, because seeing the movie really gives you more of an idea of what Eminem had to go through to get to where he is right now.
I:27389;880;He is the real deal.
I:27389;881;"There are things you can see where the inspiration came from
I:27389;882;Though this movie may be fiction, you can really see the truth in it all.
I:27389;883;8 Mile was a terrific film that I really enjoyed.
I:27389;884;It's a story about hardships, obstacles, struggles, and goals.
I:27389;885;"That's what the film ""8 Mile"" asks us."
I:27389;886;It's a story that helps us realize that some things are possible, but it's up to us to make sure they happen.
I:27389;887;Best true story and most motivating thint out there to chase your dream.
I:27389;888;And he does BOTH with such ease!
I:27389;889;This really IS a great movie, and well worth the hype.
I:27389;890;A lot of musicians (Ice.
I:27389;891;For the most part, 8 Mile is a very clean movie.
I:27389;892;There's a girl from whom the protagonist draws his strength.
I:27389;893;And he has friends who are faithful to him to the end.
I:27389;894;In this movie, the girl is actually a [.]
I:27389;895;a freestyle showdown involving rap .
I:27389;896;and for that, you can respect Rabbit.
I:27389;897;He goes back to work.
I:27389;898;Is Eminem a great actor?
I:27389;899;But the movie doesn't try to be more than it is, and for that it earns my respect.
I:27389;900;Reality is, the culture he comes from is homophobic, and that's just the way it is.
I:27389;901;This film does a few things that I found immensly unusual, interesting and praiseworthy.
I:27389;902;downs of his race to his advantage are both flamboyant and hilarious, the movie itself frames the anti.
I:27389;903;fact style with which most of us working.
I:27389;904;last, but not least, I enjoyed the portrayal of today's young love.
I:27389;905;"The kind that can evolve into a ""I. love.you."
I:27389;906;The whole movie was great from the battle scenes to the home life.
I:27389;907;It also had some comedy in it.
I:27389;908;I hope it wins many grammies.
I:27389;909;I loved this movie and I would see it a million times.
I:27389;910;I recommend for all fans and nonfans to go out and see it, maybe you will change your mind about him as at least a person.
I:27389;911;I loved the movie Eminem is a great actor!
I:27389;912;I like how he took good care of Lily
I:27389;913;Several other characters in this movie, from his friends Future and Cheddar to his alcoholic mother were likable in there own way.
I:27389;914;The movie had several good lessons in it and, thank God, did not have a sell.
I:27389;915;the acting was good, the rapping was amazing and the storyline had a good flow to it.
I:27389;916;You may take something away from it.
I:27389;917;Boy is good at something, people try to make him do it, he resists, but he ends up doing it anyway.
I:27389;918;While the movie has an absolutley boring plot, I liked this movie alot.
I:27389;919;The freestyles were hot and the acting was excellent(mainly from Eminem and Mekiah Phifer .
I:27389;920;they seemed to have good chemistry).
I:27389;921;The slums were well done and the direction in the movie was great.
I:27389;922;Eminem's acting debut is phenomenal.
I:27389;923;The story is great, almost a biography about Em's life.
I:27389;924;He works at the local steel plant during the day, and battles his rhymes (when he doesn't chicken out) at night.
I:27389;925;Overall, 8 Mile was definately one of the greatest movies of 2002.
I:27389;926;good story based loosely on Eminem's own life.
I:27389;927;Mekhi Phifer plays Future, Rabbit's most loyal and sensible friend who pushes him to do better and has unfailing confidence in Rabbit's ability to succeed.
I:27389;928;Eminem's rapping talent and charisma are not in question.
I:27389;929;Even the uninitiated will be convinced that he has plenty of both, and tremendous screen presence as well.
I:27389;930;But the fact is that 8 Mile is a smart public relations move on Eminem's part.
I:27389;931;It's good mainstream fair, as is the soundtrack.
I:27389;932;And B. Rabbit is sweet enough and politically correct enough in his attitudes towards women, homosexuals and his loser friends to assuage middle.
I:27389;933;class audiences into thinking Eminem is a decent guy.
I:27389;934;It's an entertaining film, and Eminem has great presence.
I:27389;935;Rapper Eminem is one of the biggest names in rap.
I:27389;936;Boasting impressive settings, a really good cast, and gritty drama, this movie is fantastic from front to back.
I:27389;937;"we follow the story of Jimmy Smith (aka B Rabbit) who can flow like any rapper can, but the trouble is he is wicked shy of the crowd at the ""shelter"" where the rap battles happen."
I:27389;938;His friends Chedda Bob, Future (Mekhi Pfeiffer, who makes a strong presence here), and his other cohorts are his friends.
I:27389;939;He lives in a trailer with his alcoholic mother (played by Kim Basinger, who is vulnerable here), and his little sister.
I:27389;940;His mother strikes it big at bingo and things really start looking better.
I:27389;941;"Even the ending of the movie is really strong, with ""Lose Yourself"" playing in the background as Eminem walks off into the alley, having a newly restored confidence as he strolls back to work."
I:27389;942;the movie benefits greatly from Eminem's convincing performance.
I:27389;943;He mixes some good emotions and strong acting with impressive raps and this was bound to happen.
I:27389;944;He's good at what he does.
I:27389;945;The rest of the cast is good, too, with Brittany Murphy, Mekhi Pfeiffer and Kim Basinger all taking good turns honing their acting chops.
I:27389;946;Of course the rap bouts are the talk of the town, and you should find plenty to enjoy in these moments.
I:27389;947;But the quiet, anguished moments are just as strong, and the slum.
I:27389;948;All of it makes a big difference in the power and the lesson of the movie.
I:27389;949;Eminem does just fine in his big film debut here.
I:27389;950;You'll find a lot to appreciate here, with some laughs, some tear.y moments, and some gritty street drama.
I:27389;951;While many never thought Eminem could carry his own as an actor, 8 MILE presents a strong case for his possible future in this business.
I:27389;952;This is a good movie!
I:27389;953;This movie has a great message about staying true to your dreams.
I:27389;954;It has a lot of heart and quite a bit of humor.
I:27389;955;It's definitely worth your time.
I:27389;956;8 Mile is a romanticized biography on Eminem.
I:27389;957;It's no revolutionary step forward in urban drama, but it's a darn fine movie.
I:27389;958;As for rap superstar Eminem's acting, it was fine.
I:27389;959;"if you like rap music with an undying passion or aspire to be a rap artist, ""8 Mile"" may be worth your while."
I:27389;960;Included in the mix is Brittany Murphy, who plays a prostitute and Eminem's love interest.
I:27389;961;rated R for strong language, two scenes with some sexuality and one scene with strong sexuality, violence, drug use, and mature themes.
I:27389;962;Jimmys crew dream of becoming rap stars and see their rhyming skills as being their best hope of getting out of the inner city deprivation and urban wasteland of Americas famous motor city.
I:27389;963;eminem is not just the most famous rapper in America, he is quite simply the biggest star on the planet.
I:27389;964;In the superstardom stakes he is, if you will pardon the comparison, the new Michael Jackson (without the chimp, the plastic surgery, the dance moves and with a great deal more profanity).
I:27389;965;As The Wash proved, rap artists dont necessarily make great actors or great films (remember Vanilla Ice in the cringeworthy Cold As Ice anyone?)
I:27389;966;It is a credible and understated performance and 8 Mile is an entertaining and uplifting movie, which showcases his great talent.
I:27389;967;As always, Curtis Hansons direction is flawless and he has surrounded Slim Shady with an excellent supporting cast.
I:27389;968;"However, it is refreshing to see that 8 Mile is free of a traditional Hollywood ending and instead finishes on a more realistic note with an important message
I:27389;969;Hard work and perseverance are the keys to success and the only person you can totally rely upon in this life is yourself.
I:27389;970;I thought this was an excellent movie.
I:27389;971;It has a life story involved in it and overall, I think it is an excellent movie.
I:27389;972;I always like 8 mile I love Eminem he played a role in this movieI wish you made a part 2
I:27389;973;Thought this movie was great!
I:27389;974;Eminem did a really good job.
I:27389;975;What I do know is that I was impressed with his performance.8 Mile is a movie about a down.
I:27389;976;Feeling that his life is going nowhere, he pulls through and gains the respect he craves.
I:27389;977;although the storyline isn't the most original in history, the movie is entertaining and does inspire you to go out and be successful, no matter who tells you that you can't.
I:27389;978;"The much anticipated first acting role for rapper Eminem, ""8 Mile"", comes together way better than i thought it would."
I:27389;979;life and rappers going at it in competitions.
I:27389;980;The best rap scenes come about in the 'shelter', at Rabbit's work, and the previously mentioned rap duet with 'future'.
I:27389;981;"all in all, ""8 Mile"" is an excellent debut for Eminem in the movie industry."
I:27389;982;This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen in a very, very long time.
I:27389;983;I cried, I laughed, I even got mad.
I:27389;984;But that was the good thing about the movie, it kept you on your toes.
I:27389;985;besides I love Eminem's singing, actually what he sings about.
I:27389;986;He sings for real, about real life and that is what I like so much about him.
I:27389;987;i congratulate everyone in this movie and that had anything to do with this movie on their awesome work.
I:27389;988;What you see is definitely what you get.
I:27389;989;Although I'm sure that there are similarities that could be found, this is the fictional story of one Jimmy Smith, Jr. eminem is brilliant as this struggling young man, perhaps personal experiences added to his believability, mayhap he's just a damned good actor as well as musician.
I:27389;990;Big deal, at least he has a home.
I:27389;991;He's busting his butt to make a good impression on his boss during the day and struggling to overcome internal conflicts and realize his dreams of being part of the Detroit music scene.
I:27389;992;it seems like everything and everyone is against this brave young man, and the harder he struggles, the deeper he finds himself.
I:27389;993;He's a lyricist of incredible talent, verging well into genius status.
I:27389;994;The rhymes he can put together will make your head spin with amazement.
I:27389;995;And in that concept, he is definitely a soldier .
I:27389;996;fighting for respect and to make it as a rapper.
I:27389;997;this is a story of the street in today's world.
I:27389;998;It is a story to inspire hope and warm the heart.
I:27389;999;It is proof that it can be done.
I:27389;1000;Take another draw and don't give up, a little strength, determination, and talent go a heck of a long way.
I:27389;1001;There's also a segment on Eminem's personal insights into the making of 8.
I:27389;1002;In this, his debut feature film, that shows yet another facet of this contentious and scrappy personage he is glorious.
I:27389;1003;It'll pop you out of the blue funks and give you strength of purpose again.
I:27389;1004;I love Eminem, with his controversy baby!
I:27389;1005;Doesn't that keep you more interested?I loved the rap.
I:27389;1006;Despite all the hype built up around it when first released, I went into 8 Mile with an open mind, and came out pleasently surprised.
I:27389;1007;Yes, the storyline and plot is the typical underdog comes out on top story we've seen too much of in films of the past, but thanks to the smart direction of Curtis Hanson and a surprisingly solid cast, 8 Mile ends up being far better than it should be.
I:27389;1008;Kim Basinger gets extra kudos for her role as the alcoholic mother, and Mekhi Phifer is surprisingly good as well.
I:27389;1009;All in all, 8 Mile is a surprisingly good film that is worth checking out whether your an Eminem fan (or a fan of rap music for that matter) or not.
I:27389;1010;It shipped fast and the price was great.
I:27389;1011;As long as you are aware of the language it truly is a great movie.
I:27389;1012;8 Mile did nothing spectacular.
I:27389;1013;Eminem, from what I seen, played Eminem.
I:27389;1014;When you see as many films as I do, you expect a picture to move you, in some way or another.
I:27389;1015;Would I recommend you see it?
I:27389;1016;"8 Mile is the story of a young rapper named Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith Jr. who lives on one side of Detroit that is separated by the 8 Mile road."
I:27389;1017;This movie is a very good movie.
I:27389;1018;I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Eminem.
I:27389;1019;I watch it at least once a month.
I:27389;1020;Just as good as when it first came out.
I:27389;1021;She was at the peek of her career.
I:27389;1022;Eminem was a baby genius!
I:27389;1023;Everyone should have 8 Mile!
I:27389;1024;Does that make this a good movie, no.
I:27389;1025;I've heard over and over again about how amazing Eminem's acting is .
I:27389;1026;he is pretty good in the movie.
I:27389;1027;Put him in the role of a gay guy living in the upper east side and see how good of an actor he really is!
I:27389;1028;it's even worth watching once.
I:27389;1029;The only outcome of the ending is that he was able to beat the other guy in the rap.
I:27389;1030;Eminem act okay, well he act like himself.
I:27389;1031;Kim Basinger is good, very surprising to see her in that type of movie.
I:27389;1032;The only thing I had to said is if you are an Eminem fan you would love this movie.
I:27389;1033;Excellent movie, great story, good performance by Eminem.
I:27389;1034;fine production all the way around.
I:27389;1035;8 MILE is a good, not great, movie.
I:27389;1036;This scene shows us something about Eminem that has to be admired.
I:27389;1037;For the last three contestants, he allowed them to do their thing, and then responded by showing why he really is one of the best battle emcees on the planet.
I:27389;1038;He shows his talent and his competetiveness.
I:27389;1039;The entire film is a big set piece that leads up to the last minute and a half of Rabbit (Eminem) winning a rap competition.
I:27389;1040;A quick slice of Hollywood cash making, filmed with token characters and a story won in a packet of cornflakes.
I:27389;1041;Eminem's performance as a struggling rapper is both gritty and truly compelling.
I:27389;1042;I saw this movie at my theaters today and enjoyed the film alot.
I:27389;1043;Eminem (Marshall Mathers) who has never taken serious acting lessons at all and performed extremely well for his first film.
I:27389;1044;it was an emotional feeling film about a want.
I:27389;1045;As some might say, the film's ending was a bit off, but look at 'The Good Girl' with Jennifer Aniston, it ended terribly but it was one of the best films of 2002 and was at the Sundance Film Festival 2002.
I:27389;1046;I think Eminem deserved an Oscar for this film.
I:27389;1047;It is an Oscar winning movie!
I:27389;1048;I watched 8 Mile when it first came out and cant wait to see it again!
I:27389;1049;This was the best movie i have ever seen!!!
I:27389;1050;Like any other feel good movies, he's blessed with genuine friends who are selfless and supportive all along.
I:27389;1051;Eventually, he finds the truth and that he's courageous enough to take the next step into manhood, to be somebody.
I:27389;1052;He's in his element and it's surprising to note his charisma on.
I:27389;1053;The supporting cast is amazing.
I:27389;1054;"Brittany Murphy is convincing as a white trash girl who would ""sell"" her body to get somewhere
I:27389;1055;"What made ""8 Mile"" even more compelling to watch is the slum neighbourhood in Detroit which the Director uses to his advantage."
I:27389;1056;Even though the story is predictable, it's still a wonderful movie to watch.
I:27389;1057;8 Mile proves that Eminem is a double threat.
I:27389;1058;he can act and he can rap.
I:27389;1059;heart touching and violent this movie deserves more than it got.
I:27389;1060;"if I was in charge of the Oscar Ceremony,then this is my pick for ""Best Picture"",""Best Actor"" Eminem,Best Supporting Actor Mekhi Phifer,and Supporting ActressKim Basinger."
I:27389;1061;I really enjoyed this movie and it was convenient to watch it when i could fit it in my schedule.
I:27389;1062;Very good movie, shows that eminem is not just a great rapper, but can act as well.
I:27389;1063;I recomend it to anybody who likes rap or movies with a strong story
I:27389;1064;Simply said, this movie is more than worth your time.
I:27389;1065;Eminem, Marshall Mathers, shines in music but has also proven to shine on film.
I:27389;1066;"Inside 8 Mile you have ""real world"" credentials, and outside you don't."
I:27389;1067;The winner: the man (or woman) with best crowd reaction.
I:27389;1068;eminem does a phenomenal job as Jimmy Smith Jr.
I:27389;1069;He shows so convincingly, despair and fear, sensitivity and love.
I:27389;1070;I sat through the whole movie amazed and entranced.
I:27389;1071;Greed, power and lust rule in the world of 8 mile.
I:27389;1072;The setting itself displayed the sadness of the story.
I:27389;1073;"This movie is very possibly telling a fictionalized ""life story"" of his rise to stardom."
I:27389;1074;Influenced by everyday city life: street signs, graffiti, the coffee shop, Jimmy Smith and Eminem form the lyrics that one day lead to fame.
I:27389;1075;the reasoning behind the heartfelt acting: the movie was from the heart.
I:27389;1076;Jimmy's acts of protection of his sister greatly represent the way he wants to protect his daughter, Hailie.
I:27389;1077;In Eminem's world, friendship means a bond just as it does in Jimmy's world.
I:27389;1078;this is an EXCELLENT film.
I:27389;1079;There is very good reasoning behind the R rating of this film.
I:27389;1080;Also, there are a few lude scenes, mainly two, that are quite graphic and expressive.
I:27389;1081;The sexual scenes are very intense, as are most of the scenes throughout the film.
I:27389;1082;Intense is an excellent one.
I:27389;1083;Look, if you had, one shot, or one opportunityto seize everything you ever wanted, one moment,would you capture it, or just let it slip Taken from Eminem's song `Lose yourself,' these lyrics perfectly state the main message behind the movie.
I:27389;1084;You will always have that one shot.
I:27389;1085;bUT, That's a good thing!
I:27389;1086;Great first movie, I hope he does more.
I:27389;1087;I thought the story was good, that the characters came across real.
I:27389;1088;However, the acting is good (Eminem is surprisingly good), the plot is simple but somewhat novel, the editing is very good, the soundtrack is very good and the extras are very good (you have to check out the amateur rap fights).
I:27389;1089;Yes, I like Eminem and think he is one of the most creative artists of the 90s.
I:27389;1090;I also like classical music and classic rock.
I:27389;1091;the ending leaves us with hope and comes as a real positive outcome .
I:27389;1092;"It seems much more mature than many ""serious"" films being done these days."
I:27389;1093;eminem's acting was good, although a lot of that can be attributed to him basically playing himself.
I:27389;1094;Very entertaining and the music is kick a**!!
I:27389;1095;It gives you a look into the past of a very talented individual who fought his way to where he wanted to be.
I:27389;1096;i loved the way the movie was sooooo cheesy.
I:27389;1097;It was great from beginning to the end.
I:27389;1098;i definitely recommend this movie for anyone who wants a great belly laugh.
I:27389;1099;Highly Recommended, but still gets my very good so.
I:27389;1100;"Eminem knows and has the motivation to fix his car, both of which are glaringly absent in his ""friends""."
I:27389;1101;"And one wonders also about a Messianic, ""you save me"" attitude, versus an ""I take charge"" in what they can."
I:27389;1102;the only ones who are a real emotional support to him are, in a small way, his mom, and, in a major way, Lilly, his little sister.
I:27389;1103;She did her acting in a quite realistic way, that could only come up from a real.
I:27389;1104;eminem and Lilly's filial relationship shows an emotional intensity that brings out a caring and providing Eminem.
I:27389;1105;cheddar Bob is there mostly as a comic relief.
I:27389;1106;I think that Em did a really great job at acting in this film.
I:27389;1107;I also think that the director Curtis Hanson did a really good job on getting involved with the film.
I:27389;1108;I've never been crazy about Eminem, but he makes an auspicious debut with confidence and command.
I:27389;1109;Curtis Hanson, director, has always paid great attention to detail (think L A Confidential ) and, once again, uses Kim Basinger to good advantage.
I:27389;1110;There's a terrific 2.35:1 Widescreen, showing all the craziness of the audiences, and the bleakness of the slums.
I:27389;1111;My only complaint is, at the beginning, the music overpowered the dialogue quite often.
I:27389;1112;The Sound director got it together about half way through, but there were some important dialogues at the beginning that helped you to know what his problem was, and it required a bit of attention.
I:27389;1113;It's also one of those David Goliath films, where the underdog makes good.
I:27389;1114;I actually like those kinds of films.
I:27389;1115;"Eminem did a fine job
I:27389;1116;For a first movie, I am supremely impressed with the acting, I just want to clear up one common misconception, this is NOT about Eminem's life, he said it himself, there are some parts that did happen to him but he didnt wanna base it on his life because they could do more with the movie if they didnt.
I:27389;1117;He steals the show with his acting and on stage battles.
I:27389;1118;The cast, film and especially Eminem's on stage battles are excellent.
I:27389;1119;Absolutely good movie about how Eminem grew up on the street of Detroit poor with no dad and a substance abusive mom.
I:27389;1120;A very nice feel good story.
I:27389;1121;I thought Eminem did an outstanding job in this movie.
I:27389;1122;The whole movie was great, and had an interesting plot.
I:27389;1123;Eminem played his character very well.
I:27389;1124;All the freestyles were very entertaining and that [posterior] of his, ow ow!
I:27389;1125;I'd highly recommend this to anyone, any age.
I:27389;1126;Who can deny what great charisma Eminem has.
I:27389;1127;This movie takes you back to one of the golden eras of hip.
I:27389;1128;This movie portrayed all of the positive things in hip.
I:27389;1129;Eminem's charisma translates well into film.
I:27389;1130;but that's about all that makes it worth watching.
I:27389;1131;Now, for the good parts.
I:27389;1132;Mekhi Phifer (O, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer), as Rabbit's best friend Future, finally gets his teeth into a role that allows him to shine.
I:27389;1133;Between those two and Eminem, there's enough decent acting here to make it watchable.
I:27389;1134;but the truth is, I was looking forward to seeing this movie and it lived up to my expectations.
I:27389;1135;It was so good it could win some awards.
I:27389;1136;He had to do it with his friends.
I:27389;1137;the biggest of the megatheater's 24 rooms and saw a totally packed house, filled with kids mostly under 16.
I:27389;1138;eminem does a superb job playing the lost kid who finds himself and his integrity.
I:27389;1139;He makes that up in this movie.
I:27389;1140;The third act shows Eminem facing his truth.
I:27389;1141;One with Kim Bassinger (probably a body double) and two with Brittany Murphy.
I:27389;1142;appropriate for an R rated film.
I:27389;1143;Overall all, though he's done a brilliant job on the story.
I:27389;1144;I was extremely impressed with Eminem's screen debut, all the more so in that I am not at all a fan of rap.
I:27389;1145;Moreover, the world in which Rabbit, the rapper Eminem portrays, lives is portrayed vividly and convincingly.
I:27389;1146;But despite the holes, the movie at its core is powerful and convincing.
I:27389;1147;These are among the best scenes in the film.
I:27389;1148;It is referred to, but for the most part Rabbit's presence on the rap scene is accepted more than discussed.
I:27389;1149;I recognized it as Douglas Sirk's IMITATION OF LIFE, a 1959 film in which a beautiful, light.
I:27389;1150;This is one of my favorite movies that I own.
I:27389;1151;I've seen it about 4 times and it never got old.
I:27389;1152;This is a very inspirational movie for those who want to be rappers.
I:27389;1153;Even if you don't wanna be a rapper, it's still an inspiration.
I:27389;1154;Eminem's a good actor, and so is Mekhi Phiefer, so if you like either of the two, see this movie.
I:27389;1155;But my sister told me the story was excellent.
I:27389;1156;I like stories about struggling celebrity and with her recommendation I watched it.
I:27389;1157;With Eminem playing the part of himself, I truly enjoyed it.
I:27389;1158;I just got back from the movie and i gotta say that the movie was OFF THE HOOK.
I:27389;1159;Em was amazing, the music was tight, and actors such as Mekhi Phifer, Brittany Murphy, and Kim Basinger also deliver amazing performances.
I:27389;1160;The movie was great reccomend it to anyone lots of performances and like always eminem was great like anything he does or touches turned gold.
I:27389;1161;Eminem act is okay, well he act like himself.
I:27389;1162;com is better very surprising to see her in that type of movie.
I:27389;1163;i absolutely love this movie!
I:27389;1164;"Rapper Eminem makes a spectacular screen debut in ""8 Mile,"" a film designed to showcase the performer's talents as singer, songwriter and, now, actor."
I:27389;1165;and Jimmy has found rap music to be the best chance for his ticket out.
I:27389;1166;"Beyond the obvious handicap of his skin color, Jimmy is also having to cope with a crumbling relationship, an alcoholic mother, her abusive boyfriend and some ""concerned"" parties who, despite what they may say, may not always have Jimmy's best interest at heart."
I:27389;1167;each of these characters has the potential to become nothing more than a hokey stereotype, but the acting and the writing keep most of it real most of the time.
I:27389;1168;Kim Basinger, Mekhi Phifer, Britanny Murphy and several others all turn in fine performances in their roles, but it is Eminem himself who makes the film work.
I:27389;1169;Eminem is a natural on the screen, and it will be interesting to see if he will be able to so successfully inhabit a character who is not so carefully tailored to fit his ready.
I:27389;1170;8 Mile affords a fascinating glimpse into a subculture that many of us have hitherto viewed only from the outside.
I:27389;1171;"Especially intriguing are the ""hip."
I:27389;1172;"hop battles,"" wherein rappers come on stage and challenge one another to perform spontaneous mutual put."
I:27389;1173;The music may sometimes be execrable, but the love of language that pours forth out of the mouths of these young practitioners is actually quite encouraging and captivating (though one wishes that that talent would be channeled in a more positive direction at times).
I:27389;1174;If so, it is a gesture well worth making.
I:27389;1175;this movie really WAS like the hip.
I:27389;1176;shady persona to make an appearence and put an end to all the political correctness I kept seeing.
I:27389;1177;The last freestyle battle is wonderful.
I:27389;1178;Gives you an insight on how Eminem got introduced into the world of HIP HOP.
I:27389;1179;however I have to say that this movie overall is a good piece of entertainment.
I:27389;1180;The scenes of the mc contest and stuff is really good fun to watch too!
I:27389;1181;I have to admit, this is one good movie.
I:27389;1182;I don't care what kind of music you listen to, if you like or hate Em, this is a flick worth seeing.
I:27389;1183;This is a modern day rise to the top film.
I:27389;1184;First kind of shy to rap in front of people but after a warm up battle he got it!
I:27389;1185;GO SEE THE MOVIE!Ver interesting movie.
I:27389;1186;8 Mile, while brilliant at times, is only alright for the majority of the movie.
I:27389;1187;This movie takes a more sophistacated look than I would have expected at inner city life in a rough neighborhood and actually creates a sense of sympathy and hope for good will upon Rabbit that you would not expect to have for a gangster rapper.
I:27389;1188;But the movie is capped by a fantastic battle scene in which Eminem is spectacular.
I:27389;1189;I am white and I rap as well, and I can tell you that I face racism and feel like I have to prove myself ever time I go on the mic.
I:27389;1190;African American rappers seldom have to prove themselves the way white and asian rappers do.
I:27389;1191;that said, I found the film uneven, but still very entertaining.
I:27389;1192;Eminem does a much better job acting than he is given credit for and would outshine nearly any other rapper in a similar role.
I:27389;1193;The film moves a good pace and focuses on the elements it needs to.
I:27389;1194;Most actors do an admirable job, with the exception of an over the top, annoying Kim Bassinger.
I:27389;1195;The dialogue could be improved a little bit, and certain elements could have made the film more immeadiate and real.
I:27389;1196;So, I was eager to see the freestyle battle scenes, which were mind blowing and amazing.
I:27389;1197;I wonder how much of it they came up with on the spot, but each sequence was great.
I:27389;1198;Also, I personally liked the progression of the film, with its interesting portrayal of a inner city hip hop club all the way to the film's close with its ambigous ending.
I:27389;1199;In closing, a well acting, throughly entertaining movie with some amazing battle scenes.
I:27389;1200;Maybe that is one of the reasons that Eminem's performance in this book is surprisingly professional and excellent.
I:27389;1201;That is probably why Eminem's undefeatable talent attracts millions of audience and fans.
I:27389;1202;This movie is by far, one of the best movies I've ever seen.
I:27389;1203;I love Eminem in the first place, but after seeing this movie and realizing that he does have a true talent both acting and rapping, I was blown away.
I:27389;1204;For a good reason too.
I:27389;1205;Whatever the critics say about Eminem, he does have a true talent and through this movie, we see his love and passion for music.
I:27389;1206;I highly reccommmend this movie.
I:27389;1207;it was a great ride, and well acted.
I:27389;1208;I love the movie and especially Eminem himself.
I:27389;1209;Great job at making the movie a long time ago!
I:27389;1210;after seeing the the trailers I must admit I rolled my eye's, like i'm sure a lot of people did, and dissmised it.
I:27389;1211;By opening the movie that was I think that you care about Jimmy right from the get go.
I:27389;1212;He moves back with his mother (Kim Basinger) in a trailer park.
I:27389;1213;solid preformances by Britt Murphy as Jimmys girl and Mekhi Phifer as Jimmys friend.
I:27389;1214;Still the movie belongs to Eminem.
I:27389;1215;the movie and the charactors are well devloped and the plot is simple but plauseable (The Quiet Man wasn't a big story either).
I:27389;1216;The acting is very good and surprising considering that Eminem has never acted in a movie before.
I:27389;1217;the movie also deals with racisim on both sides of black and white and for that alone this movie is worth commending.
I:27389;1218;This film has a better soundtrack.
I:27389;1219;I was so impress by Eminem acting job in the movie that I saw it 3 times the opening week.
I:27389;1220;It is a great movie, based on Eminem's life and the story is well written.
I:27389;1221;I was a little dissapointed by the endding, but overall the movie is great.
I:27389;1222;Absolutely loves this movie, I've watched it twice already.
I:27389;1223;In great condition no scratches on the disc or anything.
I:27389;1224;Love love love the movie!
I:27389;1225;One of my favorite singers of all time!
I:27389;1226;It's a movie that tells you that you can make something of yourself,no matter what the circumstances are.
I:27389;1227;It's such a terrific movie.
I:27389;1228;Em is the most talented person in Rap.
I:27389;1229;This movie tells about the talented Em and how he found his voice and became a legend.
I:27389;1230;in da hood,Rapping to be cool, fairly understood,Pseudo.
I:27389;1231;that said, 8 Mile is shot well and the performances are actually quite good in parts.
I:27389;1232;he is in surprisingly confident form given his first attempt on the silver screen.
I:27389;1233;Kim Basinger is so good as the .
I:27389;1234;"although I hate rap with a capital C, I am glad to note that the music throughout the movie is fairly enjoyable and the ""rap battles"" are even funny at times."
I:27389;1235;"Some of the scenes that have the ""good guy"" Eminem ""winning"" are actually quite engaging."
I:27389;1236;I loved the movie and would recommend watching it but just not with Amazon
I:27389;1237;One small step for film.
I:27389;1238;Being infatuated with Eminem's original and brilliantly orchestrated lyrics, '8 Mile' has offered a chance to see Eminem's extraordinary vast talents.
I:27389;1239;It's a genuine prologue of a boy's life, whom is determined to become a man.
I:27389;1240;He soon meets a lady friend (Brittany Murphy), who maintains her distance, but takes part in Rabbit's rough road to triumph.
I:27389;1241;Jimmy dreams of dominating a lyrical freestyle tournament, and pursuing a career with it.
I:27389;1242;But in order to succeed, Rabbit must overcome his greatest fear.
I:27389;1243;I think that Eminem did excellent job this duty on the film is sewn on him.
I:27389;1244;He is known to be the most talented rapper from his circle of friends, but froze onstage at a rap battle at the movie's opening.
I:27389;1245;Something about this movie rang true about Marshall Bruce Mathers the III.
I:27389;1246;the thing I loved about this flick is the realism in it.
I:27389;1247;that's what makes this movie so great.
I:27389;1248;She described it in a rather odd fashion as `ghettolicious' which kinda took me aback, but after musing on it over the time span of several classes, I realized that ghettolicious is the best way to sum up the film.
I:27389;1249;a solid core of friends including the influential Future (Mekhi Phifer), the good.
I:27389;1250;Instead, he was excellent, or in other words, ghettolicious, here, displaying multiple facets of a considerable talent for characterization.
I:27389;1251;worthy performance, but it does stick out at me as one of the top ten that I have seen this year.
I:27389;1252;date in timing)(thanks to a fellow IMDb user for pointing that out!)
I:27389;1253;, I was genuinely pleased by director Curtis Hanson's final product, and with maybe a bit more suspense added to the unavoidable ending, `8 Mile' would have been the best film I have seen this year.
I:27389;1254;Regardless, `8 Mile' is an excellent and ghettolicious film deserving of a 5 out of 5.
I:27389;1255;8 Mile is a captivating and interesting look at the life Eminem had when he was growing up.
I:27389;1256;It recreates the streets brilliantly and dosen't hold back on anything.
I:27389;1257;Eminem's acting is amazing and unexpected.
I:27389;1258;The entire cast gives it their all and the end product is stunning.
I:27389;1259;The acting was okay, and I enjoyed the rap battles.
I:27389;1260;When I first heard about him doing this project, I just rolled my eyes and said great another hip hop artist, who thinks he can act .
I:27389;1261;I mean just because Will Smith, Ice Cube, Mos Def, Queen Latifah, Heavy D, and LL Cool J. okay I digress.
I:27389;1262;So some hip hop artist can actually act.
I:27389;1263;His acting was actually okay.
I:27389;1264;He seems to be a natural.
I:27389;1265;He has to move back to the trailer park with his mom, and his littler sister, and the unemployed man his mom is seeing.
I:27389;1266;He has a bunch of friends who are in his corner.
I:27389;1267;He shows major compassion for his friend Cheddar, especially when his friend gets trigger happy and accidentally shoots himself.
I:27389;1268;His other friend Future is the MC at the hip hop battles, and he sees big things in Rabbit .
I:27389;1269;He keeps encouraging Jimmy to do another battle, even though Jimmy does not have the confidence.
I:27389;1270;the scene that really touched me was watching his sister Lily screaming while Jimmy is getting beat up.
I:27389;1271;It was Entertaining and the extras were fun to watch.
I:27389;1272;I laughed while watching the auditions for the extras to get in the battle scenes.
I:27389;1273;Some of those folks were HORRIBLE, but again, it was fun to watch.
I:27389;1274;one of the things I really liked, when Jimmy finally wins his battle, and gets his props, what does he do?
I:27389;1275;Of course I was really curious if he had a job to back to.
I:27389;1276;this movie really surprised me, and I enjoyed it.
I:27389;1277;It's one I would actually watch it again.
I:27389;1278;He's down on his luck and has to move back home to his mom's house.
I:27389;1279;This makes the movie smart and easy to manufacture.
I:27389;1280;It's not the best film, but it does entertain as well as tell an effective story about challenges and courage.
I:27389;1281;Emeniem did a wonderful job in this role, and proved he truly could act.
I:27389;1282;8mile is well acted, rapped, and written.
I:27389;1283;8mile is a far better movie than most I have seen this year.
I:27389;1284;It cannot be denied that he is one of the most talented artists of our time, and all though his lyrics can be controversial at times, many of his songs are great.
I:27389;1285;Anyway, I say give this movie a chance, you may be surprised of how much you like it, and for some of you a chance to glance into another way of life.
I:27389;1286;A very strong performance and an excellnt script.
I:27389;1287;The rapping battles were excellent!
I:27389;1288;The stuff they come out with(especially eminem) is hilarious, and also extremly clever!i don't really want to say anything more about the movie except that you must see it.
I:27389;1289;Don't send me hate letters for that one, but it's true.
I:27389;1290;Eminem on the other hand, was brilliant in this movie.
I:27389;1291;The context of the battles is brilliant, and the acting is amazing.
I:27389;1292;Ordered it for my sister for Christmas got it in time and she loved it!
I:27389;1293;Obviously director Curtis Hanson, Producer Brian Grazer and the people at Universal Pictures thought so, and they were right.
I:27389;1294;He is outstanding in this film.
I:27389;1295;I was genuinely suprised by this movie.
I:27389;1296;The acting was great, the artfully done direction by the brilliant Curtis Hanson was terrific and the story isn't half bad either.
I:27389;1297;I haven't seen many scenes like them before and everyone does a fabulous job, especially Eminem, who blew me away.
I:27389;1298;He had a little sister that he loved and cared for like the dad he never knew.
I:27389;1299;He had a hard labor job in a factory.
I:27389;1300;Will he take it?That sums up the story of 8 Mile, a surprisingly engaging flick directed by Curtis Hanson (Wonder Boys) and starring rap sensation Eminem as Jimmy in his first big budget motion picture.
I:27389;1301;"Ever since his first single ""My Name Is"" hit the airwaves in 1998, Eminem has become a household name and with each album he releases, his listening audience is privy to the intimate details of his life."
I:27389;1302;Assured by his friends of his talent and an acquaintance with contacts, Jimmy has a shot at a future in the music industry.
I:27389;1303;"hopera ""Carmen"", does an admirable job as Future."
I:27389;1304;Murphy is merely an appendage, a love interest thrown in to produce more conflict but she does manage to create some steam with Eminem.
I:27389;1305;bottom line: Most people will see this film simply for Eminem's motor.
I:27389;1306;"Eminem fans will love this, in particular the soundtrack that supports it with the hit single ""Lose Yourself""."
I:27389;1307;Those looking for a remarkable dramatic performance from a multi.
I:27389;1308;Take it at face value while nodding your head at the catchy beats and crafty alliterations.
I:27389;1309;I liked this movie much more than I thought I would.
I:27389;1310;Eminem did a great acting job.
I:27389;1311;All in all this is a good movie.
I:27389;1312;Amazing movie and the shipping was fast amazon is amazing I would recomend because its really good at what it does and what its made for the movie was super good
I:27389;1313;That having been said, this is a great film and Marshall Mathers was born to play this role.
I:27389;1314;The ending is poetic and strangely fitting.
I:27389;1315;It is a real film with weight and merit.
I:27389;1316;the rest of the cast is excellent as well.
I:27389;1317;She grounds Rabbit and shows that with the love of the right woman any man can be saved.
I:27389;1318;Her scenes with Mathers go from highly comic to suspenseful and dramatic.
I:27389;1319;An Oscar nomination would not have been out of place for her work here.
I:27389;1320;eminem fans might just learn a little something from this local boy does good story.
I:27389;1321;Lose Yourself actually deserved the Oscar.
I:27389;1322;i love this movie, being from detroit, and i couldn't wait to get it.
I:27389;1323;i think this is an important film that really does reflect what its like to live in detroit.
I:27389;1324;i would highly suggest this movie as one that can be enjoyed by all people.
I:27389;1325;"These kind of movies have a formula, and ""8 Mile"" follows it religiously."
I:27389;1326;"Hose off the Detroit grit and the cliches are all there: the struggling talent
I:27389;1327;But you will be surprised to find that Eminem can act.
I:27389;1328;Less impressive are the tortuously correct scenes where the one.
I:27389;1329;perfectly captured by director Hanson in all its horrific squalor .
I:27389;1330;"As a story about that kind of moment, ""8 Mile"" works better than most in the genre."
I:27389;1331;I haven't read much about Marshal (Eminem) but I believe this movie is based on his life.
I:27389;1332;Got this movie for my daughter who has always love Eminem.
I:27389;1333;It was interesting to see where he came from and his up bringing.
I:27389;1334;Everyone I was with agreed that Eminem's acting was wonderful and exceeded all our expectations.
I:27389;1335;The freestyling was pure genius, and I found myself captivated by the skill and the hilariously provoking rhymes.
I:27389;1336;Set in the grimy Detroit ghettos, the occasional qualms of morality and the sparks of humor from Em's friends bring an authentic touch of reality.
I:27389;1337;The touching sensitivity Eminem portrayed with his little sister reflects his real.
I:27389;1338;life attitude, and this only furthers the originality and genuine tone of the movie.
I:27389;1339;the most she does is dance like a. However, I fully recommend this movie to everyone, excluding children, but including any rich white kid from the suburb (like those sitting behind me in the theater making cute comments throughout).
I:27389;1340;"It was more than a movie
I:27389;1341;Marshall Mathers, then you would see how wonderfully well this depicts the vision you might see while reading his auotbiography.
I:27389;1342;He is a great inspiration.
I:27389;1343;What most people have to do is look past what you think he depicts, and read between the lines.
I:27389;1344;this man has a lot going for him.
I:27389;1345;And I give him all the credit in the world.
I:27389;1346;and what a great actor!!
I:27389;1347;see the movie, you'll enjoy it till the end, and go home inspired.
I:27389;1348;i'm a big fan of his.
I:27389;1349;i love all the rap battles in it.
I:27389;1350;Thank you for the timely delivery.
I:27389;1351;riches story, hip hop's great white hope Eminem is Rabbit, who struggles to hold down a job while living in a trailer park with his mom (Kim Basinger) and kid sister.
I:27389;1352;esteem, Rabbit avoids the challenge until he meets his love interest, played by Brittany Murphy.
I:27389;1353;The hip hop themes, its Detroit location, and its script provide an all too secure safety net for the rapper.
I:27389;1354;It's funny because you get the vibe that they were really trying to make this a serious account when it couldn't be any further from the truth.
I:27389;1355;"I resent the fact that he's considered by ""rap"" fans (really just 12 year old girls and boys) as the best ever, that's b. s."
I:27389;1356;This movie is the best movie i have ever seen that is centered around music!
I:27389;1357;It has a great romance plot, and lots of twists in the story!!!
I:27389;1358;In my top 5 favorite movies!!!
I:27389;1359;reviewThe hype has died down and watching this again on the small screen at home still feels as engaging as it did in the cinema last year.
I:27389;1360;The common misconception about the movie relates to how much of the real Eminem one is seeing.
I:27389;1361;rising from the grime, Eminem's performance is both powerful and competent, allowing us generally to feel the character as a real person and thus making any sudden bursts of passion or rage as justified as the silence that surrounds them.
I:27389;1362;ing in a lunch line seems genuine as the quiet white guy chips in for the first time, and we gradually see his confidence build in front of us.
I:27389;1363;Yet it is told with a style and freshness that draws you in as you come to relate with the daily grind and suffering that the mundane existence of life inflicts upon each and everyone of 8 mile's inhabitants.
I:27389;1364;Upon a second viewing the opening sequence is as strong as ever, as the nerves of a first time performance get the better of Jimmy and we literally experience his tension from inside his head, blocking the world out through our headphones as we practise our performance from a dank disgusting toilet.
I:27389;1365;In all honesty it is refreshing to see a group of people depicted in a film from a poor urban environment freak out at the sight of gun during a fight, rather than move to a mass response of automatic gunfire.
I:27389;1366;the VerdictThough the star director combined to produce a sure.
I:27389;1367;Its not the finest film of all time by any length but it definitely knows its limits and works within them well.
I:27389;1368;Its still the grittiest feel good film of the year and has some of the best beats on a soundtrack in a long time.
I:27389;1369;I found 8 Mile to be a very enjoyable movie, thus exceeding my expectations.
I:27389;1370;"Even more unexpected is the fact that Eminem gives a great performance in his acting debut
I:27389;1371;I found his acting to be very genuine and real.
I:27389;1372;Kim Basinger does a fine job as well, though it took some time to get used to her in her role as a struggling mother in a rough neighborhood.
I:27389;1373;This was most likely done to give the movie a rougher edge, and show the neighborhoods as a place of immense struggling.
I:27389;1374;"Whatever the case, this movie delivers, and surprisingly does so on an emotional level as well
I:27389;1375;Overall, 8 Mile is a good movie that shows a struggle to make it out of an undesirable environment.
I:27389;1376;The special features are interesting as well.
I:27389;1377;I enjoyed music and young Eminem so much.
I:27389;1378;still you could have a wonderful experience with sort of Bildungsroman.
I:27389;1379;He won awards for this?
I:27389;1380;Very inspiring and close to true life story of Eminem.
I:27389;1381;Great acting performances and plot.
I:27389;1382;soundtrack is also very good.
I:27389;1383;A perfect underdog story .
I:27389;1384;8 Mile was a great movie!!!!
I:27389;1385;Eminem is a BEAUTIFUL actor and gives an excellent performance!
I:27389;1386;The guy is pretty good at all corners of the entertainment table of life.
I:27389;1387;The cast and filming this film create a farely real enviroment for the characters.
I:27389;1388;This film will still amaze them.
I:27389;1389;But I decided to give it a shot, and was very surprised at how good this movie is.
I:27389;1390;Eminem gives an entirely convicing portrayal of Rabbit, and the movie also conveys his desperate situation expertly.
I:27389;1391;"As many people have already said in their positive reviews, ""8 Mile"" is really a surprisingly good film, both gritty and truthful."
I:27389;1392;The film is a gentler and softer version of his real life, but thanks to the sure hand of director Curtis Hanson (LA Confidential fame), the total result is more than satisfactory.
I:27389;1393;And yes, though basically 'as himself', he can act pretty good.'
I:27389;1394;The final scenes, even for the audiences like me who don't know much about rap music, are very exciting and rousing.
I:27389;1395;the film has very authentic atmosphere of Detroit, and does not fail to reflect the social background of the characters.
I:27389;1396;But as I said, we should watch this one as a story with universal appeal.
I:27389;1397;"Because ""8 Mile"" has vast power to make you understand why he is so popular among his fans."
I:27389;1398;If you are an Eminem fan like me I recommend you check this out.
I:27389;1399;It in the movie it shows him making the songs Lose Yourself and 8 Mile both on the soundtrack which you should also get.
I:27389;1400;It seems that a few rap stars have a movie made about their life and it was about time Eminem did.
I:27389;1401;The movie certainly earns an M15+ for all the language and sex scenes but its entertaining showing them burn down houses and stuff.
I:27389;1402;It has a lot of great stuff and of course rap battles.
I:27389;1403;It has established actors with a terrific director, and the big bonus is that the rapper himself can actually act.
I:27389;1404;eminem proves to the whole world that he isn't a one dimensional celebrity and can hold his own with the best of them (i. e. Kim Basinger).
I:27389;1405;This isn't unprecedented with the likes of Madonna making the switch, but it's always intriguing and quite surprising when a rapper can make the transition so easily and smoothly.
I:27389;1406;there are some Hollywoodish qualities in the movie, and that just makes it interesting.
I:27389;1407;That's the mark of good directing and even more important, terrific acting.
I:27389;1408;I remember seeing this movie for the first time.
I:27389;1409;Oh how times move fast.
I:27389;1410;i remember seeing this movie twice.
I:27389;1411;The theater was packed, but we both enjoyed the film.
I:27389;1412;well, it was really an unscheduled event.
I:27389;1413;A friend of mine (who happens to be a girl) wanted to watch it.
I:27389;1414;She begged me to take her, so I gave in and decided to take her along.
I:27389;1415;We were also to see it with a friend, but she dropped out at the last minute.
I:27389;1416;Since then, this movie always reminds me of that.
I:27389;1417;but we still ended up having fun.
I:27389;1418;"The story, as everyone knows, is a ""semi."
I:27389;1419;"He's got friends to provide some guidance (okay, maybe just ""Future,"" played by Mekhi Phifer)."
I:27389;1420;winning gang, the Free World.
I:27389;1421;jimmy also has a mother (Kim Basinger) and a lil' sister.
I:27389;1422;"B. Rabbit also has a little ""love interest,"" though it's probably not called that."
I:27389;1423;A young woman, played by Brittany Murphy, also shares the dream of leaving Detroit.
I:27389;1424;He pulls off a real performance.
I:27389;1425;He shows his true self.
I:27389;1426;Because, my friend, that's the movie's main message.
I:27389;1427;8 Mile is still an entertaining movie.
I:27389;1428;It arrived at a great time in great condition and me being an Eminem fan , absolutely loved it.
I:27389;1429;It is a remarkable story of a young white man in Michigan who becomes a rapping sensation.Yes it is the story of Eminem and you will love it if you want to see an inspirational/ motivational movie.
I:27389;1430;"i am grateful that Em went the ""Extra Mile"" as a rapper to produce this masterpiece production."
I:27389;1431;This is an absolutely amazing film from start to finish.
I:27389;1432;It's directed and acted perfectly.
I:27389;1433;It's also very well acted and directed.
I:27389;1434;It also has a great message and is very uplifting and powerful.
I:27389;1435;Eminem's surfacing musicality and the heartfelt.
I:27389;1436;looking trailers for the film should make for a well.
I:27389;1437;I'm a product of the Dazed and Confuzed 70's, and I was comfortable with that, and it's easier to be comfortable than to take a chance on a stereotyped form of self.
I:27389;1438;It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it.
I:27389;1439;How much you can take, and keep moving forward.
I:27389;1440;That's how winning is done.
I:27389;1441;but the message articulated by 8 Mile is still the same.
I:27389;1442;right on Target, keep moving forward.
I:27389;1443;What a sad choice she made taking this part, but as actresses age, well, you sometimes have to take what you can get .
I:27389;1444;"that is, obsequious and fawning beyond all measure, because you know, he's M&M""."
I:27389;1445;I give it 2 stars for interesting cinematography and that's it.
I:27389;1446;This came in perfect condition early.
I:27389;1447;This is my favorite movie, and a must.
I:27389;1448;I saw this movie at a friends house, she had bought the movie that day.
I:27389;1449;And we watched it and I actually loved it!!
I:27389;1450;The story is good and Em just makes it seem to come naturally.
I:27389;1451;Truthfully this movie keeps it real.
I:27389;1452;You just get the feeling in the end that there is hope.
I:27389;1453;It's good to see poverty on the big screen.
I:27389;1454;"It's good for suburban vouyers to see what goes on in the ""other"" part of town, the places they don't stop to ask directions or don't care about politically."
I:27389;1455;BUT, you see, THAT's why the message of this movie is uplifting in a twisted way.
I:27389;1456;It's a cry for the world that often ignores you to actually UNDERSTAND you.
I:27389;1457;happy news), pay attention to the movie.
I:27389;1458;"The ""rap battles"" that Rabbit and his friends enjoy performing in or watching REPLACES THE VIOLENCE."
I:27389;1459;"Well, rapping, or at least the ""battle,"" is simply a more creative, more complicated way of having fun, venting frustration, and, at the same time, tapping into the inner poet or lyricist inside."
I:27389;1460;Watch the movie with that in mind and just FORGET that it happens to be Eminem, and you might see through all the hype that surrounds this young talent.
I:27389;1461;craved women and sports cars.
I:27389;1462;Eminem did a great job at playing Rabbit.
I:27389;1463;His acting is great, he needs to do some more movies.
I:27389;1464;Not a movie for kids, but overall a good watch.
I:27389;1465;until this film he was an unknown, but respected within his group as good.
I:27389;1466;That is obviously the way life works here.
I:27389;1467;Its not so much a feature film as a semi fictional documentary to give you some insight, some fun and some shocks.
I:27389;1468;Its certainly enjoyable whether a fan of Eminem or not, in fact the only song from the soundtrack that seems to appear in the film is the title track.
I:27389;1469;But while I thought about this I think I concluded that its good it finished like that.
I:27389;1470;This is the first time I was able to understand the meaning of Rap.
I:27389;1471;And the challenge of facing your enemy and without physical malice tear him apart with words.
I:27389;1472;well, Em has brought me into the world of another dimension with his thumping, swaying, gesturing, it all worked and the camera was in love with him and he with the camera.
I:27389;1473;It was natural and moved at a reliable pace.
I:27389;1474;The music was mesmerizing and I found myself in an almost trance.
I:27389;1475;like state when Em was on stage with his arm extended and his body swaying to the beat, a great scene.
I:27389;1476;M&M was pretty good as an actor, not great, not horrible.
I:27389;1477;Well, Eminem shows he's a great actor and the movie is very good.
I:27389;1478;It takes the whole movie for him to win the ultimate battle (a very exciting scene).
I:27389;1479;The extras are great too!
I:27389;1480;Superman Music Video: This is one of the best extras.
I:27389;1481;This video clip will never be on TV because it is really explicit, but it is one of Eminem's best video clips ever.
I:27389;1482;Exciting!The movie is rated R because of strong language (those words, you know.
I:27389;1483;if you are a hip.
I:27389;1484;It's a very fine movie, NOT an Eminem.
I:27389;1485;eminem plays B. rabbit,a man who lives in a dream world full of beats and hip hop rhymes.
I:27389;1486;with up's and downs along the way this film has a great ending putting Eminem the champion of the Shelter,a local hip hop spot where they compete against one another.
I:27389;1487;this film has a very good supporting cast in Kim Bassinger and Mekhi Pheifer.
I:27389;1488;i give Eminem two thumbs up in his surprising role.
