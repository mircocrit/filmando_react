1;It is Ghibli, after all, and they're usually pretty exceptional.
2;There's a lot of adult references and remarks.
3;All that stuff you see in adventure anime.
4;This film kind of reminded me of a cross between the story of Beauty and the Beast and Casablanca.
5;Porco himself is something of an anti.
6;hero, but the film treats him with respect, and in the end, he.
7;If the answer is yes, then this film should be fine for them as well.
8;still, Casablanca was one of the greatest classic films of all time, so the very fact that I'm comparing Porco Rosso with it repeatedly is probably a sign of something good.
9;I just know I loved this movie, and I hope you will too.
10;Porco Rosso is one of this movies that makes you feel nice so you wanna see it over and over, his characters seem to be alive because they act in a very natural way, never overact as every other animated cartoons, the backgrounds are beautiful and refreshing, perfect stageing, perfect story, very funny and emotional, the right word in spanish is EDIFICANTE.
11;This was an awesome Miyazaki film.
12;It was racy, adventurous and fully entertaining for the very young to the very old.
13;The ending is fun (won't spoil it) and does more work than a lot of Miyazaki endings.
14;Among the Miyazaki films, Porco Rosso always stands out among the rest to me withs it's whimsical use of henchmen bumbling, a touching love story and it's Devil May care use of plane knowledge.
15;This is just a great story told well and by a master storyteller.
16;The animation is fantastic, the visuals are superb and this movie has some of the most evicative music I have heard in a long time.
17;"Lots of other people have commented
18;Hayao Miyazaki is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and each of his films is special.
19;Lighthearted, with Miyazaki's signature """"no bad guy"""" roster of interesting characters(including a strong young female, another Miyazaki staple), a fun film for anyone of any age."""
20;This story was one of the first Miyazaki Films i had seen and from there i was hooked.
21;There are times where one might feel a little confused but the beauty of Hayao Miyazaki is that there really are stories within stories.
22;His innovative airplane designs are fantastic and the art is just wonderful.
23;it feels like a classic movie but with Miyazaki's imaginitive story and characters.
24;The music is fantastic, I listen to the soundtrack over and over.
25;The story is bittersweet, subtle, poignant, and fills you with nostalgia and longing.
26;It never hits you over the head with any kind of explanations or messages.
27;and that's the beauty of this film.
28;I was turned onto `Porco Rosso' by some cinephille friends who raved it as one of the best animated works of all time.
29;Last night I finally decided to give it a go, and I must say I was surprised and yet wholly rewarded for my efforts.
30;i expected something darker, maybe more straightforward and impactful and yet what I got packed a serious punch thanks to its restraint and subtle use of influence.
31;This fantasy adventure is a beautiful watch, a film that moves organically and will touch your heart and feed your need for action (the action scenes are marvelous) and adventure.
32;I won't go into a Miyazaki fan boy rant, so I'll just say two thumbs up!
33;In many ways, it's a romance of sorts, though filled with some rather intense action scenes, usually involving sky high gun fights.
34;But it's when Curtis goes after Porco's love interest that he really begins to take things personal, and so the battle intensifies.
35;This was a surprising twist, and the fight, truthfully, is hilarious.
36;this is one of the those movies that can't be judged until it's seen.
37;And, the new format for what is obviously a Miyazaki film is refreshing.
38;Though not the best of Miyazaki's films, it ranks well with other anime films and, if not for Studio Ghibli's constant stream of masterpieces, Porco Rosso would be a legendary anime.
39;Plus, Disney applied their considerable weight and got some top voices for this movie, including Michael Keaton.
40;I started with Spirited Away and got hooked immediately with these type of movies.
41;i love all the studio ghibli films.
42;this one is a really great one about a pilot who turned in to a pig.
43;i love michael keaton as the voice of porco.
44;brand vocal stars will get us into theaters.
45;The themes are mostly adult, and there are situations of threat, suspense, lots of gunfire, and slapstick violence.
46;It's a very sweet story and like all of Miyazaki's works, it is so wonderfully done!
47;Nowhere is there a altruistically nice likable main character.
48;Instead, this film's charm comes from it's down to earth, straightforward linear tale of air fighting and love in the Mediterranean.
49;The flashback scene is gorgeous and is pure Miyazaki.
50;Instead we are treated to a nice fantasy/slice of life tale that dabbles in the fantastic.
51;I have read others complain about the ending but I personally found it refreshing.
52;Overall, I enjoyed this film and imagine young viewers will like the action and comedy while adults will enjoy the more serious themes about life and love.
53;Hayao Miyazaki has many hobbies, and these show up in the long list of themes in his movies.
54;his movies almost always have a strong female lead.
55;He loves machines, especially airplanes and the entire field of aviation.
56;He loves bizarre and cute creatures, and likes to include tough old men (like himself) as the mentor or teacher.
57;He made a movie he wanted to see.
58;Yet, because it's such a good story, and the feelings involved are all good ones, all ages love this movie.
59;masters (Cat Returns, Nausicaa, Porco) all are a great addition for family, Ghibli fans, or anyone who like animation and great stories.
60;All of these are beautifully done, so much so that you may just want to visit the ocean.
61;Once there, he meets old man Piccolo's gorgeous granddaughter Fio.
62;He has such detail, from the middle of the ocean, to Milan, everything is crisp and well colored.
63;They show up beautifully on this version, and Disney really out did themselves with such a good transfer.
64;The sound is great, another one with a grand score.
65;If you have surround sound this one is probably the best for effects, plus the orchestral score just pops out, making the flight scenes as moving as the romantic ones.
66;This is informative and funny, and if you are a Ghibli fan, this is sure to please.
67;This is my favorite Studio Ghibli movie.
68;Great characters, setting and SEAPLANE FIGHTS!
69;I appreciated the clarity and authenticity of the political atmosphere, the masculinity of Porco and his relationship with the girl.
70;The movie has solid production, but I often found myself wondering where it was going.
71;heroes in movies need to grow.
72;He is who is is, he's surprised a bit by the young girl's talent, and there's little else.
73;There is a definite journey with trials that lead to a wiser and richer character.
74;This is another of Miyazaki's fabulous animated films.
75;and every one of his master works.
76;esteem of young girls everywhere through role models in his characters.
77;Never has there been a more tireless champion of the ability, strength, and courage of women.
78;But as it turns out, his work is brilliant.
79;Yep,great movie,worth adding to any collection for any collector who is into Japanese style artwork and detail.
80;personally I like the detail in these,so do collect them.
81;But the adventure was great.
82;I bought it for my 6 yearold, she enjoyed it alot.
83;Fine story and a very good characterizations.
84;Extraordinary for the details and precision of the drawings, particularly the aircraft details and the battle scenes.
85;and, of course, the beauty of Miyazaki art.
86;Surely he did a lot of historical and technical researches.
87;What you see is pretty much it.
88;All in all, a great film.
89;Discs were in great shape as advertised, case has seen better days and might not be the original, but I have plenty of extra double cases so it was perfect!
90;I have to admit this is a very good dub, and seeing it, I realized I'd missed a few subtle details.
91;"He gave just the right kind of understated, ""man of few words"" talk that was expected from his character."
92;The animation is first rate all the way, and the art is extraordinary, as we've come to expect from recent Miyazaki films.
93;I personally like the effect, as it gives the characters some dimension.
94;By fading the background a bit and making it more realistic, it brings more life to the characters, and movement of objects.
95;as for the movie, itself it has a good story that on the surface excites the younger audience, and on a bit deeper level gives the adults something to enjoy.
96;Most of that commentary will go right over younger children, who will love Porco and his adventures.
97;Miyazaki seems to have a love for children.
98;If Disney spent a little on promotion, this kind of film plays well for American audiences.
99;Porco Rosso however, is set in the Adriatic Sea, and has many universal adventure concepts, like pirates, spies, airplanes, and hide.
100;The transfer looks great, and while I don't have a THX system to try it, its THX certified and includes a THX Optimizer.
101;It's also specially enhanced for 16X9 televisions.
102;Perhaps a bit too cerebral for kids who like Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service, it's still a sweet introspective story.
103;as usual Miyazaki's designs are wonderful to watch as is his choreography of flight scenes.
104;I think personally that a film which gives the viewer a little nudge in the direction of the fate of the characters but leaves the imagination to flesh it out is a good film.
105;True, its a slight departure from his normal situations and stories but the same basic threads shine through regardless.
106;Excellent animation, beautiful watercolour backgrounds, appealing characters and a plot that doesnt get predictable or feel like its being worked from a template.
107;Hisaishi also does a cracking music score as usual.
108;have watched a couple of times and the wit of this movie stands out .
109;It is a comedy and an adventure yarn, with a bit of romance thrown into the mix.
110;And yes, pigs do fly.
111;"The artwork is vivid with color, the score is fun
112;there are not stars enough to indicate just how excellent this movie is.
113;Even if someone isn't, this is still a great movie.
114;But when I actually saw it, for some strange reason I found it one of the more charming Miyazaki movies!
115;Maybe it's because Porco Rosso's former girlfriend looks and acts like a starlet from those 1940's movies I love to watch.
116;But this definitely isn't a weak attempt at levity by Miyazaki.
117;And when he meets a young girl who's a talented engineer, that secret will be revealed.
118;this movie shows Miyazaki's love of all mechanical things that fly, and also his love of creative fantasy.
119;Ghibli movies are generally considered good movies that can be enjoyed by the whole family and I agree.
120;And its a big one.
121;It is also something of a personal project.
122;He has always loved airplanes and this film was a way including it in one of his works.
123;If you liked or loved any or all of Miyazaki san's films then get this one.
124;so, do I recommend this movie?
125;Well, I suggest that all fans of Miyazaki's work see this at least once since it's his.
126;I was skeptical when I bought it, but I am a huge Miyazaki fan, so I thought I'd give it a chance.
127;some really great animation sequences, and some truly funny lines.
128;The idea of an animated feature about a pig flying an aeroplane sounded a little silly, but I actually found """"Porco Rosso"""" pretty enjoyable."""
129;Even though it's a little tetchy and in need of a tune up, his red aircraft is beautiful and suits him very nicely.
130;"Though it isn't as colourful and strange as, say, ""Spirited Away"", it is a beautiful looking film, and has Miyazaki's signature style all over it."
131;pilot, but makes him likeable and friendly too.
132;"it's good for what it is, light entertainment, and worth a look for anime fans, but if you're just getting into Hayao Miyazaki, I'd recommended seeing a film like ""Spirited Away"" or ""Castle of Cagliostro"" first."
133;"as to the film itself, I love it
134;This somewhat quirky action/adventure story is a blast for any fan of the genre, but it's the aviation angle that grabs me in this one.
135;perfect to me, and explains why it's a personal high scorer on my own top ten list.
136;I thought Michael Keaton did a fine job as Porco, from what I've read here I was expecting more of an over.
137;top vocalization like he did in 'Beetlejuice.'
138;Yet, in the film's more emotional moments I found Ms. Egan's Gina just as warm and intimate as Ms. Kato's ever was, sometimes even more so.
139;Your mileage may vary!Cary Elwes was a hoot as Donald Curtis, with his mildly goofy Texas accent, and Kimberly Williams gave a great performance as Fio, sounding just as cute and spunky as did the original Japanese actress, Akemi Okamura.
140;top marks for David Ogden Stiers' take on Grandpa Piccolo in this release.
141;He gets better every time with these projects"
142;As impressed as I was with his characterization of Kamaji in 'Spirited Away,' he blew me away with his wonderfully hilarious voice acting here!To sum up, for me Disney has taken one of my favorite films of all time and made it even more enjoyable with their version.
143;c'mon, Disney, you can do it!
144;All the Ghibli anime films are very well made.
145;It is enjoyable, but not one you are going to watch repeatedly.
146;Other than that, well done.
147;In general, the Miyazaki films are fantastical and with an environmental message while the Takahata films are more realistic.
148;If you have watched other Miyazaki films then you know that he loves the sky and has set entire civilizations in the sky.
149;The story itself is straight forwardly told, although truth be told, the film is light on story and dwells on beautiful aerial shots.
150;This is my favorite Ghibli film and my second favorite Miyazaki film next to Cagliostro.
151;Porco Rosso is a rare gem of a movie.
152;While not my favorite Myazaki movie, it's a great film and a wonderful piece of art.
153;one of the problems is that the film is a jarring combination of gorgeously animated flight scenes, slapstick comedy, romance, and an underdeveloped fascism allegory reminiscent of George Orwell.
154;Fio in many ways is like some of the great Miyazaki heroines such as Nausicaa and Kiki.
155;She's smart, skilled, adventurous, and good.
156;so what's to recommend about this movie?
157;Your enjoyment of Porco Rosso will largely hinge upon whether or not you like watching flying scenes and aerial battles.
158;"Flight has always been an important theme in Hayao Miyazaki's films, but ""Porco Rosso"" is undoubtedly his purest, most unabashed love letter to airplanes and flying."
159;"Accompanied by Joe Hisashi's majestic score, the flying scenes where the characters are simply gliding through the air are absolutely wonderful and recall some of the most exhilarating moments in other Ghibli films like ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Castle in the Sky."""
160;The tone and imagery of this scene is so moving and profound that it feels out of place sandwiched between the lightweight, inconsequential story that we'd been watching so far.
161;This is a great movie out of the house of Miyazaki.
162;some of the best animated aviation scenes I have ever watched,just loved all of the movie and the music as well, my favorite 'Animae' cartoon movie.
163;The movie has a great plot and great classic animation taht works with the movie.
164;Miyazaki has a gift for creating an alternate world that is consistent in its own rules.
165;But now having experienced several of Miyazaki's works, I think that they are so successful because they extol good and honest behavior.
166;"after ""Spirited Away"" I have sought out all Miyazaki's films."
167;they are fun, they aren't predictable, they speak to all ages and they don't leave you embarrassed to have spent money on the entertainment.
168;as the father of several daughters, call me corny, but I enjoyed and appreciated the character of the young engineer (Piccolo's granddaughter) who was anxious to prove herself.
169;She worked hard and validated everyone's confidence in her talents.
170;Hardwork and achievement: What a great message that is so often lost in Hollywood's clumsy offerings.
171;the movie was so enjoyable because it honored good character.
172;So often such movies are so predicable that you end up rooting for the bad guy, but in Miyazaki's movies the themes of love, honor, honesty are all given excellent treatment and I cannot recommend them enough.
173;This movie works on two levels.
174;You can enjoy it as standard family friendly adventure fair or you can ponder some of the subtler themes and exactly what the humanoid pig thing is actually all about.
175;As with every Ghibli movie I can think of, there are some great flying scenes .
176;Unlike some of Disney's other Ghibli dubs, I really like the voice acting on this one.
177;Everything came out pretty well.
178;The case looked good and it came in a timely fashion.
179;It is a really great one, and the Disney voice acting works well.
180;All the humor, heart, and action in this movie keep on making me Miyazaki's number one fan!
181;Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle, and Porco Rosso are my top favorites!
182;Anime fans should definitely watch these titles whenever they can.
183;Another great film by Miyazaki.
184;lots of attention to detail and great voice actors too!
185;"One of director Hayao Miyazaki's (""Spirited Away"", ""Princess Mononoke"") earlier works is a film called ""Porco Rosso""."
186;He works for money and usually to protect others (still for pay, not out of any generosity of spirit as he claims he has none).
187;I was surprised by just how much humor there is in the movie.
188;This is just a good movie.
189;"It joins ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" as my favorites Miyazaki movies and is one I happily recommend."
190;all I have to say is I was shocked.
191;I actually liked this movie.
192;"Not just a ""its okay"" kind of liked, but a ""wow that was amazing"" like."
193;The animation was amazing and the voice acting was better than any other Miyazaki English dub with the exception of Spirited Away.
194;But what really made this movie great was the fact that it's really, REALLY funny.
195;Even parts that I would normally consider corny, like when Fio is talking to the air pirates about how great they supposedly are, are saved by the fact that they aren't taken seriously, they are made fun of.
196;Its one of the funniest things you'll ever see.
197;I enjoyed the movie not just as a beautifully animated feature, but a wonderful story that could be retold as an Oscar.
198;worthy live action feature film.
199;I would highly recommend this to fans of Studio Ghibli, Bogart classics, romance, action, and suspense.
200;Alternately known as THE CRIMSON PIG, this gorgeously animated yet oddly themed tale about a tormented pilot transformed into a pig was the highest grossing movie of its year (1992).
201;, the overall movie is more rooted in reality.
202;When concentrating on character development and breathtaking flight sequences in the sky, PORCO ROSSO is at its best.
203;By the time the credits rolled, I was of two minds.
204;this was a pretty, well, strange movie, but still good.
205;(Though I still give the movie my highest recommendation.)
206;That said, I now have a huge amount of respect for PORCO ROSSO.
207;The visual transfer is crisp, clean and vibrant, showcasing the beautiful skies and oceans when our hero is in flight.
208;Purists will be happy to know that the Japanese language track is included, as well as the French language dub featuring Jean Reno as the title character.
209;michael Keaton is an excellent Porco Rosso.
210;the rest of the cast is equally well matched.
211;She also has a great singing voice.
212;for continuity's sake, Disney had Egan redub Gina's siren song, and boy, is it beautiful.
213;(He also speaks with a surprisingly convincing Southern accent.)
214;Although the banter between his pirate gang isn't as memorable as, say, Phil Hartman's Jiji from KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE, or even the guys who played the Dola Pirate Gang from CASTLE IN THE SKY, the chemistry between this bunch of thugs is undeniably funny.
215;David Ogden Stiers hams it up as Grandpa Piccolo, employing a thick Italian accent, which actually makes his character all the more amusing.
216;She does an absolutely bang.
217;"All in all, I ended up enjoying the dub more than I thought
218;additional features include a Behind.
219;microphone featurette (which I always like watching"
220;One noteworthy extra is a 3.
221;A longtime colleague of Miyazaki, Suzuki shares his wisdom about this gifted, imaginative animator, and it's a pleasure to hear him talk about this film's assets.
222;rate treatment of Miyazaki's titles with this nicely put together package of what is probably his oddest movie yet.
223;This movie is pretty popular, but I can't understand why.
224;animation: 4/5 This was definitely the movie's strongest aspect.
225;The movie is filled with lots of aerial action, and the plot is well, typical of Miyazaki: subtle and engaging.
226;The evolution of Marco's character is bittersweet and a delight to watch.
227;If you like the other movies by Miyazaki, you will like this one as well.
228;It's up to the same level as most other Miyazaki films.
229;I am ashamed of myself for judging the anime by its cover because this film has some of the most beautiful animation I've ever seen.
230;one of the biggest influences for Miyazaki creating this film was his love and obsession for planes.
231;He finds a young girl there that is an amazing designer and she makes Porco a plane even better than what he had.
232;The two become partener and the rest is history.
233;porco tries to play the hard bounty hunter but he still gets love and respect let it be from a group of schoolgirls he saved to a young woman who always worries about his safety.
234;He uses his big pig head a lot but he also has a bigger heart that he puts to even more use.
235;I'm a huge fan of this studio's work.
236;The animation is awesome in this feature.
237;the original English version was masterful.
238;The story is for romantic adults but is also safe and entertaining for children.
239;It is a story of complex, adult friendships and love.
240;It has an air of 'Casablanca' to it.
241;the animation is beautiful, and is a treat for aviation buffs dreaming of the barnstorming days.
242;the original music score is good and sets the right 'atmosphere' for the film.
243;The opening scene of Porco Rosso shows that the year is 1929, a decade after the First World War.
244;In Germany the Nazi's were gaining strength while planning their conquest of Germany and later Europe with the possibility of the world.
245;between the two World Wars, but his film also turns into a political allegory for the that time.
246;miyazaki does a marvelous job in his creation of the character Porco who portrays dispositions such as selfishness, cynicism, and gloom through a pig without hope of being something better.
247;The film noir that Porco Rosso offers also augments the cinematic value of the story, as it authentically depicts the time period.
248;in the middle of this an American pilot, Donald Curtis, arrives to claim fame and secure a spot in Hollywood, and maybe later the Presidency.
249;hayao Miyazaki's Porco Rosso is a fantastic animated journey that also makes a strong political statement.
250;The film entertains young and old, but also leaves a lot for the audience to ponder while the magnificent animation transcends into the mind through vibrant colors and detailed lines.
251;The story also keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat, as nail.
252;biting suspense leaves the audience guessing what will happen next.
253;Ultimately, this cinematic masterpiece leaves the audience with a fulfilling experience that offers something for everyone.
254;This is now one of my favorite Studio Ghibli films.
255;i enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice in a row and then again with my boyfriend.
256;(I NEVER DO THAT) I warmed my heart and made me laugh so much.
257;I would have to say this is just another piece of Hayao Miyazakis great work, and it's interesting seing this story from the main charector being a pig, from how he made Spirited Away look with those pigs.
258;i'm sure you will like this movie, and knowing, Hayao Miyazaki never lets you down when it comes to great movies.
259;Yet, it is a joy to view this film with my daughter.
260;We both greatly enjoy the fun, and loving story.
261;the animation and storytelling are strong points for Porco Rosso.
262;The first disc contains the film and most of the special features.
263;It's a decent documentary for what it is.
264;This feature runs for about eight minutes, and it has Japanese audio with some English subtitles.
265;I was intrigued because one source said that Miyazaki named Studio Ghibli after the Italian plane which appears in this movie, so I bought it.
266;The movie proved to be classic Miyazaki: one enters the story seemingly in the middle, there is a level of humor, danger, fantasy and mystery, and true loss.
267;the animation is incredibly rich with the usual attention to detail, and colors remain vivid.
268;The movie is lively and funny, but the flashbacks are emotionally powerful.
269;not as well known as Howl's Moving Castle , Spirited Away and Whispers of the Heart , Porco Rosso is worthy of being included with those movies.
270;Any fan of Miyazaki's work will enjoy this movie.
271;I got this for my son as he requested it for Christmas.
272;We watched it with him and it was good.
273;This is definitely a great movie for young adults and kids.
274;My little brother loves it, but you can't expect less from Studio Ghibli.
275;the movie porco rosso is a great story about a WWI flying ace who after the war became a bountyhunter.
276;the story is more than that though, its filled with romance, actcion,and comedy.
277;all of this is based in a whimsical world that could only be imagined by the great director hayao miyazaki, one of the greatest film makers of our time.
278;this is a really great movie and a must see for the young and young at heart.
279;Porco rosso, a good movie,,interesting and fun.
280;I liked it and would recommend for family viewing.
281;It pays off in a tone that is considerably more adult than anything Miyazaki has done before or since .
282;regardless of the slapstick air pirate sequences.
283;death experience during the war is one of the best scenes ever animated.
284;That would be worth seeing.)
285;top outrageousness of the Japanese version.
286;I must say that this is not my favorite Miyazaki film but it definitely caught my interest and my imagination still, as this great director always does.
287;I would not say Porco Rosso should be your first Miyazaki experience, but it's definitely one that I'm proud to have in my collection.
288;Anyone who loves anime movies will like this!
289;It's got a good story and very comical @ times.
290;If you've watched any other movies by Hayao Miyazaki, you'll love this one.
291;It's one of my favorite movies!
292;The disc and box came in great condition.
293;This is quite a wonderful film!
294;Porco Rosso is a stunning masterpiece.
295;From a visual point of view, it is full of beautiful scenery, partially due to where the story takes place.
296;It is the story of a World War I pilot who is somehow transformed into the Crimson Pig.
297;, of Miyazaki, well, I think you will love this.
298;'Porco Rosso' is a marvel.
299;It's a very funny movie, a thrilling adventure, and it is so visually beautiful that it's painful.
300;The setting in late Twenties Italy and the Adriatic is particularly interesting as we live in Italy.
301;The females in the film are great, starting with the opening sequence in which a group of irrepressible little girls on a class outing are kidnapped for ransom by the unfortunate pirates.
302;One comes away from Miyazaki's films feeling better about being a woman, and more hopeful for the future of one's daughter.
303;this film gets my highest recommendation.
304;My favorite Ghibli film by far, Porco Rosso is unique among the other works by the studio in achieving the same sense of magic and wonderment while being set firmly in the real world.
305;"the ones that say something like ""this is a hero who can triumph over anything."
306;Porco's past is revealed, almost seductively, over the entire film.
307;this is a love story that does not directly deal with love.
308;It lets love happen as the characters live their life.
309;Think Casablanca but funnier, more action, great fight scenes, and Miyazaki's beautiful clouds and sunlit skies.
310;In spite of my love and respect for Kiki and Totoro, I am almost now convinced that is is Hiyao's finest work, surpassing even Nausicaa!If you have never seen one of his films, see this one.
311;It is astounding in so many ways, and it may make you want to see more of his amazing creations.
312;They movie was beautiful to watch.
313;Excellent artistry and great story.
314;I never watch these movies with the English soundtrack.
315;I prefere the Japanese with English subtitles so I can't comment on the other.
316;There is so much to look at when watching Miyazaki's movies.
317;Lots of cool planes and characters.
318;Great movie for Studio Ghibli fans.
319;It's easy and carefree to watch.
320;A nice story and a happy ending.
321;I am a fanatic for the works of Miyazaki, and this is my favorite among his works.
322;hearted fight scenes, strong female figures, comic villains, romance, great achievements, a touch of magic, and the typically fanatical Miyazaki attention to detail.
323;This is an atypical light adventure film and is suitable for children from 9 to 99.
324;It's charming, fun, and simply wonderful.
325;This movie, in cartoon form, is one of my favorites.
326;It is very entertaining,humorous,love story, yet also provides a little history lesson of aviation conditions in Italy leading into World War II.
327;This is not just a delightful animated film, it is a spectacular film of any genre that fits on the same shelf with Casablanca, Shane, and other wonderful films about how lonely it is to be a wandering hero.
328;There is something special about this film .
329;it is at once exciting and thrilling, and at the same time peaceful, a kind of oasis.
330;That Miyazaki can capture this feeling and transplant it to an entirely unique setting, with resonances from his own life and experience, and tied to an even grander global scale shows once again why he is among the most remarkable, interesting and versatile of filmmakers we have (period).
331;This film is great and I usually don't like the American voice actors.
332;What a great little show with humor, drama and mystery.
333;Just a cartoon movie, right?
334;a fable with some pretty deep psychological implications, but something kids can get at their level.
335;The art work is gorgeous.
336;The characters are both moving and hilarious.
337;Deserves to be far better known.
338;This is one of the best animated films of all time.
339;this is Miyazaki's most polished, flawless work.
340;He's completely unique, and watching him interact with everyone around him is truly remarkable.
341;The supporting cast is firmly archetypical, but we can forgive him for that.
342;the story is simple, but flawless.
343;The tension arc throught the film is wonderfully well thought out.
344;It starts on a high note, slightly silly, then settles into a stylish, melancholy and surreal vibe that lasts for a good half of the film.
345;The ending itself is wonderfully melancholy, resolving (some of) the plot yet leaving the tension hanging in the air.
346;The only other Miyazaki feature that has this flawless a story.
347;The historical setting provides a necessary realistic contrast to the deeply romaticised characters and events in the movie, and adds a degree of unsettling tension to the atmosphere.
348;The detail in every frame is stunning, and the emotion and nuance in character expression is second to none.
349;The movie was technically far ahead of it's time, and still looks fresh today, despite competition from CGI.
350;The soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi is wonderful as always, and Gina's beautiful ballad is a melodic centerpiece of the film.
351;It is dynamic and engaging while being wonderfully subtle and nuanced.
352;It is simple, yet never simplified.
353;And it's charming as all hell.
354;Porco's story (you'll have to see the film to know what I'm talking about) is a stunning, surreal, typical Miyazaki moment, and is one of the most powerful scenes in all of cinema (I'm not kidding).
355;so, are you going to enjoy this movie?
356;Animation allows us to express what conventional live.
357;this is one of the best animated films of all time.
358;p. s. Howl's Moving Castle is worth the wait.
359;If you like the more surreal direction in which Miyazaki was going in Spirited Away, well, he goes further in that direction.
360;In general, it's a good idea to watch any foreign movie in it's original language.
361;First of all, the movie is set in Italy and nobody speaks with an Italian accent.
362;The animation is brilliant like in all of Miyazaki's films but I had trouble with the main character, Porco.
363;In all of Miyazaki's other films you really feel drawn to the main character and want to see them succeed.
364;He shows so little emotion.
365;It wraps up with a voice over telling what happens next.
366;This was long held as one of my favorite films (animated or not) and it was another of Miyazaki's films I knew only in subtitled form.
367;Michael Keaton especially has done a great job of capturing the essence of the Japanese performance and helps make the dub very watchable.
368;I was happily surprised by this dub.
369;Breathtaking animation, memorable characters, fun, exciting!
370;Miyazaki has a unique twist that make watching any of his movies a joy.
371;This isn't my favorite, but still very enjoyable.
372;"san:""Porco Rosso"" is the master's most autobiographical work, for once he was not trying to impart any moral or environmental lessons to children or young girls or the Japanese society, as most of his other works did."
373;but a heartfelt fantasy projection of himself (being an independent agent neither belonging to your typical Japanese Anime Industry or the Hollywood/Disney American Culture juggernaut, as symbolized by the brash American Pilot.
374;set in Post WWI Europe, where Fascism was on the rise, the Continental world it captured was a last breath of fantastic and natural freedom before a long darkness set in.
375;the genius stroke here is by turning the protagonist into a PIG, a whimsical yet literal mockery on those old.
376;"male/brotherhood chauvinist melodramatic adventure genre it so lovingly appropriates, and a gentle dig on ""mankind"" in general, all in good and slightly surreal fun."
377;in this story, Miyazaki made fun (instead of preaching to) of his society, himself and his prominent role in it.Yet, behind all the cartoony surface lies the touching elegiac sadness of a lost past and a yearning hope (placed esp.
378;hearted lark only makes its immersing nostalgia and lyricism all the more spontaneously enchantingand unexpectedly affecting.
379;A magical paradox of his great art.
380;"Porco Rosso is the ""Casablanca"" of cartoons with a touch of Roald Dahl, and the most under."
381;rated and overlooked of Miyazaki's fabulous work.
382;This is really a gorgeous movie, like all Studio Ghibli offerings.
383;Having read the reviews and commentary that Miyazaki was aiming at businessmen, I bought this for me .
384;however , my 4 year old daughter loves this movie as much as she loves Kiki's Delivery Service.
385;There is nothing too scary, and there are enough jokes and great flying scenes to not only keep my daughter's attention, but also for her to demand to see it again and again.
386;As a collector of Disney animation and classics, I love the Japanese animation films.
387;Very happy with the product.
388;Filled with brilliant animation and memorable characters, Miyazaki does not fail to bring us anothe masterpiece.
389;this is a great piece of work that everyone from adults to kids can enjoy.
390;There are many lighthearted jokes and plenty of things to quote from.
391;The humor is real, original, and truly funny, unlike the forced nature of most films these days.
392;Even my eleven year old brother and I (i'm fifteen) were in stiches and enjoyed it thoroughly.
393;one of the best parts of this film are the planes Miyazaki so clearly loves.
394;They look and feel authentic and really pull the film together.
395;Also, we are given a great cast of new characters with an EXCELLENT english cast.
396;So don't hesistate and enjoy!
397;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
398;"Miyazaki has the courage, and talent, to take his time telling a story, without trying to ""wow"" you every second of the film."
399;this movie has a subtle grace, beauty, and charm which is truly moving.
400;This is a rare find in any medium.
401;So, it's finally going to happen.
402;While the subtitles are sometimes a bit hasty posted to read, repeated viewings have helped to make this a very enjoyable film.
403;It has also slowly become a sort of cult favorite with us.
404;The ending is particularly poignant.
405;As a guy with a soft spot for genuine romance and a passion for adventures, particularly those involving older aircraft, this film really leaves it's mark.
406;My entire family look forward, eagerly to seeing the new release for American audiences.
407;Miyazaki is a versitile creator, capable of involving many types of storytelling and animation techniques and story pacing to tell a wide variety of stories on film.
408;"They can watch it and probably will enjoy it but this is not ""My Neighbor Totoro"" or ""Kiki's Delivery Service""."
409;Porco Rosso, is a wonderfully gorgeousmovie punctuated throughout with breathtaking views of the not.
410;One of Moriyama's best, featuring first rate animation, story and dialogue.
411;over crowd, but the real audiences for this masterpiece are adults who appreciate beautiful animation, 1930's.
412;style heros, and the sounds of radial aircraft engines.
413;Porco Rosso deserves a top ranking in any movie collection.
414;I liked this film a lot.
415;on first viewing the Disney.
416;Porco's initial negotiations with the engineer are brilliant (English or Japanese), and the portrayals of motion and old mechanical airplanes make the movie intensely visually interesting.
417;i give the Japanese version a 5 and the Disney.
418;Split the difference and call it a 4.
419;Porco Rosso (Hayao Miyazaki, 1992)In between his two monolithic environmentalist efforts, Nausicaa and Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki enjoyed his greatest artistic success as a filmmaker, in my opinion.
420;Not only his best picture, Kiki's Delivery Service, but My Neighbor Totoro and Porco Rosso were also produced during this time.
421;That's a trifecta of which any director could be proud.
422;it's actually quite simple and straightforward for a Miyazaki film, which was something of a surprise.
423;A good old swashbuckling adventure flick about daredevil flyers, honor, and friendship.
424;Apart from the long autoplay Disney commercial that intrudes upon the viewer when you first put the disc in, I must admit that Disney continues to do an excellent job in these releases, providing both the original Japanese version as well as consistently excellent English dubbings.
425;Porco Russo is a highly accomplished bounty hunter, famous for his red airplane and for having mysteriously been transformed into a pig.
426;to be honest, the plot is adequate, but the real joy of the film lies in watching the interaction of the characters onscreen, and at marveling at the superb animation.
427;All the details are simply perfect, from the studied stylishness of Porco Russo's outfits, which seem to have been copied directly from the pages of J. Peterman catalogs, to the specifics of the airplane design.
428;There is also the elegance in the way Miyazaki's characters move and the way he frames each scene using the rhythm and pacing one associates with live action films rather than animation.
429;i suppose very few will experience this as their first venture into the magic that I Miyazaki.
430;If so, as wonderful as this film is, the best is yet to come.
431;You can feel that they makes a great work of research,the places, the things,the people,it's incredible.
432;it's for these reason that i like Miyazaki's works,it's a pleasure relax yourself with amzing tales and fantastic draws!
433;There is something in the French version that the same Hayao Miyazaki thinks to be better than the one in the original version: the french track.
434;As the Great Master Miyazaki himself says, the french actors perform even better than the japanese ones, and more, whose voice is the Great Kurenay no Buta?
435;Marco (or Porco) spends his days fighting against sea pirates and evading capture by the Italian Secret Police, as well as visiting the lovely Gina, owner of the swanky Hotel Adriano.
436;old Fio, a talented and beautiful engineer.
437;The two work together to rebuild Marco's plane into a sleek, sophisticated fighting machine, and an all.
438;Porco Rosso is the first of Miyazaki Hayao's fables aimed squarely at adults rather than children.
439;There is a lot of smoking and alcohol, off.
440;Miyazaki had the chance to spend an entire film dedicated to his love of flying, and the attention to detail of the many planes in the movie is amazing.
441;"I didn't like this as well as other Miyazaki classics like ""Kiki"" and ""Nausicaa,"" but it was an enjoyable romp nonetheless."
442;Any avid fan of anime, historical fiction, and Studio Ghibli films should add this to their collection.
443;"It has great Sea plane/Pirate action sequences, and as always, the classic ""Miyazaki, touch."
444;Wish we would've bought it sooner!We love this middle.
445;several weeks ago I watched the film and was completely entranced.
446;i loved the pig character.
447;I would recommend this film to lovers of Miyazaki films and new fans.
448;I wish I could describe the beauty of this film.
449;Again, I hold ALL of Miyazaki's films close to my heart they have even moved me to be more active in life, relationships, environment, and my community.
450;I hope you guys enjoy Porco Rosso.
451;Thank you for reading my review and have a lovely day!
452;This was so totally new for me, and so wonderful.
453;What a change from Disney: so imaginative, the animations is exquisite, the story is so funny, and un.
454;A film for adults as well as children .
455;it gave me a whole new way to see animation.
456;and share them with my grandchildren.
457;"The animation is beautiful, the English dubbing is perfect and even though the settings are generally ""Old Europe"", the stories are typically oriental in formula."
458;They are fun to watch again and again.
459;While this doesn't quite live up to Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke, it is a little more understated, and in that way a little more quaint and nice.
460;All in all, it's fun movie about flying, romance, and the romance of flying.
461;"Yeah, the guy's a pic and that's ""magical"", but that's about it."
462;I think this film is still better than most American movies.
463;This is yet another brilliant animation from the Ghibli stable.
464;It is one that could be enjoyed by kids as well as adults and the talking pig makes for some amusing scenes.
465;Worth a try if you're fan of Ghibli and Japanese animation.
466;This movie is a great example of a fantastic kids' film that is clever and funny enough to appeal to an adult audience as well.
467;the voice actors all bring great qualities to their roles and it is not distracting.
468;Porco Rosso' is suitable viewing for the kiddies but may be, in general, enjoyed more by an older audience .
469;packed climax, there's plenty of romance, dry humor, and subtle political commentary.
470;Regardless, it has the Ghibli charm, and is likely to have something for almost everyone.
471;and another jewel in the glorious Ghibli crown.
472;It is just as much of a masterpiece as Spirited Away.
473;Porco Rosso is full of humor, cleverly hidden jokes, and sports a very well written story line.
474;It is a pleasure to watch and a movie I would highly recommend to anyone, even those who have never seen a Studio Ghibli film.
475;As my number three favorite movie of all time, I believe the movie is worth every cent and is one of very few movies I could watch in a loop for hours.
476;If you are looking for a great movie to add to your collection, you've found it.
477;It is composed of almost everything he loves and is keen on.
478;gINA WHO SINGS CHANSONGina in this movie is the rare mature adult woman character that sets apart the rest of Miyazaki works.
479;But it is no doubt Gina's presence that gives the movie adult romance flavor something like the movies Humphrey Bogart or Gregory Peck might be starring.
480;(Miyazaki is the huge fan of Katou's chanson singing for sure!)
481;He is the huge fan of Miyazaki's works.
482;recommended for: Every Miyazaki fan who also loves something mechanic and/or classic movie lovers.
483;Love this movie, definitely deserves 5 stars.
484;The story line is original, it has great values, and I enjoy the animation.
485;If you're a Miyazaki fan this is one to add to your collection!
486;that the dub is as good as the original.
487;And I do believe this English 'Porco Rosso' is one of such exceptions.
488;as well as in Japanese with subtitles if you would still like to.
489;arigato Disney for the wonderful job!!
490;I've been a Miyazaki fan since the late 80s, but I just enjoyed Porco Rosso for the first time.
491;Over the years, many reviews have touted this film as one of his best, if not his best.
492;And that's saying a lot.
493;The animation is absolutely magical: mesmerizing and exciting.
494;The magical realisn is right on: think Gabriel Garcia Marquez at his best.
495;The plot and characters are compelling.
496;This film delivers everything the often misused animation medium promises: the creation of a reality at once real and fantastic.
497;This is a great movie.
498;This is a visual tour de force with a highly entertaining story line.
499;Images of seaplanes are exquisitely rendered.
500;Of all the Miyazaki films I've seen, this one is my favorite.
501;hayao Miyazaki is well regarded as one of the best creators of animated film.
502;He is easily my favorite.
503;Of his films, this is my wife's favorite and in my top 5.
504;A couple of characters beat each other up pretty significantly.
505;miyazaki revisits several themes in all of his films.
506;One of the highlights of his films for me is the strong female characters he creates.
507;From young girls to elderly women, and every age in between, there is strength of mind, spirit, will, and character.
508;the characters and environments are crafted with lush care.
509;The details are gorgeous, landscapes rich, and each and every person and animal is deep, and easy to connect with.
510;broad concepts are positive and easy to grasp, but more subtle details keep more mature viewers engaged in the story as well.
511;disney secured the contract to bring Miyazaki's films to the US, and have done a splendid job with the dubbing of this one, as they have with all the rest.
512;Great care is taken to ensure the characters mouths synch with the dialog.
513;this is like a European film done in Japanese animation and I love it.
514;It is witty, has adult level humor (not sexual but things kids wouldn't get), and it allows Hayao Miyazaki to indulge in more facinating aircraft.
515;First class voice talent including Michael Keaton as Marco/Porco, Brad Garrett, Bill Fagerbakke, Kimberly Williams and favorites of other Studio Ghibli/Disney releases .
516;give added depth to the outstanding animation.
517;Since this is targeted at adults and has a European flavor with Japanese production, the film has characters smoking and drinking.
518;the animation was wonderful, the backdrops amazing, the planes cool, the characters fascinating, but .
519;Oh well, the dogfights were fun, and Porco's fist fight with Curtis at the end of the film was mildly amusing.
520;I'd say that he's the best chain.
521;porco Rosso is a visually stunning film.
522;It's entertaining, a little strange, and most definitely undercooked.
523;Porco Rosso is by far my favorite Miyazaki film due to its witty humor and the anti.
524;the music and scores are fambulous as usual since Miyazaki and Hisaishi combined both their expertise together FLAWLESSLY.
525;It is actually enjoyable and believable as opposed to some dubs for other Miyazaki movies.
526;But for me Miyazaki stands out as one of (if not the best) directors of all time for his intense perfectionism that makes his movies so intracitley detailed and fresh, while at the same time retaining an air of nostalgia.
527;Porco Rosso is one such film.
528;Miyazaki takes the sleek Bogart.
529;The result is the bizzare but wonderful story of a humanoid pig who runs from Mussolini's secret police while searching for bounties and the woman he loves.
530;Here we really get the best of both worlds.
531;notch, and the characters are great, but we get some excellent `performances' from the animated characters.
532;This film features the best character animation since Tex Avery's cartoon shorts.
533;The animation is also remarkable during the heart.
534;this is one of the rare films where everything seems to add up perfectly from start to finish, which is rare for a film from any director no matter how great.
535;Totally charming story of romance in the air and on the sea.
536;Mesmerizing characters, and everything beautifully presented.
537;And the airplanes are cool.
538;enough technical tidbits to keep the airplane lover happy.
539;That is, if you can imagine those films in the kind of gorgeous color Miyazaki drenches his scenes with here, and if you can imagine Humphrey Bogart with the face of a pig.
540;Thrilling, wistful, beautiful, funny, thoughtful, nostalgic and warm: it's another Miyazaki!
541;A known fact about Hayao Miyazaki is his love for classic planes.
542;In 1992 he brought his love of planes to life in the high flying adventure 'Porco Rosso'.
543;Once a proud Italian air force pilot,too proud for his own good which brought curse a on him.
544;i had been told this is one of the most beloved Studio Ghibli films, but unfortunatly it didn't really work for me.
545;The begining and ending sequences are so much fun filled with amazing planes bright colors and hysterical moments, but there is really no meat in between the two.
546;Still, I am glad I got to see it and I would say it's a movie to see maybe you will have a better time watching it.
547;Enter in two strong willed heroines, one who knew Porco's former human self.
548;His animation is always top.
549;notch but it is the characters and the story that pull you in.
550;"This story is simple and sweet but has some unexpected levels and turns
551;Always reminds me of Italy and Lake Como when I watch it.
552;Porco Rosso (Crimson Pig) has so much going on that it remains a family favorite, astonishing and delightful, after many years and many viewings.
553;talent and work ethic so strong they make anything look possible, something you too could do.
554;The animation is beautiful to look at, but its implicit in the story, and the story is simply what happens in the lives of remarkable and undaunted characters.
555;A new and more powerful engine helps too.
556;Elaborate black eyes and exhaustion mark both, but they'll live.
557;This is a good family kind of a movie.
558;It is a heart worming movie that the whole family can enjoy together.
559;My first Miyazaki movie was Howl's Moving Castle.
560;I liked it so much I looked for more of his work.
561;The artwork is top notch.
562;highly recommended and very enjoyable.
563;Animation fans rejoice!Apart from """"Nausica of the Valley of Wind"""", """"Porco Rosso"""" is simply one of the most entertaining, fascinating and beautiful Studio Ghibli films ever."""
564;But that's what makes it so great.
565;action, humor, a flying ace that just happens to be a pig and a surprisingly touching romantic subplot.
566;It's Miyazaki's story all through, built around a romantic passion for flying and around strong, young female characters.
567;A chaste sort of romance, up to a point.
568;Just trust Miyazaki, you know it's going to be good.
569;"If you love the classic Anime movies like ""My Neighbor Torturo"" or ""Howles Moving Castle"", you will like this."
570;it is a bit goofy at times, but that was fun.
571;This is my favorite animated movie of all time and one of my favorite movies in general.
572;It doesn't matter how old you are, this movie speaks to all ages.
573;such a great movie, i enjoyed the action, and humour, and english dub was really well done.
