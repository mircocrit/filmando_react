1;One gets the feeling that the award.
2;winning director, who so moved us with the Pianist a few years ago, just didn't have his heart in it or was unable to connect emotionally to the story.
3;polanski does, however, breath some life into the essential themes of the novel.
4;They find a way to pull him back in and use Mr. Brownlow's affection for Oliver to their advantage.
5;perhaps the biggest problem with Oliver Twist is Barney Clark as the courteous and innocent Oliver.
6;For the story to work, sympathy with Oliver is mandatory, but Clark's acting and Polanski's direction keep the character at arm's length.
7;polanski's interpretation is very much a Masterpiece Theater style adaptation, with higher production values.
8;It looks good and hits all the high points, but it's ultimately cool and unemotional.
9;honestly, I do have to admit to three good performances in the movie: Ben Kingsley was excellent as Fagin, Jamie Foreman was effective as Sykes, and Harry Eden as the Artful Dodger gave a great performance.
10;In hindsight, I would watch these fascinating special features first in order to understand their vision.
11;Purists of the book may or may not care for it as Harwood,whose classic book on the teaching of screenplay writingAnother Time,cuts and trims Dickens' story,but really captures the essence better than I have ever seen it done!
12;polanksi's account of Oliver's tragic childhood, survival and ultimate adoption by the kindly rich gentleman, Mr. Brownlow (Edward Hardwicke), fits precisely into the image painted in Dickens' lengthy page turner.
13;"As one would expect, he embellishes the film with extraordinarily realistic scenes of the 19th century British countryside, hardscrabble streets and alleyways of London's ""Spittlefield"" slum and Brownlow's suburban mansion."
14;but Polanski also engaged impressive performances from Ben Kingsley as Fagin, the bent (and evil) old fence and the leader of London thieves and pickpockets, Jamie Foreman as the house.
15;But he also occasionally shines with glints of kindness towards Oliver, the Artful Dodger (Harry Eden) and the rest of his youthful gang, not to mention remorse over Nancy's fate, thus inspiring viewers' sympathies for the poor and downtrodden in 19th Century England and consideration of the very real moral dilemmas of that age.
16;But this in no way detracts from the movie's success.
17;There's something heroic in him, to be sure.
18;And the happy ending is indeed welcome.
19;polanski's characters resonate a faithful depiction of the dickens text.
20;succeeds beautifully with set, costume, photography, and editing.
21;any dickens book in 2 hours has to be a huge challenge, but is very nicely done here.
22;it's the new definitive version.
23;The story of `Oliver Twist' is very widely known and has been done time and time again for the big as well as the small screen.
24;When you attach an Oscar winning director like Roman Polanski to the more recent adaptation of the Dickens classic you start to get your hopes up, because in all technicality it should be amazing.
25;Well, technically speaking it is.
26;The sets are flawless, the costumes are accurate, the mannerisms and speech of the characters seems to fit well.
27;When Oliver jeopardizes Fagin's livelihood and dastardly Bill Sykes makes it his mission to take care of Oliver.
28;the acting is decent at best, aside from a few standouts.
29;He manages to grow with the film, and by the films closing I either was used to his blemishes or he had actually corrected most of them.
30;His performances is ridiculously comical and honestly takes away from the seriousness of the film.
31;Rowe is soft and sincere and Eden is superbly cast in a role that really should have been the only one getting any sort of Oscar attention.
32;"The cinematography is splendid to say the least
I:372;33;It looks updated and glossy and prettier than the previous adaptations, but the older versions in my opinion have a little more heart and are much more endearing.
I:372;34;Polanski in an interview noted that the last really good Oliver Twist film was the musical """"Oliver!"""""""
35;It won 6 academy awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.
36;created (I think they were), and the story seemed believable (I think it does) then people would be willing to spend money to see the film in theaters.
37;now, the film did not perform very well at the box office even though I believe Barney Clark and Ben Kingsley both played their roles wonderfully (especially Kingsley).
38;It is a very famous work of classic British Literature.
39;in short, this 120 minute film gives good acting, an interesting plot (even if subplots are lost), and decent extra.
40;as it happens, I was absolutely delighted by this movie!
41;Although necessarily condensed, it truly captures the emotional power of the story in a captivating and haunting way.
42;The acting and casting were truly superb.
43;many of the characters are portrayed as vividly as I could ever picture them while reading the book.
44;crawly Fagin and Barney Clark as a very sypathetic and innocent yet resilient Oliver.
45;I also loved seeing Edward Hardwicke in a role other than Watson to Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes.
46;wrenching and really exquisite, this adaption verily immerses you in the wonderful story of Oliver Twist in a manner that stands out from all of the other adaptions I have seen.
47;this is my first venture into dickens.
48;I have always enjoyed the 1968 musical version of Oliver, mainly because of the many enjoyable songs.
49;Barney Clark is wonderful as Oliver Twist and Ben Kingsley makes for a great Fagin.
50;I feel the movie is very well done, and the special features do a great job in illustrating how the movie was made.
51;Hence, I give the movie four stars rather than five.
52;There is a place for both of these films in your library.
53;aS for me, the first Oliver Twist was good enough.
54;While not completely true to the original book, this version of the film is a visual stunner and resonates truth in its portrayal of 19th century life.
55;It resonates realism and is a perfect vehicle for the talented Barney Clark who gives a luminous performance.
56;"clark is memorable as Oliver Twist and he carries the film instead of Fagin or ""the Artful Dodger"" as in so many other film versions of the story."
57;There is an innate sweetness that Clark exhibits as Twist.
58;The characters that are kindly and good are not so good as to be syrupy, but more realistic and humanly portrayed.
59;this is a version worth watching, but don't expect to wind up with a great feeling afterward.
60;this film is destined to be a classic.
61;i like Oliver Twist becasue great story and classic story.
62;the acting was good and that's the only reason they get the third star.
63;Polanski's version of Dickens' classic is visually stirring (its use of computerized backgrounds sets a new standard) and has real heart and soul, particularly in the form of Ben Kingsley's sympathetic Fagin, and Leanne Rowe's endearingly charming Nancy, but this tale strayed too far from the novel to be either the definitive or even one of the top adaptations of this 150.
64;we enjoyed it for educational purposes.
65;"This is a novel of amazing intrigue and character development
I:372;66;My high school students loved reading the novel, but after seeing this version of Oliver Twist thought it too was silly.
I:372;67;Roman Polanski has a talent that a minute number of directors in the world possess and that is to accurately translate a book to the big screen.
I:372;68;but he did a great job with what he had.
I:372;69;the wait for this was well worth it .
I:372;70;and then some!Watching a Polanski film is quite the experience!
I:372;71;The interesting thing about the film is the box office figures.
I:372;72;Very traditional visuals and narrative, even the actors look the same as you would imagine them to look when you think of 1950s movies on the same or similar stories.
I:372;73;Solid work, Roman, but next time: please be more original.
I:372;74;I have always been a fan Of Roman Polanski movies.
I:372;75;I have seen all the Oliver Twist movies, and this one stands out as my favorite.
I:372;76;It has a new upbeat feeling, with an unexpected ending.
I:372;77;Timothy Burril an unknown actor is a wounderful talent here as Oliver, such convincing acting from such a youg actor is reminesint of Christian Bale in Empire of the sun, and the young actor from I Am David, infact these to movies have the same mood and acting from their young actors.
I:372;78;Thank Goodness his movies were not because this one is a must see, especially of your a Polanski fan.
I:372;79;I saw it 3 times and ralized the detail Polanski puts into this work.
I:372;80;what I call the """"sweet role"""" of a work."""
81;It is colorful, well acted, well detailed and I love the extended sequence of Oliver (a sweet and talented Barney Clark) walking to the city.
82;I read Oliver Twist at school and thoroughly enjoyed the book.
83;I saw this movie and I also enjoyed it.
84;Although it is not a perfect representation of the book, the director, Roman Polanski, did a commendable job of bringing to life a well known story.
85;The movie was well made, with authentic costumes of the Victorian era and beautiful photography.
86;a depressing and action packed movie with good acting all round that is well worth watching.
87;the locket, the portrait, etc. redeeming the film of course was the performance of Ben Kinsgley as Fagin.
88;"truly impressive acting
I:372;89;it's still the heartwarming tale, but I'm afraid nothing more than that.
I:372;90;polanski has gotten the look of the movie absolutely right and the picture starts well with the scene where Oliver draws the short straw to ask for more gruel .
I:372;91;the acting only real"
92;I actually wanted the musical but this movie is also enjoyable and it cost too much to send it back
93;The results are variably successful: David Lean's 1948 version is brilliant, Renny Rey's 4 part mini series in 1999 was good, Tony Bill's TV film in 1999 had the flavor, the musical version 'Oliver!'
94;was a resounding success, and even Jacob Tierney's 'Twist' from 2003 with the pickpockets as male hustlers had its magic moments.
95;Now here comes Roman Polanski with yet another adaptation of the warhorse novel, and while there are many fine aspects of this version, there are many problems that seem to be overlooked.
96;His sets do appear to be backstage constructions but they offer the right atmosphere.
97;There are some fine actors involved, especially Ben Kingsley as one of the more successful Fagin interpreters.
98;But somewhere along the line Polanski let the scenery and costumes take over and the screenplay and direction offer us the shell outline of the story but the fine actors are not given the opportunity to become fleshed out adequately to allow us to really care about them.
99;at 130 minutes the film seems to drag and to lack attention to character development, but it is a visual treat.
100;And as if to realise that promise, the film has a darker atmosphere than previous adaptions of Oliver Twist, and some truly wonderful perfomances, Kingsley's chief among them.
101;For my money, Dickens is always better read than in any cinema or TV adaptation.
102;The sentiment is definitely here in this case.
103;The Polanski Twist may very well be my new favorite.
104;It's beautifully made with wonderful acting all around.
105;This verion does not include the Maylie and Monks subplots, but in every other respect I felt that this movie was very faithful and wonderfully close to the book I know and love.
106;It's emotionally wrought and really immersing, and that's just how Oliver Twist should be!
107;The acting was excellent and the director kept the spirit of what Dickens put into the story.
108;The scenery, and production of the movie was excellent.
109;It is certainly the definitive version of Dicken's classic story.
110;Polanski's canvas of visual depth and human population is striking.
111;The rest of the cast is remarkably indebted to their characters.
112;So, please keep that in mind when deciding to view a movie he directed.
113;Having said that, I can review the film thoroughly.
114;i recommend this film for one viewing only.
115;A really great film .
116;Polanski and his team bring the original Dickens text to life.
117;often uncaring London society would be the classic that it is today.
118;By now, most everyone is familiar with the story of Oliver Twist, an orphan who is brutalized in the Poorhouse system of Victorian London.
119;told tale, with his efforts resulting in a good, but far from definitive, adaptation.
120;for starters, the film is basically a bare bones version of the story, with many of its wonderful characters and dramatic plotlines either shortened or cut completely.
121;For example, gone are such fantastic characters as Oliver's evil half.
122;on the other hand, there are also many things to enjoy as well.
123;While he might lack the sparkle and grandness that Alec Guinness and Ron Moody brought to the role, Ben Kingsley makes for a credible and sympathetic Fagin.
124;As the title character, Barney Clark is a perfect example of wide.
125;edward Hardwicke, best known to PBS viewers as Dr. Watson in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes series, brings warmth and steel to the role of the kindly Mr. Brownlow.
126;Alun Armstrong and Mark Strong make vivid impressions in smaller roles.
127;Rowe brings a wonderful combination of lost innocence and hard living to the role.
128;Visually, the film is a treat for the eyes with rich colors contrasting with the dark and dingy world of Fagin's gang.
129;Rachel Portman's music also solidly adds to the atmosphere of the film.
130;in the end, Polanski succeeds in creating a movie that, while it is a solid version, falls somewhat short of the more classic film versions of the Dickens novel.
131;Still, this is still a film worth recommending.
132;Better than most Oliver Twist films that I have seen in the past.
133;also move fast and keeps the veiwer interested
134;"This is a brilliant adaptation of Charles Dickens' ""Oliver Twist!"""
135;I've just finished viewing it for the second time and it will stay with me for some time to come.
136;"first let me say that if you are looking for the popular musical, ""Oliver!"""
137;Oliver (wondrously portrayed by Barney Clark), while exceedingly appealing does not come across as precocious.
138;His 'realness' is what makes his character so believable.
139;"Roman Polanski's film is very faithful to Dickens' novel
I:372;140;climactic) is worth enduring his perilous travails as an orphan.
I:372;141;barney Clark should have been nominated for and should have won an Academy award for his work here, as well as Roman Polanski for his directing, Ben Kingsley for his portrayal of Mr. Fagin, and the motion picture itself.
I:372;142;Roman Polanski's version of Oliver Twist is a solid production with many of the flaws of other versions due to the omission of characters from the novel.
I:372;143;my biggest grips is where is the high definition Blu.
I:372;144;ray from Hong Kong and it looks just great.
I:372;145;A classic like this one deserves a U. s. Blu.
I:372;146;dickens' Oliver Twist has endured several film adaptations.
I:372;147;Either this is the purest and most timeless Dickens tale or Polanski is one of the greatest directors of our time, and, in case you want to know my opinion, I believe both to be true.
I:372;148;With Oliver Twist, Dickens discovered his true writing style, creating a boy hero stuck in a world of detailed and colorful characters.
I:372;149;In the film, Polanski paints a beautiful portrait of the world that Oliver inhabits, and it is undoubtedly the world that Dickens had in mind.
I:372;150;He himself grew up on the brink of poverty.
I:372;151;The fact that he is one of the great heroes of literature gives the film a good reason to be of the highest order, because without a character that we can have sympathy for, a film is destined to fall dead in the water.
I:372;152;but since the book is such an immortal classic, Polanski's vision is destined to be, as well.
I:372;153;He sees the world with his young eyes, and it is a world of vivid characters who are either his friends or enemies.
I:372;154;He takes Oliver into his home, treats him with proper medical care and every luxury that he desires, and offers to give Oliver a proper education.
I:372;155;morality is an issue that Dickens so often explored, and both the book and the film solemnly argue that Fagin and his thieves are struggling for survival.
I:372;156;Oliver Twist brings this concept to life in an array of brilliance.
I:372;157;There are many things about the film that are wonderful.
I:372;158;but the film's ultimate triumph is offering a vision much like the one we materialize in our imaginations when we read the book.
I:372;159;The characters are on display for the purposes of dragging the story along, but instead they carry it, and they are all played by actors and actresses who hit all the right notes.
I:372;160;Barney Clark is the perfect Oliver.
I:372;161;Ben Kingsley is a delightful Fagin, who is eventually exploited as a good man on the verge of becoming evil.
I:372;162;Jamie Foreman is easily the scariest and most sinister Bill Sykes ever, and he seems to present an additional cruelty that Dickens did not create.
I:372;163;everything about the film is display and conformation.
I:372;164;We can imagine Charles Dickens falling in love the characters he created and concluding that these are those characters.
I:372;165;But what can it bring that could be new on a subject we all know since this book and this story are classics that everyone knows and that are even at times kind of over.
I:372;166;He is helped in his attempt by the admirable acting of Ben Kingsley as Fagan.
I:372;167;Of course Polanski cannot bring anything new on the subject and he concentrates on the pictorial and plastic beauty of this color adaptation and on the extreme sincerity of the actors, good or evil.
I:372;168;But is it able to erase the unforgettable post.
I:372;169;A great visual movie from start to finish but other then that the movie is just good but not great.
I:372;170;The story is about oliver twist and I think alomost everyone knows it.
I:372;171;The acting is good but not great for a time piece movie.
I:372;172;The film is great for being so visual and the costuems are great and the score.
I:372;173;The movie is a good time peice movie but sadely will be forgoten fast.
I:372;174;Having been a huge Dickens fan for as long as I can remember, I enjoy seeing all the film versions of his novels whenever I can.
I:372;175;I know the story quite well although I haven't re.
I:372;176;This causes the movie to go along at a steady pace that allows it to fit into a two hour running time, but it robs the story of much of its richness.
I:372;177;The relationships between Oliver and Mr. Brownlow and between Oliver and Nancy fail to show any dimensions or depth at all, and this takes away a good bit from the story as a whole.
I:372;178;The movie has a great look to it with wonderful costumes, sets, and digital imagery that give the movie a wonderful sense of time and place.
I:372;179;Along with this sense of verisimilitude, most of the acting is likewise quite realistic.
I:372;180;That being said, most of the acting is subdued and well.
I:372;181;Ben Kingsley rarely disappoints, and his Fagin is both subtle and sympathetic.
I:372;182;In particular, Fagin's final scene is probably the film's finest, being moving without succumbing to heavy melodrama.
I:372;183;The movie clearly shows the result of each reaction.
I:372;184;While sympathy for Oliver may lead a person into danger, it ultimately gives him or her the opportunity for compassion and humanity to overcome baser motivations.
I:372;185;After watching the film, my husband and I had a terrific conversation about this being one possible theme of the novel.
I:372;186;I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for an entertaining and thoughtful rendition of Oliver Twist just so long as they realize that much of the novel's richness of detail is absent from this film.
I:372;187;It's nice to see some of the details of the novel rendered clearly on film.
I:372;188;The character of Nancy is particularly well done and wholly believable.
I:372;189;But David Lean's version is superior as film making and much more watchable.
I:372;190;Be sure to see it too.
I:372;191;One of the better productions of this Dickens story.
I:372;192;But then, I have seen most of the other productions an found that most were good.
I:372;193;This one, well acted well made.
I:372;194;This version of Oliver Twist (by Polanski) is so accurate compared to the book.
I:372;195;I highly recommend this version over the Disney version with Richard Dreyfus as Fagan.
I:372;196;When I first heard Roman Polanski was going to make Oliver Twist his next project, I found it curious.
I:372;197;Why would he go from The Pianist in 2002, a harrowing, realistic account of Holocaust horrors, to Oliver Twist, something of an uplifting, child.
I:372;198;friendly story, three years later?
I:372;199;This makes Oliver Twist, the film, seem more and more curious to me.
I:372;200;Because Polanski's Oliver Twist is a very dark and very deep film.
I:372;201;This film is not a lighthearted fairy tale, but a beautiful drama crafted by an experienced master of cinema.
I:372;202;first of all, Polanski has a gift for getting great performances out of his actors.
I:372;203;The most striking performance in Twist is delivered by Ben Kingsley, whom Polanski extracted such a terrific performance from eleven years prior in Death and The Maiden.
I:372;204;He exhibits such a charming and exuberant nature, you can't help but feel a certain fondness for him, no matter how sinister he may seem at times.
I:372;205;He's just a loveable old man.
I:372;206;Jamie Foreman does a great job as Bill Sykes, creating one of the most menacing and easily hate.
I:372;207;able villains I've ever seen.
I:372;208;Barney Clark does a pretty good job for a child actor.
I:372;209;He's never irritating and pulls off the introspective, passive nature of the character quite well.
I:372;210;The rest of the cast is fairly strong all around, as well.
I:372;211;i could go on and on about how Oliver Twist is masterfully lit and how well the cinematography works, but it rises above technical critiques.
I:372;212;The film made me feel uplifted and hopeful before devastating me with disappointment, and then did it all again and again and again, and that, to me, is a remarkable feat.
I:372;213;(On a side note, I would also like to add that this is all underscored wonderfully by Rachel Portman's excellent score.)
I:372;214;And this is just one way in which Polanski is a true master of cinematic perspective.
I:372;215;The viewer experiences every emotion that Oliver experiences, and Polanski does it not through gimmicks or manipulation, but through what is shown and not shown.
I:372;216;Fear not of what is going to happen to him, but of what his wonderful almost.
I:372;217;in a lot of ways, Oliver Twist is a surprisingly logical progression from The Pianist.
I:372;218;Both are films that examine the best and worst elements of humanity, and ultimately portray a message of hope.
I:372;219;Polanski uses moments of horrible cruelty (including a particularly hard to watch scene of incredibly brutal violence) and moments of nearly inexplicable kindness and decency to create a poignant tapestry of humanity and all that it is capable of.
I:372;220;He even does it, at times, with a simple juxtaposition of imagery.
I:372;221;oliver Twist is a gorgeous, moving, and enlightened masterpiece from a seasoned director who knows exactly what he wants and how to achieve it.
I:372;222;Roman Polanski is one of the true masters of the motion picture, and if Oliver Twist does prove to be his last film, it is an unexpectedly strong note to go out on.
I:372;223;Polanski stated that he made this film merely for his children, because he loves the story so much and made the most true to the book version ever.
I:372;224;The landscape and photography direction is as good as any film could ever have gotten.
I:372;225;This movie was filmed in Prague and everything shot by shot is the most authentic that I have ever seen.
I:372;226;I highly recommend this film for both adults and children over the ages of six years old.
I:372;227;It's very rare that one found can entertain such a large margin in age gap.
I:372;228;This I believe is without a doubt one of Polanski's best of five films.
I:372;229;Since this year celebrates Dickens's 100th year, it is appropriate to revisit this amazing author.
I:372;230;I recently read his last novel, The Mutual Friend, and relished his depth of insight into human beings and the specificity, humor, and pathos with which he expressed that wisdom.
I:372;231;Polanski and Dickens both had childhoods similar to Oliver's, so Polanski seems perfectly suited as director of this film.
I:372;232;I imagine that Dickens would be pleased with this rendition.
I:372;233;I found it so awfully dismal at times that I wasn't sure I wanted to continue watching, yet the ending with Oliver's visit to Fagin in prison was wondrously satisfying and rounded out the entire experience.
I:372;234;(In this category are Fagin, Artful Dodger, the coffin maker, the kind magistrate, the bookseller).
I:372;235;those whose kind and loving acts encourage the hearts of those about them.
I:372;236;This story inspires us to become one of them.
I:372;237;The acting was great and the movie was exciting from start to finish.
I:372;238;I would recommend this to anyone!
I:372;239;Does the audience need another cinematic adaptation of the great novel Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens?
I:372;240;There has already been great ones such a David Lean's version from 1948 where Alec Guinness provides a brilliant portrayal of the villain Fagin.
I:372;241;Then there is the silent masterpiece of Oliver Twist that Frank Lloyd directed in 1922 while Oliver Twist that also received a unique musical treatment directed by Carol Reed in 1968.
I:372;242;The audience definitely needs to see Polanski's version of the legendary tale of the orphan Oliver Twist.
I:372;243;the beauty of Polanski's Oliver Twist is that he captures Dickens' social criticism of the time while also making use of the opportunity to display society's impact on countless orphan youths.
I:372;244;Nonetheless, on rare occasions a few sunflower children emerge with strong enough character to resist the corrupting evils.
I:372;245;In this case, Oliver's innocence helps protect his virtue, which the audience learns more about as the film unfolds.
I:372;246;These three steps, from the orphanage to Sykes, provides an intriguing notion of how many children are fostered when they seek the streets and what happens to them when love and affection is not nurtured for them.
I:372;247;polanski also portrays Dickens' version the judicial system where the judge throws judgment upon people without consideration of humanity, compassion, and fairness.
I:372;248;The film illustrates society's callous machinery that affects the lives of children and the future of a nation.
I:372;249;Oliver's innocence turns out to be a source of goodness, which society tends to ridicule due to its nave perspective of the world.
I:372;250;all of the characters in Oliver Twist have all once been innocent children including the rich men at the orphanage, Fagin, and Sykes.
I:372;251;Thus, Polanski's film presents an intriguing cinematic perspective on Oliver Twist with a strong personal touch where Polanski exorcises his own demons from his past.
I:372;252;I loved reading Oliver Twist when I was younger.
I:372;253;Darker version than many previous ones, which I think is a great interpretation of Dickens' classic tale.
I:372;254;One of the things that made the movie version of the musical """"Oliver!"""""""
255;and skip (or fast forward) through the songs, that the net effect will still be the musical is a more moving drama.
256;"series that have been made since ""Oliver!"""
257;This is obviously much darker than the musical, and therefore closer to Dickens.
258;it was a worthwile watch and Rachel Portman's score was delightful.
259;I loved the 1968 musical of this classic tale, but it took quite a few liberties for the sake of a very good musical score, so that it is quite permissible due to its entertainment value.
260;Now, if you have read the book and decided you want something closer to the author's novel, Roman Polanski's film adaptation isn't perfect, but it is worth having a look.
261;It has no bearing on his profession as a good director, and that's what's important.
262;for the sake of avoiding too much time on an already long film, a lot of the subplots in the Dickens novel are cut out here, and a few details of the story are redirected to accommodate that move, but Polanski's version is impressively close to the telling that Dickens would probably give a courteous nod to.
263;Barney Clark is heartbreakingly adorable as the title character, but I prefer Mark Lester's performance just a bit more.
264;Oliver Reed was the best and most fearsome Bill Sikes of the two, but Ben Kingsley.
265;who really is the big draw in this film.
266;is an outstanding nicer version of Fagin, and actually very comical in an otherwise heavy story.
267;As for our lady of the evening with the heart of gold, Leanne Rowe was very good, but give me Shanie Wallace over her any day.
268;Harry Eden is totally cool as the Artful Dodger and carries the role well enough that, though he's not in your face all the time like Jack Wild was in 1968, he makes his presence well known when he doesn't even say a word.
269;what makes this version of Oliver work is Polanski's attention to detail and impressively touching accout due to his own childhood background.
270;You can feel that he really cares about this story a lot, and he also has great respect for Dickens, which is a big plus.
271;The extras are also very nice touch.
272;Diehard Dickens fans may have a problem with this version, but for those of us who've seen too many movies stray far afield from their humble novelesque origins, Polanski's Twist, is a breath of exceedingly rare fresh air.
273;The movie itself is great.
274;This movie is great and it deserved better treatment than it got.
275;I liked it better than The Piano and it could turn out to be one of Roman Polanski's greatest films.
276;One of the great under appreciated films.
277;They will see an adventure instead of an explanation of the workhouses.
278;The one bright spot of the film was Ben Kingsley's role as Fagin who acted with a sweet and old voice yet you knew by his sound that he was a thief.
279;"In viewing movies based on Charles Dickens works, one is reminded of the darkness in his stories: orphans, abused children and women
I:372;280;And yet within each of his novels there is that glimmer of compassion and hope, and even a happy ending or two.
I:372;281;crafted version of this oft.
I:372;282;filmed tale, he captures the period detail and atmosphere of 19th century London.
I:372;283;Ben Kingsley turns in a top notch performance as Fagin, the lord of a band of pickpockets, with his bent visage and wizened knowledge.
I:372;284;Barney Clark makes a tender Oliver, although his performance at times is too controlled and staged, but for a lad of ten, he does a commendable job.
I:372;285;a minor infringement, though"
286;Barely captures the essence of Dicken's.
287;This version is historically accurate, with a cast that captures the essence of Dickens.
288;"An absorbing story
I:372;289;Polanski has made a technically polished film that conveys a sense of authenticity, but this """"Oliver Twist"""" has nothing to really distinguish it."""
290;When hapless Oliver is wrongly accused of stealing a book, the respectable and well.
291;"It looks good in the sense that the city looks ""realistic"" without being too grimy, which is probably suitable for this material."
292;key lighting leaves most of the image in obscurity.
293;"But ""Oliver Twist"" is a fable that needs to be easily understood."

296;The Best of Twist (17 min) explores the film's sets, costumes, and photography.
297;Interviews with Polanski, costume designer Anna B. Sheppard, and director of photography Pawel Edelman.
298;He also talks about the film a year later after seeing the finished product.
299;Subtitles for the film are available in English and French.
300;Dubbing is available in French.
301;A lover of Charles Dickens and his works will enjoy this newer version of the beloved tale.
302;alone, fine acting along with 'color and grit' of each character draw the viewer as each cast member contributes to the success and unfolding of the story although it be a familiar one.
303;roman Polanski deserves highest praise and applaud for his interpretation of this Dickens classic and this ground breaking achievement.
304;completed with a hauntingly beautiful musical score, Oliver Twist (2005) would make a welcome addition to any movie lovers library!Sincerely,Matthew Moll
305;This is one of those films that I have been watching again and again and again.
306;After 1h 41m the movie got stuck!
307;Very well acting and the atmosphere of the age is well represented.
308;It was worth wile to have bought the second copy and moving up to 5 stars.
309;about the film: the young lad who played Oliver was excellent as was the entire cast.
310;drawn coach filled to the top with passengers.
311;a face of love and concern.
312;i loved the accent Ben Kingsley used for his Fagan.
313;i loved the kindly elderly book seller that takes Oliver under his wing.
314;Daughter is a high school teacher.
315;She wanted this movie to add to her collection to share with her kids.
316;Roman Polanski melds his talents and personal history with that of Dickens, and the resulting film is stunning in its artistry.
317;Suffice it to say that the selection of actors, sets, costumes, cinematographer, etc. is satisfying in the extreme.
318;For those who love Dickens, this is a film that will be pleasing and perhaps surpassing in its understanding of the author, his depth of identification with his protagonist, and his intent .
319;For those who aren't familiar with the book, this film is a revelation.
320;This film is a resurrection of the ghosts of Oliver Twist, Fagan, and all of the beautiful, evil attributes of the human soul beautifully, starkly, and thankfully not pretentiously brought to our attention by Polanski on one of his good days.
321;i enjoyed everything about it.
322;Ben Kingsley especially is terrific (when is he not?)
323;Jamie Foreman is also great as the villain Bill Sykes.
324;"And the ""twists"" in the plot were fun for me since I knew nothing more of the story other than it was about an orphan in England."
325;and lastly the music was wonderful and very moving, it stuck in my head all night after I watched it.
326;A spot on soundtrack always adds so much to a movie.
327;roman Polanski's movies have always been hit or miss for me but this one hits the bulls eye.
328;The effect is a film that's a bit gloomier, but more poignant.
329;in the second half there's more to the plot than the musical version, and it's more interesting.
330;But Jamie Foreman is a very effective Bill Sykes, the best in my opinion.
331;"overall, it may be no better than previous versions except in the most superficial way
I:372;332;Dicken's Oliver is a very complex character, and must be very hard to cast, but Clark plays him effortlessly, and you can't help loving him.
I:372;333;He looked the part, and brought the right attitude to the role, even when managing what appears to be a delicate balencing act between the corrupted youth of the novel, and the more likable fellow of the Disney film.
I:372;334;This movie had good directing, good acting, great filming, excellent location and the right music, but somehow it's less than Oliver Twist without him coming to peace with where he came from, the evil and the good .
I:372;335;embodied in the persons of Rose, his cousin, and Monks, his half.
I:372;336;But it's still good, particuarly because of Clark's potrayel of Oliver.
I:372;337;He is precious without being adorable, resolute wthout being self.
I:372;338;The end was very touching.
I:372;339;Watch this and you'll be glad you did.
I:372;340;A well done adaptaion and production of a beloved Dickens classic which did not have an abundance of well known actors that often times are a distraction to films iof this type.
I:372;341;I've read the book as a kid and have seen all versions including the musical which was the best.
I:372;342;line in tune with Charles Dickens' work, it's still a fine film and well worth watching.
I:372;343;Great, great acting and it was very good.
I:372;344;on my way to work on Saturdays, Oliver Twist was on the radio and I happened upon it in the middle of the story and it sounded so good I told myself I will have to order the movie from Amazon.
I:372;345;I remember Ben Kingsley's performance the most in this movie.
I:372;346;And of course the talent of Polanski makes this movie one of the best historical ones I have ever seen.
I:372;347;the movie captures very well the spirit of Dickens' novel.
I:372;348;The movie is well paced .
I:372;349;The sets are designed very well and they do look authentic.
I:372;350;This version gives us a darn good Toby Crackit.
I:372;351;Oliver Reed's Sikes was great.
I:372;352;I could go on and on, but its such a great book and there are many great movie versions, why not see them all.
I:372;353;I enjoy reading everyone's opinions.
I:372;354;I watched it and it is on both sides.
I:372;355;I loved every single musical number within """"Oliver Twist"""" the most, specifically """"I'd Do Anything."""""""
356;This is when the fun starts!He's found friendship in a pickpocket crew full of thieves and crooks, but he's content there.
357;"He sees past their ""career paths"" and embraces the humanity beneath them."
358;This stuff is really happening.)
359;I loved this movie as a child, and this weekend, I drove to two stores and online shopping before I found it again in the middle of a thunderstorm.
360;After rewatching it, although I'm not crazy about the Confederate flags but it's realistic to the times, I still love it just as much.
361;Item was received in a very timely manner and in great condition.
362;Needed item for school project and received in time to watch more than once and even share the item with others.
363;noticed gem came and went quickly from our screens.
364;Polanski has teased out a faithful, compelling retelling of the Twist story, and has populated the film with memorable characterizations.
365;particularly wonderful is Leanne Rowe as Nancy, and of course Ben Kingsley really steals the movie as the nuanced, deeply conflicted Fagen.
366;"i love this film
I:372;367;this film is beautifully dark.
I:372;368;it is just realistic enough to give the viewer a sense of what living in Victorian England might have been like without losing its sense of Dickensian humor.
I:372;369;it's perfectly acceptable storytelling and Rachel Portman's score is pleasing, but it's a film that you watch, sometimes literally with its preponderance of mastershots, at a distance.
I:372;370;it incarnation of one of Dickens' most intriguing charactars, there can be no arguing that Ben Kingsley is THE Fagin from now on.
I:372;371;He looked it, he acted it, he simply was the charactar.
I:372;372;It delighted me no end.
I:372;373;When I first heard the soundtrack to 'Emma', done by the same, I loved it.
I:372;374;it will probably be a long time before anyone takes their hand to 'Oliver Twist' again, but until then I can be satisfied with the good points of this movie, and sigh for what might have been.
I:372;375;His new `Oliver Twist' has the look and feel of the original book, but it seems he forgot to put its heart in it.
I:372;376;But they had the spirit of Dickens, inimitable creator of unforgettable characters and gripping storyteller.
I:372;377;To me, except for the horrifying part about fate of Sikes, Nancy and Fagin, `Oliver Twist' is a well.
I:372;378;Polanski presents these episodes in such a somber color that I thought I was watching a Thomas Hardy adaptation.
I:372;379;artful Dodger (Harry Eden) and Nancy (Leanne Rowe) are both good, giving us the convincing and sympathetic portraits of the characters who have to live in the underground world.
I:372;380;Fagin is, to most of us I think, an incorrigible, hopeless, melodramatic baddie you meet only on stage and screen, but Polanski attempts to establish kind of friendship or sympathy between the boy and the fence.
I:372;381;like the melodious but repetitious riff of Rachel Portman score, this `Oliver Twist' constantly offers beautiful images of the 19th century England from the beginning to the end.
I:372;382;I have been following the making of this film, for years now, and was thrilled to finally see it, today.
I:372;383;Scenery lovely, costumes well done, sets very accurate to the early Victorian age, and very gloomy settings with fog, mud, and muck that you can almost smell London, as was.
I:372;384;They also left out a great deal of characters, like Monks, Rose, her fiance, the Claypoles, and some of the gang.
I:372;385;For a fuller story, see the 6 hour Masterpiece Theatre version"
386;For better acting, see the musical.
