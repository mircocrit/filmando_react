I:8487;1;It was a great movie before, and now it looks and sounds better than before on Blu Ray.
I:8487;2;This movie has been enjoyed at by my 3 and 4 year old, it was the first movie they sat through entirely!
I:8487;3;It's an excellent movie and looks great on the PSP screen.
I:8487;4;and it was a good price ~cheaper than any where Ive looked
I:8487;5;I finally watched this with my two young children, and was surprised at certain parts.
I:8487;6;"Woody certainly does far more name calling (""idiot!"
I:8487;7;Certainly there are some lessons here that are valuable.
I:8487;8;My godson loves this movie and served as a great Christmas gift!
I:8487;9;I like the easy download.
I:8487;10;My daughter likes the movie.
I:8487;11;I would recommend it to anyone.
I:8487;12;I'll be downloading more movies soon!
I:8487;13;Packaging was appropriate as well.
I:8487;14;Come on people, this is what you rate as 5 stars!!
I:8487;15;CRAP is what I will call it.
I:8487;16;I love cartoons, and my girlfriend convinced me to watch this.
I:8487;17;I recommend to anyone who likes cartoons.
I:8487;18;The best chapter of this film is the moving truck chase near the end of the film.
I:8487;19;This movie is very exciting and I watch this a lot, get the second film too.
I:8487;20;I saw this incredible movie in the theater, and got the cassette as it released.
I:8487;21;Another great installment for Pixar.
I:8487;22;great for all ages as everyone will enjoy this film.
I:8487;23;easy to find this online and at a great price.
I:8487;24;it's just brilliant and my daughter love it.
I:8487;25;good for all ages .
I:8487;26;I think the first Toy Story is the best one.
I:8487;27;This has always been a favorite movie of mine.
I:8487;28;All these years late, Toy Story is just a great story.
I:8487;29;I enjoyed it before I had kids and just enjoyed it again with my kids.
I:8487;30;But this is a great movie.
I:8487;31;My daughter loves it and it is always the movie she asks for.
I:8487;32;I loved it then and still love it today.
I:8487;33;The movie arrived on time, and was in great shape upon arrival.
I:8487;34;This is one of my favorite childhood movies.
I:8487;35;It stands the test of time it manages to make me laugh and even some suspense.
I:8487;36;Of course he loves the movie and we watch it almost every time he visits.
I:8487;37;Great movie, my 2 year old and 4 year old twins love it.
I:8487;38;It is a great version, and it is nice to see it in high definition.
I:8487;39;It's the same great movie.
I:8487;40;ray yet, but I'm sure it will be the same great movie.
I:8487;41;I've found it in places I wouldn't expect!
I:8487;42;An amazingly well written script for an animation film, the voice overs are fantastic and the technical aspects very wonderful to watch.
I:8487;43;It is a real trick to make a movie that appeals to both young and old and this one does just that.
I:8487;44;Toy Story the original is the best!!
I:8487;45;The story is cute, the humor is adult as well as child.
I:8487;46;like and the characters are exciting.
I:8487;47;loves this she is 3 and it is a great great Disney story with wonderful graphics and storyline.
I:8487;48;The movie is extremely well put together.
I:8487;49;Kids and adults alike enjoyed the antics of the toys and the imagination of the Pixar animators.
I:8487;50;Rarely do movies that continue a series continue the excellence of the original.
I:8487;51;Fun for the whole family to watch.
I:8487;52;This is a wonderful Disney movie.
I:8487;53;It is a funny, action packed movie that kids will enjoy watching with their family.
I:8487;54;Toy Story is my all time favorite kids movie.
I:8487;55;I remember watching the first one years ago, and now I watch the first, second and third, with my son.
I:8487;56;He is four and he loves watching, wearing or playing with anything Toy Story!
I:8487;57;The story lines in all 3 keep his interest the entire time and he really understands what is going on throughout the movie.
I:8487;58;My children really love this movie.
I:8487;59;This movie was awesome my lil girl loved and thought is was amazing to watch.
I:8487;60;the movie itself is wonderful.
I:8487;61;as an adult, seeing all the old toys will be appreciated more by you than children.
I:8487;62;the animation is wonderful, and blu ray looks great.
I:8487;63;the colors are very crisp.
I:8487;64;Great job on figuring out what a modern family needs, Amazon!
I:8487;65;the movie is great and so are 2 and 3.
I:8487;66;My eight year old loves this movie.
I:8487;67;My two, nearly three year old loves this movie up until the introduction of the bad child next doors house.
I:8487;68;But the ending is great.
I:8487;69;But overall its a great movie for the family.
I:8487;70;Toy Story is truly one of the most beloved franchises in all of film, not merely animated film.
I:8487;71;They are clever, exciting, original and they build such strong emotional ties to the audience, delivering a beautifully moving cinematic experience.
I:8487;72;With crisp animation, superb character development and a plot that stirs deeply profound emotions (this look at childhood, innocence and friendship is remarkably astute), Toy Story may be almost twenty years old, but it is just as profound, poignant and lovable today as it was upon its release!
I:8487;73;Toy Story is a lot of fun.
I:8487;74;My kids love it, and it's the type of kids' movies that adults can enjoy too.
I:8487;75;It has a great story line and lovely for families or adults that are big kids :).
I:8487;76;Grandkids and i loved it.
I:8487;77;Love the detail and the story line.
I:8487;78;I bought this for christmas as a present for my three year old, and he absolutley loves it.
I:8487;79;I had seen it when it first came out and it is still a feel good movie, it just brings back memories.
I:8487;80;Saw this movie in the theater years ago, bought it on VHS for my daughter and she loved it.
I:8487;81;So excited to get such a great deal and then the free tickets on top of that!
I:8487;82;My 3 1/2 year old son loved this movie.
I:8487;83;We just let him watch it for the first time, and he enjoyed it.
I:8487;84;We love Toy Story at our house!
I:8487;85;My two year old is enjoying watching the adventures of Woody and Buzz.
I:8487;86;toy story is a classic.
I:8487;87;Fun to watch for the whole family.
I:8487;88;My 4 year old loves it.
I:8487;89;A classic movie about friendship, and loyalty.
I:8487;90;The toy Story series is brilliant.
I:8487;91;Beautiful to look at animation wise and so well developed character wise.
I:8487;92;I am a big fan of pixar films and this is the first movies that started it all.
I:8487;93;I've always loved this movie.
I:8487;94;I think it is great no matter your age.
I:8487;95;I hope you enjoy as much as I did.
I:8487;96;My son loves this movie and haven't been able to find it in stores.
I:8487;97;Thank god I found it and just in time for Christmas
I:8487;98;Great family movie and very funny!!
I:8487;99;Definitely recommend watching it, a long with all of the other Toy Story sequels.
I:8487;100;Great story, viewed it with my son and both of us enjoyed it.
I:8487;101;and this movie, so wonderful when it came out for the perfect use of that developed and more mature animation, amazing for breaking new ground and blazing new paths.
I:8487;102;is now a classic kid's movie.
I:8487;103;somehow though, like all classics, it's still good enough to make adults love it too.
I:8487;104;All three of these movies are pure amazing.
I:8487;105;The story keeps you into it with just enough humor and minor drama, humorous drama.
I:8487;106;Recommend to people of all ages and if you see this one or any of them as a matter of fact I highly recommend you see all of them.
I:8487;107;This is one of the few titles that all of its sequels are actually great and worth the money and lifetime of enjoyment.
I:8487;108;I have always been a fan of Disney movies and this one just did not feel good like other ones.
I:8487;109;The end of the story turns out wonderful, of course, and some of the scenes are really fun and heartwarming .
I:8487;110;"He LOVES Buzz, who is the main ""good guy"" in the movie, and I let him have a Buzz."
I:8487;111;Buzz has become Andy's favorite.
I:8487;112;And he makes monsters out of his toys and also his sister's toys.
I:8487;113;How they work together to escape, and to follow the moving van carrying Andy's toys to their new home, is controlled mayhem so intricate and so funny that I won't spoil a thing for you.
I:8487;114;ups, and everyone can split their sides laughing.
I:8487;115;Easily one of the greatest animated pictures I have ever seen.
I:8487;116;My son is now a huge Buzz Lightyear fan
I:8487;117;All of the characters are cute and Tom Hanks and Tim Allen's voices are wonderful.
I:8487;118;Now I'm 13 and I still love it.
I:8487;119;It's disney's greatest animation film ever!
I:8487;120;Woody has been Andy's top toy for some time, but soon finds his top spot usurped by a new Space toy named Buzz Lightyear.
I:8487;121;It is a straightforward story with a great script and wonderful acting between Tom Hanks as Woody, and Tim Allen as Buzz.
I:8487;122;Well worth watching time and time again.
I:8487;123;And it got here just in time.
I:8487;124;This movie will make you laugh.
I:8487;125;I just love watching this movie.
I:8487;126;woody is the best and laughing is a must for this movie
I:8487;127;This is a great movie to have in your collection.
I:8487;128;The storyline is wonderful, and the choices of actors to voice the characters are perfect!
I:8487;129;This is an inspiring story.
I:8487;130;Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition)~ Tom Hanks is an amazing animated movie with a well written script that is about the secret life of toys.
I:8487;131;The animation is astounding considering that it was done over ten years ago (1995).
I:8487;132;I highly recommend this movie and I consider it one of the best animated made ever.
I:8487;133;The songs are a bit sappy but perfect for animated movies and the music is right on par.
I:8487;134;I definitely without a doubt give this movie 5 stars.
I:8487;135;This is lighter and funnier, whereas number three is more emotionally provocative.
I:8487;136;This is a great movie!!!
I:8487;137;My daughter absolutely loves it.
I:8487;138;Tom Hanks and Tim Allen bring Woody and Buzz to life, taking you inside the world of Toys.
I:8487;139;A great movie for the whole family to enjoy over and over again!
I:8487;140;When Buzz gets abducted, Woody and the rest of the toys come to the rescue!
I:8487;141;My grandchildren love this movie and like to watch it.
I:8487;142;I am glad that I ordered it for them and we will be enjoying it together.
I:8487;143;For my son and for my grandson.
I:8487;144;An absolute classic that every kids should have on the shelf.
I:8487;145;What can I say my husband even loves this movie.
I:8487;146;It's been over 15 years since this came out and it is still awesome to watch!
I:8487;147;This was Pixar's first foray into the feature film biz and they did an immeasurably good job with it!Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is Andy's favorite toy.
I:8487;148;just suffice it to say that it is a hilarious movie for all!
I:8487;149;It's been 15 years, and I still love it immensely.
I:8487;150;It is great for the young and the young at heart.
I:8487;151;You need to be a member of Disney Movie Rewards, (It's free, and easy to sign up!)
I:8487;152;all in all, this is a stupendous movie, even after 15 years and this combo pack is terrific!
I:8487;153;Fun filled animation with our favorites.
I:8487;154;The best of the trilogy for sure.
I:8487;155;The characters are amazing and the choices of actors to voice them is perfect!!
I:8487;156;Toy Story is a classic kids movie that is fun to watch for all ages and is one that our kids have not outgrown nor grown tired of.
I:8487;157;This is one of my favorite movie from Pixar.
I:8487;158;So much charm to it and a wonderful story.
I:8487;159;great movie, but i'm prejudice because i love just about anything disney.
I:8487;160;Its the only way to go with these classic Disney movies!
I:8487;161;There will never be another toy story like this one.
I:8487;162;This will go down in history as a classic.
I:8487;163;A movie I will love and I look forward to watching it with my daughter when she is old enough to enjoy it as well.
I:8487;164;I bought this movie for my daughter and im very happy with this.
I:8487;165;Great for adults and children.
I:8487;166;My 2 year old loves it.
I:8487;167;Very funny and better than most other cartoon movies.
I:8487;168;I was so happy to find this movie!
I:8487;169;Was very pleased on how quick the movie got there.
I:8487;170;Along with it's sequel, this is one of the few decent movies put out by Disney in a long time.
I:8487;171;Almost all of the old stuff (before the evil Michael Eisner took over) is excellent and family friendly.
I:8487;172;"A good book that exposes the new Disney empire is ""Disney: The Mouse Betrayed."""
I:8487;173;My kids love this movie.
I:8487;174;I love that it isn't gender specific so that both my children can enjoy the movie.
I:8487;175;The video has been cleaned up with a higher bit rate (the original looked super to begin with!)
I:8487;176;and the sound is much improved with new options that weren't available before now.
I:8487;177;There are enough improvements and new features to make the extra $16 worthwhile.
I:8487;178;I live this movie and now my daughter does too!
I:8487;179;Toy Story is the best animated movie I have ever seen!
I:8487;180;Disney rules with TOY STORY!
I:8487;181;Love love love this movie!
I:8487;182;I have it for regular and blu ray and still continue to watch it from time to time.
I:8487;183;The story is something all ages can enjoy and the humor is very enjoyable and comical.
I:8487;184;I heard rumors of a new TS coming out and I really hope its true!!!
I:8487;185;So finding this was great!
I:8487;186;I am pleased with the movie and the timeliness in which I received it!
I:8487;187;My grandson was very excited with it as well!
I:8487;188;Fun film for the whole family.
I:8487;189;All the Toy Story films are worth watching again and again.
I:8487;190;Came in the mail and was packed correct.
I:8487;191;is in great shape and thank you very much!I now have the Toy Story,Toy Story11 so well enjoy all at the same time.
I:8487;192;This will no doubt be a classic and be watched by families for years and years.
I:8487;193;Good animation, and a good movie.
I:8487;194;It has made a wonderful addition to our pixar collection.
I:8487;195;We have all three and think they are great!
I:8487;196;this is a great movie that keeps everyone entertained thru the whole show.
I:8487;197;It is funny and teaches children about sharing and taking care of things.
I:8487;198;He loved the movie and usually a 3 to 4 year old's attention span isn't very long.
I:8487;199;Of course, the twins love it.
I:8487;200;Good experience and you made Grandpa the hero.
I:8487;201;Just a fantastic blend of all the qualities that make a movie an instant classic!
I:8487;202;This is easily my family's favorite disney/kids movie.
I:8487;203;This is a really great movie with the exception of one thing.
I:8487;204;Found it here for a great price.
I:8487;205;Forgot how much I loved this movie!
I:8487;206;I have always loved this movie and now my children enjoy it also.
I:8487;207;It is just great all around.
I:8487;208;I have only been through a few of the extras but I have enjoyed them.
I:8487;209;Nostalgia aside, this is still an excellent movie!
I:8487;210;The script is so clever and heartfelt, the characters are all fantastic, the voice acting is great, and the animation, which was a benchmark for its time, still holds up (even though they've come a long way).
I:8487;211;Best of all, this movie will remind adults of the joy of being a kid and playing with toys (and imagining that they were alive).
I:8487;212;This movie is a classic (the sequels are also fantastic, but definitely watch in chronological order).
I:8487;213;It might actually be my favorite movie of all time.
I:8487;214;This is the best the film has ever looked (other than the Blu.
I:8487;215;The bonus features are fascinating (especially for aspiring animators/filmmakers like myself).
I:8487;216;ray player, this is still a great option.
I:8487;217;It gets even better with time.
I:8487;218;It also was the inspiration for me to start writing for animation.
I:8487;219;Thanks for helping find my passion, Pixar!
I:8487;220;This, of course, is a very classic animated movie.
I:8487;221;The voices done by popular stars are excellent!
I:8487;222;Toy Story is one of those movies in which EVERYTHING works, and one which is equally enjoyable to kids and adults.
I:8487;223;I've always loved this movie, and it is a great classic to re.
I:8487;224;The writing is better every time I watch it!
I:8487;225;But Pixar came in and changed things for the better so hopefully Disney gets their act together because if Pixar so far has been 5 for 5(even though I only marginally like Monsters Inc).
I:8487;226;"It's the charm of the entire scene that still makes me laugh, especially the ""we toys can see everryyythiinnng""."
I:8487;227;Toy Story also has such great characters with one of my favorites being these toy aliens you get in one of those manual.
I:8487;228;like attitude towards the machine's claw, they're still funny.
I:8487;229;hopefully this is the last double dip by Pixar.
I:8487;230;But c'est la vie and even still this is still a good movie.
I:8487;231;I ordered this movie and second one, they're both among my 18 month old's favorites.
I:8487;232;The graphics, the animation, the detail.
I:8487;233;Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, and the entire cast provide some of the greatest voices to the classic movie.
I:8487;234;This means that I can watch the movie on any of my i devices including my iPhone, iPad, and AppleTV.
I:8487;235;I love that I can play it on my AppleTV.
I:8487;236;I highly recommend getting a digital copy and choosing the iTunes version if you have the means to do so.
I:8487;237;It can go on any i device and it travels easily.
I:8487;238;Kids can watch it in the car.
I:8487;239;Ever since the young age, I loved it.
I:8487;240;Being the 1st Digital movie, this deserves to be put in top 100 best movies ever.
I:8487;241;The extras are amazing and this is when Pixar made some good movies.
I:8487;242;Toy Story 2 comes out DEC.26th AND Toy Story 3 will go into production after the finish Cars!
I:8487;243;This is the first of the Pixar films, and it remains the best.
I:8487;244;The movie is full of lovable characters, and full of wonderful lessons about friendship and trust that will delight all ages.
I:8487;245;animated movies that have come out since this classic, this is with out a doubt the best.
I:8487;246;A real classic, my kids loved as much as I did when I was small.
I:8487;247;Watching it on Amazon was so easy as well.
I:8487;248;My 2.5 year old daughter is constantly asking to watch it and my 1 year old son loves it too.
I:8487;249;This movie is a classic.
I:8487;250;Must see for all ages.
I:8487;251;We got the movie very quick, and it was just like new.
I:8487;252;Great for family movie nights!
I:8487;253;It had a terrific sequel and a third is scheduled for June 18, 2010 (yes, in 3.
I:8487;254;Still, this will always be a great film because it wasthe humor in here, however, is what made this so popular.
I:8487;255;there are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others.
I:8487;256;There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new.
I:8487;257;The colors in here are beautiful, too.
I:8487;258;"This is a guaranteed ""winner."""
I:8487;259;They continue to watch it because it's funny, heartwarming, and genuinely entertaining.
I:8487;260;the key to the film is the performances (both animated and voice).
I:8487;261;Pixar was smart enough not to try to make a full.
I:8487;262;length film until they were ready: their computer models can fully express emotions in the face, in body language, and most importantly in the eyes.
I:8487;263;Adding in the supurb voice talents of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen and these animations come to life.
I:8487;264;Supporting voices by John Ratzenberger (in full Cliff Claven mode) and Don Rickles make the voice acting in this film among the best of any animated film ever made.
I:8487;265;But the execution and the attention to small details give this story a fresh look, just as computer animation was giving a fresh look to animation in general.
I:8487;266;But with Toy Story, the style of animation fits so well that I cannot imagine it any other way.
I:8487;267;There are some neat extras, not the least of which is a detailed directors/writers commentary.
I:8487;268;There are also some reflections on the film made 10 years later, as well as some deleted/altered scenes, which are always interesting to see.
I:8487;269;By far, the claw machine aliens and the army men are the real stars of the movie.
I:8487;270;pop this movie in and you got 90 minutes to talk to mom and get the dishes done.
I:8487;271;This is a great movie good for all ages and really catches the toddlers attention.
I:8487;272;I would have returned it but my son loves the movie so i decided to keep it.
I:8487;273;"I finally saw this film when my best friend brought the video over and said ""you'll love this movie!"""
I:8487;274;animated film, and an undeniable gamble.
I:8487;275;the basic gist of the film is this: Woody(Hanks), is the favorite toy of his owner, Andy.
I:8487;276;During the ensuing adventures, Woody realizes he's at fault, Buzz realizes that he's a toy, and that they are becoming great friends.
I:8487;277;there's a great feeling to this film, that of friendship, that pervades it to the end.
I:8487;278;There's an almost tangible feeling of heart to this film, and that is what makes it great.
I:8487;279;I'm so happy to finally have this on Blu.
I:8487;280;I would have easily paid the $35 because this film is a classic and one of my all time favorite movies!
I:8487;281;Pixar and Disney make such amazing films!
I:8487;282;ish slipcover shown in the picture, which is pretty neat!
I:8487;283;Great price for a great film!
I:8487;284;I think that I love this movie as much as he does!!
I:8487;285;A great story, it's nice to see an animated movie that DOESN'T focus on violence, rudeness, and bad language like so much that is out today!!
I:8487;286;The voices of Tim Allen and Tom Hanks are a great addition to this incredible movie.
I:8487;287;Absolutely incredible detail, facial expressions, shadowing, and overall movement of the characters.
I:8487;288;This movie will appeal to anyone.
I:8487;289;A film to last the ages, Toy Story is definitely a tale that any child, teen, adult, or anything in.
I:8487;290;between and afterward will always hold close to their heart and watch time.
I:8487;291;Every child likes to think their toys are alive, and this series brings that imagination and joy to life.
I:8487;292;She said yes to Toy Story and was glued to the TV for the hour.
I:8487;293;I love Toy Story so much I would put the Toy Story series in my top 5 favorite movies all time.
I:8487;294;If you have kids Toy Story is a must!!!
I:8487;295;A good film, devoid the touching sadness its sequel had in certain parts, Toy Story is just a fun film to see, and its then landmark animation is still impressive today!
I:8487;296;Heck, any mainstream film with a guy named Woody in it is worth seeing just for that reason, right?
I:8487;297;Toy Story earns it's massive acclaim.
I:8487;298;A great story delivered by a snappy screenplay, solid acting voices and superb directing.
I:8487;299;Your kids will thank you and love you forever.
I:8487;300;And I am a forever fan of a movie that can 'entertain' me as an adult while the kids are thoroughly happy.
I:8487;301;The original and still the best!
I:8487;302;The visuals are still spectacular, even if the humans appear a bit rubbery at times.
I:8487;303;And Woody and Buzz are great here.
I:8487;304;when I watched this movie in a theater for the first time, I thought it was fantastic.
I:8487;305;It has everything you remembered from watching it in the theater and the Special Features section is just fantastic as well.
I:8487;306;to boot, the stories are excellent and funny.
I:8487;307;The characters are charming and fun.
I:8487;308;The music upbeat and catchy.
I:8487;309;And is one of the best ever.
I:8487;310;This movie is awesome, love the characters and the story.
I:8487;311;well, you need to watch it.
I:8487;312;I ordered this movie for my, then, 6 year old and it is still in service 9 years later.
I:8487;313;My youngest, age 5, loves the movie as well.
I:8487;314;Fun movie to watch for the whole family.
I:8487;315;good product and good shipping time.
I:8487;316;Thins will keep them entertained foe a few hours.
I:8487;317;It's a very enjoyable film.
I:8487;318;My 2 grandsons were watching them when they were 2 and loved all of them, and still do!
I:8487;319;This is my nephew's favorite.
I:8487;320;Toy Story is a modern fairy tale created with appropriately modern computer animation.
I:8487;321;Its snappy dialougue will appeal to adult viewers, the spectacle of fantastic toys coming to life will appeal to children, and adults may wax nostalgic about the toys they enjoyed as children, several of which are featured in this movie.
I:8487;322;tom Hanks'personality shines through in the persona of Woody, and Tim Allen's voice lends the right amount of charisma to Buzz.
I:8487;323;in the process of forming an eventual friendship, the characters go through a lot of antagonism and a lot of other real human emotions.
I:8487;324;it's entertaining to watch the toys interact with each other.
I:8487;325;buzz gradually learns that he is simply a child's plaything and not the noble space crusader he fancied himself to be in the beginning, and Woody learns to share his special place in Andy's heart.
I:8487;326;"The second installment of the ""Toy Story"" saga is an enhancement of the first one, and just like the first, nothing short of delightful."
I:8487;327;Anyone with kids has probably watched this movie a ton.
I:8487;328;I have but yet still enjoy it.
I:8487;329;It's a good movie no matter what format you watch it in.
I:8487;330;OMG I'm so happy I own this now !
I:8487;331;I'm huge fan since as a young kid I love it !
I:8487;332;This movie is just alot of fun.
I:8487;333;I'm not sure if I recommend it for very young children, as it has a lot of adult/young adult humor, and just from personal experience, when I was around 6 I had a big fear of toys and dolls coming to life, so this movie would have freaked me out.
I:8487;334;I will continue to spread the great news.
I:8487;335;sent it to my sisters house nice to do.
I:8487;336;We already love the Toy Story movie.
I:8487;337;I bought this movie for my children because I love it too.
I:8487;338;I had remembered it from the theatre, but I still enjoy watching it with my 3 1/2 year.
I:8487;339;"When it comes to animated classics, ""Toy Story"" is definitely one title that is among a great group of titles."
I:8487;340;"force of creating animated CGI hits such as ""A Bug's Life"", ""Cars"", ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Finding Nemo"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Up"", ""Wall."
I:8487;341;"For a film that was created back in 1995, ""Toy Story"" still looks beautiful on Blu."
I:8487;342;"Sure, the detail is nowhere near what we see on the ""Toy Story 3' teaser (included on the special features) but the film just looks fantastic on Blu."
I:8487;343;For example, seeing the detail that was made for Rex the Tyrannosaurus, to the threading of the chairs, the vibrant colors of the film, the detail of the road and again, even for a film that is 15.
I:8487;344;The film looks absolutely beautiful.
I:8487;345;"old film, ""Toy Story"" sounds magnificent on lossless."
I:8487;346;Audiophiles will be pleased that the lossless audio is quite immersive.
I:8487;347;I was very impressed by the lossless audio.

I:8487;383;Including the wonderful song You've got a friend in me!
I:8487;384;This movie took me by storm when I saw it back in the summer of 1995 at the theatres and let me tell you, this movie is still one of the best computer animated movies of all time.
I:8487;385;the plot is absolutely joyful and stunningly original.
I:8487;386;The story revolves around the quiet family home of a quiet town where a boy owns numerous toys with his toddler sister.
I:8487;387;assembling their parts to create 'mutant' toys and now the clock is ticking for Tim and Buzz to escape from the boys house before they end up being blown to molecules.
I:8487;388;this movie is absolutely fun and original even by 1995 standards.
I:8487;389;The computer generated special effects are innovative and unbelievable especially considereing the fact that this movie came out nearly a whole decade ago.
I:8487;390;The whole tone of the movie is just fun and charming and is for the entire family.
I:8487;391;Not only that but this was what put the then newcomers Pixas right into the front seat of movie animation and would be the start of an unbroken streak of excellent movies from this dynamite team.
I:8487;392;Product was on time and in great condition.
I:8487;393;This was a Christmas gift, so thank you for making the mishap stress free.
I:8487;394;This was a gift for an old guy with a new grandson and he loved it.
I:8487;395;It will give him access to characters that his grandson will be talking about.
I:8487;396;This cartoon is great, picture is perfect!
I:8487;397;And shipped in no time, which is great because we live in rural Alaska.
I:8487;398;ray and better than the first one.
I:8487;399;Toy Story, much like Snow White before it opened a whole new world of opportunities for animation all around the world.
I:8487;400;Being the forefather computer animated movies makes this movie important but what makes it a true masterpiece is that after all this years and countless of other animated films, Toy Story still holds up pretty well and is still one of the best animated films of all time.
I:8487;401;He is not only the favorite toy but also the leader of all the toys in Andy's room.
I:8487;402;Everyone looks up to him and he is both respected and admired.
I:8487;403;toy Story is such a pleasure to watch because it has an accesible interesting story and great characters.
I:8487;404;Woody and Buzz are excellent characters playing opposites and the rest of the toys are hilarious.
I:8487;405;John Lasseter and Co. truly created a special film.
I:8487;406;This is a true classic.
I:8487;407;Colors are well reproduced and you can spot a lot of things that were impossible to see on SD.
I:8487;408;Paths to Pixar: Artists an excellent featurette featuring Pixar's animators and how they started at Pixar.
I:8487;409;Buzz takes Manhattan features the Buzz ballon in the Thanksgiving Macy's parade.
I:8487;410;Black Friday: The Toy Story You Never Saw is an excellent piece where the filmmakers reflect on the original concept and how bad it was.
I:8487;411;A gallery and trailers close up the disc.
I:8487;412;closing Thoughts:Toy Story is very important in the animation world but it's also still relevant, hilarious, heartfelt and a true masterpiece.
I:8487;413;This BD features truly amazing video and audio and a lot of bonus material as such comes with THE HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!
I:8487;414;I would love this movie except that my son has watched it over and over again.
I:8487;415;Very good flick if you don't have it memorized.
I:8487;416;class cast of voice actors takes care of the rest.
I:8487;417;"Tom Hanks and Tim Allen deserve every bit of recognition they get for their roles as Woody and Buzz
I:8487;418;The animated film that brought CGI animated films to the forefront.
I:8487;419;Toy Story still holds up well regardless of it's cruder look by today's standards.
I:8487;420;It's funny, has great characters and has a nostalgic sentimental feel to it.
I:8487;421;the Blu Ray looks and sounds fantastic!
I:8487;422;Grandkids love it and I do too.
I:8487;423;it and Toy Story 2, Puss and Boots, etc all are great.
I:8487;424;I bought this movie for my 2 1/2 year old grandson and he loves it!
I:8487;425;This is my grandson's favorite movie!
I:8487;426;The other disc is good for our portable player.
I:8487;427;My grand kiddies love Toy Story and we have seen it countless times and will no doubt will it countless more times.
I:8487;428;I was happy for many reasons.1.
I:8487;429;A great movie, DISNEY/PIXARS 1st moive2.
I:8487;430;Has lots of great features!!!
I:8487;431;This is without a doubt, the best animated film, there is!I saw this classic in the movie theater, with my 5 year old,and we both loved it!
I:8487;432;Oh well, I'llhave to watch it on the vhs tape I have for now.
I:8487;433;this has been my favorite movie since i was 5 I had to own it and watch it whenever i want
I:8487;434;i also have a house full of merchandise to prove it.
I:8487;435;I ordered this movie for my 11 month daughter she loves it!
I:8487;436;I bought this as my 2 year old's first REAL movie and she LOVES it!
I:8487;437;about 90 minutes and she is captivated by all the toys.
I:8487;438;We all love this and consider it our top favorite kid's movie.
I:8487;439;This movie is the girls's favorite and that pleases us because we enjoy it as much as they do.
I:8487;440;our favorite characters are of course Woody and Buzz Lightyear.
I:8487;441;Now it's been a few years since I've been to the park and it was my nieces's first time.
I:8487;442;So you could imagine our surprise to see Disney characters on a lot of the rides now.
I:8487;443;It's a Small World had the most newly added Disney characters.
I:8487;444;And Woody, Jessie and Bullseye are some of the new additions to that ride.
I:8487;445;Us grown ups kind of rolled our eyes.
I:8487;446;It has always been a childhood memory in a movie that I enjoy re.
I:8487;447;and I got it half price on here.
I:8487;448;I actually bought it to watch with my kids, and they love it as much as I do.
I:8487;449;It definitely contains valuable lessons for children young and old, and maybe children will learn how to treat their toys better.
I:8487;450;In addition, I love a movie that can convey every emotion, from happy to sad to happy again.
I:8487;451;"And I'm sure that even if you're not into watching children movies or cartoons, you'll still enjoy what ""Toy Story"" has to offer."
I:8487;452;"And if you enjoy ""Toy Story"", you'll also fall in love with ""Monsters, Inc."", another Pixar creation."
I:8487;453;It arrived well within the alloted time frame and was well packaged.
I:8487;454;Will have happy grandchild on Christmas morning.
I:8487;455;Thanks once again Amazon, love shopping through you!
I:8487;456;If you have a young child this is the ultimate family film.
I:8487;457;I have an 8 year old girl and she has watched and loved this for years.
I:8487;458;I had seen it when it 1st came out on video because a teacher I had bought it for a family member on VHS and wanted to make sure the tape worked, so we got to watch it in class.
I:8487;459;I really enjoyed watching it when I saw it for the 1st time, and I knew that I had to get it.
I:8487;460;I would recommend this movie to all fans of the Disney/PIXAR films and to all fans of computer animated movies.
I:8487;461;I love this movie, you can't go wrong with any of the Toy story movies.
I:8487;462;Always watch with my kids and they are in they're 20s now, we still love it
I:8487;463;This is a great movie and the little one loved it.
I:8487;464;The discs and contents are the same, but if you prefer a certain case, make sure you order the correct one.
I:8487;465;ray transfer is GORGEOUS: crisp, clean, and perfect.
I:8487;466;ray discs he owns, this is the best.
I:8487;467;This is by far one of the best kid movies ever made.
I:8487;468;Great value for the price I paid.
I:8487;469;Not only that, but I believe it delivered a great message to all the viewers.
I:8487;470;Well, at least if they did understand the concept and put it to work.
I:8487;471;The movie had a great plot and also a well written quest for all the characters to go through.
I:8487;472;The friendship that Andy and the toys had was incredible.
I:8487;473;that's why I say that it delivered a great message.
I:8487;474;Because for one thing, it demonstrated the bond between plastic or stuffed toy and humankind.
I:8487;475;The creators gave it their all on this movie and they put forth the best to make us laugh in every scene possible!
I:8487;476;Like the part where Rex , my favorite, tells the piggybank he came from Mattel.
I:8487;477;and that's just what the creators did, they made the best possible to bring it to real life.
I:8487;478;The entire series of three movies is a timeless and classic story about friendship, trust, and love.
I:8487;479;it will forever be a favorite of families everywhere.
I:8487;480;similar Randy Newman music, lots of the same voices, similar chase scenes, but these Pixar films are good solid kids entertainment.
I:8487;481;Pixar also weaves content into films to promote other Pixar films .
I:8487;482;I saw this movie a few years ago and I decided to show this movie to my toddler.
I:8487;483;She loved the colors, but was not as happy to see it as I was.
I:8487;484;My three year old saw this movie for the first time and is hooked.
I:8487;485;A great addition to our collection
I:8487;486;the Toy Story movies are a great value at anything under $20 imo.
I:8487;487;My kids can watch either movie once a day for a week straight and still be entertained.
I:8487;488;So I had the chance to see all the tech details of this production.
I:8487;489;The story is also a fine piece of work.
I:8487;490;it gives me more than24.48 hrs to watch I and it's just on of the best pixar films ever made :)
I:8487;491;I gave my 3 year old this movie for X. mas and she loves it.
I:8487;492;She watches it all the time.
I:8487;493;She learned all the charecters names.
I:8487;494;She thinks it is so excited when Woody and Buzz chase after the moving van.
I:8487;495;This is a great movie for all kids.
I:8487;496;it's a lovely heartfelt movie about accepting change and coming together with the people you find yourself with.
I:8487;497;This is a great movie for kids and adults.
I:8487;498;Watched this movie with my two year old granddaughter and thoroughly enjoyed it.
I:8487;499;This is my all time favorite!
I:8487;500;Characters are clear and crisp.
I:8487;501;I don't care who you are, you will enjoy it on some level.
I:8487;502;This series is perfect for girls and boys.
I:8487;503;I recieved the movie in a timely manner and it was, as advertised, new and still in it's shrink wrap.
I:8487;504;"Computer animation has advanced much in ten years, but ""Toy Story"" is still a true masterpiece for the entire family."
I:8487;505;A true visual treat to watch and featuring a strongly absorbing plot.
I:8487;506;Woody, a cowboy, is a toy that has been a boy, Andy's favorite for many years.
I:8487;507;Buzz Lightyear has wings, glows in the dark, has an electronic voicebox and even karate chop action.
I:8487;508;The film features several great songs .
I:8487;509;"(All composed and performed by Randy Newman, with Lyle Lovett joining on the closing credits version of ""Friend in Me."")"
I:8487;510;another great special feature is Randy Newman Demos for all of the songs in the film.
I:8487;511;There are more special features as well, but I'll let these be a surprise.
I:8487;512;On top of all of that, here's a great feature that's really rare .
I:8487;513;all special features are fully close.
I:8487;514;Received in a timely manner.
I:8487;515;Toy Story is a great movie for all ages.
I:8487;516;I would refer to it as a new century classic.
I:8487;517;Combine all that with possibly one of the best movies of all time and you got yourself a treat.
I:8487;518;It's perfect for any Toy Story fan.
I:8487;519;I recommened it to everyone!
I:8487;520;The real icing on the cake here folks is that Pixar/Disney are including a DTS.
I:8487;521;I loved this movie when it first came out, and I still watch it time to time.
I:8487;522;"Reach For The Sky""Toy Story"" is an excellent fun."
I:8487;523;filled adventure, for kids of all ages.
I:8487;524;Throughout the film they compete for their owner Andy's affection.
I:8487;525;stop action packed adventure, with a thrilling climax.
I:8487;526;Toy story is a film I enjoy watching over and over agian.
I:8487;527;I would recommend this product.
I:8487;528;Entertaining for kids and adults too.
I:8487;529;This a movie classic that everyone should have to watch for the family.
I:8487;530;It may be dated but the kids continue to love it every time they watch it.
I:8487;531;Disney put plenty of adult moments in this to attract adult viewers.
I:8487;532;Very funny and can watch over and over especially my autistic son.
I:8487;533;Its a wonderful little movie my grandson watches it @ least 4 times a day.
I:8487;534;This is a fabulous movie.
I:8487;535;It has everything going for it, a great storyline, great acting, great animation!
I:8487;536;issue of this 1995 classic.
I:8487;537;I've listened to a lot of Audio Commentary tracks (you watch the movie, and they are commenting while the movie is in progress about what's happening) and I really enjoyed this one.
I:8487;538;"As Bonnie says, the movie's ""songs actually told about an emotional moment in the film, [rather than] the character singing about those things."""
I:8487;539;It's a shortcut, and very effective, for giving the audience all the background it needs to understand what happens when Buzz Lightyear interlopes.
I:8487;540;the movie has a mix of real.
I:8487;541;and speaking of soldiers, I think we all love the green plastic soldiers, marching while attached to their little stands.
I:8487;542;Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs: Episode 1: Blast Off (3:27) This is a great little introduction to the space shuttle and space station, with lots of real on.
I:8487;543;"Because it was my job to mess up everything that was created so perfectly in the films""."
I:8487;544;Studio Stories: John's Car (1:27) The three studio stories are great.
I:8487;545;They are like storyboard clip reels with cute simple graphics.
I:8487;546;A J tells how he won the Halloween costume contest one year.
I:8487;547;Truly above and beyond the call of duty!
I:8487;548;And then the racing got very fierce.
I:8487;549;Very funny short, narrated by Pete Doctor and Andrew Stanton.8.
I:8487;550;Black Friday: The Toy Story You never Saw (7:36) This extra makes the Special Edition totally worth it.
I:8487;551;"Disney kept wanting multiple changes, and, in particular, Jeffrey Katzenberg ""would rip them apart""."
I:8487;552;He wanted the story more edgy, more cynical and more adult.
I:8487;553;the way they thought Disney wanted it.
I:8487;554;"Lassiter cringes and covers his face in his hands as he introduces part of the reel that was showed Disney on what they dubbed ""Black Friday""."
I:8487;555;spirited and something you might see on [adult swim], but not a Pixar.
I:8487;556;"In two weeks, in a giant collective of brains and enthusiasm, PIxar totally redid ""Toy Story"" the way they wanted it, and came up with the start of the movie that we now know and love."
I:8487;557;great extras for a movie that is timeless.
I:8487;558;A classic Pixar film that stands the test of time.
I:8487;559;I enjoyed it about as much as my son.
I:8487;560;A cute movie and a hit with our kids but I was unpleasantly surprised with some of the name calling on a G rated movie.
I:8487;561;My neice and nephew love this movie and will watch it for days!
I:8487;562;I always got the 2nd one and they go crazy!
I:8487;563;My daughters, my wife and I, we love the toy storie movies, really fun for the family, I recommend to anyone
I:8487;564;I am thrilled with the price I paid for both movies.
I:8487;565;My son loves the movies!
I:8487;566;The shipping was super fast and very curteous.
I:8487;567;It's excellent and delivers a powerful message for those who like the kind of movie that has a heart for every age.
I:8487;568;Thank you for your video.
I:8487;569;I received it in a good amount of time and I truly enjoyed it
I:8487;570;Since this Disney movie came out when I was a kid I've always loved it.
I:8487;571;I can wait until I have kids so that they can enjoy this movie as much as I have.
I:8487;572;Removable top and back blu.
I:8487;573;She loves this movie and wants to watch it every day.
I:8487;574;The shipping was also done very fast.
I:8487;575;I avoided this film for nearly 2 decades.
I:8487;576;An animated film built around those action figures.
I:8487;577;I've got to give it to Pixar for that detail .
I:8487;578;Recently began using Amazon Instant Play and Im impressed.
I:8487;579;My kids love it as well.
I:8487;580;Wonderful movie for kids and adults.
I:8487;581;Such a sweet movie and even has a decent storyline and moral.
I:8487;582;One of my favorite movies!
I:8487;583;Disney and Pixar's Toy Story was the first full.
I:8487;584;The Walt Disney Gold Collection is a group of films that inspire wonder and imagination for a life time, and Toy Story fits that description perfectly!Have you ever had a favorite toy?
I:8487;585;I am very happy with my order and video!
I:8487;586;It's a timeless classic that has enthralled all of my neices and nephews as well as my own children.
I:8487;587;Oh this movie is so good I will put 4.9 stars on this movie.
I:8487;588;OMG, a cleverly written story, full of imagination and a brilliant theme.
I:8487;589;It touches the imagination of children AND adults.
I:8487;590;It truly is a favorite of mine.
I:8487;591;everything about this movie is so good.
I:8487;592;about toys having a life of their own, goes perfectly with the animation.
I:8487;593;the bond that is formed between woody and buzz reminds me alot of some of the friendships i had growing up.
I:8487;594;i would not only recommend this to any child i saw on the street, but also any fun loving adult.
I:8487;595;also check out toy story 2, and the upcoming (hopefully) toy story 3 from pixar.
I:8487;596;My kid equally loves Toy Story and Cars.
I:8487;597;The sound is much improved.
I:8487;598;They have really made this movie shine.
I:8487;599;if you are a disney fan this is a must own.
I:8487;600;If you own the previous versions to me 16 dollars is worth picking up this edition.
I:8487;601;I guarantee if you like Disney and pixar movies this is the movie to get.
I:8487;602;Love all the Toy Story movies!
I:8487;603;They are great for all ages and have awesome animation!
I:8487;604;I was really the perfect age for the Toy Story films, they were in a lot of ways my big cultural touchstones growing up.
I:8487;605;To see Toy Story again after so many years is in a lot of ways a nostalgia trip and a remembrance to my childhood.
I:8487;606;The film is a landmark in the animation field, the first feature.
I:8487;607;It is a technical masterpiece, and a guiding light to the modern era.
I:8487;608;In a lot of ways, its also very deep.
I:8487;609;Buzz Lightyear has to come to grips with the fact that he is a toy, showing all of us children that we must find a place in the world.
I:8487;610;It is probably one of Pixar's greatest films and continues to be a favorite of children today.
I:8487;611;As cultural icons, the characters of Toy Story live on, and Pixar's work will be forever judged to the Toy Story series.
I:8487;612;They are remarkable films and tremendously moving.
I:8487;613;So far the Pixar films look fantastic on Blu.
I:8487;614;I own both Toy Story movies, Cars, Up, and Wall.
I:8487;615;e. All the transfers are first rate and will show off your Hi.
I:8487;616;The Toy Story movies are 2 of the best in the Pixar franchise.
I:8487;617;Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are fantastic as the voices of the lead characters, and the stories themselves are fun for all ages.
I:8487;618;"There are even some jokes that only adults would understand (""He has laser envy"") but the funny lines are fast and furious to keep the attention focused for everyone."
I:8487;619;One of my favorite characters is the neurotic dinosaur toy but they are all great and have distinctive personalities.
I:8487;620;Great view on the PSP, and my four year old son loves it.
I:8487;621;This is an instant hit with my kids.
I:8487;622;It makes for interesting conversation to say the least.
I:8487;623;I've even found my kids talking to their toys .
I:8487;624;just to see if they will come alive.
I:8487;625;great animation, great for all ages.
I:8487;626;All the relevant human emotions surface in the toys.
I:8487;627;"The ""human"" toys have one adventure after another, inside the house and out."
I:8487;628;Toy Story is a movie that appeals to any age.
I:8487;629;There are jokes that only adults would understand and the animation appeals to younger audiences.
I:8487;630;It is a classic movie good for all ages.
I:8487;631;This are the words to describe a children's classic that I still watch as a 21 year old.
I:8487;632;Toy Story is classic Pixar, entertaining for both kids and adults.
I:8487;633;Great Package, great movie but.
I:8487;634;Her other tape got eaten by the machine.
I:8487;635;She loves it and the tape arrived sooner than expected in excellent condition.
I:8487;636;Great computer animation, great voice acting, and a solid story.
I:8487;637;This movie is a must have for young and old alike.
I:8487;638;The whole family will enjoy this movie as does ours.
I:8487;639;My kids owned it and loved it.
I:8487;640;Bought for my grandbabies and they love it too.
I:8487;641;Just a very cute story for the babies.
I:8487;642;My daughter didn't like the Toy Story movies when she was in the infant stages, but loves it now in her toddler stage!
I:8487;643;I love all the things Pixar has done, so why not collect them.
I:8487;644;This one is perfect ,no damage and good price, it also completes the Toy Story set or is there a fourth story on the horizon?
I:8487;645;This movie is cute, adorable and an awesome film for all to watch!
I:8487;646;Disney and Pixar did an excellent job!
I:8487;647;I absolutely adore this movie!
I:8487;648;I have probably seen this movie a dozen times or more and each time it's like I'm discovering it for the first time.
I:8487;649;Pixar's specialty seems to be making great children's movies that still resonate with adults and Toy Story definitely does that.
I:8487;650;Definitely a great film for people of all ages.
I:8487;651;Such a cute fun film.
I:8487;652;All other movies play just fine.
I:8487;653;This is a great movie for the whole family to watch together!
I:8487;654;My four year old loves this movie, I was excited to see a great price and came in perfect condition, speedily (a new word :)
I:8487;655;I loved it when it first came out and my kid loves it now.
I:8487;656;I bought it new or so I thought.
I:8487;657;This movie is one of my son's favorites.
I:8487;658;He loves to see the toys come to life and the movie provides lasting entertainment long after it's over when he plays with his own toysl
I:8487;659;I am gifting it to my grandson and I think it will be terrific
I:8487;660;The beginning of an era thanks to Lukas Films, Steve Jobs, Disney and Lasseter (et.
I:8487;661;An amazingly clever animated story that keeps my 2 yr old, interested from start to finish.
I:8487;662;You're child will love the animation and you will love seeing the creative ways your old childhood toys are used to create a great story.
I:8487;663;The sequel is equally good, get them both, you'll enjoy something new everytime you watch them.
I:8487;664;My 2 year old loves Toy Story!
I:8487;665;The picture was very good now we are going to get Toy Story 2 and 3
I:8487;666;I little scary for my 3 year old, but he liked it.
I:8487;667;Remembering how much I enjoyed Toy Story when it first came out, I imagined that it would be something my son would enjoy just as much.
I:8487;668;The Blu Ray transfer of the movie is fantastic!
I:8487;669;That's important because Toy Story has a great soundtrack composed by Randy Newman.
I:8487;670;an integral part of the movie.
I:8487;671;There are lots of special features worth watching as well.
I:8487;672;Thanks Amazon for having a great price on the package.
I:8487;673;Great family movie fun for all ages every one will love it, entertaining, funny, cute, fun, like able colorful.
I:8487;674;It is the best kids movie I've ever seen.
I:8487;675;The animation, humor and creativity are spot on.
I:8487;676;Tom Hanks is my favorite
I:8487;677;in this film Woody gets left behind at a gas station and eventually gets captured by the mean kid across the street Sid and Buzz has to overcome the fact that he's a child's play toy to rescue Woody who is strapped to a rocket!Overall a very good way to kick off the Toy Story franchise, with many more to come!
I:8487;678;I bought it for my niece and she just loves it.
I:8487;679;I would recommend it to friends.
I:8487;680;Toy Story is great for one and all no matter how young or just young at heart.
I:8487;681;One of the best movies ever made.
I:8487;682;Missed Bo in the other two movies.
I:8487;683;Wow, the time does fly.
I:8487;684;I have always been a huge fan of the Toy Story series, they are SMART, FUNNY, and overall amazing.
I:8487;685;"It's wonderful that they are ""Officially"" Re."
I:8487;686;The movie is amazing and its on Blu.
I:8487;687;This was such a big hit when it first came out and I loved it.
I:8487;688;"Even the added ""deleted"" scenes are just in storyboard fun ."
I:8487;689;wow, that's exciting to a kid.
I:8487;690;Great for adult movie buffs but for kids, it's a real snooze.
I:8487;691;The sequel to this movie was very good in filling in the back stories of the toys (Woody was a spin.
I:8487;692;off toy from a popular old TV series), and it individualized them.
I:8487;693;this is a real kid's movie without any adult.
I:8487;694;"When viewed with the second in the series, it provides some fun viewing because there's so much growth in ""Toy Story 2."""
I:8487;695;The story is very funny but also teaches a lot of good values to kids and adults, like loyalty work team and friendship.
I:8487;696;Tom Hanks Tim Allen and Don Rickels were perfect for those parts.
I:8487;697;The other characters worked well too.
I:8487;698;Toy Story, the landmark movie that ushered animation into the computer age, is still a bona fide family classic.
I:8487;699;and funny as all get.
I:8487;700;This superb package brings it all back, both the movie itself and an Al's Toy Barn full of bonuses.
I:8487;701;theater outfits, but this digital print shows off some great color, with the various toy characters in pristine, bright glory.
I:8487;702;Best of all, you don't need a 50.
I:8487;703;dolby amp to enjoy this newer.
I:8487;704;the movie, of course, introduced a new, innovative animation outfit called Pixar to the world.
I:8487;705;"Woody and Buzz Lightyear, of course, are icons to kids of all ages, but all the other members of the ""Andy's Room"" community were great."
I:8487;706;a combination of buddy comedy, toy fair, sci.
I:8487;707;fi flick and domestic sitcom (to name a few elements) is, in its own way, as multi.
I:8487;708;layered and satisfying as the most mature adult dramas.
I:8487;709;"disc 1 has both the movie and a new feature with both the Pixar team and a few others (Chris ""Robots"" Wedge, George Lucas, Roy Disney) offering their views on what ""Toy Story"" did to transform the entire animation genre."
I:8487;710;It's Disc 2, however, that has the goods.
I:8487;711;a couple of dozen features, clips and art galleries that literally break down the walls and give both the kid/family core crowd and the animation scholar a remarkable look at how much effort goes into this sort of film.
I:8487;712;The fact that Pixar and the CGI form themselves were in their infancy at the time only enhances just what great craftsmen these people are.
I:8487;713;voice (and he's a fantastic piano player!)
I:8487;714;"Toy Story is simple enough to be an ideal choice for a ""child's first movie"" yet sophisticated enough to give the serious cineaste plenty to study."
I:8487;715;It's as witty as the best literate comedies and as warm as an old.
I:8487;716;drawer stars could also be great voice actors, and it entered a child's world with a fresh, not.
I:8487;717;movie toy creations are a show in themselves)in a great show of kids with personality.
I:8487;718;And it established Pixar as the flagship of animated features.
I:8487;719;again, it's incredible that this was their first!
I:8487;720;deluxe edition, is a must for any animation buff, family with kids, or just about anyone who loves movies.
I:8487;721;"great sequel (dare I say the ""Godfather"" and ""Godfather II"" of animation?)"
I:8487;722;"With any luck, ""Toy Story"" will be one of the best."
I:8487;723;loved movies ever, to infinity.
I:8487;724;It is excellent for both children and adults.
I:8487;725;Furthermore, it contains humor, a great plot, and loveable characters.
I:8487;726;Will probably end up being made into a purse.
I:8487;727;From a secular point of view this was a very well made movie.
I:8487;728;Totally entertaining for kids and adults.
I:8487;729;This is a classic movie.
I:8487;730;Great for kids and adults, I remember watching it as a teenager when it first came out, now my toddler loves it!
I:8487;731;My kid watched it for about 20 minutes, which is great, but I wanted to finish watching it and he wouldn't let me.
I:8487;732;Love this movie, great characters, and justfun to watch with family.
I:8487;733;A classic movie and still a winner with the Pre School set.
I:8487;734;My family and I love the Toy Story movie.
I:8487;735;I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone.
I:8487;736;This is an excellent family film.
I:8487;737;Fun, excitement, laughter, tears, and values.
I:8487;738;She reallyenjoyed it and likes many of the characters.
I:8487;739;The Toy Story series is becoming a family tradition.
I:8487;740;So glad I ordered it .
I:8487;741;great price, delivery and packaging.
I:8487;742;A friend needed this for a last minute gift for her granddaughter.
I:8487;743;Arrived on time with 4 days to spare for Christmas.
I:8487;744;She has already watched it several times.
I:8487;745;My children 4yo, 2yo, and 9mo loves this movie (even I love it).
I:8487;746;Overall it's a good movie
I:8487;747;With a sharp mind for robotics, mathematics and Solomon.
I:8487;748;He restores harmony to his colony of robots much to the delight of his son.
I:8487;749;strangely this film was animated, making it appealing for children only.
I:8487;750;Best a cgi kids movie of all time.
I:8487;751;Such a great movie for the family.
I:8487;752;I loved this movie as a child growing up in the 90s and now my 4 year old gets to appreciate this series as well.
I:8487;753;"The extras of the movies are ""whatever"", but the ""Toy Story"" story is fantastic."
I:8487;754;plays fine in my VCR, My grandkids love it and the price was right.
I:8487;755;It's a cute story although a little frightening in places for small children.
I:8487;756;Great movie for boys and girls of all ages.
I:8487;757;Bought it for my daughter and she wants to watch it right after we finished it.
I:8487;758;Definitely would recommend to family and friends.
I:8487;759;It is a family movie.
I:8487;760;"it also has wonderful bonus features including ""The Making Of Toy Story"",which is the first ever Toy Story making of featurete,which explains how they thought up all the charectors including Woody and Buzz!The plot of this film is awesome,with a touch of friendship lesson in it!The movie is about a cowboy doll named Woody."
I:8487;761;"time,and at the end,they become best friends for a lifetime!Any Disney/Pixar fan will enjoy this movie and the bonus features!As Buzz would say,""To Infinity,And Beyond!"""
I:8487;762;This movie is a classic, at least as far as the Disney Pixar movies go.
I:8487;763;It's funny to watch it now, and discover how far the Pixar animation technology has come in just a few years.
I:8487;764;Anyway, the story is clever, lots of humor for kids and grown.
I:8487;765;gave it 5 stars because its worth it.
I:8487;766;this movie is great for all aged kids.
I:8487;767;Everyone reading this review knows the film so I will just discuss the Disc itself.
I:8487;768;The colors are bright and the details are amazing.
I:8487;769;The picture is perfect because it comes straight from the details source.
I:8487;770;If you Pixar films you will love this Blu RAy of the film that started it all.
I:8487;771;I love it, and it came just as described.
I:8487;772;He managed to send Buzz flying out of Andy's bedroom window.
I:8487;773;this is truly a masterpiece!
I:8487;774;The animation is really beautiful!

I:8487;777;My two year old loves to watch the cowboy movie.
I:8487;778;A classic movie for all ages.
I:8487;779;This video is so much fun and marks the tenth year of Toy Story being out.
I:8487;780;"I think Toy Story will become a ""timeless treasure"" because it is great for adults as well as kids."
I:8487;781;Woody, Buzz and the gang are a joy for both adults and children alike!
I:8487;782;"I enjoyed it so much I went out and bought all them of the ""Toy Story movies""."
I:8487;783;The toys are great, the graphics and scenery is too.

I:8487;790;This is a great movie.
I:8487;791;Thanks to my three year old now we own all of them.
I:8487;792;Toy Story is excellent and not just for kids.
I:8487;793;I recommend all three movies for everyone.
I:8487;794;The first is the start of a wonderful series.
I:8487;795;Toy story is a classic kids movie that adults enjoy watching as well.
I:8487;796;My children and I loved this movie.
I:8487;797;I thought it was very well animated.
I:8487;798;Disney is terrific in pleasing a child.
I:8487;799;This movie can easily keep a childs attention.
I:8487;800;My children watch it over and over again, even my 11 and 12 year old sons love it.
I:8487;801;It will make you laugh and might even make you cry.
I:8487;802;I think Disney gets better and better with their movies and this one is definately a must see!!
I:8487;803;"Always check the ""manufacturer's"" description on these products."
I:8487;804;great work on this very funny story.
I:8487;805;smart phone, smart TV, video console, etc. and you can have upto 3 differnt technologies streaming from Amazon (so long as they are not the same movie).

I:8487;809;My son loves this movie.
I:8487;810;It is a great story.

I:8487;812;This is a great movie each time I watch it with my grandsons, we laugh at every scene.
I:8487;813;It is a great movie about friendship.
I:8487;814;price comparable to stores .
I:8487;815;liked the fact I didn't have tro leave house to shop
I:8487;816;My grandchildren had seen Toy Story and loved it so much, I knew they wanted it for keeps.
I:8487;817;So as part of their Christmas gift, I bought this and the other two.
I:8487;818;My grandson had the 3rd edition first, but now he loves this one the best.
I:8487;819;It arrived on time and in perfect condition.
I:8487;820;He calls them by color!

I:8487;825;I got them as a Christmas gift for a friend and she loved them!
I:8487;826;They usually cost about $20 in store, so this was a great deal.
I:8487;827;But other than that, it was great.

I:8487;829;The characters are extremely likeable, cute, very funny.

I:8487;834;Toy Story is the most innovative and technologically advanced cartoon movie I have ever seen.
I:8487;835;I was constantly intrigued by the detail and coloration of the characters and background.
I:8487;836;Every scene was filled with imaginative fun and adventure.
I:8487;837;Pixar effectively chose two wonderful actors for the voices of the main characters, Woody, an old.
I:8487;838;fashioned cowboy doll, and Buzz Lightyear, a high.
I:8487;839;Director John Lasseter creates a wonderful combination of a comical and adventurous plot.
I:8487;840;This movie is fantastic for all audiences and I recommend it to everyone.
I:8487;841;A wonderful movie for all ages!
I:8487;842;Great movie for both adults and kids .
I:8487;843;"Pixar does great work
I:8487;844;I love all 3 movies.
I:8487;845;especially since my grandson loves them all.
I:8487;846;Amazing how they never grow old.
I:8487;847;3 yr son, 5 yr old cousin loved it!

I:8487;849;it was so funny i laughed my butt off it is a must see again and again great job !
I:8487;850;He tells him mommy .

I:8487;1134;Toy Story 1, 2 and 3 are all wonderful movies worth watching over and over.
I:8487;1135;I have been wanting to see this great movie again for a long time.
I:8487;1136;Thanks Amazon for having it available.
I:8487;1137;This is one of the recent classics in animated film.
I:8487;1138;Great for children of all ages and adults TOO.
I:8487;1139;This was a good movie with very memorable characters.
I:8487;1140;There were also little parts here and there that were quite entertaining.
I:8487;1141;"I found Sid to be a very interesting ""villain"" in this movie, being somewhat of a troubled kid with a love of destroying toys."
I:8487;1142;overall, I'd say this is a fantastic family movie, and a good movie if you like Pixar animation, although it made me strangely gentle with my toys.
I:8487;1143;I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since.
I:8487;1144;It has a great storyline.
I:8487;1145;Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, Rocky and many more.
I:8487;1146;The case was in good condition as well.
I:8487;1147;pleasure doing business with them!
I:8487;1148;I love this movie and so does my 2 year old son.
I:8487;1149;love the characters and storyline.
I:8487;1150;My little one enjoys it along with the older siblings that get the chance to remember their days with Woody and Buzz.
I:8487;1151;around good movie with fun realistic animation and a decent plot .
I:8487;1152;keeps kids engrossed and holds adults attention too.
I:8487;1153;I sat through a number of mediocre cartoon movies but, occassionally, I got to see a movie that we all really enjoyed.
I:8487;1154;This movie is the ideal family movie because it can be enjoyed by every age group.
I:8487;1155;Older children can pick up on the jealosies and competition.
I:8487;1156;Everyone will enjoy the humor and there's plenty of excitement and suspense as well.
I:8487;1157;The art work is very good but the best part are the actors whose voices we hear.
I:8487;1158;From the beginning to the end the movie is entertaining.
I:8487;1159;Thanks to Randy Newman, it even has good music as well.
I:8487;1160;the movie is so good, that is why Disney bought people .
I:8487;1161;I enjoyed it and my grandchildren did too.
I:8487;1162;"In fact, the 2 year old, who is still learning to talk, has been saying ""Woody"" all day everyday since we watched it together."
I:8487;1163;A great movie for both kids and adults, definitely worth the investment.
I:8487;1164;Most of the Pixar films are gems and Toy Story is the one that started it all.
I:8487;1165;Love the characters and the story.
I:8487;1166;A one of a kind movie that will be a classic for years to come.
I:8487;1167;We watch the movies all the time, and love the humor
I:8487;1168;But it still play good.
I:8487;1169;This is a good product
I:8487;1170;and the guys who did it still seem like a nice bunch of people.
I:8487;1171;The supplements are very interesting fleshing out things I had heard about early problems with Disney.
I:8487;1172;This beautifully crafted work of art is now better then it was before.
I:8487;1173;it was so great to see again.
I:8487;1174;It is one of the most entertaing, heart warming, and fun movies ever made.
I:8487;1175;It is just as much fun for child and adult.
I:8487;1176;Everybody has their favorite character.
I:8487;1177;This is a really fun movie to watch with the grandkids.
I:8487;1178;Classic story with drama, lots of humor (even adults love it), great voices and fantastic colorful animation in every frame!
I:8487;1179;Pretty good movie for a child to watch.
I:8487;1180;I remember watching this movie on VHS when I was a kid.
I:8487;1181;"ray"" pack with this version in it."
I:8487;1182;All the toys are preparing for the Big Move to a new house, making sure everyone has a moving buddy and no one gets left behind.
I:8487;1183;When Woody accidentally gets Buzz knocked over into the yard of the sociopath kid next door, he's got to do a daring rescue.
I:8487;1184;Toy Story's great animation, music, and fun for all ages.
I:8487;1185;i highly recommend this seller
I:8487;1186;Buzz Lightyear is awesome as is Woody.
I:8487;1187;The actors who are the voices of these characters are excellent.
I:8487;1188;His father likes it to!
I:8487;1189;The perfect story structure and incredible characters, this film's cast is a cavalcade of stars.
I:8487;1190;All I can say is, these entire line is amazing.
I:8487;1191;Watching it as an adult.
I:8487;1192;It was still a good funny movie, just not as funny as I remembered it being.
I:8487;1193;My son is obsessed with this movie!
I:8487;1194;great not to have to constantly rewind now too!
I:8487;1195;This is a great classic movie for children of all ages.
I:8487;1196;The toys always looked terrific, no matter what release format we were watching, but now.
I:8487;1197;The audio offers much sharper detail, a truer, more up.
I:8487;1198;front sound and wider dynamic and frequency ranges.
I:8487;1199;It's as if someone took window cleaner and polished up the whole presentation.
I:8487;1200;This movie is a classic and a masterpiece.
I:8487;1201;I bought it as a gift and the receiver loved it!
I:8487;1202;This edition also has a lot of neat bonus stuff.
I:8487;1203;I would definitely recommend this movie!
I:8487;1204;It's the first and may it may be the best of all the Pixar movies, After 15 years it holds up very well.
I:8487;1205;Love this movie we watch it 3 times in 3 days.
I:8487;1206;this is a great family movie and very funny.
I:8487;1207;An entire movie created out of CGI.
I:8487;1208;first, the film is 5 stars.
I:8487;1209;An absolute masterpiece in every way.
I:8487;1210;The characters are surprisingly real, even when there's nothing real about them, except for the wonderful voice.
I:8487;1211;Tim Allen and Tom Hanks are absoutely wonderful as Buzz Lightyear and Woody.
I:8487;1212;The rest of the cast is perfect as well.
I:8487;1213;One of the best children, no, movies off all time.
I:8487;1214;the two disc 10th Anniversary set includes a number of great extras.
I:8487;1215;"Deleted scenes, a couple of nice featurettes, and a video game ""The Claw"" are packed in this wondeful set."
I:8487;1216;One of the most heartfelt movies of all time.
I:8487;1217;Makes you remember all the toys you had as a kid and wished you kept them with you.
I:8487;1218;A Great movie for the whole family.
I:8487;1219;He knows the English Version by heart.
I:8487;1220;So he understands the Spanish Version.
I:8487;1221;I was very impressed that this Spanish dubbing was so well done, including the songs.
I:8487;1222;We have watched the movie a couple of times already and have thoroughly enjoyed this version.
I:8487;1223;I would highly recommend this version to anyone who speaks Spanish or wants to learn.
I:8487;1224;Your little ones will love you for it.
I:8487;1225;For less than $15 you can keep them occupied and happy for multiple hours weekly.
I:8487;1226;toy Story 2My kids liked Toy Story 2 even more.
I:8487;1227;This is a very fun childrens movie my son loves it so much.
I:8487;1228;Its a fun idea to think your toys have there own fun lives they live and would do anything to stay by your side!
I:8487;1229;"Our three year old was hooked on Toy Story Two and our ""One"" was a tape that had broken."
I:8487;1230;"out as it is ""our"" new favorite."
I:8487;1231;I loved it as a child and so does my 6 month old son.
I:8487;1232;Definitely will always be a classic.
I:8487;1233;I loved this movie when I was a little girl and my son loves it now!
I:8487;1234;Good kids movie, I remember watching this as a kid and now my kids watch and love this movie, all though they could of done with out 2 and 3
I:8487;1235;This is a classic movie that all ages can enjoy.
I:8487;1236;This is one of the classic computer animated movies by Disney.
I:8487;1237;Iconic, fun, full of laughs.
I:8487;1238;Toy Story was a great movie.
I:8487;1239;and Toy Story 2 is just as good.
I:8487;1240;Wow, now here's an animated film that is amazing on many fronts.
I:8487;1241;The technological achievement in the computer generation is facinating.
I:8487;1242;But best of all is the true character of the story.
I:8487;1243;It's hillarious, fun, and intelligently witty.
I:8487;1244;The story has elements of real issues (jealousy, guilt, love) synthesized in an entertaining film.
I:8487;1245;I highly recommend this picture for both children and adults alike.
I:8487;1246;This movie is a classic and I remember this as a child and now my daughter loves these movies!
I:8487;1247;It can be enjoyed by children, but it's not just a children's movie.
I:8487;1248;This is a very cute movie about friendship that should be in everyones collection.
I:8487;1249;"The story is great for the kids, but the adults in the family will love the ""in"" jokes that go over the head of the little ones."
I:8487;1250;i love this movie and so does my wife and son which why i bought it in the first place.
I:8487;1251;My son just turned 4 and he loves the movie.
I:8487;1252;He now plays with his Mr. PotatoHead everyday since watching this movie!!
I:8487;1253;The movie arrive in perfect condition and fast after ordering.
I:8487;1254;I bought this for my grandson he likes it.
I:8487;1255;He just went to Disneyland and so he loves Woody.
I:8487;1256;I had fun watching it with him.
I:8487;1257;Was fast, and in great shape, play well, my kids love toy story, Good price, it was boxed up good
I:8487;1258;An important contemporary classic for every child.
I:8487;1259;Love the characters, love the story, love the humor.
I:8487;1260;We never tire of this wonderful film for all ages.
I:8487;1261;I'm an adult without children and I adored this film.
I:8487;1262;This is a great film for children.
I:8487;1263;as an adult, I find these characters absolutely adorable and the movie is just an overall entertaining experience.
I:8487;1264;this is a great movie i love it well done i love tom hanks he does such a great job
I:8487;1265;It was great to re.
I:8487;1266;Toy Story is an all time classic.
I:8487;1267;the film was really ahead of it's time and gave us something very unique.
I:8487;1268;it was a film that kids and adults both could enjoy.
I:8487;1269;toy story is the best cg movie ever i love pixar i hope toy storey 3 is as good as the first 2
I:8487;1270;this film set the benchmark for computer animated films when it was released in 1995 and it still looks good today.
I:8487;1271;The story is simple and the characters are marvellous.
I:8487;1272;Whoever thought of the idea that Buzz Lightyear could be a toy who believes he really is a Space Ranger deserved an Oscar.
I:8487;1273;Its a brilliantly conceived idea, which has a funny and at times touching script.
I:8487;1274;its also worth mentioning the that the songs are by Randy Newman, a vastly underrated musician and songwriter, whose Uncles wrote the music for some the great Hollywood movies of the 40's and 50's.
I:8487;1275;In my opinion Toy Story 2 is even better than this one .
I:8487;1276;The viewing was very simple and will use the process again the next time the kids are in town!
I:8487;1277;"It is expected to have interviews with the original actors, also includes a nice ""roundtable discussion"" with the movie's creaters including the Disrector (John Lasseter)as well as writers, as well as an amzing behind the scenes making of featurette."
I:8487;1278;Deleted scenes, New games, music videos, audio commentaries, and much more!
I:8487;1279;This has to be the greatest kids all.
I:8487;1280;"It also brought animation from the ""cutie."
I:8487;1281;The characters are rich, three dimensional(Most are .
I:8487;1282;cowboy character Jessie, and while it is also very successful it just never reaches the freshness found in the original TOY STORY.
I:8487;1283;Toy Story is an all time favorite for many children and adults everywhere.
I:8487;1284;Anytime I mention this movie to anyone they love and remember it so well.
I:8487;1285;I can watch it over and over again it just gives me a fun feeling, and gives me that child at heart feeling for the rest of the day.
I:8487;1286;It's just so much fun to sit and watch with the kids.
I:8487;1287;It's a classic, good for all ages, it never gets old.
I:8487;1288;I can watch this all the time, the humor is great
I:8487;1289;My 2 year old also loves it.
I:8487;1290;I would definitely recommend this for the whole family!
I:8487;1291;And to top that its a 10 anniversary edition.
I:8487;1292;Delivered fast and works great :)
I:8487;1293;And some screnes there is humor.
I:8487;1294;As the movie opens, Woody (Hanks) is loved by a boy named Andy (John Morris) until he gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear (Allen) and Woody gets envy of Buzz and acciently knocks him out of the window.
I:8487;1295;I loved Toy Story as a kid and I love that I can share this with my son.
I:8487;1296;The Toy Story movies just get better and better but I've got a special place in my heart for the first one.
I:8487;1297;Great for kids and adults.
I:8487;1298;For the first time in cinematic history, a feature.
I:8487;1299;and the results were spectacular.
I:8487;1300;Thanks to the fertile imagination of the Pixar animators, Woody and Buzz have become beloved staples in the pop culture landscape.
I:8487;1301;One toy in particular becomes the center of attention in the household .
I:8487;1302;Toy Story is dazzling to look at.
I:8487;1303;"Yet, what makes ""Toy Story"" truly special is its clever script."
I:8487;1304;The dialogue is sharp from start to finish and the situations the characters find themselves in are wonderfully amusing.
I:8487;1305;The voice work is also strong across the board as Allen, Hanks, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, and Annie Potts all distinguish themselves.
I:8487;1306;"The greatest triumph of ""Toy Story"" though is its ability to appeal both to youngsters and adults."
I:8487;1307;The characters will keep the kids smiling while the nostalgia generated by the Andy's affection for his beloved toys will remind grown.
I:8487;1308;ups of the similar love they held toward their own playthings.
I:8487;1309;Kudos to Pixar for putting together such an important and entertaining film.
I:8487;1310;This is one of my absolute favorite movies!
I:8487;1311;i love Woody and Buzz and now so does my kid
I:8487;1312;Good movie, although after watching it again with our 2 year old, it does seem a little violent at times.
I:8487;1313;this move brings back from great younger memories!If you have never seen Toy Story.
I:8487;1314;What are you waiting for :D
I:8487;1315;I choose politically correct over slyly entertaining, any day!
I:8487;1316;"Those ""modern classics"" are great for adults, what with their modern spin, dialogue, etc. but why give the kids a head."
I:8487;1317;She's so excited that the characters are right in front of her and knows all their names.
I:8487;1318;I bought this as a graduation gift for my child.
I:8487;1319;TOY STORY is one of those classic movies that should be around for generations.
I:8487;1320;Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear and Cowboy Woody are two of the most lovable and fully developed animated characters ever created.
I:8487;1321;"The movie is hilarious throughout though there are also many poignant moments (like Buzz's ""I Will Go Sailing No More"" song)."
I:8487;1322;Many talented actors contributed their voices most notably Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Don Rickles and the movie includes three memorable songs .
I:8487;1323;And like all good stories it has some important themes including the meaning and value of friendship.
I:8487;1324;This is a clever movie with heart that everyone should see.
I:8487;1325;The whole family loves this movie and I am sure it will be a favorite for many years in our household.
I:8487;1326;He waited by the mailbox everyday to see if it had arrived, and when it did we watched it right away.
I:8487;1327;Sort of the 'Snow White' of Pixar, if you like.
I:8487;1328;animated motion picture ever produced.
I:8487;1329;That in and of itself would have been impressive, but it's also a great movie.
I:8487;1330;I should write blurbs like this for a living!)
I:8487;1331;The animation looks a little dated today (compare to the sequel and see how far the technology came in just four years) but the storytelling and performances are still wonderful as are the songs written by music legend Randy Newman.
I:8487;1332;Toy Story 2 is just a fun movie, with action and humour and great graphics, but this is actually pretty angsty.
I:8487;1333;The emotions and characters in the movie are complex and satisfying to watch (although it'd be nice to have a more central female character.)
I:8487;1334;I can see the point of those people who complain about it being too scary for their kids .
I:8487;1335;Toy's Story is a classic.
I:8487;1336;My son loves this movie and is a great way to end the day!
I:8487;1337;have for movie lovers, especially Pixar aficionados.
I:8487;1338;The movie is hilarious but has strong moral underpinnings.
I:8487;1339;I watched this movie dozens of times as my grandchildren grew and still enjoy watching it.
I:8487;1340;Love toy story 1 and 2.
I:8487;1341;This was funny and entertaining and all kids regardless of age will enjoy it.
I:8487;1342;I am happy to at least the movies work.
I:8487;1343;This timeless classic continues to entertain and its popularity has returned with the release of the new movie.
I:8487;1344;old appreciate and enjoy it.
I:8487;1345;He takes his toys, and his sisters, and makes these creatures out of them.
I:8487;1346;Woody tells Buzz thier is no greater honor in being a toy and making a child happy.
I:8487;1347;They escape the house and how they did it is funny.
I:8487;1348;Woody and Buzz then catches up with Andy and is family.
I:8487;1349;This is the best animated movie ever that is great and watchable for the whole family and there are funny momments in this film.
I:8487;1350;this is the first movie to be a CGI type of animated film in 1995(which is the year the film was released)this the best family movie ever and there are great sitcom actors who voice in this film like Tom Hanks(Bosom Buddies)and Tim Allen(Home Improvement which was still airing on television with new episodes).
I:8487;1351;this film is rated G even though there some content like Woody call Buzz Lightyear Mr. lightbear and there is a funny fist fight with Buzz and Woody and some frightening scenes that only occur when Sid is around.
I:8487;1352;i highly recommend this film that has great technology and was made by Pixar(the company that originally worked on short films and they still make them now).
I:8487;1353;this film deserved a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and it is as good as many people say it is.
I:8487;1354;Great price for this classic movie.
I:8487;1355;movie works great as well as the price!
I:8487;1356;This is definitely one of the perks of still owning a VHS player!
I:8487;1357;He was a big fan of Cars so I figured give this a try.
I:8487;1358;Our kids loved it now our 16 month granddaughter is enjoying it!
I:8487;1359;We enjoy Toy Story it is such a funny, exciting, family oriented movie.
I:8487;1360;Fun to watch for the kids and adults together.
I:8487;1361;The movie keeps the kids glued to the TV for hours.
I:8487;1362;Now it has been perfected with DTS sound.
I:8487;1363;The language made us edgy and the mean boy next door was over the top.
I:8487;1364;I gave it two stars instead of one because the story line did keep our attention.
I:8487;1365;The family loves this movie.
I:8487;1366;A very interesting story well presented.
I:8487;1367;My 3 yr old granddaughter especially loves to watch it.
I:8487;1368;one of the new classic animation movies.
I:8487;1369;Although this review is about the first Toy Story movie, I will mention the other two Toy Story movies as well.
I:8487;1370;Viewed this way they make the best trilogy of movies ever made in Hollywood.
I:8487;1371;with the possible exception of The Lord of the Rings set.
I:8487;1372;I rate all three toy story movies as five star, the highest rating possible.
I:8487;1373;which makes it an emotional and delightfultrilogy to watch.
I:8487;1374;I recommend all three of the films for all children and grown.
I:8487;1375;I watched this one a couple of times with my grandson, who loves it, and I really like it too.
I:8487;1376;The characters are a lot of fun.
I:8487;1377;"My grandson says a lot of ""to infinity and beyond"" and I love hearing him say it."
I:8487;1378;There's enough action to keep a soon to be 3 year old involved for the entire movie.
I:8487;1379;Tom Hanks and Tim Allen along with the rest of the cast did an excellent job.
I:8487;1380;The computer animation is so much better than the older animations and I enjoy watching it.
I:8487;1381;This is the classic legendary all.
I:8487;1382;Don't miss this great hit, your kids will love it now and everafter.
I:8487;1383;Woody believes that he has life (as a toy) good.
I:8487;1384;I loved the story and liked the animations a lot.
I:8487;1385;This movie is pretty much perfect.
I:8487;1386;It's adventurous, exciting, entertaining, and good for the whole family.
I:8487;1387;Great gift for my Grandson that I am surprised he hasn't wore it out.
I:8487;1388;He can tell you every toy character and has collected most of them
I:8487;1389;I loved this movie even more re.
I:8487;1390;Loyalty, teamwork, and tolerance are the 'heavy' themes of this light, heart.
I:8487;1391;It was a good choice, holds the attention, and has been enjoyed a lot.
I:8487;1392;Watching it as an adult, the film has stood up well over time.
I:8487;1393;One of the greatest techinological achievements made one of of the greatest animated films in cinema history and one of the greatest films all around,the first ever computer animated film.
I:8487;1394;Disney and Pixar's 1st and best triumph,featuring the voice talents of Don Rickles,John Ratzenberger,Jim Varney,Annie Potts and of course, the film's duo Woody,the vetren and Buzz,the rookie.
I:8487;1395;the imaginative story of a talking Cowboy doll named Woody owned by a boy named Andy and who leads a group of other toys.
I:8487;1396;one of the best films of the 20th century and the best of 1995.
I:8487;1397;brilliant,incredible,wonderous to behold,toys coming alive: an imaginative idea.
I:8487;1398;lovable characters,two super big thumbs up,way up,incredible animation,these are the toys we want to play with at any age.
I:8487;1399;A brilliant film that would make children wonder if their toys are really coming to life.
I:8487;1400;I saw this classic gem twice in November 1995 and it seems only yesterday.
I:8487;1401;If you have never seen this film, then you been missin out on a great film for all ages.
I:8487;1402;If you have seen it and then you should see the other Pixar films and finally bring home Rex,Mr. potato.
I:8487;1403;head,Hamm,Bo Peep,Green Army Man,Slinky and story's leading toys Woody and Buzz in One of the most imaginative and brilliant films of all time.
I:8487;1404;Entertaining for adults as well.
I:8487;1405;Disney brought us some of the greatest classic tales through the wonder of animation.
I:8487;1406;In 1995 a group of young upstarts brought the world a ground breaking phenomenon.
I:8487;1407;Still, there was something else that came with this movie, an incredible original and heartfelt story that touches billions of people.
I:8487;1408;To this day this one simple movie has created a legacy that will live to infinity and beyond.
I:8487;1409;It was a creation that dived deep into our souls and brought out the inner child in all of us.
I:8487;1410;Not only do they come to life but they have one mission and that is to keep whoever plays with them as happy as they possibly can.
I:8487;1411;What happens if one day a new toy comes along that is so much better than you?
I:8487;1412;Well Toy Story shines the light on these tiny little things that you never would even think about when you put your toys away!
I:8487;1413;The voice acting is another thing that makes 'Toy Story' so great.
I:8487;1414;Each actor breathes amazing life into their role.
I:8487;1415;Each character is unique and the humor that is used in this film is so original and so fresh, but the best part is it is toy humor.
I:8487;1416;this movie is probably one of the greatest movies ever, while compared to the Pixar films that followed a great deal has improved in the animation so this one would look just a bit crude.
I:8487;1417;My kids love the movie and.
I:8487;1418;they enjoy watching it on our car trips.
I:8487;1419;not my choice but my grandson chose it, he likes woody and the fact that he is a cowboy and can talk.
I:8487;1420;Brings back memories of my childhood am glad this days technology lets my toddler enjoy what i enjoy great movie indeed!!!
I:8487;1421;I received it very timely and it was in great shape and was a great movie.
I:8487;1422;I love the characters, the story line, the humor.
I:8487;1423;Works well once you get past selecting the language(which you have to do every time you watch it).
I:8487;1424;This is a very funny and great idea.
I:8487;1425;You see a magical world of toys that are alive with a lot of huge stars.
I:8487;1426;The whole family can sit and laugh at this movie many times.
I:8487;1427;Just look at the movie reviews for this one.
I:8487;1428;Toy Story is a timeless and classic franchise which will set the standard for kids movies for many years to come.
I:8487;1429;"Awesome film for the family
I:8487;1430;These are classics that every Disney animated movie lover must have.
I:8487;1431;Toy Story 2 is funnier and much better as a matter of fact, I will stick with that one along with my favorite movie Monsters, Inc.
I:8487;1432;He loves toy story and he loves this product.
I:8487;1433;It was a great deal.
I:8487;1434;ray is pure visual enjoyment.
I:8487;1435;Not only was Toy Story a technical marvel, but it is simply a very sweet movie!The animation was beautiful.
I:8487;1436;Woody and Buzz will always be among my favorite movie characters.
I:8487;1437;loved it with my then five.year.
I:8487;1438;old daughter and still love it today.
I:8487;1439;The movie is great and is funny and cute and the whote famity will like it.
I:8487;1440;My kids love this movie.
I:8487;1441;I do to and i'm not a huge fan of cartoons.
I:8487;1442;Its a really cute and fun movie.
I:8487;1443;All in all an amazing package.
I:8487;1444;By far their best work as far as story and character design goes.
I:8487;1445;"Toy Story and ""Toy Story 2"" belong to that tiny group of perfect movies that includes ""2001"", ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", ""Amadeus"", ""Chinatown"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""L A Confidential"" and a few others."
I:8487;1446;They remain fresh, funny, and engaging even after many viewings.
I:8487;1447;"one of the reasons for ""Toy Story""'s perfection is that it combines technology and subject matter so well."
I:8487;1448;a note to all you fundys complaining about magic and the black arts in Disney films.
I:8487;1449;I ordered these for a boy's home and they were so happy!
I:8487;1450;With Jesus and Disney, we can make a difference!
I:8487;1451;The first time we watched this movie I laughed like a little kid.
I:8487;1452;I love Tom hands and Tim Allen and for the most part the entire cast.
I:8487;1453;I loved watching this film because of that dream as a kid.
I:8487;1454;Ok i must be honest.
I:8487;1455;It is much more than an impressive piece of animation, however.
I:8487;1456;Toy Story is an exquisitely crafted tale that deals simply, yet brilliantly, with deeply human themes.
I:8487;1457;and they do so in a charming way that will warm the hearts of children and grown.
I:8487;1458;There is something authentic about cowboy doll, Woody, whose toy.
I:8487;1459;earth and believable about the vulnerability we see in the characters, and something beautifully real about the way these issues become resolved.
I:8487;1460;It is a tale that will strike a chord with any of us.
I:8487;1461;of course, this is also a very funny and exciting movie that entertains and delights, though what really draws me in is how all this becomes an education for us, as we are brought face.
I:8487;1462;face with what it means to be human.
I:8487;1463;storytelling as it should be, that speaks to us, and resonates with us as human beings.
I:8487;1464;with breathtakingly riotous fun and adventure.
I:8487;1465;i will say no more about the movie as i feel if you haven't seen it then most of this film should be a surprise to you.
I:8487;1466;All i do have to say however is Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz are superb choices as the voices of the main characters.
I:8487;1467;this is an incredibly warm hearted and fun family film that a child of any age would love.
I:8487;1468;Love this Disney Pixar movie!
I:8487;1469;This is one of the best movies ever made.
I:8487;1470;This movie was released when I was in grade school and I remember it fondly.
I:8487;1471;Dear millennials: this movie is still as good now as it was when you were 10.
I:8487;1472;I guess it's just not the movie for me and I love animations.
I:8487;1473;Great movie and the kids love to watch it over and over, it has instantly become a Disney classic for years to come.
I:8487;1474;they liked it so that's all that counts.
I:8487;1475;pixar collaboration that produced this wonderful film, movies were pretty much lopped into two basic categories: child and adult.
I:8487;1476;there are two main areas in which this movie succeeds so brilliantly: First, it is incredible eye.
I:8487;1477;second, it works because you will be watching it over and over with them!
I:8487;1478;As you marvel at the CGI effects, you will also be laughing at the hilarious jokes that, while going right over your kid's head, will make you burst into laughter.
I:8487;1479;"This is mainly accomplished by the cast of ""supporting"" characters such as the wise."
I:8487;1480;"overall, ""Toy Story"" is one of the most influential films ever produced for its ability to blur the lines between children and adult cinema."
