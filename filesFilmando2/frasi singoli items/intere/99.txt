I:10465;1;But, on the other hand, it is based on a true story.
I:10465;2;Casino is, without doubt one of the best films by Scorsese.
I:10465;3;the performances: Robert De Niro is one of the finest actors to come out of Hollywood and that's a universal fact!
I:10465;4;In this movie, he delivers a performance that qualifies as one his best after 'Raging Bull'.
I:10465;5;connected Casino guy, a friend and a loving father all at the same time!
I:10465;6;His powerful performance in this movie has to be seen to be believed.
I:10465;7;Delivering sharp dialogs and firing those F. words with a one.
I:10465;8;a. kind punch is something only he can do!
I:10465;9;He plays a wicked, wicked character who also cares for his boy.
I:10465;10;Another brilliant performance after GoodFellas, he is the finest choice for his role.
I:10465;11;the soundtrack is very much like that in GoodFellas.
I:10465;12;And much in the same manner, there is some playful rock'n'roll music playing in the background during any violent scene of crime!The dialog is brilliant.
I:10465;13;Robert Richardson's cinematography is amazing.
I:10465;14;The wonderful screenplay for the film is co. written by Nicolas Pileggi who is also the author of the book.
I:10465;15;rated classic, this one deserves a rightful place up there along with Scorsese's other acclaimed classics.
I:10465;16;sided medium, so let's use both sides!
I:10465;17;"Reveals so much about Vegas
I:10465;18;I love movies that shine a light on truth.
I:10465;19;Martin Scorcese's harsh and yet delicately balanced masterpiece rises above anything petty meaning that if one wishes and has the ability and means to create a Sicilian mafia movie he should do so with grandeur and put into it as much effort as possible for people remember those who take advantage of their talent and circumstances and are diligent in their undertakings.
I:10465;20;Casino is in my opinion an epic, but it's much more than that.
I:10465;21;This film speaks even to those who dislike the subject of organized crime.
I:10465;22;Casino is one of the best movies of the 90's.
I:10465;23;In fact, in my opinion, it's one of the best organized crime movies of all time.
I:10465;24;Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone were excellent!
I:10465;25;Casino is an exciting movie.
I:10465;26;If you like and fear the work of Martin Scorcese, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci and if you love the juice of Sharon Stone, you'll enjoy Casino.
I:10465;27;movie I've seen is Suicide Kings], but I know that this is one of the best films, regardless of genre, that I've ever seen!
I:10465;28;DeNiro's performance is next to the best, and Pesci just can't be stopped!
I:10465;29;Also, it's an interesting approach having Ace and Nikki both tell the story in their own view.
I:10465;30;people: This movie's a classic.
I:10465;31;Probably one of DeNiro's greatest films ever.
I:10465;32;The fact that it's based on a true story is probably what makes the plot so interesting.
I:10465;33;The movie also gives you a sort of behind the scenes look at how Vegas works: the flow of money to the count room, the surveillance security, etc.
I:10465;34;To top it all off, the cast in this movie is rock solid.
I:10465;35;Sharon Stone does an absolutely amazing job playing the greedy junky.
I:10465;36;And Joe Pesci does an excellent job playing the violent out.
I:10465;37;This film is a wonderful story of life on the top in the city of Las Vegas.
I:10465;38;Having been to Vegas numerous times I find the story fascinating.
I:10465;39;Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci team up again in this great drama.
I:10465;40;It is interesting to see Pesci and De Niro interact in this movie.
I:10465;41;Sharon Stone gives a wonderful performance too.
I:10465;42;casino and mob lovers will enjoy this movie so much.
I:10465;43;I find this movie interesting also because it shows the difference between Vegas of the 1970s and Vegas of today.
I:10465;44;I highly recommend this film.
I:10465;45;Donnie my boy puts on a great show.
I:10465;46;anything with Don Rickles in it is a award winner!
I:10465;47;Coming only five years after Scorsese's mob masterpiece, this cinematic tour de force was treated as a mere retelling of the same story, but for my money it is far more enjoyable.
I:10465;48;The rich Japanese man that comes into their casino walks away with a fortune in winnings.
I:10465;49;But they bring him back and he bets small and still wins.
I:10465;50;"if you've ever read ""The Great Gatspy"" you'll see a lot of similar themes in this movie."
I:10465;51;She shows off the jewlery to her daughter as testimony to how much he must love her.
I:10465;52;Ace then stands up, revealing that he is fully dressed in a suit and shoes and everything but pants.
I:10465;53;He then walks to his closet and puts pants on.
I:10465;54;What was this all about?The story builds up and gradually unravels.
I:10465;55;He basically talks her into it with the promise of money.
I:10465;56;boyfriend will contribute to the decline of the story.
I:10465;57;The FBI strikes the coup de grace as they finally come in and shut down the casino.
I:10465;58;He's great at what he does and he's so committed to doing his job right.
I:10465;59;He even loved his wife and put up with her longer than you would think he'd be able to.
I:10465;60;But still, Ace Rothstein stands as the greatest character in the movie.
I:10465;61;if you love Sorcese, you love Casino.
I:10465;62;Damn fine film and while not as groundbreaking as Goodfellas, every bit as entertaining, as it were.
I:10465;63;de Niro and Pesci are both very good here.
I:10465;64;Like I said, Pesci suffers from having done this before, and so recognizably (he did win the Oscar for giving this very same performance in Goodfellas), but it is a necessary performance that had to be given by someone, and he fits the bill really well.
I:10465;65;She stomps all over everyone.
I:10465;66;I was at one time one of those people and I honestly think that being instantly linked to both Goodfellas and Casino (arguably his two most well.
I:10465;67;If you like Mafia movies, you'll love Casino.
I:10465;68;If you don't like Mafia movies, this is still worth seeing just for the stellar acting job of the entire cast.
I:10465;69;The movie had an excellent idea for a plot.
I:10465;70;As soon as the main menu appeared, I instantly realized it was going to be an excellent viewing experience.
I:10465;71;"I am not quite sure how they ""restored"" it, but they did an absolutely spectacular job."
I:10465;72;All of the colors were alive and vibrant and made it hard to believe this film was made in 1995.
I:10465;73;"Casino With Nicholas Pileggi"", which was interesting due to hearing true facts as well as seeing photos and live archived footage about the people the film was based upon."
I:10465;74;Add it to your collection today!
I:10465;75;I absolutly love this movie always have always will.
I:10465;76;The cast is amazing and the story unfolds in such an amazing manner that I feel involved.
I:10465;77;And especially this duo, I really enjoyed this film.
I:10465;78;it is a must for movie buffs and collectors of movies.
I:10465;79;This is one of the best movies ever.
I:10465;80;Robert Dinaro is the best in it as usual.
I:10465;81;Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors of our time, only comparable with Francis Copola.
I:10465;82;Director Martin Scorsese's CASINO is a superb crime drama that concerns successful football handicapper Ace Rothstein (DeNiro).
I:10465;83;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
I:10465;84;For those of you who enjoy mobster movies, this has to be in your collection.
I:10465;85;I lived in Las Vegas during this time, and it was like I knew these guys.
I:10465;86;"No director has ever done a better job than Maretin Scorsese at taking moveigoers into the life of the mafia headfirst, and his 1995 movie ""Casino""."
I:10465;87;"Though not as purely enjoyable or fast paced as ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"" is most certainly a brilliant piece of cinema, a masterpiece that only Scorsese can provide."
I:10465;88;"like ""Goodfellas"", ""Casino"" is based on a true story (and also on a book based on a book by Nicholas Pileggi)."
I:10465;89;He's rich, successful and married to the beautiful Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone).
I:10465;90;Him and Nicky are on top of the world.
I:10465;91;Casino is undoubtedly one of the best movies Scorsese ever did.
I:10465;92;this special edition is a must for all fans of the movie.
I:10465;93;Casino is a stylish and entertaining story of a casino boss with mafia connections.
I:10465;94;Perhaps most impressive is the cinematography, particularly the opening sequence which backgrounds the Vegas atmosphere and mob involvement in operating the casino.
I:10465;95;DeNiro is perfect as the casino boss, and Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone and James Woods are also well cast in their respective roles.
I:10465;96;The narrative is entertaining but has no particularly clever twists, although this is largely determined by the fact that it is based on a true story.
I:10465;97;i personally liked Casino more than Goodfellas, mostly for the visual elements and intrigue of the Las Vegas environment.
I:10465;98;While a good film in its own right, it would be difficult to argue that it is much more than another Goodfellas filmed in Las Vegas.
I:10465;99;this product works great, and was sold as new.
I:10465;100;i calcelled it immeadiatly, but I'm sure I was charged for it.
I:10465;101;Viewed: 6/04, 3/09Rate: 63/09: Casino is the third film with the collaboration of Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Frank Vincent, and others.
I:10465;102;Helping Ace keep the casino's employees and customers honest is his best friend Nicky.
I:10465;103;This is a must for all Scorsese fans!
I:10465;104;compelling and tragic story with brilliant script and sharp visuals.
I:10465;105;was great on blu ray.
I:10465;106;great acting from Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesch.
I:10465;107;De Niro stone had fantastic portrails of there roles as the a casino manager and a hustler.
I:10465;108;I love this movie and the entire cast!
I:10465;109;The fact that this is based off of actual events makes it even more enjoyable.
I:10465;110;I love stories of Vegas in its hayday.
I:10465;111;from the fantastic sets, rich dialogue, and unapologetic violence to the well.
I:10465;112;portrayed characters and themes of loyalty and betrayal .
I:10465;113;Casino is pure Quintessential Scorsese.
I:10465;114;in this compelling film Scorsese never pulled any punches in breathing life into his ideas.
I:10465;115;Back home years ago, they were friends and co. workers.
I:10465;116;Although she agrees to marry Ace, she continues a liaison with her former pimp (James Woods) while encouraging Nicky's affections.
I:10465;117;as usual, Scorsese obtains excellent performances from his leads.
I:10465;118;There is a History Channel show on these events and the movie is very accurate.
I:10465;119;Love, love, love this movie.
I:10465;120;I can watch this movie over and over again.
I:10465;121;The plot is suberb and De Niro and Pesci are as perfect in this film as in any other.
I:10465;122;The cast is superb and this is one of Martin Scorsese's finest productions.
I:10465;123;I was incredibly impressed and remain that way today.
I:10465;124;"The film itself is great
I:10465;125;pack it to the gills with .
I:10465;126;what follows is a series of wild and unpredictable events and some great characters.
I:10465;127;Now, this is just a plain great movie, and it hits on a lot of angles while being completely interesting all the time and gripping part of the time.
I:10465;128;REASON 1: Deniro is on top of his game.
I:10465;129;His performance is much more wide ranging and even sympathetic, and during the last third he REALLY gets into his role.
I:10465;130;It is absolutely great to watch.
I:10465;131;REASON 2: unique setting and premise.
I:10465;132;REASON 3: great female lead performance.
I:10465;133;say what you want about lorraine braco, but sharon stone is so good at getting you to want to just through her down a flight of stairs(that may sound violent but wait to you see the .
I:10465;134;she pulls) that her performance is wholey memorable.
I:10465;135;It is so interesting and informative, while also managing to be entertaining, that you've got to be impressed(just look at the creative film work that scrocese pulls off while taking us through the casino).
I:10465;136;a lot of that happens in casino as well, BUT.
I:10465;137;there's a difference, and that difference is the tone .
I:10465;138;CASINO is more lighthearted and takes joy in the filmaking and storytelling.
I:10465;139;CASINO is really a great movie, and one that can be appreciated on many levels.
I:10465;140;So when this comes out I'm going to sell the heat transfer and get this one.
I:10465;141;But this time, De Niro is the most sympathetic character which is a change of pace.
I:10465;142;But she does it to perfection and recieved a well deserved Academy Award nomination.
I:10465;143;There are a few memorable scenes.
I:10465;144;The movie was alittle long, but the performances were good enough to keep it from dragging to much.
I:10465;145;If you like the mob, then you will like this film!
I:10465;146;The man is Robby Deniro and he's well connected as always in these films and THE MAN gives him the chance to run a casino.
I:10465;147;artist genre then this is one movie you should pick up!
I:10465;148;It's a well written story about an actual casino operator in Vegas that DeNiro and Sharon Stone are really good actors in.
I:10465;149;I really liked the movie.
I:10465;150;"The color from the opening scene was brilliant
I:10465;151;This movie is a classic, Robert Deniro holds it down in any role he takes.
I:10465;152;What I expected from Joe P. and Robert D. I thought Sharon did a good performance.
I:10465;153;I would recommend to any adult audience, the reality of adults in a certain environment and the acting was very good you can believe this really happened
I:10465;154;The thing that is so fantastic about this movie is that it is absolutely true!
I:10465;155;The dialogue is crisp and real, and the acting is great.
I:10465;156;Most movies are fiction, so when you think that these characters and events are real it brings an added dimension.
I:10465;157;The cinematography and music will move you, and the sets and costumes are suberb.
I:10465;158;I love this movie, saw it years ago and I just bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas.
I:10465;159;I found nothing visually stunning in the Universal Logo, as tastefully done and family oriented as it was.
I:10465;160;This is my favorite Scorsese movie ever.
I:10465;161;Did Sharon Stone at her most luminous, in the best performance she has ever given, have something to with this assessment?
I:10465;162;Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci play two very well acted characters, based on two real.
I:10465;163;This film takes on the two very appealing subjects in our culture today.
I:10465;164;cASINO is compared to GOODFELLAS and pardodied as a part two movie.
I:10465;165;the book catches the mechanics of the deal of putting together a casino, which would have been a great facet for the film, but which is swept away in a few shots.
I:10465;166;nonetheless, the mechanics of the shots infused with the music are mesmerizing.
I:10465;167;pesci is the perfect epitomy of evil.
I:10465;168;DeNiro is the perfect idiot savant, being brilliant in business but a fool at heart.
I:10465;169;Sharon Stone is great as a Junkie, hustler, femme fatale.
I:10465;170;This is the best acting Sharon Stone has ever done.
I:10465;171;This is my favorite movie of all time.
I:10465;172;I love mob movies such as Casino, Good Fellas, all of the God Father movies and Scarface.
I:10465;173;Because this will be the only way they will listen.
I:10465;174;BTW, the movie itself is 5 stars.
I:10465;175;awaited sequel to Goodfellas, CASINO rolls in as perhaps his greatest achievement.
I:10465;176;A story of love, lust, jealousy, luck, power and control.
I:10465;177;"Robert De Niro gives his ultimance performance as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a high."
I:10465;178;He is about to achieve his life.
I:10465;179;talking Joe Pesci) and beloved wife Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) create havoc and begin making headlines.
I:10465;180;Colors are vivid and rich, and detail is very fine.
I:10465;181;First, in my humble opinion, this is Martin Scorcese at his finest.
I:10465;182;All of the regulars give awesome performances in this (even Sharon Stone, who I can't stand!)
I:10465;183;The picture is astonishingly vivid and clear and the lights of Las Vegas really jump out of the television.
I:10465;184;It's all whipped cream and a cherry on top of an excellent sundae !
I:10465;185;star cast, it will keep you entertained from beginning to end.
I:10465;186;A finely crafted cinematic experience.
I:10465;187;Scorcese's cinematic vision is once again masterfully framed by two powerful and memorable performances by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.
I:10465;188;De Niro and Stone are better than ever.
I:10465;189;This is the case I understand this movie is good, but I dislike it.
I:10465;190;I find the narration a little annoying, kind of like a book on tape, but it's a good story.
I:10465;191;"If anyone is interested in a ""Gangster Flick"", this is the one to get!"
I:10465;192;I love this genre of films and this has to be my favorite behindThe Godfather Trilogy: The Coppola Restoration [Blu.
I:10465;193;"It's the most detailed ""Gangster Flick"" I've seen from Martin Scorsese!"
I:10465;194;Furthermore you have to turn it to see the special features!The Mastering is fine as is the movie,in fact great.
I:10465;195;I'm not a fan of her by any stretch of the imagination, but she was great in this movie!
I:10465;196;when reviewing this movie, people tend to compare it to GoodFellas, and I can see why.
I:10465;197;i myself like the similar casting (also the irony of Frank Vincent in this movie), but the contrast between this movie and GoodFellas is pretty high.
I:10465;198;I must say that it is very good.
I:10465;199;He is very good at what he does and makes an unbelievable amount of money.
I:10465;200;personally, I like the flow of the story.
I:10465;201;oh well, the rest of the movie was still good.
I:10465;202;I assured any potential new viewers here that the movie is quite good.
I:10465;203;It's a classic Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci performance.
I:10465;204;These two work SO well together it's crazy!!
I:10465;205;Loved it the first time, loved it the 100th time, and loved it this time!
I:10465;206;The Blu Ray itself is great, never seen this movie look or sound so good.
I:10465;207;I will always be able to watch Casino on any CPU connected to the internets .
I:10465;208;the video was very good, but not excellent compared to new movies on Blu.
I:10465;209;The movie is about 3 hours long, and is pretty good.
I:10465;210;After scoring classics with Raging Bull and Goodfellas, a lot of people still wouldn't give him recognition like an Oscar and while the basic opinion now is that he's bound to get at least one for his recent film the Departed, the essential feeling is that they should've given him one earlier.
I:10465;211;"Maybe it was the hype from everyone but watching Taxi Driver, Goodfellas or Raging Bull I thought ""yeah I thought they were good movies but where's this 'masterpiece' everyone keeps saying?"""
I:10465;212;to guy and he's of course great in the film.
I:10465;213;While he did show a more restrained menace in Heat, here he's practically vicious in certain scenes and likable.
I:10465;214;Sharon Stone actually did receive a nomination for her work here and it was a welcome one too.
I:10465;215;is it a Scorsese classic?
I:10465;216;time favorite film of his, Casino is at least worth a look but there's enough to like here, it's just not quite enough.
I:10465;217;Casino also has a supporting cast of many other fine notables.
I:10465;218;casino gives the audience a realistic view into the operations of a prestigious Vegas casino, as well as, a glimpse into the seedy side and underbelly of Las Vegas, played to perfection by the film's stars and supporting cast!
I:10465;219;Casino provides drama and action along the way, and it also graphically depicts in realistic, true.
I:10465;220;"life form the consequences when someone breaks the rules or gets out of hand!If you enjoy films which have a mob/maffia type of flavor to them, coupled with the glitter and excitement of Las Vegas as viewed from ""behind."
I:10465;221;"the scenes"", then you will undoubtedly enjoy Casino!"
I:10465;222;The film runs nearly 3 hours long, but every dramatic, exciting, and interesting minute is enjoyable.
I:10465;223;No matter whenever or how many times I see the movie (which has been at least 10 times already), it has never become a bore or tiring, and I always enjoy watching it!De Niro and Stone are superb .
I:10465;224;and of course Pesci is always an absolute treat!
I:10465;225;Excellent film transfer really shows off increased resolution.
I:10465;226;It has it all, plot, murder, cover up, keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:10465;227;The movie, CASINO, is a cinematic.
I:10465;228;through the eyes of the hardened gangsters and shady wise guys who were there and who rode an incredible multimillion dollar empire right down into the dry and light tan Nevada ground.
I:10465;229;Joe Pesci's persona just kidnaps the screen and holds your movie.
I:10465;230;going heart captive every time the camera's on him and Robert Deniro just gives another absolutely brilliant performance once again.
I:10465;231;cASINO, as a whole though, pulls no punches.
I:10465;232;cASINO entraps you, teases you, educates you, exhilarates you, seduces you, excites you, shocks you, and eventually drains you just like the exotic and never.
I:10465;233;this is truly an epic tale that is absolutely worth your time to see.
I:10465;234;Without a doubt the best mob movie ever made.
I:10465;235;The layout and features are extremely vanilla.
I:10465;236;This is an amazing movie.
I:10465;237;Whatever it is, its a classic.
I:10465;238;Batter UP!The special features are numerous and are all good for multiple viewings, especially the aforementioned documentaries.
I:10465;239;He would take the style and structure of GoodFellas and expand it on a much more ambitious level.
I:10465;240;As they did on the GoodFellas commentary, Pileggi and Scorsese dominate and talk about the film's themes in a very eloquent and engaging way.
I:10465;241;There is quite a bit of overlap from the commentary track on this and the other featurettes.
I:10465;242;Casino: The Cast and Characters is a substantial look at the actors and the characters they played.
I:10465;243;While De Niro and Pesci appear in interviews done during the film's release, Stone contributes a brand new one and speaks candidly about how hard she campaigned for the role of Ginger.
I:10465;244;As she recounts her experiences of working on the movie, she is actually moved to tears in a very revealing moment.
I:10465;245;Casino: After the Filming takes a look at the editing process.
I:10465;246;There is a funny take with Scorsese's mom and Pesci goofing around on the set.
I:10465;247;Vegas and the Mob takes a look at the real life gangsters that the film is based on.
I:10465;248;"one of the most substantial extras is a History Channel documentary about Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal."
I:10465;249;This is an informative, fact.
I:10465;250;based contrast to the stylish, fictionalized version in Casino.
I:10465;251;it's a huge bummer, because this is actually one of my absolute favorite movies.
I:10465;252;Scorcese's vibrant color palette and voyeuristic camera work relish the ultra.
I:10465;253;clarity of the Blu ray format.
I:10465;254;A true joy to watch again on Blu Ray.
I:10465;255;First off, major props go to Scorsese for his brilliant direction.
I:10465;256;Anyways, the film also sports brilliant acting on the parts of De Niro, Pesci and Stone, Stone standing out and nabbing the Oscar nom (and should have been win!)
I:10465;257;Sam, kind hearted as he is, actually trusts her, and this proves to be his end in many ways.
I:10465;258;hour epic you watch as not only Sam's marriage and status but also the mafia's control of the gambling scene is jeopardized by events involving Sam, Nicky and Ginger.
I:10465;259;This is a brilliant film that to me rises above 'Goodfellas' for it's as serious as it is intriguing and it never once begins to bore.
I:10465;260;This movie was very good.
I:10465;261;Very entertaining and a great cast.
I:10465;262;This movie is very disturbing and quite funny.
I:10465;263;The only movie I still have on VHS and don't care b/c its a favorite and will always be in my top 5
I:10465;264;In this film he stabs a man with a pen, shoots a woman in her own kitchen and puts a guy's head in a vice grip.
I:10465;265;The glitz, glamour, and great cast which also includes James Woods, Frank Vincent, Alan King,and more add up to one thing.
I:10465;266;Considered one of the classic Martin Scorsese/Joe Pesci gangster films.
I:10465;267;if you enjoy this flick watch Goodfellas.
I:10465;268;"CASINO is not (and let me emphasize ""not"") Scorsese's masterpiece."
I:10465;269;cASINO provides an interesting (and long, coming it at three hours) history of Las Vegas in the 1970s.
I:10465;270;As in GOODFELLAS, it provides us with a window to the underworld of the Mafia and allows us all to satisfy our desires to explore that world and view it from the comfortable distance of our own homes.
I:10465;271;all of this being said, I did enjoy watching CASINO.
I:10465;272;The performances by Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro (in that order) are definitely worth witnessing.
I:10465;273;Each of them brings this story alive, despite its slow pacing.
I:10465;274;Moreover, the story is a fascinating one, particularly if you enjoy movies about the Mafia.
I:10465;275;"Every great director has their failures
I:10465;276;The main example is the style presented.
I:10465;277;"Marty used to move the camera around with poetic grace
I:10465;278;"Another thing is Joe Pesci
I:10465;279;Stone is okay, not great.
I:10465;280;Not Oscar nomination great, anyway.
I:10465;281;Casino is a brilliantly acted crime drama that chronicles the rise and fall of the fictional Tangier hotel and casino in Las Vegas, and is a classic Scorsese film.
I:10465;282;narrated, it boasts some strong visuals and performances that rank it as one of the director's best.
I:10465;283;Once again, Martin Scorsese pairs up with the dynamic duo of mob movies: Deniro and Pesci, and once again they've create an amazing, epic movie.
I:10465;284;It has superb directing, great cast(who beats Deniro and Pesci?)
I:10465;285;, and a wonderful story about the rise and fall of a mafia owned casino.
I:10465;286;as great as this movie is, i must say something about the violence.
I:10465;287;com) Casino is the tale of Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro), the best of the old bookmakers, who is hand.
I:10465;288;(End quote from Filmcritic)Casino is another amazing Scorsese flick.
I:10465;289;His narrative's are great, and watch for his unique technique of freezframing scenes with a voiceover.
I:10465;290;Goodfellas is an even better example of this.
I:10465;291;the audio track is perfect.
I:10465;292;Scorsese uses a lot of music to enhance the film, so the Dolby Digital really does kick but.
I:10465;293;the feature has a widescreen track, and is clear and crisp.
I:10465;294;Scorsese uses brighter colors than he did in Goodfellas, and I rate the video an A .
I:10465;295;The movie keeps you interested the entire time.
I:10465;296;The films do share a director, Martin Scorsese, a source writer, Nicholas Pileggi, and two stars, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.
I:10465;297;Both films tackle stories in the criminal milieu and succeed in gripping the audience.
I:10465;298;Scorsese manages to make this film a fast.
I:10465;299;He's ably abetted by some snappy editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, gorgeous cinematography by Robert Richardson, and good sense of the era(love the cars and clothes).
I:10465;300;The film is fascinating in how it portrays Las Vegas as a shimmering city which under it's surface is motivated by greed and avarice, which in turn breeds paranoia.
I:10465;301;DeNiro is superb as the oddsmaker who goes on to manage a casino only to be brought down by his own vanity.
I:10465;302;Pesci is equally fine as the thug who wants to make Vegas his personal playground.
I:10465;303;Probably the best performance in the film belongs to Sharon Stone as DeNiro's wife who is at heart a hustler.
I:10465;304;im a fan of Hk cinema.
I:10465;305;mostly but i respect films that are good and Casino is one of them.
I:10465;306;robert DeNiro is truly one of the best actor ( along wit Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, and Chow Yun Fat) Joe Pesci is very talented too.
I:10465;307;The bosses are real happy because Ace is making them tons of money.
I:10465;308;very good movie, i have not seen goodfellas yet but hear its also a classic
I:10465;309;If you are a fan of this genre then Casino is a must own.
I:10465;310;I honestly believe this one of Scorsese best works and De Niro and Pesci really shine in this film.
I:10465;311;I have honestly never been a huge fan of Sharon Stone but she really creates a believable character.
I:10465;312;So again I would I highly recommend this film if you are in to this genre.
I:10465;313;He along with Sharon Stone/Joe Peschi and others just made this picture a royal gem.
I:10465;314;Having worked in a major casino, this movie is entertaining and educational.
I:10465;315;This a great movie and was worth every penny.
I:10465;316;I am very pleased with the speed of delivery and condition of the product.
I:10465;317;"The point of both movies was to explore the organized crime world, but ""Good Fellas"" was an introduction to to the professional lives and ""Casino"" continued in the same tradition, but by delving deeper into the personal lives."
I:10465;318;In the end, I suppose that it is a companion piece, but not in a bad way.
I:10465;319;"putting aside the comparisons to other movies, ""Casino"" is really an excellent film in and of itself."
I:10465;320;In the process, the film reveals the inner workings of a corrupt, mafia run, Las Vegas casino, and shows just what it takes to actually run one.
I:10465;321;This movie gives a more technical look at the industry than other movies do, and it's definitly not the kind of info you get every day.
I:10465;322;the performances here are all top notch.
I:10465;323;De Niro is superb as Ace Rothstein (based on actual gambling expert Lefty Rosenthal) and Pesci is stellar as Nick Santoro.
I:10465;324;Sharon Stone got an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Ginger, which was well deserved.
I:10465;325;I thought that she did a pretty good job, all though she seemed a little over the top at some times throughout the movie.
I:10465;326;Despite this minor flaw, this is easily her best work.
I:10465;327;Kevin Pollack is also great in the small role of official Casino boss, Phillip Green.
I:10465;328;the set and costume designs are all great.
I:10465;329;The glamorous Las Vegas scenery is spectacular and looks absolutely incredible.
I:10465;330;The clothing is great too.
I:10465;331;thousand dollar suits look fantastic and Sharon Stone's gowns and fur coats all look excellent as well, as does the clothing of all the minor characters, right down to the cowboy outfit that the Nevada State Gambling Comission guy wears.
I:10465;332;Even more proof that Scorsese is one of, if not the, best director ever.
I:10465;333;I can't understand how such an incredible talent has been robbed of the Best Director Oscar so many times.
I:10465;334;But anyway, pay no attention to what the fools who run Academy say, the direction here is absolutely incredible.
I:10465;335;The cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen.
I:10465;336;This movie is absolutely stunning visually.
I:10465;337;Even though it may be often misunderstood in many ways, it's still a great movie.
I:10465;338;It shows the great skill of all involved from the cast and the crew.
I:10465;339;It's tremendously entertaining and is definitly worth seeing.
I:10465;340;Her Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning performance is worth the price of the movie alone!!
I:10465;341;A previous reviewer downgraded her performance but I believe this is a personal bias rather an objective one!!
I:10465;342;"Next to her ""Basic Instinct"" breakthrough, ""Casino"" shows that with a great director, Sharon can deliver the goods as well as any of the great femme actors out there like Charlize and Hillary who I also like."
I:10465;343;Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsese directed in the nineties.
I:10465;344;The acting by the leads is good and the script is excellent.
I:10465;345;Robert Deniro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joe Pesci is chilling yet funny again.
I:10465;346;Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliant film.
I:10465;347;Still good and in some ways better than 'Goodfellas'.
I:10465;348;Old Vegas glamour at it's finest.
I:10465;349;Great movie at a great price.
I:10465;350;Casino is one of the top bench mark films in the mob genre films.
I:10465;351;It has an excellent ensemble cast that includes: Robert Deniro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone and James Woods.
I:10465;352;Deniro and Pesci nail their performances in this film.
I:10465;353;What was surprising was that Sharon Stone did an excellent job of holding her own acting opposite Deniro which is no small accomplishment.
I:10465;354;casino is extremely well done and will be amongst the list of the best American films.
I:10465;355;"Robert DeNiro takes on the role of ""Ace Rothstein"" and truly when you see his potrayal you cannot think of anyone else playing this character."
I:10465;356;strong about what he wants and how he views Las Vegas.
I:10465;357;This movie gives you such an interesting story and such a powerful dynamic between it's cast of actors.
I:10465;358;Sharon Stone makes you sympathize with what she deals with being Ace's woman.
I:10465;359;A good film that I recommend highly.
I:10465;360;one of my dads friends told us that we had to see this movie.
I:10465;361;got it from you for much cheaper than amazon.
I:10465;362;One of the best movies ever made.
I:10465;363;It's definitely a treat for the eyes and ears.
I:10465;364;This is a must for anyones collection.
I:10465;365;Sharon Stone made her splash in the early 90's with Basic Instinct.
I:10465;366;She shined in her roll as Ginger, a call girl whose character would eventually marry Robert Deniro's character.
I:10465;367;The movie itself is rather long but it's a wonderful movie and I love it.
I:10465;368;The writing is great, the scenery is great, it's a good movie.
I:10465;369;overtime it has not been as revered as Goodfellas, but it is still a well loved movie.
I:10465;370;okay, on to the review of this new release.
I:10465;371;This movie really is based on a true story and has some of the greatest actors in it.
I:10465;372;the portrayal of all these underworld types and the lives they try to lead is compelling.
I:10465;373;the shots of Las Vegas are worth the price of admission.
I:10465;374;this is probably the best movie that Sharon Stone ever did!De Niro and Pesci are their usual greatness!
I:10465;375;It's one of the best mob movies of all time.
I:10465;376;DeNiro is classic at playing the brains of the operation, and Pesci plays the psychotic braun perfectly, maybe a little too perfectly.
I:10465;377;The minor players in the film put on great perfomances as well.
I:10465;378;casino is entertaining AND educational at the same time.
I:10465;379;For people who want to see how Las Vegas was ran in the 70's, or fans of those involved, this is a must.
I:10465;380;This is a very good movie.
I:10465;381;very well plot and amazing performance by the actors.
I:10465;382;will recommend it to friends.
I:10465;383;This is basically Goodfellas rehashed but feels a lot longer, and has some Shakespearean ambitions.
I:10465;384;scorsese being Scorsese, there aren't many dull moments (except for some of the more melodramatic dialogue between Sharon Stone and Robert DeNiro as their marriage disintegrates) and the film is always visually absorbing.
I:10465;385;This showed the tough style and grit that once made the mob strong,powerful&feared.
I:10465;386;A great movie, Robert DeNiro does it again, this time as the person in charge of a large mafia owned casino in Las Vegas.
I:10465;387;This is a great movie.
I:10465;388;I love the detail to fashion for the time period in the movie, which is late sixties to early seventies.
I:10465;389;"Since GOODFELLAS, Scorsese's gone beyond Great Director status
I:10465;390;It's the kind of jaw.
I:10465;391;"dropping stunner that has become a Scorsese trademark
I:10465;392;The gangster/buddy angle is nil, as we see from frame one that De Niro and Pesci's 'friendship' is mutually suspicious and parasitic.
I:10465;393;The Vegas 'backstory' angle, which dominates the first hour, is visually riveting as you'd expect .
I:10465;394;Scorsese employs every type of shot in the lexicon of moviemaking here, taking the viewer on the ultimate insider's tour of how a casino operates .
I:10465;395;He's one more fly whose time has come to have his wings pulled off.
I:10465;396;commerce like so much sentimental ballast.
I:10465;397;This was another awesome performance by these 3 great actors/actress pesci, deniro, stone.
I:10465;398;another great mob move this is as almost as good as goodfellas.
I:10465;399;great mob movie to own.
I:10465;400;Casino is one of my favorite mob.
I:10465;401;"related films, right up there with ""Goodfellas"" and the first two ""Godfather"" movies."
I:10465;402;I am also a fan of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.
I:10465;403;"The dynamic chemistry between both actors really translated well from ""Goodfellas"" to ""Casino""."
I:10465;404;Martin Scorcese is one of the best film directors in the past couple of decades.
I:10465;405;Casino may not have not been a box office smash for Martin but artistically I thought it was right up his alley.
I:10465;406;Granted that the film is well over two hours, time flies by whenever I watch the movie.
I:10465;407;I am not a Don Rickles fan only because I find him to be an obnoxious, loudmouth, unfunny comedian but he was actually pretty good in the movie and that is because he wasn't trying to be funny.
I:10465;408;Ginger was more in love with his money and power than Al himself.
I:10465;409;"Had he waited a few more years and in between films, ""Casino"" might have been a box office hit but compared to ""Godfather 3"", ""Casino"" is a hit."
I:10465;410;Casino, while being eerily similar to Goodfellas, is a great mob movie.
I:10465;411;Deniro, once again, is such an amzing actor and presence that you can't help but be in awe of him.
I:10465;412;rated as this film is under.
I:10465;413;This is far and away the better of the two.
I:10465;414;It also includes WBs bookmarking so you can create custom bookmarks and favorite scenes!
I:10465;415;My favorite films range from gangster flicks (The Godfather 1 and 2), comic book adaptations (Batman '89), Sci.
I:10465;416;fi spectacles (2001: A Space Odyssey, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, The Thing), realistic thrillers (Collateral, No Country for Old Men), and animated classics (Fantasia, The Lion King).
I:10465;417;This is a fantastic 178.
I:10465;418;But anyways, I seem to prefer this to Goodfellas, which is also a great movie.
I:10465;419;and not only that, we get to see some of the finest performances by De Niro, Stone, and Pesci.
I:10465;420;De Niro plays Sam Rothstein, one of the top handicappers in Las Vegas.
I:10465;421;On the soft side, though, he is a caring family man who would do anything to protect his wife and child.
I:10465;422;De Niro should have at least been nominated for an oscar: here he is at the top of his game.
I:10465;423;He uses his explosively violent attitude to solve many of his problems, with disturbing and darkly hilarious results.
I:10465;424;Pesci sure steals the show with his cursing and his aggressive personality, and he's clearly one of the reasons why I like Casino.
I:10465;425;i was never a fan of Sharon Stone, but she shines in this movie.
I:10465;426;She is a woman that people love to hate, and she would care less what we all think of her.
I:10465;427;to be honest, what I like more than the performances is the overall flow of the film.
I:10465;428;Kudos to Scorsese, De Niro, Stone, Pesci, Rickles, Woods, and Vincent for making such a spectacular film.
I:10465;429;"original it's almost stunning
I:10465;430;(sarcastically:) It's such a great contrast!
I:10465;431;Really gets on my nerves.
I:10465;432;"as for the ""gritty, realistic"" violence."
I:10465;433;GoodFellas, but it is actually a fantastic follow.
I:10465;434;There are two levels on which to watch a film like this.
I:10465;435;This is particularly fascinating with Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci doing just that.
I:10465;436;The other level of enjoying this film is jumping on the fluid film ride Scorcese takes you on.
I:10465;437;constant graceful, majestic camera work that picks the viewer up in its hand and zooms you along.
I:10465;438;and moving a few clicks faster at least, accompanied by rock and classic jazz standards.
I:10465;439;If you like Scorcese, you must watch this film.
I:10465;440;"If you like Vegas, this film offers a fascinating ""possible"" history of how your favourite casino came to be."
I:10465;441;This is a roller coaster ride with slow spots, but overall a great film ride for those who like a healthy quotient of violence and pathos.
I:10465;442;It was a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, it's one of his favorite movies.
I:10465;443;I see a lot of parallels between that film and Casino.
I:10465;444;Scorsese is one of our great living artists.
I:10465;445;"such a piece of art
I:10465;446;Martin Scorsese's fascination with America's crime scene examines low.
I:10465;447;robert DiNiro, Sharon Stone, and Joe Pesci all put in admirable performances.
I:10465;448;the picture is pretty .
I:10465;449;And, as always, Scorsese's use of contenmporary music creates a soundtrack that tells a part of the story by itself.
I:10465;450;this gem has been polished up in this presentation to the point that it shines like it was meant to.
I:10465;451;The seventies never looked so good.
I:10465;452;Goodfellas worked fine on my Samsung player, and Casino couldn't get past the 'Play movie'!
I:10465;453;the customer service at Amazon is Superior!
I:10465;454;so I figured it might be my Samsung player.
I:10465;455;But Stone, De Niro and Pesci are great.
I:10465;456;If you're a mob movie fan, here's another great one based on a real story, with great extras not found on the tape.
I:10465;457;This movie is a must see for anyone who considers themselves a movie junkie.
I:10465;458;Lets face it, most movies that are released today come from the same monotonous formula that consists of little substance for an ever less attentive society, so if one wants to see a good film, one must dig from the past.
I:10465;459;This movie has De Niro and Pesci at one of their best performances.
I:10465;460;Casino is such a great movie, with a terrific cast, that it's over before you know it.
I:10465;461;Watching the film makes you realize how great De Niro, Pesci and Stone are as actors.
I:10465;462;There are just many great scenes where I sat there and thought how brilliant they were.
I:10465;463;The best scenes are with the dialogue between De and Stone.
I:10465;464;the movie also does a great job making itself modern even though it takes place during the 70s and 80s.
I:10465;465;If you are into great films, this one of the best.
I:10465;466;I worked for a Mississippi casino at the time this film hit the big screen.
I:10465;467;De Niro and Pesci offer memorable performances, as does a superior supporting cast that includes James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, and Melissa Prophet, to name but a few.
I:10465;468;but the real laurels go to Sharon Stone, who plays out the rise and fall of the glamorous Ginger with surprising skill.
I:10465;469;for all its flaws, CASINO is an extremely watchable, very memorable movie that stands up very well on its own in spite of inevitable comparisons to GOODFELLAS.
I:10465;470;This movie makes you want to work in a Casino.
I:10465;471;Wonderful movie and very interesting.
I:10465;472;I would recommend this movie.
I:10465;473;success(Taxi Driver) after success(Raging Bull) after success(Goodfellas).
I:10465;474;In my opinion Scorsese is one of the top three movie directors of all time at showing us, what it's like to be a gangster.
I:10465;475;Now I just see him as one of the best actors of his generation.
I:10465;476;From award wins to being flat out hilarious, I envy the talent he has.
I:10465;477;Contributing everything to the supporting cast.
I:10465;478;"Although, one thing I do think of whenever I do watch this movie
I:10465;479;"imagine watching the Scorsese film ""Goodfellas"", excluding and including a couple of faces, with new characters and new settings."
I:10465;480;"It's pretty much of what would've happened if ""Goodfellas"" had a happy ending."
I:10465;481;It's a classic for all of these reasons.
I:10465;482;But it's nice to encourage to have fun.
I:10465;483;disc Special Edition)My other two most favorite Scorsese films today.
I:10465;484;'Casino' is a dominant film which is based on the true story of how Las Vegas was transformed from a simple gambling mecca into a place that has as much personality and colour as Disney World.
I:10465;485;Once again Martin Scorsese has created a film that is so multi.
I:10465;486;layered and smart that the viewer is completely engrossed for the entire 182 minutes.
I:10465;487;Scorsese accomplishes what he did with 'Raging Bull' and 'GoodFellas'.
I:10465;488;Once again De Niro and Pesci shine with his direction and the unrelenting screenplay.
I:10465;489;Sharon Stone does the best work of her career.
I:10465;490;Another great thing about 'Casino' is the supporting cast: Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, James Woods, and Joe Bob Briggs all add great elements of both comedy and drama to this outstanding winner which has been overlooked on Scorsese's list of credits.
I:10465;491;Amazon was nice enough to replace this movie after it wouldn't budge at the 96 minute mark.
I:10465;492;As usual, De Niro turns in an outstanding performance.
I:10465;493;The colorful and flashy period wardrobes worn by the characters add to the visual appeal of this film.
I:10465;494;law does and she told me about Amazon and together we created an account and now she can order movies for me whenever I want.
I:10465;495;I love this movie, but sometimes I still have to cover my eyes in the bloody parts.
I:10465;496;It is definitely the best mob movie ever made.
I:10465;497;Let me tell you that it's the third part of the trilogy about mob that Scorsese and De Niro had made.
I:10465;498;The first one is Mean Streets, which is the fist movie made by these great people.
I:10465;499;Then it's the amazing Goodfellas.
I:10465;500;So Casino closes this trilogy , and it is the best of all three.
I:10465;501;both, De Niro and Pesci, talk throughout the movie of what is all about in mob.
I:10465;502;the acting of De Niro is great, as usual, and also Pesci is wonderful as Ace's maniac friend.
I:10465;503;i especially loved the ending where the big hotels rise up.
I:10465;504;Also the beginning is great, when Ace is blown up in his car and begins to fly in the screen while the credits are beingshowed.
I:10465;505;james Woods is great as Ginger's lover.
I:10465;506;i loved the outfit of De Niro, it's all shiny silk, and colorful suits.
I:10465;507;scorsese once again shows us why he is the best director.
I:10465;508;in this new edition, there's a lot of footage, which is wonderful.
I:10465;509;i highly recommend you this excellent movie.
I:10465;510;This is where it all happen for the great Martin Scorsese.
I:10465;511;"If you have ""Goodfellas"", you MUST get this as well."
I:10465;512;"Casino is just as good as ""Goodfellas"", Scorsese's other wiseguy film that often overshadows Casino."
I:10465;513;By just as good, I mean brilliant, perfect, and mesmerizing.
I:10465;514;paced, has a great soundtrack, with music pulsing throughout the film, has the best voice.
I:10465;515;over I've heard (it's integral to the story), the acting is perfect, and well, it's just one of those movies that does exactly what it tried to do.
I:10465;516;highly recommended as well is listening to commentary by Scorsese and some of the actors.
I:10465;517;Scorsese's thoughts on the film are wonderfully enriching to the film viewing experience itself.
I:10465;518;"Also, Scorsese says that he wanted the film to explore ""the spiritual growth"" of the gangsters who are ""living in a sinner's paradise""."
I:10465;519;Not many directors can give you that in a film.
I:10465;520;Was a good movie: action packed.
I:10465;521;Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci were great actors.
I:10465;522;For those who enjoy action films, I recommend.
I:10465;523;"Although the ending of ""Casino"" is not as satisfying as those earlier Scorcese films, the entire film is a wonderful exercise in film editing and directing."
I:10465;524;of course, great attention has been paid to the soundtrack, which is occasionally jarring, but mostly fits in well with the action/dialogue.
I:10465;525;"teaming of De Niro and Pesci is less effective than ""Goodfellas"", but that stems in part because we've already been there before, and that ride was a lot more fun."
I:10465;526;much had been made of Sharon Stone's performance, which is the most effective of the three leads, but this is due in part to it being the most unpredictable.
I:10465;527;Casino runs a bit longer than it should, but it still rewards through repeat viewings.
I:10465;528;James Woods in particular steals the movie every time he appears on screen.
I:10465;529;one that I understood a lot better.
I:10465;530;Seeing it for the second time also helped.
I:10465;531;Second time I got it .
I:10465;532;i liked it the first time I saw it though not understanding why DeNiro's character let Pesci's run the show had bothered me.
I:10465;533;paced (or gripping) as Casino and while Good Fellas is considered Scorceses mob masterpiece I'd venture to say Casino is roughly in the same ballpark in terms of greatness (and certainly fast.
I:10465;534;"a look at the real people behind the characters and how the filmmakers cast them,*""Moments with Scorsese, Stone, Pileggi and more!"""
I:10465;535;Casino is an interesting film in many respects but it has several weaknesses.
I:10465;536;Let's start with the good: the portrait of 1970's Las Vegas is fascinating and Director Martin Scorsese has the details perfected .
I:10465;537;right down to the clothes, home decor, and music.
I:10465;538;Stone gives the best performance of the film .
I:10465;539;This, and some interesting details, make this a good but not great film.
I:10465;540;Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci star in Martin Scorsese's1995 crime drama based on the book.
I:10465;541;A man reflects his life in the mobwith his wife and friend while managing a casino.
I:10465;542;This is a great filmand I like it just as much as Goodfellas.
I:10465;543;ray has nice pictureand sound plus some neat extras.
I:10465;544;I recommend this good blu.
I:10465;545;CASINO is what's expected of Scorsese, DeNiro and Pesci: riveting story telling, hypnotic visuals and their trademrak retelling of history that can make you disregard the real truth (although here their version is precise).
I:10465;546;The unexpected standout performance of Sharon Stone (Best Actress nominee.
I:10465;547;The soundtrack featuring the Scorsese standards (Jerry Vale, The Rolling Stones, Don Cornell) is perfectly meshed into the storyline blending the two as one.
I:10465;548;Along with HEAT, CASINO marked the best of American film in 1995.
I:10465;549;"I once heard Quentin Tarantino say: ""Robert de Niro has done an amazing job both in 'Casino' and 'Heat'."
I:10465;550;He always makin' great gangsters movies and this is one is not the exeption.
I:10465;551;When De Niro and Pesci get together with Scorsese they always score big.
I:10465;552;Casino is one of the best gangster movie i've ever seen and i recomended to everyone who enjoys ganster movies.
I:10465;553;ray really makes this movie look good, especially since there are so many bright and colorful scenes.
I:10465;554;Audio is good and Scorcese's soundtrack delivers plenty of funk and glamour.
I:10465;555;yeah so this movie is balls.
I:10465;556;joe pesci takes the acting cake and deniro takes the pie or something.
I:10465;557;i will watch this movie over and over again.
I:10465;558;This movie will take your breath away.
I:10465;559;The acting, cinematography and the editing is superb.
I:10465;560;Both pesci and De niro really steal the show.
I:10465;561;the sound was good, and the image was almost perfect.]
I:10465;562;i never liked Sharon Stone since this movie.
I:10465;563;She really tried to act nice according the her charactor.
I:10465;564;This is one great movie as long as you can take the language and violence.
I:10465;565;Watching it I wonder how accurate some of these events might be.
I:10465;566;Anyway, some great preformances from the stars.
I:10465;567;Robert De Nero, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone are really great.
I:10465;568;Casino is a great movie.
I:10465;569;Robert DiNero is perfect in his role as Nick Weinstein .
I:10465;570;he is tough and sometimes also tender.
I:10465;571;Sharon Stone plays the perfect slut.
I:10465;572;all among the greatest gangster movies ever made.
I:10465;573;I really enjoyed this movie.
I:10465;574;Yes, it is graphic and vulgar, but the acting is great .
I:10465;575;"Although not quite as thrilling as his previous pieces, Martin Scorsese still scores with a ""Goodfellas"" goes to Vegas film."
I:10465;576;"i put it this way simply because, part of the appeal is visiting with so much of the same cast as 1990's ""Goodfellas""."
I:10465;577;"other fun ""mobster"" character actors like Frank Vincent are on tap too."
I:10465;578;I personally think Frank is terrific, and has a wonderful presence and look with all that thick silver hair.
I:10465;579;He reminds me a bit of Dennis Farina, another great actor who is far more famous.
I:10465;580;"Frank was classic as ""Billy Batts"" in ""Goodfellas"" and I enjoyed him here as well."
I:10465;581;the true original, James Woods, effectively plays the smarmy ex.
I:10465;582;Stone is believable, albeit melodramatic to the max, as she entertainingly deteriorates in her marriage to DeNiro.
I:10465;583;She deserved her award for this performance.
I:10465;584;"That's why a ""Casino"", great as it is, is so similarly done and themed, it seems to pale in comparison."
I:10465;585;"You kind of feel like Scorsese said, well, it worked once, so let's change a few elements, give the movie a new name, and have ""Goodfellas Revisited."
I:10465;586;Therefore, once an extraordinary film is made, it seems silly to attempt to recapture THAT magic, NEW magic is always preferable.
I:10465;587;despite all that, this film is highly entertaining and definitely worth makng a place for in your movie library.
I:10465;588;This was a movie I really enjoyed.
I:10465;589;Sharon Stone was excellent in her role because she really played her character well.
I:10465;590;I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
I:10465;591;both worlds are simply divergent: De Niro falls in love with an ideal, (Pygmalion effect) and overlooks the real woman and her personal convictions, aspirations and horizon of life.
I:10465;592;"casino is, in last instance, a modern fable
I:10465;593;"Once more, the arresting narrative style is another of the golden guests of this movie
I:10465;594;Martin Scorsese paints a colorful portrait of Las Vegas in the early 1970s as the oasis of glamor and corruption that it was.
I:10465;595;This Movie is one of the best of all time.
I:10465;596;Gives you a glimpse of how the Vegas life was and how the industry has changed from it.
I:10465;597;A compelling tale of power, money and depravity which sets the dark mood for the earthy tone in this truly riveting action.
I:10465;598;casino has often been compared to Goodfellas and indeed one of the few variations is that the film is set in the heart of swinging Las Vegas in the 1970's.
I:10465;599;Casino certainly holds enough merits of its own and certainly being a unique and highly origanal film within itself, deserves to be judged on such merits.
I:10465;600;winning actor, Robert De Niro, one of Americas finest actors, heads the superb cast list.
I:10465;601;hooker, Ginger Mckenzie, which is played masterfully by the sultry Sharon Stone who displays a beleavably raw edge to her characterisation and plays out her scenes with conviction and gritty realism.
I:10465;602;casino was shrewdly written by Nicholas Pileggis (who had enjoyed previous success with the cult classic, Goodfellas) and cunningly goes in for absorbing realism, expertly drawn characters that are played with instinctive conviction by the highly acclaimed array of stars and a whole host of intriguing subplots that leads to the dramatic, violent climax.
I:10465;603;Uncomfortable viewing on those particular scenes.
I:10465;604;on the whole though, Casinos well thought out and carefully prepared structure is accompanied by an enthralling and sizzling soundtrack that helps capture the mood and ambience of its era, effectivly.
I:10465;605;an intriguing and undeniably excellent and beleavable observation of a city built on greed and power.
I:10465;606;a compelling and often shocking movie with excellent performances all round, complemented by the fast, razor sharp scripts that capture the mood and spirit perfectly.
I:10465;607;Top performances from its four leading stars .
I:10465;608;Many probably don't agree, but I do place this one, 1 notch above Goodfellas.
I:10465;609;Don't get me wrong, Goodfellas is a great film in it's own right, but for me Casino takes the cake.
I:10465;610;For a 3 hour film it passes quickly and is wholly entertaining.
I:10465;611;One of my favorite aspects is the performances.
I:10465;612;I am not a huge Sharon Stone fan, but Martin manages to get a full out dramatic performance out of her, definitely her best role in her entire film career to date.
I:10465;613;But thankfully, the great story sucks you in, and you get used to the narrating.
I:10465;614;the acting here is brilliant.
I:10465;615;You have the awesome combination of De Niro and Pesci, and Stone in her best performance yet.
I:10465;616;James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollack, and Frank Vincent round out a fantastic cast.
I:10465;617;casino tells the perfect story of a powerful organization f*cking up, and how fast you can lose everything.
I:10465;618;But then I watched it again, and loved it.
I:10465;619;One of 1995's best films.
I:10465;620;I just find Casino so amusing and funny that I hardly even notice the grim violence and harrowing drama.
I:10465;621;Casino is just so colorful, multi.
I:10465;622;plots, tangent stories and brilliant side.
I:10465;623;James Woods is especially funny as a lowlife con.
I:10465;624;But it's Sharon Stone who walks away with the movie.
I:10465;625;established male lead actors she owns Casino.
I:10465;626;Stone delivered a performance so authentic that it's truly unfair the amount of criticism she gets for her other, less.
I:10465;627;Better lighting, far more impressive cinematography and more entertaining characters.
I:10465;628;mA sound is also amazing and there are plenty of extras.
I:10465;629;This has to be one of the best gangster/mob movie of all time, talk about epic!
I:10465;630;Casino is one of the most unforgettable films that I have ever seen.
I:10465;631;He was incredible in this film.
I:10465;632;He should have definitely at least earned himself a nomination for this one.
I:10465;633;Its R rating is extremely well.
I:10465;634;If you don't mind the sinful lifestyles of each character (involving extreme greediness, substance abuse, violence and profanity), you are in for a genuine motion.
I:10465;635;I recommend Casino to the strong.
I:10465;636;Martin Scorsese teams up with his partner from Goodfellas, Pillie, and the two put together a fantastic, well performed, movie.
I:10465;637;The story is absolutly amazing.
I:10465;638;It teaches you so much, in an entertaining view.
I:10465;639;Every single movie Robert De Niro has been in, he awlays gives the fans an excellent performance.
I:10465;640;Sharon Stone, was great, although a little to great in a couple of scenes.
I:10465;641;She should of got an oscar.
I:10465;642;Martin Scorsese gives us his good old wholesome directing, something that you'd suspect from anyone of his movies.
I:10465;643;A great long three hour epic.
I:10465;644;It's a movie that you know Scorsese made.
I:10465;645;If you take Scorcese, DeNiro, Pesci, and give them 3 hours to work with, it's a given they'll deliver a film that's both riveting and memorable.
I:10465;646;Casino is such a film.
I:10465;647;In a way, it was a compliment to the mob.
I:10465;648;at best, like kings and queens .
I:10465;649;And in some cases, employee rudeness was elevated to an art form.
I:10465;650;"odds have always favored ""the house."""
I:10465;651;This is just an awesome movie I can watch over and over.
I:10465;652;A little bit long, but definitely a great show.
I:10465;653;Although rarely considered as good a movie, Casino is a brilliant piece of filmaking that is as good in many ways as Scorsese's earlier Mafia film Goodfellas.
I:10465;654;"starring Robert DeNiro as a career gambler who is very good at what he does, Joe Pesci as a his volatile ""muscle"" friend, and Sharon Stone as a high priced call girl and DeNiro's eventual wife, Casino is a whirlwind of stories and situations, sometimes gruesome and sometimes hilarious."
I:10465;655;The colors are deep and vibrant, the sound on AC3 or DTS 5.1 providing very good channel separation and clarity.
I:10465;656;Casino is nothing less than a Scorcese masterpiece, based primarily on the true story of the violent life and death of Tony The Ant Spilotro, who was the mob's chief enforcer during the early 70's, while protecting the mob's gambling interests run by Frank Lefty Rosenthal.
I:10465;657;As someone interested in the development of the American mafia, Casino is a brilliant translation of the building of Bugsy Siegel's vision in the desert up to the gaudy haven for high rollers that it was during the 70s.
I:10465;658;This is perhaps Scorsese's most underrated film, Casino contains one of De Niro's finest performances.
I:10465;659;De Niro plays all these sentiments at once, and he ultimately creates a character that may not be Scorsese's most likable but is certainly his most mesmerizingly believable.
I:10465;660;The film's rare dual voiceover is so well executed, as Pesci and De Niro's characters fight for control over the storytelling just as they battle for power over Vegas.
I:10465;661;This film is flamboyantly stylized.
I:10465;662;in many ways it is about style.
I:10465;663;There are as many flashy whip.
I:10465;664;If you want a film that is at once great entertainment and moving art, watch Casino, and let Scorsese transport you back to a rare moment in American history: The last time tough guys like us we're ever given anything that 'effing' valuable.
I:10465;665;Great job product came on time and as expected watched it right away and it was perfect I would do business again for sure
I:10465;666;Nothing complicated about it .
I:10465;667;Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, and Joe Pesci gave outstanding mob performance.
I:10465;668;Worth the extra money for the Blu.
I:10465;669;A great addition to any collection.
I:10465;670;This is one of the greatest movies ever made.
I:10465;671;CASINO is without a doubt the greatest mob film yet!
I:10465;672;It has a great cast Robert DeNiro, Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, James Woods, Don Rickles.
I:10465;673;ect. it also has a great story line.
I:10465;674;This is Las Vegas mobster film is one of Scorcese's best!!!
I:10465;675;A three hours, its little on the long side but thats fine, it's such a great film, the three hours are worth it!!!
I:10465;676;Great performances from Sharon Stone,Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci!!!
I:10465;677;The huge supporting cast is also incredible!!!
I:10465;678;And whats really cool is the entire movie is on one dual.
I:10465;679;I think Casino is one of the best movies out there.
I:10465;680;This is a movie that tells it all.
I:10465;681;Also Joe Pesci showed his true acting talent in this one.
I:10465;682;"up job as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein, a professional gambler who is hand."
I:10465;683;As usual the performances are stunning, De Niro and Pesci work together as well as any screen tandem I've ever seen.
I:10465;684;Sharon Stone does a great job as Ace's two.
I:10465;685;I've always despised her as a person but I have to give credit where credit is due.
I:10465;686;Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again.
I:10465;687;This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in.
I:10465;688;Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.
I:10465;689;Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.
I:10465;690;Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.
I:10465;691;This film is truly a gem!!
I:10465;692;Colorful scenes with the old cars and early signage on the strip.
I:10465;693;Pacino and DeNiro make a great team.
I:10465;694;Love everything about this movie.
I:10465;695;A must see for movie lovers!
I:10465;696;The abbreviated review is here: This movie is about gangsters, is directed by Scorsese and stars DeNiro and Pesci.
I:10465;697;A great story told only the way Scorsese can tell it is entertainment at its best whether it's tightly based on a true story, loosely based on a true story, or is an original fictional screenplay.
I:10465;698;it has to have Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in it.
I:10465;699;he keeps on going on the one topic that once gained him much success.
I:10465;700;The acting is flawless, story flows at a great pace from the hours it generates on the screen.
I:10465;701;The leading actors mention above, are all at their usual greatness, but the pleasant surprise from this movie is the electrifying performance by Sharon Stone, (who won a Golden Globe award and got an Oscar nomination for her role) as the con.
I:10465;702;"She was truly memorable in this film because she effortlessly convinces us that she was one crazy ""individual"" that you love to hate."
I:10465;703;Robert De Niro again does a great performance, as Sam, who is at odds between being loyal to his bosses and retaining some kind of intregity.
I:10465;704;pesci, as Joe, is one remarkable actor.
I:10465;705;The whole production of the film held up really well.
I:10465;706;and, of course, heavy violence, other then that `Casino' is another great and wild piece of cinema.
I:10465;707;iz really like this movie.
I:10465;708;and think itz one of the all time best.
I:10465;709;evetyhting about this movie wworks evrey well.
I:10465;710;i though it waz a bit long but the story is so exciting that you really doesn't mind.
I:10465;711;the directing is really good.
I:10465;712;This movie is the best of the best discribing the true story of Las Vegas.
I:10465;713;This may well be the last film with these two great actors in a mob story film.
I:10465;714;This film is pure mob.
I:10465;715;NOT casino tales and rich people.
I:10465;716;It is the story of a jewish man (DeNiro) That is loved by the mob for his gift of picking winners of sports games.
I:10465;717;He takes his ownership of the casino very seriously, and wants everything to be on the level.
I:10465;718;I just hope DeNiro and Pesci team up with Scorsese one more time in the future.
I:10465;719;But if this is the last one it is a great film to go out on.
I:10465;720;One of the best gangster movies ever made.
I:10465;721;Although I'm not a huge fan of Stone's, she did a remarkable job.
I:10465;722;beautiful picture and great sound.
I:10465;723;The best part of this is seeing the maybe.
I:10465;724;Casino is, without a doubt, one of the best films ever made in the mob genre.
I:10465;725;I actually found myself wishing well for a man who had screwed another guy's head in a vise until his eye popped out.
I:10465;726;"Expertly written, directed and acted, this movie is a must have if you like things like ""The Sopranos: The Complete Series"", ""Wiseguy: The Collector's Edition (Seasons 1."
I:10465;727;Martin Scorsese once again proves that true stories make the best movies.
I:10465;728;barred truth and brutality, Casino is incredibly acted and directed by De Niro, Pesci, and Stone.
I:10465;729;Excellent supporting roles are also delivered by James Woods, Frank Vincent, and Don Rickles.
I:10465;730;DeNiro is excellent and the movie is very watchable.
I:10465;731;He is a real out of control gangster.
I:10465;732;this is an excellent movie with an all.
I:10465;733;star cast and it is directed by Martin Scorsese who is simply one the best directors of Hollywood history.
I:10465;734;The story line is very good and with such a great cast of actors the movie just seems realistic.
I:10465;735;There is a lot of violence and language, it is the mob after all, but it is still a very good movie.
I:10465;736;i enjoyed it a lot and I recommend it to you.
I:10465;737;All movies and e. commerce transactions should be this good.
I:10465;738;should have won an oscar, in my opinion.
I:10465;739;The latter is the best for viewing.
I:10465;740;But all the others still work well too!
I:10465;741;But if you want to see it the best way possible, get a PS3.
I:10465;742;They are by far the best player on the market!
I:10465;743;This is definately one of the best movies I have ever scene.
I:10465;744;It's an epic tale both about the rise and fall of mob control in Las Vegas and also a fascinating tale of some very interesting characters.
I:10465;745;Strong acting led by Sharon Stone's Oscar winning performance.
I:10465;746;Visually compelling with excellent use of music.
I:10465;747;Action, Drama, surprises, and fast moving blood and gore.
I:10465;748;"do of ""GoodFellas,"" at least we've got new special features, new artwork and some documentaries."
I:10465;749;headed criminal who brings heat into the land of slot machines and dice.
I:10465;750;Scorsese once again does the job with great directing.
I:10465;751;Although the film is very good and Sharon Stone has fine moments with her character,it is nowhere near as excellent as GOODFELLAS (My favorite mobmovie ever) and GOODFELLAS is and always will be the superior film.
I:10465;752;Despite all the problems, this is still a film worth watching andthe fully detailed screenplay provides good stuff of the story.
I:10465;753;I was there a few times in the mid to late '70s and I remember it very well.
I:10465;754;Even though I was a little kid the first time I visited Las Vegas, I remember these things very well.
I:10465;755;But I remember being fascinated with the city.
I:10465;756;The new giant hotels dwarfed the older ones.
I:10465;757;One year I got into a conversation with a limo driver and he told me that entertainers who performed in Vegas back in the '60s and '70s took a lot of pride in their performances.
I:10465;758;He said that B. b. King would practice for hours before the show because he wanted to give a great performance and stay sharp.
I:10465;759;I was hooked on this three.
I:10465;760;this movie stars Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone.
I:10465;761;the acting in this movie is superb.
I:10465;762;I thought Joe Pesci's acting was especially good.
I:10465;763;Sharon Stone and Robert De Niro were excellent in their roles.
I:10465;764;This really adds a sense of realism.
I:10465;765;I wish it was still the size it was in the '70s, but generally speaking, it's still one of the best vacation destinations in the world, and one of my favorite places.
I:10465;766;Though it's violent and somewhat disturbing, this movie will provide a nostalgic look back to the smaller, adult.
I:10465;767;I highly recommend this movie.
I:10465;768;Casino is a magnificent gangster/crime film.
I:10465;769;, it generally relies on its authentic dialogue.
I:10465;770;The ending of the film is also great.
I:10465;771;"The acting in this film is superb
I:10465;772;The music in this film is also fitted perfectly, as with most of Scorsese films.
I:10465;773;It comes with one Blu.
I:10465;774;ray disc, with the full length film and special features (including deleted scenes and special reports) packed in.
I:10465;775;Regardless, fans of the film should own the Blu.
I:10465;776;ray version of this classic.
I:10465;777;overall, Casino is a brilliant crime drama with excellent performances.
I:10465;778;fan of the genre or not.
I:10465;779;this is the movie martin scorsese SHOULDA won his oscar for.
I:10465;780;"de niro (more a glorified supporting character in ""goodfellas"") offers an insightful reading of an ordinary man with one phenomenal talent (the ability to set the correct odds) who parlays it into a position of power for which he knows he is unqualified, yet enjoys the ride."
I:10465;781;excellent supporting work also from james woods, don rickles, and a host of unknowns cast as aged mob bosses, &c. not to mention a great job of art and costume direction, brilliant soundtrack, the amazing opening titles sequence, and so on.
I:10465;782;Although i considered Casino a very good movie, it had its flaws and definately is one of Martin Scorcese's lesser films from that which he has produced in the past.
I:10465;783;This coming from a big Scorcese fan mind you :D.
I:10465;784;performance wise the film is flawless Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci deliver the goods as always and drive the film into depth so much more than if someone else were to play the parts.
I:10465;785;Also Sharron Stone delivers a rare great performance through the directing of Martin scorcese.
I:10465;786;based upon The crumbling of the mobs casino organisation, this movie dwelves into the day by day events that occur within the casino.
I:10465;787;the film has a great story and great visuals, the only problem i found within the film was i was a little thrown off by the constant voice over dialogue.
I:10465;788;I would like to recommend it to others if they like to collect good movies.
I:10465;789;A must gangster seqeul (of sorts) to Good Fellas that will keep you on the edge of your seat!
I:10465;790;I like happier endings and something a little more uplifting.
I:10465;791;can anyone shed some light on this?
I:10465;792;It's fascinating from the beginning to the end.
I:10465;793;One of the best movies of the '90.
I:10465;794;Great perfomances from the entire cast, very good editing, brilliant camerawork and a rocking soundtrack makes this just one fantastic movie!
I:10465;795;Thought it was very good.
I:10465;796;De Niro is a superb actor, Pesci is a crazy mob, who you love to hate and Sharon Stone rocked as Ginger.
I:10465;797;I always felt this movie did not get the true attention it deserved.
I:10465;798;One of my favorite movies.
I:10465;799;It's a classic gangster movie and of the gangster movies, Goodfellas, The Goddather , Scarface, Donnie Brasco, The Untouchables, The Departed .
I:10465;800;Casino is my favorite because it has an element of glamour to it.
I:10465;801;The perfect mob movie and it's all about the girl.
I:10465;802;This movie is absolutely fantastic.
I:10465;803;It plays two roles, a gritty organized crime bit, and a up.
I:10465;804;It's beautiful to see crime boss's meet in the back of a supermarket in the mid.
I:10465;805;west, while trench men like DeNiro and Pesci are on the front lines making them rich.
I:10465;806;First it brings all aspects into play: there is a hint of media/cop present, there is the inner.
I:10465;807;And it is exciting to see how it all fits together like a puzzle.
I:10465;808;Next I like the casting.
I:10465;809;I think it is important to have some sort of intimidation and style that is believable.
I:10465;810;Lastly, the musical score was great.
I:10465;811;all for the true buff of this genre, you owe it to yourself to view this pleasure.
I:10465;812;dont let your children watch it.
I:10465;813;raY copy is very good.
I:10465;814;Great cast, great storyline, great soundtrack, great everything!
I:10465;815;scenes look at life in the casino, to the end when everyone starts to tumble, it is one great scene after another.
I:10465;816;I myself am not really big on gangster type movies, but this one really won me over.
I:10465;817;Overall, I enjoyed the movie very much.
I:10465;818;The picture was good and it is one of my favourite mafia movies.
I:10465;819;Joe Pesci did a great job playing part of the mafia.
I:10465;820;But it still manages to remain a very entertaining and insightful look into the behind.
I:10465;821;The reason, for the most part, is to a dynamite cast who do some fantastic work.
I:10465;822;"He ends up running the Tangiers Casino, and brings along his longtime friend and fellow hoodlum Nicholas ""Nicky"" Santoro."
I:10465;823;He starts to bring a lot of heat onto Ace since Ace is associates with him, and a huge rift begins to occur between the two.
I:10465;824;the first half of the movie is a fascinating and insightful view of the inner workings of a casino in that era and what truly went on behind the scenes.
I:10465;825;of all the things that the movie does right, the best is the cast.
I:10465;826;Robert De Niro might not seem to a likely actor to play play a Jewish mobster (since De Niro's Italian), but he pulls it off convincingly and turns in one of his better performances.
I:10465;827;James Woods is also his typically great self in a smaller role as Ginger's pimp.
I:10465;828;the movie, though, belongs to a surprising and brilliant performance by Sharon Stone.
I:10465;829;hit wonder from her Basic Instinct heyday were floored by her tremendous dramatic turn in this movie.
I:10465;830;Also, to all of her critics she also keeps her clothes on in this film.
I:10465;831;I know a lot of people thought that her Oscar nominated performance was overrated, but I strongly disagree.
I:10465;832;Her turn in this movie is the definite highlight and strong point of the film.
I:10465;833;casino as a whole is an underrated film that is worth checking out.
I:10465;834;While it has problems, the movie has quite a bit that's really good and features some stunning performances and a great soundtrack.
I:10465;835;I couldn't get the whole Goodfellas 2 feeling out of my head at first, but eventually I just forgot about it and accepted the movie on its own terms.
I:10465;836;I just received this movie yesterday and watched it today.
I:10465;837;I found out that I kinda hit the jackpot!
I:10465;838;They give you a code on to activate this movie and then you can stream it anywhere on your computer, tablet or even phone!
I:10465;839;If you like gangster/soprano type movies, this one is great.
I:10465;840;Considering this is also a true account makes it even more interesting.
I:10465;841;Plus, I love vintage/70s setting movies because it is very nostalgic for me.
I:10465;842;One of the greatest movies of all times period!
I:10465;843;The bonus materials are also a nice addition!
I:10465;844;This was a pleasant experience.
I:10465;845;It had a nice plot, it somewhat like Scarface.
I:10465;846;Overall, I enjoyed this film, and its definitely worth the money with the rewatch value.
I:10465;847;Joe pesci gives a great performance as the gun toting little gangster man Nikki.
I:10465;848;The first half of the movie was great as the story and characters develop.
I:10465;849;scorsese brilliantly reunites most of the GOODFELLAS crew for this three hour epic.
I:10465;850;Sharon Stone garnered an Oscar nomination for her role as Ginger, a former showgirl/call girl turned Rothstein's wife, who basically makes his life miserable, abuses their daughter, and runs back to her scrawny no.
I:10465;851;deNiro is the handsome face of Vegas, addicted to crazily color.
I:10465;852;coordinated suits, charming the high rollers, torturing the scam artists, and trying to run a good operation while earning for the boys back home.
I:10465;853;top characterizations, all the more true to life in Vegas.
I:10465;854;hours of this film with amazing, engaging performances.
I:10465;855;running a far distant second to GOODFELLAS in Scorsese's canon, CASINO is still a fine film, and is a fascinating glimpse into that real world where all of life spins black and red.
I:10465;856;I have seen this movie multiple times, and it is a brilliant movie.
I:10465;857;The elements that make this movie so good is the acting, music, and perspective the viewer is given as the story is being told.
I:10465;858;The music blends into the story in such a way that it sets the tone of each scene.
I:10465;859;Pesci is the true genius of this movie, his character is ultimate vilan.
I:10465;860;I highly recommend this movie.
I:10465;861;4.6 starsOne of Scorsese's best, Casino is a classic due not only to his tight direction and a great script from Pileggi (based on his book), but DeNiro and Pesci at their best, and the only really good performance I've ever seen from Stone.
I:10465;862;DeNiro is pretty much perfect and Pesci likewise, though I'm guessing from the books I've read on Tony the Ant that he was not quite as pleasant as he's depicted here.
I:10465;863;Sharon Stone is the big surprise, though, as she's as good at being Ginger as she could possibly be.
I:10465;864;"Perhaps the role is just typecasting
I:10465;865;I don't know about that, but he certainly defines this character with much precision, and makes him rather likeable, no mean feat.
I:10465;866;While not quite up to the level of Travis Bickle or Jake LaMotta or the early Vito Corleone, this is easily one of DeNiro's best roles and Casino is worth watching just for him.
I:10465;867;on sleazeball, Frank Vincent plays to a T the exact same role he has in almost everything he's ever done (the strong, silent wiseguy always walking a few steps behind the Boss), and it's funny to see Oscar Goodman doing in a movie what he did for decades the in real life: defending mobsters in Vegas court.
I:10465;868;I wonder how he got that job.
I:10465;869;add in a funny, sharp script, superb camerawork with all the garish oranges and other hues that were Vegas in the 70s/80s, and good turns by almost every actor in the film, and you've got a near.
I:10465;870;It's a truly fine film.
I:10465;871;All the lead characters are excellent in their respective roles: Robert DeNiro as smooth operator Ace Rothstein, Joe Pesci as a maniacally brutal mob enforcer Nicky Santoro, and Sharon Stone as the beautiful yet conniving and drug.
I:10465;872;there is a note on.
I:10465;873;the film itself deserves five stars, I have yet to watch the extras.
I:10465;874;But once you get past the ads, you are in for a long treat.
I:10465;875;Although the film is not quite as fast paced as Goodfellas or some of Scorsese's other works, it is definitely a very worthwhile endeavor to watch this movie.
I:10465;876;the star of this film is of course, Robert DeNiro in the lead role of Ace Rosenthal and his performance is as spectacular as usual, lending heavily to his mob persona.
I:10465;877;Joe Pesci does another outstanding job in the role of Nicky Santoro.
I:10465;878;The truly outstanding performance of this movie and probably her best performance ever came from Sharon Stone in the role of Ginger Mckenna/Rosenthal.
I:10465;879;I find it truly surprising that she didn't win an Oscar for this performance.
I:10465;880;the score for the film fit perfectly with every scene, adding beautifully to every moment of the film.
I:10465;881;"The family is quite pleased due to the amount of money they start bringing in and in an effort to continue making that kind of money
I:10465;882;taking these pressures and the continued pressure from the bosses for their skim, the movie culminates into a classic and memorable mob movie ending.
I:10465;883;although I wouldn't rate Casino as highly as Goodfellas, I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of the genre.
I:10465;884;but no way this was more epic,entertaining,raw,brutal,and foul so naturally I liked it a little bit more.
I:10465;885;ididn't like the charactor that much but it fit the story perfect.
I:10465;886;Another great movie for Deniro and Pesci fans.
I:10465;887;Good soundtrack and good directing.
I:10465;888;We love this combination of Robert Deniro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone.
I:10465;889;They take a real life story and make it come alive.
I:10465;890;This is one of my favorite movies of all time!
I:10465;891;A great pickup and a great find!
I:10465;892;I was also surprised to see Joe Pesci included, since it didn't seem like he'd be around for the sequel, if you know what I mean.
I:10465;893;Robert DeNiro plays an intelligent casino owner in Las Vegas.
I:10465;894;His leadership style and high standards leads to a very successful operation.
I:10465;895;their lives, which start at the high life, gradually decline and the results become trajic.
I:10465;896;I loved the story, the acting and the violence.
I:10465;897;Without a doubt I was completely pulled right into the story, based on some real life people and events.
I:10465;898;Martin Scorcese's direction keeps the action flowing.
I:10465;899;The relationship between the stars, Robert DeNiro and Sharon Stone, sizzles.
I:10465;900;And the musical score enhances the action and keeps the story upbeat, sad and violent all at the same time.
I:10465;901;the story of love and money and corruption is a universal one.
I:10465;902;I loved every moment of it.
I:10465;903;And, even if you've seen it before, it's worth a second look.
I:10465;904;This time, Scorsese even gathers up a lot of the same cast, including Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci (who does brilliant work as always).
I:10465;905;"But ""Casino"" only has one real star: Las Vegas."
I:10465;906;Among the fellow cast members are excellent performances by James Woods and Sharon Stone, who received an Oscar Nomination for her role of Ginger, a former prostitute who becomes Sam's wife and eventually breaks down in a twister of sex, greed and drug abuse.
I:10465;907;The movie is really good, even though it touches familiar territory, and has the kind of storytelling that I really love in Martin Scorsese.
I:10465;908;Now that I think of it, a commentary track by the cast members would've been nice, especially since this was the film that gave a serious boost to Sharon Stone's career, not only giving her an Oscar Nomination, but also gaining her the respect of a lot of critics.
I:10465;909;This is a very good movie for those that like a good gangster movie.
I:10465;910;Joe Pesci steals the show and DeNiro shadows.
I:10465;911;everything turned out ok.you were quick to respond and i will order from you again.
I:10465;912;The mob runs rampant beneath the glitz and glitter as we see the stark contrast of blood money and the beautiful people who own beautiful things.
I:10465;913;Casino shows the rise of a casino owner with mob connections (Robert De Niro), his friend and Mafia underboss (Joe Pesci) and in ex.
I:10465;914;prostitute with a strong will and expensive taste (Sharon Stone).
I:10465;915;Those who like casino and/or gangster movies will find sheer joy in this film about both.
I:10465;916;Scorcese has proved himself to be a truly remarkable director and this film shows why.
I:10465;917;He knows how to handle characters, scenes and even adds in a few of his own tricks.
I:10465;918;Sure, it has some of the qualities that made Goodfellas so cool, but Casino is its own movie doing its own thing.
I:10465;919;Acting: everyone here is excellent.
I:10465;920;Of course, DeNiro and Pesci are absolutely remarkable, but so is Sharon Stone as DeNiro's wife.
I:10465;921;This ranks as one of Martin Scorcese's best films.
I:10465;922;This is by far one of Martin scorsese's best film's and always will be.
I:10465;923;Robert Richerdson's Photography is brillent and the performances are wonderful from the whole cast.
I:10465;924;But its still a very brillent picture.
I:10465;925;One of my personal favorite movies of all time.
I:10465;926;I would recommend it to anyone to watch, especially if you love mafia related movies.
I:10465;927;doesnt get any more candid and honest.
I:10465;928;the cast and director made sumthing epic and timeless.
I:10465;929;This movie is one of the great masterpieces of the 1990's.
I:10465;930;The script is full of great lines, even the narration running through the first hour is a wonder of writing.
I:10465;931;The way in which 1970's Vegas is captured is unsurpassed .
I:10465;932;the look of the famous 'Strip' from those days has to be seen to be believed.
I:10465;933;And the acting is way above anything else in this genre.
I:10465;934;The fact that the movie was filmed inside an actual Vegas casino dating from the '70s just before it was demolished (the Riviera) helps take the film above the 'movie.
I:10465;935;look' and into the realm of a documentary.
I:10465;936;These characters are real and the world they inhabit is a real one.
I:10465;937;this is surely one of the milestones in movie history .
I:10465;938;Like Scorsese's 'GoodFellas,' this production holds up as bathroom reading.
I:10465;939;It even works on broadcast TV, with bleeping and commercials.
I:10465;940;It's that perfect and enjoyable.
I:10465;941;Of many of Robert De Niro's films, Casino is a classic!
I:10465;942;This film has a lot more action than GoodFellas and makes it even more interesting to watch.
I:10465;943;Bob DeNiro is SO good in it.
I:10465;944;even down to the extras its good acting.
I:10465;945;she leaves looking at him and laughing.
I:10465;946;this movie also has some good, old time songs.
I:10465;947;even i can't watch manyo its scenes they are so realistic and gruesome.
I:10465;948;one of the bset movies ever made!
I:10465;949;Almost as good as Goodfellas, which is the best real life mob movie ever made.
I:10465;950;The Godfather is great, but it is fiction and very stylized.
I:10465;951;If you loved Goodfellas, you'll love Casino.
I:10465;952;But makes a good date night movie, especially fans of Robert De Niro.
I:10465;953;thanks for reading my review.
I:10465;954;bobby de niro is known for appering in ganster and mobster movies and making them great.
I:10465;955;He moves to Las Vegas and is put in charge of an up and coming casino and takes it to the top.
I:10465;956;He is in awe of a beautiful girl who has a nack for being were the money is they utimitley get married.
I:10465;957;Somebody in way back in the town where they came from gives them all away.
I:10465;958;This a graphic movie and has a ton of vilonce but it is a great movie and is one of De Niro's and Pesci's best defintly not as good of GOODFEELAS though.
I:10465;959;Even though their is not any good extras I recommened you get it because it is a classic in it's own way.
I:10465;960;I order movies CONSTANLY, so this is a great addition to the collection.
I:10465;961;Fast Shipping, Great Price and an even better movie.
I:10465;962;After the excellent Goodfellas Scorcese, DeNiro and Pesci team up again for another crime movie.
I:10465;963;the music is good however, ranging from the 50s to 80s and very out there and part of the music.
I:10465;964;Pesci is the best, deNiro his usual self but never super like in Raging Bull.
I:10465;965;visually, the film is very bright, with the neon lights of the casino, and Robert De Niro's colour blinding suits (who puts pink and orange together?!)
I:10465;966;i thought Sharon Stone's role was the best out of the entire film, as her character goes through such a journey during the film, and the physical changes in her character are shocking.
I:10465;967;Wonderful portrayal of the characters by De Niro, Stone, and Pesci.
I:10465;968;The always unpredictable performance of Mr. Pesci's is fantastic.
I:10465;969;tempered, arrogant, and paranoid, but also capable of humor, loyalty and a certain weird charm.
I:10465;970;Some would say he was just playing the same character again, and yeah, he is, but he's so damn good at it, who cares?Bobby D is superb (what else?)
I:10465;971;Y is going to interfere with their profits and get away unscathed.
I:10465;972;I recommend it to anyone with a gangland fetish, 80's nostalgia and strong stomach.
I:10465;973;I love his movie more than any other.
I:10465;974;All that I want is commentary.
I:10465;975;The film itself gets 5 stars IMO, but the way it was filmed, combined with the bright lights of Las Vegas, makes this one of the most beautiful cinematic experiences i have ever had.
I:10465;976;But like Goodfellows, Casino is the best of the best BELOW the caliber of Godfather.
I:10465;977;"And for the ""new bar"" then Casino is the best (along with GoodFellows) and I highly suggest that you get this movie and keep it in your home library."
I:10465;978;Excellent upgrade from the SD.
I:10465;979;Great movie to the book and American Justice.
I:10465;980;was in the condition that is was described and works great, this is a classic movie my husband loves it thanks!
I:10465;981;Joe Pesi tries to mussell in and he plays a great part.
I:10465;982;Robert DeNiro is BRILLIANT as always and Sharon Stone was so good in her role as a drug and alcohol addicted slut, that I enjoyed hating her.
I:10465;983;I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't already seen it.
I:10465;984;great movie on blu ray.
I:10465;985;De Niro's role as charismatic and aspiring gangster struggling to manage his business and keep the reckless fellow gangsters out of his way was truly engaging.
I:10465;986;This movie is a classic and is enjoyable every time!
I:10465;987;I've been a huge Scorcese/DeNiro fan since 'Taxi Driver', and love all of their movies.
I:10465;988;My favorite gangster movies of the last 30 years are Godfather I II, Once Upon A Time in America, Goodfellas and this movie.
I:10465;989;I put Goodfellas at #1, and Casino at #2.
I:10465;990;watching the talents of Scorsese and DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone and James Woods in this film is a truly enjoyable movie experience.
I:10465;991;she held her own and was outstanding.
I:10465;992;It stands tall on it's own.
I:10465;993;This is one of my all time great Movies, I enjoy the story about how Las Vegas has grown from the 1950 to what it is like in 2013.
I:10465;994;Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci are outstanding in the movie.
I:10465;995;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!
I:10465;996;Robert Di Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone are all awesome.
I:10465;997;This has it all great action, the mob, and crime, and scaming people out of their money!
I:10465;998;I loved Goodfellas but this is 10 times the movie, trust me if you love mob movies you'll love this and if you love De Niro you will love Casino as well.
I:10465;999;Great movie I give it 10 out of 5 stars!
I:10465;1000;I can watch this movie over and over and still be entertained and inrtigued.
I:10465;1001;Sharon Stone cheese and rice, gave an oscar winning performance as deniro's wife who pretty much has a breakdown and turns into an addict, alcoholioc, and raving lunatic.
I:10465;1002;She was gorgeous at the beginning with her long blonde hair, and 70's outfits and hair do.
I:10465;1003;And Robert Deniro was smoking hot!
I:10465;1004;This was one of his last movies where he still looked great for his age.
I:10465;1005;He is older now, but still looks pretty good.
I:10465;1006;I play it in one of my cheapo players and it works fine.
I:10465;1007;Goodfellas is a very popular critically acclaimed movie and considered by many to be Scorcese's finest work but I have to honestly say that I enjoyed this movie almost every bit as much.
I:10465;1008;He is after all the finest actor of his generation and he like the rest of the cast (including, surprisingly, Sharon Stone) are on top form here.
I:10465;1009;"De Niro is fantastic in this movie as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein and he is ably supported by Joe Pesci in what is admittedly basically a reprisal (but none the less a very good reprisal) of his psychopath role in Goodfellas."
I:10465;1010;This is definitely not for everybody but it is essential viewing for people who, like me, enjoy 'gangster' movies that are long, gritty and realistic.
I:10465;1011;Unmissable for fans of Scorcese, De Niro, Pesci and Sharon Stone in a career best (Oscar nominated) screen performance.
I:10465;1012;Rickles steals the movie as the DeNiro's sidekick, great scene in the movie where he tries to throw Joe Pesci out of the casino and Pesci goes ballistic and slams Rickles upside the head with a telephone.
I:10465;1013;deNiro, Pesce,and especially Sharon Stone shine in this film about Vegas and the Chicago mob.
I:10465;1014;The acting is great, with unexpected great performances from Sharon Stone and James Woods.
I:10465;1015;I think This eight and final collaberation of DeNiro and Scorsese is great.
I:10465;1016;Sam Ace Mckenna(Robert DeNiro) is the smartest gambler in Vegas.
I:10465;1017;Then Oscar nominated Sharon Stone delivers a stunning performance as Ginger Mckenna.
I:10465;1018;Director: Martin Scorsese Cast:Robert DeNiro,Sharon Stone,Joe Pesci,and James Woods
I:10465;1019;Casino is an excellent film about the rise and fall of an empire in the gambling haven, Las Vegas.
I:10465;1020;robert DeNiro plays Sam Ace Rothstein, a cunning and smart business man who gets into the casino business.
I:10465;1021;He is given a casino to run, mostly because of his reputation for always winning, by the mob who get their cuts of the money one way or the other (i. e. lying, stealing, murdering, etc.).
I:10465;1022;This film held my interest the entire time and had me wondering what was going to happen next.
I:10465;1023;This is one to see.
I:10465;1024;Mr. Robert DeNiro always come through and gives a stellar performance!!!
I:10465;1025;This is one of my all time favorite movies for 3 simple reasons.
I:10465;1026;1) Robert DeNiro is my favorite actor 2)Martin Scorsese is my favorite Director 3) and I LOVE gangster movies.
I:10465;1027;Everybody who has seen this movie knows how good it is so I dont have to say much.
I:10465;1028;I even got my girlfriend to watch it.
I:10465;1029;(only because she made me watch Dirty Dancing) and she thought it was a good movie.
I:10465;1030;So just give it a chance and it wont disappoint.
I:10465;1031;Casino is the best mafia film I've ever seen.
I:10465;1032;Pesci's portrayal of psychopath Nicki Santoro is brilliant.
I:10465;1033;What is shown is the epic rise and fall of power in the underworld of Vegas.
I:10465;1034;And, it is shown quite brilliantly.
I:10465;1035;I especially liked the fact that it didn't try to show some twisted value in it because there really is none.
I:10465;1036;There are many people who grew up in this mold that is so brilliantly portrayed in this film, and who am I to judge them.
I:10465;1037;He is a genius for turning his experience into art.
I:10465;1038;still an all time favorite
I:10465;1039;Let me tell you something, this three hour epic looks mind numbingly stunning.
I:10465;1040;This is an entertaining Scorsese mafia take.
I:10465;1041;With a brutally entertaining story and top notch acting, this film is stabbingly great.
I:10465;1042;This movie easily fits in with the Big ones.
I:10465;1043;This is a must own for fans of the organized crime genre.
I:10465;1044;Just what I like, Just what I like, Just what I like
I:10465;1045;rothstein (Robert De Niro) is a seasoned gambler with a history as a professional sports bettor.
I:10465;1046;Filled with all of Scorsese's trademarks and marks the 8th pairing of Scorsese and DeNiro.
I:10465;1047;director team since John Ford and John Wayne.
I:10465;1048;Among it's shortcoming is it's epic length, it's just a little too ambitious.
I:10465;1049;The first third of the film plays life a fascinating inside documentary on the Las Vegas moneymaking machine.
I:10465;1050;It starts out well enough, fast paced and with long camera sequences that reminded me of 'Goodfellas'.
I:10465;1051;Sharon Stone on the other hand delivers a mesmerizing performance as a beautiful call girl that catches DeNiro's eye and then marries him.
I:10465;1052;But still, Sharon Stone's performance was astonishing and got her a much.
I:10465;1053;deserved Oscar Nomination, her first and only nomination.
I:10465;1054;Pesci basically repeats the performance that won him and Oscar in 1990 with 'Goodfellas', he's the same hot.
I:10465;1055;"Filled with all of Scorsese's trademarks
I:10465;1056;over, instantaneous mad bursts of violence and impressive use of cinematography and editing.
I:10465;1057;From a scale of 1.10 I give this film a 7!
I:10465;1058;Casino is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:10465;1059;There are plenty of other reviews that go into details on this, so I will simply say that it is a masterpiece.
I:10465;1060;This version plays and looks great.
I:10465;1061;My father loved this movie, and was very happy it was in Full Screen!
I:10465;1062;Casino is about relationships between characters in and around organized crime and gambling, and it's about the arc that an entire city of pleasure takes over these people.
I:10465;1063;it's Scorsese and Pileggi and DeNiro and Pesci and Frank Vincent again and it's a top.
I:10465;1064;Ace is a gambling master, a sure.
I:10465;1065;In order to better 'manage', the Outfit also sends Nicky Santoro, a crafty but hot.
I:10465;1066;Ginger is still involved with her old pimp, for one.
I:10465;1067;the film looks gorgeous, it has to be one of Scorsese's biggest budgets.
I:10465;1068;they manage to scrounge up enough un.
I:10465;1069;touched 70s Vegas left, and they film in real casinos quite a bit.
I:10465;1070;"the film is three hours long
I:10465;1071;If you listen to some people who say 'It's like Goodfellas, but not as good', well, you can let them think for you.
I:10465;1072;It's as good as Goodfellas, and arguably better.
I:10465;1073;"Greedy ""broad"" to use the vernacular of the era."
I:10465;1074;but the movie itself is classic Scorsese.
I:10465;1075;Here we have Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci working together again (Goodfellas), also, Sharon Stone, Don Rickles and James Woods adds nice performances as well, all the actors are good in this, even if it's only a small part.
I:10465;1076;lots of violence, lots of language, great acting, great story, and you get this great movie.
I:10465;1077;Indeed, it is long, but well worth watching, same with The Godfather 1&2, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Goodfellas and many more.
I:10465;1078;Paradise, we reaaaally managed to f*ck it all up
I:10465;1079;i Highly reccomend this wonderful movie.
I:10465;1080;I think Casino is on top of the list of best contemporaty films ever made.
I:10465;1081;The combination of plot, location scenes and superb acting makes if one of the very best.
I:10465;1082;and you ccan add my vote with the the same comments for the best western ever made .
I:10465;1083;The acting is top notch.
I:10465;1084;The shots of vegas are very nice.
I:10465;1085;The movie even has some comical relief at times.
I:10465;1086;Parts of the story took place in reality.
I:10465;1087;This is one my favorite movies of all time.
I:10465;1088;Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are always great together, and Sharon Stone is one of best actresses of all time.
I:10465;1089;this movie is everything you like about Scorcese: gangsters, clever voice over narration by the characters, stop action narration, and complex, horribly flawed, fascinating characters.
I:10465;1090;But still and excellent movie.
I:10465;1091;What a great movie to watch with a few friends.
I:10465;1092;I say that this is Pesci at his finest because he plays his role to finest.
I:10465;1093;DeNiro is so good in this film, but I say second best, because I think that 'The Mission' was his finnest piece of work.
I:10465;1094;Another recconmended movie with a wonderful cast including Jeremy Irons.
I:10465;1095;well prety close to anyway, the same cast.
I:10465;1096;Casino is one of my favorite all time movies and the Blue Ray transfer is impeccable.
I:10465;1097;this is the type of movie you show your friends.
I:10465;1098;This was the best movie I have seen in a while.
I:10465;1099;The actors were brilliant and this movie had everything right as a mobster tale from the beginning to the end!
I:10465;1100;It is very similar in style and tone to this earlier film.
I:10465;1101;"this similarity detracts from its impact somewhat but ""Casino"" is still a very good film."
I:10465;1102;It contains many memorable moments, good music, and is stylishly directed by Scorsese.
I:10465;1103;i have always loved pesci and deniro and together they make this one of the best mafia movies ever made
I:10465;1104;I don't recommend it to anyone
I:10465;1105;"In some ways, Scorsese's most entertaining and interesting film, close in approach to Goodfellas, as it is seen through the eyes of a main character: previously, Henry Hill, here, ""Sam Rothstein""."
I:10465;1106;if she's spaced out on drugs how is she able to morph instantaneously into the perfect host?In this Reviewers' opinion, with Casino, we have Robert DeNiro's greatest performance.
I:10465;1107;"He too is schizophrenic, as he is the street tough in one scene and the sensitive, vulnerable ""contemporary"" man."
I:10465;1108;But if his character is perhaps not fully developed, his range is amazing.
I:10465;1109;"He's compelling as hard driven businessmanand ""laeding man"" romantic, in some excellent scenes with Stone."
I:10465;1110;joe Pesci is the third actor who delivers an Oscar.
I:10465;1111;worthy performance, though his character seems more rooted to New York than Kansas City.
I:10465;1112;Good acting, good acters, a good 3 star 1995 movie.
I:10465;1113;And even though Casino has less action then Goodfellas, it still manages to suck the audience in.
I:10465;1114;Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci both beautifully develop despicable characters, the kind of people you just can't stand, while De Niro rises above them all to become a character the audience can identify with.
I:10465;1115;perhaps one of the best attributes to this film is how they get gambling right.
I:10465;1116;But Scorcese's film is as authentic as it gets.
I:10465;1117;And that's important in a film where you need to believe is real.
I:10465;1118;But this movie is great in its own rights, and should be viewed without thoughts of his previous film.
I:10465;1119;casino is a must see film, with great depth of character, plot, and even a surprising twist at the end.
I:10465;1120;Scorcese's still at the top of the game in Casino.
I:10465;1121;The entire cast is amazing.
I:10465;1122;The best Martin Scorsese film i've seen since Goodfellas.
I:10465;1123;robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci(the best of the cast), Sharon Stone and the rest of the cast are just amazingly good to watch and see what can do on any film they have made late in their own careers.
I:10465;1124;time Classic film and a Worth.
I:10465;1125;ray is a great investment for this film because of length as well as the cinematography.
I:10465;1126;I thought the story moved kind of slow,and the ending was not very satisfying (to me anyway).
I:10465;1127;Don't get me wrong, I like DeNiro in this movie and he played it well, but Pesci was a lot more interesting and engaging.
I:10465;1128;Overall, this is a pretty good film, although there are some flaws.
I:10465;1129;De Niro, Pesci, Stone and Woods are all excellent.
I:10465;1130;he is clearly one of the most talented filmmakers alive today.
I:10465;1131;Taxi, Cape Fear, Goodfellas, his foray into edith wharton .
I:10465;1132;the great acting of de niro, pesce, stone and woods, the screenplay, the cinematography .
I:10465;1133;I had a friend who was always telling me I had to watch this movie.
I:10465;1134;Sharon Stone should have won an award for her role as Ginger McKenna.
I:10465;1135;I think her performance showed a lot of character, with the problems she developed with cocaine and liquor, and her great acting really was exposed when she was feuding with DeNiro, and she looked good for 42.
I:10465;1136;She slept with a childhood friend of her husband, Joe Pesci's character Nick Santoro, so she was made to look like. . . well, you know.
I:10465;1137;This was all based on a true story, so the viewer is learning what it's like inside a real casino.
I:10465;1138;I'm actually surprised, because I read those reviews before I watched the movie, and there were a lot more gross scenes (a man being stabbed to death, two people being buried alive in the same grave).
I:10465;1139;anyhow, the 70's and the 80's were brought back nicely.
I:10465;1140;This was a really great movie.
I:10465;1141;Peschi and Deniro are at the top of their game.
I:10465;1142;This is the best movie about the mob and Las Vegas that you will ever see, bar none!!
I:10465;1143;Scorsese is a cinematic genius.
I:10465;1144;it is a masterpiece everyone should see this film i got an A in my film class from this movie
I:10465;1145;I think this is one of the best movies ever made.
I:10465;1146;I ordered the special edition and it arrived.
I:10465;1147;I am very happy with it.
I:10465;1148;AMAZON, please correct this so you don't end up with a bunch of returns.
I:10465;1149;This movie seems to have everything a great story requires: a colorful setting, fascinating characters, an action.
I:10465;1150;He wants to be a loving, devoted husband and father.
I:10465;1151;He was so good that whenever he bets, he could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country.
I:10465;1152;Genius at what he was doing with numbers, he proved to a lot of guys in the Chicago Mob that he was a tremendous earner that he could make a lot of money for them.
I:10465;1153;As a result, he was able to accomplish whatever bookmaking, handicapping, he wanted to do, with the umbrella of protection from those guys.
I:10465;1154;Anyway with such a sexy wife and money to burn, 'Ace' was the epitome of opulence, confidence and power.
I:10465;1155;ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) was fascinating.
I:10465;1156;Great woman, truly beautiful, one of the best.
I:10465;1157;sharon Stone really stood up to the challenge in her role as a casino hustler who is so wild.
I:10465;1158;She was young, fresh, confident, looking absolutely fantastic as the independent woman whom everybody desires.
I:10465;1159;joe Pesci succeeds in his scary tough role as the strong man who has nerve, and isn't afraid of the cops.
I:10465;1160;Nicky's mission was to show his worth to the family as an enforcer.
I:10465;1161;This movie is a classic, and now a classic in Hi Def.
I:10465;1162;The colors are so vibrant, a must for any gangster collection, or any De Niro collection
I:10465;1163;Casino is probably the best movie of the 1990's.
I:10465;1164;The three main characters are grotesque but sympathetic due to the superb performances of DeNiro, Stone and Pesci.
I:10465;1165;Casino takes an intriguing story and wraps it around three fascinating characters.
I:10465;1166;The result is pure cinematic genius.
I:10465;1167;sharon Stone plays a frighteningly realistic slut with a grudge to settle.
I:10465;1168;She serves as the Helen in this film .
I:10465;1169;Its triumph is in the mirror that it holds to us.
I:10465;1170;I definitely recommend this movie!
I:10465;1171;Decent movie with amazing actors.
I:10465;1172;The end is very powerful and made me depressed cause it was so disturbing but that's a movies job.
I:10465;1173;It could have been shorter but its worth your money.
I:10465;1174;Casino features much of the same cast as the excellent film Goodfellas with Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro returning as gangsters, this time in Las Vegas.
I:10465;1175;pesci and DeNiro turn in fine performances as enforcer and casino boss respectively.
I:10465;1176;She literally becomes the role, and ultimately dominates the latter portion of the film.
I:10465;1177;the storyline is brisk, and the explanation of the workings of the Vegas mob are very interesting.
I:10465;1178;The film never takes itself too seriously, and there are many absolutely hilarious parts to the film.
I:10465;1179;basically an excellent adult film that retains the viewer's interest, tells an interesting story, and features very fine performances by the cast.
I:10465;1180;Scorsese has produced yet another masterpiece .
I:10465;1181;from start to finish this will have you hooked.
I:10465;1182;All the leads are fantastic, lending depth and credibility to the characters .
I:10465;1183;Stone in particular gives a career best performance as Aces drugged.
I:10465;1184;up wife, while DeNiro does another solid turn.
I:10465;1185;time classic up there with the likes of GoodFellas and Scarface.
I:10465;1186;that said, most interesting, engrossing, story and characters.
I:10465;1187;An absolute most see for anyone who enjoys film.
I:10465;1188;Martin Scorsese shows why he's the best action director in the business.
I:10465;1189;excellent product, most bang for your buck.
I:10465;1190;I think this is the best.
I:10465;1191;I loved Magnolia and Gone With The Wind so don't even attempt to criticize.
I:10465;1192;For Rothstein, Vegas is the realization of a dream .
I:10465;1193;Played by Joe Pesci, Nicky is a one.
I:10465;1194;Rothstein's other thorn is the woman who will become his wife, Sharon Stone as Ginger, a hustler who will eventually steal, then break Rothstein's heart.
I:10465;1195;(Santoro is easily more of a hazard than a help.)
I:10465;1196;All I want to share with you, is how wonderful the appearences from Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone are.
I:10465;1197;A good movie, but nowhere near deserving the ammount of acclaim that Goodfellas received.
I:10465;1198;One breath of fresh air is Sharon Stone's great performance as Ginger, a cardshark herself not to mention a temptress.
I:10465;1199;Bottom line, if you are a fan of Deniro, Pesci or just the Mob, this film is worth seeing.
I:10465;1200;I mainly bought this movie for my Dad as a gift because although he had seen and adored the movie Goodfellas (which had a lot of the same cast members as this movie), he had never seen it, so I thought it would be good for him to add it to his library.
I:10465;1201;I've seen it several times and I still enjoy it very much.
I:10465;1202;A must see for sure!
I:10465;1203;If you love the mobster life you will love this movie!
I:10465;1204;I think I have enjoyed this movie my whole life!
I:10465;1205;I guess it is expected that a few people may not like this movie, but I promise the majority will like this one.
I:10465;1206;i must add that I especially liked the baseball bat beating.
I:10465;1207;"The first hour of ""Casino"" (1995) represents Martin Scorsese at his best ."
I:10465;1208;masterpiece of cinematic bravado depicting the inner workings of a Las Vegas pleasure palace.
I:10465;1209;Casino features a vast and rich cast of characters, all of whom have pitch.
I:10465;1210;perfect arcs, which are accentuated by spot.
I:10465;1211;on performances, and a cinematic style which is both engaging and masterfully paced.
I:10465;1212;Every element of the picture, superfluous though some may seem, adds to the grandeur of the characters, the scenery, and the Scorsese.
I:10465;1213;casino is my favorite Scorsese picture, and one of the best films ever made.
I:10465;1214;Scorsece made 3 masterpieces in his career so far, Gangs of New York (his best), Goodfellas (second best), and this (his third).
I:10465;1215;They are all great films, very close, each one is a true masterpiece.
I:10465;1216;They are all very entertaining crime dramas, and all are shocking, dramatic, well performned, very well crafted, very great films.
I:10465;1217;But the GONY, Goodfellas, and this are great, of course Godfather is still the best in this genre, but those three are very close.
I:10465;1218;one of my all time favorite movies nonetheless, I'll just trade it in for the other edition at some point.
I:10465;1219;I'd really appreciate any other person's comments in regards to this matter.
I:10465;1220;Pesci, Dinero and the rest of them are always great but thumbs up to Stone!
I:10465;1221;See it if you have about 3 hours on hand.
I:10465;1222;the level of detail is amazing.
I:10465;1223;You get totally immersed in Las Vegas life, both the rich and gilded side, and the depraved underbelly.
I:10465;1224;You also get a lot of detail about what the mob operations were like and how a casino works on the inside, from the level of dealer to the level of management.
I:10465;1225;"robert De Niro is great as Sam Rothstein
I:10465;1226;What a performance as Ginger, the high.
I:10465;1227;class call girl who captures Sam's heart.
I:10465;1228;"She's gorgeous, greedy, volatile and surprisingly vulnerable at certain points
I:10465;1229;as for Joe Pesci, his character is kind of a repeat from Goodfellas.
I:10465;1230;That is an undeniable fact.
I:10465;1231;imagine Goodfellas without Ray Liotta and his oddly charming narration.
I:10465;1232;You'll end up with something like this.
I:10465;1233;Leo is younger and much more handsome.
I:10465;1234;I was very happy about this product, it arrived on time and in the describe way it was supposed to arrive, I was happy and thanks once again
I:10465;1235;Brutal, honest, but not as good as the Godfather l and ll.
I:10465;1236;If your into these types of movies you will enjoy it.
I:10465;1237;The movie is good at going behind the scenes of what is up with the gambling industry and the mob.
I:10465;1238;NOT suitable for children under the age of 18!
I:10465;1239;oK enough gripes, Joe Pesci is terrifying again, DeNiro is excellent and best of all Sharon Stone gives a fabulous performance and was deservedly nominated for best actress in the 1996 Academy awards.
I:10465;1240;if you haven't seen Goodfellas you'll probably love this.
I:10465;1241;If you have then you'll see that it is the work of a master filmmaker, but its not quite up to the same standard as his earlier masterpiece.
I:10465;1242;I'm a De Niro fan.
I:10465;1243;All of the actors a great in this movie.
I:10465;1244;Sharon Stone was the best thing in this movie and she definitely deserves her Oscar nomination on this performance.
I:10465;1245;Casino is a great movie .
I:10465;1246;The animorphic widescreen transfer is far from perfect .
I:10465;1247;A great deal of it is shot with De Niro doing a voice.
I:10465;1248;over, telling the story as he went, which I really liked.
I:10465;1249;The way a casino was run and how it all relates back to mob control was fascinating to see and the various tricks the customers and casino owners use are pretty inventive.
I:10465;1250;Some parts of this film are pretty graphic, as to be expected from Scorcese, but the story overall is gripping and kept me engaged the whole time.
I:10465;1251;The extras disc is excellent, with some great featurettes and bonus material to really add to your understanding of the film.
I:10465;1252;This is a great gangster type movie and brilliantly directed and acted.
I:10465;1253;I've given it 3 stars because it gets the one by default for the great movie it is, another for the digital remastering efforts, and an extra one for the lone good feature it has salvaged (keep reading).
I:10465;1254;And let me tell you, it's usually Sharon Stone .
I:10465;1255;the Good: The History Channel documentary featuring Nicholas Pilleggi offers the most insight .
I:10465;1256;including real interviews with Ace, and great footage of the other characters (including Tony Spilotro .
I:10465;1257;otherwise the movie is still on the top.
I:10465;1258;One of the best mob movies ever made!It's about time that they put it on blue.
I:10465;1259;A great transfer to Blu Ray.
I:10465;1260;The movie as a whole, including the transfer to Blu Ray stays at 5 stars for me.
I:10465;1261;the extras include a few outtakes which they say are deleted scenes, a 15 minute documentary on the real gangsters and start of Las Vegas and a nice 45 minute reprint of a History channel documentary about the truth of the story and characters portrayed in Casino.
I:10465;1262;all I can say is that the video transfer to blu ray is DEMO worthy and the upgrade from Standard Def to Blu Ray is well worth it.
I:10465;1263;A lady gets shot through the side of the head, and you're left seeing blood squirt from the wound as she crumples to the floor.
I:10465;1264;Pesci is totally hilarious as his usual loose.
I:10465;1265;The biggest surprise, though, was Rickles.
I:10465;1266;Casino skips right over those things and opens, oddly, in documentary style (not just, I always wanted to be a gangster. )
I:10465;1267;Do you enjoy good movies?
I:10465;1268;I can't reccomend this movie enough, it's THAT good.
I:10465;1269;It's long, about 3hrs but its well worth it.
I:10465;1270;Excellent story/actors make this a must see movie.
I:10465;1271;Scorsese took on an interesting topic and had an opportunity to create a masterpiece.
I:10465;1272;The film succeeds more as a documentary than as a gangster movie.
I:10465;1273;The movie also wastes a magnificent cast.
I:10465;1274;DeNiro, one of the greatest living actors, is given little to do as mobster Sam Rothstein.
I:10465;1275;Sharon Stone gives an overrated performance as DeNiro's wife.
I:10465;1276;The great James Woods is given a completely thankless role as Stone's boyfriend.
I:10465;1277;sure it reminds people of goodfellas but this movie is based on a true story.
I:10465;1278;maybe a little long but good.
I:10465;1279;robert deniro is good in anything.
I:10465;1280;it is a great movie and if you liked goodfellas, you will like this one also.
I:10465;1281;"so a film whose central idea is about the inevitable downfall of crime betrays its central idea by making the characters ""cool"" and full of ""attitude"" and glorifying them."
I:10465;1282;I feel films like Casino and many of his other works are mostly show.
I:10465;1283;"This shows through most obviously through the abundant voice overs that tell us how ""cool"" the characters are and tells us the changes that are happening as opposed to showing us through action and consequence."
I:10465;1284;It's voice overs certainly make it documentary.
I:10465;1285;But its glorification of how cool these guys subjectively tells us to sympathize with these criminals on their inevitable demise.
I:10465;1286;it has a glittering, glamorous face, as well as a brutal, cruel one.
I:10465;1287;Seen through their eyes, each as a foil to the other, the details of mob involvement in the casinos of the 1970's and '80's are revealed.
I:10465;1288;Casino is an interesting film considering the fact you have to stay on your toes when it comes to the plot.
I:10465;1289;Robert DeNiro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci are great as wanna be gangster.
I:10465;1290;I got the movie quicker than I thought.
I:10465;1291;And the movie was great.
I:10465;1292;I will keep this short.
I:10465;1293;Nonetheless, it's an irrestistible glimpse at the mob scene in Vegas, and it's chock full of stellar performances.
I:10465;1294;DeNiro also shines in his role as Rothstein, looking dapper in his flawlessly.
I:10465;1295;But the film's revelation is Sharon Stone, who radiates as De Niro's love.
I:10465;1296;She was rightfully nominated for an Oscar, but, to this day, she has never since had a role worth our while as this.
I:10465;1297;lite, but, at nearly 3 hours, it's good enough to glue your eyes to the screen.
I:10465;1298;In one word Casino is: Awesome.
I:10465;1299;It stars the dynamic duo of Robert De Niro and Joe Pecsi.
I:10465;1300;This team made a number of great movies together, this arguably the best of the bunch.
I:10465;1301;Casino tells the story of Las Vegas: how it started and also how it ended.
I:10465;1302;His attention to detail is extensive to say the least.
I:10465;1303;Pesci really hit the mark on this one.
I:10465;1304;Casino also includes a star studded cast of excellent players including: Sharon Stone (plays Ginger, Ace's wife, a role that earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress), Frank Vincent, Don Rickles, James Woods, and many others.
I:10465;1305;This film is full of great music, style, and ultimately many life lessons.
I:10465;1306;It was made at the right time in the right way by Martin Scorsese.
I:10465;1307;Casino is a timeless classic.
I:10465;1308;nonstop narration from a lot of the characters.
I:10465;1309;, and, since this is a true story, you can watch the History Channel's show about the real story with the real people.
I:10465;1310;the cameos are great: Don Rickles, Dick Smothers, L. q. Jones, even Joe Bob Briggs.
I:10465;1311;cASINO is a sprawling but finely.
I:10465;1312;Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci almost guarantees that it'll be great .
I:10465;1313;worthy performance from Sharon Stone and you have one of the greatest mob flicks of all time.
I:10465;1314;Interesting story, great acting and some classic lines .
I:10465;1315;Martin Scorsese paints a colorful portrait of Las Vegas in the early 1970s as the oasis of glamour and corruption that it was.
I:10465;1316;it possesses the same style.
I:10465;1317;But Casino is still an amazing film.
I:10465;1318;DeNiro carries the movie well, and Pesci has never been more psychopathic.
I:10465;1319;sharon Stone is great as the charming but crazy Ginger, and James Woods is perfect as her sleazy ex.
I:10465;1320;paced and interesting, and the narration is great, especially from DeNiro.You feel like you're sitting across the table from an ex.
I:10465;1321;"Casino may just be ""more of the same,"" but it's still a fascinating, interesting, and superbly entertaining movie."
I:10465;1322;Has some pretty interesting and in.
I:10465;1323;depth special features along with the amazing movie.
I:10465;1324;Great movie with Robert DeNiro in it.
I:10465;1325;You can't go wrong with this movie, you will like it!
I:10465;1326;This is based off a true story as well as a documentary I watched recently.
I:10465;1327;We get exceptional performances from all actors involved, many who came from Goodfellas.
I:10465;1328;Sharon Stone does a decent job here too, as well as James Woods of course.
I:10465;1329;Joe Pesci is really funny and it's interesting how they narrate it like in Goodfellas.
I:10465;1330;This is another great gangster film.
I:10465;1331;This is a great gangster flick, the first hour plays as sort of a documentary about how the gangs influenced las vegas and the corruption that went on.
I:10465;1332;So next time you want to watch a good movie, get casino.
I:10465;1333;Its a sure fire crowd pleaser.
I:10465;1334;It's a masterly piece of work.
I:10465;1335;Unlike Copolla's films which were never intended to be 'true' tales of the mob, Scorcese's are based on solid fact, though it is a tribute to the makers of Casino that such a good story was woven from far less complete and open sources than Goodfellas drew upon (Henry Hill's priceless account being pretty much put on screen verbatim).
I:10465;1336;the two films are usefully seen as two parts of a symphony, both fantastic and enjoyable individually, better understood as part of a larger whole.
I:10465;1337;Scorsese's epic true story about how the mafia build Vegas, is as close to a perfect movie as I have ever seen!
I:10465;1338;The story is just so good and you will be hard pressed to ever find a better pair of performances than the ones by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci.
I:10465;1339;I love this film, I loved it the first time I saw it, and I loved it the hundredth time I saw it.
I:10465;1340;Everything about this movie is pure genius.
I:10465;1341;It's on my top ten list and I suspect will always have its place.
I:10465;1342;Best production of Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci and other classic stars all together that I've ever seen for some time.
I:10465;1343;This is Definitely the BEST mob movie that I have ever seen in my whole history of watching movies.
I:10465;1344;Deniro is amazing in this film.
I:10465;1345;I got this for my husband for Christmas and I was really happy with how fast it showed up and also that it was in great condition!
I:10465;1346;Great acting, great casting, great scripting.
I:10465;1347;This movie is absolutely riveting from start to finish.
I:10465;1348;Very entertaining movie, a must see.
I:10465;1349;This film marks the beginning of Scorsese's decline as a filmmaker.
I:10465;1350;in on the wild popularity of Goodfellas.
I:10465;1351;I thought I was, in the scene in which Pesci hits a man who is over 6 feet tall on the head with a payphone receiver.
I:10465;1352;Pesci is a fine actor, but he plays one character.
I:10465;1353;i'm a big fan of most of Scorsese's work that preceded this film, and some of what followed.
I:10465;1354;good scenes with excellent dialogs
I:10465;1355;Wow, what can I really say about this movie?
I:10465;1356;As others have mentioned, this is kind of a sequel to GoodFellas in that it has a lot of the same people in it of course.
I:10465;1357;"And while I'm sure there are many people who can persuasively argue that GoodFellas is a finer piece of ""cinema,"" Casino stands as proof that the crew really perfected their formula."
I:10465;1358;casino is a long movie and de Niro fills the film with one of his best performances.
I:10465;1359;that said, Casino makes up for this with a really extraordinary portrayal of Ace himself.
I:10465;1360;This movie really makes one happy not to be involved in shady and slick dealings.
I:10465;1361;I highly recommend this movie.
I:10465;1362;classic movie i love it.
I:10465;1363;great job by all the actors.
I:10465;1364;good to watch every now and then
I:10465;1365;Was sort of entertaining .
I:10465;1366;Although she's had duds in her sporadic career, here she is a revelation, exhibiting a wide range of emotion and nuance unseen before or since.
I:10465;1367;Stone is initially exciting and ultimately moving as the wife of casino czar Robert NeNiro.
I:10465;1368;She certainly deserved the Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations she got.
I:10465;1369;In addition to DeNiro, she holds her own with the brilliant Joe Pesci, James Woods, Kevin Pollak and, in real casting coups, Las Vegas figures Don Rickles, Alan King, Dick Smothers in non.
I:10465;1370;It's stunning work no matter how she achieved it.
I:10465;1371;"Casino followed Scorcese's shattering ""GoodFellas,"" also with DeNiro and Pecsi in another true crime classic, maybe his best."
I:10465;1372;"But ""Casino"" has virtures of its own and grabs our lapels throughout."
I:10465;1373;"It is engrossing when showing how casinos operate, less so when showing how distrust wrecks a marriage
I:10465;1374;Although this isn't my normal type of movie this one is a very good movie with a lot of stars.
I:10465;1375;It has a lot of action.
I:10465;1376;It's a great realistic movie about Vegas and gangsters.
I:10465;1377;And the cast here also contains some of the main components of 'Goodfellas', including Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent.
I:10465;1378;This movie may be very long (somewhere around three hours running time), but the length is what adds to the greatness of the film.
I:10465;1379;Getting back to De Niro's main character, you soon see the life of Sam.
I:10465;1380;It's a life that has as many ups and downs as that of a roller coaster.
I:10465;1381;One of those downs, as you begin to see partway into the film, is Joe Pesci's character.
I:10465;1382;It's as simple as that.
I:10465;1383;But nevertheless, Sam and Nicky are good friends.
I:10465;1384;and besides the acting of De Niro and Pesci, actress Sharon Stone gives a brilliant performance that earned her an Oscar nomination.
I:10465;1385;"She plays a dazzling young Ginger who catches the eye of De Niro
I:10465;1386;But the movie's acting and directing is certainly worth your time.
I:10465;1387;This is one of the best movies in the world.
I:10465;1388;Awesome as the day it came out.
I:10465;1389;Definitely one of my favorite Scorsese films, Casino FINALLY gets it's due.
I:10465;1390;length commentary featuring De Niro, Pesci, and Scorsese sitting down to talk through this but the track that is included is still very good.
I:10465;1391;"But enough of that, the movie was well written and Sharon Stone was phenomenal in this true story about a real casino boss Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal, play as Sam ""Ace"" Rothstein (De Niro)."
I:10465;1392;Some great acting all around with Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, James Woods, Alan King, and Don Rickles.
I:10465;1393;Martin Scorsese is in the top tier of directors.
I:10465;1394;"Although ""Casino"" is not as memorable as ""The Departed"", ""Goodfellas"", and ""Taxi Driver"", it's still a great epic on a large scale."
I:10465;1395;"Scorsese, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci team up again for third time since ""Raging Bull"" and it never disappoints."
I:10465;1396;Pesci and Sharon Stone stand out among the cast because De Niro is amazing as usual.
I:10465;1397;One of best crime family movies.
I:10465;1398;I liked it better than Goodfellas, better than Donnie Brasco.
I:10465;1399;Anyone who had it all, got a divorce, and watched his empire evaporate, can live this movie.
I:10465;1400;This movie is an excellent one however looking at other reviews you will find a similar problem.
I:10465;1401;This is a wonderful movie.
I:10465;1402;I am an avid fan of this genre as well as De Niro and Pesci.
I:10465;1403;De Niro turns in his usual excellent performance as the man who can get things done without losing his cool.
I:10465;1404;This in as excellent movie.
I:10465;1405;I bought it tonight and all the way through was perfect.
I:10465;1406;Great storyline and great action.
I:10465;1407;De Niro and Joe Pesci are great actors.
I:10465;1408;If you love Mob style gangster films set around the gambling culture of the LA Strip, then this is a must see for you.
I:10465;1409;Although a long film, at over 3 hours, it is one you will certainly watch time and time again.
I:10465;1410;I've always like this movie and I jumped at the chance to get this at a such a good price!
I:10465;1411;Casino is clever, witty, styilish and its a true story.
I:10465;1412;Casino is a fact based mob movie that stars Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone and James Woods.
I:10465;1413;Casino is one of the best mob movies of all time.
I:10465;1414;DeNiro, Pesci and Stone deliver Oscar worthy performances.
I:10465;1415;The movie is a must see.
I:10465;1416;Casino is an emotional movie and it delivers a strong message.
I:10465;1417;This ranks right up there with Goodfellas and The Godfather parts 1 and 2.
I:10465;1418;The styling of the movie is well done, a very accurare depiction of 70's decor and fashion.
I:10465;1419;The directing, the acting and the story.
I:10465;1420;It's an emotional investment worth the payoff.
I:10465;1421;All of the performances are brilliant, especially the scenes between Sharon Stone and Robert De Niro.
I:10465;1422;"When Sharon Stone finally gets confronted in the Italian restaurant, and Robert DeNiro graps her and she mutters, ""I wouldn't do that if I were you"", I felt the raw emotion of her performance."
