I:8690;1;deal with it, i find this movie and all the others worth it.
I:8690;2;This is followed by the classic food fight.
I:8690;3;with such humor, how can one go wrong?
I:8690;4;This appeals to the teenaged boy in everyone.
I:8690;5;Usually a film arrives with ballyhoo and packed seats and slides down.
I:8690;6;Animal House only picked up steam as more people realized how much fun it was.
I:8690;7;it's humor has permeated our culture.
I:8690;8;There are plenty of familiar faces in this movie.
I:8690;9;Bluto grabs the guitar and smashes it.
I:8690;10;the film also benefits from the writing of Doug Kenney and Harold Ramis.
I:8690;11;the free love and mayhem of Animal House may seem anachronistic in the 21st century but it is a valuable window into that generation of film makers, as well as the prior generation whom they portray.
I:8690;12;If you've never seen it, it's a world expanding experience.
I:8690;13;If you grew up with it, it's just plain fun.
I:8690;14;It is s fun romp through college life in the 60's.
I:8690;15;A great classic and one of the best Lampoon movies.
I:8690;16;Animal House is a simple, basic comedy, but it's funny and it's better than all those copycat movies that came out in the 80s and 90s.
I:8690;17;This is a perfect movie!
I:8690;18;It has lots of funny and crude humor, lots of fighting, lots of wonderful quotes, lots of alcoholic beverages, lots of swearing, lots of hot babes stripping, lots of destruction, lots of everything you'd ever dream of in a movie like this!
I:8690;19;Whatever, I love this movie, and so will you.
I:8690;20;Oh, and the characters were as hilarious as they should have been, too.
I:8690;21;I found out my girlfriend had never seen it so I got it for her to see and she loved it too.
I:8690;22;great classic that everyone should enjoy.
I:8690;23;leased we expect something special of our special editions.
I:8690;24;watch the movie with this feature turned on and gain some trivia.
I:8690;25;Pretty interesting as this interview segment has many of the main characters, director, composer, screen writer, producers and more talk about the making of the movie along with on.
I:8690;26;set stories and behind the scenes footage.
I:8690;27;This is one of my all time favourite movies and was very excited to see it finally on Blu.
I:8690;28;The video transfer and audio are excellent.
I:8690;29;I am very happy to have this in my library again, especially on Blu.
I:8690;30;"*Includes some neat special features

I:8690;32;*This gift set also includes a neat yearbook.
I:8690;33;*The movie itself is a classic comedy, filled with great funny dialogue and funny situations.
I:8690;34;*The storyline is simple but fun.
I:8690;35;*Characters are smashing, and well.
I:8690;36;"acted
I:8690;37;*Soundtrack includes some good classy oldies.
I:8690;38;this movie is one of the most essential comedies ever made.
I:8690;39;The dialogue is completely hilarious.
I:8690;40;acted and great to watch.
I:8690;41;There are a lot of funny memorable moments.
I:8690;42;Highly reccomended to anybody looking for a good laugh.
I:8690;43;A really fantastic and funny movie about collage life.
I:8690;44;i would still recommend this Title though, because its just so funny and the movie itself is so great.
I:8690;45;Come back and enjoy one of the all time great American comedies.
I:8690;46;One of the great films from perhaps the finest decade in the history of filmmaking.
I:8690;47;Certainly a classic film and I also love the music.
I:8690;48;The Delta house serving as a shelter for those such as John Belushi who was in his seventh year of college and nothing to show for it, but a less than 1.0 GPA and Hoover, played by James Widdeos, Hoover just wanted to fit in!This film is a great parody on college life, certainly those of us old enough to remember the 80's and the toga parties, can appreciate this classic.
I:8690;49;This is one film that most people would have to admit is great!
I:8690;50;This is an all time classic and makes me laugh every time I watch it.
I:8690;51;Animal House is a hilarious film about the delta fraternity on the campus of Faber College.
I:8690;52;Watching these charactors pull crazy stunts and getting away with anything they want was both entertaining and funny.
I:8690;53;"I believe that this film is a classic and I recommend it to anybody, especially someone that is going to college because besides all the drinking and what goes on in the ""Animal House,"" these charactors are generally funny, each having a special trait about them that makes you think of somebody that you know."
I:8690;54;I recommend this movie to anybody.
I:8690;55;Animal House is one of those rare films that truly set a new standard in comedy, not just in the sense of clever storytelling, but in raising the bar for celebrating the underdog rebelling against the establishment.
I:8690;56;Any ideas?Despite these issues, I still think Animal House is one comedy that belongs in everyone's collection.
I:8690;57;There are just too many classic lines worth repeating.
I:8690;58;This movie was bought as a gift .
I:8690;59;It has been a favorite classic for as long as I can remember and the blu.
I:8690;60;ray edition will be a great update to the old VHS version sitting on the shelf!
I:8690;61;Funny as ever with classic lines that I still quote today.
I:8690;62;"i just saw ""Revenge of the Nerds"" a little while ago, and it's quite clear where they got some of their best plot lines."
I:8690;63;In fact, beer is a major theme here.
I:8690;64;These are imaginative fellows, even if they don't bother going to class much.
I:8690;65;This is a gift for my son who was just elected president of his fraternity.
I:8690;66;I'd give this movie 6 stars if that was possible.
I:8690;67;In my opinion, Animal House is the funniest movie ever.
I:8690;68;This is no way to enjoy one of the funniest movies ever!
I:8690;69;I'm a little disappointed, but I gave the film 5 stars because it's so funny.
I:8690;70;This is one of the greatest movies of all time in a format that makes the movie seems to come alive even more when you're watching it.
I:8690;71;Granted, Belushi is the staple that hold this film, but there are many others that do so as well.
I:8690;72;The Blues Brothers a classic compared to Animal House?
I:8690;73;In comparison Animal House is a laugh riot.
I:8690;74;If you want to be entertained and are looking for a good poke in the eye of college life, Animal House will fit the bill.
I:8690;75;Animal House is the wacky tale of the Delta fraternity at Faber College that just doesn't seem to fit in.
I:8690;76;A definite must see every week or so because you will never believe what these guys will do for a good time and it causes you to have one as well.
I:8690;77;There are few films I treasure as much as Animal House.
I:8690;78;It is to creative comedy what Mozart is to music.
I:8690;79;Animal House is gloriously politically incorrect and harkens back to a time when we used to accept the inconsistency, selfishness, and unpredictability of human nature.
I:8690;80;minded reasons because it's a rollicking laugh riot and it lifts your spirits.
I:8690;81;I was so excited when this special edition came out, I bought it right away.
I:8690;82;By the time the main feature finally comes on, I am out of snacks and I have to pee.
I:8690;83;"I will always love this movie, and the extra ""where are they now"" was cool."
I:8690;84;Makes me want to join a POS frat house and tear it up!
I:8690;85;I saw Animal House, I liked Animal House.
I:8690;86;Animal House is the kind of movie that nearly everyone can laugh at .
I:8690;87;The humor is far from sophisticated but proudly so .
I:8690;88;The film is so well.
I:8690;89;"known that it certainly needs no introduction from me
I:8690;90;it is also significant for many other reasons, not least in being the launching pad for many people and things.
I:8690;91;Animal House was the first National Lampoon film, establishing a franchise that remains successful despite perhaps never equaling this.
I:8690;92;More obviously, it was the first successful film .
I:8690;93;Most of them have gone on to notable and varied careers, but Animal House remains among their high points.
I:8690;94;Everyone rightly praises John Belushi's work here, and this is the movie that made him a household name, but to me the standout performance is John Vernon as the Dean, which is one of the great comic portrayals ever.
I:8690;95;however, the most notable aspect may be how vividly and realistically this portrays the college experience for many, especially men.
I:8690;96;The film was released in 1978 and is set in 1962, but its spirit crosses generations.
I:8690;97;It always makes a great gift for a college student and has strong potential to bring various generations together.
I:8690;98;The truth is always valuable, however much we may like to deny it.
I:8690;99;comments, trailer, cast/crew biographies, etc. .
I:8690;100;"It is a hilarious ""Where Are They Now?"""
I:8690;101;The comedy is very much in the spirit of the film, and long.
I:8690;102;time fans will love it.
I:8690;103;It gives much interesting information about the inspiration behind the movie as well as the making of it, reaction to it, and aftereffects, while also managing to be frequently entertaining.
I:8690;104;This lets those who have long loved the film appreciate it anew, while those who still have not seen it have even less excuse than ever for continuing to wait.
I:8690;105;ANIMAL HOUSE is one of the funniest, most subversive comedies ever made!
I:8690;106;obsessed alcoholics (hmmm, actually sounds pretty normal to me) with a knack for causing mayhem.
I:8690;107;type, set only on finding and fulfilling every woman's fantasy.

I:8690;110;"He even has a small part as ""HARDBAR""."
I:8690;111;The end of the movie is characteristic of the endeavors of my own fraternity brothers.
I:8690;112;sixties, I can identify with almost every aspect of this movie.
I:8690;113;This version contained the original movie along with lots of interviews those involved with creating and acting in this classic movie of all times.
I:8690;114;Started the National Lampoon franchise.
I:8690;115;Many in the cast went in to star careers.
I:8690;116;lots of funny stuff in this film, some not so funny stuff as well.
I:8690;117;The best moments clearly belong to the late John Belushi in his signature role as John 'Bluto' Blutarsky.
I:8690;118;national Lampoon took a big risk in producing this taboo breaking movie and it was the success of 'Animal House' that opened the doors to the flood of teen coming of age films to follow.
I:8690;119;Brought into the fold, they witness the true diversity of characters they are now brothers with.
I:8690;120;"things go well for the men of Delta House until Dean Wormer calls them into his office and places them on ""Double Secret Probation""."
I:8690;121;The timeless humor of this film makes it no wonder that it has ascended to cult classic status.
I:8690;122;An original and witty comedy wielding a trailblazing influence on teen/college comedies, Animal House has earned its place in the hallowed halls of American cinematic classics.
I:8690;123;Classic comedy about frats and I believe the first.
I:8690;124;This has got to be the most.
I:8690;125;cLASSIC,sure that's what i expect from a movie like this and i do enjoy the genre,but the cookie.
I:8690;126;Though a little raunchy at times, I loved this movie.
I:8690;127;There are probably a handful of great films about American youth.
I:8690;128;"American Graffiti, ""Animal House"", ""Fast Time at Ridgemount High"" and ""Dazed and Confused"" to name a few, not counting John Hughes' movies."
I:8690;129;this was National Lampoon's first movie and it remains its best.
I:8690;130;"It has all the right ingredients, a great script (with improvisations), a great director John Landis, a great cast, including the immortal John Belushi, hilarious set pieces(now simmer down a bit), shocking subject matters at the time(expletives, sex and drugs) and the ""Goodbye Mr. Chips!"""
I:8690;131;if you are from that period(70's), it remains a comedy classic.
I:8690;132;One of the classic comedies of modern times.
I:8690;133;Hysterically funny and completely inappropriate for children.
I:8690;134;the movie speaks for itself.
I:8690;135;It is excellent in all respects, and simply makes you laugh, no matter how many times you see it.
I:8690;136;This is the original movie and it's still hilarious!
I:8690;137;This was and still is a great movie to watch.
I:8690;138;This is a true classic comedy.
I:8690;139;I think it's the best of the Nat.
I:8690;140;Listed as a source as the cult classic in movie history.
I:8690;141;this is a great roll by Belushi who does great here plus it is just crazy wild parties all the way through out.
I:8690;142;great experienc and plus there being know point at all in the movie was good this is a entertaining and fun movie for every oneStory 5 Acting 10 Direction 10 Action 10 Entertainment 10Overall 45/50 this is 90% But definantly gets 5 stars
I:8690;143;Well, that's just how I feel.
I:8690;144;One bright spot was John Belushi's performance, but even that one was muddled.
I:8690;145;A classic movie about collage guys who party and check outs girls, doing some crazy crap.
I:8690;146;I love this, a must have movie.
I:8690;147;in loving memory of comedian John Belushi, who delivers a funny role in this movie
I:8690;148;Thanks to those who do this.
I:8690;149;Brought back memories of my good friends and school.
I:8690;150;Definitely a classic that I will enjoy watching over and over again!
I:8690;151;Ha Still funny all these years later.
I:8690;152;This is good old humor and worth the time to see it.
I:8690;153;This is an all time classic movie.
I:8690;154;One of those movies that you can judge other peoples character by.
I:8690;155;I was hoping to share it with my wife.
I:8690;156;A true comedy classic, one of the ten funniest films ever made.
I:8690;157;Lastly, even though you know what is coming, and often the very lines the actors are going to say, the gags are still funny!
I:8690;158;My stepson had never seen this and I thought it would be a great Christmas stocking stuffer.
I:8690;159;Yes, they removed all the original, and classic, music from the film.
I:8690;160;This was always a madcap comedy, but it is also a sweet and touching film.
I:8690;161;The characters are such great fun and it is still sad to see John Belushi at the height of his comedy powers when he was just making his big break.
I:8690;162;Best movie ever made perfect cast, perfect writing, perfect story line, watch this movie all the time, love it !!!!!!!
I:8690;163;This is a classic that no one can afford to miss out on.
I:8690;164;see Belushi at his best.
I:8690;165;The film has well known actors and those who play good support roles.
I:8690;166;it's a superb film for Tim Matheson.
I:8690;167;He's got a great role as do others who fit in excellently with the dialogue and scenes.
I:8690;168;exactly what you should watch when you need a good laugh.
I:8690;169;John Belushi is the best.
I:8690;170;time favorite from his high.
I:8690;171;school days and he and his best friend still quote it regualarly.
I:8690;172;This movie makes me laugh every time.
I:8690;173;It came in great packageing.
I:8690;174;thanks for a great movie.
I:8690;175;Some of the best goofy character acting I've ever seen.
I:8690;176;I can see this one again and again and still laugh like it's the first time i've seen it.
I:8690;177;One of the funniest movies I've ever seen.
I:8690;178;Every couple years you have to watch it again.
I:8690;179;James Belushi is at the top of his game in this wonderful film.
I:8690;180;John Belushi was such a massive comic force that you laughed hysterically at the turn of one of his eyebrows.
I:8690;181;The film is graced with an excellent young cast (Tim Mattheson, Peter Riegert, Karen Allen, Tom Hulce, Stephen Furst) but it's Belushi that elevates this film to comic nirvana.
I:8690;182;"The humor holds up remarkably well today, rather, some of it seems a little innocent in light of what the Farrelly brothers and the ""American Pie"" creators have brought to the screen."
I:8690;183;Enjoy the innocent fratboy humor of this film and take it for what it is.
I:8690;184;This movie is one the funniest movies of all time.
I:8690;185;John Belushi is still and will always be one of the funniest men of all time!
I:8690;186;This is a comedic classic with great acting from a number of well known actors of the future.
I:8690;187;After finally seeing Animal House in its entirety for the first time, I now realize the cultural impact it's had in the 25+ years since its theatrical release.
I:8690;188;Usually, the film that does it first, does it best, and I think that's the case with Animal House .
I:8690;189;By now, had he lived, Belushi would probably have graduated into more dramatic roles, like his Saturday Night Live counterpart, Bill Murray.
I:8690;190;Still, Animal House remains an enjoyable film that will, no doubt, continue to be a source from which other college.
I:8690;191;Released in 1978, this film remains one of the funniest movies ever produced.
I:8690;192;It rivals the comedy of Mel Brooks.
I:8690;193;John Bluto Blutarsky played by John Belushi is a member of the Delta House fraternity.
I:8690;194;This is a must see movie for anyone who experienced fraternity life especially in the late 60's or early 70's.
I:8690;195;The sound track is an excellent vehicle to return the viewer to times gone by.
I:8690;196;Practically everyone's top pick for comedys.
I:8690;197;so if you want a blast to the past to recapture the magic moments of some great actors and actresses then this is one of them.
I:8690;198;John where ever you are now, Thanks for the laughs!
I:8690;199;"This classic slob comedy, which was on par with the slightly more refined nostalgia piece, ""Grease"" in the summer of '78 , gives a frank look at fraternity life."
I:8690;200;There is a certain irony to the fact that the rowdy members of the Delta fraterinity become Society's leaders and the more straight.
I:8690;201;They arrive first at the stately Omega House, where well.
I:8690;202;But after a friendly chat with Katie(Karen Allen), Larry Kroger makes up his mind to become a Delta and legacy Kent Dorffman follows suit.
I:8690;203;Kevin Bacon makes and early appearance as a new member of the Omegas.
I:8690;204;But it is rather amusing to see how later in life, some of the Deltas would channel their energies and libidos into more constructive professions.
I:8690;205;This film is a classic.
I:8690;206;Great actors of today were in the film!
I:8690;207;The video transfer is extremely good.
I:8690;208;"It is a very clean print
I:8690;209;While this is not Dobly 5.1, it does an adequate job.
I:8690;210;"I give this movie as a ""welcome to college"" gift for all my nieces and nephews in the 2nd semester of their freshman year."
I:8690;211;It's the kind of movie you can watch once or twice a year and still enjoy.
I:8690;212;it's timeless in it's validity.
I:8690;213;If you take the time to learn more about the movie's cast and the filming the more you can appreciate the 1st of it's kind in this genre.
I:8690;214;Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be brief.
I:8690;215;She laughed as hard as I did the first time I saw it.
I:8690;216;But it's more than a funny film.
I:8690;217;There are a lot of funny films out there.
I:8690;218;"What makes ""Animal House"" special is its slightly overdrawn but mostly accurate portrayal of college life."
I:8690;219;As someone who spent four years in college, an additional four years in grad school, and nearly three decades teaching at the college level, I resonate fully with the men of the Delta fraternity, who wind up getting the best of the self.
I:8690;220;"important few), I have rooted for the underdogs to stick it to ""The Man."""
I:8690;221;And this is exactly what the Delta house does in a way both hilarious and fitting.
I:8690;222;"the fact that this film has engendered knockoffs such as ""Road Trip"" and ""Old School"" is testimony to its landmark status and its enduring value."
I:8690;223;this hits the nail on the head.
I:8690;224;I've been a fan of this movie since its theatrical release in 1978 and give the movie five stars.
I:8690;225;Like a fine wine, it was worth waiting for.
I:8690;226;This is one of the pioneering movies of the party movie genre.
I:8690;227;If you watch pretty much ANY party movie today, you will readily see the influence of AH.
I:8690;228;If any of the above offends you, you most assuredly will do best to skip over this flick.
I:8690;229;For the sake of nostalgia alone this film is worth a look.
I:8690;230;Just remember: it's OK to visit Animal House every so often .
I:8690;231;see this movie if you're a Belushi fan.
I:8690;232;it's gross, wicked, funny, touching and just a smart comedy that goes to show you what college life is hopefully not like now a days.
I:8690;233;So far as I can tell, the music on the Blu.
I:8690;234;a handful of laughs, along with faternity style pranks and college binge drinking atmosphere filled me up with enough laughs for the rest of the real.
I:8690;235;this movie was also in great condition.
I:8690;236;This was a great movie.
I:8690;237;Out of all people, my MOTHER!
I:8690;238;When I first saw this movie I thought it was a blast and every time I see it gets better.
I:8690;239;Maybe it's because we live in the age of 'American Pie' movies and Hollywood has raised the bar for this kind of humor.
I:8690;240;I found very little humor here.
I:8690;241;the only thing that saves this from being a complete turd is some good acting.
I:8690;242;everything a good movie should have you will find inside Animal House, which I condiser one of the best movies of 1978, even though I wasn't born until 3 years later.
I:8690;243;Great moveI got one for a good friend he was telling me about how much he love movies.
I:8690;244;Universal has done about as well as could be expected with this classic.
I:8690;245;All in all this is a wonderful presentation.
I:8690;246;I don't truly recommend all the bonus material, but the movie is great.
I:8690;247;This is a good movie to go back in time and watch it every few years.
I:8690;248;A 1970's classic that spawned Toga parties across the world.
I:8690;249;Highly recommended and watch out, you may find yourself attending a Toga party.
I:8690;250;Everyone should watch this movie every once in a while.
I:8690;251;this film is basically a (actually) good.
I:8690;252;accurate nostalgia look at life just before Vietnam changed America.
I:8690;253;age actors give it the old college try, but the result is about as vibrant as a long.
I:8690;254;The new disc's images range from OK to quite good, while the audio, upgraded from mono to Dolby 5.1, adds punch to the comedy and grace to Elmer Bernstein's straight.
I:8690;255;When I came back from Vietnam I headed to college.
I:8690;256;I've watched this movie many times enjoying the antics of these fellows.
I:8690;257;Amazing the stunts you could get away with back then.
I:8690;258;had a great time watching it over the holidays.
I:8690;259;special edition has great additions.
I:8690;260;"if you like your comedies in the ""Police Academy"" and its many sequels ilk then this one will amuse you no end and ranks among the best ever of the National Lampoon franchise."
I:8690;261;is amusing as well although not quite as good as the main course humour.
I:8690;262;"wise and ""The Yearbook: An Animal House Reunion"" is also a very nice touch."
I:8690;263;Never will tire of this movie and great lines
I:8690;264;Still the ultimate party flick, this edition delivers to the fans.
I:8690;265;Relive the pranks, the wild celebrations, and the late, great John Belushi.
I:8690;266;This movie is a fantastic description of that situation, and an exciting example of some sort of alternative social circle.
I:8690;267;As I watched the movie, I often found myself impressed by the unity of the group, although there aren't so clearly divided social circles in Kitee's Lukio (senior high), or if there is, at least it ain't so hostile as bac there.
I:8690;268;Every person in the movie is a person we have known .
I:8690;269;send the kids to grandmama's, draw the shades and turn up the volume, invite a few close friends over and enjoy.
I:8690;270;All college movies begin and end with a little film called National Lampoon's Animal House.
I:8690;271;A foray into movies for the first time for National Lampoon, having succeeded on radio and as a magazine, this raucous classic has everything you'd want in a comedy: memorable characters and quotes, partying, a great soundtrack, and a group of unknowns that became stars overnight.
I:8690;272;saying Animal House always brings to mind John Belushi as Bluto Blutarsky, the 7.
I:8690;273;"Bluto is the best character hands down, and his speech to get the Deltas back up when they're down is classic, yelling, ""Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?"
I:8690;274;See it now, then watch it again.
I:8690;275;I really love the ending where they tell what each of the charactor's went on to become.
I:8690;276;This movie is definitely a classic, and 27 years later, still an original.
I:8690;277;anyway, this is a cult classic.
I:8690;278;Even though many of the party scenes are somewhat exaggerated, Animal House succeeds at painting an accurate comedic portrait of fraternity life on college campuses in the 1960's.
I:8690;279;Definitely try this one out one night when you need something to make you feel good and yearn back to your younger days.
I:8690;280;This film pokes fun at good old fashioned American College campus antics.
I:8690;281;Tim Matheson is a standout and his career has never got the recognition it deserved.
I:8690;282;Matheson's cool aplomb really makes this film work along with Elmer Bernstein's score doing a somewhat self parody especially on his own swashbuckling THE BUCCANEER score with John Belush's antics during the parade.
I:8690;283;It may gross out some folks,but great characters, led by Belushi in his prime, with campus anticsanchoring whole movie.
I:8690;284;Good to own because it's still hilarious after all these years and stands up to repeated viewings.3.
I:8690;285;Along with Stripes and Caddyshack, it's one of the most quotable comedies of all time.
I:8690;286;[Other fans will happily play along and non.
I:8690;287;Thisis one of the funniest films, Belushi and the rest of the cast are greatand the late, Elmer Bernstein's score is also great.
I:8690;288;This movie is a timeless hit that can be viewed over and over again.
I:8690;289;The movies actors are hilarious.
I:8690;290;The comedy may be somewhat twisted but it is still hilarious.
I:8690;291;National Lampoon's Animal House is one of the most popular movies in the history of comedy.
I:8690;292;This double secret probation edition just rocks I love all of the bonus material.
I:8690;293;This entire movie based on the 1960s college partying life is real funny.
I:8690;294;This obscene, ludicrous, piece of fine entertainment!
I:8690;295;The soundtrack is great (unimaginably, Elmer Bernstein and Otis Day and the Knights) and I loved the special features.
I:8690;296;"I've seen several of National Lampoon's great comedy films, but nothing tops ""Animal House"", which I find a great classic."
I:8690;297;The cafeteria scene was probably the best, ending with the food fight.
I:8690;298;When the cast and crew arrived, they found it quite an experience.
I:8690;299;"this is a great classic, especially for avid John Belushi fans who had known him since the premiere of ""Saturday Night Live""."
I:8690;300;Great movie, too bad the greedy suits got their way.
I:8690;301;If this industry wishes to receive any more of MY MONEY, they will have to start treating me as if I am an individual with the right to choose how I watch movies and when.
I:8690;302;Animal House and the Blues Brothers are the best Landis/Belushi movies of all time.
I:8690;303;"There are some special features such as a ""Where are they now"" featurette featuring many of the original cast (except Belushi of course)."
I:8690;304;Your best bet is to go make some popcorn and come back.
I:8690;305;At that point, it should be done and then you can enjoy this excellent, funny parody of life in a frat house in the late 60s.
I:8690;306;Animal House is a very funny movie and one of the best comedy movies ever made in movie history.
I:8690;307;I agree with many people when you need a good or great laugh then watch this movie and enjoy yourself over and over again with everything it has to offer the fans of the movie.
I:8690;308;But I still give it 4 stars because of the number of laughs I have everytime I watch it and I have watched it mutiple times over the years since I first bought it.
I:8690;309;I like this movie because It had people rebeling against the college and that I loved.
I:8690;310;This was the funniest film I ever saw.
I:8690;311;I still laugh every time I see it.
I:8690;312;When a film that is over 20 years old can make you laugh when you still watch it then you have a classic.
I:8690;313;June 1, 1978 was the date Universal Studios released a huge hit, National Lampoon's Animal House.
I:8690;314;There are several actors and actresses that starred in this film, familiar faces and up and coming stars.
I:8690;315;animal House is based on the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity at Dartmouth.
I:8690;316;Animal House does not require much thought and analysis to watch and understand, but it is as entertaining as they get!
I:8690;317;C'mon, a decent Audio Commentary, an easter egg or two, and for God's sake, get your advertising across some other way without those *$!
I:8690;318;The comedy of a generation takes place at Faber College during the Kennedy era.
I:8690;319;The assortment of misfits is recognizable.
I:8690;320;"Neidermeyer is the gung ho ROTC officer: ""Drop and give me 20!"""
I:8690;321;"Even the statue of the college founder is funny: ""Knowledge is good."""
I:8690;322;This is one of the greatest movies of all time!
I:8690;323;It was much funnier when I was in my 30's.
I:8690;324;This movie is pretty funny.
I:8690;325;Yes I think its mean spitited humor to see someone bully the weak but everything else in this movie is super keen funny.
I:8690;326;Most of your great movies are also famous here as most French people love American movies.
I:8690;327;I thought I should give it a try.
I:8690;328;time favorite movies and they're gonna re.
I:8690;329;It comes highly recommended by me.
I:8690;330;So therefore, it must be good.
I:8690;331;With a cast like this, it was bound to be a classic and will remain that way for years to come.
I:8690;332;From Belushi's crazy character Ox to Otis Day The Knights at the all Black club they all walk into, truly hilarious!
I:8690;333;Great to enjoy this movie again, and again, reminds me of my college days!
I:8690;334;A wonderful addition to my collection.
I:8690;335;This seems to belie the spirit of social anarchy the film elsewhere so happily and rudely celebrates.
I:8690;336;The likable and funny two actors who begin the film, Tom Hulce and Steven Furst, as Pinto and Flounder, skate right past this uncomfortableness, as does the wonderful comic actress Martha Smith as a Southern.
I:8690;337;belle co. ed (she has some of the film's funniest moments).
I:8690;338;One of my favorite movies of all time, if not my favorite.
I:8690;339;I bought this movie for my grandson who is pledging a fraternity He and the other pledges loved it.
I:8690;340;I bought it for him because I saw it many years ago and know what a great movie it is.
I:8690;341;She is very involved with her sorority but has never seen this movie.
I:8690;342;While Belushi gets a lot of attention for several scenes, there are many others who make this movie an enduring laugh.
I:8690;343;Classic comedy, brings back many memories.
I:8690;344;Not exactly my experience, but a great parady of college life.
I:8690;345;i laughed so hard i thought i was going to wet my pants.
I:8690;346;Loved it then, love it now.
I:8690;347;This movie is a timeless comedy.
I:8690;348;Animal House is perhaps the greatest American comedy ever filmed.
I:8690;349;John Belushi literally takes over this movie and proves beyond a doubt his genius.
I:8690;350;He has some hilarious dialogue, but his silent scenes are amazing.
I:8690;351;"Belushi had one of the most expressive faces in film
I:8690;352;His death, in 1982, robbed us of a uniquely charismatic actor/comedian.
I:8690;353;belushi plays Bluto, one of the seedier members of Faber College's degenerate, fun.
I:8690;354;out movies, it does so with genuine wit.
I:8690;355;Patriotism, honesty, sobriety, chastity, the American Way, race relations, conservatism, liberalism, intelligence, stupidity.
I:8690;356;well and serves it up on a poppyseed bun with an order of fries.
I:8690;357;"the ""Special Edition"" includes a sweet widescreen print of the film (a little dark in places, though), biographies/filmographies of the actors and a fun featurette, ""Animal House Reunion,"" which features many of the original stars as they reminisce about making the movie."
I:8690;358;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:8690;359;I'm very happy about this being Blu.
I:8690;360;A perfect blend of this, my all.
I:8690;361;out humor, slapstick yucks, and all.
I:8690;362;"But it's Belushi's gonzo portrayal of Bluto that remains iconic, and helped make the former ""SNL"" cast member a bigtime comic star."
I:8690;363;I find the Blues Brothers, made in the same time frame more enjoyable.
I:8690;364;The blame for the disaffection probably rests in the numerous spoofs, various homages, and references in other popular culture offerings to Animal House that have appeared over the years.
I:8690;365;When the original is viewed with the heightened expectations it somehow pales a bit.
I:8690;366;Belushi's rousing speech at the end is masterful though.
I:8690;367;I feel apreciated that I actually got to visit his gravesite on Martha's Vineyard.
I:8690;368;A classic film like this one deserves so much better.
I:8690;369;This movie is a classic and anyone who is, was, or wants to be in college needs to see this movie.
I:8690;370;This movie is a classic funny movie.
I:8690;371;Just Belushi's antics in this movie make it worth watching.
I:8690;372;Watch it, or you'll have to drop and give me 20!
I:8690;373;John Belushi is my favorite actor and since he has very few movies since his death I really enjoy him in this one.
I:8690;374;I am not a frat boy but I love the genre of this movie.
I:8690;375;John Belushi saying Toga Toga always brings a tear to my eye.
I:8690;376;This is one of the greatest, if not the best, college movie ever made!
I:8690;377;A must for any incomming freshman orientation!
I:8690;378;National Lampoon's Animal House, Right off the bat this is National Lampoon's Best Movie.
I:8690;379;This is the Best Frat/College Movie there is.
I:8690;380;john Belushi As Bluto is Hilarious and my favorite character.
I:8690;381;The Scene with the Horse and the new pledge is very funny.
I:8690;382;Amazing movie with a spectacular cast.
I:8690;383;Reminds me of some of my college friends and times only more fun.
I:8690;384;One of the movies I saw and loved as a kid but have really only seen a few times.
I:8690;385;So I loved it and although I know a lot of the lines I can't recite the whe movie.
I:8690;386;Still laughed at some of the scenes, but maybe time has mellowed me.
I:8690;387;One of the funniest movies ever!
I:8690;388;now itt's my grandkids' tiurn!
I:8690;389;and was a great xmas gift for my niece, she loved it (and John Belushi!)
I:8690;390;'Animal House' is by far the best movie to come out of the world of National Lampoon.
I:8690;391;This movie is hilarious in all its raunchy humor.
I:8690;392;By far, the best American comedy ever made!Faber College 1962: a time when you were either for the system or against it.
I:8690;393;For the fraternity brothers of Delta Tau Chi, rebellion was a way of life.
I:8690;394;i absolutely love this film.
I:8690;395;I'm a huge fan of the late great John Belushi so the first time I saw it, I knew right then that it'd be very enjoyable.
I:8690;396;Even though he doesn't have very many scenes, I'm sure others will agree that he steals the show and delivers the performance that has immortalized him.
I:8690;397;the rest of the cast that includes Tim Matheson, Bruce McGill, Peter Reigert,Donald Sutherland, Thomas Hulce and Stephen Furst,just to name a few,bring to life the wacky characters America will never forget!I highly recommend this movie!
I:8690;398;National Lampoon's Animal House was released in 1978 by universal studios.
I:8690;399;In 1979 this film won the peoples choice award for favorite non.
I:8690;400;summary: John Belushi and cast are great.
I:8690;401;Add a great road trip, a some fun at the town parade and you have a great movie.
I:8690;402;I especially enjoyed the biography disc because my yearbook photo is in it.
I:8690;403;watching it now I'm kind of surprised at the language from a movie made in 1978.
I:8690;404;Animal House is problably one of the funniest comedies ever made!!!
I:8690;405;this movie will be great for many years to come!
I:8690;406;This is defenitly a college classic, still popular today.
I:8690;407;Even though I'm only in my 20's this movie still is hillarious to my generation.
I:8690;408;A must for any college student who enjoys a good party!
I:8690;409;This movie is one of the best National Lampoons movies that they ever made!
I:8690;410;Everyone should watch it at least one time in their life!
I:8690;411;Bizarre and over the top, Animal House is a hilarious portrayal of losers at an 1960s college, joining a frat and seeking revenge against the administration.
I:8690;412;I have to make the requirement so i came up with this sentence.
I:8690;413;This is one of the late John Belushi's best films despite other than The Blues Brothers, that those films are timeless comedy classics and will guanteed to kepp you laughing!
I:8690;414;This is one of those films I watch about once a year and I laugh every time.
I:8690;415;I've seen this at least a dozen times, but it is just as funny as it was the first time I watched it.
I:8690;416;Made for a fun family movie night.
I:8690;417;He was very happy to get it and has watched it many times already.
I:8690;418;This will always be a classic in our house.
I:8690;419;the shipping was on time and in perfect condition.
I:8690;420;This film is one of the films I like most.
I:8690;421;I just love the Rock and Roll era, although I was born in the 70's.
I:8690;422;And Animal House has the smell of that era.
I:8690;423;This classic both confuses and saddens me.
I:8690;424;There are plenty of ways to view a schooling system that works, namely Dead Poets Society .
I:8690;425;Gift to my son for him and the rugby house, they seemed to enjoy it and now have it in there collection.
I:8690;426;This is a hilarious look into college and greek life.
I:8690;427;It is appropriate for older teens and adults.
I:8690;428;what I like best about it is that it reminds me of the 70s.
I:8690;429;It reminds me of the hippie generation that I am a part of.
I:8690;430;john Belushi's character is still great to watch.
I:8690;431;He has a wonderful, gentle, absurd sense of humor.
I:8690;432;He is the diamond in this cast.
I:8690;433;The rest of the performers here are dwarfed by his talent.
I:8690;434;We see later that the white girls are fine, and weren't attacked.
I:8690;435;And the John Belushi character has a Jewish sounding name, Blutarsky with a y. i also like two of the women in the movie.
I:8690;436;They are both a lot of fun to watch.
I:8690;437;Great and funny movie about college students and the frats they belonged to.
I:8690;438;The old school music is really good and you hearOtis Day singing two of his hits from that time.
I:8690;439;It is the National Lampoon's classic!
I:8690;440;This has been one of our favorite movies for years!
I:8690;441;time comedy classics, Animal House is always a great watch.
I:8690;442;The clarity of the color, sound and overall presentation of this particular version is much better than the older copy I had.
I:8690;443;He controls the movie while saying less than 200 words.
I:8690;444;While film goers today hail Something about Mary, Wedding Crashers, Happy gilmore and the like one need to remember the lunacy of the comedic, frat house farce.
I:8690;445;One of the greatest movies ever made.
I:8690;446;One of my favorite movies!
I:8690;447;Nostalgic and funny no matter how many times you view.
I:8690;448;There's a great documentary about the making of that's on the second disc that's pretty cool.
I:8690;449;Always good to hear about the trials and tribulations of making a PHENOMINAL movie that we sometimes don't consider how hard it can be to get all the ducks in a row so to speak.
I:8690;450;And to see inside some super creative minds without whom this wouldn't come close to the greatness it has.
I:8690;451;For me the greatest comedy ever but also just a great movie with an outstanding cast.
I:8690;452;For me it's just as funny and fresh today as it was the first time I saw it all those years ago.
I:8690;453;And so much of this movie was done spur of the moment, including Bluto smashing a beer can on his forehead, and Daniel Simpson 'd.
I:8690;454;For those of us that remember the Golden Age of political and social satire .
I:8690;455;this movie a complete joy.
I:8690;456;For these guys, a moon shot from a passing car can be funny, having to watch the same moon for the next thirty.
I:8690;457;Go back and read the brilliant work of Chris Miller, Doug Kenney, and Michael O'Donoghue from Nat Lamp from 1968.1979.
I:8690;458;With failing grades, lude public acts, and more alcohol than they know what to do with the fraternity brothers face a court hearing and a potential revoking of their charter.
I:8690;459;i give this comedy two stars.
I:8690;460;a classic, I am glad I bought it.
I:8690;461;It is also the funniest modern college comedy out there.
I:8690;462;Belushi steals the show and his level of physical comedy in this movie shows him at his best and funniest.
I:8690;463;He's great in all of the sence.
I:8690;464;A premium blast from the past.
I:8690;465;Wonderful innovative gags which keep you laughing.
I:8690;466;Just the movie, features, etc.
I:8690;467;The movie was also a very young Kevin Bacon's first screen role, and it played host to an ensemble of actors and actresses.
I:8690;468;This one is well done, developed, and executed.
I:8690;469;"In 1978, John Landis directed what is probably one of his best and most hilarious films, ""Animal House""."
I:8690;470;The film focuses on fraternity and sorority life in a small college town in the 1960's.
I:8690;471;In other words, they have a blast!
I:8690;472;"after 25 years, ""Animal House"" is just as entertaining as it was when it was first released in 1978."
I:8690;473;It has become a classic film that will never be dated.
I:8690;474;It also became a stunning tribute to John Belushi's (1949.1982) fantastic comedic abilities.
I:8690;475;"Overall, I give ""Animal House"" an overwhelming 5 out of 5 stars for a great script, superb comedic acting and an engaging story that will keep you laughing throughout the film."
I:8690;476;a funny as they come and probably the best Lampoon next to Vaction and Loaded Weapon 1.
I:8690;477;John Belushi, you gotta love his character and my favorite moment of his is when hes spying on the sorority girls, funny as hell.
I:8690;478;love being able to find my old favourites all in one place @ Amazon.
I:8690;479;This has to go down as one of the funniest movies ever.
I:8690;480;I saw this movie recently after repeatedly being told it is the funniest movie ever created.
I:8690;481;They are far superior to Animal House.
I:8690;482;I was more than satisfied, but thankful!
I:8690;483;John Belushi was a very funny guy.
I:8690;484;john Landis is great when it comes to Comedy.
I:8690;485;it is a celebration of a movie and the actors that made a great movie that has lasted through time and celebrate a great movie
I:8690;486;Animal House is the funniest movie ever made, period!
I:8690;487;Animal House has the funniest stuff, and when you least expect it, a car always runs into something!!!
I:8690;488;This movie proves that this is the case.
I:8690;489;and yet we keep at it every weekend.
I:8690;490;lets move on to something else.
I:8690;491;A pure classic a must watch for any college student or any person looking for a good laugh.
I:8690;492;release for a great movie.
I:8690;493;Possibly the funniest movie of all time.
I:8690;494;Tons of catch phrases ( They took the bar!
I:8690;495;I can watch this movie a zillion times and still laugh (and probably will before I'm through . . . )!
I:8690;496;Next day, I was like: sure let's watch Animal House yeah!
I:8690;497;Television stations usually gut this film of some of the best gags, dialog, and of course, nudity.
I:8690;498;this version with THX remastering is really sharp and crisp.
I:8690;499;i love this film for the same reason that that I love Grease , namely, everyone seems to be having so much more fun getting their third.
I:8690;500;rate public education than I got getting my third rate public education.
I:8690;501;One of the funniest movies ever.
I:8690;502;John Belushi gives an excellent performance.
I:8690;503;I have really enjoyed this movie over the years, from the intial release through all the rebroadcasts on TV.
I:8690;504;I'm happy to have this in my collection.
I:8690;505;Animal House it a very funny movie but this edition is terrible.
I:8690;506;Also the lyrics to Louie Louie are still as mysterious as they ever were.
I:8690;507;Two years ago I saw Otis Day and his band perform the same songs in Clearwater.
I:8690;508;My kids are both in college and in the Greek system, but yet they've never seen this classic.
I:8690;509;I got it for them for Christmas and they both thought it was hilarious!
I:8690;510;Animal House is the best movie of all time.
I:8690;511;gift Set version, so I can't say if it has ads or not, but it may be worth the extra 10 bucks or so to get an ad.
I:8690;512;One of the best movies ever made!!!!
I:8690;513;That is all I have to say.
I:8690;514;This movie is a great comedy classic!!!!!!!!
I:8690;515;Everything about this movie is great from the acting, music, and settings just make this movie a masterpiece for comedy.
I:8690;516;If you want a great laugh get this movie.
I:8690;517;It was funny when it was first released and I still laugh out loud every time I watch it.
I:8690;518;I should have bought this years ago.
I:8690;519;Animal House is definitely a classic, although I agree with those who've commented that it hasn't spawned anything particularly positive.
I:8690;520;Still, the movie on it's own terms is a riot, and I'd rate it about four and a half stars.
I:8690;521;the trivia pop ups are quite fun but not really breathtaking and I doubt you'll use this facility more than once.
I:8690;522;umentary is fun and the only real new extra on the disc.
I:8690;523;Just in time for its 25th Anniversary as well!
I:8690;524;Where to begin well, I think that this film has to be one of the funniest films about college fraternity life I have ever scene.
I:8690;525;John Belushi is at his comedic best in this film, and the soundtrack to the film is spectacular.
I:8690;526;Sure this movie is a little outdated, but trust me, you will love this film.
I:8690;527;His turn as John Bluto Blutarsky showed all the physical comedic gifts that he possessed.
I:8690;528;What the movie does have is classic lowbrow humor in the form of food fights, sexual situations and the like.
I:8690;529;Tim Matheson is excellent as the womanizing Otter, Peter Riegert and Karen Allen are good as the on and off couple Boon Katie, Stephen Furst is perfect as the bumbling Flounder, Mark Metcalf adds the right amount of slime and is absolutely hateable as Neidermayer, John Vernon is imposing as Dean Wormer and Tom Hulce brings the perfect amount nativity to Pinto.
I:8690;530;success and spawned many imitators, none of which could capture Animal House's humor and charm.
I:8690;531;This is one of those clasic movies that belongs in everyone's library.
I:8690;532;extra feature segments are long winded and un funny.
I:8690;533;The making of feature is really good though.
I:8690;534;This movie,to me, is in the easy top 5 best movie comedy's of all time.
I:8690;535;Give it a look, you will laugh your bottom off!
I:8690;536;National Lampoon's Animal House was released in color in 1978.
I:8690;537;this movie is full of lowbrow humor as the Delta House works against the `normal clean.
I:8690;538;Some of the scenes in this movie are so hard to believe, but are so funny.
I:8690;539;The end of this movie puts a good cap on things and ties everything together.
I:8690;540;Animal House is a movie for the college student at heart.
I:8690;541;In my opinion, the funniest movie ever made.
I:8690;542;John Belushi is absolutely hysterical, particularly as he makes his way through the cafeteria.
I:8690;543;Serious films like The Godfather directed by Coppola or Taxi Driver by Scorcese, which both appeared in the 70's brought the French New Wave and Post.
I:8690;544;bob Hope, Doris Day, and Sandra Dee dominated the 60's with light comedy, breezy shtick, and virginated sex comedy.
I:8690;545;With a simmering middle class producing college bound kids in baby boom numbers, the youth culture looked for their own laugh statement.2nd City, National Lampoon, and Saturday Night Live writers and performers finally got the Hollywood green light, so naturally, with pent up baby boomer instinct, they produced the most influential comedy of the last twenty.
I:8690;546;The nubile young girls truly show their stuff.
I:8690;547;My generation will always love a spirited laugher about the old days when we did some pretty risky stuff.
I:8690;548;Dean Wormer wants Delta House off of his campus and he asks Omega House (the rich boys) to help him accomplish this task.
I:8690;549;This is where the fun begins.
I:8690;550;class guys inhabit Delta house and they live for pulling pranks on the Omega House fraternity and Dean Wormer.
I:8690;551;this movie truly portrays college life on campuses during the 1970's.
I:8690;552;The pledge class consists of all the rejects from Omega House not only from this year but year's past.
I:8690;553;The lunchroom scene with Bluto is classic.
I:8690;554;lucky love interests including Dean Wormer's life are characteristic of a young man's college sexual escapades of the 70's.
I:8690;555;The closing of the Delta House and the road trip are comical.
I:8690;556;And finally the parade of all parades allows Delta House to get their revenge.
I:8690;557;Keep smiling as you relive quotes and replay scenes in your mind years after viewing this very funny film!
I:8690;558;An extremely funny slapstick comedy.
I:8690;559;This is a classic that even today, 35 years after its release, still attracts and amuses new viewers.
I:8690;560;When the comedy appeared here, it was new, something entirely original.
I:8690;561;The shock of these outlandish images inspires laughter, and rightly so.
I:8690;562;This film seems as fresh today as it ever did before.
I:8690;563;Landis makes films with the energy no one else can provide(fine, early Mel Brooks too).
I:8690;564;The actors provide grace to their performances.
I:8690;565;The characters know they're being childish, but they just love it so much.
I:8690;566;He's an event!Moreover the film has an underlying intelligent charm about itself.
I:8690;567;"The motto of Faber College, ""Knowledge is good!"""
I:8690;568;is a paraphrase of every single motto of every single school in the country.
I:8690;569;the movie is smart, not only in its over the top stupidity and clever satire (I'm quite aware that's paradoxical).
I:8690;570;It also knows just how to generate a laugh, which is more than I can say for most comedies.
I:8690;571;The special edition is nice, but nothing spectacular.
I:8690;572;The movie itself is a classic.
I:8690;573;Right up there with Caddyshack for the most funny lines you can quote.
I:8690;574;It is also fun to watch to spot so many great young actors that turned out to be big stars.
I:8690;575;Toga parties might not have been born in this movie, but they became a national sensation in the late 1970's and 80's thanks to Blutarsky and Co.
I:8690;576;and check out Otis Day's band with a young Robert Cray playing the bass guitar.
I:8690;577;yet this comedy still holds up nicely decades later.
I:8690;578;This film relies on sight gags, some gross humor and brilliant comic writing and imagination.
I:8690;579;Animal House will always and forever be one step above Double Secret Probation.
I:8690;580;This movie is a rite of passage, there are many classic one liners in it and the sound track is great, the music reflects the mood and time perfectly.
I:8690;581;If you're looking for good old classic coming of age movies or like the best old comedians then I highly recommend this movie to anybody along with Revenge of the Nerds with Anthony Edwards.
I:8690;582;This is one of the best ever made.
I:8690;583;The card board house is very cool looking and colorfull plus really thick and steardy.
I:8690;584;The yearbook is also a treat w/rare and cool looking photos.
I:8690;585;Also the bonus features rock as well.
I:8690;586;It is remarkable to me how well this film's appeal has held up over the years since its initial release more than 25 years ago.
I:8690;587;(Yes, that's Robert Cray among the members of Otis Day's band.)
I:8690;588;Both examine undergraduate life but that's about all they share in common.
I:8690;589;Those who plan to see Animal House for the first time (or again) are urged to see Good News first.
I:8690;590;The portrayal of life on the Tait College campus in Good News establishes a frame.
I:8690;591;it's still one of my favorite movies.
I:8690;592;This film's genre is a comedy of morals as it definitely uses ridicule to correct abuses aimed at a college fraternity.
I:8690;593;The soundtrack to this movie is awesome for the sounds of the sixties.
I:8690;594;on a scale of one to five stars, this film is a five.
I:8690;595;Animal House is a classic comedy.
I:8690;596;It is just as funny now as it was when it was released 22 years ago.
I:8690;597;It is easy to get wrapped up in cheering for the Delta house good guys.
I:8690;598;It is a fun movie to watch and everyone should have this movie in their home video library.
I:8690;599;ups that footnote the movie.
I:8690;600;The crazed genius of John Belushi explodes with his sustained incarnation of Bluto Blutarsky.
I:8690;601;This is one hilarous movie!
I:8690;602;It is so funny and it's a great movie to watch with your friends while you're relaxing and having a few beers!
I:8690;603;And Animal House didn't just introduce a new style, it perfected it.
I:8690;604;Even if you have never experienced college life (like myself) you will love this movie.
I:8690;605;You'll laugh, laugh, and laugh some more.
I:8690;606;This movie is that good.
I:8690;607;'Ya gotta love Johns' classic line of all time.
I:8690;608;I like National Lampoon's movies in general.
I:8690;609;Just because someone says its a classic doesnt mean you are compelled to laugh, though.
I:8690;610;Loved this movie the first time and each and every time I watch it.
I:8690;611;classic Belushi in what was a hit comedy when it came out.
I:8690;612;The movie is great, its a lot of fun, I got to see boobies and hear the curse words finally after having watched the movie edited to pieces practically every weekend of my teen years on USA or TBS, the humor still holds up and I wish I worked at Faber.
I:8690;613;universal Home Video, Stop doing this, its off.
I:8690;614;But is is brimming with energy and it is funny.
I:8690;615;So forget your upbringing and scruples and enjoy it.
I:8690;616;Animal House is the one movie that is completely lacking taste but is a masterpiece.
I:8690;617;All the acting is laugh out loud hilarous.
I:8690;618;Everything about it is funny.
I:8690;619;The moments it puts you in is unexpected.
I:8690;620;Everytime I watch it I laugh just as much as I did the first time I watched it.
I:8690;621;I highly reccomend this film.
I:8690;622;One of the most funniest movies of all times!
I:8690;623;This film provides a few chuckles, but that is about all.
I:8690;624;It's a classic, and I thought it was hilarious when I was in my teens, but it's a little dated.
I:8690;625;This is such a great movie.
I:8690;626;It has been a favorite of mine for many years.
I:8690;627;A movie you can watch over and over again.
I:8690;628;brings back those college days.
I:8690;629;So it gets only 1 star and I will demand that the store take it back even though I opened it.
I:8690;630;This movie is a classic and great on all levels you wont me board and you laugh from start to finish
I:8690;631;I saw it on the second night it was out when I was 16, and it's as funny now as it was then.
I:8690;632;the bonus material is excellent, especially Dean Wermer hooked up to oxygen by the pool screaming, Blutarsky!!!
I:8690;633;each and every time you use it!
I:8690;634;The movie itself, of course is one of the best.
I:8690;635;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:8690;636;Everyone over the age of 18 should see it at least 10 times!
I:8690;637;The movie sported the greatest cinematic finale of all.
I:8690;638;time, each of its scenes have countless moments of comic inspiration and suprise, and it is probably the most quotable and hilarious movie made in the last quarter of the last hundred years.
I:8690;639;this was Belushi at his best with a bravura performance reminiscent of great comics before him like Chaplin, Marx Brothers, etc., and he did it with aplomb.
I:8690;640;Otter was the quintessential smooth talker, always working an angle on everybody, especially the ladies.
I:8690;641;some of it is actually quite suave.
I:8690;642;The screenwriters and director John Landis did a great job evoking Kennedy.
I:8690;643;era America and they found a lot to laugh at.
I:8690;644;an unqualified classic by the simplest definition .
I:8690;645;it makes you laugh, long and loud .
I:8690;646;this is easily a required addition to your collections.
I:8690;647;And it holds up its own to repeat viewing.
I:8690;648;National Lampoon's Animal House is a classic that had a significant effect on TV and movie comedies long after its introduction in 1978.
I:8690;649;We enjoy watching it for the content and for being able to recognize every location in it.
I:8690;650;Is so good it should be some kind of required viewing experience for us growing up , who hasn't seen it and who doesn't love it ?
I:8690;651;This is a classic movie from the late '70s.
I:8690;652;I was in high school when this came out and thought it was hilarious .
I:8690;653;I loved Otter's classic Corvette .
I:8690;654;It was that influential to me.
I:8690;655;This 1978 film by John Landis follows the wild adventures of a group of fraternities on the campus of Faber College.
I:8690;656;Delta House was comprised of fun.
I:8690;657;Dean Wormer finally won the battle and kicked Delta House off the campus, but Delta House's revenge was awesome.
I:8690;658;I give this movie 4 stars because it is truly hilarious!
I:8690;659;The best 109 minutes I ever spentin college, lots of times.
I:8690;660;A great time for everyone.
I:8690;661;One of the funniest movies ever.
I:8690;662;This movie is a true classic.
I:8690;663;Still funny after all these years!
I:8690;664;The special features are almost as good as the movie.
I:8690;665;I really liked the feature on the movie making process.
I:8690;666;Looks like those guys had a lot of fun.
I:8690;667;It was fun watching this again, last time seeing it at the theatre and a couple of times on TV.
I:8690;668;I would recommend it to anyone that was in college in the 60's or 70's.
I:8690;669;It holds up well after nearly 40 years (dang.
I:8690;670;Not as consistent or solid as later Landis/Ramis works, but it's kind of cool to see their styles and voices evolve.
I:8690;671;Lots of actors you know today in tiny roles (Kevin Bacon's first film role, for example.)
I:8690;672;The jokes hold up well, particularly if the time and setting are taken into account.
I:8690;673;Belushi has some of the best bits, often without uttering a word.
I:8690;674;see for film comedy aficionados.
I:8690;675;I got exactly what was sold.
I:8690;676;The movie comes in a nice case just like it would if you bought it in the store.
I:8690;677;In my head, this was a fast paced hysterical tribute to an earlier time with loads of laughs and many bright new stars.
I:8690;678;If you went to college and were in a fraternity (or sorority) this film is great to relive those fun days.
I:8690;679;My kids love it .
I:8690;680;Entertaining harmless old movies are fun to watch with your kids .
I:8690;681;Okay, it's pretty funny, and it has lots of silly scenes.
I:8690;682;Great sexy, wacky scenes that reminded me of a big budget nutty version of M*A*S*H* (who dares to tell me that Animal House is better than M*A*S*H*, huh?!?!?)
I:8690;683;"D. day was good with his motorcycle, his Deathmobile
I:8690;684;Babs, tour guide at Universal Studios.
I:8690;685;Still waithing to meet the right woman.
I:8690;686;Kevin Bacon becomes a right wing religious nut, saw Jesus in his food, went on self.
I:8690;687;Robert Hoover, four kids, wife, two cars, has everythinga man can want.
I:8690;688;an Animal House Yearbook and documentary, gets real with the story.
I:8690;689;"The producers had created ""Laser Orgy Girls"", which was like ""Charles Manson in High School"", so in order to make it they moved it to college."
I:8690;690;This movie was funny when it came out and it's still funny today.
I:8690;691;both because it's a classic movie and because I get tickled remembering how I got tickled then.
I:8690;692;My husband and I didn't grow up anywhere near each other, but we can watch this movie together now and it's as if we're about the ages we were when this came out, and time gets zipped.
I:8690;693;I laugh at the same things I laughed at then, and find he's laughing at the same things I'm laughing at.
I:8690;694;this is one of the funniest classics that i know of.
I:8690;695;one of the family's favorites!!!
I:8690;696;John Belushi is in a class by himself as far as being funny.
I:8690;697;This is one of his best efforts and he really makes the movie.
I:8690;698;One of the best old school movies!!!
I:8690;699;Glad I found it .
I:8690;700;My teenagers love it one of the best.
I:8690;701;The average person can see Animal House in two ways.
I:8690;702;"First I would like to say that Tonga and Raymond need to keep the eye on the prize
I:8690;703;that being said, this is the greatest college comedy of all time.
I:8690;704;The best National Lampoon has ever done.
I:8690;705;He loved it and the film is most likely on his all time favorites list now too.
I:8690;706;Pretty much a must see, still relevant despite how long ago it was made.
I:8690;707;I'm not a huge comedy fan but this one is definitely hard to beat.
I:8690;708;I received in mail promptly.
I:8690;709;I enjoy watching this movie over the years and look forward to watching it unedited.
I:8690;710;One of the funniest movies ever made, EVER!!
I:8690;711;If you're in the mood for a totally outrageous, funny and histerical movie, then this is the one for you.
I:8690;712;This is my personal favorite comedy of all time.
I:8690;713;Some of the funniest stuff I've ever read was in the pages of Lampoon in the 1970's and these were the guys writing the script.
I:8690;714;then a perfect cast came together.
I:8690;715;I personally believe that one of the great strengths of ANIMAL HOUSE is that the bad guys are as well.
I:8690;716;crafted and hilarious as the Deltas: Dean Wormer's It's time someone put their foot down.
I:8690;717;i also believe director John Landis gave the film an affectionate, nostalgic look as well as brought a wonderful timing to every scene (holding on the expression of a character before cutting to the next scene added more laughs to several scenes).
I:8690;718;i know I've given a film school flunky's opinion of this film, but the main reason ANIMAL HOUSE works so well: it's hilarious!
I:8690;719;Well worth a view for anyone with a little college fun left in them.
I:8690;720;aw and he love it, he had told me he wished he had a copy of ani mal house and so one day I was on here looking for something and thought hay I'll look and see if Amazon has it and U did soo !
I:8690;721;I 1st saw this movie in 1980 and its hilarious john belushi gives a greatest performance, i liked it
I:8690;722;Let me say that Animal House is in my opinion one of the best comedies ever made.
I:8690;723;The video transfer is good but it's far from top.
I:8690;724;On a final note the extra's are nice.
I:8690;725;And I thought judging by those scenes and the you'll like it coming from my dad that I would enjoy it and went out and bought it @ blockbuster with a gift card I had just recieved.
I:8690;726;(even with the select few chuckle worthy scenes) I was able to sell it, but not for nearly as much as I paid.
I:8690;727;Good riddens is all I can say!
I:8690;728;John Belushi was a comic genius and will always be remembered for this great movie and The Blues Brothers.
I:8690;729;Great comedy with super actors.
I:8690;730;The action is very funny, the acting superb.
I:8690;731;The plot is simple but maintains the enjoyment of the movie.
I:8690;732;Great to take out and watch with friends.
I:8690;733;Good old days type fun.
I:8690;734;Get your popcorn and enjoy!
I:8690;735;The best parts of the movie involve the raucous parties, especially with Otis Day and the Knights playing at the toga party or Belushi's druken antics throughout.
I:8690;736;john Belushi is great as Bluto Blatarsky, a brother who has been in college for seven years and has a GPA of 0.0.
I:8690;737;His eyebrows alone could tell a hilarious story.
I:8690;738;Any scene that he is in is funny whether it be the toga party or when they leave Neidermeyer's horse in the dean's office.
I:8690;739;The widescreen presentation looks fine and the movie is just as good as ever, but the extras are not very good.
I:8690;740;Animal House is a comedy classic with plenty of gross out jokes throughout that will keep you laughing.
I:8690;741;Belushi is just as funny as ever so go out and watch Animal House!
I:8690;742;This is one of the top comedy movies ever made.
I:8690;743;the casting was perfectly done for this movie, the acting and script are well done and not only Belushi is great.
I:8690;744;National Lampoon's Animal House has gotta be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life!
I:8690;745;If anyone likes any of National Lampoon's movies, I definately recommend this, because in my oppinion this is their best!
I:8690;746;Funny then, hilarious now even after all these many years.
I:8690;747;Such a classic movie, I had to get it.
I:8690;748;I got it at a great price cheaper than anywhere else I bet.
I:8690;749;A very entertaining movie, truly a college classic!
I:8690;750;While the lifestyles of the college fraternity have changed drastically since the Toga, Toga, Toga days of the 60's, it still serves as a cult favorite among many of America's youth.
I:8690;751;Worth another look, never out of style, a must see for popular culture education.
I:8690;752;An excellent movie that holds up well even after all these years.
I:8690;753;so, the mockumentary being the best part of the package besides the movie.
I:8690;754;This movie is a classic, and extremely funny.
I:8690;755;This in my opinion is one of the best comedy ever made.
I:8690;756;college son still laughed when he watched it for the first time.
I:8690;757;extra video reminds the viewer just how long ago this was made.
I:8690;758;This movie has been one of my favorites ever since it came out.
I:8690;759;This is an extremely funny movie.
I:8690;760;The 'making of' movie was interesting to watch.
I:8690;761;If you went to college, you will recognize most of the characters in the movie.
I:8690;762;The late 1970s were a great time for movies.
I:8690;763;The movie has an ensemble cast, but it is John Belushi as Bluto who steals the show.
I:8690;764;Though there times the movie becomes somewhat tasteless, it tempers those moments with wit and quick dialogue.
I:8690;765;It is one of the few young adult comedies that is actually funny instead of being just plain stupid.
I:8690;766;Being in college never looked so good.
I:8690;767;As part of a fraternity that never graduates, two guys are pledged into the fraternity and let the games begin.
I:8690;768;John Belushi is funny in trying to cheer up everyone.
I:8690;769;These guys certainly had fun in college.
I:8690;770;A great classic movie to watch even now, has a great following.
I:8690;771;And i am sure there will be more generations to come to discover this movie and take it to their hearts as well.
I:8690;772;Loved it when it came out in the theaters.
I:8690;773;The extras just add to the fun.
I:8690;774;I saw this as a young teen at the theatre (the folks had no idea what they were in for) and have yet to see a movie of this genre that sniffs it.
I:8690;775;Great cast, script and soundtrack make for a truley hilarious movie (I consequently bought the soundtrack which I still spin to push a party over the top).
I:8690;776;This two disc package is especially cool as there is a 45 minute documentary on the making of the film that any enthusiast will find interesting.
I:8690;777;i have seen this movie well over a thoiusand times in the past 15 years!
I:8690;778;I have to say that the cast are excellent, the music totally brilliant, and that it ihas inspired many a good nuight in opr out ta,ming on the personas of the the characters portrayed.
I:8690;779;see it tobelieve it, see it to dream it, see it to LIVE IT.
I:8690;780;Anyone from 15 to 500 will appreciate where this film is coming from, and the cult will live on into the 22nd Century.
I:8690;781;I love this movie and so will you.
I:8690;782;There are so many memorable scenes that you only have to watch the movie several times before you can qoute all the characters.
I:8690;783;this movie is crazy, but a good one.
I:8690;784;Even today, many years after it first came out, Animal House still stands head and shoulders above the competition.
I:8690;785;Like its undoubted star .
I:8690;786;rousing speech given to his fraternity brothers after they are finally bombed out of Faber.
I:8690;787;this could be the greatest night of our lives'.
I:8690;788;Instead, the comedy in Animal House is painted in primary.
I:8690;789;There's also a typically odd.
I:8690;790;put quite simply, Animal House is a modern American classic.
I:8690;791;at the end of the film, Landis uses a series of freeze frames to tell what happens to the characters.
I:8690;792;thank you for contacting us.
I:8690;793;we appreciate your patronage and hope you continue to enjoy this and otherUniversal releases.
I:8690;794;This has to be one of the best comedies of all time, John Belushi in the role that made him famous is absolutely hilarious to watch and this film also features I performance of 'Shout' that just makes you wanna get up and dance.
I:8690;795;I recommend this film if you liked American Pie and Old School (although they will never come close to Animal House, the film that spawned them all)
I:8690;796;This is the best frat movie ever!
I:8690;797;Any movie that stars John Belushi is great and this one is the best.
I:8690;798;It is a great family movie but if you have kids under 16 I'd get the PG.13 version.
I:8690;799;This film is a truly laugh out loud sensation that'll leave you begging for more.
I:8690;800;When I first saw this movie, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and laughed the whole night away.
I:8690;801;Overall, this is one of the greatest comedies I've ever seen.
I:8690;802;John Belushie from SNL delivers one of the best preformences ever i love this movie.
