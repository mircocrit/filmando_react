1;This disc is great for those who need sleep and are afraid of sleeping pills.you'll be in snooze world before you can say, where's the remote.
2;*** Slight spoiler at the end of this review ***The acting and directing in this movie are remarkable.
3;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson very convincingly portray two lonely souls who meet each other in the bar of an upscale hotel in the middle of ultra fast.
4;the acting is quite subtle with so many wonderful facial expressions used by both actors to communicate feelings to the audience.
5;This is, perhaps in large part, due to the audience's ability to easily see Murray as that aging, cynical movie star who grudgingly travels to Japan to make a healthy sum of money starring in a Japanese whiskey commercial.
6;roger Ebert beautifully describes the final scene of the movie (in his September 2003 review):I loved the moment near the end when Bob runs after Charlotte and says something in her ear, and we're not allowed to hear it.
7;One of the most powerful movies I've ever seem.
8;Most peole say that this film is sad, but I find the film to be hopeful.
9;I'm a huge movie fan so i won't tell you anything more.
10;This moive is in my top ten.
11;It is a truly sensitive look at relationships, lonliness and culture.
12;The cinematography is beautiful, the acting superb, and its themes are timeless without being trite.
13;It also has some of the funniest moments that I've seen in a film in a long while.
14;When I saw this movie, I was with (I believe) three other people, and we all agreed that this was quite possibly one of the best movies from the last five years.
15;Incredibly written and beautifully directed, Lost in Translation is a movie that some people get, some people don't.
16;But if you're looking for a beautiful and deep look at love and romance, give this movie a go.
17;overlooked and critically acclaimed movie.
18;lost in Translation is melodic in it's presentation, and the incredible dialogue, top.
19;notch directing and perfect sound editing make this movie a gem.
20;It had some fun moments, some introspective things I could relate to, good acting and cinematography.
21;I'm super biased, but this is a gorgeous, well written, well acted movie.
22;It's funny for people who understand subtlety.
23;First of all let me say that I truly appreciate those filmmakers who strive to say something witty or subtle with their works.
24;Cinema can be such a very high form of art due to its excitation of multiple senses.
25;The idea is beautiful, truly creative and full of potential.
26;Finding friendship in an alien and confusing world is indisputably a noble idea.
27;All in all I left this movie with a profound sense of nothingness.
28;I gave it two stars for originality and good intentions.
29;She displayed such an enchanting naturalness thoughout the film.
30;Her performance, in my opinion, was more impressive than Murray's.
31;Those who enjoy the typical Hollywood approach to film making will generally dislike this movie.
32;What there is, is a subtle, underlying set of emotions that you either will or will not relate to.
33;Like most great things, this movie is not a compromise.
34;I must say that this is definitely one of the more unique movies I have seen in a long time, and were it not for his past in Hollywood, Bill Murray would win an Oscar for Best Actor.
35;this is easily Murray's greatest performance.
36;He is also able to convey Bob's loneliness very easily.
37;One of the more intriguing characters in cinema the last couple of years.
38;johansson is delightful in this movie.
39;She gives an undeniably good performance here, but what sold me on her was her way with little things, especially facial expressions (a hint of a smile or a biting of her lip add depth to her character).
40;The scenes that require her to actually ACT (the solo scenes in her apartment or her wandering thru Tokyo) are also well.
41;She sold me on her character by simply becoming her: as she lies in bed with Murray, you can sense the feeling of uneasiness and isolation in her.
42;murray, and the rest of us, understand and share her feelings.
43;who directed this with an intriguing focus on environment .
44;has a great movie on her hands.
45;but she somehow manages to make it interesting.
46;A viewer said this movie was boring, but I must disagree with him/her: the viewer is sold on both characters from the moment they see them, and this keeps the viewer enthralled.
47;One can sense a feeling of warmth and caring beneath Bob's weathered exterior, and Charlotte, as a friend said, has a girl next door appeal to her.
48;a fact which can be attributed to Coppola's ability to develop the characters in a minimalist fashion.
49;so to conclude, the acting is superb (Johannson and Murray are wonderful in their roles) and the directing is just as good.
50;It also has its funny moments, but its usually serious.
51;Somehow, Coppola was able to take a foreign hotel and two characters and make it entertaining.
52;this film takes a formulaic Hollywood sensibility and gives it a languid, arty presentation.
53;I have , so it did connect with me .
54;I like actors playing with their stereotypes and this is a successful example .
55;looks like the Coppola family talent is inherited .
56;helmed indie continues to touch the heart in such a way that all those who watch it inevitably realize that they will remember it forever .
57;the opening of Lost finds star Bill Murray in a Tokyo cab on a dark night, wondering how he got there, a `has.
58;as Murray's Bob Harris struggles to understand himself and the city around him in the nighttime embrace of a hotel piano bar, he meets twenty.
59;They are two strangers in a strange land drawn together by a chemistry that goes beyond the whimsicality of physical attraction and the frivolity of sex, two people alone in a city of twenty million who find the cure for their solitude .
60;and the beauty of living .
61;the two lovers whose intimacy exists solely in the realm of transcendental human affection.
62;and a rare, aching smile .
63;sofia Coppola, Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johansson have together given moviegoers a look at humanity and passion and romance and life and love so vivid, so emotionally powerful, that only the sight of Bob and Charlotte's final embrace on a busy Shinjuku street can even begin to express a beauty otherwise inexpressible.
64;I love that kind of film so I was quite looking forward to a little simple.
65;what I got was a film that truly moved me .
66;What I got was a beautiful visual experience, that left me feeling as if I was actually in the film (a feeling I've never had before with a film).
67;What I got was a story about two characters that I felt I could really relate to and understand on a much closer level than I have seen in other films.
68;What I got was a sense of having seen something truly magical, and when I left the cinema, I felt that I had to see it again.
69;i've always liked Bill Murray in almost any role he has been in, but he outshone himself this time.
70;Not since The Razor's Edge have I seen him display so well that he is not just a comedian but an ACTOR of quite considerable talent.
71;That part of the film alone was worth seeing and it was only one brilliant scene among many.
72;Maybe that's one of the reasons why it is so easy to connect with.
73;Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises is the perfect example of a story in which there is virtually no overt plot, yet a considerable amount of action is occurring at levels other than those of action.
74;But if you are interested in films where the characters are more important than the effects (e. g., Sideways) then Lost In Translation will be perfect for you.
75;In any case though, its a great film.
76;It captures the feeling of being out of place and living in a foreign country really perfectly.
77;Any one who has ever done it knows that it can be a really traumatic experience.
78;The actors and director really capture the mood and pace of such an experience really well.
79;The shots of Japan are memorable.
80;I think most people should see it and form their own opinion on the movie itself regardless of what others are saying.
81;My favorite part of the movie is that is a realistic portrayl of life unlike 90% of the movies made.
82;Most movies always have a happy ending where a love relationship is formed in two days, the good looking hero beats the ugly villan, and rarely am I able to connect and honestly feel moved about it.
83;This movie has incredible cimematography, there is just enough subtle humor for me at least, and the acting is great.
84;Also, the filmmaker captured the emotion of the actors which doesn't happen in enough movies.
85;This shows a story that has a much better chance of being something the viewer could experience.
86;You'll either love it or hate it, but I think it is always positive when art evokes such a strong reaction and thats where this movie succeds.
87;If you like this movie, check out In the Mood for Love, it inspired this movie.
88;A night stroll through this marvelous city aside a love one can picture perfect how intimacy can be achieved by huge surroundings of people and endless movement.
89;Romantic love between a man and a woman is a constant of two, a third one means crowd.
90;They fall in love, no longer mundane but unique.
91;More strolling as the couple gaze at that Big Pink Dinosaur.
92;to cheer you up, to hold you save, still strolling through Tokyo and its overwhelming architecture, the couple feels the bond.
93;What a great time to be with each other!
94;Tonight's plan will take us to one of those popular bars where you can be alone with your friends and have a good time.
95;It pleases me to be with you.
96;Sophia Coppola's pace and cinematic composure is perfect and flawless.
97;The acting level is simply splendid.
98;Highly in shape, Bill Murray is the perfect muse, natural, complex, as far as I am concern, this is no acting but a real life person caught in motion.
99;Tender Scarlett Johansson pleases the eye with every gesture and word, sexy and lone, a breathtaking performance my dear.
100;card but a realistic color depict of the great Tokyo gathered with an exact camera movement.
101;That's one of the best depictions of hope ever caught in Cinema History.
102;He comes back to the limousine with a big sense of fulfillment.
103;She continues her stroll, alone yes, but with a huge gaze of happiness and satisfaction.
104;This movie is quite good.
105;I love the revelation of Tokyo which I'm guessing is a first for most westerners.
106;The gamer subculture glimpsed in the arcade parlor is amazing.
107;Try it out and see if you agree.
108;If that's your bag, then maybe you'll be able to stay awake and watch this movie.
109;I liked the plot of the movie, inspite of it being quite predictible, the background score's good and amazing performances by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.
110;I liked the movie, give it a short if you wanna go for a slow movie.
111;I just went into theatre expecting to see a more than oscar worthy movie at the very least.
112;johansson is a beautiful, young, newlywed on the verge of cynicism .
113;She's tagging along with her photographer husband who is shooting photographs for various jobs.
114;scarlett Johansson is lovely, funny and witty.
115;Murray would, at first glance, seem an unlikely match but the two have terrific chemistry.
116;Copolla clearly loves the characters, oblivious to their flaws and it works because I felt the same way.
117;Listen to the lyrics of the soundtrack as you watch the film and you'll see what I mean.
118;It's a genuinely touching story that all of us can relate to in one form or another.
119;The service was quick and the movie came in great condition.
120;For my price paid, it was a steal.
121;I defiantely recommend this vendor .
122;Though I waited awhile for it, it was delivered on time and came in good condition.
123;Perhaps he was (or still is) a talent agent or head of a prominent studio.
124;He is bent on revenge.
125;This movie was so entertaining and well created.
126;The characters were very well played out.
127;it seemed they just naturally fitted into their roles.
128;The soundtrack is unbelievable including the amazing Kevin Shields, Squarepusher, and many others.
129;The scenery was just so beautiful to watch.
130;Everything about this film felt so original and true.
131;The visuals and sounds seemed youthful and free, yet both were having problems in their other relationship, and this paradox I found made the story more unique and interesting.
132;Overall, the screenplay was well written.
133;but sometimes the simpliest things are the brilliant things.
134;I just loved the whole idea how friendship can happen between anyone, and can come and go so quickly.
135;It was pretty darn good.
136;Coppola does a superb job of conveying emotion through scenery.
137;happy to stroll through the streets and buildings of Tokyo and VERY HAPPY to watch the karaoke sequence (youll know what im talking about).
138;but that is the beauty of this film.
139;Definitely one of the better movies ive seen in a long, long time.
140;this film just shows me what can be done, when a smart director takes her time to develop characters which we learn to care about.
141;Yet they connect and share a few moments in their lives that they shall take with them the rest of their days.
142;Very smart because again it is really about very little and yet it kept my attention to the very last second.
143;A star in the making.
144;but to me the best and most outstanding moment is the end when Murray chases Johnasson down on the Tokyo street and you realize in that final meeting together how special he thinks she is.
145;the actors did a fine job.
146;i have traveled a lot, and if people go into a new culture as these two did, with the amounts of time and money that they appeared to have, and still could be so pitiable, I have no sympathy.
147;i think Blade Runner captures more of the sense of isolation in a strange environmeent, and the disconnect of beings from life, than this did, and that is just one film off the top of my head.
148;This is possibly one of the sweetest, loveliest films I've ever seen.
149;It's also fresh and unique, something that can't be said for much coming out Hollywood these days.
150;Murray's subtle performance is both tragic and gently funny.
151;Johannsen is wise beyond her years, and I can't wait to see what she does next.
152;great things are coming to this young woman.
153;it's worth owning and experiencing on a regular basis.
154;So at least we must give to Sofia Coppola the credit for making a movie that rejects the typical elements of the romantic comedy.
155;Her screenplay is the most rewarded aspect of the film, also, Bill Murray's performance has gathered some acting prizes as well.
156;Lost In Translation is a must seen to all the fans of the great Bill Murray, one of the finest comedians there are in these days.
157;He gives perhaps his most mature performance to date.
158;Also, she is very beautiful and classy and she has won some awards for her performance in Lost In Translation.
159;For those reasons Lost In Translation is a good movie, but some details prevent this film to be a true classic.
160;movie appeal, it is a work of art nonetheless.
161;It is too innocent to be sexual, too sexual to be friendship, but most importantly, it is a joy to watch.
162;discovery and fulfillment is emotional and humorous.
163;Sensitive, smart, masterfully performed and flawlessly directed.
164;In my opinion, one of the best films of all times.
165;Johansson is sexy and intelligent, however a little snobish and lost.
166;Bill Murray brings great dramedy doing what no other actor could have achieved this perfectly: He is funny without trying to be funny.
167;in a conventional Hollywod film Charlotte and Bob would have had an affair and blah blah blah, but here the relationship between them is treated very subtly, it evolves in a beautiful and organic way.
168;coppolla includes silent, reflective moments, and also ridiculous over the top misshaps
169;This is truly a cinematic gem, incredibly relatable, even if you are not a burnt out movie star working in Japan or a young college grad at an emotional crossroad
170;It's a touching and poignant film.
171;For once the making of is a genuine production diary and not just a promotional device.
172;I loved it, particularly Bill Murray's Japanese lessons Who do you think you're talking to!
173;I also enjoyed the offtakes.
174;But it's good to see the evident affection they have for one another.
175;for now, Sofia Coppola is a breath of fresh air in the film industry.
176;I hope she can keep it up.
177;The best scene is the karaoke scene.
178;As well as on top of that, this movie gets an Oscar?
179;just have a look on Tokyo from hotel (while Scarlett is gazing through the huge window) and enjoy the swettiest sadness ever filmed!Probably you may say that this practically two.
180;so if u're a kind of fan I bet you like it!Moshi.
181;In my mind, this is movie perfectly embodies the disconnected, lonely feeling one experiences even among millions of people when undergoing an existential crisis.
182;I still remember the feeling I got the first time I watched this.
183;And Sofia Coppola, showing her immensely skill at direction, manages to impart an appreciation of the noble beauty of loneliness which lingers after the credits have finished rolling.
184;this movie is stylish, funny, deep, and real, and for all of these reasons, it deserves a top spot on any philosophical filmgoer's list.
185;i really cant understand that viewpoint,always waiting for something to always happen.
186;this is one of the best movies I have seen.
187;its the kind of picture that will probably stay with you forever,like a part of youre own life.
188;it is so good because it captures some of the most honest moments that are only caught once,just this one time,and you can see that,and miss it the minute its over.
189;just like a day in someones life,it happens one time,and thats it!
190;Wow, those Japanese sure are strange and quirky!
191;This kind of attitude reminds me an agape.
192;the glaring light show of a Ginza, Shinjuku, or Roppongi, the vending machines that dispense panties advertised as used by schoolgirls for fetishists, the rapid transit rails that are a wonder to behold, the anime, manga, and video game culture, etc.
193;Not good, especially when you're appealing to a crowd with a bit more select tastes.
194;driven movie such as this.
195;now, that said, once you get past all this, we come to an interesting character study, and this *is* worthwhile.
196;bill Murray, on the other hand, delivered a fine performance.
197;Replace Johanssen, you still have a movie.
198;now, with that said, the writing, while a bit sparse at times (coming from the school that's it is better to say too little than too much) is quite good, some of the best of 2003.
199;Much of it does ring true, and it's nicely bittersweet without veering off too much into mawkishness.
200;I was utterly and completely moved by this film.
201;What's really important in this movie is that they don't really have much of a physically relationship.
202;It's purely emotional, and it's kind of beautiful.
203;i just think this is one of the most beautiful, most moving films I have ever seen.
204;And I certainly hope everyone considering watching this movie is in the get it/love it group, because this film is one that is truly special.
205;The trailer for this movie cheeses it up and portrays it as some all.
206;In fact its a dazzling audiovisual work of art, beautifully told, well acted, with intrigue, appeal and imagination.
207;Scarlett Johanssen's character is so far removed from the average movie heroine that its wonderfully appealing and her journey is sentimental but never cheesy.
208;Talking of which, the soundtrack is great.
209;Dazzling is a perfect word for it: Tokyo is stunning and alluring.
210;Classic stuff, one to remember for years to come.
211;You've probably heard it before, but it's true: this is Bill Murray's best work.
212;The laughs are well earned and are due almost entirely to Bill Murray's talent as an actor.
213;If forced to put this movie into a category, I would call it a romantic comedy (the term gives me shivers), but the friendship between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson is pure.
214;altering changes, but enjoy one beautiful week together before parting.
215;With so many independent films following the standard pacing and plot lines of Hollywood releases, this movie is a very welcome change.
216;If you've seen this movie and liked it, well what can I say.
217;Being a huge Bill Murray fan, I went into this movie wanting to love it.
218;I went into it with no expectations except that it was going to be wonderful in an unconventional way.
219;A close friend of mine loved the movie because she knows what it feels like to be lost .
220;I saw this movie with my friend and i really really liked it!
221;Seeing Murray totally bewildered by these Japanese people.
222;I thought it was a really thoughtful, in a way educated movie.
223;Just a smart, worth watching movie.
224;They are the best people you will know ).
225;I know I would like to know more about each character, but I definitely knew enough about each of them to care about them.
226;He is an actor after all.
227;It is those people that I feel for.
228;I, like the one previous reviewer, can't put it in words, but it works for me.
229;They are connected, and that is what matters.
230;I will continue to see his movies, because he is an outstanding actor, something I would never have thought possible fifteen years ago.
231;the scenes in Tokyo as almost all have agreed were wonderful to behold.
232;I really liked this movie, and do recommend it, but understand that like anything else it is not for everyone.
233;It is that common bond that allows them to open up to one another and share a few great moments that hopefully lead to a better path.
234;There is no better way to do this film: the pace, the acting, and the morphing plotline are perfectly executed to capture the loss, the melancholy, and the bittersweetness of yearning for love.
235;OK, so you insist he is funny?
236;She brought in a tape of Murray doing some kind of dance, was that supposed to be funny?
237;Murray sucks as a comic.
238;it's never entirely clear what 2004's Oscar.
239;one of Bill Murray's rare ventures into 'serious' acting and Scarlett Johansson's introduction to the Hollywood heavenlies (which wasn't hurt by a 30.
240;second indulgent glimpse of her ample behind right at the film's front) .
241;One can't help but feel that Japan the nation was merely the medium for a vague pseudo.
242;point to the two hours of what seems like two people trying to do nothing but cheer each other up.
243;liners and, most significantly IMO, by staring at each other.
244;I've seen Bill Murray's older work (let's face it, Caddyshack is quintessential Bill Murray) and was curious to check him out in a more mature, serious role.
245;Lost in Translation has since become one of my most favorite movies by Murray and in general.
246;centered middle age man in Shopgirl, Murray's character is much more likeable.
247;it's easy to take this movie too literally and find it maybe even repulsive that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen might not be sexually attracted to each other but the beauty of this film is that, regardless of conventional social mores, it can be normal to have a platonic relationship with a person of the opposite sex.
248;Through a subtle story and script, a floaty and dreamlike cinematographical style, and the underlying theme of humour and love, this film captures the feeling of being lost .
249;Lost in Translation captures the essence of what the main characters are experiencing during their stay in Tokyo.
250;John and Charlotte meet at the highly polished hotel they are both staying at and form a unique bond during their week in the impossibly foreign, overwhelmingly urban, hectic and dream.
251;Each scene captures the essence of being both lost in one's surroundings and in one's self.
252;The scenes are designed to embody the sometimes embarassing and funny things that can happen in an unfamiliar culture, or simply capture the powerful bond that Charlotte and John share during their time in Tokyo.
253;No, it's not a romance between Charlotte and John, but they do form a certain love and deep understanding during their week's stay and both begin to find their way a bit easier after meeting each other.
254;Murray and Johansson were a pleasure to watch in this film and very convincing when capturing the essence of the bond that their two characters share.
255;Not to mention a subtle and cool soundtrack, a floaty cinematographic style, understated humour, and best of all, a sweet yet appropriate ending, this movie is certainly one of the best films of the year.
256;i love Japan and Tokyo and wanted to connect to the story.
257;it's because she is so concerned with interior decorating that he takes up with a Japanese hooker.
258;much of the film's supposed humor was based on making fun of Japanese language and customs.
259;i want more in a film and especially in the female characters.
260;Throughout the movie, the visuals were great, and Sofia Coppola has credited the more experienced people in her crew that helped her achieve such a look.
261;With 'Lost in Translation', she proves herself a worthy successor to her father and to my sensibilities, will likely surpass him (if she hasn't already).
262;Bill Murray's been a great actor for a long time, and if you didn't believe it before, this film will convince you.
263;Only with these performances and the carefully meted out patience of Coppola could such a film as this work, and as it works without any noticeable flaws: it is a marvel.
264;For Bob, his wife might prove a source of comfort, but the long distance calls to her prove even more alienating
265;The characters simply live their lives across the screen .
266;And the end result is astounding.
267;For the next hour, I said, This movie has to go somewhere, some time.
268;Other than those three parts, the beginning, middle and end, it was a great movie.
269;E. bay to the rescue!
270;It's a film that I quite liked.
271;It's a better and more complex one.
272;Charlotte is the wife of a fashion photographer, played by Giovanni Ribisi who's in town to do a shoot.
273;libbed by Murray and the Japanese cast.
274;a Japanese character nicknamed Charlie Brown singing the Sex Pistols God Save the Queen in a karaoke bar, does .
275;I'm not going to give much of that away, but it's an extremely sensitive portrayal of a budding relationship between what is .
276;It is a subtle comedy with humor implied by a passing glance such as it in reality.
277;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen are terrific together.
278;He chooses to further his career by doing a whiskey ad for the Japanese.
279;The film creates this moment in time feeling that fate meant for these two characters to meet and realise that they are not alone.
280;Even though they are strangers they recognize that they are soul mates.
281;december love thing , it is a coming of age , sometimes funny , sometimes sad look at life.
282;a lot has been said about BM acting in this, but the directing by Sofia Coppola is brilliant, and I think she has a very good future.
283;The lenses used and the position of the camera really make for the emotion of the actors to come through.
284;all good stuff for a movie that needs to have elements to prop up a totally emotional film.
285;you will giggle from time to time because of BM's affable character that he brings to life in every scene that he is in (especially the commericial out takes) but you will find an actor that is really fun to watch and enjoy in this movie.
286;What meaningful existence do these two individuals have?The movie should have answered those questions.
287;Instead it looks more like a beautiful travelogue dazzling us with the sparkling lights of Tokyo.
288;Beautiful scenes, wonderful acting and the true growth of a human being at loose ends in her life.
289;I thought that the premise was great, two people lonely in a strange land befriend each other.
290;I got the feeling that we just touched the surface of these two instead of getting a good understanding of them.
291;I highly recommend this title.
292;But overall a solid release and worthy of being part of any home theatre collection.
293;It's about two people in a situation that brings them together and makes that situation better.
294;He plays a perfect zombie.
295;Bill, please get back to doing movies like Stripes!
296;The best thing about this film is Bill Murray.
297;He is one of the most underrated actors out there today and the fact that he didn't get the Oscar for his performance just shows how effortless he made his performance look.
298;I thought he was funny and poignant and I'm not sure this film could have worked without him.
299;Aside from that portion which nearly lost my attention, the film was very good and well worth watching if you're a fan of Bill Murray and character studies.
300;overall, a good film, but definitely not for everyone!!
301;Certainly not worth the Best Film Oscar nod, but still pretty good.
302;First, I reiterate that this is a good, borderline great, film.
303;irvine, a fine school for literary theory, to understand art.
304;star passion, there may be a connection.3.
305;The film is extremely postmodern in certain key regards.
306;Realism is something that anyone can get as well as enjoy and something that non.
307;Most movies show the story, but this film is made in such a manor that you feel the story.
308;the way this movie is written and filmed makes you live the experience with the characters instead of just seeing it happen to them.
309;I'm sorry to be arguing with so many critics praising this as a GREAT MOVIE, but perhaps like the title says, the comedy, story and enjoyment, was a least for me .
310;Sofia Coppola brilliantly explores the stifling emotions of longing and ennui.
311;The Murray and Johansson characters share a kind of physical and emotional isolation from their homes and their spouses respectively.
312;pounding and believable considering the connection the two had.
313;Coppola does provide moments of unbridled joy that, juxtaposed with her portrayal of ineffable longing, become all the more intense.
314;This will be a film for the ages, and we are fortunate that we can see it now.
315;beautifully acted, two people are tossed together by circumstances they don't particularly like, but they do come together, befriend one another, and unfold a layer they didn't know they had.
316;So glad to see it finally on Blu.
317;The film has a melancholy charm and humor to it that really resonates with me.
318;I just love the movie.
319;I really enjoy this film, but it is definitely not for everyone.
320;The dynamic between Scarlett Johannsen and Bill Murray is really beautiful to watch .
321;one of the sweetest and least conventional love stories I've seen in a long time, actually.
322;For those of you who want to see a beautiful, moving, incredibly powerful film, see this one.
323;It's truest beauty is in it's simplicity.
324;Its loaded with exquisite images of the city , the life and the culture of the Japanese.
325;That's all I have to say.
326;Oh, and Scarlett Johansson in high definition.
327;This film tells the honest story of a lonely man in a troubled marriage .
328;for the way it accurately tells that story.
329;Sofia Coppola succeeds in pulling you inside the hotel and feeling that unique feeling of being away from home .
330;She has a way of pulling the viewer into the emotion of a scene and not letting go .
331;she makes sure you see those looks, those glances .
332;That is where the strength of this film lies .
333;I even liked Ana Faris's performance .
334;the dialogue was so good when there .
335;scarlett johansson and Bill Murray's performances are flawless.
336;and so it makes the shyness and the banter between them even more attractive.
337;but it has to end.
338;totally original, unique and personal to the viewer.6 stars!!!
339;This movie is post modernism at its best.
340;A comedy that is absurdly funny, but essentially goes nowhere.
341;And that is part of what makes this story great: it is totally believable.
342;It is a love story that transcends the need to live happily ever after.
343;there are numerous scenes we see the disconnect between Japanese and Americans: Bob Harris towering over the Japanese men in the elevator, Harris as a guest on the talk show, the prostitue that visits his hotel room, the misunderstandings that happen when the Japanese invert their L's and R's.
344;Both Harris and Charlotte feel disconnected from their American, English.
345;lastly, I really enjoyed seeing a love story that didn't become sexual.
346;A bond occured between an older man and a young woman.
347;That is the love story, and it was a stronger love story than I've seen in most movies.
348;It provides the film goer with an inside view of the interaction between a middle aged man and a twenty something girl.
349;although the film moves slowly and has no real plot, it remains compelling.
350;None of these questions is answered with clarity.
351;The film becomes quite engaging as the viewer is almost hypnotised by the manoeuvrings of the couple.
352;see this film as a means of providing insights to human behaviour in a world far more real than the usual offerings of Hollywood.
353;I can't help but wonder how this marvelous film can receive such little love.
354;that is sad, because what Sophia Coppola has done here is create and deliver a touching and poignant look at humanity at its purest, which is something we rarely see today.
355;a lot of times we see raw and honest portrayals of the dark side of humanity when we look at intelligent cinema.
356;All too often our own realistic brutality is splashed across the screen, bringing us closer to our very own demons.
357;I applaud filmmakers brave enough to ascertain the notion that honesty is the best policy, willing to expose us for who we are without a care for the audience reaction.
358;This pays off extremely well for some, and I have to admit that I have always gravitated towards the darker corners of the cinematic experience.
359;Instead of focusing on the parts of us we want to hide from, Coppola exposes the purity that is in most of us
360;`Lost in Translation' is a beautiful and honest account of two people who, simply put, fill and need within one another.
361;sophia Coppola is a personal favorite of mine.
362;provoking and intelligent, and wildly creative.
363;I love her style, which is unique and visionary.
364;and the way she works with actors is a dream!Bill Murray is a great comedian, one who I adore in nearly everything.
365;This performance will go down in history as his greatest achievement.
366;He really understood how to use his unique brand of deadpan humor to create a man who is very real and very personable.
367;She matches Murray scene for scene, but the natural flourishes she adds to her scenes elevate her slightly above him in my opinion.
368;Just watch the way she adds a flinch or a chuckle here and there, adding color and individuality to such a beautifully fleshed out character.
369;there are few films that can reach this level of earnest beauty.
370;One recent film that comes very close is `Once'.
371;I watched it a few times since it came out and I'm sure I'll watch it again and again.
372;I liked the music, I liked the acting (although there was nothing special about Bill Murray's performance) and I like the point it tries to make.
373;I can really relate with the two characters who are trying to find there place in the world, but it was the connection these two made that hit me the deepest.
374;Making that kind of connection with another human being is a very rare and special thing.
375;There were some very humorous moments in this movie as well.
376;This movie is about mood and about the unexpected nature of life.
377;The beauty of this movie is that we see that there is hope within this lonliness, there is the potential for human connection and that that the world is really not that big afer all.
378;One of the cutest and most real affairs ever captured on film.
379;It is easy to fall in love with both characters, and the movie will continue to calm and relax ater repeated watching.
380;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansenn both do wonderful jobs in their roles of two lonely Americans in the world's most congested city.
381;She recently graduated college with a degree in philosophy, and she has no idea of what to do with her life.
382;Anyway, Bob and Charlotte soon meet, and a friendship develops.
383;They simultaneously have a physical attraction to each other, as well as a sort of father/daughter relationship going on.
384;there is also a comedic element to the film.
385;It will make you chuckle when you see these two Americans trying to blend into their surroundings.
386;However, thanks to Murray's and Johansenn's fine acting as well as the excellent directing of Sofia Coppola, this movie really works.
387;First of all, I found the movie to be very entertaining.
388;I love the cinematography, dialogue, acting, characters, and especially the scenes of Tokyo.
389;By just seeing this film I now have a strong desire to visit Japan.
390;i found the central theme of the movie to be a very truthful representation of many people living in our time.
391;The fact that they are trying at all to find the answers is encouraging to me.
392;of course the film also takes a close look at marriage and romance.
393;It seems clear to me that Johansen's character is especially encouraged to love her husband more than ever once he returns.
394;I could talk about Scarlett Johansen's longing to be loved and admired for her beauty (her karaoke song is just one example of this).
395;Bill Murray has the desire to teach, to share, and to laugh.
396;If you look at the movie that way there is a power just because they are seeking and don't look for the answers in having sex with each other or some superficial answer like that.
397;The movie doesn't completely answer the question but it gets the viewer going in the right direction.
398;so 'Virgin Suicides', although it has a fine soundtrack .
399;good to hear the Jesus and Mary Chain blasting out of a mainstream movie, if only to hear 99% of the audience go 'Wow, this is great, who are these guys?'
400;If you want genuinely thought.
401;A trip to Kyoto is a five.
402;Wow, stand back, we have a new comic genius for the new millennium.
403;To me, this film was an elegant, understated and highly accomplished masterpiece.
404;I do get his jokes, and many of them are funny.
405;I love Japan (although I do understand that in this film it serves only as a background .
406;incredibly rich, a tapestry of a background .
407;And it is OK .
408;i find Scarlett Johansson very beautiful (in this not.
409;dazzling way) and her acting razor.
410;sharp
411;I am also amazed that it took so many years for Western filmmakers to realize that an unfulfilled love can also be an interesting story.
412;WOW!On very rare occasions there comes a movie, so wonderful that it just becomes part of you.
413;Bill Murray is at his VERY best as the washed.
414;And Sofia Coppola tells the story with finess, innuendo and wonderful shots.
415;She exhibits the superficial and ridiculous sides of Japan, but she does it with all her hearth and with deep respect.
416;this movie is really a gem.
417;She went through trusted intermediaries, wooed him with gifts, letters, the works.
418;screen persona) finally relented to Ms. Coppola's very subtle charisma and wiles.
419;but, in simplicity, there is brilliance.
420;She scripted *in English* the coaching that the Japanese director gives to Murray prior to the first take.
421;She asked a friend to translate the monologue into Japanese.
422;the rest is just great ad.
423;The improvisational stuff he comes up with in the subsequent photo shoot is pure magic.
424;XD Karaoke is very popular in Japan and it's gaining popularity here in Toronto.
425;this was the first film I have seen by Sofia Coppola and thought she did good in the directing but the story.
426;It moves you in so many ways.
427;It covers every emotion of being a human on the planet.
428;It is the best movie ever made, period.
429;Amazing, beautifull and sweet would be the few initial words to comment on this film.
430;Yet another film having a wonderfull and strong chemistry between the two co. stars.
431;Bill Murray at his best, he is an amazing person to watch on screen, he will steal your glance every moment, Scarlett Johansson delivers a very sattisfying performence as well, she was pretty bold and admirable in this film, you just can't lift your eyes off her, what's more.
432;a wonderfull chemistry, neat and decent acting and direction.
433;Go ahead, give it a watch, you won't be dissapointed.
434;You will realize Friendship is a unique relationship.
435;Funny, touching, sweet, profound in a perfect way.
436;Very simple story, very lovely.
437;The scene at the hospital when Bill Murray is talking to an elderly Japanese man seems completely unrehearsed, natural and it worth watching the movie only for that.
438;The two Japanese ladies sitting behind them keep laughing, it is just great.
439;Bill Murray in the role of a slightly tired and jaded actor is beautiful.
440;This movie is a delight.
441;Scarlett Johannsen is superb, the actor who plays her husband is a perfect young husband and the girl who plays the dumb action movie actress is a hoot.
442;Each scene is fun to watch in itself, little vignettes (did I spell that right?)
443;Because the message the movie gave me is that life is empty and meaningless, that even in such a gorgeous city, you can't be happy and find things you enjoy.
444;All these things are discrimination and racisim.
445;Go to the country, spend time there, and you may be deeply surprised.
446;As someone who lived half of my life in one country and half in another, I have the right to say this.
447;Much has been written so I will try to add a new perspective.
448;This film reminds me of the best work of Eric Rohmer (Summer and Pauline at the Beach, for example) or even the Antoine Doinel films from Truffault.
449;When the film ended I felt a bit happier about humanity, and made me appreciate the wonders of a strong marriage (mine is 20+ years and still terrific.)
450;Truffault and Sofia Coppola all love their characters and it shows in every scene.
451;The result is a movie in which every moment rings true.
452;And when they do the right thing at the end of the film (we don't know exactly what Murray says, but we know for sure it is the right thing), we realize that we would have done the same, because deep down that is just how most of us are.
453;Nothing happens, except nice people behave like nice people.
454;For me, it is to think a bit more about ourselves, our relationships, and humanity.
455;But I do, and I relish this film for inspiring warm thoughts.
456;While a certain amount of ambiguity is interesting, a just friends vibe that suddenly gets blown away by a passionate kiss at the end just seems like Ms. Coppola couldn't decide what she was trying to go for.
457;It fills the heart with hope, that there is a light at the end of the highway.
458;The film revolves around a romance that's not supposed to happen, but does in a touching way.
459;The best picture of the year, beautiful and touching.
460;overall, if you want a good comedy watch Intolerable Cruelty.
461;I really enjoyed all the plot twists.
462;And if you want a good drama get married 
463;thank you for reading this,Anton
464;crazy world, actor Bob Harris (the excellent Bill Murray) and ex.
465;philosophy student Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, just 18 in her breakthrough performance) gradually discover they have something in common.
466;The movie is generous in offering life's numerous little ironies, but these subtle, fragile, thought.
467;provoking aspects are often outweighed by comic situations with funny Japanese people.
468;Camerawork floods us with colours and stunning images, the soundtrack of state.
469;For me at least, I find this movie to be quiet, somewhat symbolic of something, and just stylish.
470;It is stylish in a way that's not flashy, but trendy and artsy.
471;I thought there was decent acting, but I don't feel that the actors were given much to do really.
472;You do end up seeing a lot of nice scenes and images in Japan which I can appreciate.
473;It is set in modern day Japan and you have Bill Murray and Scarlett J staring as the main actors.
474;they end up forming a friendship (which I thought was going to turn into something more).
475;If you like Tom Hanks kind of films, this is probably right up your alley.
476;interestingly enough, though this movie is in English, it reminded me of two foreign flicks.
477;The first minutes of Sofia Coppola's best film to date are quite revealing: A woman, Scarlett Johansson, is in a five star hotel, beholding Tokyo's skyline.
478;A man, Bill Murray, looks through a car's window, curious perhaps, but above all estranged.
479;Combining a deeply poignant music with suggestive images, the director creates a world, a filmic universe that captures our attention immediately.
480;What Sofia Coppola does in the opening frames is what many filmmakers struggle to achieve in their entire careers.
481;perhaps in the best role of his career, Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a washed.
482;out actor that used to be a super star and now has to endorse a Japanese whisky to make a couple of million bucks.
483;But he's also a specular image of the Japanese people's own alienated condition.
484;She's married to a successful photographer but she can't figure out what to do with her time.
485;help audiobooks to feel better, to no avail.
486;But despair takes the best of us all, and thus self.
487;They are the only characters able to actually communicate with each other.
488;however, there is still some true beauty left (beauty as it would be understood in the Genji Monogatari (Japanese Literature
489;Nevertheless, this beauty, this true spirit, is constantly covered by the appalling reality that surrounds the protagonists.
490;sofia Coppola's masterwork resonates deeply inside of us because it's one of the most refined and superb portrayals of the human condition in cinema's history.
491;The final scene, of course, proves once again that there is no such thing as a happy ending, and precisely because of that it reminds us that life is just like that, unpredictable, full of suffering but also possibilities of change and, of course, free will.
492;the amplitudes of the peaks are added together, thus greater than either one.
493;key bemusement will strike a familiar chord.
494;The hotel lighting , background music, dimly lit lounges, exotic glimpses of day.
495;The amazing thing is that Coppola accomplishes this without making the movie depressing.
496;And the effect of this is to make the separation of the two that much more affecting.
497;a marvelous, understated and powerful movie.
498;This is simply my favorite movie of all time.
499;Sofia Coppola's recipe of vivid imagery and wonderfully ambient music makes you feel as if you are there in Tokyo.
500;It will take you away to another place.
501;Being away from home can be a strong link between two people who share it.
502;Bill Murray's performance in this definitely ranks among his best, probably at the very top.
503;Scarlett Johansson's screen time fares just as well, deserving the notion that this was her true breakthrough to stardom.
504;energy shock than a lightning strike.
505;ultimately, this movie deserved all the praise and critical acclaim that it received back in its day.
506;So often films are superfluous, just a piece of entertainment .
507;fine for the normal movie.
508;Sofia Copolla tenderly builds the characters in this movie by allowing the audience to really watch them, not by steering the audience around a flashy, effects.
509;Congratulations to them when they do it, it tends to be a good movie.
510;But I can honestly say that there are few movies that actually make you really *care* about the characters, that is a mark of a truly GREAT film.
511;That is the intensity with which the film carries on, we want them to find each other and to know that they are not alone even in this alien land.
512;It is cinema as an art.
513;form, not just as flashy entertainment.
514;Go, watch it and be touched by it, but be warned, this is a very affecting film about loneliness and solitude and you may not want to see it if you are not ready to share those emotions with the characters for a few hours, I also wouldn't recommend seeing it alone!That said, this is one of the most powerful films I have seen and as such is definitely one of my favourite films.
515;Anyway, this film manages to say so very much by doing so very little, which is a very difficult thing to do and is only to be found with the most talented artists.
516;As impressive as The Virgin Suicides was, this is better by a very great margin.
517;the greatness of the film is boosted by the fact that it shows how great American cinema can be when it is not pandering to the mass market, the lowest common denominator or whatever else holds all the dollars.
518;for.you syndrome and leaves us to use our imaginations.
519;Lost in Translation is simply one of the finest films ever made, and the critical mauling it gets here from certain people tells me how far ahead it is of mainstream comprehension.
520;Murray is best when he is cut loose and zany.
521;The emotional space explored in the film is mostly confusion and sulking, which I guess make it a perfect woman's film.
522;if you thought this movie lacked substance, a good substitute might be Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises, another story about confused white people in a foreign country, but this one is a classic and a great read.
523;But that's only my opinion, someone may find it more appealing than I did.
524;After reading all of the rave reviews by the critics and the accolades of others who had seen this movie, I though that I was in for a real treat.
525;This movie's director won the Oscar for best screenplay.
526;Characters are rearranged, subplots eliminated, but the basic themes, settings, characters, and relationships are identical.
527;murakami is one of the foremost Japanese authors of our time.
528;The Oscar should be returned.
529;He proves his virility by a drunken romp in the sack with a redhead that he meets in a bar.
530;She did a wonderful job with both the script and directing.
531;This film is visually stunning.
532;Third, both Murray and Johansson give fantastic performances.
533;They manage to be very funny, compassionate, human, and supremely interesting in their roles.
534;Finally, this film gives such a compelling look at Japan, it inspired me to book a vacation to Tokyo.
535;if you are looking to be entertained, amused, informed, touched, and inspired.
536;This cinematic treat from Sofia Coppola is an art house film in the best sense of that tradition, and is so clearly not for everyone that I just don't understand why the Terminator crowd even bother with it.
537;But these are the film's very strengths, and the furthest things from weaknesses.
538;this film is about imperfectly real people, and portrays them with a depth and authenticity that Hollywood rarely strives for, much less achieves.
539;She is counting on us to be both receptive and contemplative.
540;dot story, you had best stick with Titanic.
541;This film respects that process by mirroring the journey of its characters in like terms.
542;For the music video crowd, this is just dead air
543;It takes a special film to make a viewer so sympathetic to the characters that we step into their skins, and Lost in Translation delivers with a sincerity that is rare and heartfelt.
544;Among mass entertainment that assumes its spectators to be morons, this film's quiet eloquence and regard for its audience is as air to a drowning man.
545;Sophia Coppola deserves every ounce of credit she gets for making this fascinating yet simple masterpiece.
546;This is great from top to bottom.
547;The location is a great metaphor for the state of the two character's lives and that they intersect here and how much they need each other in this one moment in time is really beautiful.
548;There's more sensuality and passion in their brief, unconsumated relationship than the most fiery affairs and when he last sees her, the look on her face will be seared in my memory forever.
549;You come to care about these people so much because they speak with such simple purity of what's in all of us .
550;this is one great movie.
551;Outstanding acting and masterful storytelling.
552;I enjoyed the journey of these two lost souls finding company and comfort with each other as strangers in a strange land .
553;This was a perfect transaction and I was very happy with this seller.
554;It was well packed and just a wonderful over all experiance.
555;as for the Movie it was bought as a gift for my 19 year old Granddaughter.
556;She had seen the Movie and told me she loved the story behind it.
557;And the filming of it and wanted to own it.
558;So I found it with this seller to surprise her.
559;she was thrilled to receive it and has told me that we will have to watch it together so I am looking forward to that.
560;However, unless you've been under a rock you've heard all the hype: Oscar nods for leads Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, and Writer/Director Sofia Coppola (who won the Oscar for best original screenplay).
561;The Good: Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray are fun to watch together.
562;Coppola really does a good job handling the real star of the film: TOKYO!
563;Murray and Johansson partake in a feww experiences truly unique to Tokyo and Coppola, who is on record as having spent A LOT of time there, captures it beautifully.
564;coppola gives Tokyo a feel of wonderment and warmth while maintaining the uneasiness any Westerner feels when they first visit Tokyo.
565;I'd love to hear some of Coppola's real life stories from her time in Tokyo as well as any similar experiences Murray and Johansson might've had in Japan with their characters.
566;for anyone who has traveled internationally, you will identify with it immeidately!The wit is dry and provincial twits won't get it, but it is one of the funniest movies of the decade.
567;Instead, this quiet film relies on beautiful cinematography (not special effects) and the actors' ability to communicate with out speaking, to create a story.
568;it gives a sense of place, and a visual depiction of the isolation someone can feel, even when they're surrounded by people.
569;It's much better than that.
570;And for your information, I love Caddy Shack, Stripes, and Rushmore, but this is Bill Murray's absolute finest performance.
571;In any other year, he would have won the Oscar.
572;Lost In Translation, the second feature film from Sofia Coppola (The Virgin Suicides), is an amazing motion picture about life's little chance happenings.
573;charlotte (the fantastic Scarlett Johannsen) is in Japan because her get.
574;She stays at the same hotel that Bob does.
575;They immediatly see much of what they have in common.
576;bill Murray is at his best here in this movie.
577;Even better than his surprising turn in Rushmore!
578;His Oscar nomination was well deserved.
579;She has stunning good looks, and she perfectly fits into the character she plays.
580;the cinematography is very dream.
581;You deeply care about the characters by the time the film ends, and you want to know what happens to them.
582;It's a very thought provoking piece of cinema.
583;sofia Coppola should be commended for making this film, and she was totally deserving of the Oscar for Best Screenplay (which she won).
584;I like Bill Murray but this film is way overrated for it's own good.
585;Our Princess is also written to have a degree in philosophy and a penchant for knitting .
586;The soundtrack wins, giving the audience the moral permission to laugh without feeling boorish.
587;bill Murray is outstanding, nonetheless.
588;I am a huge fan of Bill, and think he is funny in everything he does, but even he couldn't help me get through one of the most boring movies EVER.
589;There was so much potential for a great show: Bill in Japan, not understanding a word being said to him.
590;And for some reason, you're able to talk with this stranger.
591;And they talk to you like they know what you're going through and where you're going with it.
592;fate reminds you that you're not alone, and fate reminds you of the sort of wonderful person you really are, outside of all the day.
593;Their friendship provides them with solace, with enchanted moments.
594;Their chats give them both the strength and the tools to deal with their real lives.
595;She's in the process of discovering her identity.
596;this film is completely charming and very mature, having its characters understand and explore some fundamental aspects of human nature and identity.
597;The film is also very funny, exploring a clash of cultures and examining the weirdness of how you can sometimes get to the heart of who you are when you're away from everything you're familiar with.
598;the acting, particularly from the leads, is excellent.
599;Scarlett Johansson's character is so fully realized that you want to hug her, and Bill Murray gives the best performance of his career.
600;The film is beautiful to look at.
601;The story's wonderful and smart, and the script is amusing yet serious.
602;lOST IN TRANSLATION helps you feel better about yourself.
603;That's a lot of movies, well over 3,000, but I still love them even though we do go through periods when everything that comes to the movie.
604;Last year was a good year.
605;One of the best in the past decade.
606;And Lost in Translation was one of the best movies.
607;(I also thought Big Fish was brilliant and Tim Burton's best movie so far.)
608;But then it is always cheaper to make a film about people than about special effects.
609;I love this one because it had characters and I could care about them.
610;An unforgettable trip to Tokyo in the company of two people who you really hope will find a little happiness in this world.
611;While the praise and Oscar nods may have raised my expectations, I found this movie to be average and insubstantial, but with good performances that elevate it from the status of a fluff piece.
612;bill Murray plays perhaps his best performance as Bob Harris, a middle.
613;They story is very simple, how two people in a strange environment can find each other.
614;bill Murray is the main attraction here, taking a lead from other comedic actors who are making a switch to more dramatic roles in their autumn years.
615;He is really good here, playing a more subdued role, while still maintaining a dry sense of humor.
616;The script by Sofia Coppola is well devised, but in a year with so many other great movies, I find it hard to accept that this was the best screenplay.
617;The interview with Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray is well done, and you get an appreciation for the passion they put into this movie.
618;Lost in Translation works are a decent character drama, but not a great one.
619;It is good, but nothing special.
620;beautiful views of the city.
621;b/c i was assured by the world that i would like it.
622;still waiting for the scene where i come to love this movie, that defining moment when i identify and empathize with the screenwriter, the characters, the city.
623;A beautiful romantic comedy but not in the normal sense.
624;It's hilarious at times and sad at times.
625;Bill Murray should win an Academy Award for his amazing understated, brilliant acting performance.
626;He's also very funny at times.
627;This film is an incredible achievement for the director/writer.
628;It's a deep, meaningful movie.
629;After the Oscar and the pubblicity I was expecting a 'fantastic' movie.
630;Somewhere I'd heard it compared favorably to one of my favorite movies.
631;It was more interesting as a travel piece featuring urban Japan rather than a romance.
632;I love the understatedness of this story about what makes a life successful.
633;The director allows the story to develop naturally and tell itself.
634;The ending is sweet and unexpected.
635;I give it a 2 because I like Bill Murray.
636;Lost in Translation is a dramatic and realistic take on loneliness and the brief yet powerful connections we can make in unexpected moments of our lives.
637;This is a very SUBTLE film, and requires the utmost attention and respect when viewing.
638;if you can give it that respect and investment, you will walk away completely rewarded and satisfied, as this is true movie making of the highest order.
639;The emotions, the colors, the cinematography, the moody music, the ebb and flow vibe of the film itself.
640;And finally, the comedy: yes, there is comedy, and it is funny, but please be forewarned that it takes a second seat to the characters and the atmosphere.
641;The ideal way to view a film as subtle and atmospheric as this is to watch it with someone you care about or with people whom you know are patient enough to make the investment.
642;which is a really good thing.
643;And, of course the Time's Square type area.
644;Watch the movie then go to Tokyo!
645;And aside from the comedy, the acting is the best I've ever seen!
646;Bill Murray is at the top of his game in this film.
647;Another thing I like about it is the wacky romance between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.
648;Bill Murray as an aging movie star is humorously brilliant.
649;The story makes an excellent metaphor for life.
650;I've seen it several times and still love it.
651;If you can appreciate something quiet, cerebral, contemplative and introspective, you may love it also.
652;It is also quite funny at times and has a great soundtrack.
653;been actor who feels more loved in Japan than in his native land.
654;So far, so good, right?
655;There's nothing like a great artsy movie.
656;This is nothing like a great artsy movie.
657;Although it's nice to see good scenery and hear a Japanese kareoke version of God Save The Queen (Sex Pistols version, mind you), nothing else that blocks the camera here is worthy of my time.
658;The performances everyone talks about.
659;I found it hard to find redeeming qualities here.
660;At least Wong Kar Wai's movies are beautiful to look at and have great soundtracks.
661;If you don't believe me, please watch it.
662;I find it to be one of Bill Murrays best ever, and his absolute best recently.
663;It has come to my attention that my PS2 will play this movie in widescreen format.
664;All right, so some of you out there may be able to watch this movie in glorious letterbox, but at the very least be wary.
665;The critics gave two thumbs up, and the box descreibes as hilarious, but I think plot would have been helpful.
666;Oh well, the background shots of Tokyo are interesting, and almost make up for the nihilism, but a travelogue would have worked just as well.
667;The young actress Johannsen is certainly easy on the eyes.
668;Watch it for yourself, give it a chance to impress you.
669;Watch it once for the movie itself and the characters, then watch it again for the beauty.
670;I loved the music choices for the scenes.
671;(I would love to know what he whispered in her ear.)
672;These characters love each other in an outside the box way, and you know when they part at the end they are never going to see each other again.
673;It's rather fascinating how others can see how this a classic portray between two people.
674;I see it as two people who find each other and that's it.
675;Lost In Translation is probably one of my favorite movies ever, the cinematography captured Japan so beautifully.
676;This movie deserves every acclaim that it has received.
677;This is a movie about how hard it is to ever really connect with people, beause communication is difficult if not impossible.
678;Ms. Coppola knows what she is doing and executes her theme well.
679;Connection is a miracle
680;The final moment of the movie is one character whispering something to the other
681;I think this movie does a great job of capturing the theme of misery loves company.
682;Murray is fantastic in this dramatic role, and should have won an Oscar.
683;Easily my favourite film of the year .
684;travel is captured to perfection in this.
685;There are too many lovely moments and gorgeous touches to recount in this clever, astute and observant film.
686;The whole cast is superb, but Bill Murray still manages to steal the film.
687;It's his best since Groundhog Day and may he please make many more.
688;perfect movie well worth owning as it is worth re.
689;This family controlls business and there are many in the family.
690;Essentially that is the plot of Lost in Translation and if you've ever had that kind of experience more than likely you will come away touched by this beautifully moving, emotionally touching film.
691;When the final frame concluded, I found myself sobbing in my chair.
692;murray is fantastic and subtle, Johansson is a breath of fresh air, Coppola's direction and cinematography is superb and the soundtrack is flawless.
693;Although definitely Oscar worthy on all counts, I think the media hype hurt rather than helped the film.
694;See this film ONLY if you meant to see it before it got all the media recognition.
695;The moment of reciprocal appreciation between two beings.
696;simplicity is the key in this contemplative motion picture, wrongly advertised as a comedy (neither is it a 'modern day Lolita).
697;he is flabbergasted by it.
698;As genuine as Copolla's sensible, minimalist approach is, their attraction cannot be described as sexual.
699;it's candidly longing, and hence the age difference is neglected.
700;but we confront and go along with the movie, because it efficiently discovers a tone that swathes us.
701;you will fall in love with the marvelous Murray, gorgeous Johannson and candor of this simple yet tremendously heartwarming, truly magical film.
702;As one might reasonably surmise, due to the excessively positive reception of this film (in terms of aesthetic cinematography and acumen of craft) I was somewhat piqued to see it for myself.
703;check, check, check, everything seems to be in order.
704;Try Monster or American Splendor, two wonderful films forgotten by the burgeoning circle jerk of American critics.
705;we are traduced into believing a character could delve beyond their static veneer and actually articulate a genuine emotion or two.
706;As he sang What's so funny about peace, love, and understanding I began to feel even more molested by my viewing experience.
707;It seems that brief sequence is comparable to the film in its entirety.
708;That one scene (coupled with the karaoke singing) provides explanation for the entire summarization of the movie.
709;I have always loved Bill Murray but this is by far not only his best acting but also the best acting of the year.
710;The storyline is beautiful and the cinematography is great.
711;This movie is the best, but i understand why some people don't like it.
712;I normally don't write review about movies, but this one has got me so upset.
713;In fact, to me it is more like making fun of the Japanese culture and the Japanese people.
714;No doubt, this movie is the defining accomplishment of Bill Murrary's long career.
715;Scarlet Johansson gives another fantastic performance (as in Girl with the Pearl Earing).
716;What's more, their chemistry on screen is the best I've seen this year.
717;Certainly these are some of the tasty ingredients needed to cook up a great film, but as Sophia Coppola will learn in what figures to be a long and decorated directing career, you need something more.
718;This is my main problem with the film among others, but I did rate the movie a three which, in my book, means it was good, not great, and not quite worthy of an Oscar (sorry Miss Copola).
719;Like I said, the chemistry is definatley there, and that in itself makes the movie quite an enjoyable experience.
720;Although this film fails to really get off the ground in terms of the plot (or lack thereof) and leaves much to be desired , it succeeds in capturing the beautiful simplicity of needing someone .
721;He has gone from making feature films in the 70's to starring in a campaign add for liquor in Tokyo.
722;Bill Murray puts on a oscar winning performance and Scarlett Johansson lights up the screen with her supberb acting and her beautiful face and smile.
723;This is one of those films you will either really love or really hate, i happened to think it was one of the best made and most tear inducing films i have seen in my 21 years.
724;it is a unbeleivably well made and beautiful film, the city of tokyo is beathtaking and you truly feel that these characters are in a foreign land.
725;Lost in Translation is one of the most beautiful films that you will ever see.
726;It's refreshingly understated and subtle in an era of in.your.
727;The atmosphere is enlightening and the direction is tight, Sofia Coppola is very impressive.
728;Bill Murray is perfect, and is equally matched by Scarlett Johansson.
729;The premise of a film is to tell a story or entertain the viewer.
730;Sorry to have to be the one to break the news to you!
731;Ditto for Scarlett Johansson
732;The photography is beautiful and the movie just glides along to an ending that you get to finish in your own mind .
733;it takes courage in this bash.
734;it's best to just watch and feel.
735;Life itself is a random sequence of joys and sadnesses
736;There are a lot of options.
737;I do know, however, that this is a exceptional movie that, in a very stylish way, holds a mirror up in front of us.
738;Highly recomended as a break from fantasyland with a couple of characters you'll like and root for.
739;a fascinating and sometimes annoying journey into the lives of two characters who, I believe, probably never would have met in real life.
740;the film is really carried by the depth of the two main characters and the gradually appealing and whimsical nature of their pseudo.
741;i cannot help but think that Coppola has taken the nepotism pays motif to such an all.
742;fest can easily be summed up into one word.
743;Kudos to director Sofia Coppola for this wonderfully intelligent, mature and heartfelt film.
744;A bittersweet but perfect ending where each ultimately makes the right choice.
745;Sophia Coppola has done it again and made a very enjoyable and physically appealing movie.
746;Although there is very little plot the movie works because of the actors, music, and scenery.
747;Bill Murray is wonderful and maybe will finally get the attention for being the fine actor he is.
748;Scarlette is stungingly beautiful and always plays her parts so well.
749;She never over acts and no just how to light the screen up with her bright smile.
750;The movie is an enjoyable treat and worth ever bit of the $9 or so to see it.
751;My test of a great movie is one that has me thinking about it for days afterward.
752;Murray has the uncanny ability to be both funny and tragic.
753;we see this movie through the lens of Bob.
754;lag/insomnia) she eventually connects with Bob Harris.
755;Charlotte, young as she is, finds herself in the same dilemma.
756;She finds comfort and kinship with Bob.
757;the best of all story devices.
758;A man and a woman, though decades apart in age, find kinship.
759;and a form of love.
760;Coppolla does an excellent job of creating a world of high strangeness and sublime beauty that will escape many.
761;I happened to thoroughly enjoy this film.
762;This movie touches real emotion and is wonderfully done.
763;Hopefully Coppola's Oscar will influence more movies like this to be made.
764;I decided to hit the town.
765;Contrasting dilemmas: Moving toward the end .
766;The backdrop of Tokyo serves as the negativity amplifier in that it forces their dilemmas to surface faster than normal and with intensity.
767;Both Murray and Johansson play their respective character with aplomb, especially Murray who while stoic at times, relies on subtle gestures to give life to his character.
768;For one who is used to seeing him only in comedies, it was refreshing and perhaps indicates that he has more potential than we ever thought.
769;In that sense, the images of Japan and the Japanese are appropriate.
770;wise from Coppola who so effectively used tones and colors in the Virgin Suicides.
771;Though entertaining, I do question what the hype is all about.
772;like many of you, I'm sure.
773;I was expecting clever dialogue
774;average acting from the magnetic, charasmatic Scarlett Johansson and dry humored Bill Murray
775;The goal of this film was for Sophia Coppola to show us her hip.
776;the cinematography was done very well, I think.
777;The filters used made downtown Tokyo seem so clear, vibrant and beautiful .
778;The director wielded the cameras with relative precision, not eluding to .
779;it is so nice to be surprised by a film which you'd heard all the buzz about, and turns out to be enlightening, alive and brilliant .
780;and I suppose some people fine the attraction between Bill and Scarlet a tad unbelievable, but I found this film to be just the right thing to watch, basically whenever I want!I ain't gonna give out any secrets, but the ending is just perfect and so touching that it really makes the film!
781;Funny thing is that I don't even think that scene was in the original script!Also, the whole sequence in Kioto is spot on.
782;First, let me say I loved the movie of Lost in Translation.
783;All you can do is do a forward scan.
784;Each time you play it!
785;I am just saying, if you want to watch this movie and enjoy it, just kick back and soak it in.
786;Just enjoy it forwhat it is.
787;(To show you how far out Hollywood is, this movie won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.)
788;This is kind of movie that you yawn during it, but can't live without after you finish the journey.
789;That's what touched me, how real it was.
790;in recognising that idea, I was able to feel a realistic connection to these lost souls, much more so than the characters in a typical melodrama or action adventure.
791;so, if you can appreciate the idiosyncrasies of life and the humor within all that is around you, you will probably enjoy this unique glimpse into these character's lives.
792;This is my favorite movie of 2003.
793;For one thing, I like how it promotes Bill Murray as an actor, because he's so important to some of my favorite films like Groundhog Day and Wes Anderson's movies.
794;Like The Virgin Suicides, LiT is quiet, spacy, and subtlely beautiful.
795;As a whole, the film is beautifully shot and acted, and captures the chaotic order of Tokyo perfectly.
796;It's more of an atmospheric film which focuses on inner conflicts and the way those conflicts bring two people together.
797;An American melodrama set in East Asia.
798;Funny boy and sweet girl lingering around and away from Home, hoping to find a spark in a generational romance.
799;traditional story with comedy and budding juxtaposition.
800;This film is a perfect example of how so. called experts and industry buzz can brainwash the movie going audience into thinking some methodically dull film is some brilliant piece of art.
801;one thing I will admit though is that the acting was very good.
802;admittedly, this all comes from someone who's favorite movies of the year were Return of the King and Kill Bill vol.
803;And the answers came back pretty much what every positive reviewer on here has said: The finding of good company even in a strange world, The solace one finds in another in loneliness, The charm and beauty in the subtleties of a non.
804;the subtlety of the relationship between the two characters may be charming to watch (thanks mainly to Bill Murray's presence and the tension provided by our curiosity to see if they will do anything more than talk to each other), but the characters are never realistically fleshed out.
805;And I'm going to venture to guess that most of the people who saw the movie got it.
806;The reviews that many of those lathering praises upon praises on this movie echoed my guesses.
807;The soliloquy in the end echoed a few things in the middle of the movie, giving those moments greater significance.
808;Yes, random things seemed to happen, but in the end, everything came together, and we go away with a poignant revelation of the beauty of all occurences, good or bad.
809;After all, the American identity is represented by the two superior characters in the film (who happen to be white).
810;In the end, it is.
811;It is beside the point that Sofia Coppola's father is legendary and influential director Francis Ford Coppola.
812;The point is easily comprehensible.
813;And that kind of humor might have worked the first time we heard it.
814;It helps if you have some interest in Japanese culture, and there is one achingly beautiful scene involving a wedding party in the gardens of Kyoto, as if, in the middle of alienation and commercialism, there might be found a moment of true peace and serenity.
815;Yet for some odd reason this film has an ineffable, lingering emotional impact.
816;I've seen this twice and each time felt transported to Japan, or at least wanted to go there after seeing the movie.
817;The acting is good, one of Scarjo's first films and who doesn't love Bill Murray?
818;I just love this movie, it means a lot for me.
819;This was for a gift for a friend, and he loved it too :D
820;I want to make fun of Japanese people and feature main characters that are so obnoxiously spoiled and self obsorbed, I could relate to them!
821;And I want an Oscar for screenwriting an improvised movie.
822;The film is a terrific and beautiful one and I can only agree with the more profound thinkers and eloquent writers here in expressing my admiration for Sofia Coppola, Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johanssen.
823;The cinematography is captivating and the dialogue (at only 41 minutes of a two hour film) makes you listen because of its brevity and profundity.
824;This film also has what I consider, truly, one of the most touching and sincere endings I can ever imagine in a film.
825;It will make you smile in appreciation of the gift you have received in watching this movie.
826;I have seen this echoed elsewhere, but it is worth repeating.
827;a tremendous film in a lousy package.
828;I have been reading the reviews with great amusement.
829;The characters are very well developed, and very loveable and that makes them seem very real.
830;to me, they don`t make japanese seem very well, but it is in a funny way, I`d like to listen a Japanese opinion about it, to see if im right.
831;anyway, I recommend it a lot.
832;Coppola's work as a screenwriter is impeccable here, and I hope this spring will see an Academy Award for Lost in Translation's original screenplay.
833;The chemistry between the two leads is incredible, and, while all reviewers have said this, I will only repeat, this is the role of Bill Murray's career, and his alternating humor, vulnerability, pathos, and playfulness create a tour de force performance.
834;I found this to be such a lovely, quiet movie .
835;and with wit and itelligence.
836;married, lonely and finding weird harmless fun together, which is the best kind.
837;The movie flowed beautifully, and all I can seem to think is that it truly is a piece of art.
838;it feels to me as though the subtly of the film makes it a greater accomplishment than many of the movies that I have seen in years.
839;The intricacy of the relationship is what makes the movie so wonderful.
840;To digress from the normal Hollywood theme of Young Beautiful Woman/Young Beautiful Man is refreshing and well worth the cost of the ticket.
841;not exciting, riviting or moving, but pleasant.
842;dog face work in so many movies.
843;Scarlett Johannson was very good and you did feel for the loneliness of her character.
844;He is famous, he is fawned on by well.
845;What does he need to find a more meaningful existence, for more self.
846;This movie portrays a slice of life, that is perhaps more genuine than so many other attempts.
847;it wasn't great and it wasn't horrible so rated it okay!
848;Lost in Translation is director Sofia Coppola's remarkable study of the isolation and intimacy that people experience in both emotional and geographical environments.
849;But soon their friendship develops into a deeper sense of understanding and intimacy, and with this come new complications.
850;Instead, Coppola shapes their story with impressive ease and with an extraordinary understanding of the human soul.
851;culture energy, the film never condemns or makes fun of that place.
852;while Lost in Translation explores some very serious themes it remains a hilarious and low.
853;I have to agree with critics or reviewers who state that this is the best role of Bill Murray's career.
854;Johansson also delivers an extremely skilled and subtle performance.
855;There are also many extraordinarily funny scenes in which Bob and Charlotte find themselves interacting with people or in situations that they don't understand.
856;it's simply too honest to do that.
857;i highly recommend this film for its humor, its insight, and for the remarkable performances from Bill Murray, Scarlet Johansson, and the city of Tokyo.
858;Coppola should be highly commended for her creative genius as a director and as a screenwriter.
859;As a Director Sofia Coppola is willing to go that extra mile.
860;She flew to Japan to begin filming, and still she hadn't heard back from Murray.
861;Japan is an interesting backdrop, but I think the movie is really about Bob and Charlotte.
862;You take two famous directors with daughters, both trying to break into Hollywood as directors, and it is perfectly understandable that you might get them mixed up.
863;I'll go pack my stuff.
864;bob: I hope that you've had enough to drink.
865;It's going to take courage.
866;Bob Harris is brilliantly played by Bill Murray, and Bob's interactions with Charlotte/Scarlett are sublime.
867;Every detail of his character rang true.
868;Murray played well not only with Johansson, but his constant befuddlement with the strange Japanese environment was quite entertaining.
869;Anna Faris as Kelly was a brilliant caricature of Cameron Diaz.
870;Kelly is ignorant and proud of her ignorance.
871;Charlotte is bothered by people like Kelly because Charlotte is smart, but she has yet to figure out what to do with her intelligence.
872;the Bottom Line is that Sofia Coppola managed to direct a wonderful film, drawing on her own experience, but translating it into terms we all could understand.
873;She told her story, and it was not Lost in Translation.
874;john: Oh, come on, she's nice.
875;This is a great film about not quite fitting in (being lost if you will) but above all, it is about a great, if only too brief, friendship.
876;Most movies, whenever featuring a man/woman relationship, make it something hot and steamy.
877;I love this film because it is about two people who make each other happy by just being together and not in a sexual way.
878;It's got her name attached and so people think it must be great.
879;They connect immediately, which makes sense, because they have a lot in common.
880;despite outwardly wonderful lives .
881;One of the things I love about this film is that it handles the characters' contemplativeness very gently.
882;Take the scene where Charlotte is talking on the telephone to a friend (this is one of the most poignant moments in the film).
883;while Bob and Charlotte are not able to provide answers for one another, they are able to enjoy an emotional relationship.
884;The cinematography is stunning, and a lot of fabulous, dreamy music is used in the soundtrack (My Bloody Valentine complements the film's tone perfectly).
885;For instance, when Charlotte and her husband bump into a young actress in the hotel lobby, it is rather amusing to contrast Charlotte's calm, cool, and sharp personality with that of the ridiculously bubbly chatterbox.
886;I would also add that this film's final scene makes for one of the most perfect and simple endings I have ever come across (I am reminded of the PJ Harvey song You Said Something).
887;moving film, if you enjoy intelligent characters, and if you are attracted to stunning images, you may very well like this film.
888;caliber role, then go see him as Ernie Big Ern McCracken in Kingpin.
889;He just gets funnier and funnier the more you see it!
890;This movie was one of the best that I hae seen for a while.
891;It is a little slow, but it keeps your attention because you begin to love the characters.
892;There is great acting, and the storyline is excellent.
893;This one is actually original.
894;Lost in Translation is a very good film.
895;The Tokyo setting is stunning, and the music (i. e., My Bloody Valentine) perfectly compliments the neon cityscape.
896;Wow, that gorgeous head of redhair.
897;a metaphor for the world we live in.
898;The male protagonist: urbane, funny and accomplished, but at a lonely stage in his life, where he feels impotent and unimportant.
899;The female protagonist: bright but just starting her adult live, in a marriage which cannot work.
900;The depth of feeling as portayed in the script and by the actors is stunning.
901;I immersed myself in this movie in wonder.
902;This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
903;Then I thought of all the genuinely hot girls offering themselves to me in my college classes, and I changed my mind.
904;the emotions are there in the movie
905;It is also fun with language.
906;lost in Translation is an excellent film that is beautiful, haunting, extremely well made, with excellent performances.
907;the fact that Lost in Translation can make money also proves the opposite is true.
908;That you can believe in the intelligence and insight of enough of the public (maybe .
909;This story of an actor perhaps a little past his prime, and a young woman who is realising her marriage and life are going nowhere, is a film of rare insight and delicacy.
910;It's beautifully judged, and walks a knife.
911;edge where the relationship of these two adrift individuals in Tokyo is concerned.
912;The fact that it doesn't is a superb reflection on Miss Coppola's abilities as a director.
913;there was a time when Hollywood made many intelligent and subtle films like this and huge audiences .
914;One wonders what has happened when doing so causes so much outrage in the modern world.
915;I have seen this moving many times, and each time I discover new elements.
916;They are both highly intelligent, and I believe they truly appreciate the beauty of the Japanese culture, however, they feel bewildered that it does not seem to affect them in any meaningful way.
917;When they meet, they form an unexpected bond, which basically is the entire movie.
918;All these elements are subtly and fabulously woven into the performances by Murray and Johannson.
919;Very subtle, but very powerful.
920;Their embrace is so touching, and I LOVE the fact that we can't understand what he whispers to her.
921;I really think that this is one of those movies that you really just love, or don't.
922;I happen to love it!
923;Now that I have seen it, the hoopla surrounding this movie is quite interesting.
924;And that is always the true test of a great film.
925;but not for nothing, at least try to enjoy two of the years best performances on film.
926;Young Scarlett deserves just as much attention as Bill does.
927;Her pitch was perfect all throughout, just the way I would have wanted it if I were the director.
928;And I for one thought the ending was just right.
929;I would have been tempted to go for a more sentimental conclusion, but this one is very moving nonetheless.
930;another reason why I liked this movie so much is because it sort of reminds me of my favorite film, Midnight Cowboy .
931;This is truly a work of art.
932;Even though it seems a little quirky, I like quirky.
933;All of the other reviewers that gave this gem of a movie a one or two star rating.
934;this is a movie that makes you use your mind for a change, but in a very subtle way.
935;Beautifully directed, photographed and acted.
936;Just deep characters living realistic lives.
937;The outcome in the end is that you feel for the characters, you feel their lonliness and this is what makes the movie good.
938;Murray and Johansson are excellent (as always) and it's worth seeing just for Murray's comedic performance.
939;And I love the way how it introduced Japanese culture (my husband and I have visited Japan for a few times and that's how exactly we feel about this country).
940;2003's so. called best of film Lost In Translation left me and a majority of its viewers confused and, well, lost.
941;This is my first, and hopefully last, movie review ever, and it's written as more of a warning than anything else.
942;enlightenment, humor, emotion, acting, etc., etc.
943;Characters, their interaction, their personal problems, yeah, well conceived, but.
944;It has an interesting cast great reveiws and coupled with what should be an absorbing plot this seems like a no brainer.
945;the movie begins with promise there are a few rather humorous scenes in regards to the culture but that is it.
946;I had to watch this film a few times to understand it but for most people this is a slow film but for me, its watching one of my favorite actors at his best.
947;Either way this is a film about the understanding of one culture to another.
948;With shots done well of the Japanese structures and landscapes, it made this film so serene that I felt at peace when I was watching Scarlett Johannson skipping on the stones in a lake.
949;There were actors that were viewed to come so close to winning an Oscar it surprised the critics who thought they would win.
950;From the opening scene this movie gripped me with it's extraordinary attention to cinematic detail.
951;Truly great movies seem know their great, they take their time in setting the dramatic stage allowing you to be there by not innundating you with dialogue all the time.
952;the storyline, the characters, the music, all felt perfect.
953;The relationship of the two main characters is deep.
954;I really liked the visual imagery of this film.
955;I watched it a second time and enjoyed it much more the second time around.
956;I absolutely loved this film.
957;It's so raw, yet it feels like a velvet dream.
958;The commercial and photo shoot scenes are hilarious, and it's very entertaining to watch Bob Harris cope with jet lag.
959;It's so soft and surreal that it fades from your memory, no matter how hard you try to hang on to it, like some wonderful dream.
960;Bob, experiencing a midlife crisis, finds company with Charlotte, who is experiencing her own uncertainties the future of her marriage and her ability to establish a career.
961;Together they survive their week among an alien culture with an immense language barrier.
962;provoking, and that certainly makes it stand out among Hollywood productions of these times.
963;And certainly, regardless of its occasional depiction of Tokyo dwellers as weird, the film does inspire a great desire to visit Japan and see it for oneself.
964;The visuals of LOST IN TRANSLATION are occasionally so lovely that they leave the plot behind.
965;the film is also has Bill Murray's best performance of his post.
966;Here this air of being total disinterested in his surroundings is tempered by a warm humanity.
967;Johansson's acting, on the other hand, may be the film's weakest aspect.
968;The characters are so real and the story almost feels as if you were there with the two on their trip.
969;Everything feels so natural and immersive, highly recommended
970;By the end of the movie I found myself comfortably surprised, delighted at the quiet story of two lost souls who find themselves in a place that feels altogether alien.
971;which in itself is the mark of a truly great film.
972;From Bill Murry and Scarlett Johansson's profound characterization to Sofia Coppla's visionary style this is definitely one of the must.
973;I'll give this one two stars.
974;I absolutely adore this film.
975;really a beautiful film, and astonishing to note that it took just under 4 weeks to film.
976;Sophia Coppola really displayed an amazing effort, directing, writing, and I believe producing the film.
977;Hey, I'm a nice man, maybe I can sneak it into my top 3.
978;One of the few films of 2003 that will leave you with a smile.
979;What a great idea for a movie .
980;a little quirky, but normal enough to hit close to home, at least for those of us who have ended up in a strange place and wondered about the larger things in life.
981;The cast does a fantastic job .
982;I've loved Bill Murray's 'serious' roles, and the reviews had me at high anticipation.
983;I refer to it as a Chinese Dinner Film: I know I've been to a film.
984;Bill Murray is typical Bill Murray, and Johansen is deft.
985;As good as the movie is, it almost feels like a fluke that Lost in Translation found so much success.
986;The main characters, played by Scarlett Johansson and the recently Oscar nominated Bill Murray, are sympathetic but cold to everyone except each other, and they're both moping around a mighty fine five.
987;pleaser, is a subtle modern classic.
988;director Sofia Coppola
989;esque performance by Murray .
990;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are great as the two lonely people trying to connect with themselves and the outside world, and we, the viewer are taking though this journey with them and are intrigued with their misadventures together.
991;it worth the word of mouth that it's getting, and I hope Bill Murray gets the Oscar because he is that good in it.
992;Bill Murray turns in his strongest performance as Bob Harris, a once.
993;He gets more praise and respect from the people in Japan.
994;When he first arrives at the hotel in Tokyo, he is greeted and treated by some of the strangest and often hilarious characters as you'll see.
995;At first, it simply seems like a harmless, strong friendship, but in reality, both know that it is a beautiful affair relationship as Bob has his wife and kids at home, and Charlotte has her husband taking photos every day.
996;The sad thing is, is that they both know that the relationship which has become so close and real, will never last and that eventually Bob will have to leave.
997;sofia Coppola's masterful direction and the beautiful atmosphere create an overall atmospheric and well.
998;crafted tale of love and curiosity of the unknown.
999;The entire story is touching and heartwarming, filled with hilarious moments along the way.
1000;The connection between Murray and Johanssan is pure magical and the two of them seem meant to be.
1001;The difference between ages of the two makes it even more a touching film as Charlotte seeks out love, kindness and attention from Bob and he seeks out the same thing from her.
1002;The music is another excellent thing about this film, as it adds the modern touch to the images captured from this modern city of Tokyo, Japan.
1003;Some of the music is rock and roll which we are all familiar with which adds a sense of familiarity to the characters in the story.
1004;The visuals are pretty good and I liked watching all the beautiful sights and hearing the sounds of Japan street life, but it was not enough to carry the whole movie.
1005;This is a charming and subtle tale of a twenty something woman and a middle.
1006;One of the funniest scenes in the picture is his two.
1007;This is run of the mill slapstick humour at its best, pulled off in that familiar Murray style, which even now, when I think of it, brings tears to my eyes.
1008;In fact, this really is the only piece of slapstick in the entire film, because what makes this picture special is the subtle dialogue between the two main characters.
1009;There's no over acting in this film, but an understated realism and tasteful honesty, which to my mind, should bring a few industry awards to first time director, Sofia Coppola.
1010;He is one of the world's most funny comedians, with his own unique signature, and has finally reached a point in his craft, where doing a `serious' role will not upset his many fans.
1011;In the role of John Harris, the character demanded a particular charm, sophistication and worldliness along with an attitude of self.
1012;deprecating humour, which Murrey captured brilliantly, revealing a man at the top of his form.
1013;Scarlett Johansson also commanded a fine performance as the lonely and abandoned, Charlotte .
1014;She managed to connect with Murrey and display a maturity of character that could not have been done any better.
1015;this is an enchanting piece of filmmaking about two normal people, lonely and in a strange country, who in any other circumstance, would more than likely not take a second glance at one another, but cross paths and discover and form a connection, and perhaps, something a lot more.
1016;I thought Lost in Translation was a subtle, charming movie that flowed easily from light.
1017;weight smiles to something approaching a mature understanding of people and relationships.
1018;except for the comedy, everything else pretty much comes from reading between the lines, taking the clues about the two people's lives and letting your imagination (and your own experiences) fill in the rest.
1019;The movie also is both funny and sad.
1020;It helps if the person has had some experience with loneliness as well as happiness.
1021;At least it was good natured, as far as condescension can be.
1022;but it was a sweet movie and, in my view, Murray was robbed at the Academy Awards.
1023;This beautiful masterpiece of understatement, and hope has left an immense impression on me.
1024;Vividly honest and fresh with a genuine sentimentality, Sofia Coppola weaves the lives of Murray and Johannsen together in an unforgettable and compelling tale of loneliness, love, and commitment.
1025;crossed lovers, islanded by their strength of character that keeps them apart, nevertheless find a happiness with each other that validates and gives meaning to their world.
1026;It is a crisp and soothing breath of fresh air that effortlessly smashes the boundaries of Hollywood romantic comedies, not to be appreciated by those with overarching optimistic sentimentalities and expectations of their movie.
1027;I felt that it was well.
1028;made and quite funny at times.
1029;budget, adventure movie is brilliant .
1030;and a real change from the usual movies at the moment.
1031;If you don't, then certainly I can understand someone saying its not a great movie.
1032;But if you are of the mind to understand what the movie is all about, then you will find that it is one of the most charming movies to come out in a long time.
1033;It will stay with you and you will want to see it again and again.
1034;thanks Mugino for bringing me to this movie!
1035;I definately like the shots of Tokyo and the wonderful cinematography not to mention the soundtrack.
1036;Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give nice polished performances that are not overacted to compensate for a script that is thin to say the least.
1037;And mope, mope and mope.
1038;And then they spot each other.
1039;She decides to visit a friend.
1040;What a lovely friend she makes!
1041;So what is a nice white girl to do but to take the mic herself and show these stupid Japanese people just what good singing really means!There is always much to do and see in a foreign land.
1042;If Ms. Coppola was trying to convey boredom and misery, then well done.
1043;the film makes fun of the weird things that the Japanese do, like idolizing Hollywood movie stars (how weird!)
1044;Bob is a very well known, famous and reputable actor.
1045;the character Bob was very realistic and plausible.
1046;Johansson and Murray strike up a friendship and become companions sojourning through the city.
1047;The movie did have some beautiful shots of Tokyo but that was really about it.
1048;The story itself was very understated and simple and really never took off in my opinion.
1049;There he meets the Gen Y wife of a hip young photographer named Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson).
1050;Still, as stated, the movie's visuals are its real charm.
1051;Sofia's brother made a far superior film a few years ago that dealt with many of the same themes of alienation.
1052;I enjoyed this movie for a number of reasons.
1053;First, it is so wonderful to have a film about actual people moving through something approaching a real life on the road overseas.
1054;Just actual human characters with failings and emotions.
1055;bill Murray does so much with such complexity and subtlety that my appreciation for him has grown even deeper.
1056;Scarlett Johansson is also quite special and memorable in this role.
1057;There is a pair of scenes that epitomizes what these two pull off together (there are many more wonderful scenes than this example).
1058;They pull this off with a power that distills real life.
1059;It is an adult film because of the deep, complex, and subtle emotions it evokes in dealing with the pain the protagonists lives and the friendship that flowers for them in their exotic setting.
1060;it really is a touching and powerful film with some quite humorous moments.
1061;Lost in Translation is an amazing achievement for the director Sofia Coppola and the actors Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.
1062;The film plays like one long beautiful dream of friendship and shared experiences in an alternate universe.
1063;the film's plot is simple.
1064;Murray's character is going through a classic mid.
1065;they connect in the hotel bar after seeing each other at various venues.
1066;Slowly and subtly a lovely, amazing friendship develops.
1067;And that's the beauty of the movie: how at a disparate moment of time, two souls can connect on an emotional and not a physical level.
1068;the frenzy of Tokyo day and night life provides a powerful counterpoint to the slowly unfolding friendship.
1069;Coppola has an amazing eye for the scenes and sights that tell a story.
1070;i would recommend this movie to those individuals who gravitate towards intelligent, art house films.
1071;i consider this movie one of the best that I have seen over the past few years.
1072;and I see a lot of movies!
1073;it does make you wonder whether Bill will bag the girl or not and that's the suspense of the movie.
1074;one of the bigger dissapointments I've seen in the last few years.
1075;But, it's quite funny and fun to watch, like taking a cool vactation vicariously.
1076;Having been to Japan 4 times I totally knew how the main characters felt.
1077;Anyone who has travelled to Asia has felt this moment.
1078;i really loved this movie.
1079;bill Murray does give a fine performance, and has several opportunities to showcase his ironic wit, especially when filming a whiskey commercial.
1080;top gaudy Japanese talk show is another one of the highlights.
1081;it's a friend story, and one in which the friends aren't acting terribly rationally.
1082;Some of the humor is more clich d than funny, especially the ditzy blonde American actress.
1083;this is a movie that caters to the American public's taste.
1084;The development of the relationship between Bill Murray's character Bob Harris and the character played by Scareltt Johansson is enjoyable and is really lovely.
1085;i enjoyed the scenes of the Tokyo nightlife.
1086;I liked the characters and that made the movie.
1087;Lost in Translation is arguably Bill Murray's best movie to date and has the most memorable start ever!
1088;BM is sublime as the jaded middle aged American film star on assignment abroad
1089;Scarlett Johansson is equally convincing as the sensitive and lonely newlywed whose chance meeting with Murray in Tokyo morphs into an unlikely search for love and life's meaning.
1090;Old and new Japan as experienced by both outsiders, its glitz and tradition, holds an increasingly beguiling fascination that becomes an intriguing movie theme in itself.
1091;Without doubt repeat viewing of LIT is a pleasure.
1092;The shocking part is that I am a fan of Bill Murray along with being an Italian and always pulling for a fellow Italian such as Sophia Coppola.
1093;In fact, many have seen the movie more than once in order to continue their exploration of Ms. Coppola's fantastic characters.
1094;The relationship between Bob and Charlotte is not a traditional Hollywood romance but stands above the solely physical interraction seen in many movies.
1095;Expect an honest portrayal of loneliness and the true comfort one can find through contact with another in a like situation.
1096;Again, please see this movie.
1097;seas in Southeast Asia, I was really looking forward to enjoying this movie.
1098;Japan is such an interesting place to visit even if you don't know the language.
1099;I was totally astonished about how great Lost in Translation was and how much I enjoyed it.
1100;I truly think this was Bill Murray's role of a lifetime and worthy of an Oscar, and here as no where else Scarlett Johansson showed she is one of the most talented young actresses in the business today.
1101;Hats off to everyone involved in making this delightful film!
1102;Scarlett Johansson is very appealing as Charlotte, the neglected young wife of a photographer.
1103;Charlotte doesn't get very many good lines and has to compensate with a good range of facial expression.
1104;but director Sofia Coppola makes the most of the materials at hand, and this is a good film in spite of its defects.
1105;Murray and Johansson's performances overcome a weak script, and the vignettes of life in Tokyo capture the spirit of a city that one writer has compared to Disneyland.
1106;I had high expectations for this film.
1107;It has its moments, even some beautiful and touching interludes, but for the most part it is stupefying.
1108;there are two worthwhile scenes.
1109;It's touching and well done.
1110;the movie does give an extended look at Tokyo.
1111;picture this: it's an American kid's first day at a Japanese school.
1112;His family has just migrated to Japan.
1113;So, all the other high school kids start laughing at this.
1114;Not so funny now is it.
1115;The movie felt so great at the end and it just makes you want to laugh, cry, and perhaps jump for joy.
1116;bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson star together in what I would consider one of the best movie about loneliness and hopefulness.
1117;Murray is on a business trip to make money from sponsors, but he has a wife at home who pays more attention to their children than him.
1118;Together, Johansson and Murray learn something together and both at the end realizes that life has a lot more to offer than what is in a relationship.
1119;I never been to Japan, but I have been to Korea and I can relate to the feeling of isolation but as well as a part of the culture there.
1120;i think what makes this movie so special is the actors who played it out.
1121;Scarlett has a very special look to her that I think fit well for this movie.
1122;She has a sort of modern beauty to her, but at the same time, you can sort of sense that she is searching for something in life.
1123;I think this is quite possibly the best part of the entire film.
1124;It sort of makes you wonder what Bill said to Johansson at the end, but at the same time it gives you a bit of hope and inspiration that even though you feel lonely now, and perhaps in what ever relationship you are in, that there is always hope and in that it sort of brings about your purpose, I think.
1125;with such a brilliant ending, wonderfully thought out actor and actress, and a beautiful setting, I think this movie is one of the best movies of the recent decade.
1126;At the end of the film I was feeling great about myself and each time I see this movie, I just think about it for days at a time.
1127;Bill Murry does amazing here.
1128;He's spot on displaying the feeling of being alone, being lonely and searching for hope in something, anything.
1129;He's a great actor and portrays that wonderfully here.
1130;He's funny and desprate all at the same time.
1131;Scarlott, who I believe to be one of the most talented and beautiful young actresses around does unbelievable here and I agree with the millions who were pissed she didn't recieve an oscar nod.
1132;This is an all around wonder of a film and should be expierienced again and again.
1133;Could make this movie interesting.
1134;I went in with all the best intentions in the world, but wow.
1135;bill Murray has a few bright moments in this movie.
1136;scarlett Johansson is just a pretty face, and she had no business sharing the silver.
1137;This movie is definitely a sleeper though, I'll give you that.
1138;the acting is excellent, the chemestry between the two leading actors is wonderful, the camerawork is supurb, and the message gets across beautifully.
1139;this much work into telling a story should be spent on a story worth the effort.
1140;What to do while watching: Try to guess what's going to happen.
1141;There are several transcendent moments that tie back into the title without elbowing you in the side.
1142;The uncanny Bill Murray shines as Bob Harris, an aging movie star well into the product.
1143;She takes herself by day into Japan to discover its mysteries and wonders.
1144;In a subtle moment, she glances at some polaroids of her husband and herself.
1145;It isn't long before they meet and, charming as they both are, they start to hang out.
1146;the story sets up for a torrid love tryst between the young Charlotte and the mature Bob.
1147;Both characters have their marriages, challenges and all, and Bob deftly sublimates the sexual tension.
1148;the friendship, therefore, is very touching.
1149;The two teach one another very lovely and ephemeral lessons.
1150;I call this movie a classic because it has a sense of innocence and simplicity that I associate with golden.
1151;There's an earnest attempt to portray several characters, two in the middle, with all their foibles.
1152;It's a film like this that one can enjoy like a good book.
1153;It can envelope you and change you with a soft touch.
1154;I look forward to Coppola's next work.
1155;He meets Charlotte in the hotel where they both live, but it is a romance that can never work.
1156;In this film, Bill Murray is sublime and lost, and Scarlett Johansson convincingly intelligent, sexy and lost .
1157;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson's tense friendship, on first viewing, tends to overshadow the other marvelous aspects of this film.
1158;It's filled with so many small, beautiful, moments like when Johansson takes the bullet train to Kyoto and wanders around templea and witnesses a traditional wedding that touches her and redeems Japanese culture in her heart.
1159;and this movie is hilarious, even more so if you know how true.
1160;star reviews and glowing rhetoric.
1161;This is an original piece of work, with a decided air of wisdom, that simply didn't connect with me deeply at any point.
1162;Director Sofia Coppola provides several long silences for what one can only assume is viewer introspection.
1163;Judging from the film's enthusiastic following, Lost translated art into life quite well.
1164;but, despite these screenplay issues, the acting and direction absolutely stand out as among the best work in recent memory.
1165;Both with equal desperation to escape their surroundings, Bob and Charlotte strike an unexpected and deep friendship.
1166;Can they drop everything that's become so achingly familiar and try to start their lives over again, perhaps more along the lines of what they had hoped they'd always be?As good as Murray is, and he is absolutely terrific, Johansson taps into a wonderful intangible that makes her presence on the screen thoroughly intoxicating.
1167;She shares palpable chemistry with the much.
1168;older Murray, making the bond between them feel all the more genuine.
1169;Director Coppola takes full advantage of this, with inventive visuals and direction that is so sure.
1170;Overall, I find the film rather enjoyable, but at the same time there is this duel nature surrounding it that I find to be both admirable and disdainable.
1171;for me this duel nature lies at the heart of the task undertaken by Sofia Coppola.
1172;What we are essentially presented with is a film that is both a detached/modernest/post.
1173;modernist/art house work along the lines of the earlier mentioned artists and an outside, yet still inside of Hollywood Hollywood film.
1174;as a fan of the filmmakers she has been inspired by, I have a deep respect for Coppola in bringing forth that type of filmmaking to a mainstream audience.
1175;By making the film relatively mainstream, it can also be seen as going against the type of filmmaking it admires.
1176;again, although I'm rather critical about the overall nature of the film, I still find it very enjoyable.
1177;It is a great exercise in creating a mood of detachment.
1178;The wonderful cinematography also plays a big role here, as the camera positioning helps further the mood of detachment a number of times throughout the film.
1179;And then obviously, there are the fabulous performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.
1180;At the end of the day the film has all the ingredients of a great work, but still seems to be missing that extra.
1181;something to make it truly special.
1182;the film serves as a nice addition to the growing trend of films on the fringe of Hollywood that play on the traditional expectations of romantic comedies and romance in Hollywood film in general, right alongside Punch Drunk.
1183;love and the recent Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
1184;The film, although not filled with exciting plot twists, is rather good.
1185;I believe that we all can relate to situations in which we become friends with someone, yet never keep in touch after this seemingly wonderful time has passed.
1186;The characters are real, and heartfelt, and although, like I said, it wasn't incredibly exciting, it does contemplate the mechanics of relationships in a way I never thought possible.
1187;I think this is a wonderful film.
1188;I think the movie is excellent.
1189;In truth, Sofia Coppola has created a nice companion piece to her brother Roman Coppola's film CQ in that two Americans abroad find friendship and potential romance despite many obstacles and differences.
1190;This is a character study in which Bill Murray gets to deliver an often subtle, serious portrayal of an actor in the twilight of his career.
1191;Scarlett Johansson does a fantastic job too, but can't outshine Bill Murray.
1192;I usually prefer broad slapstick, but found myself enjoying this film more each time I saw it.
1193;I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a non.
1194;Bill Murray was great and Scarlett Johansson did an awesome job as well.
1195;If you don't care for this movie, thats fine.
1196;Wake up and pay attention.
1197;The two main characters are kept apart for most of film, with Sophia wisely choosing to dwell on them when their alone both literally and metaphorically
1198;As Bob and Charlotte cross paths more and more fequently the movie builds with understated urgency, until the film springs to life midway through when they finally come together for a night on the town in a fast paced sequence of fun colorful adventures.
1199;Oddly enough, the moving conclusion ends up being a bittersweet triumph, hinting at a new found strength in the characters.
1200;Sophia makes good use of both the actors and the beautiful urban setting while showing an excellent understanding for almost pure visual storytelling.
1201;A very mature Scarlett does much of her acting with subtle looks of vaguely masked dis.
1202;When they do interact, the scenes are filled with incredibly sincere subtle gestures that reflect warm fondness and understanding if not an all out unspoken attraction.
1203;It's this geniune warmth that makes the film so romantic and the earlier melancholy all the more worthwhile.
1204;a short featurette with Sophia and Bill is the most useful and watchable.
1205;The menu screen is beautiful however.
1206;i like independent artsy films BUT obviously the only reason this one got so much industry attention was because WHO the writer and director is.
1207;widening gulf between his personal aspirations and his professional obligations, as well as a marriage succumbing to the laws of entropy
1208;bob and Charlotte, strangers in a strange land, notice each other, meet and strike up an unlikely acquaintance and this beautifully shot and languidly paced film leaves it up to the audience to decide what really happens next.
1209;down one of my favourite films of all time.
1210;It is slowly paced, beautifully crafted, touching in parts, hypnotic in others and is occasionally wince.
1211;it also boasts a gorgeous soundtrack featuring the likes of Air, Squarepusher, and Mount Sims.
1212;life crisis movie that the world deserves.
1213;This is a wonderful movie, gently funny, and full of subtle little touches and terrific acting.
1214;It's not the best movie of all time, but very well crafted, and IMHO, deserved its Best Original Screenplay Oscar award for Sofia Coppola.
1215;I think, first and foremost, the two characters of Bob and Charlotte and their situation have to appeal to you.
1216;One has to be able to have an understanding and empathy for their sense of loneliness and being unstuck in time, and also be able to share in their mutual joy at finding each other and being able to share in this brief friendship while traveling in a strange land.
1217;action adventure CGI superhero movies, I also have wonderful memories of many friendships with women, none of whom were or became my girlfriends or lovers.
1218;And so watching this movie brings on an intense feeling of d j vu
1219;And that is what is so poignant and wistful about the ending of this movie .
1220;i was fascinated by the interaction of Japanese and Americans in this movie
1221;bill Murray is terrific in the role of Bob Harris.
1222;With all the hype in the news media about Johansson's beauty, Sofia Coppola's natural, unvarnished portrayal of her in this movie was the surprising part.
1223;up, revealing the small moles on her face, and in some close.
1224;up scenes the natural color of the roots of her hair.
1225;Johannson is a lot shorter than I had thought, but well along the lines of, shall we say, a classical beauty, like Botticelli's Venus.
1226;He really wants to say good.
1227;The final scene as Bob finds Charlotte again on his way to the airport is a terrifically poignant ending, full of mystery and an unspoken loss and wistfulness that comes only from the parting of a great friendship between a man and a woman.
1228;in our modern day world, fast.
1229;paced, and incredibly mobile and transient, such passing friendships happen altogether more commonly
1230;Lost in Translation is that rare movie which addresses this theme from every day life realistically, faithfully, and poignantly.
1231;I enjoyed it more than any film since Mulholland Drive, and before that, since Hillary and Jackie.
1232;this film has personal meaning for me because I'm a translator, of Japanese to English.
1233;Today I realized that this film is actually an American zuihitsu.
1234;There's a certain similarity to stream.
1235;one observation links to another, and another, and the pleasure comes not from Aristotelian development but from a sense of versimilitude in how one scene, one emotion, fades into the next, on and on.
1236;At the end, if you feel the emotions are real, then you feel the narrative was good.
1237;tokyo is a place where absolutely everything imaginable exists, but it's hard to get a grip on anything definite.
1238;class city, and objectively I concede she's probably right.
1239;so, for me the film and the characters and the emotions are utterly believable and one thousand percent credible.
1240;To me, that's what makes this film brilliant.
1241;Lost in Translation is quiet, graceful, and would be moving to anyone who takes the time to sit and watch it.
1242;bustingly funny, based on the clever trailers.
1243;especially during the karaoke sequence.
1244;She went to the places she liked, she had the characters (I use that word loosely) at the hotel she liked, and she kind of followed them around as they floundered about in Tokyo.
1245;Things just kind of unfold, and I too, felt the actors were just real people .
1246;I felt like the two leads had each found the right person and yet they would still be going back to the wrong lives.
1247;It was very powerful, and despite the adlib feel of the entire film, when it came to the end, both the actors conveyed the emotion beautifully (something two real people off the street could not do).
1248;scarlett Johansson was so beautiful that it was worth watching the film just to look at her .
1249;the cinematography was great, and living here in Tokyo, I know how hard it was to get some of those incredible shots.
1250;She probably just liked the song.
1251;If they recommend this one, don't trust them!
1252;Although a nice looking film this isn't even Bill Murray's best film to date.
1253;There are couple decent scenes, but it moves along very slowly at times.
1254;Scarlett Johansson looks good on screen and has a nice presence, but that could be just all those underwear shots they had in the movie.
1255;Have you ever sat through a movie that is really good, has a compelling story, great characters, and yet still felt a little cold?
1256;I mean you really liked the movie, it made you think, it didn't play down to you, and yet you were hoping for little bit more?
1257;Sophia Coppola's new film LOST IN TRANSLATION, is a good movie with a great movie caught inside it.
1258;She's alone in a city of millions.
1259;tRANSLATION is so rich with ideas.
1260;bill Murray once again takes the smart road and distances himself from the films that made him a star.
1261;He plays a character of such stunning vulnerability and yet silly charm.
1262;I loved how he disappears into a scene.
1263;I sometimes miss the silly and crazy actor he once was, but at least when he turns in a dramatic performance it's well worth watching.
1264;johansson should also be congratulated for her fine performance.
1265;I liked her understated charm and silly little smile.
1266;The camera loves to linger on her because shes got this unique screen presence.
1267;Of course she's beautiful, but not as a typical actress is beautiful.
1268;She's beautiful like that girl in you're high school homeroom is beautiful, or that random women on the street is beautiful.
1269;She's average and yet mysterious, cute and yet understated.
1270;to the films credit there is a great sequence in which Bob and Charlotte are laying together in a bed.
1271;But in this film Bob does something far more interesting he just touches her foot.
1272;In real life you have to face the ones you love in the morning, Best not throw it all away on a person you hardly know.
1273;Whats here is a compelling piece of filmmaking that dares you to do something we, as causal moviegoers, are seldom allowed to do.
1274;It deservingly garnered three Golden Globe wins (Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay) and four Oscar nominations (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Original Screenplay).
1275;Its plot of an American actor popular in the 1970's who finds peace in Japan is brilliant and original.
1276;The combination of the two storylines come together smoothly, especially when the two characters become soulmates.
1277;The dramatic aspects keep audience interested in every moment.
1278;Bill Murray marks a triumphant comeback in this movie.
1279;Though well known as a comedian, he shines in this dramatic role.
1280;Scarlett Johansson marks a brilliant career launcher in her role.
1281;She proves that she'll continue becomine well.
1282;known as a wonderful actress in the future.
1283;Because of the immense movie depth, audiences may have to watch this multiple times to catch every detail.
1284;I won't recap the movie since it is already documented above, but this movie was thoroughly enjoyable.
1285;I was able to relate to the movie's finding yourself theme.
1286;The charachters communicate on a purely emotional level.
1287;The footage of Tokyo was excellent and the Japanese culture was portrayed in an admirable (and at times humorous)fashion.
1288;to reflect on our lives and ensure we are living our lives to the fullest.
1289;A sweet friendship that avoids the traditional movie cliches grows between them.
1290;The story may seem meandering and aimless, but that is an accurate reflection of the lives of these characters.
1291;Murray plays his role with an easy, understated charm, and Johansson is charming and vulnerable.
1292;The authentic representation of Japanese society, augmented by on location filming in Tokyo, is another plus.
1293;Writer/director Sofia Coppola has done a terrific job.
1294;Promoted as Bill Murray's most hilarious film, we were expecting at LEAST amusement when we shelled out $17 for two tickets.
1295;Overpromoted, oversold, full of itself, snob.
1296;I'm at a loss for words to adequately describe this film.
1297;It's something that you must experience .
1298;Lost in Translation is an intelligent film that requires audience participation and self.
1299;reflection to really appreciate its true value and meaning.
1300;Not everyone's going to get it but for those who do, this film is absolutely wonderful, full of meaning, comfort, and beauty.
1301;One of the most thoughtful and beautiful movies I've seen in the past year.
1302;Coppola is clearly an observant writer and director.
1303;There are several little fascinating, yet unexplained observations of life in modern Japan (the traditional wedding party and the Tokyo video arcade are good examples).
1304;These scenes are engaging because we are also engaged by the two main characters who are stumbling through this strange world, even as they are discovering a soul mate in each other.
1305;One of my favorite compositions is a shot of Murray driving a golf ball off a tee with a beautiful mountain backdrop (Mt. Fuji maybe?)
1306;Scenic nature is nice, but even better is the urban atmosphere of Tokyo.
1307;Both the interior and exterior shots are interestingly composed and lit.
1308;The hotel and taxi scenes were evocative, reminding me of Polanski's Frantic , another jet.
1309;There is great writing and acting as well.
1310;And the unspoken expressive acting between the two when they go out for a silent lunch after he disappoints her was also very well done.
1311;It's just a good pun.
1312;Murray is very funny, but in an understated way.
1313;And the movie is much deeper than most comedies I see.
1314;There are a couple of redeeming points about the film .
1315;it's interesting as a travelogue, the portraits of vapid people are fairly good .
1316;This is top three in my book between Shawshank Redemption and True Romance.
1317;I loved it because it showed how you need to cherish things for how they are and remember things.
1318;Im not going to get into a philosophical rant, but this shows a relationship that doesnt need sex, and still is a strong and caring relationship with unconditional feelings (the only thing I could get from when Bill Murry is with the older chick).
1319;It also has to do with what I feel how things dont last forever.
1320;Regardless, this is an awesome movie, if you understand and love to search for meaning.
1321;and I am a big fan .
1322;Scarlett Johansson is cute as hell, though, and the acting generally is quite OK.
1323;Like it or not, it is also a test of love and fidelity, when Harris meets up with a twenty.
1324;Here, Bill Murray proves to be the master craftsman, as his suave demeanor and charasmatic wit carries him through the film without any traceable snags or bumps, as he wins the hearts of the local Japanese faithful, regardless of the fact his character doesn't understand neither the national customs nor the language, for all concerned.
1325;I love all the locations that they used.
1326;besides that, the music is awesome.
1327;this is a great movie with great performances.
1328;What you do have are two characters you have never seen before, yet you can probably identify with both of them a lot of the time.
1329;Their platonic friendship is refreshing
1330;He has a lot of down time.
1331;It is here that Murray's comic ability comes through.
1332;When he is in an elevator and he is a foot taller than every other man in there, he has a look on his face that evokes a chuckle.
1333;He is always working, leaving her alone to do nothing.
1334;I was able to see myself and alot of what I feel from the characters on the screen.
1335;I found him funnier and more entertaining here than I have in a dozen of his comedies before.
1336;They have always been, and will always be about characters.
1337;I found these two very interesting.
1338;I did, however, finish it after reading how the ending was so great.
1339;What compounds the idea is that it won so many awards.
1340;Must believe in true platonic love between two people.
1341;Great movie to watch several times to find deeper means.
1342;Her second feature, LOST IN TRANSLATION, has received even more critical praise, plus 3 Golden Globe awards and Oscar nominations for best picture, screenplay, director, and actor.
1343;The other for the rest of the cast: Johansson (believable though out of her element), Ribisi (perfect as the adolescent, self.
1344;First time around, I thought this picture was good and remember recommending it to friends.
1345;True, there are good points, some jokes, and Johansson is photogenic.
1346;The direction is competent, the setting is arresting and seldom used, so all the power to Coppola, but as cool as Murray is supposed to be, I thought his antics tiresome.
1347;The acting is good and the story isn't bad.
1348;Japan has been the next great thing now for thirty years.
1349;This is one independent film (and believe me their are great ones) that had no business entering the mainstream fray .
1350;I love it!I could relate because of the times I traveled and experienced jet lag.
1351;Lost in Translation really gives you that middle of the night jet lag feelThe movie is quirky.
1352;The perfect movie to watch for those by themselves and experiencing jet lag.
1353;Bill Murray is really amazing in Sofia Coppala's Lost in Translation.
1354;The scenary is great in Japan and they really show you it.
1355;Scarlett Johansson is also very compelling as the female lead and as lovely as ever.
1356;The supporting cast is also good is this great movie.
1357;Bill Murray is fairly humorous at times.
1358;the good parts of this movie are based on Bill Murray's work and what the various entities of Sophia's father's high powered production team produce.
1359;What's creative or funny about that?
1360;You can hear that kind of humor on any morning drive 'neck radio station.
1361;To make it more artistic many landscape shots are present.
1362;Definitely a chick movie I'd say but it's watchable.
1363;If you like this sort of thing, you'll enjoy the movie.
1364;Even if you have vague, faint sympathy for this sort of thing, lost in translation is worth your while.
1365;If you enjoy clear channel radio stations and Tom Clancy novels.
1366;Their careers, lovers, and even immediate surroundings feel foreign to them.
1367;This is made even better by not using Japanese subtitles, when it's spoken so much throughout the movie.
1368;sofia has documented alienation in its purest form, then swept it away with sweet love.
1369;This is one of the few films that portrays real life.
1370;It is closer to real life than most films.
1371;as much cultural commentary as it is a buddy movie, this film defies true categorization because it shifts unpredictably from one absurd moment to the next, and then anchors itself firmly in honest, quiet scenes that contrast beautifully with the neon glare of the city.
1372;Sofia Cuppola uses a light hand, and she has miraculously excised the ham from Bill Murray.
1373;The chemistry between Murray and Johansson is as phenomenal as it is unassuming.
1374;rate, and the visuals are stunning.
1375;if you have ever been to Japan, you MUST see this film.
1376;It perfectly captures the surrealism of Tokyo for the visiting American, that brilliant kaleidoscope that never quite seems to make sense when your days have turned into nights, and you wake up every morning at three a. m. From the television shows to the pachinko parlors to the shabu.
1377;You'll like this film anyway for its gentle humor and excellent performances.
1378;Lost in Translation is a truly intelligent comedy that will continue to grow on you even days after its viewing.
1379;I thought that it my be good because I loved Virgin Suidies.
1380;If you are unhappy it will make you more unhappy and it you are happy it will reck your night.
1381;I love Bill Murray, completely enjoyed the Life Aquatic, but this flick didn't do it for me.
1382;That feeling is so much more intense in a foreign country.
1383;You put two strangers, one man, one woman, in that state of mind together, things can get interesting.
1384;Bob longs for the youthful simplicity Charlotte has, while Charlotte craves the life long wisdom Bob possesses.
1385;This movie captures that beautifully.
1386;You are such a funny actor.
1387;And she does have pretty eyes and nice legs and beautiful skin.
1388;And she's a good actress, although this part did not stretch her or even challenge her.
1389;And after a fashion one gets used to the slightly arrogant Bill Murray style.
1390;His character is, after all, an action hero who gets paid $2.
1391;(I'll take the wild, wild women.)
1392;Wow, one would think he would NOTICE.
1393;okay, I saw the rest of the film and .
1394;well, the mass mind over thirty.
1395;how excellent it is, or to punctuate a point, how profound or how prosaic.
1396;the shots of Japan are wonderful, like a travel log.
1397;i also liked the bit with the semi.
1398;it is also to Sofia Coppola's credit that she got the relationship exactly right: she knew how the old guy felt and she knew how the young girl felt, and she knew what was right and what would be the right ending.
1399;see this for Sofia Coppola who made her father proud.
1400;If you like Bill Murray as I and many others do, then you'll love this bittersweet romance between him and a very young Scarlett Johansson.
1401;Thanks to his skill and Sofia Coppola's sensitive direction, one can believe the romance between these two lonely souls lost in a foreign land.
1402;According to the con men, the clothing is so fine that it can only be seen by those of high intelligence.
1403;What hidden meanings?A movie's principal purpose should be to entertain.
1404;Bill Murray is Bob Harris, a once popular American actor who now, in his middle.
1405;This Tokyo excursion will take about a week, and the monetary reward will be quite handsome.
1406;It's about the place, and the points that each of these people are at in their lives.
1407;Both are young, and both are self.
1408;She has issues of her own.
1409;this is probably Bill Murray's most understated performance, and it works brilliantly.
1410;He conveys so much with just a smile, a frown, his body language, or simply the look in his eyes.
1411;He should get an Oscar nomination for this.
1412;Scarlett Johansson, who left me unimpressed in the movie Ghost World a few years ago, is excellent in her role here.
1413;She portrays Charlotte as a deep, troubled, yet intelligent young woman and, like her co. star, does it without overstating it.
1414;Johansson is definitely an actress to watch for in the coming years.
1415;sofia Coppola has succeeded in creating a sliver of time and place with Lost In Translation.
1416;It creates two of the most realistic characters to ever grace the cinema.
1417;it will cease to be the present, and will instead become only a nostalgic memory.
1418;Overall it was pretty good.
1419;Bill Murray is pretty funny.
1420;The movie made Japan seem very interesting and mysterious, it made me want to go there.
1421;This is movie is great, but very understated.
1422;See it with an open mind, and patience.
1423;In other words, we're seeing Tokyo through their eyes, for what it means to them.
1424;I think the humor is innocent.
1425;And it is hilarious too.
1426;And this film is boring, but very beautiful.
1427;And the only thing you need is human touch, moreover, human presence.
1428;It is the necessity of talk about whatever and going anywhere with somebody.
1429;making a film about boredom leads you to unsuccess, even if you treat the story pleasantly and elegantly.
1430;So, the final rate must be in the middle.
1431;Its the kind of movie that grows on you.
1432;Plot is simple but the relationship between the leads draws you in and you feel as if you are there with them in Japan.
1433;The love story is so subtle but Murray nails it and the chemistry between these 2 is what makes the movie a winner.
1434;The cinematography and music sells it and the fact it was all shot on location in Japan.
1435;She is a profoundly gifted film maker.
1436;There is an easy naturalism to the plot line and the performances.
1437;What appears as effortless is the end result of focus, inspiration and lots of hard work.
1438;I find that I am constantly amazed by the great poise and skill that so many young actors bring to their work.
1439;My, God, she's a baby!
1440;When Johanssen is on screen she is mesmerizing, even when she is doing nothing.
1441;but what makes this film a cause for celebration to my mind is Bill Murray.
1442;He is a wonderfully unique actor whose particular skills where used to perfection in this film.
1443;His understated but hilarious reactions to Japanese culture are a treat to behold.
1444;the plot is almost secondary to the story, because it is the intricate , unique and beautiful relationship that develops between Murray and Johanssen that drives this tale.
1445;This is a very special film.
1446;It is masterfully framed and filmed.
1447;The subtle color palette employed by the cinematography is visually lovely and lyrically incorporates itself into the specific feel of the story as well as its.
1448;Its message is simple, stark and bleak and the viewer must be willing to enter that sense of nothingness and accept it on its own terms.
1449;Rather this film is recommended to those who want to ponder and think upon the small worlds we create to anchor us in a world pretty much out of control.
1450;i loved this movie so much, very touching.
1451;The film's stars are played by comic genius Bill Murray (Bob Harris) and the charismatic rising young actress Scarlett Johansson (Charlotte).
1452;He does however have several humorous encounters with citizens, which never end well thanks to the language barrier.
1453;With the universal acclaim the film received I expected a laugh out loud comedy
1454;I thought it was too subtle
1455;Although, the film does offer things of interest such as the cinematography and the leads subtle performances and chemistry.
1456;The cinematography was quite amazing and it in no way made the film seem low budget, which it was with a production budget of 4 million (looks more expensive).
1457;The performances were also great.
1458;As I already mentioned they were subtle, so they felt real and natural.
1459;I felt like I was viewing a documentary about two people's long friendship.
1460;With the performances realism I ended up caring for them, I felt sympathy for them.
1461;I also loved the last good bye between Bob and Charlotte, it was moving and heartbreaking, I empathized with them watching their sad facial expressions.
1462;I know I was happy when her character died.
1463;What a beautiful piece of work.
1464;But hey, at least he watched something without Ahhhhhhnold in it for a change!This film is subtle and brilliant, and definitely needs to be viewed more than once.
1465;Bill Murray's best role since Rushmore (and if you liked that movie, you'll like this one), and Scarlett Johanssen's best since Ghost World (which grew on me after several viewings).
1466;a seriously intelligent piece of work, and visually stunning to boot.
1467;There is some nice cinematography, a few insights about Japanese culture, and an out of character (but one.
1468;Amidst the various Best Picture Oscar contenders this year lies two hidden treasures most likely to be overlooked for the greater presence exuded by The Return of the King, Master and Commander and Seabiscuit.
1469;It's really the good combination of good acting and directing.
1470;Hemled by second time director, Sophia Coppola (incidentally also nomianted for Best Director and Best Screenplay), she was very much able to explore and bring out the inner struggles of two helplessly souls in a foreign land.
1471;The director deliberately makes use of the slow pace to showcase the development of a great platonic friendship between the most unlikely of couples.
1472;the special effect here is really the superb performance by the two leads.
1473;The sweetly innocent Scarlett Johansson puts on excellent portrayal of a lost wife stuck in the monotony of a seemingly aimless marriage.
1474;Bill Murray, nomianted for a Best Actor Oscar, is convincing as a has.
1475;It's ultimately about the power of silence and how greatly it wrecks relationships.
1476;It's also about how amazing relationships can develop no matter how strange the situation is or the people are.
1477;Coppola's film does a good job of capturing a mood: one of melancholy and wistfulness.
1478;And the soundtrack (more than anything else) solidifies this sometimes hypnotic and intoxicating mood.
1479;And in the process of this discovery, they very likely would have come to a better and deeper understanding about the country, and ultimately about themselves and where they're going.
1480;This is an interesting one.
1481;The performances are consistently great in this fish.
1482;They strike up a friendship that grows as the film progresses.
1483;They share their first kiss, though not a particularly passionate one.
1484;I found myself hoping that he said something like, lets give it some time and see how we feel when you get back to the states.
1485;Sophia Coppolla did do a great job with this movie.
1486;It shows a realistic slice of life, that is usually missing from films these days.
1487;This is Bill Murrays best role to date.
1488;A Scarlett Johansson is a talented discovery.
1489;This is a great movie.
1490;The movie takes place in Japan so that setting is what makes the film the great film it is.
1491;The Japanese setting and culture is fantastically imposing and crucial to the film.
1492;treat yourself to this movie.
1493;my country is populated by easily led fools: Oohhhh!
1494;Now the familiarity of the location really captured my attention.
1495;I was by myself a good amount of the time and had a lot of freedom to experience Tokyo as best I could.
1496;Also when Bob is just arriving into Tokyo from the airport and just looks so beat, but is kind of in awe of the lights and brilliance of the city.
1497;Anyway, the movie just really struck a chord with me in many ways.
1498;I find it hilarious at times, but not strictly a comedy.
1499;There are a lot of quiet moments that get you thinking about what's important in life, and about finding or searching for someone, if only a friend, that you are really comfortable being with.
1500;first I'm a big Bill Murray fan, and second, the movie had all this hype around it with it's praise from critics and the awards it had recieved.
1501;there are so many other great movies out right now.
1502;That's definitely the case with this excellent film.
1503;up to her remarkable debut, The Virgin Suicides, is a beautiful, subtle, funny and touching film.
1504;Both characters are lonely, isolated, and experiencing serious culture shock, so despite their age difference they come together to form a sincere and tender bond.
1505;Bill Harris (Bill Murray) is a middle aged American actor, well past his prime.
1506;He was once known for highly charged car chase sequences, and now he is best known in Japan for his ads for laid back, Rat Pack inspired whiskey commercials.
1507;bill and Charlotte become traveling companions and friends, exchanging their opinions and anxieties about life and love.
1508;this movie was beautifully shot, and there is a real meditative and almost dream.
1509;Also, it runs the line between quiet humor and introspective melancholy.
1510;Definitely not an upbeat movie, but definitely worth seeing for its beauty and poetry, as well quiet insight.
1511;the only good part of the flick is the intellectual connection between Bob and Charlotte.
1512;It's funny, sad, and sexy.
1513;I will say that Bill Murray is perfect as the weary, wary semi.
1514;He just manages to be completely believable, second by second.
1515;Like all great actors, he reveals by witholding.
1516;it's clear he desires the beautiful Charlotte (played with equal perfection by Scarlett Johansson)
1517;johansson perfectly plays a 20.
1518;help tapes, Buddhist temples, ikkebana (Japanese flowerr.
1519;It's really about the ineffable relationships that can form and even forge a life without quite changing the course of it.
1520;And it beautifully captures not only Tokyo, and its blurring rushed pace, but also those encounters of youth which we half.
1521;coppola's script is subtle and perfect, the pace is European.
1522;which is to say, human scale.
1523;The scenes of Japan are breathtaking, making a totally foreign place seem as real as the chair in which we sit.
1524;She captures the dreaminess of youth, its tempting possibilities and terrible loneliness and beauty.
1525;I think that's what makes it seem like such a fresh and youthful film.
1526;this is the ONLY movie I want to see more than once this year.
1527;It belongs in that precious category of movies like Falling in Love, Swept Away, Indochine that leave a lasting impression because they feel so pure and true.
1528;Coppola established herself as an excellent director with The Virgin Suicides, a film that is in fact superior to her latest effort.
1529;there's plenty to admire about Lost in Translation.
1530;Coppola has a light touch that gives her pictures a distinct atmosphere that lingers far beyond viewing.
1531;The movie continually has the feel of watching the sun rise after you've been drunk all night, and I mean that in a good way.
1532;But in a movie, something, anything, has to happen.
1533;And while, voyeuristically, that makes it occasionally compelling, that shouldn't be the reason we're watching.
1534;I had heard a lot about this movie (mainly that it was amazing, brilliant, and the bestest best film ever in the whole world.
1535;ever), so when I finally got a chance to see it at the cinema I spent the entire time thinking OK, when do we get to the exciting bit?
1536;It sets the mood of temporary, somewhat self.

1538;It's amazing how the sprawling city of Tokyo is quite literally just a backdrop

1541;bill Murray may have gotten all the praise, but Scarlett is the real break out star of this film, and deserved an Oscar nomination over the highly over.
1542;perfect film, heaped with brilliant performances from Bill Murray, a beautiful, elegant Scarlett Johansson, Giovanni Ribissi (or whatever his name is!)
1543;People who need films with formulaic plot structures and dramatic personalities and resounding outcomes are unlikely to enjoy this film.
1544;It is a purely existential movie, about existence as it is often lived.
1545;Moreover, it offers a wonderful sort of cinematic portrait of a Great City that defies definition.
1546;But IMO, it's a minor masterpiece.
1547;while there he comes across a lovely young 20.
1548;Both dislike Japan, but enjoy each others company.
1549;having lived in Japan for a few years myself, I found the movie especially nostalgic.
1550;to be sure, this is a film that meanders a bit.
1551;surprisingly enough, the #1 reason to pick this movie up is the performance of Scarlett Johansson.
1552;Her demure, subtle beauty and character steals the show away from the great Bill Murray.
1553;It is well done and, like a good song, difficult to get out of your head after you've seen it.

1555;old, American Charlotte (played beautifully by Scarlett Johansson).
1556;She is bright, a Yale philosophy graduate, who is struggling with her role in life.
1557;the mysterious ending is wonderful.
1558;Coppola has done a masterful job both telling a story and weaving beautiful cinematography into a cohesive whole.
1559;Photographed languidly, at a pace that captures a week of both characters' lives, you will revisit the story repeatedly in your mind.
1560;And that's the mark of an exceptional screenplay.
1561;I may be a bit biased, but I love Bill Murray, love Scarlett Johansson, and love almost anything quirky and character.
1562;In a world jammed full of You HAVE to love this!
1563;movies and series, I typically geek out on anything honest and real.
1564;seeming, and this is most certainly an honest film.
1565;I cried a bit of tears at the romanticism captured and portrayed in the movieI laughed my tail off.
1566;she's also great from Married With Children on 1 or 2 episodes.
1567;I can see myself still being touched and laughing at this great cinematic experience of love and humor put to the movie screen.
1568;Great job everyone who contributed to this movieThe scenes and scenery are simply amazingI could watch this again and again whenever I can get the time to watch my movies.

1574;Lost in Translation is recommended to fans of Murray and Johansson as an example of their range as actors.
1575;for movies that are character driven instead of plot driven, i. e. the movie consists primarily of a series of neat character bits with very little forward momentum to the plot?If, like me, you can answer yes to all of the above, you'll probably love this movie.
1576;Bob is in Japan, where his show is still amazingly popular, to film a whiskey commercial.
1577;Charlotte is in Japan accompanying a neglectful photographer husband more interested in partying with the beautiful people than spending any time at all with his wife.
1578;And yet they both take their marriage vows seriously.
1579;Personally, I thought the ending was absolutely brilliant .
1580;All have been beautifully made movies with perfectly acted roles by Murray, and Lost in Translation is no exception.
1581;this movie was one of a small group of movies (which I can count on one hand) that has left me with a real appreciation of the beauty that's possible in film, and in some ways, in life
1582;It is NOT boring, though, and it IS very funny.
1583;And I for one was cheering for Bill Murray during the Oscars.
1584;All in all, a great movie and another excellent longterm career choice for Bill Murray.
1585;I am a person that usually loves independent or foreign movies, and that seemed to be when this movie came out the audience that it appealed to.
1586;It may very well be original, because most film makers aren't stupid and/or brave enough to make a movie without a plot.
1587;David Lynch, Darren Aronofsky, Tim Burton, these are good film makers whos films stimulate the mind and have an orignal flair and a plot at the same time (yes, its possible).
1588;The only thing this movie is good for is a scenic view of Japan
1589;I am welcome to you comments on why you liked this movie.

1592;daughter of the master Francis himself.
1593;has made a fantastic exploration into human emotion and the depth of human longing and love with this film, in the frame of today's paradoxically plastic and ancient Tokyo.
1594;Scarlett Johansson gives a performance that belies her age, carrying the expressions of emotions that seem to have a wisdom about them in their intensity.
1595;And Bill Murray's work is reminiscent of Miles Davis
1596;He deserved the Oscar nomination for this work, as did Sophia for an enigmatic screenplay that deceptively reveals as much realism as any Impressionist piece by Monet or any of the photography of Steichen.You won't need to try and enjoy this movie with an open mind or anything.
1597;Loneliness is one of the most basic human emotions
1598;The two finally meet over drinks, and begin to bond and explore the city of Tokyo.
1599;length film has qualities to make up for its improvised plot, with the beautiful cinematography, good direction and outstanding acting by its two main leads.
1600;But at the same time, it gives the film a more realistic feeling .
1601;in keeping with the theme, Coppola keeps the movie slow and pensive, with plenty of beautiful cinematography and exquisite shots of Tokyo.
1602;And the quiet dialogue has a witty, acerbic edge, such as when dizzy blonde Kelly announces I'm under Evelyn Waugh, only to have Charlotte inform her that, Evelyn Waugh was a man.
1603;Bill Murray rules this film, with his understated expressions and world.
1604;It's surprising that someone could act so blase, and yet be strangely charming.
1605;Scarlett Johansson proves that she is no longer just another child star, with a solid performance that stacks up well beside veteran Murray's.
1606;Just soak it in, and see how you like it.
1607;I can tell you right here everything that happens in the movie so save your money.
1608;In the end he leaves to the U. s. and she stays in Japan.
1609;Director Sofia Coppola certainly has an eye for interesting shots, but her talents as a screenwriter need development.
1610;Up to that point, the film presents a slice of life view of Japan.
1611;In her second film, 'Lost in Translation', Sofia Copolla displays her astounding screenwriting capabilities.
1612;Capabilities that will hopefully be developed and explored further in the future.
1613;This is what gives the film its tragic beauty.
1614;The preformances by both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are pitch perfect in what was an outstanding piece of casting.
1615;Each of them more than deserving at least an Oscar nomination.
1616;Brilliant film that proves storytelling doesn't have to follow traditional and often overused structures.
1617;It had great preformances, great story, great comedy, great heart, and it was just overall a great movie.
1618;I really did truly love this movie, and during it I could connect with the characters.
1619;It took place in Japan and there was one scene where Scarlett Johansson is going sightseeing was a very beautiful scene because I was able to see Japan the way another person might see it.
1620;Charlotte also is upset that John is spending alot of time with Kelly, another American who already knows and likes John.
1621;Bob stays in town longer to appear on a tv talk show and they become friends, while also becoming a little more happier in life.
1622;It is a mixture of comedy and drama.
1623;But I want to talk about the very last scene.
1624;It is the last scene with Bob and Charlotte together in Japan and Bob whispers something in her ear.
1625;My feeling for it are very thoughtful, and the more I think about this movie, the more I like it.
1626;The deluxe Park Hyatt Tokyo provides the backdrop for this quirky film about the evolving relationship between Bob Harris, a world.
1627;The scenes dealing with the communication barriers, while comically effective, actually feel authentic, not condescending.
1628;Now that a few months have elapsed, I can appreciate the movie more for its vivid sense of imagery and atmosphere, which does go a long way to compensate for the threadbare plot.
1629;The excellent soundtrack helps as well.
1630;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson perform their roles as Bob and Charlotte in an almost improvisational manner, effortlessly achieving a genuine chemistry.
1631;core dialogue was unscripted for Bill Murray.
1632;Some great things about the movie though,(and this is why I cannot give it a 1 star) is the great, expressive film work.
1633;The photography really captured Japan through the eyes of a Foreign American.
1634;who incidently helped in making this film.
1635;If you love independent films and want a brilliant story that shows the ins and outs of an industrial asian city.
1636;There are many great things that I can say about this film, but I will keep it short.
1637;This is the most overall enjoyable film I have seen in years and maybe ever.
1638;A subtle smile appeared on my face from the first shot (not just because of the pink panties.)
1639;Sometimes less is more, and the sparse dialogue and restrained performances allow this picture to resonate with powerful emotion.
1640;this reinvention of Murray (which started in Rushmore, was polished in The Royal Tenenbaums and will be furthered in The Life Aquatic.
1641;Thank you Wes Anderson) is a marvel to watch and through Lost in Translation is worthy of the Best Actor Oscar.
1642;Scarlett Johansson, though here in a lead role, should be marketed as a Best Supporting Actress and is the best candidate in that field.
1643;She has been great since The Horse Whisperer, was excellent in Ghost World and is a double threat this year along with her performance in Girl With The Pearl Earring.
1644;She will receive three nominations come the end of this month.
1645;The first for Best Picture as one of the film's producers, another for Best Director, and one more for Best Original Screenplay (which she deserves to win).
1646;The script is smart enough that the characters don't cheapen their relationship by making it Hollywood and sleeping together (a choice rarely seen in contemporary films).
1647;In general, the acting was excellent, the photography was good, and the script was mediocre.
1648;As an example, for those of you who have been to New York City, compare the real thing with the city presented to you in the movie Seven , which plays to every stereotype purveyed by those who have never visited of crime, perversity and destitution.
1649;shabu , which is delicious, by the way), to the pronunciation of the locals' English.
1650;Rather, it is a window into the character's own youth (read: childishness) and inexperience, coupled with her deep unhappiness with her own life.
1651;I fully endorse a number of other reviewers who have mentioned that a normal person would be interested in the adventure of Japan, of seeing new things, and of interacting with new people.
1652;Almost every Japanese person he met in this movie was going out of their way to be kind and make him feel at home, but he often made fun of them.
1653;This is the kind of behavior that is often considered cool in the West, but you won't find much of it in Japan, thank goodness.
1654;I realize that most of the acting and character.
1655;A small example of this is the scene in the strip.
1656;it's funny to me, i use amazon a lot and love reading the reviews, sometimes good sometimes bad.
1657;for this flick i find a mix of reviews some people loved it some people hated it.
1658;I found this movie totally empty of plot, of interest, of good acting, and of good direction.
1659;I recommend anyone who is interested to save their money.
1660;The cinematography, the story, the pace, the actors, the setting, the palpable loneliness and connection between two people, all the things that DIDN'T happen.
1661;i loved loved loved this movie.
1662;Although there were some slow moments and seconds (of what seemed forever) of blank shots where the character would just be sitting down and staring out a window, I still enjoyed this film.
1663;It was nice to see Bill Murray on the big screen once again.
1664;His scenes with the Japanese were hilarious, and the lost and confused looks on his face were priceless.
1665;Scarlett Johansson is such a great actress compared to other young (and even older) actresses these days.
1666;Murray and Johansson make a good on screen team and their actions toward each other seem so natural.
1667;the best part of the movie was that there were almost no people in the theater.
1668;we walked up to the ticket window behind a girl's.
1669;there are plenty of good reviews on the internet.
1670;the viewer is FORCED to interpret what is said by reading the characters' eyes and their body language.
1671;if you can interpret what they communicate through other means than the spoken word, you will know the secret of life.
1672;verbal communication, Lost In Translation is akin to those films that leave you wanting more, but satisfaction is attained through the memory of the good times and replay.
1673;I found _Lost in Translation_ to be a poignant and revealing story about an intimate connection that two strangers make thousands of miles from home.
1674;Bill Murray was perfect for the role of Bob Harris, the aging movie star
1675;place, but when they find each other, a deep bond forms, and the two actors had a nice chemistry on screen.
1676;The movie was also enhanced by a great soundtrack.
1677;Stellar performances by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson make the movie all the more charming.
1678;Subtle humor that will leave you giggling throughout.
1679;If you have a soul and you appreciate and enjoy movies ( as an art form and a way of telling real stories) you will love this movie.
1680;With so many sad movies about sexual exploitation floating around, it's a refresher to see two nice, interesting people exchange such powerful, passionate, platonic gifts during a brief, innocent time, without taking advantage of or hurting one another, and leaving one another happier and stronger.
1681;sofia Coppola's complex, beautiful, diverse sensibilities drench each frame with implications.
1682;Like all perfect movies, this one is rich, deep, lavishly.
1683;She attends masterfully to imagery, editing, framing, character, dialogue, tension, narrative, symbol, improvisation, serendipity.

1687;differences in gender, age, social class, lifestyle, goals, values, interests, backgrounds, personalities.
1688;Like any great lover, Copolla brings knowledge, appreciation, honesty, and a creative, playful intimacy to the peculiar amusements and benefits of relating to the Japanese.
1689;Japanese culture has its many endearing and frustrating quirks, as do all cultures
1690;bill Murray's unique talents are all on glorious display, as are Scarlett Johannsen's equally bounteous ones, which have an umplumbable feel to them.
1691;The idea behind this movie is that a formerly great actor goes to Japan for $2 million to be in a Suntori whiskey commercial.
1692;That pretty much describes this movie.
1693;I was simply astounded by how well screenwriter/director Sophia Coppola was able to make a film that was both funny and poignant at the same time.
1694;The characters were deftly well.
1695;There were moments during the film when I thought the character of Bob Harris was strictly written for the constantly funny Bill Murray.
1696;For example, the brief scene where Bob goes golfing made me think of Bill in the hilarious Caddyshack.
1697;I found the storyline of two strangers in a completely foreign country and somehow connecting with each other quite interesting.
1698;The writing in the film was compelling, and the score even more compelling.
1699;Bill Murray was simply hilarious in this film.
1700;I loved it when he had an encounter with a hooker in the beginning in the movie and when he was on the stairmaster.
1701;Pure physical comedy at its finest.
1702;I love the sarcastic tone he uses in one of their conversations.
1703;Another great move on Sophia Coppola's part was having Scarlett Johansson play the disenchanted Charlotte.
1704;Although his role in the film is a bit brief, I enjoyed Giovanni Ribsi's role as the spouse who neglects Charlotte for his career as a rock and roll photographer.
1705;Other than that scene, I loved Lost in Translation.
1706;I truly got to see Bill shine as an actor in this film, both as a comedian as well as a drmatic actor.
1707;Scarlett Johanson also put in a wonderful performance in the film.
1708;Kudos to Sophia Coppola for the excellent writing and directing she contributed.
1709;The love I have for this film.
1710;As you watch this, you start to feel and fall in love with the characters.
1711;It's a movie you watch once a year and it's like you are hanging out with them again.
1712;Like you are part of the group.
1713;The sound is great too.
1714;It has 5.1 Dolby Digital and a DTS track.
1715;Sofia Coppola has written one of the best screenplays in the last 15 years.
1716;It the feeling of leading up to that first kiss when love is at it's purest form.
1717;bill Murray keeps demonstrating that he is one of the most versatile and talented actors of our time.
1718;His dry wit matches perfectly in this melancholy film about a man drifting in a sea of loneliness.
1719;Together, they share in each other's quiet despair while denying that there are romantic feelings brewing.
1720;this is a beatiful story of star.
1721;crossed lovers with an ending that will keep you guessing.
1722;The cinematography alone justifies the movie for me.
1723;The film is understated and quiet.
1724;If you have any sense of patience, allowing a film to organically unfold, you will be rewarded.
1725;bill Murray is great, playing what I think is essentially himself.
1726;It is just a quiet, sweet meditative little movie.
1727;Probably the great reviews and excess hype will work against it now.
1728;So we have a good.
1729;natured and affectionate chuckle at their expense.
1730;The first time I saw this movie I enjoyed it, but things didn't really connect up for me.
1731;i now find this film to be brilliant, moving, and uncommon.
1732;It establishes it's theme immediately and adds layer after layer as it moves along.
1733;You'll read a lot of retellings of plot and descriptions of things people found comical.
1734;that is, anything more than the surface of existence.
1735;They may have the funds to stay in a wonderful hotel, but there is nothing intrinsically wonderful (or terrible) about their lives.
1736;There is no joy in their careers, and they are both in marriages that have settled into passionless routine with people whose priorities lie elsewhere.
1737;Charlotte searches for something that she can connect with (religion, tradition, culture, etc.)
1738;It's this shared burden that makes it so touching when they are half.
1739;This seems to be the hit movie of the year.
1740;It is a very good film though about the relationship between a B actor, Bill Murray, and a newlywed, Scarlett Johnasson, and the way they spend their sleepless nights in Tokyo.
1741;It is beautifully shot by youngster Sofia Coppola following in her talented father's footsteps.
1742;Murray and Johansson's relationship is exciting, intelligent, and incredibly plutonic.
1743;Oh its a SENSITIVE movie about a platonic relationship .
1744;Any idiot can have a platonic relationship this exciting.
1745;Largely a plotless story of time, place, impression and acquaintance, a strong mood is built of subtle images, a stellar and fitting soundtrack and superb cast.
1746;Sofia Coppola has created a film which is visually appealing, bringing to life the overwhelming nature of Tokyo as well as the stark contrast of cultures (culture shock).
1747;With excellent writing from Coppola and excellent performances from Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, the relationship is both believable and refreshing.
1748;This is a beautiful movie about communication.
1749;If you are in for an emotional and thoughtful movie I would very much recommend it.
1750;It was one of the top 5 movies last year.
1751;Sofia Coppola has created a remarkably human work that touches on the very connections of the human soul.
1752;It is an incredibly deep, but easily enjoyable and relatable film.
1753;Much of the beauty of this film lies in its exploration of the bond between Bob and Charlotte.
1754;The film succeeds due in part to its focus solely on this relationship over a brief period of time.
1755;the film is also effective because of the superb performances of its two main actors.
1756;Bill Murray was nominated for an Oscar for his performance, and deserves to win.
1757;He puts on a stunning performance that is both sardonically funny, and touching.
1758;The young Scarlett Johansson is shockingly talented, as shown in this world.
1759;That is alright, however, as it allowed it to win best picture there.
1760;It is a drama that will make you laugh a little, but it is still a drama.
1761;It is certainly one of the top films this year, and in fact one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1762;It is truly original, and I cannot think of any real comparison for it.
1763;Charlotte and Bob help each other through their unique crises and while they are with each other even seem happy.
1764;It is this connection that the film explores so brilliantly.
1765;It shows us the weakness of these characters, and their need for something to help them through it.
1766;Sofia Coppola has created a masterpiece.
1767;This movie is hilarious and thought provoking all at the same time.
1768;This may be one of his best roles of all time.
1769;You will know you understood the movie when it makes you think and rerun it in your mind over and over again just absorb every little bit of absurdity, hilarity, and subtle nuances.
1770;1) Well, the grouches are quite right.
1771;lIT is an experience film that is mismarketed as a Bill Murray comedy
1772;There's every chance this bombs at home, but in a theater, in the dark, with great sound and everybody shutting up, it works.
1773;that first shot sets the tone for LIT.
1774;It's a classic use of the medium, to show the huge gap between what's said and what's seen.
1775;Bob and Charlotte are wonderfully quiet and accepting of each other from the get go.
1776;After they meet, when they spend time on their own, they wander wordlessly and beautifully alone: Bob golfs by himself with Mt. Fuji in the distance, and Mt. Fuji floats by Charlotte on a Kyoto bullet train, as she heads off to visit another temple.
1777;hop/dream pop soundtrack (the best since Trainspotting, High Art,and Ms. Coppola's last film, the Virgin Suicides), and the electrifyingly silent ending.
1778;(Oh, and if you take into account EVERY image of Japanese people in this film.
1779;japanese film, and easier to see it for what it is: an outsider's POV of a few silly and sublime experiences in an unfamiliar culture).
1780;It exists on its own lifeline, and if you're willing to tag along, you'll be rewarded with an engrossing and endearing experience.
1781;There is no hidden message behind the lush visuals and beautiful performances by the actors.
1782;of his job, of his life, and everyone around him.
1783;Charlotte is a recent Yale graduate who is dissatisfied with her marriage and her direction in life.
1784;Meeting in the hotel bar, Bob and Charlotte slowly and gently fall in love, coming to terms with their own unhappiness with their lives.
1785;sofia Coppola would've been a great music video director.
1786;The visuals focus in and out of eachother, slowly panning over the amazing Japanese landscapes, both in the city and the country side.
1787;It builds up a kind of sympathy from the viewer on Charlotte being married to her callous and rude husband, John.
1788;But she keeps it gentle and subtle, which is obviously not for everyone.
1789;But that's why it's so good.
1790;seeing it in the theater makes it more enveloping.
1791;Lost in Translation is like the girl you're in love with, when she takes her hand and brushes your face.
1792;Just a small, simple touch.
1793;If you're a person who can find infinite happiness in an act like that, go run to see this movie.
1794;this is one of those films.
1795;one of the most magical things about this film is how Tokyo shines brightly throughout the film.
1796;The dialogue, the music, everything moves slowly at a deliberate pace.
1797;The viewer is able to really take in the city that surrounds the characters.
1798;Sofia's Coppola direction almost seems delicate.
1799;Much of the soundtrack underscores the precise rhythms of the city.
1800;lost In Translation gives a fleeting glimpse into an intriguing city and its very interesting world.
1801;While I agree that Bill Murray did an amazing acting job, overall, this movie rates a D. from me.
1802;I am still unimpressed with Sofia Coppola's directing talents, tho I can see that there is definately potential.
1803;Some people say that this movie is about two Americans getting lost and lonely in some totally unfamiliar and mysterious place, and Tokyo is a perfect place for that as a background.
1804;This is a good observation I completely agree with.
1805;living in US for many years, I understand that this movie portraits a very real feeling some Americans would have while visiting Japan, and I even share that same feeling to some extent.
1806;That makes some Japanese feel that they are regarded as overly mysterious people, although there is no bad intention here (and the director even pays some respect to Japanese culture).
1807;Sofia Coppola follows up her lovely film The Virgin Suicides with this gem of a film, Lost In Translation.
1808;One thing I love is the way it's shot in a very realistic, almost documentary.
1809;The characters feel like real people, not merely big stars who are just collecting a paycheck.
1810;The dialog feels truly genuine.
1811;That's what impressed me the most the first time I saw it.
1812;Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray are truly perfect in their roles as two lonely souls who find each other amid the hustle and bustle of Tokyo.
1813;The film tells us much about the characters using visuals.
1814;Bill Murray gives a splendid performance as the weary Bob Harris, who finds a real friend in Scarlett Johansson's lonely Charlotte.
1815;Sofia Coppola's direction is perfect.
1816;The backdrop of Tokyo forms a wonderful canvas for this story, and it is beautifully photographed.
1817;lost In Translation is a wonderful film that is sure to delight viewers who are tired of phony Hollywood romance.
1818;It keeps things fresh, original, honest and genuine.
1819;It is truly one of the best films of 2003.
1820;Probably because the story line is much similar to one of my life stories.
1821;appropriative communication the two main characters have in the movie the best way to get to understand each.
1822;It's sometimes interesting to go back to a film, that was on it's initial release.
1823;hyped with praise (and criticism) for an independent film, that truly brought director Sofia Coppola, to the attention of the rest of the world.
1824;For all the awards and nominations that the film received.
1825;bob represents a complicated, yet intriguing character, from which she admires and then gradually begins to not only identify, but affectionately warm to.
1826;It's a absorbing look at how two initially disparate characters, connect not only verbally, but emotionally as well, first through the loneliness of their environment, and then striking up an unlikely friendship and strong affection for each other.
1827;It's a perfectly stylised illustration how sometimes meeting certain people at the right place and right time, can and does, have to power to completely change or alter the individuals perceptions.
1828;one of the most impressive things about this film, is the cinematography.
1829;of Japan, and how for a such a wildly populated and bustling city is portray.
1830;The bright neon lights of Japan, represent one aspect of the city (a rapidly developing city).
1831;And in this aspect it's one of the triumphs of Sofia's direction.
1832;And it's the way that Sophia skilfully brings all this incidental elements, into a hugely satisfying whole, to makes this film as her finest work to date.
1833;How such uneventful subject matter on paper, is generally made for riveting viewing, it's also one of those films that rewards multiple viewings.
1834;sure the storyline wont become clearer, as it's a very straightforward plot.
1835;for what is consider one of the finest indie films, over the last few years, this film has certainly had its detractors.
1836;it may not change your perspective on the decline of outstanding films being released over the years, but in the world of independent cinema and distinguished films, it might be considered a small gem.
1837;The scenery of Japan is interesting to look at.
1838;There were some (few) funny situations and lines in the movie but not enough to recommend this movie.
1839;Scarlett Johansson does a good acting job with her character with what little she has to work with (lack of great dialogue and script).
1840;If you are the arty (art.
1841;It should at LEAST be interesting and maybe have something to say or have an impact on you in some way that you can't forget it.
1842;Entertainment value is definitely very subjective and everybody has his or her own tastes.
1843;This movie is NOT a great movie
1844;I really wanted to see this film.
1845;The film is brilliantly acted and it is really funny in places.
1846;It was, if anything, Oscar material.
1847;Bill Murray and I liked Sophia Coppola's last film .
1848;This movie is great for someone who hasn't visited Japan, but want to or plans to.
1849;The movie is more like a well done excerpt on the film crew's journey in Japan rather than a movie which stands on its own.
1850;it was more of a filler to make the movie last longer.
1851;Scarlett Johansen gets great reviews for this.
1852;she poses great at the beginning.
1853;The Japanese imagery in the movie is impeccable.
1854;when they show the pond, it's breathtaking.
1855;I watched this film with my family and our neighbors.
1856;in the end, I found it endearing in the manner of Snow Falling on Cedars .
1857;a beautiful film that connects in a subtle way if you give it a chance.
1858;It's a film best enjoyed quietly: alone or with a lover snuggled by a fire with a bottle of wine .
1859;i think this movie portrays Americans pretty well tho in a way.
1860;She seems refined and intelligent on one hand, yet makes rash choices (husband, Murray) on the other.
1861;The bright lights of Tokyo look great .
1862;best supporting features: This is my favorite movie .
1863;It's one of several honest, revealing moments in a casual interview with the duo shot on a Roman rooftop.
1864;shabu joint in the middle of a take.
1865;I really wanted to like it.
1866;I love Bill Murray's acting but this movie never gets started.
1867;but it's still no fun to watch.
1868;It is a strangely compelling flick but in the same vein as a still life tableau.
1869;With this in mind, it might be more satisfying to put the scenes from the movie on a PC as a screensaver!
1870;It had good reviews so I was expecting something special.
1871;The good part was you had a feeling of being in Tokyo.
1872;director Sofia's Coppola's Lost in Translation gets your attention .
1873;she's no more emotionally mature than he is.
1874;the comedy in the film comes from Bob's interaction with Japanese culture (sometimes verging on clich ).
1875;bill Murray as Bob deserves the Oscar for showing all this with his weary face.
1876;up emotions, but the act of growing up as we watch.
1877;even the American lounge singer in the hotel is more of a karaoke singer than a New York chanteuse.
1878;when they have to leave each other, Bob goes home to his family, while Charlotte walks into the Tokyo crowds, alone but confident.
1879;This is an outstanding film.
1880;Like plunging into the deep end of the swimming pool.
1881;Lost in Translation is a beautiful film.
1882;It's an incredibly pleasant surprise to find a film that doesn't feel the need to tell a big story, but instead to explore the nuances in a small and interesting relationship.
1883;the soundtrack is excellent, the cinematography is gorgeous and the characters are incredibly rich.
1884;This was one of the three best movies I saw last year.
1885;Sofia Coppola may not have been a great actress, but she certainly is a great director.
1886;This is a film that gets better every time you watch it.
1887;Anyone who has ever been alone in a city, or in love with someone who is out of reach will appreciate this film, especially as you watch it for the second time.
1888;And that, ladies and gentlemen, is that!
1889;Oh yes, the film buffs out there will tell you all about its gentle charm, its understated yet magnificent acting and its heart.
1890;painting done by his daughter posted up on the refrigerator, with you knowing the whole time that your boss's daughter is a full.
1891;my brother saisd that this was a good movie so i went to see it and do you know what my brother was right!!!!
1892;even tho you dont know my brother you should still take his advise and see this movie because it is a good movie.
1893;Murray is rich and famous, but unhappy: well, he cheats on his wife!
1894;I liked this movie when I saw it, but felt that some of the melodrama was a bit over the top.
1895;it's real after a few days in Tokyo.
1896;I love Tokyo, but it can be very.
1897;this movie does a great job of using the unsettling effect of Tokyo exposure to intensify the characters' personal conflicts.
1898;I can sum it up by saying that those who loved it are probably impressed by a human interest / dialogue film with a wonderful premise, and those who hated it probably wanted more characterization and plot.
1899;the best part of the movie for me was the relationship between the two of them.
1900;It seemed very familiar, and I identified with her greatly.
1901;There are a lot of reasons why 20.
1902;i recommend watching this film without expecting to be blown away by anything about it.
1903;This movie is one of those rare films that is perfect.
1904;it is one of the most beautiful love stories ever.
1905;Their love is love in the truest sense of the word, pure and real.
1906;this movie is also VERY funny, but in a very subtle way.
1907;Bill Murray is marvelous, so natural.
1908;The humor is based on our misunderstandings of the Japanese culture, and their misunderstandings about ours.
1909;This film does bitter sweet and introspection and character growth very well.
1910;In college, you will have the option of taking a course on creative writing.
1911;In this class, if the teacher is any good, you will learn the difference between mass.
1912;market popular fiction and true art.
1913;Need I make connections to film?Many others have given good reviews, so I will not re.
1914;i liked the tender, open.
1915;Don't get me wrong, every once in awhile I like to watch a brainless action movie too, or (even more seldom) a sappy romance, but most of the time I like my movies smart, and Lost in Translation is a smart movie.
1916;All I have to say about that is: it's the 21st century, y'all, and it's time to grow up.
1917;I thought this was a very intelligent, sensitive portrait of two people who the outside world would view as successful but who feel very lost and alone.
1918;This is a great movie, it makes you think and it stays with you long after you've seen it.
1919;Definitely worth watching, but you won't get much out of it unless your I. q. is higher than your body temperature.
1920;The actors are usually wonderful in what they do(LOVED SJ in Girl With the Pearl Earring), but even they need something to work with.
1921;intelligent, similar in some ways to another movie I Heart Huckabees.
1922;The popcorn was more interesting.
1923;Ms. Coppola has accomplished a remarkable feat.
1924;Second, she gives an example of detachment and the acute introspection that can result.
1925;Anyone who has travelled extensively, and faced the long nights away from home will recognize the way the mind works in such instances, will know that there are times when one is uncertain of understanding oneself, let alone the foreign tongues on all sides of you.
1926;This film is a work of stark originality.
1927;this work has the distinct advantage of occupying a uniquely creative, first position.
1928;The movie played more like a documentary.
1929;It would have been a quite decent documentary if it were one.
1930;which is usually good for him, but I found myself just waiting for the film to finish .
1931;After all the awards that this movie won I thought it would be worth watching.
1932;She has shaped a small but excellent cast into a top.
1933;notch movie, one of the best of the year.
1934;interact much with their foreign surroundings, so this movie can focus on the characters themselves, and their interactions with each other.
1935;is the main focus of the movie, and it is very entertaining to see it unfold.
1936;this movie gets my highest recommendation.
1937;But for most people, Lost in Translation will be a very worthwhile experience.
1938;this movie also captures the essence of Asia.
1939;Asia is a rich and powerful place of conflicting social forces that pull hard between centuries of tradition and the emerging modern/techno society.
1940;the film's imagery is very rich.
1941;as a total package, it's one terrific film.
1942;I feel that the Oscar nomination is now firmly an economic device that has abandoned all sense of artistic merit.
1943;I am embarrassed that this was given an Oscar nomination and profoundly apologize to the nation of Japan as a whole.
1944;That this is interesting because it's barely competent?
1945;(There are even several Japanese films that explore similar personal crises with grace and power.)
1946;Bill Murray has a dozen better performances under his belt
1947;But it was an art.
1948;sequences: one in the studio with the commercial director, the other in the hotel room with the call.
1949;The Japanese actors were right on the mark, and together with the situations, they provided perfect setups for Murray to do his thing.
1950;come on, American films are a lot better than this.
1951;If you enjoyed this movie, you must have a sorry life.
1952;This movie grabs at something fundamental about life.
1953;the awards it has gotten are purely the movie industry's way of rewarding its insiders and they make a mockery of the supposed integrity behind the awards process.
1954;bill Murray has done some great work
1955;And, to be a famous director's daughter!
1956;As much as I wanted to love this movie, I couldn't.
1957;They meet in the hotel bar and soon develop a surprising friendship.
1958;I must admit that the scenery in this movie is breathtaking.
1959;I waited and waited for this movie to pick up the pace and it never did.
1960;The scenes where Murray is filming the whiskey commercials are also amusing.
1961;If you have seen the trailer you have seen all the funny parts, few they may be.
1962;Like American Beauty, this movie is a peek into the heart of incestuous Hollywood and it isn't pretty.
1963;The beauty of this movie lies in what doesn't happen.
1964;Murray and Scarlett Johansen were perfectly cast .
1965;The movie won Best Original Screenplay.
1966;How can it be?Maybe the name Coppola has a lot do do with it.
1967;My girlfriend and I both agreed on this one.
1968;This could have been a good film.
1969;I enjoyed this movie immensely when it first started hitting theaters, and find it just as enjoyable watching it at home.
1970;The full Japanese variety/talk show segment is hilarious, but subtitles would've helped those of us who don't understand Japanese.
1971;a movie like this deserves more, and I just hope that there is a Special Edition planned
1972;Just about anything is better than this one.
1973;A great injustice to truly great writers directors and actors.
1974;My friends drug me out to see it, so I just went along for the ride.
1975;I decided to give it another chance, and it was indeed a film that pulls you in.
1976;This is a film that must be viewed a few times to really be appreciated.
1977;She appears to be neglected as a wife, and yearns for her husband's attention, and eventually, anyone's attention.
1978;She not only enjoys the modern, contemporary side, but respects and appreciates the ancient and traditonal customs as well.
1979;This movie should speak volumes to everyone, because we have, or will experience being Lost in Translation at some point in our lives.
1980;We will be Bob Harris or Charlotte, and will deal with our journeys in our own unique ways.
1981;Sometime, I feel like Bob Harris, and can definitely identify with him, but in my own way.
1982;the two begin to explore the city's karaoke bars, districts and parties.
1983;One would probably interpret that there is something sexual about to occur here due to the chemistry between Bill and Charlotte, but that doesn't happen.
1984;The ending is very special, as Bob, who could not wait to leave Japan at the beginning of the movie, suddenly finds himself dreading the trip back to the states and leaving Charlotte behind.
1985;I also think the location adds to the mystique of this great film.
1986;Even in this recording of a moment of her childhood, I heard the thoughts of a brilliant young girl.
1987;There are so many layers to this film that it's almost as enjoyable to realize them, as it is to watch them unfold.
1988;And the music is brilliant and perfect.
1989;First, the directors choice to open the movie with a young beautiful rear end relaxing in a room and than the trasitions to an old man in a taxi cab.
1990;Third I like this movie deviate from the tradition continuity.
1991;Everything about Japan contribute greatly to this movie.
1992;I will admit that I am one of those people that generally go for a movie that is action packed, funny, and essentially in your face with the message they are trying to convey.
1993;This movie is not obvious about the message it is trying to get accross but as a person who hates to think about movies, this one required some thought and I enjoyed it even more because of that.
1994;this movie was moving, beautiful, thought provoking and just all around enjoyable.
1995;if you enjoy serious movies (as opposed to Hollywood big.
1996;Lost in Translation is a lovely film about two people who forge a friendship based on being lonely in each other's presence.
1997;The film is billed as romantic comedy, but is really about friendship, and is tinged much with sorrow as it is with humor.
1998;Bill Murray is convincing as a world.
1999;Scarlett Johansen is exceptional as a recently married, recently graduated philosophy major with a husband more in love with his photography career than with her.
2000;a beautiful, understated film that doesn't try to do too much.
2001;Lush cinematography you can almost feel and an amazingly nuanced performance from Bill Murray would be enough reason to see this film, but you get so much more.
2002;I like films set in Asia in general, and Japan in particular.
2003;with a setting, in what is to most Americans, an exotic locale (Tokyo) you would think there would at least be some beautiful scenery.
2004;Bill Murray's character (Bob Harris) is a middle.
2005;she has much more studying and much more work to do before she can even be called a competent film.
2006;maker, much less a great one.
2007;Others here talk about the Japanese scenery being important.
2008;Still others about how clever , slow.
2009;the truth people, is that this type of film is the type that thinks it is really clever, and the people who made it are very very pleased with themselves.
2010;Came a day early so very cool.
2011;lost in translation is one of my favorite movies of all time just amazing and it was filmed in japan so beautiful backgrounds and city lights.
2012;It's so good to finally see Bill Murray in something good again.
2013;Many people dubbed this 'A great film about nothing' and I would say they hit the nail on the head.
2014;most films, great as they are, never seem to escape the realm of 'Film' while I'm watching them.
2015;overall it's just a truly lovely film and anyone who likes anything should like it!
2016;Clearly people are very divided over this film, but I think that's what makes it work so well for those who really enjoyed it.
2017;This is not the type of movie that usually grabs my attention, but I loved it.
2018;This is a work of art.
2019;Of course, the story is important.
2020;Sofia Coppola has done a great job here.
2021;More than that, this film is about the beauty, sadness, and the most important, but fleeting, moments in your life.
2022;The opening shot of this film during the titles pretty much sets the direction of this 'little film'
2023;Notwithstanding Sofia's chief interest in this film, it's worth seeing at least once, for Murray's straight man to Japan's parade of clowns.
2024;The Virgin Suicides was a solid, though overrated, directorial debut for Sofia Coppola.
2025;Moody, ethereal and meaningful, it presented a promising director and one to follow closely.
2026;is somewhat enticing and could lead to a good introspective drama, still this cinematic experience drags too much and never seems to take off.
2027;Bill Murray plays, well, Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johansson is cute but far from excellent on her role.
2028;crafted atmosphere and a very good soundtrack (Air (again), Death in Vegas, Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine`s Kevin Shields, and many others).
2029;like style), but a movie should tell an absorbing story with memorable characters, and this one just falls flat.
2030;I`ll admit that it`s pretty and enchanting at parts, yet some nice visuals and neons aren`t enough to provide a (good) movie.
2031;I had the fortune to lived in Japan (Tokio, Nagoya, Kyoto and Osaka) for one month, and enjoyed the style of life of the japan people.
2032;This movie is reflex of that style of life, not totally, but the atmosphere is magic, with the street and some interior places.
2033;Great movie, amazing direction, sweet acting.
2034;Oh yes, to all those who whine that the reason it's unappreciated is because it's above our understanding .
2035;for kicks and maybe a few laughs .
2036;The rest of us will keep an eye out for a movie of substance.
2037;Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful and memorible films you are ever going to see.
2038;But for those who like out of the ordinary, beautiful, and isolated feelings in film, than you will love this film.
2039;The ending is one of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen, and it's not in the typical sense.
2040;Just the sheer emotion is enough to make your heart melt.
2041;I'm not a Bill Murray fan, but his performance is exceptionally sensitive and moving.
2042;This is an interesting movie, far more so than I'd anticipated.
2043;Very well handled, good direction, excellent cinematography and a puckish score.
2044;They temporatily shelve their ennui, and learn to live a little.
2045;No, but two great actors, better than Spacey.
2046;buscemi, made this movie cozy and entertaining.
2047;Each shot of this movie is beautiful.
2048;When it's over, you feel warm and fuzzy.
2049;I found the behind the scenes making of the movie particularly interesting.
2050;Rewatching the movie is like reliving a good dream.
2051;I just wanted to quickly say that this is a beautiful movie, one in which its strength lies in the visual and emotional aspects.
2052;Definitely on of the best movies I have ever seen, and I can't understand why some people don't like it.
2053;I am moved every time I watch it.
2054;This is an Oscar contender, people!!
2055;It must be good (and it is .
2056;to understand, give it a rest.
2057;Watching grass grow is more fun.
2058;And there's nothing adolescent about that insight, or the beauty with which Miss Coppola puts it on screen.
2059;struck to be a good bet for long.
2060;both of them give each other some strength to face what they must face.
2061;There is plenty of plot, plenty of point for the intelligent viewer, and a hundred times as much characterisation as in most commercial films I've seen in the past decade.
2062;coppola's judgement in all aspects, from a script with lots of spaces for mood to her handling of actors, is assured and mature.
2063;And Scarlett Johansson is both vulnerable and likeable.
2064;The film is beautiful to look at too.
2065;For feeling and thinking viewers it's a rare and beautiful godsend.
2066;the reason so many critics voted this a terrific movie is simple.
2067;But at least for this viewer it seems a one.
2068;One aspect that may be considered comedic in nature is the seeming put.
2069;As for the performances Murray and Johansson make the best of what little they have to work with and FINALLY in the last 20 minutes we begin to care about them as people.
2070;One of the most moving movies I have ever seen, right up there with modern classics like Paris, Texas and American Beauty.
2071;a movie I intend to see many times.
2072;And Scarlett Johansson performs well for a new.
2073;comer to the screen, but the real beauty in this film lies in its pacing.
2074;On top of that, the film boasts an impressive soundtrack
2075;You have to appreciate character depth and real storytelling to love this movie.
2076;This is a beautiful movie about two people, thrust into worlds they don't fully understand (both Japan and their personal lives), who form an unlikely, yet special bond.
2077;It's well worth giving a shot.
2078;Scarlett Johansson was beautiful and did a better acting job in Girl with the Pearl Earring .
2079;Let me say that this is one of my top 5 movies.
2080;Bill should have won the Oscar and Scarlett is a living doll.
2081;This has the best opening shot of any movie I've ever seen.
2082;Murray here is Murray in several ways, his cynical nature comes out a lot and that's always funny.
2083;As long as you're ready for a s. l. o. w movie, you will probably enjoy this.
2084;best part: Murray on the Japanese talk show.
2085;on second thoughts, DO make me laugh.
2086;moving piece of mood music.
2087;Yes, if you keep in mind that it's about loneliness, etc. and there's a great performance by Bill Murray, and you have a couple of hours to kill without wanting any recompense, go ahead and watch it.
2088;It does succeed in immersing you in its molasses.
2089;sure, Murray might have turned in a great performance.
2090;This is a great film to watch alone
2091;Sofia Coppola's screenplay, which rightly won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, geniously integrates two people into a relationship who are not only alienated in the location they are in, but they are also alienated from their families.
2092;By doing this, you, as was I, will be fully engaged in this wonderfully subtle, oft humorous and emotional film, the best of 2003.
2093;Sometimes you have to be patient with your people watching, and this is the kind of movie that fills that roll.
2094;but they are actually a lot deeper.
2095;i found something profound here.
2096;Ms. Coppolla hit on something here.
2097;maybe it's everyones middle age angst.
2098;Why don't they just create a let's give Bill Murray an Oscar award for being such a swell guy Oscar category and be done with it.
2099;I'd heard a lot about it, and had somehow got the impression it was a very worthy movie, something you felt you ought to see.
2100;to my huge surprise and delight I loved it.
2101;She has a wonderful fresh vision.
2102;And the strength of mind to put it on film.
2103;beautifully filmed, sensitively put together.
2104;With such a strong individual vision that you'll either love it or hate it.
2105;life crisis and Charlotte has freshly graduated with no aim in life.
2106;In their isolated states, they find each other in the most unlikely place, Japan, for comfort and the strength to carry on.
2107;i love movies and Im not really picky.
2108;A film that divides opinion is a film to see.
2109;Great performances, direction and cinematography, a fresh view of what it's like to live in a bubble within another culture, a satirical eye on career arcs and marriage in the 'creative' professions (acting, photography, nightclub singer), a truthful and tender portrayal of middle age, and of friendships that are deep, temporary, and platonic .
2110;She pays no attention to her husband and is jealous of his friends.
2111;Sure its funny, the Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson (who did fine) are our surrogates, and they built entirely at the expense of the ill.
2112;But by then I wanted the well made, well acted, pretty movie to end.
2113;Like Storytelling, well sure I don't like those people.
2114;happy Together reminds me of a lost in foreign country movie that wasn't so mean.
2115;in other words it's a movie you gotta think about.
2116;so don't go in with high expectations.You might hate it, or you might just love it, like I did!It captures that feeling of drifting apart, feeling out of sync with the rest of the world so perfectly, you'll get chills, I swear.
2117;bill Murray envelops his usual slapstick sarcasm with a warmth and wisdom.
2118;his performance is absolutely superb.
2119;scarlett Johansson is a beautiful young woman, and her acting is lovely.
2120;the on screen relationship between the two actors is the centerpiece of the movie.
2121;and a touching and beautiful thing to behold.
2122;all in all, this is a cinematic marvel I won't soon forget.
2123;and why should I forget a film this poignant,subtle,wistful, funny, and romantic?LOVE IT
2124;An excellent film of compassion and passion
2125;Let me first say I love great cinema, Peter Greenaway makes brilliant though slow moving cinematic ballets.
2126;the directing is excellent, the script writing is clean, and the scenery is remarkable.
2127;The places the characters visit are simply breathtaking
2128;What a beautiful country . . . my advice?
2129;It's funny and sad and poignant, and I can see why they say Bill Murray is Oscar material.
2130;Five stars, all the way.
2131;time favorites, Groundhog Day (quoted approvingly by Roger Ebert as one of the most spiritual films of our times).
2132;He does a great job, as does his opposite, Scarlett Johansson.
2133;Sophie Coppola's direction was outstanding.
2134;As the movie progresses you learn that Bill's marriage isn't even a happy one.
2135;Overall, I thought Bill Murray gave a great performance in this film, and in terms of visual aspects I really liked the cinematography.
2136;The best scene in this film is when Bill Murray is at his Whiskey ad shoot.
2137;This film won the Academy Award as best original script.
2138;Scarlett Johanson is the most remarkable point to review, a new promise talented actress so as the homagge to La dolce Vita of Federico Fellini 
2139;a overrated film
2140;I have to say that I loved it very much.
2141;But, somehow I felt love for Japan in this movie.
2142;A big city like Tokyo can easily make you feel like that.
2143;And that feeling is universal.
2144;I really felt for those characters.
2145;Sofia Coppola did a great job putting those feeling out on the screen.
2146;but writer and director Sofia Coppola's story goes wonderfully right.
2147;bob Harris (Bill Murray at his leathery best) is a middle.
2148;the way Bob and Charlotte's tender relationship unfolds is easily one of the most thoughtfully crafted and believable love stories that has flickered across the screen in years.
2149;In the end, we find that the characters knew the answer all along, and it is their ultimate sagacity that allows us to relate to the bittersweet story from start to finish: there is no disbelief to suspend.
2150;No one is going to dispute that modern Japanese pop culture is a riot.
2151;tokyo is William Gibson's muse for good reasons.
2152;and it's OK to say so.
2153;If so, this picture will drive you to drink!
2154;There was a bit of making fun of Japanese people's pronunciation of English words with r 's in them, but that's a rather old joke.
2155;worthy movie and was looking forward to seeing it.
2156;Bill Murray was quietly entertaining and I liked his performance.
2157;to simply laugh and be entertained while mindlessly sitting on your couch with popcorn kernels clinging to your shirt .
2158;The strength of this movie is in its ability to stimulate thought, much like a very good book.
2159;This movie gives a very honest portrayal of two individuals in that situation, at a common time, in a common place, and reminds us that we are never alone in feeling alone.
2160;if you are looking to be dazzled, watch Lord of the Rings.
2161;Bill Murray is a funny guy.
2162;Inventive, great comedic timing, etc, etc.
2163;More of a thoughtful film about two people being lonely in a crowd.
2164;There was the amusing westernization of the Japanese .
2165;again, Murray is a likeable guy.
2166;After rewatching it, I've come to the same conclusion.
2167;This is a really enjoyable, charming film, with great performaces from both lead actors.
2168;i have never seen Bill Murray act so subdued before, and it was refreshing.
2169;a charming, funny and well observed film which is really likeable.
2170;perfect film and the best I've seen so far this year.
2171;It's also Bill Murray's best performance.
2172;It is one of such various and vast emotions that I'm surprised Sofia fits them in to one little movie.
2173;There are moments of great laughter and joviality such as the gift that is sent to Bob's room.
2174;It's an amazing cornucopia of events and emotions.
2175;Either way, Sofia has made a small masterpiece that proves that she did indeed get the filmmaker gene.
2176;For a good time, make it Lost in Translation time.
2177;and won the oscar for best original screenplay.
2178;i sincerely liked this movie and the characters in it, you can just watch this movie and fall asleep with your eyes open, transfixed on the tube.
2179;she hooked up for a little while with a big male star.
2180;She got pulled into his orbit and for the span of time it takes to shoot a film she and he connected, gave each other some comfort, and then irrevocably moved on to their separate universes.
2181;Young Sophia got a chance to get inside big movie star's brain .
2182;and what he thinks is that it's all a bunch of BS, but the money and the women are nice.
2183;Sophia uncovers the reality for us and I for one find it good to know that we are all human.
2184;in her most recent film, Lost in Translation, the Coppola progeny has engineered an aesthetic marvel of a motion picture.
2185;He accepts the proposal and sees the month.
2186;the luster of yesteryear has blended into the horizon for Harris, who extracts whatever grain of esteem he can while crouched over on a barstool slurping the very booze upon which he glosses his signature.
2187;fortunately for Harris, a magnum opus of beauty and charm is around the bend.
2188;The feminine masterwork is a soul.
2189;What a brilliant, brilliant motion picture.
2190;I give the movie a four star rating.
2191;The most impressive element of the movie is how it succeeds in conveying Bob Harris' (Bill Murray) and Charlotte's (Scarlett Johanson) feeling of isolation in a foreign land.
2192;Their relationship is seeded by this mutual alientation and the viewer follows along as they draw strength from each other to make their stay bearable.
2193;Both are at crossroads in the marriage and careers.
2194;bill Murray is completely believable as a broken.
2195;Scarlett Johansson is great as Charlotte.
2196;in short: A good movie.
2197;It made me laugh to hear the script of this movie got an Academy Award!
2198;What's the percentage of American who can speak perfect Japanese (well, gee, more than 10 words in Japanese)?
2199;Great direction, beautiful imagery, top.
2200;notch acting, and a heartwarming story define the masterpiece that is Lost in Translation.
2201;Their time spent together and the relationship that develops conveys the message that this life we're living contains infinite opportunities and possibilities and that as long as we're alive, we have the power to be happy.
2202;watch this one with an open, attentive mind, and prepare to be moved.
2203;I saw Sophia on the Charlie Rose program and liked her very much.
2204;It is more worthy to be an engaging human being than to make a good film.
2205;paced artful film that only sensitive intelligent folks will get.
2206;I mean, Charlotte IS beautiful, but like many beautiful women she is actually VERY sad.
2207;face than usual by Bill Murray .
2208;STILL one of my heroes, despite this venture).
2209;For one thing, they talk funny.
2210;And what they are saying, nobody knows!
2211;They talk on and on, but the funny.
2212;Will someone please make them act normal!
2213;Meanwhile, their encounters continue with the energy of terminally.
2214;breathing motif of wealth does not equal happiness.
2215;Oh yeah, I forgot to mention.
2216;bob has 2 kids back home.
2217;The audience smiles and cries.
2218;Try the absolutely beautiful Hiroshima Mon Amour .
2219;farty you'll ever need, but time well spent.
2220;Try Being John Malkovich by Spike Jonze.
2221;AND it has a great performance by Cameron Diaz!
2222;In most movies we see today, a director shows the movie's characters (whether proactively or reactively) moving the plot forward in such a way that the audience knows at least as much, (usually more,) about what's going on then the characters do.
2223;The thing that makes this movie so fascinating (and to many people, frustrating) is that the characters start off knowing WAYY more about what's going on than you do, and you have to spend most of the movie trying to catch up by learning about who they are.
2224;Well, that is undoubtedly true, but I honestly think she made the grade with this alright movie.
2225;Like two lost children caught in a snowstorm, they find each other, and seek warmth and meaning in their friendship.
2226;A paradox, I know, but true nonetheless.
2227;the film had a minimalistic, beautiful story, played by both actors with insight and understatement.
2228;I give the actors 4.1/2 stars.
2229;My reaction to the cinematography was simply neutral.
2230;As a work of cinema, I give it 1.1/2 stars.
2231;nevertheless, I hope to see more of Sofia Copolla's movies.
2232;I believe that if she studies the fine art of montage, she'll go from being a so.
2233;so director to a great one.
2234;she can start by viewing the works of her father.
2235;A very moving experience and the totally unique and original depiction of a relationship that is elevetated high above the mundane into something spritual.
2236;To describe this movie as merely a great film is to call the Mona Lisa a pretty good painting.
2237;This movie i saw back in september, and watched it again and again, and i still love it.
2238;The relationship between the two main characters was the best i've seen in years.
2239;They had great chemistry on screen (johannsen and murray) and the development of their relationship was timed perfectly.
2240;But beyond the acting, the cinematography was gorgeous.
2241;It moves very slow but somehow grows on you if you manage to see it to the end.
2242;There is no playing to the gallery either as the director lets the film speak for itself without using too many words, the characteristics typical of some of the finest Japanese films.
2243;Isn't it exciting to see a promising new talent blossom and grow?
2244;The first one is, of course, director Sofia Coppola, daughter of the grand master Francis Ford, and a proud collaborator in the family business.
2245;Though it shares with its predecessor a kind of drowsy, atmospheric slowness, `Lost In Translation' is a much better structured movie, and shows Sofia truly on her way as both director and writer.
2246;It earned her an Oscar for best original screenplay, and golden globes for best screenplay and best film (comedy / musical).
2247;I had my eye on Scarlett since I saw her in two of my favorite films of recent years .
2248;She played supporting roles in both movies, yet I was still impressed, and not just because of her young age (in `Ghost World' she plays a highschool graduate along with Thora Birch, yet she is two years younger than Birch .
2249;and in `Lost In Translation', she really proves that she's a talent to be reckoned with.
2250;In `Lost In Translation' he is both funny and touching, and his performance is worthy of an Oscar.
2251;`Lost In Translation' is a beautiful, moody, atmospheric little piece of perfect cinema from a young director just beginning to show what she has to offer.
2252;Altogether, it's one of the best and most intelligent films of the year.
2253;I enjoyed Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation and would recommend the film to those who have lived abroad, especially in Japan.
2254;the story involved Bill Murray's character, a washed.
2255;coming actress Scarlett Johansen, and they have a brief, chaste, yet intimate friendship.
2256;much of the action takes place in their upscale Tokyo hotel, but there are some interesting scenes in surreal bars, clubs, apartments, karaoke boxes and a hospital.
2257;having lived in Japan, I found that Coppola captured much of the intitial culture shock experienced by those new to the country.
2258;i found the range of characters and their English language abilities to be fairly accurate, although I think the doctor at the hospital might have had a better understanding.
2259;It is a subtle, nuanced, deliberate tale, with lots of lingering shots of details and on the characters looking out windows and thinking.
2260;It is definitely directed but I think that Coppola did an effective job.
2261;Murray's performance, against type, was also outstanding.
2262;Johansen has an engaging smile.
2263;It's hard to explain why, but in large part it's because it does so much, so well.
2264;Bill Murray is a genius.
2265;The character of Bob Harris is achingly real.
2266;When Murray was younger I always wondered if he would ever be able to completely immerse himself in a character without showing flashes of his Bill Murray persona.
2267;It is amazing just to watch him act in this movie.
2268;Giovanni Ribisi is always strong, but in this movie, like Murray, he disappears into his role.
2269;for those of you who don't get this movie, I understand why you don't get it, but this is an absolutely brilliant movie.
2270;One of the best movies ever made.
2271;If you ever obtain the life experience to understand it, you may grow to love this movie.
2272;Watch it again in 20 years.
2273;Well the truth is, this movie was one of the best movies in the last 5 years.
2274;If you havent allready noticed, I loved this movie.
2275;It has a great love story, and the acting is seemless.
2276;Quirky films dont get nomanations for best picture, there is a difference.
2277;If people think watching Bill Murray do a few dozen takes for a whiskey commercial for Japanese TV is some profound or even humorous commentary on media, commercials, the hidden life of the mid.
2278;The tiny twist here comes from the huge age difference between the characters.
2279;The audience sees the couple enjoy spending time with each other but also realise it is nigh.
2280;This is a wonderful movie of two lost souls who for a short time seem to find each other and themselves.
2281;An unhurried, gentle and delicate reflection of searching for meaning and direction.
2282;bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an actor, who sold his soul and talent for a 2 million dollar advertisement offer, while he could be in a play back at home.
2283;He is married with children.
2284;She is gentle, but never sentimental.
2285;during a few days in Tokyo they discover that what both of them were missing was intimacy and mutually stimulating companionship blended through the magical charm of romance.
2286;The deserving winner of the Best Original Screenplay, this film is unlike almost every American film of the past decade.
2287;And Bill Murrary has never revealed his soul more openly.
2288;First, have everybody tell you it is the cinematic achievement of the century.
2289;Second, have everybody tell you it is a stirring encapsulation of the contemporary human condition.
2290;Are you riveted by their boredom, self.
2291;i give it three stars for visual originality, length, and the subtle ending .
2292;You enjoy seeing the Japanese made to look small, silly, fawning, and extremely uncool.
2293;This movie has some laughs, at the expense of the Japanese.
2294;His supercilious glances downward say it all: He is the cool, tall American and they are funny little foreign people.
2295;which satisfies the wife who retreated into motherhood .
2296;They are also moved by some younger women who are also estranged from their husbands who are around but working on location as photographers or anything else.
2297;And that's the main interest of the film.
2298;The passion, if indeed it is a passion, that develops here is purely platonic and shows that the man, as well as the woman, are looking for companionship and soul or spiritual exchange.
2299;This vision is definitely feminine and it shows that the younger woman might be led into yielding, maybe.
2300;A fine film both about the real world and about the world Ms Coppola would like to meet.
2301;I like Bill Murray and I was waiting for something to happen.
2302;This is truly a great film.
2303;Scarlet's presence on screen is breathtaking.
2304;I like bill Murray and I liked this movie.
2305;One is a fresh young innocent, just beginning her life and searching for the ideals she is hoping will come with time.
2306;As Da Vinci used to study deformed persons and include them in his paintings, to enhance the beauty of a personal portrait, the director and actors in this film juxtapose the betrayal of youthful innocence (Johansen) confronting the realities of the world, with the hope that comes from the wisdom of a man who has already lived most of his life (Murray).
2307;It is a unique film, a unique plot, and, its climax is a tender scene in which the two lost souls reconcile their disillusioned dreams by sharing their genuine natures, and, their own ways of coping with the vulnerabilities and mortality of the human journey.
2308;It is for those who seek validation that the journey through life is bittersweet, but, that it is a journey worth our trust in our own humanity and the occasional humanity of others.
2309;Bill Murray is introduced with much greater fanfare, as he arrives at the hotel in a shiny black limousine with the lights of the porte.
2310;He is in town to do a commercial for Santori whiskey.
2311;She doesn't let the film devolve into pathos, but keeps it relatively light an airy, as the characters embark on a whirlwind tour of Tokyo, led by an intrepid Japanese guide.
2312;the film offers a wonderful assemblage of Tokyo life replete with Murray taking a picture.
2313;perfect swing on a long fairway with Mount Fuji rising in the distance.
2314;It was a beautifully understated performance that showed what a consumate actor he is.
2315;Johansson more than holds her own to Murray, making her mark in this movie.
2316;But, what holds this movie together is the remarkably sensitive camera work.
2317;Sofia Coppola is a very gifted director, able to see so much in subtle details and drawing the most from her actors, which she first exhibited in The Virgin Suicides.
2318;Lost in Translation is honestly one of the best films of 2003 and even the critics, who loved it, agree.
2319;Bill Murray is fantastic as the aging actor Bob Harris.
2320;He fills the character with a charm that you cannot get enough of.
2321;Bill Murray really does deserve the Best Actor Oscar.
2322;Scarlett Johansson is awesome as a neglected wife who finds joy in life when she meets Bob Harris.
2323;She really should have gotten a Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress nomination.
2324;As the director, she did a great job and it shows with all the hype that has surrounded the film.
2325;She has a brief conversation with him and we feel the warmth.
2326;With this experience with see how well they connect and we wish we had the same thing with someone.
2327;lost in Translation is a fantastic film that is funny and somewhat sad at the same time.
2328;This is a great movie that everyone should see because it is so enjoyable.
2329;Bill Murray truly rocks and is so alluring with his comidic and dramatic acting.
2330;Now, as Oscar season rolls around, there seems to be great emphasis on this film and deservedly so.
2331;Lost in Translation was one of the best films released last year, and quite possibly, over the course of several years.
2332;So what makes this film so special?First, the talent of Bill Murray.
2333;Murray simply steals this movie and makes it his own.
2334;He somehow drops his comic guard and allows us in, living with him this incredible foreign experience.
2335;Adding to the mixture is the beautiful Scarlett Johansson, who mirrors Murray's performance perfectly.
2336;The results are both hilarious and introspective, and perfect.
2337;but what really makes this movie shine is the many, many, many moments of perfect quietness that speak essential truths.
2338;They allow this film to breathe
2339;lost in Translation is a remarkable film from a remarkable first time director.
2340;It was great to see such a mainstream actor like Bill Murray in this type of role.
2341;In this movie, Murray meets the lovely Johansson along the way who is also lost.
2342;Together the two have great dialogue and do a little bit in the way of finding themselves.
2343;what was so great about this movie was how true it is to real life.
2344;In this movie, you can really see the battling of Murray and Johasson with their innerselves.
2345;With this promising film, hopefully many more great things are on the way from her.
2346;I can't see how anyone can call this a great movie, unless understated and boring is now considered greatness.
2347;i liked the that the characters could develop a deep, intimate bond without jumping in the sack.
2348;It is refreashing to see a movie that can explore relationships with some real emotion.
2349;paced film, but quite interesting nonetheless.
2350;the film takes place almost entirely in Tokyo, which is great, but there is also so much more that Japan can offer that it is a great downfall of the film that so little time is spent elsewhere .
2351;Yet, this also works well, a visual representation of just how lost Bob feels in Japan .
2352;the cinematography is beautiful, portraying Tokyo quite nicely .
2353;The best Universal will allow is to fast.
2354;in the end, Lost in Translation is a wonderful film, and one which needs to be in the collection of everyone who has any connection with Japan .
2355;by blood, by friendship, or simply be appreciation.
2356;The acting was wonderful first of all!
2357;Secondly, as I have said in previous reviews, the ending is the most important part of the story .
2358;this film has an awesome ending!
2359;I thought Bill Murray was great in Rushmore .
2360;I was also a bit embarassed about the caricaturish portrayal of Japanese people.
2361;I thought it was a good film, but he was excoriated by most critics and fans thinking they were coming to see a standard Bill Murray vehicle.
2362;Fortunately, this time around he has received richly deserved accolades for his performance.
2363;His wife is on a remodeling binge, which seems to hint at the fact that the big paycheck is something she has looked forward to.
2364;bob and she eventually meet and become friends.
2365;soul mates in fact, and writer/director Sophia Coppola wisely avoids what nearly any other writer and director would have done with the relationship.
2366;The two leads give incredibly nuanced performances.
2367;Murray in particular is brilliant in his restraint, as on more than a few occasions he has the opportunity to revert to his standard goofy/funny guy act and doesn't.
2368;this is one of the best films I have seen in the past year.
2369;This movie is character driven, with lots of atmosphere .
2370;Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this wry, poignant comedy of kindred souls .
2371;The two seem to understand and empathize with each other instantly.
2372;Palpable chemistry vibrates between them.
2373;The couple share tremendous intimacy based on feelings not sex.
2374;They interact with unusual warmth, gentleness and a tremendous sense of sadness and yearning.
2375;murray gives an absolutely fantastic performance.
2376;He is so real, so natural as Bob Harris that it seems like he never worked from a script.
2377;Ms. Johansson is just perfect with her radiant innocence and wry humor.
2378;It is sheer pleasure to watch the two hang.
2379;Ms. Coppola captures Tokyo from a foreigner's perspective .
2380;with its bright lights, towering skyscrapers, the Eastern take on Western culture, lots of action, movement and clamor.
2381;And the ending is perfect.
2382;In America should have won.
2383;that movie is far superior than this one.
2384;that's it!You think this movie is smart?That's funny,I didnt know a lot of you have the intelligence of a 13 year old.
2385;this is a real dissapointment.
2386;this movie is not deep,smart nor very artistic and those people who thinks that, probably didnt see a lot of really good,deep,intelligent and artsy films.
2387;i dont think its a matter of getting the movie,sure I got it.
2388;And what a rare thing that is.
2389;i know that connections can get you a lot in the Hollywood film industry.
2390;But what connections can't get you is talent.
2391;And one of the most fascinating things is that it's a very feminine talent, very unlike that of her father.
2392;COmpare it with Eric Rohmer, if you know who he is.
2393;Murray and Johansson are both superb.
2394;it's funny about Tokyo, and its characters, but also loving.
2395;i loved the scene where Bob let his morals slip and woke up wondering what had happened.
2396;I loved being able to laugh at that, and also knowing that it was .
2397;And that's how life is.
2398;Try In the Mood for Love or Chungking Express .
2399;you will be amply rewarded.
2400;This is a great movie that we all can relate to.
2401;i really like Bill Murray who acted in this breakout role.
2402;the movie is subtle, but brilliant.
2403;First of all I actually did like this film, the charecters were interesting and Charlotte was so somber and sexy.
2404;bUT>>>>Who told Bill Murray that he is sexy???
2405;It is a really great movie, I never expected to enjoy this as much as I did.
2406;This is a great interview, and I really wish this movie had an audio commentary or (even better) an IME.
2407;I will gladly watch this movie again, I just really love this movie, I cant say exactly why, but you do fall in love with the characters, the situations, the atmosphere, it's just really special, you should see it.
2408;i hope one day, they will re.
2409;release this wonderful movie, and remaster the video and add an audio commentary from the writer / director, Sofia Coppola.
2410;I hold Bill Murray in high regards.
2411;He's simply one of the best comedic actors of the last few generations.
2412;His timing and mannerisms are impeccable.
2413;Somehow, a movie was created which caused my disinterest in not only the classically hilarious Bill Murray, but also the voluptuous vixen Scarlett Johannsen.
2414;the movie itself is great, it's by far one of my favorites.
2415;An early sequence of scenes builds up several relationship slaps between Charlotte and her husband of two years.
2416;He finds himself in comic situations best illustrated by the scene where a complimentary prostitute comes to his room and wants him to lip.
2417;when Bob and Charlotte meet, the movie takes on the feel of a summer vacation romance between the unhappily married.
2418;As the young Charlotte asks Bob questions about life and displays quiet, girlish admiration for Bob's witty comments, a new dimension of tension develops as we wonder if this is the development of romantic love or father/daughter love.
2419;drop that shows interesting, comic, beautiful, and weird perspectives on Tokyo culture.
2420;though a little slow, the film is touching.
2421;It was easy to care about both characters and see why they were such good friends.
2422;But together, their smiles are almost consistent and their lives shine.
2423;the genius of the film, however, is the story.
2424;Both fear adulthood and wonder if it is really worth the risks.
2425;i recommend this film to others who enjoy film as an art rather than as entertainment.
2426;There are no big action scenes and no impressive special effects, but the story is like spending time with your closest friends and finally feeling life's worth.
2427;The special features have expanded scenes and out.
2428;Great extra footage of Bill Murray on the Japanese T. v. show wrestling an eel.
2429;Worth the price of admission right there.
2430;sophia Coppola does a great job of walking the fine line between humor and being objectionable or offensive.
2431;An easy line to cross when having fun and not making fun of another culture.
2432;Putting aside the dreamy Wong Kar Wai influenced story line, the movie does a remarkable job of capturing the mood of a city.
2433;This provides a great back drop that allows her characters to step away from their lives for a brief moment.
2434;A brief dreamy reprieve to a beautiful, eclectic city.
2435;It is a sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, and always sensitive look at the importance of being human.
2436;No aesthetic pleasure will be found here .
2437;This is a film that divides people more ruthlessly and completely than any other I can remember and the strength of the opinions formed by this dreamy and delicate piece of cinema can to say the least be intense.
2438;Ignored by her husband who seems to believe that she is happy admiring the view from their bedroom window and waiting for him to return, her youth and sense of abandonment seems to compliment the world weary decadence of Bob as the pair explore the electric landscape of Tokyo a rather improbable yet compelling bond is formed.
2439;In her sophomore effort this remarkably talented director has presented us the audience with a film that seems to distil the pure spirit of the isolation that many people in the always connected 21st century still feel.
2440;And it is certainly NOT for everyone.
2441;All the one star reviews can account for that !!
2442;This is more of a repertoire film, and by god if you love this type of movie, you will ADORE Lost In Translation.
2443;One of the best american movies of all time.
2444;This movie is well acted, well scripted, well.
2445;it's just a well done movie.
2446;They manage to capture the beauty of the seemingly insignificant relationships that you have throughout your life.
2447;I am glad that I viewed the movie, but will never see it again.
2448;Sofia Coppola proves she is a good director and she defines her style in her second movie after the Virgin Suicides.
2449;this movie is extremely funny, but at the same time it's an intimate drama.
2450;They both start an unlikely friendship that develops into love.
2451;tokyo is a fantastic and amazing city that sets the stage for this strange and yet touching love story.
2452;This is a truely memorable movie.
2453;its not about American/English superiority over Japanese, its about the incredible feeling of lonelyness you feel when you're thrust into another culture, for purposes other then pleasure.
2454;the scenes with the shower, the evelvator, the directors .
2455;The scenes with their night out in Tokyo together show this perfectly.
2456;this is a movie about context, its about how powerful cultural context can be, how much we desire to be with someone, anyone that we can relate to.
2457;Those who love it are open minded, look deep within the film, and closely observe the characters.
2458;The entire movie is all based on the characters themselves, their facial expressions, their behavior, etc.
2459;Keep an open mind when viewing.
2460;Focus on the film, the story, the thoughts, the pictures, the characters.
2461;If you do this, you will see the beauty behind the film and why it was nominated for 4 Academy Awards!
2462;It's a character study, and a great one, the kind they used to make in the 70's (like her dad did).
2463;Loved the shots of Japan, the acting, the writing, the pacing, the mystery at the end .
2464;And it has a lot of subtle humor to it.
2465;It is simple in plot and direction.
2466;A middle aged American movie star in Tokyo to promote a Japanese whiskey (played by Bill Murray) meets a stunning twentysomething woman (Scarlett Johansson)who's in town to accompany her workaholic husband (Giovanni Ribisi) on a photo assignment.
2467;There is a sexual tension between the two, of course, but it's repression adds to the characters' bond.
2468;the subtext to the story surrounding Scarlett Johansson's character, Charlotte, is particularly intriguing because Coppola has hinted that it is autobiogaphical.
2469;Her young photographer husband, Johnny, looks/acts/speaks like Spike Jonze.
2470;Scarlet Johansson is on her way to becoming a major star, and her performance is Oscar worthy.
2471;Bill Murray has been an underrated actor for the entire span of his career and this film may be the role that finally gets him the credit that's long overdue.
2472;a great movie about friendship and soulmates.
2473;You can get the best of everything in Tokyo.
2474;making the connection between Tokyo and My Bloody Valentine is a brilliant stroke, though one might quibble with the song choices.
2475;There is a scene with beautiful photography of Tokyo's lights from above, for which the soundtrack uses MBV's 'Sometimes'.
2476;The juxtaposition of Bilinda Butcher's dreamy voice layered over queasy arrangements of those songs are much more in line with the spirit of the movie than the gorgeous, leaden, dirge of 'Sometimes'.
2477;Beautiful things layered on shaky foundations describe Bob and Charlotte's 'romance', and suit Tokyo, too.
2478;This is a worthwhile movie, with certain cheap errors that leave you wondering how they could happen in something otherwise excellent.
2479;One of the best films I have ever seen!
2480;Made me laugh all the way!
2481;There is absolutely nothing meaningful about Lost in Translation.
2482;It's more mugging than acting, but in this film, it works.
2483;The Japanese, we are asked to believe, love anything Hollywood, whether they recognize the star or not.
2484;Scarlett Johansson is very good in this movie Bill Murray is a hoot I highly recommend it and funny and reasonably priced
2485;Probably the most overrated film of the year.
2486;This is one of the best movies I have seen in years, full of charm and insight, directed with a quirky but precise eye for detail.
2487;while an incongruously idyllic scene plays on the screen) and moves into touching beauty (Murray serenading his lovely young companion with Roxy Music's MORE THAN THIS).
2488;but do yourself a favor and give this one a look, because you may very well find it's for you.
2489;Lost in Translation for me is the perfect movie.
2490;the characters relate in such a way that you are almost there with them as they blossom their relationships.
2491;Sofia Coppola has crafted a wonderful experience that slowly takes shape over the 100 or so minutes before it ends.
2492;I have a feeling this is a semi.
2493;I give her credit for putting her own life into the mix when necessary, yet still creating new fiction that helps the story reach such a powerful peak.
2494;The scenes with Scarlett and Bill (which encompass most of the film) are so subtle, but at the same time powerful, that I was completely into it the whole time.
2495;this film tells me that American film can compete with the great films of Europe when the correct ingredients are present.
2496;This is very simply one of the finest and most touching motion pictures I've ever seen.
2497;It deserves all of the accolades that it received when it came out.
2498;Bill Murray offers a touching and very deep performance in the roll of a successful actor facing the challenge of being bored by his own success and his own life and being tempted by the charm of a lovely young woman (brilliantly played by Scarlet Johansson).
2499;This is a touching, soulful movie that is best watched alone.
2500;I love this movie (can you tell?)
2501;Bill Murray may not have pulled in as much money as eddie murphy, but as far as acting goes, Bill Murray is the most successful cast member from SNL.
2502;The entire film was fresh for me, who has never seen much of the world outside of America.
2503;Although not the focus of this film, the two are together powerful, demanding your attention with their performances.
2504;I loved this film by first time director and script writer Sophia coppola (relative to the famous Francis ford Coppola).
2505;It has powerful imagery and the character portrayal I have not seen much from today's culturally lagging cinema.
2506;I love Bill Murray and I was so excited to see this movie.
2507;It's just a mediocre movie, so does Sophia's talent.
2508;I can see that she was telling some self.
2509;I wonder how she won the best screenplay `cause the flow of the movies feels a little choppy.
2510;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have surprising on.
2511;screen chemistry despite a massive age difference.
2512;All though this film does an excellent job of creating the illusion of reality, I prefer the movies where something actually happens.
2513;This film is one of the greatest.
2514;The imagery and innuendo are wonderful.
2515;The scenery of Japan invokes much emotion.
2516;The artsy folk all sing the praises of a wonderful film while the normal people ridicule something they obviously didn't relate to or understand.
2517;The film was gorgeous, subtle, sad, and uplifting all at the same time.
2518;I think Sofia Coppola did a wonderful job with her sophomore film.
2519;The cinematography, acting, and story were all Oscar worthy and I look forward to her next project.
2520;This is such a love story.
2521;This is a very unique film and the Japanese theme was outstanding!
2522;It was an overall great piece of work.
2523;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson did an incredible job!
2524;I'm not gushing about it but it feels right and good and real.
2525;The whole time that I was watching the movie, with the knowledge that it is rated R for some sexual content, I was concerned that I would have to see the pair take their relationship to a physical level.
2526;The ending was absolutely perfect!I love Bill Murray and I'm glad that he is finally getting recognition for his work.
2527;I especially loved the shots of her wandering around sightseeing by herself.
2528;She has the ability to be normal and gorgeous at the same time.
2529;It is a beautiful, funny and thoughtful film that really showcases the talent of everyone involved.
2530;Visually, it is beautiful, and the actors give wonderful performances.
2531;I am very glad I bought this film.
2532;This film is either a love it or hate it kind of movie.
2533;good to be a good film, but let's at least bring it all into perspective.
2534;I truly believe this is one of the best films of the year.
2535;I felt as if I was right there with Charlotte and Bob as their relationship was unfolding.
2536;And there are several parts throughout it which are hilarious (anything involving the whiskey commercials.
2537;She did an incredible job with the two main characters, of course.
2538;who didn't show up at all on screen were well put.
2539;overall a decent movie, I've watched it a couple times, and it does get better.
2540;After seeing the film, I still wonder.
2541;But what makes it such a great film is its so real.
2542;Bill Murray is superb, for the first time playing someone other than his SNL.
2543;The man has real acting chops, and he shows them here.
2544;its the strange nature of the friendship that his character develops with a younger girl that makes the film so good.
2545;the ending is wonderful and takes a long time to sink in.
2546;But its worth seeing a couple of times to appreciate the nuance of the sound, the lighting and the effortless dialogue.
2547;I loved it, but I also loved the action move The Transporter as well.
2548;Bill Murray was great and what a performance by 18 year old Scarlett Johansson!!!
2549;Everyone I have spoken to rates the surprise ending as the best in a romance movie for a long time.
2550;Rarely, if ever, has there been a film that carries the full weight of unspoken feelings so lightly and so deftly.
2551;Murry and Johansson are like virtuoso jazz musicians playing off of each other with perfect timing and understanding.
2552;But that's only half the story
2553;This film about two people whose judgements we admire and who are almost desperate to be out of untranslated Japan make us feel that being in Japan is essential to one's world view.
2554;Roger Ebert had an interesting observation in his recent letter column.
2555;One reader noted: I loved 'Lost in Translation' in the theater and encouraged all of my friends to see it.
2556;driven movies also benefit from this environment, even though this may sound somewhat counterintuitive.
2557;In a dark and quiet theater, free of the distractions of home viewing, you can concentrate and appreciate this type of film much more.
2558;That's a nice change too and it just leaves the film to be sweet and innocent.
2559;It shows that 2 people can enjoy being with each other without sex as well which a lot of movies don't have.
2560;Even if the movie isn't really meant to be romantic it still is.
2561;She's married and so is he.
2562;So they just enjoy each others company and make the best of their otherwise boring and lonely trip to Japan.
2563;It's a very mellow film but the fact that it can be slow and mellow makes it seem more realistic.
2564;It's a really good movie and Bill Murray Scarlett Johansson are wonderful.
2565;Bill Murray should have won the Oscar for his performance here.
2566;Sofia Coppella shows a dreamlike world in Tokyo.
2567;I had high expectations for this film.
2568;I'd heard good reviews and thought that the theme offered a lot of potential.
2569;Perhaps it's fitting for the title.
2570;I give it a few stars for taking a unique angle, but I didn't feel what I got from the movie was worth the time being lost.
2571;Just be sure to watch it at a time when you can handle the deliberate speed.
2572;this is definitely not one of the greatest love stories ever.
2573;Watching them fall in love with each other is sort of like viewing a nature documentary on the mating rituals of slugs.
2574;That's all well and good, but the romance in here isn't subdued .
2575;fourths of all the jokes in the movie are just scenes where the main characters sit around and poke fun at the Japanese.
2576;To be fair, however, the movie does have many beautiful shots.
2577;The direction is actually very good, no matter what the speed of the movie might be.
2578;The acting, as I said, is generally pretty good.
2579;stated purposes of the creative arts, beyond that of simple entertainment, is to enlighten the spectator by inspiring reflection on his or her own condition.
2580;Works of creative expression can thus involve us in a kind of dialogue with the work that illuminates aspects of our lives in ways we might not have considered otherwise.
2581;Such works dont need to be perfect masterpieces, or even necessarily good as defined along any number of narrow guidelines.
2582;The spiritual dislocation both Bob and Charlotte have probably been carrying around for some time comes into bold relief due to a mixture of loneliness, cultural isolation and insomnia, and as they run into each other more often in the bar of the hotel where they are both staying, they spark with the sense of kindred recognition.
2583;marriage, children, knowing oneself, growing old .
2584;factly puts his hand on Charlottes foot, a simple, tender gesture that lays open what this film is all about.
2585;there are a number of moments like this .
2586;the last scene of the movie is particularly touching because of the way director Sofia Coppola stages it .
2587;which are ripe with the knowledge that romance and affection need not lead inexorably to sex, and can offer far greater rewards.
2588;is more common in European films and will be most effective for those who appreciate storytelling that prefers subtle movement over clumsy exposition.
2589;What is good about this movie?
2590;luckily it does end, and you'll be thankful it does.
2591;hilarious energy Murray brought to previous roles, then I believe his efforts in L. i. t. can be better appreciated by those who don't already see best actor award in his performance.
2592;good vehicles as STRIPES or GHOSTBUSTERS.
2593;those who love it AND those who pan it.
2594;center movie that will polarize audiences.
2595;As such I rated it four stars, although for me it's a five star film.
2596;Lost in Translation is a solid film with a good performance from Johannson and a good performance from Murray, one that is quite a lot like other performances of his.
2597;He needed another top box office star with him in this one.
2598;A lot of good but a lot of mixed moral messages in this one.
2599;I loved the ending, but wasn't sure how I felt about the film as a whole.
2600;I bought it before I watched it a second time, somehow sure that I would watch it again and again.
2601;A great film in the study of subtle acting and quiet atmospheres.
2602;This film is wonderful
2603;The acting is terrific .
2604;The sound and cinematography are beautiful.
2605;This film is truly a piece of art.
2606;My friends further whet my appetite by touting it's good qualities, and telling me what a wonderful movie it was.
2607;it does have its good points.
2608;There are some humorous interactions between Bill Murray and basically everyone.
2609;It's a far superior film, without the hackneyed directing this one has.
2610;I have enjoyed Bill Murray's work over the years.
2611;I haven't always LOVED it, but he can always make me laugh.
2612;My favorite is Ground Hog Day.
2613;I was interested in seeing this movie because of the things that I heard about Murray and this role.
2614;well, I failed to enjoy the movie and found Bill Murray almost unrecognizable as a human being.
2615;For the entire length of the movie I waited for something to happen in this movie, and was never satisfied.
2616;great music.You will sit through the silences, the pauses and wonder why this film has already taken its grip on you.You will mimic key phrases from the film and wonder why a film so poignant and tender can make your tummy ache with laughter.You will shake your head, laugh and cry all at the same time just because everything in this movie is so heartbreakingly true.
2617;In my case, I didn't think I'd like the film until I caught it on cable by chance one night and got hooked into a beautiful film that has become one of my favorites.
2618;If you're one of those people that really liked the film, naturally you'd like to know more with comments from at least the director and maybe the stars.
2619;hour piece shot with a home video camera of Sofia and the crew running around Tokyo, along with a Rome 2003 interview with her and Bill Murray.
2620;There are deleted scenes which are pretty good, but that's about it.
2621;every time you want to watch it.
2622;This has to be my favorite movie of all time.
2623;Somehow hits home for me.
2624;Great movie I suggest EVERYONE watches it.
2625;This film, left on its own, is a good movie.
2626;Murray isn't great and certainly wasn't up to par with Penn's or Robbins' performance in Mystic River, but he was good.
2627;intellectual film about a young lady and an old guy who become friends and the needs they have and momentarily fufill with each other.
2628;Look a bit further and you'll see the real, courageous portion of the film: how life is basically very simple and redundant .
2629;p>Lost in Translation was an exceptional movie.
2630;Bill Murray gives his most likeable performance since Rushmore.
2631;The sound track was pretty good.
2632;It has that whole outside of hollywood appeal going on, and depending on who you are that is a big selling point (probably the biggest selling point.)
2633;Bill Murray's character was wonderful in contrast, you can see how he could enjoyAlso on top of all that Scarlett Johansson didn't seem to fit her role well at all.
2634;There are details that build up the two main characters and illuminate the experiences of Americans temporarily living in Tokyo.
2635;On one hand, this was a fairly interesting movie with a great performance by Bill Murray.
2636;bob Harris (Bill Murray) is an American actor working on commercials in Japan for a while.
2637;Charlotte's husband works as a photographer and he is gone most of the time.
2638;Eventually they begin a friendship and they spend time together both in the hotel as well as out on the town in Tokyo.
2639;Of course that isn't authentic Japan, but it is an authentic experience.
2640;Sophia Coppola wrote the screenplay and she is very gentle with the Japanese people, so I guess that I don't quite understand the accusations of racism and cultural prejudice.
2641;this is Coppola's second film and while I feel that this is a much stronger film than The Virgin Suicides, I wasn't as impressed as I felt I should be.
2642;I was impressed with the work of both Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson, and I appreciate the film a bit more the more I think about it, but I just can't manage to get excited about this movie.
2643;This movie is powerful and yet represents elegance in simplicity.
2644;Together, Johansson and Murray make themselves fit in this complex world they do not understand and ultimately make their own world.
2645;Johansson learns about life, that everyone eventually finds their place in it.
2646;the beauty of this movie is there is no romance between the two.
2647;It is an experience of two people who find each other and form a friendship.
2648;This movie leaves you satiated and reaffirms the goodness of humanity.
2649;Such a film is, regrettably, a rarity.
2650;the look on their faces, subtle, I know, but realistic, the looking away nervousness, that's how most people would be, me included.
2651;, but the song is presented uniquely and it really fits this movie to a t. Bill Murray was great, and Scarlett Johansson was really wonderful and she is also very beautiful.
2652;You can't help but enjoy watching her.
2653;Sophia Copala did a wonderful job at conveying deep feelings and meanings with stillness and minimalistic expression.
2654;I've only watched it on the dish and have it recorded, but this is one I will be owning.
2655;star reviews others have written.
2656;The majestic cinematography, sparse, smart dialogue (not a word is wasted), and perfect performances by Johansson and Murray, make this an essential movie for anyone with a tender heart.
2657;I also really really love the decade I am living inright now which is my all time favorite decade the 21st century.
2658;For Iaccidentally insulted my all time favorite decade which was thetruly truly beautiful and wonderful 21st century.
2659;I love I meanI truly love the 21st century and even when I wrote the one starreview of Gangs Of New York and accidentally insulted my all time favorite decade the 21st century, I did not know what Iwas doing.
2660;In the March 28th2004 five star review of Gangs Of New York, I also implied thatHollywood is still strong and it is still strong from this dayon.
2661;I forgot about it for months, but atthe time I was feeling sad for a few days that I insulted adecade I truly I mean truly loved which is the wonderful andbeautiful 21st century.
2662;However during July 2003, I could notremember If I wrote an apology review for it still did not warnmy friends of the dangers, but I was feeling better for I waswatching my favorite films, music, and HBO TV from my all timefavorite decade the 21st century.
2663;I wrote down with enthusiasm and honesty that Inot only truly truly love Gangs Of New York, but that I alsotruly truly loved my all time favorite decade the 21st century.
2664;make no mistake I have always loved my all time favorite decadethe 21st century, from the start to present day.
2665;I love myall time favorite decade which is the 21st century, in face Iown the great movies from the 21st century.
2666;That is everythingfrom Erin Brockovich to Lord Of The Rings Return Of The King.
2667;i am telling you the honest honest truth.
2668;I love the 21st century, it is my all time favorite decade.
2669;I also love the HBO miniseries Band Of Brothersand Angels In America.
2670;i am also being honest I mean truly honest I love I mean reallyreally love the beautiful and wonderful 21st century, which ismy all time favorite decade of all time.
2671;All in all the 21stcentury is awesome.
2672;I imagine that the movie company deserves some blame as they did sell this movie as a comedy.
2673;I think it is an absolutely brilliant movie.
2674;I have found that my friends who have travelled to the Far East and have encountered the culture shock displayed in the movie all like this movie.
2675;i think the ennui and the unresolved nature of the movie disturbs a lot of people.
2676;I'm very curious as to what they think about this movie in Japan.
2677;Bill Murray is amusing as a lonely 50 something man far from his comfort zone.
2678;Scarlett Johansson is cute and pulls off being older than her 18 years.
2679;She is also lonely in Tokyo.
2680;Their affection for each other is genuine and their parting is a nice tender moment.
2681;The real star of this movie is Tokyo.
2682;This movie was such a good movie, i wrote about it for a college class last semester.
2683;It has real characters, with real problems that find themselves in a strange place.
2684;He will say I love you after his wife hangs up.
2685;It somehow finds a way to be entertaining.
2686;This is real life though, and it is interesting.
2687;The feelings this movie will give you are indescribable.
2688;Millions of questions go unanswered in this movie, but that is what makes it so good.
2689;If a happy ending is what you want, Go see Finding Nemo.
2690;For a great movie, with great actors and a great story, check out Lost in Translation.
2691;It is a movie that deals with very real problems we face everyday.
2692;Loneliness is present in everyone's life.
2693;Because Coppola's daughter wrote and directed it, critics loved it.
2694;Monday, August 30, 2004 / 3 of 5 / Bittersweet, quaint tale.
2695;exploring deeper human themes like isolation, loneliness, and boredom this was an interesting movie, almost quaint and child.
2696;In the end, the viewer is glad that these two met and interacted, especially watching Murray grin genuinely at their final parting.
2697;Same with Bill Murray for Best Actor.
2698;Bill Murray is his usual brilliant self, but for me Johansson stole the movie.
2699;Igave this film a 3.
2700;time,a grand opera of violence.
2701;i know they are intelligent and well.
2702;they are friendly and polite.
2703;i think if you are intelligent and can enjoy subtle and perceptive films this is a fine film.
2704;It's so simple a premise, yet there is so much going on, on an emotional level.
2705;please use the shift key.
2706;But I understand the choice of Japan.
2707;i found the story and characters very moving.
2708;This subtle film needs to be given space to seep into your pores and transport you.
2709;I loved what she did with the Virgin Suicides, and the score especially.
2710;so i went in with that expectation.
2711;a film about two real people being people, and done in such a lovely way.
2712;It was funny, in a poignant way.
2713;screen chemistry between the two is tangible, and i shall definetly be on the watch for her career.
2714;great movie,with a great soundtrack.
2715;Sofia has an eye (and an ear) for great cinema.
2716;it's a bit quirky at times ( due to the culture shock ) and a bit mundane ( the short snippets of conversation when they meet) but highly enjoyable.
2717;Some movies can withstand the expectations that come with great reviews.
2718;It probably helps if you can relate to one of the two main characters.
2719;If you can, you will likely enjoy this movie immensely.
2720;For myself this is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen.
2721;They do manage to grow because of each other, and that is good.
2722;It was worth spending the time to see it twice and pick up what I missed.
2723;the thing that impressed me most was how well the film did at making me feel like an outsider in Japanese culture.
2724;The film did a great job there.
2725;Watch it for that at least.
2726;uPDATE: May 2011After speaking with a younger colleague who absolutely loves this film, I have decided that there is probably a generational thing going on.
2727;He said it speaks very strongly to his life, and I value his opinion, so I am going to watch it a third time and see if I can detach from my point of view a bit and be more open to what appeals so much to his generation.
2728;(Always a good idea to listen and learn from those with whom we differ.)
2729;I will update this again after my next viewing.
2730;It gets better every time I watch it.
2731;One of those rare films where the cast, acting, script, cinematography, and location gel perfectly.
2732;The best movie I've seen in a long time.
2733;But it's defnitely not necessary, provided one has an imagination.
2734;very funky place with funky people.
2735;Good choice on Coppola!The choices of actors is excellent and Scarlett definitely shines and makes one nostalgic of those days in Tokyo.
2736;As for Bill Murray, he is the perfect choice to play the role of a family man bored in Tokyo, but experiencing something entirely new and refreshing.
2737;It never got my excited where I wanted to see what was going to happen next.Yes the scenery is amazing and it makes you want to go visit downtown Tokyo straight away, and of course Bill Murray delivers one of the best performances of his life.
2738;believe everyone got caught up in the hype with this movie, does it look great at times.
2739;Does Bill Murray deliver one of the best performances of his career and does he literally drag the movie around on its back to make it even barely watchable.yes he does.
2740;is this Sophia Coppola's best movie?
2741;good movie is a very powerful work of art.
2742;Coppola proves through this movie that a lot can be accomplished without a lot of action.
2743;I understand that many viewers don't have a strong respect or appreciation of a movie without a generic love story or gobs of action and unnecessary violence just for the sake of being violent, but this movie is literature in the form of film.
2744;bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are perfect compliments of each other.
2745;The other character is young, new to marriage, and uncertain of where life goes, how life goes, and what will happen in the end.
2746;i would recommend this movie to those who enjoyed movies such as The Royal Tenenbaums, The Virgin Suicides, Igby Goes Down, and Rushmore.
2747;compelling are the three words I will leave you with to describe this movie.
2748;It was so dreamily real in a way that only the talented Coppola could portray.
2749;It is fantastic and absolutly beautiful.
2750;This one got to me, and it's never felt so good.
2751;And they all love clothes.
2752;And they all took a great baseball fan and turned him into an Oscar baiting self.
2753;This movie was saved by a great performance by Bill Murray.
2754;what a great dramatic actor Murray has become.
2755;At one point in a call to the States, Bob wishes that they eat Japanese food more often, and his wife matter.
2756;murray's understated performance is a gem, and may garner him an Oscar nomination.
2757;as much as I applaud Murray's performance, perhaps the best of his career, and admire LOST IN TRANSLATION as an intelligent and perceptive production, I found it less successful as an entertainment vehicle.
2758;Scarlett is a bit on the simple side.
2759;The music choice is superb.
2760;It can be summarized as the human condition anywhere, anytime.
2761;Bill's expressions on the movie set and in the hotel bar, are worth watching
2762;I liked it and the scene at the end summarized what sometimes happens in life.
2763;It's just one of those films that I'm able to watch again and again.
2764;But regardless of what you felt about this movie you don't have to command people not to go see it.
2765;this movie is also about life in Tokyo, and Japanese in general.
2766;You get to see alot of their culture and the big city life in Tokyo, Perhaps not the always the nicest things but it does give a good picture of the life there.
2767;Bill Murray, is alwyas good.
2768;A really pleasant movie for sure.
2769;in actual fact, if one is about the age of Bill Murray, one can identify with his character and find a lot more meaning in this movie.
2770;The movie then flows, it is interesting, it has more meaning.
2771;Murray very well protrayed his frustration, his lonliness in life with his eyes, his expressions, his demeanor.
2772;there were many touching moments in this movie.
2773;It was a very touching scene to me.
2774;a father's love for a daughter, and a man's love for a woman.
2775;He tried to help her see life in a positive way and he helped her.
2776;His right hand moves from beside him to touch her feet.
2777;It was a touching moment.
2778;Once more his role as father wins over the supposedly normal male takes what is offered role.
2779;He knows who he is, and this knowledge is what creates his lonliness.
2780;the final moment, the tender goodbye was the best moment.
2781;hearts can reach out from another place and give love.
2782;They are with us all day.
2783;It is a sadder love, but love nonetheless.
2784;Bill Murray is very funny though.
2785;life is indeed full of long moments of quiet reflection with very little action.
2786;The moments that are important are what creates the stories of our lives.
2787;The great films don't simply entertain.
2788;heals in love with someone in a dream only to wake up and realize we never lived that life at all
2789;These feelings stem from the source and is created in the form of art, and it's the artists job to tap into these unknown realms that seem strange to every untrained and unimpassioned slob who dares call this The worst movie ever made.
2790;And again, he is fantastic in this one.
2791;they had a great idea going here.
2792;The best part of the movie is Bill Murray's acting, the cultural faux paus, and the fabulous location.
2793;director Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is an exquisite gem of a movie.
2794;It is her love letter to the city of Tokyo, which the breathtaking cinematography captures in all of its garish glory.
2795;Lost in Translation more than fulfills the promise made by Coppola's first directorial effort, The Virgin Suicides, and shows that she is a major new filmmaker with a voice all of her own.
2796;Murray's best moments come when he seems to be unaware that he's acting, when the camera turns to his face and it is filled with such profound sadness it breaks your heart.
2797;Lost in Translation is filled with many tiny moments like this, moments that make up real life but are seldom captured so effectively on film.
2798;Charlotte is alone and drifting, and in the night she and Bob strike up a friendship.
2799;Bob and Charlotte have many late night conversations about what life means to them, and they relate to one another in a very precious way.
2800;murray and Johansson play this unique relationship perfectly, making you see the humanity of Bob and Charlotte, how in their loneliness they reach out and touch one another's lives.
2801;The ending to Lost in Translation is oner of the best I have ever seen in film.
2802;bob and Charlotte part company knowing that they have shared something very special that has changed their lives.
2803;In the darkness of midnight Tokyo, two lost people found one another, and it is wondrous to watch.
2804;This is a very moody, quiet, beautiful film.
2805;You will be rewarded with the miracle of Bill Murray's performance and Sofia Coppola's Oscar.
2806;This movie is so masterful in all of its respects, it almost defies explanation.
2807;Sofia Coppola is able to tell this story with an adept and skillful manner, so much so that you almost miss how wonderful it is from the get.
2808;And in the midst of their crises, these two find each other and bond together to help one another through their lonely times.
2809;It is a tale also of finding yourself, getting yourself out of a rut, with their careers and marriages and life in general.
2810;There is a bond there, something unique, wonderful as it is indescribable.
2811;This relationship propels both of them forward into their lives, leaves them both smiling at the end of the movie.
2812;this is what has to be Bill Murray's best performance ever, Oscar.
2813;worthy if there ever was an acting role that deserved a golden statue.
2814;What makes his role so beautifully poignant is that it is very subtle.
2815;Yet it is in the way his body, his smile, his eyes, it is how these facets of his personality manifest the inner emotions that make the role great.
2816;When he is shaving, and he holds up the tiny, plastic razor looking in the mirror, his face sums up his entire situation, without the need for words.
2817;similarly, Scarlett Johansson is remarkable, also for her subtle way of portraying the quarter.
2818;this movie is very understated, and I feel underrated.
2819;It gives just dazzling performances from two very talented actors, and it tells a tale that is wonderful as it is instructive and uplifting all the same time.
2820;heartedly recommend this film to everyone, especailly if you are feeling a bit lonely.
2821;I have not yet found one single person who says they have seen it and liked it.
2822;I began to appreciate the actors' performances, as well as the glimpses into the culture of Tokyo.
2823;the unspoken romantic feelings between Bob and Charlotte are wonderful, and it was refreshing to have a movie that convincingly portrayed a bond between two characters without having them rip their clothes off.
2824;All of this set in Japan, a country making a transition into the modern world, yet holding on to some of their traditions.
2825;scarlett Johansson continues to do outstanding work, and like Bill, you connect with them as someone you like.
2826;this movie is an attempt to establish communication between rich and poor, privileged and common, young and old, east and west.
2827;The bonus clips give you more of a feel for the city of Tokyo and the people of Japan.
2828;otherwise they get the job done and deliver on what they say they were going to deliver on.
2829;Of course these are all top rated professionals, so you would expect that they are going to persevere and accomplish what they set out to do.
2830;this is a film that can be studied as a work that shows what can be done with a small budget and a small crew.
2831;I've heard talk that this is a kind of autobiographyc movie.
2832;If she tried to pass on to the audience a feeling of impotent boredom, then she did a very good job.
2833;the movie is well enacted and has some sincerely hilarious scenes.
2834;Bill Murray is great as the midlife crisis striken man.
2835;The scene where he's shotting the commercial is fantastic.
2836;The best thing about Lost in translation is that it is simple, and real.
2837;The relationship between the two characters, while odd, is realistic, and I think most of the people watching the movie could relate to what they were watching on screen.
2838;Otherwise, a very good and interesting movie, with top performances by the two main actors.
2839;besides the beautiful, atmospheric tone, this movie was completely boring.
2840;Another factor in the movie that makes me furious is Bill Murray's so. called greatest performance of his life .
2841;numbing character for the big screen in the first place?There are so many good artsy movies out there that are much more interesting to watch.
2842;A wonderful and subtle film about the journeys we take and the choices we make through life.
2843;It is both quiet and jarring like the Tokyo experience and Coppola captures the essence of the city in just a short two hour period.
2844;Bill Murray is wonderful and Scarlett Johansen is like a little cherry blossom .
2845;a timeless piece of work.
2846;There are many ways to look at this bouquet of a film.
2847;There is the advent of a star being born, Scarlett Johansson.
2848;We wonder about this fascinating character Murray creates, wanting to dig deeper, to understand more and better.
2849;And yet the film resists, cleverly leaving Murray's washed.
2850;My very good friend asked me to come with her to see this movie.
2851;We went to cinema and both of us laughed a lot during the movie.
2852;two sleepless people meets each other and find a special mental connection between their worlds.
2853;They dance, song Karaoke and talk together.
2854;Murray plays his part very well and shows that he can also act a serious man role(normally he plays comedy roles).
2855;johansson is only a 19 year old woman but she'll be a great future if she can pick as good roles as this movie.
2856;If you understand Japanese language, you'll get a lot of more this movie.
2857;this was an enjoyable film though i wish it had another screenwriter.
2858;I had remembered Sofia Coppola's performance in Godfather 3 many years ago and enjoyed her earlier movie The Virgin Suicides.
2859;prime American Movie Star visiting Tokyo because he got a hefty paycheck to promote Japanese Scotch.
2860;the pace of the movie allows you to find your own tempo alongside the movie's tempo.
2861;the humor is wry and understated.
2862;the relationships are real and the ending is another non.
2863;the acting tends towards subtle, nuanced and intelligent.
2864;I loved the scenes of Bill Murray dealing with the Directors of the Scotch commercials.
2865;there were also great I don't fit here sequences, wordless yet among the most strongly stated of the movie.
2866;both have soft voices, appear very present yet just a wee bit unattached.
2867;I love the music too and have the soundtrack.
2868;It's just a quirky neat movie.
2869;I enjoyed the movie, and I was sad that it ended (we always want more when we're immersed in something we enjoy so much), but it took me a few days to realize why I liked it.
2870;it conjures up an ethereal atmosphere in both the way Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson interact with each other and how they interact with the huge bustling city that surrounds them.
2871;It's a unique experience (and I mean that, it's an experience more than a story), and I wanted to rewatch the movie again just hours after I'd seen it.
2872;I saw this film knowing little about it and thought it was lovely.
2873;I, on the other hand, enjoyed this distance, it reminds me somewhat of that aspect of Hemingway's writing.
2874;There are many films considered wonderful or brilliant that I've hated, but I won't berate those who enjoyed them.
2875;It would get pretty boring to be constantly saying, Wow.
2876;Now we actually have something to talk about.
2877;for those who know the feeling of being very far from home, you will appreciate how the film captures this experience.
2878;Bill Murray's performance is genius, the mood of the film will stay with you for days and the dangling ending is so wonderful when compared to most simplistc Hollywood films who seem to require the pat ending, no matter how unlikely or ridiculous.
2879;Every one of us thought the movie was great.
2880;It was hysterically funny and each one of us would highly recommend it.
2881;I know Richard Roper thought it was a great film although some of his viewers disagreed with him and gave him a bad time for recommending it.
2882;But we all loved it and had a great time watching it.
2883;shocked which seems like a good start to a relationship.
2884;The movie pokes a lot of fun at the differences between American and Japanese cultures, from Bill Murray towering over the diminutive Japanese in an elevator, to a Japanese director who is trying to get Murray to look like Frank Sinatra of the lat pack (rat pack.)
2885;Murray makes the most of these scenes and is hilarious as he gets carried away on an exercise machine and watches Japanese ladies prancing in a pool in a water aerobics class.
2886;The movie is slow at the beginning and I kept wondering, What is the point to all of this , but eventually the developing friendship between Murray and Johannson is a joy to behold and it doesn't need much plot to sustain it.
2887;All in all, this is a good film and I look forward to more pictures from Sofia Coppola.
2888;This is interesting, I'm sure those who are put off by traditional Hollywood productions, which do get old, will love this.
2889;this was a nice movie, really.
2890;I kept seeing the previews for this movie and kept on meaning to see it in the theatre.
2891;This is a beautiful and masterfully crafted piece of art.
2892;He is a movie star whose career has reached a plateau and whose relationship with his wife has become more focused on the practicalities of choosing carpet color and taking care of the kids.
2893;start, something to motivate them.
2894;this is a place in life that everyone in the audience can identify with, and Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray play these roles with the perfect combination of sympathy, subtlety, and ironic humor.
2895;Their friendship unfolds slowly and naturally, and their connection is based on the experiences rather than the intimacies they share.
2896;This makes the friendship that develops between them very believable despite their vast age difference.
2897;What results is a sweet, funny movie with a lot of heart that is not overly sentimental.
2898;it's the best movie I've seen in many years and the only one I've been inspired to write a review for.
2899;inspiring and full of deep meaning.
2900;Well, to be quite honest.
2901;one: I can appreciate a moment of silence in a movie.
2902;two: I honestly did not care about their characters.
2903;This film is Bill Murray's finest performance yet (coming in a close second: his run as the depressed middle aged husband/dad/businessman in Rushmore).
2904;The beauty of this film is the way that Tokyo is portrayed by the director, Sofia Coppola, as well as the Murray and Johnson's reactions to the very foreign and seemingly bizarre world of Japan.
2905;the film is funny is subtle ways: facial reactions, snippy comments from Murray, body language.
2906;But the most beautiful part of the film is the way that Murray and Johnson find each other, and common ground, in a very surreal environment.
2907;scarlett Johansson is a revelation, too.
2908;Along comes Bill Murray's Bob and together they plot a joint escape.
2909;this movie stays in your heart long after the credits roll.
2910;now that's a moving story worth tuning into.
2911;the real treat here is the gorgeous shots of the city.
2912;The flashing lights of the city skyline at night, the amazing view from the hotel.
2913;Being a huge fan of anime and Japanese culture in general, I can really appreciate that type of feeling.
2914;The music selection fits perfectly with the atmopshere too.
2915;My Bloody Valentine is my favorite band, and their breathtaking song Sometimes (as well as 4 other songs from the newly returned Kevin Shields.
2916;played over the sparkling skyscrapers is the highlight of the film for me.
2917;like I said, it's decent, but you can get the same effect from looking at pictures of the Tokyo skyline.
2918;I desperately wanted to like this movie
2919;I enjoy almost anything
2920;hence the title of the movie.Yes, there was the flamboyant talk show host, the bizarre prostitute, the eccentric director, the strange TV shows, and a lot of references to Japanese pronunciation of English words.
2921;it's simply honest about the ways in which people don't understand each other, whether it be across cultures or even within one's own marriage.
2922;Who gavethis one a great rating?
2923;The cinematography and story line is so dreamy and subtle that you'll almost be confused about what is happening.
2924;But if you get to a point where you click with what is happening in this movie, you will totally love it.
2925;what's great about this movie to me is the ability for it to take you totally out of your present situation and location and it actually makes you feel that tired/dreamy feeling you have when you're severely jet.
2926;It is the ultimate escape movie, in that sense.
2927;Add to that the inescapable Japanese culture at every turn, and it takes that dreamy feeling to a spacey one.
2928;The film is full of these moments where you catch yourself saying, did he just really do that?
2929;at another level, the plot of the movie is simple and the characters are pretty deep.
2930;And the moments that they experience are many of the same moments we all experience at one time or another, but the setting is so dreamy that you admire them for how they conduct themselves.
2931;But you have to be in the right state of mind, ready to take a trip of exploring a dreamy, jet.
2932;lagged, emotional relationship that is what we used to call a friendship.
2933;And watch it a second time, there's so much there.
2934;bill Murray does a wonderful job with his character, almost underplaying it with subtle grace and humour.
2935;The ending was not quite what was expected, but it seemed very realistic.
2936;do I want to invest an hour and a half of my life into this film?Finally, I had a quiet few moments, an opportunity presented itself and I decided to give it a shot.
2937;this is a piece that reveals those icky insecurities and quirks that we all carry and transfer to our relationships.
2938;All the details of life are subject to translation or interpretation and exactly what the movie is about .
2939;A study of humanity in all its complexity.
2940;Really this movie is about ideas, and relationships.
2941;An excellent movie with an excellent message.
2942;Frankly it's not something I could do everyday, but it's not a waste of time and it's definitely enjoyable while it lasts.
2943;the movie is beautifully put together and the cinematography is stunning.
2944;coppola also resists the temptation to bring things to a traditional, neat, Hollywood ending, which I personally felt was fantastic .
2945;The conclusion of the movie itself is similarly perfect .
2946;fed everything?The depiction of Tokyo itself is marvelous, and has left me with a strong desire to visit as soon as possible.
2947;this brings me to my next point .
2948;mic moment
2949;Shown particularly clearly in the Japanese wedding scene.
2950;She's upset with her husband.
2951;Everyone has fun with it in their own way.
2952;EVERYONE is enjoying themselves here, until Bob and Charlotte's jetlag finally does catch up with them.
2953;the film makes fun of the weird things that the Japanese do, but it also makes fun of the weird things Americans do in a foreign country.
2954;And the humor in the movie is invariably affectionate.
2955;I saw this movie in the theater, and I liked it a lot, and plenty of professional film critics did too.
2956;The beauty of his performance as Bob Harris here is precisely that he refuses to overdo the feelings of despair his character must feel about his marriage, about the path his own life has taken, etc.
2957;The great thing about Bill Murray's performance is that we always respond to Bob Harris the character, not Bill Murray the actor.
2958;gregy55902, if you think it is so easy to be real in front of a camera with full knowledge that there is a camera recording your every move, then perhaps you should try film acting yourself.
2959;up perhaps shows how much they truly need each other.
2960;Despite all that, most of what is in LOST IN TRANSLATION in its final form is so real, and touches so deeply that I am sure I could watch it again and feel the same way.
2961;Try to take it for what it is.
2962;a quiet yet uplifting comedy.
2963;Jet laged and lonelyLost souls connect in the nightCelluloid brilliance.
2964;Yes there were a couple of laughs, yes it was well acted, yes the cinematography was good but in the end nothing could overcome the weight of its incredibly slow pace.
2965;now the main actress, yes her,I liked her other movies, yes sure.
2966;modern world connect in a way we don't usually see on film.
2967;Even though they must be at least thirty years apart in age (a fact the director Sofia Coppola uses to accent the improbability of the events), they form a bond that begins perhaps because they understand each other's pain.
2968;But how it develops is what makes this movie so special.
2969;the cinematography and the direction is breathtaking also.
2970;The scene where Scarlett Johansson's character takes a sightseeing trip by herself was an especially powerful one for me.
2971;It was the best movie I've seen in a long time.
2972;Bob and Charlotte meet in a hotel bar one lonely night, and they hit it off.
2973;They have a great adventure in Tokyo and discover new possibilities for their lives.
2974;this movie is very unique.
2975;Bill Murray does a good job of capturing his role of disaffected American pitchman in Japan.
2976;Although (naturally) not up to Bill's intrinsic comedic talent, Scarlett Johansson does an even better job of capturing the mood.
2977;It can affect you even when you come home, so even your everyday life seems somehow strange, and you begin to look at it in a strange dislocated way.
2978;that's just one of the feelings this film captures superbly.
2979;Bob, the actor, has lived enough to see this, and .
2980;enough to know that He probably will carry on with his life.
2981;there is solace in friendship and finding a kindred spirit.
2982;Coppola's script is superb and subtle.
2983;For everyone else it's an unforgettable and aching experience.
2984;Two people stuck in a culture not their own, find each other and discover they have much more to share than their ability to speak English.
2985;Lost in Translation unfolds a brilliant story in regards to disconnection and connection in an unfamiliar milieu.
2986;Sophia Coppola proves that she understands the human psyche and social interaction as she creates an authentic humane atmosphere that is enhanced by a terrific cinematography and a virtuoso performance by the cast as human existence is analyzed.
2987;That actually sounds like many of the reviews this film has received on this site.
2988;For the poetic, this film is breathtaking and sumptuous.
2989;to tell a story without sex or things blowing up!I loved this movie.
2990;it was like a poem, and every stanza flowed into the next.
2991;Parts of this movie were wonderfully funny and sweet.
2992;The film is well acted, the script is excellent and the direction was fantastic.
2993;I keep thinking about it and want to watch it again.
2994;If you are faced with choosing between this movie and the other one , always choose the other one .
2995;Bill Murray is perfect and great fun to watch, but he is actually probably just being himself.
2996;Scarlet Johansson is intriguing, as always.
2997;And she has never looked so beautiful!
2998;She's great in it and it's a better movie than Lost in Translation too.
2999;To me the most interesting thing about this film, besides the acting, is the scenery in Tokyo and seeing how some people live there.
3000;Bill and Scarlett are smart and interesting characters in this film, but are diminished by these actions.
3001;so overall, it's quite entertaining, but not great or profound or really special.
3002;But beyond that, the movie has a unique, unpredictable chemistry that strikes viewers as more sincere, simple and authentic than many big.
3003;Most significant is the rare maturity of Bill Murray's character for a modern movie, and his trademark understated performance.
3004;His advice on marriage is so viscerally realistic, it is almost cinema verite.
3005;The scene in the restaurant is another high moment.
3006;But again, that movie was a surprise popular hit.
3007;Real art is that work which does not imitate, but achieves the real thing.
3008;Therefore, we must also perhaps credit the casting and Sophia Coppola's direction with understated grace, perception of the chemistry of her actors, and that all.
3009;a popular hit, maybe, but otherwise pretty overrated.
3010;Shot on location, in just 27 days, Lost in Translation presents a simple but beautiful story with fantastic performances by Scarlett Johansen and Bill Murray, stunning cinematography, and powerful messages presented to the audience.
3011;He eventually meets and befriends the youthful Charlotte, played by Scarlett Johansen who is staying in the same luxury hotel as Harris.
3012;The chance encounters between Charlotte and Harris eventually blossom into a surprising friendship, with powerful camaraderie.
3013;The audience then follows the pair on their chaotic yet beautiful adventures throughout the city of Tokyo and the hilarious encounters with its citizens.
3014;Bob and Charlotte discover this magnificence and the meaningfulness behind loving friendships.
3015;the journey brings excitement to the lives of Charlotte and Harris and the two ultimately discover a new belief in life's possibilities.
3016;tale journey has to end and Harris and Charlotte have to part ways.
3017;The film ends on a controversial and graceful note which again exemplifies the theme of living in the moment and making the most of the attachments we form while we can.
3018;the performances of Murray and Johanssen are both equally terrific.
3019;Until recent years, when most people think of a Bill Murray movie, thoughts of Caddyshack, Groundhog's Day, Stripes, and classic SNL hi.
3020;Although these films are not considered groundbreaking, Murray has truly proven himself to be a comedic genius.
3021;Aside from his underrated yet profound performance of Hunter S. Thompson in Where the Buffalo Roam, Lost in Translation marks the beginning of Murray's transition into more dramatic roles.
3022;Throughout the film, Murray does an incredible job of portraying a man who is truly lost in his life and not knowing where to turn.
3023;He has a family, success as an actor, and large amounts of wealth.
3024;He does this so well that the audience can't help but feel his sorrow.
3025;At the same time, he is able to combine these feelings of loneliness with his world renowned humor in a very subtle manner.
3026;johannsen's performance is equally ground.
3027;breaking and compliments Murray's character very well.
3028;The chemistry that develops between the two on screen is just as humorous as it is beautiful.
3029;Charlotte and Bob are able to laugh at the people and situations they find themselves in and laugh at each other.
3030;This coupled with their natural dialogue allows the audience to relate to each of the characters very well.
3031;One is the idea of inspiring friendships, and that the connections that we make in our lives may not last, but are never forgotten.
3032;This of course comes through in the relationship that Harris and Charlotte form.
3033;Although they only spend a week together, the bond that they form is incredibly strong.
3034;The love and deep feelings that Charlotte and Harris feel for each other is handled smartly and romantically, because the two know that they live in a real world with real consequences.
3035;What started out as a surprising friendship develops into a deep, beautiful love story and the way in which the two discover they're soul mates will be cherished in the film world for years to come.
3036;By finding each other and sharing the experience they seem to rediscover themselves and realize the beauty of living in the moment.
3037;overall, I found Lost in Translation a positively terrific film with several elements all coming together in perfect harmony.
3038;For one of the first times in my life, I felt sad and happy simultaneously.
3039;From examining the nature of close friendships, to showing the fascinating and chaotic aspects of another culture, to someone's own personal soul search, there are many things that one can take away from this film.
3040;Plus it won all those awards?!?
3041;The writing and directing is this film is authentic and brilliant.
3042;The characters are beautifully brought to life by Scarlett and Bill, who fully deserve the critical praise they've already recieved.
3043;This film is purely authentic.
3044;These characters are real humans you feel like you know and understand on some level, regardless of what you think of them.
3045;This is the best film of 2003.
3046;She did risky funding all on her own to ensure final cut, and I'm glad she did.
3047;This film is original and refreshing.
3048;This film is a real experience, don't miss it!
3049;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
3050;I watched about half an hour of this movie and simply couldn't take any more of it, and I'm usually the type of person that gives these type of things a chance.
3051;i was compelled to see what it was all about.
3052;the vivid colors and artistic,unique film shots were all I could keep focused on.
3053;despite the artistic visuals,it seemed they made a mockery of Japanese culture,rather than embracing it,as some others seem to think.
3054;at the end of the movie I ended up going: That's it???!!
3055;That was the dumbest movie I have ever seen!
3056;Bill Murray is a great comic,and I would like to see Scarlet's next movie,but do yourself a favor and just skip this one.
3057;I think the beauty of this movie lies in its simplicity.
3058;But after watching the movie, I have much more respect for him as an actor (I've always loved him, but I love him even more now.)
3059;Because while there are moments where he seems to be playing himself, you realize (hopefully you realize) that the acting's a lot more subtle, and there's a lot more to him.
3060;It's completely natural and subtle and beautiful.
3061;And I felt that the overall message at the end, the overall feeling.
3062;It's just a very natural movie.
3063;i enjoyed it thoroughly especially soundtrack
3064;The cinematography is beautiful, the camera tech reflects and amplifies the story, and Tokyo is allowed to shine.2.
3065;crafted and the actions are significant.
3066;The nuances of the performances and what's said and what's not said, these things come together to create vivid character studies.
3067;And of course, to go with this.4.
3068;Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, and Giovanni Ribisi are all very good and convincing.
3069;I actually thought this movie hit the mark it was aiming for, in tone and in a consistent portrayal of themes.
3070;And it's a love story.
3071;esque conclusion, but I think it's more believable the way it all actually works out, and there's more emotional impact in the end in my opinion.
3072;It's about how these characters find each other and relate to each other so fantastically, in words but more importantly in ways words can't convey.
3073;The acting was amazing simply because you believe you are watching two regular people .
3074;Combined with a superb soundtrack, this film has easily topped my short list of favourite films.
3075;i give 2 stars, each for the actors.
3076;As for the restthe film goes everywhere and yet nowhere and when itit over the first thought in my mind is.
3077;Boring,with some interesting moments this is the mosthyped film of the year.
3078;I thought a second viewingwould change my mind.
3079;I liked this film very much for reasons a lot of other people did not .
3080;The fact that both parties had significant problems in their personal life aided and abetted this engaging partnership.
3081;this is the summary message of this movie, in my opinion .
3082;that it is possible to throw off all of life's problems, regardless of their enormous nature, by finding the right person in the right circumstance.
3083;This is what the cohorts did in Japan in Lost In Translation and I believe they did it very well.
3084;i've enjoyed many of Bill Murray's past films and liked his modest, subtle style in this movie.
3085;I believe it fit well with the overall scheme.
3086;It was more realistic than the folks portrayed in most movies and certainly more intelligent.
3087;It's also quite a travelogue in Japan, if that happens to be a passion for you.
3088;and bill murry is worthy of the other 2.
3089;is it any wonder she has yet to be seen in a movie since?!?!?!?
3090;It had won a handful of Golden Globes, and Sofia Coppola was the favorite for the Oscar for original screenplay.
3091;if it can make up for it with interesting and engaging characters.
3092;I do admire it, though .
3093;the shots of Tokyo are breathtaking, and Scarlett Johansson shows amazing potential as an actress.
3094;Some of the best shots of the movie are simply of her sitting in her hotel room, curled up as if to guard herself from the world.
3095;Watch it if you're wanting to simply sit and admire the filmmaking.
3096;If you're an intelligent, insightful individual, you'll LOVE this film.
3097;bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are both brilliant and adorable.
3098;Sophia and her crew have done a terrific job .
3099;the cinematography and lighting are beautiful .
3100;the bonus features are great (wish there were more) .
3101;A lot of the talk about the film before the Oscars was about Bill Murray's performance, especially after he won the Golden Globe, but I did not think it was his best work.
3102;I would still insist that it was Groundhog Day where he displayed the greatest range and had his most heartfelt moments (i. e., the last night with Rita).
3103;After all, two people can cling to each other through psychological intimacy as well as the physical.
3104;Bob and Charlotte have their own lessons learned from this experience and Coppola leaves it to the audience you draw their own conclusions.
3105;But even an intimate mediation can be a jewel of a film.
3106;watching the grass grow would be infinitely more appealing.
3107;As for art , I'll take groundhogs and ghosts any day.
3108;It is is a breath of fresh air to see on site filming in a country where a movie is set.
3109;This is a film that both my daughter and I were interested in seeing, given the acclaim that Bill Murray's performance had drawn.
3110;while this film has good production values, it simply meanders along in a loosey.
3111;One of these individuals is Bob Harris, a film actor on a career downslide, who now finds himself shilling whiskey in Japan for mega bucks, while his movie career is at an impasse.
3112;The other is a beautiful twenty.
3113;five year old woman, a Yale Graduate with a degree in philosophy, who is in Japan with her husband, a photographer who is working on a shooting assignment.
3114;This is a film that viewers will either love or hate.
3115;Although this film is simple, it speaks volumes in depth.
3116;I thought Bill Murray was brilliant and Scarlett Johansson was very impressive, being so young but proving herself as a very mature actor.
3117;This is one of my favorite movies, despite the R. rated elements.
3118;And it masterfully tells its story of loneliness and searching for love and meaning.
3119;Murray and Johansson are completely engaging.
3120;my overall personal take on this movie: it shows what the world is like when people don't have the teachings of Jesus in their lives, to love God and your neighbor.
3121;the film is a delightful work with a script that touches the heart and the funnybone.
3122;Murray's performance is excellent and he manages to even outdue his work in Rushmore.
3123;Johansson's work is stunning and she manages to match Murray note for note throughout the picture.
3124;By being able to pair off with Murray in such an equal manner, the relationship that developes is so much more engrossing.
3125;The Behind the Scenes documentary is over long with lots of dull spots, but there are several enjoyable moments in it.
3126;For one thing Murray is hilirious and his off screen antics are a riot.
3127;This is a riot, check out what Murray does with the surprise he finds in the box.
3128;Coppola has proved herself as a skilled filmmaker and has removed the sting of her performance in Godfather III.
3129;I'll probably give 5 stars after seeing it another time or two.
3130;I thought that Lost was realistic in a sense that life is made up of many small moments and relationships, that eventually adds up to a lifetime of experiences whatever they may be.
3131;Hats off to Sofia, and the main characters for a fine directed and well acted film.
3132;A dear friend recommended this to watch.
3133;One word about Murray's performance though: phenomenal.
3134;Those moments, like this film, are honest and fleeting.
3135;They can renew, just by letting us see ourselves through their eyes.
3136;a quiet, simple study on the most basic of human needs .
3137;A quiet film that says a lot.
3138;Laugh out loud moments are rare in high art flicks but this is one, and it has them.
3139;Thank you for this film!
3140;winning movie certainly won my heart.
3141;It's set in Japan and seems like a simple story.
3142;I laughed out loud at times.
3143;And at other times I was moved by each of their predicaments with their marriages and their search for meaning in their lives.
3144;Always, I was delighted with the film.
3145;There's a feeling of freshness throughout, as if the characters were just opening their eyes for the first time.
3146;It was well paced and the cinematography captured the reality of modern Japan.
3147;It followed the film crew from Day One and I loved being steeped in all that behind.
3148;She won an academy award for the best screenplay written directly for the screen.
3149;I can certainly understand why, especially as I came to understand the challenges of filming in Tokyo.
3150;i give this film one of my highest recommendations.
3151;Well i had much to expect before watching this movie i have heard good reviews and just in general had a good feeling about this movie.
3152;Movies that gives a smile on your face and makes you feel you want to be a better person you get the idea.
3153;bill murray is good at what he does just be himself and he does a great job on it.
3154;scarlett is sweet and innocent, but behind those soft eyes you can see maturity and determination.
3155;I really loved this film.
3156;It's the best film I have ever seen.
3157;I was determined to dislike this movie, for two reasons .
3158;This movie has stolen my heart!
3159;Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson are so sublimely perfect, and beautiful, in this film.
3160;This is a love story rooted in loneliness.
3161;How anyone can be lonely in a crowded city like Tokyo is almost unfathomable, but that is what makes the story so true.
3162;I loved the humor in the imagery, the stark contrasts between these two Americans and their Japanese counterparts.
3163;I especially appreciated the beautiful and refreshing ending.
3164;Many people I admire and respect hated this film, and that puzzles me.
3165;Kudos to you, Ms. Coppola, for a beautifully written and directed experience.
3166;Very Good movie sometimes when you are lost you find what you need in the most unlikely people or places.
3167;Sofia Coppola's remarkable filmscript and cinematography make this an extraordinary film.
3168;Bill Murray is at his ironic best, an American who is truly lost in contemporary Japanese culture as he visits Japan to film a commercial.
3169;Their observations about life and marriage are insightful, and the relationship that these two forge is exquisite in its beauty and its understated qualities.
3170;I enjoyed the odd role played by Bill Murray and appreciated the performance of Scarlett Johannson.
3171;I suppose I also liked the film's international setting in Japan.
3172;The various scense from in and around Tokyo made for interesting viewing.
3173;I'm guessing that most people will rate this a 2 or 3, but for me it was a 3.5 or 4.
3174;As for Bob and Charlotte, their interactions maintain the edge of people who are attracted to each other but not ready to commit to a relationship.
3175;Lost in Translation is nice to look at, with many great shots of night scenes in Tokyo and the surrounding countryside.
3176;It is a very relevant metaphor for today.
3177;It shows Americans in a small community of friends, which starts to become closer knit while they function in a foreign society.
3178;This is one of the best films I have seen, and I am confident in awarding it five stars.
3179;Lost in Translation is so beautiful, so touching, so hilarious, so deep, so entrancing/enchanting.
3180;Sofia Coppola, who wrote and directed, fully deserved the Best Original Screenplay Oscar she received
3181;John is friends with a cute blond starlet.
3182;John and Charlotte say I love you to each other many times during the movie .
3183;bob and Charlotte meet and form a strong friendship.
3184;Their relationship is so amazing
3185;The sweeping scenes of Tokyo are what make the movie so fantastic.
3186;The film also serves as a primer for anyone considering a trip to Tokyo.
3187;There is also Matthew's Big Hit TV, the Graham Norton.
3188;The extra contains Bob Harris' full segment on Matthew's show, from the point of the TV viewer.
3189;As the bride retires, a Mona Lisa smile on her red lips, you sense that Japan has much to offer .
3190;but it is elusive to a foreigner.
3191;It is the mix of modernity and tradition that makes Japan so captivating .
3192;well, that is part of the reason.
3193;I understand there are those who find this film beautifully realistic and a glimpse of people as they really are, but why watch a movie for that .
3194;mart and observe life as it walks by you.
3195;Out like a light about 3/4 of the way through.
3196;let Hollywood make exciting films.
3197;We want to be entertained.
3198;I mean it was very well acted and I do love both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannsen, yet, this movie left me feeling very unfulfilled.
3199;Most people don't understand whats it about but if you look deeply into the film it doesn't have much of a plot line but it does have some deep and interesting characters.
3200;interesting scenes of modern Tokyo nightlife and and a glimpse of just some Tokyo lifestyles.
3201;nominated film especially one as hyped as this one was.
3202;So it's pretty clear that the general public liked the movie a lot less than the critics.
3203;She was too young, beautiful, and vacant for him.
3204;And he was rarely funny.4.
3205;Few people in the real world believe Sofia Coppola is that much more talented as a director than she was as an actress.
3206;murray should have won the Oscar over Penn for his performance, in my opinion.
3207;One of the best films of the 2000's.
3208;Worth a look but don't expect the great movie that some made it out to be.
3209;While I did enjoy this movie, and especially Bill Murray's performance as a world.
3210;This movie was so well written and acted, thoughtful, genuine, touching and incredibly romantic that any negative review I see must stem from the audience simply not understanding this movie.
3211;The beauty of this piece lies in the subtleties of the performances and the portrayal of the characters.
3212;He is always in character and he never, ever becomes Bill Murray for even just one second, resulting in a believable and powerful performance.
3213;In fact, Murray and Johansson have great chemistry, despite the almost thirty five years age difference between them.
3214;She reflects on how her husband has changed during two years of marriage and how her own life lacks direction.
3215;headed starlet they meet in the hotel, than with his own wife.
3216;This is a love story.
3217;These two are drawn to each other and able to be completely honest and unguarded with the other BECAUSE they are strangers without any messy attachment from the past.
3218;i loved this movie because it threw two unlikely people together and forged an unexpected, intense relationship.
3219;The ending is powerful because when he whispers something in her ear on the congested streets of Tokyo, we don't get to hear what it is nor do we ever find out.
3220;The effect is a strong ending that is not predictable but remains true to the film's elegance, subtlety and depth.
3221;it takes real genius to write a screenplay with lots of scenes of people sitting around, looking melancholy.
3222;Much like, most of the Japanese scenes which were the 'look at the wacky Japanese' variety with the help of Bill's snide comments.
3223;This movie vividly captures the feeling of being depaysee (out of one's familiar surroundings).
3224;Coppola captures this ethos perfectly.
3225;Bill Murray nails the jaded Bob and his midlife crisis perfectly.
3226;Charlotte and Bob are both intelligent and highly attuned to the nonsense (e. g. Charlotte's husband's self.
3227;The scene where Murray sings More than this at the Karaoke bar perfectly captures the film's spirit: unpolished, ambiguous, heartfelt and ironic.
3228;I really wanted to see this film because of all the hype.
3229;I have actually heard critics say that this movie is better than LORD OF THE RINGS and it should win the academy award.
3230;This is one of my personal best film I have seen in recent years.
3231;It is true that Japanese people generally can't speak English .
3232;Lot of things about Japan/Japanese in the film happens in real life, and it can be funny and strange when you're not used to the culture.
3233;i would recommend this film to people who are getting fed up with popular films with extravaganza and spectacles (not that they are bad).
3234;That, at least, was both real and profoundly human.
3235;If you want a good, well.
3236;acted comedy about two strangers coming together on some common ground, get As Good As It Gets.
3237;Scarlett's talent is immesurable and her ability to play such a mature and lost young woman with such ease amazes me.
3238;Bill Murray, as always, is unparalleled in his humor and gripping performance.
3239;I am definitely in the love category.
3240;It is, hands down, one of my favorite movies of all time.
3241;I can see four stars.
3242;I thought it was a n excellent, refreshing film.
3243;Continuing to be entrenched in an existentialist stronghold, Sofia Coppola presents us with a great script coupled with impeccable acting by Bill Murray, splendid photography and an enviable soundtrack to go with it all: a perfect combination, if you ask me!The story deservedly earned Ms. Coppola (who was also the first American woman ever nominated for the Academy Award as a Director) an Oscar for best original script in 2004.
3244;The two, in the midst of their own particular crises, connect and a unique chemistry builds up between them that will capture you and leave you thinking, regardless of which of their ages you're closer to.
3245;murray's acting, with a very subtle sense of humor, takes the story to a level that not many other actors could, balancing his internal conflicts with the ability to laugh at himself and life at large, when things don't turn out as he'd like them to.
3246;A hilarious moment for history in this movie is his struggle when dealing with his wife's suggestion that they pick burgundy for the color of a new carpet back home, while in front of a whole group of red.
3247;The lights and visual elements in Tokyo help capture some breathtaking moments that transport the user to places remote for most of us, in a very surreal way.
3248;The music helps build atmospheres in ways that approach perfection: it's a great continuation of the effect Ms. Coppola accomplished in Virgin Suicides, a movie that French duo Air masterfully scored.
3249;In 'Lost in Translation', Air participates once again, this time alongside Kevin Shields (My Bloddy Valentine), Death in Vegas, Jesus Mary Chain and a handful of others to assemble a powerful and eclectic soundtrack that provides an unforgettable musical frame to the rest of the art of the movie.
3250;without a doubt, among the best movies of 2003.
3251;and that's what I think I liked best about it.
3252;The reason why this movie is so funny is the same reason certain scenes in Casablanca are so funny, despite the seriousness of that film's subject: dialogue.
3253;Because I haven't watched the movie lately, I'll leave it at that, and asure most of you that if you just relax and don't expect to see slapstick or stupid voices or people acting foolish, you might actually enjoy a movie that is funny in its simplicity.
3254;another thing worth mentioning is Bill Murray's performance.
3255;I'd hate to see Sean Penn try that, or even Jaime Fox a great actor, but when he does funny he can only seem to do a certain kind of in.your.
3256;Like its humor, its simply good, and charming.
3257;This is a character driven Comedic.
3258;comedy) and the chemistry between the Murray and Johansen is perfect.
3259;Issues aside, once you hit play it's about the film.
3260;Bill Murray at his best as a dramatic actor.
3261;A lot of reviews said this was a comedy.
3262;It's insightful and well thought out.
3263;The characters take some time to develop but are interesting and you find yourself liking them in the end.
3264;it's not a bad movie at all but it's more of a cerebral drama.
3265;And I'm so happy for that.
3266;ill Murray you are great.
3267;Enough of us love this movie just as it is, and thank you for it over and over again.
3268;When I was growing up the favorite films of my generation were movies like Bonnie and Clyde, 2001, A Space Odyssey, Death in Venice.
3269;It's a beautiful film from a brilliant script.
3270;Those who can't see it had better enjoy their slops
3271;All I can say to those who think nothing happens in Lost in Translation is that a lot happens .
3272;maybe critics and more informed viewers love this film because critics see more movies than you and realise how repetitious and inane most of them are.
3273;Maybe they love it because they better appreciate Coppola's subtlety and maturity, and because they can see how much of the characters' depth in this film is so masterfully conveyed .
3274;It gets better with every viewing.
3275;I'll probably watch it again this weekend.
3276;And it's amusing to see some throwing out the names of a few art films to establish their credentials for trashing this one.
3277;I've seen every art film mentioned here, and Coppola's stands well among them.
3278;Those who really love art movies should be more open to alternative visions.
3279;anyhow, the bottom line is the film was cheap to make (much cheaper than the horrendous Titanic ), has done very well financially, and has touched a chord in a great many people.
3280;I hope it gives Sofia Coppola the strength to make more films like this, and her excellent The Virgin Suicides .
3281;when something arouses such strong divided feelings, whether it's movies or sushi, it's always best to try it for yourself.
3282;i saw this film around Oscar time and actually got to watch 4 of the 5 nominated Best Picture films.
3283;Of the 4, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was by far the best and most brilliant, followed by Master Commander, then Seabiscuit.
3284;These films are entertaining and feature Bill Murray at his best.
3285;Though I am not a big fan of Cold Mountain, I think that film deserved the 5th spot for Best Picture much more than this movie.
3286;mainstream, independent or foreign films (that includes ones from Great Britain).
3287;There were flashes of greatness (Bill Murray's wife Fed.
3288;Maybe it's pure genuis and just like her characters who don't get what's going on around them .
3289;For some reason, this attempt got much more acclaim.
3290;Tokyo sparkles as the third main character in this sweet, platonic, slice.
3291;set in the dazzling confusion of a far and exotic city, the story is full of courteous characters who communicate beyond words.
3292;the music is atmospheric and dreamy, and the soundtrack includes Bill Murray's pleasant karaoke performance of More Than This.
3293;A Japanese gentleman in a suit also stood there.
3294;driven story illustrated their jet.
3295;But another daughter and I loved it.
3296;the understated, sometimes hilarious performances of the entire cast, including an over.
3297;top lounge singer and a Britney Spears wannabe are all excellent.
3298;After laughing at the lip scene and many others.
3299;this is a movie I think everyone should see.
3300;not only is it funny, it is very poignant.
3301;I just loved this movie.
3302;If you a real movie lover, you will love it too!
3303;The story itself is so simple but at the same time is so complex , at least for the people who are experiencing it.
3304;If you have been abroad for quite a long time you MUST see it, Im sure it will put you to think about your own experiences.
3305;I can certainly relate to the main female character Charlotte and understand her fascination with an older man.
3306;I dated boys my age, yet I found emotional and intellectual fulfillment in friendship with my professors.
3307;The difference is that Charlotte is young, and she still has plenty of time ahead of her to turn her life around.
3308;The movie is a terrific piece on friendship and longing, how they are symbiotically attached to each of our lives.
3309;The cast is magnificent and exemplary.
3310;On the one hand I enjoyed the touchy.
3311;feely way Murray SJ got to know one another other (I especially liked the ending myself).
3312;that I enjoyed so much as Lost In Translation.
3313;What we see on the screen developing between these too characters is very special and the viewer comes to know and like these characters.
3314;however, in this instance, every wonderful accolade that is bestowed upon her is well deserved.
3315;Her expressive eyes and wonderful and spontaneous laugh are so real and so evocative that it's impossible not to be drawn to her character.
3316;I find that she is able to convey more feeling with just a look or smile than most actresses can with an encyclopedia of script.
3317;weary and throughly likeable middle aged man who's been married for a quarter of a century to a woman.
3318;Throughout the movie, Bill will call his wife and you get a real sense that the passion and excitement of his marriage has long disappeared.
3319;it's no wonder that he finds himself drawn to this kindred spirit .
3320;There was, of course, real affection and trust between them, however, you sense that their relationship is far too special to sacrifice it for a roll in the hay.
3321;this is a very rare and special movie and after having seen it, I now understand why this movie was almost universally hailed as a tour.
3322;for anybody interested in human behaviour and interaction .
3323;Phew, what a breathe of fresh air this movie is.
3324;She is fantastic in this movie.
3325;congratulations Sophia, great job all round.
3326;I loved your choice of Kevin Shields for scoring the music.
3327;I'm sure he's happy too.
3328;When the Japanese director spoke in his native tongue for a full minute and the translator would have a 5 second interpretation for Bill Murray I laughed.
3329;That was as exciting as I found the plot.
3330;I still give the movie two thumbs down but thank the fellow reviewers for explaining what some view as good about this movie.
3331;Murray's Bob Harris has come to endorse a whiskey for a tidy amount of yen, and Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte (in another brilliant performance from this promising young star) has come with her hipster photographer husband, hoping to spend some time with him.
3332;In Lost in Translation we see these feelings onscreen, and the path these characters take and how they change their lives with each other's help is astonishing.
3333;Little moments shine, such as the patting of a foot, or an awkward moment during a fire drill, or the hilarious scenes that come out of some harmless jabbing at Japanese culture.
3334;Come on kids, they do it to us all the time.
3335;I've been there, and it's fun to poke fun.
3336;I've found myself in Seoul and Tokyo and Beijing and a dozen other Asian cities, alone and for extended periods of time.
3337;Anyone with an ounce of inquisitive spirit and ability to cope could not possibly sympathize with these two pathetic souls.
3338;What a charming and powerful this movie is!
3339;And of course there are some great trademark one.
3340;up, introspective and very very subtle.
3341;She effectively plays a woman at the beginning of her life path, when all the roads are open, yet none of them seems to be the right way to go.
3342;tokyo is a perfectly surreal backdrop for the brief encounter and surprising friendship of the two main protagonists.
3343;at the very end of the movie, the farewell scene is both exhilarating and reaffirming.
3344;We don't hear what Bob whispers to Charlotte, but one can imagine those words are the words of hope and love.
3345;all in all, the film is touching, beautiful, poignant, yet ultimately uplifting.
3346;Lost in Translation is a great mix of Hollywood comedy and independent drama.
3347;It works because of Bill Murray's terrific comedic performance, and Scarlett Johansonn's role as suffering wife to Giovanni Ribisi (who has yet to give a bad performance).
3348;made and funny, albeit not hilarious.
3349;lost in Translation is a sometimes funny, often poignant, and always sensitive look at the importance of being human and finding yourself.
3350;This is a touching and beautiful portrait of a romance that could never be, with real characters, not cardboard cut.
3351;I loved this film, my date admired it and was 'wowed.'
3352;Love it or hate it, Lost in Translation is a good film worth viewing at least once.
3353;I saw it a month ago, bought the soundtrack because it seems perfect for the visuality of the movie
3354;After seeing this movie most people want to focus on the relationship between murray and johansson.
3355;as a tale of unexpected friendship.
3356;But while almost everyone concentrates on this aspect of the film they are being bombarded with a subtle but profoundly conservative message.
3357;culture and/or consumerism is alien and something to be avoided and overcome.
3358;Murray's and Johansson's reactions when confronted with these alien phenomena are instructive.
3359;I loved the scenery and the small glimpses into everyday Japanese life, all meshed together with this love story of two people brought together by loneliness and uncertainty, with a musical soundtrack that brings out the best in all of it.
3360;no kid fresh out of tenth grade will ever be able to comprehend these emotions.
3361;This movie SUCKS, seems to be the way it works with these Amazon reviews.
3362;I recommend this movie to grown ups who like minimalist dramas and romantic comedies.
3363;This film is about human emotions.
3364;There's not a great deal of dialogue, but what is said is true and from the heart.
3365;The visuals are interesting, but not unique and filmed nearly like a travelogue.
3366;The relationship between Bob and Charlotte is part soul mate and part paternal.
3367;Instead, she allows them to bond in ways that show their physical and emotional needs without having to follow through on them.
3368;When Bob carries an exhausted Charlotte into her bedroom and places her on the bed, he tucks her in with the sweet caring of a long lost father.
3369;this was a wonderful movie if you can relate to it.
3370;Lost in Translation is a romance (kind of) and a comedy (kind of) where the romance is more genuine than that and the humor is more natural than we usually get in the mainstream.
3371;it's a sweet, sad, gentle, sometimes sardonic movie.
3372;The karaoke scene was hilariously true to life.
3373;Watch Japanese kids coming on like kids from the L. a. hood for an even bigger laugh.
3374;Just note how the things they experience reflect on their own lives .
3375;finally, all I really have to say is that it moved me.
3376;This is the first film that I have ever enjoyed primarily for visuality over narrativity.
3377;The story, smacking of the sensibility of the American uberclass, is one.
3378;For those who 'got it', it was several things: real, with unique plot, idea that is like poetry, introspective genius and what not.
3379;What has worked: cinematography, music, Bill Murray's acting.
3380;rounded AND intriguing movies out there
3381;But if you are looking for a movie that you want to call cool because everyone else does, this is the one for you.
3382;The whole interview looks like bring your kid to work day for Bill Murray.
3383;Bill Murray is Bob Harris, a once popular American actor who now, in his middle.
3384;This Tokyo excursion will take about a week, and the monetary reward will be quite handsome.
3385;It's about the place, and the points that each of these people are at in their lives.
3386;Both are young, and both are self.
3387;She has issues of her own.
3388;this is probably Bill Murray's most understated performance, and it works brilliantly.
3389;He conveys so much with just a smile, a frown, his body language, or simply the look in his eyes.
3390;He should get an Oscar nomination for this.
3391;Scarlett Johansson, who left me unimpressed in the movie Ghost World a few years ago, is excellent in her role here.
3392;She portrays Charlotte as a deep, troubled, yet intelligent young woman and, like her co. star, does it without overstating it.
3393;factly that it becomes both vulnerable and sexy at the same time.
3394;Johansson is definitely an actress to watch for in the coming years.
3395;sofia Coppola has succeeded in creating a sliver of time and place with Lost In Translation.
3396;It creates two of the most realistic characters to ever grace the cinema.
3397;it will cease to be the present, and will instead become only a nostalgic memory.
3398;Bill Murray was his usual funny self in this movie.
3399;it goes something like this: disillusioned middle.
3400;brainer, and it took the entire length of the film to get to it.
3401;another fine example of a film in which flash (the imagery, soundtrack, what.
3402;have you) is placed ahead of substance and the flash elements are made to appear substantial.
3403;Lost in Translation may be the most sophisticated American movie of 2003.
3404;It may also be the best.
3405;It is the kind of movie whose hierarchy in cinema history will be decided years from now.
3406;part of the `problem' is that the story is like a minimalist painting .
3407;A famous Hollywood star, Bob Harris [Bill Murray], travels to Tokyo to do some commercials for a Japanese whiskey manufacturer.
3408;All those time zones he has traveled through give him insomnia.
3409;Both will return to the lives they have been living, albeit positively changed.
3410;because of their intense loneliness, and because of the soul.
3411;Charlotte is a bright young graduate, and she has been married for two years only to a photographer (this is the reason why she is in Tokyo .
3412;this film, is certainly one of the best recent movies done.
3413;The movie traps you, and puts you into the shoes of the protagonists (the gorgeous soundtrack helping immensely).
3414;the story is one of affection .
3415;some of the scenes are poignant, and memorable.
3416;This is a great film!
3417;first, I'm going to address those two things.
3418;Although I laughed at times, this movie is a subtle exploration of two people out of there norms, lonely, and .
3419;well, lost is the right word.
3420;It simply portrays them in the way that most Americans would relate to if they were there.
3421;A lot of people just happened to think it's funny.
3422;Also, I thought it did many things to portray Japanese positively.
3423;The part of Bob must have been written specificly for Bill Murray because he is absolutely amazing.
3424;The girl, whose name I know but know I will mispell it, also did a fantastic job in her role.
3425;It was also a very fun movie for just identifying with loneliness and hoping to connect.
3426;I really liked that fact.
3427;But it was forgiven when they also came to that conclusion during the fire alarm, and it also brought up the question about if guys and girls really be just friends.
3428;i hope I have cleared a few things up and given a decent review of the movie as a movie, unlike many reviewers.
3429;I also hope that this helps those of you who don't knwo whether or not to see it.
3430;Obviously it's not for everbody but I think it's a damn good movie and highly recommended.
3431;This movie is actually cinematic, that is, it tells a story in pictures.
3432;There's a line by the poet Lorca, something like, Poetry is what survives translation.
3433;Sophia Coppola is that good.
3434;You're sensitive and that's really nice but those scenes where Bob and Charlotte are faced with the difference and make fun of the difference, its kind the point.
3435;It's part of the inadvertent neural coding that helps us to believe the movie.
3436;And I am way too old to get caught up in trying to change anyone's mind but if you liked this movie, check out Akira Kuurosawa's Dreams, it'll be right up your alley.
3437;Sofia Coppola is a genius, she's not as aggressive as her father, she's swewet, she's gentle, and mostly about business.
3438;Sofia Coppola's best film was The Virgin Suicides, which was overlooked.
3439;the way I heard about Lost In Translation was my favorite critic Roger Ebert who quoted: This is Bill Murray's best dramatic performance.
3440;I said Bill Murray doing a drama, well I'm pretty shocked.
3441;Murray has never done a great dramatic performance until now, he made me cry, he made me laugh, and made me cry some more.
3442;This is agreat film, and I can write a sonnet about Scarlet Johanssen.
3443;This movie was highly anticipated, especially because it was so highly thought of during the Oscars.
3444;The acting is funny and good and the American actors have done a good job acting in a way that they are completely out of place in the strange country that is Japan, this is the best of the movie in my view.
3445;the story is very good, about two people lost in Japan, a country with a strange language.
3446;people interested in Japan should also watch, it's really funny what you see of Japan.
3447;Staying in the same Tokyo hotel is Charlotte (Scarlett Johanssen, radiant and mature at only 18), a newlywed tagging along with her rock photographer husband, John (a typically awkward Giovanni Ribisi).
3448;Along the way, Charlotte and Bob run into each other and begin a 'brief encounter' that profoundly affects them both.
3449;when the movie hits you right, it's a pure pleasure from its unassuming start (a beautifully lit shot up Johanssen's underwear.
3450;Coppola delivers Bob into her movie with the impression that it'll be all about him, but Charlotte enters the story, and we're never quite the same.
3451;Scarlett Johanssen plays Charlotte with just the right amount of emotion that her initially morose and soul.
3452;for the first third of the movie, director Coppola displays her first brave choice in filmmaking by keeping Bob and Charlotte apart.
3453;The movie sustains this amazing vibe that doesn't stunt its progress, but propels it with a driving fluidity.
3454;the two glance at each other, faintly smile, and possibility is born.
3455;Before, we saw Bob Harris and Charlotte, respectively, at their most private and vulnerable.
3456;Thank God, for Bill Murray's rousing rendition of Elvis Costello's (What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding is a blast.
3457;I was amazed at the honesty of the character's responses.
3458;In a way, these two are some form of deeply odd soul.
3459;That is the heart and soul of Coppola's amazing work.
3460;translation has great comedic flair with Murray's wonderful work, but it's also perhaps one of the saddest and most moving films I've seen in a long time.
3461;It also has that Affair to Remember vibe too, where the journey of two souls that find comfort will eventually have to come to an end.
3462;Coppola simply lets her two amazing leads do the work.
3463;When the film does arrive at its final, ambiguous moment, it all just seems perfect.
3464;pop soundtrack that runs brilliantly throughout the film begins to play, and I find myself with a huge regret: that I won't be able to savor the subtle chemistry of Bob and Charlotte, and that a flat.
3465;out masterpiece in American film is at its end.
3466;The dialog and interactions of the cast, were well written and well scripted.
3467;it's very entertaining and works so well because Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen sell it so well.
3468;it's a relaxing movie that allows you to sail away on the personal journies of the two main characters, feeling enlightned and satisfied at the end.
3469;This film was very well done, and should be appriciated as an example of the fact that you don't need a $100 Million dollar budget to make a great film.
3470;Even the soundtrack is wisely used.
3471;I am a huge fan of Bill Murray and here he is so subtle, using his facial expression that talks more than a Tarantino's dialogue to describe a character.
3472;You see his face and you know what's going on in his life.
3473;The chemistry between Bob and Scarlett is credible despite the difference of ages.
3474;The final scene is just a gem with the now iconic Bob whispering in Scarlett's ear while saying good.
3475;bye for good and you'll hear Just like honey by The Jesus and Mary Chain.
3476;It's nice to have family in show business.
3477;Since when was it your job to make a movie enjoyable?
3478;So naturally I have to have a good screening process.
3479;I pop in my copy of LoT with the full intention of enjoying it.
3480;He lives through her youth and optomism, she through his age and experience.
3481;Together they teeter on the edge of sexual tension as well as burgeoning friendship.
3482;this is a study in basic human emotion and reaction to situation.
3483;The Coppola girl got an Academy Award for this I think.
3484;Any film with artistic aspirations seems to have a built.
3485;I might also respond to those reviewers critical of American film making by saying that most of the great European directors, particularly the French New Wave, learned their craft by worshiping at the feet of the great American masters of the thirties and forties.
3486;i remember reading that Francois Truffaunt was a huge fan of American gangster films, and in fact remarked more than once he considered them the only kind of film that interested him.
3487;The answer is simple: in an action film (yes, like Rambo, which was a very good film, by the way), the situations are heightened to an unusual level, thus characters in the film are themselves heightened and brought into sharp focus.
3488;Action films, in the most dramatic of terms, always have a very powerful conflict that needs resolution.
3489;What characters do under the extreme pressure, in action, is very interesting.
3490;Thus the experience of watching a good action film can be a very intense experience.
3491;what the zealous fans of this film don't get is this: it is very possible to dislike this film while at the same time getting every bloody, boring second of it.
3492;The last scene, which was the only gripping scene in the film, was very moving.
3493;Because Hollywood learned long ago how to make a great movie that keeps butts in the seats.
3494;This movie is simply one of the best movies of all time.
3495;If you have time to burn, see this flick.
3496;If on the other hand your time is valuable, see a movie written and directed by proven talent.
3497;I was never a big fan of Bill Murray, but when his comedic abilities are used perfectly to portray the ultimate cynical stranger, a great actor is revealed.
3498;murray and Johansson are two strangers faced with life's emptiness in Japan who bond as two spirits, two friends and maybe more!
3499;This is a very smart and deep movie that will leave you wondering, do you know yourself well enough?
3500;I left out the alcohol, and found myself really enjoying the movie.
3501;She is now hated by every woman, and loved by every man.
3502;The opening shot of Scarlett is actually influenced by a painting by John Kacere, which shows up later in the hotel.
3503;bill Murray is a master at everything he does (except Caddyshack .
3504;, and my favourite movie up until seeing this was Groundhog Day.
3505;He's an older, subtler version of Jim Carrey, a simple facial expression will have you rolling about the floor with laughter.
3506;Also the gym scene had me crying with laughter, and it got to the stage where it was painful.
3507;This was definitely a neat trick by Sophia, to really make you feel in touch with the lead characters.
3508;Scarlett's portrayal of a young wife is spot on.
3509;Instead, the Japanese, although not highly featured, were hilarious, treating Bill Murray's character like some God.
3510;Plus, the language sounds really fun, although learning to speak or write it looks like trouble.
3511;there was a great chemistry between Scarlett and Bill, that definitely came across in the movie, although their relationship was kind of like Thora Birch's and Steve Buscemi's relationship in Ghost World.
3512;Which Scarlett also starred in, and boy, she's come a long way!
3513;(Friends fans: both Giovanni Ribisi and Anna Faris have starred in Friends!)
3514;(Which in my personal opinion, is a really cool effect.)
3515;the ending of the movie had me in tears, as you knew perfectly well, that it was just a short friendship, that wasn't meant to continue outside of Japan.
3516;The whispered bit was a truly emotional moment, and is open to interpretation about what he said to her, and what it meant.
3517;It was the best part of the movie, apart from the gym scene.
3518;It was the perfect ending to a terrific movie.
3519;I loved the fact it just ended like that between them.
3520;the extras include: a conversation with Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola
3521;this is a really brilliant movie, and I urge everyone who hasn't seen it, to watch it at least once.
3522;In a few years, this will be considered a classic.
3523;Right now, it's just excellent.
3524;oh, and watch right to the end of the credits.
3525;Hey, it's no Shrek, but it's still funny.
3526;I absolutely loved this movie.
3527;It is still haunting me days after I watched it.
3528;The film techniques, the soundtrack, the way you get caught up in the actors' scenarios is brilliant.
3529;Bill Murray was absolutely amazing, he made me feel like I was right there with him in tokyo, and the relationship that the two had was so moving and heartfelt, I wanted to keep following them more and more to see what would happen next.
3530;The ending scene was heartbreaking and beautiful, and the fact that Coppola did not let the audience hear what Bill Murray whispers into her ear made it even more alluring to me.
3531;It left me wanting more, and that is the markings of a good film.
3532;I absolutely recommend this movie.
3533;Visually this movie is wonderful.
3534;Everything is bright and colorful and so unique that I was constantly gasping saying look at that!
3535;Bill Murry Is a treat.
3536;It's great to see him in a new movie just being perfectly Bill.
3537;Bill is the best part of the movie.
3538;There are a few very good lines.
3539;The actors are all great.
3540;It is worth seeing, if only to decide for yourself if the hye is worth it.
3541;This movie was nominated for Best Picture.
3542;My friend and I thought that when we went to see it live.
3543;So we sat, waiting for the good part to come .
3544;budget film that happens to have a big star in it and an association with another famous director.
3545;Murray gives the best performance of his career in Lost in Translation as Bob Harris, a middle.
3546;Lost in Translation is a beautiful almost.
3547;Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this beautiful movie, and Murray and Johansson both give exceptional performances.
3548;The friends we have there are very dear to us.
3549;There is a brilliance in this movie that we don't see very often.
3550;For those who watch the movie and have any sense of cultural appreciation and sentimentality, pay attention to the scences when Charlotte talks to her friend stateside (who sounds shallow) about her first trip to the shrine, or how she willingly accepts her first ikebana lesson.
3551;To see the Americans slow down and consider another country's traditions and cultural expressions as options to their own is a mature attitude, and I guess it takes a mature attitude to watch this movie and get it.
3552;See it for yourselves, and I hope you get to experience Japan some day.
3553;The movie is something you get on your own.
3554;This is really a movie that makes you think.
3555;great feats this movie pulled off.
3556;ending feature, and best of all, it's about normal people, who have normal problems, who live in a normal city.
3557;Having something like that is like having a bloodless videogame, it's extremely rare.
3558;This is simply a spiritual, moving movie, where nothing happens but is still good.
3559;You have to like quiet movies to love this one but it's a masterpiece.
3560;The cinematography in Japan alone is worth the price of admission but Bill Murray has never been better.
3561;and his young co. star is equally wonderful.
3562;It's a tender true story of what can happen when two strangers connect in an unlikely place and time, an improbable and unconsummated love story with a great mysterious ending.
3563;really enjoyable slice of life.
3564;Great performances, great visual flare, amazing culture shock.
3565;SHouldve got more oscars than it did.
3566;And despite being called trite, for the young and the enamoured of Jerry Springer, it's a lesson many could take to heart.
3567;That's why a vibrant city can seem so still and calm.
3568;grade truths in every other way.
3569;i applaud Ms. Coppola for having this sweet, pensive storytelling style.
3570;The film that should have won the oscar for best picture, 'Lost in Translation' is a fantastic movie on so many levels.
3571;on, as the actors perfectly embody the characters that they protray.
3572;peak at the lives of two people who could be anybody.
3573;I love Bill Murray and I really enjoyed Virgin Suicides Coppola's early effort.
3574;It is a suprisingly good film, one that has several layers of meaning.
3575;There are at least a couple scenes in which Murray makes fun of Japanese people for not understanding English.
3576;And Lost in Translation is definitely mind.
3577;Scarlett Johannson meets my expectations of a competent actor: She is able to leap from her own plebeian personality and transform herself into a literate, sensitive, beautiful young woman.
3578;Somehow, he has found his way from Punxsutawney to Tokyo.
3579;the movie itself is very touching.
3580;next year, I look forward to seeing Bill Murray as Gustav Mahler.
3581;Bill Murray is a comic genius.
3582;His marriage is on the rocks.
3583;bob and Charlotte happen across each other one day and suddenly their state of walking wounded has a buddy.
3584;Soon, they are spending every moment together.
3585;Probably due to writer/director Sofia Coppola being in love with her own vision.
3586;It manages to get through to us that these are good people who just need someone to understand them.
3587;One of the best and most interesting things about Sofia Coppolas's Lost in Translation is the unmistakable sense that we are viewing well and profoundly observed lives.
3588;Bill Murray need only raise an eyebrow to elicit laughs from an audience but here he takes the time and energy to actually give a performance not based on shtick.
3589;This has got to be the most BORING movie in the history of cinema.
3590;Lost in Translation is a moving film filled with light humor and heart.
3591;It has comedic and dramatic elements to it, and the two play together beautifully.
3592;The film is definitely one of those that people will either love it or hate it
3593;Either way, it is a film that easily stays in your head after it is long over.
3594;One night in a bar, he meets a young lady by the name of Charlotte, who's also visiting in Tokyo due to her workaholic husband who's doing some photo shoots there.
3595;Bob and Charlotte connect with one another in very little time and a unique bond of friendship is formed.
3596;term relationship is besides the point, but what is the point is those little connections we make on a daily basis and how much of a profound effect they can have on us.
3597;Like the characters and the story, the film is superbly subtle and low.
3598;The end result is a very entertaining and well.
3599;Bill Murray is outstanding as Bob Harris
3600;I can now see why he won a Golden Globe for his performance and am happy that he has also received an Academy Award nomination (which he really deserves, I think).
3601;Scarlett Johansson is an absolute joy to watch in her portrayal of the sweet and confused Charlotte.
3602;the movie is extremely well.
3603;Coppola is great at making us see these characters as real human beings rather than fictional film characters.
3604;She really establishes what she wants in her film and how she plans to achieve it.
3605;scenes documentary, extended and deleted scenes, a conversation with Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola featurette, a music video and more.
3606;The best feature is an extended scene of Bob's appearance on an over.
3607;It is outrageously hilarious, and I encourage everybody to check it out as soon as the movie is over.
3608;Lost in Translation is a superbly done film filled with humor and a number of profound little moments.
3609;A very nice and subtle movie that has more to it than what the eye simply sees.
3610;This is a great movie but perhaps it's too sly and understated in a time when over.
3611;top is almost the rule in movies.
3612;on and hilarious but he doesn't crack jokes or clown around much to make you smile, it's more subtle than that.
3613;most of the humor is in the gentle mocking of Japanese culture and the two leads' reactions to it.
3614;spirited way but there are aspects of their culture, especially the way they react to our culture, that are very amusing.
3615;This was understated, too, and well.
3616;johannson is also great, this was the first time I'd seen her in a film and I was SO glad they didn't cheapen their friendship with any Hollywood.
3617;december route right up until the last moment and then I almost applauded.
3618;All in all, this is a great film with moving performances, great cinemetography and just the right mix of humor and pathos.
3619;It's easy to see that writer/director/producer Coppola was paying attention when her father made movies.
3620;In the same hotel is a young wife who is traveling with her photographer husband, and is left to wander around while he works all the time.
3621;Yet, the rest of the time I did get drawn in to the wonderful mood.
3622;Life sometimes finds us in moments which create a whole lifetime by themselves.
3623;handling Japanese people, and connecting with this young woman in a friendship that is full of sexual tension which is thankfully never acted on.
3624;But for what it is, it does capture the emotions and mood of the moment well.
3625;I hope Bill Murray returns to what he is good at
3626;I'll give it 5 stars.
3627;This is very much like French New Wave movie from the early 1960's.
3628;I want to be able to control how and what I view.
3629;Her alias was Evelyn Waugh, the master satirist.
3630;Fit the scene and the whole movie perfectly.
3631;just a great, great movie.
3632;Now I could write a lot of things, but I noticed that what describes the movie best is the cover itseld!
3633;Perhaps the key to liking this movie is to be patient.
3634;It is her patience in letting this story tell itself through well.
3635;As a director, she allows the camera to dwell long enough on every situation to extract a high degree of clarity, and manages the actors' looks and positions to beautifully complement and emphasize their great ability to show emotional depth.
3636;I was truly impressed with her abilities as both a screenwriter and director.
3637;coppola's exploration of viewing as a trope is a powerful element of the film.
3638;She beautifully juxtaposes her highly visible characters with their feelings of inconsequence.
3639;She accomplishes this through her slowly revealing narrative and rich cinematography.
3640;For Charlotte, it is her beauty, marriage to a globe.
3641;clothed body from the title scene to near the end establishes that these characters' visibility is an intimate one for the audience.
3642;ups of both characters reinforce a high degree of audience voyeurism.
3643;it is with this understanding of viewing as a powerful trope in the movie that the title becomes so meaningful.
3644;Translation is, of course, a form of viewing the unfamiliar.
3645;And whether the translation is being done by one person or through an intermediary, the existence of the untranslatable is always a moment for introspection.
3646;By combining these two characters, at two very divergent points in their lives, with opposite ages and genders, sharing a common daily alienation of translation and introspection, Coppola creates a dynamic narrative that reveals itself in silences and incremental emotional clues that the characters give one another through looks and touches.
3647;It is clear what gets translated effectively: their emotional connection and affection for one another.
3648;But Coppola reveals that what is truly lost in translation are the closest relationships we all share with our loved ones.
3649;Bob's is a subtle one, where 25 years' worth of translated meaning resides in the spoken and unspoken relationship.
3650;These subtle mistranslations act like smooth rocks.
3651;Charlotte's lost translation with her husband is still new, a product of projecting desires onto one's spouse, which they both do.
3652;Interestingly, Charlotte's experience of the Tokyo world (which is concentrated in her sexual energy) is as subtle and inscrutable as the cause of the mistranslations in Bob's marriage, while Bob's experience of the Tokyo world contains glaring mistranslations that mirror Charlotte's marriage.
3653;The audience is given the ability to experience the space of shared introspection and the doubts and triumphs that it entails.
3654;The decades of Mr. Murray's acerbic wit and buffonery have masked his talent as a truly engaging dramatic actor.
3655;his breathtaking performance is a high.
3656;wire act of humor and sorrow.
3657;But this film, is like having one of those sernedity moments, of just exploring you mind on your life, as you stare up into space.
3658;mates that share a connection.
3659;But there relationship contents full of unqiue honest moments, in which they use each other to understand themselves better.
3660;Its kinda like one of those close intimate friendships, where you find a instant bond with each other, as well as learning from each other, and than parting.
3661;Is not sad, its bittersweet and leaves the sense of moving forward in time.
3662;i must say that this film, is gorgeous in showing the beauty of the city, and Sofia Coppola, has done it again!!
3663;I love the Virgin Suicides, and I must say that Lost in Translation shows more of the depth, and brillance that is contended in Sofia.
3664;i dont recommend this movie to others, but I must say that I (a 16 year old) loved the feeling of the film.
3665;Keep up the brilliant work !!
3666;This movie perfectly captures the feeling of being lost in another country, with nothing to ground you.
3667;I spent 4 years teaching English in Japan, and this is the first movie I've ever seen that conveys what it's like to live there.
3668;The movie manages to capture the soul of Japan on screen in all its oddness, without ever making fun.
3669;Even the quiet scenes in Kyoto, one of the most beautiful cities in the world, showed the peace and serenity that you can still find in many places in Japan.
3670;Things change in that neon light and circumscribed space (both physical and cultural), and Sophia Coppola does an amazing job of teasing out how you really DON'T always take yourself with you wherever you go.
3671;flop in the way Hollywood thinks now adays when one of the most highly anticipated films of the year is an art.
3672;Another rising star associated with Translation, Scarlett Johansson, has given further interest in the project thanks to her powerful performances in other art.
3673;the story focuses on separate lifes of a struggling actor and a young woman as they cross paths and discover that everybody wants to be found.
3674;Then one night, the two cross paths in the bar of the luxury hotel in which they are staying and from there spark up a surprising friendship together.
3675;The setting of the film in Japan is another stroke of genius considering the subject matter the feature deals with, that of necessity and happiness, which are values and topics greatly treasured in Japanese culture.
3676;Murray's deliverance of dialogue is rich with sarcasm and dark humor, which makes the performance all the more unforgettable.
3677;Scarlett Johansson gives yet another delightful performance, this time in the role of a lonely young woman who is searching for purpose in life.
3678;house gem that shows that companionship can be found in the most unlikely of places and gives emotional hope for those looking for it.
3679;The feature's entire emotional emphasis rides on the chemistry of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson and it works exceedingly well, beyond what even the most star.
3680;this movie proves his point.
3681;the first time I saw it I rolled my eyes and thought OVERRATED.
3682;Then I saw it for two for times and, like with most great films, the beauty came out.
3683;i though first overrated because what's the deal about this friendship (Scarlett and Bill's), what's so great about it?
3684;It's about just friendship and how great it is to find it when you're LOST and ALONE.
3685;It's just the fact a friendship can work w/o really anything in common with these people.
3686;the soundtrack is great and PERFECT.
3687;The ending will shatter your heart, too.
3688;kudos to Coppola for a magnificent film.
3689;A film you'll love and cherish.
3690;One of my all time favorites.
3691;If you are a Bill Murray fan, and enjoy his dry wit, you will enjoy this film.
3692;This could have been a terrific love story.
3693;On a side note, (A) Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson had chemistry, (B) the directing was very good, and (C) Scarlett Johansson is very beautiful and a wonderful actress.
3694;star reviews for this amazing movie.
3695;I like it because it makes me smile.
3696;i guess you can really come to identify with the characters.
3697;Critics watch the movie and see absolutely nothing of value in it.
3698;The cinematography is excellent and, of course, Scarlett Johansson is wonderful to look at.
3699;Even Bill Murray is pretty believable as a washed up actor.
3700;Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is a delicate, well.
3701;acted, visually astonishing film about the dislocation of being alone in a foreign culture and the desperate need for human connection.
3702;At the heart of the story is the brief encounter between Bob, a middle.
3703;The film is essentially a string of vignettes, without much in the way of a narrative line, and the story.
3704;Murray, especially, is revelatory: his face in middle age has taken on some of the craggy gravitas of Robert Mitchum and Johnny Cash, and the wounded, melancholy look in his eyes haunts you long after the movie has ended.
3705;But it is the poignant near.
3706;romance between Murray and Johansson that you will remember, as well as the stunning photography by Lance Acord, presenting Tokyo as a cross between Las Vegas and the Brave New World.
3707;I loved the nightlife, the colorful characters, thestrange looking food, the cherry blossoms in the gardens.
3708;the setting for the film was magnificent.
3709;as for the two main leads, the acting is superb.
3710;Scarlett Johansson approachesthe youthful object of his affection with understated sweetnessand grace.
3711;Highly recommended for those in search of a lightheartedand tender romance that doesn't follow traditional rules of loveconstructions in cinema.
3712;This movie is cute, but the end leaves you hanging.
3713;i think it is a lovely film.
3714;Bill Murray plays a very kind and funny man.
3715;It is easy to see why a young lady will feel some closeness.
3716;And Scarlet Johnson is a very sensitive actress as a young lady who's husband seems to not love her very much.
3717;i enjoyed to see the Japanese city and country.
3718;And it is a very quiet story.
3719;It is a very wonderful film.
3720;Drawn to each other by empathy and mutual mild but persistent dissatisfaction with their lives, Bob and Charlotte spend time together and develop a unique friendship in spite of their differences in age and background.
3721;The Virgin Suicides was an acclaimed novel which Coppola skillfully adapted for the screen.
3722;Her beautiful and enigmatic interpretation rightfully established Sofia Coppola as an up.
3723;She's a good director, but Lost in Translation shows that her original writing needs work.
3724;And several scenes that cleverly play cultural idiosyncrasies for laughs give us the impression that this will be a comedy, or at least a dramedy.
3725;She is presented as a clever and literate person, but she barely speaks.
3726;This is a relationship film, a character drama.
3727;Bill Murray makes Bob interesting and convincing, and Murray's performance essentially carries the film.
3728;Her mannerisms and way of dress are like Sofia Coppola's.
3729;The Japanese city provides a colorful backdrop and the opportunity for some comic relief.
3730;Sofia Coppola has plenty of directing talent, but if she's going to write original screenplays, she needs to make sure that her characters are well.
3731;drawn and that the tone and freshness of her writing carry throughout the entire film.
3732;Before I watched Lost in Translation, I was very excited to see it.
3733;I set out to watch a film that was original and inventive.
3734;Sofia Coppola did write an excellent script.
3735;The idea behind the film has a lot of potential, and the entire film was shot in Tokyo which added realism to the film.
3736;I was expecting to have a lot of laughs and to be impressed with the performance overal.
3737;The second is singing karaoke.
3738;to the extent that it could take days before you *realize* that you are in love.
3739;After living in a very modern Japan for seven months, I found the film full of the moments that make daily life here seem quite dream.
3740;The film is tasteful and sweet in its portrayal of Japan to an outsider and much more honest and accurate than films such as The Last Samauri or Kill Bill.
3741;This movie just proves if that you have enough marketing money.
3742;I get the feeling the reason many people like this film is for the cinematography, which is admittedly artfully done, because they are Johansson and/or Murray fans, or because they have the same condescending, dry, humor this movie has.
3743;I guess to some, expressing love means treating the people and aspects of their culture as funny props rather than fully, realized, human beings.
3744;the closes thing to this film is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which is incredibly better.
3745;I don't know what's up with some of these reviewers, but this was a terrific movie.
3746;It was happy, it was sad, it was pretty damn funny too.
3747;Lost in Translation is a gem.
3748;There've been so many good movies lately that I wonder if we're going through a renaissance of Hollywood movies, towards the great period of the early seventies, when the US was making good films about serious themes.
3749;Scarlett Johansson is a luminous talent.
3750;It's a name that already means a lot to film lovers.
3751;For me the movie lays somewhere in the middle.
3752;For her first movie, Sofia Coppola did an outstanding job, but she is nowhere near the director her father is.
3753;Shots of Tokyo is beautiful.
3754;It's refreshing for a hollywood movie to shoot film of modern day Tokyo in realistic terms.
3755;Scarlett Johannson is beautiful, sexy, cute and sweet .
3756;Perhaps but I'd say it's ok and was pretty funny and not boring.
3757;Like a nice dream that you wake up from with a smile on your face that will in turn make your day, this is exactly the feeling I got after watching Lost in Translation, Sofia Coppola's second feature after her acclaimed debut Virgin Suicides.
3758;certainly it has one of the most original opening scenes,I would go as far as saying,in Cinema history.
3759;one that will 'stare you right in the face' and will definitely bring a smile.
3760;in between discovering a whole new city, and finding some difficulties adjusting to the jet lag, the language barrier and their respective state of loneliness away from home, they meet up and form a friendship that will help them cope with their temporary but bewildered and confused situation.
3761;the last scene when Harris stops his cab after spotting Charlotte and runs to her, whispering something that remains intelligible, then they kiss for the first time, and he departs smiling, was a very powerful one indeed.
3762;bill Murray, I believe contributed greatly to the movie's success.
3763;he is a truly comedy genius that reminds me of Peter Sellers or even Louis De Funes, actors who can express so much just with one look.
3764;scarlett Johansson was a very able match, playing against a comedy giant like Murray, and I believe she is one of the best actresses of her generation, (and yes she has a really sweet laugh).
3765;the writing was excellent and Coppola managed to infuse gentle humor with three dimensional characters and with lots of sympathy, compassion and dignity.
3766;lost In Translation therefore is a type of movie that is rarely filmed these days, one that is beautifully shot, written,and directed by a woman who proved that the term Daddy's girl is in her case, very well earned.
3767;This is a very well done film, a strong script delivered by two excellent actors.
3768;My friends got so excited after I told them about the reviews, the golden globe awards, and the oscar nominations.
3769;I have a very deep interest in any movie that tells a story of human conditions within an exotic environment.
3770;Sometimes I would just say that I did not like amovie, but it is still worth seeing it.
3771;acting was very good, but you'll get great actors and performances in many other movies, too.
3772;We've seen it, please move on.
3773;This movie is very contemplative, it relies a lot on the spectator bonding with the characters, a thing that takes time to achieve.
3774;Don't
3775;in my opinion, Lost in Translation analyzes the most precious type of relationship: simple human affection based on honest communication, no other instincts, biases or interests attached.
3776;The story is told in the most delicate, subtle way, the precius style of true cinema.
3777;Bill Murray is very good in the lead role and deserves his nomination, but the Oscar should and will most likely go to Sean Penn for his incredible work in Mystic River.
3778;Scarlett Johansson, who was only 18 years old when this film was made, will become an even greater actress over time with maturity.
3779;The thing I enjoyed most about this film is the realism in the acting and the dialogue.
3780;The whispered ending was excellent, and I'm glad Sophie Coppola's script didn't let us hear what he said to her.
3781;It just reminded me of the feeling I got after watching The English Patient .
3782;All the critics adored it and then I saw it and wondered what the big deal was.
3783;I thought it was one of the two best movies I saw last year, the other being Thirteen.
3784;But the brilliant character study of a man realizing he's passed the high point of his life and is on the downward slide was unforgettable and poignant.
3785;The picture is completed by the intersection of his life with that of someone who has all of her possibilities in front of her, although she has a hit a momentary bump in the road.
3786;It adds more poignancy still that she is a gorgeous young woman who he probably could become sexually involved with, but won't, and with whom he falls into a rather chaste love.
3787;He casually sleeps with the chanteuse.
3788;I would guess, consistent with how I interpret the movie, that he said: I love you, but this is as far as it goes.
3789;Well all I can say is it's worth it.
3790;Charlotte is in the same hotel, with her husband, but he is constantly working.
3791;Bob and Charlotte meet a few times before really becomming friends, discussing family and life.
3792;Scarlett Johannsen is perfect in this movie, and Bill Murray is simply amazing.
3793;of documentary is a joy to watch, and you get to see how emotional Sofia gets when she is talking about Bill Murray.
3794;I give this movie 2 stars because of the nice scenery shots of Tokyo.
3795;But, I was one who just loved it.
3796;In Lost in Translation, I felt as if I knew these two characters and it was just beautiful.
3797;The movie, to me, is about cherishing those tiny irretrievable moments in your life that haunt you forever.
3798;Also, letting something wonderful be what it is, and not pushing for more.
3799;The acting was the best.
3800;And, Sophia has one of the deepest hearts in the world for pulling this seemingly simple idea off.
3801;And, doubt I'll ever see again.
3802;In the end, friend telling friend is what sells it.
3803;I have to tell you as a marketer that it must be far outweighed by the good.
3804;the ongoing marketing success proves it.
3805;Because this is a great movie.
3806;Small, sensitive, funny, romantic in an adult way.
3807;The rare movie likes this makes it easy to think it's worthwhile after all.
3808;With that kind of sample, the customer review graph of stars awarded is very telling.
3809;Peter Travers from Rolling Stone said, Flat out hilarious!
3810;The exclamation mark is a fabrication for the movie's promotion.
3811;sophia Coppola's altogether remarkable .
3812;And even funnier than that is that this almost completely improvised movie won Sofia Coppola a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award!
3813;And for coming up with nothing in the most important scene in the movie, she got the Oscar, when every other writer would have got the sack.
3814;There's only one good explanation for that .
3815;This is a movie about the kind of meeting of someone you know you're in love with from moment one, your soul.
3816;It's focus on the blossoming relationship of the couple is inspiring.
3817;weary character hidden behind a comic defense is nothing short of brilliant.
3818;Johannsson is a genuine star in the making, and deserves the highest kind of praise for her performance.
3819;Holding herself confidently with a hidden vulnerability, it's a multi.
3820;faceted performance which complements Murray's one perfectly.
3821;There are also some nice supporting turns and characters hidden here as well.
3822;Ribisi (narrator of Coppola's previous movie The Virgin Suicides) is just the kind of person you meet in real life who's primarily concerned with image, with having the perfect wife and the perfect job, rather than whether this is what he really wants.
3823;There's also a hilarious character in a young actress starring in a kung.
3824;If Bob and Charlotte are the emotional centrepiece of the movie, then she is the laughs.
3825;abosorbed but totally believable, she's a great comic actress.
3826;crucially, Coppola proves with Lost In Translation that she's a dab hand at creating dreamy landscapes, believable relationships and subtly complicated characters.
3827;It's particularly impressive that she not only directed but also wrote the movie and shows her to be one of the most promising new directors in Hollywood (alongside Christopher Nolan).
3828;These provide a nice counterpoint to the humour the film makes of Japan in the director of Bob's commercials and a hilarious Japanese talk show.
3829;LIT is an achievement of the best sort: gently humorous, beautiful, and genuinely touching.
3830;charlette is a young woman, fresh out of college, recently married, tagging along with her work.
3831;sophia Coppola's masterpiece Lost In Translation tells the tale of this friendship over the backdrop of Tokyo's amazingly strange and beautiful nightlife.
3832;The light and sound seems to come alive, pulling you in and sets a mood that lasts long after the film has ended.
3833;this is a tale of a friendship that the audience knows cannot last.
3834;It is one of those temporary, beautiful things that you want to go on forever even though they can't.
3835;As simple as that may seem, Sophia brings the story to the audience with such profound meaning, such satirical humor, with such a poignant relationship.
3836;But it wholly fulfills what it sets out to do and is a fantastic effort from Ms. Coppola.
3837;people may complain that the storyline or plot of this film is thin, but its simplicity is part of its charm.
3838;The aesthetics of this film alone make it worth seeing.
3839;Coppola's vision of Tokyo and in essence, her strangers in a strange land angle, is strong and prevalent from beginning to end.
3840;bill Murray's performance is outstanding, as well as refreshing.
3841;Scarlett Johansson is also convincing and well portrayed.
3842;the cinematography is amazing, and for me, very much part of the film's appeal.
3843;I was also thrilled with the ending.
3844;Overall, I just enjoyed WATCHING this film.
3845;A must see for any fan of Murray or Johansson, as well as those drawn to films centering around human relationship dynamics.
3846;i found myself relating to the film's characters on multiple levels and therein lies its strength .
3847;it's an introspective piece and rife with super dry comedy.
3848;it was just a story of a fading celebrity that finds himself lonely in a town of millions of people.
3849;but it did so well at the box office and the nominations?!
3850;bill Murray is always a good box office draw.
3851;the cinematography is beautiful, and sophia coppolla conveys the minutiae of the film's core emotional content wonderfully.
3852;a special mention is also deserved for the fantastic 'soundtrack' provided by 'that guy from My Bloody Valentine'', which accentuates the ethereal and dreamlike states of Bill and Scarlett's characters.
3853;what i found to be particularly intriguing was the concept of a 'small romance' that this film centres around.
3854;yet very real, very heartfelt and thought.
3855;it's kind of funny, everyone I know who likes this film is a Vin Diesel fan .
3856;they all like Triple X and the Fast and the Furious and this movie.
3857;teed, people will sit there with their jaws gaping going This is amazing!
3858;I know, I know, I DARED, that's right, I DARED to give this film one.
3859;An okay movie but as most of the reviews state, very oversold.
3860;This is one of Bill Murray's finest performances on film.
3861;whoever made the decision to shoot in Tokyo (the Director's, one can only assume), it was a brilliant choice.
3862;Add in the language barrier, the Japanese, their cuisine, great photography, great direction, great acting, and finally, a terrific script, and you have a masterpiece.
3863;Sofia Coppola's use of the clock while filming native scenes accompanied only with ambient noise is a mighty tool of provoking deep thought in the viewer.
3864;Truly it must take guts to consume precious film with such shots, else more directors would utilize the method.
3865;Murray has like, somehow, escalated multiple levels here in connecting with an audience.
3866;Here's a fellow who is nearly 60 years old, and yet, the most amazing inner talent is just now being revealed to us.
3867;ms. Johansson plays the perfect newlywed here.
3868;It must be seen and heard to believe
3869;It is the height of goodness that a human could possibly feel in such a place.
3870;This story is easy to relate to because everyone feels alone at some point in their life.
3871;Bill Murray and Scarlett J are perfect.
3872;On the other hand, if you are honest, you may feel moved to saying that the king has no clothes on.
3873;What a beautiful, thoughtful and sweet movie this is.
3874;Sofia Coppola is a brilliant storyteller and has crafted a film with more warmth, heart and intelligence than most films out today.
3875;casting Bill Murray in this role might be the best casting choice of 2003.
3876;He is so wonderful as this character because, honestly, in many ways he is this character.
3877;He did hold on, albeit not with the same superstar power he once held, and has managed to grow and mature into one of the best, most underrated actors of our day.
3878;As for Scarlett Johansson, again with the great casting choice.
3879;She has the freshness, vulnerability and energy to carry this off, yet such depth and maturity as well.
3880;She is wise beyond her years and yet still so young, and a gifted actress.
3881;There is chemistry beyond chemistry between these two and that's a big reason the film works, because with less talented or poorly matched actors we might be a bit turned.
3882;And the fact that Coppola was honest and true to the characters she created instead of taking the easy way out speaks volumes of her integrity as an artist.
3883;We have been conditioned to look for the happy ending, and our version of happy ending is happy ending in bed.
3884;But these are real people on the screen, with real lives and real consequences which they cannot forget about.
3885;And their decision to remain true to the others in their lives, their understanding of the imposibility of their being together, is much more moving than any climactic (no pun intended) romp in bed could ever be.
3886;But we know they understand each other, and we can see that it's enough for them.
3887;everything about this film is just so perfect.
3888;Tokyo is bright, beautiful and exciting.
3889;The dialogue is tremendous, most especially in the quiet, intimate conversations which are seemingly meaningless but are actually the meat of what makes the characters.
3890;It takes greater talent to pull off a scene like that than a highly.
3891;And the message is so heartbreaking and beautiful.
3892;Lost in translation is a great piece of work depicting a simple plot layered over Japan.
3893;Two Americans find each other and create a friendship, although it may not have lasted long, it stays with them forever.
3894;Sofia Coppola well deserved the Oscar for best original screen play and personally, and Bill Murray should have won the Oscar for best actor.
3895;I urge you to see this movie even if you don't like romances, it gives you a new perspective on how frail but beautiful relationships should and can be.
3896;natured picture than she previously has.
3897;Lost in Translation's subtleties are its greatest achievements, while the actor's performances are the impressive allies to a compelling story of love, life, chemistry, and respect.
3898;She is staying with her photographer husband while his is in the country for work.
3899;An instant bond is established and the two slowly begin to realize that they are the best suited company for one another.
3900;eventually Bob and Charlotte go out together on the town.
3901;The fact that the age difference is obvious to the audience makes some of the subsequent scenes more intense.
3902;therein lays the true beauty of this film.
3903;For the next couple of days they utilize their time to the fullest by enjoying their time together.
3904;At this point, it's in the open and the two realize just exactly how much fun they've had together over the course of their visit to Japan.
3905;This is a friendship that could very easily be taken to the next level, but somehow the two are smart enough to understand that this is something that just needs remain where it's at.
3906;It's such a beautiful scene, though.
3907;It's one of the true highlights of cinema in the past several years.
3908;everything about Lost in Translation is in the right place.
3909;As I stated before, it's the subtleties that make it so great.
3910;This movie is the best work that the vastly underrated Mr Murray has done since Groundhog's Day, and I feel that Ms Johansson has a brilliant career ahead of her.
3911;i also particularly enjoyed the sequence at the beginning of the movie where Murray, looking like a burnt.
3912;Ms Johansson turned in an intelligent performance of an intelligent young woman who seemed to have married too soon, and to someone who did not appear to be her intellectual equal, a young man superficial enough to be dazzled by a pretty air.
3913;I am confident her day will come!
3914;If you had any interest in Garden State or Rushmore then you will really be able to crawl into this movie.
3915;bill Murray has always been an interesting choice to star in movies that don't sport a hard.
3916;core comedy theme, but he is seemless in this movie.
3917;(Oh, and the music is fantastic!!
3918;One of the secrets of a good film with a personal vision is that people who share that vision will love, people who do not it (or who'd be better served by The Terminator or Titanic) will hate it, but that it will provoke strong responses in all of themLost in Translation has over 800 comments, which are mostly either 5 stars or 1.
3919;This is one of the great ones.
3920;for a movie that has a funny man in the leading role, I found that most of the movie just made me very sad, but I found myself laughing all the same.
3921;The scenes in which Johanssen and Murray play together are filled with laughter and the happiness that one feels when surrounded by friends, and are starkly contrasted by the scenes in which they are apart, and we are reminded of the fact that the characters are away from home and loved ones.
3922;As a frequent traveller, I know both of these feelings well, the laughter during the day that makes you forget that you are far from home, and how it often hits you like a ton of bricks when you are alone in your hotel room.
3923;What made me enjoy the movie more was the fact that it took place in Japan.
3924;Having spent some time there myself, I watched this film and often found myself remembering odd occurances and the eccentricities one finds while being an American in Japan (the scene in the private Karaoke suite is great).
3925;I think that this movie captures this feeling in such a marvelous manner.
3926;they both find one another as lonely lost soles and talk to one another about their life, and so they understand each other sounds intersting right, well two star's for trying.
3927;Scarlet Johanssen has major talent and will go far!!!!
3928;Critics proved with this something I have ALWAYS believe.
3929;For me personally, I loved this film.
3930;this is a wonderful, beautiful, perfect movie.
3931;If you're the type that wants to show how cool you are, you'll probably love this movie, but if you're looking for something authentic, you won't find it here.
3932;I really wanted to enjoy this.
3933;I will tell you what the film illustrated for me.
3934;And it is a funny film
3935;I attribute this to his maturing age, and maturing talent.
3936;key way about her, which I think is rare for such a young actress.
3937;This kind of quiet dignity lends more credibility to her performances.
3938;That said, her physical resemblance to Jodie Sweetin is striking.
3939;It's also about how we interpret each other's signs and behavior.
3940;That's a rare and beautiful thing.
3941;i like what Tokyo brings to the movie.
3942;i wondered how such an honest film could get made.
3943;The good news is such an honest film got made because so many people wanted to see it.
3944;it's nice to see the David of true and honest film.
3945;I am so happy this film did so well, and that as many people love it as much as I do.
3946;Maybe, that way, we'll see more like it.
3947;i bought this movie mostly because Bill Murray is always funny.
3948;I really like Bill Murray, but his female co. star said it best, just another male mid.
3949;I love to watch anything Sofia Coppola produces.
3950;She just has a unique view of love and friendship.
3951;It was then that everything makes sense and I realized that Lost in Translation is such a special film.
3952;best to put me asleep on Sunday afternnoon.
3953;the main characters in the movie were filthy rich, staying at the nicest hotel in tokyo, and didn't enjoy themselves at all.
3954;the two main characters just cried a lot.
3955;Scenes like the prostitute, and the guy with the bb gun, are, um, unrealistic at best.
3956;also if you think silence is meaningful try meditation.
3957;This is one of the best films of 03?
3958;This movie may be considered slightly above average at best.
3959;She ventures out, a little, mostly to places that seem familiar and urban.
3960;I realize Japan has its share of culture shock, but her attitude was a bit over the top.
3961;this was also one of the draggiest movies I'd seen for a while.
3962;fartsy emphasis on visuals overwhelms the story line, and I found myself Lost in a Coma a number of times while watching it.
3963;with a fair amount of sensitivity and more realism than a lot of hackneyed relationship flicks.
3964;Great American cinema isn't dead after all.
3965;Sofia Coppola follows in her father and cousin's footsteps and establishes herself as one of the most gifted moviemaker of her generation, ranking high alongside Scorsese or Tarantino.
3966;Lost in Translation is a powerful and insightful film about one of the most fundamental of personal inquiries purpose.
3967;In other words, it is a movie about soul searching.
3968;Virtually all of us, at some point in time, will ponder our place in this world asking who we are, what we are supposed to do, and with whom we are supposed to be.
3969;While not a perfect analogy, it is a visually intense way at revealing, albeit imperfectly, the feeling of an individual struggling with their place in the world.
3970;Some may have an epiphany, finding themselves in a moment of clarity.
3971;The question of purpose is fundamental, and, as revealed by the characters in this film, is often a life long inquiry facing us at the beginning of life (Charlotte) or in the middle of well.
3972;But by struggling together, it makes life bearable, and even, enjoyable.
3973;It is a deep connection a bond that allows them to overcome their melancholy, venturing through life together.
3974;Just as it is a far better experience for a foreigner to visit a foreign country with a friend.
3975;A bond between two such lost souls is often more powerful than the disposable sexual relationships that permeate our culture today.
3976;It simply shows them, as best as can be done through cinema.
3977;This reveals the brilliance of its direction.
3978;The audience will feel what the characters themselves feel.
3979;cinematically, this film is superb.
3980;Which is also very very funny.
3981;Bill Murray does a fantastic portrayal of Bob.
3982;Only someone with his comedic skill could portray the sarcastic and subtle comedy of Bob's character.
3983;Scarlett Johansson is absolutely brilliant.
3984;She portrays the young, well.
3985;Her character is absolutely genuine, struggling with life even though she ostensibly has all those traditional indicia of happiness and success: a hansom husband, money, connection to fame, opportunities for world travel, and an Ivy League education.
3986;Bill Murry deserved the Oscar for this film though, he is hilarious.
3987;A must see film for everyone.
3988;comedic take on it adds the twist of a foreign setting, Tokyo, Japan.
3989;Both are married, yet neither is happy in their marriage.
3990;Neither is willing to betray their marriage, so the movie is an extended play on foreplay and flirtation.
3991;The dialogue between the two is realistic enough, though not that engaging.
3992;The only worthy cinematography was the scene where they witness a Japanese couple on their wedding day.
3993;I love this movie it is the closest thing to the old Woody Allen movies of the seventies.
3994;Bill Murray is superb with his trademark bemused expressions, as for Scarlett Johansen she is a very beautiful talented actress with a great future ahead.
3995;they should both win the oscar for best actor/actress.
3996;also Anna Faris is great as an airhead A list actress, demonstrating her comic potential further from The Scary Movie pictures.
3997;soffia Coppla is establishing herself as a great director of her father's (old) work.
3998;But I will add that I saw this film when it first reached the theaters because The Virgin Suicides had convinced me of Sofia Coppola's brilliance as a director and because I was anxious to see a Bill Murray performance which had received such extraordinary critical acclaim.
3999;I know brilliant, sensitive music critics, for example, who simply cannot stand Mozart but love Wagner.
4000;But if you are the kind of person who is fond of well.
4001;made, subtle, bittersweet love stories which move at a slow pace but build up astonishing power along the way, then you should at least consider watching Lost in Translation.
4002;I am truly amazed that a young person could create such a detailed, mature, moving, and personal film
4003;The filmaker's brilliant choice in the ending underscores the intimate bond created between the characters.
4004;From me, this is the ultimate compliment.
4005;From the sweeping and understated opening shots of Tokyo to the painfully real relationship depicted therein, this film is moving and, in a way, comforting.
4006;If you can live with a movie that brings a reality close that Hollywood so often chases away .
4007;Bill Murray did a great job of portraying a somewhat washed.
4008;But it also very delicately addresses the subject of confluence, convergence.
4009;What it does have are two good actors who reveal the loneliness that sometimes creeps into everyone's life.
4010;Living in Japan, I did smile at the goofy karaoke scenes.
4011;it is wildly popular here and the tv shows are equally crazy.
4012;The dizzying backdrop of the lights of Tokyo adds to the feeling of disconnect in the two main character's lives.
4013;Parts of it made me pause and reflect.
4014;miss Coppola made a film that serves as an homage to the high Neorealism films of Italy.
4015;Minimalist in nature, yet rich in content.
4016;This film teaches audiences how to truly watch a film.
4017;I felt she knew she was playing a bimbo and made sure the camera captured it.
4018;nevertheless, this film will remain timeless.
4019;It's a proud film to follow Scarlett Johanssen for the rest of her career, a great performance that Bill Murray will be remembered for, and an extraordinary feat by Sofia Coppola.
4020;Fall into a mad affair, beautiful love scenes, and a dreamy goodbye.
4021;It's quiet sadness, quiet love, and quiet goodbyes
4022;But at least that had a cohesive story development.
4023;That means there was a point to there time together, right?
4024;Admittedly I went into this film with high expectations: I had heard it was quite good.
4025;In the end, it seems, she was unable to solve it even for herself, so she leaves the ending an enigma, and not even an engaging one.
4026;Yes, there is some wonder, some oddity and confusion, some loneliness and introversion, an assessment of your life especially compared to what's going on around you, and an amplification of your own thoughts because you're isolated.
4027;His use of humor in the reality of his characters is great.
4028;Lost in Translation is one of the best movies of 2003.
4029;Lost in Translation is a wonderful movie.
4030;It is a well put together, beautiful piece of art worthy of the praise it has received.
4031;humanity, both collectively and as individuals, has a void which it is incapable of filling.
4032;People disconnect from each other and abandon true community.
4033;This at first sounds like the plot for a standard romantic comedy (especially with Murray involved), yet Lost in Translation, in its fiercely honest portrayal of the lonely brokenness of the human condition, transcends its genre.
4034;but that brings up another whole series of questions.)
4035;On top of it all, we are caught up in the imagination and lifestyle of lands created by people drowning in their own terrible voids of doubt and meaninglessness.
4036;the truth of this movie, though perhaps only implied, is this:Not many of us are wise.
4037;Not many of us are strong.
4038;Yet when we grow still, when our struggles cease, there is a weakness stronger than our strength, foolishness wiser than our years.
4039;In the silence it lifts us up.
4040;all through Sophia Coppola's young life, she has been surrounded by people telling her how brilliant and sensitive and wonderful she is.
4041;a film about, by, and for the snobs.
4042;It was nearly as memorable and engaging as watching the movement of two floaters in a broken toilet.
4043;The photography was great, though.
4044;burn cinema full of subtlety and thoroughly unclassifiable.
4045;hole it is to diminish Copolla's understated masterpiece.
4046;The dialogue when it flows is careful and measured, yet the long silences often speak volumes with the chemistry between the pair against the vibrant background of the city.
4047;Emotive, endearing and thoroughly absorbing it's unlike any film you've seen.
4048;The best aspect of this movie is Scarlett Johanssen.
4049;Her beauty just radiates the screen among other parts of her body.
4050;Bill Murray as the road weary movie star is well executed.
4051;This movie is beautiful, but the full.
4052;And Bill Murray was nominated for an Oscar for this performance?
4053;Let me start by saying I love Bill Murray and I thought he did an excellent job in a REALLY SLOW movie.
4054;Perhaps the filmmaker was trying to show us how boring and sad some people's lives are, if that was the intent, then the film was a success.
4055;I kept waiting on something interesting or exciting to happen, and before I knew it the film was over.
4056;This is an amazing movie, in all aspects.
4057;I felt very much in friendship with humankind again when I saw it.
4058;it's not a common love history but it's the most beautiful that I have ever seen, I hope it reaches your heart the same way it reached mine.
4059;I guess you have to be a little more mature and or wise beyond your years to appreciate a gem of a movie like Lost in Translation.
4060;Making movies that touch the heartstrings and make you feeling good, very emotional, and thought.
4061;And the more realistic the story the better.
4062;I thought Bill Murray and Scarlett Joahnsen were superb.
4063;I think Scarlett Joahnsen is gorgeous and she had me beleiving throughout the film how her feelings were developing for the aging John.
4064;I also liked the musical score and subtleness of the story.
4065;The first time I was engrossed in the budding love between the two main characters.
4066;It's straightforward, it's real, and in small parts tragic.
4067;but that seems to what many enjoy.
4068;the love between the two characters was the reason I watched it.
4069;The Karaoke scenes were good but the rest of the interaction and dialogue was pretty much passe.
4070;there are plenty of movies where a middle age man meets a young woman and sparks develop.
4071;I was happy because now I know I'm not crazy.
4072;His noble gestures with the young wife were somewhat unbelievable, and were made all the more admirable because of it.
4073;It's sweet that they were able to become friends, but the audience wanted more.
4074;Murray is capable of more, and has in the past given more to his artwork.
4075;Nice footage of modern Tokyo and Kyoto.
4076;charlotte and Bob meet and find a kindred spirit in one another and an unlikely friendship is formed.
4077;the Good: It was great to see Bill Murray take on something that is a little outside of his norm and succeed at it and a great performance by Scarlett Johansson as well.
4078;Anna Farris also has a small part in Lost as an actress who has just filmed a Matrix like movie and she nails her part and gives an excellent performance.
4079;this was great writing and directing by Sofia Coopola.
4080;The scenes and the way they were shot were great at letting the audience know what was going on with the characters.
4081;the score was perfect and with the combination of great directing and acting the emotions of the characters and their internal struggles were excellently conveyed.
4082;If that sounds interesting then pick this up and give it a try.
4083;this allows you to better identify with the characters.
4084;which brings me to one of the things i loved about this movie.
4085;the character development is fantastic.
4086;i seldom watch movies becasue i find many to be one.
4087;the dialogue is well placed and thoughtful.
4088;the music score and visual cinematography contribute to make a beautiful and flowing movie.
4089;in fact, the film portrays japan and tokyo beautifully and makes me want to visit the land and the people, something i never really cared to do before seeing this film.
4090;i guess the best thing to do is watch the film and see what you think.
4091;However, I felt like the reviews were so good, the screenplay won an Oscar, and Bill Murray was nominated for one, so they had to be missing something.
4092;He should have been shocked when he received the nomination!
4093;indulgent tripefest.you can thank me later!
4094;But some people want to get inside of something and discover more richness.
4095;A great percentage of the people don't want a challenge.
4096;And maybe that's where art is.
4097;It is artfully done, however, with a lot of quiet, gentle touches, and it is very pretty to look at, so you're not supposed to notice.
4098;How wonderful it would be for the Sushi chef to announce to him that he indeed understands English, and crack him over the head with a rolling pin.
4099;freshly graduated from Yale, very pretty and improbably a philosophy major.
4100;That beautiful young women far from home can be comforted by cynical, drunken old men?
4101;There is a great scene in which Murray is playing golf, on a beautiful green course, alone, and with an incredible Mt. Fuji as a backdrop.
4102;Indeed, from a director so young, it shows a great deal of promise.
4103;perfect cast, Sofia Coppola won an Academy Award for this riotous look at aspects of Japan, and the friendship of Bill and Scarlett.
4104;The first time you realized that love was more than infatuation.
4105;life is full of epiphanies and moments that become mythical and hyperbolized in frequent memory replay.
4106;This is the beauty of this movie, it's ablility to realistically portray the honesty of human feelings within a dream.
4107;like setting of a very real location, Tokyo.
4108;Tokyo itself becomes a character in this movie as Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) interact with the city, observe it, are dwarfed by its size, and are mesmerized by its oddities.
4109;like, you are catching these moments in their raw honesty.
4110;coppola's work as Director is flawless, and the movie was perfectly cast in all of the parts, from Bill Murray as the washed.
4111;up actor and Scarlett Johansson as the soul.
4112;this movie can make you think of those unlikely memories that you rarely visit, and it takes the audience into the depths of a relationship that is so human in its complexity and so identifyable in its innocence.
4113;Plus the soundtrack perfectly captures the feelings that the director attempts to ossify in the audience's memory.
4114;It blatantly bucks the traditional hollywood.
4115;It is actually somewhat of a disservice to the audience that this film was marketed as a comedy, since much of the humor is very subtle, and the movie overall does not seem like a vehicle for humor.
4116;Every frame, every movement, every feeling it created in the busy, vibrant setting kept my eyes, and my heart, glued to the screen.
4117;bill Murray and Scarlet J. do a phenomenal job of creating subtlety.
4118;But that is the magic of it!
4119;The beauty in the story comes from the fact that Bill and Scarlet go off on a little journey that is totally separating them from the schedules, boundaries and relationships of the realities they live in.
4120;This is a movie that builds very slowly to a soft anticlimax.
4121;what makes some films beautiful are their plots.
4122;What makes others beautiful are their cinematography.
4123;This is a film that is made beautiful by its ambience
4124;It's a film that urges you to get inside the characters, and feel what they are feeling rather than simply watching what is happening on screen and waiting for it to be dramatic or funny.
4125;When Sofia Coppola stormed the silver screen in 1999 with her breakthorugh movie Virgin Suicides, you could clearly see that talent really does run in the family.
4126;That film was still somehwat rough around the edges but the touching story, the soft visual language, and her choice for music (Air) made up for it thousandfold.
4127;He has found himself a new audience in Japan, a country that still remembers his past glory and is fascinated by everything American.
4128;And Sofia Coppola knows both of those stories very well.
4129;the visuals and the story are both subtle and the right word for their characterization would be observational.
4130;And both Murray and Johansson manage to bring this story and their characters to life with an amazing grace and intense realism.
4131;In Lost In Translation Sofia Coppola uses that very subtlety to speak of the same feelings and does it on a backdrop of modern Westernized Japan.
4132;overall, I think that this is one of the best movies of 2003 and that Sofia Coppola is one of those young directors whom to keep my eye on because her future is deffinitely bright.
4133;It seems that weren't it for the fact that Peter Jackson just has to get an Oscar for his magnificent achivement of bringing Tolkien's world to the big screen, Sofia would be my top choice for the Best Director Oscar.
4134;Sofia Coppola took a big gamble making this movie, IMO and I think she succeeded beyond her own expectations.
4135;But hes been underrated, I see now: hes absolutely superb in Lost in Translation.
4136;Its a beautifully understated film, sad and funny, bittersweet and gentle, subtle and forceful.
4137;I thought this movie was breathtaking, The acting was top.
4138;notch and the dialogue was incredible, adn Bill Murray was suprinsingly great in a dramatic role.
4139;A long time ago, there lived an Emperor who was very rich and arrogant.
4140;He pampered himself and he loved expensive clothes.
4141;So, everyone from the Emperor to his ministers said that they could see it and mentioned how beautiful it was.
4142;the reason I told that story is because I feel this movie is something like the clothes.
4143;the story is set in Tokyo, a city bustling with life and color.
4144;A friendship is formed between the both of them as they share some weird moments together.
4145;Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte did a good job, she's a talented actress and I have much respect for her but unfortunately, she can just do as much as the script allows her to.
4146;I love intelligent dialogue, witty humour and sometimes just plain facts presented in an entertaining way, none of which I felt present in this movie.
4147;It really was a surprise for me when she took home the Oscar for this category.
4148;Good thing I have HBO.
4149;i think the main reason this film did well is because people are unsatisfied by the end, so they essentially feel that there is a big catch to it, but i can safetly say that there is not, its a 50 year old and a 25 year old having fun together, which is rare because they are so depressed.
4150;Boy, this is a divisive one.
4151;Lost in Translation was one of the best movies of last year.
4152;There's so much subtext in Mystic River that you catch a second time.
4153;And the same goes for this one.
4154;What some people love .
4155;I was happy to wait.
4156;bill and Scarlett are great.
4157;Is the picture beautiful in this film even?
4158;Scarlett is very pretty and easy to watch.
4159;This movie has a nice slow and even pace and is fun to watch.
4160;The movie starts with a wonderful shot the lovely Scarlett Johansson's 18 year old butt, and only gets better from there!
4161;already something clever for the viewer to appreciate.
4162;Film buffs who enjoy finding cinematic allusions to earlier films should find allusions to The Third Man and to Betelgeuse, as well as others which I failed to notice.
4163;to me, Dinner With Andre was more exciting than many movies about car crashes, because it was about exciting ideas.
4164;Lost in Translation is more exciting because it is about exciting emotions.
4165;Like life, it is funny at times, poignant at others.
4166;These days, we have the privilege to catch a glimpse of how the movie got made, the scenes that ended up on the editing floor, the interviews with the cast and the production crew.
4167;Whilst this movie is great to watch, it doubles the fun to watch the additional features mentioned.
4168;Truth to be told, Sofia's effort is rather commendable for her second feature films.
4169;rated comedian and actor from Hollywood, Bill Murray.
4170;She got the inspiration to set the location in Tokyo after her change of career from acting.
4171;My personal opinion tells me that Scarlett Johanssen's character is a real.
4172;life depiction of Sofia herself.
4173;What made Lost in Translation special is the mood that the movie is able to portray
4174;Perhaps, in the end, they both parted ways but the truly wonderful memory and their stolen kisses shall linger on for as long as they live.
4175;Keep up the good work.
4176;First let me say : Bill Murray rules in this movie, and it really is a good, warm and quiet 99 minutes piece .
4177;score and drama there to spice it up.
4178;But at the end of the movie you still are able to feel with the young married girl and the aged actor as they struggle to find the right words to say good.
4179;The man has a funny face!
4180;It's not a comedy, but I feel good after watching it.
4181;english a lot of fun.
4182;And the two main actors here has done a great job I think.
4183;LIT certainly has its moments.
4184;As a friend I wont reveal any of them to you.
4185;Just know that the film isnt the most interesting character study.
4186;The movie is about two American strangers who meet each other in Tokyo and find solace in their ability to communicate with each other, verbally, emotionally, and psychologically.
4187;Theres a female lounge singer, a couple of male bar frequenters, a young female Hollywood star, a Hip.
4188;hop producer, and at the last minute, a tall, blonde, 30 or 40 something beauty, who is a fan of the main male character, Bob, a middle aged actor played by Bill Murray.
4189;Why, I wonder, did she create these characters in the first place?
4190;The guy only has a few scenes to speak of, and when hes on screen, hes consistently unaffectionate towards his effortlessly beautiful wife.
4191;It is possible to create a character we love to hate, right?
4192;He doesnt even meet a beautiful, intelligent Asian woman who speaks the language, or an Asian guy who speaks English.
4193;respecting heterosexual man wouldnt be capable of smiling at her lovely face, or body?
4194;Her character is looking for attention and for the meaning of life.
4195;What, you ask, are the films redeeming qualities?
4196;She could have scored it to the sounds of My Bloody Valentine, as well as every other band out their with a dreamy rock aesthetic.
4197;while this may seem boring to some, it's a joy to watch for those patient enough to adjust to the extremely talented Sofia Coppola's style of storytelling.
4198;is beautifully filmed, with the city of Tokyo and it's residents front and center in this quiet little film.
4199;But it's the unlikely love story that leaves the biggest impression.
4200;The romance, is sweet and in keeping with the rest of the story.
4201;both Murray and Johannson do a fantastic job of bringing their characters to life.
4202;and Murray, especially in the last scenes of the film, is able to convey so much.
4203;It's an amazingly effecting performance, and definitely his best work to date.
4204;The behind the scenes footage shot during the filming, is especially entertaining.
4205;My favorite moment is seeing Coppola as excited as a little girl on Christmas morning just knowing that Murray is in Tokyo, and her crying when she realizes her dream of making the movie is coming true.
4206;Thought of for the goofball characters he created on Saturday Night Live and in such comedy classics as Caddyshack, Stripes Ghostbusters, his acting ability is overlooked.
4207;But as he proved in those films and equally great turns in Ed Wood, Groundhog Day, Rushmore, Hamlet, Wild Things and others, the man can act.
4208;In Lost In Translation, he gives a performance for the ages.
4209;Both us each other to escape the confines of the hotel and escape for a few nights out on the town.
4210;This produces one of the film's most poignant moments when Bob sings Roxy Music's More Than This .
4211;In the performance, you see Bob baring his soul to Charlotte.
4212;The brilliance of the film is in its quiet nature.
4213;Director and writer Sofia Coppola has learned well from his famous father and she has crafted a subtle yet powerful and emotional film that is one of the best films of 2003.
4214;Directed by Sofia Coppola in 2003, the drama/comedy is stunning and full of flavor with the help of the vibrant city of Tokyo, Japan.
4215;As a great friendship evolves into something that some of us would simply envy, Bill Murray and Scarlet Johanson deliver award.
4216;winning performances as the fun loving characters Bob and Charlotte with the help of a great musical score and creative filming techniques.
4217;Once they meet and hang out some, something in Charlotte inspires Bob.
4218;She seems to seek peace within herself since her husband is so occupied with work.
4219;Early in the film Charlotte visits a temple of worship.
4220;Charlotte's witty, intellectual personality sets the stage for Bob's sarcastic, yet almost empty personality.
4221;overall, the film is a great feel good movie.
4222;On the other hand, I suppose it is the genuine connection between the two that give the film its eloquent status.
4223;The music was more than just a great score.
4224;It helped create and to generate the audiences emotions.
4225;rock playing lightly in the background represents how she is feeling at the time, upbeat and feel good.
4226;Lastly, the soft piano playing in the bar, as Bob and Charlotte poetically connect, is another example of the music complementing the films content.
4227;The music altogether complemented the films characters, content, and filming style.
4228;positively, the most creative and artistic part of the film was Coppola's use of Tokyo's decorative and magnificent city lights.
4229;The technique of filming outside of a cars' window to see the reflecting lights on the window is a stunning technique that Coppola utilizes more than once in the film.
4230;I particularly enjoy those shots, because it is the city and its color that enhances the films overall character.
4231;The massive city, bright lights, and great crowds of people, demonstrates how being lost in translation can simply mean more than a simple breakdown in communication.
4232;Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation is fresh, unique, and honestly refreshing.
4233;If you've ever been in a hotel in a strange city, lonely and unable to sleep, you will instantly identify with Bob Harris (Bill Murray), even though Harris is a well.
4234;instead, the story takes Harris and Charlotte down unexpected Tokyo alleys while the two try and sort out their lives.
4235;this film is directed with an eye to a stylistic capture of the reality of modern Japan.
4236;Bolstered by impressive cinematography (especially lighting and camera angles), it keeps the viewer interested and engaged as Murray and Johansson deliver consummate performances.
4237;Indeed, this is by far Bill Murray's finest work.
4238;top characters in everything from Scrooged to Ghostbusters, we see an actor with depth of voice, emotion, and facial expression.
4239;But if you are the sort who enjoys slice of life, good dialogue, and a touching tale, well, order it now!
4240;This is the first movie I have ever bought that didn't allow me to skip the previews at the beginning of the disc.
4241;Lost in Translation is the finest film I've seen so far this year.
4242;It's subtle yet brilliant portrait of a washed up movie star (Murray) who esapes to Japan to film some commercials and photo shoots and a young college grad (Johansson) who joined her newly wed husband to Japan for his photography assignment.
4243;The two of them come together and find comfort in each other rather than spending their sleepless nights wandering in certain limbo.
4244;Great work by Director Sofia Coppola, who has proved her own individual talents with this brilliant romantic comedy.
4245;i will start off by saying, i absolutely loved this movie.
4246;this movie is first and foremost a character study.
4247;it has funny parts, it has dramatic parts, but mainly it is a look into the life of two people.
4248;that having been said, if you like rich and vivid characters you may find yourself liking this movie.
4249;both johansson and murray are absolutely great in this film.
4250;they play the characters with a passion that is rarely seen in films (at least in my humble opinion) today.
4251;we have seen flashes of greatness from murray (ex.
4252;and although johansson is basically a newcomer, she plays the part with a style and grace rarely found in actresses of her age.
4253;When a movie is sparse in humor, action, and storyline it is considered character driven.
4254;Critics will always give movies like this one rave reviews.
4255;japanese people pronounce the L as R (Example: have a nice fright.
4256;i enjoy the dry wit and charm of Bill Murray.
4257;He adds to every movie he is in, but this is far from his best work.
4258;He sounds like 15 year old as he excitedly tells her about the party he had gone to and the crazy music they were playing.
4259;His new relationship with his soul mate Charlotte has helped him recapture his youthful lust for life.
4260;the larger theme here seems to be that seemingly dissimilar people can learn a lot from each other and form a strong bond when circumstances bring them together.
4261;mate Charlotte, but a karaoke singer he meets in a bar).
4262;Would this be considered growth?I give the movie 2 stars only because Bill Murray is charismatic and likeable as always.
4263;Interesting to see once, but never again.
4264;This film captures that feeling of being lonely in a crowded room.
4265;It's beautifully subtle, but not above having fun.
4266;The jazz singer character is hilarious, as is the American action movie starlet.
4267;I liked it when it first came out, but watching it again now I really feel it.
4268;The only saving grace this movie had was the beautiful scenery and a few really cool scenes into the true Japan.
4269;The film centers on two intelligent and introspective people who happen on one another whilst at a cross.
4270;This is a peaceful and thought.
4271;one that I watch as one might enjoy a dish of comfort food.
4272;I've been a fan of Bill Murray's work for many years.
4273;Hits the nail on the head with angst and loneliness brought to the forefront in two well.
4274;I recommend checking it out from your local library.
4275;I completely identified with both of these characters and I felt it.
4276;Also, the soundtrack is cool.
4277;In case the title confuses some, I think this is one of the 10 best movies of 2003.
4278;very true, but it's not trying to be.
4279;Nevertheless, I smiled and nodded at the movie's undeniable charm.
4280;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give the best performances of their career.
4281;johansson was equally good in Girl With A Pearl Earring, but she's perfect here.
4282;She's lonely, but makes efforts to cope with that.
4283;As far as Murray goes, I prefer his comedic turns in Rushmore and Groundhog Day, but I will say that he perfectly captures the character of Bob Harris, and acheives what he tries to accomplish with this role.
4284;Roger Ebert said it best Bill Murray is becoming the master of minimalist expressions.
4285;She acheived what very movies do for me.
4286;i felt like I was actually there in the world of the characters.
4287;When they were having fun, so was I.
4288;Sofia Coppola is patient with their scenes together .
4289;i don't believe Lost In Translation is a masterpiece, but it is an excellent movie.
4290;, can anyone deny that this movie is something unique?
4291;impressed audiences admit that Sofia Coppola tried to go for an emotional response that few filmmakers have attempted?
4292;Because there is no conventional plot structure or character development, but instead pure experience and emotion.you will never see a more genuine motion picture.
4293;i wish I could recommend this movie to people, and it saddens me that most don't enjoy it.
4294;i love this movie, but it's an excellent film that somehow is Not Recommended.
4295;This is a film that you have to be in the right mood for, otherwise it is way too slow.
4296;jerker, but it does remind you of those times when you had a short period of really feeling comfortable.
4297;For some, it may be a summer romance.
4298;For others, it may be spending a warm summer afternoon with their favorite pet.
4299;The ending leaves it unknown just enough to keep you in that mood for a while.
4300;Good movie for the right circumstances.
4301;I just saw Lost in Translation for the first time today and I was impressed.
4302;The writer and director want us to experience being in a lonely place (and boy do they suceed!)
4303;I know that I can think of a number of times that has happened to me and there is a lonliness and sadness unique to such an experience.
4304;Lost in Translation is a tribute to all the misplaced persons who found each other briefly and then moved on.
4305;It is a beautiful movie with exactly the right ending.
4306;familiar place,modern Tokyo, in the splash of dazzlingexcitement and color this filmimmortalizes.
4307;The visuals would beenough to hold you for an hour and forty.
4308;modern amazing
4309;Thought this movie was boring?Yes, it's funny, people know my love for indie films, watching my share of unknown, but truly profound movies.
4310;For the love of god, do something exciting.
4311;Here's a good idea to make this movie indie, add a few elements that other movies do and pawn it off as something new, creative, and anti.
4312;take a comedic actor and make him more serious.
4313;s. extra star added for the nice cinematography and atmosphere
4314;He is received in a style at the Park Hyatt hotel that befits his fame as Bob Harris the movie star, and now the spokesman for SunTory Whiskey.
4315;At the same time he declares for the camera that It's SunTory Time, he is something of a disconnected insomniac, pacing around the suite and looking for something authentic.
4316;We see what is perhaps a lampoon of some of the goofiness in the Japanese popular media, but Bob is game, and manages to crack a few unobtrusive jokes to keep the Bill Murray legacy alive and indeed perfected.
4317;Charlotte is transfixed by Bob, and wonders if he is in a mid.
4318;, but Bob just appreciates finding a friend who'll really listen to him.
4319;For those who loved the ineffable Bill, ever since he declared that that's the fact, Jack in Stripes, this film is an incredible treat.
4320;We're talking Best Actor, without a doubt, on par with Jack Nicholson's final emergence in As Good as it Gets.
4321;It is as if Charlotte has found a kindly comfort in this unusual mentor, who is fully willing to go to some decadent parties and off.
4322;Bob Harris, though, is enough to keep you in your seat, and Bill Murray now has a local capstone on his cinematic legend as great as the spire of the 52.
4323;if you are a Bill Murray groupie you will love this film.
4324;i am always in search of something good to say about a movie.
4325;There you have it, a positive aspect of Lost In Translation.
4326;Captures a few days in the lives of a middle.
4327;aged actor and a beautiful young philosophy student who connect in Japan.
4328;life direction, the subtle and natural dialogue, the beautiful and haunting cinematography of Japan and the wonderful music make this like watching a dream.
4329;The movie, it's sweetness, bittersweet joy and subtle characters, stayed with me for days like a great novel.
4330;bill Murray gives maybe his best performance ever, nuanced, expressed, understated.
4331;Makes you glad to be alive.
4332;Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray are excellent, and their relationship develops beautifully throughout the film.
4333;coppala had done a great job of creating a film that doesn't follow the traditional Hollywood requirements for a good movie and instead has given us a masterpiece.
4334;She treats Tokyo with a great deal of care, the city itself becomes one of the characters in the movie as Johansson and Murray find themselves lost (and not happily touring) the place.
4335;truly excellent, and in my top 5 movies list.
4336;I saw this film in the theater with my wife and we both enjoyed it.
4337;Having lived in Japan for over a year I can say it's very accurate how you might experience the country for the first time, and I am very impressed that the director mirrored my experiences so well.
4338;My wife who hasn't been to Japan left with the impression of how foreign and unwelcoming it is, because the director really did a good job of creating the feeling she wanted.
4339;I thought it was more true and realistic than the typical Big Fat Greek Wedding, showing two people drawn to each other because of their own difficult situations, though they are obviously not soul mates .
4340;I'm impressed with Bill Murray's acting in this movie.
4341;This is masterpiece of filmmaking and people who dont like it probably dont understand it for what it is.
4342;Coppola put alot of heart in this film and showed she got skills like her father.
4343;The cinematography and music were perfect for this type of film.
4344;Its obvious The movie had alot to do with soul searching and loneliness but it all comes together as a love story.
4345;Coppola showed a connection between two people in a unique way.
4346;I understand why this film won so maney awards, and I think it can definitly be called art in a movie form.
4347;Mostly set in a luxurious, high.
4348;when the two meet in the hotel's lounge, they find more than a pleasant conversation.
4349;Though their relationship is strictly platonic, it provides the intimacy, respect and genuine love that each craves.
4350;written and directed by Sofia Coppola, LOST IN TRANSLATION is a magically atmospheric film that completely transforms the bright lights and excitement of a hectic, world.
4351;Here in the bath of neon lights, Coppola delivers the black and white world of psychological struggles, generation gaps and genuine unrequited love.
4352;Both are like Polaroid's of a memory.
4353;This film is a gem.
4354;I am going to sum this up by saying that Sofia Coppola's vision and the actors performnces made me feel like I was let in on a wonderful idea that works extremely well.
4355;It simply presents itself and you get on the train and engage your self, or you decide to movie.
4356;One has to wonder what was really said (hence the title), and this really adds to the feeling of isolation.2)There is the fact that these two Americans actually meet and become very good friends due to similar circumstances in their lives.
4357;Anyone knows that having a good friend is important, but it becomes even more so when they are isolated in a foreign country.
4358;So Murray and Johannsen connect big time.
4359;Anyway, the end is the culmination of how Murray finds himself through feeling he has and expresses for Johansson.
4360;This movie has a lot of subtle humor and it can convey quite a bit of meaning.
4361;I found it enjoyable but do not recommend it after a hard, stressful day of work.
4362;If you get this movie, it is five stars all the way.
4363;This movie is a work of art for what it is.
4364;As for the soundtrack, I found it absolutely wonderful, which like every other element of this film, people seemed to either love or hate.
4365;And remember, For fun times, it's Suntory times.
4366;it was subtle, gentle, intelligent, great acting, just the right balance of everything.
4367;It was nice to see this movie.
4368;This guy is one of the few good actors in Hollywood, a pit he has been so underestimated all these years!
4369;He has this thing that you just look and get engaged, what is essential for his role in this movie.
4370;But the story is very simple.
4371;nice guy (Bill Murray) meets a nice girl whose husband lets her too much time alone.
4372;well, what does everybody expect to happen here?
4373;Seeing the trailer one can understand what this movie is really about.
4374;I'm just saying this is a good movie, I enjoyed it, I hope you enjoy too, and you get an enriching experience as I did.
4375;Let us face the facts, no relationship is perfect and wonderful all the time.
4376;The truth is that one wouldn't be necessarily more happy just switching partners every time things are not so good and one meets another nice one.
4377;I kept waiting for something important, something relevant, or something even the slightest bit exciting to happen.
4378;Being a big Bill Murray fan, I HAD to see this movie.
4379;Murray has some classic movies on his resume .
4380;, Caddyshack, Rushmore, etc. but by no means is this one of his best.
4381;There are some great shots of the city of Tokyo, a funny scene in a karaoke bar, and lots of boring talk and people staring out of windows.
4382;i found the ending to be very satisfying, leaving me wondering how a woman as young a Sophia Coppola could get inside the head of a 50 year old male.
4383;The premise is not strange but it does have an exotic air to it.
4384;I really loved to see how this change came about as well as the sexless love affair that ensued (the lack of sexual intimacy put more weight into the affair making it seem somewhat more potent and on some levels more disturbing when regarding their marriage partners) within this setting of glittering towers, high tech commercial visual displays and little restaurants.
4385;Another great film but not one that was a crowd pleaser.
4386;Both of these films are too layered and subtle to be popular.
4387;The clip shown on the oscars is the best 1 minute of this movie.
4388;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give amazing performances.
4389;In a word, this is a wry film.
4390;And that's a good thing.
4391;If you read any number of these reviews, you'll be able to read a very long synopsis of this move.
4392;so basically, if you're as big a fan of this movie as I am, you'll enjoy this version.
4393;It's a simple story: two discontented souls with massive jet.
4394;lag, and big relationship issues, meet by happenstance in Tokyo, and provide comfort to one.
4395;within the simplicity Ms. Coppola nails jet.
4396;lag, ennui, relationship discontent, and Americans abroad with a gentle, humorous, and deft touch.
4397;Bill Murray shows something near genius, and Scarlett Johannson is lovely and effective, though she has less to do.
4398;The supporting characters are also well drawn, and the players inhabit their roles.
4399;It was a pleasure to watch, and I recommend it for a mellow evening at home.
4400;Well, I did enjoy the movie, but not in that big deal way.
4401;It's an artsy movie that I would best classify as a set piece.
4402;Their time together is sweet, and it is nice to watch their relationship grow, and you are left with the impression that they will always have Tokyo.
4403;bill Murray turns in a good performance.
4404;a believable portrayal of an aging actor.
4405;Scarlett Johannson does a good job as well.
4406;Bill Murray's best work, in my opinion, still has to be Groundhog Day.
4407;so, it's an enjoyable movie, but I guess I'm a bigger fan of more plot.
4408;driven movies, with a climax to the story.
4409;I had read so many rave reviews in the newspapers and watched critics say it was one of the best films of the year.
4410;when I finally started watching it I kept expecting something funny to happen, after all, Bill Murray is one of the funniest actors alive (Groundhog Day, King Pin), but it wasn't funny.
4411;So immediately I said to myself, what a jip!
4412;He won the golden Globe award for best actor in a Comedy?
4413;but beautiful at the same time.
4414;i still think that Bill Murray's best performance was in Groundhog Day, but I am very happy that he has been nominated for an Oscar for this film.
4415;take John Travolta when he won the Oscar for Pulp Fiction, for example!
4416;I think Bill Murray should beat Sean Penn for best actor this year (2004).
4417;Perhaps the finest touch in Coppola's screenplay and direction is that her characters don't emote at each other.
4418;I think a lot of viewers here are put off by that
4419;bill Murray's character is a man who clearly enjoyed earlier parts of his life but is gripped by tremendous late.
4420;perhaps the finest moment comes at the end, when Murray realizes that there is no way he could ever maintain a relationship with this girl, but also appreciates the way in which she gave him a spark of energy that he thought he had lost forever.
4421;A very good touch to conclude this film which never insults the viewers' intelligence.
4422;This movie is subtle, whitty, and charming.
4423;A superb work of art for Sophia Coppola.
4424;Shots of a brilliantly lighted techno.
4425;I can't help but wonder how parallel the main character Bob Harris is with the real life Bill Murray?
4426;My favorite Murray works are Caddyshack, Groundhog Day, Ghostbusters, Stripes, What about Bob?
4427;This film is a splendid mix between comedy and drama yielding a refreshing balance between too corny and an intense love story leaving you still awake and sometimes laughing aloud.
4428;Tokyo should be one of the most exciting places in the world to go.
4429;This comedy is dark and it's looks like Bill's shows his own personally to be a lead star and earn an Oscar nomination for this movie.
4430;I wasn't thrilled with this film when I saw it a few years ago in the theater but after watching it again I found it to be very amusing and entertaining.
4431;Murray and Johansson have good on screen chemistry and the situations and settings they are sharing in Tokoyo offer great context for their reactions.
4432;Murray actually gives a very understated performance.
4433;Pretty cool concept for a movie and well executed.
4434;I'm so sad that there's such apathy and ignorance directed at this absolutely gorgeous cinematic gem.
4435;even though I do think he's a damn good actor and I've always loved him and most of his movies.
4436;two soulmates found each other in a strange sea of people they cannot relate to whether it's the people of Tokyo, their spouses, or their life, they found something magical in each other.
4437;If you've ever encountered someone special in your life, you'll most likely relate to the bond you feel with someone in the face of adversity or loneliness.
4438;I enjoy those types of movies too, but this movie is about relating to each other, intimacy (real intimacy, not sex), and some damn funny humor thanks to aforementioned Bill.
4439;Thank you Sophia Coppola, Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and the whole crew (and Japan!)
4440;Well I will give it four stars if the scale is 1.100.
4441;YES there are opportunities for more character depth and a great story, but it would take 116 years to do so.
4442;The performances are so finely nuanced that they no longer seem like Acting as the movie barely seems to be Directed
4443;winning director whose amalgam of sound and fury signify, ultimately, nothing.
4444;I must add, four years later, that this film is best seen in the theater.
4445;This is Hollywood promotional fraud at its finest.
4446;The depiction of japanese society was interesting and the film maker did a good job conveying aloneness and alienation.
4447;Underneath all the marveling at the differences that they (and we) do, Coppola is subverting the Hollywood love story.
4448;A fine film, worthy of the attention it has attracted.
4449;wise, works of art can still trigger a powerful emotional response.
4450;:)Sorry, if you want cinematography see the classic Days of Heaven.
4451;This movie arrived on time and in good condition.
4452;It is a wonderful work and special to anyone who has been lucky enough to have been to Japan.
4453;Both Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson were good, especially when you consider what they were given to work with.
4454;Second, the movie eventually ended, and that may be its strongest point.
4455;bob (Bill Murray) is a once famous American actor who is still popular in Japan.
4456;The characters are thus weakened and so is the power of the relationship.
4457;For example, take the scene I mentioned above.
4458;A peek into the twisted morality of Sophia Coppola.
4459;Everything in LIT points to Bob and Charlotte's relationship being a beautiful, misunderstood thing.
4460;But let's really look at it.
4461;There is nothing sweet and beautiful about this film .
4462;this movie started out funny enough.
4463;(all of a sudden this actress is a star ! )
4464;isnt it all really a freudian thing about this spoiled brat rich girl daughter of a great director seeking his approval and attention w bill murray as papas stand in ???
4465;its kinda nicely filmed .
4466;THere are a lot of things going for this film.
4467;a true delight to anyone who knows Japan .
4468;Coppola gets Japan, or at least Tokyo, in what I found to be a unique yet tasteful way.
4469;THe chemistry between Murray and Johansson is also extremely believable: two strangers in their own life crises meet in a hotel and strike up a sudden intimacy, feeling like soulmates is their splendidly luxurious isolation and cultural alienation.
4470;Finally, the acting is positively excellent, particularly Johansson, who comes off as something of a dowdy intellectual, confronted by a stalled marriage and broken identity.
4471;But Murray is great, too, as a film star whose life is moving too fast as his wife pulls away from him while controlling the nest of kids at home.
4472;i would recommend the film as funny and smart, but it is only an excellent comedy and not by any means a bildungsroman or psychological realism, as I had been led to expect from the reviews here.
4473;After a string of wonderful box office films in the eighties and very early nineties, Murray had settled into playing largely supporting parts in a variety of smaller films, with Wes Anderson's RUSHMORE a major exception.
4474;This film, however, is a return to leading man status for Murray, and he makes the most of a great part.
4475;They spend the rest of their time together in Tokyo together (Charlotte's husband is out on an extended shoot), and they each discover in the other someone they enjoy, can confide in, and trust.
4476;The beauty of the film is that we don't know.
4477;But we do get to witness two people, one famous and one unknown, one middle.
4478;sofia Coppola has quickly established herself as a first rate director.
4479;Luckily, having a father who owns his own studio should guarantee that she is able to continue making films.
4480;Luckily, her talent as a director keeps this from being sheer nepotism.
4481;I liked THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, but her success with LOST IN TRANSLATION shows that that film wasn't a fluke.
4482;this is the best film featuring Tokyo that I have ever seen made by a non.
4483;There is, of course, a wealth of great Japanese films featuring Tokyo, but these are all insider films, viewing Tokyo as they know it.
4484;It is, for them, home.
4485;the film has one of the best, most satisfying, and completely ambiguous endings I have ever seen in any film.
4486;The beautiful thing is that no one knows how it ends.
4487;as far as the future goes for Bill Murray, he already is committed to do the voice for feline Garfield in the movie of the same name (as unwilling as I will be to see that one, it will probably be a big success at the box office) and will star in Wes Anderson's next film.
4488;She later appeared in Godfather Part III, a last minute and miscast substitute, reputedly for Winona Ryder.
4489;with regard to Lost in Translation, she wrote the screenplay as well as directed it, evoking brilliant performances from Bill Murray (as Bob Harris) and Scarlett Johansson (as Charlotte).
4490;It is also so important, moreover, to know who you aren't.
4491;Will they proceed together?Here are two of several reasons why I admire this film so much.
4492;First, thanks to Coppola and her superb cast, it has exceptional charm.
4493;Although there are highly amusing (sometimes zany) moments along the way, to be sure, Coppola develops the characters of Bob and Charlotte with respect and affection but never with condescension.
4494;The second reason is that this film has great natural energy which Coppola juxtaposes with moments of intimacy, tenderness, reflection, and even poignancy.
4495;given what she achieves in this film, I am eager to see how Coppola's career develops in years to come.
4496;He must be a very proud father.
4497;Bill and Scarlett bring the best out in each other with these quirky characters.
4498;The supporting cast adds a tremendous depth without overshadowing the strong performances of the headliners.
4499;after all, in a world where every male and female television leading character inevitably has sex with each other by the third season, this film is something new.
4500;what do you call a profoundly intimate relationship between a man and woman, where both are married to other people, and they never have sex with each other?
4501;A flirtation?It's something wonderfully more, and to label it any of these things is to lose something in the translation.
4502;bill Murray plays a self aware actor in decline and Johannson plays a brilliant young woman who is both confident and unsure.
4503;the performances are amazing and unflinching and the directing and writing are so incredible that Sofia Coppola truly lives up to her family's reputation as yet another masterful story teller.
4504;Focus films may be known for distributing films that are outside the formulaic holiwood system, but they're not so great on packing the disc with extras that most people want from a movie that's on the academy awards top honor list (Best Actor, Actress, Director, Screenplay (original), and Film).
4505;Overall: a well done sophomore attempt.
4506;In my opinion, that's equally as interesting.
4507;Word to the wise, Ms. Coppola: please don't go the route of Mr. Spielberg, give us our commentary.
4508;But at least it's quaint.
4509;then there's the last worthwhile extra, the Interview Murray and Coppola .
4510;The movie, love it or hate it, is the kind of filmmaking that rarely sees the light of day in this popcorn thriller producer driven cinema world we see today.
4511;Maybe if it wins some awards we'll see a second release with a commentary track or two.
4512;I realise some people loved this, but it didn't do it for me.
4513;This film is a masterpiece.
4514;The soundtrack works flawlessly with the beautiful and sometimes haunting images that float through this film's landscape.
4515;Have a glass or two of your favorite red, turn out the lights, and let this epic of jejune avoidance carry you away.
4516;famous action movie star from the 1970's who is in the city to appear in a commercial for a Japanese whiskey.
4517;Staying at the same luxury hotel, Bob and Charlotte eventually cross paths and find themselves irresistibly drawn to one another.
4518;As Charlotte, Scarlett Johansson provides a poignant portrait of a woman who has so much to offer if only someone would be open enough to accept it.
4519;It is a heartrending tale about what happens when we not only marry the wrong person but end up meeting our soul mate when it is obviously too late to do anything about it.
4520;As a director, she often lingers for long periods of time over seemingly irrelevant details of daily life, creating a lyrical, poetic mood that enhances the melancholic tale she is telling.
4521;But anyone who can appreciate a subtle, beautifully acted and exquisitely directed character study should find many subsurface rewards in this film.
4522;This is a wondrous and deeply moving film.
4523;The characters stay with you forever, as the best movie characters do.
4524;It's a movie to think and wonder about for a long time after viewing.
4525;I have seen it many times and it's about time to watch it again.
4526;beautifully cast, acted, and directed.
4527;The ending is unforgettable from the moment Bill Murray's character decides to jump out of the cab.
4528;It tugs at your heart.
4529;i agree with one of the reviewers.
4530;Outstanding film in every way.
4531;Well acted, and directed as well as a nice view of Tokyo life.
4532;Excellent ending for a well done production.
4533;Scarlett Johhanson's character was excellent.
4534;This is one of my favorite flicks.
4535;The more I watched it, the more I liked it.
4536;I would rather watch a root canal performed on a baby, and I love kids.
4537;'Wow' is all I can say .
4538;this is just a wonderfully simple movie about the idea that some of the most touching moments in your life may be some of the briefest.
4539;coppola also does a terrific job of conveying that disconnected feeling that you can get when you travel to another country.
4540;What really impresses me though is that she managed to convey all of these themes without beating the audience (i. e. .
4541;this is an intelligent movie that really is a must.
4542;It's every bit as good as it was hyped up to be.
4543;It doesn't move quickly, but it is full of depth and that shines through with every viewing.
4544;With vivid often surrealistic imagery and sharp witty dialog the film manages to entertain you while telling the real story.
4545;What kind of love do our protagonists feel?
4546;that part of the story gives their love purity and validity.
4547;They love each other in a very real way, but they can't express it.
4548;It is that unrequited love that makes it so beautiful.
4549;most of the time unrequited love is one way.
4550;This love is a far more tragic love.
4551;A love that stays in one place, one moment.
4552;Just you and that moment trapped in happiness.
4553;and as for Scarlett Johansson,the only thing that can be said about her ,is that she looks good in her underwear,little else.
4554;And also for cutie Anna Faris for adding a few funny moments.
4555;this film is no way a masterpiece.
4556;For people who like character studies with more than a touch of real.
4557;The movie reflects the latter, and I found it interesting as an older/younger relationship based on two bored people looking for that companionship.
4558;I thought it well done, and just realistic enough to enjoy.
4559;Good movie for a relaxing evening, even with a girlfriend (it's not threatening) or casual date.
4560;Some nice scenery in Japan, and points up Tokyo's horrendous urban jungle.
4561;I recommend it for those who aren't looking for slam.
4562;bang action or new sexual thrills, that just want to see how men and women can enjoy each other as people.
4563;Being able to look at her face helped me stay awake through this one!
4564;She is also a fine actress.
4565;She hears this other woman.
4566;She hangs up on me without saying I love you I try to say it, but she hangs up before I can.
4567;the last day I tell the young girl I have to go home.
4568;bye because we are in a hotel lobby with many people around.
4569;I Whisper something inaudible into her ear.
4570;s. I tossed in a little nudity, some great shots of downtown Chicago and the lakefront.
4571;And I included some cool camera work.
4572;hill but presumably very rich actor.
4573;For such a young star she is able to convey her inner self with the slightest blank look.
4574;I predict a long and very successful career.
4575;Does she ever get happy?
4576;And that's what makes the film worth the trip.
4577;This is an interesting pitstop in the career of Bill Murray.
4578;Pretty funny, but his melancholy is really restraining the comedy.
4579;Which is fine because this film is very somber and simple.
4580;At this point in his career, its obvious Bill wants to express his dramatic side and hide his unique and wonderful flair for ocmedy.
4581;He radiates dryness, loneliness and discontent in all the right moments.
4582;And later pulls out the charm and irreverant irony.
4583;Bill deserved an Oscar for this great performance which is romantic, funny and never over.
4584;this film is a great companion to Bill's films by director Wes Anderson.
4585;wise, its just a Hollywood film given the indie treatment.
4586;Its set in an exotic locale.
4587;The dialogue is quiet and sparse.
4588;The soundtrack is angsty and ironic.
4589;And the humor is pretty much mild slapstick given artsy cinematography.
4590;But the subject matter of outsiders and bonding with other loners, is perfect for the arthouse crowd.
4591;Its a nice dynamic: their alienation in the colorful Japanese culture and living with the miserable lives they've chosen.
4592;directed films are okay films on their own.
4593;But Bill lifts them up into great vehicles for his talents.
4594;What a great Bill Murray's performance.
4595;I was looking forward to seeing it after reading so much good things about it.
4596;and Coppola won an Oscar for screenplay?!
4597;and i have to say wow, it sure is a peice of something.
4598;Bill Murray was good playing Bill Murray.
4599;I was so happy he did not win the Oscar.
4600;I respect Bill Murray for Caddyshack, Groundhog's Day, and Rushmore, but this movie did not do it for me.
4601;I don't share the conventional wisdom that this is some kind of masterpiece, but it's a good film.
4602;It's slow in spots but Bill Murray is inspired and Scarlett Johansson is touching, and the last 30 minutes are genuinely poignant.
4603;People saw the name Coppola on this film and got nostalgic for a time when movies still mattered to grown.
4604;But's it's definitely in the same honorable tradition.
4605;While entertainment is certainly valuable, at times I feel we should approach films, and certainly this film, without the expectation of being entertained, but with emptied expectations, thus allowing the film, its characters, and its story to move you.
4606;for the engaging subtleties and talent aforementioned, this is truly the only film that I can watch again and again and still notice new elements in the plot and relationships that revitalize the film and highlight how well each aspect flows together like words in a poem.
4607;Lost In Translation is the best film of 2003 without a doubt.
4608;It is the most original film in years, and Sofia Coppola directs and writes with a perfect artistry.
4609;driven film, but it is a character and dialogue driven film.
4610;Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, a has.
4611;That is, until he meets Charlotte (played by the incredible 18 year.
4612;Charlotte and Bob each wander the streets of Tokyo, and the making of the whiskey commercial is hilarious.
4613;The film is perfect without it.
4614;everything about this film is just so wonderful.
4615;Coppola has proven herself to be one of the strongest female women in the directing and writing industry of film.
4616;Her last film, The Virgin Suicides, was also a great film, but this one is even better.
4617;Sofia has more control and confidence in her work now.
4618;The dialogue is witty, as are the performances.
4619;Johansson has come out of the dark and will certainly be one of the best actresses in the future.
4620;She is already one of the best actresses of this generation, and her performance in this film is literally flawless.
4621;the production of this film is interesting and appealing.
4622;The look is fantastic, and the cinematography gets the audience right into what is going on in the character's heads.
4623;The music is very 80s.
4624;like and sets a perfect setting for the film.
4625;It completely deserved the Oscar for best picture of the year.
4626;Lost is totally perfect, and the best film of the year.
4627;I found to be really enjoyable, thought provoking, and well acted.
4628;Bill Murray pulls out one of his best performances in years, although he hasn't necessarily fallen off.
4629;i encourage you to see this movie.
4630;It's what great filmmaking is all about.
4631;Hearing great reviews from the film I checked it out at my local video store and when I watched it I was totally amazed at how simple it was.
4632;The film may be slow but the depth that you receive from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson's characters is a wonderful thing to see on screen.
4633;It displays the city of Tokeo as a vibrant place that never sleeps.
4634;I reccomend this film for anyone who loves to see great acting.
4635;The movie I give four stars.
4636;A pleasant movie to watch.
4637;It is very sweet to watch the two together who have this weird chemistry on screen.
4638;All in all the film was wonderful and I would put it in among the years best films.
4639;See this movie for a relaxing film.
4640;Its certainly not about understanding other cultures and showing respect for them.
4641;That would be a very interesting movie.
4642;I recommend that you stay clear of this movie and get something with substance.
4643;My husband and I loved this movie.
4644;He watched it first and even though he is not one to rewatch movies (with rare exceptions), he thought I might like this and we watched it together and loved it.
4645;There are many things I loved, but what struck us both was how REAL and genuine the moments are.
4646;It is a subtle movie.
4647;and totally identify with them and recognize familiar moments makes this movie special.
4648;This movie made me want to visit Japan and is one I will revisit again and again.
4649;But you cannot deny that it is a rare film that polarizes its audience to such extremes.
4650;Great classic films are often called trash and a masterpiece with equal fervor.
4651;shockingly, the friends of mine whom I thought would hate the film absolutely loved it.
4652;That is surprising for me.
4653;She not only has the sensibility of her father when it comes to direction and vision but she has borrowed a page from her heritage and made a film that reminds one of the great Italian Neorealist era in cinema from the forties to the late sixties
4654;Playing off the hunger for real people from the audience, real performances, real places and situations
4655;the end scene with the whisper is a perfect example.
4656;Because we feel involved, we feel invested and the whisper takes that involvement and holds a mirror t it.
4657;But it does so in a way that reveals some things about our own nature as people.
4658;a successful older man and a married.
4659;Both are at odds with the culture there, but find eachother and spark up a very interesting friendship.
4660;They find a common ground on their cynicism and have a wonderful time together.
4661;This is definitely an intellectual film if you want to call it that because it plays on how your philosophy and perception.
4662;As a fading movie star, Bob Harris, he's never been better, and he's just about perfect: A wise, attractive, cynical presence with enough vigor and hope to recognize a much younger kindred spirit when he sees one.
4663;including a bizarre Japanese prostitute and the sublime, hilarious commercial shoot .
4664;She has an ear for honest dialogue, and an eye for well.
4665;But the shy, intelligent performance grounds the picture, and provides Murray the stage to at long last unfurl some Cary Grant charm.
4666;the supporting cast, which includes Giovanni Ribisi as the geek.
4667;And Tokyo itself is a character, with its bright lights rivaling Vegas.
4668;Paired with a warm, near.
4669;Bob's golf outing near Mt. Fuji is the standout .
4670;A club scene is pretty flat, but Coppola redeems it with a funny karaoke sequence inside a high.
4671;it's Bob who blinks, not surprisingly, but Lost In Translation ends with a powerful reconciliation that cements their connection.
4672;The movie's extended, final goodbye in a Tokyo market is shamelessly romantic, yet one of the great scenes in recent memory.
4673;Coppola the daughter is firmly out of her father Francis Ford's shadow with this movie, a darkhorse contender come awards season.
4674;good thing it has the name Sophia's dad left her with.
4675;Of course it's hard to understand why this movie is critically acclaimed and celebrated to those who are used to more commercial or semi.
4676;What makes this film so charming and fascinating is the natural simplistic style of direction and smooth narration.
4677;I found it incredibly moving and truly innovative.
4678;You realise just how big the world really is.
4679;I feel that this film really captured the feeling of being lost in the midst of something big and having to find your way through.
4680;It's simply beautiful and unlike anything else I've ever seen.
4681;The only thing that is remotely related to Japan is when they shamelessly make fun of Japanese people and the cultural differences.
4682;Mostly it is just random scenes put together, added by a couple of funny scenes of making fun of Japanese people.
4683;The scenes moved on extremely slowly.
4684;bill murray is excellent as bob and scarlett johansson makes a good charlotte.
4685;the film has some very funny parts, and is very enjoyable.
4686;My sister and I saw Lost in Translation this weekend, in a packed theatre.
4687;Its just a very real piece of life, which is sometimes hard, and often exhausting.
4688;And our paths cross, and it changes our lives a little bit.
4689;I thought both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannsen were well cast, and they didn't over play it a bit.
4690;It just touched something in me.
4691;I hope you enjoy it.
4692;These two characters come across each other one day and they manage to click.
4693;Lost in Translation, directed by Sofia Coppola, is an interesting movie.
4694;What makes the movie so special?
4695;This is one of those movies that you have to have the right frame of mind to enjoy.
4696;This is a subtle movie about two lonely people in a foreign land trying to figure out what to do next in life.
4697;The contrast between the two characters, played by Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, provides an interesting story.
4698;This is a movie about friendship and making the most out of a tough situation.
4699;It reminds me a bit of The Big Chill but without the ensemble cast.
4700;If you don't expect a roaring comedy, or to be blown away because of its Oscar nominations, then I think you will enjoy this movie.
4701;It is both heartwarming and original, which is hard to come by these days.
4702;Before meeting, both Bob and Scarlett are alienated in the foreign Japanese culture but after befriending each other they create a unique friendship based on their circumstances that enable them to survive their stay in Tokyo.
4703;in this film Bill Murray proves once again that he has the ability to be a brilliant actor.
4704;While he is funny, he never allows his comedy to take over the scene.
4705;Scarlett Johansson also does a fine job in portraying her character and is a convincing actress.
4706;the bright neon lights of Tokyo come alive in MATCHSTICK MEN.
4707;And so does this marvelous tale of human connection between these two individuals.
4708;Surely this is one of the best films of 2003.
4709;I have had several favorite movies, but this one takes the cake!
4710;Entire movie based in Japan with stunning real footage of the lights in the city to make you want to jump into your t. v.!
4711;The basic element and entire point of the movie is simple: Not going beyond a perfect friendship can leave a memory to last a lifetime.
4712;A great price to pay for a movie to watch over and over.
4713;Super great soundtrack, great footage.
4714;screen does not matter, they are both breathtaking.
4715;Perfect for a date, alone, family.
4716;Tokyo is a perfect choice for this movie because it is so crowded but also has a language/culture barrier for the main characters.
4717;I found both of these things to be realistic, and I could relate to how the main characters were thus trapped in the hotel.
4718;Walk in, sit down, order your food, and wait.
4719;If so, you would be happy to finally find someone to talk to, and you would both love this movie.
4720;Many of these reviews are spot.
4721;It woke me, the audience, from the dream I was in .
4722;That can be entertaining, and it can mean a lot to you personally.
4723;Take a good camera and cinematographer anywhere in Tokyo, and you're bound to get some striking imagery.
4724;It's a beautiful, clean, lively place.
4725;Director Sophia Coppola has created a bourgeois tale about lonely superstars, millionaires and dilletantes in Japan that seethes with poor.
4726;It doesn't mean you should follow every permutation that life beholds, but it makes it refreshing to know such possibilities exist.
4727;i loved this movie so much, and it means so very much to me now, years later.
4728;I can only thank Sofia for making it, and Scarlett and Bill for being so perfect.
4729;this movie is a masterpiece that I hold near my heart.
4730;Both of them did a wonderful job and Sofia Copola was wise in keeping their relationship more plutonic than sexual (even though you can feel their attraction for one another).
4731;Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is, for lack of a better word, a masterpiece.
4732;Grounded by two wonderfully restrained performances by two talented actors as well as a pitch.
4733;perfect supporting cast, this movie tells a melancholy, intelligent romantic tale of two lost Americans who find redemption in each other.
4734;lit metropolis reportedly provided some of the inspiration for this movie, and the movie definitely satisfies that backstory.
4735;A very quiet film, many of its most important moments transpire when a single character silently tries to absorb this fantastic place, and simply comes up short.
4736;bill Murray plays Bob Harris, an actor's whose cinematic successes and his ambition are behind him, in town to shoot a booze commercial for $2 million.
4737;famous comedies like Caddyshack and Stripes, but he was born to play Bob.
4738;charlotte (Scarlett Johannson, in another shockingly good performance) is in many respects Bob's alter ego.
4739;John, eager to make it in the entertainment biz, quickly abandons Charlotte, and she is cast adrift in the enormity of Tokyo.
4740;year old Yale graduate, she is intelligent enough to know that she should be doing more but is perhaps too young to know what her life's ambition should be.
4741;Bob is attracted to Charlotte's beauty and innocent wit, while Charlotte is drawn to this man of charm and obvious experience.
4742;Soon they are exploring both Tokyo and each other, both through their conversations and their mutual ability to inspire the good things in each other.
4743;eventually, the movie builds to its much.
4744;This entirely unexpected ending is one of the most romantic and hopeful moments you will ever see on screen.
4745;ups that spend more effort on their stunts than their dialogue, this movie is a perfect antidote.
4746;While it's doubtful that Lost in Translation will create a tourist boom for Tokyo, the movie is also made with an obvious affection for the big Japanese city, and that in its own way is touching as well.
4747;Unlike what many reviewers are saying, this could be a movie that anyone can enjoy.
4748;The story is minimal
4749;Watch it alone if necessary.
4750;Give this movie a chance, and you will be rewarded.
4751;That final encounter is one of the greatest moments in recent film.
4752;Good effort by everyone .
4753;She is in Japan with her husband who is a photographer.
4754;in many ways, these two characters compliment each other and provide for each other with the necessary vision to realize that they can make changes to their lives and perhaps realize that there is still something good and wonderful to live for.
4755;Bob helps Charlotte to see the possibilities ahead of her, while Charlotte helps Bob to appreciate the life he has, even though he now knows that he needs a new focus.
4756;She has tried writing and photography without any kind of feeling of accomplishment.
4757;Part of this is self.
4758;imposed as he seems to constantly be dodging fans who interrupt him while he is trying to enjoy a quiet moment at the hotel bar.
4759;There is something to be said for two lost souls who find each other in Tokyo, Japan.
4760;Neither one, it seems, is particularly happy to be in Japan.
4761;He sees something genuine in Charlotte.
4762;Charlotte begins to see possibilities in Bob, and Bob begins to see new vision of life (one he's forgotten) in Charlotte.
4763;The irony of the relationship is in the friendship and how each is able to provide some level of healing to the other.
4764;It's obvious she is upset and a tad jealous.
4765;She wants someone to be with her.
4766;Charlotte has become a window to the possibility of a new life.
4767;And for Charlotte, Bob is a light to a path that was once dark.
4768;It isn't so much of a romantic love as it is a genuine, loving friendship, and when it is time for them to part, as much as it hurts, brings the realization that it is time for each to go their own way.
4769;sofia Coppola masterfully navigates the story without it becoming two mired down in melodrama.
4770;She keeps things simple and real, which is probably why so many viewers find themselves relating to the characters and the story.
4771;It could be anyone, and this is why it works so well.
4772;These types of ingredients can create a kind of bubble, which it does for Charlotte and Bob.
4773;While they do interact with other people, it is about them in a small world created by each of them.
4774;lost in Translation is one of my favorite films of the last decade, and the magic is in the story of two realistic characters who are trying to figure out their lives.
4775;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen play their roles perfectly, as if each truly knows and understands their characters.
4776;This production reminds me of the French cinema and the movies by the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, the action is slow and you get time to really look at the expressions of the characters and ponder what their thoughts are.
4777;Luckily, I can say that the hype was right!
4778;After getting acquainted in the bar of the hotel on a sleepless night, Bob and Charlotte begin a very interesting and complex friendship.
4779;The performances of both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are extraordinary and they deserve each and every one of the nominations and awards won.
4780;If you belong in this category it is better to stay away, if not.
4781;Sofia Coppola has truly hit her stride with this one.
4782;the characters are real, involving, and sympathetic.
4783;The acting is subtle and sidesplitting.
4784;The feeling of being temporarily displaced in an unfamiliar culture is spot on.
4785;The humor is intelligently understated (and hilarious).
4786;The soundtrack perfectly adds to the mood without distracting.
4787;taking pictures of your feet.
4788;The love story is believable and ultimately (and surprisingly) satisfying.
4789;There's even a car chase scene (after a fashion).
4790;Rather, it's a series of small, sweet, marvelous, intimate, and unforgettable moments that make the living/watching worth every second.
4791;I've watched this film many times, and it never ceases to impress me.
4792;Much has been said about the Western actors in this film, but I want to comment on the Japanese side where the actors also do a magnificent job.
4793;It amazed me the way the film immerses the viewer into the Tokyo scene so realistically, giving one the sense of cultural vertigo.
4794;The restrained romance between Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansen reflects the style of great Japanese literature.
4795;It is the classic cherry blossom theme, and the symbolism in the film is enough to establish that fact.
4796;Her artistic powers of observation and imagination are proved in this film.
4797;The genius of this film is that Coppola displays what is funny to both sides of the cultural gap.
4798;Coppola manages to bridge that gap with hilarious effect.
4799;she actually manages to do it in a Japanese way.
4800;While I don't pretend to be an expert, I do have a fair amount of experience with Japan, and for me the movie was a wonderfully nostalgic trip back to a land I enjoyed living and working in.
4801;One tiny 2nd floor bar, Sugar High, was a favorite among my friends and I. Is much of Japanese TV ridiculous and over the top?
4802;Being lonely never felt so cool.
4803;That is just what it is .
4804;a dizzying, beautiful, and.yes, cool depiction of being lonely in a big city.
4805;It understands the complexities of the human need for companionship, and that this need works on many more levels than a Hollywood clich .
4806;This relationship is what makes Lost in Translation so compelling.
4807;That need it is something that transcends romance, friendship, acquaintance, and every other box one could place human contact in.
4808;Sophia Coppola has captured these nuances and complexities to such a subtle and beautiful tee, that this is a film that stays with you and lingers for days .
4809;to top that off, Bill Murray offers his career's best performance.
4810;This is an amazing performance, given by a real pro.
4811;He is a funny man, a man who knows he has a natural comedic talent.
4812;This is an infinitely perceptive Murray and every minute he is on screen, he had my rapt attention.
4813;scarlette Johanason proved to be the only match for Murray minute by minute in this performance that shows that she is quite possibly the next great female lead of my generation.
4814;lost in Translation has amazing staying power and proves to be a real treat for anyone who gives it a chance.
4815;otherwise, maybe you should see something else.
4816;I liked it enough to make it worthwhile, though.
4817;Since young I always had relationships with guys and it was refreshing to see the poignant touch Bill M. put to the part.
4818;She felt Bill M's Character needed some emotional company and gave it to him, not lending physical love but emotional love instead.
4819;Thank goodness director Sophia understands that.
4820;I recommend this movie to any young adult and older adult who want to relate but have the wall between them not allowing them to.
4821;bill Murray is the best thing about the movie.
4822;He brings to the part some wonderfully wry humor and a true tiredness of heart.
4823;He really engages the viewer.
4824;What I also liked about the movie is that it doesn't fall into the cliche of having the older man embark on a torrid love affair with the much.younger woman
4825;One of the best moments in the movie is at the end, with something whispered from one character to the other that we can only guess at.
4826;She hits the same note over and over again .
4827;To her credit, she does the most with what the screenplay gives her, but you're always wanting something more from her character.
4828;Just as you want something more from the movie.
4829;It's interesting to watch the relationship develop, but you always sense that the movie could have done a little more with the characters or given us something more to think about and feel for.
4830;I know the film is supposed to be more atmospheric, but unlike truly wonderful atmospheric films, there's something about this one that keeps us at a distance, that makes us wonder why we are where we are, and why it is even important for us to watch the characters do what they do.
4831;It's also enlightening and even more fun to watch films where two people trapped in their own private miseries bond in a foreign country for a week long odysessy of late night chats at bars, karaoke parties, and strip joints.
4832;Their connection is so endearing niether of them can explain it and they never dwell on the mechanics of it and Coppola never throws in a cheap Lolita.
4833;This movie has an odd pace and a unique feel, it really works because Murray and Johansson are so appealing.
4834;The Tokyo local is extremely interesting and since it is so unusual for a film to be shot on location in Japan it gives the movie a truly unique feel.
4835;The ending is unusual, but it goes along with this unique film, I like the ending, it's a private moment between them and it's touching.
4836;profound and subtle affection between two ppl in a foreign country.
4837;It's a feeling one can only sense in the isolated situation, faraway from lovers, family, and friends.
4838;And that is probably more true of the Academy Awards than any other.
4839;you've seen the best of the movie in that time.
4840;Such craftsmanship places demands on the viewer, just like a well written story places demands on a reader.
4841;Bittersweet is very hard to do, but this film pulls if off, right down to the last scene (the whisper was a perfect, hopeful, human touch.)
4842;The intelligent dialogue between these two, the framing of scenes, the photography, all are excellent.
4843;Easily a five star movie for the discerning viewer.
4844;Coen brothers' The Man Who Wasn't There was another.
4845;I still have to see a more accurate rendition of Tokyo's true day.
4846;day existence than this movie, apart from Tom Selleck's Baseball a few years back.
4847;Yes, real translators shorten a good deal of Japanese when interpreting as long as the message is communicated.
4848;Most of my Japanese friends would simply laugh along when told of such common trivia.
4849;This movie is as much a caricature of Japanese culture as Patton or Sex and the City are of American culture.
4850;sold as being a movie about Japan, the cultural takes are comic garnish, not elemental to the romantic plot.
4851;I found the flow of the movie very pleasing, but then I am guilty of enjoying the likes of About Schmidt as well.
4852;It's a simple, beautiful, efficient story that is completely and utterly engrossing, with economy of cinematography.
4853;embelishing, and still be looked at as a remarkable and moving artform?
4854;There is a lot in the movie that perhaps may not hit a nerve with people who expect to be hit on the head with meaning.
4855;It is the kind of tender, non.
4856;I found Bill Murray to be extremely hilarious in this movie, and while this may sound arrogant, he is funny in a mature sort of a way.
4857;In fact, one thing that hits you about Coppola's direction is the honesty in the story telling.
4858;The chemistry between the two lead characters in Lost in Translation is very moving, I'd even say it is one of the most wistful, effortless and understanding romances I have seen in a long time in film, the variety only the ilk of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thomson could evoke in an Merchant Ivory production.
4859;The very fact that these two characters find themselves groping in the middle of an alien culture brings them together and brings to the surface their similarities .
4860;I could sit here for an hour and enlist stunning movies that did not pander to an audience that necessarily needs a plot.
4861;Let's talk of the film on its merit, leaving all the heritage behind.
4862;I didn't care much about The Virgin Suicides, but I have now come to admire Sophia's talents at synthesizing visual, spatial, and sonic impressions.
4863;Oodles for film students to learn from!I adore this glorious masterpiece, and highly recommend it .
4864;His wife is back home in sunny California with their kids, treating her life as a housewife more as a career that's going nowhere rather than a relationship.
4865;He is surrounded by English.
4866;bob Charlotte instantly connect .
4867;truly strangers in a strange land.
4868;I've got to go now!
4869;Bob and Charlotte never have to explain their lonliness to one another, they experience it and know it when they see it.
4870;in many ways, despite their backgrounds and age difference, they are soul mates.
4871;sexual touch of friendship couples have when they have been together many years and are very close.
4872;The angst between them is the most binding force they have.
4873;interwoven with the stark scenes of lonliness and human apathy are hilarious cross.
4874;this is a great film, but not one to see when you're sleepy or depressed.
4875;Coppola and Murray have definitely earned their Oscar nominations.
4876;People who must have car chases, love scenes, or dramatic arguments will not enjoy this film.
4877;It explores the nuances of everyday, frustrated people and how friendship and humanity intertwine.
4878;Beckett and Seinfeld fans may enjoy it.
4879;I have always been a Bill Murray fan.
4880;He's made many funny movies, many classics.
4881;Sofia Coppola's directorial venture which made her win an Oscar(2004) for Original Screenplay is a beautiful movie where Bob Harris (Bill Murray) an american actor going thru mid.
4882;Both of them going thru the same spell of loneliness helplessness find comfort in each other's company that develops in an unlikely bond.
4883;two Americans stint with tokyo lifestyle is very amusing to watch.
4884;everything in the movie is handled so elegantly and tenderly!If this one is 'to be found' in your collection, it would be as apt as its tag line 'Everyone wants to be found'.
4885;Excellent performances by Scarlett Johannson and Bill Murray.
4886;If you appreciate good film making and independent movies, you will really like this one.
4887;The music by Kevin Shields was nice and so was Tokyo.
4888;Somehow i got the impression that the Coppola wanted to achieve those moods and.
4889;In fact I love thinking films and don't need extreme plot twists to keep me engaged.
4890;Are the Japanese portrayed in a realistic fashion at all?
4891;ones, submissive women eager to please any man of power and faceless shills.
4892;As they form a bond, Charlotte and Harris certainly are touching, most definitely because.
4893;As a mainstream film this must be a rare example of its type.
4894;If you have been abroad on business as I have, you will recognise many of the scenes.
4895;These and many more will be familiar to all the suits that travel by plane every day.
4896;Having said that, it was great while it lasted.
4897;I thought we had moved on from the portrayal of foreigners as funny because they speak English with an accent and I found the scene with the woman in Murray's room all but incomprehensible (was it meant to be funny??)
4898;Yes it was boring in that almost nothing happens but that can be the making of some films set in boring provincial places, but, and here is the point, the film is set in one of the most lively fascinating and down right crazy places on earth.
4899;Mr Baseball was more sympathetic to its' subject matter than this film.
4900;by the way I have stayed at the Park Hyatt hotel in Tokyo and it is fantastic, also, ironically, it has the best American restaurant in Tokyo, just next to the bar which features so heavily in the movie.
4901;I'd rather count all the stars in the sky then see this movie again.
4902;it seems as if Sofia Coppola ever wants to win another oscar all she has to do is film clothing in the dryer, because this movie is that exciting.
4903;those that have spent any amount of time in asia (like i did) will definitely relate to this movie.
4904;Understated acting makes this brilliantly.
4905;And, yes, you DO keep waiting to see if their relationship gets sexual.
4906;then you feel a cool breeze, much like the cool air from the lake when you finally get out of your office in an autumn night.
4907;Suddenly, all your senses come alive, stars shine brightly, the street light is vivid, and you have a sense of euphoria.
4908;this is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.
4909;Lonely people will understand it better because they identify with the characters, and they secretly dream about such a magical encounter in their lifetime.
4910;This movie is so good!
4911;I loved every minute of it!
4912;If Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson don't get Golden Globes or Oscars for their roles, I will be very upset because both of them deserve it, they are amazing in this movie!
4913;This movie is so good.
4914;She's always byherself and wondering when he'll return, wherever it is he is working.
4915;After a while Bob and Charlotte become friends and have deep conversations about life.
4916;The two have great chemsitry on screen.
4917;Murray is excellent is this, unexpected,dramatic role.
4918;This film proves you don't have to spend millions of millions of dollars on speical effects to be a great film.
4919;Hopefully Murray will impress us with another dramatic role soon!
4920;It'll leave you misty at the end.
4921;And the end is absolutely wonderful.
4922;All I'll say is that Sophia Coppola lets you make up your own mind what happens.
4923;Something so delicious in this age of spoon.
4924;Charlotte, in her early twenties has been married for two to three years and has a feeling that the passion is gone from her life.
4925;Bob, well into his fifties I assume, knows the passion is gone from his life but is just thankful that the whiskey works.
4926;the cinematography and Tokyo scenes are truly amazing, in a way that brings out the beauty of the city without looking like a tourist film or being clich d.
4927;Ms. Coppola's use of beautifully organic country.
4928;sides and ancient Buddhist temples mix perfectly with the neon.
4929;The story entertains the audience without playing to the uneducated
4930;The relationship played out between Harris and Charlotte is never seedy or even romantically physical, but the end result is one that will help make their relationship stand along the line of Ingrid and Bogart.
4931;modern gem of a story.
4932;The simplicity of this film let the characters shine.
4933;Bill Murray astounded me and he very much deserves the Oscar for this role.
4934;i love the fact that this movie is about the real, gritty and a lot of the times banal moments of people's lives.
4935;If you watch this film with an open mind and dare I say heart it will leave you stinging.
4936;Not always in a huge guffaw manor but will make you crack a quite a few smiles.
4937;Just seeing Bill Murray sing More Than This by Roxy Music on karaoke is priceless.
4938;Everybody has that one story they never tell.
4939;a female lead who is, essentially, a blob.
4940;and then there's the [INAUDIBLE WHISPER] at the end, which proves once and for all that the inablilty to give a movie a satisfying ending is contagious (thanks a lot, Spike!)
4941;rated must be genetic (well, OK, Francis did make two great films.
4942;two stars for the cinematography and acting, which were great.
4943;I do not recommend this movie!
4944;Surprisingly enough you can love this movie, without being an indie film person.
4945;Yes, it's true that most people my age (15) believe that a movie is good ifa) someone/something explodesb) sexc) is a senseless romantic comedyAnyone who has ever felt lost or lonely can relate and enjoy this visually stunning movie.
4946;With Bill Murray in the lead he gives a truly Oscar worthy performance.
4947;Both are in a foreign city, exacerbating their feelings of isolation and really the question of
4948;The conclusion is excellent and makes that point.
4949;what makes the movie so beautiful is that they have this relationship, beyond friendship but never sexual.
4950;When they're lying in bed, talking about life, you get the feeling of profound trust and mutual love.
4951;Something that most of us would be lucky to experience in our lifetime.
4952;I found it to be no great shakes.
4953;What is it that makes a movie great?
4954;Should a movie be scaled on how much blood, boobs and Ka.
4955;girl with a beautiful personality.
4956;symbolism, especially in movies, is a double.
4957;LiT is considered a modern masterpeice when it comes to allegories, it has deep themes concerning alienination, culture shock and finding yourself, and all are vibrant throughout.
4958;The movie fills it's reel by showing a more serious Bill Murray and the ever so talented Scarlett Johansson exploring these themes so beautifully, meekly and passionatly that it does make you wonder how this could get any better.
4959;It's decently acted but the story is, well, an ass sandwich.
4960;The most incredible thing about this movie is that I actually watched the whole thing.
4961;, and then he goes home.
4962;Let's give it an award!?
4963;I agree with other reviewers who state that the beauty in this film derives from the smallest touch or glance between Charlotte and Bob rather than from an in.
4964;I tend to feel Bill Murray has rarely acted better than in this film and saying that, the same applies to Scarlett Johannsson, both play their roles superbly with just the right amount of humour and seriousness to lend it credibility.
4965;It is also infused with that sense of delicious melancholy you can sometimes feel, without making you feel sad or low.
4966;If you come to this film expecting a Hollywood all action blockbuster you will disappointed, but if you come to this expecting a unique and brief snapshot of two peoples lives as they spend time together learning about themselves and each other, then you should enjoy this to the full and see what all the hype is about.
4967;You'll either love it or hate it but I guess it's one to watch and make your own mind up about either way.
4968;A great movie is one that reaches out and grabs you.
4969;It reaches out and grabs you.
4970;The same is true with the Star Wars series.
4971;They reach out and grab you.
4972;This movie is NOT funny.
4973;It is NOT entertaining and it is NOT even interesting.
4974;He meets Charlotte who is 25 years old played by 18.
4975;As for Bill Murray`s all star performance, give me a break.
4976;It's an ironic moment for both characters.
4977;but it's worth a look .
4978;Underneath it all, it's a romantic comedy.
4979;If you watch it closely and get into the rhythm of it, you'll see a unique movie that takes the standard romantic comedy conventions and flips them upside down.
4980;And there are not many Japanese who speak otherwise decent English, but still confuse l and r sounds with such hilarity.
4981;heart sessions and i have never known any self.
4982;respecting philsophy graduate to listen to self.
4983;It baffles me why this movie has received such acclaim.
4984;The idea is genius, I think.
4985;But some movies I go see for the soul purpose of enjoying it.
4986;It happens to the best of movies that receive a lot of hype (The Matrix Reloaded comes to mind).
4987;Perhaps what really IS interesting about the movie is their age difference.
4988;It's a great film and Bill Murry gives one of the best performances ever.
4989;A good movie but it isn't really a comedy.
4990;Bill Murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy, who dosen't seem to quite know why he is where he is, and why he is treated the way he is .
4991;This is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola.
4992;This also sort of represents the zenith of Bill murray's career and perhaps his best performance to date.
4993;Lost in Translation is a great film starring Bill Murray who plays a successful actor named Bob.
4994;They explore the various clubs and hangouts in Tokyo with their friends.
4995;I do believe that this film had a strong story because it covers the universal themes of how essential it is to create a plan on where you want to go in life, and to creatively construct new plans if and/or when setbacks occur.
4996;I liked watching this film because it brought back some positive memories I had of when I was living in Japan (via the U. s. military) during the time period of September 2000 until October 2003.
4997;Sofia Coppola here takes the unusual step of combining the two through Bill Murray.
4998;Famed for his comedy roles, in this film his ability to convey subdued emotions resulting in a poignant story suffused with ironies.
4999;The shooting of the advert, a high point in the film, gives Murray full opportunity to express feelings.
5000;Coppola vividly sets the tone of this film .
5001;Johansson, clearly young enough to be Murray's daughter, captures his attention across the bar.
5002;Johansson is clearly dissatisfied with her situation.
5003;a wedding in a Buddhist temple is superbly portrayed.
5004;She is seeking something greater than what she has, but is Murray the answer?
5005;She's carefully restrained in her dealings with the urbane actor.
5006;The tension in this relationship builds superbly under Coppola's deft touch.
5007;ups and with Murray and Johansson, she's able to convey mood with deceptively minimal views.
5008;coppola provides an intensely human drama in this superbly photographed story.
5009;Her story [Coppola both wrote and directed this gem] is even more mould.
5010;Dialogue is minimised as Coppola uses Murray's expressiveness and Johansson's pensive beauty to define the story.
5011;let me start with the good news
5012;People who enjoyed this movie are the sames ones who enjoy watching paint dry.
5013;But that's what makes this movie so good.
5014;what makes this movie work is mainly because of how these two actors pull off such remarkable performances.
5015;and that's how the comedic aspect of this movie works effectively.
5016;it's this sense of human fragility that Coppola shows in the movie that makes it a hauntingly memorable piece.
5017;In a critical moment, she finally starts to realize certain aspects of her life, as she admits over the phone and to herself, I don't know who I married.
5018;all these bits and pieces, meanings and emotions, form a solid basis in which Coppola revolves her film around.
5019;The answers are simple:Sofia Coppola has made an incredible love movie for the new millenium that doesn't pander to very contemorary cliche, involve sex (well, almost) or deal with accepted romance standards.
5020;And what she made was something more fluid and romantic then anything I've seen for years in movies.
5021;It is a stunningly accurate, and obviously live, version of Tokyo.
5022;Being there twice, I can relate to the sounds, the people, the design, and anything in this great visual ode to one of the most amazing cities in the world.
5023;And more evidently, the story of miscommunication and alienation within a world in your face, yet emotionally beyond your reach is relayed brilliantly.
5024;this film will grow with the Japophile, and be a sweet romance to anyone unfamiliar with the idea of being segregated within a society they can't relate to.
5025;But, it will keep me thinking because of the sweet relations between the two lead characters as they find and lose the loves of their life within the confines of Tokyo.
5026;The concept is wonderful, the acting is as it should be, the chemistry is there, the setting is atmospheric .
5027;and director Sofia Coppola, like some kind of indie George Lucas, takes great material and just pulverizes it!!!
5028;I like the actors, and the idea of a platonic love developing between two displaced Americans was a wonderful concept to me!
5029;competent director can establish in about three or four shots that these characters are lonely and depressed!What I wanted more of was actual connecting dialogue, some hint of character development.
5030;Want a good indie night?
5031;Give this one a pass .
5032;There is nothing funny in this movie beyond some wry and ironic moments that, frankly, thrive only on racial ignorance of Japanese culture and their inabilities to pronounce L's and R's properly .
5033;yep, the humor is THAT sophisticated!!
5034;I can't tell you if you'll enjoy this movie, I know I loved it but thats just me.
5035;The type of person you are is going determine what kind of experience this movie is going to be for you (kind of like life).
5036;I'm sure you have a very successful life, a beautiful house, delightful children and a movie is nothing more than entertainment for two hours of your day, where you can unwind.
5037;Everybody might say they have, or got a taste of it but getting truly and profoundly lost, takes the right circumstance and a special kind of disposition to get there.
5038;They hide it the best they can.
5039;This is one reason why I think Scarlet Johansson is an amazing actress, she hits this quiet despair on the nose.
5040;It takes a special kind of actress to portray a woman acting in real life.
5041;layered complex emotional state is so hard to portray because most people aren't aware enough to detect this in real life let alone make it come alive on the screen.
5042;But you can see her distress in rare moments like her conversion on the phone back home, her meandering walks, her sleepless nights and most telling, her conversion with Bob on his bed.
5043;What couldn't be faked is the magical chemistry between Bob and Charlotte, and for a movie with no plot, that is everything.
5044;It is fascinating the love/hate opinion most have for this movie.
5045;It garners either five stars or one star and yet I find myself somewhere in the middle.
5046;The squeamishness and outrage we feel when we see these characters is purposeful.
5047;Lord knows I came across many such people in my years there and seeing this behavior in the characters made them very real to me.
5048;It changed so much of my understanding and appreciation of the film.
5049;The tenderness and humanity of the film could've been accomplished with a more realistic father.
5050;This is my favorite part because we see the crystallization of what these two mean to each other.
5051;It's a subtle and tender moment and there are enough of these moments in Lost in Translation for me to forgive some of the mistakes.
5052;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson give THE BEST performances of their careers in this wonderful masterpiece directed by Sofia Copolla (The Virgin Suicides).
5053;The woman is now one of my favorite directors, and this is one of my favorite films.
5054;They develop a very special, strong friendship during the course of the week in Tokyo.
5055;You feel as if you know these people, and when the end comes along, well, I saw this with one of my best friends, and at the end of the film I grabbed her by the arm and gave her a big hug.
5056;Definitly should win all the major awards this year at the Oscars.
5057;the mood of the movie is very consistent, some people might say depressing, I would say layed back and inspired by the ability of the actors, especially Bill Murray, to show emberassment, amusement and astonishment about themselves.
5058;my resum : a movie that leaves you with more hope than you had before.
5059;It shows that the human soul never ceases to be lonely, even when one is married with children.
5060;It never ceases seeking connections, other souls to travel this journey with.
5061;but if you are sensitive to body language, ambience, and subtle expressions, you'll love the volumes that Murray and Johansson speak without saying much .
5062;but between them, they understand each other perfectly even when they say nothing.
5063;The 1 is actually for the movie.
5064;i love Murray and it was really a pleasure to watch him in many of the scenes doing a lower key of humor.
5065;if this gets an academy award for anything it will be right up there with the one given to Kim Bassinger.
5066;My favorite movie to date.
5067;A very personal movie to me.
5068;Great music and you can't beat Bill Murrey.
5069;Instead, it triumphs by immersing the viewer in a sea of captivating sensation.
5070;Both Bob and Charlotte feel a sense of isolation in the foreign land but find comfort in each other's company.
5071;A strong bond develops between them as they try to place their lives in perspective.
5072;in Lost in Translation, Bill Murray follows in the footsteps of Robin Williams and proves that he is capable of so much more than straightforward comedy.
5073;His splendid and nuanced performance anchors the film and gives it its essence and soul.
5074;Similarly, Johansson further cements her claim as one of the more exciting young actresses working today by bringing to life a character possessed of an insight and wisdom far beyond that typical of women her age.
5075;Watching Bob and Charlotte come to terms with their lot in life is a wonderful and touching event to witness.
5076;She succeeds admirably in creating one of the more charming and mature cinematic gems of recent years.
5077;It reminded me a lot of Stanley Kubrick's films 2001 and The Shining .
5078;All three of these films are beautiful to look at, but they are otherwise empty in content.
5079;About an hour into this movie, I found a book to read.
5080;Nothing interesting or exciting happened during the whole movie.
5081;What I saw in this movie was a middle.
5082;This movie really made me miss the Bill Murray that I loved in Ghostbusters .
5083;The wit, fun, and cynicism that he showed in Ghostbusters was gone in Lost in Translation .
5084;good movie, that's worth seeing but with what i thought were odd problems .
5085;I liked this film very much.
5086;He is always wry and charming in a very distinct and memorable way.
5087;Her presence is very powerful and her eyes that burn holes through the screen.
5088;She has a poise and wisdom and beauty that will surely make her an enormous star.
5089;sophia Coppola was brave enough to make a movie.
5090;The restraint here allows the emotions to come to the surface, showing a maturity and depth that is very beautiful and which touches the spirit.
5091;the minimalist style of the work is sometimes overplayed but this is certainly a worthwhile film that will be greatly enjoyed by those in the target audience.
5092;I love Bill Murray and I thought the premise sounded interesting.
5093;That is the premise and it is a good one.
5094;The 3 stars represent NOT an average film but one that draws 2 types of equally powerful reaction.
5095;I happened to love it.
5096;the simple truth is you have to watch it.
5097;There are some gorgeous scenes in this film, as well as some gorgeous moments of intimacy.
5098;gotta be a good movie.
5099;One thing I require of a movie is it must be entertaining or stir emotion or stimulate reflection.
5100;Unlike what some people here have said, I have indeed traveled abroad, have found myself alone in a foreign country, and I don't live in middle America, I live in New York City and I see plenty of art house films.
5101;Charlotte's call to her friend at home was insightful, as well.
5102;if you want a sweet movie that features two characters coming together and forming a bond, watch Garden State.
5103;Like this one, it was beautifully shot and has good music, but unlike this film, you could actually see the characters developing.
5104;bill Murray is great in this, but he's still doing the same dry schitck he's been doing for 30 years.
5105;Scarlett Johansen was great, too.
5106;on the upside, this film did look gorgeous
5107;The music was good, as well.
5108;i've heard people say it changed their lives, it inspired them, it moved them in ways they had never been moved.
5109;dimensional, and the portrayal of the Japanese people in it comes dangerously close to racial stereotyping.
5110;Didn't like it the first time, maybe I'll watch it again and I'll like it.
5111;Sorry, Sofia, but you should give those awards back for this one.
5112;If I come out remembering moments, then its a success.
5113;It's all about moments and that's the core of Lost in Translation.
5114;Where as a great storyteller makes you feel like you were.
5115;That is Sophia Coppola's, aptly rewarded, success in her original screenplay and film.
5116;If you've ever tried to put down into writing a moment in your life that was so deeply, emotionally profound you'll understand why this film is a success.
5117;I bought this movie immediately after seeing it on cable, as I thought it was superb.
5118;I was pleasantly surprised that so many people did.
5119;the interesting thing about this movie is that it is so realistic, while at the same time being entirely unrealistic.
5120;Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) are very real, and their interactions are very witty and insightful, but everyone else is more surrealistic and part of the environment, rather than real people.
5121;In this case, they are wonderful because they are handled so honestly by the actors in the bizarre situation.
5122;There is a scene where a woman is translating Japanese to English, for example, and the Japanese version is much, much longer than what is said in English.
5123;It is totally absurd and unrealistic the difference is so great, but Bill Murray's handling of it is so perfect and honest, it works beautifully.
5124;Having someone you can relate to.
5125;It is a funny movie, but in a subtle way, and not everyone goes for that.
5126;It is done so well.
5127;I hope this is the cinema of the future .
5128;It puts you right there with the actors.
5129;The storytelling is heartfelt and the acting is superb.
5130;My wife and I love to rewatch this every year as it is one of her favorites too.
5131;perfect leaving the viewer to fill in their own specifics.
5132;This highly acclaimed film was eagerly anticipated by the sophmoric directorial debut of Sophia Copella.
5133;With Lost In Translation the sights and sounds of Tokyo, Japan, are incredible, along with a stunningly beautiful actress, Scarlett Johansen (Charlotte), and a quirky actor, Bill Murray (Bob).
5134;on overcoming incredible odds: With an impending Japanese typhoon, dealing with horrendous pedestrian/vehicular traffic, and the city's language barriers, they accomplished a great deal during the filming of the movie in spite of the extraordinary circumstances beyond their control.
5135;happenstance was abound in this film in which an older man and a young woman meet at the Park Hyatt Hotel, in a nice restaurant overlooking the city, surrounded by the incredible ambiance of friendly people, classical music, lights, lights, and more lights.
5136;I find a lot of intelligence and elegance, and (only) some snobbishness which I like (I mean it.)
5137;So I give this movie another star.
5138;Adding more to the mystery is that this thing even won awards.
5139;I found myself grinning a coupla times and basically that was it.
5140;there was also this other line of argument from people who said that this film is good because of the stark contrast it provides to most of the mindless Hollywood films out there.
5141;I loved Bill Murray in this movie and Scarlett Johansson was very good too.
5142;The attraction between the two was undeniable.
5143;The relationship between Murray and Scarjo is classic in the Hepburn/Tracy, Bogart/Bacall tradition.
5144;Murray is terrific, but is actually upstaged by the range and depth of Scarjo.
5145;The karaoke scene is worth the price of admission.
5146;i really liked the Virgin Suicides and I love Bill Murray, but I do not recommend this movie.
5147;Afterwards, you can impress other people by telling them that Lost in Translation is truly cinematic art, and that something this good was never meant for the masses!
5148;Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this gem, and she has created a quiet, sublime film that gets the point across not through endless chatter, but poignant dialogue that only comes out when it needs to.
5149;There is much in her style that comes from her famous father, but she makes it into her own, and she is unbelievably good at it.
5150;This is her second film, and it is even better than The Virgin Suicides , which was also an exceptional film.
5151;She will be a force to be reckoned with on the film scene for years to come, as she has an undeniable talent.
5152;much has to be said about the acting in this movie, because the performances from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen are top.
5153;Murray was nominated for an Oscar for this performance, and it is much deserving, because it is the best of his long career.
5154;Both of them work so well together, taking advantage of the simply written script and making the most out of every delicious line and nuance that Coppola has put into her work.
5155;The third major character in this movie has to be the city of Tokyo itself, and the director captures it and its strangeness perfectly.
5156;This time she delves into the art of character study focusing on the lives of has.
5157;What they both have in common is their feelings of unfulfillment in their lives, and this is magnified by their stay in Tokyo, Japan.
5158;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson play off each other well, as they look to each other to find something familiar to hold on to.
5159;These characters are definitely three dimensional, living and breathing on their own due to the excellent casting.
5160;This is probably Bill Murray's finest work due to the similarity of his character to himself.
5161;the screenplay for this movie was simple and real, focusing on subtleties of commuinication and interacting, while giving us a glimpse of Japan's urban lifestyle.
5162;One must remember that this is the theme of the movie.
5163;Often is the source of many of the humourous events in the movie, but it is done is a respectful manner showing Sofia's love for this city and country.
5164;And so it is that in finding each other they also find a new appreciation for life in general.
5165;A soundtrack adds so much to the moment.
5166;It's almsot worth seeing this movie so that all the other movies you've seen look better!
5167;the film is carried by a spot.
5168;Tokyo provides a lot of material for Murray and Johansson to work off of, and they do it well.
5169;Though you do not laugh out loud much, the movie does enjoy a great chuckling sense of humor throughout, and a genuine heart in the shared emptyness of Murray and Johansson contrasted with the pounding insistence of Tokyo.
5170;But it is a film that can be rewarding.
5171;Please, for the love of God, put some real special features on there.
5172;Deleted scenes RARELY are interesting, and the vast majority of the time shoudl have remained so.
5173;My favorite film of 2003 by far.
5174;Probably in my top 10 of all time.
5175;The end made my eyes well up with tears, which rarely happens.
5176;Murray and Johansson do the best they can with the material they have to work with, and cinematographer Lance Acord deserves props for filming the city of Tokyo so beautifully.
5177;The American characters in the film should have felt right at home, especially since the Japanese pop culture portrayed is actually very much based on US pop culture).
5178;This movie is visually OK.
5179;That's all I'm going to give it.
5180;I have heard that this is based on Coppola's relationship with (better) director Spike Jonze, and if so, I think the bitterness in her heart has gotten in the way of honest, effective storytelling.
5181;moving past that, though .
5182;You have to give it to this director, she's original.
5183;Scarrlett johansen is ok as the love interest.
5184;I was completely psyched to see Bill Murray as a Best Actor nominee for this year's Oscars and shamelessly rooted for him without having seen LOST IN TRANSLATION.
5185;Tokyo is a surreal, fascinating setting, especially when you realize that most Yanks have only seen the model version stomped by Godzilla all these years.
5186;I personally loved Murray's first dramatic turn twenty years ago in THE RAZOR'S EDGE and I'd always felt that Sofia Coppola got a horrendously.
5187;Also, I found the dialogue to be subtle, understated, nuanced, and compelling.
5188;Thus, the native population comes off as mysterious and inscrutable, their customs strange and exotic, and their culture beautiful but ultimately unknowable.
5189;The movie is beautifully shot, full of soul, and the dialogue and interactions between characters ring true to life.
5190;both Murray and Johansson burn brightly in their respective roles.
5191;Giovanni Ribisi delivers a brilliant performance as a preoccupied and distant husband.
5192;The sense of estrangement he creates is all the more heightened precisely because he doesn't flinch from the unrelenting loneliness and seclusion that one can find in the mundane and trivial setting of one's own home and community.
5193;And little is the word here (and that's a compliment), because Sofia Coppola, God love her, sees the world in small details.
5194;She sees the possibilities of everything afresh.
5195;liT is actually a fairly puritanical film.
5196;Charlotte and Bob share their intimacies fully clothes, lying on the bed, in the daylight.
5197;(The hotel singer helps by croaking, I'm so into you in the background.)
5198;Stay here with me and we'll start a jazz band, Charlotte tells Bob when he says he doesn't want to go home the next morning.
5199;These are the things we say when we are far from home and responsibility: it's easy to fantasize about starting a new life, beginning fresh.
5200;much has been made of the fact that she has a powerful daddy behind the scenes, implying that maybe her success is due less to her talents than to the name she carries with her.
5201;While it's impossible to deny the benefit of dropping the name Coppola when making a phone call or trying to get something done, there's also no denying that she can deliver the goods
5202;But Sofia Coppola is fair game for sniping.
5203;Yes she can, and I've got news for anyone who doesn't believe it: she's a major voice in the same way that Godard, Bogdanovich, Truffaut and Antonioni were.
5204;she has absorbed the central lesson of film, something even a George Lucas or a Steven Spielberg, lauded for their visual acumen, haven't as fully grasped: it's about pictures.
5205;And if she has to occasionally invoke the holy name of Coppola to create unique moments like she does, then more power to her.
5206;bill Murray has stated this is his favorite film of his, and the bed scene is the scene he is most proud of.
5207;simple idea: get them in bed together, and have them do something far more important and memorable than engage their genitals: they talk.
5208;About the most important things in life: marriage and children and growing up and figuring out what you're meant to do in life.
5209;And for that reason this is my favorite film of the entire last decade.
5210;pC humor, and people who don't like where they are are going to react more strongly to their strange environment, but after a while the I. don't.
5211;In fact I hesitate to call this a comedy, and it certainly isn't one in the way most people will expect.
5212;I think she's probably the best director working today.
5213;She thought it was deep, and so she liked it.
5214;It's interesting, because my wife always wants me to create conversation, or make her laugh.
5215;which brings me to the second point.
5216;These themes of what so many of us lose out on in life are the main crux of the film, and the most compelling and profound.
5217;one to share these moments with, but it's also the oh.
5218;Coppola obviously has great fondness for Tokyo, but is as willing to criticise and indeed poke fun as she is to make ode to.
5219;An insane talk show shows how the Graham Norton formula doesn't work everywhere, and that's a real show!So there is plenty to think about (and talk about judging the length of this review), it's not racist and it doesn't rely in the slightest on narrative drive or character arcs (what would McKee think?)
5220;It is a beautiful, beautifully judged film about realising the limitations of most lives, and getting through one week of it with someone who is a stranger but you still recognise.
5221;The Oooonly reason this script has ever seen the light of day is that it was directed by Ms. Coppola.
5222;Ditto with Bill Murray except he is the sole saving grace of this film.
5223;I assure you (even if you are the biggest Bill Murray fan who ever lived), you will NEVER want to watch the movie a second time.
5224;(In fact, I challenge anyone to stay awake and actually make it through one showing.)
5225;Excellent cinematography, great writing, teriffic performances
5226;Sofia Coppola has produced a very satisfying film.
5227;I find it very interesting that this film seems to provoke such potent and disparate reactions from people.
5228;faceted performances of the actors.
5229;This is the defining role of Bill Murray's career, and those who dismiss it as simply Bill looking hang.
5230;the thing I liked best, though, was the fact that there were various points in the movie where I expected a cheesy cliche Hollywoodesque turn to occur, and it never happened.
5231;That, to me, is the mark of a great film.
5232;See it, and keep an open mind.
5233;Some called it fantastic, beautiful, unforgettable, a masterpiece.
5234;When they meet each other on a night at the local hotel bar, a friendship develops and they decide to explore Tokyo together.
5235;the way the story is filmed is simple but very effective.
5236;The camerawork is fantastic and the locations are wonderful.
5237;Tokyo is a colourful background that gives the film certain lighting and most of all: atmosphere.
5238;This element makes the film extremely powerful.
5239;The atmosphere definitely makes it feel like that.
5240;It makes you feel like you are right there walking next to the characters which is a very effective way to tell a story.
5241;the actors, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson, both give fantastic performances.
5242;Bill Murray is absolutely funny and does a great job portraying his character.
5243;scarlett Johanson also does a great job and brings, together with Murray, the film to life.
5244;The chemistry is perfect between the two which gives fantastic scenes.
5245;But do you love dramas, atmospheric films with some humour sprayed on top of it: Lost in Translation is a film for you to see.
5246;With simple but very effective storytelling she has made an absolutely delicious atmospheric film that is a must.
5247;one of the best atmospheric films I have ever seen.
5248;Bill Murray displays some good comedic range in this comedy, but it is certainly not in the vein of a goofball Bill Murray comedy like Caddyshack or Kingpin.
5249;Scarlett Johannsen's character brings some interest to the film, although her character's relationship with her on.
5250;cultural and situational humor, most is worthy of only a momentary chuckle.
5251;The film itself is comedy on valium, and while it was a diverting and entertaining viewing experience with a few subtle messages on relationships and fame, I cannot understand the Oscar nominations.
5252;It has humor, action, and a 45 calibur revolver.
5253;Both lead characters were wonderful and I enjoyed the movie much better.
5254;From the difficulties of being stuck in line at a supermarket through to battling Cancer, his work is brilliantly portrayed as the film uses a mix of animation, the perfectly cast Giamatti, while blending both archive footage and recent narration by the real life Pekar perfectly.
5255;standout Scene: As reality is suspended briefly the actors take a backseat to listen to Pekar and the supremely funny Toby Radloff take centre stage.
5256;This is a genuinely funny film from the ultimate `anti.
5257;Mostly, what I appreciate in a movie is good writing.
5258;this book/movie comparison works both ways.
5259;time favorite books is Catcher in the Rye.
5260;It really is a great film about the subtle things in life that we hardly notice and having real conversations that we rarely have.
5261;a joke that was deployed a number of times and which made me shift uncomfortably in my seat, especially when everyone else in the theatre errupted into laughter.
5262;nor is it OK to suggest that the Japanese language is worth laughing at in and of itself.
5263;There was good Japanese culture .
5264;In other words, aspects of the other culture that have been reinterpreted to the satisfaction of the West are presented in a positive light, and the rest is simply fair fodder for a good laugh.
5265;I see it as being about the sublime feeling of being in the moment , well knowing of the inevitability of it's end and it's about the need humans have for commonality with each other .
5266;This film has had a profound effect on me and maby that feeling is based on my life at the present .
5267;It's a real and SUPERB film and the ending is beautifully done.
5268;Don't be fooled by the commercial
5269;But it is something deeper.
5270;It's an unspoken want, with brilliant illustration of alienation and familiar feelings.
5271;As a big Bill Murray fan, and after reading all the good reviews, I lined up to see this movie the day it opened in my area.
5272;I can only attribute it to Sofia getting a free ride on her daddy's name (again).
5273;There should be an Oscar for most over.
5274;i'd recommend seeing this movie, but only because so many others seem to just love it.
5275;This is really a funny sort of film.
5276;Yet it is strangely effective and gets you in.
5277;Probably the reason for that is that the subject matter of the film is treated with a subtly unusual in American films.
5278;An affection which can never go anywhere as they are both committed to their families.
5279;the film is funny but in a less frantic way than Murray's usual films.
5280;The attraction of the film however is more the affection that you feel for the characters.
5281;Murray also plays an attractive character.
5282;A person deeply committed to his children, a bit on auto pilot but who is able to handle Johanson's character without crudeness or the sort of resolution which occurs in Hollywood movies.
5283;No action is during the movie, no amazing plot twists or backstabbing characters.
5284;This is a movie quite possibly in its purest and most brilliant form, one that explores its character's emotions as you feel the same along with them.
5285;i highly recommend this movie to anyone in the mood for one of the few non.
5286;cliched love stories, and probably the best love story of our time.
5287;It's a really good movie.
5288;overall, this is a really good movie.
5289;Thumbs up for the real.
5290;Good direction, sets and acting
5291;liners given with a sly, knowing wink every two minutes, but the subtlty of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson's performances are brilliant.
5292;Their's is a love story, but an unconventional one that's more realistic and more honest than any other romantic movie out there.
5293;The movie is sweet, soft, quietly funny, subtle and wholly original.
5294;If you like unconventional characters in an unconventional place with an unconvntional story, then this is for you.
5295;It is a piece of art.
5296;honestness of Bob's and Charlottes (characters) relationship in the movie is striking, it is deep, without the complications of sex, its even more, they are there for one another when they need someone most.
5297;If you've ever just wanted a soul to listen to you and be there and hold you without sex, this movie is it.
5298;It makes you appreciate deepest friendships, and like any great movie, the ending makes the movie all worth it.
5299;This movie is hands down the greatest movie of 2003.
5300;Bill Murray has been in other amazing movies such as Caddyshack, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and Groundhog Day, but this is my absolute favorite.
5301;prime movie star is deep and believable, and Ms. Scarlett Johansson is beautiful, and a wonderful actress.
5302;stricken actor in the twilight of his career in his most subtle, nuanced, and engaging, ever: Nothing at all happens.
5303;voltage bond, and they proceed to entertain each other in a platonic and detatched way.
5304;It's seductive in a PG.13 train.
5305;Instead, you kind of dream your way through the movie, entranced, but not quite sure why.
5306;Ever since this film was released I've observed people arguing about its value.
5307;But audiences, particularly here in the US, demand immediate emotional satisfaction.
5308;Coppola slows the pacing so that it's more realistic.
5309;All of this is the context surrounding an unconsummated love between a younger woman and an older man.
5310;More and more, Americans on all sides of the political spectrum demand news and media that conform to their point of view.
5311;Empathy has become a rare commodity.
5312;For the most part, Lost in Translation was a very interesting romantic story about two people staying in the same hotel while in Tokyo.
5313;The secret to enjoying this movie is to make sure that you are in the right frame of mind while when you go to view this.
5314;There is a very laid back pace throughout the picture.
5315;bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson both did wonderful jobs.
5316;This was a very well thought out and carefully planned movie and it shows.
5317;This is definitely a movie to check out when you find yourself in that right frame of mind.
5318;The intent of the movie is to submerge you in a world of surreal experiences, as any trip to a foreign country (especially to one as complex as japan) would be.
5319;Dialog between the characters is realistic and didn't have me feeling like some screenwriter agonized hours over trying to make it as ornate and convoluted as possible.
5320;Truly a breath of fresh air in a medium where plots are thought only as vacant lots of dirt.
5321;I had thought that this could have been an interesting film.
5322;Now add popular favorite Bill Murray, doing his lovable shmoe shtick.
5323;Dip them both into emotional torpor in the sleek Park Hyatt, add local color, stir.
5324;The youngish director and heiress to American cinema did things her way a few years ago with her ambitious adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' novel The Virgin Suicides, crafting a truly poignant slab of Middle American art with A. list Hollywood talent.
5325;it's a cute little movie, if not as rich as her brother Roman's similarly themed CQ .
5326;we begin with a close.
5327;This is an excellent film, if you can apprecaite subtleties and nuances and are tired of most formulaic, mainstream Hollywood films.
5328;two American strangers meet in a Hotel in Tokyo and strike up an intimate, loving friendship.
5329;In one over the top scene, he is feted by an absolutely manic Japanese talk show host, who is supposed to be the Japanese verison of Johnny Carson.
5330;She's got an edge to her style and thus distinguishes herself from many of today's young actors/ actresses.
5331;this is not an overt comedy or a tense drama but it will to a more sophisticated audience than most of what is playing today.
5332;This is a classic example of the Press saying this is a Great film and the lemmings follow.
5333;I also think that the movie has a very strong declaration about the total alienation of human kind at the face of technology .
5334;two people lost in a foreign city and in their personal lives are able to reach a high level of friendship.
5335;It is very interesting to note that the director made this relationship one of friendship that is very expressly in a higher level then sex.
5336;the encounter and friendship of these two people lasts only a few days and does not have any future, but manages to reach high levels of closeness, which as always seems to be the only answer to alienation.
5337;their encounter sparked off a very interesting relationship and friendship between the pair.
5338;Who would foresee a Yale graduate wife of a photographer will develop an interesting friendship with a megastar in his mid.
5339;The topic was dealt with with delicate care and tenderness mixed with a slim sense of saddness.
5340;The director managed to balance all these aspects tactfully.
5341;The movie gave the Japanese culture a very fair portrayal which is very well done for an American movie.
5342;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson gave an excellent performance for the two characters.
5343;Scarlett Johansson as a wife longing for care and love in an alien city was also very well done.
5344;age actor was well crafted.
5345;the movie portrayed some of the beautiful sceneries from Tokyo and Kyoto and the cinematography is very well done.
5346;It is not a typical mainstream movie type of story that you would expect but it does give you a feeling of difference.
5347;The gags are very well done and keep the movie interesting.
5348;No matter what, Lost in Translation is still a movie of choice if you are looking for a movie with a touch of freshness.
5349;His portrait as Bob, a has.
5350;been in Hollywood who came to Japan to shoot a commercial for a whisky company, is amusing and touching at the same time with subtle touch of pathos.
5351;He does not say much about himself, but you can feel the emptiness of his life.2) Great acting of Scarlett Johansson, who is also impressive as Charlotte.
5352;She embodies the feeling of someone who is `lost,' who knows she should not be here, but cannot leave.
5353;that looks like beautifully printed postcard, the cinematography of `Lost in Translation' is most impressive when it introduces us the chaos of the metropolis seen through the eye of Bob and Charlotte.
5354;see the film for two great acting, photography, and the music.
5355;You may not like the rest of the film, but they are genuinely fantastic.
5356;This film goes expertly well to a place.
5357;established Bill Murray persona overwhelmed the Bob Harris character.
5358;He was very good in this film as a mellowed Bill Murray, but Groundhog Day was Bill Murray's performance of a lifetime so far, followed by his part in Caddyshack.
5359;This Bob Harris character who's a big action movie star who's hired to glamorize Suntory and who's so attractive to all the women (well, at least the white women) who pass him by?
5360;There's still the familiar SNL comic mixed into this Bob Harris.
5361;And then on top of everything else, they make his relationship with his wife on the phone so one.
5362;Nope, I really liked it and recommend it.
5363;It was a fun, successful depiction of Tokyo and some of its zany culture.
5364;daughter relationship and the real message of this film is, it's ok to let go of Daddy.
5365;She's pretty lightweight, all in all.
5366;so that's it, a somewhat fun film which is, like someone previously characterized it, quite underwhelming, but well worth watching.
5367;No one can doubt that Sofia Coppola will get better and better as she gets more practice as a filmmaker and will probably adds some real greats to the cinematic heritage.
5368;But it's a good movie despite all the above.
5369;I recognize that this review definitely represents a minority viewpoint regarding the merits of this film.
5370;First, the concept animating the film has excellent potential and the title is indeed an accurate reflection of the concept behind the film.
5371;Second, the acting of the two leads is indeed excellent and their chemistry develops exactly as intended.
5372;Third, the cinematography is also quite good.
5373;Fourth, there are several very clever moments and some truly enjoyable humorous incidents.
5374;Fifth and last, the movie captures some wonderful scenes of Tokyo and the aura it creates exactly mirrors all my totally uninformed preconceptions of what life in Tokyo is like for the upper classes.
5375;I may admire the technique and the technical brillance, but their totality leaves me unmoved.
5376;If you like brilliantly directed and technically inteesting films, you will probably enjoy this.
5377;And if you are a Bill Murray fan it is defintely worth your time.
5378;Iffy script, middling performances, totally awesome eighties soundtrack.
5379;It's rare when one movie is able to capture the essence of true lonliness and fellowship, but LOST IN TRANSLATION is such a film.
5380;Each one of us knows what it is like to be surrouned by many people, yet feel totally and utterlessly alone.
5381;deep appearances that many mistake for friendship, but the true soul.
5382;It also has some other things to say: to truly enjoy life you have to know yourself
5383;this is Bill Murray's finest performance to date and he'll probably get an Oscar nomination.
5384;Instead, the characters are brought to life by what we see them do, which to be honest isn't much.
5385;Here is a reality film that seems truly real.
5386;I enjoy its glamourous lifestyle, while suffering from the isolation a lot.
5387;And I already knows Japanese, still I can't feel being accepted in that country.
5388;They both are great actor/actress, their encounter is always sexy, but never explicit.
5389;Only with a good script and a good director that such a shy relationship can be portraited in such a powerful way.
5390;driven movie, you don't even need a story, all it takes is superb acting plus superb script and superb direction.
5391;an interpretation which frankly has shocked me.
5392;That's why I've viewed this fine and unusual work several times not as a critique of what Japan does to Americans but what modern high.
5393;paced professional life does to normal human beings who yearn for affection and genuine human contacts.
5394;The director Sofia Coppola has done a great job to honor the family tradition (Francis Coppola is her father) of fine film.
5395;On a second viewing, after leaving my expectations in the multiplex, I came to appreciate and even fall in love with this small, beautiful and touching ART FILM.
5396;Those of you who love those kinds of films know what I'm talking about.
5397;I hope this inspires many more small auteur films such as this.
5398;those of you who think this is Bill Murray's crowning dramatic achievement must see him in THE RAZOR'S EDGE.
5399;It's an overlooked film in which Murray gives an Oscar caliber performance.
5400;i've been hearing about this movie for months and I finally watched it with enthusiasm.
5401;this movie had a lot of potential, it's about an older man who is having a mid.
5402;A plot that speaks to a lot of people I'm sure.
5403;Here they are disillusioned with thier lives, they have a perfect chance to find themselves again because they are in a beautiful, exciting, innovative country.
5404;i absolutely respect endings that are meaningful.
5405;Chungking express and Fallen angels are two amazing movies that have a similar theme but is MUCH more enjoyable to watch.
5406;Take out all the funny jokes and witty banter.
5407;it gets two stars for the good cinematography and music, but that's about it.
5408;so, we've got Bill Murray .
5409;another excellent understated performance (restrained in the same way as his role was in RUSHMORE) .
5410;i liked the acting, the look, the subtlety of details, and I liked the humour .
5411;I, for one, thought it was the perfect ending.
5412;It's nice when movies let the audience do that.
5413;Bob and Charlotte are NOT happy in Japan.
5414;but it was a beautifully written love story that didn't need sex to have it go anywhere which is a rarity these days.
5415;but this was a lovely film.
5416;hearted film you watch to pick yourself up.
5417;In fact, this is probably one of the greatest films I've seen in my life.
5418;stick for me), but this truly is one of his best performances (that I've seen), for he's so subtle and toned down from the whacky guy so many people are used to, but that adds an enormous amount of depth to the film.
5419;He manages to convey so much with simple expressions and mannerisms alone.
5420;and Scarlett Johansson is also wonderful playing a soul.
5421;apathetic/jaded young wife discovering the real world and opening her eyes to, and truly looking at her own life for the very first time.
5422;Her chemistry with Bill Murray is unmatched.
5423;the soundtrack is also incredible.
5424;If you're in the mood for a quiet movie that'll make you think a little (about yourself and your own life, not in terms of plot), definitely check this out.
5425;As another reviewer stated, it really DOES get better each time you watch it!
5426;It is about capturing the beauty and reality of life through a medium.
5427;The same is true with literature.
5428;Instead, it attempts to give us an unbiased look into the lives of two ordinary human beings and the beauty that they can create, even if just for a moment.
5429;Making fun of Japanese people, lampooning them in this film, really put me off.
5430;The point of this comedy is: Aren't Japanese people funny?
5431;Japan is a fascinating country, but you'd never know it watching this film.
5432;Lost in Translation is the best movie of 2003 .
5433;In Tokyo, he meets up Charlotte played by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson.
5434;as the movie progresses, Bob and Charlotte form a friendship that starts to deepen into a budding romance as these two lost souls find each other.
5435;The movie does an incredible job of capturing these two people as they find each other in Tokyo.
5436;The visuals are just incredible and the movie does an amazing job of capturing the magnificent vistas in Japan.
5437;this is a really great movie that's also very funny which is to be expected with Bill Murray.
5438;There are just to many great scenes and funny lines to list here, but the movie will have you laughing.
5439;i love the ending of the movie .
5440;Sofia has an amazing take on the romantic, teary goodbye and I just love the way that scene includes a private moment between the characters.
5441;The soundtrack is also really great with the appropriate song playing at the right time, including the ending.
5442;A real film buff who appreciates not only the art of film, but beautiful photography and terrific acting, will like it.
5443;The movie had a couple of funny Bill Murray moments.
5444;He was very good in that.
5445;Do watch this film if you like subtle, satirical humor done in a well.
5446;The film certainly creates .
5447;in a convincing way .
5448;I love this film, it's so good and beautifull and sad in a way.
5449;Sofia Cappola is the master of moments and it's what the movie.
5450;It's sweet quite and unique way of showing hope and unexpected connections that we make that might not last long but yet stay with us forever.
5451;My favorite film of all.
5452;i'm a big fan of Bill Murray, but to call him Oscar worthy is nothing short of a travesty.
5453;I absolutely love this film by Sofia Coppola.
5454;Scarlett Johannson is an amazing actress and plays the part of Charlotte, a 22 year old graduate wondering what her roll in life is, perfectly allowing the audience to feel her worries about life and what her life will bring.
5455;though not a typical love story there is love between them and yet despite the age gap there is a great respect and admiration for one another.
5456;The films photography is amazing and the soundtrack even better.
5457;I also connected with it on the level of having myself been an American in a ultra.
5458;While the slow and subtle immersion into an unspoken affection is not for everyone, this hazy, bittersweet tale is a treasure for closet romantics.
5459;I believe, as opposed to my family, that this is a true classic of filmmaking.
5460;With great acting, great cinematography and a smoothe, touching story, Lost In Translation proves itself to be one of the best films of the year so far.
5461;But as they meet, they gain a wonderful friendship.
5462;bill Murrey has an Oscar potential role in this film.
5463;He is continuously sad, but maintains a subtle happiness that lights up the screen at times.
5464;It takes a great actor to balance that out.
5465;Scarlett Johannsen, suprisingly, takes on a similar role with a great force that really amazes you.
5466;They both make you sad, happy and inbetween at the same time.
5467;the cinematography, at times, was outstanding.
5468;It does movie relatively slow, but jokes keep it interesting.
5469;It is a romantic comedy.
5470;Otherwise, I recommend it to you, the reader of this review.
5471;bottom Line: This is probably one of the best films of the century in an allround way spanning acting, directing, writing and pure enjoyment.
5472;It's peaceful and poetic, to make you think, not just eke guffaws from the audience.
5473;I've worked in Tokyo under similar circumstances and had an exciting and eventfilled experience.
5474;And I'm a big Bill Murry fan.
5475;I'd rate this film 0 stars and 5 ZZZZZs.
5476;Sofia Coppola wrote and directed this movie and it was beautifully filmed by Lance Acord.
5477;If you've ever been to Asia on a business trip, this film captures perfectly the overwhelming off.
5478;Sofia Coppola captures that feeling perfectly.
5479;So they connect, they talk, they start hanging out together, they explore a little of Tokyo together.
5480;Kind of a bittersweet ending because you get the feeling they'll never see each other again.
5481;this is really a wonderful, engrossing film though.
5482;It is marvelously well written and directed.
5483;Bill Murray is perfect as the slightly bewildered American in the strange world of Tokyo advertising.
5484;Scarlett Johansson is extraordinary as the twenty.
5485;something young wife with a philosophy degree wondering about her future.
5486;The rest of the cast fills in the edges well, and the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking.
5487;really well worth the price of admission.
5488;I loved this movie from the opening shot right to parting one.
5489;The characrters are in an emotional, contemplative, stupor.
5490;This movie captured the otherness and familarity of many Asian cities.
5491;Tokyo is the other star of the film and the warmth of the Japanese people.
5492;Not a good recommendation .
5493;and yet I certainly cannot say that I didn't like it, or even greatly admire the skilled photography and, yes, direction.
5494;They share their angst and their snide humor, mostly aimed at the Japanese.
5495;They also bond and have some fun.
5496;i do see why Sofia Coppola has been rewarded for her superb direction
5497;We DO, however, get to see more of a hilarious, funky Japanese TV show, upon which Bill Murray guests in the film.
5498;If anyone tells you that you 'just didn't get it', please punch them in the face, for me .
5499;at least a dozen times.
5500;But the people who like it, love it.
5501;It is one of the most praised films of the year and probably finished second to Lord of the Rings for Oscar's Best Picture.
5502;therefore, it creates an interesting enigma.
5503;Writer/director Sophia Coppola decided to abandon powerful drama, instead opting for a film that focuses primarily on character development.
5504;Each scene is enjoyable as little vignettes, but most viewers will search for (and not find) something larger to keep their attention.
5505;what saves this artsy piece is a career performance by Bill Murray.
5506;This movie is charming and soulful and wonderful on many, many levels .
5507;but one of the nicest surprises is seeing Bill Murray show the sort of warmth he possessed in MEATBALLS.
5508;As a stranded actor adrift on the planet Tokyo, Bill shows his road miles and it is endearing.
5509;The result is a wholly satisfying (kind of breathtaking) little movie.
5510;headed opinion on why this is a good movie: This movie is about loneliness and isolation in a close.
5511;You feel their brief sparks of connection.
5512;It flows like a well documented life and that's high praise.
5513;also, to see Bill Murray be such a great, mature character is a thing of beauty.
5514;This movie has a story and everything is there to bring that story to life.
5515;And that's how it should be.
5516;Lost in Translation provides Bill Murray with an ideal role, playing a washed up actor making a commercial in Tokyo for a quick buck.
5517;You'll likely chuckle a few times but there are few riotously funny scenes, although I did laugh pretty hard when Murray encounters the Premium Fantasy woman.
5518;part drama, part broad comedy, part black comedy, part romance, and so forth.
5519;Brief Encounter
5520;She's found a unique voice that astutely addresses the disaffection and isolation so many of us feel in the modern world.
5521;Justifiably, she's become the first American woman to be nominated for Best Director by the Academy Awards and only the third woman in history to receive this honor.
5522;In addition to the superior direction, Bill Murray is outstanding, balancing his natural talents in comedy and pathos luminously.
5523;Overall, I most highly recommend this movie.
5524;Nice discernment with delicacy of mental action
5525;it's what makes this film great.
5526;if you have the ability and patience to appreciate the slight subtleties in the film, then it will be a rewarding experience.
5527;if you've seen it, and loved it.
5528;One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Bob asks Charlotte, who is giving him the business over his dalliance with the hotel's lounge singer, Was there no.
5529;Scarlett Johannson was enthralling, particularly considering the fact that she turned 18 during the making of the film.
5530;Usually one sees older actresses playing younger, but she very successfully turns this formula on its head.
5531;If, on the other hand, you can appreciate the crises we face coming to grips with who we are, what we are doing with our lives, and why we are doing it, then I would suggest that you will very much appreciate this small, thoughtful film (budget was between 2 and 3 million dollars, I gather).
5532;The transfer was generally good, though in the beginning there was some break.
5533;The sound was very good.
5534;Hopefully, a special edition will be forthcoming at some point in the future.
5535;this movie has so many levels it is so finely done.
5536;it is an intimate and delicate portrait of lives intersecting with the tenderest touches of reality and hope.
5537;I saw this film in the theatres and was amazing at the writing.
5538;this is the best roll that Bill Murray has done since Rushmore.
5539;The one thing I can say is that the two films has a simplified story.
5540;The images, music and silence all set the tone of the film and helped move it forward.
5541;this film is truly an art house film.
5542;For those of us who do not these things it is a great movie.
5543;It's reasons like this that makes this movie work.
5544;for those who say you have to watch it a few times I agree with it.
5545;Though I got the film on the first try.
5546;For any westerner who's ever spend an extended period of time in Tokyo, LiT perfectly recreates that feeling of apartness and disconnection from the local culture.
5547;This is a subtle, refined film with a thin story .
5548;more of a poem .
5549;This underscores the film that many don't get.
5550;How touching, even for the Japanese who saw life through our eyes.
5551;The best part is after leaving the theater, the facination continued through this great experience I'm having here in Tokyo in my life.
5552;I loved the way that the film contrasted the Westerners with Japanese culture.
5553;I found that to be really super realistic and a refreshing respite from the no.
5554;win any is beyond me.
5555;Coppola seems talented and the cinematography was beautiful, but this film still read like a spoiled, jaded rich girl's vision of Japan.
5556;It was all about the beautiful surface.
5557;I've also know beautiful young ladies like Scarlett's character at an emotional level like this.
5558;I've sold out and bought in just like this.
5559;And the pace of this movie was perfect in my humble opinion.
5560;It's transcending to see yourself in a movie.
5561;It's the ultimate movie experience.
5562;I absolutely adored this movie in theaters and it has become my most favorite film of all time.
5563;star reviewers here, who relish in pointing out how the rest of us common folk just can't comprehend the real meaning behind this film
5564;time favorite films are Neil LaBute's In the Company of Men and Your Friends and Neighbors, both of which are comprised almost entirely of dialogue and nothing else.
5565;They were also shot in an eavesdropping, fly on the wall manner.
5566;But the big difference is that LaBute's films had original ideas and engaging characters, while Sofia Coppola's doesn't.
5567;Even if it were a purely physical attraction, and while Faris is certainly a beautiful actress, there is no man or woman I know who would prefer her to Scarlett Johansson.
5568;It's a very subtle story set in Japan involving 2 people that cross paths.
5569;Busy with kids, work, etc.
5570;they strike up a friendship.
5571;They enjoy each other's company, they both appear to want more, but realize it's probably never going to happen.
5572;It's tough but ultimately it's the right thing to do.
5573;Alot of powerful emotions and acting without alot of words.
5574;He runs into an attractive 20.
5575;this is a mature, one.
5576;The story, music and visuals pulled me into these character's temporary world for the 104.
5577;the film succeeds as an amusing social commentary and a deep love story, as well as a visual/musical delight.
5578;I'll only focus on the deep love element.
5579;but it's not just a cathartic piece, Sofia has some powerful insights to offer on the nature of true romantic love.
5580;For one, love transcends age difference (Bob is about 30 years older than Charlotte).
5581;For another, it's possible to be married and experience romantic love for another.
5582;As the story progresses you'll see how comfortable Bob and Charlotte are with each other, how they look into each other's eyes .
5583;the windows of the soul .
5584;in a profoundly naked sense.
5585;But this presents a conundrum for Bob.
5586;While all this is obvious, it goes deeper.
5587;bob could have taken advantage of Charlotte if he wanted to but didn't because he genuinely loved her, which is revealed at the end.
5588;Simply put, true love transcends sexual expression and sexual union does not equal love.
5589;the ending is powerful and tear.
5590;It's just an older man and a too.young woman embracing in the midst of 20 million.
5591;Tears flow, kisses are given and unheard words are whispered.
5592;I saw this film with high expectations and was pretty dissapointed.
5593;I'm a big fan of Bill Murray and his peformance was good, so that wasn't the problem.
5594;I believe the main key to this film's success is being shot on location in Tokyo.
5595;The camera exposes Tokyo's foreign beauty and mystery all wrapped up in one.
5596;You need to look at how the camera is used during a scene, and what it exposes to you, that will make you enjoy the film.
5597;I will admit it's kind of an artsy movie, but thats what makes it so good.
5598;It makes you take a hard look at the film to try and understand it.
5599;And therein lies the beauty of Lost In Translation.
5600;Approach the movie with an open, yet critical mind, and you'll reap all the benefits of this great film.
5601;It is a very subtle movie, something which you want to watch on a calm day and just relax.
5602;some of the scenes looks to be making fun of the Japanese: But they are not, cultural differences always makes one look funnier and weird when compared to the other.
5603;'These are some of the things which have been very well captured in the movie.
5604;the background Music is great, goes very well with the movie.
5605;The wowing Japanese urban background, elegant hotel sets and the overall exotic environs surely feel fresh.
5606;Together with little presence of American actors (besides of course the male and female leads), they also effortlessly transport the audience to the foreign territory and switch our mindset from one of an, well, audience to that of a tourist.
5607;bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deliver a great performance.
5608;Their characters show their subtle appreciation of each other's company while their mutual feelings are ever closer to the boiling point.
5609;In order to create the mood, the movie relies on a lot of short scenes.
5610;specific factors such as the exotic scenery and foreign faces.
5611;One good thing is the director utilizes very well the location to craft the mood
5612;Having read some reviews beforehand, I expected the movie might not be very enjoyable, but I find it fascinating instead.
5613;And I understand well that would be funny to native speakers of English, as the two Americans in the movie.
5614;i think it is true that Japanese characters in U. s. movies tend to be portrayed as one.
5615;As the two protagonists exchanged pleasantries late one night over drinks, their budding friendship seemed genuine and entirely believable.
5616;To the foreign eye, all of the scenes of Japan must've looked mysterious and beautiful.
5617;I think the cinematography was great and there were many beautiful scenes, but it seemed so fragmented.
5618;It's like okay here we have a scene in a buddist temple, next we have a scene of a wedding couple in kimonos in Kyoto, next.
5619;Great film in terms of cinematography, music, tension, and bringing out the exotic feel of Japan, but I think it may be a bit overrated as for being nominated for best Oscar picture.
5620;Scarlett and Bill were fantastic and Sofia did a great job as writer/director.
5621;If you are away from home, whether in another country or another time zone, it's great to find someone to connect with.
5622;If you are at a convention, then you have a greater chance of meeting like.
5623;There are so many things to do, to see, and to film in Tokyo
5624;But I find the Karaoke scene interesting because this is really part of the Japanese culture and that storyline should be developed more.
5625;I thought it was just great!
5626;There are a lot of emotions that this movie takes you on, an emotional rollercoaster if you will.
5627;Bill Murray is great and so is Scarlett!
5628;They are two lost souls looking for one another, it is all together a great movie!
5629;I was so happy to see this film get best screenplay Oscar.
5630;For those who have eyes to see Lost in Translation pokes gentle and loving fun at almost EVERY person in it.
5631;it is a beautiful film.
5632;It is so still and subtle it could have even been made by a Japanese.
5633;Because you can't see what beauty there is to see.
5634;A lot is happening in this film but it is subtle.
5635;there is value in seeing ourselves as others see us.
5636;There is also value in looking beyond the surface.
5637;If you can understand that you will know why so many love this one.
5638;The ennui of the idle rich.
5639;Bored with their treasures so undeservedly received, as in the case of Bob's million.
5640;I am a huge fan of Ozu, and I know how a master craftsperson can manipulate emotions using a minimal of stimulus.
5641;Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deliver a find performances, the best possible when working with such material.
5642;The visuals are lovely, and one can almost catalog the influences director by director.
5643;The same cast, with the same concept could have produced an excellent film.
5644;life circumstance leaves him richer than God but a shadow of his artistic past.
5645;Neither is content in their career, their life, their marriage, or their future.
5646;In finding each other they enjoy a nice respite in their otherwise noxious lives.
5647;There are far better movies, far more intellectual and better made, and without a doubt Daddy's influence alone pushed this movie along.
5648;movie it works (at least it did for me).
5649;Since the whole point of the film was explore the nature of deep but fleeting relationships, clearly Bill told Scarlett that he will always remember the impression she made on him and their time in Japan.
5650;Was it really that mysterious?
5651;It is dreamlike, hypnotic, atmospheric and quiet and makes no pretense to being some great statement or telling some great parable.
5652;day film, or one to watch in a quiet, introspective mood.
5653;but this is one of the best and most well crafted films i have ever seen.
5654;The ending is perfect for the film.
5655;but it is most definatly worth the risk.
5656;In my humble oppinion I think this movie is fantastic.
5657;It draws you into this fantastic dreamy world filled with rained soaked heavy clouded sky and shimmering distant city lights.
5658;Lost in Translation has the charm and mysterious intrigue of the Japanese culture (which I happen to be fascinated by), and has a soothing pace and temperment that subtlely mesmorizes.
5659;But Allen's movies, particularly his classics Manhattan , Annie Hall and later works such as Hannah and Her Sisters and Crimes and Misdemeanors , contain characters that are relatable.
5660;For instance, it is a thoroughly appropriate reflection of Copolla's post.
