I:10370;1;My daughters (4yrs and 5yrs old) and I were entranced by the movie and anxious to watch the next in the series!
I:10370;2;Watching the 50 year old mystery of 'The Chamber' evolve was pure entertainment and the culprit a surprise!
I:10370;3;I recommend this movie without hesitation!
I:10370;4;This movie is for kiddies who are still in their nurseries learning how to speak!
I:10370;5;Lord of the Rings is the real deal.
I:10370;6;Movie strayed quite a bit from the book, and we found Dumbledore to be less sage and kind in this movie than in the first and second.
I:10370;7;I liked the 1st movie a lot.
I:10370;8;I got it for my son, but I must admit that I love it.
I:10370;9;The FXs are great and the story is very good.
I:10370;10;I've got the books and found the second Harry Potter movie to be much like the first.
I:10370;11;It's reasonably well done, more so than most adult book/ movie adaptations but still manages to leave some details out.
I:10370;12;pretty good adaptation, worth having in your Harry Potter collection
I:10370;13;This movie totally blew away the first one in every possible way, and is easily one of the top movies to have come out last year.
I:10370;14;The friendships were sweet how they always stuck up for one another, the Quidditch match was awesome to see, everyone involved gave wonderful performances, the final showdown between Harry and the Basilisk was just cool, and the scenes with Hagrid, Dumbledore, Dobby and Fawkes the Phoenix were sweet and touching as well.
I:10370;15;This film is a masterpiece with a mix of just about everything.
I:10370;16;some frightening, touching and humorous scenes all joined together.
I:10370;17;I loved this movie and am very happy I got a chance to see it.
I:10370;18;It even has a language of its own.
I:10370;19;But the way they made the film, it seems so real.
I:10370;20;The teacher is so self.
I:10370;21;as for the movie itself, the cinematography and special effects were, as to be expected, superb.
I:10370;22;And, most of the actors were pretty good, including Dobby who was computer generated.
I:10370;23;As a fan of the books, I'll be looking forward to the next one, and hopefully they will just continue to improve.
I:10370;24;"The British class system is alive and well in Warthogs
I:10370;25;The magic car allows them to escape.
I:10370;26;The Secret Chamber is found by magic, and boys leap to discover the secrets.
I:10370;27;There is a final confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who dies by magic.
I:10370;28;Those who enjoyed it can have their viewpoint.
I:10370;29;Daniel Radcliffe, while Rupert Grint can use a little more help.)
I:10370;30;I enjoyed it a lot and it was entertaining.
I:10370;31;Much of it was funny.
I:10370;32;The Good: It is everything the first was.
I:10370;33;see movie for any Harry Potter fan.
I:10370;34;It may not have the suspense and the gripping scenes Rowling's book has but it's still a fantastic feature!
I:10370;35;Chris Columbus once again does a wonderful job on the movie.
I:10370;36;He keeps the Harry Potter 'magic' alive.
I:10370;37;He has created something that in the near future will be a classic.
I:10370;38;The characters, the plot, the inventions, and the suspense are all wonderful!
I:10370;39;Emma Watson once again plays her role to the best of her ability.
I:10370;40;She is perfect for the role of Hermione!
I:10370;41;"The movie certainly has more than it's share of charm
I:10370;42;The film's special effects and the acting will impress you.
I:10370;43;This sequel to 2001's 'movie of the year' is scarier, longer, more suspenseful, and more interesting than the first.
I:10370;44;But you obviously need to know the story of the first book (movie) to understand and enjoy this installment.
I:10370;45;The late Richard Harris (Dumbeldore) is first a surprise then an immeasurable relief.
I:10370;46;and fated to be the proudest legacy of the movie that is a beautifully crafted dark fable.
I:10370;47;In fact this installment is something you would enjoy even if you haven't read the books!
I:10370;48;The wacky inventions will impress you (as I mentioned before).
I:10370;49;Another thing that I was impressed by was the enigmatically stunning phoenix (a Greek mythical bird that burns into flames).
I:10370;50;"This feature has tons of new things
I:10370;51;harry Potter is a creative work of art!
I:10370;52;well, I love ALL the movies, but this is among my favorites.
I:10370;53;12) fiction, this movie provides insights about how 12.
I:10370;54;olds look, talk, and think.
I:10370;55;so, it's a movie I watch often, and there's always something new to notice, in it.
I:10370;56;what I really like is the maturity that emerged in this movie, as Harry and his friends moved beyond the normal ups and downs of childhood, and accepted the responsibilities that came with the gifts they'd been given, in life.
I:10370;57;the twists and turns in this movie work well, and the characters .
I:10370;58;It's a movie you could see over and over and still like it.
I:10370;59;I laughed so hard that I cried both times.
I:10370;60;It was one of the best movies all around that I've ever seen in my life.
I:10370;61;(And considering a couple of other movies I've seen, that is saying something).
I:10370;62;my favorite character is still Ron.
I:10370;63;this was a great movie.
I:10370;64;the 1st is still my favorite but this is still classic.
I:10370;65;Columbus sticks to the book extremely well, gets everything exactly how it should.
I:10370;66;diagon ally, the costumes, the look, hogwarts, school, it was all great.
I:10370;67;First, I loved the movie.
I:10370;68;the special features are all very kid.
I:10370;69;Snape, for example, is in my opinion the most interesting character, and I'd have loved to hear Alan Rickman say something about playing him.
I:10370;70;Loved the movie and I loved how much it stuck to the book.
I:10370;71;We have truly enjoyed reading and then watching the Harry Potter series.
I:10370;72;But the first 3 movies have been fantastic.
I:10370;73;The Cinematography is excellent and the movies follow the story line of the books.
I:10370;74;whilst the film is an improvement on the first one, it still was an overrated piece of film.
I:10370;75;should have taken that job on The West Wing!Kenneth Brannagh was able to perform as himself, playing a character whose reputation far exceeds their actual talent!!
I:10370;76;all in all Columbus' films and Rowling's books show a great ability to take cliched ingredients from many years of children's books and then cook them into something highly unoriginal, but that kids THINK is original.
I:10370;77;There are extra scenes, tons of behind the scenes stuff, overall worth every penny to get your hands on a copy of this Blu.
I:10370;78;I am a Harry Potter fan so I would of course like this movie and give it a good review.
I:10370;79;The second disc, packed with features, includes 19 new and extended scenes.
I:10370;80;Most of them are extended and a few are new and there is also 2 alternates.
I:10370;81;Hope you enjoy the movie!
I:10370;82;I hope the next movie will shine over this one.
I:10370;83;Although a little dissapointed with the first movie, I feel that the second installment of this series was great!
I:10370;84;"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an excellent sequel, superior and darker in tone than ""Sorcerer's Stone."""
I:10370;85;Branagh shines as the conceited pretty boy Gilderoy Lockhart.
I:10370;86;"such as Harry&his
I:10370;87;Possession is hinted at with the characters of Harry and Ginny.
I:10370;88;Chamber of Secrets is one of the better Harry movies.
I:10370;89;It's stronger than its predecessor,and worth venturing into.
I:10370;90;This is a great follow up to the first movie.
I:10370;91;Of the first four episodes, this is easily the best.
I:10370;92;Use of characters and overall story nicely done.
I:10370;93;As with all the Harry Potter films,and books, this one is enjoyable for fans of all ages.
I:10370;94;Great set with lots of extras.
I:10370;95;It is sooo nice to be able to watch the extended version all at once like they have shown on TV.
I:10370;96;I do recommend this set if you are a Harry Potter Fan.
I:10370;97;I bought this because I had all the other movies EXCEPT this one.
I:10370;98;It was a great price and is a great movie
I:10370;99;Anyway, still, it was excellent, and is highly recommended.
I:10370;100;My daughter liked these movies and so we all watched and enjoyed them.
I:10370;101;I'm 66 and Husband is 72 and we still enjoyed!
I:10370;102;such an escape and so beautifully executed.
I:10370;103;great fun for the whole family.
I:10370;104;A bit scary for the younger ones.
I:10370;105;perfect for our 10 year old.
I:10370;106;But overall the screenwriters did a nice job of pulling the movie together.
I:10370;107;Overall this movie was quite a thriller and a great new addition to my growing Potter collection.
I:10370;108;I love the detail that you don't see until you have seen it on Blu.
I:10370;109;ray it's like seeing it for the first time!
I:10370;110;My wife has read the books and seen parts of the movie on TV, but this we are working our way through the series, and she is enjoying it.
I:10370;111;My daughter has seen the movies several times, and likes it each time.
I:10370;112;It is a really good movie that can be watched repeatedly.
I:10370;113;It is a great movie, even if you know the whole story line.
I:10370;114;movie came in brand new, and was a very good price.
I:10370;115;this movie is even better then the first and a movie that everyone should get i think daniel radcliffe is a awesome actor and a perfect character for this part it makes the movie even more interesting to watch when he plays it.
I:10370;116;anyways this movie is great its a wonderful movie for the whole family to watch so if you dont have it now then you should get it.
I:10370;117;The movie works just fine, I hate the special features.
I:10370;118;It leads you into games instead of the actual special features.
I:10370;119;I honestly think she is one of the best writers and it is well told on the screen.
I:10370;120;"These box sets are extremely nice
I:10370;121;The box itself has to be the best design of a blu.
I:10370;122;ray package I have seen yet, it is constructed of very heavy laminated cardstock with a magnetic catch to hold it shut and has a thin cardstock sleeve to protect it.
I:10370;123;the film itself is beautifully remastered so the stunning scenery and impressive special effects truly come to life.
I:10370;124;ray disc with special features such as:Behind the Story .
I:10370;125;a behind the scenes documentary about the work the Directors and Designers went through to imagine the world for filming.
I:10370;126;screen tests for Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson.
I:10370;127;rom features, packed full of cool stuff.
I:10370;128;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets far exceeds the first film in tension, excitement, laughs, and gasps.
I:10370;129;You can tell a real difference in physical maturity of the three main characters, but more importantly their acting has also matured a good deal as well.
I:10370;130;Daniel Radcliffe gives a charming performance as everyone's favorite wizard, Harry Potter, and Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are adorable and hilarious as Harry's sidekicks, Ron and Hermione.
I:10370;131;This film provides a great deal of enjoyment for children, but the adults aren't left out in the cold since there are plenty of impressive (and believable) special effects and heart.
I:10370;132;Harry Potter movie 2 is one of my favorites because the kids are still young and the plot line is quite catchy :P Enjoy!
I:10370;133;all and all, this movie is worth your money, although the casing shoud be much better than the flimsy carton in wich came packed.
I:10370;134;I highly recommed this movie.
I:10370;135;coat anything, and the violent parts of the book are interpited quite realistically on the screen this time around.
I:10370;136;this movie runs at a great pace (mostly because they had so much to cover in so little time) and all of the actors fit right into their rolls.
I:10370;137;on the technical side, the animators did a skillfull job with the CGI, blending it seamlessly with animatronic robots.
I:10370;138;on the whole, it is a great movie which follows the Harry Potter book accurately.
I:10370;139;Though purists will argue over slight modifications and exclusions, it is still a movie that all can enjoy!
I:10370;140;I've never been a fan of this type of fantasy movie, but Chris Columbus has done a pretty good job.
I:10370;141;This the second Harry Potter flick, and better than the first.
I:10370;142;Through excellent effects and good acting performances, fans and non.
I:10370;143;fans of all ages will be able to enjoy Chamber.
I:10370;144;The level of realism throughout the film is excellent.
I:10370;145;Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is the type of movie that will be around forever.
I:10370;146;So far the two Harry Potter movies have been excellent movies in which spirit of the books by JK Rowling has been captured and expanded upon.
I:10370;147;magical and the other being a witch or wizard) leads to a very unstable environment at Hogwarts.
I:10370;148;directed by Chris Columbus and written by Steve Kloves this movie packed with the details that Rowling weaves throughout her book.
I:10370;149;The score by John Williams is excellent and well suited to the movie.
I:10370;150;Roger Pratt's cinematography is amazing.
I:10370;151;There is flashback to an earlier time at Hogwarts by way of a magical Diary that is brilliantly lit and shot in a sepia tone that looks just like the color of old paper.
I:10370;152;kenneth Branagh gives a great performance that should have gotten more attention at award time.
I:10370;153;His costuming and look are very well matched with that of Draco Malfoy, a nemesis of Harry's.
I:10370;154;Shirley Henderson as a ghost is also very good and steals her scenes.
I:10370;155;Returnees Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, and in particular the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore are very good.
I:10370;156;Christian Coulson does a good job as the mysterious Tom Riddle.
I:10370;157;daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) are very good in this movie and have their characters down.
I:10370;158;Watson in particular is excellent.
I:10370;159;harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets in an underrated movie that is a must see.
I:10370;160;I obviously had high expectations as it is an excellent book and they had to make it an excellent movie.
I:10370;161;I saw the first movie, 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone' and enjoyed it, but this was seriously twice as good.
I:10370;162;I didn't think the book was twice as good as the first, but they really made the movie good.
I:10370;163;the effects were as good as ever.
I:10370;164;i thought the beginning was funny because Harry was so much bigger than the first, and Ron's voice had broken, but I got used to it.
I:10370;165;Ron's wand backfiring also made me laugh.
I:10370;166;finally, Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore who recently died played an excellent part.
I:10370;167;He was an excellent Dumbledore, and I doubt the next one will be as good.
I:10370;168;overall, I loved 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' and everyone should see it because it's a great movie that nobody should miss.
I:10370;169;Comes with over 10 minutes of extended scenes, the acting is awesome and a fun movie to watch during Halloween!
I:10370;170;It's a great book of magic .
I:10370;171;I received this movie promptly, and I got it at a great price.
I:10370;172;That is a win win situation for me.
I:10370;173;I was quite satisfied with the timeliness of my order.
I:10370;174;Chamber of Secrets is amazing.
I:10370;175;The special effects were the best I've seen in a long time, and they are espechily amazing when you look at the creatures.
I:10370;176;This movie features a lot of humor, much more than in the Sorcerer's Stone.
I:10370;177;The action scenes are top.
I:10370;178;He knows exactly how to completely surprise those watching the movie.
I:10370;179;well, just watch the scene.
I:10370;180;other than that, this movie is a must.
I:10370;181;I hope he does as good of a job as Columbus did on this movie.
I:10370;182;Let's face it: a movie will never be the story the book was, and I suppose this movie is perfect.
I:10370;183;And while many scenes, in spite of differing in small ways from the book's description, were positively perfect (I offer the dueling training scene in defense of this claim), other scenes seemed to favor excitement over accuracy.
I:10370;184;In the Quidditch scene, for example, Malfoy is able to keep pace with Harry through some exceptionally difficult flying, and yet, wasn't Malfoy supposed to have made a fool of himself out there on the field?Even if you didn't read the book, while you may enjoy the fast.
I:10370;185;as for casting, I loved everyone, as usual.
I:10370;186;This movie was ten times better than the first one and ten times better than the book version.
I:10370;187;But after seeing the second movie I have no doubts that the third movie will be wonderful.
I:10370;188;This second Harry Potter film is a fine adventure, and this two.
I:10370;189;"
I:10370;190;disc Two navigates easily and contains a number of good items, including: an enlightening 16.
I:10370;191;Nineteen additional scenes are available, and they are a lot of fun.
I:10370;192;"I wish several had been used in the theatrical release, including a fine bridge between (a) Hermione's telling Harry he could, indeed, be the heir of Slytherin, and (b) Harry's feeling the curious stares of his housemates
I:10370;193;(I'd love to see Tim Burton tackle an instalment!)
I:10370;194;I think all three young leads are better this time around, and of course the entire supporting cast is flawless.
I:10370;195;Sets and props are inspired, and the effects are breathtaking.
I:10370;196;The film is very good and the extras are quite entertaining.
I:10370;197;this year at Hogwarts snakes talk and Harry communicates with them.
I:10370;198;This movie is a little not so popular by comparison to the first in Malaysia but its attraction is overwelmingly great for me.
I:10370;199;I am very eager to watch the third installment from Harry
I:10370;200;This movie is a lot of fun.
I:10370;201;the whole series is enjoyable and grows with the audience.
I:10370;202;I'd recommend it even though it doesnt follow the book 100%
I:10370;203;The second movie of the second book of the Harry Potter series is as fun as the first one.
I:10370;204;The visual effects are really nice, such as the Dobby character and the Quidditch matches.
I:10370;205;The casting of the new characters are really fitting, too.
I:10370;206;It is one of those movies that you sit and enjoy either wit or without the kids.
I:10370;207;This movie really is worth rating!
I:10370;208;My son and I are reading the entire series this school year, and after reading each book we are watching the corresponding film.
I:10370;209;We have both been impressed by the accuracy of the film to the book, the special effects, and the faithfulness of the characters to those in the book.
I:10370;210;We know that given the length of the books, it is very difficult to condense the stories into a film, but we feel that all of the most pertinent content was retained, and we love seeing what our mind's eye conjured up during our reading, displayed so well through the director's and actor's rendition of events in the film.
I:10370;211;i love the special effects that created Dobby.
I:10370;212;But Dobby is a fully developed character, not just a special effect.
I:10370;213;He has personality, moves like a living being, and turns out to have a good bit of magic of his own.
I:10370;214;i am also impressed by Tom Riddle.
I:10370;215;old Riddle is charming in a horrible way, and very impressive in a way similar to Anakin Skywalker.
I:10370;216;A friend requested this item.
I:10370;217;It was great that Amazon could deliver it directly to her and I did not have to go to the USPS and reship it!
I:10370;218;Harry Potter and the Chaber of Secrets was magical, hilarious, and scary.
I:10370;219;In fact I loved the first movie, but Chamber of Secrets was even better.
I:10370;220;The kids were really fantastic.
I:10370;221;Daniel Radcliffe was also good.
I:10370;222;"Hermione (Emma Watson) was perfect once again
I:10370;223;Kenneth Bragnah (Gilderoy Lockhart) was hilarious.
I:10370;224;The score by John Williams and the direction of Chris Columbus were perfect once again.
I:10370;225;See this movie if you want to be absorbed into a magial tale that won't let you down.
I:10370;226;This is a wonderful movie!
I:10370;227;Rich in colours and an excellent storyline.
I:10370;228;This is definitely one of my favorite movies yet.
I:10370;229;Actually, Dobey makes the movie!
I:10370;230;The Harry Potter franchise is so popular and such a box office powerhouse that critics must refuse to lambast it for fear of losing their license.
I:10370;231;It is a preteen fantasy film, but that's all it is.
I:10370;232;Yes, it has great effects if you don't mind the type of CGI cartoon realism we now must endure thanks to Episodes 1.3, but there's nothing magical about the journey this film takes you on.
I:10370;233;All of the above mentioned movies, and there are many more, were capable of mixing whimsey with scarey moments and packaging the adventure in such a way that you feel you've just been on a dangerous but magical adventure.
I:10370;234;i'm sure it translates better in the book.
I:10370;235;HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is a big improvement on the first film.
I:10370;236;the effects this time around surpass the first film and Daniel Radcliffe and his young co. stars are growing nicely into their roles.
I:10370;237;especially the sequence with the giant spiders, but there is a lot more action here and for schmoes like me who can't get into the books this is well worth a look, if a bit long.
I:10370;238;Dumbeldore's Office: Take a tour and see how designers constructed it for the film.
I:10370;239;And finally there is a game where you match the spell with it's effect and a preview of the computer game.
I:10370;240;This is just a harmless fantasy movie.
I:10370;241;Daniel Radcliffe is the only Harry Potter!
I:10370;242;I think most people, even people who are not H. P. fans, will love this movie.
I:10370;243;I give it 5 stars!
I:10370;244;I absolutely love the Harry Potter series.
I:10370;245;I especially like the first and second movies.
I:10370;246;This Harry Potter movie is great!
I:10370;247;My nephew loves it and he is 4!
I:10370;248;It goes along with the book pretty good.
I:10370;249;If you haven't watched it yet then you must!
I:10370;250;You won't be dissappointed, I promise!
I:10370;251;hough it is still remarkable, and is based on a book that in some ways out did its predecessor, this movie did not seem to outdo its cinematic prequel.
I:10370;252;ok so i may be 16 soon to turn 17 but i went to see this film with a bunch of mates as there was nothing all that interesting on other than films we had already seen, and to be honest i thought that it was an excellent film, made well, great acting and the effects kicked .
I:10370;253;This movie is as good as the book on which it's based.
I:10370;254;It's surprisingly faithful, though I wish they'd have let the audience know more about Ginny Weasley's crush on Harry Potter.
I:10370;255;It's as good as the first movie, occasionally it's even better.
I:10370;256;The spider chase scene is genuinely frightening, and moments involving a giant snake could be too much for little kids to take.
I:10370;257;watch it before you show it to younger kids.
I:10370;258;That way, you end up catching a good movie twice, and you can determine whether your kids should watch it at all.
I:10370;259;I think that Harry Potter is a great book and or movie for kids to read.
I:10370;260;I enjoy reading Harry Potter.
I:10370;261;Theres always somthing new to find out about his life and his school.
I:10370;262;This second movie is better than the first.
I:10370;263;the thing that really made me like this movie is that these kids are real.
I:10370;264;They grew up, got uglier, got prettier, got taller, got fatter, and everything else all of us slugs go through.
I:10370;265;the story wasn't as detailed as the book story and they cuts lots of things out that I thought would be good in the movie but oh well!If you liked the first movie, you'll definitely like this movie.
I:10370;266;parts of this movie was enjoyable and entertaining.
I:10370;267;the flying car was fun to watch, shades of Chitty Bang Bang and Stars Wars special effects crammed together.
I:10370;268;Features are easy to access, and the best part is by far the deleted scenes and interviews.
I:10370;269;Being a fan of the books, the movie does it pretty much a good amount of justice.
I:10370;270;Some parts may not work with the book but when you consider the length of the books, the way the writer condensced it, it works well enough.
I:10370;271;If you liked the books, get the movie, I highly reccomend it.
I:10370;272;loving Christian,I had my reservations about watching the Harry Potter movies.
I:10370;273;i found them to be entertaining and the biggest fact that I came out with is that the movie is more about love and loyalty to friends that wickedness.
I:10370;274;there are dark sides to everything but this I feel teaches what is good in people.
I:10370;275;disc Widescreen Edition) is the second part of the Harry Potter series and a dandy of a movie.
I:10370;276;This starts an amazing adventure filled with magic and fun.
I:10370;277;Special effects are amazing and the music is also a treat for the ear.
I:10370;278;I should also mention, great parseltongue scene with Harry and the snake.
I:10370;279;This film is much better than the first.
I:10370;280;Columbus really captures the dark, evil shadow that lurks over Hogwarts this year.
I:10370;281;Although Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's (Philosipher's [UK]) Stone was an excellent debut for the Harry Potter film series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets really builds on the continuing plot between Harry and Voldemort.
I:10370;282;The Chamber of Secrets provides an excellent base for this kind of evil to come and the triumphs and lessons to be learned.
I:10370;283;The video transfer is exceptional as well, as good or better than the previous release.
I:10370;284;In fact, I thought they provided more depth and I found myself enjoying the film more than previous viewings.
I:10370;285;It's nice that you are given the option of choosing between the two versions of the film.
I:10370;286;The other added benefit of this ultimate edition release is the documentary.
I:10370;287;The second part of the documentary is fantastic and more than what I was expecting.
I:10370;288;Excellent release and well worth the cost!
I:10370;289;I received the prouduct in excellent condition very quickly.
I:10370;290;She get's to watch the movie after she has read the book!
I:10370;291;I'd say this movie is one of the top movies of the year.
I:10370;292;It is better than the first.
I:10370;293;She is hot AND SEXY.
I:10370;294;My favorite part is THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS!
I:10370;295;Harry's second year at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry is filled with mystery, laughter, mischief, danger, and of course magic.
I:10370;296;first I'll start with the acting.
I:10370;297;You can see much more confidence in Harry this time around.
I:10370;298;All of the adult actors once again do great.
I:10370;299;the special effects are also much better this time.
I:10370;300;Quidditch is more realistic and Dobby doesn't seem fake and isn't annoying.
I:10370;301;In my opinoin the monster of the Chamber of the Secrets, is by far the best effect in the movie.
I:10370;302;in conclusion this movie is awsome!
I:10370;303;The music is also very good.
I:10370;304;This movie is a must see!
I:10370;305;this was a christmas gift.
I:10370;306;It's hp for goodness sakes.
I:10370;307;it can't be said enough that the casting of these movies is masterful.
I:10370;308;He is masterful as Snape.
I:10370;309;it was a pleasure to see that Rickman was not the only wonderful cast member to return.
I:10370;310;The actors do a wonderful job of really inhabiting their characters and the child actors have grown since the previous movie.
I:10370;311;The fact that they're the same actors helps maintain the continuity that is so important to the HP works as a whole.
I:10370;312;another very strong point of this movie was Dobby, a character I loved in the books.
I:10370;313;In spite of his odd and rather ugly appearance, there is something sweet and endearing about him.
I:10370;314;"His voice was wonderful too and it was such a treat to see him move from the page and into ""real"" life."
I:10370;315;jason Isaacs is another welcome addition to the cast of characters and he infuses Lucius Malfoy with cold, elegant menace.
I:10370;316;Isaacs really made the character come to life for me.Yet in spite of all this, what I sorely missed in this movie was the delicious humor that permeated nearly every page of the book.
I:10370;317;I felt that this did the story a disservice as humor so often proves such a saving grace in Harry's world.
I:10370;318;But still a great movie and enjoyable to watch.
I:10370;319;This is a great version of this movie, and I would say it is needed for any collection.
I:10370;320;They can produce the lumos charm.
I:10370;321;"It seems like in a lot of scenes they do stuff the ""muggle"" way."
I:10370;322;I gave this film 2 stars because the story is really good (but that is because of JK Rowling) and it may be fun for your child.
I:10370;323;This movie will keep you intrigued as well as amazed with new characters like Moaning Myrtle, with disappearances and students turned to stone!
I:10370;324;A must see movie for all ages.
I:10370;325;Chris Columbus hit a home run with this sequel, to what should become one of the greatest movie franchises of all time.
I:10370;326;I'm 29 and i enjoyed this movie alot.
I:10370;327;I remember when this movie came out that I liked it even more than the first.
I:10370;328;My children loved it and can't wait to read more of the books.
I:10370;329;That's the best complement for a book addaptation that I can think of.
I:10370;330;It's good to know that some companies do in fact listen to customer feedback.
I:10370;331;the film itself is rather well done.
I:10370;332;While it's no replacement for reading the book, it's still a lot of fun.
I:10370;333;There are a lot more scary moments than the first film, but most children over 5 won't really mind.
I:10370;334;The cast interviews are entertaining.
I:10370;335;The children have very childlike responses, and the adults are more insightful.
I:10370;336;The tours of the sets are very enjoyable and quite relaxed.
I:10370;337;There's a concept design gallery with some fantastic pieces of art.
I:10370;338;A simple quiz on the movie, some games and little bits of fun like a customizable photo slideshow.
I:10370;339;Kids will have fun with the toys and games and the voice activation.
I:10370;340;I bought this Harry Potter movie at a used but playable disc and at a great price.
I:10370;341;I would recommend this movie (and price) to my friends and family.
I:10370;342;I like to read and i found these books interesting, when i found out they were coming out with Harry Potter movies i was pissed because i didnt want them to ruin the book, well they didnt and it was cool seeing something youve read.
I:10370;343;Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is the type of movie that will be around forever.
I:10370;344;So far the two Harry Potter movies have been excellent movies in which spirit of the books by JK Rowling has been captured and expanded upon.
I:10370;345;magical and the other being a witch or wizard) leads to a very unstable environment at Hogwarts.
I:10370;346;directed by Chris Columbus and written by Steve Kloves this movie packed with the details that Rowling weaves throughout her book.
I:10370;347;The score by John Williams is excellent and well suited to the movie.
I:10370;348;Roger Pratt's cinematography is amazing.
I:10370;349;There is flashback to an earlier time at Hogwarts by way of a magical Diary that is brilliantly lit and shot in a sepia tone that looks just like the color of old paper.
I:10370;350;kenneth Branagh gives a great performance that should have gotten more attention at award time.
I:10370;351;His costuming and look are very well matched with that of Draco Malfoy, a nemesis of Harry's.
I:10370;352;Shirley Henderson as a ghost is also very good and steals her scenes.
I:10370;353;Returnees Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, and in particular the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore are very good.
I:10370;354;Christian Coulson does a good job as the mysterious Tom Riddle.
I:10370;355;daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) are very good in this movie and have their characters down.
I:10370;356;Watson in particular is excellent.
I:10370;357;harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets in an underrated movie that is a must see.
I:10370;358;still this movie has parts that is fun too see.
I:10370;359;The spell effects are awesome.
I:10370;360;The basilisk is definitely the coolest creature ever!
I:10370;361;The giant spider Aragon (Sorry, can't spell for my life) is very neat too.
I:10370;362;all in all, I found this a great movie with plenty of action, a dash of mystery, great actors and actresses who make the movie seem real, and neat special effects that don't look phony.
I:10370;363;They're a joy to see.
I:10370;364;also enjoyable is the interview with Chris Colombus and J. k. Rowling.
I:10370;365;as for the movie itself, well it's SO much better than the first one.
I:10370;366;The kids are much more comfortable in their roles and therefore pull you in t the story that much more.
I:10370;367;I had higher expectations since I liked the first one so much.
I:10370;368;It's not my favorite (GOF), but it's amazing compared to the first movie.
I:10370;369;This series just gets better and better as the story continues.
I:10370;370;it can be a bit of a challenge.
I:10370;371;The Chamber of Secrets is such fun for us true Harry Potter fans.
I:10370;372;A great book comes to the screen without the movie makers changing the story into something else entirely.
I:10370;373;And happily, the younger cast members are picking up the excellent craftsmanship of their stellar elders (Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, etal).
I:10370;374;Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) is so much more relaxed and natural this time out and both Rupert Grint and Emma Watson remain absolutely wonderful as Ron and Hermione.
I:10370;375;i think that a successful project is often realized in the details.
I:10370;376;And beautiful care has been taken in making Harry's world perfect, right down to the smallest details.
I:10370;377;He is just so perfectly over the top .
I:10370;378;There are lots of really cute extra scene clips and the tour of Dumbledore's office was sharp, clear and far superior to those on the Sorcerer's Stone features disk.
I:10370;379;rOM features but even without any of those I still give 5 stars and a big thumbs up to Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets.
I:10370;380;She loves all the movies and books and this is one of her favorites.
I:10370;381;The additional scenes are great and the interviews and segments on how scenes were made are wonderful.
I:10370;382;He loved it!I wish the author would produce a second series .
I:10370;383;maybe next generation to keep the story alive!
I:10370;384;The movie is great I've seen it many times and love it!
I:10370;385;i recommend the movie but make sure you get it from a reliable source.
I:10370;386;I bought this because I already have the full.
I:10370;387;awesome the person i bought it for still loves it the shipping was fast the product was safe it was great
I:10370;388;I loved the innocence of Harry and Ron and the way that they are friends with Hermione.
I:10370;389;Just a great movie for all young and old!Harry gets help in going back to school although a house elf named Dobby doesn't want him to.
I:10370;390;As he knows that Harry is in great danger!
I:10370;391;which is cool shown on screen.
I:10370;392;full of action and fantasy.
I:10370;393;And if you haven't read the book and loved the first movie I think you will be happy with one as it give you insight into Harry and will help with future books and movies.
I:10370;394;I love Daniel Radcliffe in this movie (ofcourse I love him in every movie that he's in).
I:10370;395;I think it had some surprising parts, and a couple of scary parts.
I:10370;396;It's just amazing to see the HP cast grow up so quickly.
I:10370;397;Great price and it was TIME!!
I:10370;398;All we had was, GASP, a VHS of this classic!
I:10370;399;This will make a great stocking stuffer!
I:10370;400;Then you will enjoy this film.
I:10370;401;All the actors that come from the first film, return in the second installenet of the highly popular Harry Potter series.
I:10370;402;Actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and even Tom Felton seem much more at ease in this film.
I:10370;403;"A more exciting Quidditch match and a scene in which students are learning to ""duel"", makes this film a bit more scary and still fun for its viewers."
I:10370;404;Chamber of Secrets has many wonderful special effects, lots of magic (of course) and some pretty decent story telling.
I:10370;405;These are relatively minor flaws, however, and overall I found the movie to be most enjoyable.
I:10370;406;"old states ""this is the best movie I've ever seen in my life and I vow to never like any of the others as much as this one."""
I:10370;407;This is a very nice movie.
I:10370;408;the actors were really great too, and there's somthing good about all of them.
I:10370;409;Harry was heroic, Dumbledore was sweet, Hermione was cute, Ron was funny, Snape was cool and Malfoy was annoying(that's a good thing!)
I:10370;410;Ron and Hermione were great characters from the get go in the first one .
I:10370;411;The film leaves out some things (like the ghost party) but in essence it captures the magic of the book wonderfully and is a sheer joy to watch.
I:10370;412;Although we all loved the first movie in this series, this second movie has a tighter feel.
I:10370;413;The cast really pulls together and seems to find their niche in this film and the special effects, as always, are incredible.
I:10370;414;This second movie will make more sense if you know the background behind the characters and the game of Quiditch.
I:10370;415;the movie does come in a clever little box with some cards, nice if your a harry potter collector.
I:10370;416;For lovers of the book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is yet another wonderful adaptation true to Rowling's text.
I:10370;417;pushing Gilderoy Lockhart, the fantastic climax in the Chamber, the encounter with the Whomping Willow, and our introduction to the sinister Lucius Malfoy, who makes his son Draco look like a kitten in contrast.
I:10370;418;Daniel Radcliffe seems right at home portraying everyone's favorite little wizard.
I:10370;419;Emma Watson's Hermione is beautiful, intelligent, and a joy to watch.
I:10370;420;The film builds to an intense climax with a shocking conclusion and leaves you breathless for the next movie adaptation and the joys it will behold for the faithful fan.
I:10370;421;There are several cast interviews, an interesting documentary on how the films are made, and a great interview with the screenwriter and J. k. Rowling herself.
I:10370;422;Overall it's a great disk of an even better story.
I:10370;423;The actors, the sets and the story are just tops.
I:10370;424;A film that adults can enjoy as much as children.
I:10370;425;A fun sequel to the first, this one continues to show the main characters and their growth in magic and friendship.
I:10370;426;The flashbacks, mysteries, and twists in the story make for a fun movie (especially for the first time and considering you've not read the books).
I:10370;427;I enjoyed the involvement of magical creatures, the introduction of new characters, and the fact the same actors/actresses are still here (nothing worse than someone else trying to pull off a character when you've already identified that character to someone else).
I:10370;428;Daniel Radcliffe continues to perfom even beter for this one.
I:10370;429;The flying car is a hero in it's own right.
I:10370;430;The Dragon is just as incredible as the treacherous spider.
I:10370;431;The special effects for Dobby were excellent!
I:10370;432;I recommend this movie to any Harry Potter fan.
I:10370;433;I bought the movie because we are big Harry Potter fanatics.
I:10370;434;I recommend this movie to anyone who ever read the Harry Potter series, especially if you grew up with the series.
I:10370;435;In fact, Daniel Radclife (Harry) won a contest for being the most 'Harry.
I:10370;436;I'd love to see them!
I:10370;437;I like all of them and would recommend them to everyone.
I:10370;438;The film, directed by Chris Columbus and written by Steve Kloves, is excellent.
I:10370;439;One of the suspects is being Harry Potter himself!ACTING: The acting performances by the entire cast is truly superb.
I:10370;440;The actors are starting to develop more into their characters, and I think they are starting to get used to the story.
I:10370;441;The young child stars (Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint) seem to have more confidence with their roles, and they do not seem as stiff as in the first film.
I:10370;442;It's just that the special effects LOOKED better, especially during the Chamber sequence.
I:10370;443;Now that's some superb special effects!OVERALL THOUGHTS: I really enjoyed this second installment almost as much as I love the books.
I:10370;444;I've never read any of the books but I thought the first movie was better.
I:10370;445;Well, scary it can get.
I:10370;446;the whole basilisk sequence is definitely not for people who get nervous around snakes, and don't even *consider* watching if, like Ron Weasley, you're afraid of spiders!
I:10370;447;Yet in the end this film, like its predecessor, reaffirms plenty of positive values.
I:10370;448;courage, selflessness, quick thinking, honesty, loyalty.
I:10370;449;"the young stars are even better this time out than they were in their first outing
I:10370;450;The special effects are, if anything, even better than they were in the first movie.
I:10370;451;that basilisk is worth the price in himself, not to mention a flying car, Dobby the house.
I:10370;452;elf, and a second chilling Quidditch match.
I:10370;453;"there's never a moment of boredom.You will want to think twice before letting very young or sensitive children view ""Chamber of Secrets,"" but for all the rest of the 90% or so of the known world that's ""just wild about Harry,"" this is a must."
I:10370;454;this was a great film and the effects were stunning and beautiful.
I:10370;455;Great movie to watch with your kids.
I:10370;456;The special effects are great and the storyline adheres closely to the books.
I:10370;457;So I wanted a new one.
I:10370;458;I am ridiculously pleased that it came sealed and in fantastic condition.
I:10370;459;This was one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen.
I:10370;460;the acors and actresses were great, and the special effects were extremely realistic.
I:10370;461;Overall, the movie was brilliant!
I:10370;462;After receiving this item I was very pleased.
I:10370;463;It comes to you as if it was brand new.
I:10370;464;Very pleased will order again especially from the particular seller.
I:10370;465;everything about the Potter film adaptations improves in this sharp, well paced sequel to 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'.
I:10370;466;Radcliffe builds on his previous performance and reaches truly impressive heights as Harry.
I:10370;467;Emma Watson is impressive as always as Hermione.
I:10370;468;It's a tour de force of spellbinding special effects, fun turns from top notch British actors as Hogwarts employees and a cleverly plotted mystery that at once intrigues, excites and forwards our knowledge of Harry Potter's world.
I:10370;469;This film is surprisingly watchable at 160 minutes and definitely raises the stakes for the franchise, meeting the challenge on every level.
I:10370;470;This is, in some regards a kid's movie, but there is a lot going on to keep mature minds engaged .
I:10370;471;not the least that the film is genuinely scary .
I:10370;472;The most intriguing aspect of the film is the way it develops the depth of Harry's character sharpening our interest for future installments and the clever commentary on racism in the 'mugborn' subplot raises the themes in the whole series to a new level.
I:10370;473;In short, the ideal combination of J K Rowling and the filmmakers combine to produce an exciting and authentic translation of her novel.
I:10370;474;I'm guessing the one posted here is the last one, and it looks AWESOME!
I:10370;475;I think extending that scene will definetely have a good impact on viewers.
I:10370;476;Now, we're going to be getting in to the really good stuff.
I:10370;477;He's a great Fantasy director, and telling by an interview, very enthusiastic.
I:10370;478;I bought this and the first movie in the same series together!
I:10370;479;I hope these will continue to come out .
I:10370;480;This is one of my favorite movies.
I:10370;481;I always read the book to my class and then show the movie when we're done.
I:10370;482;OK i am the type of girl who likes action movies.
I:10370;483;Lord of the rings is my fav.
I:10370;484;Dang Orlando Bloom is hotter with green hair that harry with normal hair.
I:10370;485;This second film in the Harry Potter series is very good.
I:10370;486;The talented cast, consisting of newcomers as well as screen heavyweights, continued their effective performances from the previous film.
I:10370;487;Jason Isaacs is an excellent addition as the evil Lucious Malfoy.
I:10370;488;as good as this film is, I do not believe that it is as good as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
I:10370;489;You see, Chamber of Secrets definitely had more action.
I:10370;490;Chamber of Secrets is primarily an action film.
I:10370;491;Whereas the Sorcerer's Stone could arguable be considered a beautiful drama.
I:10370;492;there were some very subtle, but beautiful, memorable scenes from the Sorcerer's Stone.
I:10370;493;And really, all of the scenes involving the Mirror of Erised were quite touching.
I:10370;494;In my opinion, it is subtle, well.
I:10370;495;crafted scenes that separate the good movies from the greats.
I:10370;496;daniel Radcliffe's acting is really great to watch.
I:10370;497;He gives new meaning to subtle.
I:10370;498;His facial expressions, really his appearance and demeanor as Harry Potter is very believable as someone who has spent the first ten years of his life being the victim of neglect and emotional abuse.
I:10370;499;I'll probably always like the 1st HP movie best because of the innocence of the characters and sense of new wonder.
I:10370;500;But I still enjoy all the others and the Amazon Marketplace price was good for this Ultimate Edition 2 ($19.48 incl shpg).
I:10370;501;They are all so rich in details.
I:10370;502;I always notice something new every time I watch them.
I:10370;503;"I myself DO enjoy all the bonus featurettes ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"", this has Part 2: The Characters."
I:10370;504;I like the interviews and behind scenes productions that are put together in a way that's more than just an after thought to sell as a Bonus disc.
I:10370;505;Oh, one tip about Harry Potter movies.
I:10370;506;Good flick, looking forward to the rest of them.
I:10370;507;Now I get to experience the magic in great Blu.
I:10370;508;The extended editions are fantastic!
I:10370;509;Christopher Columbus was brilliant with the films and it's a shame the later directors didn't come back to take time to create extended editions of all the remaining films as well.
I:10370;510;It was great, a lot better than the first movie.
I:10370;511;But it was a great movie though it is 3 hours it is still good.
I:10370;512;I am enjoying this movie.
I:10370;513;I really enjoyed the interviews with the actors but wanted more!
I:10370;514;The interview with JK Rowling and Kloves (the screenwriter) was interesting as well.
I:10370;515;the interactive features, especially those of Dumbledore's Office and the tour of Diagon Alley, are absolutely awesome!
I:10370;516;That would be a real treat to learn more about the filming of the Harry Potter movies, but, alas, it is not a feature on this disc (again, that's something that is more adult.
I:10370;517;finally, my one HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT is in the Extra Credit feature.
I:10370;518;I put the second disc in and only got the same special features I got on my television (they looked great on computer though!!)
I:10370;519;It's amazing to see all of my favorite scenes brought to life with wonderful effects!
I:10370;520;The scenes with the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets was so real it was scary and the Polyjuice Potion effects were great!
I:10370;521;Though the new movie is a bit darker than the first it's much better in my opinion and a lot funnier as well.
I:10370;522;Not only is the movie better but the soundtrack is as well, along with much of the merchandise including the posters for the film.
I:10370;523;New characters are introduced played by well known actors (Kenneth Brannagh and Jason Isaacs) and the rest of the cast is still the same, bringing back the characters we've learned to love.
I:10370;524;So if this didn't make it clear, the new Harry Potter film is one of a kind and the best of the year, if not all around.
I:10370;525;He's told of this plot by a manic house.
I:10370;526;ron and his brothers take Harry to their small home in the English countryside, where Harry meets the rest of the Weasley family.
I:10370;527;The film is more selective in what content is included from the book, but overall it is a very successful adaptation.
I:10370;528;In many ways this film is superior to the first film.
I:10370;529;The special effects surpass those inHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stonein realism, detail, and style.
I:10370;530;the acting has also improved as can be seen in the children's performances.
I:10370;531;On a sad note, the brilliant actor Richard Harris, who plays Headmaster Dumbledore, passed away shortly after the film's completion.
I:10370;532;harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts tests his courage and his skills while showing viewers that greater challenges are to come.
I:10370;533;i also recommendthe superb soundtrack by John Williams.
I:10370;534;Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets is the second of the books to be made into a movie, and in my opinion is the best so far.
I:10370;535;it's more moving and more special than the first film, and much better acted.
I:10370;536;Thanks to Daniel Radcliff and the gang for another year at Hogwards
I:10370;537;In this, the second instalment in the wonderful series, we see Harry return to Hogwarts after getting rescued from his prison by Ron and his brothers.
I:10370;538;He is introduced to new teachers, has trouble with Malfoy again, learns more about himself and faces rejection, along.
I:10370;539;Harry's second year at Hogwarts is full of adventure, action, triumph, mystery, and happiness.
I:10370;540;This is an excellent movie and I highly recommend it.
I:10370;541;It is overall an excellent movie and is sure to entertain fans of all ages.
I:10370;542;The two disc set has a great deal to offer and has many gems contained within.
I:10370;543;Disc 2 has many features to behold.
I:10370;544;The additional scenes are a real treat to have available and are great to view.
I:10370;545;This is a nice treat, and quite interesting to see.
I:10370;546;In the Spellcaster Knowledge, one is able to test their memory skills and see how well they know the magic spells from the movie.
I:10370;547;Gilderoy Lockhart's Classroom is a nice little area where you can learn a lot more about the new teacher at Hogwarts.
I:10370;548;In Behind Hogwarts, a wonderful insightful interview is available with the author of Harry Potter and Steve Kloves ( Conversation with J. k. Rowling. )
I:10370;549;Interviews With The Students, Professors and More is a nice little feature where we get insight from some of actors involved.
I:10370;550;The production sketches are a sight to behold and even been able to choose between buidling a scene or taking a tour of Dumbledore's Office are both great features that are fun to work with.
I:10370;551;Collin's Darkroom is a nice feature where you can make up a slide.
I:10370;552;The Forbidden Forest Challenge is a nice little game that sees you trying to escape from the forest itself.
I:10370;553;This a fun great game that has you answer trivia questions that relate to the movie to see you progress through the Chamber to the end and defeat the Basilisk.
I:10370;554;The movie itself is excellent and highly enjoyable, and the bonus features that go along with it are amazing and are sure to keep you occupied for hours.
I:10370;555;"It's not ""Lord Of The Rings,"" of course, but it's still decent entertainment, even for us older folks."
I:10370;556;It got even better with the third installment, which has been my personal favorite of the lot.
I:10370;557;effects are fun to watch and it was interesting to see how the three young stars .
I:10370;558;budget films, the visuals, the special.
I:10370;559;It's definitely entertaining for all ages with no worries about language, and the Blu.
I:10370;560;The transfers on all of them, from what I've seen and read, are fantastic.
I:10370;561;This second Harry Potter outing is an overall better film than the first.
I:10370;562;Rowling's 2nd book is smoother and more cohesive, and this comes through in Kloves's screenplay.
I:10370;563;Finally, the new characters, including a scenery.
I:10370;564;I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan or anything, but I really enjoyed the first movie.
I:10370;565;Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining enough for one, maybe two viewings.
I:10370;566;And I'm sure it's as fascinating for kids as the Wizard of Oz was for me.
I:10370;567;Anyway, I am a BIG Harry Potter fan, so I enjoy this movie no matter what.
I:10370;568;Anyone who is a fan of Harry Potter in general and Harry Potter movies in particular will love this set.
I:10370;569;There's so much extra material that you'll need a special movie night to watch it all.
I:10370;570;Having the choice of the theatrical version or the extended cut is wonderful as well.
I:10370;571;if you're interested enough in Harry Potter to check this out then I believe you could do no better than to get this set.
I:10370;572;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) is an excellent follow.
I:10370;573;up to a great film.
I:10370;574;It's fun and more entertaining than the original!The film stars Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint (whose voices have lowered since the last film) and Emma Watson.
I:10370;575;Many familiar characters return and a handful of new ones appear for the first time.
I:10370;576;Kenneth Branagh is especially funny as the egotistical Professor Lockhart.
I:10370;577;the story continues and is more engaging.
I:10370;578;It is very good entertainment!
I:10370;579;The pace, action, and acting are interesting only to those with less than sophisticated tastes.
I:10370;580;I liked this film better than the first.
I:10370;581;I think what I enjoyed most about this film is that it captures much more of the story than the first film did.
I:10370;582;"Mostly because it only has two new characters to introduce
I:10370;583;Although, the interview with JK and the script writer was fun.
I:10370;584;so I give the film 4.5 stars and the discs about 3.5 stars for the lack of any really interesting extras except the deleted scenes.
I:10370;585;This was a great movie, more suspense, less childish, Dan radcliffe did a good performance as did the late great Richard Harris, and emma watson is simply adorable as hermoine in the film.
I:10370;586;I love all the Harry Potter books.
I:10370;587;The movie is true to the second book and surpasses the effects of the first one.
I:10370;588;Granted this is still completely appropriate for most kids, but the movie succeeded in grabbing my attention, and keeping me glued while the mystery surrounding the Chamber of Secrets was unraveled.
I:10370;589;The first movie was great, but this movie surpasses it on many levels.
I:10370;590;my only complaint is that two of my favorite characters, Herminie, and Hagwit (I don't know how to spell their names) were both seriously under used.
I:10370;591;I would liked to have seen Herminie have a more prominate role in this film, but I was also grateful to see Ron have a more prominate role in the film, and even some actual heroism on the part of Mr. Potter himself.
I:10370;592;Seeing Harry actually fighting, using spells himself, rather than being reliant on the aid of others proved to me that Harry is indeed worthy of the hero status that had been placed on him, rather than just a poor little rich kid with all the right resources, and amazing side kicks to do all the work for him that some sudden critics have been claiming him to be.
I:10370;593;This is what has been done with the Harry Potter adaptations so far and the results are wonders to behold.
I:10370;594;chamber of Secrets may be even better than Sorcerer's Stone.
I:10370;595;The first film was the introduction, this film provides a very solid plot, even as we meet new characters, some of whom will only be in this film (Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Instructor, is a safe revelation.
I:10370;596;Others are welcome returns, especially Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid.
I:10370;597;The actors seem to have settled into their roles very comfortably and deliver strong performances throughout.
I:10370;598;Chamber of Secrets reveals a treasure of enjoymentAll right, I've finally seen it on opening day, and my verdict that it would be the best film of the year has proved accurate.
I:10370;599;Ms. Norris, caretaker Argus Filch's cat, is found petrified.
I:10370;600;And Hermione more than ever proves to be a valuable linchpin of support via magical knowhow.
I:10370;601;Daniel Radcliffe in particular is more confident than ever without losing that enthusiastic smile (50 pts).
I:10370;602;Emma Watson once again takes top honours as Hermione, prettier and more self.
I:10370;603;assured than ever (70 pts).
I:10370;604;Tip to Warner Bros: treat her like royalty.
I:10370;605;Darker will definitely apply to the third film.
I:10370;606;Not only does it show that sequels can equal or top the originals, but it is a worthy and heartfelt eulogy to Richard Harris, whose last film this was (extra 50 pts).
I:10370;607;The question now is, like the first movie, how many times will I see this gem of a movie over and over again?Rating: 1,100 pts out of 1,000.
I:10370;608;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets struck me as a significantly better movie than the first Harry Potter film.
I:10370;609;The first movie was thrilling, giving us the first look with the naked eye of the setting already firmly lodged in the imaginative minds of Rowling's readers, but the fact that audiences are now quite familiar with both Hogwarts and the colorful characters who reside there allows for the plot to exert greater control over everything that happens.
I:10370;610;Just as Rowling's writing draws you in to Harry Potter's world, so does this movie.
I:10370;611;The late Richard Harris is once again the perfect Dumbledore, Professor Snape is even more Snape.
I:10370;612;Along with all of the beloved characters we already know and love (or hate), a new set of important personages now enters Harry's world.
I:10370;613;The conceited egomaniac Professor Lockhart is a fascinating, albeit increasingly annoying, wizard, while Dobby the house elf is a well.
I:10370;614;animated, exceedingly sympathetic little guy who never fails to liven up the action around him.
I:10370;615;Important storylines for both now and the future begin to emerge, helping to pave the way for successive films.
I:10370;616;The special effects are really well done indeed, the music works perfectly, and the movie succeeds admirably in following the storyline of the book on which it is based.
I:10370;617;I would imagine that young readers are particularly fond of this film, as its variety of special effects, from the flying car to the increasingly exciting action above the Quidditch field to the amazing effects of drinking Polyjuice Potion, offers a lot of delightfully memorable moments.
I:10370;618;"You don't have to jump through hoops to see all of the deleted scenes, there is a fun and informative look at the making of the movie
I:10370;619;rOM features, offer both adults and children a fun and easy way to linger in Harry's world for some time rather than leave immediately upon viewing the movie.
I:10370;620;Quite simply, this is just a great film.
I:10370;621;Watching these movies with my children for the first time (their first time) after we finish the books has been a magical experience in real life.
I:10370;622;The extended scenes gave me something new to enjoy.
I:10370;623;watch these as a family.
I:10370;624;great movie long but good.
I:10370;625;i love harry potter movies!!
I:10370;626;I am a huge harry potter fan, and loved this movie!
I:10370;627;There was much more action and it was funnier too!
I:10370;628;Ron was so funny as usual.
I:10370;629;The Chamber of Secrets was a great scene, so was the quidditch scene and a lot more.
I:10370;630;I loved this movie and hope you do too!
I:10370;631;I enjoyed this installment in the HP series better than the first.
I:10370;632;I found the characters and the plot more developed.
I:10370;633;capture something that worked in the first film.
I:10370;634;Instead this film builds on the first.
I:10370;635;It will be interesting to see how the future installments are condensed.
I:10370;636;finally I found some of the heightened suspense and dark elements of the film a bit too scary for kids.
I:10370;637;successful book series, and before you start bashing me for the two.
I:10370;638;star review, just let me say that I love the books.
I:10370;639;I was loving it until about an hour in.
I:10370;640;on the plus side, the effects are MUCH better than last time.
I:10370;641;The performances are great, like last time, especially Emma Watson (Hermione), and the wonderfully expressive Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley).
I:10370;642;Durring Harry's adventures back at Hoggwarts School, he and his two best friends, Ron and Hermonie, learn to do their magic from the school teacher.
I:10370;643;the third movie of Harry Potter, will come to theatres one day.
I:10370;644;The elder cast is still perfect for their respective roles and Kenneth Branagh is excellent as the ego.
I:10370;645;"The first movie ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" made a bucket load of cash for Warner Bros. and established itself as an even bigger franchise for motion pictures than the series of books had for the world of literature."
I:10370;646;A mere twelve months later and the whole gang came back for more of the same brand of excitement and childlike wonder that made the first movie such a treat.
I:10370;647;"The second chapter in the Potter series therefore is able to jump straight into the action, and action is something the movie certainly provides from a nerve wrenching, white knuckle quidditch game to a battle royal at the end between Harry and a giant monster, this movie never seems to stop moving.Yes, the truth be told ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is a far superior movie to its earlier incarnation."
I:10370;648;I have never read the books, but one can only guess that J. k. Rowling's confidence and skill had markedly improved following the success of her first novel.
I:10370;649;This adventure really seems to have some solid plotting behind it, with not only an intriguing and compelling mystery but also a more sinister and satisfying villain.
I:10370;650;J. K. Rowling's imaginitive 2nd volume is very nicely adapted to the big screen.
I:10370;651;Although it has a running time of 2 hours and 40 minutes, this film flies by with a good story that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I:10370;652;Among the new additions is Kenneth Branaugh, who wonderfully succeeds as the new, narcisstic Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart.
I:10370;653;The kids seem more comfortable in their roles and do very well.
I:10370;654;There are plenty of magical creatures to keep you interested.
I:10370;655;If you are a Potter fan you are definitely gonna enjoy this film.
I:10370;656;And even if you haven't read the book, this film will appeal to you.
I:10370;657;Neither the game, the photo galeries, or the self guided tour were much fun.
I:10370;658;Much better than the first.
I:10370;659;'The acting is great, (only one I didn't like was the gardener).
I:10370;660;What else can i say that the harry potter movies are great.
I:10370;661;This is a wonderful film that introduces several great new characters, such as the conceited and comical Guilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branaugh) and the evil Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), as well as boasting terrific visual effects and costume design.
I:10370;662;The respect paid to the source material really shows on the screen.
I:10370;663;And of course I was the first one in line to see it.
I:10370;664;first of all, movie was very closely kept to the book just like the first one, for which I must give thumbs up to the filmmakers.
I:10370;665;Kenneth Branagh did an amazing job delivering his character.
I:10370;666;forth, visual presentation of this movie is immaculate.
I:10370;667;Special effects are incredibly well incorporated with real characters.
I:10370;668;It is an amazing story and it was presented in an amazing way.
I:10370;669;the action scenes can be a little intense for younger viewers, but still will be timeless in its direction and pure enjoyment level.
I:10370;670;The second disc contains 19 extra cut secenes, and interviews with the cast and author.
I:10370;671;i highly enjoyed this movie, and look forward to seeing it again.
I:10370;672;this feature was acceptable as a sequel.
I:10370;673;Ditto with the scenes in Lockheart's classrom, the students gossiping about Harry's ability to speak with snakes, the discussion of the diary and the mystery of its blank pages, and so on.
I:10370;674;the jury's still out on whether this is great literature or not, much less great movie.
I:10370;675;the kids are growing up.
I:10370;676;Chamber of Secres is my favorite among the Harry Potter books but I had mixed feelings about the film version.
I:10370;677;The special effects are eye popping and the pace is amazing for a film over 2 1/2 hours long.
I:10370;678;The actors, young and old, do a fine acting job and this is a good final bow for great British actor Richard Harris as Dumbledore.
I:10370;679;Rowlings is devious in her plotting and great with red herrings but she does play fair.
I:10370;680;in the Chris Columbus film there are important characters and plot elements that are shown once and do not recur until the very end.
I:10370;681;The adult characters in particular, mostly excellent British actors, seem to be having cameo roles when they play more important roles in the book (although Kenneth Branaugh is a wonderfully self centered Lockhart).
I:10370;682;the result is a film that hits the important plot elements of the story but builds up little suspense or mystery.
I:10370;683;Highly recommended for any HP fan's collection.
I:10370;684;New in wrapper, with all the bells and whistles.
I:10370;685;Great for any Harry lover, and a must have for Christmas.
I:10370;686;You don't necessarily have to see the first movie to enjoy this sequel, but it helps in order to get the full scope of the relationships between the characters.
I:10370;687;hour plot is packed with suspense and mystery as Harry and his friends discover the truth about the Chamber of Secrets.
I:10370;688;As with the first movie, the cast did a wonderful performance.
I:10370;689;"Manning another successful effort on the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, Chris Columbus' direction, Roger Pratt's cinematography, and Steve Kloves' screenplay combine to provide viewers with masterful onscreen storytelling."
I:10370;690;Harry's abilities with Parseltongue make students eye him suspiciously after a class discussion on the topic.
I:10370;691;The ghost Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson) also provides them with clues, as do Hermione's notes.
I:10370;692;all will end happily for those who deserve such an end.
I:10370;693;considerate Harry repays Dobby for his kindness, putting the elf's master in his place.
I:10370;694;like the best of any group of friends, they play to each other's strengths, compensate for each other's weaknesses, and have an alliance of honest love, affection, and humor, and especially due to their youth and impishness, are always amusing to watch, even in the darkest moments.
I:10370;695;as what will be an eventual journey of blood, sweat, and tears for Hogwarts main troublemakers and troubleshooters begins in earnest, we feel can always feel confident that the best will always happen for them.
I:10370;696;I truly enjoy Harry Potter and I just returned home from the cinema.
I:10370;697;the movie is very good.
I:10370;698;all of the actors did their job exceedingly well, the scenes were stunning .
I:10370;699;Okay the film runs a solid 150 minutes and that is a lot for a movie in today's cinema, but it makes me worry what will happen to book 4 when the film comes rolling around.
I:10370;700;They chopped some things out of book 1 and I still felt it was easily recognizable.
I:10370;701;The sets looked nice and the visuals were fairly well done.
I:10370;702;The whole film was actually very good, accept for the end.
I:10370;703;I have enjoyed all movies and this was no exception.
I:10370;704;Really enjoy they stay true to the book series as much as possible.
I:10370;705;creative creatures added in to make it try to seem original.
I:10370;706;harry potter is a funny, action, and edge of seat movie that keeps u wondering til the very end!
I:10370;707;Bro in law is a big sci.
I:10370;708;I love the movie, just didn't like the whole transaction.
I:10370;709;the second entry adapted from J. k Rowling's legacy has neither the epic sweep of the fourth book (The Goblet of fire) nor the mystery of the third (The Prisoner of Azkaban) but is nonetheless an engaging adventure and a riveting story.
I:10370;710;What's more with director Chris Colombus at the helm who shows more precision and familiarity after his first attempt, Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets is a majestic adventure filled with visionary sets and fluid CGI effects that astonishingly enhance the darker fantasy tale and adventure.
I:10370;711;The soaring adventure thrills with its enshrouding perils, awesome moments of wonder and enlightening morality and friendship.
I:10370;712;The new interlopers are equally scene.
I:10370;713;with a solidly ensembled cast and sumptuous sets, the second installment is fascinatingly entertaining as it is enchanting enough to sustain its 3 long hours without any misgivings.
I:10370;714;The scenes in this book are awesome, bringing to life the unique world of HP.2.
I:10370;715;including a brief synopsis of Year one, spellcasting, extra scenes etc3.
I:10370;716;but as always, the book is better.
I:10370;717;This is a fantastic movie, full of creativity and adventure!
I:10370;718;The Harry Potter series is absolutely one of the greatest stories ever written and movies ever made!
I:10370;719;My eight year old grandson and I enjoyed every minute of this although he liked the spiders better than I did.
I:10370;720;Why else would I give it such a great rating.
I:10370;721;The movie, is fun and exciting, as is to be expected.
I:10370;722;It made a good gift for two little boys who enjoyed the fim.
I:10370;723;"The last HP Movie ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" was a marvelous adaptation of J. k. Rowling's first Harry Potter book and was hard to pull off onto the big screen but it was almost completely successful and truly amazing."
I:10370;724;"up ""Chamber Of Secrets"" is even better, longer, darker, and more suspenseful than the first one."
I:10370;725;"This is one of the best examples of the ""Sequel Upswing""."
I:10370;726;Director Chris Columbus truly brings out the magic of Harry Potter onto the big screen and maintains the faith and magic of Rowling's novels.
I:10370;727;There are some occasional humor jokes scattered throughout an other dark movie.
I:10370;728;He's one of my favorite characters and he should've been given a much larger role in COS.
I:10370;729;There are lots of them in the movie and it will creep the living daylights out of those who have revulsion towards snakes.
I:10370;730;'Snake Lovers' though like most people, will definitely enjoy this movie a lot.
I:10370;731;There are also quite a good number of spiders in the movie too.
I:10370;732;crawly animals so there you have it.
I:10370;733;I actually enjoy the spiders but let's not warp the subject of this review though.
I:10370;734;In fact, the creepier feel of this movie makes it even more entertaining than the previous Harry Potter movie.
I:10370;735;The choreography is once again astonishing.
I:10370;736;popping and was great to watch instead of being cheesy and silly.
I:10370;737;I think that's one of the best made up words of all time.
I:10370;738;"Overall, I have to say that ""The Chamber Of Secrets"" is a successful achievement and builds upon the success and greatness of ""Sorcerer's Stone"", resulting in a near."
I:10370;739;masterpiece if not an epic one.
I:10370;740;"despite the frightening and darker tone of ""The Chamber Of Secrets"" and the bumbling of Gilderoy Lockheart, it is a fascinating and astonishing achievement in adapting Rowling's second novel to the big screen and is destined to become another classic in the years to come."
I:10370;741;This movie picks up where the last one left off and is filled with great special effects, interesting characters and great pacing and suspense.
I:10370;742;A must see for children and young adults.
I:10370;743;I finally got the version of the 2nd Harry potter I always wanted.
I:10370;744;I have always thought that most of the Harry Potter movies could and should always be a little longer.
I:10370;745;this movie, even though I thoroughly bash it above, was a huge improvement from the first, and I am anticipating the next installment.
I:10370;746;The special effects are wonderful, I didn't think they would pull that off, and the plot provided by J. k. Rowling's books are superb.
I:10370;747;For those who would've liked Sorcerer's Stone had some aspects improved, they should go see Chamber of Secrets because those things have probably been improved.
I:10370;748;**I hope you found this review helpful**
I:10370;749;I thought it was so well done.
I:10370;750;All the actors were great and well chosen.
I:10370;751;Bet anyways this movie definately was magical!
I:10370;752;Because this sequel was loads better than both the original and Lord of the Rings.
I:10370;753;Each books significantly improves over the last.
I:10370;754;"film wise, ""Chamber of Secrets"" stands above its competators for family films (and fantasy films) in several ways."
I:10370;755;"Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have greatly improved since ""Sorceror's Stone"", so much so that their acting doesn't fault once."
I:10370;756;For such fresh actors, they actually managed to add depth to their characters, something Vin Diesel has yet to achieve.
I:10370;757;, although I wish the basilisk has moved a little better.
I:10370;758;There are some scene that were actually, I thought, improved upon from the book.
I:10370;759;They do, of course, [shine in] every scene they're in.
I:10370;760;Also, why is it that Quidditch is more fun to read about than it is to watch?
I:10370;761;"despite these minor faults, ""Chamber of Secrets"" is still an excellent movie."
I:10370;762;It looks to be well worth picking up.
I:10370;763;the Harry Potter series is one of the best fantasy series in print and a decent film adaptation.
I:10370;764;The thrilling plot and climax keep you on the edge of your seat, even after you have read the book!!
I:10370;765;Daniel Radcliffe gives an excellent portrayl of Harry Potter, as do the other actors and actresses.
I:10370;766;Even if you aren't a big fan, you should still view the movie as it has amazing technology advances, an exciting plot and climax, and excellent actors.
I:10370;767;I would have to say this 2nd feature in the series is much prefered and more enjoyable than the 1st.
I:10370;768;One reason for this, i believe is the 2nd feature gets to skip all the explanatory and expository stuff in the 1st and jumps right into the storyline.
I:10370;769;Their actor counterparts will be the biggest surprise, with the boys already sporting much lower voices and taller heights.
I:10370;770;deliciously played by Jason Isaacs (you may remember him as Mel Gibson's opponent in The Patriot).
I:10370;771;His son, Draco, returns as well, up to his usual no good ways of insulting Harry and his friends.
I:10370;772;"the story behind ""you know who"" continues in this film."
I:10370;773;The Chamber of Secrets is the newest mystery at Hogwarts, and the biggest threat at present.
I:10370;774;Aside from the chamber plot, there is a lot of fun in this film, including a lot of action and a lot of humor .
I:10370;775;a huge improvement over the first film.
I:10370;776;Even the special effects have easily tripled in effectiveness, especially an intense scene of Quidditch and the very scary and amazing climactic showdown of the film .
I:10370;777;easily better than the climax of the prior movie as well.
I:10370;778;overall, Chamber is much edgier, darker, scarier, and intriguing than the first Potter film.
I:10370;779;This is easily one of my favorite films of the series to date, mostly because it has come so far as a sequal.
I:10370;780;We enjoyed all the Harry Potter books!
I:10370;781;The following is on this gift set.
I:10370;782;I love all of the Harry Potter movies.
I:10370;783;One of the greatest movies ever!
I:10370;784;My entire family loves Harry Potter!
I:10370;785;Very happy to get this movie.
I:10370;786;It goes great with my collection.
I:10370;787;And now he is pretty well settled to begin afresh on a new adventure.
I:10370;788;Another remarkable moment occurred when their adventures lead them into the enchanted forest, followng clues by a vision, deep into a cave to speak with a huge spider creature, a wise monster indeed, who would not allow them to leave without providing sustainance for his young: I cannot deny them fresh meat which comes so willingly into our midst.
I:10370;789;And the chase is on.
I:10370;790;"poseur opportunist par excellance, which does speak to the faux magician type who frequently takes credit for others' accomplishments, as well as natural occurrences
I:10370;791;he may fool the muggles, but a true Magician can spot this type outright.
I:10370;792;Viewing this film in the theatre is amusing for an entertaining night out , but I believe it would be far more appreciated in one's own Lair.
I:10370;793;Still, to experience this series to the fullest, the highest resommendation is to read the books themselves, and this the films will be far more vibrant.
I:10370;794;For it is known, that the slave.
I:10370;795;overall, if one has been well entertained by the premiere film Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone , then The Chambre of Secrets is well worth the watching.
I:10370;796;Harry Potter, while certainly the most controversial literary figure since Tom Sawyer, plays out beautifully on the screen, and I myself can't wait until the next movie in June, which promises to be even Darker and more suspenseful than this one!
I:10370;797;It certainly helps to have seen the first movie in the series, however, one can catch on pretty quickly with what is presented here.
I:10370;798;The acting is quite satisfactory, within the limits imposed by the many youths necessary in a film focused on the young.
I:10370;799;The older performers are mostly quite good without being allowed to overshadow the kids.
I:10370;800;As a matter of fact, one of the virtues of the film, compared to many with a child star (or stars), is that a balance is maintained so that the 'cute' young 'uns don't run away with the show.
I:10370;801;Between the celebrated, absurdly deep cast, the charming, nuanced world at large and the constant manipulations of a shadow.
I:10370;802;The CGI, though still not without the occasional hiccup, has vastly improved since the last picture.
I:10370;803;record audiences, and deservedly so.
I:10370;804;Besides a perfect cast, this magical movie blends humor and scares in a wholesome package that all ages can love.
I:10370;805;But here is one aimed at children that is just as exciting for anyone who loves escapist fare.
I:10370;806;As with the first movie, my favorite scenes are the scary ones in the forest.
I:10370;807;In the second film, Columbus uses the family situation to re.
I:10370;808;i still have too many other books to read to add the Potter books to my reading list, but I certainly look forward to the next movie, and suggest this movie for anyone of any age who wants an entertaining escape!
I:10370;809;excellent actors have mere seconds on the screen.
I:10370;810;It's also jarring to see how the child stars age between scenes and back again!Those are my biggest quibbles.
I:10370;811;I'm a newcomer, in terms of being a Harry Potter fan.
I:10370;812;Needless to say, I was very impressed with the first movie.
I:10370;813;now, I loved the second movie.
I:10370;814;i even bought it the day it came out.
I:10370;815;it has improved itself in every area, from character development, to cinematography, to and especially in special effects, the best in my opinion since Jurassic Park.
I:10370;816;I saw the first Harry Potter and absolutely love it.
I:10370;817;The Chamber of Secret was very good and better than the first one.
I:10370;818;The special effect in the movie has certain improve from the first movie.
I:10370;819;"I love the scene when Ron got the ""Howler"" letter from his mom."
I:10370;820;It is indeed a great film for all ages.
I:10370;821;But the actors being older and probally a little bit more like the character having pratice from the first one probally also made it enjoyable.
I:10370;822;There son Dudley is always picking on Harry.
I:10370;823;He goes to his classes and visits his friends.
I:10370;824;He also gets a new teacher.
I:10370;825;ENIEMIS OF THE HEIR BEWARE!
I:10370;826;the best part about the movie is the humor that is brought to the screen by Lockharts's character.
I:10370;827;In the end Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fun film that is much better then the first one in everyway.
I:10370;828;An early entry in the Harry Potter movies, still quite good and very watchable.
I:10370;829;The characters really are children in this film
I:10370;830;My six year old boy loved it.
I:10370;831;Kids found it enjoyable and laughed throughout the entire movie as the book they had just read came to life.
I:10370;832;It was just as much fun with my Grandson!
I:10370;833;I always love when movies come with all the extras, like behind the scenes, deleted scenes, etc.
I:10370;834;It's well worth the money.
I:10370;835;This sequel to 2001's Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone beats that one right to the curb in just about every way.
I:10370;836;The formerly clumsy Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint really improve their roles on this sequel and seal their places in this movie series.
I:10370;837;it all begins after another awful summer at the Dursley's household where an elf named Dobby warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts for his second year but he ignores Dobby and goes right back to Hogwarts for his second year there.
I:10370;838;this mvoie is a lot better and more entertaining than the first HP movie.
I:10370;839;The extras are absolutely worth it.
I:10370;840;we are yoked into believing that because it's Harry Potter it's going to be good.
I:10370;841;I am such a huge fan of the book series, and naturally the books are usually better than the films, but [this] compared to the book, was a true washout.
I:10370;842;Personally I find Branagh a superb method actor, he played a fine Hamlet and his movies are very thoughtout and distinctive, however the miscast here is evident, as he was unmoving, and commonplace.
I:10370;843;Columbus does a good job again.
I:10370;844;This movie is full of magical fun for the whole family.
I:10370;845;It's a fine movie, lots of action and excitment, but I prefer the book.
I:10370;846;I love the special effects in Harry Potter and of course Daniel Radcliff brings our the sympathy in everyone.
I:10370;847;Surprisingly, I enjoyed The Chamber of Secrets more than the first one.
I:10370;848;I especially enjoyed Gilderoy Lockart, an insufferable Defense Against the Dark Arts professor who is completely in love with himself.
I:10370;849;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best movies I've ever watched!
I:10370;850;The other sequels are just as amazing as the first!
I:10370;851;Like the first one, very well done.
I:10370;852;I love magic, what more can I say.
I:10370;853;The second installment in the Harry Potter series has some fun moments.
I:10370;854;I love the character of Gilderoy Lockhart.
I:10370;855;He's well played and adds humor to the movie.
I:10370;856;Hagrid's character also gets some more development.
I:10370;857;"blood Prince"" as my least favorite in the series."
I:10370;858;Every single deatail from the Dursleys to Dobby to Gilderoy Lockhart to The Flying Car to Moaning Myrtle to Tom Riddle's Diary to Aragog to The Basilik are completly amazing and just how I pictured them when I read the book.
I:10370;859;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Book 2)is one of the best books I ever read, and this movie is one of the best that I've ever seen!
I:10370;860;It gets you hooked instatly.
I:10370;861;This is GREAT for mystery lovers.
I:10370;862;During his second year there, someone has opened The Chamber Of Secrets, and has released a great evil that is turning the students to stone!
I:10370;863;We enjoyed the extra scenes included in this extended version!
I:10370;864;Several were very short, but they were delightful.
I:10370;865;Movie in itself was fabulous, in fact I own it.
I:10370;866;Movie by itself great, movie compared to book not so great
I:10370;867;I love the movie it is really good and almost finishes my Harry Potter movie collection and I really enjoy the movies
I:10370;868;Now years later, Harry Potter bursts onto the scene and its a great series of movies to sit down and watch with kids.
I:10370;869;It actually has great lessons in the film plus its a lot of fun.
I:10370;870;Harry Potter is a likable kids and so are his friends and teachers.
I:10370;871;matches and the special effects are still first class.
I:10370;872;I actually do think that this film encourages kids to read.
I:10370;873;I never knew anything about Harry Potter before I saw this movie, and I was hooked by the end.
I:10370;874;Now I'm a huge HP fan.
I:10370;875;and now, after watching the first movie as well, this one was even more incredible than the wonderful first one, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
I:10370;876;I have to say, wow, did those kids grow!
I:10370;877;And my, has their acting improved.
I:10370;878;I have never seen young kids perform so good in my life.
I:10370;879;They truly made the Chamber of Secrets a real gem.
I:10370;880;what I loved about the movie is how they stuck true to the novel.
I:10370;881;the special effects were great (as you would expect).
I:10370;882;The quidditch scene was one of my favorites.
I:10370;883;, bolder, and better in every way.
I:10370;884;One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time.You don't have to be 12 to love Potter!
I:10370;885;I give it to 2 thumbs up and definitely recommend adding it to your collection.
I:10370;886;Better direction, much, much better visual effects, better storytelling (since the book developed more exciting, compelling plots and the kids are bigger and wiser), great performances by all characters (you can see much improvement from the kids who play Harry, Ron, and Hermione, not forgetting the tension between 2 of them which should and MUST be developed more in the next installments!!)
I:10370;887;"kids and adults alike
I:10370;888;crawlies, and what have you, all in ONE movie!)
I:10370;889;edge kinda feel (the unforgettable flying car scene, the heart.
I:10370;890;I enjoyed the first movie very much and now I am delighted with the second movie aswell.
I:10370;891;the acting is better in this film, and it seems a fair bit more action packed.
I:10370;892;They both go together perfectly as a duo and it is geniusness in film making.
I:10370;893;anyone is recommended to this brilliance.
I:10370;894;These special edition movies are amazing.
I:10370;895;as in the first movie, the director shows us the same visions that we experienced reading the book.
I:10370;896;brillant script and extraordinary special effects are the main atracctions.
I:10370;897;two thumbs up to this beautiful movie.
I:10370;898;My 7 year old loves all these movies.
I:10370;899;It has been fun to see my child comprehend what he has been hearing to what he is seeing.
I:10370;900;Did I mention the movie is great?
I:10370;901;The first disk is dedicated to the movie, though it does have a nice summary of the first movie, in case you missed it.
I:10370;902;The movie is great, by the way.
I:10370;903;There are plenty of extras to keep you, or your kids, enthralled for hours.
I:10370;904;For those who don't know, he played a fairly important role in the second book.
I:10370;905;If you know nothing except what you learned from the first movie, or if you've never seen it, this movie provides a clear enough plot.
I:10370;906;oh yeah, it's a great movie, but not as good as the firt.
I:10370;907;Although the novelty of the wizard school has worn off, the sequal still made me feel inquisitive with it's various twists and turns.
I:10370;908;The cast is excellent .
I:10370;909;Kenneth Branagh plays a very humorous Gilderoy Lockhart.
I:10370;910;generated effects and characters really enhance the experience, but the plot is what carries the movie.
I:10370;911;I find this film quite interesting.
I:10370;912;You is when Harry realizes truly that you is him a true Griffindor, to the power to draw the sword of that great magician that has the name of your house that remained in the hat selector.
I:10370;913;i recommend you this movie you is an important part for the other movies that they come next.
I:10370;914;"This is good for the new widescreen tvs, but, this also cheats you out of this movies' integrety
I:10370;915;For purists, it's fine for the new television monitors and tvs, but I would prefer the full top to bottom view of the actors and things that they are holding and the hand movements.
I:10370;916;minute film looks great, as in theaters, with medieval ambers and black.
I:10370;917;Skin tones are especially pleasing.
I:10370;918;the Dolby Digital 5.1 EX mix comes in English and Spanish, crisply delivering the high.
I:10370;919;Phoenix rises above that, providing direct access to 19 outtakes.
I:10370;920;I just steal her best stuff, Kloves says.
I:10370;921;And I don't sue, Rowlings shoots right back.
I:10370;922;"the classy featurette ""Setting the Scene"" gives youngsters a proper lesson in the logistics of filmmaking (""It starts with a script ."")"
I:10370;923;The docu covers cinematography, sets, costumes, visual effects and other detail rarely found in extras for young people.
I:10370;924;The featurette should be required viewing in middle schools across the Potter kingdom.
I:10370;925;like visit to the Forbidden Forest and a maze that rewards victors with an interactive tour of the Chamber of Secrets.
I:10370;926;It's very rare to find a film that equals its predecessor, in a series.
I:10370;927;The acting is still perfect, in my opinion.
I:10370;928;It's also nice to see the additions for the actors.
I:10370;929;Moaning Myrtle is funny, by anyone's standards.
I:10370;930;The quidditch sequence is also exciting and visually stunning.
I:10370;931;It's also nice to see some character development.
I:10370;932;The scene after Malfoy calls her Mudblood and Hagrid comforts her is touching and well acted.
I:10370;933;It's good that we see more of Malfoy, as well.
I:10370;934;Ron's arachnaphobia is quite amusing, however it's a laugh out loud when he encounters spiders that are bigger than Harry.
I:10370;935;It's also nice that Hagrid is proven innocent.
I:10370;936;If this sounds good, it is.
I:10370;937;I give this film my highest recommendation.
I:10370;938;I recommend you watch it.
I:10370;939;It's definitely a film worth seeing!
I:10370;940;The Harry Potter movies and books were a great way for my kids and I to share something together and now that they are starting to have kids of there own I look forward to share them again with my grandchildren.
I:10370;941;Wonderful job J. k. Rowling.
I:10370;942;Particularly when that narrative is as complex as the Harry Potter world.
I:10370;943;I have yet to see a movie type realize that the is a profit to be turned with this thought.
I:10370;944;The problem is that the story belongs to J. K. Rowling, and is a classic example of why writers don't like their babies being raped by some film school emotional cripple.
I:10370;945;Now it's just icing on the cake to be able to see it on Blu.
I:10370;946;If you have the right set up then you are in for a treat.
I:10370;947;Took me a while to get to it, but certainly understand all the excitement about the series now.
I:10370;948;A great read, i would recommend for kids 9+
I:10370;949;Of course, the first Harry Potter movie was a cinematic achievement, but the second one is a great movie.
I:10370;950;In between is the actual movie, of course.
I:10370;951;The Chamber of Secrets is darker then the first movie, but that's what makes it good.
I:10370;952;"As each Harry Potter book comes out, it gets better and better, but in ""the Chamber of Secrets"" you also meet several new characters and learn more about Voldemort's past."
I:10370;953;Two of the best characters you meet are Moaing Myrtle and Tom Riddle.
I:10370;954;And then he learns of the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.
I:10370;955;The visual effects are stunning, especially the Dueling Club scene.
I:10370;956;The characters are brilliantly protrayed and the movie keeps the mysterious way about it that the book had.
I:10370;957;"The best things about ""the Chamber of Secrets"" is how much more insight you gain on Voldemort's past."
I:10370;958;Plus, you also get to see Ron's home.
I:10370;959;the movie is very new and very general.
I:10370;960;It gives you a sense of this constantly continuing series.
I:10370;961;are found turned to stone!As in the original, the emphasis here is on bringing J. k. Rowland's detail to the screen, and by and large director Chris Columbus and his special effects staff are very successful: the flying car, the whomping willow, the spiders of the dark wood, and the deadly creature that has escaped from the Chamber of Secrets are all well visualized.
I:10370;962;As noted earlier, the three juvenile leads (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) are much smoother in their performances, and they are solidly backed by a host of returning cast members including the late Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and Maggie Smith.
I:10370;963;it's all a tremendous amount of fun, and I recommend it.
I:10370;964;I enjoyed this movie and it is such a great adaptation from the book.
I:10370;965;This movie is even great for friends or family.
I:10370;966;It is also one of those movies you can watch over and over again.
I:10370;967;Though I prefer the first film, it's still good to watch.
I:10370;968;it's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) second year at Hogwart's wizards school, and after a shaky summer, he returns to find himself in the midst of a sinister plot.
I:10370;969;There's a couple of new kids, (like Colin Creevey) and they are just as well cast as the others.
I:10370;970;The new adults are well cast too.
I:10370;971;He played it a lot more subtley than I expected him to.
I:10370;972;fast Show comedian Mark Williams plays Mr Weasley, which I reckon was a great choice.
I:10370;973;There's also a trivia game about what spell does what too.
I:10370;974;Just as well, there's 19 of them, and some of them are pretty significant.
I:10370;975;That was some mighty fine character development cut there!
I:10370;976;all in all, its definitely worth a look for Harry Potter fans, but I would recommend you read the book first.
I:10370;977;This is such a great movie.
I:10370;978;But I do have to say that I liked the first installment in the Harry Potter series better.
I:10370;979;The books are just so spectacular!
I:10370;980;I will definitely read the 5th one as soon as it comes out.
I:10370;981;Nonetheless, this movie is still worth checking out, as it is a very nice representation of the books (without comparing them) and are a great experience of the book (again no comparing) without having to read it again.
I:10370;982;I would still recommend reading the book first because the books are so exciting that all the movie does is give away the ending and all the exciting parts!
I:10370;983;I do think that the special effects are better in this one than the first one, but I still liked the first one better.
I:10370;984;Maybe it's just cuz I'm scared of spiders, but anyway, I recommend checking it out, also.
I:10370;985;I saw it and I thought it was fantastic!
I:10370;986;If you read the book you will like it.
I:10370;987;I have really enjoyed both of the new Ultimate Editions.
I:10370;988;The added scenes really help the flow of the stories.
I:10370;989;It really looks nice, too and I've saved the trading cards for my children.
I:10370;990;When I went to go see this movie.
I:10370;991;The best part is when he writes in the book and the book answers him, I still love that.
I:10370;992;I had never read the books before seeing Sorcerer's Stone and liking it so much, I read the rest in the series.
I:10370;993;All I can say is, CoS is definitely full of action and adventure, but little else.
I:10370;994;made and the hilarious Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, very well acted by Kenneth Branagh.
I:10370;995;The special effects were well.
I:10370;996;I studded loved this story behind me back to by childhood.
I:10370;997;Will good again defeat evil?Naturally, you don't have to be a genius to answer the questions.
I:10370;998;We are introduced to new characters.
I:10370;999;Ron Weasley and family, Hermoine Granger, Hagrid, and the magnificent Professor Dumbledorf.
I:10370;1000;As such, I feel **** stars is proper.
I:10370;1001;Big fan of Harry Potter.
I:10370;1002;Big fan of the movies.
I:10370;1003;The trio is growing up.
I:10370;1004;And so are their acting skills.
I:10370;1005;I loved the ending with the.
I:10370;1006;He seems to be delighted and thrilled with the storyline which pleases us to no end.
I:10370;1007;something the entire family might enjoy on various levels.
I:10370;1008;THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS has even better special effects than the first film, and the child actors seem more comfortable in their roles.
I:10370;1009;And the distinguished adult cast members are all fine, and look as though they're having a ball.
I:10370;1010;They're not the most amazing examples of cinematography but they're meaningful for all the right reasons.
I:10370;1011;"up to ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone"" works better in every way than its predecessor."
I:10370;1012;A deeper story which introduces extremely compelling characters and storylines, this movie really begins the push toward maturity that defines the series' overall trajectory.
I:10370;1013;The character is given a brilliant human backstory through the discovery of a magical diary which mysteriously leads Harry on a quest to do battle with(SPOILER)the malevolent memory of Voldemort's human self.
I:10370;1014;returning actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint must carry an even meatier story on this second film, and their performances grow as surely as themselves.
I:10370;1015;Each actor is able to convey a wide range of emotions, but it's Radcliffe who truly owns Harry Potter with his performance here.
I:10370;1016;assurance and talent to the role worthy of actors two and three times his age.
I:10370;1017;In the final performance of his life, Richard Harris is subdued yet gently authoritative as Albus Dumbledore.
I:10370;1018;Mr. Issacs in particular is superbly cold.
I:10370;1019;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a promising second chapter in arguably the most creative fantasy movie series of all time.
I:10370;1020;I was first in line to see this movie the day it came out, and I saw it multiple times after.
I:10370;1021;"This movie rates #1 on my list along with ""The Sorceror's Stone"" and the Lord of the Rings movies!"
I:10370;1022;This version of the film included both the theatrical and extended versions of the movie, including some very important additional scenes.
I:10370;1023;Being an older adult, I was surprised how much I enjoyed these movies.
I:10370;1024;Again, having the ability to watch these Videos on Demand from Amazon at the simple touch of a finger is wonderful!
I:10370;1025;My kids loved it and enjoyable to me too.
I:10370;1026;Very good family movie and was both fun and exciting to everyone.
I:10370;1027;I will admit, this is definitely a darker story, it's a great script, well done acting from the children (got to give credit to Rupert Grint as Ron), and slick special effects, the effects are less exposing then the first movie.
I:10370;1028;Even though some scenes are little too short or too long to understand, this is a wonderful movie, and worth watching.
I:10370;1029;It's cute, entertaining, and fun.
I:10370;1030;Great for the whole family.
I:10370;1031;The fitted the characters so well.
I:10370;1032;I hope that Chris Columbus makes the other movies even more suspenseful and inspiring then the others.
I:10370;1033;up artists and espiacally the visual effects artists make the movie look real and you actually feel like you know the characters.
I:10370;1034;They did an excellent job of makeing it so much like the novel!
I:10370;1035;this is an awesome movie.
I:10370;1036;So take my advice and see it over and over again because every time you see it, it gets better and better.
I:10370;1037;After the first one worked out so well I had to get the 2nd Ultimate Edition.
I:10370;1038;Creating the World of Harry Potter Part 2 Covers characters and one of the best extras so far.
I:10370;1039;Highly recommend for any Harry Potter Fan.
I:10370;1040;If you are just someone who only cares about the movie and nothing else then this would probably be a waste, but this product is to appeal highly to hardcore, collector, and all other Harry Potter fans who simply love the franchise.
I:10370;1041;I love all the Harry Potter books.
I:10370;1042;they are so good written hat you cant let it go.
I:10370;1043;All HP movies are good!!
I:10370;1044;Good entertainment for the whole family two thumbs up !!!
I:10370;1045;This is the second Harry Potter movie and another winner!
I:10370;1046;This movie is suspenseful, a comedy, and full of drama.
I:10370;1047;And if you are the movie are great!
I:10370;1048;The story is exciting and there are a lot of action and suspense.
I:10370;1049;The actors act very well particularly Rupert Grint.
I:10370;1050;the movie is better than the one.
I:10370;1051;And let me say It was brilliant!
I:10370;1052;My friends and I are still talking about it and we saw it almost 1 month ago.
I:10370;1053;While this book was my least favorite of the first 3, somehow, this movie was brilliant.
I:10370;1054;Dooby was brilliantly created and is like a cute version of the evil Golem.
I:10370;1055;Dobby was wonderfully brought to life.
I:10370;1056;Once again, the movie had great acting, not by Daniel Radcliffe especially but by the wonderful Alan Rickman.
I:10370;1057;this movie is simply an excellent family movie.
I:10370;1058;It's great fun and turns a solid but average book somehow into an excellent family movie.
I:10370;1059;So, enjoy yourselves kids, because this is going to be the best Harry Potter movie of the franchise, period.
I:10370;1060;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a great movie and the fact that it has like 13 min of extra scenes added into it makes it even better!
I:10370;1061;"The Chamber of secrets is truly an amazing movie
I:10370;1062;the film is so wonderful because it is really in the spirit of Harry Potter.
I:10370;1063;we see characters become more viable and real in this second film.
I:10370;1064;The kids are growing up, and it shows.
I:10370;1065;I feel that this is entirely appropriate for the feel of the film, since a large part of the books revolves around typical growing pains that we all go through.
I:10370;1066;In the movie she has black hair.
I:10370;1067;the rest in my opinion was pretty good but not great.
I:10370;1068;I saw it twice opening day.
I:10370;1069;There was more action and it was hilarious.
I:10370;1070;Rupert Grint (Ron) is a funny kid.
I:10370;1071;The movie had me on the edge of my seat for the entire length of the film.
I:10370;1072;Last year amid the hoopla of the release of Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone, movie goers forgot what made the books wonderful and clamored for a visual representation of a book they had grew to love.
I:10370;1073;The spirit is intact this time around with Harry having a much darker and more intense adventure.
I:10370;1074;at the other end of the wand though is a great mystery adventure that is in.
I:10370;1075;line with the great Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew stories that non.
I:10370;1076;Plus it helps that the cast is so terrific.
I:10370;1077;Daniel Radcliffe improves himself and expands the character of Harry Potter.
I:10370;1078;Emma Watson is superb as Hermione and Rupert Grint is just hilarious as Ron Weasley.
I:10370;1079;The rest of the original cast is back as well with another quirky yet humorous portrayal of Snape.
I:10370;1080;The events that happen are not worthy of J. k. Rowling's books or of this fun and entertaining film.
I:10370;1081;but I liked this film.
I:10370;1082;"Once it escapes this ""dungeon"" that it has found itself in and manages to get to the meat of the film, it's pretty darned good."
I:10370;1083;in this installment the filmmakers actually manage to create a sense of danger and suspense.
I:10370;1084;Every actor in this film seems to have become more comfortable with their work in this installment.
I:10370;1085;Daniel Radcliffe's performance (and his much deeper voice which gave me a chuckle or two) is much more.
I:10370;1086;mature, Rupert Grint (while still kind of a whiner) has at least two moments of actual backbone, and Emma Watson also has some genuinely interesting moments.
I:10370;1087;all in all a really good film.
I:10370;1088;"Since I cant really put my joy of this movie into words, I'm just going to do a ""Quikie"" review:The Good:1."
I:10370;1089;This sequence alone is worth the admission price2.
I:10370;1090;The acting: Harry, Ron, Herminoe, Hagrid and all the charachters are very well done.
I:10370;1091;The film might seem a bit rushed, but it is still excellent.2.
I:10370;1092;summary: A better, more action packed sequel.
I:10370;1093;This is the great all.
I:10370;1094;Phase One, in which Doris gets her oats.
I:10370;1095;Alan Rickman swoons with delight.
I:10370;1096;All is well, as Lord Frank DeVoldemort is defeated by My Three Sons.
I:10370;1097;As an avid Harry Potter ADDICT, I thought this movie was truly.
I:10370;1098;I thought Chris Columbus did an outstanding job trying to stay as close to the books as possible.
I:10370;1099;This movie is definetly more entertaining than the 1st only because the actors have developed as well, actors.
I:10370;1100;But in this, they looked like they knew what they were talking about, and knew how to make it work, and i'm very proud of them.
I:10370;1101;They have the opportunity to be able to portray characters that are loved all over the world, and they're making good use of it.
I:10370;1102;I thought this movie was one of the greatest I've ever seen.
I:10370;1103;loved book to the screen, there are certain risks that must be taken and sacrifices to be made.
I:10370;1104;If that book happens to be the second installment of a best.
I:10370;1105;"After the smash success of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" on film, the second book was made into a movie."
I:10370;1106;"The biggest plus in the Harry Potter series has to do with casting
I:10370;1107;It's wonderful to see everyone back, from the main cast (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint) to the supporting characters (Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltraine, Tom Felton).
I:10370;1108;And it's bittersweet to see Richard Harris in one of his final roles as the beloved Albus Dumbledore.
I:10370;1109;"i was also impressed with how well certain scenes from the book played out
I:10370;1110;done, and much of it did occur as I had imagined.
I:10370;1111;"The book is brilliant in that it slowly builds the intensity level to the final battle
I:10370;1112;As the second movie, however, this one still had elements of the greatness that was the first blush of the whole Harry Potter phenomenon, and is worth getting from that standpoint.
I:10370;1113;but you have to be willing to let something go and enjoy it for what it is.
I:10370;1114;I found that the actors are starting to get a little better, and fairly faithful to the book.
I:10370;1115;Not as good as the first one but it's still great and is the best film of the year.
I:10370;1116;The acting is great and the story is great it's more suspensfull, scary and mature then the first.
I:10370;1117;The movie will have you on the edge of your seat espesially when harry is int he Chamber of secrets.
I:10370;1118;The movie is so great words can hardly describe it.
I:10370;1119;He is still living with the Dursley's and his Aunt (Fiona Shaw), Uncle (Richard Griffiths) and Cousin (Harry Melling) are still mean to him.
I:10370;1120;His Uncle Vernon wants him to be very quiet while they have company and no magic stuff.
I:10370;1121;disc One: Cast and Crew, Year One At Hogwart's, Theatrical Trailer.
I:10370;1122;Director Chris Columbus has again captured the core meaning of one of the Potter Books
I:10370;1123;The Chamber of Secrets is a excellent representation of the novel.
I:10370;1124;The cast is made of the same delightful kids that made the first movie such fun.
I:10370;1125;i would judge the novel as the weakest of the series, but still it is a lot of fun.
I:10370;1126;The four stars I give the movie would be the compromise of 5 stars for acting and presentation of a 3 star book.
I:10370;1127;ages movie well worth adding to a home library.
I:10370;1128;This was an excellent movie based on the neovel.
I:10370;1129;Wonderful movie with some very talented actors I give it a 10.
I:10370;1130;It is an integral part of the whole series
I:10370;1131;I am delighted with my four disc ultimate edition set of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
I:10370;1132;i love the extras and the extended version of the movies.
I:10370;1133;It's a great show with so much wizardry and fun.
I:10370;1134;Has the whole set now and will have Harry Potter.
I:10370;1135;The first two movies are very enjoyable of the Harry Potter series, one to watch with the older kids.
I:10370;1136;man and the second biggest take of the year worldwide, trailing only behind The Lord of the Rings .
I:10370;1137;It was refreshing to walk into Chamber of Secrets and see the same cast members returning for their roles.
I:10370;1138;It's great to see a production of this magnitude attract such talent.
I:10370;1139;In this case it's not just a matter of star power, as the big names that have made their way through Potter are real acting heavyweights, and their presence certainly adds to the realism of the films.
I:10370;1140;Although the ending of the first film had moments where you could possibly wonder about the fates of our heroes, this film makes that feeling palpable.
I:10370;1141;Columbus has definitely captured more of the feel of this book as he allows its teeth to show.
I:10370;1142;He's still young here, though, and his understanding of character dynamics will grow with age.
I:10370;1143;chamber of Secrets is definitely an improvement over its predecessor, and it also shows definite growth in subject matter from Philosopher's Stone.
I:10370;1144;That's definitely one of the greatest strengths to how this series has been approached to avoid a sense of stagnation.
I:10370;1145;It was a fun movie to watch!
I:10370;1146;This sequel is a great follow up to the first movie, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
I:10370;1147;I would definitely recommend watching!
I:10370;1148;My biggest fear going in was that Daniel Radcliffe had gotten too old to be any good in the role, but he still shines.
I:10370;1149;outstanding final performance for richard harris.
I:10370;1150;This is such a great story and as the collection continues to grow so the does the fun involved with it.
I:10370;1151;Other than that it is a great movie.
I:10370;1152;Shipping from the U. k. was excellent.
I:10370;1153;Okay this movie is a must see.
I:10370;1154;JK's imagination combined with high.
I:10370;1155;budget effects certainly made the experience magical.
I:10370;1156;It followed the book fairly well, and while they did have to add lines, and take out some, they really did well on it.
I:10370;1157;I thought it was better than the first one, even though I love the first one too.
I:10370;1158;I think Daniel Radcliffe makes a great Harry Potter, and the actors for Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and many other important characters are excellent as well.
I:10370;1159;The special effects were really cool, especially in the Chamber of Secrets!
I:10370;1160;However it is good, I liked the magic in it all.
I:10370;1161;I love the fiction about it and it was something that I would want to see any other movies that are made.
I:10370;1162;I have the first one which was so good, I had to get the second one.
I:10370;1163;The movie is true to the book, but there is so much more in the book.
I:10370;1164;For Harry Potter fans, this continues the story and develops the characters more.
I:10370;1165;The movie did an excellent job telling a story and at the same time introducing all the characters.
I:10370;1166;The story is wonderful, the acting is superb, especially Daniel Radcliffe, and the effects and sets are absolutely mezmerizing.
I:10370;1167;Both young and old will love this sequel that is even better than the original!
I:10370;1168;This Harry Potter installment has more story, more intrigue.
I:10370;1169;"The conflict Harry has concerning his ""true nature"" is very effective."
I:10370;1170;the young actors all give fine performances, and the special effects are top notch.
I:10370;1171;it is interesting to see the character growth of the actor's, plus their own growth in real time.
I:10370;1172;And Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are once again great, but I wish they had more screen time.
I:10370;1173;There are 19 additional scenes.
I:10370;1174;Behind the Hogwarts has an interview with JK Rowling and screenwriter Steven Kloves.
I:10370;1175;"Also, there is ""Dumbledore's Office"" which has the making of Dumbledore's office and the greenhouse scene, and a tour of the office."
I:10370;1176;The making of the office was a great docu with alot of wow moments on how they put everything together.
I:10370;1177;I wish Isaac's, Rickman's and Coltrane's were longer, as they are genuine funny people.
I:10370;1178;If you are a Harry Potter fan, or know one I recommend you collect the entire collection of ultimate editions.
I:10370;1179;I have and I love them all!
I:10370;1180;"I enjoy story 
I:10370;1181;While it is funny and light.
I:10370;1182;it is nice to see how the young actors have developed their roles, although Ron's (Rupert Grint) slightly overdone comedic style would perhaps be more suited to stage performance.
I:10370;1183;The real stars of the film however, are not the actors, but the wonderful and intricately detailed sets.
I:10370;1184;From Hogwarts' gothic cathedral, to the glorious muddle of the Weasley household (complete with self.
I:10370;1185;I recommend this a must for any Harry Potter fan.
I:10370;1186;Better graphics, better acting, new characters and old rivalry.
I:10370;1187;It provides hours of fun( literally!)
I:10370;1188;I thought that I should see The Chamber of Secrets at least once in theaters because the Quidditch scenes would look amazing on a bigger screen.
I:10370;1189;The acting is very well done and the special effects are amazing.
I:10370;1190;"When my son and I watch these it brings us back to when he called me mommy and made me watch it repeatedly until he learned all the ""spells""."
I:10370;1191;I was actually engaged and enjoyed watching it with my son.
I:10370;1192;My daughter needed this for her collection and she was very happy to get this for Christmas.
I:10370;1193;A great sequel to the first film.
I:10370;1194;The actors are much more confident in their roles and the performances of Rupert Grint (Ron), Emma Watson (Hermoine), Alan Rickman (Prof. Snape), and Jason Issacs (Lucius Malfoy) were particullary excellent.
I:10370;1195;paced and fun the rest of it was.
I:10370;1196;A must for anyone, Potter follower or not!
I:10370;1197;Hi I belevive that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets will be one of the best movies in the world!!
I:10370;1198;My friends and I have read all the books and one of us even saw the movie!!
I:10370;1199;Ha ha any ways I loved the first one and this one is suposed to be much better!!!!
I:10370;1200;As a Potter fan I was happy to discover that the deleted scenes were included on the blu.
I:10370;1201;Harry Potter movies are excellent.
I:10370;1202;I enjoyed it in the theater, and it made a good gift for my sister, but personally, I'd just get it from the library instead of paying for it.
I:10370;1203;I gave this movie as a Christmas present to a best friend of mine.
I:10370;1204;He liked the first two (2) movies because Harry Potter was young.
I:10370;1205;The first two movie were great!
I:10370;1206;I love all of these movies.
I:10370;1207;This is probably the last in the series that you can watch with small children, as the rest of the movies get more mature.
I:10370;1208;Harry Potter books are much better than the movies.
I:10370;1209;Good for casual viewing when you don't want to be in a heavy flick but drawn into escape without a horrid bloodbath.
I:10370;1210;developed script and characters carrying storyline smoothly.
I:10370;1211;That is satisfying in and of itself, isn't it!
I:10370;1212;This movie does the book justice and is a great fun experience.
I:10370;1213;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a sequel that's actually superior to the original.
I:10370;1214;well how this a good adaption then ?
I:10370;1215;The scene where Harry discovers he speaks a snake language will just send chills up your spine, it's simply great.
I:10370;1216;Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) improved a lot as an actor and it shows a lot in this film.
I:10370;1217;The other cast members a good as well.
I:10370;1218;The late great Richard Harris pulls out a last fine performance as Dumbledore.
I:10370;1219;Well anyway Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fun film, so fun you sit there for 2 1/2 hours without even realizing it was that long.
I:10370;1220;It really is worth seeing, it packs so much in one movie.
I:10370;1221;You got the exciting Quidetch match from the book, giant spiders, a magical Diary that writes back and other great imagitive things.
I:10370;1222;The sound is great as you would expect, there is the widescreen feature(of course).
I:10370;1223;:o) There are 2 discs, with wonderful interviews with the principle actors, lots of neat additional info to checkout using the interactive screens which the kids will enjoy also.
I:10370;1224;mainly in being exciting and engaging all the way through.
I:10370;1225;don't get me wrong, I love the Harry Potter books.
I:10370;1226;And I thought the first movie did an OK job of bringing Harry to the big screen, but it didn't feel quite right.
I:10370;1227;Fortunately for us HP2 is much better in this regard.
I:10370;1228;If you liked the 1st film, you'll love this one, specially the 19 deleted scenes!With a tighter plot, incredible special efects, even better acting from Daniel, Rupert and Emma, and wonderful new characters, this is by far much better than the first movie!A must have for every HP fan!
I:10370;1229;If you are a Harry Potter fan than this movie is a must.
I:10370;1230;A film by Chris ColumbusThis is the second Harry Potter film and is the sequel to 2001's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone .
I:10370;1231;Like the first film, this one is also based on the book of the same title by J. k. Rowling.
I:10370;1232;Also like the first film, this movie adaptation is faithful to the novel.
I:10370;1233;But this is the set up and lets us know from the start that something is going, and we just don't know what it is yet.
I:10370;1234;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was just as good as the first movie, and has a similar feel to it (which makes sense since both films have the same director).
I:10370;1235;It was an enjoyable movie, if a little long for children's movie.
I:10370;1236;The novels have such a fast paced, wonderful tone that the movies simply cannot recreate.
I:10370;1237;I absolutely love the Harry Potter book series and this edition of the second movie is wonderful!
I:10370;1238;Great bonus features and book.
I:10370;1239;The first was notable for how well it succeeded in this respect.
I:10370;1240;the magical effects are wonderful.
I:10370;1241;So too is much of the cheeky repartee.
I:10370;1242;While this one can be suitable to people of all ages, some of it may be a bit intense for the youngest of viewers.
I:10370;1243;I do, but managed to enjoy the film anyway.
I:10370;1244;Another great addition to the Harry Potter series of movies.
I:10370;1245;Kenneth Branagh is fun to watch as the ego.
I:10370;1246;this is a good movie I am an adult but the kid in me loves it.
I:10370;1247;great for the kids too of course.
I:10370;1248;Please continue with this great Harry Potter series.
I:10370;1249;I AM also seeing The Prisoner of Azkaban this weekend!
I:10370;1250;Not as awe inspiring as the first film, the introduction to the Potter mythos, this film returns to that world decently.
I:10370;1251;It's quite startling watching the second film then checking out the `Hogwarts First Year' section and seeing them much younger.
I:10370;1252;a superb second installment of a fantastic fantasy saga from Chris Columbus is quite faithful to the J. k. Rowling Book.
I:10370;1253;Here this installment improves over the first one with bigger pacing, more suspense and better storyline including some darkness abound as the series evolves into a bigger adventure series then ever.
I:10370;1254;This one is full of mystery and puzzles to be solved.
I:10370;1255;While I would recommend this to all ages, I would also classify it more of a kids/family movie.
I:10370;1256;This movie was enjoyed more than the first movie.
I:10370;1257;"With ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" the gifted, still.youthful director (the term ""Wunderkind"" continues to comes to mind) silences his stupid idiot critics and proves that he is a major creative force to be reckoned with and not some ""studio hack,"" ""marked."
I:10370;1258;I have never had any interest to read a Harry Potter book, but for some reason I really enjoy the movies.
I:10370;1259;How the elf got his freedom at the end of the movie was pretty funny.
I:10370;1260;They loved it and it was a great price and fast delivery.
I:10370;1261;The magic continues in the newest film in the Harry Potter series.
I:10370;1262;this movie is definitley better than the first.
I:10370;1263;The characters are movie complex, the plot is darker, and the performances are more heartfelt.
I:10370;1264;They will also get to see a brilliant game of Quidditch, and even a little romance between Harry and Hermione.
I:10370;1265;this movie truly lives up to the first and is well worth the wait.
I:10370;1266;its amazing and its practically brand new and i love it !
I:10370;1267;:) thank you so much!
I:10370;1268;this is a great movie.
I:10370;1269;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is yet another live version of the books we love.
I:10370;1270;You can explore Diagon Alley, as well as other places, and watch the beloved movie!!!
I:10370;1271;Daniel Radcliffe once again strikes us as the heroic and perfect Harry Potter.
I:10370;1272;Rupert Grint stars as Ron Weasley, the funniest character (in my opinion) of the bunch, who delivers many laughs even when the group is in danger.
I:10370;1273;And Emma Watson delivers a perfect performance as Hermione Granger, the know.
I:10370;1274;born, and the students as well as the future of the school is in danger.
I:10370;1275;So he takes it into his own hands to solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets.
I:10370;1276;christopher Columbus does an excellent job yet again.
I:10370;1277;His Harry Potter and the chamber of Secrets movie was directed so well that you feel as if you are in the movie.
I:10370;1278;Great graphics, once again great music by John Williams, and great acting performances make this movie so great it'll take magic to make the next one, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, better than this.
I:10370;1279;"As an avid fan of the Harry Potter series of books and of the first installment in the film series, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" I give ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" a 9/10."
I:10370;1280;This is a good movie.
I:10370;1281;Likewise, it is interesting to note that most kids seem to like Chamber of Secrets better than Sorcerer's Stone.
I:10370;1282;The first movie was truly amazing as one watches for the first time a movie depiction of Hogwarts, the great hall, wizards chess, and of course Quidditch.
I:10370;1283;It was pure magic from beginning to end.
I:10370;1284;The second movie, of necessity, was less expository and jumps right into the plot.
I:10370;1285;Despite its pluses and minuses, it is definitely worth seeing and was very well done.
I:10370;1286;a few specific comments: Special effects (notably CGI) were much, much improved.
I:10370;1287;It was because it was a particularly good CGI scene.
I:10370;1288;the 3 young actors: Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, pulled off far superior acting in Chamber of Secrets with much more emotion.
I:10370;1289;Other highlights were Dobby (sheer genius, they could not have done better), Fawkes the phoenix (beautifully done), and Moaning Myrtle (who provided some brilliant comic relief).
I:10370;1290;Acting from return actors Harris, Smith, and Rickman was also superb.
I:10370;1291;the movie also sports some great effects: Parseltongue, for instance.
I:10370;1292;I was critical that they would not be able to pull this off, but they did a great job.
I:10370;1293;visual effects were also well used, not only to contribute to the world of magic, but to add humor to the story.
I:10370;1294;And Errol, the owl, was absolutely hilarious.
I:10370;1295;in general the movie is more intense, but then again, so was the book.
I:10370;1296;finally, the movie sports a truly wonderful ending.
I:10370;1297;It was a moving and appropriate ending for a largely dark movie.
I:10370;1298;This film is great for the family, however, some of the scenes may be too intense for kids 8 and younger.
I:10370;1299;The second is even better than the first.
I:10370;1300;Loads of excietment and adventure, with an excellent plot.
I:10370;1301;The movie stays true to the book, any fan would be proud.
I:10370;1302;"But it is good and pleasing when a movie adaptation IS that long and stays true to the original novel
I:10370;1303;Daniel Radcliffe Was wonderful yet again as Harry Potter who is set to begin his 2nd year at Hogwarts.
I:10370;1304;I really enjoyed his take on the character.
I:10370;1305;He did a great job and also brought a lot of humor to the movie as well.
I:10370;1306;But we all know there would be no need for a movie or much less a story if Harry did not return, thus we have a movie that is suspenful, magical, and wonderful for the eyes and the imagination.
I:10370;1307;With no dull moments and truly aspiring performances, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets gets5 Stars
I:10370;1308;This is the popular movie version of the second Harry Potter book.
I:10370;1309;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a good movie, there's no doubt about that.
I:10370;1310;To be entertained, that's the most likely answer.
I:10370;1311;I go to a movie expecting to have fun and get into the story, to be a part of it, like some kind of therapy.
I:10370;1312;For once, the actors are more experienced, and older, and they are able to show it on screen.
I:10370;1313;Chris Columbus, the director, is famous for making nice and innocent films for children mostly, and he does that again easyly.
I:10370;1314;Chris Columbus is able to paste this situation to the screen, and that alone is a feat of directing.
I:10370;1315;The supporting actors, such as Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane have a very strong participation, as in the first one, and help to create a strong feeling of credibility.
I:10370;1316;As all good movies, this one is ageless.
I:10370;1317;I had no idea that I was going to enjoy watching the Harry Potter movies as much as I have done so.
I:10370;1318;We had this sent to our grandson and he loved it.
I:10370;1319;He had read the book and wanted to see the movie.
I:10370;1320;This movie is a must for any harry potter fan.
I:10370;1321;If you read the book, you must see this movie.
I:10370;1322;Rating this just as a movie, it is great.
I:10370;1323;This movie is awesome just like the first one.
I:10370;1324;The movie was good, even great if you haven't read the book.
I:10370;1325;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an exciting and sometimes scary movie!
I:10370;1326;I found it very entertaining and that all the actors did a beautiful job on their characters.
I:10370;1327;From there it's a very excellent film.
I:10370;1328;Other then that this movie will definetely do well in the box office!
I:10370;1329;At times, the viewer might enjoy some more tranquil scenes to break the tension.
I:10370;1330;I have a son who loves Harry potter.
I:10370;1331;Seen the movies more then once.
I:10370;1332;He loves it and I have to say I liked it a lot more then I thought I would.
I:10370;1333;Interesting story line, lovable (and terrible) characters.
I:10370;1334;Most movies never live up to their book counterparts, but this is a movie that is surely close to doing so.
I:10370;1335;first off, the acting of the kids have improved.
I:10370;1336;Dan Radcliffe has gotten quite good at being a sweet.
I:10370;1337;well, you'll have to see for yourself.
I:10370;1338;I recommend that you see it, but try to read the books, also.
I:10370;1339;They are two seperate things, but I feel that it will be a more rewarding experience with the combination of canon and the movie.
I:10370;1340;Chris Columbous is keeping it real and very true to the book in the 2nd movie.
I:10370;1341;Then.12 Emma Watson, 14 year old Dan Radcliffe, and 15 year old Rupert Grint star in this and are great actors.
I:10370;1342;They truly make this movie worthwhile!
I:10370;1343;so watch this and enjoy it while you can!
I:10370;1344;Good if you read the books or even if you didn't!
I:10370;1345;anyway, the movie was wonderful.
I:10370;1346;The thing that I really enjoy about Harry Potter is that it is just so imaginative, unique and intelligent.
I:10370;1347;Harry (with some help from Ron Weasley) manages to escape his uncle's clutches and gets back to Hogwarts.
I:10370;1348;Anyway, it's a very interesting and creative movie with a bunch of similiarities but also a lot of new things as well.
I:10370;1349;(for example, the howler that ron weasley receives from his mother i thought was one of the best magical objects).
I:10370;1350;Jason Isaacs was excellent as Lucius Malfoyand Kenneth Branagh was a hoot as Lockhart.
I:10370;1351;We enjoyed clicking twice and POOF!
I:10370;1352;Unique and exciting are the two words best describing this story.
I:10370;1353;The best thing about it is adults and children alike find it fun to watch.
I:10370;1354;I would recommend it to anyone.
I:10370;1355;"I love all the Harry Potter series, but this one needed the ""deleted"" scenes to help the movie move along."
I:10370;1356;in the deleted scenes, I found the most important plot manipulations, so you can follow the intent of the film and really get into Harry's mind.
I:10370;1357;Below I listed the segments I found most important (deleted scenes #9, #11, #13).
I:10370;1358;The movie will go right back to where you left off after your clip.
I:10370;1359;Unknowingly, he is a very rare gift that is usually only given to very powerful wizards.
I:10370;1360;These other 2 are just funny and cute to watch.
I:10370;1361;The comedy of their reactions is so classic and it always makes me laugh.
I:10370;1362;this processes makes it a little more work,a but it is worth it.
I:10370;1363;The carved gold filigre is awesome the atmosphere is a touch more intense.
I:10370;1364;The magical hiding cloak is excellently a beautiful irridesant cloth.
I:10370;1365;now you watch all the deleted scenes and find out what is most important to you and put them in as you watch the movie.
I:10370;1366;All I have to stay is Blu.
I:10370;1367;He is forming a group of friends that will follow him anywhere.
I:10370;1368;I would recommend this movie to everyone.
I:10370;1369;It is full of action and is a good well written movie that you can let kids watch and not have to worry about sex and cursing being the main things in these movies.
I:10370;1370;I love it because it shows how they handle being bullied in an adult way, with care.
I:10370;1371;This was a relaitvly good movie with many flaws.
I:10370;1372;But the biggest goof is Daniel Radcliff.
I:10370;1373;"he is so funny with his witty lines like ""bloody hell"" something that we never say in the USA."
I:10370;1374;i am a huge fan of the books and i have been reading them since their american debut.
I:10370;1375;My husband and I are huge Harry Potter fans, and we have all of them.
I:10370;1376;I enjoyed this movie as well as the rest of them.
I:10370;1377;I am a junior in high school, but I love the Harry Potter series.
I:10370;1378;This movie is the best Harry Potter movie yet.
I:10370;1379;This movie is darker than the first movie, however, it is still very good.
I:10370;1380;Also Tom Riddle's character is portrayed very well.
I:10370;1381;The actress that plays Ginny is a very good actress.
I:10370;1382;Daniel Radcliffe does a very very excellant job.
I:10370;1383;Rupirt Grint and Emma Watson also do a very excellant job as well.
I:10370;1384;Good job Daniel, Rupirt, and Emma, great movie.
I:10370;1385;Better then looking at this movie on blu.
I:10370;1386;Very, very clear and excellent sound.
I:10370;1387;$10 for this movie was an incredible deal!
I:10370;1388;Even with the latest harry potter movies out, i still watch this one!
I:10370;1389;So stop dissing Chris Columbus because he showed with this movie, that he had a very good vision.
I:10370;1390;This is still one of my favorites of the movies.
I:10370;1391;Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets is by far the best in the series.
I:10370;1392;this box set is by far the best in entertaiment i've seen in a ultimate packaging.
I:10370;1393;with 4 discs enclosed in this box set, not only you get to see Harry potter and the chamber of secrets but you also see the extended version of it as well.
I:10370;1394;Harry's second magical mystery adventure at Hogwarts.
I:10370;1395;S'ok, pretty True to the Book, minus Nick's Death Day party.
I:10370;1396;Digital FX was okay especially the pixies and Basilisk and Spiders are exceptional (certainly compared to the centaur in the first film).
I:10370;1397;Kids are clearly more comfortable here.
I:10370;1398;John Williams music is great again .
I:10370;1399;Richard Harris is a great Dumbledore.
I:10370;1400;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a wonderfully faithful adaptation of the second book in the series, and I do recommend it to you.
I:10370;1401;the main three actors have all taken on their roles with a freshness and excitement that makes them a joy to watch.
I:10370;1402;it is a great ride, and I suggest you hop onboard the Hogwart's Express and take the journey yourself, or you will be sorry indeed.
I:10370;1403;It's better than the first film!
I:10370;1404;Not only is the story more interesting(though the first was tops as well), it's packed with even more wonder and imagination than the first as well.
I:10370;1405;The castmembers of the first flick return, as well as Kenneth Branagh in a superb performance as Lockhart, the bumbling, vain writer of Magical Me.
I:10370;1406;I'm sure the naysayers had a wonderful time bashing this sequel for its evil undertones.
I:10370;1407;He makes the right choices, does the good deeds and fights a good fight.
I:10370;1408;the Potter books encourage kids to read and use their imagination.
I:10370;1409;That's a good thing in my book.
I:10370;1410;The movies encourage kids to use their imaginations as well.You've just got to love something that promotes so many good things.
I:10370;1411;He's a good character to let your kids read about and watch on the big screen.
I:10370;1412;overall this movie is fun and enjoyable for the whole family.
I:10370;1413;watch this one and have a ton of fun.
I:10370;1414;However, the superb cast provides an excellent performance that is a pleasure for the eye.
I:10370;1415;Harry's back for another year at school and this episode is even better than the first one.
I:10370;1416;Everything about Hogwarts comes to life beautifully.
I:10370;1417;Kenneth Brannagh as the ham Defense against the dark arts teacher was brilliant.
I:10370;1418;Even people who have never read the book or saw the first movie will enjoy this.
I:10370;1419;The extended version has trouble keeping the vocals aligned with the actors.
I:10370;1420;The behind the scenes is very well done.
I:10370;1421;Kids enjoyed watching the movie, especially the one who is reading through the series.
I:10370;1422;Playback was great with no glitches.
I:10370;1423;I'm a big HP fan and this boxes are great, the content is really good,The box content has a lot of things tha every fan love.
I:10370;1424;year old Lord Voldemort in a finale that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:10370;1425;hero, and he emerges as a real screen star.
I:10370;1426;He is much more confident and an all.
I:10370;1427;Rupert Grint (Ron) gets all the funny lines and proves himself a clever sidekick.
I:10370;1428;Emma Watson (Hermione) has a smaller part this time, but is also very comfortable in front of the camera.
I:10370;1429;I wish we saw more of him and of Kenneth Branaugh as the very funny Professor Lockhart.
I:10370;1430;harry Potter fans are sure to enjoy this installment, although it may be too scary for those under 7.
I:10370;1431;packed plots and really good special effects, you will not be disappointed.
I:10370;1432;well I cant believe we waited so long to watch them!
I:10370;1433;I think you will truly enjoy these movies!
I:10370;1434;I really enjoyed the extended version of the movie.
I:10370;1435;This will be an excellent addition to my sisters collection of movies.
I:10370;1436;Fun movie for the whole family to watch.
I:10370;1437;Stays true to the book which was great as the kids could identify the parts.
I:10370;1438;I was really pleased with harry potters chamber of secrets book.
I:10370;1439;harry potter is one of the best things that kids have to look forward to these days.
I:10370;1440;any other mentor has a cape and super powers, granted so does harry potter but he is a little more realistic.
I:10370;1441;i am 19 years old and i enjoyed this book.
I:10370;1442;I went right after skool to see it.
I:10370;1443;All the graphics and the details were maybe 10 TIMES better than the first movie.
I:10370;1444;The chamber of secrets has got to be the best movie i have seen this year.
I:10370;1445;I love the books and the movie caught my attention right away.
I:10370;1446;I got this for my kindle because I knew the kids would want to watch it multiple times, and it occupies them during long trips.
I:10370;1447;when I am watching this movie I can feel interestAnd this movie makes me happy and dream about imagination.
I:10370;1448;And I want to learn magic.
I:10370;1449;the our society is very complecation.
I:10370;1450;through this movie I can dream what I really want.
I:10370;1451;so this movie is very fantastic.
I:10370;1452;It is up to Harry and his friends, Ron and Hermoine, to open the door to the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets.
I:10370;1453;an excellent plot, dazzling effects, enchanting characters, and fearsome villians are the ingredients to brew up a fantastic movie!
I:10370;1454;And seeing it on the big screen is well worth the ticket price.
I:10370;1455;old to see it and he thoroughly enjoyed it without nightmares.
I:10370;1456;I think that you are the best actor I know!!
I:10370;1457;The magic is back and is the story is bigger and better than the first.
I:10370;1458;The special effects have become better and so has the acting.
I:10370;1459;Was easy to download and watch.
I:10370;1460;Harry, Hermoine and Ron continue to amaze and thrill us.
I:10370;1461;Better than most of the movies being shown today.
I:10370;1462;I am a great fan of J. k. Rowling's work, I mean it is amazing.
I:10370;1463;they vaugely follow the true story line.
I:10370;1464;I ordered two items on the same day and this item came first.
I:10370;1465;I had a very good experience.
I:10370;1466;I really like that they have made the extended version available.
I:10370;1467;I highly recommend this video.
I:10370;1468;Only when his best friend, Ron, comes and rescues him from his cell of a room do things start to improve.
I:10370;1469;elf named Dobby: he will be in grave danger if he returns to Hogwarts.
I:10370;1470;"With the help of Ron and Hermione, will Harry be able to save Hogwarts from a deadly evil?Overall, ""Chamber of Secrets"" was very enjoyable."
I:10370;1471;He is everything Harry should be and seems to pull it off effortlessly, quietly endearing the audience to him.
I:10370;1472;Rupert Grint is fabulous as well.
I:10370;1473;His facial expressions and voice inflections always find a way to make me smile.
I:10370;1474;The late Richard Harris gives a memorable and touching performance as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore.
I:10370;1475;the special effects were stunning.
I:10370;1476;it was a lot of fun seeing some of my favorite scenes brought to life.
I:10370;1477;I absolutely loved the polyjuice potion part (it was so funny!)
I:10370;1478;Chamber of Secrets, like every movie based on a book, loses something in the translation from page to reel, but Chris Columbus has succeeded once again in creating a spectacular representation of the magical world that we Muggles have come to love.
I:10370;1479;The brilliant acting makes up for most plot changes.
I:10370;1480;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an excellent film adaptation of J. k. Rowling's book.
I:10370;1481;Having read the book, I was impressed by how recognizable the film was, very like the original.
I:10370;1482;The young actors who are the leads fill the film well and seem to be growing in ability with each of the films.
I:10370;1483;As Harry Potter, he does a good job of showing Harry's stubbornness, his loyalty and compassion.
I:10370;1484;Emma Watson seems a perfect choice to play the brainy Hermione Granger.
I:10370;1485;I greatly enjoyed this film.
I:10370;1486;Harry Potter unravels very much like a mystery story with the twist that the magical world events make the clues pure delightful fantasy.
I:10370;1487;"Words like ""muggles"" seep into our vocabulary with perfectly clear understanding."
I:10370;1488;This is one of my favorite rainy day films to watch again and again.
I:10370;1489;"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is much better than ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."""
I:10370;1490;The new movie contains more action, more suspense, and a darker story than the first one.
I:10370;1491;The film continues to shed light on (the very well known by now) Harry Potter, as he attends his second year at Hogwarts.
I:10370;1492;His powers are growing and so is the mystery surrounding his true purpose in life.
I:10370;1493;harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a highly entertaining, action.
I:10370;1494;packed adventure with strong elements of fantasy, not to mention some very witty humor.
I:10370;1495;All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
I:10370;1496;Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.
I:10370;1497;the concept, the setting, the special effects, and the music, are all EXCELLENT!
I:10370;1498;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment.
I:10370;1499;In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.
I:10370;1500;I'm a huge fan of the HP books, and in spite of the criticism I have thoroughly enjoyed the movies.
I:10370;1501;"CoS is better in pretty much all respects than Sorcerer's Stone: the kids have matured noticeably as actors, and look much more relaxed and natural
I:10370;1502;With a force like Harry Potter it can be dangerous to change anything at all for fear of alienating the fans, but this movie did a great job of capturing the spirit of the books without turning into a highlights film .
I:10370;1503;I especially loved the cast interviews where we got to see the kids out of character, and learn what the adults think about their young costars.
I:10370;1504;overall, this may not be Oscar material, but it's a perfect companion to the books and makes me love the series more.
I:10370;1505;I've seen it 3 times, myself being 18, and with my mother (41) and my grandmother (65) all of us loved the book and the movies.
I:10370;1506;As I've already watched thee first movie, I' ve seen that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a big improvement on the first.
I:10370;1507;more daring adventures as we expore the world of young Harry together with Ron, and Hermione.
I:10370;1508;This is a great movie, better than the first, I should say!
I:10370;1509;once again another great find at a great price and arriving within the times stated and the care in which items are packaged helps keeps merchandise safe
I:10370;1510;I was a movie and we liked it what can i say more
I:10370;1511;The second book is probably my least favourite and I think this second movie also comes off second best after the first.
I:10370;1512;but it's a must for all Harry potter marathons, and I guess I'll just have to smile and endure it.
I:10370;1513;Like the first movie it is reasonably scary .
I:10370;1514;It is still pretty idiot.
I:10370;1515;Magic ink and ghosts that lurk in the toilets make for a clever plot line that all can enjoy.
I:10370;1516;I love all the Harry Potter books and movies!
I:10370;1517;Such a great story that's been translated into film.
I:10370;1518;Highly recommend this movie to everyone!
I:10370;1519;The actors acted out the characters exactly like I imagined they would be from the book, the diction of the actors was incredible and the image clarity of the movie was outstanding.
I:10370;1520;this was a movie that I will continue to watch for a long time, because I love the Harry Potter books so much.
I:10370;1521;"I loved the ""Sorceror's Stone"", but I love ""Chamber of Secrets"" even better!!"
I:10370;1522;, but the movie was more well.
I:10370;1523;done than the Sorceror's Stone movie.
I:10370;1524;The children's acting, while improved from the first, still needs some work, particularly from Dan Radcliffe (who plays Harry Potter).
I:10370;1525;overall, I really enjoy this movie, though it still seems a little too sugar.
I:10370;1526;whereby Harry Potter must rescue himself and best friend Ron's sister from the dreaded past.
I:10370;1527;In between discovering that an elf needs his help to gain his freedom and that he can speak with snakes, Harry uncovers how intertwined he is with Voldemort in a shared destiny.
I:10370;1528;As with the rest of the series it kept you in suspense and very much on Harry's side in his adventures through the myriad of minor adventures within the plot.
I:10370;1529;This is an excellent series and well orth procuring for young and old.
I:10370;1530;HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is a fun film.
I:10370;1531;It was actually ten minutes longer than the first but was actually more entertaining.
I:10370;1532;This one is fun, magic and personality.
I:10370;1533;The special effects and creative production design make this a very scary and exciting movie.
I:10370;1534;The chemistry these kids have with each other on screen is great.
I:10370;1535;this was a very entertaining movie with gigantic spiders, magical owls and even the legendary Pheonix brought to life as only George Lucas's ILM (Industrial Light and Magic) could bring to life.
I:10370;1536;It's a funny movie with heart and a great moral subtext for the kinds about friendship and loyalty to each other.
I:10370;1537;A great film for the whole family to enjoy.
I:10370;1538;The lead actors were great making you really believe that they are Harry Ron and Hermione.
I:10370;1539;there was a lot more action this movie with blazing magic.
I:10370;1540;It was nice to see Malfoy, played by well Tom Felton, get his this time.
I:10370;1541;one thing I noticed is that Harry, played by Daniel Radcliffe, is coming into his own.
I:10370;1542;He has grown up to his magic and is a lot more confident with himself.
I:10370;1543;The steely eyed look in his eye when he face Draco and his father as well as the beast in the Chamber.
I:10370;1544;adding Moaning Myrtle was nice in this movie as well but that character was more important this time.
I:10370;1545;i give this movie five stars for action, acting, graphics, and good story line.
I:10370;1546;And the care was great.
I:10370;1547;I Can't say enough about the Potter series, they sure have the right actor living Harry, and he comes off as an ordinary next door neighbor, as do all the others, while going to the school of wizardry, has you believing that there are such people who do go to schools like that, great plots as well, superb acting in every one of them, truly amazing.
I:10370;1548;For me, the first two Harry Potter movies were the best because of Richard Harris was the perfect actor to play Dumbledore.
I:10370;1549;He played the part so well that the rest of the movies were such a letdown with Michael Gambon.
I:10370;1550;The only other aspect that makes this particular version better then the others is the 13 extra minutes of footage added, something that needed to be done for 3.6.
I:10370;1551;I somehow misplaced this video and so I HAD to replace it, I wanted the complete collection and this movie is so important to the story I just had to have it.
I:10370;1552;Thank you so much i will be ordering again soon!
I:10370;1553;A bit childish, but fun.
I:10370;1554;Other than that the movie is wonderful and very truthful to the book.
I:10370;1555;I found this box set at Big Lots for about $5.
I:10370;1556;It is a really nice set.
I:10370;1557;I look forward to collecting the years.
I:10370;1558;Lots of fun in store for those who enjoy learning about behind the scenes activities.
I:10370;1559;Combined with the ultimate set for Sorcerer's Stone, Harry Potter fans will have an informative and entertaining view of the films and how they were made, including lots of footage of the stars in interviews and auditioning.
I:10370;1560;as an avid fan and collector of the book, i was slightly dismayed by the movie.
I:10370;1561;i was able to watch it 3x since it opened earlier here in our country, (wednesday is the sched for changing flicks).
I:10370;1562;daniel radcliffe certainly made his presence known and was able to stand up to his role besides all those famous and honoured adult cast.
I:10370;1563;memorable scenes in the movie was the flying car, lockhart's first day of class, the quidditch match, spiders in the dark forrest and of course the chamber of secrets scenes.
I:10370;1564;i believe the first movie was closer to the book but part 2 was more appealing since it makes you want to know more.
I:10370;1565;it draws people more into the harry potter series since it keeps you wondering about a lot of things especially those who weren't able to read the books.
I:10370;1566;overall, chamber of secrets is a film worth of your time especially if you're an avid harry potter fan.
I:10370;1567;This movie is a great add to our collection of Harry Potter Blue ray for me and regular for the kids.
I:10370;1568;"grossing film of all time, ""Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets"" (much like its predecessor) combines incredible visuals with a completely uninteresting, mundane storyline."
I:10370;1569;It is good to watch, but not as good as Part I .
I:10370;1570;"While it still retains many of the elements that continue to make of the series a children's classic, I liked the second installment more than the ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" movie."
I:10370;1571;The beginning was a little repetitive in some ways (Harry's family, the train departure, etc.) but past that, the movie took on a life of its own and became very enjoyable, with a whole plot woven around the existence of a terrible hidden Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts.
I:10370;1572;Some elements I found to be rather interesting were the uninvited house.
I:10370;1573;elf (Dobby) and Dumbledore's beautiful Phoenix bird.
I:10370;1574;Obviously deserved praise for the ingenious characters and their surroundings belongs to J. k. Rawling, the author of the books, but the movie in itself is capable to deliver a whole world of effects that blend very well into the brilliant story.
I:10370;1575;born Alfonso Cuaron directing the next installment, the Potter movies promise to only get better with time, quite an accomplishment for sequels.
I:10370;1576;It had a great story but failed to deliver visual impact and convincing performances.
I:10370;1577;Harry Potters second year at Hogwarts is quite a similar story to the first one but unlike the first movie, it is told with the adequate momentum and thrilling, even scary imagery.
I:10370;1578;His voice has dropped and he has much more heroic dialogue to make you feel that has become a genuine movie hero.
I:10370;1579;The overall direction and editing seems more mature and logical and the 156 minutes run by in a second.
I:10370;1580;But of course it helps to have talents like the late Richard Harris, Maggie Smith and the absolutely brilliant Kenneth Branagh.
I:10370;1581;All in all: With Harry Potter also Chris Columbus has grown up and has directed a darker and most importatly much better crafted film.
I:10370;1582;I wanted to try a Harry Potter movie as I loved the books.
I:10370;1583;I found I prefer the books but the movies can provide a good way to kill and evening too.
I:10370;1584;Its a great movie, awesome book .
I:10370;1585;the actors' acting defiantly improved from the first Harry Potter film.
I:10370;1586;And the special effects are better that ever.
I:10370;1587;an exciting movie to watch if you are in need for thrill.
I:10370;1588;But what I like in the movie is the special effects and stuff.
I:10370;1589;some new actors in the movie are.
I:10370;1590;Lucious Malfoy in the movie totally destroyed my expectation on the image.
I:10370;1591;The movie is also fuzzy on the details.
I:10370;1592;Furthermore, the movie skipped many important/ good events from the book.
I:10370;1593;I was a little disappointed, but the movie is still very good.
I:10370;1594;The second book has always been my least favorite so it was understandable to me that this movie wasn't as exciting as the first, but it is still very cool and alot of fun!
I:10370;1595;Great for kids, not boring for adults!
I:10370;1596;Saw it with my 7 year old son, and the whole family enjoyed it.
I:10370;1597;We read the books a while ago, and film ads a great dimension to the experience of Harry Potter.
I:10370;1598;We'll definitely be watching it again.
I:10370;1599;All that is keeping Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) going through the summer is the thought of returning to school.
I:10370;1600;Are the students safe?As with the first movie, this one brings Harry's world to life beautifully.
I:10370;1601;The cast from the first movie returns and hits all the right notes with their characters.
I:10370;1602;Joining the cast this time is Kenneth Branagh as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and he's a riot in the comic relief role.
I:10370;1603;I loved his grandfatherly take on the character.
I:10370;1604;fans of the books will be delighted with this film.
I:10370;1605;It perfectly captures the book on which it is based.
I:10370;1606;It was a delight to see them make more sense of the story.
I:10370;1607;The first two movies in the Harry Potter series are worth having.
I:10370;1608;No matter your age the story is enjoyable and entertaining.
I:10370;1609;This film was greatly better than the first Harry Potter film.
I:10370;1610;There was better acting in the movie, more intense action, and a little more of the book was added to this film.
I:10370;1611;a much more intense and exciting movie, I say that if you thought the frist film was OK or y'just liked it, this is the movie for you to see.
I:10370;1612;This was a great movie and in many ways superior to the first in the series .
I:10370;1613;so as the simplistic (yet more complex than the first) plot unfolded I was entertained and impressed.
I:10370;1614;PG 13 is a good rating as I dont think that younger children should see the violence within the Chamber itself, mostly they wouldnt understand what was happening.
I:10370;1615;i hope that the actors will be able to return for the remaining stories.
I:10370;1616;Daniel Radcliffe has a maturity and talent beyond his years.
I:10370;1617;Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are improving nicely.
I:10370;1618;And the adults continue to be perfectly cast .
I:10370;1619;the best British actors playing the best British wizards!
I:10370;1620;Have always loved this series.
I:10370;1621;It's a good read for both kids and adults, and the movies are entertaining for both groups as well.
I:10370;1622;This is really an ultimate edition.
I:10370;1623;This movie was very well made.
I:10370;1624;A good addition to any movie collection.
I:10370;1625;i just saw this movie this weekend, and it was great.
I:10370;1626;it had really good special affects and stayed very true to the book.
I:10370;1627;All I can say is that Chris Columbus and friends have once again succeeded in completely slaughtering a perfectly good story.
I:10370;1628;"let me set the records straight
I:10370;1629;They were entertaining and provided amusement for a wide age range.
I:10370;1630;define charm inside of them that made reading a delight.
I:10370;1631;emphasized, detracting from the believability that made the books so endearing.
I:10370;1632;necessary scene embellishment and omittance.
I:10370;1633;It had a good, strong grasp of his neck for about fifteen seconds!
I:10370;1634;similarly, I prefer Rowling's sequence of events regarding Harry's near.
I:10370;1635;It created the impression that we were watching some sort of secret agent movie and I half.
I:10370;1636;Of course, Rowling mentioned all of these ending components in passing but Columbus chose to milk them for all they were worth, turning the end of the movie into a warm, fuzzy, Disney cartoon.
I:10370;1637;Better than the first movie.
I:10370;1638;And better than the book on which it is based.
I:10370;1639;Steven Kloves (screen writer) and Chris Columbus (director) have managed to tighten.
I:10370;1640;up the story, and even though the film still clocks in at over 2 1/2 hours, you feel as thought it is always moving, always full of energy.
I:10370;1641;There are moments of magic, humor, horror, and tenderness.
I:10370;1642;All of this wraps together nicely into a good, solid, children's adventure film which kids of all ages (up to 100) can enjoy.
I:10370;1643;opened, unleashing the monster which lies within it.
I:10370;1644;opening of the Chamber, before the entire school is closed for good.
I:10370;1645;"the imagery in ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is magnificient."
I:10370;1646;From the flying car to the angry tree, from Dobby the elf to the evil spiders, the special effects are superb.
I:10370;1647;Everything works perfectly to make this magical world come alive.
I:10370;1648;It is a perfect example of how to blend live actors and settings with CGI creatures and props.
I:10370;1649;I'm 26 years old, and found myself jumping during a couple of parts.
I:10370;1650;the acting by all involved is exceptional, especially with Daniel Radcliffe (Potter) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley).
I:10370;1651;Radcliffe has obviously grown more secure with his abilities, and appears confident, with a quiet strength befitting the character.
I:10370;1652;Grint is absolutely fabulous as Ron Weasley.
I:10370;1653;He is Harry's best friend, and a character in his own right.
I:10370;1654;I loved his facial expressions every time he was scared.
I:10370;1655;Alan Rickman, as Professor Snape, is once again delightful in his own, underplayed way.
I:10370;1656;It is performances like these that help make the characters seem more real.
I:10370;1657;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fine film.
I:10370;1658;Oh well, a small quibble for an otherwise great movie.
I:10370;1659;When fine acting, taut script.
I:10370;1660;writing, good direction, and awesome special effects come together like this, it can only make for an immensely enjoyable viewing experience.
I:10370;1661;The second installment of the Harry Potter series is a success, capturing the feel, characters, and places of Rowling's worlds.
I:10370;1662;This two disc set has plenty of extra features, including deleted scenes, for anyone who wishes to go even further into the world of magic and wizardry.
I:10370;1663;the set design is fantastic, and the special effects are better than those in the first installment.
I:10370;1664;Its real problem is that it contains scenes that are genuinely scary, especially for children with phobias about spiders and/or snakes.
I:10370;1665;Otherwise, this is fantastic family entertainment.
I:10370;1666;The second film adaptation of J. k. Rowling's immensely popular seven.
I:10370;1667;Certainly, as a movie by itself, it entertains thoroughly and like with the other films, will both entertain adults and kids equally.
I:10370;1668;otherwise, everything else is top.
I:10370;1669;The returning actors successfully return to their roles they made their own in the first installment .
I:10370;1670;The adult actors deliver first.
I:10370;1671;rate performances but again don't shadow the kids, who take center stage in the movies.
I:10370;1672;year old woman playing the ghost of a teenage girl), Jason Issacs, and Christian Coulson dig into their roles with gusto.
I:10370;1673;The technical aspects are superb, with luscious cinematography and production design by Roger Pratt and Stuart Craig respectively, with John Williams again providing a spectacular score.
I:10370;1674;In short, if your kids enjoy the Harry Potter books (or if you do), you will most likely enjoy this installment, as well as non.
I:10370;1675;warner Brothers has released this film available as a 2.
I:10370;1676;For the sake of cinemaphiles and the respect of filmmakers, I own the widescreen edition.
I:10370;1677;maintained throughout and never falter, while detail is very sharp for the majority of the picture.
I:10370;1678;The movie is bigger and louder than the first, and the audio happily follows suit.
I:10370;1679;The dynamic range is quite wide, so make sure the volume isn't turned to maximum when you put it in, because it could blow out your surround system.
I:10370;1680;The bass is meaty and thick, and it is impressive.
I:10370;1681;i recommend this disc, it's a good movie with an excellent transfer and stunning audio coupled with an okay set of supplements.
I:10370;1682;adventure may just draw you in.
I:10370;1683;The movies for the Harry Potter series have been solid, and Chamber of Secrets has been no exception.
I:10370;1684;It was especially nice to see Tom Riddle 'visualized' in the movie .
I:10370;1685;sure, I can picture for myself what is happening in the books, but sometimes it is fun to see what a movie does to the book (as long as it's well.
I:10370;1686;The movie starts you out with an older Harry Potter.
I:10370;1687;to wrap it up though, in the end.
I:10370;1688;a movie will get a lot of praise if it is a popular book adaptation.
I:10370;1689;How can you not love Harry Potter, the books are better but the movie was beautifully done.
I:10370;1690;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was an amazing film.
I:10370;1691;This sequel is even better.
I:10370;1692;this film is not only funnier, and more fun than the first, it is much darker, and full of suspense and action.
I:10370;1693;While I'm (im)patiently waiting for Goblet Of Fire to come out in November, I'm having fun watching the movies.
I:10370;1694;I got the fright of my life when I started watching and Daniel and Rupert's voices had broken!
I:10370;1695;With Julie Walters playing the mum and the stuttering guy from Shakespeare In Love playing the dad, and lookalike Rons, it's a terrific family!
I:10370;1696;Thankfully we get to see a lot more of Dad Weasley in the later books, so hopefully he'll appear more in the films.
I:10370;1697;(He's definitely got a lot of makeup on, either that or it's the hair!)
I:10370;1698;Seriously, NOT a good character.
I:10370;1699;In Chamber of Secrets, I've found little to complain about.
I:10370;1700;unlike the first film with the tedious character introductions, this one jumps right into the story.
I:10370;1701;The darker tone of the film reflects the book's tone perfectly.
I:10370;1702;especially the talents of Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson who play Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
I:10370;1703;Kenneth Branagh is perfectly casted as the narcissistic Gilderoy Lockhart and Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) and Maggie Smith (Minerva McGonagall) yet again give excellent performances.
I:10370;1704;the special effects have improved tremendously.
I:10370;1705;the Quidditch sequences look amazing and the Basilisk scene is enjoyably frightful.
I:10370;1706;will find this movie very enjoyable.
I:10370;1707;I loved the 1st one(which I am watching once again now), and loved this one even more!It honors the book in so many ways!
I:10370;1708;True, my favorite part of this book was omitted from the movie(the Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy fight scene), but I loved it all the same!The young actors and actresses are much better in this one than in the first movie.
I:10370;1709;I think it is great how we get to watch them grow up, just like the books!
I:10370;1710;Harry speaking Parseltongue, Hermonine's crush on Lockhart, and Ron's comic relief, all fantastic!Lockhart was absolutely fantastic in this!
I:10370;1711;He was just as good as in the first one, and we hope that his replacement can fill the seat of Dumbledore just as Harris had!I can't say how much I loved this movie!
I:10370;1712;I went and saw it twice the very first day it came out!
I:10370;1713;What made this film even better than the first one was how we saw a lot more magic.
I:10370;1714;Everyone uses their wand a lot more, except Ron!
I:10370;1715;The Burrow is full of amazing magical stuff!
I:10370;1716;so let the kid in you come alive again!!!
I:10370;1717;This has to be one of the greatest movies of all time!
I:10370;1718;It is better than the first one ( The Sorcerors Stone ), and the cast is amazing!
I:10370;1719;This is a must see movie for everyone!
I:10370;1720;this movie is just as good as the first.
I:10370;1721;it was well done for all it had to convey.
I:10370;1722;This is the best thing for those who love the Harry Potter series!!
I:10370;1723;The booklet and the cards are well made and very interesting.
I:10370;1724;I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter Series by J. k. Rowling, and was thoroughly delighted when Warner Brothers began making films based on the books.
I:10370;1725;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was verry enjoyable, but I particularly enjoyed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets because it is my fivorite book in the series, and because the actors/actresses portraying the characters seem more well.
I:10370;1726;Richard Harris is absolutely outstanding as Dumbledore, and of course the kids' are terrific.
I:10370;1727;Everyone should take the time to see this movie in order to appreciate the wonderful acting skills, and the deep lessons of self.
I:10370;1728;Take care, and happy watching to you all!
I:10370;1729;This book was really great because it delved even deeper into the world of magic and what better way to learn more about who Voldemort was.
I:10370;1730;deserved success of the 2001 film Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone , director Chris Columbus returned in 2002 with the impressive sequel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets .
I:10370;1731;He was twice nominated for Best Actor by the Academy Awards for his work in the 1963 film This Sporting Life and the 1990 film The Field .
I:10370;1732;It's a wonderful film that I highly recommend to everyone.
I:10370;1733;Chamber of Secrets had many wonderful scenes to see, and found viewing it a pleasure.
I:10370;1734;I understand that it is an incredible accomplishment creating on screen the scenes and people that Ms. Rowling has created in our minds but I miss the dialogue.
I:10370;1735;Really these are great movies for the fans to watch, but in no way are they a replacent for the absolute wonder that is J. k. Rowling's talented writing.
I:10370;1736;I can't wait to see what a new director does with the third book which is, in my opinion, the best and also where the epic of Harry Potter turns in new directions.
I:10370;1737;This second installment in the immensely popular series once again delivers a world of fantastic magical proportions.
I:10370;1738;Most of the members of the original movie are back and once again director Chris Columbus weaves a tale of sorcery and danger for our young heroes.
I:10370;1739;With gorgeous sets, costumes and neat special effects, this movie should entertain all, even those of us who aren't Harry Potterphiles.
I:10370;1740;I love watching these early Harry Potter movies, they take me back to being a kid when I really thought that magic was in the air and an enchanted kingdom lied just beyond the corner.
I:10370;1741;We love Harry Potter in our house, so we were very excited to get the Ultimate Edition.
I:10370;1742;this was another harry potter film which I had to see it a few times to really enjoy it.
I:10370;1743;tom riddle is an interesting character
I:10370;1744;Great movie, whole family liked it.
I:10370;1745;The biggest thing about the Harry Potter movies in the positives column is that they have managed to make the movies accessable to those who are not fans of the book, even though this has at times come at the chagrin of those who are devoted afficionados of the books.
I:10370;1746;The movie is a solid piece of cinematography that handles the story and the characters quite well, even though it would seem that some of the minor plot points that were lifted directly from the books could have been better explained for those of us who have not read the books.
I:10370;1747;This movie came promptly and worked perfectly.
I:10370;1748;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fantastic movie in and of itself.
I:10370;1749;But the true beauty of Chamber of Secrets is that it is the most faithful to the book of all the Harry Potter movies.
I:10370;1750;In Chamber of Secrets,we see the world that was created for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone given a story with more emotional depth to it.
I:10370;1751;Lucius Malfoy is a strong dark character whose ruthlessness is so brilliantly portrayed by Jason Issacs.
I:10370;1752;And this film is more intense than Sorcerer's Stone,especially in the battle in the Chamber of Secrets itself.
I:10370;1753;I was also pleased to see John Williams excellent music from Sorcerer's Stone make a return in Chamber of Secrets.
I:10370;1754;Finally,the visual effects are much improved over Sorcerer's Stone.
I:10370;1755;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a wonderful movie that is absolutely faithful to the book and certainly deserves 5 stars.
I:10370;1756;added scenes added to continuity .
I:10370;1757;The magical world of Harry Potter is revisited with the second film in the series that digs deeper into mysteries of the wizard world.
I:10370;1758;The original film, Harry Potter the Sorcerer's Stone, was met with huge hype and an enormous response from the movie.
I:10370;1759;It is up to Harry and his group of friends to protect Hogwarts from impending danger within the school itself.
I:10370;1760;The story for The Chamber of Secrets is much darker then the original Harry Potter but that is what makes it great.
I:10370;1761;The darkness of the plot shows that the film makers are willing to make their films more mature as their audience gets older.
I:10370;1762;a good amount of the cast from Harry Potter the Sorcerer's Stone reprise their roles in the second film.
I:10370;1763;Daniel Radcliffe returns as Harry Potter and once again he is fabulous in the role.
I:10370;1764;He showcases a broad range of emotions within the film which is rarely seen in a film intended for children and does a much better job at showcasing his acting talent then he did in the original.
I:10370;1765;Richard Harris, in his last major role in a motion picture, is wonderful once again as Professor Dumbledore.
I:10370;1766;Harris is one of the greatest British actors that have ever appeared on screen and it is wonderful to see him go out in such a great way as in this role.
I:10370;1767;There are too many roles within this film to mention each by name but the cast is very well put together and there were very few problems.
I:10370;1768;overall, Harry Potter the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best movies of the year and goes beyond the expectations of a normal sequel.
I:10370;1769;The magical world of Harry Potter is brought back to life better then ever before.
I:10370;1770;The darker moments actually make the film feel more exciting and make the audience feel more connected to the characters and what happens to them.
I:10370;1771;The film definitely matures with the audience the Harry Potter series seems to connect to but doesn't do so in such a dramatic way that some fans are alienated by rapid change.
I:10370;1772;There were many amazing CG special effect sequences but not all the CGI was greatly appreciated.
I:10370;1773;This film is a delightful film for all ages, though some precaution may be needed for the younger fans of Harry Potter as the film has several frightening moments.
I:10370;1774;This movie is much better than the first.
I:10370;1775;The suspense and action is increadable and the special effects are amazing.
I:10370;1776;I recommend this movie even though over 70% of the population of Region 1 has seen it.
I:10370;1777;If u want to see a good family movie, this is ur best choice.
I:10370;1778;although it is 2 hours and 41 minutes, this movie will keep u laughing, screaming, and geussing the whole way through!
I:10370;1779;They were still quite young in this movie since it was shot basically right after the first one.
I:10370;1780;like with the first movie they had to cut a lot out of the books, but they did keep the important parts of the story and the story flowed very well.
I:10370;1781;I also thought the special effects were well done and were incorporated nicely into the real sets.
I:10370;1782;The standout character introduced in this film was Lucious Malfoy.
I:10370;1783;There was not an ounce of sincerity in anything (aside from the evil parts) and it worked very well.
I:10370;1784;Also I liked what they did with Dobby.
I:10370;1785;Although a lot of that character was removed from what was in the books (more so in the next films than this one), he did provide some comic relief and helped to move the story along.
I:10370;1786;I ordered this movie, and it came within two days of my order, with regular free shipping.
I:10370;1787;The movie itself is wonderful.
I:10370;1788;If anyone hasn't seen this movie, I recommend them doing so.
I:10370;1789;I thought that this movie was awsome!
I:10370;1790;I even liked it better than the book.
I:10370;1791;The actresses and actors did an amazing job, and so did Chris Columbus.
I:10370;1792;All the magic that is in your head after reading the book comes to life in both this and in the first movie.
I:10370;1793;John Williams, who composed both the Harry Potter movie's music as well a Star Wars: Episone II: Attack of the Clones's music, did an outstanding job with the music for this particular production.
I:10370;1794;To sum it all up, no matter if you did or didn't like toe first movie, you'll love this one!
I:10370;1795;The Sorcerer's Stone kicked off the Harry Potter franchise with mammoth worldwide business and success.
I:10370;1796;Even though it is a foregone they will discover the truth, the exceptional cast (Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman and Jason Issacs) make it all fun and a little memorable, despite the film being overstuffed with incident and extraneous detail.
I:10370;1797;"much as the first film, ""The Chamber of Secrets"" is a visual feast, filled with lavishly designed sets, costumes and special effects, all topped off by the impeccable cinematography of Roger Pratt (Batman), who does all he can with director Columbus' stiffly framed style."
I:10370;1798;But once again, Columbus is saved by his stellar cast who give Rowling's characters great time on the silver screen.
I:10370;1799;was as entertaining as the first one and an exciting adventure.
I:10370;1800;There were some things missing from the book, but it is stil a very good movie
I:10370;1801;The special effects are amazing.
I:10370;1802;It is a long movie that definitely won't feel that way!
I:10370;1803;But for this film, I have a whole new gripe.
I:10370;1804;there's more similarities, and once you start looking you'll spot them.
I:10370;1805;Things just happen because they're cool scenes or neat ideas.
I:10370;1806;Just because you see something in advance, doesn't mean it's a clue.
I:10370;1807;Because I'm nice like that.
I:10370;1808;Love the actors and actresses!
I:10370;1809;They did a great job making this movie!
I:10370;1810;We loved reading the books and watching the movies!
I:10370;1811;The movie, chronicles Harry's second year at Hogwarts and his new adventure.
I:10370;1812;It also does justice to the book.
I:10370;1813;This movie ia absolutely worth it.
I:10370;1814;As for the adults taking the little ones to see it.
I:10370;1815;I really enjoyed the first film, but this second one left me with little more than a sore backside.
I:10370;1816;It was nice to see the cast grow in age as well as acting talent over the year.
I:10370;1817;The costuming was perfect, the special effects stunning.
I:10370;1818;More of everything that worked in the previous film, exciting villains, a mystery to solve and a thrilling climax that will make you ask, Is this really based on a kid's book?
I:10370;1819;Enjoyed beng able to watch at home without going to a store.
I:10370;1820;Full of magic, and excitement through and through.
I:10370;1821;These movies are a must see by all ages.
I:10370;1822;I've read all the books and I have been so enjoying the movies.
I:10370;1823;My grand children love them too.
I:10370;1824;Great work to jk rowlings for a job well done.
I:10370;1825;thanks to jk rowlings for giving us these great treasures to keep and enjoy over and over.
I:10370;1826;This being the case it often comes across as a lot of set pieces, which are impressive as standalones but aren't linked together very well.
I:10370;1827;Emma Watson as Hermione is fantastic though, again stealing every scene she's in, and Kevin Kline makes a highly enjoyable appearance as a fraudster magician.
I:10370;1828;Plus, for anyone who's scared of spiders, you'd best avert your eyes before Harry and Ron enter the woods.
I:10370;1829;As the movie ended I was filled with a sense of well being, Harry Potter and the chamber of Secrets is much better than the first film.
I:10370;1830;Richard Harris however is his wonderful self.
I:10370;1831;Go see the film it was great (two towers will be the one to wait for however), watch the film, but as a mark of respect wait until the credits finish and remember a great talented actor.
I:10370;1832;So i have to say, this is one of the rare times that I liked the movie better than the book.
I:10370;1833;Go check those out!The Chamber of Secrets explores Harry's second year at Hogwarts.
I:10370;1834;Harry and Co. can't help but get mixed into the problem and adventures abound!Characters:Daniel Radcliffe: Harry PotterRupert Grint: Ron WeasleyEmma Watson: Hermione GrangerKenneth Branagh: Gilderoy LockhartRobbie Coltrane: Rubeus HagridRichard Harris: Albus DumbledoreJason Isaacs: Lucius MalfoyAlan Rickman: Severus SnapeTom Felton: Draco MalfoyAs usual I thought the cast did a superb job.
I:10370;1835;Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson make a great team and have wonderful camaraderie on the set.
I:10370;1836;They certainly bring the wizards and witches of Harry Potter to life.
I:10370;1837;I also liked that they paid attention to the detail of the books down to the moving pictures and foods in the movie.
I:10370;1838;the cinematography was excellent, as usual.
I:10370;1839;It's amazing what they were able to do considering how much of the movie had to be generated and yet it still looks life like.
I:10370;1840;The music too is wonderful, and the instrumentals that accompany every Harry Potter movie are chilling yet exciting at the same time.
I:10370;1841;"Sorcerer's Stone went on to be the biggest worldwide hit of 2001 (and of all time next to Titanic) due in large part to the popularity of J. k. Rowling's hit series of books that it was based on, but as a film it easily stood up on its own merits combining the right amount of action, eye candy FX, humor and ""whodunit"" mystery intrigue."
I:10370;1842;"Chamber of Secrets keeps the tradition going, and then some!THE STORY:""Chamber of Secrets"" is the adaptation of J. k. Rowling's second book in the landmark Harry Potter series, the story of a boy wizard who through a twist of fate is locked in mortal combat with an evil wizard."
I:10370;1843;The world of Hogwarts is once again depicted just as grand as before, if not more so.
I:10370;1844;the actor's performances in this film are just brilliant.
I:10370;1845;"Harry vs. The ""Secret"" in the ChamberTHE ADAPTATION:Fans of the books will once again (or at least should) be pleased with this very true and near perfect translation of book to silver screen."
I:10370;1846;Once again, as movie adaptations of books go, the Harry Potter movies are almost as perfect as you'll get.
I:10370;1847;"tHE VERDICT:Overall, once again, if you are a fan of the series (or even if you are not), ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" should easily top the list of movies you should definitely see."
I:10370;1848;Fans of the book will appreciate seeing everything come to life and fans of great movies will marvel at all the action, humor and visual eye candy this one has to offer.
I:10370;1849;Great effects and the storyline has come to life just as you would expect.
I:10370;1850;i especially love the first few movies when they are young children.
I:10370;1851;Great movie for the entire family.
I:10370;1852;It would be nice if the next generation of potters had adventures to entertain us too!
I:10370;1853;I have not watched this yet, but I have seen the original release of Chamber of Secrets and loved it.
I:10370;1854;"I have seen the ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" feature on the Biography channel and loved it."
I:10370;1855;Would recommend this to all Harry Potter fans, old and new.
I:10370;1856;Again, I like the music.
I:10370;1857;"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a good sequel to ""Harry Potters and the Socerer's Stone""."
I:10370;1858;"Much like the first movie, ""Chamber of Secrets"" is full of magic and fantasy."
I:10370;1859;even though some of the scenes may have been a little too much for younger children, I would still recommend watching this film.
I:10370;1860;Amazon had a great price for this Blu.
I:10370;1861;Great movie for myself and wife and the kids enjoyed this follow up as well.
I:10370;1862;Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets was the best movie I have seen in a long while.
I:10370;1863;I love everything about Harry Potter, because I am kind of like him.
I:10370;1864;What I mean is that, I was adopted by some very nice people and i am now 13 almost 14 years old.
I:10370;1865;I love how Hermonie is a sweet and very smart girl, I wish I was just like her, I love how Ron is a very cute, and nicly mannered boy, he is very funny, and he would make a very nice, neat and cool friend.
I:10370;1866;I love to watch it over and over again.
I:10370;1867;Why i love Harry Potter is a queation that a I have to ask my self, i love it because it deals witha lot of problem that the reaL WORLD DOSE.
I:10370;1868;I Love the British Language, I have British in me.
I:10370;1869;He kept saying how much better this one was than the first.
I:10370;1870;From the opening credits with that wonderful music, to the final triumphant scenes, this movie was an absolute delight.
I:10370;1871;Anyone going into these things, expecting a perfect book.
I:10370;1872;i was particularly impressed with the performances of its three main stars, Daniel, Emma and Rupert.
I:10370;1873;They have definitely improved with age and experience.
I:10370;1874;Robbie Coltrane has also put across another fantastic performance as Hagrid .
I:10370;1875;I throughly enjoyed watching Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
I:10370;1876;The one star in the rating is for the soundtrack, the thing that was worth something in this movie .
I:10370;1877;The special effects with the Basilisk are excellent.
I:10370;1878;harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets picks up during Harry's summer holiday from Hogwarts.
I:10370;1879;His neglectful Aunt and Uncle are continuing their quest to try to stifle Harry's magical ability and force him to live a normal life.
I:10370;1880;Shockingly enough, our hero and his faithful friends must solve the mystery and of course, save the day.
I:10370;1881;There's also more Quiddich, a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and a few new characters are introduced that will play more integral parts in the series later on.
I:10370;1882;CGI work is improved on and doesn't show it's age quite as much as Sorcerer's Stone.
I:10370;1883;While they're are still some issues with some of the youth cast, most make at least moderate improvements.
I:10370;1884;Overall, most of the kids seem to feel a lot more comfortable in this film and that's important when they're the focus of the film.
I:10370;1885;Chamber of Secrets also introduces us to a few new adult characters that we'll see a lot more of in future films.
I:10370;1886;Throughout the books and to a lesser extent the films, fatherhood is an important underlying issue and these two characters represent the polar opposites on how to be a dad.
I:10370;1887;"Go ahead and take a deep breath and say to yourself, ""I won't see this character again for quite a few movies"" and move on."
I:10370;1888;overall, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a better film than Sorcerer's Stone.
I:10370;1889;Hardcore fans will argue that this is the purest film in the franchise due to how closely it follows the novel but what works on the page doesn't always translate well to the screen, so I wish the film would have deviated slightly from the book to make a involving film.
I:10370;1890;Sorcerer's Stone is blue and is labeled Year One and Chamber of Secrets is red and is labeled Year Two.
I:10370;1891;chamber of Secrets features the same Hi.
I:10370;1892;Only a year separates the first and second films but Chamber of Secrets has a better looking transfer than the first film.
I:10370;1893;Colors pop more, black levels are inkier, and detail is improved and more consistent.
I:10370;1894;Grain level is always appropriate and thankfully I didn't notice any use of DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) which if applied heavily can make people look like plastic or appear waxy.
I:10370;1895;Dialogue is always crystal clear even when the score or on.
I:10370;1896;Large chunks of this film are dialogue driven but when the action kicks into gear you'll notice impressive bass and good activity from the surround speakers.
I:10370;1897;as with the previous Potter Ultimate Edition, the Creating the World of Harry Potter documentary is the premiere special feature in this set.
I:10370;1898;Part II: Characters is an 80 minute long installment covering every character of mention in the Harry Potter series, not just those in Chamber of Secrets.
I:10370;1899;There's a good mix of interviews both new and old that delivers some great insight into not only how the characters have grown but how the actors have as well.
I:10370;1900;The documentary is filled with lots of behind the scenes footage and candid interviews from both the youth and adult cast.
I:10370;1901;This documentary series should be reason enough for some die hard fans invest in Ultimate Edition sets, they are right up there with the best documentaries I've seen offered on any Blu.
I:10370;1902;"I'm surprised these were not included on the Sorcerer's Stone set but because of the ""Characters"" documentary, they thought the screen tests were a good companion piece."
I:10370;1903;The third disc in our set is full of non.
I:10370;1904;If you made it through Sorcerer's Stone and are still interested in knowing what happens next to Harry and his friends then I think you'll enjoy Chamber of Secrets.
I:10370;1905;conclusionI highly recommend Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets especially if you're a Potter fanatic.
I:10370;1906;ray for about $10 and still get great video and audio minus the extended cut and documentary.
I:10370;1907;"About a couple of days ago, I managed to watch ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" at the movie theater."
I:10370;1908;"And let me just say that this second installment to last year's widely popular ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" is twice as good and even better than the first film!"
I:10370;1909;"You see, ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" was all about introduction and discovery, etc."
I:10370;1910;"But now, ""The Chamber of Secrets"" is when they jump right into the story (kind of like ""Lord of the Rings"")."
I:10370;1911;The Chamber of Secrets has a lot more humor and about 10 times as much action than the first film!
I:10370;1912;"And the direction of Chris Columbus (""Home Alone 1 and 2"", ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"") was excellent as always!"
I:10370;1913;"The performances from the very talented young stars Daniel Radcliffe (""The Tailor of Panama"", ""The Sorcerer's Stone""), Rupert Grint (""The Sorcerer's Stone""), and Emma Watson (""The Sorcerer's Stone"") were solid, commanding, and flawless in every way possible!"
I:10370;1914;"The performances from veteran actors Richard Harris (""Unforgiven""), Robbie Coltrane (""Alice in Wonderland""), Alan Rickman (""Die Hard""), Kenneth Branagh (""Wild Wild West""), John Cleese (007: ""Die Another Day""), Maggie Smith (""Gosford Park""), Julie Walters (""Billy Elliot""), and Jason Isaacs (""Black Hawk Down"") were outstanding as well!"
I:10370;1915;"The special effects of ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" were just as mesmerizing as the the special effects of ""The Sorcerer's Stone""!"
I:10370;1916;"And that is what I liked about him and the ""Potter"" films (kind of reminded me of Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""A. i."")."
I:10370;1917;"In conclusion, I think that ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" was the most challenging, most entertaining family film that I've seen since ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone""!"
I:10370;1918;"In fact, just watching ""The Chamber of Secrets"" will leave me with a feeling of going back and watching the first film again, especially since ""The Chamber of Secrets"" has great performances from a top."
I:10370;1919;notch cast, extraordinary special effects, laugh.
I:10370;1920;loud humor, and a powerful storyline!
I:10370;1921;The entire cast does another great job, the kids oftentimes outshining the adults, and the choices of newcomers to the wizarding world in Kenneth Branagh as Prof Lockhart is hilariously spot.
I:10370;1922;on and Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy dead brilliant.
I:10370;1923;the extras disc is always great fun, filled with great deleted scenes (some should have been kept in.
I:10370;1924;The others mercifully cut), and fun games.
I:10370;1925;Yes, I play them, and I'm 25.
I:10370;1926;the interviews could have been longer and more substantial for older viewers, but they're great to have as they are.
I:10370;1927;Just like all of the other Harry Potter books and movies, this one is wonderful as well.
I:10370;1928;The very concept was entirely fascinating and unexpected.
I:10370;1929;It was the first time Harry ever heard of Hogwarts or discovered his 'powers', as most people of today love to put it.
I:10370;1930;nevertheless, it is very imaginative, has good effects, and is almost very good, (if not compared with the first one).
I:10370;1931;My son will be enjoying this series of books/movies for the next few months!
I:10370;1932;I was happy that so much managed to get in to this movie.
I:10370;1933;i am happy to see as good a movie as this is.
I:10370;1934;But much to my delight, it wasn't.
I:10370;1935;Give or take a few scenes cut for length, the movie is extremely true to the book .
I:10370;1936;probably the best adaption I have ever seen.
I:10370;1937;the Harry Potter movies are great for children and adults!
I:10370;1938;It is absoultely pure story from beginning to end!
I:10370;1939;It is an extremely enchanting story with great actors!
I:10370;1940;And whoever cast so many wonderful actors in one movie should be given an important award or some type!
I:10370;1941;A great film for the whole family to watch!
I:10370;1942;This is one of the best movie from the Harry Potter collection.
I:10370;1943;Enjoy the enchanting tale and fantastic special effects.
I:10370;1944;Story Line is never boring and the actors are spectacular.
I:10370;1945;It had to introduce hundreds of thousands of people to this wizarding world, and it's hero, Harry Potter, and that took nearly an hour out of its running time.
I:10370;1946;All of these advantages over #1 should make this a better movie, right?Thankfully, it WAS.
I:10370;1947;"And above, written in what looks like blood, are written the words ""The Chamber of Secrets has been opened."""
I:10370;1948;Amazing the difference a year makes.
I:10370;1949;In Chamber of Secrets, they really clash!
I:10370;1950;Bonds are really made here, and some of the best scenes are when Malfoy's father (a Voldemort supporter) and Ron' s dad (a true wizard) talk.
I:10370;1951;He was holarious, loved to show off his teeth and get attention, and really played the clueless part well too!
I:10370;1952;Voldemort is brought to life in a scary way, and seeing all the petrified people, Harry hearing voices in the wall that NO ONE else can here.
I:10370;1953;Tom Riddle's Hermione like brilliance, all the mystery, suspense, and those spiders.
I:10370;1954;All of the acting combining with a suspeneseful story made this a better movie then the last.3) Graphics: Another huge improvement.
I:10370;1955;Hogwarts, while see mingconfined in the first movie, seems to come alive in this.
I:10370;1956;Even the blood and the big fight against Voldemort is all very exciting.
I:10370;1957;You really feel a lot more like your seeing Hogwarts the way J. k. Rowling saw it.
I:10370;1958;That helped capture the feeling, and continue the magical flame the first one lit!
I:10370;1959;And while this was a great movie, and nearly flawless in a lot of ways, it still lacked that and could still use something.
I:10370;1960;It has a lot of action, GREATgraphics, and superb acting in a lot of ways.
I:10370;1961;my favorite part of the movie had to by Kenneth Brannaugh (spelling?)
I:10370;1962;top but perfect in this case, played his role perfectly.
I:10370;1963;He fits the gentle, wise nature perfectly as the headmaster.
I:10370;1964;A minor complaint for a great movie.
I:10370;1965;elves is a good place to start.
I:10370;1966;a fun movie with good visual effects, and everything I expected to see.
I:10370;1967;The first movie and second movie seem just about as good, if not better than their counter.
I:10370;1968;In my opinion the first movie was better.
I:10370;1969;I really hope the third one is better.
I:10370;1970;I love the books a lot more and I was hoping any extended scenes would make it closer to the book.
I:10370;1971;It's only 13 minutes more but so worth it.
I:10370;1972;And I could be wrong but I am pretty sure I detected some touch ups.
I:10370;1973;Also my favorite touch up was when Malfoy called Hermonie a Mudblood for the first time.
I:10370;1974;I realized right away that this special features disk (3) is the same as her special edition disk which came out in what 2003.
I:10370;1975;The Socerers Stone, I was very impressed with the story line.
I:10370;1976;I must admit, I have refrained from reading the book so I can enjoy the movie, and I have to admit I dont regret not reading the book a bit.
I:10370;1977;Harry Potter, meets up with his old friends and the movie begins with many unexpected swirls and turns.
I:10370;1978;Also really liked the added bonus disc with the Making of Harry Potter.
I:10370;1979;The film is obviously made for fans of the book, and it follows the plot of the novel to a degree of exactitude that is rarely seen in Hollywood adaptations.
I:10370;1980;This is a testament to the good working relationship that is said to exist between book author J. k. Rowling and screenwriter Steve Cloves.
I:10370;1981;Working together they crafted a script that captures the adventure and wonder of the novel, and build on the already well.
I:10370;1982;Director Chris Colombus shows range here that he has not shown since his early days as a director, and he is obviously good with children, as all three main child actors turn in top.
I:10370;1983;Daniel Radcliffe especially has improved his acting ability since the first film, while the solid work from Emma Watson as Hermoine and Rupert Grint as Ron continues.
I:10370;1984;the film is darker in tone and plot, as lives are threatened and murder discussed, but it is also contains better effects, funnier lines, and maintains the sense of wonder that the first film created.
I:10370;1985;The adult actors are also excellent, with another strong turn by Alan Rickman as Prof. Snape and Robbie Coultrane keeps Hagrid interesting without becoming a charactaure.
I:10370;1986;The late Richard Harris also does a fine job as Prof. Dumbledore.
I:10370;1987;Branagh sends up his own flamboyant image and gets a lot of laughs as the not as clever as he thinks Lockhart.
I:10370;1988;as said before the special effects here are far superior to the first film, probably because they used ILM.
I:10370;1989;The production design is great, and the filmakers know when the setting should be dark or light.
I:10370;1990;throughs of classrooms ae included for the kids, and there is a pretty illuminating interview with JK Rowling and Steve Kloves, discussing the writing process.
I:10370;1991;Anyone who loves the books or loves fantasy should pick it up.
I:10370;1992;I really liked the first Harry Potter movie but I felt this one just doesn't live up to that.
I:10370;1993;The car arrives just at the right time.
I:10370;1994;Amazon, please get your act together on this.
I:10370;1995;Even as a grandmother, I love the Harry Potter series .
I:10370;1996;My children and I loved this second Harry Potter movie almost as much as the first.
I:10370;1997;this movie really captured the spirit of the book, in much the same way as the first movie did.
I:10370;1998;the magic has been captured superbly on the screen, and I love the character development.
I:10370;1999;the movie lends itself well to the small screen.
I:10370;2000;treat yourself to an experience by trying a Harry Potter book or movie.
I:10370;2001;They really are wonderful for children and adults alike.
I:10370;2002;I'm a Harry Potter fan and it surely is a very nice product!
I:10370;2003;It came in a perfect state, even though it was ordered from another country.
I:10370;2004;As with chamber of secrets there are alot of speacial effects and it's the sort of film that appeals to your inner child if you have one you'll love it and to be perfectly honest it does appeal to adults aswell, depending on what type of adult you are as in whether you like fantasy or anything like sci.
I:10370;2005;This time around, the actors seemed even more confident with themselves and as students.
I:10370;2006;I'm glad he had a chance to expand his role in this film, and whoever takes over the role is going to have some pretty big shoes to fill, but since the track record of the first two films has been established, I feel confident the right person will be chosen.
I:10370;2007;The second trilogy in the Harry Potter collection Harry is in his second year at Hogwarts along with his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.
I:10370;2008;Really liked the Harry Potter series.
I:10370;2009;Great entertainment and great acting as well as a family oriented Movie.
I:10370;2010;It's got a piece of all those wonderful things i've read in other books combined together to form this surprisingly epic story.
I:10370;2011;The movies always begin on the light side, fun esp.
I:10370;2012;for kids, but by the end it becomes so much more as the real heart of the story is revealed.
I:10370;2013;i liked the first movie a lot (i LOVE the chess scene), but this one is definitely the winner.
I:10370;2014;Honestly, I have to ask this question.
I:10370;2015;I am a huge fan of the books.
I:10370;2016;They explained a lot, and they met my expectations each time, getting steadily better and better than its predecessor.
I:10370;2017;"During the first one I thought at the end, ""Okay."
I:10370;2018;Hardly any good book is transformed into a good movie, with the possible execption of Lord of the Rings.
I:10370;2019;Its gigantic, luminous yellow eyes were transformed into tiny, beady, red eyes.
I:10370;2020;He has two faces, one with a toothy grin, the other a glaring scowl.
I:10370;2021;I expected her to be funny looking and ugly) Draco tries too hard, but Lucius Malfoy was actually pretty good.
I:10370;2022;He also won an award for the music he did in The Fast and the Furious.
I:10370;2023;They have the characters saying extra lines that are not only cheesy but are also designed to make a five year old laugh, and only five year olds.
I:10370;2024;I tolerated some of the things, but honestly!
I:10370;2025;Rowling herself makes the books funnier in the future by adding wit.
I:10370;2026;The product was what I ordered and came in a timely manner.
I:10370;2027;I love Harry, read all the books and was dying to see this, well, I've seen it 3 times already, going for a fourth pretty soon and I have to say, the action, the surroundings, everything is perfect again.
I:10370;2028;I think some people will enjoy it more because it's much faster, you have to pay attention to be able to stick with the story, cause it's so filled with little bits and pieces and loads of action.
I:10370;2029;A big thumbs up on this one again!!!
I:10370;2030;Even though its a young adult novel, it is appealing to the adults for the exciting suspense and decision making process Harry goes through.
I:10370;2031;Great movie, as all Harry Potter movies are.
I:10370;2032;My daughter even loves this movie and is beginnig to become a Harry Potter fan like her mom!
I:10370;2033;The movie is a classic and anyone who loves the books should really own all the films.
I:10370;2034;"Great to watch the ""classics"" with my little sister."
I:10370;2035;as for the movie itself, it is a wonderful family film.
I:10370;2036;acting is adorable and genuine, sets lustrous, soundtrack magical.
I:10370;2037;"After the great success of ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" I was greatly looking foward to seeing ""Chamber of Secrets."""
I:10370;2038;Chris Columbus once again captured the magical world of Harry Potter.
I:10370;2039;The amazing settings, te characters, and the new creatures was all amazing.
I:10370;2040;He recreated the most amazing scenes from the book perfectly.
I:10370;2041;columbus is a great director and he should have directed the thrid movie.
I:10370;2042;Will the three friends be able to find the secret behind the chamber of secrets, and clear the good name of Harry Potter?Not being a real fan of the Harry Potter series, I have not read the books.
I:10370;2043;I had found the first Harry Potter to be really interesting with its fun story and interesting theme.
I:10370;2044;Well, the special effects and some masterful action sequences may help to keep kids occupied, but I think the teens and adult crowd may have found it a bit tedious.
I:10370;2045;Daniel Radcliffe has certainly grown up since the first film and handles his character very well.
I:10370;2046;It was a bit surprising for me to see that this movie is aimed for younger children.
I:10370;2047;I can see how some may say how this movie shows very good morals, I must point out some conflicting points on this subject.
I:10370;2048;The good points of the movie include: 1) some good morals are shown, mostly about strong friendship and good triumphing over evil, 2) pretty good acting, nothing dramatic but still pretty good, 3) terrific effects, and 4) some nice action scenes.
I:10370;2049;In my opinion, this is the best movie in the Harry Potter franchise!
I:10370;2050;It's darker and has a great storyline.
I:10370;2051;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets builds on what the first film did right and improves some of what it did wrong, providing an overall enjoyable, magical film for all ages.
I:10370;2052;with the opportunity this time to launch right into the story without the set.
I:10370;2053;With deeper voices and early signs of becoming full fledged teenagers, the trio is becoming a group of talented youth.
I:10370;2054;It seems that great things will come from them in subsequent films.
I:10370;2055;filled Gilderoy Lockhart and Jason Issacs as the evil Lucious Malfoy both vividly recreate two of the novel's great secondary characters.
I:10370;2056;The late Richard Harris is also great in his small but important and final role as headmaster.
I:10370;2057;book Potter series is considered the weakest by most fans and critics, and much of the problems of the book are nearly unavoidable in the transfer to film.
I:10370;2058;what I find most enjoyable in Chamber of Secrets is the darker tone of the story line.
I:10370;2059;There are moments here that promise the series will become more disturbing in subsequent films, a process that will help the films avoid becoming stale retreads of each other.
I:10370;2060;for those that enjoyed the first Potter film, this one will more than live up to your expectations, providing another wonderful look into this magical world.
I:10370;2061;I really enjoyed this chapter in Harry Potter's life.
I:10370;2062;It has wonderful elements of suspense and action.
I:10370;2063;A wonderful movie for children and adults alike!
I:10370;2064;If you liked the book, you will love the movie!
I:10370;2065;Very true to the book, and the graphics and scenery are even more spectacular than the first movie.
I:10370;2066;A must have for all Harry Potter fans!
I:10370;2067;I was a fan of the first Harry Potter film (released in 2001), but thought this one was even better.
I:10370;2068;For those who have'nt read the book, the film offers you a chance to really get to know the characters.
I:10370;2069;Which means a great action sequence!
I:10370;2070;because the characters are a year older, the story is more intence, mysterious, and exciting then in the original.
I:10370;2071;Making this a wonderful sequel.
I:10370;2072;All of the main characters are back, along with some new ones!
I:10370;2073;And this is a great chance to see the late Richard Harris, as Dumbledore, in his final role.
I:10370;2074;This is one of the few movies based on a book that actually follows the book!
I:10370;2075;For all Harry Potter fans,this is a must have!
I:10370;2076;A compelling story, but with too much in.your.
I:10370;2077;Overall, certainly worth seeing, but not as good as the first.
I:10370;2078;I thought this movie was really good .
I:10370;2079;I would strongly recommend this movie to any Harry Potter fan.
I:10370;2080;It is fun to go back and watch the earlier movies and see Daniel ratliffe and the others as little kids and then watch them grow up again through the movies.
I:10370;2081;Let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.
I:10370;2082;Great performances again by Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Alan Rickman.
I:10370;2083;Kenneth Brannagh does well as the new DADA teacher: Prof. Lockhart.
I:10370;2084;Jason Issacs is wonderfully cast as Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father.
I:10370;2085;Another great screenplay by Steve Kloves and great direction by Columbus.
I:10370;2086;This movie is far above the first.
I:10370;2087;This movie is an utter masterpiece.
I:10370;2088;This movie also introduces some new characters.
I:10370;2089;the movie also has a great cast.
I:10370;2090;There's a tiny creature classified as a house.
I:10370;2091;Coupled with Ron's snide and sarcastic remarks, this movie delivers several spots that encourage hilarity.
I:10370;2092;the storyline is solid and complete with its own twists and turns, which is mastered, of course, by J. k Rowling.
I:10370;2093;The book, naturally, is better than the movie.
I:10370;2094;They did a really good job on the speacial effects and the cast did a really good job delivering their lines.
I:10370;2095;Harry, Hermione, and Ron Weasley return to the screen with yet another adventure, bigger and better than ever, as they begin their second year at Hogwarts.
I:10370;2096;With a veritable flick of his magic wand, director Chris Columbus offers up Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second chapter in the on.
I:10370;2097;going saga of everybodys favorite young wizard, who is joined this time around by a new instructor (teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts), as well as some formidable new opponents.
I:10370;2098;Harry knows the answers can be found in the Chamber of Secrets, but the questions persist: What is it, exactly, and where can it be found?As if channeling the spirit and imagination of author J. k. Rowling (in whose heart Harry Potter was born), director Columbus brings this film vividly to life in a swirl of excitement and colorful characters.
I:10370;2099;He sets a perfect pace that will keep even the youngest members of the audience enthralled, and his transitions are impeccable, always moving the story forward with nary a single lull or hesitation.
I:10370;2100;Its a film that will grab you in the opening frames and sweep!
I:10370;2101;written for the screen by Steven Kloves (adapted from the novel by Rowling), the story is compelling, the dialogue is fresh and crisp and, as expected, the special F/X are the absolute best.
I:10370;2102;And Columbus uses it all to great effect, aided in no small part by the exemplary work of film editor Peter Honess, the original score by William Ross and John Williams, Roger Pratts brilliant cinematography, and last, but certainly not least, the engaging performances turned in by his young stars and veteran performers alike.Young Daniel Radcliffes portrayal of Harry is so complete and natural that, simply put, he IS, and will forever be, Harry Potter.
I:10370;2103;He has a gift, and if he uses it wisely, he has a long and successful career ahead of him.
I:10370;2104;Though without a doubt they will always be associated with these characters, they have the kind of talent that should take them successfully beyond their Potter personas.
I:10370;2105;kenneth Branagh gives a delightful performance as Gilderoy Lockhart, the new instructor at Hogwarts, whose self.
I:10370;2106;importance has made him a legend in his own mind.

I:10370;2108;With very little screen time, she manages to make a decided connection with the audience, which makes her an effective and integral part of the story.
I:10370;2109;I love the books and the movies of this series.
I:10370;2110;JK Rowling is a wonderful writer and story teller and these actors are wonderful in the movies.
I:10370;2111;Great help to get correct item.
I:10370;2112;I am sure you loved the first Harry Potter movie.
I:10370;2113;The phoenix, is simply beautiful inside the Chamber of Secrets, and it goes perfectly with the book.
I:10370;2114;There is excitement in the movie as well, as you will be able to feel, as the dark plot of the movie goes along.
I:10370;2115;I hope you found this review helpful.
I:10370;2116;My oldest daughter (now 18) really enjoyed then but my two other kids did not.
I:10370;2117;This is a very clever story that continues on with the same characters from the first (although a tad older now.
I:10370;2118;first rate production values AND a real surprise.6.1 dolby digital.
I:10370;2119;This is a fun movie with lots of surprises and real dastardly people.
I:10370;2120;Great for the Harry Potter fans that would like there own library.
I:10370;2121;A classic to have for all harry potter fans.
I:10370;2122;I thought the first one was great, but this one is even better.
I:10370;2123;As you all know i'm not a fan of special effects but so far in both films the special effects are briliant and believable.
I:10370;2124;I hope these kids do well in their careers of acting and continue this trade when they get older.
I:10370;2125;Great job done by all involved in this production.
I:10370;2126;I loved the book, and was determined to love the movie.
I:10370;2127;the film does the book every bit of justice it deserved.
I:10370;2128;the effects were great, the casting was great, everything about this movie was great.
I:10370;2129;kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart was especially delightful.
I:10370;2130;He pulled off the roll flawlessly and added a great bit of humor to the film in his own acting style.
I:10370;2131;If you loved the book you will love the movie just as much, perhaps even more!
I:10370;2132;And make sure you stay for the special clip that plays once the movie credits have finished rolling by at the end!
I:10370;2133;She liked it but I HATED it.
I:10370;2134;All of the Harry Potter Movies are great and capture the main themes and scenes from the books.
I:10370;2135;These movies got my son reading this series and he is well past 2,000 pages now and is finally an avid reader.
I:10370;2136;Yes, they are double dipping on this release (which is one of the reasons I think the price is relatively low), but I think it is worth it considering the fact that we are getting the extended edition of the film in blu.
I:10370;2137;The extra footage makes a *LOT* of scenes make more sense with those scenes back in!
I:10370;2138;You will encounter scenes that expand your understanding of the films like that all over the extended edition.
I:10370;2139;They also do in depth interviews, and show stuff we have never seen before.
I:10370;2140;ray, and I love the extras.
I:10370;2141;The collection also comes with a digital addition of the movie.
I:10370;2142;copy that is streamed from Amazon has a cool color temp to it , dark.
I:10370;2143;unlike the previous Chamber of Secrets which had terrific color .
I:10370;2144;ON the bright side this makes for a very enjoyable watch.
I:10370;2145;So when we do watch it, there is a lot that I don't remember, which is a delightful re.
I:10370;2146;There is no question that this is the best modern series of kids films that adults can also enjoy.
I:10370;2147;The way the kids grow, the wisdom of such amazingly wonderful characters like Dumbledore, and the struggle against evil never ceases to captivate me.
I:10370;2148;This is a fun movie even though it suffers from some of the vices of the first movie in the series and not participating in the virtues of the subsequent films.
I:10370;2149;In particular, Daniel Radcliffe evidences enormous improvement as an actor.
I:10370;2150;And because there is less set up in this one than in the first film, they are able to delve more directly into storytelling.
I:10370;2151;Any adaptation of a novel by a movie has to make compromises.
I:10370;2152;Few parts of the screenplay resonate with other parts of the screenplay.
I:10370;2153;luckily, the movies got much, much better.
I:10370;2154;THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is by any standard a great film, the best directed film in the series, while the later films were buoyed by very substantive stories.
I:10370;2155;That is pretty much par for the course.
I:10370;2156;Great Acting By The Cast, And Very Much In Tact With The Book.
I:10370;2157;Its A Great Familyt Movie Full Of Scary Surprises, And Alot Of Comedic Standpoints.
I:10370;2158;This One Will Surely Stand The Test Of Time In Movies.
I:10370;2159;A wonderful movie that my daughter enjoys watching too.
I:10370;2160;The effects are amazing and the story line is superb.
I:10370;2161;It it was cool i like ir very much.
I:10370;2162;In this new film, we miss that air of freshness and novelty .
I:10370;2163;"As compensation, ""Chamber of Secrets"" offers a better overall storyline and a greater sense of mystery."
I:10370;2164;who of wonderful British performers to flesh out his enormous gallery of characters.
I:10370;2165;Of the seasoned veterans, the late Richard Harris (in what turns out to be his final screen appearance in fact) brings a quiet dignity to the role of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, and Maggie Smith provides just the proper balance of humanity and stiff.
I:10370;2166;"in the special effects department, ""Chamber of Secrets"" does a first."
I:10370;2167;rate job bringing much of the story's magic to life on the screen.
I:10370;2168;The superb art direction and set design help to create an entire world where witchcraft and sorcery are commonplace occurrences.
I:10370;2169;Cinematographer Roger Platt brings a nice burnished glow to the film's look, particularly in the castle interiors, which always seem to be lit by soft candlelight.
I:10370;2170;"John Williams' musical score never hits the heights of his great works (""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""E. t."" etc.), but it is adequate to the task at hand."
I:10370;2171;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets won't exactly carry you away in the way that the great fantasy films invariably do, but it does make for a couple of diverting hours nonetheless.
I:10370;2172;If you've read the books and seen the first movie you just gotta' see the second movie.
I:10370;2173;The special effects are amazing and have improved a little since the first movie.
I:10370;2174;This movie is a WHOLE lot more intense then the first.
I:10370;2175;I'm glued, and I know you will be to if you see this movie.
I:10370;2176;I really enjoyed The Chambers of Secrets.
I:10370;2177;The script was mostly good, but the actors and actresses were great!
I:10370;2178;They really bring the books to life!
I:10370;2179;"Me and my buddie Micheal Jackson cauhght this flick in the cinemas and thought ""WOW this is the greatest action flick ever!"""
I:10370;2180;These bonus releases are awesome,but come on we love the movies why do these studios keep making us shell out for two sets of the movies we love.
I:10370;2181;oh well these are really great and the extra scenes really do fill in the plot well enough to have been kept in the movie.
I:10370;2182;It is absolutely worth the extra money just to have all of these fantastic Blu ray box sets.
I:10370;2183;The features are incredible and the content is, obviously, superb.
I:10370;2184;The kids just got into Harry Potter and they are enjoying it!
I:10370;2185;They will continue to follow the stories.
I:10370;2186;very good movie but I just wished it showed WHY Ron was scared of spiders.
I:10370;2187;"I know people liked the films, but if you want to watch a good ""movie"" ."
I:10370;2188;I'm really hoping the new director working on Book 3 does a better job.
I:10370;2189;funny in the book when you can use your imagination, but disgusting when detailed so graphically in the film).
I:10370;2190;and I'm done with the films.
I:10370;2191;the special effects and the imaginative ground, I think, are great: great sound effects, moving images in pictures, talking letter, flying cars.
I:10370;2192;"For a kid I think that the movie is good
I:10370;2193;The only part that of the movies that I liked lies in a idea about determination to do whatever we want: when Harry Potter and Professor Dubledore discuss that Harry should have been in another school instead of Gryffindorf, but that his determination rewarded what he really wanted.
I:10370;2194;It goes without saying the second installment in the Harry Potter series is a great film.
I:10370;2195;Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are also back as Ron Weasly and Hermione Granger, a great relief!
I:10370;2196;The movie premieres November 15th and I can assure you that will be a big red circle on my calender.
I:10370;2197;My gratitude to Rowling for a superb series, hope she can live up to her last book, thanks for reading,.
I:10370;2198;Worth the extra money for the extended version of the movie.
I:10370;2199;As far as following the main storyline of the novel and the dialogue, it is an excellent carry over.
I:10370;2200;if you enjoyed the novels or the first film, then this is a must see.
I:10370;2201;While the Sorcerer's Stone was rightly so as a ridiculously faithful movie adaptation of Rowling's wonderful book, this movie is more than an adaptation of the so.
I:10370;2202;so book sequel: it firmly establishes a new fantasy series that can only get better with age.
I:10370;2203;It's fun, fantastic, creepy, and a surprise detective.
I:10370;2204;style mystery that keeps you hooked even if you've read the book three or four previous times.
I:10370;2205;"the special effects are superior, the acting is leagues improved over its predecessor (both by the child stars and impressive British supporting cast
I:10370;2206;It was such a great movie, and I am so excited to see the next one!!
I:10370;2207;I am sure it will be just as good as the last one, if not better.
I:10370;2208;The same familiar cast provides a pleasant and exciting movie.
I:10370;2209;Greatly entertaining for the whole family.
I:10370;2210;loved the series and was working on completing my set.
I:10370;2211;Movie was perfect for the whole family.
I:10370;2212;FOTR also includes a nice voiceover commentary by the actors and filmmakers which is like sitting in a cinema with them all whispering behind the scenes secrets in your ear.
I:10370;2213;Now, THAT is an enhanced movie experience.
I:10370;2214;at least you can enjoy a lovely Harris.
I:10370;2215;dumbledore illustration on the top side.
I:10370;2216;Obviously, I love all the Harry Potter movies, this one included.
I:10370;2217;Still is a great movie, and is one of the standards in my collection.
I:10370;2218;It's fun and interesting to see the development of the actors since the first movie.
I:10370;2219;I usually dont like movies like this, but it was VERY good!
I:10370;2220;The mystery is very well put together so it's definitely worth owning to complete the collection.
I:10370;2221;I order this movie on a Black Friday sale for an excellent price.
I:10370;2222;The action is a bit livelier, with some unpredictable jolts that can shake a viewer in a dark room.
I:10370;2223;The producers manage to keep the plot entertaining for a range of ages by peppering it with adult humor, as well as ageless action scenes.
I:10370;2224;unless the name Harry Potter draws a scowl from a family member, most any person with children, or the heart of a child, will want to add this movie to their collection.
I:10370;2225;The movie is wonderfully true to Rowling's book and is every bit as charming.
I:10370;2226;The second year at Hogwarts brings more adventure and danger to Harry, Hermione and Ron.
I:10370;2227;The movie should delight any child from 10 and up, but adults should enjoy it equally.
I:10370;2228;we saw the movie on opening night, this movie is the best sequil i have ever seen.
I:10370;2229;I think Harry Potter is a great movie!
I:10370;2230;It gives me a good idea how life is at Hogwarts.
I:10370;2231;And Ron for example is just a scaredy cat with a human body, but again I don't know your opinion?!
I:10370;2232;And don't forget Harry who I think is a handsome hunk that saves the day all the time!
I:10370;2233;But it's still a good movie!
I:10370;2234;Soon your wish comes true!
I:10370;2235;the Chamber of Secrets reunites the original cast from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
I:10370;2236;This film, which is somewhat darker than the first, also features much of the supporting cast.
I:10370;2237;still, this is a delightful, fun film, full of beautiful imagery and lavish special effects.
I:10370;2238;For anyone looking for a fun movie to be enjoyed by the whole family, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a delightful film full of magic, friendship and an adventure that will keep audiences coming back for more!Scott Kolecki
I:10370;2239;darker than the first film, with more mature characters and a less golly gee scripts, this film is more intelligent, more exciting, and better.
I:10370;2240;this movie inspired me to read the books, and I must say, I am impressed with the filmmaker's ability to stay faithful to the story while still presenting an entertaining film.
I:10370;2241;Chamber of Secrets is a worthy second installment in the film versions of J. k. Rowling's fantastic Harry Potter series.
I:10370;2242;Building on the foundation so expertly laid in Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber delves deeper into Harry's journey of discovery and danger.
I:10370;2243;Chamber opens with Harry back with his loathesome family, the Dursleys, the most hilariously despicable collection of Muggles one could imagine.
I:10370;2244;Chamber is a more mature work than Sorcerer's Stone.
I:10370;2245;The special effects are better (the Quidditch match is amazing!)
I:10370;2246;While you may wish that Professor Snape and everyone's favorite groundskeeper, Hagrid, had more screen time, the story is a delight.
I:10370;2247;All in all, a worthy adaptation of a great book.
I:10370;2248;The games may be a little amateurish for all but the youngest fans, but they are still a hoot.
I:10370;2249;There are additional scenes that actually add to the story.
I:10370;2250;the additional footage will be of interest to those that would like the movie to come closer to the book, and will add a little help understanding the details for those who have yet to read them.
I:10370;2251;movie) features are entertaining also.
I:10370;2252;I especially like the deleted scenes and the interviews with the main characters, but found all of the added features and the included book to be interesting and add to the experience.
I:10370;2253;if you are a HP fan, you will love the collectors editions.
I:10370;2254;If you aren't yet, you just may become a big HP fan!
I:10370;2255;I think that this movie followed the book in almost every aspect and they did a very nice job with it.
I:10370;2256;Anyone who enjoyed the first movie will love this and anyone who enjoyed the books will enjoy this movie as well.
I:10370;2257;Bought it for my daughter and we watched it as a family in our Entertainment Room.
I:10370;2258;The movie was alright overall but I would definitely recommend the book over the movie.
I:10370;2259;I thought Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is better than the first movie.
I:10370;2260;So if you think the first movie is good, watch the second.
I:10370;2261;This movie is a great combination of thriller, fantasy, and british comedy!
I:10370;2262;It includes the most important aspects of the book and director Chris Columbus brings his charming style to an already incredible fantasy world!
I:10370;2263;the story is darker,the acting is better(Daniel Radcliffe seems more relaxed as Harry this time),and the visuals are WAY better than they were in the first one!!!!!!!!!
I:10370;2264;See this if you are a fan of the books or if you like the first one!!!!!!!!!!!
I:10370;2265;Chris Columbus has done it again!
I:10370;2266;The Chamber of Secrets is even better than its predecessor.
I:10370;2267;It has more humor and action than before.
I:10370;2268;The music captures the moment in almost every scene.
I:10370;2269;The basilisk and Fawkes look absolutely real and the visuals have improved.
I:10370;2270;packed and the scene in which Harry fights the basilisk is thrilling.
I:10370;2271;I simply love this film.
I:10370;2272;My daughter will always love Harry Potter!
I:10370;2273;It was funny, exciting, and scary at the same time.
I:10370;2274;I have these movies and love them.
I:10370;2275;I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and I felt that this movie improved drastically over the first.
I:10370;2276;The cast was, of course, excellent, and the sets wonderful, but the film was so predictable in every aspect that watching it was a tedious chore.
I:10370;2277;Chamber of Secrets is of course the adaptation of the second book in the successful Harry Potter series, and finds the gang at Hogwarts racing to uncover a great evil that has been released upon the students again.
I:10370;2278;In terms of translating the book to film, 'Chamber' is much more successful than the original, if only because the story is more focused and there is a stronger, hands.
I:10370;2279;on climax that gives Harry something to do.
I:10370;2280;The film presentation is solid.
I:10370;2281;Not a huge ton of stuff, but worth checking out.
I:10370;2282;In all, Chamber of Secrets is a successful continuation of the movie franchise.
I:10370;2283;I really enjoy the Harry Potter books and have found all the movies to date just as enjoyable.
I:10370;2284;I love the Harry Potter series, both the books and the movies.
I:10370;2285;why?Quite frankly, the movie is a marvelous fairy tale to watch, with the action scenes (the duels are excellent!)
I:10370;2286;and some of the key points displayed quite perfectly and loyally to the book.
I:10370;2287;Good points: Excellent effects, true to the book, covers the major plot points by and large.
I:10370;2288;A good adaption for a movie from a book, and with what they could work with.
I:10370;2289;Moaning Myrtle was particularly well done, as were the excellent duels.
I:10370;2290;overall, I definitely recommend seeing it.
I:10370;2291;the acting is well done, it's filmed well, and it's one action shot after another, with good jokes and plenty of the magic of the first.
I:10370;2292;It's just not there, and what makes the books so magical is the subplots that wind through it, tying it all together.
I:10370;2293;The acting is improved and new additions to the cast do an excellent job at taking their roles to the screen.
I:10370;2294;it is a very good adaptation of the book as the parts of the book that are omitted are the parts that would be least suited to film.
I:10370;2295;term banquet at the end.
I:10370;2296;i think this is one of the best films in the franchise and I think the films went slightly downhill after this without Chris Columbus as the director.
I:10370;2297;This is the perfect movie for the whole family!
I:10370;2298;We love all of the books and movies.
I:10370;2299;It is fun to escape to Harry's world for awhile.
I:10370;2300;You know, where you hold your hand out and kind of move it like a teeter.
I:10370;2301;It's dang good, don't get me wrong.
I:10370;2302;She is one of my heroes, even if she is a single mother.
I:10370;2303;But I know I'll never be as rich as her, no matter how many fantastic books I've written.
I:10370;2304;the kids in this movie do a wonderful job bringing these characters to life.
I:10370;2305;The special effects are first rate, too, and a feast for the eyes.
I:10370;2306;My kids are older now but I still like to watch them very Halloween .
I:10370;2307;puts me in the spirit!
I:10370;2308;I read each book with my two boys, then we watch the movie!
I:10370;2309;My youngest thought the second book and this movie was better than the first!
I:10370;2310;Really brings the book to life.
I:10370;2311;My six year old and I watched it after finishing the book, and if was fun to compare the two.
I:10370;2312;Daniel Radcliffe and the rest of the gang deliver great performances and the special effects are far and beyond the first movie.
I:10370;2313;I hope the next movie can live up to this.
I:10370;2314;You'll enjoy it a lot more if you've read the book.
I:10370;2315;They did a really good job putting this movie together and I would definitely recommend watching it.
I:10370;2316;the books are great and the movies are fun.
I:10370;2317;the kids will love it and I find that a lot of adults do to.
I:10370;2318;I thought that this movie stayed pretty true to the book.
I:10370;2319;i love the characters, and it is so wonderful to actually see things on the screen.
I:10370;2320;It was so great that all the characters from the first movie were also in this one.
I:10370;2321;All in all, it's another great edition to the Harry Potter movie series!
I:10370;2322;This movie did a great job but I kindof thought that Voldemort tords the end could have been meaner if you know what I mean.
I:10370;2323;The second film in the Harry Potter series is another excellent book adaptation.
I:10370;2324;all combine to bring Hogwarts to life once more.
I:10370;2325;Kid born to two witches has his life saved by his mother sacrificing her life.
I:10370;2326;This pretty much sums up the Harry Potter movies, which this review comments on.
I:10370;2327;After all, all of these stories mimic the original.
I:10370;2328;And to do it in a way that is anti.
I:10370;2329;This is a fun movie and it is fun to watch how the relationships have changed and grown from the first movie.
I:10370;2330;A fantasy that will draw you in to the story.
I:10370;2331;It's fun with just enough mystery and intrigue to keep you interested.
I:10370;2332;It's a great movie to share with the whole family.
I:10370;2333;The acting was wonderful by our 3 main stars.
I:10370;2334;so and I don't know the man who played Lucious Malfoy but he was perfect.
I:10370;2335;What a fine performance for his last film.
I:10370;2336;The special effects are outstanding.
I:10370;2337;i liked the further character development.
I:10370;2338;You see what a wonderful and loving family Ron Weesley comes from.
I:10370;2339;for the first movie, I saw the movie first and then read the book.
I:10370;2340;For this story, I read the book first and then saw the movie.
I:10370;2341;"if you haven't had the opportunity to see ""The Chamber of Secrets"", please go and see it."
I:10370;2342;It's a treat for the eyes, mind and soul.
I:10370;2343;Excellent movie for the whole family to enjoy.
I:10370;2344;Az enjoyable has the first.
I:10370;2345;we love how the characterscome into their own.
I:10370;2346;Columbus and company treat the text with respect, and do a good job of translating to the film medium.
I:10370;2347;My eleven yr old is loving it.
I:10370;2348;I think Fluffy is really funny name for three.
I:10370;2349;some people don't realize, but a director holds the movie together, not here.
I:10370;2350;I think this movie is excellent.
I:10370;2351;I thought it was a little more suspenseful and I found it to be a lot more funnier than the first movie.
I:10370;2352;Better (more interesting plot), faster pace, more magic stuff.
I:10370;2353;If you loved the Sorcerer's Stone, you will find this one better in all aspects.
I:10370;2354;I admire the HP movies for keeping the actors and letting them grow with the films.
I:10370;2355;and in that sense it makes their earlier work more bearable.
I:10370;2356;the movie is still quite enjoyable, with its fair moments of humor (watch for Ron and the spiders!)
I:10370;2357;Harry Potter movies are the best series of movies ever.
I:10370;2358;I'm very happy to be adding the ultimate collections to my ever expanding library of movies.
I:10370;2359;This movie was definately a great work of theatre and art alike.
I:10370;2360;The entire movie was captivating, and while the director, Christopher Columbus, could of done better on some parts, this movie does what most do not, and it stayed true to the book.
I:10370;2361;I loved this, and I watched it about 3 times before I was satisfied with it!
I:10370;2362;Go get the movie and see it, and you'll see what I mean!!!
I:10370;2363;The scenes with the Chammber of Secrets were beautifully detailed, giving you a clearer picture than even the book did!
I:10370;2364;Overall a really good movie for kids.
I:10370;2365;The serpant really got me fired up and I enjoyed watching Harry strike Malfoy at the dueling match.
I:10370;2366;I give this film 4 stars.
I:10370;2367;And knowing that most of the other reviews are going to have about two main quibbles with the movie, which is 1) This movie rocks!
I:10370;2368;to answer the POV #1, yes, this movie is VERY, VERY good!
I:10370;2369;Something about Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets drew me to see it more often than the Sorcerer's Stone/Philosopher's Stone Movie.
I:10370;2370;The pace in the COS movie was faster and more linear than the first movie, the actors (especially Dan, Rupert, and Emma) were very much improved (as were the special effects), and it was just more exciting and fun to watch.
I:10370;2371;, during Christmas, and just after Harry leaves the study hall.
I:10370;2372;To summarize, this movie is definitely one for your collection because of the fun and adventure of it.
I:10370;2373;It's very enjoyable and just scary enough to have fun squealling.
I:10370;2374;I enjoyed this movie immensely.
I:10370;2375;The actors do such a fantastic job.
I:10370;2376;i enjoyed this film a great deal, it is not as bogged down as the first with introducing everyone and all the escapades.
I:10370;2377;the extras on the second disk are very nicely done, just enough to tempt, but not enough to completely satisfy.
I:10370;2378;touring Dumbledore's office was particulary well done and viewing all the sleeping portraits made you feel like you were right there.
I:10370;2379;i like seeing how things develope from drawing to final product.
I:10370;2380;the interview with JK Rowling and the Steve Kloves (script writer) was very informative and enjoyable.
I:10370;2381;i would give this five stars, but I would love to see more, more, more behind the scenes interviews.
I:10370;2382;(See my review on the Philosopher's Stone)What has happened in the time between the two Harry Potter movies?
I:10370;2383;The Lord of the Rings has happened!
I:10370;2384;And did they have this amazing, over.
I:10370;2385;"top achievement in CGI, called ""the Gollum""?"
I:10370;2386;borrowing a lot of elements from the horror genre, this one hopes to bring some chills to the children of the globe with the amazing MPAA looking completely the other way.
I:10370;2387;bike and the Stormtroopers chasing her.
I:10370;2388;And of course, the Hint of a love game, between NOT him that has the power, but the goofy sidekick, and the girl.
I:10370;2389;(She is 9 for christ's sake!)
I:10370;2390;And last but not least.
I:10370;2391;A great deal of Hogwarts history, Harrys origins and the early life of Lord Voldemort is revealed plus there is a higher proportion of giant monsters in the film than one would have anticipated.
I:10370;2392;A real treat is the addition of the great Jason Isaacs as the wicked Lucious Malfoy.
I:10370;2393;The film is well directed, consistently exciting, imaginitive and with more than one scene of genuine fear and terror.
I:10370;2394;A solid addition to the series that will impell the viewer to continue to the next chapter.
I:10370;2395;with an improved cast (Kenneth Branagh provides his talents as the narcissistic Gilderoy Lockhart and Jason Issacs as the malicious Lucius Malfoy) and better script (more time with Harry alone instead of with Ron and Hermione) makes this movie more enjoyable for adults while still providing fun for children.
I:10370;2396;the set designs are quite interesting and the creatures sometimes disturbing.
I:10370;2397;The Harry Potter saga started as a group of runaway best selling books, and then they turned the books into movies.
I:10370;2398;They also stay TRUE to the storyline which is very important to a majority of people.
I:10370;2399;Best Regards to All, MC .
I:10370;2400;The effects are a bit scary at times.
I:10370;2401;So I would recommend this to an 11 year old, perhaps.
I:10370;2402;But the story was engaging, just like the books are.
I:10370;2403;But I think the second film was a huge improvement.
I:10370;2404;It grabbed and kept my attention.
I:10370;2405;He was good as Dumbledore.
I:10370;2406;Michael Gambon will be good.
I:10370;2407;It's a well written series that is fun for the whole family.
I:10370;2408;I've read all the Harry Potter books and loved them.
I:10370;2409;LAst year I went to go to se the first movie Sorserer's Stone it was good but could have been better some good things that made the book so charming.
I:10370;2410;The whole of the movie wa smuch better than the first!
I:10370;2411;I added this to the Harry Potter movies that I already had.
I:10370;2412;This was an enjoyable second installment to the Harry Potter movies.
I:10370;2413;It is one of my favorites as well.
I:10370;2414;overall, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets provides enough mystery, adventure and wonder to make any movie viewer believe in magic.
I:10370;2415;This was a great movie, yet you don't get the same effect as you do reading the books.
I:10370;2416;Yet, I think they still did a great job on it.
I:10370;2417;It captures the second book good.
I:10370;2418;Daniel, Emma, and Rupert do even a better acting job than the first film.
I:10370;2419;They play their characters outstandingly real.
I:10370;2420;I also think the special effects look great.
I:10370;2421;Dobby, the mandrakes, the pixies, fawkes, and the basilisk look great.
I:10370;2422;Plus, there's fun and exciting games to play.
I:10370;2423;A much better and interesting special features disk than the first movie had!
I:10370;2424;A great addition for your Harry Potter collection.
I:10370;2425;I also highly recommend the Harry Potter books if you like the movies.
I:10370;2426;The fine people at Warner Brothers have done a very good job with this box set.
I:10370;2427;ray ultimate editions is wonderful and well worth it.
I:10370;2428;But if you just enjoy the films then these boxed sets should find their way into your collection at some point.
I:10370;2429;My adventure into the world of Harry Potter continues with the Chamber of Secrets.
I:10370;2430;The legendary Chamber of Secrets has been open and a mythological creatures has been released.
I:10370;2431;Harry and his friends have to find out who opened it and why before they are able to do anything about it.
I:10370;2432;What I enjoyed about the first film was that for all it has for kids, it had an equal amount of content that adults would enjoy.
I:10370;2433;Very true to the 2nd book.
I:10370;2434;The special effects which looked lower budget in the first movie actually shine in this film.
I:10370;2435;The scenes of Quidditch will be right up there from action scenes from great sports movies.
I:10370;2436;You will feel right there among the players.
I:10370;2437;Its much easier to navigate and the menus are more alive and animated.
I:10370;2438;overall a great movie adaptation of a fun book.
I:10370;2439;It's been a whole summer since we last saw Harry in his first adventure, The Sorcerer's Stone.
I:10370;2440;Instead of a drawn out introduction that takes place in the world of muggles (those who cannot wield magic), the film moves right along and breezily reintroduces us to the trio of friends, along with a more fleshed out background for each.
I:10370;2441;But perhaps the most interesting aspect of British society that sneaks into world of Hogwarts is the acute sense of class difference.
I:10370;2442;In the last film Draco Malfoy appeared to represent the aristocratic classes, and here that theme is brought to the forefront.
I:10370;2443;like all great sequels, The Chamber of Secrets deepens and enriches our understanding of the fantasy world thanks to additions both large and small.
I:10370;2444;We are introduced to a new character, Gilderoy Lockhart, played by Kenneth Branagh, a famous magician and writer whose ego far outpaces his skills.
I:10370;2445;We are keyed in on important moments in the history of Hogwarts, including the reason for the names of each house.
I:10370;2446;of all the new magical toys, it is the flying car that speaks to the appeal of the books themselves.
I:10370;2447;For most children, driving a car is the ultimate symbol of the fun and freedom of adulthood, and perhaps the only thing better than driving a car would be driving a flying car.
I:10370;2448;the director, Chris Columbus, seems more assured of himself this time around.
I:10370;2449;But here each random thread and subplot builds into the larger story.
I:10370;2450;The action is also handled more deftly this time around.
I:10370;2451;The quidditch match is much more dynamic, for example.
I:10370;2452;The camera tilts and swoops just like the players themselves, making the game more kinetic.
I:10370;2453;Sure, there were some imaginative ideas, but it lacked the sense of adventure that elevates the greatest of fantasy films.
I:10370;2454;still a good movie but not what I thought i bought bad selling Picture
I:10370;2455;It is a great movie which adheres to the plot of the book.
I:10370;2456;It was wonderful to re.
I:10370;2457;Your streaming service is great ,second to Vudu.
I:10370;2458;also have a daily $1.00 special like Vudu.
I:10370;2459;I think both of the first two Potter films are flawed, but Sorcerer's Stone benefited from charming .
I:10370;2460;One or both of them has a penchant for choosing easy laughs over competent storytelling, and Chamber of Secrets extends that to include unnecessary effects and action sequences as well.
I:10370;2461;[That's one reason that the Ultimate Editions of the first two films are appealing .
I:10370;2462;Branagh has a great feel for the character.
I:10370;2463;they really did a good job with most of the jokes from the book, and added a few things that make it eaiser to follow.
I:10370;2464;note: This movie will make perfect sense if you have not read the book, but you might have trouble if you did not see or read the first (Harry Potter and the sorcerers stone).
I:10370;2465;~hope this helps, and enjoy
I:10370;2466;This is a great movie.
I:10370;2467;If you thought that the first one was good then you should see this one.
I:10370;2468;Starting with physical change and leading into other things.
I:10370;2469;I would recommend this to everyone, who likes Harry Potter.
I:10370;2470;The acting was wonderful by our 3 main stars.
I:10370;2471;The heroes are fun too, but I really get into the antiheros that add the spice and conflict to the story.
I:10370;2472;Jason Isaacs who played Lucious Malfoy was perfect in role all the way through the entire series.
I:10370;2473;They bring their deliciously despicable characters to life.
I:10370;2474;I hope they've improved it since I bought my copy.
I:10370;2475;disc Ultimate Edition, I was stoked!
I:10370;2476;The neat little art book and cards are a nice bonus as well.
I:10370;2477;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an excellent book and also an amazing movie.
I:10370;2478;Despite lots of people were saying that the second movie of the HP series is not as good and audience friendly as the first one, one must bear in mind that the characters in the book of J. k Rowling were growing up, so are the actors and characters in the movie.
I:10370;2479;back to the movie itself, the second installment saw a progress in special effects and the design of the magical world.
I:10370;2480;This indeed becomes one of the convincing claim for keeping them as the leads, as you can grow with the characters, despite some people refuse to accept this.
I:10370;2481;His performance has improved a lot since the last movie and we can see that he could tell more through his eyes.
I:10370;2482;Rupert Grint did promising job for the character and was really able to make the audience laugh.
I:10370;2483;Kenneth Branagh did a very very good job as Gilderoy Lockhart, he actually transform into the character itself.
I:10370;2484;It is a very outstanding attempt.
I:10370;2485;The second movie also has a very outstanding soundtrack which fits finely into the movie.
I:10370;2486;but again bear in mind that this is also the exact embarassing age all the characters in the book are going through.
I:10370;2487;Taking this important factor into consideration, one would be more able to appreciate the effort of the director and the actors.
I:10370;2488;"The first sequel to ""Harry Potter"" is absolutely fantastic, far better than the original one."
I:10370;2489;dimentional and complex, giving us what we want: theills of fantasy.
I:10370;2490;its existence, its location, and its terrifying secrets .
I:10370;2491;"but the most remarkable thing about ""Chamber of Secrets"" is its hugely improved CGIs, reflecting the filmmaker's confidence coming from the commercial success of the previous one."
I:10370;2492;The match of Quiddich is again used as one of the highlights, and the newer game scene is simply great, much better than the first one.
I:10370;2493;With enhanced sound effects, the fight between Harry and Malfoy looks more realistic, even frightening, flying all over the ground and stands (and unbelievably, under them).
I:10370;2494;"But wait a while, and see Ron's family is introduced, including ever delightful Julie Walters (""Billy Elliot"") as Ron's mother."
I:10370;2495;"Obviuosly he is a comic relief, and Branagh is surprisingly good, this time not resorting to his overacting tendency that destroyed Woody Allen's ""Celebrity."""
I:10370;2496;daniel Radcliffe is as good as before, and so is Rupert Grint (in fact, they are giving the best acting in the film), but most regrettable is Emma Watson's Hermione, who is given much shorter time on the screen.
I:10370;2497;It is, however, undeniable that the film went through great improvement, and it explores much darker side of magic, which gives more thrills to adults and children alike.
I:10370;2498;All of the previous characters from the first film are back and the most crucial elements of the novel survive intact and are brought to life on the screen.
I:10370;2499;Much of the humor found in the novel is also missing, but I was pleased to find that this movie was much more humorous than it's predecessor.
I:10370;2500;A great movie full of action and faithful to it's source.
I:10370;2501;There are plenty of riddles and games to be had.
I:10370;2502;The feature that I liked was the snippets with the kids and the rest of the cast, sharing thier favorite memories of making the film.
I:10370;2503;down with J. k. Rowling and TCOS screenwriter which I found informative.
I:10370;2504;This version is much improved and after two weeks of owning it, I'm still having fun with the features.
I:10370;2505;Chris Columbus has done it again.
I:10370;2506;Bringing the magic of imagination to celluloid screen, he's getting better and better.
I:10370;2507;this sequel to the Sorcerer's Stone is better than the previous one.
I:10370;2508;Experience is a great teacher.
I:10370;2509;The second book is better than the first one, this holds as well in case of movies too.
I:10370;2510;the computer generated Dobby is also really cool.
I:10370;2511;He looks very real in the movie.
I:10370;2512;Though there wasn't much role of Durselys but they have been impressive in their work.
I:10370;2513;The quiddich match has great special effects specially when the tampered bugger follows Harry.
I:10370;2514;Rupert Grint is facing a change of voice but he's still cool with his funny expressions.
I:10370;2515;daniel Radcliffe, also looks a little older, has given a good performance in this movie.
I:10370;2516;And we really loved it and the whole series we are planning to watch over amazon
I:10370;2517;this movie as well as the book is by far my favorite in the saga.
I:10370;2518;Chris Columbus did a fantastic job for his final directorial attempt, still keeping close to the original story, but also really working with the kids bringing their acting abilities up to speed with the aging characters to make the audience connect with the characters as they did in the book.
I:10370;2519;while the movie is better than its predecessor, it still does rank as the best in the saga for there is still much to learn and 5 more years left to go.
I:10370;2520;The two disk version is better.
I:10370;2521;This was a pretty fun film.
I:10370;2522;I liked it better than the first one and the acting definetely improved in regards to the younger adults.
I:10370;2523;The story was pretty interesting and it follows the book pretty nicely which was surprising.
I:10370;2524;All in all, if you are a HP fan, you will love this film.
I:10370;2525;As far as sequels go this is excellent, I hope any subsequent Harry Potter movies will remain as good.
I:10370;2526;And it's certainly deserving of 5 stars!
I:10370;2527;Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart, who is incredibly self.
I:10370;2528;And he was also nominated the man with the most charming smile, five times.
I:10370;2529;The kids are visibly growing up, especially the boys, they're taller and their voices are deeper.
I:10370;2530;The script and acting is wonderful.
I:10370;2531;And the film is as touching as the first one.
I:10370;2532;With some scary moments, involving giant spiders and a huge serpent.
I:10370;2533;And many funny bits too, Kenneth Branagh has a knack for comedy.
I:10370;2534;He stays with them at their cozy house.
I:10370;2535;And for Harry Hogwarts, is home.
I:10370;2536;I saw Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets and I just absolutely loved the movies as much as the books.
I:10370;2537;For the first time the movies actually went along with everything that happened in the books.
I:10370;2538;I saw the Chamber of Secrets in the theater 3 times and loved it each time!
I:10370;2539;Everyone should read the Harry Potter books because they're so fun to read and there isn't one boring part in the books or movies.
I:10370;2540;I'm so glad that J. k. Rowling made up this amazing character and great books.
I:10370;2541;this movie surpasses the first one Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone, you see more of the actors/actresses and learn more about the school, etc.
I:10370;2542;Missed some really good parts.
I:10370;2543;The special effects were great, the actors charming, and the whole experience was just fun fun fun.
I:10370;2544;This movie's one fault is its desire to be realistic, which it most certainly is.
I:10370;2545;The old gal's still got it!Two thumbs, ahem Wands, down.
I:10370;2546;Love this movie, as all of the series, keeps you glued to your seat.
I:10370;2547;It makes you see that good things do happen to those who are less fortunate.
I:10370;2548;Great cast, there are good parts and bad parts to the movie, but it's what made the movie.
I:10370;2549;It is worth the billions.
I:10370;2550;All Harry Potter stories and movies are amazing, I realy love them all, but this particular one is a favorite of mine.
I:10370;2551;The Chamber of Secrets is a really good movie, and more exciting, thrilling, and darker than The Philosopher's Stone.
I:10370;2552;The Philosopher's Stone was a great introduction, and it was a pretty good movie, too.
I:10370;2553;It's probably even better for families who will be watching with kids, because The Chamber of Secrets is pretty intense.
I:10370;2554;For anyone wanting a thrilling movie (or any of the adjectives I've used above, for that matter) than The Chamber of Secrets is a good pick.
I:10370;2555;very interestng and exciting .
I:10370;2556;do I recommend this movie .
I:10370;2557;ride for you and your kids.
I:10370;2558;But those interested in the preservation of literary works be aware that this round of HP production is just that .
I:10370;2559;I would recommend this movie, I like that it kept along the lines of the book as well.
I:10370;2560;Great show for girls and boys alike.
I:10370;2561;I thought the filmmakers, actors and crew did a wonderful job with the book.
I:10370;2562;I really enjoyed everything and it totally captured my imagination.
I:10370;2563;All the actors are growing into their roles.
I:10370;2564;all in all, it was a well done movie.
I:10370;2565;As soon as Hagrid enters the Great Hall, I scan forward every time.
I:10370;2566;all in all, a fun viewing experience!
I:10370;2567;I'm very pleased with this movie.
I:10370;2568;It sticks to the book very well.
I:10370;2569;This was a great movie.
I:10370;2570;I agree with most of the reviewers.
I:10370;2571;I really enjoyed all the movies in the Harry Potter series.
I:10370;2572;This is the second movie in the series and I think it was just as good as the first.
I:10370;2573;I would recommend it to anyone.
I:10370;2574;I didn't read any of the Harry Potter books, but still enjoyed the movie.
I:10370;2575;The Sorcerer's Stone was an enjoyable movie, but Chris Columbus didn't allow his plot to stray in the Chamber of Secrets.
I:10370;2576;Daniel Radcliffe was much better as Harry in CoS. he actually exhibited emotion.
I:10370;2577;you just have to love Ron, and Rupert has the best facial expressions, and perfectly captures Ron's charisma and humor.
I:10370;2578;Emma Watson returns as a much.
I:10370;2579;improved Hermione, though I still thinks she over.
I:10370;2580;Bonnie Wright is absolutely adorable as Ginny, and Kenneth Branagh's Gilderoy Lockhart almost matches Ron in charm.
I:10370;2581;they are sooo perfect together, and you really see it coming in this movie*Hermione's reunion with Harry and (esp) Ron.
I:10370;2582;they go together perfectly, and that is totally in this movie.
I:10370;2583;Also, Chris Columbus' Chamber of Secrets scene with Harry and Ginny was just perfect.
I:10370;2584;they are so sweet together it hurts.
I:10370;2585;Children 8 and above SHOULD be okay.
I:10370;2586;A lot of fun action filled scenes, several of which were not in the book.
I:10370;2587;The casting (perfect Lucius, Arthur, Lockhart), the music, the sets, the costumes, the special effects.
I:10370;2588;great movie to see time and time again.
I:10370;2589;but my 4 and 6 year old kids will have to be happy with just the books for now.
I:10370;2590;so go see it already!
I:10370;2591;The movie is wonderful and my older child loves it too.
I:10370;2592;It was very good and according to our granddaughter it followed the book very well.
I:10370;2593;I am one of those people who will always like books better, no matter what.
I:10370;2594;I believe the book draws you into the story more, really portrays the fear Harry is feeling.
I:10370;2595;I do love the Weasleys' house, and Diagon Alley especially.
I:10370;2596;I think Hagrid played a bigger role in the book, however, as did Professor Lockhart (who is my favorite character in the books, aside from Lupin, and all the Weasleys).
I:10370;2597;But aside from these points, this was a great movie.
I:10370;2598;Hope the third is just as good, or better, seeing how it is my favorite.
I:10370;2599;screen adaptation of JK Rowlings' second Harry Potter book, the Chamber of Secrets, is once again directed by Chris Columbus, and is an improvement over his first enjoyable offering.
I:10370;2600;Undeterred, Harry returns to Hogwarts with the help of Ron and the flying car, despite Dobby's best efforts to stop them.
I:10370;2601;whilst the opening stay at the Weasly's home is mostly light.
I:10370;2602;Students suspect Harry, especially when they discover that he has the rare talent of parselmouth, the ability to communicate with snakes.
I:10370;2603;the acting of young Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry, Ron and Hermione is greatly improved over their performances in the first movie, although it is still a little suspect in places, especially the irksome face Ron pulls every time there is any danger.
I:10370;2604;However, the great adult ensemble cast is once again excellent, this time lead by a superb performance from Kenneth Branagh as the pompous, egotistical and inept new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart.
I:10370;2605;Branagh is obviously enjoying himself camping.
I:10370;2606;up and poking fun at his own celebrity, and steals practically every scene that he is in.
I:10370;2607;all in all, the Chamber of Secrets is another enjoyable Harry Potter movie, plus it's always a pleasure to see JK Rowlings magical universe brought to life on the screen .
I:10370;2608;paced, dark, imaginative and enjoyable movie for children of all ages.
I:10370;2609;hits as a growing relationship between Hermione and Harry (we all know that her and RON are the big thing in book 4!)
I:10370;2610;maybe a new director and more exciting plot will get this story going and produce a film worth paying for.
I:10370;2611;Maybe the third time will be the charm and achieve movie greatness.
I:10370;2612;This Year Two is enjoyable now due to the kids being so small, and their courage building.
I:10370;2613;Great sequel to the series.
I:10370;2614;The story and characters are a perfect fit to the book.
I:10370;2615;My children loved every moment of it, especially when Harry faced the basilisk.
I:10370;2616;Doby is also a nice touch (and touching), even though he is cg and may harken back to the Jar Jar Binks flop of the Star Wars series, he will be a character that will be remembered and loved throughout time.
I:10370;2617;I could watch it nonstop again!
I:10370;2618;The movie was relatively well.
I:10370;2619;directed, and the young actors are certainly growing in to their characters.
I:10370;2620;John Williams's score was once again enchanting and mood.
I:10370;2621;The set design was superb, the environment really draws you in.
I:10370;2622;This is definitely a movie for which you will benefit from your expensive surround.
I:10370;2623;The movies, after all, are fairly true to the books in story and style.
I:10370;2624;as usual, I recommend reading before viewing.
I:10370;2625;I expect the future sequels to only improve, if only marginally, and make Harry Potter the greatest fantasy film series for all ages to date, save perhaps Lord of the Rings.
I:10370;2626;"This second film, ""Chamber of Secrets"", slowly continues to unravel the narrative (with a lot of hi."
I:10370;2627;the positives of this movie are that (with a few exceptions) it remains very faithful to the novel.
I:10370;2628;It also is still a visual treat and contains some interesting special effects.
I:10370;2629;"The entire first half of the film contains a lot of what I would call ""hi."
I:10370;2630;"jinx"" (or adventurous material), which lends itself to a lot of fantastic visuals based on the crazy characters imagined in the novel."
I:10370;2631;another interesting little track to follow in these films is that the main actors continue to improve on their performances as they age.
I:10370;2632;Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint were all quite young when the series began, so to see them mature as actors on the big screen is a treat.
I:10370;2633;Of course, the auxiliary cast is tremendous again, with Kenneth Branagh (as Professor Lockhart) particularly engaging.
I:10370;2634;the only reason I give this film four stars compared to the original's five is that I'm still waiting for the narrative to shift into high gear.
I:10370;2635;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fun filled action film.
I:10370;2636;Harry's magical world has been brought to life from J. k. Rowlings talented work to the famous big screen.
I:10370;2637;This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through the movie.
I:10370;2638;The second instalment in the Harry Potter movie franchise is an excellent movie in its own right .
I:10370;2639;all three do justice to their roles, and show some maturing in each respective role, esp Radcliffe.
I:10370;2640;all in all, this is a worthy follow.
I:10370;2641;up in the Harry Potter franchise, and a visual feast for the senses.
