I:9930;1;There is little I can add to what others have said in reviewing this splendid little gem of a movie, but what is so intriguing is that one could make a case for any of the six main characters' being the focal point for the movie.
I:9930;2;And certainly a case could be made for at least two of the characters.
I:9930;3;"It is a movie that grows deeper each time one sees it
I:9930;4;the acting, the editing, the camera work, and the haunting musical score contribute to its' being a rare and uplifting experience.
I:9930;5;This movie was very eye opening and heartfelt.
I:9930;6;It really makes you see immigration struggles through the yes of those who are going through it.
I:9930;7;Thought provoking, funny, sad, drama, I loved it
I:9930;8;The more I watch this beautiful film the deeper I'm touched by its grace and elegance.
I:9930;9;It's one of the more impressionable films to come out in quite some time, and it truly deserves a wider audience.
I:9930;10;`In America' was actually recommended to us shortly after my wife became pregnant with our first child.
I:9930;11;Blessed with well executed delivery and fantastic acting on the parts of everyone involved `In America' quickly becomes one of the most engrossing and engaging family dramas to date.
I:9930;12;jim Sheridan wrote and directed this masterpiece of a film with such conviction it's undeniable.
I:9930;13;Johnny and Sarah are a loving couple who are devoted to their children.
I:9930;14;He's devoted, protective, compassionate, understanding and loyal.
I:9930;15;The real heart of this magical film is the power of forgiveness and acceptance.
I:9930;16;Sarah and Johnny had previously lost a son, Frankie, and throughout this movie they are plagued with guilt and blame, but the uplifting and heart tugging finale will prove miracles can happen.
I:9930;17;the acting here is the biggest draw, for without powerful and convincing portrayals the film would have fallen far from its anticipated impression.
I:9930;18;Paddy Considine gives one of my favorite performances of the year, and probably my favorite male performance of 2003.
I:9930;19;He's convincing and relatable, controlled and so sympathetic.
I:9930;20;We can feel his pain, his joy, his sadness, his fear, everything he feels he portrays so vividly it's amazing to watch.
I:9930;21;Samantha Morton is one of my favorite actresses and here she again delivers a knock down drag out performance.
I:9930;22;She can say so much with her big beautiful eyes it's uncanny.
I:9930;23;Djimon Honsou is also brilliant as the families neighbor Mateo, the sick recluse who opens his heart to this family.
I:9930;24;the film is told through the eyes of the oldest daughter Christie and I think that helps in adding layers of sentiment and compassion.
I:9930;25;It's realistic in every way and engaging from start to finish.
I:9930;26;`In America' is one of the best films of the past decade and is sure to bring a tear to your eye and a smile to your face.
I:9930;27;"I see this movie as one of the great ""people"" movies that I have ever seen."
I:9930;28;The ONLY gripe I have about this movie is feeling compelled to write this review, as it helps to sell more products via Amazon .
I:9930;29;If you are man or woman enough to watch it without a slight tear in your eye then you were never born with a heart.
I:9930;30;until this bloody brilliant movie.
I:9930;31;Hand on heart, stick a needle in my eye.
I:9930;32;In America is such a great and moving movie that cried several times during the show.
I:9930;33;Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine give great performances as well as the little girls who play their daughters.
I:9930;34;stealer in this film, and he deserves the Oscar nomination he got for his role.
I:9930;35;is adorable right from the get go.
I:9930;36;Older sister Sarah is the mature, world.
I:9930;37;weary (but still sweet) Christy.
I:9930;38;But Samantha Morton is a treat, too.
I:9930;39;She was wonderful but obscured as the pre.
I:9930;40;cog in the fine Cruise/Spielberg film 'Minority Report.'
I:9930;41;Here, she's front and center and luminous.
I:9930;42;A real keeper in my book.
I:9930;43;Very touching and uplifting movie about a family dealing with the death of a child.
I:9930;44;Loved it1 It's an old movie, but I would recommend it to anyone.
I:9930;45;The acting of Samantha Morton and the girls is excellent.
I:9930;46;day survival can be, yet I found most of the storyline to be unbelievable.
I:9930;47;In America takes hold of you right from the beginning,squeezes your heart, and never lets go.
I:9930;48;we experience just about every emotion there is as this story unfolds, and what a wonderful story it is!We see this through the eyes (and camera) of the 11 year old girl.
I:9930;49;this movie is a must see, and one of the 10 best I have EVER seen.
I:9930;50;true, it is a tear jerker, but SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much more.
I:9930;51;These are the sorts of stories I like, a real message, well.
I:9930;52;out characters, great writing, beautiful to the eye/heart/mind!
I:9930;53;Such a surprise of a movie.
I:9930;54;I give it a big A+++++++ for a wonderful movie.
I:9930;55;Few films paint a more uplifting and poignant picture of what the American dream can be, should be, than Jim Sheridan's heartwrenching masterpiece, 'In America.'
I:9930;56;He succeeded in a very big way.
I:9930;57;'In America' hits all the marks of a great film.
I:9930;58;It entertains you, it moves you, it educates you.
I:9930;59;The first scene gives you the crux.
I:9930;60;starting over is full of new challenges, new joys and new pains.
I:9930;61;Johnny and family move into a dingy tenement full of equally dingy characters.
I:9930;62;All tiny steps through the passage of rebirth.
I:9930;63;heartedly touches Sarah's growing stomach, she explodes, 'You can't touch the thing you've created, and that's why you can't create something that will touch others!'
I:9930;64;An African artist locked up in his wounds and loneliness, he paints with his own blood and frightens the whole tenement with his violent screams.
I:9930;65;In one of the film's numerous poignant scenes, they stop at his door for their first trick.
I:9930;66;treat and won't be denied.
I:9930;67;Knock and you shall receive.
I:9930;68;Two alien worlds crash together and a bond is forged.
I:9930;69;They sense a fellow wounded heart in Mateo, yet one capable of extraordinary love.
I:9930;70;Johnny has his doubts about this freakish neighbor, until Mateo gives him a lesson in being grateful for what he has.
I:9930;71;the pace quickens into a crescendo that is guaranteed to leave you wet.
I:9930;72;A lot has already been said about the superb acting in this film, and it's all true.
I:9930;73;Ariel's impish innocence and Christy's maturity beyond her years will leave you glued.
I:9930;74;wrenching and stellar performances, its the little stuff that Sheridan sneaks into each scene that trips you up.
I:9930;75;Ariel's honest query, 'But where did ET go?
I:9930;76;and the family's first trip to an amusement park where Johnny must win the ball.
I:9930;77;So much that touches us on a human level, so much about what it means to be American.
I:9930;78;It's a delightful film, touching without being too cute.
I:9930;79;She speeds it up and slows it down as she needs to.
I:9930;80;She talks of her sister Ariel's fears, of her mother's strength and of her father's lost smile.
I:9930;81;And, most importantly, she puts a positive spin on each of her proud family's struggles.
I:9930;82;The elements are there, certainly.
I:9930;83;Johnny, the girls' father, is an out.
I:9930;84;but the atmosphere that Sheridan provides us in this film is comforting and light.
I:9930;85;The tenement is both scary and magical, depending upon the story that Christie is telling the audience.
I:9930;86;Throughout these positive twists, the importance of the narrator is key.
I:9930;87;Happy endings are important to a little girl, particularly one who feels so responsible for her own family.
I:9930;88;though it focuses on her entire family, it's Christie's story.
I:9930;89;And, while she's telling it, it's really moving and uplifting.
I:9930;90;the acting here is uniformly terrific.
I:9930;91;He's attractive, strong, a little crazy and yet weighed down by grief.
I:9930;92;Samantha Morton delivers another compelling performance, yet she comes off here as sweeter and more sympathetic than she did in the disappointing MORVERN CALLAR.
I:9930;93;Djimon Honsou, best known for his work in AMISTAD, is absolutely spectacular as Mateo, the girls' doomed neighbor.
I:9930;94;the script is terrific, and the direction is quite good.
I:9930;95;iN AMERICA is just lovely.
I:9930;96;This is such a heartfelt and honest story, even in it's probably more fictional aspects.
I:9930;97;I recommend it to anyone that likes stories, even a little bit.
I:9930;98;Amazing movie with the right balance of comedy and drama.
I:9930;99;All of the actors, including the children, are amazing.
I:9930;100;All the actors and actresses carried this movie and made it so believable.
I:9930;101;The Bolger sisters absolutely were the touch of grace in this story.
I:9930;102;Tough, heartbreakingly real and giving a glimpse of the aspirations of millions who've come ashore.
I:9930;103;There are few movies out there that can truly touch the heart,and 'In America' is certainly one of them.
I:9930;104;it is a moving story about the hardships faced by an irish family that has just moved to New York City,and have recently lost their young son do to a tragic fall down the stairs.
I:9930;105;it a simple yet powerful tale that is extremely life affirming,and ill bet like me you will shed a tear or to at the end of this wonderful film.
I:9930;106;all of the performances are outstanding(especially the 2 young girls),and the movie will stay with you long after it is over.
I:9930;107;i highly recommend that everyone see this movie,and that you tell everyone you know about it,because it deserves to be seen and appreciated.
I:9930;108;its one of the best films of the decade and will certainly stand the test of time.
I:9930;109;I was anxious to see it after hearing all the good buzz surrounding it.
I:9930;110;This movie is raw human emotion.
I:9930;111;I was captivated by the Bolger sisters and their absolutely heartbreaking performances.
I:9930;112;We see into each character's struggles to make it in America, and how the two girls, despite their young ages, are the glue that keeps everything together and keep hope alive.
I:9930;113;I could not keep my eyes off the screen and I truly felt for this family and everything they endured.
I:9930;114;Kudos to everyone involved in this film.
I:9930;115;Truly a work of art.
I:9930;116;Under the expert direction of Jim Sheridan, this simple story of an Irish family moving into NYC remains one of the best tearjerkers in recent decades.
I:9930;117;The performances are fantastic all around.
I:9930;118;The little girls (sisters in real life) deliver performances unlike what you ever get to see kids do onscreen .
I:9930;119;Finally, in one of the more overlooked performances in recent years, Djimon Hounsou radiates warmth, love and deep affection staggeringly from the screen.
I:9930;120;A beautiful movie that will touch your heart and leave you with tears.
I:9930;121;It touches on ideas of prejudice, respect, and acceptance and is beautifully crafted as it follows the journey of an immegrant family in America.
I:9930;122;"This is a lovely film
I:9930;123;Magic becomes reality in this film as it equates to love, friendship, perserverance, and the optimism of young hearts.
I:9930;124;Sometimes magical miracles happen with the help of love from heaven and on earth.
I:9930;125;Saw it when it was on TV and it was Great!!
I:9930;126;So we bought it to see again.
I:9930;127;I was laughing and crying and happy all at once.
I:9930;128;This movie was not the normal hollywood movie, it was one that touched you.
I:9930;129;The acting was great all around.
I:9930;130;The reason that I bought this movie was because I liked the song.
I:9930;131;"dance in ""West Side Story"" entitled ""In America,"" and I thought, ""Hmm, maybe this movie called ""In America"" is somehow a take."
I:9930;132;an impoverished Irish couple and their two young daughters move to New York, illegally, from Canada.
I:9930;133;"The movie makers depict it as looking reminiscent of the classic popular idea of a ""haunted house,"" but in the form of a gigantic apartment building."
I:9930;134;i think you will love this all.
I:9930;135;Then, the story becomes very beautiful and its working out becomes emotionally gripping.
I:9930;136;Turning the sound up to level 45 helped a bit.
I:9930;137;I chose to watch the full.
I:9930;138;In my opinion, it deserves great accolades.
I:9930;139;I was very touched by the character of Matteo, a big guy with a big heart, whom the movie maker compares (in a good.
I:9930;140;bye moment) with a certain famous, lovable, small movie character: ET.
I:9930;141;watching this movie to tap greater depth of meaning and to pick up more dialogue.
I:9930;142;The greatest charm and beauty of this movie is the children and the child.
I:9930;143;In America is a caring movie about an American dream that comes true.
I:9930;144;It's a sweet movie, with great acting from everyone.
I:9930;145;In America is a brilliant film about an Irish family who moves to New York in search of better opportunities for themselves.
I:9930;146;They eventually meet this man, Mateo (Djimon Hounsou), and discover that he's actually quite an amiable man, though Johnny is hesitant to accept him, suspicious of his motives.
I:9930;147;The girls develop a fondness for Mateo, as he plays games with them, and when Sarah becomes pregnant again, Mateo assures her that good things will come with the new baby.
I:9930;148;director Jim Sheridan co. wrote the screenplay with his daughter Naomi based on their own life story, and it's clear from the outset that this is a perfectly realistic portrayal of a family with hopes and dreams that often exceed their means.
I:9930;149;the acting is phenomenal by everyone involved.
I:9930;150;The young actors are excellent as well: Emma Bolger infuses Ariel with sprightly vigor, and Sarah Bolger creates the character of Christy as a young girl who's been forced to grow up faster than she'd like, but taking it all in stride.
I:9930;151;Mateo is at first unsettling, but Hounsou's charisma allows us to believe in the size of Mateo's heart and his raw passion for life.
I:9930;152;It is a tale filled with wonderful characters, and it manages to bring across its theme of hope without using sentimental sap, but rather by investing its story in its characters and not the other way around.
I:9930;153;We feel their sadness and can relate to their feelings and actions, though we might not always agree with what they do or say.
I:9930;154;What a remarkable movie experience this is.
I:9930;155;holds barred look at the poverty our society tries to ignore, and the hope and spirit of accomplishment that our country was founded on.
I:9930;156;'Performances are exceptional, particularly with Dimon Hunsue and Samantha Morton.
I:9930;157;But, if you want an honest look at the American Dream and what would make one want to pursue it, and gain a new appreciate for the country we live in, this film is for you.
I:9930;158;This movie (with its pitch perfect cast) tells a story that is the only story worth watching.
I:9930;159;"This is no ""device,"" it is the honest depiction of one family's struggles in their life's station."
I:9930;160;Who cares how they got there, or whether they should have left Ireland or are watching their kids close enough?The performances of the children are scary good with the ten.year old's rendition of Desperado so sweet and sure that I must get the movie for that scene alone.
I:9930;161;See this movie as an affirmation of why there is cinema in our society.
I:9930;162;As is, it's one of those films that slightly annoy because, in the hands of a better director, it could have been something as haunting as the couple's dead child is meant to be.
I:9930;163;This was simply a nice human.
I:9930;164;basically, it's about a likeable Irish family which immigrates to the United States and resides in New York City.
I:9930;165;What stood out to me were the nice, cute little girls in this family, played by real.
I:9930;166;They were the kind of sweet kids you wish you'd see more of in modern films.
I:9930;167;overall, it's a pleasant, positive feel.
I:9930;168;I've watched it several times and enjoyed it more each time!
I:9930;169;`In America' is a truly touching and beautiful film, elevated by strong performances by everyone involved.

I:9930;171;In the midst of all this tragedy there is a glimmer of light.
I:9930;172;It all starts with his kind gesture towards the two girls while the experience their first Halloween in the states.
I:9930;173;As the film progresses and we learn of Mateo's condition, their relationships become more and more pertinent and meaning some.
I:9930;174;the final frames of the film are tragic yet beautiful and as the oldest daughter Christy turns off her camera a tear is brought to your eyes.
I:9930;175;one of happiness mixed with sorrow.
I:9930;176;This is a brilliant film that touches on so many levels of human emotion, from grief to acceptance to fear and happiness.
I:9930;177;As you watch these people grow and learn you are swallowed up in their trials as if you've known them your whole life.
I:9930;178;This is due mostly to the impressive cast.
I:9930;179;Samantha Morton hands down delivers the finest performance here.
I:9930;180;She captured every emotion a grieving mother goes through, and her nervous breakdown in the hospital is so emotionally gripping it had me weeping.
I:9930;181;He was brilliant and deserved some recognition.
I:9930;182;They became these adorable innocent children without slipping into stereotypical `cute kids', remaining three dimensional and `real', not Hollywoodized and hollow!This film is, as many have stated, classic and should be watched and enjoyed by everyone.
I:9930;183;It's very rare you get to enjoy something that exuberates perfection on every level, and this film, this rarity, does just that.
I:9930;184;Sarah and Johnny move with their two young girls from Ireland to tenement housing in New York City.
I:9930;185;This was a good but not great film, even though it earned three Academy Award nominations.
I:9930;186;A must see if you want to see into the hearts of those who have similarly mourned.
I:9930;187;It is so moving, the acting is so great, and the story is truly wonderful.
I:9930;188;In America , starring Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine, is a great film that is sure to touch its audiences.
I:9930;189;Its unique plot of an Irish family who moves to the US is brilliant.
I:9930;190;As the film continues, more storylines combine to one another, making this film more remarkable.
I:9930;191;The physical and emotional surroundings offer more realisms than most other modern.
I:9930;192;The family's hardships are expressed wonderfully from the writing to the acting to the environmental backgrounds.
I:9930;193;It especially becomes more heartfelt once the family introduces themselves to a neighbor, a lonely man dying of AIDS.
I:9930;194;The storyline never stops surprising audiences.
I:9930;195;samantha Morton ( Sweet And Lowdown ) and Djimon Hounsou ( Amistad ) are triumphant in their Oscar.
I:9930;196;nominated roles (Best Actress/ Best Supporting Actor).
I:9930;197;Both offer great heartfelt presences through every scene, Morton as the struggling mother and Hounsou as the lonely neighbor friend.
I:9930;198;The expressions give this film the added emotional value.
I:9930;199;All other actors also offer perspective to the emotional and physical surroundings.
I:9930;200;In America is sure to move its audiences.
I:9930;201;It will surely continue pleasing audiences as it already has.
I:9930;202;The five principle actors in this film are all uniformly excellent.
I:9930;203;Djimon Hounsou is excellent as the bitter dying artist who takes a chance by allowing this family to enter into his life.
I:9930;204;The real delight here are the performances by the Bolger sisters, Emma and Sarah.
I:9930;205;Despite all the hardship they've experienced, they put an uncomplaining sunny face on everything.
I:9930;206;top, while the storyline just lumbered along.
I:9930;207;"Upon making my way to my local theater to see ""In America"", I was hoping to see an honest rags."
I:9930;208;riches story of one Irish family's struggle to make a good life for themselves in their homeland, and come to America to bask in the splendor of opportunity and wealth.
I:9930;209;"In addition, ""In America"" is chock."
I:9930;210;"Better yet, ""Were Jim Sheridan and his relatives sniffing toxic fumes (particularly from the chipped paint of the run."
I:9930;211;I thought the story was wonderful, the acting was terrific, the two young girls were outstanding.
I:9930;212;I loved that it was not a typical Hollywood ending.
I:9930;213;making at its finest is a simple and beautiful story, told in images and carefully placed words spoken by believable, thoughtful actors.
I:9930;214;How do you make a movie that's so true to real life which is anything but beautiful and yet somwhow make it the sweetest thing I've ever seen?Well.
I:9930;215;who loved it as much as I did.
I:9930;216;Despite all tears you must take what really matters of this film: its simple but strong message.Your heart must be ready for a lot of emotions.
I:9930;217;Your mind has to be open to understand what happens to this family.
I:9930;218;They are always full of hope and wisdom, thinking that things are going to improve soon.
I:9930;219;the performance of the four members of the family and their strange neighbour are despicable.
I:9930;220;The story, the plot are very impressive.
I:9930;221;This is a very good film and you don't have to take the sad part of this movie, but its message, full of hope and eternal happiness.
I:9930;222;A very emotional but eventually uplifting tale of loss and grief, relationship challenges, personal discovery and .
I:9930;223;recovery and triumph as a family starts life over in a new country, under the most adverse and colorful conditions.
I:9930;224;The two girls give powerful performances that left me very impressed.
I:9930;225;In America is a very moving and touching story about an Irish family that moves to New York after their only son dies.
I:9930;226;wonderful acting performances by everyone in the cast .
I:9930;227;All points of view are respected and portrayed with sensitivity.
I:9930;228;In America is a rich tapestry of sights and sounds, and there are strong elements of magical realism that add a touch of whimsy to the story.
I:9930;229;Jim Sheridan explores a number of themes in his film, such as the difficulty of facing the death of a loved one, the grinding humiliation of poverty, the hopes and dreams that keep us going, and the relationships that ultimately redeem us.
I:9930;230;two sisters, Emma and Sarah Bolger, beautifully portray the young daughters.
I:9930;231;These enchanting actresses contribute immeasurably to the film's effectiveness.
I:9930;232;Djimon Hounsou is also a strong presence as a Nigerian neighbor with demons of his own who strikes up a friendship with the poor Irish family.
I:9930;233;"although ""In America"" is a small movie in many ways, it has a big heart and top."
I:9930;234;Sheridan directs with warmth and compassion, and I get the feeling that he knows how hard it is for an impoverished immigrant to leave his native land and start a new life in strange surroundings.
I:9930;235;He also has the good sense to cast two wonderfully unaffected children as the girls .
I:9930;236;minded Christy with her red camcorder, while seven.year old Emma Bolger is a bundle of sparkling energy as the sunny Ariel.
I:9930;237;"Despite a few cliches (spunky but poor Irish immigrant family
I:9930;238;Wonderful acting by all the principals, and the little girls are exquisite.
I:9930;239;Joy and sadness are perfectly balanced .
I:9930;240;The children were perfectly cast.
I:9930;241;One of the best films of the year comes by way of an Irish immigrant family.
I:9930;242;"His girls, however, see everything in the world as magical, even the ""crazed"" African man who lives in the druggie."
I:9930;243;It is a wonderful film that is sure to bring some water to the eyes as you see the story unfold, and the power of hope acted out.
I:9930;244;One of my favorite movies.
I:9930;245;This was heavy and emotional but definitely serves as excellent example of our other English, German/French, Italiano and African Families who settled IN America!
I:9930;246;I would dearly love to give it more than 5 Stars!
I:9930;247;from an experienced reviewer, musician, and Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
I:9930;248;should strike a chord with many people on many levels.
I:9930;249;The kids in this movie are awesome.
I:9930;250;If I were them, I would be proud of this movie.
I:9930;251;one of my top 5 movies.
I:9930;252;This movie has the most wonderful cast, with a terrific storyline too.
I:9930;253;I was stunned by the emotion of the movie overall and the incredible acting, especially by the two sisters.
I:9930;254;She was able to make the character, though very young, have a certain wisdom that's very evident and crucial to the integrity of the movie.
I:9930;255;this movie has a lot of depth, able to evoke emotions you never knew you had.
I:9930;256;I think a lot of aspects worked together to make this movie an great success.
I:9930;257;Cinematography was very important, as it captured every mood of the characters.
I:9930;258;and the actors never let go of you heart through the entire movie.
I:9930;259;Dialogue was excellent, as you watch their interactions, what the characters say are very important to understanding their agonies, hopes, and realizations.
I:9930;260;I'm sure there are many more factors that make this movie so emotional .
I:9930;261;it's a feast for the senses.
I:9930;262;how movie characters in this movie can seem so real.
I:9930;263;"IN AMERICA has heart, extraordinary writing, superb acting, admirable cinematography by Declan Quinn, and, in short, everything that ""small films"" attempt for, in abundance."
I:9930;264;inability to find decent housing, work, friends etc .
I:9930;265;The daughters are played with impeccable grace and skill by Sarah and Emma Bolger, and Mateo (their new fried) is the creation of the beautiful actor Djimon Hounsou who shines in this pivotal role.
I:9930;266;This story is related with underplayed sensitivity and heartwarming tenderness.
I:9930;267;Rarely has a film found an audience that is almost uniformly moved to quiet tears during the credits.
I:9930;268;Would that there could be more honest, thoughtful, touching films like IN AMERICA to tend to the bruised psyches of us all.
I:9930;269;Kudos to Jim Sheridan and his enormously gifted cast and crew .
I:9930;270;and to his courage to pursue this project.
I:9930;271;Sheridan does a good job of showing familial relationships in the cultural melting pot of modern day NYC.
I:9930;272;One of the daughters is the narrator of this movie and wise beyond her years.
I:9930;273;Human drama and feelings, disregard for stereotypes, great photography, action with reaction and great lesson in self acceptance is but a few of the elements that makes this a great classic.
I:9930;274;This family is so gentle and loving to each other without ever being treacly.
I:9930;275;"Christy takes everything in on her camcorder, and precociously ""rescues"" the family with three wishes she uses judiciously through the course of the movie."
I:9930;276;Mom, luminously played by Samantha Morton, is radiant, loyal and supportive.
I:9930;277;this is a movie about redemption, love, and overcoming grief while sustaining the bonds that are family.
I:9930;278;They may be heavy but they are handled with a light touch, and the people in this movie have so much charm you want to take them home.
I:9930;279;i liked the movie so much I immediately watched it again with the commentary and Jim Sheridan was delightful.
I:9930;280;though repetitive once in a while he was also hilarious, rather humble and enlightening.
I:9930;281;the movie is based on a true story, his own, with some changes of course.
I:9930;282;It all works gloriously, and his descriptions of some of the things that happened in auditions or while shooting are memorable.
I:9930;283;Could anything be more magical than the family's initial joy when they see Times Square with all its dazzle and light?Highly recommended.
I:9930;284;I read a lot of best of lists.
I:9930;285;I would see this film in many such lists but I waited for all these months and years to finally watch it this night.
I:9930;286;It has a pulverizing magnitude, the kind that made my head spin because of the terrific association with the characters.
I:9930;287;reminds me of why I watch films with a voracious vengeful pace, it is to find solace in dramas woven with a tender touch of magic, finality, sensation and heartbeats such as this one.
I:9930;288;In America is an absolute treat.
I:9930;289;It can be hard to watch in many parts, but a film as good as this balances it extremely well.
I:9930;290;The director and film makers are well deserving of their awards at the Sundance FIlm Festival and other festivals.
I:9930;291;Real human feeling is woven throughout the story in all the trials the family endures.
I:9930;292;In America is well worth adding to your collection.
I:9930;293;Jim Sheridan came onstage after the film and described his experience discovering the two sisters as well as the experience making the film.
I:9930;294;this film is a true tearjerker.
I:9930;295;It is a wonderful story, but be prepared to cry.
I:9930;296;This was an absolutely brilliant human drama.
I:9930;297;This story takes place in the early 1980's and is about an Irish family with two adorable little girls who come to come to New York City to start over.
I:9930;298;The story is full of love, anger, sorrow, and happiness.
I:9930;299;This was definitely a masterpiece.
I:9930;300;This one will make it to my top 10 of 2004.
I:9930;301;This simple movie is full of storytelling.
I:9930;302;Dramatic but yet hopeful and pleasurable.
I:9930;303;When I left the movie I remember the hopeful and grant feeling I left from Forrest Gump .
I:9930;304;This beautiful sad story about a young Irish family, illegal immigrants in New York, is by a long shot the best film that I have watched this year, so far.
I:9930;305;The stars of the story are the two little daughters, real sisters in real life.
I:9930;306;The mother finds a job in an ice cream shop called Heaven.
I:9930;307;Mateo will provide the link to the ET element of the story, which can be anticipated from the full moon above Manhattan.
I:9930;308;mateo also provides the miraculous happy end to the film.
I:9930;309;films with happy ends can still do heavy damage to your tissue stocks.
I:9930;310;A pitch perfect tale of overcoming loss and beginning afresh told with masterly skill by Jim Sheridan.
I:9930;311;With considerable generosity of spirit this is a film to lose yourself in and relish.
I:9930;312;This is an unforgettable film that touches the heart and demostrates the power of love to heal.
I:9930;313;Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine are wonderful as the mon and dad who bravely struggle to raise their two adorable young daughters in their run.
I:9930;314;"Although I feel that Sheridan sometimes tries a little too hard to tug at the heart strings, ""In America"" is a loving and touching film that truly moved me."
I:9930;315;In America is a near perfect movie dealing w/ grief and learning to live again after tragedy.
I:9930;316;It is also about hope.
I:9930;317;the characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way.
I:9930;318;besides, a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life.
I:9930;319;I especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons.
I:9930;320;if you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see.
I:9930;321;This film draws you slowly and convincingly into a close, loving family and its unresolved pain from the past.
I:9930;322;You feel like you live their sorrows and triumphs with them.
I:9930;323;Jim Sheridan's In America is an autobiographical piece which he claims is his most honest and personal film to date.
I:9930;324;Although it is no My Left Foot, it can certainly hold its own with his other movies, In The Name Of The Father, The Boxer, and The Field.
I:9930;325;I found it to be uplifting .
I:9930;326;a breath of fresh air.
I:9930;327;Christy talks to her brother every night and believes he has promised her three magic wishes .
I:9930;328;He guarantees, from Heaven, they will come true.
I:9930;329;the Sullivans have moved to New York to start anew after the boy's death, and also so Johnny can have a serious acting career.
I:9930;330;They move into a building, in a dilapidated neighborhood.
I:9930;331;The two girls make it even more so.
I:9930;332;this family's journey to come to grips with their loss while searching for meaning in a new world is enriching and beautiful.
I:9930;333;There are moments of humor and tenderness that are expressed in a totally unique and emotionally honest way.
I:9930;334;Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine give remarkable performances, and Sarah and Emma Bolger are as natural, innocent and precocious as can be.
I:9930;335;Christy is wise beyond her years.
I:9930;336;As she says at one point, she feels like she carries the family on her shoulders.
I:9930;337;Name the film directors whose first film won Academy Awards for their co. stars.
I:9930;338;Brenda Fricker won an Oscar for Best Actress.
I:9930;339;two more films, four more Oscar nominations .
I:9930;340;Morton was nominated for Best Actress by the Academy.
I:9930;341;On second viewing, it's just as powerful.
I:9930;342;"i suspect this is, in part, because ""In America"" is the kind of story that the Irish do best."
I:9930;343;there's also a rich stream of magic.
I:9930;344;"Christy, the older daughter, has been ""talking"" to Frankie every night and believes that he has given her three wishes."
I:9930;345;Seeing that this moment could go either way, she uses one: Please let us into America.
I:9930;346;And the kids have befriended Mateo, a neighbor .
I:9930;347;a fierce, hostile African artist who, unknown to them, is dying of AIDS.You watch all this, mouth open, as if you are watching a documentary.
I:9930;348;Credit the writing and, equally, the performances: Samantha Morton is all eyes and hope.
I:9930;349;"She said, ""Good, my sister's in the car."""
I:9930;350;there are scenes in this movie that will haunt you all your days.
I:9930;351;Oh, the wisdom of kids.
I:9930;352;They form the friendships that lead the family back to life.
I:9930;353;You can see some kind of happy ending coming, but you absolutely can't see how .
I:9930;354;Christy's words to her father cut deep, but they cut with such love.
I:9930;355;that Johnny has to say.
I:9930;356;the catharsis, when it comes, is glorious.
I:9930;357;There's a second one, a printed line at the start of the credits .
I:9930;358;as you will see in those moments when your tears don't blur the screen.
I:9930;359;Being an Irish immigrant, I happened on this movie a few years ago, in the early hours, and on some cable network.
I:9930;360;The acting and the actors were superb.
I:9930;361;This story, about an Irish family that immigrates to Manhattan after the death of a son, is a sweet film about family, loss and new beginnings.
I:9930;362;what I liked best about the movie were the very strong performances by the two young girls and the neighbor, Mateo.
I:9930;363;the story wasn't strong enough for me to consider it outstanding, but it's an interesting watch, a nice change of pace from Hollywood and a good family film.
I:9930;364;sheridan's achievements with the pen and behind the camera are enhanced by a quintet of remarkable performances.
I:9930;365;Oscar nominees Samantha Morton and Djimon Hounsou are flawless in bringing to life the characters of the mother and the ailing neighbor .
I:9930;366;but in truth, Paddy Considine as the father and real.
I:9930;367;life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger are just as perfect in their respective roles as the father and the two young daughters.
I:9930;368;This an unusually honest, provocative and touching film that deserves the widest possible audience.
I:9930;369;In America is a true winner.
I:9930;370;The acting is just phenomenal and you'll remember the story for the rest of your life.
I:9930;371;What is remarkable about the film is the family's ability to make the best out of what they have.
I:9930;372;There are moments of laughter, pain, joy, and grief.
I:9930;373;The characters are absolutely unforgettable.
I:9930;374;this is a great film.
I:9930;375;In America is a beautiful movie.
I:9930;376;incredibly moving and stirs up many emotions!!
I:9930;377;An Irish family move to the states for a better lufe.
I:9930;378;and their journey is incredible!!
I:9930;379;Two magical moments occur when the picture and the music deliver a punch.
I:9930;380;This movie brings a smile to your face and a feel good feeling to your soul.
I:9930;381;In the ending credits, the film is dedicated to a real.
I:9930;382;treating on their first Halloween, and go door to door in their squalid tenement.
I:9930;383;I've seen it touted in respectable rags as one of the best films of the year .
I:9930;384;3.5 is just right for something too schmaltzy for my curmudgeonly sensitivities despite some fine acting performances, particularly those of Morton and Considine.
I:9930;385;This is a GOOD movie.
I:9930;386;it tells the true story of director Jim Sheridan and his family .
I:9930;387;it's good to watch this movie at this period in history, when America is in trouble and everybody seems to hate us.
I:9930;388;some of the magic comes from the character of Mateo, wonderfully played by Amistad's Djimon Hounsou.
I:9930;389;He's an eccentric artist who lives downstairs and befriends the family.
I:9930;390;In America is great because it is primarily seen through the eyes of the little girl, Christy (Sarah Bolger was nominated for an Oscar for this performance).
I:9930;391;We see her heartbreak and still her sense of wonder at life.
I:9930;392;djimon Hounsou is brilliant as Mateo, and overlooked artist, slowly fading away in his dumpy apartment until Ariel and Christy come trick.
I:9930;393;Christy is the unsung star of the movie, narrating the entire film with a divine understanding about everything that her family is going through.
I:9930;394;in America is one of the most authentically emotional films I've ever seen.
I:9930;395;Johnny and Sarah Sullivan move to New York from their native Ireland.
I:9930;396;Their love for one another is undeniable, but they still cannot put the death of their son behind them.
I:9930;397;Their older daughter Christie is constantly filming their life with her camcorder and their younger daughter Ariel is beguiling with her sweet innocence amidst the squalor of their surroundings.
I:9930;398;The young girls win him over, and soon he is a friend of the whole Sullivan family.
I:9930;399;The acting by all cast members is superb and the story is poignant and compelling.
I:9930;400;In this case it's dreamy, magnificent art, and remembering the way things felt is every bit as valuable as remembering the way things were.
I:9930;401;In America reveals the amount of sacrifice and amount of courage it is needed to relinquish the past in order to fare on to the future.
I:9930;402;"one of the main reasons ""In America"" is so endearing is because of this phenomenal cast."
I:9930;403;Paddy Considine is able to portray a man deep in affliction but is able to summon up a cheerful face for the children.
I:9930;404;Real life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger are ever delightful.
I:9930;405;This easily could have failed and be comical, but Sarah Bolger manages to deliver it in such an honest and convincing fashion.
I:9930;406;"djimon Hounsou, who was first introduced by Steven Spielberg as the slave Cinque in ""Amistad"" and has played similar characters after that, delivers his best performance as Mateo."
I:9930;407;As Mateo, this finally allows Hounsou to reveal not only his softer side but also exhibit his range.
I:9930;408;rounded performance where he can be both intimidating and amiable, and forceful yet yielding.
I:9930;409;please continue my review at [.]
I:9930;410;christy and Ariel, the two daughters, make the best of the situation as they live in a crack house with constant danger surrounding them.
I:9930;411;treating seems to open an internal door into Mateo's soul, which allows him to feel the warmth, kindness, and love.
I:9930;412;This leads Mateo and the family together in reciprocal friendship where their true feelings will be shared, which will end in personal growth for each family member.
I:9930;413;It is evident that the death has affected the Sheridan's as they deliver a complex and emotional tale of closure.
I:9930;414;One of the scenes that brings strong spiritual symbolism to the film is when Christy and Ariel dress up for Halloween.
I:9930;415;For example, the addition of the clips from the digital camcorder offer a genuine affection that enhances the emotional difficulties of the family.
I:9930;416;The closure of the film offers much contemplation in the backdrop of life and the continuum of life, which will bring the audience to tears.
I:9930;417;"After, seeing ""In America"" I was moved."
I:9930;418;after I finished watching it I felt deeply touched by the story of the Irish family who finds peace in the States.
I:9930;419;Jim Sheridan has written and directed a master.
I:9930;420;even more impressive on a low.
I:9930;421;but, what made this film special is despite the tragic loss of the son the family seems to move on through their circumstances and struggles in America becoming a stronger family unit.
I:9930;422;It was nice to see a movie that wasn't fluffed.
I:9930;423;This movie touches everyone on some level and I suppose it being seen through the eyes of a young Christy makes it even more special and precious.
I:9930;424;the young girls are really make this movie shine.
I:9930;425;Great performances in the entire cast Samantha Morton got a well.
I:9930;426;A sweet, magical movie where love conquers everything, even grief, and where hope can bridge even the infinite which divides the living from the dead.
I:9930;427;stellar performances by everyone, including Samantha Morton, Paddy Considine, and Sarah and Emmy Bolger.
I:9930;428;At our house we see about 50 movies a month and this one is well above average.
I:9930;429;I doubt the angst of family catharsis is the trait that will give this film the greatest lasting value, although the emphasis on emotional storyline is not to be discounted.
I:9930;430;In particular, Christy's performance transcends all other in this lovely little film about an immigrant family coming to a new land and finding a way over its own tragedy .
I:9930;431;"christy's work is more than good acting
I:9930;432;She regularly performs magic both in the character and in the story, magic that transcends an AIDS patient into a loving neighbor and magic that helps her dad overcome his own emotional demons.
I:9930;433;Christy gets a lot of help in the movie from good lines in the script, exceptional lighting, and wonderful direction.
I:9930;434;"together with her younger sister's charm and infectious joy, they transform the residents of their ""junkie building"" into a nice group of neighbors that might be just like your own."
I:9930;435;so all praise to these girls, who made this little film into something pretty mighty that told a remarkable tale of broken hearts, challenges and torment and turned it into something magical.
I:9930;436;At the start of In America we are introduced a family of illegal immigrants.
I:9930;437;the family struggles to survive in New York City.
I:9930;438;treat results in the family ends up with the girls making a connection with the man who screams, a tormented Nigerian artist, Mateo (Djimon Hounsou) who lives downstairs.
I:9930;439;I think everyone who gets caught up in the decision will be surprised by the choice.
I:9930;440;both Morton and Hounsou were nominated for Oscars, in the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor categories respectively, but it was the interplay between the real life sisters playing Christie and Ariel that captivates us.
I:9930;441;It is so natural and unaffected that its reality comes as a shock.
I:9930;442;The acting in this film is uniformly strong, which is why it is easy to forgive those points where Sheridan become a bit too manipulative.
I:9930;443;although commentaries are not always useful, Sheridan's is completely informal, personal, and authentic.
I:9930;444;Paddy Considine is such a charmer, but this story squeezes him until the pips squeak, and a person behind the charm can emerge.
I:9930;445;Samantha Morton too is excellent.
I:9930;446;Then just now I read, above, the fatuous one.
I:9930;447;Well, good luck to him and his sad career.
I:9930;448;They have little money but there's lots of love in their household.
I:9930;449;life sisters from Ireland) are smart and sweet and lovable.
I:9930;450;The family is poor but surprisingly cheerful and happy to be in America.
I:9930;451;And then there is their strange neighbor, played by Djimon Housau, a Nigerian artist who is carrying an awful burden but who lets the little girls warm his heart.
I:9930;452;however, this is an uplifting film.
I:9930;453;And it shows the sunshine side of the immigrant experience.
I:9930;454;The acting is outstandingly good.
I:9930;455;It's well paced and has a positive message.
I:9930;456;And for that I do recommend it.
I:9930;457;This is a beauitful film.
I:9930;458;Their acting is so adorable,refreshing and natural.
I:9930;459;It is a really an uplifting film in the end.
I:9930;460;The directing, acting, cinematography, tone and script of the movie grabs your heart, tears it apart and yet many moments of hope and laughter come through.
I:9930;461;It is a story of a determined Irish family, illegally immigrating to America via the Canadian border.
I:9930;462;They want to start a new life, and move forward after the death of their five year old son from a brain tumor.
I:9930;463;all the performances are top.
I:9930;464;"Paddy does an amazing job as the ""Da"" ."
I:9930;465;Her eyes show the soul of sadness and gentle love for her family.
I:9930;466;She is willing to take a chance at death for another baby.
I:9930;467;The angry artist on the floor below is played by a wonderful African actor Djimon Hounsou.
I:9930;468;His story and the love of a struggling Irish family make confrontation of blame, anger, strength in crisis, and hope the polish to a amazing movie.
I:9930;469;New York characters are raw and graphic.
I:9930;470;The angelic children shine through.
I:9930;471;I had hoped to see a film that is observant and critical.
I:9930;472;Evil looking black guy who ends up to be loving and wonderful when he meets the two cute girls.
I:9930;473;The enormous hospital bill is magically paid by someone , so the film can close with a happy end.
I:9930;474;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:9930;475;It is actually story of Jim Sheridans coming to New York with his family to become actor.
I:9930;476;The story is so original and the acting makes this film a glorious triumph.
I:9930;477;The oldest daughter Christy (Sarah Bolger) is probably one of the smarter people in the film, and Sarah Bolger gives a flawless performance for such a young girl.
I:9930;478;This man's name is Mateo (played brilliantly by Djimon Hounsou) and he is a brilliant artist with quite a bit of emotional problems.
I:9930;479;in America features one of the best ensembles I have ever seen.
I:9930;480;Every actor is perfect in every scene.
I:9930;481;Djimon Hounsou and Paddy Considine give the best performances in the entire film, and Jim Sheridan wrote and directed every gorgeous shot of the film.
I:9930;482;The film has such a deeper message, relating not just to immigrants, but to every person who watches this film.
I:9930;483;This is truly one of the most unforgettable movies I have ever seen.
I:9930;484;I highly recommend it and have sent several to soldiers as gifts.
I:9930;485;"Director Jim Sheridan (""In The Name Of The Father"", ""My Left Foot"") has crafted one of the most emotionally honest and satisfying films in years."
I:9930;486;Despite this gloom and terrible poverty, the family thrives happily, mostly due to the amazing resilience and resolve of the two young daughters.
I:9930;487;The loss of their son and an impending dangerous pregnancy are set against a backdrop of constant near danger and immense naivety (yet remarkable intuition) of the girls.
I:9930;488;Mateo, (Djimon Hounsou) the AIDS stricken painter downstairs befriends the girls and provides some of the most frightening and yet emotionally substantial moments in the film.
I:9930;489;The family is always in near crisis, yet they survive day by day, relishing everything those `in America' take for granted.
I:9930;490;This is a rare film about real emotions.
I:9930;491;The acting of the children, as mentioned, was wonderful and believable.
I:9930;492;NYC, with all its flaws, really does have a big heart for people who are willing to share theirs.
I:9930;493;but it does offer a positive message of hope and family and shows that good things DO happen to good people.
I:9930;494;I loved it and will recommend it to everyone I know.
I:9930;495;good parts to watch the brilliant parts.
I:9930;496;He came to America illegally with his wife and two children in the early 80s to become a Broadway actor .
I:9930;497;As Sheridan emphasizes, it is the story of a loving family.
I:9930;498;The two Irish girls who play the daughters in this family have mesmerizingly sweet faces and manners .
I:9930;499;the film is worth seeing for them alone.
I:9930;500;They are completely believable and the movie would be nothing without them, although other actors in this film also put in very good performances.
I:9930;501;The line is one of the most memorable film moments I have ever seen.
I:9930;502;It releases tension, reveals something the little girl has been holding inside for the whole movie and is one more example of the pitch.
I:9930;503;perfect nature of the film.
I:9930;504;The script deals with powerful emotions, yet manages to be subtle in the details.
I:9930;505;i have never seen a better performance by child actors.
I:9930;506;She is pretending to be the Statue of Liberty.
I:9930;507;She is spouting a stream words about America and freedom.
I:9930;508;It is a small moment in the film but perfect.
I:9930;509;I love movies where people triumph over the things that life can throw your way.
I:9930;510;old boy in the movie, and the movie was dedicated to him.
I:9930;511;The trailer touches something deep down inside you, and the whole film sticks with you long afterwards.
I:9930;512;the two girls in this (real life sisters), Christy and Ariel are absolutely outstanding for children so young, and showed some real emotion.
I:9930;513;Jim Sheridan captured every raw emotion that could be possibly portrayed in this, and all the actors do an excellent job.
I:9930;514;In the center of Hell's Kitchen they try to come to terms with their grief and maintain the strength of their family.
I:9930;515;The charming children are played by Emma and Sarah Bolger.
I:9930;516;He gives them a new perspective on life and living.
I:9930;517;Djimon is thrilling and captivating as he is in all his movies.
I:9930;518;this story is beautifully written, casted and filmed.
I:9930;519;He wrote In America with his daughters Naomi and Kirsten.
I:9930;520;the movie's characters are transformed by many human emotions: love, friendship, grief, forgiveness, rediscovery, mutual respect, and laughter.
I:9930;521;Be prepared to laugh and cry sometimes both at the same time but at the end your heart will feel fuller.
I:9930;522;The two daughters played by real life sisters (Sarah and Emma Bolger) give good performances.
I:9930;523;The younger of the two is liable to be a fantastic actress if she keeps up with the acting business.
I:9930;524;amoungst the other characters is one that they call the screaming man.
I:9930;525;He is dying from aids but when he meets the two little girls you can see that he is harmless and loves the lifeforce that they exude.
I:9930;526;at times the hard luck issues of the family beome tiresome but this movie is still worth viewing.
I:9930;527;It's a lovely tale and would be a great flick to put on when there's absolutely nothing on all of the 6 million channels on cable.
I:9930;528;The Bolger sisters and Samantha Morton shine in one of the best films of this year.
I:9930;529;"Djimon Honsou's awesome performance in the role of ""Mateo"" deserves the oscar for best supporting actor."
I:9930;530;But overall this is a film full of memorable scenes, great music and cinemtography and one of the very best endings I have ever seen.
I:9930;531;The power of the ending alone gets this one a five star rating.
I:9930;532;There are many rewards in giving this film a chance.
I:9930;533;Samantha Morton is a bundle of motherly love and devotion yet within her huge eyes you can see that she is also masking a deep and relentless guilt.
I:9930;534;In America is a visual and graphic poem about Love and about Family.
I:9930;535;This film is very well done.
I:9930;536;This is solid, albeit emotional, entertainment.
I:9930;537;this is a beautiful film, superbly acted by a fine cast.
I:9930;538;The cast members have a powerful chemistry which really gives impact to the characters' interconnected relationships.
I:9930;539;In America is a story that's told with a gritty, sweaty urban realism, yet many scenes have a magical, almost fairy.
I:9930;540;Also effective is the film's use of classic songs to heighten the emotion of the story.
I:9930;541;In America is an intriguing portrait of multiethnic urban life, and also offers a compelling look at life in a family that is struggling financially.
I:9930;542;Although there are moments of pain, there are also nice humorous touches and the film overall has a genuine sweetness that never seems fake.
I:9930;543;This story deals with enduring themes: family ties, friendship, and surviving tragedy.
I:9930;544;But most of all it's about hope and embracing life.
I:9930;545;Just saw this film for the second time at the theater, and the metaphor that comes to mind is that of peeling an onion.
I:9930;546;It was clear from the first that there was good acting, and I expected only one of those European.
I:9930;547;"style ""slice of life"" films, but I was delighted that the story actually built up a direction and a momentum and built to a truly impressive conclusion."
I:9930;548;Shakily photographed opening scenes turned out to be a deliberate and very appropriate work of craftsmanship linked into the heart of the film.
I:9930;549;Upon a second viewing, the spiritual/religious references were revealed more clearly, and I was convinced that my emotional response had been no mere fluke of mood or of the actors alone, but that this is actually a work of art, carefully set up with multiple layers and levels of understanding.
I:9930;550;This is an awesome film whose themes and emotions go well beyond what most films will even attempt, although the film repeatedly shows restraint to try to keep such portrayals from appearing over.
I:9930;551;of reality) this is a film that can be considered authentically religious.
I:9930;552;"Religious NOT in some simple sense of simply saying ""let us pray,"" but in a real."
I:9930;553;life and complex, challenging way.
I:9930;554;This is a great movie.
I:9930;555;well worth repeated viewings as viewers explore its many nuances and challenges.
I:9930;556;After all, when one sets about peeling onions, it has this way of making the eyes water up, and that sort of cleansing effect is what this film is really about.
I:9930;557;There are films that are so humane, and make us love their characters so deeply, that they make us better people (at least temporarily) just for watching them.
I:9930;558;Making Christie the narrator was a master stroke, for the film's touches of magic realism are all the more believable for being a child's perceptions.
I:9930;559;(One unforgettable scene makes a baseball.
I:9930;560;give astonishingly strong, moving performances.
I:9930;561;are as enchanting as any child actors who have ever stood in front of a camera.
I:9930;562;cream sundaes Christie and Ariel eat.
I:9930;563;But love and forgiveness are in abundance here, as are faith, hope and charity.
I:9930;564;Both have the same level of unsentimental poignancy and meticulous craft.
I:9930;565;The girls make the acquaintance of a reclusive African artist (Djimon Hounsou) who lives downstairs from them, and that unusual friendship helps see the family through their grief and recover their hope for the future and for each other.
I:9930;566;In America was inspired by two events in the life of its writer and director, Jim Sheridan.
I:9930;567;Sheridan has combined these two seminal events into one generation with the help of his two daughters, Naomi and Kirsten Sheridan, who contributed their childhood memories to the screenplay.
I:9930;568;And this somehow cures their ills.
I:9930;569;The actresses who play Christy and her younger sister Ariel really are sisters, and they give some of the most charming and impressive performances by child actors that I have ever seen.
I:9930;570;Samantha Morton is also particularly good as their broken.
I:9930;571;The family's emotional journey is poignant and rings of truth.
I:9930;572;The details are a little fantastic.
I:9930;573;"I recommend ""In America"" for its fine performances and its unique and slightly fanciful perspective."
I:9930;574;As someone who lost a sibling as a child, I can confirm that the sentiments in this movie are right on target.
I:9930;575;It is portrayed from the eyes of a child, and to me, it looks very very real.
I:9930;576;"the ""Et"" element was good."
I:9930;577;evrybody fit well within there roles.
I:9930;578;'In America' is an impressive little film about great loss and not appreciating what you have.
I:9930;579;The acting is very good in this film, especially the two young daughters who I felt were above and beyond most kids in these types of films.
I:9930;580;The story could have been a sappy mess, but turns out to be a subtle winner.
I:9930;581;It pulls the heartstrings, but not in a heavy, forced, sentimental way.
I:9930;582;the actors and actresses (not sure which one the coffeehouse across the way from the Hell's Kitchen tenement slum transvestite group truly falls into) in the film all perform brilliantly.
I:9930;583;It is a testament to director/writer Jim Sheridan that he solicits such honest seamless performances out of each of the main players that act out the events of a battered and beleaguered family that comes across the Canadian border illegally into New York City.
I:9930;584;the film brilliantly turns into less of a movie about New York City slums and more about the powerful grace of the human experience, more about a family going through the grieving process and sticking together through difficult times.
I:9930;585;It truly is that good.
I:9930;586;My wife and I have loved this movie for a long time.
I:9930;587;The actors, especially the little girls, are fantastic.
I:9930;588;"This is one of the best ""redemption"" stories in the movies."
I:9930;589;It is beautifully done, you feel every emotion.
I:9930;590;My review is meant to encourage people to watch the actually movie!
I:9930;591;In America is extremely endearing, and is able to convey real emotional expression tastefully without bordering cheesy, and that takes craft.
I:9930;592;What I got instead, was a wonderful, mind.
I:9930;593;provoking film, with great acting!!
I:9930;594;The plot is pretty basic on the surface.
I:9930;595;A family of 4 moves from Ireland to Manhattan and attempts to restart their lives after the death of their young son Frankie.
I:9930;596;While living there, they take up a friendship with Mateo, an artist, who is strickened with an un.
I:9930;597;truly a fascinating movie, not depressing, though my review may lead you to think otherwise.
I:9930;598;Highly recommended, if not for the plot, then certainly for the superb acting displayed by no.
I:9930;599;The acting was great, the ideas were great.
I:9930;600;Yes, they bring up Frankie at odd times, but it still makes for a very entertaining, heartfelt movie.
I:9930;601;I recommend it to anyone not looking for a Hollywood Blockbuster.
I:9930;602;This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
I:9930;603;The child who playsthe lead role is just wonderful.
I:9930;604;Watch it with your children andgrandchildren.
I:9930;605;A wonderfuland humorous story, with a few very exciting moments and a niceending.
I:9930;606;I absolutely love this movie.
I:9930;607;Djimon Hounsou's performance is both convincing and strong in thismovie.
I:9930;608;It's an absolute must have if you are a fan of his work!
I:9930;609;But when i went back I found this piece of gold.
I:9930;610;Ironically, Mateo himself is battling for his own life.
I:9930;611;Breathtaking performances by each of the four family members, but the real life sisters that played the daughters make Mary Kate and Ashley look like a sick joke.
I:9930;612;Samantha Morton may well have deserved to win an Oscar based on this performance, but having seen the film again on the small screen I take comfort from the certain knowledge that she will one day win.
I:9930;613;Her performance as a grieving mother holding together her family and herself is subtle, moving and very powerful.
I:9930;614;paddy Considine is magnificent as the husband and father of a loving family that is breaking down from the inside, whilst struggling to find a role within this blackened unit.
I:9930;615;but, the real wonder and find of this film are the two young girls.
I:9930;616;being real life sisters may have helped but, my god, they played with such resonance, such force that when watching the hospital scene I cried.
I:9930;617;This is a movie for everyone to love.
I:9930;618;good film without being sappy or dorky.
I:9930;619;The one good point about this Irish.
I:9930;620;successful Defense of his Family.
I:9930;621;I watched In America with two savvy co. eds jaded by Kill Bill movies and Hollywood special effects.
I:9930;622;This movie is very touching.
I:9930;623;It's told with a terrific script.
I:9930;624;The minor characters are bigger than life, New York low life types, very believable.
I:9930;625;Christy and Ariel, the couples two remaining children, are sisters in real life, and treat each other with an amazing tenderness in the movie.
I:9930;626;The acting that the children do is incredible.
I:9930;627;This is as close to perfect as a movie can get.
I:9930;628;A realistic look into a family, complete with all the struggles and the moments that make the struggles worth the effort.
I:9930;629;I saw it in a freezing theatre and the film broke twice.
I:9930;630;and even with those distractions I found the film mesmerizing.
I:9930;631;give us a chance to prove we will spend our money on the good stuff.
I:9930;632;felt and moving films of our time.
I:9930;633;Wanted to see some more of Samantha Morton's work, and I did.
I:9930;634;this is a nice movie, though I think the 'feelgoodness' of it is a bit contrived.
I:9930;635;Once in residence in a squalid tenement, they begin a new life together with high hopes and great expectations, although haunted by the death of a toddler.
I:9930;636;(The nature of that assistance is best revealed in the film.)
I:9930;637;I admire so much what he has contributed to our understanding of the courage and determination which many of his characters somehow summon in response to severe hardship.
I:9930;638;Sure, it could have been an over the top sentimental movie, but the suburb acting and cinematography saved it.
I:9930;639;The movie deals with death and redemption and the hope that America offers for those who have lost all hope.
I:9930;640;old son, an Irish family illegally immigrates to America to make a fresh start.
I:9930;641;throughout the movie we see a struggle for faith.
I:9930;642;Despite their poverty, they see America as hope for redemption as a family.
I:9930;643;The motley crew of characters they encounter show what makes America great.
I:9930;644;"Jim Sheridan's ""In America"" is so imbued with good feelings and good intentions that it comes as a bit of a surprise that the film as a whole turns out to be less than the sum of its parts."
I:9930;645;the film, written by Jim, Naomi and Kirsten Sheridan, tells the story of an Irish immigrant family embarking on a new life in Manhattan.
I:9930;646;eyed wonderment provides the greatest joy of the film.
I:9930;647;"As with most immigrant sagas, the family in ""In America"" experiences a great deal of difficulty adjusting to life in a new land."
I:9930;648;Mateo is deeply embittered about life (we find out why about halfway through the film), yet is instantly softened the moment he meets these two disarming children one Halloween night.
I:9930;649;The Sheridans bring a warm, heartfelt tone to the work, capturing, with both honesty and compassion, the struggles that immigrant families face no matter what their country of origin.
I:9930;650;"mania"" was sweeping the nation, and the Sheridans try to infuse some of the magic from that film into their own through the use of both direct and indirect references to Spielberg's masterpiece (at one point the family goes to see the film, and, later, in a crucial scene about filial devotion, Johnny attempts to win Ariel an E. t. doll at a carnival)."
I:9930;651;It is simply a given that Mateo is more noble and enlightened than everybody around him, and the movie ends up patronizing him in the process.
I:9930;652;"Thus, while one can enjoy the bits and pieces that make up the film, ""In America"" itself may leave the audience feeling a bit unsatisfied and frustrated in the long run."
I:9930;653;I truly loved this film.
I:9930;654;this film captures your hopes and your heart.
I:9930;655;It is in the tradition of grand old movies and one of the best I have seen in years.
I:9930;656;The Bolger sisters as sisters in the story are remarkable.
I:9930;657;Their acting so facile and believable.
I:9930;658;Mateo (Housou) is a true presence.
I:9930;659;This film is definitely one of a kind.
I:9930;660;It's strongest aspect is the magnificent acting by all the characters.
I:9930;661;The heartfelt acting and beautiful filmography is what separates it from being a cliche.
I:9930;662;Every now and then a good movie will come along with a basic and classic message that everyone seems to forget: Family heals by sticking together.
I:9930;663;This story about an Irish family moving to America after the tragic death of their two year old son is a magical journey through the complex human spirits.
I:9930;664;The acting is generally good, but the most interesting characters are the two daughters.
I:9930;665;Full of hope, they move into a rundown tenement in the roughest part of Manhattan.
I:9930;666;Despite everything, the girls find New York a nice escape from their past lives and think there's magic in Manhattan.
I:9930;667;Rather, this film portrays realistic and heartfelt emotions of grief and bewilderment, sorrow and happiness.
I:9930;668;This is a delightful film worthy of praise and admiration.
I:9930;669;The Sheridiens are impressive script writers, their sketch of an Irish couple living through the pitfalls and triumphs of a family is very well done.
I:9930;670;If the intent of this movie was to create a pointless tale of a couple of ordinary folk with two very nice and mature children, they succeeded admirably.
I:9930;671;Sarah is the quiet, yet strong center of this Irish family illegally entering the country in pursuit of the American dream, quietly filming documenting the important landmarks and achievements in her family's life.
I:9930;672;the family sells their rattle.
I:9930;673;the family works together to liven up their dank apartment and Johnny starts rehearsing for his auditions.
I:9930;674;While he appears to be healthy, a refrigerator full of medicine reveals otherwise.
I:9930;675;No one really knew how you got it.
I:9930;676;Despite the fear and panic of the rest of civilization, Johnny and Sarah welcome Mateo to their apartment and adopt him into their family.
I:9930;677;Her new daughter will only survive with a blood transfusion from Christy, who proves once again that she is the family's backbone.
I:9930;678;and with the birth of their new child in America, the first signs of true emotion come back to Johnny.
I:9930;679;the film has beautiful moments and the astounding acting of true.
I:9930;680;The film is superbly acted by all and only those with a heart of granite will not have a lump in their throats during some scenes.
I:9930;681;It's as if every scene is a glimpse of life to be cherished, much like the moments captured on a movie camera (futuristic or otherwise).
I:9930;682;for the acting alone, this is a film worthwhile seeing, but unlike some of its rave reviews, I do not concur that this is the best film of the year .
I:9930;683;Of course, he reminds the family what's important.
I:9930;684;(Hounsou actually performs with great warmth and makes the best of this cliched role).
I:9930;685;Morton and the kids are good, but Considine can't suggest the necessary degree of inner turmoil.
I:9930;686;The movie was not exactly a everybody lives happily ever after sort, but it did portray the goodness in many people's hearts, regardlesss of where they live or how they live.
I:9930;687;with my high school sophomores, I do a unit on the American Dream.
I:9930;688;But their dream was the same.
I:9930;689;the same as it is for many, many Americans: We just want to live out our passions in peace and freedom.
I:9930;690;This film reminds us that we need each other to do so.
I:9930;691;'In America' is a poignant film about an Irish family trying to survive in new york after the death of their young baby boy.
I:9930;692;The cast play their roles to perfection and Sam Morton excels as a mother trying to hold her family together.
I:9930;693;Paddy Considine is completely authentic as the father who fights to support his family, whilst fighting his own grief at the same time.
I:9930;694;The two delightful actresses who play his daughters (sisters in real life) are a joy to watch and are incredibly natural and unaffected in front of the camera.
I:9930;695;This film follows the family as they rebuild their lives and make friends with their artist neighbour who lives downstairs (played excellently by Djimon Hounsou) and it is wonderful to see the young siblings playing joyfully amidst the turmoil of their homelife, seemingly oblivious to the struggles the family has to endure.
I:9930;696;This is a touching film and one that will stay with you after you've watched it and it can easily be viewed again and again.
I:9930;697;One of the most beautiful, moving films I know of.
I:9930;698;Touching, sad, heroic all at once.
I:9930;699;It's just as deep as the film.
I:9930;700;Once in a while, movie gem reaches out and touches your soul.
I:9930;701;I have added this film to my collection of favorites, and those I will savor when I need a gut wrenching cry.
I:9930;702;A young Irish couple with their two daughters move to the neighborhood to try to establish a new life.
I:9930;703;One scene had me on the edge of my seat.
I:9930;704;the youngest daughter, Ariel, has a spirit about her, a curiosity and charisma which brings caring people into the fold of the family.
I:9930;705;She is bold and unafraid, yet she yearns for the love of her father, who is emotionally distant following the death of his son.
I:9930;706;the oldest daughter, Kristine, is wise beyond her years.
I:9930;707;She successfully camptures life on her camcorder, which she uses constantly, almost a video diary if you will.
I:9930;708;the mother is strong and loves her husband with all her heart.
I:9930;709;She is the glue which binds her family together.
I:9930;710;"their neighbor, the ""screaming man"" of the building, is a tormented young artist."
I:9930;711;In America tells a very personal story, one that is loosely based on Sheridan's own family.
I:9930;712;autobiographical film that will incite joy, sadness, heartache and hope a hundred times over.
I:9930;713;the film tells the story of an Irish family moving to America for a clean slate after the death of their son Frankie.
I:9930;714;his emotional core has been numbed by Frankie's passing and it affects his ability to keep a job as well as his relationship with his wife Sarah (Morton) and their two daughters.
I:9930;715;Christy (Sarah Bolger) makes new memories among the old with her cherished camcorder and has one.
I:9930;716;"They hold their breath as Mateo stares them down, not knowing what to make of him after having heard his agonizing screams behind his closed door the very day they moved in, the words ""KEEP OUT"" emblazoned in large hand."
I:9930;717;It is the start of a dynamic and beautiful friendship for all involved, one that makes them realize that tragedy travels in large circles and cannot be avoided no matter how far they move to escape it.
I:9930;718;In the end, everyone learns to face their grief head on, their lives fresh with emotional wounds but also the wherewithal to remedy them.
I:9930;719;In America contains bravado performances from every actor in its small and intimate cast.
I:9930;720;Hounsou doles a memorable turn as well as the tortured Mateo, a man who finds himself sustained by the strong and vibrant lifeforce of Johnny's family while his own ebbs away.
I:9930;721;life siblings, are the genuine article of child actors .
I:9930;722;Sheridan's small cast of characters is beautifully depicted as being poor in capital but rich in spirit.
I:9930;723;"bottom line: One of the best films you've never watched, ""In America"" will bring a tear to your eye and a warmth to your heart unlike any drama out there."
I:9930;724;It is proof that a film's personal touches are what successfully manage to touch someone personally.
I:9930;725;This movie was just superbly done.
I:9930;726;the acting in this movie is just phenomenal and impeccable.
I:9930;727;Though they live in the poorest conditions, the family still keeps their chins up and makes the best of their situation.
I:9930;728;The story is full of real.
I:9930;729;life problems and situations yet the family seems to make it in the end through hope, faith, and a few miracles.
I:9930;730;truly touching and well told story.
I:9930;731;I watch it more than 10 times, my kids love it too.
I:9930;732;It makes me happy everytimes I watch it, to be satisfy in what we are today.
I:9930;733;"Jim Sheridan's ""In America"" is a deeply personal film that boasts some of the finest ensemble acting of recent years."
I:9930;734;It is also a film that illustrates how important it is to retain a measure of hope and faith in our lives.
I:9930;735;"the performances in ""In America"" absolutely sparkle."
I:9930;736;But it is the Bolger sisters who steal the film.
I:9930;737;"Both Sarah and Emma are astonishing in their roles and their sincerity and sweetness infuse ""In America"" with a degree of honest emotion that is so very difficult to capture on celluloid."
I:9930;738;In addition to its solid writing, directing, and acting, this film also has the surprising effect of increasing one's affection for both E. t. the Extra.
I:9930;739;"This is a film that you watch and at the end you ask yourself ""what did I just see?"""
I:9930;740;this is a film about the director's own family and the pain of the loss of his own brother and eventually the triumph over the past.
I:9930;741;For as well made and acted as this film is .
I:9930;742;and it is superb .
I:9930;743;And the director's own children help write the screenplay.
I:9930;744;There is a beautiful contrast between the innocence and belief of the young against the pain and confusion of the father.
I:9930;745;The film presents a picture of fatherhood, of love and escape from grief.
I:9930;746;Truely masterly full of heart.
I:9930;747;Very very surreal but then that's what movie's about, the stupidest thing done in the perfectest moment creates the most remarkable memory.
I:9930;748;the older daughter's songs works miracuously too once she sings.
I:9930;749;The movie was never melodramatic, it's heartwarming and deeply moving, besides the wonderful and perceptive script of the Sheridans, I think the use of the narration and the insights of the little girl was a key factor to that.
I:9930;750;And the ending was beautiful!
I:9930;751;It is a poignant closure to characters that are in desperate need of one.
I:9930;752;The reviews of the film were excellent, and I knew I would enjoy an Irish family moving to the United States.
I:9930;753;The two daughters Christy and Ariel, played by real life sisters Emily and Sarah Bolger, are endearing, and see a magical side to an area of New York most people would avoid at all costs.
I:9930;754;Writer and director Jim Sheridan is able to capture the girls' innocence remarkably well.
I:9930;755;Johnny and Sarah are authentically Irish yet they have a universal appeal.
I:9930;756;New York City is colorful even in the midst of pain and tragedy.
I:9930;757;Family life is celebrated yet the conflicts are real.
I:9930;758;Perhaps what made this film most outstanding in my eyes is that even though I instinctively knew how the film would probably end, it still held my interest and had a degree of suspense to it.
I:9930;759;This only happens when a film captures a viewer's heart while respecting the viewer's intelligence.
I:9930;760;There are several reasons that make this movie powerful and heartbreaking but it is mainly the five incredible actors that make this a film you remember for a long time.
I:9930;761;A film that is able to give you a little hope for a better world, and a hope for immigrants or new begginers everywhere.
I:9930;762;New life in America and a new life without a beloved member of the family.
I:9930;763;A new life for every member of the family trying to find his new place in the world, a world without a son and a brother.
I:9930;764;The mother, played by Samantha Morton is candid and touching in every scene.
I:9930;765;One of the strongest scenes is the fight scene between wife and husband.
I:9930;766;Yes she answers confidently (with all her body) and with an inner logic you are able to understand after watching and learning her character throughout the movie.
I:9930;767;What she means is that having another child and trying to hang on to life is what's going to keep this family together.
I:9930;768;his strong face is powerful even in sickness and so are the words he speaks in an African accent.
I:9930;769;There is something very majestic in all his moves, especially in his final action.
I:9930;770;is sweet and lovely but I feel that the elder sister (Sarah Bolger) is the one giving the movie its added value.
I:9930;771;She is powerful even in her silence and the things she is able to say.
I:9930;772;In America is her story and is brought to us in her words.
I:9930;773;I loved everything about this film.
I:9930;774;The script is heartbreaking and told in a way that tears you apart.
I:9930;775;The music is quite surprising as some of it is unfamiliar and the rest can seem totally out of place at times.
I:9930;776;A very happy tune is heard in the scene starting with a blooming yellow flower.
I:9930;777;Great pain and worry are on the screen.
I:9930;778;The contrast between the music you hear and what happens on screen is totally striking but is able nevertheless to add to the harmony of this movie as all senses are part of the experience and the sound of the music only sharpens what you see (happy?
I:9930;779;"autobiographical film about Jim Sheridan, acclaimed director whose works are deeply rooted in Ireland (see gripping film ""In the Name of the Father"")."
I:9930;780;But this time he sets his story in New York, telling about a family who just arrived there to start over their life, because of one unforgettable memory in the past.
I:9930;781;But what is really wonderful is the two daughters played by the real life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger.
I:9930;782;one of the tenant, is one of the touching moment.
I:9930;783;"Though the film features realiable actors like Samantha Morton (""Sweet and Lowdown"") or Paddy Considine (""Last Resort""), the film's greatest virtue lies in the incredibly delightful Bolger sisters."
I:9930;784;They are so cute and natural that even Morton cannot steal the show from them, and you know the fact from the very first scene, where one of the sisters unwittingly says an embarrassing thing which she should never say, at the immigration checkpoint.
I:9930;785;the camera (by Declan Quinn, actor Aidan's brother) is nicely captures the hot and cold air of New York (but the interior shots are all taken in the soundstage in Dublin!)
I:9930;786;"Though sometimes the film shows a lull (especially when the little sisters are not on the screen), and some part of the story are left unexplained, ""In America"" is a strong drama about the people coming to America with dream."
I:9930;787;in this film, though, it changes into magic realism, thanks to the two Bolgers.
I:9930;788;the moments where the family successfully connects or communicates with each other, or with their neighbors, particularly the black artist evoke feelings of joy.
I:9930;789;in the final summing up, it is a movie that touches you, makes you think, and sticks in your mind.
I:9930;790;the moments where the family successfully connects or communicates with each other, or with their neighbors, particularly the black artist evoke feelings of joy.
I:9930;791;in the final summing up, it is a movie that touches you, makes you think, and sticks in your mind.
I:9930;792;The apartment becomes a bohemian beauty and is filled with love between the Sullivans's despite the dire circumstances they face.
I:9930;793;The family struggles with finding jobs, maintaining pride and adapting to the openness of life in America.
I:9930;794;The two young girls who play the Sullivan daughters are absolutely adorable and seem to run through life filled with innocence and hope, something adults sorely lack most of the time.
I:9930;795;Their greatest friend comes in the form of an ailing artist, (played brilliantly by Djimon Hounsou), who looms over them with what soon becomes a lifelong affection.
I:9930;796;The intricacies of the relationships in this film are what make it extraordinary.
I:9930;797;All of the actors are perfectly casted and deserve attention for what they have accomplished, no one is over the top yet they have all earned stardom for their down.
I:9930;798;if you are looking for a movie that is effortless but well.
I:9930;799;written with characters of great depth and meaning this film is for you.
I:9930;800;Many scenes are touching and will make you consider your own existence in America, possibly appreciating it a little more.
I:9930;801;I was expecting this movie to be pretty depressing in the vein of 'Alices Ashes' but it turned out to be kind of magical and heartwarming.
I:9930;802;A lively and artistic but poor family moves to American and struggles to survive and find a fulfilling life.
I:9930;803;I bought this to share with friends because I like it so much.
I:9930;804;the acting is brilliant (the little girls are unbelievable), the photography makes viewers feel like they are sweating with the suffering residents of New York, and the writing is moving.
I:9930;805;An account of a young couple and their children's hardships and struggles as they arrive from Ireland and face new challenges.
I:9930;806;Just when I thought Angela's Ashes was a tearjerker family film a few years ago, I was touched a great deal more when I saw In America last year.
I:9930;807;It's a very heartfelt movie about the struggles and hardship of immigration, redemption, and letting go of the death of an infant.
I:9930;808;This is no doubt Samantha Morton's best performance since Sweet and Lowdown.
I:9930;809;She trully captures the essence of the character's pain and grief.
I:9930;810;It was compelling to see her confront her husband for causing the death of their baby.
I:9930;811;Both little girls are wonderful to watch, especially when they were making friends with their eccentric neighbor(Djimon Housou).
I:9930;812;I must say Djimon Housou was my choice to win the Oscar for best supporting actor, because his performance is so intense and powerful.
