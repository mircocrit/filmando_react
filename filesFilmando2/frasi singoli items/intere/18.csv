1;I liked that the suspense built slowly and the characters were developed.
2;If you want to conquer shyness, watching his unsmiled face and listening to every word he breathes will make you a fine psychotic killer.
3;I think that's a pretty good extra.
4;*Best Song, 1982 Was The Best 20th Century Fox From The Greateful Dead.
5;They find a cocoon inside the body, a rare species that will leave a paper trail.
6;Clarisse makes Hannibal an offer to get his help.
7;Next the story shows Hannibal cleverly escaping from his cage.
8;She talks to a suspicious person.
9;This action keeps your attention!This horror film has a slight redeeming value.
10;it implies there will be a sequel.
11;This is THE classic horror film.
12;Everything about this movie is perfect.
13;The plot is great, the actors are great.
14;I think this is the best movie of all the Hannibal Lecter saga.
15;The contrast in personality between Clarice and Hannibal is what it make this thriller so great, Hannibal is pure evil and Clarice is a young soon to graduate from FBI.
16;The Silence of the Lambs is still a top.
17;The acting is superb, Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are dynamite together even though the don't have a lot of scenes together.
18;hearted, definitely one to watch!
19;It is one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen!
20;Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are gifted actors.
21;There is something about it that keeps you compelled every time you watch it.
22;This has great acting and a at the edge of your seat story line, have watched over many times and it never gets old.
23;This one really makes history.
24;A great cast, great directing and a terrific score makes this one of the greatest creations hollywood ever made.
25;Hopkins held me in a trance with his big, penetrating eyes.
26;Foster delivered the best performance of her career.
27;the intensity and visual style of the whole thing made it unforgettable.
28;The psychological thriller to end all psychological thrillers and subtly frightening enough to gain itself the position of the scariest movie ever made.
29;The movie is for lack of a better word, perfect.
30;The performances and the chemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are perfect.
31;And the especial fetures are great also.
32;The deleted scenes, although the have awful image, they are still great.
33;The phone message of Hannibal, I mean Anthony Hopkins is hilarious, but the best is the new documentary, I have seen it many times and every time I find it interesting.
34;The Silence of The Lambs is most definitely my favorite movie ever.
35;Hannibal Lecter is my favorite character ever, and my sister and I enjoy quoting this movie all the time!
36;This is one of those rare cases where the movie is actually better than the book.
37;It is done put together perfectly, and the dialogue between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling is just great Hopkins makes a great Dr. Lecter and if you haven't seen this movie, and you enjoy movies like Se7en, The Usual Suspects, or any Hitchcock movies, you will probably like this one.
38;A superb performance by a superb actress.
39;anthony Hopkins' performance of Dr. Lecter is absolutely chilling.
40;Dr. Lecter is the most frightening character I've ever seen!
41;this is a very fine film, but not for the faint of heart.
42;But if you're into chilling, gripping thrillers, go see Silence of The Lambs.
43;Great actors, director, performances, and screenplay!
44;The disc was in great condition, looked as if it has never been used.
45;Anthony Hopkins in this movie along with Jodie Foster really do an awesome job playing their rolls.
46;I feel it really adds to the movie.
47;if you just want to watch the movie, the MGM edition is best.
48;It has the 5.1 sound, and the picture is much nicer.
49;I found this to be very interesting and it really let you understand the film better.
50;mGM has a solid documentary about the movie, but Criterion has those direct quotes from actual serial killers.
51;The choice is a tough one to make.
52;i didn't think that this could be done, But the Criterion version of SOTL makes a perfect film EVEN better!The commentary by Demme, Foster, Hopkins, Tally, and Douglas is excellent and very interesting.
53;Deleted scenes are always welcome in my book, and the FBI files and statements from actual serial killers are not something you see everyday.
54;My all time favorite movie, arrived in excellent time.
55;Product is exactly what I wanted.
56;Great movie, and Hannibal Lecter is the man.
57;Would recommend, without a doubt.
58;It is a perfect example of mastery and expressiveness in a commercial film.
59;Writing, performance, cinematography, direction, all seem to have this effortless blend of freedom and perfect control, expressiveness and reverence for craft.
60;up on Jodie Foster's face, so patient and receptive to our attention, gives this film is spine and it's haunting afterlife.
61;Jodie Foster has been a favorite of mine for several years and Anthony Hopkins is just mind blowing in this movie.
62;i would recommend it to those who like mind games.
63;great movie to add to any collection.
64;a must see for any thriller lover.
65;the movie takes you inside it, anthony hopkins is a great actor and the roll he played is the best in the movie it is like he has been really crasy through his real life and at that moment he didn't act he just was there being himI love that movie, the other two are good but this one.
66;the movie was kinda cloudy in spots but I still get the gist of it is still a great movie you need to improve the reception.
67;I would still recommend this way of getting movies because it is easy and quick.
68;This was a terrific movie.
69;The last 30 minutes of the movie was about the most suspenseful of any movie I have ever seen and still remains that way.
70;Loved this movie, looked at the deleted scenes that the Criterion selection offers over the regular version, and I don't know if it is worth the extra cost.
71;otherwise a superlative product, which I recommend highly to anybody.
72;"Seeing as this film is based upon a novel, I must say it is excellently well done, it has an Oscar for ""Best Picture""."
73;It's funny how you picture characters as you read a novel, and quite honestly, Anthony Hopkins couldn't be more perfect to play the infamous .
74;Give 'Silence of the Lambs' a viewing.
75;Classic Thriller love to watch this movie always great It rubs the lotion on the skin need I say more!!
76;Anthony Hopkins at his best so is Judy Foster.
77;No wonder it has won five academy awards.
78;And as I expected she gave an excellent Oscar winning performance, as did Anthony Hopkins.
79;The role of FBI trainee Clarice Starling was a perfect follow up to her previous Oscar winning film The Accused .
80;This leads to Clarice following up the hints with events coming to a dramatic conclusion.
81;besides the main story line there is strong chemistry between Lecter and Starling from the moment they meet.
82;This twisted love story seems to mix well with the heart.
83;The Silence Of The Lambs is a must see movie for anyone who likes thrillers.
84;Now at 13, I understand it more but love it just the same!
85;And the amount of Oscars it won in 1991 proves that it is one of the best films of all time.
86;I watch it every few months.
87;I will remain timeless, great acting and directing and also fantastic acting
88;It is absolutely one of the best Movies of all times!
89;Just for the fine acting of the whole cast.
90;is a superstar ever since.
91;Sorry Criterion, but keep on the good work!
92;`The Silence of the Lambs' is one of the most widely known and lauded films in recent years.
93;`The Silence of the Lambs' is, though, a classic.
94;This movie is about Clarice and Hannibal, about their growing trust and their deep.
95;He sees a way that he can help her help herself and so he attacks her self esteem and her confidence, not in a malicious manner but in an attempt to better her.
96;worthy in my humble opinion.
97;The ticks that he associated to Lecter are just mesmerizing, the way he sucks in his words when he speaks to emphasize the corruption surrounding his superior intellect is astounding in every way.
98;jonathan Demme brilliantly created a film that gets under your skin and stays in your head.
99;It's gritty and raw and takes your breath away scene after scene.
100;As a horror film goes it succeeds in sending shivers down the spine.
101;As a psychological thriller is succeeds in molesting the demons in your head and as a drama is succeeds in creating an atmosphere of the purest form and delivering satisfaction all around the table.
102;Every one knows 'Silence of the Lambs' is a classic.
103;Ah, the gift that keeps on creeping.
104;it's about as good as book adaptations get .
105;this version has a few extras not on the other, so if you like your Lambs with an extra side of contrast, see if you can score the Criterion edition and enjoy it with some fava beans and a nice chianti!
106;Deserves all the praise it gets for sure!
107;Great suspense as the search goes on for a devious serial killer intent on finding women meeting his special criteria.
108;All of this pales, however, to the performance of Anthony Hopkins as the now legendary Hannibal Lecter, the most devious and clever serial murderer in cinematic history.
109;The Silence of the Lambs is an excellent psychological thriller, which follows Thomas Harris' novel almost word for word.
110;Anthony Hopkins, in the roll of the sociopathic killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter, creates an aura of suspense throughout the entire film, even though he only appears in a small number of scenes.
111;Jodie Foster's portrayal of Clarice Starling, is very believable, and follows the the character description provided by the novel very well.
112;Through outstanding acting, a fabulous screenplay, and excellent cinematography, this film is definitely worth the 5 academy awards its name has earned.
113;Still love to be scared to death.
114;I watch this movie occasionally because Anthony Hopkins is the very best scary guy.
115;I've liked this since it was in the theaters.
116;That prisoner is Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a cannibal who is also a brilliant pyschologist who knows everything about the criminal mind.
117;This leads to a startling climax that will stay with you forever.
118;The Silence Of The Lambs truly deserves the praise that is heaped upon it.
119;Jodie Foster is brilliant as Clarice.
120;She portrays this tough, courageous and fearful women like no one else can and she truly deserved the Best Actres Oscar.
121;As Lecter, Hopkins creates one of the single greatest performances in film history.
122;You are drawn into the mind of this man.
123;One could never imagine that a man who eats people could be so likeable.
124;the extra features I haven't watched yet, but they look great.
125;Still, you should definitely watch the film first.
126;It's worth it, trust me.
127;This movie is one of the best I've ever scene.
128;It has a great script, cast, story, and title.
129;It also has one of the best endings a movie could have.
130;However there is one side effect, you'll go away wearing that demonic grin that can only escape after you've watched a truly creepy and wonderful movie.
131;A fantastic movie, don't miss any of the three.
132;Hi All, I received this movie the same way the description was written.
133;good price, the movie is in perfect conditions like new.
134;One of my all time favorites.
135;I have seen this movie many times and enjoy it more each time.
136;service in getting it was excellent.
137;This is quite possible not only a great thriller, but one of the best movies ever made.
138;noth, not a single flaw in that department, the cinematography blends perfectly with the storyline, and its very smartly written where everything is tied up perfectly and makes sense.
139;This is as close as you can get to a perfect thriller.
140;One of the five movies that captured the five major academy awards (Best Movie, Actor, Actress, Director and Screenplay), the other two were 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' and 'It Happened One Night'.
141;When u watch this movie you know that it deserved them all.
142;Just watched this movie recently getting ready for Hannibal which i hope is just as good.
143;Finally I have it and its great.
144;one of the best psychological thrillers of all time.
145;''The Silence of the Lambs'' is a brilliant movie,because it succeeds in making us terrified of what Buffalo Bill or Hannibal Lector would do next.
146;'The Silence of the Lambs' went to the oscars to win Best Picture,Actor,Actress,Screenplay and Director.
147;i hope that you find this helpful!
148;The movie was complete and it worked very well.
149;I look forward to seeing more films on Prime.
150;This is one of my favorite movies and I have all the rest in the series about Hannibol.
151;I do like this one best out of them all.
152;An excellent movie excellently preserved.
153;Video worked perfectly not scratched and a great movie.
154;It will scare the pants off of you but it's worth the watch.
155;Great acting from all cast members.
156;When I first saw this movie in 1991, I realized that I had just witnessed a fine piece of film that will no doubt go down as one of the finest thrillers ever made.
157;When the movie went on to win all of the major Oscar awards, it was nice to see that the industry thought so too.
158;After the pleasant, but non.
159;distinguishable Manhunter 5 years previous, the unsuspecting audience finally got to see Hannibal The Cannibal Lecter in a way he was meant to be seen.
160;She is brought in on a case involving a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill.
161;Although Brian Cox did an admirable job as Lecter in Manhunter , Anthony Hopkins really brings the character to life.
162;The cold stare and the diabolical grin and winking.
163;Hopkins does it with ease and grace, and never goes overboard.
164;We all know she is a phenomenal actress, and she proves it again with this performance.
165;The direction is top notch.
166;The writing is intelligent and clever, and is way above most other thriller screenwriters' heads.
167;The movie is a real thriller.
168;It is what a thriller should be.
169;Plus, you don't usually get classic, memorable characters like this in most films.
170;It's a movie for people who love movies.
171;We can only hope that the new Red Dragon carries on the torch from Silence .
172;Silence Of The Lambs is an excellent film.
173;Fueled by powerful stars and Demme's direction.
174;She is recruited to help out with a major case.
175;The film has a great plot and is an excellent film.
176;Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, especially are in top form.
177;All the oscars this won, it deserved.
178;This of course is the song that plays when Buffalo Bill dances with himself in front of the camera.
179;A great song that sets the mood for that terrific scene.
180;Intricate, clever, suspenseful with terrific performances.
181;It's one of my favorites of the genre .
182;Both Hopkins and Foster are in top form and it's easy to see why they received Oscars.
183;Great price for a great movie.
184;winning director Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Ted Tally(they won the gongs for this movie and deservedly so) achieved what, in Hollywood, is pretty much the impossible.
185;They took an excellent book, turned this excellent book into a fantastic film, and, along with Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, has spent the last decade knowing that this remarkable film is now a classic.
186;the story begins stylishly and gracefully, introducing viewers to FBI agent.
187;"Ambitious and intelligent, FBI Special Agent Jack Crawford, who is head of the Behavioural Sciences Profiling Unit, requests that she conduct an interview with eminent psychiatrist and convict serial killer Dr ""Hannibal The Cannibal"" Lecter."
188;at least our logic dictates this to us .
189;tingling suspense, and the electrifying, terrifying chemistry between the two leads will keep you on the edge of your seat (or as in my case when I saw this movie at the cinema, BEHIND your seat).
190;"ama ""Psycho"", ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" is the best suspense/thriller movie ever made."
191;It features a clever blend of modern fears and ancient curses, along with two superb, deservedly Oscar.
192;winning performances of a lifetime (and in the history of motion pictures, in my opinion) by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.
193;This is, arguably, the best commentary track ever placed aside a grand film.
194;And Hopkins speaks of how he makes Lecter both endearing and creepy.
195;the movie itself looks great, still causes a chill and a thrill.
196;Great film, no matter how many times we watch it!
197;An American classic for sure.
198;I understand why this film received multiple Academy Awards.
199;The cast is excellent, the storyline is well done, and can be viewed for years as a well.
200;The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best movie in the last ten years because of its ability to insert a female hero in the center of the story.
201;This movie is also an acting and directing masterpiece.
202;As far as the acting is concerned, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both give performances that will be two of the most memorable in film ever.
203;If you enjoy scary movies and psychological thrillers, this is an undeniable classic.
204;I am no movie critic but when a movie sticks in my psyche years after I see it, I conclude that it has content and a level of artistry that make it a classic.
205;I enjoy choosing my favorites and receiving them promptly so that I can enjoy watching them again and again!
206;The Silence of the Lambs works very effectively as a pshycological thriller that toys with your mind.
207;The leads all give outstanding and realistic performances in an interesting way, so its no wonder why Hopkins and Foster took home Best Actor and Best Actress respectively at the 1992 Oscars.
208;Both of the killers in this film give very gritty yet frightenly realistic performances as the film's villians.
209;this film really does play with your mind, enough so to scare you even.
210;Its not exactly a pleasant movie, dealing with the laws of cannibalism and psychology, but its believeable enough to make you say 'wow!'
211;Great performance by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins Suspenseful.
212;On the edge of your chair the whole time.
213;Ms. Foster is a true artist, and probably my favorite actress.
214;In LAMBS she surpasses all of her previous efforts by light years!
215;The interplay between Hannibal and Clarice is the dark, fleshy heart of this story.
216;Both receive something they need from the other.
217;There is a mutual admiration and respect that teaters on the brink of .
218;He makes both characters sympathetic and alive.
219;I cheered for one monster, while longing for the extermination of another!
220;Watch it and see what I mean .
221;There are security doors and guards and cameras everywhere, watching every move of anyone who goes in or out.
222;Then Clarice is instructed that Dr. Lector's cell is the last one down and to keep to the right.
223;She follows instructions, and we see things from her point of view as this man comes into view, standing perfectly still, not really at attention, not really waiting, but more like.
224;Hannibal Lector's eyes are so dead and yet so piercing, full of calculating energy, that he immediately lends tension to a film that mostly doesn't even involve him.
225;Their conversations, especially when the tension builds and Clarice finally spills about her past, are the true heart of the movie, and for a movie that contains not one but two psychopaths like Buffalo Bill and Hannibal Lector, to find a heart amongst it all is an achievement all on its own.
226;His performance chills you to the bone yet you can't help but laugh at some of the things he says.
227;The movie is also fantastic.
228;Instead of just being a straight forward serial killer thriller the movie became a classic with it's intense psychological aspect between the detectice Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster, and Dr. Lecter.
229;With a story this strong flashy camera effects would've only distracted.
230;With solid directing, great acting, and a good story this film is worthy of being called a modern classic.
231;The Commentary is great although the person who introduces the actors everytime they speak is a bit annoying.
232;There are also some interesting deleted scenes and the quotes from serial killers will chill you to the bone.
233;A very smart an epic film by Jonathon Demme That will not fail to dissapoint.
234;This is a very entertaining movie.
235;It keeps you interested all the way.
236;"There is certainly fascination and suspense
I:8404;237;But I have to agree with those critics who found a lot to complain about.
I:8404;238;Jodie was good, Hopkins was good.
I:8404;239;Strange kind of patchwork"
240;The movie is long and very interesting because Clarice has to get information out of a psychopath to help her catch a man name buffalo bill who is skining girls for a reason ,but you'll have to fine out yourself why he does that.
241;the special Edition comes with lots stuff ,but watching the movie is enough if you ask me.
242;silence of the Lambs is a very good movie, though not as good as some people have said.
243;He's exceedingly intelligent, and he flaunts it.
244;He's also very good at playing mind games that make the movie far more interesting to watch.
245;the Silence Of The Lambs is by far better than its sequal, Hannibal, and is a good movie that most will enjoy.
246;Great acting, good plot, some blood, a cannible, what more could you ask for!
247;It is also pretty funny as well, like a line at the end of the movie I'm having an old friend for dinner.
248;It is a great movie, but if your looking for a scary movie look some were else.
249;If you just want a very well made film, see this one.
250;The Silence of The Lambs is one of the most enjoyable and sophisticated films out there.
251;"The only film I can think of that combines brains with plain fun as successfully as this is ""Memento""."
252;The plot of this movie is absolutely fantastic and the actors deserve all the praise they have been given.
253;Anthony Hopkins provides the better performance though and really creates the best villain of all time.
254;The scenes he and Foster share are absolutely riveting.
255;I could actually start to feel my heart beating faster at certain points in the film.
256;I won't spoil it for anyone but I'll say that I thought a very realistic film took an unexpected turn which didn't feel quite right.
257;Even with that flaw this really is one of the best films of all time and is must see.
258;That's all for now I have to go.
259;There were so many good aspects of this movie which made it great.
260;This and the movies that followed, and the ultra creepy tv series Hannibal are all haunting yet compelling works.
261;This is such a great old show, i looked all over and couldn't find it in the stores, thank you so much
262;Is it even better than the book and I loved the book.
263;This movie is the best movie of its kind.
264;Anthony Hopkins played the best and most complex killer in any suspense movie ever.
265;Jodie Foster is actually great in the movie and the plot is second to none.
266;If you love a good suspense movie then this movie is for you.
267;It will scare you silent for a while to come.
268;She is to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
269;Jodie Foster is excellent in the part.
270;Anthony Hopkins is superb in the role.
271;He brings to the screen everything evil, and uses his words and looks to scare all those caught in his gaze silent.
272;With great performances from Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster, Ted Levine, and Diane Baker this film is sure to be hailed for many years to come.
273;It is a fantastic suspense film.
274;The Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest movies ever made.
275;Jodie Foster, equally as brilliant as Hopkins, plays Clarice Starling, a student at the FBI academy in Washington.
276;When I saw a special edition of my favorite movie The Silence of the Lambs , I knew I had to have it.
277;Jodie Foster Anthony Hopkins are just brilliant in their roles of Clarice Starling Dr. Hannibal Lecter, respectfully.
278;The extras are great as well, and the last scene STILL chills me, even though I have seen this movie hundreds of times.
279;I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good scare.
280;We have always loved this movie.
281;Spending the extra $7.00 on this version of the disk is so well worth it that I could probably fill half of a page blathering on and on about it.
282;I'm thinking more along the lines of Best Supporting Actor.
283;The original release was rubbish and the sound and picture on this new Special Edition are absolutely stunning.
284;This review will discuss the merits of the now rare and out of print Criterion Collection version of the film.
285;It is well recognized that the acting by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins as the two leads is amazing.
286;the biggest feature of the Criterion Edition is a commentary track featuring director Jonathan Demme, actors Foster and Hopkins, screenwriter Talley and FBI agent John Douglas.
287;The track is informative and is a good listen.
288;Most of these scenes are unnecessary but two reveal a dropped plotline that is rather interesting.
289;two rather interesting features are pure textual.
290;All in all these features compose a great deal of material on the criminal mind and should not be skipped.
291;the Criterion Disc is well suited to fans of the film or to those with an interest in the subject matter.
292;It is also well worth seeking out for the Criterion completist.
293;Clarice meets with Lecter to find he is an evil raving genius who is always a step ahead of the game and always prying into the mind of anyone he meets.
294;Clarice is given a lead about Buffalo Bill by Lecter and he offers more information if he can be moved to a cell with a view.
295;What John Demme has given us with The Silence of the Lambs is far greater then another story of a serial killer on the prowl.
296;He has instead created a wonderfully black comic, satire of America's fascination with the serial killer.
297;This makes the film great, along with the top notch, Academy Award winning performances by Foster and Hopkins.
298;The artful cinematography is a plus too.
299;The first worth mentioning is the word for word quotes of real serial killers.
300;It is a large catalog of quotes of serial killers on specific subjects like their childhood and sex.
301;Another extra feature is the deleted scenes.
302;These are interesting, but nothing extraordinary, for example one deleted scene is a longer version of the Yourself Storage facility sequence.
303;Yet another extra feature is the scene.
304;The next extra feature is the entire storyboard of the film.
305;This is a nice feature if you enjoy storyboards and have about an hour to sit down and view the entire thing.
306;It is very interesting, each person has something very interesting to say, especially Anthony Hopkins and John Douglas.
307;Even though the price is a bit steep, it is worth the money.
308;I never thought he'd get any better than he was as Norman Bates in Psycho, but Hopkins is even better as Hannibal Lecter.
309;jodie Foster is great in this, too.
310;I've liked her ever since she starred in Annie.
311;"Great classic film
I:8404;312;This film was just as good as the book.
I:8404;313;I think the success of the film though is indicative of the fascination Americans have with serial killers.
I:8404;314;Anthony Hopkins is great in this film.
I:8404;315;Hannibal, Red Dragon, and Hannibal Rising are all fantastic, but Silence of the Lambs takes the cake
I:8404;316;between 1991 and today, I've seen and read quite a few true crime movies and books, and that really helps as well.
I:8404;317;one interesting thing that I hadn't thought about before while watching: the Jodie Foster character is being """"groomed"""" for her position by both her boss and Hannibal Lecter."""
318;There are scenes where both men hold Ms. Foster's hand and there are closeups I believe on each.
319;while I love this film .
320;Now, the killer in this film is definitely odd, and I think that he could be spotted from a mile away.
321;A big recommendation by me, of course.
322;You see I understand that making movies is far from easy.
323;bottom line is this is one of the best movies based on one of Thomas Harris's books.
324;"Personally I love the movie ""Manhunter"" as well and I 'm not sure why Thomas Harris wouldn't let them use the ""Red Dragon"" title back in 1986."
325;I think William Petersen was great in Manhunter.
326;jodie Fosters performance is remarkable.
327;She makes me believe in her part.
328;She makes me believe she came from West Virginia.
329;She makes me beleive she is vulnerable but strong.

I:8404;392;~Silence of the Lambs~ has to be one of the great films of the twentieth century.
I:8404;393;I believe it out ranks its sequel and the prequel, (though these films are also well done) because everything from the screenplay to the soundtrack is first rate.

I:8404;411;this movie is not for the squeamish and there is some extreme crudeness in the story but I suspect everyone knows that by now.
I:8404;412;What I've always liked best was the by.
I:8404;413;The looks on Hopkins' face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.
I:8404;414;Silence Of The Lambs has turned into a modern.

I:8404;430;The """"psychological thriller"""" has always been my favorite genre of film making."""

559;This became one of my favorite movies ever, due to Jodie Foster's performance and the fact her character is a real hero rather than a victim.

561;This is also one of the most frightening movies I've ever seen.
562;Silence has a number of genuine surprises and twists that are guaranteed to make you gasp out loud and sit on the edge of your seat.
563;All the deleted scenes, documentary, and other extras were a treat for fans of this film.

570;The film has many layers of story being told, and its kind of three dimensional.
571;The first is Buffalo Bill, who everyone is attempting to capture.
572;He's kind of the villain on the surface of the film, but the real person to admire is Hannibal Lecter.
573;He is behind bars in the start of the film, but he is a very deep and complex person, and unlike any villain you've seen before.

581;"I found Hopkins' performance tolerable
I:8404;582;Overall, the film was entertaining.
I:8404;583;I thought that was the best thing about this film, actually.
I:8404;584;This is Anthony Hopkins as his scary best.
I:8404;585;Anthony Hopkins and the young Jodie Foster are a great mix.
I:8404;586;Not scary but a great thriller.
I:8404;587;In addition to being mad as a hatter, Lecter is a brilliant psychologist"
588;This sturdy little figure, striding along, with this determined look on her face.
589;And I just thought, 'That's her.
590;Demme felt casting an actor of Duvall's familiarity would have worked against the role, that audiences would always see Robert Duvall up there on.
591;"Hopkins said, ""But Treves is a very good man,"" to which Demme replied, ""Well, that's what I want for Lecter."
592;That's he's a compassionate man, he's a humanitarian, he's a good man locked inside this insane mind.
593;Certainly we must give credit to the great script, the great direction, to Ted Levine's eerie portrayal of Buffalo Bill.
594;As Lecter gets to know Clarice, he obviously finds her stimulating and attractive.
595;The most fascinating scenes, really the heart of the movie, are those where these two great actors simply talk to each other.
596;Part of the reason Lecter needles Clarice, I think, is to see if she can take it.
597;She listens, perseveres, responds intelligently, maintains her dignity in the face of a psychological rape that would send a lesser personality fleeing or screaming, and eventually gets everything she wants out of Lecter.
598;Clarice struggles to understand what it's like to be a monster.
599;But Clarice Starling IS vulnerable, and decent, and caring.
600;We travel along with this believable, admirable woman as she progresses on what is very much a traditional hero's journey.
601;We see her face her own fears, both physical and psychological, and overcome them.
602;"in 1991, Jody Foster won the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance as Clarice Starling
I:8404;603;It's a weird and amazingly successful hybrid: a police procedural, a psychological drama, a Gothic horror movie, a slasher film with no slashing.
I:8404;604;This is arguably the best thriller.
I:8404;605;The Silence of the Lambs is easily the best thriller made since Alfred Hitchcock.
I:8404;606;I think it is the best movie ever made.
I:8404;607;Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are brilliant as Hannibal Lector and the young FBI rookie sent to get information from him.

611;The Silence of the Lambs remains one of the all time greatest horror movies, that goes beyond anything that slasher horror flicks can do.
612;Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster work of each others talents when they are both onscreen to give the audience real frights, by just having a conversation!
613;That is true cinematic genius, which Jonathan Demme was able to capture.
614;The deleted scenes are great to watch, but for most you can tell, that it was for the best not to have them in the film.
615;Easily one of the most notable and recognizable suspense thrillers, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS delivers each and every time.
616;It's a total psychological, suspense thriller that will intrigue you and even creep you out a little.
617;This movie gets into your head a little and also into the mind of a serial killer.
618;Hopkins also puts on an outstanding performance as Hannibal Lechter.
619;He is simply amazing in this role.
620;Jody Foster is also very good in the role of Clarice Starling.
621;this is a hihgly recommended movie for all movie lovers, suspense thriller fams will definiarely get a kick out of this one.
622;A very interesting commentary is included with Hopkins, Foster and a couple other people.
623;The movie won academy award for Anthony Hopkins, wish his chilly performance.
624;Jodie Foster is great in the role of Clarice, probably the best in the reincarnations that took place in subsequent versions.
625;The Silence of the Lambs is a movie that in a couple of decades from now will stand as the groundbreaker in the dark thriller genre.
626;It's clear to see where Seven and The Usual Suspects got their inspiration from.
627;Sometimes Hollywood will release a truly frighting movie.
628;One of the finest examples of that is The Silence of the Lambs.

I:8404;646;This movie is intriguing, disturbing, and frightening.
I:8404;647;This film, and the story it tells continue to withstand the test of time.
I:8404;648;The Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 American thriller film that blends elements of the crime and horror genres.
I:8404;649;Prequel to Hannibal Rising and Red Dragon.
I:8404;650;Two more intense and talented actors there scarcely are in cinema today.
I:8404;651;anthony Hopkins as the diabolical and positively frightening Hannibal Lecter and Jodie Foster as the FBI agent Clarice Starling.
I:8404;652;Both are at their best, and this film would be worth seeing just to see the two of them in action.
I:8404;653;Americans love this sort of thing, so if you want to see gore, you may as well see it in the best of hands.
I:8404;654;This thriller proves to be a fully satisfying expierience.
I:8404;655;The actors are great, especially Anthony Hopkins as the chilling Dr. Lector, who may be the best murderer of this genre since pyscho.
I:8404;656;It is much better than your other run of the mill thrillers of the 90's.
I:8404;657;Because this film is top notch production.
I:8404;658;Silence of the Lambs is one of those rare films that will stay in your mind and in your head for at least a week or more.
I:8404;659;This is the scariest, most emotionally affecting film in the Hannibal Lecter trilogy.You all know the basics of this film.
I:8404;660;I don't know if the film would have been effective if Michelle Pfeiffer agreed to play Starling, but she just draws you so strongly to this masterpiece of a film.
I:8404;661;the key to the success of this film is we are given privy to the world of a woman.
I:8404;662;Thomas Harris is just brilliant.
I:8404;663;Excellent acting, plot, sequence and ending.
I:8404;664;This is one of those rare movies which keeps a logical sequence of events until the end.
I:8404;665;This was a gift for my man .
I:8404;666;a fan of this series.
I:8404;667;The title says it all, this is one of the best films ever made.
I:8404;668;Hannibal Lecter may be the most terrifying and memorable film character in movie history, Hopkins is all too believable in his characterization of a psychopath, and Foster is just outstanding.
I:8404;669;The great Jonathan Demme's best directorial job, he squeezes every bit of unease from the material onto the screen that's possible.
I:8404;670;brainer, MGM Home Entertainment has dove.
I:8404;671;tailed a new version of the Oscar.
I:8404;672;winning The Silence of the Lambs with the video debut of that suspense classic's controversial sequel, Hannibal.
I:8404;673;Watching Anthony Hopkins' work in Lambs after viewing Hannibal only adds to appreciation of his decade.
I:8404;674;Hopkins' original Lecter is a ghostly presence, lean and powerful, with cat.
I:8404;675;Tak Fujimoto's camera loves her, in shades of Hitchcock's female stars.
I:8404;676;I knew that he was the shadowy figure inside all of us.
I:8404;677;(I would recommend the widescreen version, BTW.)
I:8404;678;The only superb film in the series was the first good horror/thriller in decades.
I:8404;679;The streamlined script (relying on exposition by showing memory in action rather than the usual talking head, for example, Clarices memories of her father), the superior direction and inventive cinematography steeped the film in tragedy, doom and suspense.
I:8404;680;I already have the Criterion Edition with it's interesting commentary track and more key players than you can shake a script at.
I:8404;681;He formally was a brilliant psychiatrist and he turned into a cannibalistic killer.
I:8404;682;She closes in on the murderer and after some tense moments she finishes the job a hero.
I:8404;683;He bids her farewell as chilling as ever and this time he is a free man.
I:8404;684;The acting was good and there were definitely some great thrills.
I:8404;685;One of the scariest movies ever made, with Hannibal Lecter introduced and turning out to be the most fascinating character in cinema history.
I:8404;686;Silence of the Lambs, the first 'horror' film to win a Best Picture Oscar, is a number of things all at once: a suspense thriller, a look into the world of FBI profiling and procedure, and a story of a strong, intelligent woman trying to establish herself in a career dominated by men.
I:8404;687;director Jonathan Demme ( Something Wild, Married to the Mob ), working with a witty, intelligent screenplay by Ted Tally (based on the novel by Thomas Harris), crafts a film that is beautifully acted and produced.
I:8404;688;jodie Foster's self effacing performance as Clarice Starling is simply stunning, filled with strength, intelligence and pathos"
689;Howard Shore's stunning score avoids all the usual horror film cliches.
690;If you are a hannibal series fan it's a good copy, the price was right too.
691;It was certainly one of the finest films I had ever seen on the big screen.
692;ray or standard format 20th anniversary edition will be released in a couple of years time in a director's cut version so as to add some freshness and life to this great film.
693;An anamorphic widescreen version would also be greatly appreciated.
694;So while I was watching it I kept comparing it with the book.
695;I'll say this much: Silence of the Lambs is one of the best movies based on a book that I've ever seen.
696;This is thanks in part to the exceptionally strong performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.
697;Anthony Hopkins gives one of the most electrifying and mesmerizing performances I have ever seen in a movie.
698;Jodie Foster is just wonderful as Clarice Starling, she really captures Clarice's strength and vulnerbility.
699;You can really relate to the character and her feelings.
700;One thing that I liked a lot about this movie is that the conversations between Lecter and Clarice are mainly done in close ups, which gives these scenes an even greater intensity.
701;Hopkins and Foster are of course the two most memorable performances in this movie but the other actors are also very good.
702;Although this is an excellent film, I still like the book better than the movie.
703;This is an excellent movie but if you're one of the very few people out there who have never seen it before then I'd recommend that you should read the book first, because it's just fantastic.
704;I would recommend people to watch it.
705;It is a bit intense and is definitely an adult movie.
706;Definitely a classic that is a must see.
707;It's a great thriller and amazing to see again.
708;It streamed perfectly through my roku.
709;The Silence of the Lambs is the best thriller I've ever seen.
710;It rightfully earned every Oscar it won.
711;The story is fantastic and original, although it does include some objectional material.
712;He brings a whole life and mysterious awe to the character of Hannibal Lecter.
713;Jodie Foster is also to be commended for her superb acting job.
714;The music is good and very haunting.
715;Jonathan Demme's direction is pretty good.
716;The commentary track is pretty informative and the deleted scenes are ok.
717;I agree also that this film inspired the X. files, which I love by the way.
718;All in all a mother of a film.
719;The movie is right on just like I imagined it.
720;im sure I've seen this movie a few times, yet the beggining of Hannibal is always good to re.
721;Otherwise the movie is really good for its time.
722;The Silence of the Lambs is a brilliant work of art.
723;It is extremely suspenseful and superbly acted.
724;Jody Foster and Anthony Hopkins give performances of a lifetime and Buffalo Bill is chillingly believable as well.
725;This is a great horror movie.
726;Anthony Hopkins and Jody Foster were fantastic.
727;If you are a person who enjoys a thriller this is a must own.
728;After all this time, Silence of the Lambs is still one of the best movies ever.
729;It is one of the few movies that translated perfectly from Harris's original novel.
730;Hopkins won the award for his fascinating performance.
731;She manages to convey a vulnerability and strength that are a match for the predatory Dr Lector (aka Lecter).
732;Their relationship is one of allure based on intellect.
733;The intellectual marriage is somehow more profoundly sexual in its intimacy,mating of two superior brains and power of revelation (on Jodie's part) that both contrasts and fuses with the impenetrable mystery of this interesting/good professor and mentor/party animal/wild killer/savage obscentiy named Hannibal,which we can never ever hope to understand, and never want to,really.
734;And we (also empathic with Foster) confront and deal with it.
735;great Jodie Foster fan here.
736;A real actress worth five stars alone.
737;Just two observations I feel compelled to make:1.
738;Hannibal is so dangerous and inventive that people are cautioned to not even let a paper clip be provided to him.
739;that said, this is a film deserving of its ratings and appreciation, and should not be missed.
740;Great film with classic characters.
741;The interaction between Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins) and Clarise (Jodie Foster) is electric and eerie.
742;Two of best performances you'll ever see.
743;The entire cast puts on nice performances.
744;Nice tranfer and definitely worth the money.
745;This is a mesmerizing tale of the most heinous of nightmares come true as FBI agent Clarice (Jodie Foster) is immersed into an abyss of the darkest side of deviant human behavior where the flesh eating Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) agrees to assist her in her investigation to capture a serial killer who commits unspeakable atrocities on his victims.
746;I am not a big horror fan but this is one worth having and watching.
747;I got this movie for my wife, and a digital copy came with it.
748;I like this movie It's cool.
749;The film is one of the best in its class.
750;the film and the whole story are so well defined, and it leads us to an imagination that we are almost part of the FBI investigation and it leads the audiences to try to track the killer(s) down with Hannibal Lecter, the wonderful physcho criminal in this film.
751;as a whole, I personally feel this film should be the best thriller in 90s.
752;It definitely scores 5 stars.
753;i just want to share this original but not forgeting its 2nd series, 'Hannibal' which is also a classic in this catagory because the story is so well.
754;organised and reasonable which lead the audiences to another frigthening situation and reflect Dr Lecter's true face.
755;The film is well written and planned, the audiences do not know what will happen next with the unexpected act of Dr H. lecter.
756;I love this movie and will always be in my top 5 list.
757;I had a great time watching this and the speical features i even made one of the recipes it has.
758;anthony, Jodie and Ted are terrific in this and I'm glad Igot this 2.
759;disc set that has nice picture and sound plusneat extras.
760;Definitely get this terrific thriller.
761;This movie has much to offer: good acting, much suspense, best picture of the year, styllistic similarities with Alfred Hitchcock films and a superior performance by Anthony Hopkins.
762;This film won Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Screenplay and Best Director among other well.
763;The movie is both creepy and exciting at the same time.
764;The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see.
765;The 16 year old really likes Hannibal so we told him it was required viewing to watch Silence of the Lambs.
766;The movie holds up really well.
767;I enjoy watching Jodie Foster as much as Anthony Hopkins.
768;One of the best thrillers of all time.
769;He is smart and intelligent.
770;I love to watch him.
771;"I consider ""Silence of the Lambs"" among the finest thrillers ever made."
772;It's also a rare example of a superb film adaptation of a superb book (by Thomas Harris).
773;Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster give Academy Award winning performances in what are arguably their best known roles: the notorious criminal and renowned psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, the FBI Agent.
774;The reason I give this film four stars is two.
775;"This film unfairly beat out ""Beauty And The Beast,"" a far better film in terms of content and entertainment."
776;Worth seeing for Hopkins' and Foster's performances.
777;Scott Glenn also does an excellent job.
778;SPOILER WARNING: Also, definitely worth viewing for Lecter's escape from a prison in Memphis.
779;All the Hannibal movies are wonderful, but nothing compares to the original.
780;The Silence of the Lambs is not only creepy, but it is a marvelous display of exceptional actors.
781;'The Silence of the Lambs' is definitely a movie worth seeing.
782;The entire movie is a realization of Thomas Harris' shocking novel.
783;ups bring you into the action allowing you to see what goes on in the eyes and minds of the characters.
784;I found no flaws in the picture, and the extra scenes were very interesting.
785;Hopkins performance is larger than life, but it works for the film.
786;Foster hasn't really created memorable characters, but she can give the appropriate amount of emotional response to make the scenes.
787;Plain good storytelling, a memorable character, and real suspense make for a satisfying movie.
788;Actor Anthony Hopkins and actress Jodie Foster made their best appearances in this film.
789;The Silence of the Lambs which recieved four stars from the critics also earned two spots in AFI's 100 heroes and villains special.
790;But then again, few movies are able to live up to their predecessors.
791;every piece of the film is great.
792;"overall, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a great film and features many talented actors in their best roles of a lifetime."
793;This film based on Thomas Harris's masterpiece of a novel, is equally a masterpiece.
794;Hopkins and Foster deliver Oscar winning performances and the adapted screenplay from the novel is great, leaving in all of the best moments.
795;"the movie contains the best scene of all time, that beeing Hannibal's escape
I:8404;796;This thriller is heart pounding and smart and fast, and is recommended to everyone.
I:8404;797;It is my favorite movie of all time, and I recommend reading the book also as it gives away more interesting information.
I:8404;798;This is a great movie!
I:8404;799;I remember seeing it when I was younger and it messed me up.
I:8404;800;Seeing it as an adult, I was able to better appreciate it for the great film it is.
I:8404;801;If you've never seen it, catch it.
I:8404;802;If you've already seen it, watch it again.
I:8404;803;Dr. Lecter is a fabulous psychiatrist.
I:8404;804;The interviews with Dr. Lecter are indeed the highest peak in the movie.
I:8404;805;lecter opens his soul before his female image .
I:8404;806;There's a rapture and reciprocal admiration among them.
I:8404;807;sterling keeps for him a blended mix of suggested love.
I:8404;808;That sequence for me it's the highest dramatic point in the film.
I:8404;809;I mean this film is a fight minds , an archetypical conflict , a chess game between two brilliant minds, egos and personalities.
I:8404;810;That's why the film wins, because the dramatic locus turns around this duel.
I:8404;811;foster and Hopkins are in the top and in many ways reminds us to the couple Fletcher.
I:8404;812;a must in your collection and a classic film.
I:8404;813;A must movie to have,great thriller and suspense loved this movie!
I:8404;814;Thanks for all your help and service, I will look forward to doing business with you again in the future
I:8404;815;Despite that, I thought it was a brilliant work of cinema!
I:8404;816;The actors, particularly Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, played their parts well, despite what anyone might say against Foster's accent.
I:8404;817;And Hannibal was full of hair.
I:8404;818;This one has realistic (albeit melancholy) situations, and isn't afraid to be a little bold in the topics covered.
I:8404;819;If you have the guts to sit through the R. rated situations (violence, nudity, and intense situations), this is definitely one you need to watch.
I:8404;820;Silence of the Lambs is, in my view, one of the great thrillers.
I:8404;821;Much of the violence is gruesome rather than scary, and adds to the general feel of the film.
I:8404;822;It was hyped to a great degree when released, and a lot of people expected a chase 'n' slash horror.
I:8404;823;the comparison to Psycho is purely valid and perhaps one of the most telling.
I:8404;824;If this film has done this, then can it be considered art?
I:8404;825;If not, then surely it should just be enjoyed as it is"
826;this movie was absolutely brilliant.
827;It is the quintessential movie in the thriller genre.
828;All of the parts were played superbly.
829;watching Silence of the Lambs last night I was struck by how powerful it is in spite of the many times I have seen it.
830;My heart races more during the final face to face between Lecter and Starling than any violent scene in any modern horror movie.
831;This is true suspense film making of the highest level.
832;Every performance is excellent and directorial decisions that would sound disastrous when talked about work so well that you never even think about them until you really examine the film objectively.
833;Even the simplest of scenes strike such emotional responses.
834;which happens to be one of the best I've ever read.
835;"Pulp entertainment of the highest order, ""The Silence of The Lambs"" is terrific filmmaking."
836;"Entertaining, suspenseful and more than a bit hokey (albeit in just the right places), ""Silence"" at its core is a ""B"" movie thriller given an ""A""."
837;Fine direction, a crackling plot, iconic characterizations, perfect casting and superlative performances all adds up to a five.
838;star film (out of five) that is worth owning for any self.
839;sharp look of film over a waxy.
840;"com and (depending on your tolerance for film grain) is therefore worth picking up

842;As I type this, it's still the overall best making.
843;enhanced) video and (5.1 Dolby Digital) audio, and a nice set of special features, including the same hour.
844;Good movie, a lot of suspense and a good cast of characters that execute their roles well.
845;It has all of the qualities that a great movie should have.
846;It was the third film in motion picture history to win the five top awards.
847;best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress.
848;This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.
849;It's very suspenseful and makes you pause and ponder.
850;A classic thriller that keeps you trying to stay ahead but with a key character that is smarter than the viewer.
851;The silence of the lambs is by far one of the best movies in movie history.
852;One of Jodie Foster's best preformance and also Anthony Hopkins, I couldn't take my eyes off the movie from start to finish.
853;It's like it gets better with each and everytime you watch the movie.
854;Jodie Foster is an amazing actress.
855;the story is excellent and the suspense has you sitting at the edge of your seat.
856;But when I came out I knew I just saw one of the classic Horror movies ever made.
857;With the best movie villain I had ever seen, Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal(the cannabal)Lecter.
858;Jodie Foster gives a great proformance as FBI agent in.
859;The relationship that builds between Lecter and Starling is at the heart of the movie.
860;I am a real mood and atmosphere person, that is one of the things I notice when I watch a movie.
861;Silence has the creepiest mood I have ever felt in a movie.
862;The movie deals with fears and it lets you use your imagination while watching.
863;With one of the world's best actors, Anthony Hopkins, he plays and outstanding part of a psychopathic psychiatrist, and he has never been better!
864;This film is #19 in the international internet movie database, classified as one of the greatest films in history.
865;I thought Jodie Foster did a great job playing Clarice Starling, and the film wouldn't be complete without one of the greatest actors of all time, Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.
866;I've always been a fan of action/horror films of this kind that involve solving cases and almost real.
867;"If you really love ""The Silence of the Lambs"", then this is the best edition you could find (though, nowadays it's also the only one you can find)."
868;up of the faded picture made the greens rich and the reds blood red.3.
869;That, and the package art is absolutely delicious.
870;"Speaking of which, just behind the inside cover booklet is a tasty treat that invokes both sick humor and helpful tips about ""cooking""Bottom line, if you've never seen this film before then I highly recommend it."
871;that is if you have a strong stomach.
872;It's a brilliant story about good and evil and how dark some people can really be.
873;If you already have all of the previous releases, check this one out too, it's worth the double.
874;Then on the next morning I bought it.
875;Silence of the Lambs was astonishing with the well laid out preformances and the intriguing story plot!
876;The story works its way up to interesting ties and ends.
877;With very little gory parts (not to say there aren't any) the movie is still very amazing.
878;With the exceptional acting done by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.
879;Joie Foster is amazing and Anthony Hopkins is downright frightening.
880;One of the best films.
881;Like Cassablaca it is that rare meeting of the right director with the right cast at the proper place in time.
882;It is a tribute to this film that all the sequels and prequels have done well inspite of a less then spectacular treatment of the authors writen word.
883;the feature on the making of the film that show the building of the feature and it's inpact durring it's initial release was very interesting.
884;It shows how unique a film it was and how it's very disturbing story caused such a stur even at Oscar time.
885;"there is a very interesting ""From Page to Screen"" piece that I always find enjoyable."
886;These featurettes are always literate and well constructed.
887;It takes the viewing experiance to the next level.
888;I have always loved this movie!!
889;Enjoyed movie and format , also liked the features very much !
890;Very famous and classy horror/thriller.
891;A lot of other films have immitated this classic film and a spoof was made as well silence of the hams and all that goes to prove how popular and controversial this film became.
892;Hopkins delivers a brilliant performance as Hannibal the cannibal an Foster does a good performance as Claris Starling.
893;Its been many years since I saw the film, its great to see it after all these years and remember the cool looks
894;It's simply one of the absolute best movies you can watch.
895;The best suspence movie I've ever seen.
896;In my openion it tops the Alfred Hitchcock's thriller Physco .
897;This is just a classic.
898;I loved the book and I love the film.
899;Red Dragon comes in a close second
900;It was a decent thriller that at times scared me.
901;I saw Hannibal before I saw Silence of the Lambs , so I kind of did it in reverse.
902;After seeing Hannibal I thought that the Silence of the Lambs would have been more about Hannibal Lecter, the main character of Hannibal .
903;But it was still a decent movie with a couple of surprises.
904;It is a good movie it's just not a non.
905;Silence of the Lambs was a terrific thriller.
906;Jodie Foster was excellent as a police officer who seeks a cannibal's help to catch a gruesome serial killer.
907;Dr. Hannibal Lecture (Hopkins) is very realistic as the cannibalistic psycho who helps Foster catch a serial killer named Buffalo Bill.
908;stomached, but is definetly worth a look.
909;The plot is realistic, the suspense is unpredictable, and the climax is chilling.
910;This movie deserved the Best Picture oscar, and thank god it got it.
911;Check out this movie and you'll like it.
912;The Silence of the Lambs (1991) was truly a magnificent movie.
913;This film combined an excellent plot, excellent acting, wonderful directing, and a very dark musical score to make it more than the regular suspense/thriller genre that one is accustomed to.
914;All of the Oscars won by this film, its director, its actors and actress were all well deserving.
915;director Jonathan Demme does a wonderful job of portraying this movie based on Thomas Harris' novel.
916;Every time Starling feeds Lecter a piece of her past he gives her a clue needed to help catch Buffalo Bill.
917;Starling uses her new information to carry on with the investigation of Bill, all the while trying to acheive her ultimate goal of becoming a FBI agent in the Behavior Science Division.
918;history shows films that win Oscars for Best Picture usually become a Classic.
919;I feel that in twenty or thirty years this film will be no exception, and it will be listed with some of the most popular classics of our time.
920;i rated this film 5 stars because it is a film in its own genre.
921;I have yet to experience another film with its magnitude.
922;I strongly encourage all film viewers who enjoy a strong suspense/thriller to watch this film.
923;this is still the best of the Hannibal movies.
924;One of the American Film Industry's Top 100 Films of All.
925;time, The Silence of the Lambs was by far the best film of the Hannibal Lecter series, films inspired and based on the books by Thomas Harris.
926;jodie Foster has a strong performance and proves herself a worthy choice for playing Clarice, a character of suspicion, bravery, and intruige.
927;anthony Hopkins steals the show as Hannibal, a malicious and violent, albeit brilliant man.
928;His flawless performance is marvelous in suspense and in realism.
929;above all, Harris' book, the second of the fabulous series, is wonderfully adapted for the big screen, with tremendous acting, great acting and mystery, and a wonderful ending leaving questions and the yearning for more.
930;Highly recommended for anyone liking physiological thrillers, mind games and cat and mouse chase.
931;Classic horror/drama with great acting.
932;The story boards would make great stand alone art pieces.
933;This classic horror film won 5 Oscars including Best Picture,a rare feat indeed!!!
934;The Silence of the Lambs is the scariest movie I have ever seen (although I have NOT seen The Exorcist ).
935;It is one of those stories that sucks you in from the very beginning.
936;The imagery is very strong throughout the picture.
937;The final confrontation will shock you.
938;This psychological thriller won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1991, and I can see why.
939;The Silence of the Lambs is really a mesh of stories that all end up working together to achieve a goal of greatness.
940;One, and perhaps the most chilling and complex of the three, is the story of a highly intellectual man with a taste for human flesh, kept hidden from the world until it becomes evident that he may have a way of helping the trainee discover the whereabouts of the killer.
941;adapted from the novel by Thomas Harris, the film is a cauldron of mixed emotions that the audience will feel in every chilling moment.
942;Jonathan Demme has created a masterpiece of the mind as well as a chilling thriller to jangle the nerves until the final, climactic ending.
943;face with Hannibal, she learns that he is more than a monster: he is an intellectual machine with a flair for large words and turning colorful phrases.
944;this film is such a masterpiece in terms of horror and suspense.
945;This movie is so much more complex, so complex that it can be frightening.
946;She appears so broken that it looks as if she is reliving the entire experience, while at the same time keeping the one goal in mind to find the serial killer at large.
947;the most frightening of all is the way in which Hannibal is portrayed.
948;Perhaps one of the most unique villians in all of Hollywood, the best part of his character is that the movie and novel do not play him out as a lunatic, but instead as a highly intelligent psychologist whose only crime is that of cannibalism.
949;Hannibal is able to offer information to the authorities as to the background of the man who they suspect is the killer, and the way in which he offers his information is quite suspenseful.
950;We find that he has a deep emotional attachment to her because of what she tells him about her past, and you'll find that to be one of the most intense realizations of the movie.
951;the two leads both won Academy Awards for their performances in this picture, and it's quite easy to see why.
952;Jodie Foster is remarkable and stunning as Clarice Starling, who is innocent in the beginning and becomes swept up in emotional trauma and stress as she allows Lector to question her about her past.
953;Her performance here is intense and true.
954;Anthony Hopkins is masterful as Hannibal Lector, and his performance here is the entire centerpiece for the suspense of the film.
955;Hopkins plays every aspect of Lector's persona to perfection, a great achievement in his acting career.
956;winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, The Silence of the Lambs is a complex and stunning tale that dives deep into the minds of its characters and goes straight to the mind of its audiences.
957;Expectations are sure to be met, for the movie has everything you could want: intelligence, thrills, chills, scares, action, emotion, and complexity.
958;Timeless, cerebral, repulsive, tense, wry and meticulously made film.
959;A very smart thriller, almost on the side of a horror movie.
960;but it did win the academy award for best picture.
961;A mesterfully done suspense thriller.
962;One of the scariest films ever made.
963;Silence terrifys you, while at times you feel like you're going to throw up.
964;With outstanding performances by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins, Silence is a must see horror film if you really want to tremble.
965;With Lectors help, Starling gets closer to cathing Bob.
966;Lector also gets deep in Starling's psyche, seeing that her father died when she was a child.
967;Hannibal eventually escapes from prison, and people are worried that he will come after Starling.
968;featuring some of the best lines ever used in a movie including I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.
969;and By the way, love your suit.
970;Silence has excellent performances by Foster and Hopkins who both won Oscars.
971;This film is worth a view just to see Hopkins become Hannibal Lector.
972;There are even outtakes which alone are pretty funny, especially when everyone is so serious in the movie.
973;The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best thrillers ever.
974;It still holds up after all these years.
975;Watch it while enjoying some fava beans and a fine chianti.
976;This is one of those movies.
977;This may even be the greatest thriller ever made.
978;It is a fast paced edge.
979;There is one true gruesome scene in the movie, but the rest is pure psychological suspense.
980;Dr. Lecter and Clarice soon develop a bond never thought possible and begin to share their deepest thoughts and fears.
981;anthony Hopkins gives the performance of his career as the terrifying and mysterious Hannibal The Cannibal Lecter and shows how true horror lies within your mind.
982;Jodie Foster is absolutely brilliant as the FBI trainee Clarice Starling, along with the rest of the cast.
983;There are plenty of teasers and trailers for the movie for people who like that sort of thing, as I do.
984;As sommeone on the crew said, it spans several genres.
985;detective story, fairy tale, morality play, psychological thriller, horror movie.
986;It excels at each of them in a way that no other film had done before, and few have done since.
987;So many things about the movie stay with you, and make it worth seeing again and again.
988;Not many film adaptations of books are good, but whoo!
989;This one sure isn't lacking!
990;A great performance of what life in the light of a serial killer.
991;A great production on the set.
992;This is a great movie to watch in the dark.
993;Jonathan Demme's tense thriller combines excellent actors and a wonderfully adapted screenplay to make, what seems to be one of the best, if not the best, thrillers of all time.
994;this film has three accounts and everyone knows the story.
995;first I will praise the film's merits.
996;Yes it does have excellent performances.
997;And Demme does superb things with his camera.
998;It combines tenses scenes with a cast like no other.
999;When it comes to violence this film is very intense.
1000;Hannibal's ability to destroy someone mentally is incredibly disturbing, and the films motives are pretty full on.
1001;this movie is one of my favorite movies.
1002;Awesome movie and awesome classic.
1003;Anyone who loves thrillers or suspenseful movies should watch this classic and true movie goers can't say they haven't seen it.
1004;Jodi foster plays a great cop and really keeps you on the edge of your seat
1005;Anthony Hopkins is super creepy in this.
1006;Even though this movie was out when I was like 2, it's a classic story line with a twisting plot.
1007;If you are intrigued by suspense dramas, then make sure to watch The Silence of the Lambs .
1008;Actors Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Scott Glenn captivate their audienced and dominate their competition by winning numerous awards including an Oscar for best picture and an Academy Award for best screenplay.
1009;Anthony Hopkins rounded up the films sucess by seizing an Oscar for best actor.
1010;in addition to the films award winning sucess, this eccentric drama encompasses all aspects of mentality and mystery.
1011;The intriguing Clarice Starling(Foster), a FBI academy graduate, is asked to use her skills as well as her physical essence by FBI agent Jack Crawford in hopes of gaining an insight into Hannibal Lector's (Hopkins) demented yet brilliant mind.
1012;The exclusive interviews and character insights illuminates the character roles within the film and how it was created.
1013;The film and its characters are intriguing and its extras are beautifully mastered to enhance the film and enlighten the viewer.
1014;A powerful film that will make you think and listien to yourself as well as your surroundings.
1015;This psychological thriller will blow your mind the first time you see it.
1016;Jonathan Demme achieved movie perfection with his adaptation of Thomas J. Harris's novel about brilliant, pathological, cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) who is interviewed by FBI agent.
1017;The critics obviously agreed, as this was the third movie in history to sweep all five of the top Oscar categories.
1018;The true brilliance of the film lies in its ability to chill the viewer without the use of gore or special effects.
1019;He has some unforgettable lines in the movie (and Anthony Hopkins only required a mere cumulative 16 minutes of screen time to earn his Best Actor award for this role).
1020;this movie has a well.
1021;deserved place in history, and it chills the viewer well, even a decade after its original release.
1022;One of the greatest movies of all time, then and now.
1023;This is by far the best screen adaptation of one of Harris' Hannibal series of books.
1024;One disc is placed nicely, while the other is on some kind of flip.
1025;This is a must for anyone who enjoys the criminal psycology genre.
1026;Great movie, great extra stuff on 2nd disc!

1028;takes are fun, great overall experience.
1029;It is truly a crime and horror classic movie and the acting is superb.

1031;it is a very good movie and I recommend it to you, just remember it is deep and ghastly film!
1032;wanting to watch the rest of the story.
1033;Love this movie and I'm not usually a fan of horror at all.
1034;Great acting all the way.
1035;I particularly enjoyed the added features on this special edition.
1036;Deliciously creepy and beautifully crafted movie.
1037;Starts strong, gets stronger, finishes like a freight train.
1038;My son and I saw this movie for the first time and it is amazing even more than 20 years later.
1039;I recommend this movie for those who enjoy psychological thrillers.
1040;Great flick to watch more than once.
1041;Everything looks good and runs smoothly.
1042;The disc and case are in great condition.
1043;Jonathan Demme's superb adaptation of Thomas Harris's petrifying page turner makes for an equally riveting, disturbing film.
1044;"wielding Norman Bates in ""Psycho"" look like a boy scout."
1045;"One of the more potent shockers out there, ""Silence"" is not for the squeamish, but those who can take it will love it."
1046;The film won a slew of major Oscars, including Picture, Actor, Actress.
1047;This is by far the scariest movie ever made, in my opinion.
1048;"Based on Thomas Harris's bestselling novel of the same title, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a riveting psychological descent into the mad realm of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) that works best as a psychological horror movie."
1049;"Without question, one of Jonathan Demme's best films and a genuine cinematic classic, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is truly gripping, replete with excellent performances from both Foster and Hopkins, who offer filmgoers two of their finest performances (Foster's heroic portrayal of young Starling certainly deserved its Academy Award for best actress.)"
1050;who is held in a maximum security prison cell .
1051;Demme focuses the intense drama between both characters by aiming the camera directly into their faces, with most of the scenes between Starling and Lecter filmed as though we are witnessing the interrogation from Starling's eyes.
1052;a brilliant psychological thriller that probes into the minds of viewers ever since it's release.
1053;Based on the same book by Thomas Harris, this is a great movie that combines horror with some gory violence, fantastic performances and intelligence.
1054;It's a cold, cruel and thrilling motion picture from Jonathan Demme that won the 1992 academy awards for best picture and it's score by Howard Shore is excellent as well, it's a class act masterpiece.
1055;"part ""From Page to Screen"" documentary, photo gallery, trailer and TV Spots."
1056;Great movie, even though I have seen it many times, it's still as good as the first watch
1057;The Silence of the Lambs is one of those classic movies.
1058;If you like suspenseful/psychological thrillers, this movie is for you.
1059;It will keep you attention and you'll want to keep watching it over and over.
1060;Hopkins performance surely rates as one of the best performances, male or female, in Hollywood history.
1061;credit also goes, in enormous quantities, to Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster.
1062;The images were clear, original, and gripping.
1063;He has done such a terrific job of creating Lecter as a devil, that when I think of him, I clothe him in colors of fire.
1064;This is where Demme (and Hopkins and Foster, for that matter) shines.
1065;and his diction is flawless, perfect, and amazing, capturing his contemptful personality .
1066;the camera is completely focused on his face, and the lighting and shadows that Demme employs evokes images of every devil or demon our imagination, or literature, has ever conjured.
1067;this scene, and everything that follows (the second meal of raw meat, the killing of the guards), is a breathtaking piece of artistry.
1068;this is, quite simply, the very best thriller Hollywood has ever produced.
1069;My second favorite movie of all times and the best movie made since Gone With the Wind.
1070;Silence of the Lambs is one of the three movies I have seen in my life that I give five stars to.
1071;An excellent movie in all aspecks!
1072;I would recommend this movie to anyone, a great achievement that has been to me one of the greatest films ever made.
1073;Hopkins makes us believe he is a deranged killer, even when he is acting somewhat civilized.
1074;I thought the direction was superb.
1075;then when you finally realize this, well it's pretty cool.
1076;and the scenes actually in the house are pretty intense as well.
1077;the direction was awesome, Anthony Hopkins was amazing.
1078;the movie is spine tingling, thought provoking and I believe anyone who thinks they like SAW should really rethink how interesting a character he is when you have someone like Dr. Hannibal Lechter lerking about.
1079;Won 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture.
1080;I thought it was a worthwhile film to see at least once.
1081;"The only film that can be dubbed a ""horror film"" to win the Oscar for Best Picture, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a film that has and continues to stand the test of time."
1082;#65 on The American Film Institute's Top 100, it's also one of the few films on that list to actually make the average film critic's top 100 as well.
1083;As Clarice begins interviewing Lecter, she finds herself drawn further into the case and finds herself forming a sort.
1084;This scene is simple, yet unforgettable.
1085;It's this kind of body language (among other things) that won Anthony Hopkins the Oscar.
1086;Few other actors have created characters that have had so much effect on our society (other examples would be Marlon Brando and Al Pacino).
1087;Foster is also effective as Starling, considering she's in damn near every scene of the film.
1088;She's also the moral center of the film, as well as the protagonist.
1089;Foster does both and makes it completely believable.
1090;The Silence of the Lambs is a perfect film, at least of it's genre.
1091;Like those movies, every scene is absolutely necessary for the film to function as a whole.
1092;"Howard Hawks once defined a great movie as ""three great scenes and no bad scenes."""
1093;The Silence of the Lambs has more than three great scenes, several legendary ones, and no bad scenes.
1094;"After 16 years, more people still see this than they do its sequel and prequel ""Hannibal"" and ""Red Dragon."""
1095;"I'm sure in 16 more years, it will still be seen more than those two films and it's recent 2nd prequel ""Hannibal Rising."
1096;Now we are at my favorite and considered by many to be the best of the Hannibal series Silence Of The Lambs released in 1991 big hit I know it got a lot of awards.
1097;This is 1 of those movies that I can agree with the critics on.
1098;I have the Blu Ray which it the transfer is great.
1099;It has commentary Breaking The Silence.
1100;Jonathon Demme did a great job.
1101;This is a great film.
1102;It certainly marks Demme's peak as a director, the performances are virtually flawless, and it deserves all the accolades and awards it was given.
1103;I've watched it with pleasure more than once and will do so again.
1104;(I've often wondered precisely how he got up there.
1105;Hauled up by a middle.
1106;But I challenge anybody to explain how a new unfaded mini.
1107;all the same, somebody put 'em in, and there must be an explanation.
1108;The movie has always been a good, exciting, and entertaining movie.
1109;ray there is more detail but it also shows its age a bit.
1110;This is a classic movie.
1111;Great acting, great story and just an all.
1112;The Silence of the Lambs is probably one of the best movies of all time.
1113;This particular edition has really nice extras.
1114;The recipes inside are an especially nice touch.
1115;jerking drama's that get so much attention, but the full.
1116;FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) believes that Lecter who is also a very powerful and clever mind manipulator have the answers to their questions to help locate the killer.
1117;Clarice must first try and gain Lecter's confidence before he is to give away any information.
1118;the Silence of the Lambs is a clever, chilling and brain.
1119;The performances are quite simply superb, the two leads, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both pull off uniquely amazing performances, and they have a great screen chemistry, while Scott Glenn and Ted Levine back them up nicely.
1120;Director Jonathan Demme pieces everything together awesomely with Ted Tally's extraordinary script, adapted from Thomas Harris' novel.
1121;On the subject of books and novels, this is one of the few films that has surpassed the high standards of its book, and The Silence of the Lambs deserved to be praised for that alone!The Silence of the Lambs is a brilliant, immediate classic that everyone should've seen after 10 years of stunning the world.
1122;This movie is a masterpiece of terror and violence.
1123;It is very well made with very good special effects that leave you feeling sick.
1124;A very good story line and cast of actors.
1125;The cast is really makes this movie sooooo good, they just work so well together.
1126;Anthony Hopkins is amazing in this movie as well as Hannibal and Red Dragon these are both really amazing as well.
1127;See the story unfold and feel the terror of Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
1128;I've seen all three and this is definitely the best one!
1129;This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again.
1130;If you have never watched this movie I highly recommend that you do.
1131;Anthony Hopkins portrayal as Hannibal Lector is amazing.
1132;If watch this movie I guarantee that you will watch the rest of the series.
1133;Red Dragon, Hannibal, Hannibal Rising (a prequel), even Manhunter is worth watching as well ( it isnt part of the Anthony Hopkins franchise) The new TV series Hannibal is awesome too.
1134;Awesome story, absolutely superb acting.
1135;Yet, you will have to watch to watch it at least two times for you to understand it really well.
1136;good story and very good acting.
1137;would recommend it to people who like that type of stories and movies
1138;Many things or people can evoke this emotion, many of the most popular movies of all time feature villains that provoke this emotion from their prey.
1139;since buried, the stronger the fascination Lecter has for Clarice grows.
1140;"Will Clarice and the FBI gain enough insight from Lecter to stop 'Buffalo Bill', or is Lecter merely using them to accomplish his own means?Terrific directing on behalf of Jonathan Demme, and outstanding performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is by far one of the most shocking, suspenseful thrillers ever to be made."
1141;"Winning over both audiences and critics alike, ""The Silence of the Lambs"" earned every one of its 5 academy awards, including Best Picture."
1142;"If you are a fan of thrillers, or of the novels by Thomas Harris, or if you enjoyed ""Red Dragon"", then ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is definitely a must."
1143;The acting, writing, cinematography, and dramatic lighting effects are awesome.
1144;The story, based on my favorite book by Thomas Harris of the same title, is incredibly chilling.
1145;Anthony Hopkins makes the most of his part and leaves you with an impression that will haunt you forever.
1146;Including Anthony Hopkins only Oscar which he won for Best Actor, and Jodie Foster's for Best Actress.
1147;It even won Best Picture of the Year.
1148;For being a relatively early special edition, it has some great features, although i wish that the commentary was scene specific.
1149;Still kept you on the edge of your seat even after so many years.
1150;This is one of the best suspenseful/creepy movies ever made!
1151;I remember watching it when it first came out.
1152;it's one of the few movies that I'm still willing to go back and watch over.
1153;I have always imagined the Devil to be something like that, weirdly fascinating and eminently civilised.
1154;well written, unbelievably acted, intense and suspenseful as few movies can be, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS avoids the fate of a slasher flick and becoms instead a journey through the depest fears in all of us.
1155;All the actors, but especially Anthony Hopkins, gave award winning performances in my opinion but Mr. Hopkins' interpretation of the cannibal made for a sleepless night's sleep
1156;Thrilling and suspenseful film that keeps you on your toes and wanting more.
1157;Always a solid movie to watch or if have haven't seen it, now is the time!
1158;Silence of the Lambs is an intense psychological thriller.
1159;Anthony Hopkins is truly creepy and believable and Hannibal the cannibal.
1160;Jodie Foster is great as the rookie FBI agent given a case that required her to learn fast and think faster.
1161;I like this movie very much.
1162;Will probably watch it a few more.
1163;Jodi Foster and good old Hanable man is always good no mater what they arein.
1164;This is a suspense movie that happens to be quite thrilling and thought provoking.
1165;While it may be disturbing to younger viewers I the storyline is fascinating.
1166;I bought this as a gift for someone who has never seen it!
1167;I thought everyone has seen it.
1168;Anthony Hopkins portrays canniballistic Hannibal Lector beautifully and puts chills down your spine.
1169;There are several musical pieces in this movie that make it worthwhile, along with Sir Anthony Hopkins, who always delivers.
1170;He prefers to murder women of a certain age and size.
1171;this movie is a classic.
1172;It's graphic, powerful, intense, and very well done in every aspect of cinema.
1173;The acting, soundtrack, and story are top notch.
1174;It's a must see for anyone who can handle deranged subject matter.
1175;The only horror movie to ever wine best picture.
1176;This has some cool extras too.
1177;"The picture looks sharp and clean
I:8404;1178;The MGM disc has 22, including all from the Criterion disc, albeit some are in truncated form.
I:8404;1179;And they all look and sound much better.
I:8404;1180;One of them is a dramatic shot of Lector, close to tears, speaking to the camera about Buffalo Bill's sickness and, via special effects, the prison wall MOVING towards him.
I:8404;1181;minute featurette made in '91, and an engaging 1.
I:8404;1182;hour feature has a well.
I:8404;1183;rounded coverage about the making of the film, including production design, costuming, special effects (those moths were """"dressed up"""" since real ones couldn't be obtained), sound design, and of course the various themes of the story."""
1184;the skull figure on the moth is actually made up of figures of naked women.
1185;This is a heady thriller that was made way before its time.
1186;Not a lot of action and no explosions, but the viewer sits riveted to the screen nonetheless.
1187;The characters are well portrayed and you will not forget it.
1188;Anthony Hopkins is the master at playing Hannibal Lector, and Jodie Foster does an excellent job as Clarice.
1189;While I won't go into too much plot detail, I will say that this movie is a masterpiece.
1190;What makes this movie so good is the superb acting, and the enjoyable story.
1191;Also be aware that after seeing this movie, you'll be hooked instantly.
1192;Hopefully this is cleared up and remastered in the Special Edition.
1193;Again, I will say that this is a great movie, but what would you expect from a movie with all of the awards it's won?
1194;Best Actor/Actress, Best Film, to name a few.
1195;This set included a full disc of the background of the filming.
1196;Two great Actors bring the whole story to a bold fear factor.
1197;A must see for suspense.
1198;It will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.
1199;This movie was so funny!
1200;It wasn't scary, it was funny!
1201;I loved Anthony Hopkins and Miss Foster in this movie.
1202;The silence of the lambs was an exciting movie that i would like to watch over agian.
1203;dr. Hannibal Lecter has got to be one of the best villians, yet also one of the most sophisicated.
1204;His Hannibal Lechter really proves that you should always keep track of your writing implements.
1205;I watch this movie constantly.
1206;I would explain the background of that statement but it's so much better if you watch.
1207;This takes Clarice, and us, into the psychotic world of a serial killer.
1208;The cocoon belongs to the rare Death's.
1209;Because he wants to be a woman, a transexual!
1210;(See the excellent sequel HANNIBAL to find out the outcome.)
1211;The cast is fabulous: Hopkins has created a new villain for our pop culture, someone that we can be genuinely afraid of just by his raspy.
1212;In 1986, director Michael Mann (THE INSIDER) directed British actor Brian Cox in MANHUNTER, based on Thomas Harris's first Lecter adventure, Red Dragon.
1213;Winner of 5 Academy Awards in 1991 include: Best Picture .
1214;"Edward Saxon, Ron Bozman Kenneth Utt, producers
I:8404;1215;Jonathan Demme"
1216;"Anthony Hopkins
I:8404;1217;Jodie Foster"
1218;Jonathan Demme's psychological thriller remains one of the best, simply because of the excellent talent involved, with Anthony Hopkins in superbly creepy form as Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
1219;Jodie Foster, along with Hopkins, deservedly won an Academy Award for her brilliant performance as FBI agent Clarice Starling.
1220;But there are some extremely effective shocks and twists during the course of the film.
1221;Although the film's plot centres around tracking down the crazed serial killer named Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), Hopkins is the standout performance.
1222;played and enthralling, and there are some moving moments with Lecter that add to the film's gravitas.
1223;edged direction won him an Oscar, and the film picked up the Best Film Award also.
1224;Well, that SILENCE is the most superbly.
1225;this is a great movie .
1226;at least this movie has a piont and a good one at that .
1227;i loved this movie .
1228;it kept you on the edge of your seat !
1229;it has its funny parts , its scary parted and its down right wierd parts but all in all it is awsome !
1230;every once in a while you hear or see something that makes you remember the movie .
1231;you should deffinetly watch this movie !
1232;All of the Hannibal Lector movies are great but this one is probably my personal favorite of all.
1233;foster is great and The underrated performance by Ted Levine is chilling and almost gives Hopkins a run for his money.
1234;everything about this movie is great.
1235;The viewing helped me to remember just how great this film is and it also helped to show just what Hannibal was missing.Silence of the Lambs is one of the most shocking, exciting, suspenseful and tense movies ever released.
1236;It pulls no punches from Thomas Harris novel (unlike Manhunter) and is a very stark, unrelenting film.
1237;It is easily top of the heap for the suspense or psychological thriller genre and upon a viewing it is easy to see why.
1238;The film possesses so many great qualities at the hands of the director and his actors that is a true standout.
1239;She soon finds herself swept up in the case of a lifetime as the FBI attempts to track down active serial killer Buffalo Bill.
1240;It is a wonderful story that has more to it than most serial killer movies because aside from the cops vs. serial killer aspect of the story it has a whole other subplot with the Hannibal Lector character.
1241;Two serial killers are better than one.
1242;the acting is the best part of the film and while Anthony Hopkins has received much praise for his brilliant portrayal of Lector I feel that Jodie Fosters performance is the best in the film and one of the greatest performances ever to be put on celluloid.
1243;I dont think I breathed once while she was on the screen and every word she says is unbelievably powerful.
1244;The scene where she talks about the lamb is one of the finest monologues ever.
1245;Her and Hopkins performances help to create this great sexual tension which surrounds the film and helps to create its great feel.
1246;jonathon Demmes directing is perfect.
1247;He creates an atmosphere of true grit and of stark realism.
1248;He avoids flashiness and instead brings in extreme maturity and patience to the film.
1249;The sound had a couple of bad spots but for the most part it was great.
1250;The extras are great too with the deleted scenes being very interesting.
1251;It lacked all of the elements that made this film great.
1252;But we will always have this film to re.
1253;The novel by Thomas Harris is fantastic and you should read it.
1254;The film is great and you should watch it.
1255;fest, yet somehow it is both a great book and a great movie!
1256;This is king of classics and probably the best book adaptation ever.
1257;Foster at her best aswell shes one of my personal favorite long term actresse's and id recommend any of her movies accept busgy malone.
1258;he somehow manages to put out an even creepier performance than hannibal lector and that is a huge feat let me tell you.
1259;PS its an asome song from the 80's id recommend it to any 80's music lovers in a heart beat.
1260;"An early look at prominent actors like Foster and Hopkins which helped the film to win five awards
I:8404;1261;In real black scenes, the black has reddots in it.
I:8404;1262;He is one of the very few villains I cheer for.
I:8404;1263;It'll keep you on the edge of your seat, even after the first time you see it.
I:8404;1264;Such a classic movie, whats not to love about it?
I:8404;1265;Hopkins plays Hannibal Lector, the sociopath who is very charming and intelligent one minute and the next is eating another person's face off.
I:8404;1266;Clarice (Jodi Foster) makes a very rare connection with Dr. Lector, as he helps her understand serial murderer Buffalo Bill and capture him.
I:8404;1267;This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen!
I:8404;1268;Well, you'll just have to watch the movie, and they'll tell you.
I:8404;1269;This is really a wonderful movie, two thumbs up, 5 stars, and full of suspense!
I:8404;1270;This is a lot of fun to watch and I'd reccomend it to everyone!
I:8404;1271;This movie is the best of it's type.
I:8404;1272;The acting and the direction are absolutely superb.
I:8404;1273;The story, based on the Thomas Harris book is totally engrossing.
I:8404;1274;If you live on the moon and haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and watch it.
I:8404;1275;Last year I saw in on one of the HBO channels, so I watched it, and it was at the ending.
I:8404;1276;anthony Hopkins does a fantastic job playing the psycho, and I was really brought into the mindframe that he was Hannibal Lector.
I:8404;1277;I loved the ending sequence when she is blinded by darkness, and Buffalo Bill is stalking her in his home.
I:8404;1278;this is a very suspenseful movie, and it has a terrific cast.
I:8404;1279;I would recommend it to anyone.
I:8404;1280;Any one that has their favorite book to re.
I:8404;1281;In 1991 one of the worlds most acclaimed films of all time hit the world.
I:8404;1282;The emotions of the watcher are also toyed with and this adds to the hysteria created when viewing.
I:8404;1283;it is also one of the most crisp and original adaptations ever made, it is extremely good at mimicing certain things out of the novel but doesn't just copy it outright, it has its own ideas too, such as the """"look deep with in yourself Clarice Starling"""" and replacing the Big Amarone with a nice Chianti which I do think has a better ring to it."""
1284;the action scenes are built with skills beyond that of nearly any other film ever made, it is a horror film, it is a thriller, it is a drama and it incorporates these genres and merges them with great effect to create this masterpiece.
1285;"it is true, so very true, this film is too good to be true I just go ""f. f. f. f. f. f. f. f "" everytime I see it."
1286;When I was younger it probably seemed kind of spooky and scary but now its just hilarious to me.
1287;Its truely one of my favorite movies, high on my list.
1288;control monster movie (but, as it turned out, he was the best choice).
1289;Sometimes, placing a horror film director behind the scenes of a straight drama film can work wonders, and occasionally putting a musical director behind the chariot of a blockbuster thriller can provide small miracles.
1290;Sometimes, the layered skills of a director can provide the same decent palette strokes upon a previously non.
1291;traversed canvas as it can upon familiar stomping grounds, but often this will produce more effective results.
1292;Move the mind of a musical adapter into the playing field of a horror story and you may get something spectacular as a result.
1293;Serial killers had become the new vampires and werewolves back in 1991, and this film goes towards that sensibility with full.
1294;Demme did a great job in building the tension.
1295;and there are certain aspects of its mystery genre writing that make the film fascinating in some of its minutia (I love the insect studies angle, for example).
1296;To me, there is a certain nostalgic value to it, and I enjoy it on that FBI/cop movie.
1297;it's as good as one that you'll find from the 90's.
1298;Great acting and super suspenseful!
1299;With a mix of nail.
1300;biting suspense, disturbing subject matter, terrific acting (with Anthony Hopkins delivering perhaps the best performance of the 1990's), and odd yet damn near perfect camera work on the part of a committed Demme, this film is simply superb.
1301;Love Jodie Foster, great actress.
1302;This is a great movie!
1303;Jodie Foster shows great acting skills.
1304;My package arrived sooner than promised and was in excellent condition!
1305;Hopkins is a captured killer who knows how these people think.
1306;Over time Foster is drawn to Hopkins, Hopkins subtly manipulates Foster, and the killer keeps doing his thing.
1307;but I've seen Silence of the Lambs multiple times and adored it each time.
1308;It absolutely deserves its #65 ranking on the AFI top 100.
1309;The plot is fantastic and draws you in right from the very beginning.
1310;The actors are all fantastic.
1311;From Foster to Hopkins, from Levine to Glenn, you see their twist of motivations, their pulls and concerns, and how the relationships build.
1312;I love the scenes that examine the role of men and women in the police / FBI forces.
1313;They are handled very deftly.
1314;When Foster is presented, she's shown as a strong, athletically talented, intellectually gifted woman.
1315;And even so, the men around her look at her and see her beauty.
1316;Glenn is both a mentor and interested in her as a woman.
1317;"When she and Glenn go to a crime scene, he ""protects"" her and draws the Sheriff to the side in order to discuss a sensitive topic."
1318;He acknowledges that she is right.
1319;out of all the movies in the AFI top 100, this is amazingly probably the best one in terms of female characters!
1320;With all the great movies on this list .
1321;Gone with the Wind, Annie Hall, Doctor Zhivago, that feature strong women, it's Silence of the Lambs that features some of the best women.
1322;But here Foster has a sharp, wise African.
1323;there are so many ways in which this movie shines.
1324;The plot is engaging and insightful.
1325;The actors are masters of their crafts.
1326;The tension in the scenes is masterfully handled.
1327;"I love ""The Silence of the Lambs."""
1328;It is one of my favorite movies.
1329;As one reviewer said, she enjoyed movies that (pull you in) so that you feel far, far away.
1330;Lambs stands head and shoulders above other horror movies because it is done with class and believability, unlike others that just feature repeated scenes of gore.
1331;Jodie Foster's and Anthony Hopkin's acting are superb, getting inside Lecter's mind portrays the true, calculated nature of evil at its worst rather than just scenes of gore for shock value.
1332;The scene where he asks Miss Starling if she ever saved her lamb has such spiritual resonance i almost cried.
1333;everything is brilliant from beginning to end, from Clarice's revealing of her mind setting the stage to Hannibal's escape, to the very real threat of young women with kind personalities being the perfect target for rape and murder, to ultimately, evil being triumphed by good as our heroic rookie takes on Buffalo Bill, to the chilling cliffhanger of our escaped villain, Lecter.
1334;A must see for any fan of top.
1335;notch movie making, deep story line, and the a true portrayal of good and evil.
1336;FANTASTIC, ON THE EDGE, GET IT!
1337;Best version of Hannibal out there.
1338;One of the best nail biters!!
1339;Probably the best performance by Jody Foster since Taxi.
1340;Even without the blood and gore, he actually thought it was very good!
1341;Silence of the Lambs is a thriller that only others can aspire to.
1342;Much darker and deeper than most, the stars carry their parts with exquisite, chilling moments from the beginning.
1343;The give and take between them grabs your attention and from that point on you are emersed in the mind games and intelligent sparing for information between the two.
1344;"The FBI is hopeful that Lechter can go into the mind of a serial killer on the loose, ""Buffalo Bill."""
1345;silence of the Lambs is both disturbing and yet transformational with the caterpillar turning into a beautiful moth or butterfly theme.
1346;Clarice fights her fears and finds her own strength and courage through Lechter in a odd way.
1347;The film is an unforgettable classic.
1348;jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins were made for the parts they played, and they did it to perfection.
1349;As for Hopkins, his last great performance was in FREEJACK, and his work here is more than worthy of a Golden Turkey Award.
1350;As for Hopkins, his last great performance was in FREEJACK, and his work here is more than worthy of a Golden Turkey Award.
1351;One of the best translations from books to movies ever.
1352;One of the best movies ever.
1353;Harris is a great writer.
1354;This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.
1355;Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster were a great duo.
1356;anthony Hopkins' performance was extraordinary.
1357;Jodie Foster's performance was excellent too, especially (not giving a lot away) the part in the basement with the Night.
1358;I'm glad it won the five big Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay).
1359;wise it's not as developed as I'd expect.
1360;Although it is a bit more expensive than this version, it is worth it.
1361;I have seen this movie at least 10 times and it is as suspenseful now as it was the first time I seen it.
1362;This film is among my favorites .
1363;All of those components make this film a superb thriller, not to mention it was filmed in nearby Pittsburgh.
1364;Jodi Foster provides insight into her character, into the filming process, and also the manner in which she won the roll.
1365;I had surprisingly never seen this but was more than impressed by the phenomenal acting by both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.
1366;the movie kept me guessing throughout.
1367;the cinemtography, mood, dialogue, pacing, costumes, and villians .
1368;Its style has been so copied and done that Silence of the Lambs merely now seems like among the best of its type, rather than a groundbreaking thriller.
1369;still, I'd highly recommend its viewing, if nothing else but to see where the X. files took its basic skeleton from.
1370;It is so well made, so encapsulating and the characters are so strong and compelling.
1371;One of my favorite films ever made right here called silence of the lambs an amazing and very original film.
1372;This movie is so good and well paced, if you start at noon you won't beleive all the time that has gone by since you started it.
1373;Anthony Hopkins is unbeleivably perfect for his part, and a great actor.
1374;It will suprise you with unbeleivably creative things.
1375;it is a very intense movie you should see if you haven't, and I also recommend the book sequal: Hannibal.
1376;This a great movie for a take it easy, sit on couch kind of night
1377;Let me tell you how much I love this movie and how great it is.
1378;Anthony Hopkins is absoulutely brilliant as Dr. Lecter and Jodie Foster has her best role ever as Clarice Starling.
1379;The movie is brilliant and it will haunt you forever.
1380;One of the best films ever.
1381;I would recommend this to anyone.
1382;And it has been 15 years before I thought it might be worthwhile to see it again.
1383;Agent Starling presented an unusually strong image for a woman in a suspense film, a hero rather than a helpless victim.
1384;on watching it again, I finally managed to actually 'see' Jonathan Demme's work as director.
1385;Even so Demme manages to extract every ounce of impact from what he does have.
1386;Visual themes are carefully developed, framing is superb, and the viewer reaaly feels in the film rather than simply watching.
1387;I wanted to see it since it's such a popular movie, but definitely disturbing.
1388;This is one of the best movies I Have Ever Scean I Saw this on TV a few weeks ago this is like the only horror movie to win best picture IT won 5 big academy Awards including best picturebest directorBest adapted Screenplaybest Actor [Anthony Hopkins]as Hannibal Lecterbest actress [Jodie Foster] as Clarice StarlingAnd this is also my favorite Horror Movie
1389;thriller, and we don't get enough well done movies like this.
1390;what can I say, a great movie.
1391;This movie is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen.
1392;The storyline is rivoting and the performances are brilliant.
1393;This is one of those rare movies that stays with you for weeks after seeing it.
1394;Anthony Hopkins and Jodies Foster give the performances of their lives!
1395;This movie did not give me as many night mares as Knight Moves did, but it lacked a good plot.
1396;This is one of those films you will watch over 100 times in your life.
1397;This is Jodie Foster at her finest.
1398;One of the greatest films ever made.
1399;Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are superb.
1400;A great flick to watch on a rainy night.
1401;This was one of the greatest Thrillers.
1402;The movie is a big mystery and is very thrilling at the end.
1403;There are few perfect movies made in this world.
1404;The perfect movie is rare indeed.
1405;The first is THE GODFATHER, a film filled with great story, acting, directing, writing, and every tiny aspect of production that makes a perfect film.
1406;i know that I enjoyed this film when I first saw it back in 1991.
1407;I know that I thought it was a good movie and that everyone involved had done a great job.
1408;And to my surprise, after all these years, I found that not only was it a great movie, it was a perfect film.
1409;It seems that he's looked over her record and asks her help in a research project going on involving interviews with convicted and imprisoned serial killers.
1410;And eventually he offers to answer her questionnaire in return for her answering his questions as well.
1411;In return for her honesty, Lecter provides her with clues if she will only put the pieces together.
1412;Whether or not she will realize this and if she can accomplish the feat of capturing another elusive criminal, all while being a cadet still, makes for the most climactic part of the movie.
1413;this movie works on every level.
1414;It works as a tale of a young woman striving to make a name for herself in a world dominated by men.
1415;It works in the tale of a sympathetic homicidal maniac aiding her in her quest.
1416;It works as a police procedural story.
1417;And above all it works as pure entertainment.
1418;But it was Hopkins portrayal that captured audiences enough that they kept coming back for more.You may have seen this film when it came out.
1419;But this is a movie to be watched over and over again, offering something new with each viewing.
1420;ray format you get to see it in pristine condition.
1421;for fans of Hopkins this release also offers something you can use at home.
1422;We have a story that captivates us and holds our attention, giving us clues along the way but not so much that we can figure everything out ahead of our heroine.
1423;We have superb acting as seen not only in the in your face Hopkins as Lecter but the subtle touches used by Foster as Clarice, an agent in training in over her head yet rising to the occasion.
1424;the directing is Jonathan Demme at the top of his game, combining all the elements needed for a good film from pulling the performances from the actors to subtle musical scores that highlight what we are watching to editing the film with the right scenes in the right places to clothing that seems appropriate to each character involved.
1425;He takes the reins here and holds them firmly, pulling out the best of everyone involved.
1426;the look and feel of this movie captivates from the first moments until the last, which offers a funny twist from Lecter himself.
1427;Rarely is a viewer entertained from beginning to end, never looking to see what time it is or how much longer the film has to go.
1428;This is such a film.
1429;This film holds you in its grasp until the credits roll.
1430;And that is the true sign of a perfect film.
1431;Jodi Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Ted Levine as the psychopath give some truly chilling performances, and Roger Corman has a nice cameo as the FBI director, but this film is definitely not as special as people make it to be.
1432;The character of Hannibal Lecter is a great one, and he has some terrific one liners, and despite a few suspenseful moments, this film is very boring.
1433;It's average film making at best.
1434;This is certainly not the greatest modern horror film.
1435;The film was just great.
1436;I really loved this movie.
1437;Jodie Foster was great as Starling.
1438;The entire cast was a standout.
1439;The only reason I kept watching it is because it's such a classic.
1440;not recommended for kids but a great show I bought it and I like it
1441;It's so messed up but good at the same time lol
1442;If you like murder mysteries, and solid drama, and Jodie Foster, there can be no better movie than this one.
1443;This movie is packed with suspense and is so well written.
1444;Anthony Hopkins and Jodi Foster's on screen chemistry is magnificent.
1445;The Silence of the Lambs is by far one of the scariest, most effectively haunting stories ever to be told, and what director could tell it better than Jonathan Demme?
1446;up shots of the actors gives it a hypnotic effect.
1447;Anthony Hopkins gives a remarkable performance.
1448;Unless of course you are eating a nice dish of liver, some fava beans, and a nice Chianti .
1449;For many years I refused to see this film, as some friend had told me about the cannibalistic scenes.
1450;at the same time I received many laudatory comments about the movie.
1451;"i wasn't disappointed
I:8404;1452;awarded with five Oscar, including Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Director and nominated for two more, """"The Silence"""" is an unforgettable experience."""
1453;"judy Foster as Agent Sterling confirms all her artistically virtues shown since she was a teenager in ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), her first Oscar nomination, thru ""The Accused"" (1988), her first Oscar award, the present film and finally, by the moment, ""Nell"" (1994)."
1454;"the other Oscar Monster is Anthony Hopkins, winner of one for this movie and nominated three more times: ""The Remains of the Day"" (1994), ""Nixon"" (1995) and ""Amistad"" (1997)."
1455;this film is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen!
1456;I will recommend it only for adult audiences due to very violent scenes.
1457;It is a great addtion.
1458;It is new so I had no issues with it.
1459;one of my most favorite films of all time, The Silence Of The Lambs is a terrfying look into the mind of one of the most diabolical villians of all time, Hannible Lecter.
1460;Jodie Foster is at her prime in this film, perfectly embodying the strong and fearless Clarice but the film definently belongs to Anthony Hopkins who's potrayl of Hannible Lector is spine chilling yet sophisticated, giving him that sense that he is always four steps ahead of you and that you are powerless against him.
1461;the rest of the cast also deliver great performances and the movie makes a flawless adaptation from book to big screen.
1462;so one of my favorite films, enjoy the delicacy known as the Silence of the Lambs.
1463;this was one of my most favorite childhood movies.
1464;Anthony Hopkins is the best actor in thriller category.
1465;this movie will have you glued to the screen from beginning to the end.
1466;a classic thriller that never gets old!
1467;Wonderful film by Jonathan Demme.
1468;Jodie Foster and Sir Anthony Hopkins give powerful performances that were worthy of the Academy Awards the each received.
1469;A classic thriller that truly holds your attention.
1470;This movie surpases in suspense and realism all of the other thrillers.
1471;anthony Hopkins is at his best in this movie.
1472;A truly brilliant film worthy of the five major Oscars it won: Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay.
1473;In bringing Thomas Harris' blood curdling novel to the screen, director Jonathan Demme keeps everything moving and adding some truly creepy atmospheric touches.
1474;Jodie Foster is marvelous as FBI agent Clarice Starling who enters into a bond with notorious serial killer Hannibal Lechter in trying to uncover the identity of Buffalo Bill, another heinous killer on the loose.
1475;Anthony Hopkins won his Oscar for a little over 16 minutes of screen time, making him the only actor to win the big prize with the shortest screen time.
1476;Scott Glenn offers fine support as Jack Crawford, Foster's boss whose respect and subtle admiration for her character spearheads her chase.
1477;SILENCE OF THE LAMBS spawned two rather inferior sequels, but this film is picture perfect from start to finish.
1478;One of the great American films.
1479;Though nothing can beat the first time you experienced Bill's basement in the dark, Foster and Hopkins' chemistry is still profoundly affecting.
1480;"Well, I finally went out and got the special edition of ""The Silence of the Lambs."""
1481;"visiting ""Hannibal"" after seeing ""Red Dragon,"" I realized how much I really loved this film."
1482;And, I also learned that it was remastered in a high.
1483;Overall verdict: I ended up very happy that I bought this version, because it is far superior to the other two.
1484;And Anthony Hopkins is amazing as Hannibal.
1485;You could tell that he was having fun with it.
1486;The director did a great job of painting us a picture full of darkness, nightmares, and dread.
1487;"Ted Tally did a terrific job of writing a script that was very true to the novel (he also returned to write the screenplay for ""Red Dragon"")."
1488;The lightness and darkness is perfect.
1489;"The sound is also a big improvement
I:8404;1490;There are many special features, which include a brand new documentary that includes new interviews with the cast and crew, 20 minutes of deleted scenes, the original 1991 """"Making of"""" featurette, an outtake reel, trailers, and many more where that came from."""
1491;But I really enjoyed all of the special features.
1492;If this is one of your favorites as well, then I recommend getting it.
1493;After repeated viewings over the years, Silence of the Lambs still keeps me on the edge of my seat.
1494;Great performances move the story along.
1495;If you've never seen it, dontmiss it.
1496;An exceptional movie in it's own rights but one that also did the book justice.
1497;This film is a brilliant, tightly.
1498;plotted masterpiece, a tour de force of masterful acting, absorbing dialogue, and tempo and pacing that is at once highly tense and soothingly mesmerizing.
1499;like rhythm, quiet and subtle yet extraordinarily powerful.
1500;which, I believe, is one of the film's greatest triumphs.
1501;So masterful and convincing is the acting though, andso strong is the psychological appeal of their relationship .
1502;it's a cerebral performance by a thinkingperson's cop in tandem with the inner workings of a brilliant yetterribly sick mind.
1503;The fear is of ourown doing, a creation of our imagination, our own minds working onus.
1504;Out of all the Hannibal Lecter movies, this is the one to see.
1505;Definitly a great movie and suspenseful throughout it all.
1506;Still one of the scariest, most compelling crime dramas ever made.
1507;Jodie Foster is just as mesmerizing as Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins in this cat and mouse game between an FBI agent and a serial killer.
1508;Very good acting and a thrilling plot.
1509;This is a great movie.
1510;It's suspense building, entertaining and Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter is awesome.
1511;Even if you don't enjoy horror movies, this is one you will enjoy.
1512;The anomorphic picture is clear and true to the director's vision.
1513;The 5.1 surround is precise and effectively eerie.
1514;The running commentary with Foster, Hopkins, Director Demme are an excellent insight into making this movie.
1515;Even if you have seen this movie 50 times and already own it, you must see this version to truly appreciate THE thriller of the 90's.
1516;This movie is what I think one of the top thrillers in history!
1517;This is a classic movie.
1518;Another excellent performance by the master.
1519;I was moved by Anthony Hopkins incredible acting and being able to act out as a murderer so well.
1520;I love how this flick shows murder, love, and a mystery that just keeps unfolding.
1521;I have always loved this movie and it is on my 6 favorite movies list.
1522;I believe that almost anybody can enjoy this.
1523;It is an incredible thriller and an enthralling tale that holds its interest throughout the run of the film.
1524;I can't see how anybody wouldn't get something out of Jodie Foster's scene when she is walking in the dark, completely lost, and she shows amazing emotion as if she is really there.
1525;I think everyone should be able to love this film, and is a 90's classic.
1526;The movie includes some amazing acting (it won the Oscar for both Best Actor and Best Actress) and some incredibly intense scene.
1527;The entire film itself is very well done, and fans of the horror or thriller genres shouldn't let too much of their lives go by without seeing it.
1528;Great movie, I can't believe that I never bother to watch this movie before.
1529;Very glad that I did.
1530;Quite simply, this is one of the elite suspense films ever made .
1531;I love drama with intellectual entwinings in the plot and surprise twists and turns.
1532;Really good film, still disturbing after all these years, there's nothing like this in film before or since, many copycats.
1533;Each is terrifying in his own way, and the film's fascinating narrative device calls for one to help the FBI track down the other.
1534;Anthony Hopkins does a masterful job of creating one of my all.
1535;He is a curious mixture of charisma, grace, style, fierce intelligence, and wickedness, brought together with a series of fascinating and terrifying mannerisms.
1536;He is actually in relatively few.
1537;Still, he easily manages to dominate the film.
1538;With each viewing, though, I realize that that is precisely the point.
1539;Throw yourself into a similar situation and see how controlled and composed you are.
1540;And her wandering accent, I now realize, subtly conveys much information about the character's personal history.
1541;these two actors shine most in their scenes together.
1542;She does her best to defend against his probing, while trying to extract some information for herself.
1543;The supporting actors, who would normally blend into the background when confronted by two titanic leads, all acquit themselves well.
1544;the rest of the movie has a lot to live up to in those Lecter.
1545;Thomas Harris' novel and Ted Tally's script deliver a story full of suspense and interest.
1546;What should amount to a cliched premise is heightened by Bill's unique obsessive fetish.
1547;It is revealed slowly, and thus manages the rare feat of rewarding subsequent viewings.
1548;Jonathan Demme's controlled and stylish directing never lets things get out of hand or too over the top, as is the danger in movies of this genre.
1549;"And he allows himself to set up several spectacular set pieces
I:8404;1550;like imagery to great effect).
I:8404;1551;All these elements combine to create a magnum opus that all the participants will be hard.
I:8404;1552;One of those pictures that proves it's worth by remaining an engaging production even under scrutiny of repeated viewings.
I:8404;1553;A fine wine of a film.
I:8404;1554;Jody Foster (Clarice) was excellent .
I:8404;1555;Silence of the Lambs is a very good movie.
I:8404;1556;Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are great as Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lector.
I:8404;1557;The suspense is really the edge.
I:8404;1558;I really think Jodie Foster looks beautiful in this movie.
I:8404;1559;Everything about this movie is great, screenplay, directing, everything.
I:8404;1560;So if you're in the mood for a really suspenseful film.
I:8404;1561;It still gives me shivers every time I watch it.
I:8404;1562;It get a fresh perspective and the layers of symbolism unravel further, giving deeper insight into the twisted genius of Hannibal the Cannibal.
I:8404;1563;I highly recommend you revisit, if you haven't seen it for a while and any first.
I:8404;1564;The steelbook's inside artwork is just great.
I:8404;1565;Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins are great actors.
I:8404;1566;This was by far the best movie i had seen all year.
I:8404;1567;Something about it will haunt you forever and make you very afraid of the world.
I:8404;1568;But this was a phenomenal movie.
I:8404;1569;Here she slays the dragon, rescues the damsel in distress, and conquers evil.
I:8404;1570;The fact that the lead is a woman gives it a twist, as we see Clarise living in a man's world, braving the elements, but at the same time she is more vulnerable to fear and harm.
I:8404;1571;I admired that about her, that she is really scared to death but she is able to pull it all from within to overcome not just her fears but to triumph over evil.
I:8404;1572;the relationship between her and Dr. Lecter is probably what scares but fascinates us the most.
I:8404;1573;He clearly likes her, and keeps her coming back because he wants the attention and to be with her more.
I:8404;1574;And Dr. Lecter loves it, getting into her haunted past to see what he can use, plus feeling that they have a bond or a trust when he has none with anyone.
I:8404;1575;Read the book and you'll get the full picture.
I:8404;1576;There are a lot of comments here regarding the movie's level of scariness.
I:8404;1577;So do not watch it thinking you are going to see the scariest movie of all time.
I:8404;1578;Watch it for the mood and tone.
I:8404;1579;I saw it on vacation and the film is more memorable than the vacation.
I:8404;1580;I can honestly say it is in my top 5 favorite films of all time.
I:8404;1581;It is the most important movie in my collection.
I:8404;1582;It was a great movie and we really enjoyed it.
I:8404;1583;The acting by Jodie Foster and by Anthony Hopkins was superb.
I:8404;1584;Now you can stream it from Hulu Plus if you want.
I:8404;1585;Let me start off by saying what a superb actor Anthony Hopkins is and this movie was so great with him in it.
I:8404;1586;this is a great movie and is must see for horror movies lovers.
I:8404;1587;Every so often there is a movie that really makes you sit up and take notice, something that restores your faith in the entire genre.
I:8404;1588;'Silence Of The Lambs' is just one of those movies, earning cult status and getting numerous awards.
I:8404;1589;Foster and Hopkins give the performances of their career as a young officer eager to impress and an eloquent killer respectively.
I:8404;1590;It is often regarded as one of the best thriller/horror movies ever made, and rightly so.
I:8404;1591;Not only is it scary but it's also gripping and intelligent.
I:8404;1592;It is a memorable movie that impresses on every level.
I:8404;1593;Hopkins and Foster are great.
I:8404;1594;It's a great drama, Horror and thriller.
I:8404;1595;The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best scary movies ever made.
I:8404;1596;It really keeps your interest.
I:8404;1597;Not a slasher film alone"
1598;This is my favorite movie ever.
1599;Best movie by far, I am in love.
1600;Still creeps me out, even after all these years!
1601;It is simply Amazing !!!!!
1602;Watched it again last week and this is still a vastly superior movie than anything that's been put out in the past decade.
1603;Such a great, twisted movie.
1604;I love being kept on the edge of my seat for an entire movie.
1605;The amazing interplay between Foster and Hopkins is the film's main highlight, but the laced with suspense prison break will have you jolting out of your seat.
1606;This movie is an intense study of a serial killer and the methods used by the FBI to track him.
1607;Expert direction, acting, and story make this a superb film.
1608;This has got to be the best thriller I have ever seen.
1609;This is also hands down the best movie in the series too.
1610;Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for best actor for this movies and he is in less than 30 minutes, that's how good he is in this role.
1611;Jodie Foster is also really good in this movie as the FBI academy student sent to interview a madman.
1612;I highly reccomend this movie as a great edition to anyone's collection.
1613;I first seen this movie on Starz, and thought that this was a great movie.
1614;Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins gave great performances that were worth the oscars they won that year.
1615;Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lecter was haunting, especially the part where he talks about eating the census taker's liver.
1616;both Foster and Hopkins give outstanding performances.
1617;even the title is clever and has much to do with the scope the movie follows.
1618;With excellent directing, writing, and acting.
1619;jodie Foster plays a great role and should have won the academy award.
1620;Hope they do a good job with Hannibal.
1621;A masterfully told suspense/thriller with a diabolical twist ending, this is the movie that made cannibals cool and reinvented the careers of both Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins.
1622;Edge enhancement, shimmering and aliasing are nonexistant.
1623;The audio has been remixed to 5.1 and is incredibly stirring, especially in its music tracks.
1624;it is Anthony Hopkins, one of the best thespians alive, what more can I say that hasn't been said by other reviewers.
1625;One of the marks of a great film is if you can come back periodically and it still speaks to you on a visceral level.
1626;a five star production and top notch acting by some of the great thespians of our time.
1627;Hannibal starts to play games with Starling, ever eager to impress her boss, by giving her a psychological profile of herself in return for more information about the case.
1628;essentially it is smart horror movie with lots of dialogue, plot and suspense.
1629;"Demme often uses the camera directly with the actor looking at you to make the movie more ""personal"" in nature."
1630;This is the film that set new benchmarks in the modern horror/suspense/thriller genres.
1631;She has hesitant at first and then ended up liking it.
1632;Silence of the Lambs is one of my favorites.
1633;This movie is simply a Horror classic and should be viewed by any and all interested in horror movies.
1634;In doing this, she hopes that he will provide both valuable information regarding his whereabouts and insight on how a serial killer thinks.
1635;This adds to the stress, and Lecktor reaches into Clarice Starling's haunted memories.
1636;a riveting and disturbing psychological thriller that succeeds in most departments.
1637;Jodie Foster's character does take a little while to get comfortable with, but her portrayal as a haunted woman is always compelling and unforgettable.
1638;It is Anthony Hopkins that delivers the most with his cannibalistic and thought.
1639;"See it!Overall rating: 4.8 stars (rounded to 5)If you like this film, I would also recommend ""Se7en""."
1640;Anthony Hopkins is brilliant in his role as Dr. Hannibal the cannibal Lecter, the psychotic serial killer with a serious appetite.
1641;Even Nightmare on Elm Street or Scream is more entertaining.
1642;The movie is WAY better than the book.
1643;One of my favorite Jodie Foster movies.
1644;Love this movie and have rewatched it many, many times.
1645;The acting, plot, and great ending is the best ever.
1646;Great job by Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal) and Jodie Foster (Clarice).
1647;"I'm still one of the believers that ""SE7EN"" is a much superior movie."
1648;I am sure the acting was wonderful, the stars at their best, but I would have been happier never having seen this movie.
1649;the acting is phenomenal, the plot is fast moving, the direction is first rate, and the musical score is downright scary.
1650;All of these elements come together to form a picture that is one of only a handful of movies to win all 5 top categories at the Oscars (Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director, and Screenplay).
1651;Awesome movie and awesome acting.
1652;It is rare to get such a great combination and when you do you must be able to capture it.
1653;And the setting they got Hannibal Lecter in perfectly draws you into his insane world.
1654;This newest widescreen release is outstanding, the movie being very clean, crisp with excellent audio.
1655;"With this movie being a ""classic"", this edition of it is the way to go!"
1656;It was an awesome movie with great acting by all actors.
1657;This one is a classic and it stills scares me.
1658;One of the best thrillers ever.
1659;Foster/Hopkins make an incredible duo.
1660;The film relies in script and acting.
1661;This movie is about a psychiatrist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, with a profound love for people.
1662;Many of Dr. Lecter's guests contribute to the preparation of the entr es.
1663;the movie is very original and meets its criteria as a thriller.
1664;The Academy holds this movie up as a high.
1665;I watch it on my kindle fire 1st gen the picture was Great and the sound was good.
1666;I am pleased with the number of movies that amazon has to choose from.
1667;I will keep on using amazon prime.
1668;First of all, Silence of the Lambs is a great film by Jonathan Demme.
1669;I know that their is grain in this film and I don't have a problem with that.
1670;I would still recommend this Blu.
1671;Travel into the world of Clarise Starling, a smart and attractive FBI trainee who is eagerly waiting for her graduation so she can become an agant for the Behavioral Science section of the FBI.
1672;This is my favorite movie, and everything about it is absolutley amazing!
1673;Jodie Foster's award winning performance is stunning, as it that of Anthony Hopkins, who is more than terrifying.
1674;It's a classic movie in my book.
1675;but is it REALLY escape.
1676;establishes an unusual connestion with FBI agent Clarice Starling.
1677;impecable performances by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster playing the leads.
1678;My favorite movie of all time.
1679;I like the movie better.
1680;The interviews with Foster Hopkins (plus a whole bunch of deleted scenes) really enhanced what I consider the best suspense/thriller ever made.
1681;In doing so, she actually proved to be as smart as Claridge Starling herself.
1682;So Hollywood lost the second battle but still won the war: Silence of the Lambs remains the best.
1683;This film has acquired classic status on the thriller / horror genre.
1684;It touched on things that were way too real for me.
1685;balanced, and I felt I should clarify some of my thoughts on this movie.
1686;I found the movie overwhelmingly dark and heavy.
1687;If you love horror movies, especially ones that are realistic and psychologically terrifying, you should totally check this movie out!
1688;I felt this way watching the movie because he is portrayed as being this extremely intelligent individual who somehow possesses superhuman strength and the ability to remain a few steps ahead of every other character at all times.
1689;In other words, he is completely unmatched in skill, ability, and strength.
1690;I got exactly what I wanted.
1691;The delivery was exceptionally fast.
1692;I will do that for one simple reason.
1693;his movie has a plot and it's a good one.
1694;Dr. Hannibal Lector is certainly a villain worth remembering.
1695;Both the fava beans and the chianti shipped fast, and I will definitely order again.
1696;This is a movie classic!
1697;After reading the wonderful book, I decided to watch this thriller again.
1698;This is one of very few movies that follow a book pretty well.
1699;Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins do a great job and really draw you into the movie.
1700;i am very happy with the outcome of this classic thriller and recommend it to any fan of mystery thrillers.
1701;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
1702;Mr. Hopkins and Ms. Foster create a dramatic tension as the brilliant but deranged Lecter psychoanalyzes Clarice.
1703;Ms. Foster's facial reactions to Lecter's analysis convey so much more than words.
1704;The movie is a psychological thriller that provides chills, tension and scares you while avoiding tired cliches.
1705;Director Jonathan Demme strikes all right notes and the filming of the closing scene in Buffalo Bill's basement is superbly filmed.
1706;The Silence of the Lambs became just the third movie in history to win Best Picture, Best Actor (Mr. Hopkins), Best Actress (Ms. Foster), Best Director and Best Screenplay in the same year.
1707;As gruesome as it is, this is a classic from start to finish!
1708;When two veterans of the silver screen like Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jody Foster are combined with one well conceived narrative, the result is a masterpiece.
1709;Jodie Foster, Scott Glenn and of course Anthony Hopkins, all played their parts brilliantly.
1710;This was a excellent suspense movie.
1711;"This is unquestionably one of the scariest movies ever made
I:8404;1712;written, masterfully directed and photographed, tense psychological thriller with Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both turning in Oscar.
I:8404;1713;winning performances of a lifetime.
I:8404;1714;(Hopkins's portrayal of the unimaginably brilliant but unspeakably evil Dr. Hannibal Lecter is arguably one of the most memorable performances in film history).
I:8404;1715;Disturbing, frightening, and ultimately, brilliant.
I:8404;1716;The Criterion Collection of The Silence of the Lambs is the best transfer of this movie yet.
I:8404;1717;seat movie with wonderful performances by the cast.
I:8404;1718;Silence of the lambs is truly a remarkable achievement.
I:8404;1719;It is interesting to note that Silence of the lambs is probably the best remake of any film ever made.
I:8404;1720;In the early 80's Michael Mann directed the original based on the same novel.
I:8404;1721;Mann's film was really very good, and the villian of that one was not Hannibal Lector though the character appears in the film.
I:8404;1722;And again it was a much better film than the boxoffice receipts really indicated.
I:8404;1723;Silence of the Lambs still proved to be a much better film, so that is saying a lot.
I:8404;1724;Of course Sir Anthony Hopkins created a truly terrifying character in Lecter, and it won him a much deserved best actor oscar.
I:8404;1725;Hopkins is truly astonishing playing Lector.
I:8404;1726;Jonathan Demme directs this film with heart pounding realism and a slick pace.
I:8404;1727;Ted Levine is in top form as the killer on the loose.
I:8404;1728;Interesting as well is how Levine managed to break free of of being type cast after this movie.
I:8404;1729;In this version of the book Starling must follow the trail of the killer with the help of Lector and her superior played by Scott Glen.
I:8404;1730;Foster also delivers an academy award winning performance, and Silence of the lambs remains one of the greatest thrillers ever made.
I:8404;1731;can you see what hannible has for her in his own mind?
I:8404;1732;but this movie is awesome.
I:8404;1733;anthony hopkins deserves much credit for playing this man, he is definatly worth watching.
I:8404;1734;Anthony Hopkins performance was outstanding and frightening.
I:8404;1735;One of the most gripping movies i have seen.
I:8404;1736;I wanted to watch it for educational purposes as i learnt that this movie is considered in the top 10 best screenplays in Hollywood!!!
I:8404;1737;Jodie was as good as she always been.
I:8404;1738;all of which are hugely successful.
I:8404;1739;Take a survey of your friends/peers and see how many people were NOT happy that Lecter escapes at the film's end, with the implication that he will exact revenge on one of his smarmy captors.
I:8404;1740;I am excited to receive it.
I:8404;1741;One of my all time favorite movies.
I:8404;1742;If you are a serious movie lover, you must see this movie.
I:8404;1743;There are so many great scenes and memorable dialog.
I:8404;1744;Like all good thrillers, there are twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:8404;1745;This character is going to have to convince the audience that he possesses not only a brilliant mind but also a powerful physique.
I:8404;1746;By now I'm hoping that Scott Glenn will show up more often so I can have someone whose role I can accept.
I:8404;1747;There was some interesting psychological dialogue and some scenes that were very well done.
I:8404;1748;Jonathan Demme's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is simply put, one of the scariest movies of all time.
I:8404;1749;notch acting, suspenseful moments, disturbing themes, the horrific subject matter of serial killers.
I:8404;1750;A surprise hit at the box office, Jonathan Demme's psycological thriller is as good as a horror film can get!
I:8404;1751;In this climate, Silence was like a breath of fresh air to thriller fans looking for something with a little more substance.
I:8404;1752;Most of the horror is created by the uncertainty and suspense in the plot, as well as some mighty fine acting(Anthony Hopkins take a bow).
I:8404;1753;The films' daring turns and twists continue all the way to its climax when the FBI agent (Jodie Foster) and the wanted serial killer (Ted Levine) meet face to face almost by pure chance!
I:8404;1754;Well, I wont go on with all the details and spoil it for you, so I just say this: If you like suspence.
I:8404;1755;It is one of the best of all.
I:8404;1756;(If it's the former, I want to return it for a full refund!)
I:8404;1757;Superior performances and the story line is just so scary.
I:8404;1758;The movie was well done, and the acting was very good.
I:8404;1759;I give it a solid 3 stars, which is to say above average, but it must have been an off year for the film industry if this was the best thing they turned out that year.
I:8404;1760;anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors, but I don't think this is a role that only he could play.
I:8404;1761;This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8404;1762;It launched some great careers, has a well thought out script, and is gripping til the end.
I:8404;1763;This is one of my favorite films.
I:8404;1764;Jonathan Demme did a brilliant job with this film.
I:8404;1765;He tied all the elements of a good script and made it into a great film.
I:8404;1766;The acting by Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins is outstanding and they were perfectly cast.
I:8404;1767;Clarice takes the information and investigates each of them thoroughly.
I:8404;1768;I like how they made her female character so strong.
I:8404;1769;This is when the movie gets really intense.
I:8404;1770;Clarice is brilliant by putting the pieces of the puzzle slowly together.
I:8404;1771;Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both won an oscar for this highy acclaimed movie in 1991 for Best Actor and Best Actress.
I:8404;1772;Jonathen Demme also won for best director and the movie won best picture.
I:8404;1773;I also recommend the book by Thomas Harris because it is as good as the movie.
I:8404;1774;Overall I highly recommend this movie and it delivers everything we are afraid excists out there unbeknowsed to us.
I:8404;1775;First time I've dared to watch this movie since it came out!
I:8404;1776;Great story, will watch the next in the series.
I:8404;1777;The source material by Thomas Harris draws so much from actual events( the M. o.'s of several infamous serial killers and the interviews with Ted Bundy regarding the green river killer) to make a very believable and engaging fiction that translates so well to the screen that The Silence of the Lambs remains watchable after multiple viewings.
I:8404;1778;A great movie all around.
I:8404;1779;i just watched the 2 disc collectors edition a couple days back and loved it so when I spotted this in the store today I snapped it up.
I:8404;1780;rAY and its one of my favorite movies.
I:8404;1781;Much of this will no doubt be due to the available light photography for the film which doesn't upgrade well.
I:8404;1782;This Movie has been around awhile, still chilling and keeps you in your seat, especially the basement scene and the elevator ride
I:8404;1783;Great movie, if you enjoy Hopkins check out Meet Joe Black not the same kind of movie but also very good
I:8404;1784;There's really no question as to why this movie got an Academy Award, the acting, scripting, and photography are all first.
I:8404;1785;I can't really imagine anyone else portraying Hannibal Lecter OTHER than Anthony Hopkins, he really portrays that character so very well and really has that subtle scary side showing through enough to terrify viewers.
I:8404;1786;Jodi Foster, does another good job at her role, and certainly should be applauded for her role in this very thrilling episode in another film made from a Thomas Harris novel.
I:8404;1787;i remember this and all of Thomas Harris' books and the movies do a very good job at presenting his thrillers, this one is no exception!
I:8404;1788;The movie is a great story and the acting is incredible.
I:8404;1789;Foster and Hopkins deserved the Oscars they won with this film.
I:8404;1790;The service is easy to use and reliableThe film is brilliant, interesting and makes one think.
I:8404;1791;are being barked out, is the best set up I've seen as an introduction to the """"villian."""""""
1792;what I received was the coolest, smartest, most interesting psycho that Jonathan Demme and Anthony Hopkins created for film.
1793;a brilliant film, capturing the five major Academy Awards for it's year(1991).
1794;This film is a modern classic.
1795;I'm a huge fan of Special Features.
1796;Widescreen and the ability to watch a movie in French don't cut it.
1797;Having been a longtime admirer of Thomas Harris' first psych.
1798;Yet, this is precisely what Silence of the Lambs does with Foster's character, Clarice Starling.
1799;Anyways, Silence of the Lambs will always be an overrated film, and just lambchops within this movie genre.
1800;The movie was so suspenceful it had us on the edge of our seats!
1801;This is one of the best films I have ever seen.
1802;Clarice draws the viewer in with sympathy that you feel with a young, beautiful and ambitious youth.
1803;She is going to make a career and will let nothing stand in her way.
1804;It is here, while investigating the crime and his mind, that she exposes some of the psychological roots of her passion to succeed in law enforcement.
1805;This is beautifully done and completely believable.
1806;Of course, there is a suspenseful ending and some graphic violence as well as a bunch of surprises.
1807;It is a true masterpiece of detail and plot and theme.
1808;I have a regular 36 TV and watching this movie on VHS blurrs some details.
1809;The documentary, entitled Inside the Labyrinth was about 1 hr 10 min long, and was incredibly interesting and well put together.
1810;"It was surprizing to find all the incredible behind the scenes talent who worked on this movie
I:8404;1811;Exceptional documentary on an exceptional movie.
I:8404;1812;After a decade, it retains its strengths in terms directing, acting, and production values.
I:8404;1813;Jody Foster received an Academy Award for her performance as did Hopkins and director Jonathan Demme.
I:8404;1814;I now have a much better appreciation of the evolving relationship between Lecter and Starling, and a much better understanding of childhood influences on her values and especially her vulnerabilities.
I:8404;1815;Also, I now have a greater appreciation of the performances of others, notably Ted Levine (Jame """"Buffalo Bill"""" Gumb)."""
1816;During the final confrontation, he more than holds his own with the highly talented Foster.
1817;Portraying her supervisor, Scott Glenn appears only briefly but makes a critically important contribution to Starling's development, both personally and professionally.
1818;Whenever I heard a reference to the film or to Lecter, that is what immediately came to mind.
1819;Anything with Jodie Foster in it is a very good film.
1820;This movie is suspenseful and also a who.
1821;Great Acting, andall round great Movie which certainly deserves *5* stars.
1822;maybe the most intense ,edge of your seat lkiller movie, but without ridiculous blood baths.
1823;One of the best of all time.
1824;wild Bill dancing in the flesh suite gets me every time.
1825;In this film Anthony Hopkins turns in one of the great villainous performances and quite literally scares the pants off most of us.
1826;This is a jarring, scary, and even upsetting film, but it is also a fabulous and powerful viewing experience that should not be passed up.
1827;high IQ who has finally been captured by the FBI.
1828;Jodie Foster turns in a very fine performance as Agent Starling, an FBI trainee who is detailed to do some background research on Lecter.
1829;a great film to remind us just who Hannibal Lector is.
1830;Awesome performance, screenplay and direction.
1831;a tight, taunt, deliciously acted movie, The Silence of the Lambs is a real thrill to watch.
1832;beautifully acted, this movie made Sir Anthony Hopkins a star and Jodie Foster, in my opinion, a Hollywood legend.
1833;the closing scenes of which we see through the killers' goggle aided eyes were heart wrenching.
1834;OK, do movies get any more compelling than this one .
1835;which features superlative performances from virtually every bit player .
1836;I thought that Demme's direction of this film was masterful, and gave you a exciting tour.
1837;force into the complexity and intrigue of forensic detective work, while never letting go of the many jumps, thrills and twists.
1838;"Anthony Hopkins, whose Hannibal Lecter has become a mainstay of popular culture, is seductive and mesmerizing
I:8404;1839;up scenes between him and Jodie Foster are electrifyingly real and yet still have that big.
I:8404;1840;Jodie Foster shines in a role that she was born to play: a loner, a person with intense psychological scars, a young woman who wants and desperately needs respect and validation.
I:8404;1841;I just loved this movie, and have seen it several times.
I:8404;1842;By the way, Scott Glenn is wonderfully sparse in a role that could have been showy.
I:8404;1843;Aside from winning 5 academy awards (well deserved, this movie is also sure to win support from the average viewer as well.
I:8404;1844;It is an intelligent thriller, for people who dont need tons of constant violence (though there are violent scenes.
I:8404;1845;It relies on subtle and psychological terror to give it impact.
I:8404;1846;it is a rare treat among all the overly gorey and violent movies with little plot of today.
I:8404;1847;It is the sophisticated man's movie.
I:8404;1848;Well after a two year delay """"The Silence of the Lambs"""" has finally made it to blu ray."""
1849;This is one of the best movies to be released during the last twenty years.
1850;Also, the special features on the Criterion release are far more satisfying than what is presented here.
1851;The Silence of the Lambs is a great movie in almost every way.
1852;released on blu ray with a much richer transfer.
1853;When I first saw Silence of the Lambs (and subsequently throughout the years since it's release), I was amazed at how smartly this film was put together.
1854;Good thrillers know when to keep us waiting and when to pounce and go for the jugular, and like Hannibal Lecter, Silence knows when it's the right time to do it.
1855;One of Jodie Fosters greatest films.
1856;Great find and great price.
1857;The Silence of the Lambs is the first Horror movie to win the Best Picture Academy Award.
1858;While that distinction rightfully belonged to The Exorcist us Horror fans take what we can get.
1859;Certainly the Horror genre didn't need (and still doesn't) an award to validate its importance to film, but an honor is an honor so I'll leave it at that.
1860;There is nothing more disconcerting, yet fascinating to the American public than the act of murder.
1861;That's right, Americans are fans of murder.
1862;many serial killers have achieved celebrity status.
1863;Hannibal Lecter, although a fictional construct, ranks among them.
1864;Anthony Hopkins unsettling and convincing portrayal of the cannibal doctor is perhaps one of the most talked about film perfomances of all time.
1865;somehow Hollywood recognized a superior monster story and awarded it accordingly.
1866;the Silence of the Lambs captured the imagination and attention of American moviegoers like few Horror films have.
1867;This is a classic pycho horror flick that any horror enthusiast must have in their collection.
1868;Great movie, and a really nice set.
1869;At either price, it's totally worth it.
1870;The special features on the second disc are very well done, and of course the film is!
1871;This movie contains two fo the greatest performances in the history of cinema, that of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter and Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling.
1872;this movie is so good it's almost overwhelming.
1873;Jonathan Demme put together an amazing piece of film.
1874;One of my all time favorites.
1875;The suspense throughout the movie makes it an instant classic.
1876;This film is probably the greatest thriller movie of all time.
1877;The movie is chilling, disturbing, deep, and dramatic.
1878;Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest pairings since Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh, they truely have wonderful chemistry.
1879;Hannibal Lector is one of the greatest screen characters of all time and definately the greatest villain.
1880;Jonathon Demme is truely a talented director.
1881;This is one of my favorite films of all time.
1882;I highly reccomend this movie to anyone, and everyone to see.
1883;The Silence of the Lambs was one of the greatest films ever made.
1884;The thing that is so great about it is that it lives up to the wonderful novel by Thomas Harris.
1885;This gives Clarice a big name for herself.
1886;i won't give away anymore information involving the plot of this wonderful film.
1887;This movie has a great cast of characters and a wonderful story that only Thomas Harris would be able to come up with.
1888;Go ahead and see this movie, but I reccomend that you read the novel first!Happy Viewing!
1889;Amazing and worth the wait!Hopkins, Jodie and the music are phenomenal!
1890;Extras and sound are good.
1891;Great film and now one of the classics.
1892;Stellar performers by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster!
1893;Great actors, we love this movie and watch it often!
1894;Anthony Hopkins is superb and Jodie Foster is spell binding.
1895;ray I thought I would give it a try.
1896;One of the greatest horror movies of all time.
1897;Even though it is not a horror movie per se, it is more chilling, haunting and emotionally unsettling that any horror movie I have seen(including Saw 1,2 and 3, Land of the Dead and (in my opinion)Night of the Living Dead).
1898;A true masterpiece of suspense.
1899;A chilling movie with a haunting atmosphere.
1900;One of Anthony Hopkins finest works.
1901;It is one of my favorite psychological thrillers.
1902;Silence of the Lambs has at its heart a strange relationship between two fascinating characters.
1903;There's Clarice Starling, who is vulnerable and inexperienced, but also clever, strong.
1904;And then there's Hannibal Lecter, the brilliant, elegant, and witty ex.
1905;anthony Hopkins delivers a performance that will at once make you shiver and laugh.
1906;"He embodies a figure who is elegant, depraved, and fascinating
I:8404;1907;Jodie Foster's performance is also wonderful .
I:8404;1908;tenacious, honest, brave even as she visibly copes with fear.
I:8404;1909;Lecter wishing to learn a piece of personal information about Clarice for each piece of information he chooses to share about the serial killer.
I:8404;1910;Silence of the Lambs is wonderful in that it rises above gore"
1911;The minor characters are sharply drawn, while Lecter and Starling are compelling and complex.
1912;One of my favorite films, Jodie Foster is great in this film.
1913;Ted Levine does a wonderful job as a serial killer.
1914;This is a fantastic film which was ahead of it's time.
1915;It reminds me of some Hitchcock films in the way that the suspense builds.
1916;its a thrilling mystery with lots of twists.
1917;a great story and wonderful acting.
1918;Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are perfect together.
1919;The music is haunting and so are the locations and backgrounds.
1920;The end of the film will have you on the edge of your seat.
1921;I highly recomend this to any thriller fan!
1922;that is a scary thought!
1923;One that is always lingering in our minds even if we do not let it surface.
1924;the acting was excellent, the story line chilling and the conclusion outstanding!
1925;A great nail bitting movie right to the end!
1926;The Silence of the Lambs is a classic psychological thriller that is haunting, eerie, and intelligent.
1927;It really makes you think.
1928;He relishes in playing his memorable crazy yet softspoken British villain.
1929;Jodie Foster is brilliant as Agent Starling, and the rest of the cast is marvelous too.
1930;I especially enjoyed the scenes with Hannibal and Claric Starling.
1931;There is a chemistry between Hopkins and Foster, and they are perfect together on screen.
1932;I liked the scene where Hannibal escapes.
1933;The whole film has this essence of evil and gloom that makes it all the more memorable.
1934;One of my favorite movies!
1935;Anthony Hopkins is a perfect Hannibal Lecter!
1936;I enjoy this movie every time I watch it.
1937;Very interesting characters and it is very well acted.
1938;Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
1939;It is no wonder why he and Jodie Foster are both Oscar winners, for she gives an outstanding performance as Clarice Starling.
1940;Winner of 5 Academy Awards, this movie will always remain a true classic in every way.
1941;Hopkins is mezmorizing in his role.
1942;A non stop thriller with twists and turns that keep you glued to this movie.
1943;Hats off to Jonathan Demme for giving us a masterpiece than no one will ever forget!!
1944;But just watching the characters just makes me awe inspired.
1945;Jodie Foster deserves a second Oscar for her performance as FBI agent Clarise Starring.
1946;But it's a thrilling ride!!
1947;It's always been my favorite part.
1948;I love Jodie Foster, and she does such an awesome job with her roll as a young FBI agent in training.
1949;This particular part movie in the trilogy, keeps you on the edge of your seat, no matter how many times you watch it
1950;Great film with an awesome twist, which is exactly what horror lovers want to see.
1951;Jodie Foster's superb acting is what made this film rock.
1952;With most horror films, once they've been seen and the twist exposed they are no longer fun.
1953;But due to Foster's excellent acting skills as FBI agent Starling, this is a film that I will watch time and again.
1954;There was a lot of magnetic attraction between the two characters that added to the overall anticipation of the outcome.
1955;This is a very good film I think everyone's basically seen it.
1956;Whether or not it deserved to sweep the oscars who knows and I honestly don't really care.
1957;It was definitely one of the best films of that year and probably one of the best thrillers of the 90's.
1958;The movie completely relies on them and it works.
1959;Hannibal's escape scene, while very exciting, would never happen.
1960;If you're able to look past some of these things you will really like this movie.
1961;favorite movie, happy with product.
1962;could have gotten to my home a little faster, but no worries, i'm happy with it.
1963;The interplay between Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins is what makes this a memorable film.
1964;The subtle nuances of Hopkins performance are terrific.
1965;Hopkins' ability to project madness in his quiet understated way was brilliant (aided by the directors tight closeups of his glowering face) Jodie Foster, talented and beautiful as always was the perfect foil.
1966;Great Movie, watch it at least once or twice a year.
1967;Hannibal is pure, facinating evil!!
1968;Why not?The verdict: it has become one of my favorite movies.
1969;"It is not often one comes across a ""perfect"" film."
1970;anthony Hopkins is an inspiration.
1971;When given good dialogue, as he is here, he sparkles on the screen and pulls it off with such simplicity that you're left wondering if the old guy isn't playing you for a fool.
1972;scoring the Silence (SD .
1973;First the commentary is very good.
1974;It's rare for a film to win Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay Oscars, but The Silence of the Lambs did just that.
1975;lecter is intelligent, polite and eloquent.
1976;Although he's a monster capable of eating people, he has a twisted sense of honor.
1977;It's clear that he likes Starling and he rewards some of her honest revelations with help and insight into how she might track down serial killer, Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine).
1978;it's curious that the movie is often placed in the horror genre.
1979;I watched David Fincher's version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo recently, and compared the two films.
1980;Each includes a colorful character, although one is a hero and the other a villain.
1981;the movie works because we love how monstrous Lecter is and how human Starling can be.
1982;Foster's performance made Starling seem incredibly vulnerable.
1983;She's a young cadet finding her way in the FBI and this is her first big break.
1984;Then we see that she has to contend with Lecter, who is ruthlessly insightful and able to read her easily.
1985;Much of the story is seen from Starling's point of view and it's easy to identify with her fears as she tries to catch the killer.
1986;the final showdown is extremely effective.
1987;The song playing during this sequence (Hip Priest, by The Fall) holds special meaning for me as it was played at the first concert I ever attended.
1988;scott Glenn can be very likable and I enjoyed his performance as Crawford.
1989;The movie drew considerable praise from the FBI for it's realism and it was easy to imagine Glenn as a member of the organization.
1990;hopkins is a versatile actor capable of playing just about any role.
1991;I would rank him among the top tier of my favorite actors.
1992;Maybe it's because of the characters he plays, but he strikes me as a very intelligent man.
1993;the Silence of the Lambs is constructed simply, but the acting and the ominous mood elevate it to the level of greatness.
1994;One of the best movies in years.5 star entertainment.
1995;the acting was great and I enjoyed the sets.
1996;jody Forster is the best.
1997;This is by far my favorite movie.
1998;Anyway, the acting was superb, very interesting, yet sometimes gruesome, story, and all around fantastic movie.
1999;"Particularly that incredible line this movie is famous for when Jodie says ""He said he could smell my c**t."" Maybe they were laughing at it all."
2000;Jodie is a very talented actress and Anthony Hopkins one of the very best there is but I wonder what was going on in her mind as she said that obnoxious line in the movie.
2001;then please, please give it to her.
2002;Yeah, that's what they did.
2003;movie fervor and zeal is probably a success story for marketing.
2004;The super cast (Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster), the attractive movie poster and all the hype lead it all the way up to the Oscars where it netted the coveted ones, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture.
2005;both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie won oscars for their roles but if you really want to see their true potential check out The Bounty for Anthony Hopkins and Contact, Flight Plan for Jodie to just name a few of the many good movies where Jodie and Anthony had more meaningful and purposeful roles.
2006;Despite my father's best efforts to keep me from seeing it when it released, I still got my chance and I still love this movie like no other in my collection.
2007;I've always been fascinated with serial killers and this movie fueled my fascination even further.
2008;It's timeless and amazing and it's worth it just for Hopkins' performance alone.
2009;Red Dragon and Hannibal were interesting and fun as well, but they have nothing on Silence of the Lambs.
2010;It will always stay in my top 10 favorites.
2011;"The best selling book ""Silence of the Lambs"", turned movie."
2012;Unexpected twists and turns will keep you on the edge of your seat.
2013;Hopkins, a psychiatrist turned cannibal, toys with Foster and leaves you with the distinct impression that he believes himself to be far superior in intellect.
2014;It is clear in particularly the scene where he escapes from his cell and has a small feast, in the form of one of his jailors face, before he actually gets away.
2015;Anthony Hopkins is an amazing actor and he doesn't disappoint here.
2016;Jodie Foster is equally as impressive.
2017;The movie is scary, but while I can't sit through horror movies, this kind of suspense is awesome!
2018;This marks the third time I've seen this movie, and again, it's terrifying as we enter the mind of two killers.
2019;Hannibal Lecter, brilliant psychoanalyst, is able to help Agent Clarice Starling, a young woman haunted by an incident in her earlier life.
2020;Jody Foster is marvelous as Clarice.
2021;Antony Hopkins certainly deserved the Academy Award for his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter.
2022;There was also a fine supporting cast.
2023;With RedBox these days I'm hesitant to spend more than $1 but it was worth it.
2024;This is a classic with great actors.
2025;The plot is intriguing and filled with suspense.
2026;I will watch this again for the 10th time!!
2027;I love this movie, always have.
2028;The acting is superb and it's wonderfully creepy.
2029;What an excellent price for a blu ray.
2030;Spookie and scary with some gore but well worth a watch!
2031;great thriller and great story.
2032;Gross at times, bloody at times but a good story.
2033;If you wish to dive into the mind of serial killers this is an interesting place to start.
2034;The story line is great.
2035;This is an interesting film and is better seen on the release by Criterion which this review is for.
2036;The film is very well known and I find it unecessary to include plot information here so instead I will talk review the Criterion features.
2037;People to this day admit to loving the film and expressing the fact that it is one of their favorite motion pictures.
2038;the film is graphic, horrifying, but amazingly perfect.
2039;The script, acting, and the superb direction would all lead the film to sweep the Oscars in 1991, winning the top four major awards that year.
2040;It won acting accolades for its two stars, Jodie Foster and Anthony Perkins, and the movie won for direction, and rare for a horror film, it won Best Picture.
2041;the film transfer is impeccable, and the sound excellent.
2042;A wonderful edition to any film library.
2043;It's a great suspense thriller but it is also a great character study.
2044;Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling remain to be two of the best and fascinating characters in movie history.
2045;the movie was elegant and quiet.
2046;The pacing was pitch perfect.
2047;You've got to see the clever intercutting scenes towards the end of the movie as Clarice and the FBI agents separately hunt for Buffalo Bill.
2048;It was brilliantly shot and edited.
2049;And of course the extended ending was a classic.
2050;All of their scenes together are electrifying especially their first meeting.
2051;As much as I love Foster, it would be interesting how the sexual tension would've played out (since Pfeiffer is far more sensual and sexy)Grade: A
2052;one who appreciates fine acting can view the tet.
2053;a. tet exchanges between Dr. Hannibal Lecter and FBI Agent Clarice Starling without at least one shiver of delight.
2054;I'm very glad she was awarded an Oscar, especially since the Academy seems so shy of awarding mulitiple statuettes to the same actor, regardless of how superior their work is.
2055;I must advise you, instead, to go for the widescreen special edition, and grab the Criterion while you're at it.
2056;"every so playfully, ""Closer, please!"""
2057;Had an exciting story line.
2058;"It contains a lot of those ""while we make it, this is what we thought"" kind of documentaries."
2059;Much more fun than your typical audio commentary features.
2060;Of the 3 versions I've seen, the VHS tape is the best value for money.
2061;"rivaling ""Seven"" as the best thriller of the decade, ""Silence of the Lambs"" is the quintessential blockbuster thriller, driven by marvelous performances, a polished, intelligent adaptation from the best."

2066;As Clarice learns more and more about the anomalous killer from the horrific Lecter, she also has to confront her own inner demons in order to save future victims.

2069;Foster is truly brilliant, showing true performing range as a mixture of woman determinism and psychological sprite in search of internal peace.

2072;point and meticulously designed to pay homage to the exceptional novel, capturing the essence of the troubled young FBI agent and the sexual perplexity of our film's main antagonist.
2073;One of the finest of its kind.
2074;After sucking up all of the main oscars ten years ago, this movie is still superb, even by 21st century standards.
2075;This movie features superb acting by everyone, great directing and acting.
2076;Anyway, in summary, this movie is excellent.
2077;Maybe you should watch it with fava beans in your right hand and a nice chianti in your left
2078;This movie is brilliant, great and deserves every compliment it recieves.
2079;Hannibal Lector is the most terrifying movie character of all time because he is not only a cannibal and ruthless killer, but he is also a brilliant man.
2080;Jodie Foster is incredible in this movie as she is in countless others.
2081;well maybe you wont want to eat because of the topic.
2082;but what ever you do it is a classic and you will love it on the edge of your seat.
2083;This is a film full of atmosphere.
2084;In thirty minute of screentime, Hopkins manages to make your skin crawl.
2085;Foster does a great job as troubled FBI agent Clarice Starling.
2086;She makes a strong counterpoint to Lector.
2087;The film gets gruesome, but it is a clever and chilling.
2088;first the commentary is very good.
2089;the kind that you would watch when you are bored and know this will keep you entertained for hour and a half
2090;One of the best movies ever.
2091;**Clarice Starling works very hard and is regarded as an exceptional student at the FBI Academy.
2092;Jack Crawford, her mentor and teacher, enlists her help to present a questionnaire to Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant but deranged psychologist infamous for cannibalism, manipulation, and murder.
2093;This marks the start of their odd relationship where he provides information and insight in return for details on her personal life.
2094;Clarice will face her own personal demons as well as a deranged killer before she has even become a full fledged FBI agent.
2095;She's focused, dedicated, and strong, but many around her don't see her this way.
2096;She is very often surrounded by tall, imposing men when doing anything in relation to the FBI (at the academy, at the autopsy, etc.).
2097;The cinematography of these scenes gives the viewer Clarice's point of view and, in comparison, she seems small and meek, perhaps unsuited for the job frequently associated with strength and masculinity.
2098;clarice proves to be a strong, formidable woman, even to those who doubted her, by never backing down in the face of opposition.
2099;She succeeds where Dr. Chilton had failed for years in forming a connection with Hannibal Lecter and gaining his trust.
2100;This scene is one of my favorites because of what it shows about Clarice.
2101;Jodie Foster portrayed Clarice wonderfully with a perfect balance of toughness and vulnerability.
2102;so many aspects of this film came together to make it exceptional.
2103;Anthony Hopkins is excellent as Hannibal Lecter with his trademark intense, unblinking stare.
2104;the Silence of the Lambs is an excellent film.
2105;I can watch it with fresh eyes and discover something new about it even after I have seen it many times over the years.
2106;It's one of those special films that transcends its time period.
2107;Sure, there are cues all over the place (clothes, phones, hair styles, etc.), but they are incidental in the face of the intensely interesting characters and the chilling plot based in reality.
2108;The best film of the 90s, and my favorite film of all.
2109;time, The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece, pure and simple.
2110;She ends up earning trust in Hannibal and he does to her what he does best: gets into her mind.
2111;hannibal helped Clarice in finding Hannibal while still driving her to the brink of insanity with his eagerness to know about her troubled past.
2112;Both stars won Best Actress and Best Actor respectively, while the film's director and the film itself also won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture respectively.
2113;This movie will stay in my fourteen year old mind for a while and most who see it face the same dilemna.
2114;I have alot of respect for what the FBI has to go through to track serial killers.
2115;This movie is probably the best in its category.
2116;drama in one, a masterpiece of modern cinema that swept in five Academy Awards including Best Picture.
2117;Let me try to sum up my good thoughts in words.
2118;Jonathan Demme turns this from a masterpiece to a work of art with his outstanding direction and intriguing Point.
2119;"Foster is at her best and portrays the character better than anyone else could try
I:8404;2120;But the true highlight of the film is Anthony Hopkins as polite and genius Dr. Hannibal The Cannibal Lecter"
2121;Make sure you take a bite out of this artful masterpiece!
2122;This is was a just OK film, it definitely did not impress me very much, I don't remember much about it.
2123;Their chemistry made the movie work.
2124;Very good suspense and drama.

2135;until I saw how incredible Jodie Foster was in this film.
2136;She was always in close running with Hopkins, but I must say she has actually surpassed him a bit, in my humble opinion.
2137;The direction here is pitch perfect, the script is exciting, clever and undeniably heart.

I:8404;2162;Silence is a superb adaptation of Thomas Harris' book of the same title.
I:8404;2163;Jonathan Demme directed what is quite possibly the finest serial killer film of all time.

I:8404;2174;The movie is great no doubt about that.
I:8404;2175;It has many extra features such FBI stuff, director's commentary, etc. one of the things that has always bothered me, is a kind of glamorizing of this cannibalistic murderer.

I:8404;2185;The latest edition features a 5.1 remix and a beautiful anamorphic transfer.
I:8404;2186;silence of the lambs is one of my favorites.
I:8404;2187;I have to say that TSTL has the most gripping plot and concentration.
I:8404;2188;While it does a marvellous job of enthralling the audience (to movie thrill.

I:8404;2191;As a proud owner of the Criterion release of Silence of the Lambs, I almost passed on this one.

2204;This is one of my favorite classic horror movies.
2205;Great plot and story line!
2206;Anthony Hopkins is at his best in this thriller about a serial killer who keeps luring the police and FBI off course.
2207;Jodie Foster does an outstanding performance as an FBI special agent who uses Hopkins to catch the serial killer.
2208;I love this movie and I will watch it over and over.
2209;Silence of the Lambs is exactly this type of experience.
2210;this film primarily works because of the Hannibal Lector character.
2211;He's clearly a crazed personality (as evidenced by his cannibalistic tendencies), but at the same time he is utterly brilliant ability to dissect the inner human psyche.
2212;His inner battle of wits with Agent Starling is incredibly interesting material that never gets old no matter how many times it is viewed.
2213;The basic plot involving the Buffalo Bill maniac is chilling (especially the heart.

2224;i agree with the reviewers here.
2225;This film is one of the best thrillers of the 20th century.

2228;silence of the Lambs is very good and gets you hooked and keeps your interest throught the whole film!!!
2229;Very good, I think many newer movies copy the idea from this one with the new technique, like the director very much.
2230;When The Silence of the Lambs took the Academy Awards ceremony by storm in 1992, winning in five major categories (Best Picture, Best Director .

2232;Anthony Hopkins, Best Actress .
2233;Jodie Foster, and Best Adapted Screenplay .
2234;Ted Tally), it beat the odds in more ways than one.
2235;Secondly, it is a dark psychological thriller .
2236;The good doctor offers Clarice a quid pro quo deal.
2237;For every piece of information he shares about Buffalo Bill, Clarice must reveal one detail about her past.
2238;The Silence of the Lambs consistently looks good, builds suspense, and does not outstay its welcome.
