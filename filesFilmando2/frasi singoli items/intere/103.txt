I:8747;1;The six year old viewer likes the idea of flying people.
I:8747;2;The 9 year old liked that the adults grew to be nicer to the children.
I:8747;3;It is great watching my childhood favorites with my kids now.
I:8747;4;mary poppinsis a witch!she came and with the winds,which is very important to witches.
I:8747;5;she uses charms on mr banks.
I:8747;6;she is a wonderful character but a bit too strict at times.
I:8747;7;she uses magic to keep everything fun and inspirational all the way through the movie.
I:8747;8;the music is quite good and witty.
I:8747;9;this is a vaery constuctive film about a whimsical nanny who brings love and contentment back into a home lacking in love.
I:8747;10;it is a classic forever.
I:8747;11;the kids will watch it time and time again.
I:8747;12;anybody can enjoy this one as it is timeless.
I:8747;13;it can make you laugh yourself to stitches,well up with teers,it inspires the imagination .
I:8747;14;i know a few people who think mary poppins is hot.
I:8747;15;julie andrews does quite well in her role,but i think dick van dyke really deserves the star here.
I:8747;16;he was an incredible performer in this movie.
I:8747;17;Mary Poppins is not only one of my favorite Disney movies but also one of my favorite movies period, I think this movie is fantastic and just a real joy to watch, I like it a lot more than Chitty Chitty Bang!
I:8747;18;It is one of the classics that you have to see.
I:8747;19;It was fun to see the early technology where the humans interact with cartoon characters.
I:8747;20;It reminds me of the need to decolonize from European culture.
I:8747;21;On a lighter note, it is a great family film.
I:8747;22;The kids make you want to be a kid no matter how old you are because you want to have as much fun as they're having and their mother is an advocate for women's rights, which is fantastic.
I:8747;23;She's also a great mother/wife and she takes good care of the nannies.
I:8747;24;The soundtrack is also good (except the one at the bank for the reason I mentioned above).
I:8747;25;ray cause I enjoy it so much.
I:8747;26;Bonus features are great and let you see and listen to music only when you only have time for a little Mary:.)
I:8747;27;Long resistant to film adaptations of her Mary Poppins books, P. L. Travers finally succumbed to the entreaties of Walt Disney, and the result is often considered the finest of Disney's personally supervised films.
I:8747;28;The Travers stories are bundled together to tell the story of the Edwardian.
I:8747;29;She immediately endears herself to the children.
I:8747;30;Mr. Banks is pleased that his children are behaving better, but he's not happy with their fantastic stories.
I:8747;31;"Mary Poppins' role in all this leads to some moments when it is possible to fear that all her good work will be undone, but like the magical being she is, all her ""mistakes"" lead to a happy result by the end of the film."
I:8747;32;The 5.1 surround soundmix really puts you right into the scenes of whats going on!!
I:8747;33;The subwoofer really kicks in many times!!
I:8747;34;"And you feel as if you are right there with the fireworks going off every which way when the tune 'Step In Time"" comes to its end!God bless all those who worked on making this 2 disc set so very special!The extras on this 2 disc set are fantastic!!"
I:8747;35;There is so much new footage shown from the time this movie was made, you will see outtakes and some fun being had on the set!This is such a great special edition that anyone who loves this movie will LOVE having this to own!Just wait til you watch these extras, you will NOT be bored at all!
I:8747;36;Mary Poppins is a Walt Disney classic.
I:8747;37;Julie Andrews plays the title role and she won an Oscar for her flawless performance.
I:8747;38;Andrews is pure delight, wish I had a nanny like her as a youngster.
I:8747;39;Dick Van Dyke is a gem as well, great songs and dance numbers.
I:8747;40;Mary Poppins is a family treasure to be enjoyed over and over again.
I:8747;41;Mary Poppins is a truly unforgettable film.
I:8747;42;First is Julie Andrews, who won an Oscar for Best Actress as Mary herself, and who demonstrates supreme self.
I:8747;43;confidence in this her first starring role.
I:8747;44;"The film also won an Oscar for Best Special Effects in 1964
I:8747;45;but it's never been used more effectively than here: that wonderful sequence where Dick Van Dyke dances with a quartet of animated penguins still holds up forty years after it was filmed.
I:8747;46;Unquestionably, however, the film's greatest asset is its musical score by the Sherman brothers and that score is simply a knockout.
I:8747;47;The movie generates such joy and good feeling that these things really win the day.
I:8747;48;"What ""Mary Poppins"" is is wholesome."
I:8747;49;It has a simplicity and an innocence to it that you just don't see in movies nowadays.
I:8747;50;Great music nice story wonderful actors.
I:8747;51;Good to watch before or after you see Saving Mr Bsnks.
I:8747;52;This is a great fun movie.
I:8747;53;Julie Andrews was fun to watch.
I:8747;54;Except for Dick Van Dyke's accent,he was great.
I:8747;55;Watched it right after watching Saving Mr Banks.
I:8747;56;So we knew the story behind it.
I:8747;57;This is also a great children's movie.
I:8747;58;This is a beautiful classic that young children will watch over and over again.
I:8747;59;Highly recommend it for boys and girls 2 years old and up.
I:8747;60;This movie is a classic.
I:8747;61;I remember watching this movie as a kid.
I:8747;62;It is a good wholesome movie and I am glad my kids enjoyed watching it.
I:8747;63;Introducing this film to my kids was amazing .
I:8747;64;roaring good time, and they seemed happy with it.
I:8747;65;Certainly me and my wife appreciated seeing it again.
I:8747;66;This 40th edition of MARY POPPINS is worth it!
I:8747;67;Of course the movie is gloriously restored and stuff and is a must have for anyone who loved the book and the movie.
I:8747;68;the real prize is the second disc that features lots of extras like:***1:32.
I:8747;69;minute = The Red Carpet Premiere from Grauman's Chinese Theater, with text intro explaining the television special of the event.
I:8747;70;Fun look at Hollywood in the swinging 60s with stars and glamour!
I:8747;71;full of magic and adventure.
I:8747;72;Especially if you have little ones, they'd love it too!
I:8747;73;This is a great family movie!
I:8747;74;Everyone has been singing the songs for days!
I:8747;75;Saving Mr. Banks is a great movie to watch after.
I:8747;76;It was in good condition.
I:8747;77;Needed to remember it after seeing it years ago.
I:8747;78;Mary poppins is a classic that warms the heart and entertains the entire family.
I:8747;79;Such a heartwarming film to watch.
I:8747;80;I bought this movie for my 3 year.
I:8747;81;She has now watched it at least 20 times and can sign a lot of the songs.
I:8747;82;It is as much fun for her today as it was for me when I was a child.
I:8747;83;A wonderful way to share a childhood favorite with your children!
I:8747;84;good music and cute storie.
I:8747;85;my grand kid love the songs.
I:8747;86;I enjoyed this many many years ago and seeing it again just reminded me of when I first saw it and brought back all times.
I:8747;87;I have always loved the Mary Poppins movie.
I:8747;88;It's funny, touching, and a great family watch.
I:8747;89;The scenery was beautiful and the songs were fun and catchy!
I:8747;90;I remembered this movie fondly from my childhood and wanted my 4 yr old daughter to see it.
I:8747;91;It's still a very cute movie and she really liked it.
I:8747;92;It's also very British so I found myself having to do some explaining.
I:8747;93;I saw Mary Poppins a long time ago, and I wanted to see it again!
I:8747;94;Me and my 3 year old love this movie.
I:8747;95;I'm so happy I go it on sale and the shipping was faster then I expected.
I:8747;96;This is a timeless movie and one of touching heart.
I:8747;97;The love of family and the need for a dad.
I:8747;98;Walt Disney and his people where so far ahead of their time and had a love for the people.
I:8747;99;This was one of my favorite movies when I was growing up.
I:8747;100;I am so happy to see that my two sons love it as much as I did.
I:8747;101;The whole family now has songs to sing in the car.
I:8747;102;This is a great movie for kids of every age.
I:8747;103;If you are reading this, you already know this is a great movie.
I:8747;104;All I can say is that my whole family enjoyed watching this movie again.
I:8747;105;"I loved this movie when I was a child
I:8747;106;The younger ones really enjoy the singing and the magical aspects of Mary Poppins.
I:8747;107;Of course, the movie is wonderful as well.
I:8747;108;A classic from my childhood that I was anxious to share with my daughter.
I:8747;109;Even better, compared to more modern kids movies, not one crude joke!
I:8747;110;This movie is practically perfect in every way with great acting, signing and some well done animation/live action footage (way before Roger Rabbit hit the scene).
I:8747;111;One of my all time favorite movies, I still love to hum Chim Chimmney a song from a wonderful song and dance scene on the rooftops.
I:8747;112;This is a really great movie and can be enjoyed over and over, belongs in any family movie collection, a very strong recommendation.
I:8747;113;I enjoyed this as a child and was excited to get it for my daughter.
I:8747;114;She enjoys the movie as well and loves to dance and sing along.
I:8747;115;A classic disney movie that the whole family can enjoy rather than just young children.
I:8747;116;My husband and I enjoyed seeing it again and our 5 year old twins adored it.
I:8747;117;My granddaughter who is 7 loved it!
I:8747;118;3 generations of our family connected over our joy watching it, again!It such a spirit lifter!
I:8747;119;Mary Poppins is simply put, my favorite movie.
I:8747;120;Creative, fun, and the special effects are still fantastic.
I:8747;121;Some of the songs have a touch of melancholy, but that's a good thing.
I:8747;122;A cheerfully insane merry go round of crazy singing and dancing with hidden insightful messages.
I:8747;123;She wants to be her.
I:8747;124;Now, I saw `Mary Poppins' years ago, and I've always held it in high regard.
I:8747;125;"She's one of my favorite actresses and I've always held a special place in my heart for both `Mary Poppins' and `The Sound of Music'
I:8747;126;So, with years behind me, I settled in to watch this film for the first time in a long time and I must say that I was astounded at how well this delightful film holds up.
I:8747;127;It's still just as charming and magical as the first day I saw it.
I:8747;128;but my oh my, this is a long movie!Julie Andrews, who snagged an Oscar for her performance in this film, is just all sorts of amazing as the magical nanny who comes along at the right time to spread some joy and bring a family closer together.
I:8747;129;The rest of the cast is also delightful, even Dick Van Dyke despite a horribly shaky Cockney accent.
I:8747;130;from dazzling set pieces to beautifully composed songs to sharply meshed animated sequences, `Mary Poppins' has so much to offer!
I:8747;131;This is a great Anniversary Edition (I know that there has been a 45th released, but this is the one I own and I see no real need to upgrade) with loads of special features to keep you and your little ones occupied.
I:8747;132;All of a sudden, my 9 year old son really wanted to watch it and enjoyed it along with my 7 year old daughter.
I:8747;133;As it turns out, my son is also learning about the Women's suffrage movement and there certainly is a presence of that in this film.
I:8747;134;I bought a copy of Mary Poppins for my daughters and they love it.
I:8747;135;I saw this movie when I was a kid 40 years ago and wanted to share it with them.
I:8747;136;They are still sign Chin Chimeny!
I:8747;137;"ray copy and digital copy for my apple devices
I:8747;138;This timeless video was easy to download band stream to any of my devices.
I:8747;139;:o))))) I love to laugh!!!!
I:8747;140;he definitely is Ms. Andrews equal.
I:8747;141;My grandaughter loved the movie.
I:8747;142;She keeps on singing all day.
I:8747;143;we had a girls night the day it arrived and very much enjoyed watching it again.
I:8747;144;Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are always wonderful.
I:8747;145;And Mary Poppins is a true classic!
I:8747;146;A spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go round.
I:8747;147;Mary Poppins is my favorite.
I:8747;148;I loved this video and watch it whenever it's on the TV.
I:8747;149;The colors on my VHS copy are vivid and the film's condition quite excellent throughout.
I:8747;150;random impressions:Seeing Julie Andrews so young and beautiful, and Dick Van Dyke without all the shaggy white hair, and Ed Wynn alive and giddy, was an absolute delight!There are SO many songs in this picture!
I:8747;151;the live action/animation sequences are quite clever.
I:8747;152;Mary uses a compact to touch up her dirty face with more soot!Clearly, the young lady is vain.
I:8747;153;"She ""hmmph""s when her mirror image outsings her, so she's also jealous, and when she refuses to answer her employer's questions, it shows Mary to be headstrong."
I:8747;154;"so, IS Miss Poppins ""practically perfect""?"
I:8747;155;ideal personality traits indicate she's human, after all?
I:8747;156;Meanwhile DO enjoy Walt Disney's classic family film.
I:8747;157;"It's ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" and ""practically perfect!"""
I:8747;158;still a great movie and my kids loved it!
I:8747;159;My kids don't normally like shows older than, say, 2010, but they really got into Mary Poppins!
I:8747;160;The movie really holds up, even the special effects!
I:8747;161;I just saw Saving Mr Banks in the theatre and really enjoyed it.
I:8747;162;very nostalgic and as much fun as an adult as it is for children.
I:8747;163;Amazon is a great way to access great movies!
I:8747;164;And, of course, loved singing along with all of the oh so familiar songs!
I:8747;165;Especially appropriate to see if you've seen Saving Mr Banks .
I:8747;166;I enjoyed reading Joe Comer's review (above) and agree with most of it, but we shouldn't go overboard on MARY POPPINS.
I:8747;167;Oh what Richard Rodgers could have done with these songs!
I:8747;168;I fantasized about the world of movies in the future, how things could be drawn in so that the characters could do their thing on any landscape or planet.
I:8747;169;In MARY POPPINS you can tell it's a cartoon, and that is part of its magic.
I:8747;170;I grew up watching Disney movies, and musicals are just great.
I:8747;171;I'll I love this one and put it to my children, highly recommended.
I:8747;172;I recommend all new fathers watch this film and understand their kids need them.
I:8747;173;Julie Andrews was incredible in this.
I:8747;174;This musical came out brilliantly on film.
I:8747;175;The music is wonderful and the imagination is great for both children and adults.
I:8747;176;Julie Andrews was incredible in this.
I:8747;177;The music is fantastic and it is great for the whole family.
I:8747;178;Julie Andrews was incredible in this.
I:8747;179;The music is fantastic and it is great for the whole family.
I:8747;180;This is a great film for any kid and a complete dream come true to have a baby sitter this fun Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke team up together and they seem to have a great time together entertaining the kids and I love to see Julie with her umberella a good friend have gave me a figurine of her holding her umbrella I really did like this movie it is witty, fun, enchanting, and entertaining!!!!!!
I:8747;181;This movie brought a smile to my face.
I:8747;182;It is for grownups as well as children.
I:8747;183;This is a timeless movie, with an amazing mix of artistic freedom, psychological insights, family fun, music, great acting, and tender joy!After seeing saving Mr Banks it revived even more the value of the message!A great movie!Asela
I:8747;184;With this Movie, She Actually Won the Academy Award for Best Actress.
I:8747;185;This Movie is a Classic Walt Disney at his Best.
I:8747;186;The 24/7 Support helped me, Put it in 'Your Video Library' here at Amazon.
I:8747;187;I love this movie from when I was a little kid, so I have bought it so my children can enjoy it two.
I:8747;188;I remember watching this movie a lot and always have fond memories of watching it with my mom and dad.
I:8747;189;Kids have enjoyed it just like I have and love watching it on the Kindle in the car.
I:8747;190;my daughter, granddaughter, and I loved watching the movie together and singing the songs over and over
I:8747;191;Greatest movie of all time!!!
I:8747;192;A must see and must have for all ages!
I:8747;193;The story is witty and fosters the imagination
I:8747;194;Mary Poppins is a wonderful movie for the family.
I:8747;195;We loved the songs then (when it first came out) and we still know the words after all this time.
I:8747;196;It is timeless in its imagination and its message.
I:8747;197;This is my all time favorite movie!
I:8747;198;I grew up with Mary Poppins being one of the best stories I had ever read.
I:8747;199;This has always been one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8747;200;Mary Poppins is a wonderful story about two children who want a nanny who is cruel or cross.
I:8747;201;She instantly turns their lives around and brings the entire family closer together.
I:8747;202;This movie is great for all ages.
I:8747;203;The kids love this classic movie.
I:8747;204;Wanted a Blue Ray Edition after watching Saving Mr. Banks (another great movie).
I:8747;205;What else needs to be said except it's one of the most delightful movies of all time and a must for any movie collector.
I:8747;206;So fun to show my 4 year old the movies I loved as a child!
I:8747;207;She and I truly appreciate Julie Andrews as a singer and actress.
I:8747;208;I can't help but remember that Mary Poppins is one of my favorite Disney films of all time along with Cinderella.
I:8747;209;It was great to travel down Memory Lane.
I:8747;210;I love the singable songs in the movie .
I:8747;211;I'm very happy to have this movie and Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;212;And now, I feel compelled to own both movies.
I:8747;213;Thanks for providing it in two version.
I:8747;214;Very clear and good sound.
I:8747;215;This has always been one of my favorite movies and I love the stars who play in it and I am a HUGH Disney movie fan.
I:8747;216;This is a classic .
I:8747;217;I was so happy to share this with my 2 year old grandson.
I:8747;218;What a wonderful movie!I don't think the magic of it will ever die.
I:8747;219;Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke just put everything they had into this memorable film.
I:8747;220;It's a joy to watch, as it always was, and now looks even better than it did on film.
I:8747;221;Would make a great gift anytime!
I:8747;222;I love having access to this on my ipad, My granddaughter loves it too!
I:8747;223;Disney's Mary Poppins is an amazing movie.
I:8747;224;Mary Poppins has stood the test of time, making it a Disney Classic, and for many years to come.
I:8747;225;This movie is excellent for the young, and young at heart.
I:8747;226;This is a great movie for the whole family, brought to you by Disney.
I:8747;227;My girls ages 18 mos.
I:8747;228;and 4 just love this whole story.
I:8747;229;They love the songs and it provides great models for children to look up to with great lessons to learn.
I:8747;230;The music throughout is wonderful, too, and they love to dance to it.
I:8747;231;I enjoyed watching this movie once again.
I:8747;232;I found it very entertaining.
I:8747;233;time favorite movies, and this package delivers.
I:8747;234;one was of the movie, and one was of extra features.
I:8747;235;You will enjoy all of this if you were ever a Mary Poppins fan.
I:8747;236;I remember all the words to every song and my favorite part is still when all the chimney sweepers were dancing on the roof and not to mention Dick Van Dyke's routine with the penguins.
I:8747;237;as I'm sure a lot of other children wished as well.
I:8747;238;The point of me rambling about the significance Mary Poppins had on my childhood is that this movie gets children's imaginations running and will entertain them again and again.
I:8747;239;I've only watched the Making of Mary Poppins, which was so great to get an inside look on one of the greatest films Disney ever made!If you have never seen this movie (where have you been?!?)
I:8747;240;It was a good idea to refresh my memory.
I:8747;241;P. L. Travers is quite a writer and it is just incredible to see the healing that came into her life once Walt Disney finally convinced her (after 20 years) to let him make a movie of her stories.
I:8747;242;The acting was superb in Mary Poppins and it is also quite superb in Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;243;a good movie for all ages~ family funit's funny, sad, happy ~ many emotionssongs are catchymovie is inspiring
I:8747;244;Have always loved this movie!
I:8747;245;this is a must have for your Disney movie collection!
I:8747;246;One of my favorite movies since childhood.
I:8747;247;But, it was a happy movie to watch.
I:8747;248;Mary Poppins was unquestionably Walt Disney's greatest achievement during his lifetime.
I:8747;249;The thought of making a full.
I:8747;250;star cast, completely filmed on a Hollywood sound stage about a story set in London is in itself mind boggling, but Director Robert Stevenson managed to make it happen.
I:8747;251;saw the Oscar as a way of apologizing for the slight.
I:8747;252;the musical score by Robert Sherman is outstanding.
I:8747;253;The film is a riot of special effects, real.
I:8747;254;"life characters in animated settings, and musical and dance sequences that make the film worthy of the label ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" without question."
I:8747;255;"Mary Poppins the film, like the nanny Mary Poppins herself, is ""practically perfect in every way."""
I:8747;256;It is a necessary investment to bring up the kids.
I:8747;257;Everyone needs to get this movie and enjoy one of the best, fun, happy movies every created.
I:8747;258;I love all the singing and dancing.
I:8747;259;"themed 'pet' project, ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"", he was more confident than ever in the story's potential, bringing together a remarkable array of talent, including songwriting brothers Richard and Robert Sherman, production head Bill Walsh, and the brilliant artist Peter Ellenshaw to 'visualize' 1910 London through his matte paintings."
I:8747;260;While American stage and TV star Dick Van Dyke was an odd choice to play a Cockney chimneysweep, he was a gifted mime and physical comedian, and had such a wholesome exuberance that Disney knew British audiences would forgive his shaky accent.
I:8747;261;"Passed over by Jack Warner for the movie version of her stage hit, ""My Fair Lady"" (he opted for Audrey Hepburn), Disney caught her performance in ""Camelot"" on Broadway, knew, instantly, that she was the right 'Mary', and approached her for the role."
I:8747;262;But I'm pregnant, she told him.
I:8747;263;"And thus a Classic was born!A multiple 1964 Oscar winner (including 'Best Actress' for Andrews, who got to share the stage with her Lady"" costar, Rex Harrison, who won 'Best Actor'), the film was a major hit, worldwide, and quickly achieved the legendary status it holds today."
I:8747;264;"for it's 40th Anniversary, Disney's heirs have put together a spectacular package
I:8747;265;remastered film (it looks and sounds SUPERB!)
I:8747;266;, a second disc of additional features includes a joyous reunion of stars Andrews and Van Dyke (who both seem ageless!)
I:8747;267;"
I:8747;268;Bertha Zelda and I just watched this wonderful movie on BD.
I:8747;269;This is a wonderful story about kindness.
I:8747;270;The talents of both Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke were truly amazing.
I:8747;271;the BD looks and sounds very decent.
I:8747;272;There is much written about the impossibility of the film looking good because the special effects were done using layers of film.
I:8747;273;Well, despite that, the BD rendering of the film is still superb.
I:8747;274;Like all good childrens books and movies, it reveals more depth when experienced by adults.
I:8747;275;The dialogue and dancing scenes are done with the wit of classic musicals, but with strong, melancholic undertones.
I:8747;276;All the songs I remember, and a simple if enjoyable storyline.
I:8747;277;pay close attention to the old man at the bank., it's actually Dick Van Dyke!This is Julie Andrew signature role, and it is great to see a move without explosions or violence, just fantasy and fun.
I:8747;278;Great classic Movie for the whole family.
I:8747;279;Mary Poppins has blessed everyone who has ever seen it, and for others who have said they have seen bits and pieces of it.
I:8747;280;"The ""Supercalifradgilisticespialidocius: The Making of Mary Poppins"" is probably a great documentary that is impossible to stop watching, and realizing that yes, this is one of the greatest Walt Disney movies ever made."
I:8747;281;Mary Poppins is a classic and every little kid should have this movie, even in this day and age to go back to a time of pure simplicity.
I:8747;282;Julie Andrews is amazing, and Dick Van Dyke is hilarious.
I:8747;283;The movie took on a whole new life after seeing Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;284;A wonderful family movie,With an excellent message.
I:8747;285;was really impressed with theanimation and color.
I:8747;286;it is, without a doubt, one of the best movies ever.
I:8747;287;i am SO happy I found it on Amazon and for a good price, too !
I:8747;288;This IS a classic that everyone should see and have.
I:8747;289;It's 1964 again and I'm 10 years old.
I:8747;290;This 45th Anniversary edition of Mary Poppins is wonderful.
I:8747;291;I love it just as much now as I did when I saw it at the movie theatre.
I:8747;292;The added features are very good.
I:8747;293;children of all ages, and a charmingclassic.
I:8747;294;The songs by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, andcast make it memorable, and one to enjoy time after time.
I:8747;295;Great movie but some musical sequences were too long.
I:8747;296;This is a classic that anyone, any age will be sure to enjoy.
I:8747;297;If you're a fan of Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, you must see this strange and surreal children's classic.
I:8747;298;Watched it years ago and wished to enjoy it again.
I:8747;299;There's no need to write another review of this splendid film.
I:8747;300;I found the story behind the movie more interesting than the movie itself.
I:8747;301;having said that, this is still a marvelous movie.
I:8747;302;I rank this right next to The Sound of Music.
I:8747;303;This is by far my favorite Disney movie ever.
I:8747;304;The music is unforgettable and the acting is funny and excellent.
I:8747;305;The plot is magical and the script is charming and heart.
I:8747;306;It is a great children's film and it is a picture that really touches you and pulls you in.
I:8747;307;Some images are beautiful and elegant, like the haunting Feed the Birds sequence and the roof smoke climbing.
I:8747;308;It is funny and has great ironic humor like the bank scene and the scene when Mr. Banks is being laid off as the employers puzzle at his crazy realization.
I:8747;309;MARY POPPINS is a great movie for everyone and is a classic movie for everyone to enjoy.
I:8747;310;An excellent Blu Ray package for what is arguably Disney's greatest triumph.
I:8747;311;No matter how old you are Mary Poppins holds up as a great American musical classic
I:8747;312;After that I had to see the movie againwhat a treat!
I:8747;313;The movie is, of course, wonderful.
I:8747;314;We not only love the movie but particularly enjoyed the feature that has all the songs!
I:8747;315;This is a great bargain for the combo.
I:8747;316;This classic is one I have fond memories of since it was a special treat for us to go see a movie.
I:8747;317;My family had never seen it before, so we all enjoyed watching it.
I:8747;318;The overall feeling you get from watching it is good and I like that.
I:8747;319;Great movie just as I remembered from my own childhood.
I:8747;320;My granddaughter loves it and already sings along and she is only two and a half years old!
I:8747;321;This is one of my all time favorite movies.
I:8747;322;I grew up with this movie and my kids loved it!
I:8747;323;I love that it's totally wholesome for a 4 and 5 year old boy to watch without any violence and good family fun!
I:8747;324;the movie was used, but the case and discs are in fantastic condition!!
I:8747;325;We are so excited to have Mary Poppins in our home!
I:8747;326;I loved this movie as a child.
I:8747;327;I watched it with my 4 year old who enjoyed it just as much.
I:8747;328;this is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8747;329;Excellent price for an excellent movie.
I:8747;330;Definitely recommended for anyone looking for a good movie to watch with the family.
I:8747;331;Released in `64 `Mary Poppins' is without question one of the most beloved movies in Disney's vast vault of wonderful family film classics.
I:8747;332;"this film is what family entertainment is all about
I:8747;333;This is definitely a keeper by all means.
I:8747;334;Most of them are made with the sincere hope and belief that they could possibly catch a bit of the kind of movie magic that this classic family film is absolutely overflowing with.
I:8747;335;"There truly is something for everyone in ""Mary Poppins,"" and it is indeed ""practically perfect in every way."
I:8747;336;That's how smooth and seamless the film is, and how brightly artful the whole thing is done.
I:8747;337;the kids won't notice all that, they'll just be swept away by little Jane and Michael's adventures.
I:8747;338;To top it all off, Julie Andrews is appealingly very pretty, which doesn't hurt one bit, from the male perspective.
I:8747;339;Standing strong beside its major competition in the 60's is Walt Disney's classic adaptation of the Mary Poppins books.
I:8747;340;"I enjoyed it as a kid
I:8747;341;But the creative storytelling, fun adventures, big stars (Who couldn't enjoy watching Ed Wynn laugh himself onto the ceiling?)
I:8747;342;, and brilliant songs cause the objective viewer to forget its shortcomings and lose himself in the magic.
I:8747;343;"it is the story of Jane and Michael, two children who love their father dearly
I:8747;344;When Mary Poppins breezes in (literally) to apply for the job of nanny, she brings with her a firm commitment to living life to its fullest.
I:8747;345;The infectious atmosphere of joy she spreads touches everyone she meets, changing the heart of the father, and opening him up to the wonders life has to offer to him, particularly through his children.
I:8747;346;I personally have laughed and cried, even at age 27.
I:8747;347;whole family can watch and enjoy, laugh.
I:8747;348;With stars Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, you are assured of great acting and music.
I:8747;349;His songs and acting are all fun and exciting.
I:8747;350;if you have kids, this will be worth your time.
I:8747;351;They love the way at the end when the kids take over the castle and put the 'Child Catcher' in the big net.
I:8747;352;Every time I see this movie I love it more and more.
I:8747;353;It has appeal for people of all ages.
I:8747;354;Humor and sentiment are perfectly balanced.
I:8747;355;The extras on this version are wonderful.
I:8747;356;The best bonus on it is the backstage look at the making of the movie.
I:8747;357;Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, among others, share stories about Walt and their experiences while making the movie.
I:8747;358;"There are some especially touching stories about Walt Disney, and the elderly lady appearing in the song ""feed the birds,"" which happened to be one of Walt's favorite songs."
I:8747;359;There are numerous little facts and stories all throughout the bonus features that are sure to interest fans.
I:8747;360;Streaming videos is so easy and convenient!
I:8747;361;we had fun and she loved it.
I:8747;362;It us a super good movie.
I:8747;363;I enjoy this film more now than when I was a kid.
I:8747;364;The songs are very memorable .
I:8747;365;Julie Andrews will always be remembered for her role as Mary Poppins, and Dick Van Dyke absolutely shines as Bert the Chimney Sweep.
I:8747;366;"notch and has a wonderful moral without being too ""preachy""."
I:8747;367;The animated bit is a little flat by today's standards, but it adds a wonderful bit of whimsey to a stellar production.
I:8747;368;Highly recommended to any family with children.
I:8747;369;Because there's a much better, two.
I:8747;370;Great movie and the 50th anniversary was well done!
I:8747;371;The extras were very good and informative.
I:8747;372;Great classic movie for the entire family.
I:8747;373;It will have you laughing and singing the songs after you watch it.
I:8747;374;My sons (4 and 6) could watch this movie again and again and never lose interest, and we love it, too.
I:8747;375;I loved the Mary Poppins books as a child and when I read them to my children.
I:8747;376;The movie is very enjoyable, but I am still bothered by several things.
I:8747;377;cute, patronizing animation that lacked artistic qualities.
I:8747;378;She slid up without us having to have it explained to us.
I:8747;379;The laughing tea party is a delight and I can't stop laughing myself.
I:8747;380;Feed the Birds is my favorite song and touches the right note about maintaining perspective in life.
I:8747;381;time favorite movies from childhood!
I:8747;382;We bought this to add to our collection so as our granddaughter gets older, she will be able to watch it with us!
I:8747;383;Until then, we will enjoy watching it ourselves and just remembering the joys of our own childhood!
I:8747;384;This is my favorite movie of all time.
I:8747;385;Great for kids and adults.
I:8747;386;new 40th Anniversary edition of MARY POPPINS is definitely a must.
I:8747;387;own for all fans of the movie, and has been well worth the wait.
I:8747;388;The last edition (on the Gold Classics label) featured a great print but scant extras and fans simply knew that the Disney company should have done a better job remastering and releasing one of their most beloved films.
I:8747;389;full of extra features, the big highlight being an audio commentary by Dame Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and Karen Dotrice among others.
I:8747;390;it is indeed a thrilling movie experience.
I:8747;391;Out of the dreary London skies soars Mary Poppins, who sets about restoring the love and friendships in the fractured Banks family.
I:8747;392;Along the way Mary leads us through many magical adventures including a 'Jolly Holiday' inside a pavement chalk picture, a tea party on the ceiling with Uncle Albert and a dance on the rooftops with Bert and his chimney.
I:8747;393;Julie Andrews (who has renewed her ties to the Disney family with her role as Queen Clarisse in the PRINCESS DIARIES films) also has a lovely chat with Dick Van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman as they reminisce about making the movie.
I:8747;394;new 40th Anniversary tribute is the ultimate testament to this magical Disney masterpiece!
I:8747;395;I found one here at walmart that was the special edition and it was cheaper.
I:8747;396;Julie Andrews was great, and I enjoyed the music, but it's not something I would watch without my grandchildren.
I:8747;397;How wonderful to be able to share with my daughter one of my favorite movies.
I:8747;398;I believe I have enjoyed it even more now because I can share a clean and positive movie with her.
I:8747;399;And she absolutely loves watching the singing and dancing.
I:8747;400;Great story line and animations.
I:8747;401;Mary Poppins is a timeless classic, the songs, and the acting is so Disney.
I:8747;402;Despite its age, my kids still love this classic, and were singing the songs days after they watched it.
I:8747;403;It's still one of the best Disney musicals.
I:8747;404;is you have it would you please let me know?!
I:8747;405;I totally enjoyed the movie.
I:8747;406;looking forward to a fun day watching this movie with friends.
I:8747;407;Love it, absolutely love it .
I:8747;408;the music is great, the animation is excellent, and Mary Poppins .
I:8747;409;My granddaughter loved it as much as I did when I first saw it!
I:8747;410;She is eight and already singing some of the songs!
I:8747;411;Thank you for providing such a great service so that older movies become new all over again!
I:8747;412;very well done and such fun to watch again after many years.
I:8747;413;I love this show and sing along with all the songs in it!
I:8747;414;It will be watched for many generations to come!
I:8747;415;loved watching it with my daughter.
I:8747;416;she is still walking around singing the songs and we watched it weeks ago!Great family entertainment!
I:8747;417;what a GLORIOUS and somewhat overlooked musical!
I:8747;418;Mary Poppins is more than a pretty face .
I:8747;419;she comes into the Banks family, a couple who are somewhat distracted from their two beautiful children Jane and Michael as they both pursue independent goals in 1910 London .
I:8747;420;and she makes the family remember how special family really is.
I:8747;421;It's hard to BELIEVE just how many brilliant songs and dances can be crammed into a movie and how much color and magic can be woven in there.
I:8747;422;"nursery game ""A Spoonful of Sugar"", and the touching song (the favorite of Walt Disney himself) ""Feed the Birds""."
I:8747;423;rounded perfection completes this classic tale .
I:8747;424;but the special features were more than generous, including a talk with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke about the project, and a making.
I:8747;425;"a wonderful treasure that exceeds most typically ""for children"" films."
I:8747;426;This movie is for everyone .
I:8747;427;"The film that made Julie Andrews a star, this movie is worthy of the title ""musical"" even in the most serious of terms."
I:8747;428;I just love this movie.
I:8747;429;Just as good as the first time.
I:8747;430;We watched it with our grandchildren and they loved it too.
I:8747;431;Every bit as good as in theatres.
I:8747;432;I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves Disney movies !!
I:8747;433;Overall, loved everything about this edition.
I:8747;434;We watched it together along with my mother and truly enjoyed the story all over again.
I:8747;435;The colors were wonderful, and the extras were very interesting.
I:8747;436;I bought this hoping we could share it, and it has been a HUGE hit!
I:8747;437;The music, actors, and animation are perfect for adults and children.
I:8747;438;She's fine now, and still loves it, and just can't help but get up and dance around the house whenever it's on.
I:8747;439;I have always loved Mary Poppins so when I saw the 50th Anniversary Edition I had to have it.
I:8747;440;I shared it with my niece and she loves it too.
I:8747;441;Every time she visits she asks to watch it.
I:8747;442;The movie has exceeded my expectations.
I:8747;443;I think it is interesting to read that the Amazon UK website has this Mary Poppins Blu Ray now on pre.
I:8747;444;of course the film will be beautifully restored on Blu ray and should be a great improvment over the previous remastering attempts.
I:8747;445;This movie will always be a favorite.
I:8747;446;In one of the lavish assortment of additional features and interviews, Mr. Van Dyke has sufficient confidence and self.
I:8747;447;deprecating humor to laugh about this.
I:8747;448;At the end, having accomplished this, she vanishes .
I:8747;449;though for my money, the world of smoky rooftops seems even more unearthly beautiful now than it did ever before.
I:8747;450;"The picture galleries are always worthwhile on Disney releases, and on this more than any of the others, save perhaps ""The Jungle Book""."
I:8747;451;the extra features are suitably lavish .
I:8747;452;an all new animated adventure short, about a cat who did more than just look at a king, a look at the Broadway musical version of the chimney.
I:8747;453;"sweep's ""Step in Time"" dance, and a careful reconstruction of a news feature about the premiere, full of appearances by stars and personalities what will have your children looking at you and saying ""Mmm."
I:8747;454;The singing, the dancing, the musical score is the best!
I:8747;455;It is amazing that a movie that I have seen so many times can still bring such joy.
I:8747;456;It was especially fun since I was able to share it with my 16 year old daughter.
I:8747;457;Great follow up to Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;458;I would recommend you watching this right after watching Saving Mr. Banks, it makes a wonderful double.
I:8747;459;ray to see how significantly better those films appear than this one.
I:8747;460;ray releases not only provided the added resolution and clarity that comes with blu ray, but proper digital handling of the source material brought the films up to better.
I:8747;461;original form (something which is now quite common .
I:8747;462;When you know the full story of the stuffy British/Aussie misfit authoress AND how the Disney Team was encumbered by her eccentrics during productionwell, it is even more amazing they produced such joy for so many.
I:8747;463;It is hard to know the real truths behind any human effort BUT what is captured on screen brings joy and humor to all age groups.
I:8747;464;Have read Mary Poppins the book as well as seeing Saving Mr. Banks the movie.
I:8747;465;The Disney Studios were so far ahead of their time in animation and special effects that it is easy to watch the movie 50 years later and enjoy it.
I:8747;466;"It is also a reminder of the old days of musicals
I:8747;467;Once given a chance to prove her screen presence she managed to turn in a number of very memorable and diverse film roles, though she is mostly remembered for her two singing nanny roles, Mary Poppins and Maria von Trapp.
I:8747;468;of featurettes, a game, etc.
I:8747;469;I found the black and white archival footage of the Hollywood Premier to be especially fascinating.
I:8747;470;and you do feel a bit manipulated into a sense of awe.
I:8747;471;mARY POPPINS was a great achievement that took Disney many years to pull off.
I:8747;472;True, she functioned as a catalyst in the life of the children's family and was responsible for turning the neglectful, business.
I:8747;473;"I remember thinking at the time, ""She was just pretending to like the kids all along."
I:8747;474;The true achievement of MARY POPPINS, however, was the way Disney combined animation with live action, something we probably take for granted today.
I:8747;475;"But I found the ""how to"" stuff fascinating."
I:8747;476;The following year Julie Andrews starred in The Sound of Music.
I:8747;477;Both are terrific films, and the Disney creation fairs reasonably well against the specacular Austrian setting of the 1965 Robert Wise production.
I:8747;478;I especially enjoyed David Tomlinson as the stuffy banker/father.
I:8747;479;the music composed especially for Poppins remains as bright and snappy as was in 1964.
I:8747;480;I love anything with Julie Andrews in it.
I:8747;481;Absolutely delightful: the characters, the music, the lesson.
I:8747;482;Makes one feel it's possible float to the ceiling with laughter or pop in and out of chalk drawings .
I:8747;483;i will always feed the birds .
I:8747;484;It kept stopping and starting.
I:8747;485;we got to see the very first opening credits and then it would shut down.
I:8747;486;MY daughter loved Mary Poppins as a child.
I:8747;487;Now she is 24 years old I bought her the movie to share one day with her kids.
I:8747;488;I have loved this film since I was a child.
I:8747;489;It is a must see family musical event.
I:8747;490;The film puts a smile on your face and a light step to your gait.
I:8747;491;The movie plays fine and the packaging looked right.
I:8747;492;ray I can share the movie with my kids.
I:8747;493;This copy has been digital remastered and restored with some fun bonus content.
I:8747;494;It is a classic movie that is timeless and one that every generation can appreciate.
I:8747;495;I have always enjoyed this movie, but my VCR wore out and I needed an updated version.
I:8747;496;Great family video beloved by every age group in our family.

I:8747;498;Worth the money to replace your old VHS version!

I:8747;500;man band performance (literally and fictionally) of singer, dancer, comic, and enigmatic companion to lead Julie Andrews (in her debut film!)
I:8747;501;who manages to be equally charming, sharp, pseudo.
I:8747;502;caustic, and wistful all at once.
I:8747;503;It is a great scene/number which gives some insight to Mary Poppins' character: efficient, strict, crisp, but also secretly caring and sentimental.
I:8747;504;iterated in her closing lines about 'practically perfect people,' but it is a carefully staged balance of emotions just the same.
I:8747;505;She deserved the Best Actress Oscar every step of the way.
I:8747;506;I think this movie is terrific,and there is not a thing wrong with it.
I:8747;507;julie Andrews well deserved her Oscar, and I think Dick Van Dyke should have got one too.
I:8747;508;the songs are mesmorizing, and all the actors did a wonderful job.
I:8747;509;It's in my top 4 Disney movies of all time.
I:8747;510;Mary Poppins is terrific, and a movie the whole family should enjoy.
I:8747;511;The beloved Disney version of P. l. Travers' magical nanny in sparkling high definition.
I:8747;512;A must have for anyone whose delight begins at the opening credits and continues through each ensuing episode until the kites soar with the music at the finale.
I:8747;513;this wonderful fairy tale with its brief bits of dark and scary ends joyfully even as Mary Poppins flies back into the clouds, her work in the Banks household finished.

I:8747;515;importance of family being more important than work and great ideals.
I:8747;516;Great ideals and work are great when first things are put first, but as deadly and void as any other vice when out of place.
I:8747;517;Great music and dance, delightful tales, will make kids and adults alike smile.
I:8747;518;a positive attitude works wonders!
I:8747;519;We enjoyed watching Mary Poppin's and Bert's antics and the sweet reactions of the children.
I:8747;520;the return process has been handled well.
I:8747;521;This was a great movie in its day, I have lots of memories related to it.
I:8747;522;I would recommend this movie to everyone!
I:8747;523;They LOVE it and have been going around the house, singing the familiar tunes!
I:8747;524;Fun for the family, children and adults alike.
I:8747;525;I recommend both as they story will stay with you forever.
I:8747;526;I have shared this with two generations of my children and they absolutely love it!
I:8747;527;, that this is the first film I ever got to see without an adult accompanying me.
I:8747;528;I remember badgering my mother to let the friend from school who was sleeping over (another first) and I go see the movie alone.
I:8747;529;"stone on the path to being a ""grown."
I:8747;530;"that piece of nostalgia aside, ""Mary Poppins"" is besides ""The Wizard of Oz"" and the other classic Disney Films, one of the most delightful fantasy films that can be enjoyed by both children and adults."
I:8747;531;In adapting them to the screen the writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, skillfully choose several chapters out of the first two books and added their own inspired ideas.
I:8747;532;Although the Banks children live a very comfortable existence on Cherry Tree Lane in the heart of London, they are starved for some affectionate attention.
I:8747;533;Mary Poppins serenely sails in from the skies, and with her good friend the jack.
I:8747;534;trades Bert (Dick Van Dyke) they take the children on all sorts of wondrous adventures and nourish them with tenderness and love.
I:8747;535;By the film's end the Banks are truly a happy family, thanks to Mary Poppins.
I:8747;536;it's magical, in all senses of the word, and transcends the generations.
I:8747;537;I recall that very first time my friend and I laughing in delight and looking at one another in awe as one illusion after another unfolded on the screen, how'd they do that anyway?
I:8747;538;I felt I'd come full circle the first time I watched it with my son when he was three seeing the wonder reflected in his face and hearing him merrily chortle as Mary Poppins cast her spell yet again.
I:8747;539;Practically perfect in every way is how Mary Poppins is described, and I will borrow that phrase to characterize Julie Andrews' performance as Mary Poppins.
I:8747;540;"tilted nose down to her feet spread out to form a ""v"" shape, she is the prettiest, most beguiling nanny you'll ever come across, sings gloriously and enchantingly makes the role her own."
I:8747;541;"As Bert, Dick Van Dyke, lanky and rubber limbed is her ideal partner, they are simply wonderful together particularly in the ""Jolly Holiday"" sequence."
I:8747;542;Child actors can be annoyingly arch and cutesy, but Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber as Jane and Michael Banks are refreshingly natural and winning without any irritating mannerisms.
I:8747;543;the rest of the cast is outstanding and should take a collective bow, starting with Glynis Johns and David Tomlinson as the Banks, Ed Wynn as the effervescent Uncle Albert, Hermione Baddley, Reta Shaw, Reginald Owen, Elsa Lanchester, and Arthur Treacher down to Jane Darwell's tender Bird Woman.
I:8747;544;other reasons to see this film, first, for their time extraordinary special effects that are all the more impressive since they were developed pre computer, deservedly rewarded with an Oscar.
I:8747;545;"Next a bright, tuneful score, the best ever done by the Sherman Brothers, including the Oscar winning Best Song ""Chim Chim Cher."
I:8747;546;This last was allegedly one of Walt Disney's favorite songs, and again this original score also took away an Academy Award.
I:8747;547;The evocative sets of 1910 Edwardian London are perfectly executed particularly the Cherry Tree Lane set, and Tony Walton, the then husband of Julie Andrews designed costumes that a treat to the eye.
I:8747;548;"Again Oscar nominations for both, actually ""Mary Poppins"" received a record 13 Oscar nominations that also included Best Picture and Best Director for Robert Stevenson."
I:8747;549;the special features are a treasure trove of riches.
I:8747;550;"Here are the highlights: a fascinating commentary by Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, The Sherman Brothers and Karen Dotrice, ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins"" ."
I:8747;551;"very well done indeed, a musical reunion with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman, the gala world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theater, lots of fun to see the Hollywood A list circa 1964, a bonus animated short narrated by Julie Andrews called ""The Cat that Looked at a King"", and finally a song that was cut called ""Chimpanzoo"" performed by Richard Sherman."
I:8747;552;last words, this restored print has state of the art picture and sound, with vivid, glowing colors and a clear, crisp soundtrack and score.
I:8747;553;I could go on and on, sufficient to say this was Walt Disney's live action film masterpiece, if you're never seen it before you're in for a joyous celebration, and if you have take the time to renew your acquaintance with this timeless classic.
I:8747;554;After recently seeing Saving Mr. Banks and seeing the Broadway production of Mary Poppins in October, I had to see this movie again.
I:8747;555;It brought back great memories and the wonders of seeing it as a child.
I:8747;556;Especially after watching Saving Mr. Banks, one must see this classic film.
I:8747;557;As I remembered it, still 50 years later a wonderful movie to share for all.
I:8747;558;Recommend it for the entire family.
I:8747;559;I loved it in the movies and it was a gift for a Cuban family who never heard of Mary Poppins .
I:8747;560;best kids movie of all time julie andrews and dick do a great job with the kids jumping in to drowings and having tea way up in the air
I:8747;561;We enjoy it as much as we did 40+ years ago.
I:8747;562;Nobody will ever be able to replace Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke with the same amount of musical and comedic magic.
I:8747;563;Walt used a great deal of imagination to make this children's book into a musical with great animations.
I:8747;564;Julie Andrews is so fabulous and the story is timeless.
I:8747;565;Of course, the music is also wonderful.
I:8747;566;musical lovers, this is one of the great ones.
I:8747;567;The color and detail in the film is also impressive.
I:8747;568;There is a lot of music and definitely a movie for the younger set.
I:8747;569;But who won the Academy Award for Best Actress?
I:8747;570;Julie Andrews and the rest of the cast are forever wonderful in this unforgettable Disney block buster.
I:8747;571;A group of friends and I had gone to see Saving Mr. Banks .
I:8747;572;Enjoyed it the first time and did so this time.
I:8747;573;We are collecting all of the Disney films!
I:8747;574;Our daughter loves them all!
I:8747;575;Glad to be able to find them on Amazon instead of searching all the stores!
I:8747;576;This is a classic movie, you couldn't go wrong watching it over and over again.
I:8747;577;Fun for the whole family!
I:8747;578;There are some nice extras in here, too.
I:8747;579;Andrews is wholesomely pretty and Glynis Johns, even with her strange voice, also is appealing.
I:8747;580;the other major character, the chimney sweep played by Dick Van Dyke, is a likable chap, but hard to understand with this cockney impression.
I:8747;581;Van Dyke surprised me with his singing and dancing talent.
I:8747;582;the movie was one of the first efforts at mixing real life with animation and they did it well.
I:8747;583;It still holds up today.
I:8747;584;I remember seeing this on a huge screen when it first came out when I was ten years old.
I:8747;585;It was an amazing and dazzling experience.
I:8747;586;The mix of animation and live action was miraculous.
I:8747;587;I am almost shocked how well it has held up after forty years.
I:8747;588;Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are stunningly good.
I:8747;589;They give very fine performances.
I:8747;590;the movie holds up solid as a rock.
I:8747;591;The images, songs, dance numbers, and even the acting are all top notch and permanently enjoyable.
I:8747;592;There is a nice piece with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, and Richard Sherman reminiscing about the movie.
I:8747;593;I agree that it wouldn't have belonged in the movie, but it is a charming show tune.
I:8747;594;This collection is a fine value of a great and timeless gem of Disney Magic.
I:8747;595;A timeless story with some incredible performances and those songs are just wonderful.
I:8747;596;An ageless classic for everyone.
I:8747;597;it's part of our cultural core.
I:8747;598;The crowning achievement of Walt Disney.
I:8747;599;One of the best Disney films, as well as a great musical, with still amazing special effects.
I:8747;600;I'm in my 50's and watch this film annually.
I:8747;601;The kids and I love this movie
I:8747;602;My daughter loves the singing.
I:8747;603;I took my family to see Saving Mr. Banks and discovered my kids had no idea who Mary Poppins was.
I:8747;604;So I ordered it as soon as we got home.
I:8747;605;My daughter wants to marry Bert and she keeps practicing sliding up the banister.
I:8747;606;Fortunately, it was done right in this film, so it's carried over beautifully.
I:8747;607;Feed the Birds is so heart.
I:8747;608;The bonus features are well.
I:8747;609;done, with a nice 'Making of.'
I:8747;610;all in all, this has to be considered the crowning achievement of Walt Disney's time with his company, being the only feature by Disney to be nominated for a best picture oscar until 'Beauty and the Beast'.
I:8747;611;If you haven't seen it before, you'll love it.
I:8747;612;If you have, go back and enjoy it again and again.
I:8747;613;Music, acting, nostalgic, memories of when I saw it in 1964 with my family in Seattle !!!!!
I:8747;614;This has to be one of my and my families favorite Disney movies.
I:8747;615;You would think with animated movies and such that it would be one of them, but the combination of characters, music and a great story make this a movie that we come back to over and over again.
I:8747;616;Julie Andrews defines the role of Mary Poppins and does it in an amazing way, and who can forget having tea on the ceiling of a room or popping through a picture to have an amazing day.
I:8747;617;All of this plus music that sticks in your head makes this a movie that will definitely last the test of time.
I:8747;618;all this was a great new addition to our collection and I know you will like it too!
I:8747;619;It was so nice to be able to get this somewhere.
I:8747;620;My sister loved this as a child and really wanted to get it for Christmas this year.
I:8747;621;One of the better comedy movies from Walt Disney.
I:8747;622;Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke teamed together in this laugh a secondadventure are the perfect choices.
I:8747;623;Dick van Dyke, who plays a character in the movie, Bert the chimney sweeper and Mary's friend, assists with the movies grand theme, of magical activities.
I:8747;624;The dance and comedy routines that occur in the movie with frequent regularity use Dick's comedic abilities to a full expenditure.
I:8747;625;This is great literature, music , dance, actors, and sceneryAdults and children will love the music Chim Chim Cheree and the dance Step In Time.
I:8747;626;A truly beautiful and touching story.
I:8747;627;It is simply fantastic and full of magic.
I:8747;628;We are Mexicans and I play it for him in Spanish and also in English, it is the best way for young ones to learn another language, it works for this purpose as well.
I:8747;629;The music is wonderful, the themes are incredibly wholesome and of course, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are beyond compare.
I:8747;630;practically perfect in every way as mary poppins would say.
I:8747;631;i loved this movie as a child and it was just as expect very clear picture.
I:8747;632;After seeing Saving Mr Banks we had to see Mary Poppins again and it was really great to have that background while watching it.
I:8747;633;That movie sure makes an impression.
I:8747;634;Classic movie and the picture was great.
I:8747;635;She doesn't really use mobile devices, so I kept the digital copy, but this is an incredibly good movie that I hadn't seen since I was a young child.
I:8747;636;Thank you Disney, for FINALLY releasing this.
I:8747;637;This is Disney's best live.
I:8747;638;Better than all of the studio's more recent live.
I:8747;639;"Julie Andrews is, of course, ""practically perfect"" as Mary Poppins."
I:8747;640;Her voice is excellent on every song she's in.
I:8747;641;Dick Van Dyke is also brilliant and I applaud him on his Cockney accent.
I:8747;642;The songs are as memorable as ever.
I:8747;643;When you're older, you realize how well the songs fit and are relevant to the plot.
I:8747;644;They put the end song of the film at the beginning of the second act and they totally eliminate Uncle Albert.
I:8747;645;while not quite in the same caliber as The Wizard of Oz , yet much better than Chitty Chitty Bang Bang , the movie does have irresistable assets: a lovely score, great sets and costumes, as well as infectious acting, singing and dancing by all the leads.
I:8747;646;Nevertheless, Mary Poppins is a bona fide Disney classic, with a wonderful message about life and family.
I:8747;647;Again, if my grand kids are happy, I am most pleased.
I:8747;648;Julie Andrews is able to bring out the many facets of Mary Poppins without compromising the character, and of course her voice is legendary.
I:8747;649;"The Sherman Brothers whipped up some of their most memorable tunes including ""Jolly Holiday,"" ""Spoonful of Sugar,"" and ""Let's Go Fly a Kite."
I:8747;650;In a nutshell, the story is about a magical nanny who swoops in to take care of the Banks children, Jane and Michael, and also help their father realize what he is missing by ignoring them the way that he does.
I:8747;651;"One of the most memorable and touching sequences is the ""Feed the Birds"" numbers, with veteran actress Jane Darwell making her final screen appearance."
I:8747;652;One of Walt Disney's favorite songs, it is sure to bring a tear to many eyes.
I:8747;653;"done documentary on the stage production of ""Mary Poppins,"" detailing almost every aspect of the production that began in London."
I:8747;654;"This feature takes you all over the globe: interviews with the 2 leads are held in NYC at Sardi's restaurant
I:8747;655;You'll also hear from Bob Crowley, the scenic and costume designer, detailing how he came up with the sets (inspired by the book's illustrations) and changes he made for the touring production.
I:8747;656;All in all, a very fascinating extra!
I:8747;657;This is a nice glimpse into the stage production.
I:8747;658;Although it doesn't quite have the pizzazz of the filmed number (what a tough act to follow), the choreography, sets, and costumes work together to create a fantastic production.
I:8747;659;Especially effective is the use of costumes and make.
I:8747;660;Bob Crowley's Design Galleries: Concept art, costume designs, set designs and set models for the Broadway musical* Audio Commentary: with stars Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Karen Dotrice and songwriter Richard Sherman.
I:8747;661;There are a few archival comments included from Walt Disney and others.
I:8747;662;Fantastic track that really adds to the enjoyment of the film.
I:8747;663;It is refreshing to hear that so many years later, both Andrews and Van Dyke (as well as Dotrice) still have a fondness for this film and the experience of making it.

I:8747;674;The 5.1 mix is fantastic, especially during the musical numbers.
I:8747;675;all of your speakers will get full use!
I:8747;676;I am now reminded why this is a Disney classic.
I:8747;677;This has to rank as the crowning achievement of Walt Disney's career, animated or otherwise.
I:8747;678;Mary Poppins is an ingenious blend of clever visuals, song, dance, and animation.
I:8747;679;Andrews' warmth just envelopes the screen and when she sings you just melt.
I:8747;680;this is a lovely flick with great singing and dancing.
I:8747;681;I think kids, as well as dogs, will enjoy it . . . I did.
I:8747;682;It was fun to see this movie again after not seeing it for over thirty years.
I:8747;683;We were able to pass this classic onto the next generation and have them enjoy this awesome movie!
I:8747;684;Liked the Saving Mr. Banks movie, so went back to the film that was the result of that directorial struggle and see the fine work Disney did.
I:8747;685;I bought this for my wife after hearing it was one of her favorites.
I:8747;686;Got it 2 days later (thanks to Prime).
I:8747;687;My daughter and I just watched Saving Mr. Banks a few days ago, and then the same night, me and my daughter watched Mary Poppins, and this was the first time my 7 year old daughter had ever seen Mary Poppins, and she absolutely feel in love with the movie!
I:8747;688;It was really great that she watched Saving Mr. Banks first, and then watched Mary Poppins second, because Saving Mr. Banks is about the story and the making of Mary Poppins, so it really tied everything together.
I:8747;689;Still magical after 50 years.
I:8747;690;My daughter and wife love this film.
I:8747;691;The flexibility of all three formats is a huge bonus as well.
I:8747;692;I'm 16 and I grew up watching this.
I:8747;693;Though it's almost 50 years old now, it's still probably one of the best childrens' movies ever made.
I:8747;694;The special effects were amazing for the time, and some are still unnoticeable today.
I:8747;695;The actors are great, with Julie Andrews as Mary and Dick Van Dyke as Bert.
I:8747;696;The music sends chills down my spine when i listen to it.
I:8747;697;It's just an amazing movie, even 50 years later.
I:8747;698;One of the best movies EVER!
I:8747;699;The cast is great, the Cinematography was innovative and the dancing penguins sequence with Dick Van Dyke was very memorable.
I:8747;700;All of the primary actors (including the children!)
I:8747;701;Anyone who has seen the movie will be familiar with the music from 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocius' to 'A Spoonful of Sugar' to 'Jolly Holiday'.
I:8747;702;Since we're going to see 'Saving Mr. Banks' on Christmas Day it will be good to see that part of the back story for this movie.
I:8747;703;this is a true classic that everyone should see at least once (I would recommend watching it every 2 or 3 years) as I consider it a Disney milestone.
I:8747;704;since I'm a HUGE Disney fan (including the theme parks!)
I:8747;705;this is really important movie for many reasons.
I:8747;706;i would rate this a perfect 10 out of 10 stars .
I:8747;707;But she loved it and enjoyed the music.
I:8747;708;If you have never seen this Walt Disney masterpiece, it is a supreme treat.
I:8747;709;Something about her elicits wonderful things, and she and her cohorts create marvelous film fun and fantasy the likes of which you'll never forget.
I:8747;710;Richard Sherman and his brother composed the memorable film music.
I:8747;711;On Disc Two they take a wistful look back at the production in 1964.
I:8747;712;Both Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke reveal their nostalgic, candid experiences of movie making on the Disney set.
I:8747;713;Watching both discs brought tears of joy to my eyes and surely it will bring broad smiles to yours.
I:8747;714;A timeless tale about love and laughter created by the genius of Mr. Walt Disney.
I:8747;715;A Classic that we introduced to our children.
I:8747;716;"Although it shows it's age some, I love Mary Poppins and my children enjoyed the music and the movie, especially the chalk art and ""I love to laugh"" scenes!"
I:8747;717;in my mind, this movie is the reason why Disney is great.
I:8747;718;don't hold a candle (on the water) to this wonderful Disney masterpiece.
I:8747;719;This is easily my favorite Disney movie ever and one of my favorite movies of all time.
I:8747;720;"one of the things I love most about this movie is the fact that there's plenty of entertainment here for children
I:8747;721;I love the way the satire starts out.
I:8747;722;"then Mr. Banks comes home from work singing about the pleasures of being a man in this age in England:""It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910."
I:8747;723;I still love the thought of a house which sports a naval cannon deck on top.
I:8747;724;The fantastic acting performances by Julie Andrews (who received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress .
I:8747;725;I have already said that this is Disney's best film.
I:8747;726;Well, it is also boasts the finest acting ever in a Disney film.
I:8747;727;i highly recommend purchasing this in the Widescreen format.
I:8747;728;You will see a lot more of the picture than in the standard format.
I:8747;729;Hopefully, that means there will be a special deluxe edition with both formats, documentaries, commentaries, etc. coming out soon.
I:8747;730;This was my daughter's favorite movie growing up.
I:8747;731;time friend, Bert (Dick Van Dyke), entertains patrons of a park with a one.
I:8747;732;Across the street, the eccentric Admiral Boom(Reginald Owen) keeps things interesting.
I:8747;733;While Mr. Banks would prefer someone solemn and cross for the position, the children write their own advertisement, for a kind, cheerful, and fairly pretty nanny who can have fun with them, and show them a bit more warmth.
I:8747;734;looking applicants for the job, Mary Poppins arrives with the childrens' ad in hand, much to the bafflement of Mr. Banks, who allows her to begin a trial period with the children, delighted with her initial presentation.
I:8747;735;"all four are soon magically transported into one of Bert's chalk drawings, dressed stylishly, and enjoying an outing at an outdoor cafe where animated penguins wait on them, they enjoy a carousel ride, and their carousel horses take them to join a fox hunt, and they end up in a derby race, which a flushed Mary Poppins wins,introducing the word, ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" to describe her feelings at doing so."
I:8747;736;they are entertained by pearlies before the rain brings their festivities to an end.
I:8747;737;the young nanny's presence brings a cheerful air to the whole household, and even the domestics are on better terms with each other.
I:8747;738;after his discussion with Mary Poppins, it is agreed that the children will accompany their father to his bank.
I:8747;739;But Bert gently reminds the reluctant Banks that his greatest legacy will be his children, and that spending time with them while they're young is also important.
I:8747;740;But suddenly the stories the children told him about their adventures with their nanny are employed to help him through when he is asked to make a statement.
I:8747;741;The songs stick with you forever, in a good way!!
I:8747;742;This is what movies should be like for clean fun sweet movies.
I:8747;743;I received it when I expected it and it was worth the wait.
I:8747;744;The movie itself is very entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone.
I:8747;745;Very happy with my selection and I will be looking for more soon.

I:8747;747;Although an older film, the remastering does look good for a film of its time.
I:8747;748;as for audio, the film's music and the dialogue comes out quite clear on my home theater.
I:8747;749;The film sounds wonderful via Dolby Digital 5.1.

I:8747;779;But what I discovered by watching the special feature was how important it was for Walt Disney.
I:8747;780;So, there are interesting tidbits including audio that appears on the special features of Travers showing her discontent as an adviser to the film.
I:8747;781;But you really learned how much love went into the creation of this film and how much Walt Disney wanted this film to be loved.
I:8747;782;"just interesting details of how special he wanted this film, from giving people a chance such as signing Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman (the Sherman Brothers) to a contract to write and compose music for ""Mary Poppins"" (and future Disney films), casting an unknown Julie Andrews which Walt Disney loved her performance in ""Camelot""."
I:8747;783;And my favorite tidbit, of Walt Disney casting well.
I:8747;784;These are just among the few interesting tidbits from behind.
I:8747;785;Surprisingly, Disney managed to pull of another spectacular release with the 45th Anniversary edition with even more special features than the original.
I:8747;786;"new ""Mary Poppins: From Page to stage"" which includes a fantastic documentary on the making of the Tony Award winning musical produced with Cameron Mackintosh."
I:8747;787;the primary guideline was that a musical could be created with the understanding that only English born writers and no one from the original film production could be involved with the creative process of the musical.
I:8747;788;"The musical was a great hit in the UK but when it came to doing the musical in the US, this is where things definitely gets interesting and Disney manages to create a lengthy featurette on the process of creating the musical in the US, also a featured performance of a ""Step in Time"", an opportunity for people to download the MP3 and also a chance for people to see Bob Crowley's designs for the musical."
I:8747;789;the original film will always be magical and in the hearts of those who truly were captivated by it but this musical was amazingly done.
I:8747;790;The costumes, the stage setup, the designs, everything looked spectacular and sure enough, the musical received rave reviews in the US as well.
I:8747;791;walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment managed to successfully pull of another spectacular release for the 45th Anniversary Edition.
I:8747;792;This is the definitive version to own!
I:8747;793;As a family we enjoy this each time we watch it.
I:8747;794;Otherwise, really enjoy this copy as well.
I:8747;795;Mary Poppins is a classic Disney movie.
I:8747;796;"But, given Disney's prolonged difficulties with the prickly Mrs. Travers, it is a minor miracle that the movie ""Mary Poppins"" turned out to be an uplifting masterpiece, full of healing, hope and, yes, magic."
I:8747;797;The rest of the world embraced it.
I:8747;798;ray format and technology does reveal some of the movie.
I:8747;799;"And, after 50 years, ""Mary Poppins"" holds up remarkably well."
I:8747;800;"mrs. Travers' ""Mary Poppins"" books are a whimsical collection of quaint and magical short stories."
I:8747;801;"The screenplay by Don Degradi and Bill Walshe gives ""Poppins"" a plot and a purpose."
I:8747;802;There is definitely a reason for Mary Poppins to arrive and a reason for her to leave.
I:8747;803;In between her arrival and departure, there is a profound emotional journey for audiences of all ages.
I:8747;804;"so I finally decided to mix a bit of warmth in with it."""
I:8747;805;nonsense demeanor, crisp and efficient, employing clever amounts of reverse psychology in her dealings with children and adults.
I:8747;806;Still, Van Dyke has excellent chemistry with Andrews, playing Bert with an appropriate sense of childlike enthusiasm and wonder.
I:8747;807;He is also excellent in the exuberant musical numbers by Robert and Richard Sherman.
I:8747;808;Mrs. Banks (Glynis Johns) seems a warm and loving mother, but she is preoccupied with her political involvement with the Suffergettes.
I:8747;809;"Quickly employing herself as the new nanny, Mary Poppins and her friend Bert take Jane and Michael (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber) on magical adventures
I:8747;810;"the movie was, and remains, an outstanding critical and commercial success
I:8747;811;"But the film remains Mary Poppins best and most magical medium
I:8747;812;A true family movie for all to enjoy.
I:8747;813;Would recommend for any family with young children
I:8747;814;Have always love this show.
I:8747;815;Will love this for my grandkids.
I:8747;816;They need to know the classics of Disney
I:8747;817;This is another one of my favorite Disney movies.
I:8747;818;This is a magical movie with a great message about the importance of family.
I:8747;819;The music and choreography are wonderful.
I:8747;820;I love so many songs in this movie.
I:8747;821;He has been singing that song, Supercalifragilisticexpealdocious.
I:8747;822;As enjoyable as I remember it!
I:8747;823;My grandson, 9yo, really enjoyed it!
I:8747;824;I would highly recommend this movie to everyone, young and old!
I:8747;825;All time favorite of mine.
I:8747;826;This movie is a must see before watching Saving Mr. Banks , another great movie.
I:8747;827;There are so many classic tunes and scenes.
I:8747;828;Steppin' Time , and I love to laugh are some that just leave me feeling great .
I:8747;829;Still a wonderful, wonderful family film!
I:8747;830;Even my 2 year old grand daughter loved it, and she seldom watches TV at all.
I:8747;831;"Disney again places out a fantastic performance with an all star cast of the 50's and 60s Starring Dick Van Dyke as both Bert and Mr. Dawes Sr.
I:8747;832;Walt had such a wonderful imagination to make this wonderful book come to life and all the great special effects were wonderful especially for 1964!
I:8747;833;Went to see Saving Mr. Banks, and this was a must see after that great movie, grand kids and I both loved it.
I:8747;834;sweet, she is much more benevolent and feel.
I:8747;835;good than the grouchy, cross nanny in the books.
I:8747;836;The Banks family is also greatly altered .
I:8747;837;Since we love the books so much, I previewed this film alone, and I think I'll hold off for a few years before we give it a whirl as a family: I really think it would ruin the magic of the Travers text, and replace it with something much simpler, much cheaper, and far less wondrous.
I:8747;838;best of the Best of Disney's Musicals.
I:8747;839;This is Disney magic in all its glory.
I:8747;840;One tries to imagine how some future technology will surpass the clarity and beauty that unfolds here before our eyes.
I:8747;841;but it really does seem that this is as perfect as it gets.
I:8747;842;if the remarkable digital restoration of this film was the only Blue.
I:8747;843;the special effects that mesmerized us all for a half century.
I:8747;844;"winning performance, one need only watch Julie's reactions to Bert and the penguin waiters (magnificently animated by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston) as they sing and dance their way through ""Jolly Holiday."""
I:8747;845;"The ""classic"" features from years past are still a wonder to behold."
I:8747;846;"the ""Becoming Mr. Sherman"" featurette is more than worth the price of admission."
I:8747;847;ray format, deserves 5 stars forever.
I:8747;848;Great movie as always, especially after just watching Saving Mr. Banks, but it had moments of skipping a few seconds ahead.
I:8747;849;This is great because it's in widescreen.
I:8747;850;The images are clear, the colours are bright, and this has the look of a restored version (or at least a good print).
I:8747;851;David Tomlinson is both stuffy and loveable as Mr Banks, and Glynis Johns is wonderfully scatty as his wife.
I:8747;852;But it is Dick Van Dyke who makes the film the fun it is.
I:8747;853;Leave aside the dodgy accent, and you're left with a great song and dance man who could carry the film even without the co. stars.
I:8747;854;A really nice edition of this classic movie.
I:8747;855;My children, who claim to be too cool for this old film, thoroughly enjoyed it.
I:8747;856;With so many of today's family oriented movies being animated, it's nice to have classic, fun loving musicals such as this one to turn to on a rainy day.
I:8747;857;5 stars and a hip hip hooray for Mary Poppins!!!
I:8747;858;I started watching this and boy, its really fun to sing to.
I:8747;859;Dick Van Dyke fan, loved him in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang too.
I:8747;860;Julie Andrews wow what a lady!
I:8747;861;She looks so pretty in this film.
I:8747;862;We were looking for musicals and loved Dick Van Dike and Julie Andrews, the energy and the songs.
I:8747;863;Though the actors have fully matured, the video is still beautiful.
I:8747;864;I will recommend to my friends, I am enjoying it.
I:8747;865;a movie that makes you feel happy and keep singing the songs in it.
I:8747;866;i never tire of this classic movie.
I:8747;867;Grandkids can know enjoy this great movie too!!
I:8747;868;Clarity and sharpness was great.
I:8747;869;It's great that these older movies can be made to be viewed better.
I:8747;870;Is fantastic film that is perfect in every way.
I:8747;871;the actors are excellent, the animation superb and the songs are unique.
I:8747;872;release, Disney as usual, wants to gain more profits.
I:8747;873;Disc Two presents us Disney on Broadway, a bunch of featurettes that shows us the new Mary Poppins musical.
I:8747;874;Mary Poppins is truly a classic.
I:8747;875;my family and I do think that it was the best.
I:8747;876;and the song s r the best .
I:8747;877;My granddaughter loves this film.
I:8747;878;She is four years old.
I:8747;879;Mary Poppins is a great movie, full of fun and first.
I:8747;880;It is truly a timeless classic and I never fully realized Julie Andrews' perfection nor Dick Van Dyke's talents until now.
I:8747;881;Three generations of us sat together and were all captured by this magical classic.
I:8747;882;It's still an awesome movie for all ages!
I:8747;883;This is a very clean version of an all time favorite.
I:8747;884;"Julie Andrews is quite simply breathtaking
I:8747;885;The extras are great taking you behind the scenes.
I:8747;886;I always loved Mary Poppins but now I love it more if that is possible.
I:8747;887;I recommend this to anyone who grew up with this movie or if you have someone who will see it for the first time.
I:8747;888;Our daughter is 4 and she enjoys this movie.
I:8747;889;She loves songs and we thought Mary Poppins would be a great movie to watch.
I:8747;890;For example, she also loves Sound of Music songs.
I:8747;891;i think when she is older, she can appreciate the story more but the dancing and singing sequences are still very entertaining.
I:8747;892;Mary Poppins, first released in 1964 and now in its 45th anniversary edition, is just as charming and entertaining as ever.
I:8747;893;"souled children's fairy tale disguised as a Disney musical, ""Mary Poppins"" won five Academy Awards for its songs, its then."
I:8747;894;cutting edge mix of animation and live action, and for the performance of a young Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins.
I:8747;895;"Firm but fair, the ""practically perfect"" Mary Poppins restores order to the nursery through a combination of song and magic, and begins to open the eyes of the children to the possibilities of life and their own imagination."
I:8747;896;"disc edition includes some superb ""making of"" featurettes and interviews with surviving cast members
I:8747;897;Great change from murder, sex, and mayhem.
I:8747;898;She definitely deserved the Oscar that she got.
I:8747;899;The song's are strong, but a few stand out above the rest.
I:8747;900;Such as, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious and ``Chim.
I:8747;901;The Hollywood Goes to a World Premiere featurette, is a great extra.
I:8747;902;"It's hard to deny the charm of ""Mary Poppins,"" the enchantingly colorful movie, from an era where Disney had outstanding movies up the wazoo, rather than one every now and then."
I:8747;903;and for lovers of this movie, it's worth every second.
I:8747;904;Mary Poppins's magical talents and offbeat pals soon endear her to the kids, especially when they romp through a chalk painting and have tea parties on the ceiling.
I:8747;905;Even though the film was made forty years ago, the special effects and blend of animation and reality are remarkably fresh and undated .
I:8747;906;And the story is a timeless one .
I:8747;907;surprisingly, the movie's more sober, melancholy second half makes it more palatable to adults.
I:8747;908;of featurette and a look at the musical creations in this film.
I:8747;909;A particular bonus is a reunion with Andrews, van Dyke and composer Richard Sherman around a piano .
I:8747;910;it's just very relaxed, laid.
I:8747;911;one of the best things is that the entire film has been remastered.
I:8747;912;"Half of ""Mary Poppins'"" charm is in the visuals and songs."
I:8747;913;So it's great to see the color and sound cleaned up and sharpened .
I:8747;914;it has the slight fuzz of a film that needed a bit more work (or maybe that's my old TV), but overall the work is good.
I:8747;915;"forty years have passed, and ""Mary Poppins'"" charm is undiminished."
I:8747;916;So in celebration of that, the anniversary edition with all the bonus material is definitely worth getting.
I:8747;917;you will be singing for the rest of the day, guaranteed.
I:8747;918;This movie is much deeper in meaning after watching saving mister banks, but it always was a great movie guaranteed to put a smile on your face.
I:8747;919;This is one of my favorite musicals of all time featuring Julie Andrews as a brunette nanny who turns everyday activities into magical ones and helps a family remember their love for each other.
I:8747;920;After watching and thoroughly enjoying Saving Mr. Banks, our family decided to watch Marry Poppins again.
I:8747;921;Admittedly the Jolly holiday with Mary sequence goes on for a bit too long (they probably could have cut out either the fox hunt or the horse race) but otherwise most every scene is magical.
I:8747;922;Dick van Dyke's performance is a tour de force and Julie Andrews is at her subtle best as the nanny who never explains anything.
I:8747;923;My son was able to easily pick out that Uncle Albert was played by Ed Wynn who was also portrayed the Mad Hatter in Disney's animated rendition of Alice in Wonderland.
I:8747;924;I suggest that you cue this film up the next time you have a free evening and remind yourself all over again what a landmark piece of cinema it really was.
I:8747;925;Great old movie that still catches the interest even after 50 years.
I:8747;926;Still a fresh new movie for today
I:8747;927;Everyone knows this film, right?
I:8747;928;It's essential watching for children of all ages.
I:8747;929;Mary Poppins is the quinessential magical nanny, and Julie Andrews has become so identified with her performance in this film that most people will always see her as Mary Poppins.
I:8747;930;It's still pretty sparse as far as extras go and nothing spectacular, but it's an improvement for Disney.
I:8747;931;It's a classic film that can be enjoyed by the family over and over again.
I:8747;932;I was five years old when it was originally released, and I managed to convince my mother to take me to see it six times.
I:8747;933;I still feel a genuine warmth about this movie as an adult.
I:8747;934;With the help of devoted friend Bert, a Cockney jack.
I:8747;935;hearted hand on their behavior.
I:8747;936;there are so many delightful scenes that it's hard to choose which to highlight, though one of the best ones has to be the fantasy animated sequence through Bert's sidewalk painting.
I:8747;937;"Another wonderful scene is the ""Spoonful of Sugar"" room clean."
I:8747;938;is an endearing presence and a dexterous comic dancer.
I:8747;939;The children are played without affectation by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber.
I:8747;940;Veteran character actors fill the rest of the roles expertly in what amounts to extended cameos .
I:8747;941;"the songs by the Sherman Brothers, Richard and Robert, are truly enchanting and memorable after all these years, especially the haunting ""Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)"", the wistful ""Chim."
I:8747;942;Regardless, director Robert Stevenson, who made many of the live.
I:8747;943;action Disney films of the 1960's, along with screenwriters Bill Walsh and Don Da Gradi, have concocted what has to be one of the best family.
I:8747;944;Having seen Saving Mr. Banks this classic film makes more sense or has a deeper meaning.
I:8747;945;Dame Julie and the film are practically perfect in every way.
I:8747;946;'Let's go fly a kite' is good advice for anyone, especially those needing a lift!
I:8747;947;The digital transfer is pretty good considering the age of the film.
I:8747;948;Adults folks for the Banks movie!Walt had a knack for finding great stories to put to film and this was one of his great finds.
I:8747;949;Again, this was a gift and I am sure it will be played many times.
I:8747;950;It was played on Christmas Day to the enjoyment of all who watched it.
I:8747;951;I had not seen the movie in many, many years, myself, and greatly enjoyed seeing it again.
I:8747;952;I am an avid Netflix watcher, which does have a (usually) brief buffering time, so this was impressive to me.
I:8747;953;It also includes a booklet of the award winning songs and you can sing along.
I:8747;954;A classic story for all movie libraries.
I:8747;955;I remember this movie as a child and it was so enchanting and beautiful.
I:8747;956;It was wonderful wishful thinking!
I:8747;957;As an adult I can say the following: It is still a great movie but a bit antiquated.
I:8747;958;Too much singing although the songs are classics and it was great to hear them again.
I:8747;959;I understand that it is a classic for it's time but DISNEY please give us new classics instead of trying to revive the old ones.
I:8747;960;This is the rare children's film which I found to be just as delightful today as when I sunk into the plush seats of Radio City in 1964.
I:8747;961;Julie Andrews' glorious voice, and hilariously ironic, deadpan portrayal of the magical nanny, have boundless appeal.
I:8747;962;the stage performance would top that of the West End.
I:8747;963;the story is great fun, acting and music first rate, and the situations the type that make one wish one could join in, popping into pavement pictures for sheer enjoyment.
I:8747;964;Very happy to have this movie in our home library again since our VCR broke down and we couldn't play the tape.
I:8747;965;Mary Poppins is one of the best movies ever made and it's appealing to all ages and sexes.
I:8747;966;I actually hadn't seen this movie myself, but I knew all the songs in it from being a voice teacher.
I:8747;967;I just saw the movie, Saving Mr. Banks,and saw the heart and soul of, Mary Poppins.
I:8747;968;Both Walt Disney, and P. L. Travers created a healing path through the movie.
I:8747;969;One of the greatest movie songs ever.
I:8747;970;I loved it when I was a kid and remember seeing it at the movie theater with my whole huge family and my mother crying at the end.
I:8747;971;I was so happy to find this in such excellent condition.
I:8747;972;With the original shrink wrap, this was in perfect gift condition.
I:8747;973;a wonderful family film packed with the best bonus features I've seen to date.
I:8747;974;Everything from the set design/visual effects, to casting, and songwriting is superb.
I:8747;975;You can really feel the love and effort that was put into the making of this movie.
I:8747;976;And the bonus features help to show that in.
I:8747;977;She is perfect in every way.
I:8747;978;I love Dick Van Dyke as as Bert He showed wonderful skills as a dancer and singer.
I:8747;979;This is Walt Disney greatest movie.
I:8747;980;After 50 years it is still a delight.
I:8747;981;Mary Poppins is a movie that we love and can watch 1,000 times.
I:8747;982;I was motivated to watch the movie again after seeing Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;983;I always enjoy this movie!
I:8747;984;It is very fun, entertaining, and Julie Andrews is absolutely amazing!
I:8747;985;A classic film for every generation and those to come.
I:8747;986;The blu ray surprisingly looks really well but not perfect.
I:8747;987;It does contain some scenes that are grainy, but they still are very enjoyable.
I:8747;988;As wonderful as it was years ago.
I:8747;989;The chimney sweep dance on the rooftops is still my favorite.
I:8747;990;It's a classic children's movie.
I:8747;991;My 15 month old son just adores this movie and all of the songs in it.
I:8747;992;Mary Poppins was always one of my favorites as a young girl now my son can enjoy it as well.
I:8747;993;I find myself singing along while my son dances.
I:8747;994;This classic movie with extravagant dance numbers and little twists were great for my 2 year old who stayed enraptured of the movie for the majority of it.
I:8747;995;In these days of short 20 minute bursts of young entertainment it was nice to see something that could keep him sated for an extended period.
I:8747;996;Especially appropriate with Saving Mr. Banks coming out about the relationship between Walt Disney and P. l. Tavers, the lady that wrote the Mary Poppins book.
I:8747;997;This is a great wholesome, fun movie!
I:8747;998;Love the original great movies!
I:8747;999;This movie will always be a classic.
I:8747;1000;It's an excellent movie that showcases family and magic.
I:8747;1001;This movie is a must see for everyone.
I:8747;1002;If this sounds interesting to you, you should watch Mary Poppins!!!!!!
I:8747;1003;Mary Poppins might be the best movie weve ever seen!
I:8747;1004;We recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
I:8747;1005;Theres a great scene with chimney sweepers that jump out of chimneys singing.
I:8747;1006;Another reason we like this movie is because it has really amazing music all through the movie!
I:8747;1007;We really recommend you listen to A Spoonful of Sugar if you havent heard it yet.
I:8747;1008;Another thing is that Mary Poppins is a movie that was made 50 years ago and its still great!
I:8747;1009;Its a classic, brilliant movie that all generations can enjoy!
I:8747;1010;This movie is appropriate for all ages, its non.
I:8747;1011;violent, and it has a very positive message about the importance of change, imagination and magical fun!
I:8747;1012;Mary Poppins is a classic and my children enjoy this movie as much as I did at their age.
I:8747;1013;Walt Disney Home Entertainment gives another one of their classic films the Blu.
I:8747;1014;No one can deny the beauty of this wonderful story.
I:8747;1015;The ad is answered by charming and whimsical Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews).
I:8747;1016;a solid digital restoration breathes new life into Mary Poppins for its 50th Anniversary Edition.
I:8747;1017;The colors are vibrant and the picture is crisp and clear.

I:8747;1019;Every jolly tune surrounds the viewer in a cloud of joy and delight.

I:8747;1022;definition version of the movie, this is the definitive way to re.
I:8747;1023;It truly is one of the defining moments in cinema history and a jewel in Disney's crown.
I:8747;1024;This is one of my favorite movies!!
I:8747;1025;The digital download of this on my kindle fire is great!
I:8747;1026;I would definitely recommend this to everyone!
I:8747;1027;time favorite Disney flick is worth having in your collection and after watching Saving Mr. Banks makes Mary Poppins that more enjoyable to watch again.
I:8747;1028;I enjoy the movie very much.
I:8747;1029;It is a movie for all ages.
I:8747;1030;The movie itself was thoroughly enjoyable would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in fine acting, dancing, singing and most of all flying.
I:8747;1031;we're soon introduced to the Banks family, living in the upscale suburbs in turn of the century London, England.
I:8747;1032;But Papa Banks also has two impressionable offspring, both intent on driving their daycare workers to the brink of madness.
I:8747;1033;"They too have demands, which they list clearly on a manifesto brought forth and read aloud to the governing parties of the house regarding any future nannies: ""You must be kind, you must be witty."
I:8747;1034;Take us on outings, give us treats.
I:8747;1035;Clearly the equal distribution of sugared confections is a high priority here.
I:8747;1036;Soon afterwards Comrade Poppins sets up shop in the children's part of the house and instructs the children on ways to better serve the State.
I:8747;1037;And then the concerned viewer is told to go fly a kite.
I:8747;1038;to's of 1960's special effects, the stories behind the songs, and much more.
I:8747;1039;There is a commentary track by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke to watch with the movie, if that's your thing.
I:8747;1040;I got the movie when I should have and it was flawless.
I:8747;1041;My 2 year old son and I love the film.
I:8747;1042;Our family loves this movie.
I:8747;1043;Thanks for having this available to the consumer.
I:8747;1044;Brought back memories of my childhood.
I:8747;1045;Love Dick Van Dyke he is great in this movie.
I:8747;1046;Mary Poppins remains the ultimate Disney musical that both entertains and, in a lighthearted tone, sends a sweet message to children and grown.
I:8747;1047;credit for the swift delivery of prosaic force that drives home this angry attack on modern corporate society should go to director Robert Stevenson, who directed many popular Disney films.
I:8747;1048;"Mary Poppins is a departure for Stevenson
I:8747;1049;Unlike his feelgood movies, this is a focused and consistent work.
I:8747;1050;That 1971 work parallels Mary Poppins with its upbeat sardonic songs, but also effectively utilizes surreal gothic imagery, chilling Wiccan chants and disturbing apocalyptic overtones.
I:8747;1051;Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are wonderful.
I:8747;1052;The music and dancing are fabulous from dancing on the rooftops to the old lady feeding the birds !
I:8747;1053;It has live action, cartoon sequences, and fantasy all rolled up in a technicolor package.
I:8747;1054;The image is incredibly sharp, bringing out even the smallest freckles on Julie Andrews' face.
I:8747;1055;audio selections are varied on this new disc, including a French and a Spanish track, and three English tracks.
I:8747;1056;The sound is a marvel in 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix .
I:8747;1057;"A good test is when the chorus enters during the main title sequence, singing ""Chim Chim Cher."
I:8747;1058;extras are very fun and informative.
I:8747;1059;I loved this movie because it was so awesome.
I:8747;1060;I saw this movie when I was just a kid and I loved it then.
I:8747;1061;I saw it again now after so many years and I still loved it as much!!
I:8747;1062;This is simply a great classic masterpiece that everyone should see and have!
I:8747;1063;A classic that even my grand children love to watch.
I:8747;1064;It may be an older movie, but the Disney magic is still alive and well.
I:8747;1065;It's definitely worth another look.
I:8747;1066;It's also nice to compare it to Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;1067;Would highly recommend this movie edition.
I:8747;1068;I thought it was a magical, entertaining story.
I:8747;1069;I bought it for my 2 and 3 year old as something I thought they'd enjoy when they got to grade school.
I:8747;1070;I was surprised to see them riveted to it for most of the program.
I:8747;1071;I'm pretty sure it was the singing and dancing that held their attention.
I:8747;1072;This is definitely a classic that even little ones will enjoy now!
I:8747;1073;I watched this film as a child in the theaters, and it was just as good today as it was then!!!
I:8747;1074;Excellent story line told by top.
I:8747;1075;Received in excellent condition and on time as promised.
I:8747;1076;As much fun as it was 50 years ago~ Great for kids and adults alike.
I:8747;1077;A whole family must see, it still plays as fresh and entertaining as when it was first released.
I:8747;1078;Watch it and rewatch it and notice the slight smile on your and others faces.
I:8747;1079;Julie Andrews teamed with Dick Van Dyke for one of the funniest, creative and heart.
I:8747;1080;I bought this movie for my children because I remember loving it when I was younger.
I:8747;1081;It's a classic and fun for the whole family, as long as the children are old enough to understand what they're saying.
I:8747;1082;Great movie for the whole family.
I:8747;1083;Good for all ages and worth the time to watch.
I:8747;1084;My daughter watch it and she enjoyed it as much as I did when I was her age .
I:8747;1085;Still a classic after all these years, and a monument to Julie Andrews' splendid voice.
I:8747;1086;"Mary Poppins has stood the test of time, with generation after generation enjoying it as much as the previous one and the songs such as ""A Spoonful of Sugar"" are timeless treasures that live on longer than anything that will ever appear on the Top 40."
I:8747;1087;This movie is great for adults and kids of all ages.
I:8747;1088;A true classic feel good movie that will lift your spirits and has depth to boot.
I:8747;1089;I ordered this to add to the many films I have collected as fond memories of my childhood.
I:8747;1090;and even with all of the new amazing technology available, she absolutely loved this movie!
I:8747;1091;She still talks about it and wants to watch it again.
I:8747;1092;"It was wonderful to share something from my childhood with her that she equally enjoyed without thinking it was ""old or outdated""."
I:8747;1093;Kids entertained at any time.
I:8747;1094;Watched it again after seeing Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;1095;Thanks for sending it punctually and in such perfect condition!
I:8747;1096;We enjoyed this movie a lot!
I:8747;1097;I see potential here, especially in Julie Andrews.
I:8747;1098;She has a fair voice and rosy cheeks.
I:8747;1099;Her costume, especially the bonnet, is lovely.
I:8747;1100;These two youngsters will need tremendous coaching, teaching, and molding if they ever hope to be stars, or even mature adults.
I:8747;1101;truly molding the British breed, at other times her lessons appear quite silly.
I:8747;1102;Just as I remembered the movie from when I was a kid.
I:8747;1103;My children LOVED watching this classic childhood movie!
I:8747;1104;My son has never seen it and I wanted to share it with him.
I:8747;1105;wonderful for all ages , a all time favorite, I seen it which I was a child, my kids seen it where they were a child and now our grandchildren are enjoying this movie.
I:8747;1106;Still fresh and funny after all these years.
I:8747;1107;You'll think it's practically perfect, too.
I:8747;1108;It's an overrated movie for ages 5 and younger.
I:8747;1109;and so fun to share it with my grandchildren!
I:8747;1110;This movie is a classic.
I:8747;1111;I grew up watching it as a child and I love it as an adult.
I:8747;1112;Produced by Walt Disney Studios, MARY POPPINS was the number one box office hit of 1965, receiving spectacular reviews and picking up an Academy Award for star Julie Andrews in the process.
I:8747;1113;Together with her friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke) she takes the children on a series of extraordinary adventures than range from jumping into chalk drawings to having tea while floating in the air to wild dancing with chimney sweeps.
I:8747;1114;the story is extremely episodic, but it is well done, extremely whimsical, and the script is often unexpectedly clever.
I:8747;1115;The music holds everything together.
I:8747;1116;"My own favorite in the score is the delicate, beautifully performed ""Feed the Birds."""
I:8747;1117;The film also has a number of cameos, including Hermione Bradley, Reta Shaw, Ed Wynn, Jane Darwell, Reginald Owen, and the aforementioned Elsa Lanchester, all of them charming.
I:8747;1118;The major cast is also quite good, and if Dick Van Dyke's accident seems to come and go in strange ways, the chemistry between him and Julie Andrews more than makes up for it.
I:8747;1119;"The movie is very specifically a ""sound stage"" movie, and the special effects are distinctly of the 1960s, but no less charming for that."
I:8747;1120;In any case, the sound and film elements are excellent.
I:8747;1121;Is this a great movie?
I:8747;1122;But I absolutely defy anyone to watch it without smiling.
I:8747;1123;My 3 kids loved it.
I:8747;1124;Great musical and great resolution!
I:8747;1125;ray is truly the savior for older films and we are the beneficiaries.
I:8747;1126;It means a lot to me.
I:8747;1127;I watched with my grand daughter and it was over the top!
I:8747;1128;I son't remember it moving all the time.
I:8747;1129;This is an excellent movie for children and also the not so young.
I:8747;1130;just wonderful family fun movie.young ones just love it.
I:8747;1131;Yes, of course I bought, it because my daughter loves it, again and again and.
I:8747;1132;Come along now, children, let's read this review.
I:8747;1133;Definitely an experience worth having, whether you've seen it once, or many, many times.
I:8747;1134;This movie makes important comments about suffrage, structure, and just finding the joy in life.
I:8747;1135;The movie is presented in wide.
I:8747;1136;restored, bright and colorful animation and practically perfect sound.
I:8747;1137;There's also both a subtitle and a close.
I:8747;1138;Chief among them is a great deleted song.
I:8747;1139;of feature, a look at the movie magic, a game, promo posters and trailers and many other simply delightful goodies.
I:8747;1140;It was really interesting and I went through every part.
I:8747;1141;worth the price if you just saw the movie.
I:8747;1142;Great movie for my 4 year old and delivered on time.
I:8747;1143;This most wonderful of Disney musicals has been at the top of my all.
I:8747;1144;time best movies list ever since I saw it back in 1964.
I:8747;1145;It's a very humanistic, loving film, but love that has a backbone (snip.
I:8747;1146;It's sweet, silly, touching and still holds up very well technically.
I:8747;1147;It's an ideal antidote for the blues .
I:8747;1148;"The message ""Let's go fly a kite"" ."
I:8747;1149;to take some time off and enjoy life is more relevant today than it was then.
I:8747;1150;It really measures up to the highest standards of family filmmaking.
I:8747;1151;A happy memory movie and the special features with commentary is delightful to listen to!
I:8747;1152;Product came very quickly, in exactly the condition advertised and has brought so much fun to my granddaughter and I. thank you
I:8747;1153;As well as Sound of Music.
I:8747;1154;love the movie and now I can watch it on all my electronics where ever I go thank you alot
I:8747;1155;It turned out they love it.
I:8747;1156;The greatest in imagination, heartfelt carrying, and family learning.
I:8747;1157;I would highly recommend it, after seeing saving Mr. Banks or after seeing it.
I:8747;1158;a good movie i liked it better when i was little but it's still good the songs are rather fun, andrews and dyke were a cute couple that's to about it for this movie, have a SUPERCALIFRAJELISTICEXPEALALIIDOSES day (if that's how you spell correctly)
I:8747;1159;"What made this film so special was not only the cleaver casting of Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke
I:8747;1160;This 45th anniversary presentation of the film is as good as it gets.
I:8747;1161;I loved this film when I was a child, and had cut out dolls, and games relating to the movie.
I:8747;1162;I had the LP and knew all the words and sang them so much it must have driven my family bonkers.
I:8747;1163;And my children also loved this movie and I bought a copy as soon as it became available.
I:8747;1164;julie Andrews won an Oscar for her portrayal of the irrepressible nanny, Mary Poppins who brings a carpetbag of magical adventures into the lives of the Banks family on Cherry Tree Lane.
I:8747;1165;With a dazzling blend of animation and live.
I:8747;1166;winning musical score, this is a must for children and the young at heart.
I:8747;1167;This is a timeless classic, that children centuries from now will still enjoy.
I:8747;1168;The VHS is in good condition and the box is also.
I:8747;1169;The VHS is being sent to our granddaughter for a present and she will be most happy to receive it.
I:8747;1170;Always a hit with the family.
I:8747;1171;Love that my kids also enjoy watching Mary Poppins.
I:8747;1172;Great family night movie with everyone of all ages
I:8747;1173;Having just seen the Broadway Play, I wanted my granddaughter to see the original with Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke.
I:8747;1174;It was so colorful and wonderful.
I:8747;1175;So glad we found it on Amazon.
I:8747;1176;My wife was as happy with the movie as our little girl is.
I:8747;1177;She was born in Bangkok and watching Julie Andrews movies helped her in learning English.
I:8747;1178;She still loves to watch it.
I:8747;1179;This was for my grand daughter, the third generation to love it.
I:8747;1180;I hope her children get a chance to love it too.
I:8747;1181;The movie is definitely 5 stars to me and my family.
I:8747;1182;This is probably one of Walt Disney's best films, if not the best.
I:8747;1183;It is the most excellent realized combination of live action and animation.
I:8747;1184;It contains eternal charm, wit, and magic as it introduces us to the practically perfect nanny who brings profound change to the Banks family of London in the early twentieth century.
I:8747;1185;Every song composed by Richard and Robert Sherman is pure magic.
I:8747;1186;The believable visual effects, the heartfelt scripting, and the solid performances by Julie Andrews and the heart rendering Dick Van Dyke are truly eternal.
I:8747;1187;Every element of production came together at their zenith to create a treasure of cinematic endearment.
I:8747;1188;The supplemental material is very good and nostalgic.
I:8747;1189;One of the best films ever made.
I:8747;1190;Director, Robert Stevenson is at his best.
I:8747;1191;With the movie background it makes it more enjoyable
I:8747;1192;I now fully agree that this is the best Disney film I've seen!
I:8747;1193;"ee"" ""Spoonful of Sugar"" ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" will always get stuck inside your head!This will always be Julie Andrews best character, no matter how many films she makes."
I:8747;1194;She does a perfect job with Mary Poppins, and yet, she can really sing!
I:8747;1195;No wonder she was that good in Broadway!
I:8747;1196;I believe Walt Disney made a perfect choice to hire Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins!Dick Van Dyke ROCKS!
I:8747;1197;He's really funnier than ever, playing as Bert, and yet, he's also a great dancer!
I:8747;1198;Another perfect selection made by Walt Disney!The Special Effects were PERFECT!
I:8747;1199;It's no doubt the best set I've ever seen.
I:8747;1200;Also, I was really surprised when they wanted this to look like a Broadway stage!
I:8747;1201;The fireworks sounds were perfect on the 5.1 mixed edition!
I:8747;1202;While having an okay title, this short was very good.
I:8747;1203;The video was so enchanting, that I couldn't see a single scratch!
I:8747;1204;This is a must see movie .
I:8747;1205;the color is just beautiful.
I:8747;1206;Absoloutly innocent and adorable fun that the whole family will love.
I:8747;1207;there is so many great and important lessons too in the film.
I:8747;1208;Another great lesson comes from Burts job as a chimney sweep.
I:8747;1209;That is only a few of the great messages this movie delivers.
I:8747;1210;dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews are amazing in Mary Poppins and show great chemistry.
I:8747;1211;You can really tell how much love they put into this masterpiece.
I:8747;1212;This was for a Christmas gift.
I:8747;1213;I received this movie the day after Christmas.
I:8747;1214;I am not the biggest fan of this movie for personal taste but my friend LOVES this movies and loved it for her gift.
I:8747;1215;It's the classic Disney movie of all time!
I:8747;1216;Beautiful color and picture and sound.
I:8747;1217;Loved watching as a kid and even more fun watching the faces of my grandchildren as they enjoyed it!!
I:8747;1218;To be able to share the movie with my grandkids was pure joy.
I:8747;1219;One of the first movies I ever saw as a kid, just love the combination of human actors and cartoon and the great sing.
I:8747;1220;With the fabulously talented Julie Andrews and the crazy, hilarious antics of Dick Vandyke, how could you not love this movie.
I:8747;1221;I would highly recommend this movie to all new dads .
I:8747;1222;It is truly fun and emotional.
I:8747;1223;It definitely has a moral.
I:8747;1224;She absolutely loves it and has watched it multiple times since receiving it for Christmas.
I:8747;1225;She loves to dance and sing along with the songs.
I:8747;1226;This will always be a classic movie with great memories of Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins and Dick Van Dyke as Bert and the other surprising character.
I:8747;1227;Our little ones absolutely love this movie.
I:8747;1228;Thank goodness I enjoy it too because they want to watch it over and over and over!
I:8747;1229;"superman managed to succeed beyond expectations, and so does ""Mary Poppins"" on Broadway."
I:8747;1230;The movie and the show are related yet compliment each other.
I:8747;1231;how this was accomplished is chronicled in a new documentary on the new two.
I:8747;1232;and Gavin Lee discuss the process from audition to production, along with the talented artists who brought Poppins alive on stage.
I:8747;1233;"we also were able to glimpse one of the sweeps in ""Step in Time,"" the immensely talented Sean McCourt, who plays several roles in the stage Poppins as he did for years in Wicked."
I:8747;1234;the most warmhearted and reassuring thing about the new 45th Anniversary bomus material is the generous attention afforded to the cooperative relationship between Richard M. Sherman and the new songwriters, George Stiles and Anthony Drewe (Robert Sherman's health prevents the activity).
I:8747;1235;It's especially wonderful to see all three songwriters on screen, two in England, one in California, singing together.
I:8747;1236;"piece reconstruction of a ""Jolly Holiday"" excerpt."
I:8747;1237;but it still includes the wonderful audio commentary with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and Richard Sherman .
I:8747;1238;The newer two releases use this footage for a similar bonus, but it's nice to have the original.
I:8747;1239;"Whether you feel the new release is worth your while or not, I am pleased to see ""Mary Poppins"" reissued as often as possible."
I:8747;1240;This is a very important film, not a relic of the past, and reissuing brings it to the public's attention each time and hopefully introduces it to another legion of fans.
I:8747;1241;Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke give a timeless and heartfelt performance that is a must see for adults and children alike.
I:8747;1242;Every time I see this film, I see and hear something new in the production that makes this film worth watching over and again.
I:8747;1243;We bought this because we saw Mr Banks movie and it is a great follow up as there are lots of references that you don't know about until you watch this
I:8747;1244;I may be more critical about great sound than most, so take my review with a grain of salt.
I:8747;1245;I expect great digital separation and I did not get that.
I:8747;1246;My daughter loved Mary Poppins!
I:8747;1247;She can't wait to watch it again.
I:8747;1248;The acting and singing is simply divine and children love it.
I:8747;1249;An incredible feat, this first film to incorporate animation with live action.
I:8747;1250;I'd say that this is at the top of the heap of all the best and the brightest of movies.
I:8747;1251;"And after you've seen it, you'll all want to ""."
I:8747;1252;Inspiring, romantic, and it makes you feel good, too.
I:8747;1253;When I tried to play the movie I got the message that it was incompatible with my device.
I:8747;1254;"I saw it again, over the years, on T. v., ""Wizard Of Oz"" style, with commercials, although the ads never seemed to attach themselves to film the way they did with the ""Wizard"", where I can still identify the scenes where the commercials are due."
I:8747;1255;but don't let that deter you, this is a wonderful film.
I:8747;1256;i highly recommend this film for escapist entertainment, and I won't even feed a pidgeon, even in the company of children!
I:8747;1257;(They're wild animals, like the Parrots of Telegraph Hill, and Chicago.)
I:8747;1258;This is a fine film.
I:8747;1259;The movie itself is fantastic.
I:8747;1260;I think everyone will enjoy it and should watch it.
I:8747;1261;Definitely rates at least four stars though!
I:8747;1262;Brings back good memories .
I:8747;1263;It's an excellent family movie with a great cast and after seeing Saving Mr. Banks, you have to have this movie!
I:8747;1264;This got the kids laughing and giggling.
I:8747;1265;Mary elevates the father's role in the children's lives as being more important than her role.
I:8747;1266;I loved this movie as a child.
I:8747;1267;I've always loved Mary Poppins.
I:8747;1268;She's 3 and I hope she'll love it also.
I:8747;1269;It's fun to pass on movies that you enjoyed when you were little
I:8747;1270;This is an outstanding re.
I:8747;1271;release of one of the best Hollywood musicals of all time.
I:8747;1272;The technical details are great and, of course, the performances and the story are first rate.
I:8747;1273;They sing and dance, and entertaining whole family, plus movie has special effects.
I:8747;1274;I loved this movie as a kid and I love it even more now that I have kids of my own.
I:8747;1275;This film is one of the best Walt Disney ever made!!
I:8747;1276;It is hands down a brilliant piece of cinematic history!
I:8747;1277;Love this movie it is such a great classic and no matter what age you can't help but sing along.
I:8747;1278;I Loved Mary poppins as a child and I'm so excited to share a favorite of mine with my children
I:8747;1279;"with a combination of live action, animation, and song, ""Mary Poppins"" keeps the eyes of audiences of all ages glued to the screen."
I:8747;1280;"Nominated for a phenomenal 13 Academy Awards (and winning 6), this film (along with 1967's ""The Jungle Book"") kept Disney's doors open through the difficult times following Walt Disney's death."
I:8747;1281;The Sherman Brothers' songs are perfectly suited to the film and will keep you humming along long after the movie has ended.
I:8747;1282;julie Andrews gives a tour.
I:8747;1283;force performance as the titular nanny.
I:8747;1284;dick Van Dyke is terrific in the role of Bert, the jack of all trades, despite having a somewhat.
I:8747;1285;He is humble, entertaining, openhearted, and fun all around in his performance.
I:8747;1286;Step in Time is a charming dance number made fantastic by the physicality of Mr. Van Dyke and his supporting chimney sweeps.
I:8747;1287;What energetic youngster wouldn't love to dance like that?
I:8747;1288;He is also very touching in the scene with Mr. Banks/David Tomlinson.
I:8747;1289;"karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber are lovely as the two ""adorable"" children, Jane and Michael."
I:8747;1290;Their transformation during the film is truly magical.
I:8747;1291;the ineffable magic of childhood.
I:8747;1292;It's interesting to me that Jesus said that you must have the heart of a child to enter heaven.
I:8747;1293;That is a sentiment truly worth pondering.
I:8747;1294;This includes the specifics of the casting and the secret behind the stunning backgrounds.
I:8747;1295;Hollywood Goes to a World Premiere featurette serves as an interesting time capsule of the era.
I:8747;1296;This will always be enjoyed by generations to come.
I:8747;1297;Julie Andrews was the perfect choice for Maria.
I:8747;1298;Loved the extras with the film.
I:8747;1299;Disney`s best effort with Snow.
I:8747;1300;with The Wizard Of Oz, Mary Poppins is the most magical film ever produced with just as hummable tunes as Wizard .
I:8747;1301;julie Andrews is a true star and no one has ever been able 2 replace her persona.
I:8747;1302;She IS one of a kind.
I:8747;1303;U really DID deserve that Oscar for Best Actress, Julie.
I:8747;1304;She was also nominated for The Sound of Music and Victor/Victoria.
I:8747;1305;cockney accent went right up my back every time I heard it.
I:8747;1306;"Mary Poppins is absolutely brilliant, the kind of film (cliche coming) ""they don't make anymore"", a wonderful family film filled with heart, great animation, and wonderful songs."
I:8747;1307;It is rightly called Disney's crowning achievement.
I:8747;1308;And Dick Van Dyke is excellent, acting in his greatest film roles as Bert and Mr. Dawes.
I:8747;1309;dance man with great comedic timing and a way of mugging for the camera without actually appearing to do so .
I:8747;1310;Most of the rest of the cast are outstanding as well.
I:8747;1311;David Tomlinson is equally is good as Mr. Banks .
I:8747;1312;the look on his face after Bert's gentle admonishment, when his children show how much they love him by handing over the tuppence . . . that part always gets me.
I:8747;1313;But overall, a great, classic film that has withstood the changes in tastes (when was the last time they made a musical?)
I:8747;1314;I have always loved this movie, it is a feel good movie and is great for families, kids and adults.
I:8747;1315;I bought this for a family with three children and watched it with them.
I:8747;1316;If you like this kind of thing, you'll love this new release.
I:8747;1317;My family and I thoroughly enjoy watching it when we want :.)
I:8747;1318;My 4 and 5 yo boys love the songs and the dancing.
I:8747;1319;They really connected with the kids and loved the fun adventures they went on with Bert and Mary.
I:8747;1320;Always the best ever no matter how many times I watch it.
I:8747;1321;Thank you P. l. travers and Walt Disney for making dreams come true.
I:8747;1322;I had forgotten how wonderful this movie was.
I:8747;1323;I watched it today with my 6 and 7 year old and they were in love!
I:8747;1324;Julie Andrews is always brilliant and has a voice like an angel as well.
I:8747;1325;Watch it with your kids.
I:8747;1326;My entire family loves this to watch this one over and over.
I:8747;1327;It is great for all ages.
I:8747;1328;Our young granddaughters enjoy it very much.
I:8747;1329;I remember feeling so excited and thinking this is the greatest film of all time.
I:8747;1330;As an adult, I reconnect with that child's enthusiasm every time I see Mary Poppins, although the attraction I felt for Julie Andrews is better understood.
I:8747;1331;Unforgettable and a touch of true magic from Disney.
I:8747;1332;Julie Andrews will always be frozen in time for me and what a fantastic treasure she is.
I:8747;1333;I want my kids to watch it and enjoy it as much as I did and still do!
I:8747;1334;What a wonderful classic that we can share!
I:8747;1335;I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun this classic was.
I:8747;1336;This movie is truly a classic.
I:8747;1337;The animation/live scenes are especially Disney great.
I:8747;1338;this is really a great family movie that can be enjoyed by the young, old, and young at heart.
I:8747;1339;Generations of my family have enjoyed the movie countless times over the years.
I:8747;1340;Now I have one to keep for my great.
I:8747;1341;It was easy to order up the movie, we had no issues at all streaming it through our DSL connection, the price was right, and the movie was a huge hit with the whole family.
I:8747;1342;I have always loved this movie .
I:8747;1343;now able to share it with my granddaughter!
I:8747;1344;Just as magical as I remembered as a kid .
I:8747;1345;I watched this with my 8 year old (her first time) this last weekend and we both enjoyed it immensely.
I:8747;1346;This is truly a movie made for kids, but also to be enjoyed by adults.
I:8747;1347;I loved the excitment and suspense.
I:8747;1348;I love when they go into the picture.
I:8747;1349;You can't watch a single one that doesn't have violence, sexual innuendos, or some kind of stupid plot, but this is imagination at its best.
I:8747;1350;Funny, clean, makes the imagination flow.
I:8747;1351;All the singing is wonderful.
I:8747;1352;The Sound of Music and Chitty Chitty BAng Bang are all equally as good.
I:8747;1353;I've loved this movie since I first saw it as a young child!
I:8747;1354;It is still delightful and never gets old!
I:8747;1355;I knew many of the songs and references to the film, but I never had a desire to see it.
I:8747;1356;Her remarkable voice is a true gift and I could start putting songs I have heard into context.
I:8747;1357;Then something truly magical takes place.
I:8747;1358;He loves to laugh and the more he laughs, the more weightless he becomes and he floats to the ceiling.
I:8747;1359;His joyous laughter becomes infectious and soon Bert and the kids are floating with laughter much to the chargin of Mary Poppins.
I:8747;1360;Here was the turning point and the rest of the film seemed delightful.
I:8747;1361;He was always the innovator and I can only imagine how the eyes of young children lit up seeing this magical spectacle on the big screen in 1964.
I:8747;1362;Dick Van Dyke's dance with animated penguins is a charmer.
I:8747;1363;It's Van Dyke's physical comedy that fills the screen.
I:8747;1364;lovely and young and beautiful, her songs are full of life and zest.
I:8747;1365;"No nonsense ""practically perfect"" Mary Poppins puts on a serious face but you know she loves the Banks children and her roll in bringing the family together."
I:8747;1366;Stern Mr. Banks melts into joy with his children and Mary Poppins brings the family together.
I:8747;1367;She makes it all look effortless.
I:8747;1368;mARY POPPINS was off to a slow start with me and I went with the flow and was led into a delightful fantasy.
I:8747;1369;My daughter, 10, saw it for the first time and loved it.
I:8747;1370;This movie is, in my opinion, quite possibly the greatest movie ever made.
I:8747;1371;Truly magical, timeless, endlessly entertaining.
I:8747;1372;It's got songs, dancing, laughing, crying, animation, live action, special effects, great acting (minus Dick Van Dyke's attempted `cockney accent'), and a great story.
I:8747;1373;Walt Disney's finest cinematic achievement, at least while he was living, and his most deliberate work of `magic.'
I:8747;1374;Even my five and three year olds still loved it.
I:8747;1375;It's got it all for a great family movie night experience.
I:8747;1376;Just a delight for the entire family!
I:8747;1377;What a joy to see this in all its original splendor.
I:8747;1378;Blu ray and 7.1 sound are perfect.
I:8747;1379;Watching it on my laptop via Amazon Prime for $3.99 was perfect .
I:8747;1380;She has also, always liked all the Disney films.
I:8747;1381;This is an excellent movie.
I:8747;1382;It is a classic that everyone must have.
I:8747;1383;I am very happy to own this wonderful movie.
I:8747;1384;I definitely recommend this to everybody.
I:8747;1385;A great film for all the family but, as an Englishman, I am outraged by Dick Van Dyke's 'accent'.
I:8747;1386;A wonderful piece of cinema history that probably couldn't be made today because the actors are so classy.
I:8747;1387;This has something for everyone and I could watch it over and over.
I:8747;1388;Julie Andrews is superb, but the production is rather dated.
I:8747;1389;Wonderful story , especially interesting having just seen saving Mr. Banks .
I:8747;1390;Childhood classic that my wife had never seen before.
I:8747;1391;It was fun to watch it with her and relive some childhood memories.
I:8747;1392;I enjoy watching the classics with my daughter.
I:8747;1393;I think they have some good lessons and are fun to watch.
I:8747;1394;The music was great, Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke (despite a rotten accent) were great.
I:8747;1395;It is one of the few movies I can watch over and over.
I:8747;1396;The story is wonderful, and in my opinion even though it is often times lumped in with family movies instead of musicals, it has to be one of the best musicals ever made.
I:8747;1397;The little children were wonderful as well.
I:8747;1398;on my personal top list of all time I rate it #15So get this movie and watch it again and again and again!
I:8747;1399;Julie Andrews won the 1965 Academy Award for Best Actress in this delighful musical adaptation of the popular British children's books.
I:8747;1400;As Poppins, she is magnificent.
I:8747;1401;Sure, she's the nanny we'd all love to have.
I:8747;1402;The rest of the cast, Dick Van Dyke, Karen Dotrice, Glynis Johns, David Tomlinson, Matthew Garber and Ed Wynn, also add to the fun.
I:8747;1403;Nontheless, it's just as entertaining as it was way back when.
I:8747;1404;I have always loved Mary Poppins and now so does my four year old daughter.
I:8747;1405;We love all the Disney movies.
I:8747;1406;After watching Saving Mr. Banks I absolutely had to have it!
I:8747;1407;My nieces are really enjoying the movie and it is great to pass down the tradition.
I:8747;1408;I was super excited to find this movie!
I:8747;1409;As most Disney movies, it was fun, heart.
I:8747;1410;warming, and we still catch each other humming or whistling the tunes around the house.
I:8747;1411;an ear worm, it is!
I:8747;1412;Mary Poppins is a wonderful movie for all ages.
I:8747;1413;I loved watching it again.
I:8747;1414;My daughter loved the music and dancing.
I:8747;1415;I had forgotten how much fun it was!
I:8747;1416;Worked great for the party I had.
I:8747;1417;Teachers at the party were able to use this in their classrooms!
I:8747;1418;We recently saw Saving Mr. Banks which is also a good movie telling how Mary Poppins was born .
I:8747;1419;They will have to be seen together so you can see how the movie came about through the hard struggle Walt Disney had getting the rights to the story of this delightful nanny.
I:8747;1420;He started singing just and spoon full of sugar and saying spit spot all the time.
I:8747;1421;Its a great classic movie for kids and adults.
I:8747;1422;With full aditional features you can enjoy and remember your chilhood with the olds and greats Julie And Dick.
I:8747;1423;This is THE Disney classic that fuses live action performances with great animation.
I:8747;1424;Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are superb and perfect.
I:8747;1425;It's a wonderful film with a great message and will entertain kids as well as adults.
I:8747;1426;I love the way she introduces herself and i love her confidence.
I:8747;1427;she will not be dominated by anyone and in this magical story Mary Poppins is the greatest childrens character ever.
I:8747;1428;The picture is crisp and clear and the colour is vivid.
I:8747;1429;i'm glad i was able to download so i can now share it with my kids.
I:8747;1430;A great classic for the kids.
I:8747;1431;The music was great, the kids enjoyed singing along.
I:8747;1432;And today, I in turn shared this wonderful film with my own 5 year old daughter.
I:8747;1433;My family enjoyed watching this timeless movie.
I:8747;1434;It was great to see their faces light up as the movie progressed.
I:8747;1435;I highly recommend watching this movie.
I:8747;1436;My lil sister and i sat right in front of the television and watched Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dike serenade us with fun musical lyrics.
I:8747;1437;Good memories of my childhood.
I:8747;1438;This is my favorite musical of all time.
I:8747;1439;It's wonderfully done, and the story is excellent.
I:8747;1440;Julie Andrews did a great job in her first ever cinematic role, she plays a magical nanny that comes to a rich man's house in order to bring the family back together.
I:8747;1441;What I love about her performance is that she looks very confident and so straight forward and firm, not as playful as you may think.
I:8747;1442;The film also has Dick Van Dyke in the role of Bert, who is a very good friend of Mary Poppins and also handles magic very well.
I:8747;1443;That role was funny and very entertaining(the accent is a bit confusing though), and i loved all of his dance numbers, especially Step In Time, the dance on the roof.
I:8747;1444;Another excellent performance was David Tomlinson, who did the role of George Banks, the father of the children.
I:8747;1445;His song The Life I Lead was also great.
I:8747;1446;This film was prized with five well.
I:8747;1447;deserved Academy Awards, for the excellent Film Editing, the Visual Effects, like the jump into the pavement picture, the tea party on the ceiling and the smoke ladder, the excellent score, the song Chim Chim Cheree, which may have not been the best song, but one of them had to win, and last but not least, the excellent (oscar.
I:8747;1448;winning) performance by Julie Andrews.
I:8747;1449;My kids loved this movie as much as I did when I was little.
I:8747;1450;Pure fun, clean and catchy songs, the best!
I:8747;1451;A perfect accompaniment to Saving Mr. Banks!
I:8747;1452;A feel good movie for all ages!
I:8747;1453;Love the story and the songs and the ending!
I:8747;1454;Even though this is an extremely long movie by present standards, it moves right along, is packed with fantastic, classic songs, amusing scenes, and even touching, poignant parts which will move you, zinging straight to your heart.
I:8747;1455;it has much to do with having fun as you do things you ought to be doing.
I:8747;1456;It has to do with caring for other people's feelings, and also for taking a day off when you are least expecting to and having a fantastic adventure!
I:8747;1457;"chimminee"" are all so famous and so beloved it is quit easy to call up their tunes at a moment's notice, I expect."
I:8747;1458;It is touching, and charming.
I:8747;1459;Dick Van Dyke is fantastic as the appealing foil to Julie Andrews' character.
I:8747;1460;"Another charming and superbly played part is that of Ed Wynn's in the scene which includes the song ""I Love to Laugh""."
I:8747;1461;That is a great scene in every way!
I:8747;1462;"Incredible!The children and their family are beautifully cast
I:8747;1463;The movie is extremely well rounded.
I:8747;1464;There is dancing, singing, and fantasy galore.
I:8747;1465;You will love this movie!
I:8747;1466;old granddaughter and she loves it She loves musicals.
I:8747;1467;She loves to dance and sing along.
I:8747;1468;A movie that Grandma likes.
I:8747;1469;I loved this movie when I was a teen.
I:8747;1470;Now I enjoy it even more with my grandchildren.
I:8747;1471;The movie plays fine .
I:8747;1472;I will do my best to explain why it wasn't ranked higher.
I:8747;1473;First is that we liked 22 other movies better.
I:8747;1474;All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad.
I:8747;1475;Pete's Dragon 3, Beauty and the beast 4, Sleeping Beauty 5, Snow White 6, Robin Hood 7, 101 Dalmatians 8, Fox and the hound 9, Cinderella is 10th, Rescuers 11, Hunchback of ND 12, Aladdin 13, Aladdin King of Thieves 14, Jungle Book 15, Little Mermaid 16, Hercules 17, Winnie the Pooh 18, Rescuers Down Under 19, Sword in the Stone 20, Pinocchio 21 and Mulan 22.
I:8747;1476;A great movie to watch.
I:8747;1477;I highly recommend it to anyone.
I:8747;1478;I got it on Blu.
I:8747;1479;The story and extras are nice and make me want to see the stage play.
I:8747;1480;Love this classic movie, and my 3 and 1/2 year old daughter loves it too.
I:8747;1481;Brought back many childhood memories while watching with kids!
I:8747;1482;It was more interesting now as a grownup!
I:8747;1483;This was a Christmas gift, so thank you for the quick delivery and excellent condition.
I:8747;1484;I love this movie, and I love how easy it is to get my digital copy through Amazon.
I:8747;1485;I definitely recommend using Amazon for getting Disney digital movies.
I:8747;1486;I bought this for my 5 year.
I:8747;1487;It has been remastered, and the visual and audio upgrades are great.
I:8747;1488;A wonderful addition to any Disney video collection.
I:8747;1489;They would dance to the songs, ask questions that don't make sense in today's culture, and really just enjoyed it.
I:8747;1490;My husband and I hadn't seen it in at least 30 years, so it was nice catching up with Mary and Bert.
I:8747;1491;I hope Amazon will give this some major attention soon, as I'm unlikely to use the service much until I can actually tell what the movie is saying!
I:8747;1492;The price is right too!
I:8747;1493;one of my favorite all time movies .
I:8747;1494;Just as good as the first time I saw it.
I:8747;1495;Grandchildren totally enjoyed the music and the movie.
I:8747;1496;Adults enjoyed watching Mary Poppins again, after seeing the movie Saving Mr. Banks .
I:8747;1497;He laughed and sang right along with us.
I:8747;1498;I also noticed how calm and happy he was afterward.
I:8747;1499;Julie Andrews voice is good to hear on occasions.
I:8747;1500;"Got this for my wife, who liked it
I:8747;1501;We had a flawless transaction on this one.
I:8747;1502;Plus, what a great classic.
I:8747;1503;My wife loves Disney movies and this is one of her all time favorites, so it made a great gift.
I:8747;1504;Mary Poppins was and still is a great movie musical for the whole family.
I:8747;1505;The show teaches a great lesson and allows for many laughs.
I:8747;1506;Who can say anything bad about this delightful film.
I:8747;1507;Especially neat after seeing Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;1508;It was most delightful in a whole new way.
I:8747;1509;When you consider this is the 50th anniversary for Mary Poppins, the animation and special effects for that time are excellent.
I:8747;1510;julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke do a great job in their roles.
I:8747;1511;Also, the music by the Shermans is superb.
I:8747;1512;Still a must see for small kids!
I:8747;1513;My Child loved the kids, the singing, and of course, Mary Poppins!
I:8747;1514;This is a great movie .
I:8747;1515;children are more important than adults, the family is more important than the job (or cause), and good behavior is important, but so is having fun.
I:8747;1516;i think it is fair to say that .
I:8747;1517;the better a movie is, the more times we will watch it.
I:8747;1518;And Mary Poppins ranks high in that department.
I:8747;1519;practically perfect in every way.
I:8747;1520;thank you Walt Disney for giving us this movie.
I:8747;1521;"a lot of people do good work for ""Mary Poppins"" and it's hard to pick one who might be called the MVP of the movie."
I:8747;1522;Glynis Johns is fun as Mrs. Banks .
I:8747;1523;funny in just about everything she does.
I:8747;1524;His guiding hand ensured that we got a perfect .
I:8747;1525;movie to be enjoyed for generations.
I:8747;1526;Those wonderful songs are .
I:8747;1527;Also, they (the Sherman bros.) helped write the screenplay (uncredited) and came up with many of the key ideas that comprise the story.
I:8747;1528;mrs. Banks: As a matter of fact, since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing seems to have come over the household.
I:8747;1529;It fits very nicely into the movie.
I:8747;1530;jane, after measuring Mary Poppins, is seen rising up.
I:8747;1531;Somebody had to think of doing that, and it works nicely.
I:8747;1532;in the cartoon sequence, one of the baby swans is made to do a sort.
I:8747;1533;A nice touch, I think.
I:8747;1534;"after singing ""Feed the Birds"" Mary Poppins gently brushes the side of Jane's head."
I:8747;1535;the edge of Jane's is seen as the bank guard grabs for her.
I:8747;1536;A clock can be heard chiming in the background, and it chimes nine times.
I:8747;1537;"a CURIOUS THINGLate in the movie, when Ellen (the maid) dances up and says ""It's the master!"""
I:8747;1538;It's a magnificent musical with a perfect cast and a rousing musical score.
I:8747;1539;ray edition is positively stunning.
I:8747;1540;took my wife and I back in time.
I:8747;1541;loved it and so do the grandkid!!!
I:8747;1542;I want to share this classic with my grandsons.
I:8747;1543;I hope they will love it as much as I remember loving it.
I:8747;1544;It is fun and silly, the music is singable and memorable.
I:8747;1545;Traditional values, fun, and JA is awesome, what a great voice!
I:8747;1546;The mom and dad, are great actors, just saw a movie that they were both I as very young actors, it was on netflix Miranda she is a mermaid and he is a suitor.
I:8747;1547;Loved this movie when I was younger and still do.
I:8747;1548;A classic musical for all ages!!
I:8747;1549;Saw Mary Poppins again this week after watching the terrific new Tom Hanks movie, Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;1550;The movie was pure magic when I first saw it in 1964, it's still fun and brings me back to when my firends and I saw it for my 9th b. day party.
I:8747;1551;Highly recommend watching Saving Mr. Banks, then Mary Poppins, for the rest of the story.
I:8747;1552;I loved it so much, I begged him to sit through TWO more showings!
I:8747;1553;"He must have liked it too or just wanted to give my Mom some ""alone time,"" because he agreed to watch it two more times."
I:8747;1554;my own daughter loved it as much when she was a little girl so it has a special place in my heart!
I:8747;1555;The sound and color are so vivid .
I:8747;1556;they must have really worked some Mary Poppins magic to bring such clarity and color to this 45+ year old film!My family loved reading all of the pop.
I:8747;1557;ups that gave us little trivial insights into the actors, scenes, costumes, etc., This is a beautiful family musical that is just as entertaining today as it was over four decades ago.
I:8747;1558;It's no wonder that it received 13 Oscar nominations and won five including Best Movie and Best leading Actress (this went to Julie Andrews and Mary Poppins was her first starring role).
I:8747;1559;It has some amazing features on how the movie and scenes were made and commentary by Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, and others.
I:8747;1560;I watched this again for the first time in 30 years and it was still a gem.
I:8747;1561;Another timeless classic with two great actors, Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews.
I:8747;1562;A must see for children, and the scenery and animated parts make it a family film that will leave great impressions with your kids.
I:8747;1563;I find this movie one of many G rated family entertainment movies.
I:8747;1564;I love this movie, and now it is my three.year.
I:8747;1565;My friend loves it and was excited to receive it as a gift.
I:8747;1566;This movie is magical classic.
I:8747;1567;My 3 sons grew up with Mary Poppins, learning each and every line to the songs and script.
I:8747;1568;Our granddaughter sings to the music, knows each scene and hushes us as not to miss a particular song.
I:8747;1569;I was thrilled to finally see this movie come out in Blu.
I:8747;1570;ray which I will be adding to my blu.
I:8747;1571;We all watched it over the holiday break and it looked fantastic.
I:8747;1572;I guess it pays to know people.
I:8747;1573;It is a wonderful musical to share with the children.
I:8747;1574;(Even grownups love the music.
I:8747;1575;But who cares, this is one kids' film that everyone loves.
I:8747;1576;Definitely a must see movie.
I:8747;1577;A good family (all ages) movie that will keep the interest of all who watch
I:8747;1578;Saw Saving Mr. Banks and wanted to see the real deal.
I:8747;1579;My nieces and my wife were glued to the movie.
I:8747;1580;It still is very entertaining and half the fun is watching the kids watch it!
I:8747;1581;"A film by Robert Stevenson""Mary Poppins"" is one of the most beloved movies of all time, and for good reason."
I:8747;1582;This truly is a magical film.
I:8747;1583;It is a mixture of live action and animation and is a wonderful musical and is quite possibly the perfect family film.
I:8747;1584;Nominated for 13 Academy Awards and it was the winner of 5, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews in her feature film debut.
I:8747;1585;Mary Poppins is the story of, well, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews).
I:8747;1586;"As a nanny, Mary Poppins is ""practically perfect""."
I:8747;1587;The lives and experiences of the children are about to change because there is something magical about Mary.
I:8747;1588;With a song and a dance amazing things happen around Mary.
I:8747;1589;She can clean up a room with nothing more than a snap of the fingers and can take a journey into a picture drawn with chalk on a sidewalk.
I:8747;1590;and live action to create a magical world that is an incredible change from the London that Jane and Matthew think they know.
I:8747;1591;There are excellent acting performances and the over the top Dick Van Dyke is charming in how sweet he is.
I:8747;1592;The whole movie is sweet, charming, funny, and fantastic.
I:8747;1593;This is a highly recommended musical for the whole family
I:8747;1594;It's delightful and a great escape.
I:8747;1595;Highly recommend this movie for 3 years and up.
I:8747;1596;Mary Poppins film is a classic you cannot miss.
I:8747;1597;It's a family film that will enjoy everybody with a child heart.
I:8747;1598;ray version and thoroughly enjoyed it!
I:8747;1599;I was also very impressed with the technology used in this film half a century ago.
I:8747;1600;I found Dick Van Dyke's attempted dialect work more entertaining than irritating.
I:8747;1601;"A week after viewing this, I saw ""Saving Mr. Banks"" with Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks and having just seen ""Mary Poppins,"" it made seeing ""Saving Mr. Banks"" all the more enjoyable."
I:8747;1602;It was great to see Dick Van Dyke doing his dance with the penguins after learning what had taken place behind the scenes!
I:8747;1603;In that respect, 'Mary Poppins' works admirably.
I:8747;1604;Disney's triumph expertly blends live.
I:8747;1605;"action and animation, and boasts a delightful score by the Sherman Brothers, including ""A Spoonful Of Sugar"", ""Chim."
I:8747;1606;The real draw of course is the irresistible Andrews, who won the Oscar in her first starring role.
I:8747;1607;Best for younger children, and young.
I:8747;1608;As my heading says, I was very impressed with this edition.
I:8747;1609;Good Life Lessons presented in a humorous way.
I:8747;1610;this is a must to share with children.
I:8747;1611;Great Movie to add to your Kindle Library!
I:8747;1612;having just seen saving Mr. banks I saw this movie in a whole new light.
I:8747;1613;I love back stories and Mr. banks sure added to this.
I:8747;1614;the blu ray is excellent.
I:8747;1615;make sure you see the bonus features they are very interesting.
I:8747;1616;Really it's Mary Poppins what more do you need to say.
I:8747;1617;It's a jolly holiday with Mary!
I:8747;1618;Julie Andrews and dick van Dyke at their best.
I:8747;1619;something your grand children will enjoy if you have them or if you ever will.
I:8747;1620;This movie is also a classic great for the entire family.
I:8747;1621;It can change an Adult into a kid and make a kid into a great Adult.
I:8747;1622;I was privileged to be able to watch it between 80 and 90 times while it was in its first run.
I:8747;1623;Watching it again now, brought back those memories and rekindled my enjoyment of the whole experience.
I:8747;1624;Mary Poppins is one of those classic musicals that you probably loved as a kid, then think you outgrew.
I:8747;1625;until you show it to your own kids (or yourself) and happily sing along.
I:8747;1626;That's what I found on viewing this Disney masterpiece for the first time in decades.
I:8747;1627;already a Broadway/ West End star, and here an Oscar winner right out of the gate.
I:8747;1628;became a beloved institution as the world's most famous nanny.
I:8747;1629;A host of Brits both veteran (foppish David Tomlinson and vibrant Glynis Johns) and young (the button.
I:8747;1630;cute Karen Dotrice and the late Matthew Garber) fill out the excellent cast, probably the best in any live.
I:8747;1631;"cheree"" (an Oscar winner on its own), the still."
I:8747;1632;"haunting ""Feed The Birds"" and, of course, that busker."
I:8747;1633;"director Robert Stevenson (""Swiss Family Robinson"",""Treasure Island"") and artist Peter Ellenshaw (his gorgeous title painting of Olde London Towne)."
I:8747;1634;who really did transport you back in time along with the cast and songs.
I:8747;1635;the bonus material, as you'd expect for a true classic, is superb.
I:8747;1636;Just about all of the surviving principals are part of the extras and commentary, which include two delightful musical segments with songwriter Dick Sherman.
I:8747;1637;One of these brings back Julie and Dick to reminisce and sing their songs.
I:8747;1638;"On his own, Sherman reveals the inspiration for the tunes (""Step In Time"" was adapted from the music."
I:8747;1639;"There are moving moments, too: Sherman on how ""Feed The Birds"" moved Walt like no other song
I:8747;1640;Not many movies can stir such emotions, happy and sad, 40 years on.
I:8747;1641;A wonderful package for a wonderful musical.
I:8747;1642;Disney has done a clean.
I:8747;1643;up job on the film that makes it shine.
I:8747;1644;The audio is rich and wonderful, including the all.
I:8747;1645;important ORIGINAL stereo soundtrack (feh to multi.
I:8747;1646;"disc release, Disney Studios finally ""got it right."""
I:8747;1647;The 5.1 Surround Mix is superb and the sound engineers have equalized the voices during the songs that contained dialogue that was dubbed into the sequence, so now it is hardly noticeable.
I:8747;1648;The Disney Home Theater Stereo Mix is even better than the original stereophonic theatrical release.
I:8747;1649;It was just thrilling to watch the opening credits and see the actual care and love gone into cleaning up the original artwork.
I:8747;1650;Mary Poppins, in my opinion, has always been the best film Walt Disney ever produced, and the care he took in producing it is evident in the casting (especially the cameo roles).
I:8747;1651;"Robert Stevenson's direction is classic and unobtrusive
I:8747;1652;It is no wonder this film won 5 Academy Awards, mostly for technical achievements and the music, and of course one big one for Best Actress to Julie Andrews in her film debut!
I:8747;1653;This allows me to watch my movies on more devices.
I:8747;1654;I enjoy watching them with her.
I:8747;1655;Great family movie with an inspiring message of love and forgiveness.
I:8747;1656;I strongly recommend this movie for everyone to watch.
I:8747;1657;Such a wonderful movie, so much deep meaning.
I:8747;1658;Our children and grandchildren love it almost as much as we do.
I:8747;1659;This is one of my top ten movies of all time.
I:8747;1660;I love the songs, the script, and particularly Dick Van Dyck's performance.
I:8747;1661;Likely one of the greatest collection of hit songs in one movie ever.
I:8747;1662;a few is all it takes for something like this.
I:8747;1663;The songs are really wonderful and touching.
I:8747;1664;The children are very cute even thoguh at times they lack the personality of some other children from one of Julie's other movies made a year later.
I:8747;1665;I would recommend if you want to see a really flawless musical about a nanny watch The Sound of Music.
I:8747;1666;It is onehundred times better.
I:8747;1667;Mary Poppins however is good in its own right.
I:8747;1668;Audrey is a good actress, but let me remind you Julie's performance was superior because she acted, sang and danced and did all of them well.
I:8747;1669;Audrey got her fame from doing a lot of alright movies, but let me remind you that Julie Andrews were always be remebered for her great performance in Mary Poppins that made the movie.
I:8747;1670;And for the one movie that will live forever The Sound of Music.
I:8747;1671;I loved this movie as a child.
I:8747;1672;It was so creative and I would watch it whenever it was on TV.
I:8747;1673;I'm so happy I did.
I:8747;1674;A superb revisit (from childhood)!
I:8747;1675;Enjoy it in any format, just enjoy it already!
I:8747;1676;We enjoyed watching this as a family.
I:8747;1677;It is nice to have it available to watch instantly on amazon!
I:8747;1678;My little six year old surrogate grandson loves this movie,has memorized all the songs, and dances all the dances.
I:8747;1679;Her mother wrote that they watched one evening as a family and again the next morning, and spent the whole day singing the songs from it.
I:8747;1680;It is good, clean, delightful entertainment!
I:8747;1681;otherwise, it it a great movie for kids and adults alike.
I:8747;1682;Must have for a home with a child.
I:8747;1683;The interviews on this 40th Anniversary Edition are a very special treat for adults, too!
I:8747;1684;It was interesting to watch this again after seeing Saving Mr. Banks .
I:8747;1685;This movie was just as great as i remember it.
I:8747;1686;What a great treat to watch it with my own little ones!
I:8747;1687;They are 5 and 2 and LOVED it as much as i do!
I:8747;1688;Classic movie that everyone should enjoy.
I:8747;1689;Great special effect, especially for 1964.
I:8747;1690;Excellent to see before watching Saving Mr. Banks, which is and absolutely excellent film in all ways.
I:8747;1691;loved the ability to enjoy it for 3 days, PERFECT for the Christmas holiday.
I:8747;1692;brought back beautiful childhood memories~
I:8747;1693;"* ""I Love to Laugh"" is delightful, but again too long."
I:8747;1694;In the movie they make fun of Mrs. Banks as a suffragette, in the play/ musical she is more sympathetic.
I:8747;1695;on the other hand, Julie Andrews is *wonderful* in this.
I:8747;1696;Dick Van Dyke is great, even if his accent is terrible, it's part of the fun.
I:8747;1697;The children and the other actors are great.
I:8747;1698;The music and story is pure fun.
I:8747;1699;It's not the movie I remember, but it's still pretty darn good!
I:8747;1700;Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are fantastic.
I:8747;1701;Love the movie but the movie service was not there.
I:8747;1702;Julie Andrews is at her best.
I:8747;1703;please keep this in mind when reading these reviews.
I:8747;1704;received in excellent condition and fast !!!
I:8747;1705;LOVE U GUYS The movie is even better than I remember !
I:8747;1706;I had to rewatch this classic Disney movie after seeing Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;1707;It was just as good as I remembered from when I was a child and from when my son was little.
I:8747;1708;Great actors, great music, great story.
I:8747;1709;This is a wonderful story and message.
I:8747;1710;For the people that have a video player in their car, or a portable one, it's a great addition to the collection!
I:8747;1711;Might be a little old for under 5 yrs., but it's still a fun movie for everyone.
I:8747;1712;Wonderful story for all ages.
I:8747;1713;time favorites and I want it to be one of my [four year old] granddaughters too!
I:8747;1714;We are starting out on the right foot!
I:8747;1715;She has watched it several times, knows some of the lines in the movie already and can sing A Spoonful of Sugar and pronounce Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!!!
I:8747;1716;Pretty good start I'd say!
I:8747;1717;This movie is a classic and it was fun to watch again.
I:8747;1718;It was a great pleasure.
I:8747;1719;We all were so delighted we could find the movie so easily on Amazon.
I:8747;1720;I decided to order it for her, and it was a good decision.
I:8747;1721;It is now her favorite movie.
I:8747;1722;She loves Dick Van Dyke and the music and the humor .
I:8747;1723;"the ""real"" Mary Poppins never sang."
I:8747;1724;my grandkids loved this movie, just as my daughter did.
I:8747;1725;It brought back memories of seeing it at the show.
I:8747;1726;I guarantee, many will follow suit after seeing this new Disney release.
I:8747;1727;Mary Poppins is a wonderful movie for the entire family.
I:8747;1728;I believe that anyone who enjoys family movies with singing and dancing will enjoy this movie.
I:8747;1729;I Think that this is a great movie for little children.
I:8747;1730;My heart exploded as I realized the depth of message and nuance of beauty underpinning this film.
I:8747;1731;I was riveted throughout the fim and cannot wait to watch it again with my grandchild whom I am so sure will resonate and love it too!
I:8747;1732;We enjoyed it because we had just saw Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;1733;She always wears a hat, most often a coat.
I:8747;1734;Mary Poppins is such a good movie to share with family
I:8747;1735;Mary Poppins is whimsical and fun.
I:8747;1736;Mary Poppins is truly a Disney classic.
I:8747;1737;With a fabulous story to tell .
I:8747;1738;and the best actors ever telling the story.
I:8747;1739;it is an excellent movie, very enjoyable.
I:8747;1740;i love the music and the acting.
I:8747;1741;julie andrews is an excellent actress
I:8747;1742;mary Poppins is a wonderful musical that is appropriate for everyone .
I:8747;1743;The songs are so upbeat and fun that you'll find yourself (and everyone else watching) tapping their feet and singing along.
I:8747;1744;She is the one who's hired for this job, and she is able to give the children a sense of love and peace like they'd never known.
I:8747;1745;"She also has some ""special powers"" that enable her to create fun out of anything!!!"
I:8747;1746;Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are absolutely amazing in this movie!
I:8747;1747;They both have such a stage presence, and they mesh perfectly together.
I:8747;1748;"overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals, as well as those who are looking for a great movie for ""family night"" ."
I:8747;1749;I'm sure it will be a hit with everyone in the house!
I:8747;1750;I got this movie for my 4 year old son, because I wanted to expose him to the classics.
I:8747;1751;This movie is wonderful, if you have never seen it, it is a MUST.
I:8747;1752;But my son loves the colors and the singing.
I:8747;1753;Even more fun to watch.
I:8747;1754;This will be a family popcorn movie very often.
I:8747;1755;C. s. Lewis believed that a story worth enjoying at 10 is worth enjoying again at 50.
I:8747;1756;While I do enjoy my childhood favorites: Gone With the Wind, Little Women, and Lewis' own Narnian series, I believe I can lower the age limit and say that a story worth enjoying at 3 is worth enjoying again at 50.
I:8747;1757;I loved Mary Poppins when it was first released in the theatre, but love it more now with my adult eyes and ears.
I:8747;1758;mary Poppins is a warm happy tale, but there is also a definite conflict with a strong protagonist: Mr. Banks and pair of antagonists: Mary and Bert.
I:8747;1759;i found the extra pieces in Disc 2 very informative, and they left me wanting to see the stage show.
I:8747;1760;If Mary's room is right off the nursery, a shot of her getting up to get Michael and Jane a glass of water (or telling them to quiet down for the night), with her hair in a braid, or completely down, like that of a faerie tale princess, as she teaches Jane proper hair care, would make Mary more realistic, while at the same time enhancing the charming magic of this timeless tale.
I:8747;1761;I needed some great family movies so ordered this as it is one of the best ever made and fun for all ages.
I:8747;1762;I understand this version is nearly identical to the last release from five years ago which celebrated the 40th anniversary of this charming film.
I:8747;1763;This time they have included nearly an hours worth of additional material documenting the wildly successful broadway production.
I:8747;1764;I have enjoyed this movie for years and now my family runs when I put it on (smile) but I LOVE it!
I:8747;1765;In the meantime I'll hold onto the 40th Anniversary edition.
I:8747;1766;My kids (6.8 y. o) loved it.
I:8747;1767;I had forgotten a lot of the movie since I was a kid, so it was entertaining for me as well.
I:8747;1768;The last third of the viewing was great, but we had a lot of interruptions in the first 2/3rds of the movie.
I:8747;1769;The movie gets a five star, the service provider gets the one star!
I:8747;1770;There were so many parts that I did not remember but I loved every minute of it.
I:8747;1771;This is the all time perfect family movie that EVERYBODY loves and have loved for generations.
I:8747;1772;It is a very good movie!
I:8747;1773;A classic and my kids love to watch it!
I:8747;1774;Fun for the whole family!
I:8747;1775;Have always loved this movie!!!
I:8747;1776;I love this movie and this edition was perfect for all the background information and still being able to enjoy the movie.
I:8747;1777;"Now my girls are in love with ""Miss Mary Poppins"" as much as I am!"
I:8747;1778;I am of the age that I saw this movie when it first premiered, and I have always loved its family.
I:8747;1779;first themes and delightful music.
I:8747;1780;He is still humming the tunes and wondering when we will have time to fly our kite together!
I:8747;1781;I would highly recommend it as a wonderful video for the entire family to enjoy on movie night.
I:8747;1782;One of our all time favorites and a great reminder that a simple spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down!
I:8747;1783;It is a wonderful story, made even more wonderful by the background story of Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;1784;This is still a great classic that we sat down and watched with family and friends.
I:8747;1785;I enjoyed listening to the teenagers sing along with it.
I:8747;1786;disney fans will love this Edition.
I:8747;1787;a Disney movie fan will fine Mary Poppins as fun as a Disneyland ride!
I:8747;1788;Mr. Van Dyke, is Great in Mary Poppins.
I:8747;1789;Love this movie and so do the grand.
I:8747;1790;If you like singing, dancing, life lessons, and have an imagination this is for you
I:8747;1791;It's as wonderful now as I remember it.
I:8747;1792;Teaches kids key lessons in a humorous way.
I:8747;1793;Enjoyed it and wanted to watch it again.
I:8747;1794;a spoonful of sugar helps.
I:8747;1795;It's gonna be one of my favorites.
I:8747;1796;Ages 5.8, but good for all ages.
I:8747;1797;ray release came out looking wonderful.
I:8747;1798;As a behind the scenes feature watcher, I was pleasantly surprised to watch both memebers of the Disney family and some of the people involved in the original release as part of the special release.
I:8747;1799;I got this movie,I also love their clothes in the movie.
I:8747;1800;Mary Poppins was and still is the best movie.
I:8747;1801;Julie Anrews was perfect as Mary Poppins.
I:8747;1802;We recorded it many years ago and was so excited when I heard it was coming out on the anniversary.
I:8747;1803;This classic movie was wonderful when my children were young and can still capture the attention of my grandchildren!It's entertaining and leaves all with a feeling of wellbeing!
I:8747;1804;Wonderful and magical story for the young of all ages.
I:8747;1805;Disney outdid himself when he combined real actors and places with animated subjects.
I:8747;1806;This is a classic wonderful story .
I:8747;1807;Great movie for the whole family.
I:8747;1808;After watching this movie, all i hear is a spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down The kids love to sing the songs from the movie.
I:8747;1809;The bonus features have a sing along section on the Blu.
I:8747;1810;And I personally, enjoy longer movies when the story is so good it makes the time go by quickly.
I:8747;1811;Mary Poppins, my wifes absolutely favorite movie.
I:8747;1812;The bonus features are nothing shy of amazing.
I:8747;1813;Great job by Disney for releasing this on Blu.
I:8747;1814;ray in such a fantastic form
I:8747;1815;Great movie after having watched the new Saving Mr. Banks movie that is out in theaters.
I:8747;1816;I enjoyed the upgraded movie in preparation for Mr. Banks.
I:8747;1817;Did a great job for remembering the background for new movie.
I:8747;1818;It allows you to immerse yourself in a simpler time when magic still seems like a possibility.
I:8747;1819;Substantially Original, as well as Best Music, Song.
I:8747;1820;It also won a number of other awards including Golden Globes, Grammys and BAFTAs.
I:8747;1821;Mary Poppins, together with her friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a local street musician and chimney sweep, proceeds to take the children through a magical journey.
I:8747;1822;Along the way she teaches George something about his values, and what the truly important things in his life are.
I:8747;1823;mary Poppins showcases excellent performance by all the leading players, and is a classic movie by any standard.
I:8747;1824;She takes her charges, Jane and Michael, on exciting adventures in and around London, and even melts the heart of their fuddy.
I:8747;1825;"the movie has a great soundtrack
I:8747;1826;Julie Andrews is the perfect magical nanny, and Dick Van Dyke is endearing as the multi.
I:8747;1827;This is a very classy movie with singing, dancing, some animation, and family values.
I:8747;1828;Great gift for anyone from 2.72.
I:8747;1829;Brings back memories when I was a kid.
I:8747;1830;I will watch this perdiodically, and enjoy it over and over again for a long time to come!
I:8747;1831;It was especially good after having watched Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;1832;This Disney movie is a classic that is worth watching over and over.
I:8747;1833;a bit of Mary Poppins makes it all better.
I:8747;1834;Still a good message for us.
I:8747;1835;I will enjoy watching this movie again and again.
I:8747;1836;It brings back memories from my childhood.
I:8747;1837;1964 was a very strong year for film, Becket, The Fall of the Roman Empire, My Fair Lady and Mary Poppins just to name a few.
I:8747;1838;So far I have seen three of the Best Picture nominees.
I:8747;1839;becket, My Fair Lady and Mary Poppins.
I:8747;1840;My Fair Lady and Mary Poppins swept up most of the trophies while Becket snunk in between them and got one.
I:8747;1841;Perhaps since this was the year after the Great American Tragedy, the audiences found light hearted musicals a more welcome escape from reality than a serious costume drama tragedy.
I:8747;1842;Mary Poppins is definetly one of the strongest of the genre.
I:8747;1843;The 'outside' scenes are obviously not really outside and some scenes go on too long like the laughter sequence and carousel race, but it's an absorbing film filled with great songs and dialogue (mostly from Mary herself) crackling with wit and spark.
I:8747;1844;i have always loved Julie Andrews.
I:8747;1845;She works wonders with whatever role she plays.
I:8747;1846;but she certaintly has a very distinct signature persona.
I:8747;1847;Mary Poppins is cheerful, strong, good.
I:8747;1848;She has her strengths (cheerful, good.
I:8747;1849;hearted, pious) and weaknesses (outspokeness, flighty disposition.)
I:8747;1850;His particular brand of Quixotic charm (dancing with penguins and the laughter sequence) wore off on me after an hour.
I:8747;1851;Glynis Johns gives a wonderful performance as the flighty, eccentric, suffragette mother (the jokes poking fun at feminism during her first scene are a riot) and manages to be funny without getting annoying.
I:8747;1852;nonsense father and his 180 degree personality turn at the climax is one of the film's finest moments.
I:8747;1853;there is one more performance worth mentioning that is rather un.
I:8747;1854;sung but one of the best in my opinion: Hermione Baddeley as Ellen, the middle.
I:8747;1855;I love the funny faces she makes in the first few scenes:1.
I:8747;1856;The grand piano slams into Ellen.
I:8747;1857;The crossed eyes and grimace on her face when she delivers this line is PRICELESS.2.
I:8747;1858;They are all gone so she gives her message to the dog.3.
I:8747;1859;the visual effects won a richly deserved oscar.
I:8747;1860;Even by today's standards they are very impressive.1.
I:8747;1861;When Mary, Bert, Jane and Michael jump into the chalk picture on the ground.
I:8747;1862;And of course the combination of real.
I:8747;1863;life people and animated figures.
I:8747;1864;ree won Best Song that year.
I:8747;1865;It is the heart and soul of the movie.
I:8747;1866;An all time classic Disney movie that everyone should have in their Disney library.
I:8747;1867;My 3 1/2 year son loves it, we sing the songs all the time.
I:8747;1868;A good reminder of how important children are!!
I:8747;1869;This is one that we'll be adding to our permanent collection, a true classic!
I:8747;1870;I love this movie, it is a great feel good movie to watch when you need a little lift me up.
I:8747;1871;The picture was sharp and clear.
I:8747;1872;We had a great time watching the movie.
I:8747;1873;Great classic that my 6 y/o daughter loves.
I:8747;1874;The movie was new and sealed.
I:8747;1875;Here, I will repeat what I said since you want me to waste my time:The grandkids love it!
I:8747;1876;This is a great movie for the family it will put a smile and laughter in everyone.
I:8747;1877;So holiday movie going was ideal for the 12.24 year old demographic.
I:8747;1878;"the recent release of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" helped to refuel interest in Miss Poppins, the original pusher woman peddling her mind altering goodies to her adopted family."
I:8747;1879;The children that watched this movie really enjoyed it!!
I:8747;1880;The adults thatwatched knew what was coming next and really enjoyed it again!!!
I:8747;1881;Mary Poppin's entertains, delights, and engages the whole family with her imagination and spunk.
I:8747;1882;I enjoyed Saving Mr. Banks enormously.
I:8747;1883;This is just as charming as it was when I first saw it many years ago!!!
I:8747;1884;Loved getting to share an old favorite of mine with my kids.
I:8747;1885;Everyone should have this movie!
I:8747;1886;It will make a good time for a family to spend together, with no unkind words.
I:8747;1887;This movie is no I remember from my childhood and I wanted the kids to enjoy it too.
I:8747;1888;Like all of us, our granddaughter loves movies.
I:8747;1889;She's watched classics like the Wizard of Oz (a fave!)
I:8747;1890;, Black Beauty, and Dumbo countless times.
I:8747;1891;While these films do show their age, they have nonetheless held up well over time and we've all viewed them over and over.
I:8747;1892;It's neither fun, nor satisfying, and definitely not engaging for kids.
I:8747;1893;it's a far, far better film!
I:8747;1894;Special features are fun too.
I:8747;1895;It is a fun movie and I am enjoying it again as much as I did when my daughter was young.
I:8747;1896;I enjoy it even more now that I'm an adult, and love the fact that I can watch it anytime I want to!
I:8747;1897;It is a timeless story.
I:8747;1898;Pleasurable viewing from a timeless movie.
I:8747;1899;what a wonderful character and Mary Poppins is well, Mary Poppins, a magical character that will live forever.
I:8747;1900;Great film and I highly recommend it
I:8747;1901;It is a cheery story.
I:8747;1902;We really love watching this with my grand daughter who always asks to watch it when she's at our place
I:8747;1903;very good:) One of the best movies both for a presentand we all very much really liked the movie .
I:8747;1904;This is a wonderful movie for any child or adult .
I:8747;1905;lots of singing, dancing, and just fun!
I:8747;1906;I know it's Mary Poppins, I know it's a Disney film.
I:8747;1907;I know the world loved it, but I didn't.
I:8747;1908;I bought this movie for my 7 year old daughter, I wasn't sure if she was going to like it, while she was watching it all I could hear was her laughter, and that is the greatest sound!
I:8747;1909;Great family movie with wonderful songs.
I:8747;1910;I watched this before going to see Saving Mr. Banks and enjoyed both movies even more.
I:8747;1911;My kids love this movie i was surprised that my 2year old liked it so much that when she watches it she sings the song.
I:8747;1912;this an all around family movie we can all enjoy :)
I:8747;1913;It has been years since i have seen this and I had forgotten what a great movie it was.
I:8747;1914;Great for the whole family
I:8747;1915;Charming, fun, sweet and magical.
I:8747;1916;Really nice to have multiple types of copies.
I:8747;1917;I would recommend this movie for all young family's.
I:8747;1918;"and if you know the punchline to that one, then you've already seen ""Mary Poppins"", the best live."
I:8747;1919;London is brought to the screen beautifully, gray and coal.
I:8747;1920;but how wonderful everything becomes when we pop off into a sidewalk chalk drawing!
I:8747;1921;What's needed is a good nanny to take things in hand, and right on cue, down lands Mary Poppins on the doorstep.
I:8747;1922;How the Banks family get in touch with each other and the power of familial love is the crux of the matter, and it couldn't happen without the intervention of Mary Poppins.
I:8747;1923;She's a prim know it all with a lovely soprano voice, who slyly indulges in magic from time to time.
I:8747;1924;David Tomlinson is great as the civil servant dad, the sort of fellow cariacatured by John Cleese so well.
I:8747;1925;Mary Poppins is a delight from start to finish.
I:8747;1926;Applause to all and thanks to Walt Disney.
I:8747;1927;We had a lot of fun watching this with my mom and 3.
I:8747;1928;It's a classic for me.
I:8747;1929;It's fun and my kids love the music.
I:8747;1930;I think it's just a good goto movie for the whole family.
I:8747;1931;After watching Saving, Mr. Banks I had to watch Mary Poppins and this was a the fastest and best way to wait it.
I:8747;1932;Super easy and we had the movie access for several days.
I:8747;1933;So beautiful done, using many modern techniques, this became an upgraded rendition.
I:8747;1934;We enjoyed the whole movie it even moe than the original.
I:8747;1935;I loved going back to a time before Disney had a political agenda, and a leftist one at that.
I:8747;1936;no hidden messages or brainwashing here, just good, clean fun for the kids and a harmless message for the adults.
I:8747;1937;I loved this movie as a child.
I:8747;1938;Now my kids are old enough to watch it, and I'm enjoying it all over again.
I:8747;1939;one of the great Disney classics and I would never miss it when I ws a child.
I:8747;1940;Now my Grandkids love it also.
I:8747;1941;Classic, great old movie production, what a great storyline and Julie Andrews is fabulous.
I:8747;1942;Watch saving Mr. Banks for an even better understanding of this classic story.
I:8747;1943;Just showed it to my students with intellectual disabilities and they loved it!
I:8747;1944;Save your tuppence for this best of all Disney live action films is finally on Blu Ray!
I:8747;1945;And you'll be able to see something amazing thanks to digital clarity.
I:8747;1946;Every actor with a speaking role has blue eyes.
I:8747;1947;All of the Sherman Brothers great songs and music are here.
I:8747;1948;You and our children will have untold hours of fun watching this greatest of all Disney films.
I:8747;1949;Good story, music, acting, choreography, dancing, filming.
I:8747;1950;Enjoyed it again after getting the back story from Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;1951;This is one of the best musicals ever, and a wonderful introduction to the genre of musical for children.
I:8747;1952;She is the perfect English governess.
I:8747;1953;My brother even enjoyed this film.
I:8747;1954;Love films based on books as they have depth.
I:8747;1955;Special effects in this film are magical.
I:8747;1956;A classic musical which will never go out of style.
I:8747;1957;Having gone to see SAVING MR. BANKS, I enjoyed watching Mary Poppins once again and remembering the wonderful story.
I:8747;1958;Would have enjoyed learning more about the history of this wonderful movie!
I:8747;1959;This was truly a classic for me.
I:8747;1960;It was magical and it taught you morals.
I:8747;1961;Delightful adventure, catchy songs, terrific dancing, colorful scenes.
I:8747;1962;"what makes ""Mary Poppins"" so magical?"
I:8747;1963;Certainly the production values are incredible.
I:8747;1964;Though everything was filmed on a set, the production in this two hour nineteen minute movie is crisp and tight, with every moment focused on moving the plot forward.
I:8747;1965;"But the magic in this movie is the focus on the children, and the children's view of our world
I:8747;1966;Wonderfully aided by Bert, played by Dick Van Dyke, Mary Poppins shows the children first and foremost that she understands them.
I:8747;1967;to make all this magic work, Disney combined animation and outstanding special effects.
I:8747;1968;Indeed, this movie won the 1965 Oscar for best visual effects.
I:8747;1969;"Mary, Bert and the children gambol about an animated countryside, in a style that was used again in ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks."""
I:8747;1970;There is a marvelous scene with Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) where we see Uncle Albert is laughing so much that has floated from the earth.
I:8747;1971;Then there is the wonderful scene with chimney sweeps singing and dancing on the rooftops of London.
I:8747;1972;If you like extras, these are excellent, including a fifty minute documentary that helps explain how some of the scenes were filmed.
I:8747;1973;"Mary Poppins is not only practically perfect in every way
I:8747;1974;Furthermore, it is an opportunity to remind adults of a time when they too could see our world as a magical, barely understood place, and to remember that our own children still see the world that way.
I:8747;1975;Watch this one again and remember your own childhood, and relive that childhood through your own children, or perhaps grandchildren.
I:8747;1976;then they watched the movie and loved and watched it several more times.
I:8747;1977;It is so refreshing to watch a movie for kids where there is literally not one questionable thing for them to view.
I:8747;1978;My 3 year old daughter absolutely LOVES it!
I:8747;1979;The movies are toted as Walt's best achievement ever.
I:8747;1980;"a MAGICAL REUNINION: There is a great walk down ""memory lane"" with Robert Sherman, Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews."
I:8747;1981;Dick van Dyke is amazing enthusiastically about his part as Bert.
I:8747;1982;tHE MAKING OF MARRY POPPINS: Is an amazing visual and educational look at the making of the film.
I:8747;1983;This is the longest of the extra features and goes in depth of the time, energies and efforts into making this Walt Disney classic.
I:8747;1984;Filled with outtakes, behind the scenes footage and commentary from Julie and most of the cast, crew and musical influences of the film.
I:8747;1985;tHE CAT THAT LOOKED AT THE KING: Finally there is an extra bonus of a great little new animated short that is from one of the original P. l. Travers books.
I:8747;1986;"Julie Andrews herself takes you through the adventure in a very ""Marry Poppins"" sort of way."
I:8747;1987;the film directed by Robert Stevenson (Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Love Bug, The Absent Minded Professor) is an amazing piece of fun, entertainment and a true lesson in life and the love of family.
I:8747;1988;Richard and Robert Sherman's score, music and songs will leave you singing long after the movie is over!
I:8747;1989;Sentimental moments, very funny moments and some very heartwarming emotions get this one before it disappears like Marry Poppins herself does!
I:8747;1990;I think it was great!
I:8747;1991;It is a great classic!!
I:8747;1992;we love that it is the type of classic that even our children will love for generations to come!
I:8747;1993;Great to engage and enjoy this classic as a family.
I:8747;1994;Our kids are 7 and 6 and loved the story and songs.
I:8747;1995;Magic and the message of hope and looking for the best in everyone and everything is great.
I:8747;1996;This was one of my favorite movies as a child and am happy to be able to share it my child.
I:8747;1997;Really enjoyed seeing this again.
I:8747;1998;"After seeing some of the artifacts from the movie in Florida, it was nice to see their original use!The chinmey sweep song and dance ""Step in Time"" is my all."
I:8747;1999;She is going to love it.
I:8747;2000;Still a favorite with our family after all these years.
I:8747;2001;Saw the movie in a whole new light.
I:8747;2002;I recommend you make a weekend of it like we did
I:8747;2003;great musical film for all ages will have you singing the songs at home, work .
I:8747;2004;everywhere for days to come!
I:8747;2005;50 Years after production my kids still loved it!
I:8747;2006;If for some reason you've never seen Mary Poppins, treat yourself now!
I:8747;2007;Awesome movie I always enjoy watching it with my kids.
I:8747;2008;Disney did a great job making the story come alive.
I:8747;2009;Watched it as a kid and wanted my kid to watch it.
I:8747;2010;This is another example of the great movies that were made when Walt was alive.
I:8747;2011;The cast, the plot and the visual are great.
I:8747;2012;Got it in a day!
I:8747;2013;I love classic Disney, the new ones too but the classics had more songs and in this case cartoon intertwined with actors was way ahead of time and entertainig when I was young loved watching my granddaughter dance and try to sing along with it, she was enchanted love the imagintion it inspires as wel lol as the morals, I recommend it to all this extended version also made me notice some I havent seen in the past.
I:8747;2014;The story line is great.
I:8747;2015;Sherman brothers music at its best!!!
I:8747;2016;This movie is a timeless joy.
I:8747;2017;It makes it just perfect!

I:8747;2019;And I apreciate the sender including a nice note .
I:8747;2020;shows that she cares about what she does and her product.
I:8747;2021;i use Amazon on a regular basis and have almost always been very happy.
I:8747;2022;This live action/animated musical is now celebrating its 50th Anniversary.
I:8747;2023;I bought this movie 6 or 7 years ago.
I:8747;2024;This is the best movie among so many great movies.
I:8747;2025;I love musicals and have many of them on video.

I:8747;2029;A reminder to us all to find time to see the magic in every day!
I:8747;2030;We can all dream big.
I:8747;2031;"The 1964 musical about the practically perfect"" nanny sails into stores this week in a refined and polished two."
I:8747;2032;She's the answer to her two young charges' prayers.
I:8747;2033;In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun, she tells them.
I:8747;2034;You find the fun and .
I:8747;2035;Poppins' panache and a magic carpetbag of tricks made the film a huge hit, rescuing the financially struggling Disney studio.
I:8747;2036;It was Broadway star Julie Andrews' first film, the third for co. star Dick Van Dyke and the last for Arthur Treacher (Constable Jones).
I:8747;2037;"it won five Oscars, the most for any Disney film, including best actress for Andrews and best song, ""Chim Chim Cher."
I:8747;2038;"But Oscar easily could have picked ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"" or Disney's favorite, ""Feed the Birds."
I:8747;2039;the best extra is a 50.
I:8747;2040;It's amazing how the British forgave me, he says.
I:8747;2041;Glynis Johns tells how Disney had to sweet.
I:8747;2042;When I think of how nearly I didn't do it, it's amazing, because I'm so proud to be a part of it, she says
I:8747;2043;I had to add it to my movie collection because the story is enthralling and the music enchanting.
I:8747;2044;It reminds you about the magic of childhood.
I:8747;2045;the packaging for this product was top.
I:8747;2046;It was really wonderful to see this movie the first time and the way they used to make film.
I:8747;2047;Great entertainment, music and dancing!
I:8747;2048;View the making of Mary Poppins on You Tube (part 1 thru 6) for a great perspective towards the film.
I:8747;2049;Also how much everyone admired and loved Walt Disney himself!
I:8747;2050;"One of the best children's movies of all time, ""Mary Poppins"" is one of Walt Disney's finest accomplishments."
I:8747;2051;coming young actress (Julie Andrews) with an established, bankable, and enthusiastic star (Dick Van Dyke), Disney struck cinematic gold.
I:8747;2052;Mary Poppins compares favorably with even the best childrens' fare of the last 40 years, and is just as enjoyable for older family members.
I:8747;2053;everyone who loves movies should own this 2.
I:8747;2054;There are absolutely no flaws to be seen, and the extras are top.
I:8747;2055;If you are on the fence about purchasing this movie, go ahead and order it from Amazon right away, with full confidence.
I:8747;2056;I have a very soft, sentimental spot in my heart for Mary Poppins.
I:8747;2057;I saw it three times and I played the record over and over.
I:8747;2058;This is my very favorite movie from childhood.
I:8747;2059;even if I never had children of my own and never enjoyed it with them.
I:8747;2060;The mixture of live action and animation is groundbreaking.
I:8747;2061;And Dick Van Dyke, despite his ridiculous accent, is immensely likable.
I:8747;2062;If you have any affection at all for Disney movies, you have to love Mary Poppins.
I:8747;2063;This movie was great fun to watch with my girls.
I:8747;2064;It was as fun as I remembered as a child.
I:8747;2065;Great way to spend mothers day with my kids watching a classic

I:8747;2069;Nice to keep forever and ever and ever and ever.
I:8747;2070;Had not seen this movie in ages, and it was delightful all over again with its refreshing new look.
I:8747;2071;"The movie had clear definition
I:8747;2072;I highly recommend everyone purchasing this video.
I:8747;2073;She told me she wasn't familiar with the story, so I ordered it for her.
I:8747;2074;We enjoyed it numerous times before the musical play and at the show she sang along!
I:8747;2075;We now watch it about once a day!
I:8747;2076;Wanted my grand daughter to experience it so Easter Bunny brought it in her basket.
I:8747;2077;Thanks It came in record time
I:8747;2078;2 hours of laughing and fun with Magical Mary Poppins as your nanny!

I:8747;2082;My third grade class watched it at the end of the school year and they found it very enjoyable.
I:8747;2083;I enjoyed this movie as a child and enjoy even more as an adult.
I:8747;2084;Also,I marveled and enjoyed the story behind the story.
I:8747;2085;The old classics are just the best.
I:8747;2086;My 9 year old daughter really enjoyed the movie and is singing the songs.
I:8747;2087;It's so much more appropriate for a 13 yr.
I:8747;2088;The delight of this movie can lift your spirits, seeing the joy of the actors who are in it.
I:8747;2089;A great classic starring Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, English nanny and helpful chimney sweeper extrodinaire.
I:8747;2090;expealidotious, means to expidite, to go fast.
I:8747;2091;Anyway this is a timeless classic, and it was aired on Disney's ABC.
I:8747;2092;This movie must be seen to be beleived and if you have the time, watch as Mary Poppins floats down on the town in a dirty black smock and a black umbrella, and gets herself a job as a clean the kids room type nanny!
I:8747;2093;A wonderful and expediantly timed film!
I:8747;2094;Can always depend on Amazon and then to get excellent customer service on top of that.
I:8747;2095;Seeing this movie as an adult brought back nostalgic memories of childhood.
I:8747;2096;There'll never be another Walt Disney, that's for sure!
I:8747;2097;disc 45th Anniversary Special Edition)Looks great from outside of the package and it came as Amazon promised.
I:8747;2098;It's fine because the movie is fine.
I:8747;2099;She's everything the kids want, fun and magical.
I:8747;2100;Still this movie is more about fun then anything else.
I:8747;2101;And it has that in spades.
I:8747;2102;Many of the special effects hold up remarkably well today.
I:8747;2103;Any fan of Disney knows these songs by heart.
I:8747;2104;Disc one features the movie in all its wide screen glory.
I:8747;2105;Sprinkled in are archive comments from others, including Disney himself.
I:8747;2106;one thing that comes through loud and clear in this set is how much fun everyone had making it and how much they respect Walt Disney.
I:8747;2107;The fact that this film has lasted 40 years is testament to his genius.
I:8747;2108;With this set, it'll be enjoyed by generations to come.
I:8747;2109;The film speaks for itself.
I:8747;2110;As fresh and damn well entertaining as it was forty years ago, this is How To Make a Family Movie 101.
I:8747;2111;The cast are uniformly excellent (ignoring Dick Van Dyke's appaulling Cockney accent) and the songs are by far the Sherman Brothers' best.
I:8747;2112;but the real gem of this is the commentary.
I:8747;2113;Very few classic movies of this vintage are lucky enough to have their two principle performers still alive and I really had hoped that Andrews and Van Dyke would take to the microphone.
I:8747;2114;A classic in the true sense of the word.
I:8747;2115;Julie Andrews is a fine actress and have always like Dick Vandyke.
I:8747;2116;This movie is a classic, great songs, dancing and story, at 2 hours and 20 minutes it does feel a little long, but my kids 4 and 6 sat through all of it in full eyes glued to the screen and then did the same the very next day!
I:8747;2117;Easily, this is one of Disney's best films of all time.
I:8747;2118;The songs, the cast, the animated sequences .
I:8747;2119;Coming up on 50 years now, the films is still great and did many innovative things.
I:8747;2120;when looking at the movie it charged my account and gave the movie.
I:8747;2121;my girlfriend and her buddie both love disney flicks.
I:8747;2122;This movie was made in 1969 and the special effects are amazing.
I:8747;2123;I loved this movie as a child and now my children enjoy it just as much as I did.
I:8747;2124;It will be a film that we will share with our grandchildren.
I:8747;2125;I remember seeing it when it came out as a kid.
I:8747;2126;This has to be the greatest family movie ever made.
I:8747;2127;I enjoyed the movie, Saving Mr. Banks better.
I:8747;2128;My children love this movie.
I:8747;2129;up to the new Christmas movie Saving Mr. Banks .
I:8747;2130;Great family movie to watch together.
I:8747;2131;Kids really enjoyed it and it's great to share a classic with them!
I:8747;2132;Dick van Dyke and Julie Andrews have real talent and this movie really showcases it.
I:8747;2133;The 40th anniv edition is wonderful.
I:8747;2134;This is one of the best movie Hollywood has ever put out.
I:8747;2135;Children and adults will always want to watch this positive story.
I:8747;2136;A must see with your kids and friends.
I:8747;2137;Not only did it successful blend both live action and animation in new and exciting ways, it also featured a top notch stellar cast of old pros and extremely talented newcomers (many of whom we would soon be seeing LOTS more of) and the beautiful original music by the Sherman Brothers, the greatest songwriters that ever worked for Disney.
I:8747;2138;With the songs sung by one of most beautiful voices of all time, the great Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins is entertainment at it's best.
I:8747;2139;It is fun for the entire family and has plenty of Re.
I:8747;2140;I honestly did not except too much from this transfer and was happily surprised throughout the presentation.
I:8747;2141;Color timing looks very good, perhaps the color saturation level is just a bit on the light side of things, but overall it is very natural looking.
I:8747;2142;Contrast and Brightness levels are very good and the film looks spectacular in motion.
I:8747;2143;i was frankly shocked by how well Disney has handled this title.
I:8747;2144;If you have a critical eye, you will notice the weak spots immediately but soon realize they are perfectly acceptable within the framework of the full movie.
I:8747;2145;Technically this is a top notch transfer.
I:8747;2146;The simple reason is IT CAN'T look perfect since it never WAS perfect.
I:8747;2147;"oK, so the picture is pretty darn good, how about the sound?The audio on 'Mary Poppins"" is where this disc REALLY shines."
I:8747;2148;purposed surround mix is quite good and I went with it.
I:8747;2149;Decent surround activity and even some sub involvement, this is a lively mix that belies the age of the source elements.
I:8747;2150;The music itself is wonderfully reproduced as are all the vocals.
I:8747;2151;Foley and Ambient effects are nicely mixed to take advantage of the surround format and I found myself quite satisfied with the audio on this Blu ray disc.
I:8747;2152;special features abound on this disc and the Supplements are quite extensive.
I:8747;2153;They are for the most part quite good and will interest all who love the film to begin with.
I:8747;2154;Just the movie alone on Blu Ray is well worth the price, but the addition of this plethora of extras puts the icing right on top of the cake.
I:8747;2155;(sorry)'Mary Poppins' is a true classic that will entertain and delight for many years to come.
I:8747;2156;This Blu Ray presentation gives you the very best rendering of both the video and audio available.
I:8747;2157;While not perfect, it is a great film with a very ambitious Blu Ray transfer that SHOULD delight most fans.
I:8747;2158;Looks very good, sounds even better!
I:8747;2159;I had a huge smile on my face all during the screening.
I:8747;2160;It's an amazing achievement!Highly recommended by ME, Marty G!
I:8747;2161;I had new insights into the movie, and it was still fresh and new.
I:8747;2162;Walt Disney's vision and his ability to still see through the eyes of a child while working in a high pressure business are still amazing.
I:8747;2163;The music is uplifting and fun, the personalities are well.
I:8747;2164;defined, and the total experience is still fresh and new.
I:8747;2165;I loved this movie as a child when it first came out, and my feeling haven't changed over the decades.
I:8747;2166;is seamless, which is quite an accomplishment.
I:8747;2167;The music is gorgeous, the dancing lively and fun.
I:8747;2168;I bought this to just review the dance scene with the dancing on the roof top.
I:8747;2169;The entire movie was an enjoyable escape into childhood.
I:8747;2170;This movie with or with out the extras is as magical as the first day i saw it back in 1964.
I:8747;2171;I love this movie because there is nothing but positiveness!
I:8747;2172;Looking at it now, after all these years, I had forgotten what a superb movie this is.
I:8747;2173;There's a lot of magic in this movie and I love magic.
I:8747;2174;I am a big fan of guided imagery and got some incredible ideas.
I:8747;2175;She is such a joy to be entertained by.
I:8747;2176;It was a positive experience.
I:8747;2177;I will come back and visit again.
I:8747;2178;After reading the book, watching the movie and knowing the author of the book from the resent movie painted an interesting picture.
I:8747;2179;I Enjoy watching this movie every time I have a chance.
I:8747;2180;It was easy to stream through our roku.
I:8747;2181;Nice clear picture made it enjoyable to watch.
I:8747;2182;This was given to my granddaughter and we enjoyed watching it together.
I:8747;2183;I would recommend for sure.
I:8747;2184;as a prime member, and as a basic member and as part of the perks of ordering on.
I:8747;2185;It reminds me of my childhood.
I:8747;2186;this movie is a classic.
I:8747;2187;Wonderful fun even for the littlest ones.
I:8747;2188;This special edition was most enjoyable.
I:8747;2189;The added video of the musical play adaptation was delightful.
I:8747;2190;It was fun seeing this magical musical classic again after seeing it in the movies when I was a kid.
I:8747;2191;It keeps the young in me.
I:8747;2192;Mary Poppins just keeps the medicine as sweet as ever.
I:8747;2193;truly a time honored classic, I hope my children get the enjoyment out of this that I did, growing up.
I:8747;2194;Completely faithful to the original.
I:8747;2195;Add it to your collection now!

I:8747;2197;In light of the release of the new movie Saving Mr. Banks, I wanted to get this amazing classic for my family, and I'm glad I found this copy.
I:8747;2198;My daughters absolutely loved it and have been singing the songs non stop.
I:8747;2199;This edition of Mary Poppins will captivate you and entertain you to no end!
I:8747;2200;Later on in the movie the father is faced with the possible loss of his job and the moral of the story is delivered to the audience in a very well done fashion.
I:8747;2201;the acting is superlative and the musical numbers are unforgettable.
I:8747;2202;with valuable extras that will entertain you and raise your understanding of how the film was made as well as its history.
I:8747;2203;"minute documentary, footage of the ""Gala Movie Premiere,"" and a make up test for Dyke Van Dyke."
I:8747;2204;There are songs and games for children (and the children in us), too!After you see this you will understand why the movie got Julie Andrews a Best Actress Oscar (in her film debut, no less) and why Dick Van Dyke is so talented and perfect for his role as Mary's boyfriend.
I:8747;2205;"All together the film received 13 Oscar nominations including Best Song for ""Chim Chim Cher."
I:8747;2206;Although some of the technical effects are not the state of today's art, the film did receive Oscar awards for technical effects and music.
I:8747;2207;Best movie ever, and a definite classic.
I:8747;2208;One of Disney's classics that you must have in your collection right now.
I:8747;2209;The kids loved it as much as we did when we were children!
I:8747;2210;Wonderful story and a great message.
I:8747;2211;Watched this as a child and loved it.
I:8747;2212;I got this for my daughters to grow up watching because of the fun and fantasy of it.
I:8747;2213;This musical movie is extremely well produced and has outstanding actor work.
I:8747;2214;The music from Sherman brothers is world famous and well known.
I:8747;2215;many of the songs are good, memorable and the grouchy bankers were done well.
I:8747;2216;for an interesting adventure of your own and turn off the TV.
I:8747;2217;After watching the wonderful Saving Mr. Banks we thought it would be fun to see the magic of this childhood film.
I:8747;2218;If you're interested in a cultural study of ideas which influenced a generation .
I:8747;2219;Appreciate it more after seeing Saving Mr Banks.
I:8747;2220;The songs are classics and I still knew the words after 30 years.
I:8747;2221;After seeing Savings Mr Banks we wented to seeMary Poppins again what a treat!
I:8747;2222;My three year old boy loves this movie.
I:8747;2223;The dancing, the singing, he loves it.
I:8747;2224;I found the movie very entertaining to watch.
I:8747;2225;There is also a pop up feature so you can read about interesting facts about the making of the movie, the characters, etc.
I:8747;2226;For its time, this was a creative movie, and they managed to merge the animation in with the live.
I:8747;2227;The film has more color, more fantasy, it's pretty awesome, and Julie Andrews does a simply wonderful job as Mary Poppins.
I:8747;2228;it's a great movie, that 'connects' with just about every generation that sees it.
I:8747;2229;But overall, I love this movie!
I:8747;2230;Plus all those familiar actors and voices from other Disney films of that time period.
I:8747;2231;The bonus features were fun too.
I:8747;2232;I'm very pleased with the vendor, the delivery time and the movie of course!
I:8747;2233;This is such a classic movie!
I:8747;2234;It's a definite must have for children and adults!
I:8747;2235;Funny and so beautifully done!
I:8747;2236;I have loved this movie since i was a little girl.
I:8747;2237;I cant believe how old this is!
I:8747;2238;Every kid should watch it!
I:8747;2239;But we watched it again and it is one for the whole family!
I:8747;2240;Perfect movie to watch with the family and one I'd highly recommend for a family movie night.
I:8747;2241;since little girl love it and now as a grown up love it even more.
I:8747;2242;great for any generation to watch.
I:8747;2243;Wonderful family night movie that makes the kids sing and dance!
I:8747;2244;right after second grade, I think.
I:8747;2245;By the time it came to the theater in my little rural hometown a year after its release, Julie Andrews had already won an Oscar for her work as the title character.
I:8747;2246;To the kids in my class at school, this was the hot, must.
I:8747;2247;see movie of that summer.
I:8747;2248;I can still remember laughing over Dick Van Dyke tap.
I:8747;2249;he basically won my heart as Bert.
I:8747;2250;trades special friend to Mary and the Banks' children.
I:8747;2251;just as I was the first time I saw it.
I:8747;2252;as for me. . . it's all I remembered it to be, and then some.
I:8747;2253;For starters, the music. . . what was missing from the old record I had were the overture, underscores, and closing score.
I:8747;2254;they were beautifully put together.
I:8747;2255;And the little details are delightful, too.
I:8747;2256;So they do the next best thing.
I:8747;2257;work together as a team to bring happiness to British middle.
I:8747;2258;Mary was no ordinary nanny, but Bert made her an even better one.
I:8747;2259;The scene between Bert and Mr. Banks at the house is one of the best in the movie.
I:8747;2260;Now, as an adult, I do.
I:8747;2261;The mission was accomplished, and it was time to move on.
I:8747;2262;Enjoy it with your own daughter. . .
I:8747;2263;I recently was able to see the new movie Mr. Banks It caused me to re.
I:8747;2264;watch Mary Poppins and enjoy it even more!
I:8747;2265;Great to show as a treat for students who have done well for a quarter!
I:8747;2266;I haven't seen it in years but it's just as great as when I first saw it in the movies as a ten year old.
I:8747;2267;It's about the family as a whole.
I:8747;2268;This is one of the all time Disney great movies.
I:8747;2269;It's a great family picture.
I:8747;2270;I'll have to see the rest of it tomorrow.
I:8747;2271;The images are sharp and clear.
I:8747;2272;Make sure you see it with your children.
I:8747;2273;Pass it down to the next generation.
I:8747;2274;Starring Julie Andrews as the mysterious and magical Mary Poppins, the film is a fictional account of a dysfunctional family living in London circa 1910.
I:8747;2275;"Along the way, the children are also introduced to several interesting people, including the handyman Bert (Dick Van Dyke, who starred in his own 1961 TV show and starred in ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang""), Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn, who also played the toy."
I:8747;2276;"many of the songs in the film are well known by people who have never seen the film, including:* ""Sister Suffragette"" (4.5/5, Glynis John)."
I:8747;2277;"* ""The Life I Lead"" (5/5, David Tomlinson)."
I:8747;2278;Mary encouraging the children to clean their rooms upon her arrival.
I:8747;2279;Bert describing how wonderful it is to be with Mary Poppins again within the sidewalk chalk painting.
I:8747;2280;Mary telling George that he'll be taking the children to the bank with him.
I:8747;2281;George and Winifred spending time with Jane and Michael.
I:8747;2282;It's catchy songs and fantastic situations propel the audience into a magical world of laughter and love that can be watched many times while never becoming tiresome.
I:8747;2283;It also made Julie Andrews a household name with her unforgettable performance as Mary Poppins.
I:8747;2284;I bought a Disney movie .
I:8747;2285;I actually showed it to my kids (first I watched it again, just to make sure).
I:8747;2286;"flying, just not the value judgment)
I:8747;2287;The absolute fantasy of it is marvelous, and the songs are beautiful.
I:8747;2288;Mary Poppings is a movie for the whole family.
I:8747;2289;It is fun and holds adventure that all can enjoy.
I:8747;2290;it has been many years since I've seen Mary (Julie Andrews) and Bert (Dick Van Dyke) and if anything the film is more fun, the songs more tuney and beautifully performed than ever.
I:8747;2291;"in other words, ""MP"" is more profound, deeper, thoughtful and sadder for adults than it would be for children."
I:8747;2292;It works on at least two levels and that's more than you can say for some of the tripe being released recently.
I:8747;2293;The release of this great movie for its' 50th anniversary is a credit to Walt Disney's crowning achievement.
I:8747;2294;ray this movie is a pleasure to watch.
I:8747;2295;The interview with Richard Sherman after the movie brought back some fond memories.
I:8747;2296;Another quote from the movie that accurately describes this classic.
I:8747;2297;The music, dancing, and singing all make a great film.
I:8747;2298;This is a fantastic movie and music for kids!
I:8747;2299;I loved it since i was a kid!
I:8747;2300;The transfer is superior, the special features are fun and interesting.
I:8747;2301;I received my blu ray yesterday.
I:8747;2302;Sound is amazing but picture is very grainy.
I:8747;2303;Still a great picture and Julie Andrews a movie star in the making!
I:8747;2304;This is a wonderful movie and I got it for all of the bonus features.
I:8747;2305;favorite scene is the chalk drawing escape.
I:8747;2306;i recommend this movie for adults and kids!
I:8747;2307;It is about 30 minutes too long, but otherwise a fantastic movie.
I:8747;2308;old says, It is awesome and funny.
I:8747;2309;I grew up watching Mary Poppins and loved it.
I:8747;2310;So I wanted to share this movie with my 3 and 5 yr old daughters!
I:8747;2311;A great movie we can share together!
I:8747;2312;AFter seeing the great movie Saving Mr. Banks , we just had to watch Mary Poppins again.
I:8747;2313;We forgot how good it is, and it meant so much more after seeing the recent Saving Mr. Banks movie.
I:8747;2314;The songs are still fresh and vibrant.
I:8747;2315;As a whole this is the most re.
I:8747;2316;anyway, it has great nostalgic value for me.
I:8747;2317;Some of the songs brought back good memories though.
I:8747;2318;Also, after seeing Saving Mr. Banks, I felt a deeper understanding for this movie.
I:8747;2319;My kiddies seem to be enjoying it just as much as I did at their age.
I:8747;2320;Great music, great characters and of course it's Disney!
I:8747;2321;Best part is the tea party of the ceiling.
I:8747;2322;Many film critics call it the best Walt Disney movie ever made.
I:8747;2323;the crowning achievement from a studio that has brought us such timeless classics as Fantasia, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Bambi, Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King.
I:8747;2324;This fabulous musical comedy, starring Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, and Glynis Johns, and based on the best selling British children's books written by P. l. Travers, ranks as one of the two best children's movies ever made.
I:8747;2325;This is such an extraordinary movie!!
I:8747;2326;"It has everything that a great kid's movie should have: a wonderful story that teaches strong family values
I:8747;2327;Here are just a few of the things I like best about Mary Poppins: THE ACTING is absolutely brilliant!
I:8747;2328;Julie Andrews won a Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Mary Poppins.
I:8747;2329;At the same time, she manages to convey a wonderful sense of joy, kindness, and compassion toward the children.
I:8747;2330;Dick Van Dyke is superb as the carefree chimney sweep ans jack.
I:8747;2331;His relaxed comic style is perfectly matched to his character.
I:8747;2332;And, while his Cockney accent doesn't quite deliver the goods accurately, it's nevertheless pretty good.
I:8747;2333;(By the way, look for Mr. Van Dyke in a secondary role in this film.
I:8747;2334;out member of this fabulous ensemble cast.
I:8747;2335;He's practically perfect as the pompous, stuffy martinet of a father, George Banks.
I:8747;2336;"Other cast members are excellent as well, especially Glynis Johns as Winifred Banks
I:8747;2337;The beauty of this story is that it's done in a way that's easy for kids, even younger ones (I'd say ages six and older) to understand and learn from.
I:8747;2338;tHE MUSIC: All of the music and lyrics in Mary Poppins are original.
I:8747;2339;composed by Richard Sherman and his brother Robert.
I:8747;2340;This film has some of the best songs ever to appear in a movie!
I:8747;2341;"Each song is in itself a classic: A Spoonful of Sugar
I:8747;2342;"ee
I:8747;2343;In its day, Mary Poppins was on the cutting edge of movie.
I:8747;2344;And, of course, this is also one of the first films to combine real.
I:8747;2345;life actors and animation extensively (the entire sequence with Mary, Bert and the children inside the sidewalk chalk picture.)
I:8747;2346;popping!Go beyond all the glitz and glitter of the film, and you'll find at the heart of Mary Poppins a simple story about family, with important lessons for all of us .
I:8747;2347;But it's still a great kid's movie!
I:8747;2348;With a well written, touching story, superb music, and outstanding special effects, it's at once brilliantly funny, poignant, joyous, carefree, and just plain marvelous entertainment.
I:8747;2349;I just love this classic and happy my kids can enjoy it.
I:8747;2350;It's a classic and perfect for young children.
I:8747;2351;Definitely G rated and in addition not scary.
I:8747;2352;Kids love the music, too.
I:8747;2353;I'm glad they finally have a favorite movie.
I:8747;2354;It's fun to watch for kids, and fun for me to watch and remember my childhood.
I:8747;2355;This edition of Mary Poppins is amazing.
I:8747;2356;The shipping was amazingly quick as well.
I:8747;2357;The condition of the entire package was excellent!
I:8747;2358;Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke did outstanding jobs inthis timeless Disney classic!Andrews is wonderful as thekind.
I:8747;2359;"hearted yet strict nanny,and Van Dyke's performanceof Burt is very good
I:8747;2360;performed and convincing!The scenery is colorful and verywell.
I:8747;2361;Young and old alike will be entertainedby this film.
I:8747;2362;My granddaughter age 9 had never seen it and thought it was wonderful.
I:8747;2363;I loved seeing it again.
I:8747;2364;The children just love the songs and the dancing.
I:8747;2365;Now that I have a young child, I wanted to make sure he grew up with the same classics I did.
I:8747;2366;Mary Poppins is a timeless classic with some of the greatest songs for childhood.
I:8747;2367;After seeing Saving Mr. Banks , I felt compelled to watch this.
I:8747;2368;It was as good as my memory had preserved.
I:8747;2369;Now as a grizzled old grandfather, I decided to watch it the right way.
I:8747;2370;Undistracted and in high definition.
I:8747;2371;This film featured Julie Andrews in her big screen debut and I must say, she is drop dead gorgeous in spite of some heavy costuming replicating 1910 London.
I:8747;2372;She is perfect as Mary Poppins, who cheerful though she seems is a bit more focused on discipline than what is on the surface.
I:8747;2373;He not only provides a convincing fun.
I:8747;2374;loving character but also shows considerable dancing ability.
I:8747;2375;This is especially evident in his dancing sequence with the controversial animated penguins.
I:8747;2376;He also believes children are to be seen (if they must) and certainly not heard.
I:8747;2377;Mary Poppins is full of bright and sometimes thoughtful music throughout.
I:8747;2378;The integration of the animation with the live action is very good and revolutionary for the time.
I:8747;2379;The dance sequence involving the dozen or so chimney sweeps is beautifully choreographed.
I:8747;2380;And it is a good one.

I:8747;2382;This is an all time classic that is absolutely fabulous.
I:8747;2383;it is an excellent video, which everyone person and child should see at least once.
I:8747;2384;the writing, the songs, the costumes .
I:8747;2385;it's fun if you like musicals and like to pretend.
I:8747;2386;it's also fun to watch old stars in their youth
I:8747;2387;One of the best movies ever!!!
I:8747;2388;I love Mary Poppins and love the songs and singing!
I:8747;2389;I love Mary Poppins, I grew up watching this movie.
I:8747;2390;the Blu Ray is amazing when it comes to older movies.
I:8747;2391;My son loves Dick Van Dyke.
I:8747;2392;But Julie Andrews was so beautiful and feminine looking.
I:8747;2393;And Mr. Banks turned out to be human after all!
I:8747;2394;Mary Poppins is perfectly fine start to finish.
I:8747;2395;The classic songs are fun for kids to sing along with.
I:8747;2396;and Julie Andrews is delightful, Dick Van Dyke funny, children precious.
I:8747;2397;This is one of the absolute best family movies ever, and has a message that is needed even more in this day and age.
I:8747;2398;Filled with beautiful, memorable songs, and superb performances, Mary Poppins is a gem and a classic.
I:8747;2399;It is enchanting to see how Mary is able to teach a work.
I:8747;2400;centered, uninvolved father, and a sweet.
I:8747;2401;sidetracked mother what their most precious possessions truly are.
I:8747;2402;their children and their family.
I:8747;2403;And Mary does it all so subtly, even magically, that the medicine really does go down with that spoonful of sugar!Along the way, Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) and Bert (Dick Van Dyke) take the children on magical adventures to an English countryside, a tea party on the ceiling, and a chimney sweep's paradise.
I:8747;2404;Dick Van Dyke said that this is the best movie he ever did, and ever hoped to do.
I:8747;2405;My boys are 7 and 9 and although they are used to faster paced movies of their generation they still did enjoy this firm!
I:8747;2406;Kids or no kids, Mary Poppins is a must have movie I love the songs.
I:8747;2407;I just love this movie.
I:8747;2408;We enjoyed sharing this great movie with our kids.
I:8747;2409;Floating in on the East Wind, the mysterious and magical Mary Poppins arrives at the door of the Banks family to take on the position of nanny to the two Banks children, Jane and Michael.
I:8747;2410;Later, they have a tea party on the ceiling at Uncle Albert's and play Step In Time on the London rooftops with a wild band of Chimney Sweeps.
I:8747;2411;All works out in the end though, and the rest is Disney history!Hailed as Walt's greatest theatrical achievement, one certainly can't argue the point after seeing this film.
I:8747;2412;"It's ""practically perfect in every way!"""
I:8747;2413;The Sherman Brothers outdid themselves, as usual, in the songwriting tasks, and the casting is some of Disney's best.
I:8747;2414;The beautiful backdrops are completely amazing, especially after watching the behind the scenes featurette to see how they were accomplished.
I:8747;2415;The extras are quite nice too.
I:8747;2416;You and your kids will be humming the tunes for ages and the kids will definitely want to see this one over and over.
I:8747;2417;Julie Andrews in her prime is fantastic, Acting, Singing, and role.
I:8747;2418;The cast is also well chosen, along with wardrobe selections to make it complete.
I:8747;2419;This is the best Disney movie ever.
I:8747;2420;Dick Van Dyke is brilliant.
I:8747;2421;It goes so well with a viewing of Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;2422;This movie is a timeless classic.
I:8747;2423;I had no issues with delivery and the movie was in great condition.
I:8747;2424;This is a movie to share with future generations.
I:8747;2425;A great deluxe treament to an equally great film.
I:8747;2426;One of Disneys finest moments.
I:8747;2427;love love love Family Classic that never gets old, enjoyed watching with my 7 year old.
I:8747;2428;liked: The Life I Lead (Mr. Banks), The Perfect Nanny (Jane), Spoonful of Sugar, Supercalifragilistic (OK on it's own).
I:8747;2429;This is a nice enough song on it's own and was used to beautiful effect in Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;2430;they really thought that would be charming to children????
I:8747;2431;Every one has so eloquently reviewed this wonderful movie that I can add nothing but my personal little story of the way I felt when I first saw the movie.
I:8747;2432;The theater is kind of spooky and I remember being a little unnerved by it.
I:8747;2433;The movie started and I was absolutely and utterly in love with Julie Andrews from the moment she appeared on the screen.
I:8747;2434;I remember even attemptling to speak with a british accent after I saw the film.
I:8747;2435;My mother said at the time how wonderful Dick Van Dyke was and I remember being so mad at her for saying that.
I:8747;2436;But seeing it again as an adult I have to say she was absolutely right.
I:8747;2437;He is so wonderful in this film that it takes my breath away and at the end when he is chastising Mr. Banks and telling him in a nice way that he hasnt made enough time for his children, it always makes me cry.
I:8747;2438;He was wonderful, SHE was wonderful.
I:8747;2439;Wonderfully entertaining which brings back great childhood memories.
I:8747;2440;A great story line which is complemented by the recently released Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;2441;i bought this for my granddaughter to watch before we took her to see the stage show She loved it, leaned the songs.
I:8747;2442;Its a childhood movie and classic.
I:8747;2443;I am glad that I ordered it, thank you Amazon!
I:8747;2444;I wasn't sure he was old enough for the movie, but he is and he loves it.
I:8747;2445;This is the first Disney film released after I was born.
I:8747;2446;I got into this film because of the music.
I:8747;2447;Both Julie Andrews Dick Van Dyke were perfect in their roles.
I:8747;2448;Notice I use the word perfect as it was in the film.
I:8747;2449;Glad there are extras on the disc, surprising.
I:8747;2450;everyone should see this at least once!
I:8747;2451;There was chemistry between the two stars.
I:8747;2452;When I was a child, I loved the film and still love it.
I:8747;2453;The best part is that my wife and I can watch it with them, and we enjoy it too.
I:8747;2454;A true classic that's appropriate for the entire family.
I:8747;2455;I loved this movie as a child and now that I've introduced it to my 7 year old daughter, she loves it as well.
I:8747;2456;Rarely does a movie come along that has the mass appeal of Mary Poppins.
I:8747;2457;Still more rare is a movie that combines the two.
I:8747;2458;The acting is great, the story is great and the music is great.
I:8747;2459;i can remember watching this once or twice as a child and finding it good.
I:8747;2460;Mary poppins is a timeless classic that I could watch over and over.
I:8747;2461;It is by far one of our favorites.
I:8747;2462;In our family we had 8 children, my grandmother she would take one child at a time to see this movie at the theaters no matter how many times she would see it.
I:8747;2463;It was a fabulous movie.
I:8747;2464;A great movie of family life and how things can change.
I:8747;2465;the part I did see did notexcite me or please me as when I first viewed it.
I:8747;2466;Dick van Dyke was terrific as always and the overall feel good theme reminded me of my childhood watching this film.
I:8747;2467;A new perspective and a deeper appreciate for what the author went through.
I:8747;2468;Timeless movie and very touching!
I:8747;2469;With the release of Daving Mr. Banks I just wanted to see it.
I:8747;2470;My granddaughter had not seen this movie, and I think it's a classic that everyone should see, and so I added it to my collection.
I:8747;2471;julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are classics and fun for everyone
I:8747;2472;This is Mary Poppins and a Walt Disney movie.
I:8747;2473;A wonderful movie, better than the book (in my opinion), Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke, and everyone else do a superb job.
I:8747;2474;brought back so many childhood memory's.
I:8747;2475;I saw it after see Saving Mr. Banks and fell it love with it even more.
I:8747;2476;Walt Disney's Mary Poppins is a glorious family film.
I:8747;2477;Andrews is a class act.
I:8747;2478;Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as Bert.
I:8747;2479;And the songs are the kind of showtunes you'll sing again and again.
I:8747;2480;Was also surprised it kept the attention of my two year old.
I:8747;2481;I'm sure this will be a favorite of hers for years to come.
I:8747;2482;We always love seeing this movie.
I:8747;2483;mary Poppins is a real classic, with a great family story, lots of fun, and great music.

I:8747;2486;I enjoyed the movie but did not mean to click on it because I did not want to pay for it.
I:8747;2487;This is a story about the salvation of a dysfunctional family iced with joyous music and magic.
I:8747;2488;Great remastering work on the blu ray version and the extras add a great deal to the enjoyment of the film.
I:8747;2489;Amazingly, this movie is a brilliantly fun trip down family film lane.
I:8747;2490;Mary Poppins gives the audience a well off but troublesome British family who is in need of a new Nanny by the name of Mary Poppins.
I:8747;2491;During the time that Mary Poppins spends with the family they are able to reconnect with themselves as individuals and as a family.
I:8747;2492;a classic family film that has stood the test of time.
I:8747;2493;Because when you watch this movie you never really grow up and realize how wonderful this film actually is.
I:8747;2494;We had seen Saving Mr Banks, and thought it would be fun to see Mary Poppins.
I:8747;2495;It brings you back to childhood!
I:8747;2496;I really enjoyed seeing and hearing Julie Andrews.
I:8747;2497;Go see Saving Mr. Banks then see this.
I:8747;2498;Mary Poppins is a wonderful tale which combines the very talented Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.
I:8747;2499;It is a great story for both young and old.
I:8747;2500;This movie has always been a favorite of mine and my daughter is at the age where I think she would like it, and she did.
I:8747;2501;It's just one of those movies that everyone enjoys watching and will always be a classic!
I:8747;2502;Great movie for kids and adults alike.

I:8747;2507;They love it and have seen it many times.
I:8747;2508;Forty years old and still practically perfect in every way!
I:8747;2509;"Mary Poppins remains Walt Disney's crowning technical and artistic achievement
I:8747;2510;andrews delights in the title role as the too good to be true nanny with just enough playful larceny lurking beneath her properly quaffed locks and bonnet.
I:8747;2511;"A lowly chimney sweep, Bert (Dick Van Dyke) helps provide Mary and the children with one of those supercalafragalisticexpialadocious bits of escapism set to magic
I:8747;2512;There's so much to admire and celebrate in this perennial classic that it's best left to the home viewer to pop this one in for a jolly holiday of a good time!Disney's deluxe, 2.
I:8747;2513;Colors are rich and vibrant.
I:8747;2514;Blacks are solid and deep.
I:8747;2515;The audio is a brand new, and very engaging, 5.1 mix for the home theatre aficionado.
I:8747;2516;All in all this is a very nicely packed special edition from the Disney stable and one that's been long overdo.
I:8747;2517;"So get out your umbrella or go fly a kite
I:8747;2518;I love the movie and show.
I:8747;2519;I love the part when they sing Supercalifragilisticxpialidocius.
I:8747;2520;Very interesting story about the history/making of Mary Poppins.
I:8747;2521;Basically if you love the movie as we do this was a great gift for my niece.
I:8747;2522;We watch it often at our house and I wanted her to have her own.
I:8747;2523;She was very happy and again Amazon is reasonably priced so wala!!!
I:8747;2524;Every so often, the movie would stop and a refresh icon would appear.
I:8747;2525;I always enjoy some of the special effects.
I:8747;2526;The animation scenes were very good when they first appeared, but have aged a little since then.
I:8747;2527;And, Julie Andrews had a wonderful voice and sang great songs in the film.
I:8747;2528;in short, a magical nanny swoops in to take care of the Banks children and also helps their father to value them and make time for them.
I:8747;2529;There are excellent songs and dance numbers.
I:8747;2530;children still fall in love with this movie.
I:8747;2531;And Julie Andrews' performance still shines.
I:8747;2532;This is a really nice movie.
I:8747;2533;My 5 year daughter and 3 year old son love to watch this movie over and over again.
I:8747;2534;It is a great movie for the whole family.
I:8747;2535;Great/fun picture to watch along with saving Mr. Banks
I:8747;2536;They were delighted and so surprised that I 'already' knew the words to the songs.
I:8747;2537;It was wonderful to see their surprised faces at the things Mary could do and the joy of Burt and the chimney sweep dance.
I:8747;2538;The original theatrical mix is clear, magical and engrossing, and was actually nominated for an Academy award.
I:8747;2539;The songs are brilliant and wonderfully performed.
I:8747;2540;The climatic roof top sequence is a Disney addition that is the highlight.
I:8747;2541;I enjoyed the movie even more as an adult with an adult's recognition of the talent.
I:8747;2542;The extras for wonderful, too.
I:8747;2543;There were clips of the opening night premier that were just such fun to watch.
I:8747;2544;i would highly suggest that, if you enjoyed Mary Poppins years ago, you will treasure it now on a new level.
I:8747;2545;I always loved this movie and now so does my five.year old!!
I:8747;2546;The movie is full of whimsy and leaves you wanting to dance and sing.
I:8747;2547;It was just as it has always been and will always be.
I:8747;2548;I saw this wonderful movie twice, once in 1964 when it first came out, and again late in 1966, shortly after Disney's death, with a French soundtrack at a theatre in Rabat, Morocco.
I:8747;2549;I enjoyed it both times, although it did seem a bit strange to hear Julie and Dick singing in French (seemingly).
I:8747;2550;The Sherman brothers came through as never before or since, and the cast was perfect.
I:8747;2551;One of my all time favorite Disney classics.
I:8747;2552;And a great value for only $2.99.
I:8747;2553;Great movie and great value.
I:8747;2554;Mary Poppins is a classic Disney movie.
I:8747;2555;Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke make it a wonderful performance for people of all ages to enjoy.

I:8747;2557;I hope you enjoy it as well as my family has.
I:8747;2558;I love Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke in this movie.
I:8747;2559;A lighthearted musical, teaching great principles.
I:8747;2560;A classic filled with a believable fairy lady and a real world puck reminiscent of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream.
I:8747;2561;I loved Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke in this movie.
I:8747;2562;The music and the story were wonderful to me.

I:8747;2564;The visuals are great, and the story positive.
I:8747;2565;It has plentiful songs, and makes great company when doing work or other activity.
I:8747;2566;It is also a great price and it gives me an opportunity to watch the movie whenever I want with my daughter.
I:8747;2567;Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are just great together.
I:8747;2568;A good clean family movie.
I:8747;2569;"Never saw this when it first opened

I:8747;2580;This production is definitely a classic.
I:8747;2581;The music and storyline are so upbeat.
I:8747;2582;A real classic that my children watched over and over in their youth and knew every song by heart.
I:8747;2583;It arrived in perfect condition and in short order.

I:8747;2593;I never thought that she would love this movie as much as she does.
I:8747;2594;We are having great fun enjoying it!!!
I:8747;2595;It is an exceptonal production.
I:8747;2596;Wonderful story of a nanny who comes riding on an umbrella into the lonely lives of two children to transform their world and that of the entire household with her whimsy, her magic, her love and songs and spoons full of sugar.
I:8747;2597;this movie was a blend of animation and live action, one which creator Walt Disney considered to be his crowning achievement.
I:8747;2598;I remember watching Mary Poppins as a kid, and it brings back some fond memories of imagination and feel.
I:8747;2599;She has such a beautiful voice, which is on record for all time.
I:8747;2600;dick Van Dyke's amazing skills of dancing and acting as Bert and Senior Dawes STILL takes my breath away.
I:8747;2601;"time"" sequence and the dancing with the animated penguins."
I:8747;2602;the magic involved is imaginative for its time.
I:8747;2603;The power of human suggestion with Mary's singing is quite.
I:8747;2604;Her ability to talk to animals, making animated objects move.
I:8747;2605;It's well before the time of fantasy or magic in books or theaters these days :)!
I:8747;2606;This is truly a treasure of a film, and a great family fun movie.
I:8747;2607;I had forgotten how much I loved this movie.

I:8747;2628;The music, the story, the acting, the animation .
I:8747;2629;The movie won all kinds of awards.
I:8747;2630;It is timeless and is just as enjoyable by the whole family today as it was when it was first released.
I:8747;2631;I always felt that Dick Van Dyke should have won the Oscar for his role.
I:8747;2632;It probably sounds great on the proper audio setup, but something is just amiss for those of us watching this film on a regular television set with 2.
I:8747;2633;otherwise, an excellent set packed with features!
I:8747;2634;The movie is an awesome classic with catchy tunes!
I:8747;2635;Great work from two of the best acors in the business, Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.

I:8747;2637;They loved it and watched it many times.
I:8747;2638;I guess there is good reason it's a classic Disney film.
I:8747;2639;This classic has just as much heart as I remember it having when I watched it as a child.
I:8747;2640;This was a great movie when it came out.
I:8747;2641;It was a great movie for years.

I:8747;2649;It's a favorite in our household.
I:8747;2650;Mary Poppins is a wonderful show!

I:8747;2654;1964: Julie Andrews was awarded the Oscar for Best Actress in her performance as Mary Poppins.
I:8747;2655;born Julie Andrews was an accomplished singer on the American musical stage, as well as a gifted actress who would later appear in such films as The Sound Of Music and Victor/Victoria.
I:8747;2656;She is most known for her work in this film.
I:8747;2657;"To many, it is the zenith of her career
I:8747;2658;"The Disney film was based on the British novelist P. l. Traver's books ""Mary Poppins"" and its sequel""Mary Poppins Comes Back""."
I:8747;2659;When the magical Mary Poppins comes into their lives, she transforms their lives through magical going ons (becoming part of a painting, having tea in the air) and brings happiness and remedy to the home that badly needs the affectionate attention of the overworked, uptight father.
I:8747;2660;the Oscar for Julie Andrews as best actress was well deserved.
I:8747;2661;The musical, for this is a musical (which unfortunately never became a Broadway musical) contains lots of upbeat and memorable songs, tinged at times with a melancholy sentiment.
I:8747;2662;"chimeney"" the latter which won Best Song, ""A Spoonful of Sugar"" and the hilarious ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious""."
I:8747;2663;heart adults and musical lovers, this film is perfect entertainment for everyone.
I:8747;2664;The digital version is so clear and the colors so vibrant.
I:8747;2665;This is one we will add to our movie collection.
I:8747;2666;"We enjoyed watching the movie and sharing the ""Mary Poppins"" experience with her."
I:8747;2667;But, true stories are almost always better than fiction.
I:8747;2668;Amazon Prime makes things so easy.
I:8747;2669;An old classic like this was great to share with my grandgirls.
I:8747;2670;All I can say is it is practically perfect in every way!!!
I:8747;2671;Excited to share this with my son for a new generation to appreciate it!
I:8747;2672;Released in 1964, this is a timeless classic.
I:8747;2673;Fun to watch with the family.
I:8747;2674;We all viewed it again after seeing Saving Mr. Banks .
I:8747;2675;Now she loves the movie and sings the songs all day long.
I:8747;2676;Other than that it is a great classic for all ages and all genders.
I:8747;2677;great for the entire family.
I:8747;2678;Had to watch it after Saving Mr. Banks, to get the underlying story.
I:8747;2679;Always a classic and fun anytime!
I:8747;2680;Great for the whole family!
I:8747;2681;Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke are super, as usual.
I:8747;2682;She loves it, Grandpa loves it.
I:8747;2683;My granddaughter loved this movie.
I:8747;2684;It is perfect for young children.
I:8747;2685;It allows children to flex their imaginations.
I:8747;2686;Something very important in development.
I:8747;2687;Imagination is very important in the creative process.
I:8747;2688;i'll be a life long fan though!
I:8747;2689;She loves the movie and I really enjoyed seeing it again.
I:8747;2690;"This 40th anniversary edition of ""Mary Poppins"" is absolutely fabulous."
I:8747;2691;A far better picture/sound than in the previous two issues.
I:8747;2692;This is a great feature if you are trying to teach your kids those wonderful, loving songs.
I:8747;2693;"This is one of the best discs Disney has ever put out, and its about time that ""Mary Poppins"" gets the same treatment as any other ""Vault Classic."""
I:8747;2694;An entertaining movie with great music.
I:8747;2695;thought I might enjoy seeing it again and sharing it with my nieces and nephews.
I:8747;2696;it just lets them float in the air like it's magical heroine.
I:8747;2697;And that's part of its charm.
I:8747;2698;the film holds up as well, even in this age of digital everything.
I:8747;2699;"Julie Andrews, of course, is ""practically perfect in every way"" as Mary ."
I:8747;2700;"a much more idiosyncratic character than the governess she famously played in ""Sound of Music"" a year later."
I:8747;2701;And that clear soprano voice .
I:8747;2702;Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as Bert .
I:8747;2703;But as a comic, a mime, a singer and a dancer he is charming as the Jack.
I:8747;2704;The colors are snappy and true.
I:8747;2705;"There is some great home movie footage of the chimney sweep dancers rehearsing ""Step in Time"" outside in the California heat stripped down to their skivvies."
I:8747;2706;a beautiful presentation of a classic film that adults and children can enjoy together.
I:8747;2707;It is a delightful fantasy.
I:8747;2708;=( not even sure it is worth it to send it back
I:8747;2709;Thought I had a classic.
I:8747;2710;but Julie Andrews certainly is way cute.
I:8747;2711;and Dick Van Dyke is entertaining.
I:8747;2712;love I. one of the best movies ever.
I:8747;2713;Probably one of the greatest works of the late Walt Disney himself.
I:8747;2714;After this film the Disney studio completely lost their touch in creating a great film.
I:8747;2715;Mary Poppins is everything that is fun and is wonderfully acted by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.
I:8747;2716;The colors, the music score, the story, costumes, set design is all a wonderful tribute to the greatest creative artist of all times, Walt Disney.
I:8747;2717;This is truly a classic for both young and old.
I:8747;2718;What a classic movie my 4 year old enjoyed the singing and dancing, and I enjoyed watching it again after years.
I:8747;2719;Mary Poppins was my alltime favorite movie as a child.
I:8747;2720;It has some of my favorite songs.
I:8747;2721;It is a great work song.
I:8747;2722;as for the film, I still believe there was never one more magical and entertaining.
I:8747;2723;Mary Poppins is one of the timeless classics, but my family decided we should watch it again before seeing Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;2724;That was a good decision and helped make Saving Mr. Banks (an excellent movie, BTW) a little more enjoyable.
I:8747;2725;Received it in a few days time.
I:8747;2726;It is an older movie but was still engaging for young children!
I:8747;2727;They loved the singing and magic of Mary Poppins!
I:8747;2728;The new blu ray is absolutely astounding.
I:8747;2729;Better than I remember it looking, EVER.
I:8747;2730;I especially enjoyed the merry.
I:8747;2731;Mary Poppins is my favorite movie of all time!
I:8747;2732;It's packed full of features that will make any fan of the movie drool.
I:8747;2733;Lots of truly meaty and entertaing stuff for the lover of the movie.
I:8747;2734;My three year old granddaughter thought it was riveting.
I:8747;2735;She was glued to the TV set until we had to pry her loose to go to bed.
I:8747;2736;this is one of the best re.
I:8747;2737;the movie is STILL(and will be for years to come) an aural and visual delight and designed for families and people of all ages.
I:8747;2738;interweaving a wonderful story with some groundbreaking techniques and special effects Disney took/takes us on a magical ride in a recreated slice of life from 1910.
I:8747;2739;julie Andrews plays her character with a wonderful reserve befitting the part and she sings beautifully.
I:8747;2740;the entire cast from the children,the servants to the admiral and the policeman all turn in a superb supporting job from beginning to end.
I:8747;2741;it is stunningly beautiful and was as I remembered it after all this time.
I:8747;2742;the set is loaded with a surfeit of extras that will satisfy even the most picky of movie buffs from footage of its' opening premiere in L. a. to a making.
I:8747;2743;award winning debut of Julie Andrews as the practically perfect, nay, perfect Mary and Dick Van Dyke as Bert the jack.
I:8747;2744;trades is also superb, even though his cockney accent comes and goes at whim.
I:8747;2745;the movie is brimming with many brilliant set.
I:8747;2746;"another standout sequence is ""Feed the Birds"" the prettiest song in the score."
I:8747;2747;Sometimes it tends to be precious(the children)and sweet(the children) but not sweet enough to bring cavities but all in all, Mary Poppins is still fresh and bright after 45 years and 45 years from now when most of us reading this will be memories, Mary Poppins will still be here to enchant and entertain.
I:8747;2748;This review is dedicated to my friend Jason.
I:8747;2749;Great dancing, great personnages, great acting,,,what's not to like.
I:8747;2750;Two hours of pure delight!
I:8747;2751;She can't quit talking about it.
I:8747;2752;No doubt this is a fantastic movie.
I:8747;2753;based game, for example, play according to the game rules).
I:8747;2754;"I understand Disney's desire to ""cross sell"" their new stuff based on their old stuff."
I:8747;2755;It's a treasure and I wish someone would make another like it.
I:8747;2756;My nieces and nephews loved it.
I:8747;2757;Very pleased with it, and would recommend it
I:8747;2758;Love watching it with my grand kids.
I:8747;2759;My teens wanted to see this again after our recent viewing of Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;2760;Well worth the watch again, but remember it is a long movie.
I:8747;2761;Saw this many years ago and saw something that reminded me about this great Movie sooooo!
I:8747;2762;My wife loves this movie.
I:8747;2763;On the plus side, I do like some of the music
I:8747;2764;The Music is fantastic, and Julie Andrews sure can sing.
I:8747;2765;Its a fabulous movie that ranks right up there with Wizard of Oz!
I:8747;2766;After seeing the movie The Saving of Mr. Banks, it was nice to see the original movie on which the story plot was based.
I:8747;2767;Disney is at it best with this movie, it ties righr in there with saving mr banks it bring the flim to life.
I:8747;2768;The drawing in the story is a pavement picture among many accomplished by an jack of all trades.
I:8747;2769;"And with that, take a better look at that background forest and the architecture of the colorful bridges, they still leave many animators in the country dust!Mary Poppins is, and always will be, Mr. Walt Disney's ""crowning achievement"". . . make no mistakes."
I:8747;2770;My 5 year old twins love this movie.
I:8747;2771;It's a very entertaining movie and they love to sing some of the songs.
I:8747;2772;"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is 1000 times more enjoyable and a better movie than ""Mary Poppins. """
I:8747;2773;a man with a medium position in a bank has 2 housekeepers and needs a nanny to take care of his 2 children when he has a wife?
I:8747;2774;the man is portrayed as arrogant and effeminate and the wife as a whimsical butterfly caring only about herself and her interests.
I:8747;2775;"Instead of being a mother and a teacher to her children she focuses all her attention at gallivanting in the world of men
I:8747;2776;This domineering nanny walks in and tells the man what to do and is probably why she won the Oscar.
I:8747;2777;And that it is paramount that the mother be excused from her responsibility in raising her children and that protesting and fighting against men is her true duty.
I:8747;2778;He also needed a job.
I:8747;2779;It was natural and it flowed.
I:8747;2780;That is a great movie.
I:8747;2781;I can understand 1 or 2 year old enjoying it but adults?
I:8747;2782;And, this was my first time seeing this movie that is so well spoken of.
I:8747;2783;As always, it's better to watch it or read it yourself than to believe what others think or say.
I:8747;2784;So be my guest and please watch it and then decide.
I:8747;2785;In the context of the 60's, it a really good movie musical especially for kids under 10.
I:8747;2786;She has watched it once now.
I:8747;2787;She loved this movie as a child.
I:8747;2788;And AGAIN this was the same great feel good neat to watch Mary Poppins we had stored in our minds and hearts.
I:8747;2789;great movie i got for my grandson to see and own.
I:8747;2790;he loves it and so do i.
I:8747;2791;this is one of the great old classic films from Disney, its is a film to see for the whole family.
I:8747;2792;I bought it for myself after watching, saving mr. Banks.
I:8747;2793;We saw it as a family and my son now calls it his movie.
I:8747;2794;I love that movie Mary poppins when I was young saw that.
I:8747;2795;now watch it again and totally understanding.
I:8747;2796;This movie is an all time favorite of mine.
I:8747;2797;I'd give it 20 stars if I could!
I:8747;2798;My daughter enjoyed it as much as I did when I was a little girl!
I:8747;2799;Great movie and still fun to watch as an adult.
I:8747;2800;Great Movie for the whole family.
I:8747;2801;Fun to watch a old movie that you watched as a kid and now see it from the perspective of an adult.
I:8747;2802;Older eyes and experience brings the real magic out in that movie.
I:8747;2803;A great movie that was as good now as it was in the 196o's.
I:8747;2804;Even though there are many wonderful Disney films, this particular selection far surpasses most children's and many adult films I have ever seen.
I:8747;2805;Julie Andrew's performance with a superbly chosen supporting cast could not be a more perfect accoutrement to P. l. Traver's book.
I:8747;2806;Children and adults of all ages will marvel and awe at the remarkable story presented here, and find themselves singing the amazing, well.
I:8747;2807;written songs for years to come.
I:8747;2808;I have loved this movie since I was a child and saw it in the theater.
I:8747;2809;(My wife and I enjoyed it too)
I:8747;2810;What a great movie to share with my granddaughters.
I:8747;2811;I remember all the lyrics!
I:8747;2812;Watch this before you go to see Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;2813;I can rate this movie in a few words, Awesome!
I:8747;2814;CLassic, I hate musicals but absolutely Love this movie!!!
I:8747;2815;It's one of my favorite movies of all time!!!
I:8747;2816;I've been watching this movie since I was 4 years old (1984) and I loved it, but didn't understand many of the adult nuances.
I:8747;2817;Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews are truly fantastic in this film.
I:8747;2818;If you absolutely loved Mary Poppins, make sure you add Saving Mr. Banks AND The Boys: The Sherman Brothers' Story to your collection.
I:8747;2819;All three of these movies will bring you to tears and uplift you again and again.
I:8747;2820;Will always be a favorite in my household.
I:8747;2821;Nothing like stimulating music, and excellent scenes that will help tap into your imaginative side.
I:8747;2822;thought it would be old for the little ones, but they loved it!
I:8747;2823;I remember it as a child and liked it but it didn't keep her attention span for very long.
I:8747;2824;My daughter is 3, and she loves Mary Poppins!
I:8747;2825;She sings along with all the songs.
I:8747;2826;If you don't like it you can go fly a kite!
I:8747;2827;kids and adults will love it.
I:8747;2828;and be a good listener.
I:8747;2829;the animation sequences are lovely, the birds and little animals.
I:8747;2830;every childhood should include many viewings of good ole Mary Poppins.
I:8747;2831;What a great classic movie.
I:8747;2832;Just went and saw 'Saving Mr. Banks' and we wanted to watch this movie since it had been a while.
I:8747;2833;Was just as great as we remembered from childhood!!
I:8747;2834;A family favorite to be passed on to the next generationAlways entertaining from the youngest member of family to the young at heart
I:8747;2835;My oldest daughter loved this movie when she was young.
I:8747;2836;Great classic to watch with the family during the holidays.
I:8747;2837;We had an 11 year girl old visiting and wanted some wholesome entertainment.
I:8747;2838;Maybe I've seen it too many times, but she enjoyed it.
I:8747;2839;My kids loved this movie and it was nice traveling back into my childhood with them while watching this movie.
I:8747;2840;I love hearing our kids sing the songs from this movie, so timeless!
I:8747;2841;Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and The Wizard of Oz are three of my favorite classic family movies from childhood.
I:8747;2842;I shared this with my grandchildren and they enjoyed it as well.
I:8747;2843;I wish Disney still made movies like this!
I:8747;2844;One of my most favorite Disney movies ever.
I:8747;2845;And my whole life, I've always wished I had a Mary Poppins bag.
I:8747;2846;We all enjoyed this baby boomers and the offspring.
I:8747;2847;It was a great experience to be taken back to Cherry Tree Lane Disney style.
I:8747;2848;This is a wonderful movie for the entire family to enjoy and makes me wish more wholesome entertainment became mainstream again.
I:8747;2849;Makes a perfect addition to our growing classic Disney collection.
I:8747;2850;It is every bit of good as I remembered.
I:8747;2851;Loved watching this right before Saving Mr. banks!
I:8747;2852;You should definitely pair them together to have a more joyous experience.
I:8747;2853;and good music all add to a pleasant experience.
I:8747;2854;Same old Mary Poppins, a cleaned up version with great color correction.
I:8747;2855;It was fun to watch and remember this wonderful classic.
I:8747;2856;Great family friendly movie with memorable characters!
I:8747;2857;Was a favorite of mine as a child and my kids too.
I:8747;2858;MARY POPPINS is a sheer delight no matter how many times you see it!
I:8747;2859;The movie is very Disney, and done in such a grand way that you are taken directly into the charm of Edwardian London.
I:8747;2860;Miraculously, the pieces of paper are reassembled and the magical Mary Poppins makes her appearance, with the children's requests in hand.
I:8747;2861;The scene where all the waiting nannies fly away is hilarious as are the domestics Hermoine Baddeley and Reta Shaw as they rescue the vases etc., from the daily vibrations caused by an eccentric local firing a cannon.
I:8747;2862;the children are properly English and really just a WEE bit naughty.
I:8747;2863;Julie Andrews is terrific and Dick Van Dyke is very good as Bert, though his cockney accent is pure Hollywood.
I:8747;2864;rate and the songs are memorable.
I:8747;2865;"(Disney's very favorite of all his films was ""Tuppence a Bag"" however ""ChimChimCheree"" won the academy award as best song of 1964(!)"
I:8747;2866;The animation sequences are among the best ever put on film (it was always difficult to do animation scenes with live actors).
I:8747;2867;This is widely regarded as Disney's masterpiece, it was certainly his most expensive film, and it grossed many times it's cost.
I:8747;2868;"Disney got the idea for Mary Poppins when, in the late 40's he would hear his daughter giggling constantly while reading the books by P. l. Travers
I:8747;2869;It's got a great soundtrack (don't know if it's still available but I inherited my mom's old LP record!)
I:8747;2870;, great acting (anything with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke has to be good), and has some scenes where live action and animation are combined.
I:8747;2871;Not sure what extras come with the newest one but the one I saw in 2001 had a good section about the making of the film.
I:8747;2872;i recommend this to anyone, and it will come as a blessing if you're sick of the garbage that Hollywood is making today.
I:8747;2873;The picture distorted and wavered halfway through this classic film.
I:8747;2874;watch this after seeing saving Mr Banks.
I:8747;2875;To see the wonder on their faces and hear their laughter helped us relive seeing it many years ago .
I:8747;2876;It's still a romp with lots of fun as well as tender moments at the end.
I:8747;2877;A great movie found at a great price.
I:8747;2878;Our entire family has been enjoying introducing the next generation to this friendly classic.
I:8747;2879;One of the best Disney films ever.
I:8747;2880;Happy to receive our Mary Poppins.
I:8747;2881;I nice change from the Disney Fairies and Disney Princesses in our house and both kids (1 and 4) love it.
I:8747;2882;My mom took me to see this when I was just a lad,and it was one of the best times that I had ever had.
I:8747;2883;last month my wife and I, we watched it with our kids,and they enjoyed it just as much as we ever did.
I:8747;2884;We'd love to see more movies like this.
I:8747;2885;Just a lot of great entertainment and good life lessons.
I:8747;2886;This is such a wonderful movie.
I:8747;2887;this movie was so full of surprises and has always been my second most favorite movie (after the Wizard of Oz.)
I:8747;2888;Julie Andrews was the most perfect nanny ever.
I:8747;2889;The music was wonderful and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious was the biggest song hit in school (sung is just about every school's concert in our town.)
I:8747;2890;This movie was full of magic.
I:8747;2891;I am so thrill for the 40th anniversary and will get this.
I:8747;2892;What can you say, it's a classic, very fun to watch and to remember.
I:8747;2893;Very clear and the whole family loved it!
I:8747;2894;Wholesome entertainment for the entire family.
I:8747;2895;My granddaughter absolutely loved it.
I:8747;2896;She smiled through the whole thing.
I:8747;2897;I forgot how much fun it was!
I:8747;2898;Love it as I did when I was a kid!
I:8747;2899;Even my 2 year old loves dancing and singing to it.
I:8747;2900;Maybe someday when I go to Europe I can play it or give it to someone who lives there.
I:8747;2901;Excellent family movie for all ages.
I:8747;2902;I watched this when I was younger and now again and I am 60 with my grandchildren and just love this movie.
I:8747;2903;If you saw 'Saving Mr. Banks' you will want to see the movie behind it.
I:8747;2904;Mary Poppins is always a fun movie for all ages.
I:8747;2905;transported to the magical world of Mary Poppins.
I:8747;2906;I have loved this movie for as long as I remember.
I:8747;2907;My mom had bought it for me when I was really young, and I loved it ever since.
I:8747;2908;If you love magic, fantasy, a great laugh and old movies this is the movie for you.
I:8747;2909;I definetly think that this is a movie worth keeping in your collection.
I:8747;2910;The cast is great, the songs are great, you'll be hooked on!!!
I:8747;2911;Also great to get is the Sound of Music.
I:8747;2912;Should still be a wonderful movie for young people and it does impart good values.
I:8747;2913;ray technology makes screening this print a great experience.
I:8747;2914;There are a number of extras that provide background about the film and interesting stories from the actors.
I:8747;2915;This classic film has something for every age group, and I get something new from it every time I see it.
I:8747;2916;She loved it by the way.
I:8747;2917;the movie is fantastic despite these shortcomings.
I:8747;2918;takes and scenes from the Oscars for that year.
I:8747;2919;Seeing Saving Mr. Banks rekindled my interest in the movie, especially in knowing more about P. l. Travers.
I:8747;2920;It was in good condition.
I:8747;2921;I love this movie and can not wait to watch it with my children.
I:8747;2922;its an all time favorite.
I:8747;2923;their description was perfect on this item an i am very satisfied with the service.
I:8747;2924;i would order again from them an recommend them as well.
I:8747;2925;Its a great movie for all ages.
I:8747;2926;Lots of music, dancing, imagination, choreography.
I:8747;2927;my grandchildren have enjoyed this film more than once.
I:8747;2928;Great trip to the past .
I:8747;2929;The special effects, music, singing, and story all made this a great family movie.
I:8747;2930;Julie Andrews is wonderful and Dick Van Dyke was great, too.
I:8747;2931;She is the reason for the success of Mary Poppins and Sound of Music !
I:8747;2932;The kids enjoyed the Digital download
I:8747;2933;Being a Julie Andrews fan, this is one of the first movies I watched with her in it.
I:8747;2934;Disney's eye for talent was magnificent.
I:8747;2935;This movie really is Disney's masterpeice, mixing live.
I:8747;2936;Wonderful music scores, wonderful storyline, all.
I:8747;2937;all Mary Poppins is 'Practically perfect in everyway.'
I:8747;2938;After watching Saving Mr Banks, it put a new light on the movie.
I:8747;2939;It was still a great musical experience.
I:8747;2940;The movie is an excellent example of Disney at its best
I:8747;2941;Mary Poppins is a wonder.
I:8747;2942;For everyone who loves Mary Poppins this video is the best.
I:8747;2943;My children watch it over and over again always a favorite.
I:8747;2944;Uplifting and fun musical with a meaning
I:8747;2945;A classic it is indeed.
I:8747;2946;I've enjoyed it since I was a little kid.
I:8747;2947;It was fun to visit it again, knowing about the author's story.
I:8747;2948;We love Mary Poppins even more than most, because we've seen our daughter play the role!
I:8747;2949;As always a delightful movie to view and hear.
I:8747;2950;so very well made and perfect for kids of all ages.

I:8747;2952;It's a wonderful movie one of the Disney classics!
I:8747;2953;I'm a Disney freak, which always surprised my friends that I never got Mary Poppins for my Disney collection.
I:8747;2954;Watched it the first day I got it and I relived all the wonder of Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews.
I:8747;2955;Works great and I love Saving Mr. Banks and think it needs to be a double feature.
I:8747;2956;Excellent extra's as well in the movie.
I:8747;2957;I was so excited to find it for her and she was thrilled to get it, and watched it the night she received it.
I:8747;2958;year old grandson loves this movie and my daughter feels good about letting him watch something with no violence and good values.
I:8747;2959;when i got the movie it was broken they called me when i left a review and asked what was wrong and they fixed the problum they are a good compiny!
I:8747;2960;For over 50 years, Mary Poppins has defined Disney Magic and is an excellent film.
I:8747;2961;with Five Academy Awards, catchy songs from the Sherman Brothers and outstanding performances from Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.
I:8747;2962;Mary Poppins is fun from start to finish, and you'll find yourself singing to the songs Spoonful of Sugar and Chim Chim Che.
I:8747;2963;I bought it as a gift for my grandmother who just adores it.
I:8747;2964;My daughter and husband love it so much.
I:8747;2965;Tjis movie is old thing but It is still interesting.
I:8747;2966;Great songs that she even sings around the house.
I:8747;2967;even tho it was made 50 years ago the magic of Mary Poppins is still there.
I:8747;2968;Hello,When I was little I remember watching this movie with my family and friends and I still even remember so much of the detail.
I:8747;2969;This is such a great story and it and the songs will stick with your children or any children giving them something to sing and play with.
I:8747;2970;I highly recommend this classic movie to anyone with kids or as a gift to anyone that has them!
I:8747;2971;I know I benefited, my friends did, and the kids in your life will too.
I:8747;2972;and the adults :)I hoped you liked my review and found it useful!!!!
I:8747;2973;I bought this as a gift for my husband, and grandchildren.
I:8747;2974;We love this movie and really liked the special features on this.
I:8747;2975;Definitely worth the wait, we have watched it twice so far lol!
I:8747;2976;A delightful movie the whole family will enjoy.

I:8747;2979;Would definitely recommend to kids of all ages
I:8747;2980;This movie is my absolute favorite!
I:8747;2981;I of course recommend it to all families and think it should be in everyone's home.
I:8747;2982;It was so fun to have my 5 year old granddaughter start singing along with me to all the same songs I so enjoyed as a child.
I:8747;2983;One of my favorite movies and every family should own a copy, but I'm still hoping for a release that has the original release's 1.75 aspect ratio.
I:8747;2984;all that said, the movie is still amazing in every edition and most will not notice nor miss the cropped edges.
I:8747;2985;This movie is one of Disney and the Sherman brothers finest works.
I:8747;2986;I am very excited to see Saving Mr. Banks this holiday season.
I:8747;2987;A true Disney classic .
I:8747;2988;wholesome viewing for even the youngest members of the family.
I:8747;2989;We got it to show our teenagers after seeing, Saving Mr. Banks at the theater.
I:8747;2990;Our sons thought the movie was good but they are used to movies with updated special effects.
I:8747;2991;Nearly all successful childrens films, books, etc. have something to do with the supra.
I:8747;2992;She crafts order from chaos, turns brats into nice children, and turns real life into a happy cartoon.
I:8747;2993;The songs are ageless, timeless, and charming.
I:8747;2994;Mary Poppins is a very powerful witch indeed!
I:8747;2995;"For older people like me, I am way impressed by the seamless special effect
I:8747;2996;A classic for good reason.
I:8747;2997;A friend suggested that we see this before we saw Saving Mr. Banks with Tom Hanks.
I:8747;2998;I loved it and my granddaughter loved it too!
I:8747;2999;Mary Poppins gives the children lessons of character and imagination.
I:8747;3000;It arrived quickly, in great condition and priced fairly for a Disney movie.
I:8747;3001;Loved this movie when I was little and can't wait for the kids to open it for Christmas and watch it.
I:8747;3002;I know they will love it just as much as my husband and I did when we were younger.
I:8747;3003;Wonderfully simple entertainment with virtue.
I:8747;3004;He clapped his hands, laughed out loud and kicked his feet.
I:8747;3005;He especially loves the part when Dick Van Dyke is dancing on the rooftops.
I:8747;3006;Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I:8747;3007;This was a gift my Mom requested for Mother's Day.
I:8747;3008;She was so pleased to get it.
I:8747;3009;Loved the movie when I saw it as a little girl in the 1980's on VHS and still ADORE IT to this day!!!
I:8747;3010;Great songs, effects, and the casting is unsurpassed.
I:8747;3011;Every family should see this movie.
I:8747;3012;The screen format lets you see what you never saw before!
I:8747;3013;Amazon video on demand works perfectly
I:8747;3014;And the extra features on this 2.
I:8747;3015;Great interviews with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, one of the Sherman brothers (songwriter), and the girl who played Jane that really show how special the movie.
I:8747;3016;making process was, which then translated to joy on the screen.
I:8747;3017;and dances around the living room with the chimney sweeps!
I:8747;3018;Had to share this classic with our 6 year old daughter.
I:8747;3019;Still wonderful after all these years!
I:8747;3020;I now have a child and want him to enjoy some of the same classics I enjoyed when I was a child.
I:8747;3021;I love this movie and I know he will too!
I:8747;3022;and generaly I love movies!!
I:8747;3023;On the other hand I liked watching it after I watch Save Mr Bank the story behind Mary Poppins' movie.
I:8747;3024;The original 2 channel audio track is the best sounding audio track on this release.
I:8747;3025;Join the practically perfect Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) for a Jolly Holiday as she magically turns every chore into a game and every day into a whimsical adventure.
I:8747;3026;Along the way, you'll be enchanted by unforgettable characters such as the multitalented chimney sweep Bert (Dick Van Dyke).
I:8747;3027;Unpack Mary's magical carpet bag full of bonus features, including all.
I:8747;3028;new bonus from the supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Broadway production of MARY POPPINS.
I:8747;3029;A timeless Classic For all ages.
I:8747;3030;My kids Loved it also.
I:8747;3031;This is a great family movie.
I:8747;3032;Very funny in all ways.
I:8747;3033;It is a wonderful movie, a flawless blend of live action and animation, with some of the most beautiful and detailed matte paintings in movie history.
I:8747;3034;Julie Andrews, who won a Best Actress Oscar in her film debut, is the perfect nanny in 1910 Edwardian England to Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber).
I:8747;3035;And the movie won four other technical and music Oscars, with a still untopped thirteen total nominations.
I:8747;3036;"action/animation day in the park (""Supercalifragilisticexpealidocis""), a tea party on a ceiling with Ed Wynn as Uncle Albert, the hauntingly beautiful ""Feed the Birds"" with bird woman Jane Darwell, and the Oscar."
I:8747;3037;(Peter Ellenshaw allegedly did 100 breathtakingly beautiful and detailed matte paintings for this movie, winning a well.
I:8747;3038;(Cotton Warburton won an Editing Oscar.)
I:8747;3039;Glynis Johns is an ideal and likeable suffragette and feminist Mrs. Banks.
I:8747;3040;mARY POPPINS is a fabulous feast of a movie, with some of the greatest visual effects and most beautiful matte paintings I have ever seen.
I:8747;3041;The cast is perfection, the writing something that even grouchy Pamela Travers should be pleased with.
I:8747;3042;clear image clarity, and awesome 5.1 Home Theatre Mix THX sound to top any theater sound system.
I:8747;3043;scenes documentary shows how most of the magnificent visual effects were achieved, should you want the illusion spoiled.
I:8747;3044;With it, a hundred filmmaking aspects come together perfectly to create a masterpiece that gets my vote as Walt Disney's crowning film achievement.
I:8747;3045;The video is crisp and clear with only a small hint of edge enhancement.
I:8747;3046;Simply amazing for a film this old.
I:8747;3047;for the Mary Poppins fan, there is a tremendous amount of bonus material.
I:8747;3048;There is a game to be played for children and a lot of other material.
I:8747;3049;A bonus on the first disc (the feature) is the ability to watch with fun pop.
I:8747;3050;up facts that give you interesting information about certain scenes.
I:8747;3051;Even if a person can't appreciate the imaginative brilliance of the film, they should be able to see the technical brilliance of the special effects.
I:8747;3052;George Lucas should take notes from this film to make his works actually worth watching.
I:8747;3053;From a company about giving dreams and entertainment to children, to a company concerned only with the bottom line and the next gimmick.
I:8747;3054;For those that feel that this isn't there type of movie, simply watch with an open mind.
I:8747;3055;highly recommended for Mary Poppins fans and film fans.
I:8747;3056;Amazing animation considering it is 50 years old.
I:8747;3057;it was just as great to see it again.
I:8747;3058;We'd keep on watching it!
I:8747;3059;while they each made many memorable movies, this is one that really showcases their almost unique combination of talents.
I:8747;3060;this is one of those rare movies that really is as good as you have heard.
I:8747;3061;a cast made in heaven, stunning sets, costumes, impeccable direction and production, some of the best songs and dance routines you could possibly wish for .
I:8747;3062;Van Dyke's sheer genius is a joy to behold .
I:8747;3063;julie also worked closely with the brilliant Pamela Travers in order to do justice to the author's creation, and the two really hit it off.
I:8747;3064;The results of her thoughtful collaboration are here to see and savor.
I:8747;3065;whether you see the movie as Pamela's homage to the transforming power of the Feminine on the eve of woman suffrage, or just a stunning piece of solid family entertainment (and we could sure use a whole lot more of that, especially these days) Mary Poppins delivers beyond your wildest dreams.
I:8747;3066;it may be a no brainer to say this, but for more Julie, The Sound Of Music is a must, and for another Dick Van Dyke showcase (including a masterful, complex dance routine), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is also essential viewing.
I:8747;3067;then of course, you should really watch the superb David Tomlinson and the divine Angela Lansbury in Bedknobs and Broomsticks.
I:8747;3068;so much brilliance, so little time.
I:8747;3069;"Two absolutely magical people
I:8747;3070;Our kids loved Mary Poppins.
I:8747;3071;This is one of those classics for all ages.
I:8747;3072;The kids loved the mix of movie and cartoon.
I:8747;3073;FIRST an important note: Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together.
I:8747;3074;disney repackagings its classic films about every 10 years for their Anniversary Editions.
I:8747;3075;The Exciting New Content on this 2013 package includes Becoming Mr. Sherman an new 11.
I:8747;3076;The other Exciting New Content is the Mary.

I:8747;3086;There can be no better way than bring brightness to life than watching Disney's Mary Poppins.
I:8747;3087;Great as a family film or for anyone.
I:8747;3088;Amazing how clean fun can be so entertaining!

I:8747;3099;We all need some reminder of love and fantasy in our lives.
I:8747;3100;Can't think of a nicer person to teach us to make life a jolly holiday than Mary.
I:8747;3101;Bert is there right with keeping a smile on our face and love in our hearts to remind us to be our self.
I:8747;3102;Still love the dancing of the chimney sweeps.
I:8747;3103;It was heart warming to watch the face of my young grandson as he enjoyed the antics of actors and actresses.

I:8747;3105;Every child should see this movie.
I:8747;3106;The songs are wonderful and fun to sing with your child.
I:8747;3107;A classic great for young and old viewers alike.
I:8747;3108;disc set with all sorts of fun goodies!
I:8747;3109;"Especially great are clips from the opening premiere and ""deconstructing"" musical numbers like ""Jolly Holiday"" in which you see how the magic was made in the chalk drawing segment."
I:8747;3110;"Dick Van Dyke co. stars as Bert, a cheery chimney sweep and good ""magical"" friend to Mary Poppins."
I:8747;3111;in Mary Poppins, Robert Stevenson directs a classic musical of creativity and imagination.
I:8747;3112;This film, of both live action and animation, is guaranteed to keep a person of any age mystified through all 139 minutes of fun and music.

I:8747;3114;ee), and Best Visual Effects.
I:8747;3115;i give this film five stars because it can be enjoyed by audiences of any age.
I:8747;3116;It is also enjoyed as much today as it was on its original release date of 1964.
I:8747;3117;"In a nut shell, this Walt Disney Production is ""practically perfect in every way!!"""
I:8747;3118;She enjoyed watching this movie a lot!
I:8747;3119;We love Mary Poppins and love this Blu.
I:8747;3120;Everything to love, and the enchanting voice of Julie Andrews, this took me back in time, and I found myself humming the old classic songs the next day.
I:8747;3121;My oldest loves the singing and my 2 year old loves to dance along.
I:8747;3122;All in all a great film.
I:8747;3123;I enjoyed this 1960's ish musical for kids.
I:8747;3124;It gives me great joy to watch it.
I:8747;3125;This will always be a classic film.
I:8747;3126;ray just adds so much more vivid pop to the colors.
I:8747;3127;This is truly one of my most favorite movies of all time.
I:8747;3128;Well made and really brings back memories of the original version.
I:8747;3129;I would definately recommend this to anyone to see.

I:8747;3136;it also received a special scientific award for the creation and application of Color Traveling Matte Composite Cinematography, which helped make the combination of live action and animated actors in the film possible.
I:8747;3137;My granddaughter, five year old Claire, sat riveted the whole time!
I:8747;3138;the transfer for this movie is nothing short of breathtaking.
I:8747;3139;Colors are vibrant, the audio is clear and crisp, and it's the best this movie's ever looked or sounded.
I:8747;3140;The songs will sound nothing short of spectacular while special effects sequences will still be as magical as ever.
I:8747;3141;The short The Cat That Looked At A King is charming and a wonderful watch.
I:8747;3142;The Musical Reunion and Musical Journey featurettes are both charming to watch.
I:8747;3143;There's lots of footage from the world premiere, still art galleries, publicity materials, and more.
I:8747;3144;Disc 1 boasts the most complete soundtrack album ever available.
I:8747;3145;The packaging and content is truly excellent.
I:8747;3146;I definitely recommend both with full enthusiasm.
I:8747;3147;Julie Andrews with her beautiful voice simply charms her way straight into your heart.
I:8747;3148;Watching this movie left me feeling happy and warm and fuzzy inside.
I:8747;3149;i give this movie a definite thumbs up and a must watch if you have children.
I:8747;3150;I loved it in my childhood, my children loved it and now I pass that love to my grandbabies.
I:8747;3151;This is a classic and was overjoyed to be able to get a copy as it is one of my all.
I:8747;3152;This is one of my favorite movies even to this day.
I:8747;3153;The songs are fantastic, the acting is marvelous from everyone, the pacing is absolutely perfect, and the animated scenes look amazing, even compared to modern technology.
I:8747;3154;the music will stay in your head for days.
I:8747;3155;My kids love it and it has a little extra for adults to enjoy after growing up with just the vhs version!
I:8747;3156;definitely recommend this one and not the 45th anniversary edition.
I:8747;3157;I recommend this movie for all ages!
I:8747;3158;Still a classic, introduced our Grandson to Mary Poppins, he sat down and watched the entire movie, not an easy feat for a 5 year old.
I:8747;3159;Fast delivery at a great price!
I:8747;3160;This is a gift for my mother and she was positively jumping for joy at the thought of watching Mary Poppins ward off Dick Van Dyke's advances through interpretive song and dance.
I:8747;3161;I have loved this movie since I was little now my grandkids love it too
I:8747;3162;Gave this as a gift to a Disney Classic movie enthusiast.
I:8747;3163;She loves this timeless film.
I:8747;3164;A great addition to her collection.
I:8747;3165;"I just got the sense you not only need to be a ""kid at heart"" for this one, you got to BE A KID."
I:8747;3166;"OTOH I recently saw ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1971) and greatly enjoyed it."
I:8747;3167;put it on for your kids, and go do something else while it's playing.
I:8747;3168;It may be a little long for younger kids but our family enjoyed it very much.
I:8747;3169;Julie Andrews looks so young and Dick Van Dyke is so talented.
I:8747;3170;I was surprised to see how my my 5 and 3 year old loved it too.
I:8747;3171;Julie Andrews is spectacular and this is a classic Disney piece.
I:8747;3172;The entire movie and special features lead perfectly for the new movie Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;3173;One of Disney's very best musicals, Mary Poppins is an unforgettable children's classic.
I:8747;3174;It combines memorable songs that get stuck in your head with the forward and sarcastic dialogue of the unsurpassable Poppins, and a psychedelic story that employs superbly integrated traditionally animated characters.
I:8747;3175;Part fairy tale, part daydream, and all magic, the sights, songs and laughs propel this Academy Award.
I:8747;3176;winning picture (Andrews took home the Oscar for Best Actress, and the film was nominated for a whopping 13 golden boys .
I:8747;3177;the most of any Disney film) to the top of the lists for the greatest family films ever made.
I:8747;3178;The two children, Jane and Michael, create their own list of requirements for the prospective woman, but George scoffs and throws the paper into the fireplace.
I:8747;3179;filled adventure into his artwork .
I:8747;3180;firstly on a jolly holiday in a picturesque English countryside (the kids are curiously absent for the first two lengthy sequences with dancing penguins and barnyard animals) which segues into a merry.
I:8747;3181;"at first it seems that practically perfect (and rather vain) Mary Poppins is there to straighten out the wily kids
I:8747;3182;ordered man absorbed with his work, and rarely has time for his children and their unseemly hullabaloo (or the sugary female thinking of his wife), while Winifred is leading women's rights movements .
I:8747;3183;a cheerful creativity surrounds the whole film, from the laugh.
I:8747;3184;The songs are some of the best in any of Disney's films, the mixing of traditional animation with the live action characters is fantastic, and Andrews' performance is (spit) spot.
I:8747;3185;Although the running time is noticeably lengthy for a family film (the following year's The Sound of Music was, of course, even longer) and the scripting of Poppins changed drastically from the original story by P. l. Travers (for the better), it is one of the most memorable and delightful musicals from Walt Disney .
I:8747;3186;one that hasn't aged and remains universally entertaining.
I:8747;3187;My kids watch this movie all the time.
I:8747;3188;"Evet song is a classic from the Oscar winning ""Chim Chim Cherrie"" to the final tune ""Lets go fly a kite""."
I:8747;3189;One of the best routine was the chimminy sweep dance number where you had breathtaking view of the London skyline.
I:8747;3190;Both Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke were at their musical best.
I:8747;3191;The part where they were riding on the carousel horses is a pure classic.
I:8747;3192;This movie is the pinnacle of family entertainment that has entertained children for nearly three generations.
I:8747;3193;This movie is just amazing.
I:8747;3194;"If you like this movie, I would also recommend ""the sound of music""."
I:8747;3195;It's a kids movie that's timeless and ageless.
I:8747;3196;Fantastic in every possible way.
I:8747;3197;My top movie for the kids and family to enjoy.
I:8747;3198;Soon, she is leading the children in song, displaying her magical spells and clearly enchanting the children in each and every way.
I:8747;3199;Mary Poppins, released in 1964, represented a magical blend of live action and animation that, at the time, was technologically very advanced.
I:8747;3200;Then, remembering that this film was made in 1964, these same special effects became charming and wholly fitting for the story.
I:8747;3201;The story is told through the eyes of the Banks children, and the use of these special effects helps to put us in their shoes.
I:8747;3202;The outdated look of these effects serves the point of view of the story beautifully and adds to the charm of it.
I:8747;3203;I can't even imagine how slick and uninviting the same film would be if it were made today, with CGI special effects coming out of the woodwork.Yes, the film is very saccharin at times, but this helps to define the viewpoint of the children as well.
I:8747;3204;"one of the most delightful things about ""Mary Poppins"" is the musical score containing many classic songs."
I:8747;3205;The true mark of a good Broadway musical is that you leave the theater humming the tunes.
I:8747;3206;The same holds true for a musical film.
I:8747;3207;All of the best musicals remain classics because we remember the songs.
I:8747;3208;The Sherman Brothers created a great score of music and songs all of which served to enhance and supplement the story.
I:8747;3209;While watching the making of documentary, I learned an interesting fact.
I:8747;3210;It is a truly remarkable, accomplished performance, amazing for someone acting in their first film.
I:8747;3211;He brings an unabashed enthusiasm to the role which is also very fitting.
I:8747;3212;Mary Poppins is a classic.
I:8747;3213;Every spoon full of sugar helps the film remain a classic in each and every way.
I:8747;3214;Daughter and I absolutely loved this movie!!
I:8747;3215;Glad I bought it as a suprise for her!
I:8747;3216;classic movie, great for the whole family.
I:8747;3217;it's 50 years old and still a popular hit!
I:8747;3218;Musicals that do really annoy me, and this is an example.
I:8747;3219;There's always talk that this movie was famous for combing live action and animation.
I:8747;3220;The movie stops and the movie gets fuzzy.
I:8747;3221;I have always enjoyed this movie and I was able to show it to my two children.
I:8747;3222;I got this for my grand kids.
I:8747;3223;Was i wrong!They not only loved it but have watched it time and time again.
I:8747;3224;They get up and dance with the chimney sweeps, and they sing the songs!
I:8747;3225;Thank you so very much!
I:8747;3226;This 1964 Disney masterpiece has it all: great music, great dancing, great acting, good animation, character development, humor, charm, and a unique story.
I:8747;3227;The film features some of the all.
I:8747;3228;time classic songs, which add warmth to the experience.
I:8747;3229;The acting is superb, with a vivacious Julie Andrews as the perfect choice in her role, as is the charming Dick Van Dyke.
I:8747;3230;The actors in this movie mesh, which generates great character development, thus moving the story along.
I:8747;3231;Mary Poppins is a balanced movie that's anchored by a great and unique story that touches our senses and leaves a lasting impression.
I:8747;3232;A timeless classic that shouldn't be missed!
I:8747;3233;A delightful and fun movie with memorable songs and performances.
I:8747;3234;Great for mixed aged kids.
I:8747;3235;G rated for the younger people.
I:8747;3236;This is a movie that crosses generations.
I:8747;3237;One to keep and show to the entire family.
I:8747;3238;classic that you must have, delivered quickly, price is right, if you like julie andrews you will love this calssic that everyone should see.
I:8747;3239;6 yr old daughter really enjoyed it.
I:8747;3240;How many classic films from decades past have both stars doing the commentary?
I:8747;3241;"but there's more: a documentary entitled ""Disney on Broadway"" provides a fascinating behind the scenes look at the craftsmen who adapted P. l. Travers work to a new venue: the stage."
I:8747;3242;While obviously a bit of a puff piece, and there's a whiff of self.
I:8747;3243;congratulation here and there, frankly, much of the pride here is well deserved.
I:8747;3244;Travers' well known scorn for certain aspects of Disney's film is well known.
I:8747;3245;How Disney Exec Thomas Schumacher and producer Cameron Macintosh finessed the great dame into giving them the rights makes for interesting viewing.
I:8747;3246;A classic movie that never gets old!
I:8747;3247;Mary Poppins was a pleasant step back into childhood.
I:8747;3248;But it was also a movie that was entertaining for adults.
I:8747;3249;I found myself enjoying myself in the midst of watching this movie.
I:8747;3250;This is quite a surreal romp through England that anyone with heart and their own imagination will enjoy.
I:8747;3251;Loved watching this with my son!
I:8747;3252;He has asked to watch it everyday since her watched it the first time!
I:8747;3253;Mary Poppins is such a classic movie!
I:8747;3254;Full of wonderful song and dance scenes and magical adventures!
I:8747;3255;My grand daughters loved this movie especially the music!
I:8747;3256;I got it for my granddaughter to watch.
I:8747;3257;She likes it and watched it more than once.
I:8747;3258;The kids started watching it immediately and I loved listening to them sing my favorite songs from the movie.
I:8747;3259;I felt just as excited as the first time I saw it, was shocked at Dick Van Dyke's blue eyes, the creamy complexion of Julie Andrews and the sheer fun of this movie.
I:8747;3260;and my technie kids loved the story .
I:8747;3261;my son wants to be a chimney sweep!
I:8747;3262;My girls watch it all the time.
I:8747;3263;i recommend for anyone who loves the classics.
I:8747;3264;I am a Prime Account member but this was an amazing shipping feat.
I:8747;3265;This version of the movie is just perfect.
I:8747;3266;I am a very satisfied customer.
I:8747;3267;I think this is a very good value .
I:8747;3268;I recommend watching this after Saving Mr Banks .
I:8747;3269;"Celebrate the 40th Anniversary of Bert,Mr. Banks,Mrs. Banks,Michael,Jane,Uncle Albert and of course the title character, the delightful nanny ""MARY POPPINS""."
I:8747;3270;Genius Walt Disney's timeless musical masterpiece that brought together a charming and brilliant tripod.
I:8747;3271;The film got raved reviews and 5 academy awards including Best Actress Julie Andrews as the lovely delightful herione.
I:8747;3272;One of Walt Disney's crowning achievements.
I:8747;3273;When I watch this, I love to laugh, loud,long and clear.
I:8747;3274;Celebrate the 40th anniversary of the music and the magic of this legendary practically perfect masterpiece that will be adored for another 40 years and so on and so fourth.
I:8747;3275;"Mary Poppins ""Mary Poppins Practically perfect in every way"""
I:8747;3276;I was always a Mary Poppins fan as a child, but thanks to the new Saving Mr. Banks movie I've been re.
I:8747;3277;There is something about her, both Disney's and Travers' versions of her, that embodies imagination and seems to be both the essence of jollity and the earnestness of tragedy.
I:8747;3278;Having read the books, I understand why Travers did not want her Poppins to receive the Disney treatment, but unlike her, I believe the adaptation was a brilliant work of art that added dimension to the books rather than take them away.
I:8747;3279;as for the Blu Ray itself, I found the transfer to be exquisite.
I:8747;3280;There's no question that the movie has never looked or sounded this fantastic on home media before.
I:8747;3281;The soundtrack includes some of the best songs from any musical, ever.
I:8747;3282;story of Mary Poppins is nearly as incredible as the film itself.
I:8747;3283;it was a symphony of extraordinary talent that happened to come together and create one of the masterpieces of cinema.
I:8747;3284;For art lovers, all this history is positively juicy.
I:8747;3285;watching, but either way, Mary Poppins is a classic and will be cherished by everyone.
I:8747;3286;A Julie Andrews classic with a stellar performance by Dick Van Dyke.
I:8747;3287;Rooftop dance routine worth the price of admission.
I:8747;3288;Better now then when I was young.
I:8747;3289;The seamless transition to song is a credit to the actors and the Sherman Bros.
I:8747;3290;this is a timeless movie.
I:8747;3291;The songs are classic, the dancing is entertaining, particularly when penguins are involved and Mary Poppins' magical powers never fail to amaze my children.
I:8747;3292;this is sure to be a hit with kids of all ages as indeed, it has proven for over 36 years.
I:8747;3293;This great classic just keeps getting better every year.
I:8747;3294;I love the songs and the antics and the children.
I:8747;3295;my excitement vanished part way through the film when it stopped playing.
I:8747;3296;nice to hear the kids sing these classic tunes watching it!!!
I:8747;3297;I bought it for my dog and she enjoyed it enormously.
I:8747;3298;The service and price were excellent.
I:8747;3299;I bought this movie for my dog.
I:8747;3300;But my 4 year old dog loves it.
I:8747;3301;She's watched it many times.
I:8747;3302;It was wonderful, as I remember it.
I:8747;3303;for a used tape and for the price you can't beat it, something for my grandkids to watch when they come over, well worth the inexpensive price I paid
I:8747;3304;my daughter laughed all the way through it.
I:8747;3305;The tape was in good condition and I enjoyed the movie.
I:8747;3306;Definitely recommend it for family viewing.
I:8747;3307;I really wanted to watch it again after seeing Saving Mr. Banks.
I:8747;3308;This is a great family movie to be watched over and over again.
I:8747;3309;The 50th anniversary high def edition was extremely timely, considering 2014 is the 50th anniversary.
I:8747;3310;united with them through all the strange and wonderful things that occur when the perfect nanny with magical powers literally blows into their house with the east wind.
I:8747;3311;When the movie deviates greatly from the book it is based on, I haved liked the books far more than the movie.
I:8747;3312;Julie Andrews is terrific, the setting of Edwardian London great, the songs are fabulous, and this is a movie to be treasured and seen over and over again down the years.
I:8747;3313;Excellent packaging and full length movie.
I:8747;3314;This was a Christmas present to my granddaughters and they will enjoy it for many years.
I:8747;3315;A classic that deserves to be saved and watched for generations.
I:8747;3316;It is well worth it.
I:8747;3317;this is a reminder of how creative and charming film has been and still could be.
I:8747;3318;lots of fun to watch with the kids and still today, even the adults.
I:8747;3319;A wonderful reminder of the true classic this movie is and always will be.
I:8747;3320;Love it when I was a kid and my kid loved it too!
I:8747;3321;In this digital format, I saw the colors more true to life than when I watched this as a kid!
I:8747;3322;Sounds great in surround sound too!
I:8747;3323;I was very well pleased with the whole process .
I:8747;3324;from finding the item and finding the right one that I felt was the one that I knew my wife wanted.
I:8747;3325;Then being able to order the item, using some of the gift certificates I had in my account.
I:8747;3326;my concern was the timing of the delivery but it came without any delays and I was able to track it's process so I knew where it was at everyday.
I:8747;3327;although I saw this many years ago when I was younger it is still a great movie and a real classic one all can enjoy for a long time to come
I:8747;3328;I really enjoy having the Digital copy to accompany the new Disney Anywhere App that now allows me to upload any of their movies and have it ready to play on any of my devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac).
I:8747;3329;There are lots of cheery tunes.
I:8747;3330;I'm happy with my choice.
I:8747;3331;And in the end, Mr. Banks goes right back to what was causing him so much distress.
I:8747;3332;Disney's crowning achievement is finally going to be available in Hi.
I:8747;3333;I must say Disney is slow to release their catalog in Blu except for their animation but this is so exciting!
I:8747;3334;I have loved MP for 40 years and now can see it the say it was meant to be seen!
I:8747;3335;My four year old enjoyed this classic except for a couple of parts (No spoilers here!)
I:8747;3336;"
I:8747;3337;This was so fun to watch again.
I:8747;3338;Loved getting to see this beloved classic in this way!
I:8747;3339;i saw it as a little girl and the anniversary addition has lots extra!
I:8747;3340;and the songs bring back lots of great memories!
I:8747;3341;Great singing, acting, and a great story.
I:8747;3342;I can watch this once or a hundred times and still enjoy the movie.
I:8747;3343;one of the best kids / family movies of all time.
I:8747;3344;Full of imagination and music.
I:8747;3345;The kids will love it!
I:8747;3346;This is a great one, especially if you have let your child see Saving Mr. Banks .
I:8747;3347;I got the 40th Anniversary edition, and it's great!
I:8747;3348;She's everything the kids want, fun and magical.
I:8747;3349;Still this movie is more about fun then anything else.
I:8747;3350;And it has that in spades.
I:8747;3351;Many of the special effects hold up remarkably well today.
I:8747;3352;Any fan of Disney knows these songs by heart.
I:8747;3353;Disc one features the movie in all its wide screen glory.
I:8747;3354;Sprinkled in are archive comments from others, including Disney himself.
I:8747;3355;one thing that comes through loud and clear in this set is how much fun everyone had making it and how much they respect Walt Disney.
I:8747;3356;The fact that this film has lasted 40 years is testament to his genius.
I:8747;3357;With this set, it'll be enjoyed by generations to come.
I:8747;3358;maw brought the gift that Santa didn't have in his bag of goodies.
I:8747;3359;A classic movie for children of all ages from 3.103.
I:8747;3360;I thought I should finally see this movie because I tend to like musicals.
I:8747;3361;One of the 100 best movies ever made!
I:8747;3362;from the music to the lyrics to the script, set and art decoration, the miracle of technically melding live action with animation, to the heaven.
I:8747;3363;inspired casting and magical costume design .
I:8747;3364;it's worth seeing again and again and again and again!
I:8747;3365;and Mary Poppins , to it's great credit, is magical.
I:8747;3366;I was pleasantly surprised to find that she found the film to be very entertaining, from the goofy songs to the crazy characters to the wacky animation.
I:8747;3367;"music: Of course, a musical film is ultimately judged by the success of its musical numbers, and in that case ""Mary Poppins"" is a rousing success!"
I:8747;3368;I personally love the chimney.
I:8747;3369;"sweep's ""Step In Time"" upbeat dance, while my younger sister's favorite was, as she would said, ""the one with the dancing penguins!"""
I:8747;3370;"overall, ""Mary Poppins"" is a movie that can be enjoyed by any and all ages from now until the end of time."
I:8747;3371;After seeing the tragic movie that is Saving Mr. Banks, I wanted to reminisce by purchasing this delightful story.
I:8747;3372;Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, and David Tomlinson play incredibly memorable roles in this heartwarming masterpiece!
I:8747;3373;This is one of my family's favorite movies of all time and the 50th Anniversary Edition does this film justice.
