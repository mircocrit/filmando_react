1;I really liked this movie.
2;Sidney Poitier is at his best.
3;Great plot and a surprise who done it!
4;Almost forty years has passed and this is still one of the very, very few American movies worth watching.
5;the movie still has the power to shock and captivate.
6;It's the small details that are so well done, and the shots held long past the point any modern director or editor would dare in our contemporary world of jump.
7;Aside from this quirk, it's a great watch.
8;If Hollywood could make movies like this on a regular basis then American films would actually be worth watching.
9;So if you love movies, take the time to watch this instead.
10;I've loved this film forever.
11;I don't know if it's one of the top 10 movies ever made, but it's one of my top 10 favs to view.
12;It DID win the Best Picture Oscar for 1967, as well as Best Actor for Steiger (both well.
13;It's a bit softer and warmer of a picture, but plenty sharp enough.
14;all things considered, an excellent job was done remastering this for blu.
15;this is a great movie.

17;The gift came with plenty of time to spare (last minute Christmas idea).
18;This movie broke down so many barriers with an amazing story and cast.
19;Poitier and Steiger are amazing as the tension builds between their two characters.
20;this movie tells a piece of the story of American racism in the mid.20th century and is an Essential , both because it's riveting but it's important history.
21;Winner of best picture for 1967, In The Heat of The Night may have just been another crime thriller or murder mystery, but the profound and topical especially at the time> subject matter elevated by the artists attached make the movie a must see for any serious film student or student of sociology for that matter.
22;He hails from Philadelphia where he's the department's top.
23;What follows is a murder mystery full of twists, driven by realistically drawn and realized characters all embroiled in small town conventions and taboos as they deal with the disruption of outsiders intensified by the heated racial tensions which were inescapable during the late 1960's America.
24;In The Heat of The Night may not have been the first major film to deal with race relations, nor is it certainly the last, but it's hard to name one that does it so skillfully and entertainingly.
25;It's a film which always keeps the audience guessing and thinking.

29;The screenplay by Stirling Silliphant captures the flavor of the time and place wonderfully never skirting away from language, which while tame by today's standards was mature, even raw for 1967.
30;in The Heat Of The Night remains a groundbreaking film, but is always accessible and adheres to the cardinal rule of good film making: it's great entertainment.
31;While today's crime stories and murder mysteries contain multiple car chases and set pieces for maximum shock value, In The Heat of The Night quietly and powerfully still stands up and remains still relevant.
32;stands as one of cinema's most memorable and passionately delivered lines, but the power emanating from that strongly stated retort stems not just from a disrespected character's indignation over racial bigotry, but also from the nerve those words struck in people all across the country and how they reflected monumental social changes.
33;thankfully, we've come a long way since 1967, so the visceral impact of 'In the Heat of the Night' has significantly diminished over time.

47;Background elements vary from fuzzy to clear, but close.
48;ups are razor sharp, allowing us to see the glistening sweat, hair follicles, and skin blemishes on the characters' faces.
49;Though this is far from the finest catalogue transfer I've seen, 'In the Heat of the Night' looks better than it ever has on home video, and that should please both fans and new Blu.

70;theatrical Trailer [2:48] The film's exciting original preview is well paced and chock full of potent snippets that pique interest but don't give too much away.
71;Though changing times and social advancements have dulled some of the movie's sting, 'In the Heat of the Night' tells it like it was in the Deep South in the 1960s and stands as a potent reminder of where we were and how far we've progressed.
72;When I saw this film for the first time and I heard Ray Charles singing the theme song I was flooded with good memories.
73;now I have to say, this film is very good, albeit somewhat dated and a tad stuffy, and yet it manages to make a statement and feel relevant while being only a token version of relevance.
74;It has all the elements for a great film, from a riveting storyline, great acting and interesting characters.
75;Despite the age and the complete feeling of being `removed', it still manages to be a respectable film and one that we should admire.
76;After revealing his identity his services are offered since he works homicide and may be able to help solve the murder.
77;This is far more than just a movie about murder, it's a movie about acceptance and change and how one town, brought up with one way of thinking can change that way when they realize their faults.
78;It's great to see how Virgil goes from the outcast to the respected partner.
79;sidney and Rod are great together here, as is Lee Grant as the widow, who in her two short scenes shows enough feeling and emotion to earn her a Golden Globe nod.
80;I don't think it should have won the Oscar, especially not up against `The Graduate' (but 1967 was arguably one of the finest years for film) but it is a worthy winner and one that we can't fault too much, especially when you calculate in the time it was made and released.
81;While it may not hold up entirely with today's audience, in 1967 this was a film that made a difference and had a very loud and necessary voice.
82;I loved it then, love it now!
83;I remember seeing this movie at the theater when it came out, and I just had to have it.
84;It's a slice of the 1960's that is very important to preserve.
85;IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is Sidney Poitier's favorite of all the movies he's appeared in, and with good reason.
86;directed drama is one terrific picture.
87;It won five Oscars: Best Actor (Rod Steiger), Picture, Editing, Sound and Screenplay.
88;Nearly half a century after its initial release, Norman Jewison's film still packs a wallop.
89;This is filmmaking at its best.
90;Relevant social commentary, exciting story line, superb acting right down to the smallest role and made by craftsmen at the top of their game.
91;Stirling Silliphant, so familiar to television fans as the writer of countless The Naked City and Route 66 episodes has fashioned an extraordinary Academy Award winning screenplay.
92;Rod Steiger thoroughly deserved the Best Actor Oscar (probably should have also won two years earlier for The Pawnbroker ] but everyone in this movie is first rate.
93;Great music score by Quincy Jones and stunning photography by Haskell Wexler.
94;On this disc there are some interesting extras including commentary by Jewison, Steiger, Lee Grant and Wexler plus excellent featurettes which explore African.
95;If anyone is interested in exploring this film further, along with the other four Best Picture nominees of 1967, I heartily recommend the superb book PICTURES AT A REVOLUTION by Mark Harris.
96;One of the best film books I have ever read!
97;You will enjoy this movie time after time.
98;Always loved this movie and seeing it again just reminds me so much about why I like Sidney Poitier as an actor.
99;Great story, I enjoy how it shows that even those that are raised and marinated in prejudice can see the woods for the trees.
100;put up with the slight blinking for a few minutes since this is again a great movie and story with very good acting.
101;This is a great movie and more people should go back and watch it.
102;Very good classic movie to add to your personal library.
103;Mr. Poitier is an excellent actor, and I have many of his movies in my own library.
104;what a bunch of great characters.
105;Certainly, there is a huge amount of differences between the two.
106;I'll say that, I really liked the movie a lot.
107;Sidney Poitier has a terrific on.
108;screen presence and makes for a very commanding demeanor.
109;is very gripping and shocking.
110;The idea of a black man with intelligence offending every white person in the town of Sparta, Mississippi is a sight to behold.
111;And leaves him crying is hilarious.
112;Better make sure that you call him """"Missterrr Tibbsss."""""""
113;The way he works around the corpse is just brilliant.
114;It's like he commands respect from that moment.
115;Sidney Poitier won the best performance of the year for me in that scene just like how Denzel Washington did in Glory.
116;Although Rod Steiger was the winner, Sidney Poitier was the superior actor and practically stole the movie from start to finish.
117;Now, that's a role model for many African Americans.
118;All in all, In the Heat of the Night is a can't miss best picture winner, and it's worth watching for every second of it.
119;"A good detective story is worth seeing at least twice
120;This is a good story for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is Sidney Poitier, but I've just watched it for the third time, and I still don't spot clues that should have told me.
121;handed, and the murderer was clearly right.
122;I will give it another chance.
123;He will always be one of my favorite actors.
124;This particular movie offers the added gift of bringing prejudices into the light and exposing them for the foolishness they are.
125;It is also a great movie!
126;the tv series was amazing.
127;the movie won 5 Academy awards for Best Picture in 1967.
128;being a Southern man,I can relate to the movie and esp.
129;the underlying emotion of the truth really affected me .
130;The actors played a very good parkA great movie simply great a must see !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
131;This is simply one of the finest movies ever made and Sidney Potier is as graceful and forceful as ever.
132;His police force is the same, and they all struggle with the fact that Tibbs is smarter than all of them combigned.
133;This is why the film works in 2009.
134;There are certainly many outstanding dual performances to choose from and unquestionably one of the best can be found in the '67 film `In the Heat of the Night'.
135;`In the Heat of the Night' is a superior murder mystery in its own right, but it's the visual posturing and verbal banter between Tibbs and Gillespie that elevates this film to the level of classic.
136;Watching their relationship slowly evolve from hated adversaries to a place of mutual respect and admiration is a cinematic event capturing two of the best performances you'll ever see.
137;serious grappling with social and political themes, serious drama, serious character development, all with a whodunit thrown in for good measure.
138;The Rod Steiger character is so well thought out, a beautiful complex character study of a good man caught between his culture, his own intelligence and judgment and a transforming situation.
139;One of the great films of the 1960s, """"In the Heat of the Night"""" hasn't dated one bit in the 38 years since its release."""
140;It now deserves to be recognized as one of the great films of all time.
141;the first rate direction of Norman Jewison and Haskell Wexler's brilliant cinematography make you feel the humidity in the Mississippi town in which black detective Virgil Tibbs and redneck sheriff Bill Gillespie form an unusual and often antagonistic alliance to solve the murder of an important industrialist.
142;"as the sheriff, Rod Steiger is perfect in the role for which he won the Oscar he had earned but was denied two years earlier for ""The Pawnbroker."""
143;"Sidney Poitier was at the height of his popularity in 1967 with three blockbusters in release (""To Sir, With Love"" and ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"" were the others) but in Virgil Tibbs he found his best role and gives his finest performance."
144;"He has many memorable moments throughout, most notably his famous admonition to Steiger that became the title of the less impressive 1970 spin off: ""They call me MISTER Tibbs!"
145;home, and is all the more powerful for its subtlety.
146;the supporting cast is as perfect as the stars with veterans Lee Grant, Warren Oates, and Beah Richards all providing memorable moments without overshadowing the equally fine work of newcomers Scott Wilson, Quentin Dean, and Anthony James.
147;The score by Quincy Jones, featuring Ray Charles' rendition of the title song, captures the proper mood throughout.
148;in a year when the odds.
149;"makers were predicting an Oscar victory for either ""Bonnie and Clyde"" or ""The Graduate,"" this beautifully atmospheric thriller with depth was the surprise victor, taking the Oscar for Best Picture, as well as four other awards (Steiger, Stirling Silliphant's screenplay, Hal Ashby's editing, and sound)."
150;The Academy made the right choice.
151;In the Heat of the Night may have been timely then, but thanks to the artistry of all involved, it remains timeless.
152;But at least one entry into the genre made a major impact during those years, and that was 1967's In the Heat of the Night.
153;Since it was released, much has been made of the movie's status as a powerful story of race relations during the time of segregation, but the fact is, these elements are somewhat secondary to its brilliant character studies and expertly.
154;This is THE detective film, and quite possibly THE police film as well.
155;And from there, we have our movie.
156;besides the story, the main thing In the Heat of the Night has going for it are the performances of its lead actors.
157;natured gentleman in many of his other films).
158;if Poitier's portrayal of Tibbs as a realistic human being rather than a flawless screen hero is admirable, then Rod Steiger's handling of the Sheriff Gillespie character is downright masterful.
159;"This is no Bull Connor character
160;In the Heat of the Night won Best Picture at the 1968 Academy Awards (the first detective film to do so), and Steiger took home the Best Actor award for his career.
161;That perfectly sums up this film's legacy: a brilliant film with two powerful lead performances, and an all.
162;time classic of the detective genre.
163;I lost track of how many times I've watched this movie over the years and yet, I still find it stimulating to my system.
164;Taking place in the redneck driven byways in the Mississippi of the 1960's, not only does it make a sweeping social statement on racial bias and ignorance, but it's also one entertaining vision of cinema.
165;One of my all time favorites.
166;Watching this movie helped me understand the series.
167;it was very well done.
168;Highly recommend the movie to all that watch the series.
169;I love the series on tv, but never saw the movie.
170;It will be great in my collection!
171;This was a great movie.
172;paced movie allows for some reflection into their complexities.
173;IHN shows a slice of Americana that we would still hope we can resolve.
174;Watching this movie on widescreen and w/o commercials restores the original sense of time and place.
175;Like To Kill a Mockingbird, IHN allows for worthwhile teaching moments for young adults.
176;He plays his character with perfection.
177;This is a classic film from the 60s, where the concern for the social issues (racism, but also feminist ones) are not too far behind where American society had already been heading.
178;Great acting from the entire cast, with everyone remembering Rod Steiger as the small town sheriff.
179;When they speak you can see their breath.
180;the overall effect of the use of location is a bit jarring.
181;On the one hand, the film makes great use of locations in and around Sparta, Illinois.
182;And the biggest revelation is that it's the white sheriff who is the 'fish out of water'.
183;For one thing, most of the town people resent him.
184;The story might actually have benefited from having a director from the South.
185;still, overall great cinematography and an intriguing mystery story make this a worthwhile classic to watch repeatedly.
186;But I know people, and I know how they can be.
187;how Mr. Tibbs manages to keep himself from going berserk during each encounter he experienced in this film is beyond me.
188;the acting is obviously superb.
189;And I was shocked to see other reviews here say that this film is dated !
190;This film beautifully captures the colors and sounds (and heat) of this town.
191;The music score (by Quincy Jones) is great (be sure to check out his score, as well as another brilliant Rod Steiger performance, in the 1965 classic The Pawnbroker .
192;anyone who thinks this film is dated should keep in mind the real purpose of this film (and most art in general).
193;It is to capture a place and time as it was.
194;This film does it in a brutally honest yet artistic way.
195;This edition of the 1967 classic is so far the definitive edition.
196;The featurettes are very informative and entertaining.
197;if you are searching for a very memorable film about one of the core points of humanity, with a satisfying climax and a plot that will leave you thinking, then watch """"In the Heat of the Night""""."""
198;If you are looking for good featurettes and interesting commentary, then this version is the one you need.
199;It was good to watch it again.
200;Well, the time the picture depicts was just passing in 1967 and the audience could feel comfortable about feeling superior to all those southern racists with their incestuous cracker sensibilities.
201;Still, this is a powerful drama and so well acted.
202;There is the racism, the sexuality, the lies and hidden truths, the hypocrisies of small town life.
203;It is filmed so that you feel the summer heat and darkness that hides so much.
204;As you experience the film it has more the feel of a poem than a documentary.
205;They are both decent and intelligent people who are much more sensitive than their exterior personalities will allow.
206;There is a scene where they both explore behind this shell until Tibbs rebuffs the Chief's question about his experience of being lonely and the Chief instantly returns to his tough and bitter shell.
207;This allows him to like him and for Tibbs and Gillespie to part with a friendship at the end of the movie.
208;They are all classics and worth seeing.
209;This movie was a creature of its time and affected its audiences powerfully.
210;In the Heat of the Night was always one of my favorite movies.
211;but because Norman Jewison is one of the very few Hollywood directors that can make an utterly serious movie (or for that matter a comic one) fun to watch.

215;Now I have to say, this film is damn near perfect.
216;It has all the elements for a great film, from a riviting storyline, great acting and interesting charactors.
217;After revieling his identity his services are offered since he works homicide and may be able to help solve the murder.

222;It is also a fascinating character study of those two men.
223;All of this rolled into one film makes In the Heat of the Night a true classic.
224;I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film.
225;The ending is very satisfying, especially the final scene when Chief Gillespie finally sees Virgil Tibbs as a man instead of as a black man.
226;One of the best ever made"

238;It is truly great and deserving of all the awards it received.
239;Love this actor and always enjoyed the series.

260;It's because of his performance and {the rest of the cast's acting}, that makes up of most of In the heat of the night's entertainment.
261;Sidney Poitier does an excellent performance.
262;"Virgil was a homicide detective in Philadelphia
263;I enjoyed reading this book, because it's a well written story about racism in U. s. a. I didn't like the way the chief treated Virgil, because he was so racist about Virgil being a black person and the murdered is white rich business man.
264;Classic movie loved every minute of it.
265;Very nice to have access whenever I want.
266;This is a very good movie.
267;I recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning what it was like in the South for the black people as far as being seen as intelligent people who would solve a murder.
268;Very intense moments for Sidney Poitier trying to investigate a murder.
269;One of the decade's best Oscar winning films (but lamentably, not for its true star, Sidney Poitier).
270;It is a marvelous study in race relations, driven by two of the best performances ever by Sidney Poitier (portraying a Philadelphia homicide detective called a """"powerful piece of po."""
271;"It is fascinating to see Poitier, one of the only African American stars of the time play a role here in such contrast to his roles as a most polite, non threatening Negro in ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and ""To Sir, With Love""."
272;"When asked if he will be the cause of any trouble, his response ""no trouble at all"" is delivered with quiet but chilling self."

276;"great quotable movie line, exclaimed by Rod Steiger: ""I got the motive which is money and the body which is dead!"""
277;Its great right down to the title song, sung with more soul than can be contained in any one man .
278;a movie to be seen time and time again, and certainly one for the library.
279;In an arresting performance as Mr. Tibbs in what was certainlya shocking, powerful, entertaining movie upon its release, SidneyPoitier's performance is not dated at all.
280;This is still an excellent film, and Poitieris outstanding.
281;I don't understand how this film won the Oscar for best picture.
282;"Sidney Poiter holds himself with such dignity and professionalism, that the characters around him are COMMANDED to give him respect
283;The story is compelling, A murder has taken place, and its this big city slicker, who happens to be BLACK"
284;It spun off a wonderful T. v. series as well, so if you like this movie, you'll like the TV show of the same name.
285;the T. v. show carries over the same tone as the movie and is well written and acted.
286;With an interesting conflict between two policemen, one white and one black, In the Heat of the Night is a thrilling crime film.
287;Rod Steiger delivers a wonderful performance as the common place and prejudiced officer who heads a southern police force.
288;found respect tells him to come back sometime.
289;In an age where racism was still a tremendous problem, this film combated the issue and created something very special in the process.
290;this is surely one of the most important movies of the 1960's.
291;The colors are lively and rich.
292;I'm very happy with the final result.
293;"This film clearly inspired the kind of distinctive 70's era police detective films to come such as ""Shaft"" and ""Dirty Harry"" and even the great score by Quincy Jones evokes memories of the similar sounding ones connected with those two films."
294;As a detective mystery, this film does a very good job in addition to being a social statement for viewers in the late 60's.
295;"one interesting scene was when Steiger's character invites Poitier to his home and starts out on a heart to heart with him showing how natural and possible a friendship based upon equal and mutual respect between races can be but then he catches himself when he realises that he had forgotten to keep him in his ""place"" and so abruptly ends a promising friendship bonding between equals to return to the ""status quo"" of discrimination."
296;This is still a good police detective story and a good social statement on the absurdity of racism making it a worthy Best Picture Oscar winner.
297;Ray Charles is also very good in his rendition of the main theme song.
298;This movie is a classic and one that truly eans the title.
299;Top Notch acting, fine mellow.
300;drama and a mystery that still works today.
301;"This is the movie where the classic line of ""They call me Mr. Tibbs"" is uttered and it is still as powerful today as iut must have been upon its theatrical release."
302;Rod Steiger delivers a strong performance as well and the ending scenes (especially the one at his home) really cause you to think about who his character is in relation to his surroundings.
303;get your popcorn and drink, sit back, unhook the phone, and savor this tremendous film.
304;and not to worry, you'll feel real good when it's over.
305;if you loved the series heat of the night you will love the movie that started it all awsome movie an oldie but a goodie AAAAA+++++
306;great movie for all to watch.
307;I will enjoy watching it over and over again.
308;really everyone should see this movie.
309;That is what makes this film so great.
310;Norman Jewison is a brilliant director.
311;He first and foremost knows how to tackle a story thematically and at the same time entertain you.
312;He is a master storyteller where every element of a film is somehow integrated into an all encompassing single tale touching all our senses in the process.
313;He is Mister Tibbs, the inimitable Mister Tibbs.
314;In the Heat of the Night is one of the finest, most sensitive and realistic motion pictures of the last century.
315;"It is a total ensemble success, each individual ""star"" a standout!"
316;Special commendations to the writers, director, all the assistants, and of course, to the great stars who made this so moving!
317;This is a Poitier classic.
318;Both stars do a wonderful job.
319;It is also a great slice of time for later generations.
320;I've added it to my library!
321;norman Jewison directed this compelling and intriguing plot around a homicide and a black detective who will undertake a careful analysis around this dark murder.
322;My husband now wants more we did enjoy the movie.
323;the best timing I take my hat off too u all Thanks so much for a nice movie
324;A great movie and a must add to your collection if you like Sidney Poitier.
325;Fine performances and good content.
326;We starting watching reruns of the TV series and wanted to see the original.
327;This film perfectly mirrors the social attitudes of the 60's on the cusp of where racism .
328;Two very fine actors (Steiger and Poitier)play the major antagonists with brilliant support from Warren Oates and Lee Grant.
329;"Loved ""In The Heat Of The Night"" when I saw it on its first cinematic release ."
330;see other layers viewing it again now and I consider it a real classic.
331;Great movie!Paints a real picture of those times.
332;There was a lot of suspense here and it kept me guessing all the way to the end.
333;It is not only a very good cop's film but also a fight between two great performances and only for that deserves to be watched.
334;But more fundamentally, it is film that demonstrates the value, the dignity and the efficacy, not of a member of a particular race, but of the individual human being.
335;This film, in the framework of a detective story, celebrates the value of the individual human being.
336;"there are many reasons to love this movie
337;i believe the best performance in the movie was made by Rod Steiger, whose light is outshone by a screen icon.
338;this movie is well worth your time.
339;A great movie that won Oscar for best picture of 1967.
340;Two outstanding performances by Sidney Poitier as Virgil Tibbs and Rod Steiger as Chief Gillespie.
341;What makes this an outstanding movie is the two plots going on at once that constantly intertwine.
342;First you have a good murder mystery going on of the towns richest man.
343;Norman Jewison does a brilliant job of direction.
344;It's a pleasure to say that the film has not suffered from its timeliness when it was released or from its """"classic"""" status: today it plays beautifully, with tension and excitement and terrific performances."""
345;story, and seems to be there mostly for the townspeople to react against: but Poitier is such a fine actor he genuinely brings out the best in the other performers, as well as getting his famous moments of resistance against white racism (including his famous slapping of Larry Gates and his scathing riposte to Steiger, when asked what they call him in Philadelphia).
346;Poitier gets wonderful actors' rhythms going, first with Scott Wilson as a murder suspect and then with Beah Richards as an abortionist, in two surprisingly quiet sequences that are among the finest in the movie.
347;But it's still an extraordinary work.
348;Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger were amazing.
349;(7) Many memorable lines by Poitier and Steiger that have become part of film history including They call me, Mister Tibbs!
350;, Beah Richards (always wonderful), Quentin Dean ( Delores , seen nicely through a window with strategically placed mullions!)
351;Scott is best known today for his charismatic role as Hershel Greene in The Walking Dead !
352;It provides the best viewing of In the Heat of the Night yet!
353;It is also the best wide screen version I have ever seen including the original screenings in Atlanta in 1967.
354;"There is always something about a film that any person finds appealing
355;rod Steigers performance was quite remarkable, and commands the observant viewers respect and admiration.
356;His strength in this film is his restraint in situations where anyone else would have little tolerance.
357;two thumbs up for a daring story line, and command performances from some of Hollywood's great actors.
358;when the Academy gives out awards for best picture, they have their reasons.
359;Often Academy Awards Best Pictures are simply a flash in the pan.
360;This was a significant film the 1967 and is still a racially charged film today.
361;This film is a must for any film buff's library.
362;He came to visit his mother and is going back on the 4:05 to Memphis.
363;Great classical movie that documents the racial tension in the south.
364;Sidney Poitier remains my favorite actor of that time.
365;please send a new one.
366;I enjoyed this film and its fine cast.
367;Best picture Oscar for 1967, with Steiger also winning for best actor.
368;caution: the movie is based on a novel.
369;Lots of additional material on disc.
370;At the movie's end, Gillespie hasn't changed his views about blacks, but he has come to respect Tibbs as a lawman and as a human being"
371;The acting, the directing, and above all, Quincy Jones's magnificent score, made this one of the best movies of the 1960's and for years beyond.
372;running TV show, and won that year's Best Picture Oscar.
373;winner Rod Steiger), who, after learning Tibbs' credentials and calling his chief, must grudgingly accept Tibbs' help in solving the murder.
374;"steiger's performance as the dedicated chief is brilliant (""I am familiar with the laws in the state of Mississippi, thank YOU!)"
375;Endicott is Sparta's most influential businessman who'd least appreciate an influx of Afro.
376;as good as it gets.
377;it really shows how the south was and STILL is ( in many ways) , but great story line and plot, as well as the actors !!!
378;we got this for our friend next door, he loves this movie cause this is where the TV show came from ( same title) !!!!!
379;What a great old film!
380;Everybody should watch this movie.
381;Especially great on a hot summer night.
382;but any time is good for this classic.
383;Great writing, acting, music, photography, etc. very deserving of all its awards.
384;Intense action drama boasts a tight script and a pair of explosive lead performances by Poitier and Steiger.
385;Heat netted Oscars in most top categories that year.
386;And though Steiger won the award, its just as much Poitier's movie.
387;Steiger won an Oscar as the prejudiced lawman who begins to question his own motives after being outclassed by Poitier during a difficult murder investigation.
388;Warren Oates and Lee Grant also merit notice in equally strong supporting roles.
389;I would rate this 6 stars or higher if possible.
390;A great story, great directing and sensational performances by Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier.
391;It's a movie that gets better with each viewing.
392;"Has to be the best line in the movie one of the best ever lines right up there with ""Go ahead punk make my day"", and ""We dont need no stiken badges""."
393;This is a very realistic protral of the 60's south.
394;I rember it well when everyone was proud about their fathers rank in the KKK.
395;A true classic that will never grow old and has an accurate feel of the time.
396;Good clean movie with the always reliable Sidney Poitier.
397;The plot was excellent as well as everything else in the movie.
398;This is such a classic movie and can't be seen on streaming thru Netflix.
399;This anniversary edition has a great bonus background addition.
400;Excellent acting, excellent social commentary.
401;This movie brought that home in a real way and helped to open the eyes of our students .
402;Great perspective on racial issues and the attitudes of the time.
403;sidney Poitier absolutely shines as Mr. Tibbs, the top rated homocide detective in Philadelphia who ends up in Sparta, Mississippi one dark, lonely night.
404;He's hauled in and nearly strung up before he's able to show them that he's a fellow police officer.
405;When he asks about a motel that will take him, he's laughed at.
406;He laughs when being told that he should be horse.
407;He takes it in stride.
408;but I have to hope with all my heart that we have moved beyond this truly atrocious level.
409;It makes me want to renew my effort to ensure that prejudice is removed from our world, and that every person is treated with respect, compassion, and honor.
410;This should have been on the first AFI list and is absolutely a must.
411;Just as good as I remember it.
412;One of Sidney Poitier's best movies and what a great pairing with Rod Stieger.
413;One of the best movies made.
414;I would recommend it to all my friends and family members
415;Scott Wilson is notable here in an early role (more well known now for playing Scott Crossfield in The Right Stuff many years later).
416;I recently saw the movie after seeing it probably 30 years ago and it held up very well.
417;It's a true classic from a by.
418;This movie holds up over time!
419;Even harder to believe is that the same film holds as much relevance today as when it was originally released, that it holds the same impact.
420;While the story may seem simple on the surface, it is all that lies under the surface that makes this movie exceptional.
421;Each new suspect they bring in, Tibbs clears with the evidence that proves them innocent.
422;Can they find the real killer?The winner of five Academy Awards (Steiger for acting, best editing, best screenplay, best sound and best picture as well as nominations for director and sound effects) IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT defied the expectations of the studio that produced it, becoming a movie that the public and critics both loved.
423;One watching makes it easy to see why as this tale unfolds beneath the mastery of direction and acting involved.
424;Steiger and Poitier were at their best with this film.
425;Others, personal ones, are deeply hidden .
426;In their parting words, Gillespie offers friendship and Tibbs, cautiously, accepts.
427;The point is that two human beings, whose interplay dominated the film, have found common ground.
428;was a gift, my daughter loved it
429;This movie is marvelously entertaining.
430;It delivers on all levels.
431;plot, action, performances of the actors and most importantly, the complexity of a region that has fascinated America for years.
432;This movie captures these characters with an expertise matched by very few films.
433;It is a great movie to own, since it will get watched instead of just collecting dust.
434;"A good indication of how ""timeless"" this film is
435;An aspect of film that I've always found interesting is the attention to detail the Director adds to the screen.
436;every minute is spellbinding, and you do not want to miss one scene.
437;Actors are all perfect in their roles.
438;it's appropriate for the classroom.
439;Great mystery with a few turns that keep you guessing.
440;This is one of the best movies ever made.
441;Some of the best acting by Rod Steiger ever.
442;Really puts things in perspective as far as now and back then.
443;Other supporting actors in this are excellent.
444;But this movie is a masterpiece both in directing and in acting as well as the screenplay.
445;It is one of my all time favorite movies, I never tire of watching it.
446;This is one of those movies I tune into anytime I see it on TV.
447;Super fast shipping, and a great price.
448;I highly recommend this movie.
449;Sydney Potier and Rod Steiger were great together.
450;Poitier and Steiger are terrific in this film about a murder case and raciam in the south.
451;A brilliant book and the movie was almost as good.
452;Highlights the racial tensions in the American deep South in a most realistic way.
453;Good murder mystery as well.
454;Sydney Poitier competent as always but Rod Steiger steals the movie.
455;well directed, fast moving and memorable.
456;This is a great movie, a classic for the ages.
457;It has a wonderful story, black and white relations in the South, a murder, several suspects: with 2 fantastic actors playing off each other.
458;This is one great film.
459;From the casting to the plot to the cinematography to the timing, we loved it.
460;This is a classic movie that my husband mentioned off.
461;The rich family owns the town, the whites kowtow to them and the blacks are down on the next level.
462;Tibbs and Gillespie are two great characters and they are brought to life by two amazing performances.
463;In the Heat of the Night is a classic film coming to Blu.
464;Back in 1967, this movie won best picture and with good reason.
465;in the Heat of the Night is a thrilling crime chase where anyone can be the killer and everyone is a suspect.
466;But in addition to the thrills and chills, this movie also represents an important stand against bigotry in a time when it didn't often happen in film.
467;This classic movie is one that should be in everyone's library.
468;Even thirty years later, this film's message still resonates due to their performances"
469;But Tibbs is a man of conviction.
470;Both the central performances of Poitier and Steiger, and the unlikely bond and ultimate friendship that ensue, are electrifying reasons to revisit this powerful drama of the 1960s.
471;I've heard so much about this film over the years and of course I'm from the generation who's more familiar with the television show.
472;For the year that this film was made.yes, the writer and director took a lot of risks.
473;but I have to tell you, I was more than under impressed with the mystery portion of the movie and I had to re.
474;Like I said the mystery has holes, but the individual characters were multilayered and fascinating to watch.
475;Another example of how great acting can save a movie.
476;THANK THANK UUUUUUUUUU wonderful movie hubby loved it and i do too, postive rates and came on time I was soo happy
477;One of the best movies ever made.
478;It's just as great today as it was 40 years ago.
479;Steiger ad Poitier are brilliant.
480;The many scenes with just the two of them are terrific.
481;I love the expression on their face when they learn that he is not only a policeman but the Head Detective of Homicide and they need his help to solve their crime.
482;The Bottom Line:Though the film's atmosphere and performances succeed to a greater degree than the mystery story at its core, In The Heat of the Night is still an engaging and interesting film with fascinating character interaction and a true feel for the South.
483;"From Quincy Jones' score to Haskell Wexler's cinematography ""In the Heat of the Night"" is worthy of inclusion on anyone's top ten films list."
484;but as ground breaking as the film was on the subject of 1967 race relations, the most amazing thing is how well it has held up almost 40 years later.
485;He has just told her that her husband has been murdered and she recoils from his first two attempts to comfort her.
486;When an important rich white man is murdered,Poitier is picked up at the train station because he is black and nota known resident.
487;What ensues is suspenseful, funny at times, and hasmany twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing.
488;Great movie it depicts how a man of color was not respected because of his race but remains professional and knowledgable.
489;Others have written of the outstanding production this was as well as the superb acting.
490;and you have a great 110 minutes of a classic film.
491;Both Mr. Poitier and Mr. Steiger are brilliant in the film.
492;Although they do sometimes plays things over the top, the acting fits the mood.
493;The actors make a fine team and they push one another to excellence.
494;The supporting cast is quite strong with Lee Grant, Warren Oates and William Schallert and Norman Jewison guides the movie with his deft hand.
495;Haskell Wexler's cinematography is sharp and Quincy Jones' soundtrack is right on.
496;The film went on to win the Best Picture Oscar and Mr. Steiger took home the Best Actor prize.
497;This movie is in my top ten.
498;Both men are superb as they play off each other in this intriguing social commentary.
499;the Heat is a scorcher!
500;In the Heat of the Night won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1967.
501;"I was a Freshman in college that year, and all the talk was about ""Bonnie and Clyde"", a great film."
502;Guess Who's Coming to Dinner was, at the time, considered ostentatious (a rich Black man marrying the daughter of a rich White couple.

504;making, as well as good suspense and fine acting and direction.
505;This is good, because Steiger starts from scratch, builds a compelling character, shows a bit of lack.
506;"The great old gospel singer, Jester Hairston, also had a small role
507;Sterling Silliphant's screenplay won the Oscar hands.
508;down, a riveting narrative of a complicated book.
509;The greatest thing about Steiger's performance is that you know nothing about him or his background when the film begins, or even when it's over.
510;It's quite profound when he doesn't get the answer he wants.
511;There's also the great Beah Richards, in a small cameo, as Mama Kaleba"
512;broken mother, a fine performance.
513;Yes, 1967 was a great year.
514;"a great year, but I still think ""In the Heat of the Night"" is the film I prefer to watch."
515;Great exploration of the ways things were in the 1960's Southern United States.
516;One of the best performances that can be found from both Rod Stieger and Sidney Poitier.
517;role smoothe and comparatively minimal.
518;One of the best movies made in the sixties!
519;Sidney Poitier/Rod Steiger in what was amongst both actor's finest hours.

521;"One of my most memorable childhood movie moments was that of Mr. Poitier's character Virgil Tibbs being slapped by a powerful southern white man for stepping out of line,"" and he slapping him back just as authoritatively."
522;Powerful directing from Norman Jewison, and outstanding original music score from Quincy Jones.
523;An excellent production, adapted by Stirling Silliphant from John Ball's novel.

528;There are sequels to this film.

530;i hope my review was helpful to you!
531;It is a pivotalpoint in this movie.
532;The Detective shows great restraint until this encounter with yet another racist man.
533;Praise God we are progressing.
534;mr. Poitier does a great job, as usual, portraying an educated detective from the North.
535;This is another Sidney Poitier great movie.
536;I love it very munch.
537;Every once in a while does a movie come along that's not only intelligent but thought provoking and it really makes you take a look at government.
538;This is one of those films.
539;it's so much more than the detective story it gets labeled as.
540;And it boasts two of the best performances imaginable.
541;the commentary on the disc is a good one.
542;this is a definite recommended movie from me.
543;This is a true classic!
544;It captures the era as well as the time perfectly.
545;Sidney Poitier is of course fantastic!
546;but they are worth it!
547;There's a handful of reasons Joe Modern viewer may dislike this film.
548;"I'd also recommend ""Mississippi Burning"" and ""A Time To Kill"" to people who enjoy this film."
549;"The plot has many twists and turns
550;rod Steiger and Sidney Potier give powerful performances, each scene they're in together brews with intensity.
551;Steiger won the Oscar for best actor that year"
552;overall a Shawn James five star essential movie.
553;Both the lead performances are truly mesmerising.
554;There are a number of classic scenes in this film of which perhaps my favourite is when the Sheriff interviews Tibbs for the first time and finds he's a policeman.
555;the film is very well directed by Norman Jewison and won 5 Oscars in 1967, including best actor for Rod Steiger.
556;Quincy Jones also deservedly won a Grammy for his music score.
557;I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it.
558;Besides, anything Sir Poiter touches is beyond beautiful and believable.
559;Quick delivery, nicely packaged, excellent film.
560;I gave it as a Christmas gift.
561;thanks you for your great service.
562;I searched other sites and this was the best priced.
563;a great movie with outstanding acting, and I really enjoyed the special feature about where it was filmed and what Sidney went through to film the Movie

570;I shared it with several friends of a certain age.
571;Great to have in a family library.
572;I love this movie, it really shows the superb acting of Sidney Poitier.
573;He is one of my favorites.
574;and in this movie he is great!
575;As is the supporting cast.
576;Watch this movie you will be glad you did!
577;if you want a true insight into the South of the 60's, this is the video for you.
578;while the film isn't comedy, it's certainly entertaining and always leaves me wanting more.
579;Heat is Poitier at his zenith.
580;a joy to see a representation of theway things should not be.
581;Great job Sydney and Rod.
582;I liked that both the white cop and the black cop were bigots.
583;A good portrait of changing times
584;This is one of the truly great movies.
585;The acting by Poitier and Steiger is outstanding.
586;I cannot count how many times I have watched this movie and I always see something new
587;Every time we watch this movie we pick up something new.
588;For example:One of the memorable lines in the movie is : Sheriff .
589;Now I see what the screen.
590;This is a classic that everyone should see.
591;I love those roadside diners and the southern un.
592;I like this movie more for the scenery than the acting, but the acting is good too.
593;I remember growing up watching the tv show of the same name.
594;This is a classic movie with top notch stars.
595;Sidney Poitier fills the screen with his greatness.
596;Plus the all star cast make this one of the best movies ever.
597;So that you will understand I love to read.
598;The book on which the movie is based is a good mystery, a pleasant afternoon read, but the movie is a powerful social commentary, deliberately so, and will stay with you long after the credits have rolled by.
599;I always watch all the extra features, and they did not disappoint, adding depth and dimension to the entire experience of the movie.
600;The message is as true today as it was in 1967.
601;I was afraid the acting would be over the top as it is in many old films, but this film was extremely well done with excellent acting and direction.
602;the plot has many layers and the lighting is gorgeous.
603;I like Steiger's work best, but Sidney is also at a high level here.
604;The supporting cast is uniformly good as well.
605;The film's success eventually led to a multi.
606;Rare and exciting events in cinema annals occur when two great performers are at the top of their craft and are drawn by each other's energy to scale soaring heights.
607;The same kind of brilliant one.
608;"Both Steiger and Oates receive a tremendous jolt when the well dressed Poitier explains that not only is he a visitor from the northeast, specifically Philadelphia, who was preparing to leave town after visiting his mother
609;the interesting character to observe for the film's character arc is Steiger.
610;Grant concludes that solving her husband's death will be greatly enhanced by Poitier heading the investigation.
611;in the most memorable clash between the two men, occurring early in the film, Poitier responds with the most single memorable line of his distinguished movie career.
612;Steiger is a man dominated by privacy.
