1;This is a wonderful charming movie about two coworkers who can't stand each other but they each don't know they are penpals and each can't wait to get each others penpal letters.
2;Both James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan are wonderful in this movie and they had great chemistry together and whoever first thought of casting these two together is a genious!
3;I just watched this movie for the first time this summer and even though some of the movie takes place around Christmas I don't think it's considered to strictly be a Christmas movie so I think it really can be watched anytime of the year and is very highly recommended!
4;This is a great movie!
5;This was a great movie.
6;Stewart was fantastic as usual.
7;The story, although simple kept you wanting to watch it.
8;One of the great charmers of its era.
9;This old fashioned romantic comedy made in 1940 by Ernst Lubitsch ( To Be Or Not To Be ) and written by Samson Raphaelson is like one of the many kinds of movies I remember growing up watching.
10;It's perfect on all levels, the acting is great, Lubitsch's directing is always wonderful, the screenplay is heartfelt, funny, and charming.
11;They each write to each other about cultural subjects, such as literature.
12;After a while, they each start to write about love.
13;plots that take place that give the movie even more heart and sentiment.
14;With the hoilday season coming up, this is a wonderful christmas movie the entire family can sit down and watch.
15;Great Movie, my whole Family loves it .
16;It has all that makes him endearing.
17;Alongside Margaret Sullivan, these two make a very engaging pair and move the story along nicely.
18;I have been a fan of You Have Mail for a long time and I thought the story line came from a book title.
19;Shows you need to do some research on things you enjoy.
20;Great response from the dealer.
21;Recommend it to all fans of light romantic comedies that want a film you can watch with any family members, regardless of age.
22;'The Shop Around The Corner' is one of my favorite films of all time.
23;"James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were brilliant, the story was clever, and the dialogs were witty
I:8708;24;If you cherish the charm of 'You've Got Mail,' and the magic of 'Sleepless in Seattle,' you will love 'The Shop Around The Corner.'
I:8708;25;'The Shop Around The Corner' is marvelous, it is what a romantic comady ought to be.
I:8708;26;Try it, and 'The Shop Around The Corner,' will hold a special spot in your heart as it did mine.
I:8708;27;If you are a Jimmy Stewart fan, this is a great movie that captures his charm and interaction with others.
I:8708;28;I love Jimmy Stewart, and this movie did not disappoint.
I:8708;29;I thought it was very entertaining.
I:8708;30;So, on a second try I found The Shop Around the Corner to be a truly inspired film, one that I didnt wholly expect (because of preconceived notions).
I:8708;31;for me, the depth in the subplots here is where the real joy is found.
I:8708;32;The Shop Around the Corner is a prime example of this"
33;"and Ill say this
I:8708;34;He truly should have been nominated for this film instead, for his layered portrayal of Alfred is astonishing and really heartbreaking (and lifting).
I:8708;35;He can be dramatic, sincere, comedic and romantic in the same film and at times in the same moment and have it all feel so genuine.
I:8708;36;He does that here, and the scene in the caf , when his pride is wounded by Klara, is such a brilliant moment.
I:8708;37;the rest of the cast is very good, Margaret Sullavan and Frank Morgan taking top honors.
I:8708;38;Morgan in particular is VERY strong as the emotionally wounded Matuschek.
I:8708;39;In fact, he may give my favorite performance in this film, because he shields the truth about his persona so beautifully and develops it with such gradual realism.
I:8708;40;but I do love this movie!
I:8708;41;Really that is what matters.
I:8708;42;This is sharp, poignant and entertaining, and few films can be all those things and still remain smooth and comforting.
I:8708;43;A great cast, Jimmy Stewart sand Margaret Sullavan are great together.
I:8708;44;A great cast, it will make you smile and laugh.
I:8708;45;This is the original, later remade into You've Got Mail with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
I:8708;46;I'm a big fan of you've got mail, but i'm an even bigger fan of the SHop around the Corner.
I:8708;47;Unlike you've got mail that tends to drag, this movie is full of energy and you can't see time go by.
I:8708;48;when the two main characters finally discover their love for each other, it is the most poignant romantic scene i've ever seen.
I:8708;49;He had a gift for really making you feel what the characters were going through, and in this case, you really feel the passion he feels for this woman.
I:8708;50;i'm not into romantic comedies too much but if there's one to watch, this is the one, regardless of how old it is, the romance in it is timeless.
I:8708;51;Thanks you for fast delivery of this movie .
I:8708;52;one of the wonderful old ones!
I:8708;53;One of James Stewart's best ones.
I:8708;54;This movie is absolutely delicious and one of Jimmy Stewart's best performances.
I:8708;55;Even when you know where the ending has to go you are held spellbound by the brilliant directing of Lubitsch and fine, fine acting of Stewart and Margaret Sullivan.
I:8708;56;If you want an evening of wonderful character development and story telling, I highly recommend this jewel.
I:8708;57;Jimmy Stewart is so great in this movie.
I:8708;58;This classic movie of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan is one of my favorite movies and later revised for, You Got Mail with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
I:8708;59;fest of love right under our nose from director Ernst Lubitsch.
I:8708;60;Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart lend considerable charm to this tale of a little store in Budapest and two people in love who aren't aware they are corresponding.
I:8708;61;The story is slight but sweet, executed in marvelous fashion by two great stars and an excellent supporting cast.
I:8708;62;Neither has ever seen their true love, of course, and as it turns out, unbeknownst to either, they are in love with each other!Matters are complicated by the infidelity of Mr. Matuschek's wife, since he strongly suspects one of his trusted employees of coming between them.
I:8708;63;He can't stand to see her heart break so keeps the letters coming, hilariously working in the fact that he's seen Alfred, pegging him as the type girls fall for!There are scenes of sweetness and charm seldom matched in any film in this true classic.
I:8708;64;The final scene, on a snowy Christmas Eve in Budapest, when Alfred finally reveals himself to be her suitor is delightful.
I:8708;65;this is a film of delicate grace and humor, showing us that love is often right under our noses, if we could only find the words.
I:8708;66;A romantic film that will have you smiling all the way through.
I:8708;67;It has drama, romance, and comedy.
I:8708;68;Above all, it has a good heart.
I:8708;69;jimmy Stewart's performance here reminds me a lot of """"Harvey"""" in its good natured gentleness."""
70;He projects good sense and a patience that we should all strive for.
71;One of my favorites in the film is the character of Pirovitch .
72;another kind soul, but a family man who tries to keep from becoming a target of the little power struggles within the shop.
73;She is so snide to him a few times that its a little hard to embrace her at the end.
74;The character Pepi is indeed peppy and adds a lot of zing to his spots.
75;every scene is well crafted and convincing, and the movie is guaranteed to leave you with a feeling of warmth and in good spirits.
76;Well, it is, but good ole Mr. Morgan provides that little extra which makes this film a classic.
77;The story is told above (and by other reviewers ad nauseum.
78;amazing how many reviewers think they are the only one speaking of the topic at hand) so I won't go into the particulars of this film.
79;or whomever, in roles played by accomplished talented actors of the past.
80;"So, what about this idea: If you have ever seen ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" ""The Good Fairy"" (wonderfully funny film with Ms. Sullavan and Mr. Morgan), or just relish the pictures made before WW2 especially, then do view this film when the opportunity presents itself."
81;"(See my ""So you'd like to watch films that evince who we are"" amazon guide, if you're looking for other cinematic treats."
82;Oh, golly, what a nice movie!
83;Lots of human empathy and twists, a la Love Actually, and lots of humorous touches in the dialog as well, a la Casablanca.
84;This production from Jimmy Stewart's early days is warm.
85;hearted and extremely relevant in every era.
86;It inspired the 1990s look alike, You've Got Mail, which is wonderful, but the original, Shop Around the Corner, which is set in Hungary, is embracing and almost haunting in an uplifting way.
87;Margaret Sullavan is that odd combination of vulnerable and bossy that is so prominent in the World War II era movies, and Jimmy Stewart is his normal excellent self, playing a strong, principled, but also vulnerable character.
88;It's totally worth the time again and again.
89;It is really good and fun to compare the old version with the newer.
90;"So it comes as a charming surprise when watching the 1940 romance ""The Shop Around The Corner,"" that this semi."
91;classic has aged so well.
92;The dialogue is crisp and sharp, executed with wit and pace.
93;The acting is uniformly superb, as the handful of MGM professionals provide experienced dimensions to even the smallest of supporting roles.
94;The Shop Around The Corner is indeed old fashioned, but in the most charming and pleasant of ways.
95;Based on a play by Nikolaus Laszlo, the film weaves a comfortable tale in and around a Budapest retail store, where a handful of clerks show up each day for work.
96;James Stewart, in fine form as usual, is the head clerk, serving as the silent and emotional leader of the shop.
97;son relationship with the store owner, played by legendary character actor Frank Morgan.
98;margaret Sullavan is a fiery co. worker who argues constantly with Stewart, and their spirited repartee is the highlight of this film.
99;"much credit for the delightful success of ""The Shop Around The Corner"" must be given to director Ernst Lubitsch, whose experienced hand keeps things moving along at a comfortable pace."
100;The dialogue is also the key, and viewers will laugh heartedly throughout this film.
101;Of course, Stewart and Sullavan make a touching couple, independent and head strong to a fault.
102;Viewers will long for this vibrant pair to finally admit their love for one another.
103;The Shop Around The Corner is a lovely holiday charmer.
104;"Heartfelt and touching, it is truly an example of the old axiom, ""They don't make movies like this anymore."""
105;The story has been done many times, but as one of the earliest of the pen pal lover, in life enemy, it is beautiful
106;Margaret Sullavan was superb at delivering her lines in a soft,attractive way while revealing her helpless situation of clinging to her job despite her antagonistic relationship with her superintendant (James Stewart).
107;these two both anticipated for the first meeting with their penpal soulmate and an engagement over the weekend!
108;The last diaglogue between the two was unresistably romantic and well crafted.
109;At the end the reason Margaret gave to explain her previous attitude to James Stewart wrapped the whole story to a perfect ending.
110;Office politics, family affairs, friendship and support were intricately woven into the budding romance, making the movie wholesome.
111;"this is far more superior than its remake ""You've got mail""."
112;Simple plot yet rich in details.
113;James Stewart was great even at such an early age.
114;The story was well written, and even though the setting was very simple, action very laid back, it was the kind of movie that reminds us of a time when life was much simpler and morals were.
115;The plot is brilliant in its simplicity.
116;Male and female work together in a shop.
117;this film is populated with good actors, snappy dialogue, supporting characters that are quirky and interesting because they have their own issues and are well developed.
118;It is a story that is easy to relate to and enjoyable to seen played out.
119;this has been turned into a movie musical, a contemporary movie, and a musical comedy for the stage .
120;all with impressive results rivaling the original's popularity.
121;this movie is quaint and enjoyable and doesn't seem dated given its age.
122;The cast really helps make this a pleasant surprise and a cut above the normal man.
123;i usually don't go for those type of films and that tiresome storyline but this one was refreshing, fun to watch, and oozes with charm.
124;Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play off each other well and make a very handsome couple.
125;The supporting cast is outstanding .
126;likable Felix Bressart to the villain Joseph Schildkraut.
127;frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen him do in his career.
128;"That ""twist"" is another reason this film rises above others of its kind."
129;once again, when a film has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds.
130;This is a great example of that.
131;In this movie, it's romance, comedy and drama and it's well done.
132;I'll take this over the re.
133;Good acting, interesting plot, make you feel good story.
134;A movie you want to see again.
135;My wife and I have always liked You've Got Mail .
136;this is a wonderful film, and the chemistry between Margaret Sullivan and James Stewart is enjoyable and believable.
137;We really enjoyed the movie.
138;So for under $10 we got both movies.
139;The performances are outstanding, and there's mush more depth to the characters than in later versions of this tale (Pillow Talk, You've got Mail, etc.)
140;It's such a great classic and so heartwarming to watch.
141;I loved the movie You've got Mail , so I decided I wanted to see the orginal.
142;I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
143;the acting by the entire cast is great, and Stewart shines.
144;This is a cute movie, I remembered seeing it a long time ago.
145;I happen to like the really old movies and this fits the bill.
146;Jimmy Stewart is great as always.
147;Watched this as a u got mail marathon.
148;First this one, then In The Good Old Summer Time, and ended with You got Mail.
149;Very happy to be able to find this movie.
150;It's one of the great old movies that came out in the past.
151;I got this for my brother.
152;This movie is a family favorite!
153;What a pleasant little film.
154;The title of the film is a good hint.
155;Well, this film is the inspiration for it.
156;"So if you liked the new film, you'll like this one as well
I:8708;157;Some great supporting actors as well.
I:8708;158;It does bog down every once in a while, but for the most part it's a solid film.
I:8708;159;Great characters and a glimpse of another time period.
I:8708;160;Many great films made in Great Depression Era.
I:8708;161;Ernst Lubitsch was a master of the unexpected comedy element, something so idiosyncratic that it defies serious explanation.
I:8708;162;This charming 1940 classic epitomizes his style so well that the subsequent remakes appear either marginally pointless (the musical 1949 version, """"In the Good Old Summertime"""") or excruciatingly formulaic (1998's e. mail update, """"You've Got Mail"""")."""
163;The busy Christmas season provides the appropriate setting to resolve all the plot strands.
164;what strikes me most about the film is not the actual storyline, which borders on predictable and contrived upon closer inspection, but the way Lubitsch and the cast bring it to life in such subtly memorable ways.
165;Young and assured, Stewart gives one of my favorite of his performances as Alfred, and with her buttery speaking voice, Sullavan provides the perfect match as Klara.
166;The other players also make vivid impressions, in particular, Lubitsch regular Felix Bressart as the timid Pirovitch, a cast.
167;Although You've Got Mail was a pretty enjoyable movie, it certainly did not come close to the perfection of the original, made in the 1930s by Lubitsch, who was the master of romantic comedy.
168;Overall, this movie is wonderful .
169;charming, sweet, original and witty!
170;It is one of my favorites.
171;with a cleverly original plot, lots of great dialogue, and wonderful performances by two classic stars, James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, The Shop Around the Corner is a must.
172;It is a very enjoyable movie .
173;perfect for the whole family .
174;The scenes, expressions and acting are very superb and reflect the life style of those days.
175;Jimmy Stewart acted very well, as usual.
176;It is one of those movies that bring out the tenderness of human heart that can be spotted amidst this world of rat.
177;I find it more genuine and more enjoyable than its modern version of You got mail
178;For an Ernst Lubitsch fan this is a must.
179;a gentle film with a simple but clever plot and a touch of fantasy.
180;A beautifully crafted film, more complex than You've Got Mail .
181;Recently, I was reminded of it, and remembered how wonderful it is.
182;Love the story and how it relates to all of us.
183;A good movie to watch if you want one to make you feel good about life.
184;"This is one of the most enthralling movies I've ever seen in my life and arguably, it's the best film that starred both Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who made three other pictures together (""Next Time We Love"" (1936), ""The Shopworn Angel"" (1938), ""The Mortal Storm"" (1940))."
185;the two leads' relationship is so sincere and real, and the events that lead to the conclusion of the movie, are so believable and expertly handled by the director, that make it stand apart from many other movies from Hollywood's classic era.
186;not only a classic, but one of the best films of all time!!
187;Simple everyday people, and just how colorful they can realy be.
188;In the hands of a great director a depression ridden Budapest becomes a soft, charming heaven on earth.
189;Get as many people you love together, or perhaps best just that special one, and prepare to be introduced to a wonderful new Christmas tradition.
190;It is one of our favorites.
191;Too cute and very funny.
192;I recommend for any family entertainment!
193;In Ernst Lubitch's delightful romantic comedy, James Stewart's and Margaret Sullivan's third film together, Stewart plays Alfred Kralick, the best and most experienced employee of Matuschek and Co, a gift shop in Budapest, Hungary.
194;He is in love with a woman with whom he's been anonymously corresponding, found her his soul mate, admires her intelligence, and sense of humor, and is ready to meet her in flesh (very much like now days people meet, communicate, and fell in love on line before they meet in real life .
195;A wonderful story, and I think better than the later remakes.
196;If you like You've got Mail I highly recommend this movie.
197;It's fun to see how the original story unfolds.
198;When I was in college, I fell in love with the show SHE LOVES ME and saw it twice with the original cast (and got autographs of most of them!)
199;it has its good points, certainly, especially in the supporting players.
200;I found them far more believable and likeable than the leads.
201;But Joe Masteroff, who wrote the libretto, really did a magnificent job of streamlining the plot and making it more consistent and understandable.
202;i suppose it's largely because I've known the loved the musical for nearly 45 years, but I really wanted to hear the songs and see certain characters interact as they did on stage.
203;Great movie for any generation.
204;Sharp dialogue, brilliant actors .
205;the shop around the corner is a gem for any movie lover.
206;"I told my friends and family about this little gem
I:8708;207;James Stewart is great as usual and you become easily attached to the other cast members.
I:8708;208;The story is quite simple but charming and the acting is well done from everybody.
I:8708;209;If you enjoy a relaxing romantic comedy, this is for you.
I:8708;210;I love old movies with Jimmy Stewart.
I:8708;211;My favorite Christmas movie is 'It's a Wonderful Life.
I:8708;212;I discovered this old flick three years ago.
I:8708;213;It is adorable, wholesome, and is now in my Chrismas collection.
I:8708;214;I look forward to it every year.
I:8708;215;This is one of the great love stories and I have found that if you loan it out you will have a very hard time getting it back as people TRY to keep it.
I:8708;216;If you like Jimmy Stewart you will love this movie.
I:8708;217;I list this among my top holiday movies, but you'll enjoy it any time of year.
I:8708;218;Supporting actors also do memorable work.
I:8708;219;This charming comedy has sweetness, wit, warmth, a bit of sassiness, and extremely likeable characters.
I:8708;220;This is precisely as I r ember it, with one huge exception.
I:8708;221;Not only is it a great romance but the office dynamics is superb.
I:8708;222;A friend recommended THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER so I was eager to watch it over the Christmas holidays.
I:8708;223;James Stewart does a fine job as the serious store clerk dealing with a perky but unkind coworker played by Margaret Sullavan.
I:8708;224;Stewart actually looked handsome in a dashing way and he does light up the screen.
I:8708;225;I know this film spawned remakes and copycats but what is the point here?I know this is a beloved film and it has gotten high reviews.
I:8708;226;To me the remake """"You've Got Mail"""" is a great movie."""
227;It's funny, light and totally romantic.
228;Good story line, great performances by supporting cast and who doesn't like Jimmy Stewart?
229;Everything he did was always top notch!
230;Morgan puts out a great performance in this movie, sad and rejected!
231;i thought maybe this would be more in line with the remake and about a book store!Still a good wholesome movie and good performances by all!
232;Jimmy Stewart was great and had incredible chemistry with Margaret Sullivan (whom I actually think he was in love with.
233;"The side characters of the story were also very ""alive,"" a rare commodity in a romance, as I've noticed."
234;"Fall in love with movies through ""Shop Around the Corner!"""
235;I did manage to sit through this film after listening to a recommendation on NPR about what a great old holiday movie it was.
236;I have to give Jimmy Stewart credit for his brilliant portrayal of the cad Alfred Kralik.
237;Not the best old movie ive seen but I did enjoy it, it was very sweet and entertaining.
238;A fairly simple love story with a small predictable twist.
239;James Stewart was brilliant as usual and his co start was very adorable as well.
240;Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are great along with the rest of the cast.
241;It was good to see innocence in a movie for a change.
242;This version has the great Jimmy Stewart and is a very cute romantic comedy.
243;Nice and clean fun for the whole family.
244;Based in Budapest (although obviously made in Hollywood), it is very fun to hear the sights and sounds of Budapest recreated for those that have been to the real Budapest in person.
245;I highly recommend if you like Jimmy Stewart films.
246;coms, it comes across as original.
247;"I recommend this to anyone who likes old movies along the lines of ""The Philadelphia Story""."
248;This is one of those movies you watch if you want to relax with your family and some snacks.
249;It is so enjoyable and funny too.
250;It's very heartwarming, and I would recommend it to anyone.
251;It is a love story of two people working in a shop in Budapest, Hungary who are at each other's throats, but unknown to either of them, they are pen pals who write love letters to each other.
252;"if you liked "" You Got Mail"" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, you will like this one because that movie's theme is based upon this classic."
253;there is romance, great humor, drama, and sentiment in this movie.
254;Great performances, including those of the supporting cast, accent this timeless classic.
255;This was for me very special.
256;There is warmth in this movie, and it was very nice for the Holidays.
257;This is the original cast, director, and story.
258;For my money this 1940 classic still tugs at my heart.
259;And it can be considered a Christmas movie since it climaxes at the holiday's eve.
260;Its message is love and companionship without all the pretenses we build in our day to day lives.
261;This lesson is a true Christmas present, gift wrapped and given to us by Ernst Lubitsch in a way no other director could.
262;"They don't make romantic comedies like they used to, and no one made them quite like director Ernst Lubitsch, whose famed ""touch"" lights this wry, poignant, perennially charming film."
263;Rich subplots involving the wonderful Frank Morgan and Joseph Schildkraut, who plays a scheming, boastful employee, let Lubitsch impart further nuance to this modest but wholly pleasing tale.
264;"A delight from start to finish, this is one ""Shop"" you'll want to dally in."
265;Unbeknownest they also work together in the same shop and have developed a healthy dislike for each other.
266;This is one of the best.
267;It is a bit dated and amusing as part of the cast has a Hungarian accent and some don't.
268;It is still the best, the original and a classic.
269;This is a very great artistic masterpiece.
270;What he is able to express with his face during those seconds is miraculous: incredulous near.
271;He's banishing his own son and heir, after all.
272;In other words, music takes on a richness and prominence in this scene that it does not have anywhere else in the film, and that is part of what makes this scene the centerpiece.
273;Great movie for the holidays also old time actors were very good in the roles that played it his a must to watch shop around the corner
274;You will fall in love with this movie!
275;This is a perfect romantic comedy.
276;This movie is full of charm and humor.
277;It makes a great Christmas movie and is highly repeatable.
278;It is one of Jimmy Stewart's best movies.
279;Absolutely wonder to watch it again and when I want to at Christmas time.
280;Movie was so clear and sound great!!!
281;I appreciate being able to watch a clean movie without any vulgar or dirtiness to it.
282;I love the characters, the comedy, and the innocence of the times.
283;"Just an all round good family movie before all the smut and sludge took over the film industry.You can't beat ""Shop Around the Corner""."
284;I first saw it at the library and checked it out.
285;I believe it is based on a play which was based on a book.
286;This is one I can watch many times and still enjoy.
287;Anyone who enjoys a good clean romance will find this delightful.
288;Jimmy Stewart is particularly good.
289;The Shop Around the Corner is the first movie that fit into the genre of classic romance.
290;"It is interesting to see how one movie can morph over and over again, ending with ""You've got mail"" I love seeing how people change their attitude over the years."
291;In the good o summer time, And yougot mail are ok.
292;Great for the entire family to watch.
293;"If you enjoyed ""You've Got Mail"" with Ryan and Hanks, you should enjoy this movie ."
294;Loved this movie, one of my new Christmas favorites.
295;The two leads are a good match.
296;up, the characters around them are funny, endearing, and colorful, and the story line has enough tension to be engaging while remaining amusing.
297;Love how young and sweetly gorgeous Mr. Stewart is in this movie.
298;"and it's pretty clear that this is a movie that can be truly called ""classic"" in every sense of the word."
299;"The director had a unique feel for filmmaking, and the ""Lubitsch touch"" lives up to its legend."
300;Speaking of legends, the leads make one of the best screen couples in history.
301;Stewart's Everyman is completely believable alongside Sullavan's refreshingly natural appeal.
302;"But for sheer enjoyment, return to the ""Shop Around the Corner"" more than once."
303;It's well worth the trip!
304;This was a great film I loved every minute of it.
305;Sullavan and Stewart were so good together.
306;Great movie to add to anyones collection.
307;This original version is, by far, the best of the three.
308;while the acting abilities of James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan are legendary, it's the supporting cast that truly carries this film.
309;Frank Morgan (perhaps best known for his role as the Wizard of OZ) is marvelous as Mr. Matuschek, the shop owner.
310;Sara Hayden, Felix Bressart, and Joseph Schildkraut round out the principle supporting cast and all turn in wonderful performances.
311;if you're a fan of James Stewart or Margaret Sullivan you must see this film.
312;If you love romantic comedies, this is one of the best.
313;And if you just want to see a thoroughly enjoyable movie, watch this one and you won't be disappointed.
314;This is a delightful vintage movie that has had several remakes, the most recent being You've Got Mail with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
315;Having seen both versions, this 1940 film has got it beat.
316;Beautifully directed by Ernst Lubitsch, this is a charming, romantic comedy that sets the standard for this genre of film.
317;the premise of the film is simple.
318;there is also a strong sub.
319;This sets in to motion a sequence of interconnecting events and revelations that work beautifully, setting the film for its final resolution between the two main protagonists, Kralik and Novak.
320;Stewart always shines when playing the classic Everyman.
321;Margaret Sullavan, as Novak, gives a pert and sassy performance that belies her longing for romance in her life and for her knight in shining armor.
322;As they say, there is a fine line between love and hate.
323;frank Morgan gives a well.
324;William Tracy, as the indefatigable Pepi Katona, the store messenger on the make, is absolutely delightful.
325;this is a masterfully directed film, with wonderful performances by the entire cast.
326;It is a film to be remembered and added to one's personal collection.
327;I was having a discussion about old movies with a woman who loves the classic old movies, and I was surprised to hear her say that she dislikes Jimmy Stewart.
328;She feels that he always has an attitude.
329;here in Shop Around The Corner he doesn't sink to those depths, but he is very sneaky, devious, almost wolfish in the way he treats the female lead, once he knows what she doesn't know, that she is the one he has been secretly corresponding with.
330;He strings her along, sets her up, keeps his secret, keeps his upper hand.
331;he is typecast, consistently, as someone who is cutting, tough, self centered, insensitive, yet at heart a pretty decent guy nonetheless.
332;He's a tough guy and he is perfectly capable of cutting you off at the knees.
333;His everyday charm belies his toughness, and he's simply not that nice a guy.
334;that said, I like this movie.
335;The boss is no better than you are.
336;And Europe in 1940 fit the bill.
337;In that sense, it was refreshing to see the All American Jimmy Stewart not being a yes man.
338;Coors is as right wing as Stewart in real life, a pair of real neo.
339;with all this negativity in my review, I am giving it an almost perfect four stars because it is a very good movie.
340;The Wizard of Oz is excellent in his role of store owner, and his character ends up being an awful lot more likeable and sympathetic than the two annoying lovebirds.
341;Even when he thinks that Stewart has seduced his wife and made a cuckold of him, he is unfailingly kind and considerate to him, in his speech and manner.
342;And he takes great joy in bringing happiness to others.
343;He is a true gentleman.
344;these old romantic comedies are priceless.
345;old daughter and I enjoy these together, so that makes them even more special.
346;It brings us together as a mother and daughter and I think the movies will always mean alot more because of this.

349;It's a charming little film.
350;If you like classic movies, this is a good one.
351;Glad I ran across it.
352;Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan sparkle in this superbly acted and well.
353;I'm an old movie fan and this definitely ranks in my top ten although not a lot of people are familiar with it.

363;This movie is a nice change of pace.

366;it's not just the timeless appeal of the two leads.
367;Jimmy Stewart is a favorite of mine.
368;You will love this movie.
369;A few twists and turns but ultimately a true love story!
370;A very sweet, well acted movie.
371;If you liked You've Got Mail, you will enjoy this.
372;The chemistry between Margaret Sullavan and Jimmy Stewart is marvelous to see.
373;The dialogue is so clever, and even the supporting characters are memorable.
374;It's a great little movie.
375;It has everything else it needs to make it worth watching.
376;And yet, the movie proved to be very worth the while and both my wife and I enjoyed it.
377;It's a lovely, touching tale.
378;It's sentimental, but also balanced.
379;It is realistic and it has a few lovely touches of humor.
380;Well, this is one movie that has so many nice layers, it can stand on it's own.
381;Certainly, for Mr Stewart, it was very real.
382;Watch it if you can for what a gem it is.
383;Classic blend of comedy, romance and heartfelt humanity.
384;Great writing, great acting and a great story that bears watching at least once a year at Christmas time.
385;The Shop Around the Corner, starring James Stewart, is a good classic movie.
386;Ernst Lubitsch, Hollywood's greatest master of sophisticated comedy, made a number of classics.

412;There is also, along with the sense that many are hiding their best selves, the understanding that just as many people .

414;That aside, this is a wonderful, sweet little movie.

416;The surrounding cast was wonderful.
417;Jimmie Stewart and Margaret Sullivan are the best combination in this movie.
418;I was telling my daughter about it and she wants to see it too.
419;A quintessential Jimmy Stewart charmingly paired with a very lovely Margaret Sullavan provide the subtle humor to this film about two employees at a gift shop in Budapest, Hungary who absolutely loathe each other.
420;on a daily basis, these two people do not like each other at all, however the highlight of their week is to go to their post office box and get wonderful long letters from their pen pals.
421;this film can be enjoyed by many on lots of levels.
422;An old that's really quite nice.
423;Ernest Lubitsch made many a frothy film during his tenure, with a remarkably European flair (considering that none of his films were ever shot in Europe).
424;This is the film that proves opposites attract!
425;As the lovers, James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan are an inspired team.
426;there's considerable magic left in this delightful romantic comedy from MGM.
427;The audio has been nicely restored.
428;*One the former is actually included on the disc.
429;THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is an utterly charming romantic comedy with beautiful pacing and atmosphere.
430;It's their show, though Frank Morgan nearly steals it with his deeply touching performance as the shop owner, who suspects his wife of infidelity.
431;This is so much Better!
432;This is a really cute movie with one of my favorite actors.
433;The Bottom Line:Far better than the AOL commerical of a remake, The Shop Around the Corner is a fun and sweet old romantic comedy that makes good use of Jimmy Stewart's screen persona and is recommended to anyone who likes this sort of film.
434;This movie is a definite must see!
435;Great romance and a good one to break you in as most people have seen the remake You've Got Mail.

441;perhaps the ultimate romantic comedy.
442;"If you knew me, you would know how uncharacteristic it is for me to be enthused over a ""romantic"" movie of any kind, but this excellent film brings it out of me."
443;With an ensemble cast that could only exist when the studio system was in full flower, this classic film unites Stewart with friend Henry Fonda's wife in a charming and quirky romance tour de force.
444;It was fun to watch and have it unfold just like the Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan movie.
445;I still enjoy watching It's wonderful life , while this one isn't quite as good, it was still fun to watch and would recommend it.
446;Always enjoy Jimmy Stewart movies.
447;This one (The Shop Around the Corner) was one of his best, but then, he was always a good actor.
448;Here's a movie with charm in spades, and a beguiling premise.
449;A man and a woman begin a correspondence, and through this correspondence they fall in love, while in real life despising each other.
450;The setting is an odd goods shop in Budapest, staffed by a superb supporting cast, each tossing into the storyline their own minor dramas.
451;~ that presents her with lavish gifts, Pepi with his heart of gold, and my favorite, the mousish Flora who devotes her life to her mother, and whom you just know is dreaming of a romance of her own.
452;It is said that Stewart and Sullavan held a deep personal respect for each other off screen, and this makes for a genuine on.
453;This chemistry is of the intellectual variety, and ~ to this viewer at least ~ their sparring conversations and confrontations are greatly more interesting and engaging than any purely physical romance could ever be.
454;Sullavan is terrific, wavering between what she reads in books and thinks she ought to believe, and what her heart is prompting her to feel.
455;Everyone is impeccable in their roles, the wit and the banter sparkles.
456;Here's a film that shall grow on you, that shall take you in completely, and will demand repeat viewings ~ and possibly the use of a tissue or two.
457;Intelligent and heartwarming, and infused with a kind of a quiet magic, 'The Shop Around the Corner' ought melt any heart, save the most unmeltable.
458;The Christmas season is coming and if you still don't have this movie, I very strongly recommend you get this movie!
459;While at the same time, Kralik is having a great time corresponding with an anonymous woman and begins to fall in love with her.
460;a totally wonderful story with such a great cast, each and every actor and actress perfect for the parts they portray.
461;I keep contact between Mr. Matuschek and the customers.
462;For those who love this movie I highly recommend You've Got Mail with great actor Tom Hanks and actress Meg Ryan.
463;This is basically the original You've Got Mail , it's a must see to compare to.
464;Jimmy Stewart is amazing and so funny.
465;If you like You've Got Mail , you'll love this too!
466;It was good to see the original that was the inspiration for You've Got Mail.

476;This film is a classic: truly a romance unfurls before your eyes.
477;I've seen both this and The Shop Around The Corner with meg Ryan and Tom hanks (it was based on this film) and I really do prefer this one.
478;The genuine feelings they share over these written letters is touching.
479;Funny enough to make you laugh out loud multiple times .
480;it really is a great film
481;I highly recommend Shop Around The Corner.
482;a clever, refreshing romantic classic with lots of wit.
483;The fact it was directed by Ernst Lubitsch has a great deal to do with that ranking, and (from a purely personal perspective) the presence of Jimmy Stewart.
484;I don't do rankings but if I had to rank my favorite actor of all time it would be Stewart, and he absolutely shines in this film.

488;The two remakes are excellent too and it is only by virtue of the fact Ive seen all three that I can put this one at the top.
489;Love Jimmy Stewart and the original was good but not that great.
490;Considering that the original was set in Poland and all of the actors accents where straight Chicago, maybe for a 1950's movie it was really good.
491;This is a great 1940's film that might be considered the same as a small movie sleeper hit today.
492;Great comic timing, deviousness, inuendo, accusations, dislike for fellow employee.you name it, this film has it all.
493;I like the fact that it is somewhat daring for its time and the chemistry with it's stars is undeniable.
494;Great love story too by the way.
495;Typically, Lubitsch was the unparalleled master of the sophisticated and elegant sex comedy.
496;If in his other films Lubitsch covers the sexier realm of romance, in this one, he explores romance based on mutual respect.
497;perhaps because his subject matter is simpler than in his other films, Lubitsch engages in far fewer of the cinematic pyrotechnics he employs in his other films.
498;The narrative here is far more straightforward.
499;Like in most of his films, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is impeccably well cast, from the leads to the least of the supporting characters.
500;and Margaret Sullivan are outstanding in the romantic leads.
501;Stewart was perfect for the role of head clerk.
502;But for my money Frank Morgan, fresh off his reign as The Wizard of Oz, steals most of the scenes he is in.
503;this is just a great movie.
504;Not perhaps one of Lubitsch's very greatest films, but one that shows that he was the greatest master of the romantic comedy of his or any other era.
505;This was a fun movie.
506;Jimmy Stewart was great as always.
507;The female co. star did a good job too.
508;This was a good way to spend an evening with my wife.
509;She liked it a lot too.
510;This is an adorable movie!
511;It's such an innocent love story, that you can't help but get sucked in.
512;The acting is quite good, and the dialogue (and bickering) sounds natural.
513;This is indeed a great film.
514;It's a very innocent sweet, romantic film.
515;I'd give it ten stars if I could.
516;My wife and I enjoy the well done movies of the era.
517;They usually have a good story line, acting, and verbal communication along with the lack of profanity that exists in todays movies.
518;I like the original best.
519;James Stewart of course was wonderful.
520;I thought Margaret Sullivan played her role well, too.
521;All of the actors were great.
522;that's why we love our rom.
523;jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are so perfect.
524;I've watched it several times, and just watched it again, tonight with my sweet Norman.
525;"he didn't want to, as he thought it would be a ""chick movie,"" but he loved it!the supporting cast ."
526;great for the whole family, or for a date .
527;The film has a great way of resolving this with each finding the other somewhat attractive and things work out in the end.
528;The rest of the film is a resolution of not only his relationship with his boss and crew, but the humorous way that he plays on Carla before she realizes who her pen pal really is.
529;and just like in You've Got Mail, [You've Got Mail (Deluxe Edition)] the meeting is a match made in heaven.
530;great performances, a bit of overacting and some dark moments pepper this entertaining romantic comedy.
531;This is one of the most beautifully acted and paced movies ever made in America.
532;The special chemistry of Margaret Sullavan and Jimmy Stewart plus a charming story set in a Budapest gift and leather goods store make this little 1940 movie a gem.
533;"Their performances are full of grace notes
I:8708;534;As for Sullavan, this is a peerless performance: she makes the shopgirl's pretenses believable, lyrical and funny.
I:8708;535;Frank Morgan shines in his interpretation of Mr. Matuschek.
I:8708;536;Granted, the story holds no real surprises, but it's presented with great style"
537;A movie full of laughs.
538;A black and white classic that keeps you in stitches but at the same time leaves you with that so good feeling when it ends.
539;If you like the modern I think you would love the original even more.
540;You will enjoy all the unexpected twists and turns of their romance!
541;Better than the Judy Garland Good Ole Summertime version.
542;all the characters work together and flow, it is the best version that's all
543;"The Shop Around the Corner is a delightful ""classic"" movie, fun, upbeat, and nostalgic."
544;Even though the plot is fairly predictable, the characters are witty and charming, drawing the viewer into an era in which people valued right over wrong rather than political correctness.
545;"We enjoy both movies and consider ""The Shop Around the Corner"" a welcome addition to our video library."
546;This is the original movie, I think, of two people who can't really understand each other in direct communication but who can find the part of each that they love through remote communication.
547;a more recent movie version is You've Got Mail I enjoyed the latter a bit more but it is really worth while taking a good look at the earlier one.
548;The Shop Around the CornerThis Ernst Lubitsch film is a gem.
549;Its charm stems from every aspect of the production.
550;The acting is excellent, as is the dialogue, directing, photography.
551;Under the guise of a clever plot we see the profound humanity shine through the subtle wit of Lubitsch and the starring roles played exquisitely by Jimmy Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan and Joseph Schildkraut.
552;In short: A Great Film.
553;Far better and more touching than the remake with Tom Hanks.
554;Frank Morgan steals the show in the last scenes.
555;James Stewart is, as always, the responsible, hard working character who learns to lighten up.
556;Margaret Sullavan is Klara Novak, a feisty new hire.
557;Of course they share one other thing .
558;That said, Lubitsch comes across with one beautiful shot that would have been impossible to duplicate on radio or in a theater.
559;Shot from the inner side of the post office boxes we see #38 being opened and a gloved hand feeling around the empty interior.
560;lubitsch also has fun with the wonderful character actor Felix Bressart, who plays the wise and timid clerk Pirovitch.
561;It's an ennobling moment, one of many in this fine movie.
562;stewart and Sullavan are convincing as a couple unknowingly throwing barbs at the object of their tenderest affections.
563;i'm not sure I ever saw it back in the day, but it was still fresh and heart warming.
564;The Shop Around the Corner is a good film that makes for an enjoyable movie.
565;"Like ""You've Got Mail"", this film is clean and fun."
566;This would make for a great date.
567;"I don't think younger people will appreciate it as much as more mature viewers
I:8708;568;This was a very enjoyable movie.
I:8708;569;It's humorous, sweet, and does a good job on the sensitive subject matter that is included in the story.
I:8708;570;In the 1930s and '40s, Ernst Lubitsch made some of the most charming romantic comedies ever made, including """"The Love Parade"""" with Maurice Chevalier and """"Ninotchka"""" with Greta Garbo, not to mention """"To Be or Not To Be,"""" one of the greatest comedies of all time."""
571;It is far superior to either.
572;She gets hired, and quickly they get on each other's nerves.
573;but what makes this movie interesting to me is the real.
574;She met best friends Stewart and Henry Fonda when all three were members of the Cape Cod.
575;She and Stewart were in love for a time, and he reportedly carried a torch for her until his 1949 marriage.
576;But all that lay in the future when this film was made, and I take some consolation in the fact the sparks that fly between Stewart and Sullavan were based on real emotion.
577;not two features as the Amazon description might lead you to believe), and a great old.
578;This is a clean romance with wonderful acting.

580;I'm going to watch this movie again.
581;intended), I thought this softly played romance was excellent.
582;The real magic is that Lubitsch has told a bittersweet story with a light touch and such tender humor that no one can come away brutalized by scenes of jilted love and attempted suicide.
583;It was a wholesome really good movie, with kindness, forthrightness, and honest words.
584;If you consider the period this film was released, it's quite wonderful.

589;It was an innocent age in Hollywood prior to WWII, and the movies expressed this innocence and charm.

591;If you are looking for a great Holiday romance movie, this is it.
592;"The concept has been translated now into three films, this one, and the musical ""In the Good Old Summertime"" and the contemporary ""You've Got Mail."""
593;I like all three very much, and it is fascinating to watch each of them in turn.
594;It is comic, and heart.
595;tugging, and also a depiction of a world long gone.
596;Ernst Lubitsch's gentle comedy weaves together seamlessly and beautifully a handful of narrative strands, chiefly the shakey romantic development of stars Stewart and Sullavan's unusual relationship.
597;the story is believably told and engagingly acted by a cast that also includes Frank Morgan alongside the two perfectly matched leads.
598;Script is witty, and the design of the production is quite charming.
