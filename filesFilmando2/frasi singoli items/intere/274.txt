I:11303;1;Its a murder mystery with clues given throughout the film, some you get and some you dont.
I:11303;2;Bale is a great great actor and his performance is excellent.
I:11303;3;The ending is so good, you'll want to watch it for a 2nd time right after you've just watched it for the 1st time.
I:11303;4;"Jennifer Jason Leigh does a good job and I wonder how she got so lucky being in 2 of the coolest movies in '06, including another mind trip call ""The Jacket."""
I:11303;5;If you want to watch a movie with superb acting, get this.
I:11303;6;Christian Bale is amazing, what he did to his body for this role is unbelievable!!
I:11303;7;Keeps you on the edge of your seat
I:11303;8;the way I like my movies.
I:11303;9;The Machinist starring Christian Bale is eerie, isolating, and brilliant.
I:11303;10;due exhaustion but I can tell you this is one film that you will watch over and over again.
I:11303;11;Defintely a standout from 2003, watch for the clues so with that advice in mind, The Machinist is a film I highly recommend!
I:11303;12;philosophical urban drama: definitely a Twilight Zone episode on steroids.
I:11303;13;christian Bale is really quite a fine actor.
I:11303;14;I am not writing this formal review (negatively) to take away from the performances and/or direction in this wonderful little film.
I:11303;15;They are stellar in fact.
I:11303;16;This movie is disturbingly fun.
I:11303;17;I wanted so much to like this film, but I am forced to look past this wonderful production on account of originality.
I:11303;18;Am I alone?I am giving this film 3 stars because it was made so well.
I:11303;19;I really wonder how these people made such a great film.
I:11303;20;"She wins an Oscar, not because her acting was good, but because people could not believe that was Theron so ""ugly""."
I:11303;21;From that point on I was a strong believer that you could dress up the actor all you want, but deep inside it is still the same actor.
I:11303;22;I my utter surprise, it was not.
I:11303;23;"Bale, by dropping the weight, accomplished what so many ""physical"" actors can only dream about."
I:11303;24;He gave depth, a physical persona, and a very frightening image to this character that took us away from Bale the actor.
I:11303;25;Perhaps Bale couldn't do the character otherwise, but for me, a viewer of the film, it helped create the dark ambiance that shook me to the core until the very end.
I:11303;26;You know that you are missing something and that the ending will shock and amaze you.
I:11303;27;For anyone that has grown up in the Usual Suspects or Sixth Sense era, you can smell this film coming from a mile away, but it is the way that Anderson provides the story to you that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.
I:11303;28;Anderson has done a brave new job with The Machinist in providing that chatter after the film.
I:11303;29;It is haunting, riveting, and challenging all at the same time .
I:11303;30;to say that about a director's work is rare today.
I:11303;31;Jennifer Jason Leigh again gives us the beauty of grime and the ability to transform this very small character into a powerhouse role.
I:11303;32;"She gives so much emotion and humility to her character, which makes you forget (or perhaps not notice) what her true ""profession"" is."
I:11303;33;He is huge, bulky, and rather transfixing as perhaps the living conscious of Bale.
I:11303;34;She gives comfort to not only Reznik, but also to us.
I:11303;35;She is our guiding light at the end of this dark tunnel that surprises you to the very end.
I:11303;36;A powerful cast that is accentuated with a bold and original story.
I:11303;37;It was inspirational to see such dark, yet powerful storytelling to come from a nearly recycled Hollywood.
I:11303;38;Bale goes to a new extreme proving that he can manage both big box office hits, and these itty.
I:11303;39;overall, I really thought this was one of the most powerful films to come out of Hollywood this year.
I:11303;40;Bale is becoming such a strong actor because he is constantly working with the quintessential directors in Hollywood.
I:11303;41;One of the best pieces of celluloid magic I've seen come out of America, and I didn't even know it until the second time through.
I:11303;42;not a single thing is incidental, every aspect, shot, every handwritten note, every character name, every clock face, prop and line is so layered with significance it's a joy behold.
I:11303;43;He's a sweet guy who is going insane.
I:11303;44;this kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.
I:11303;45;One of the best movies I've seen so far this year.
I:11303;46;His performance is excellent, and his reptilian look adds to the mystery of the plot, which includes his claim that he has not slept in a year.
I:11303;47;"gijn is wonderful as Marie the waitress, and Jennifer Jason Leigh is superb as Stevie, a ""heart of gold"" prostitute who befriends Trevor."
I:11303;48;In smaller parts there is Michael Ironside as Miller, who works in the machine shop, and John Sharian as the bizarre Ivan.
I:11303;49;the cinematography by Xavi Gim nez, mostly in steely shades of blue and gray, is extremely effective.
I:11303;50;By keeping most of the action in an old machine shop and a warehouse, the film's locations have the look of any dilapidated part of town, anywhere in the world.
I:11303;51;directed by Brad Anderson, this strange but sometimes oddly beautiful film is not going to appeal to everyone, but is sure to become a cult favorite.
I:11303;52;It needs more than one viewing, so that one can see it after having put the puzzle together, and appreciate it for its cinematic skill, which is almost deserving of a 5 star rating.
I:11303;53;this movie is a feast for all the senses.
I:11303;54;The music is great, it's about time someone gave some love to the theremin again.
I:11303;55;key directing style along with Christian Bale's magnificent acting make one helluva combination.
I:11303;56;Michael Ironside is equally entertaining, but then, when is he not?
I:11303;57;I absolutely loved Session 9, and this is sort.
I:11303;58;If you are a fan of psychological thrillers and/or intelligent horror movies, this one (and Session 9!)
I:11303;59;That's worth knowing because the world you enter is dark indeed.
I:11303;60;gijon are wonderful, offering tantalizing glimmers of hope.
I:11303;61;then we wonder, as he does, if the truth might be something less spectacular, but far more chilling, much closer to home.
I:11303;62;There is nothing funny or warm to be found here, but The Machinist is a brilliant film featuring an astounding performance by Christian Bale.
I:11303;63;If you're not afraid of the dark, you will find it riveting.
I:11303;64;This movie is very good.
I:11303;65;He spends his time working, visiting a prostitue, Jennifer Jason Leigh, surprisingly good in this film, and having coffee in the wee hours of the morning at a local airport.
I:11303;66;And Christian Bale's performance and dedication to the role is exemplifying.
I:11303;67;fight Club, A Beautiful Mind.
I:11303;68;Everyone should see this movie .
I:11303;69;Christian Bale is a brilliant actor.
I:11303;70;This movie will have you on the edge of your seat for an unbelievable ending.
I:11303;71;christian bale has become my favorite actor.
I:11303;72;i loved american psycho, and this movie was just as great.
I:11303;73;even if you do not like him this movie is worth watching at least once.
I:11303;74;The movie had a good plot, but I couldnt get most of it.
I:11303;75;Christian Bale is one of the greatest, under used actors of modern cinema.
I:11303;76;'The Machinist' is easily one of the best films I have seen in a long time.
I:11303;77;Still, the main criticisms I've read about 'The Machinist' are the very reasons people like myself love it.
I:11303;78;You truly are immersed into the shoes of the protagonist (Christian Bale, in a career defining performance.)
I:11303;79;You may or may not enjoy the plot and subject matter, but you cannot deny that the film succeeds wonderfully in what it is attempting.
I:11303;80;"It will surprise you, but not in the typical Hollywood gimmicky ""Gotcha!"""
I:11303;81;It is both surprising and satisfying.
I:11303;82;I'm a big fan of psychological drama, and this one was chilling in the way it diagrams how the mind deals with something with which it cannot cope.
I:11303;83;Christian Bale gave an utterly amazing performance, capturing the tenuous psychological makeup of his character.
I:11303;84;director Anderson does a fine job depicting a boundless downfall with intriguing support and detail.
I:11303;85;the score is catchy and similar to Hitchcock films of old .
I:11303;86;Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a convincing prostitute (I mean this as a compliment), Stevie, who is strong and nimble though vulnerable.
I:11303;87;In the end, Anderson and Bale do well to include all the ingredients for a wallop of an ending.
I:11303;88;it is a great psychological thriller that keeps you thinking from beginning to end.
I:11303;89;"If you enjoyed ""The Jacket"" or ""The Butterfly Effect,"" you'll enjoy this movie just as much."
I:11303;90;Let's have a whole lot of random odd things happen and in the end it will turn out the guys nuts.
I:11303;91;This is by far the best performance he's ever delivered and the best mind bending movies out there.
I:11303;92;Bale ranks to me as one of the most dedicated male actors in hollywood.1.
I:11303;93;An interesting question if the truth is eventually figured out.
I:11303;94;christian Bale's character is really convincing and delivers perfect edge of your seat suspense.
I:11303;95;I believe I understood the rest of it.
I:11303;96;This is a thinking person's psychological thriller.
I:11303;97;(His Session 9 is another masterpiece.)
I:11303;98;Film gives off a great creepy feel.
I:11303;99;Must have if you enjoy movies like Jacob's Ladder or Shutter Island
I:11303;100;This was an excellent movie.
I:11303;101;I think Christian Bale is a great actor who went above and beyond to make his character and the performance exceptional.
I:11303;102;Is not common in this days watch a great film.
I:11303;103;Happens once a month if you watch one a day.
I:11303;104;Ok, take a shortcut,this is one of this ones.
I:11303;105;Mr Bale is top, the image is great and the score awesome.
I:11303;106;Even when you're prepared for it, it's still shocking.
I:11303;107;trevor works a blue collar job as a machinist.
I:11303;108;Still, the original screenplay, combined with good directing make this a great film to look at.
I:11303;109;And the reveal at the end, which answers most of the film's questions, is genuinely surprising and satisfying.
I:11303;110;gijon), and generally plods through life.
I:11303;111;Bale captures the insomniac's desperate need for sleep perfectly.
I:11303;112;He looks like a deranged scarecrow!
I:11303;113;Well, he was extremely fit and chipper compared to Reznik!
I:11303;114;I kept thinking that he should just eat a big sandwich and go to bed!
I:11303;115;My favorite scenes are in the funhouse and the machine shop.
I:11303;116;fi icon Michael Ironside (Scanners, Visiting Hours, Total Recall, Starship Troopers, etc.) is very good in his role as one of Reznik's fellow machinists named Miller.
I:11303;117;It's plain and simple excellent.
I:11303;118;Christian Bale should have been nominated for an oscar and Jennifer Jason Leigh is very good as well.
I:11303;119;I agree whole heartedly that this movie is one that definitely worth the money and worth reviewing.
I:11303;120;Well, you'll love him in The Machinist.
I:11303;121;This one, you have to pay attention to.
I:11303;122;it makes you wonder who that fat white guy is and how it will end with the lady at the airport cafe.
I:11303;123;When you see the ending it will all make perfect sense, but then again, it wont.
I:11303;124;"It has an amazing ending on how you will tell yourself, ""wow."
I:11303;125;"Everything ""works"" in this movie."
I:11303;126;the color palate, the supporting characters, the atmospheric score.
I:11303;127;So I recommend this movie.
I:11303;128;constructed and entertains and one can watch the career of a truly wonderful, potentially great, actor progress.
I:11303;129;"If there is any doubt of Christian Bale's dedication to his ""craft"" check this movie out."
I:11303;130;an ominous and deeply stirring account of a man on the extreme edge of existence.
I:11303;131;many years ago I read the monumental work, The Brothers Karamazov, by Dostoyevsky.
I:11303;132;Until now, I had never seen a modern movie that so eerily captures the deep, dark torment of the human soul.
I:11303;133;this is a wonderfully acted film that will challenge you, and frighten you, and ultimately leave you profoundly affected by the experience.
I:11303;134;If you are into psychological suspense, see this movie tonight, it's amazingly well done.
I:11303;135;The themes of both films are remarkably similar .
I:11303;136;i enjoyed 'The Jacket', but found this to be a notch higher in the mind.
I:11303;137;judgement played out in a contemporary and real yet disturbingly soulless backdrop, turns this film into one of the best adaptations yet of a novel that Kafka never wrote, and that's the kind of accolade that Bale's sacrifice to his art surely merits.
I:11303;138;If you're interested in independent films that provide something more than the typical blockbuster fanfare, this film is for you.
I:11303;139;Fantastic psychological thriller with Christian Bale doing what he does best: amazing acting.
I:11303;140;great script, acting, directing, music .
I:11303;141;you name it, this movie's got it.
I:11303;142;bale is superb as the tortured soul Reznik.
I:11303;143;so, whilst slightly derivative, The Machinist remains a very clever and satisfying morality tale.
I:11303;144;remember, always take the Right path!PS.
I:11303;145;sensitive should be prepared to avert their gaze.
I:11303;146;His acting is superb as he plays the role of Trevor, a machinist who has not been able to sleep for year and is only beginning to put the pieces together to understand why he is mentally falling apart.
I:11303;147;I found this performance superior to his great work in American Psycho.
I:11303;148;His ability to transform his body to play this part was incredible.
I:11303;149;the plot is excellent in that as Trevor begins to sort out hallucination from reality and to sort out memories from living nightmares, so too is the audience trying to make sense of the film and the trama that may have stimulated Trevor's inability to sleep.
I:11303;150;It is a super psychological thriller.
I:11303;151;before ending this review, I must comment on the superb cinematography and art direction in the film.
I:11303;152;When filming a psychological drama, camera angle, the interplay of dark and light, the framing of scenes to create anxiety or disqust are all part of the cinematographer's art.
I:11303;153;It significantly adds to the story line and acting and makes this product get 5 stars.
I:11303;154;Also, the art direction was fantastic, keeping the film within a dark grey range of color with only pale flesh adding any warmth to the screen.
I:11303;155;He starts off as a pleasant, intelligent guy, and his steady girl is also a likable, sympathetic person.
I:11303;156;he manufactures people and occurrences that at first seem real, but he finally realizes that they are anything but real.
I:11303;157;christian Bale gives an excellent performance in this movie and at its conclusion I found that I could feel for him in his torment.
I:11303;158;It is a difficult movie to watch at times, but one does take away from it the complexities of the human mind, and the power of the unconscious, or the soul, over the human mind.
I:11303;159;It is a modern day take on Poe's Tell.
I:11303;160;Son is big Christian Bale fan.
I:11303;161;This movie is one of his best.
I:11303;162;My son loved the movie.
I:11303;163;If you like creepy uncomfortable dark movies you will love this.
I:11303;164;Bale's transformation though was amazing.
I:11303;165;Always love purchasing from Amazon.
I:11303;166;While walking down the stairs, the meatloaf smelled delicious.
I:11303;167;It's interesting enough for a second thought.
I:11303;168;If you are a fan of outside thinking, than this is the one.
I:11303;169;A pretty decent dark movie.
I:11303;170;I like Bale's movies but American Psycho is much better.
I:11303;171;He talks to them and ponders what is happening to him.
I:11303;172;The revelation at the end of why he can't sleep is beautifully done and not revealed in any way earlier in the film.
I:11303;173;the Machinist is blue in tone, both the look of the movie and the emotions of the characters and the soundtrack.
I:11303;174;It's a little slow in places but is also wonderfully acted and directed.
I:11303;175;It definitely makes the character all that more believable and sympathetic, but it's also kind of crazy.
I:11303;176;When this movie ended I found myself saying wow Bale, I completely believed you in this role.
I:11303;177;guilt is definitely enough to drive someone to the edge!
I:11303;178;I picked up this film because I was a huge fan of Bales work in American Psycho.
I:11303;179;This film is a greatpsychological thriller that will keep you wanting more throughout the entire movie.
I:11303;180;This is a morality tale about consequences and responsibility.
I:11303;181;Christian Bale may be one of greatest actors of all time!
I:11303;182;Christian Bale's performance as Trevor Reznik, a somnambulist with the appearance of a concentration camp refugee, defies criticism and deserves all the acclaim he has received across the world.
I:11303;183;one should also mention the soundtrack, an eerie, at times intense piece that underpins the tale, creating the desired, lingering effect.
I:11303;184;the Machinist would have to be one of the best films produced in 2004.
I:11303;185;I will watch for the soundtrack for this beautiful and tormented film.
I:11303;186;Subtle and effective theremin accents make it haunting and other.
I:11303;187;director Anderson finally reveals the mystery of Bale's existence and we realize that what we have viewed is a window into the extreme psychological ramifications of a guilty conscience.
I:11303;188;This excellent film does a wonderful job, courtesy of Bale and a finely constructed plot of examining a stressfully twisted mind.
I:11303;189;While not a great film it certainly is loads better than the usual bilge Hollywood feeds the public.
I:11303;190;Perhaps the only downsides to the film are Leigh's hooker with a heart of gold (although she does what little she can with the role) and the ending.
I:11303;191;There should have been something more definitive and climactic than merely Trevor's getting shuteye.
I:11303;192;The best thing for this screenplay was that it had to be made overseas.
I:11303;193;Maybe I just find it fascinating.
I:11303;194;this film is fascinating because of Bale and the involving storyline.
I:11303;195;And, without giving anything away, the ending was outstanding, message.
I:11303;196;At least she's consistent in her roles.
I:11303;197;He has to be the poster boy for anorexia.Yet, the film is still fascinating, well.
I:11303;198;photographed and certainly a unique story.
I:11303;199;This film is an effective, neo.
I:11303;200;Again, this is a eerie and effective film.
I:11303;201;the movie is a must see tour de force, pulling you in deeper the longer it runs, just a 5 star piece of movie
I:11303;202;After seeing Christian Bale all buff and beautiful in American Psycho, it comes as quite a shock to see the physical transformation he underwent for The Machinist.
I:11303;203;It's a film that beautifully captures that timeless feeling when you can't sleep and yet are exhausted.
I:11303;204;bale's physical transformation is so astonishing that it's almost distracting.
I:11303;205;Bale does a great job of showing Reznik unraveling and becoming paranoid.
I:11303;206;The actor brings his trademark intensity as he plays a man coming apart at the seams.
I:11303;207;Like Lynch's film and Memento, The Machinist is a fascinating whodunit about perception, a cinematic jigsaw puzzle that we must put together along with the protagonist, someone who can't or is unwilling to accept reality and chooses to remember things his own way.
I:11303;208;He talks at length about the challenges of shooting an independent film in Barcelona, Spain.
I:11303;209;spoken and intelligent in this solid commentary.
I:11303;210;This is an excellent look at the making of this movie done in the same style and manner of pacing that mirrors the motion picture itself.
I:11303;211;Christian Bale's performance alone deserves a better all around film.
I:11303;212;He's seeing things, believing things, being haunted by things that may or may not even exist and Christian portrays this perfectly.
I:11303;213;It's the breed of overacting that makes an adult.
I:11303;214;I read the previous reviews and believed them.
I:11303;215;The only reason I give it two stars is because the acting is superb.
I:11303;216;itis, it's always a treat to find a movie that dares to be original and to walk a dark line all its own.
I:11303;217;the best way I can describe The Machinist is to suggest that it must be a lot like one of Tim Burton's dreams.
I:11303;218;The mystery of it all starts out with great strength, but I think the director just overplayed his hand a tiny bit .
I:11303;219;star effort all the way.
I:11303;220;and for all the stone, and sweat, and blood, and steel, iron portcullises and electric mag.
I:11303;221;lock gates, the Hole and Death Row and the Green Mile, the ultimate prison is still born of our own design: the human mind.

I:11303;223;"is it any wonder he can't sleep?Director Brad Anderson proved his skills at plumbing and twisting the intricate workings of the tortured human mind with ""Sesson 9"": ""The Machinist"" shows Anderson has only honed his craft with time."
I:11303;224;Machinist is in some ways a more ambitious effort, a bracing, brooding, menacing jaunt into dark territory Kafka would recognize and Dostoevsky would understand.
I:11303;225;"the acting is superb: Bale turns out an astonishing performance that goes far beyond the physical sacrifice he made for ""The Machinist""."
I:11303;226;he is wondrously attentive, rapturously alert, to all the little changes in his circumscribed existence.
I:11303;227;Bale serves up a mesmerizing picture of a warped, fragile, and doggedly curious soul determined to plumb the depths of the horrors taking place inside his skull and.

I:11303;231;the interior of a machinery.
I:11303;232;with a little touch of Hitchcock in the direction, I moved slowly through this movie to find at the end a terrifying tale about a lonely man that most of the people that surrounds him hate, but you, as the viewer will look at him with empathy.
I:11303;233;christian Bale is a great actor.
I:11303;234;One day he will be more recognize for his work.
I:11303;235;Christian Bale's performance is so intense and his physical appearance so shocking this is a MUST see for any Bale fan.
I:11303;236;This is quite important because we know that there is something odd with Reznick and it was important to showcase the film without its vibrant colors.
I:11303;237;Front channel, clear and understandable.
I:11303;238;The musical score by Roque Banos definitely highlights the eeriness of certain scenes of the film.
I:11303;239;A very informative commentary by Brad Anderson as he goes into what he wanted to accomplish with the film, shooting in Barcelona, talking about the various talens and really dissecting the certain scenes.
I:11303;240;We learn more about the narrative of the film, the performance by the cast including interviews with cast and crew and more!
I:11303;241;These are actually solid scenes that could have changed the emotional impact of the film.
I:11303;242;"jUDGMENT CALL:""THE MACHINIST"" is one of those films that you can look at it as quite a unique story."
I:11303;243;The film is a psychological thriller that has you on the edge of your seat at times, especially when you start to explore the psyche of Trevor Reznick and the dark and dreary world that he lives in.
I:11303;244;But what made this film believable was Christian Bale and what he put himself through to making his character seem real and odd.
I:11303;245;"before the Batman films and ""Terminator Salvation"", we have always learned about how intense an actor, how dedicated Christian Bale was to character role."
I:11303;246;ray special features definitely make this Blu.
I:11303;247;overall, this is quite an intense psychological thriller that fans of films by Alfred Hitchcock can probably give a nod to.
I:11303;248;It's cleverly written and the challenges that the cast and crew had to go through (especially trying to make Barcelona, Spain look like a town in the US) to make this film possible was well.
I:11303;249;It may be a bit dark and eery for some but it was a film that definitely caught me by surprise at the end.
I:11303;250;THE MACHINIST is definitely recommended.
I:11303;251;Going into this movie I had very high expectations.
I:11303;252;I heard from many friends that it was a great movie.
I:11303;253;There was a lot of suspense, a lot of building tension and then the end just didn't do it for me.
I:11303;254;I don't like gory movies, but I do like suspense, and this movie did an excellent job with that.
I:11303;255;The next day I reevaluated my opinion and decided that it was actually a really good movie.
I:11303;256;It takes more than that to be a good actor.
I:11303;257;I would recommend this movie to anyone who is old enough to watch it.
I:11303;258;It was really well executed.
I:11303;259;I do feel that The Machinist is the better of the two movies.
I:11303;260;All I can say is EXCELLENT!
I:11303;261;Special care was made in making this film as a classically beautiful one.
I:11303;262;The music score was marvelous.
I:11303;263;"This movie reminds me deeply of the movie ""Jacobs Ladder""."
I:11303;264;This is definately a psychological thriller!
I:11303;265;Christian Bale is also excellent in this role.
I:11303;266;"Equally good is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Stevie, a compassionate lady of the evening who befriends Trevor
I:11303;267;a. like, grins and giggles wickedly as Ivan, a surreal coworker and tormentor of Trevor's.
I:11303;268;While it may fall into some other psychological film categories, it's definitely a unique film in it's ownright.
I:11303;269;From it's quirky characters, to it's unusual settings (including a lot in Bale's blue collar worker's place of employment: a machine shop), to it's visual look and direction, this is very close to being called a true, one of a kind film.
I:11303;270;The actor who plays Bale's psychological nemesis is also excellent.
I:11303;271;He is the one Bale keeps seeing show up at work, while no one else does.
I:11303;272;the film is strong enough to keep your interest thorughout, with interesting dialog, character development, and the mystery element.
I:11303;273;While not the most thrilling or complex of psychological puzzles, the end is rather simple, yet very satisfying, and it thankfully does not go the artistic route and come up with some preposterous twist ending.
I:11303;274;this is not a movie for everyone, but it's a fine piece of cinema and deserves to be seen.
I:11303;275;An interesting story about what it must be like to have dementia, paranoia, and insomnia at the same time.
I:11303;276;This is a fairly dark movie but in the end is an engaging story with an ending that brings everything together.
I:11303;277;The best thriller I have seen in a long time.
I:11303;278;Christian Bale deserves an Oscar for his performance.
I:11303;279;The Machinist expertly portrays a character that, due to a year without sleep, lives in a world somewhere in between reality and la.
I:11303;280;Aside from his physical transformation, his performance is also pitch perfect.
I:11303;281;It's also interesting seeing Bale act alongside Jennifer Jason Leigh, who's made a career of doing excellent, chameleon.
I:11303;282;She is also excellent, although it's the kind of role she's played often before and is really kind of wasted in.
I:11303;283;A completely convincing, complex but unsubtle portrayal of the torturous psychological disintegration of an insomniac.
I:11303;284;The Machinist is, above all, a true testament to how far a serious actor will take his profession.
I:11303;285;the Machinist is a very psychological thriller, somewhere between Memento and Fight Club.
I:11303;286;the acting is superb, not only by Bale, the direction is solid and the story, although easy to figure out, is fairly original.
I:11303;287;the special features include the ever popular movie trailor's and making of documentary.
I:11303;288;They also include a great commentary for anyone wanting to find out everything about the movie.
I:11303;289;i recommend this movie for the overall fine performances and the well.
I:11303;290;crafted direction, it has some good scenes no doubt about it.
I:11303;291;I do wonder if Christian Bale or another young actor wanting to make an impression will ever go the whole dedication route and become a full.
I:11303;292;If you are a Christian Bale fan you will be riveted to his character and think how good any movie would be if all the actors put in 110% like Christian.
I:11303;293;"Christian Bale is one of those rare actors whose devotion to his craft goes way beyond the usual ""I gained/lost ten pounds, so give me an Oscar!"""
I:11303;294;He's only able to keep his life organized with post.
I:11303;295;But you have to admire the dedication of a man who does this sort of thing for his art .
I:11303;296;but Brad Anderson's direction is important in making that performance shine.
I:11303;297;In fact, everything has a feeling of profound WRONGNESS.
I:11303;298;The Machinist is not an easily movie to watch, but it is a brilliant one .
I:11303;299;And Christian Bale proved through it that he is one of our greatest living actors.
I:11303;300;I'll just start by saying that Christian Bale was amazing in this role.
I:11303;301;What an amazing transformation as well.
I:11303;302;They are both strong character studies.
I:11303;303;This movie is saved by it's great study of Trevor Reznick, a man who has not slept in over a year.
I:11303;304;Jennifer Jason Leigh co. stars, but she is such a great actress, but is always in small parts.
I:11303;305;He works at a big factory, working with machines.
I:11303;306;He also likes to go to the airport cafe everyday to talk to Marie, the beautiful French single mother, who Trevor is able to talk to easily.
I:11303;307;Mother fits into the six spaces of the hangman game.
I:11303;308;Bale is fascinating to watch, and I couldn't keep my eyes of him.
I:11303;309;I could see an Oscar nomination for Bale, and this gritty tale wouldn't have been the same without him.
I:11303;310;If you see it for any reason, make Bale the number one.
I:11303;311;This is a story of a man whose life is deteriorating.
I:11303;312;the lighting in this movie also lent a hand in illustrating mood.
I:11303;313;especially at the machinery and at the airport .
I:11303;314;I know there were some parts that still confuse me, but overall, I still liked it.
I:11303;315;I enjoyed Christian Bale's performance as well as the overall mood of the film.
I:11303;316;There's a good lesson in here that shows what happens when you take the wrong path.
I:11303;317;This movie is so cool.
I:11303;318;It will keep you guessing and on your toes until the very end.
I:11303;319;I highly recommend this movie to anybody that loves suspense movies like Fight Club or The Usual Suspects that keep you guessing on the ending.
I:11303;320;Just imagine Alfred Hitchcock, David Fincher and Christopher Nolan all collaborating on a movie and the result might be something like The Machinist.
I:11303;321;bender that had me riveted from the first minute to the last.
I:11303;322;In my opinion, The Machinist is certainly one of the best suspense thrillers of the last few years.
I:11303;323;In an era of tired, formula thrillers (e. g. most of Ashley Judd's filmography), Brad Anderson's The Machinist is a breath of fresh air: a deep, complex, layered film that could be deemed to be about any number of things.
I:11303;324;The story itself is certainly not the most original.
I:11303;325;Brad Anderson and screenwriter Scott Kosar take these elements and weave them into a stunning whole that truly stands apart.
I:11303;326;The Machinist works best as a dark, twisted psychological experience in which the audience is brought into Trevor Reznik's (Christian Bale) disturbed state of mind.
I:11303;327;It is truly intense and at times, frightening.
I:11303;328;He obviously devotes himself thoroughly to his performances even at the risk of his own health.
I:11303;329;I look forward to seeing Bale's take on Batman next.
I:11303;330;His insomnia has directly affected his physical appearance as well, coming across as some sort of crystal meth junkie.
I:11303;331;christian Bale's physical transformation in this film is frightening.
I:11303;332;He's a walking skeleton, a virtual bag of bones.
I:11303;333;Of course if she's going for that burnt out trashy street walker look, then she's succeeded in spades.
I:11303;334;A pretty cool scene by the way.
I:11303;335;the beginning of the film is well paced and keeps you on the edge of you seat.
I:11303;336;This leads you on a rollercoaster ride through the thoughts and dreams of Reznik, all escalating to the pinnacle of the film.
I:11303;337;"*** This comment may contain spoilers ***""The Machinist"" is a very interesting film with a simply stunning performance from Christian Bale as Trevor ."
I:11303;338;what he did was amazing and I mean not only his physical transformation that by itself was a real sacrifice an actor can commit for his Art.
I:11303;339;Besides Bale's performance, the film is masterfully directed and what is very important, clever written.
I:11303;340;The ending was very satisfying and put all pieces of the puzzle together.
I:11303;341;The Machinist may bring all these pictures to memory but it is a masterfully crafted and compelling study of one man's journey from his crime to the punishment where he himself was a criminal, a victim, a prosecutor, and the executioner.
I:11303;342;Both films take place in the atmosphere of confusion, paranoia, guilt, and unbearable terror and both have the unforgettable performances by Christian Bale and Ralph Fiennes as two very disturbed individuals.
I:11303;343;Too bad because Christian Bale's acting job is absolutely incredible.
I:11303;344;Plot and character are important, but I find the thing that really draws me into films are the mood and the visual style.
I:11303;345;And, this is the way it should be.
I:11303;346;The rest of the film is simply his looking into what's really going on, and our peering into Reznik's troubled world and mind.
I:11303;347;visually, this film comes across as a mix of two David's: Fincher and Lynch.
I:11303;348;oozing refrigerator, the mysterious post.
I:11303;349;The truly ingenious twists come when the entire film seems to be about something else, has a whole other plot, yet is still filled with clues that'll change the way you look at everything.
I:11303;350;I just like the mysterious and surreal.
I:11303;351;Real life is always so mundane, films should show us something more interesting.
I:11303;352;By virtue of Christian Bale's devotion to his craft, he deserves five stars.
I:11303;353;It's a solution that is satisfying, because it is believable, but it's also too little too late.
I:11303;354;with the Machinist, director Brad Anderson has created a love sonnet to Hitchcock.
I:11303;355;This purposeful tip of the hat to Hitchcock, and Christian Bale's immersive portrayal of a man who is slowly losing his mind make the Machinist worth watching, despite the fact that it boasts one of my least favorite twist endings.
I:11303;356;Bale is positively skeletal in this movie.
I:11303;357;taking into account the undeniable Hitchcock style that Brad Anderson gave this movie, and the remarkable acting from everyone involved, especially Christian Bale, I would recommend this movie to horror fans who are interested in thrillers that move a little slower but are thick with atmosphere.
I:11303;358;The ending is a bit of a letdown, but as with HAUTE TENSION, the telling of the tale justifies at least one viewing.
I:11303;359;This is a very dark movie that keeps you wondering what exactly is going on, but keeps you riveted and interested throughout the entire movie.
I:11303;360;Christian Bale is absolutely amazing as the main character who is obviously fighting some very dark demons that control him to the point of starvation, hallucination and extreme insomnia.
I:11303;361;Without a doubt, Bale's acting in this movie is Oscar.
I:11303;362;heart and is NOT a family viewing movie, particularly for small children.
I:11303;363;He could see a stunning and frightening film in his mind's eye, something unique and completely off.
I:11303;364;brad Anderson has directed 12 films since 1995, one of the most notable being NEXT STOP WONDERLAND (1998).
I:11303;365;He has taught film classes in Boston, and directed a lot of episodes for various television series.
I:11303;366;this film has already achieved cult status.
I:11303;367;Most viewers are taken aback by the raw intensity of the action, the macabre point of view, and the deep emotions .
I:11303;368;That is the primary thing that makes film discussion and criticism so visceral and engaging.
I:11303;369;"a lethal smile with horsy teeth and deadly eyes
I:11303;370;leigh added another hooker with a heart of gold to her role charm bracelet, doing a bang up grand job as Trevor's call girl/girlfriend, Stevie.
I:11303;371;Leigh is so comfortable in the nude we forget she is acting, bringing both sensuality and matronly affection to the table.
I:11303;372;"It transcended time and space, and even place
I:11303;373;It requires multiple viewings to fully appreciate the acting, the art design, the psychology, and the writing.
I:11303;374;If your seeing it for the first time, you can expect to enjoy a movie where you really have to pay attention to every detail.
I:11303;375;Christian Bale's acting is cutting edge.
I:11303;376;The fact that Christian starves himself and really gets into his character makes the likeness of Trevor Reznik very palpable and captivating.
I:11303;377;This movie takes you through the unraveling of pyschological states.
I:11303;378;This movie very eloquently shows the viewer what sort of dark things lay in the sub.
I:11303;379;concious, and the power of the sub.
I:11303;380;The beauty of this movie is you get to feel like its happening to you.
I:11303;381;Above all else this movie is philosophically insightful if one takes it seriously, the pyschological states explored give one a unique perspective on the influence of sub.
I:11303;382;concious mind, and in order to balance the system of pyschological processes the repression has to be acknowledged and come to terms with on all three levels.
I:11303;383;I recommend this movie to anyone who likes intelligent cinema, and can appreciate a movie that'll make you think and not just take up your time like so many other films.
I:11303;384;THE MACHINIST is a mesmerizing film, a journey through the interstices of a mind deprived of sleep, of nourishment, and a mind that struggles to untangle the chaos of a past of guilt and terror.
I:11303;385;And the journey is terrifying.
I:11303;386;It is the getting there that is the tough beauty of this amazingly rich film as written by Scott Kosar and directed by Brad Anderson.
I:11303;387;To say more would be a great disservice to the extraordinary plot.
I:11303;388;christian Bale delivers one of the most committed performances on film.
I:11303;389;We stand in suspense with him and his fall is as powerful as any Dante ever devised.
I:11303;390;The entire cast is superb but special kudos go to Jennifer Jason Leigh who finally has a role that allows her to demonstrate the spectrum of skill she possesses as an actress.
I:11303;391;Not an easy film, this, but a very important one.
I:11303;392;The good news is: it's possibly his best role.
I:11303;393;or a concentration camp survivor.
I:11303;394;Such is his dedication to the role.
I:11303;395;the show is very well filmed and unfolds like a twilight zone story.
I:11303;396;A neat package but not quite dark enough.
I:11303;397;A movie you'll have to watch again to catch and understand everything.
I:11303;398;Fine performance by the main actor.
I:11303;399;It is an entertaining psychological thriller.
I:11303;400;overall, it is a fun movie to watch, but do not expect the greatest psychological thriller ever.
I:11303;401;The Machinist is about a man who can't sleep.
I:11303;402;You might wonder if that is reason enough for you to watch this film and that is precisely why I took me a while to finally watch it.
I:11303;403;I thought it would be easy to write a review for this film.
I:11303;404;"i liked ""Fight Club"" but didn't like ""Memento"" too much and I thought ""Seven"" was good while I thought ""Lucky Number Slevin"" insulted movies."
I:11303;405;The more popular ones had one or two characters to keep you interested.
I:11303;406;I liked Machinist because it had everything a character should be and more.
I:11303;407;In Trevor Reznik's heart resides a man of much mystery, intrigue and forgetfulness.
I:11303;408;i mean, 11 minutes into the film I knew I was going to love it.
I:11303;409;It is a masterpiece because it has to be watched again to be appreciated and understood.
I:11303;410;Overall, much like my fellow readers who've written very good reviews for the Machinist, I felt the background score was truly magnificent while the semi.
I:11303;411;lucid conscience of characters had it's own charm.
I:11303;412;the Machinist will grab your nerve and noodle it.
I:11303;413;Easily among my top 15 films of all time and I just saw it a week back.
I:11303;414;I will now go and watch every film by Christian Bale (loved Prestige) and meanwhile you should go watch The Machinist.
I:11303;415;The talent, the dedication he brings to his work are phenomenal.
I:11303;416;This was one of the greatest, creepiest movies I have seen in a very long time.
I:11303;417;His performance is unforgetable and will leave you stunned.
I:11303;418;this movie will keep you guessing until the very end.
I:11303;419;The finale is unexpected and shocking.
I:11303;420;they've done a great job of hiding it.
I:11303;421;I was stunned by how powerfully good it was.
I:11303;422;It's one of those movies that my mind kept returning to, the day after watching it.
I:11303;423;The more I remembered the details of the movie, the more I appreciated what a beautifully orchestrated psychological thriller it really was.
I:11303;424;"It's smarter, scarier, and ""real."
I:11303;425;and I really liked that movie.
I:11303;426;and he is really truly amazing at it.
I:11303;427;But the full story is much more than that.
I:11303;428;Because the beauty, scratch that, .
I:11303;429;power of this film is the unfolding of the story.
I:11303;430;I saw this movie a few weeks ago, and I still can't get it off my mind!
I:11303;431;It's just one of those movies that sticks with you long after you've seen it.
I:11303;432;It was very well done, from start to finish.
I:11303;433;christian Bale, who plays the main character and is one of my favorite actors.
I:11303;434;"if you like him in this movie, then I highly recommend the movie ""American Psycho""."
I:11303;435;This movie was Christian Bale at his best.
I:11303;436;The film is truly breathtaking and needs to be wached twice to really grasp what is going on.
I:11303;437;The best film of 2004!
I:11303;438;I would have given this movie 4 stars but Christian Bale's performance made me change it!
I:11303;439;You can literally see all of his bones!
I:11303;440;I thought he deserved one for American Psycho!
I:11303;441;Well, you know what, this man has the right tone, facial expressions, and everything!
I:11303;442;For all of you saying that it copied off a certain movie gives away the whole movie.
I:11303;443;Like any of you knew the exact ending!
I:11303;444;Because you know what's going to happen!
I:11303;445;The movie was very suspensful and intriguing and had me entertained all the way.
I:11303;446;It makes you think a little and it's memorable.
I:11303;447;this work must be included among the best twenty cult movies of this decade.
I:11303;448;The Machinist is not only an amazing phychological thriller, but it contains one of the best performances I've ever seen.
I:11303;449;As soon as you see Christian Bale's skeletal body, and how emaciated he became just to play the part, you know there's something special here.
I:11303;450;Frankly, you'll either love the twist or feel cheated.
I:11303;451;I feel that this movie is way underrated, especially given Bale's performance.
I:11303;452;Go and enjoy some great storytelling.
I:11303;453;Christian Bale's reverse Robert DeNiro Raging Bull performance really adds to the grimness and isolation of his character.
I:11303;454;it's a tour de force of a performance.
I:11303;455;the ending is indeed a shocker, a surprise that can scarcely be anticipated.
I:11303;456;It is the perfect, the most satisfying, ending I've seen in quite a while.
I:11303;457;The directing led the pace of the film in a remorseless ride through the symbols that tell us what is truly happening.
I:11303;458;The Machinist is a curious project, in that it's secrets are interconnected and seem to overlap one another.
I:11303;459;"funny how Christian Bale dropped sixty pounds to play the role of Trevor and still managed to go through ""Batman Begins"" without pulling up his Batbelt."
I:11303;460;When you watch Trevor look into the mirror, all you see is a skeleton with skin, but that skeleton sure knows what he's doing.
I:11303;461;the supporting roles are fine, Leigh as the sympathizing hooker, S nchez.
I:11303;462;Still, in the end, when numerous surprises are unwrapped, the realities of the two women are redefined, and the women are revealed to have fresh meaning to Trevor's tormented mind.
I:11303;463;It takes a lot of thought to imagine the pain that Trevor experiences day.
I:11303;464;the thoughtful writing and the layered symbolism give the film emotional and intellectual dimension.
I:11303;465;"Smart choices were made that allow viewers to perceive that they are on a cinematic treasure hunt, and should be looking for and interpreting clues
I:11303;466;bTW, Jeniffer Jason Leigh's gritty, unadorned brilliance glows.
I:11303;467;the principle actors in the film all are very convincing, especially Christian Bale, who looks seriously haunted in this picture.
I:11303;468;John Sharian as Ivan, the mystery man with the disfigured hand is also a compelling screen presence.
I:11303;469;This is a nice creepy psychological thriller, well worth watching.
I:11303;470;there is one point to be made in favor of the film.
I:11303;471;It's clear that Christian Bale is a fine actor and he put his all into his role as Trevor Reznik.
I:11303;472;He works in some type of machine shop but I don't think we are ever told what they are making.
I:11303;473;Despite his skeletor looks, Reznik knows a lovely waitress who fancies him.
I:11303;474;The cast and crew seem to be impressed by his dedication.
I:11303;475;There is lots of talk about this movie never had a chance to be made because of its story.
I:11303;476;how they turned Barcelona into Los Angeles is interesting enough.
I:11303;477;It was not worth the risks but I guess that is a dedicated actor for you.
I:11303;478;Thankfully, this film has a satisfying ending which explains a lot of what went before.
I:11303;479;The Machinist is startling and well.
I:11303;480;no matter what the reason, it made an effective statement in this movie.
I:11303;481;i wonder if they used special effects at all or even makeup to add to the effect.
I:11303;482;ok, now to the story.
I:11303;483;And the Machinist hits the bull's eye in all of these categories.
I:11303;484;"in The Machinist, the acting and casting is top notch
I:11303;485;Both actor and director understand Trevor Reznick emotionally and physically.
I:11303;486;We are shocked as this walking corpse's presence fills the screen.
I:11303;487;See Batman Begins first for the real Christian Bale.
I:11303;488;It's a fine movie, too and it will give you a pretty good idea of how hard this actor worked to create his character.
I:11303;489;the Machinist is a complicated, psychological study of the holistic nature of the human experience.
I:11303;490;Reality and fantasy are explored on all levels.
I:11303;491;For me, this movie has a happy ending as Trevor is finally released.
I:11303;492;In Love Liza, the main character finally overcomes his fear.
I:11303;493;Christian Bale is one of the brightest of many young stars on the scene, and this was such a new look at just how wide his horizon might be.
I:11303;494;I chose a 5 star rating because the story is so unique and, of course, a great performance by Christian Bale.
I:11303;495;The screenwriter did excellent work at making you feel sympathy for what you think is a peculiar fellow.
I:11303;496;The ending jolted me with a huge surprise to the extent I needed to talk about the movie to someone who had seen it.
I:11303;497;I would recommend this movie for those who don't mind a dark movie and enjoy a unique story.
I:11303;498;The clever blend of repressed memories and psychotic conceptions, it'sMementoandFight Clubrolled into one.
I:11303;499;first and foremost, this is a vehicle for Christian Bale's dedication to character acting.
I:11303;500;awareness and guilt oozes from Bale's pores, as he absolutely nails the role.
I:11303;501;When a man goes much further, he's overlooked.
I:11303;502;With the eerie cinematography, music, and dedication involved, this is an original movie deserving of praise.
I:11303;503;The Machinist creeps along at an almost glacial pace but it wraps up very neatly in the end.
I:11303;504;Bale's performace carries the film and will go down as one of the most haunting performances of the past decade.
I:11303;505;Highly Recommended to fans of the horror or suspense genres.
I:11303;506;This movie was Christian Bale at his best.
I:11303;507;The film is truly breathtaking and needs to be wached twice to really grasp what is going on.
I:11303;508;The best film of 2004!
I:11303;509;The Machinist ranks in the top echelon of psychological movies.
I:11303;510;It's a brilliant character study that examines the effects of sleep depravity, among other things, on the human body and mind.
I:11303;511;His commitment to character is one of a kind.
I:11303;512;This movie is a great study of the human condition under the worst scenario.
I:11303;513;He's obsessed with cleaning his body and house with bleach.
I:11303;514;The Machinist is an atmospheric movie, one that will transport you to a waking.
I:11303;515;Thoroughly enjoyed this disturbing film.
I:11303;516;Brad Anderson has the potential to be that rare breed of artist: a great horror movie director.
I:11303;517;generic industrial worker, is so good that at times he is actually frightening.
I:11303;518;"Later on, in a very fleeting moment, we see ""Crime and Punishment"", which is much more appropriate."
I:11303;519;This film could easily be seen from a religious angle, although I think this would be wrong: Trevor is an ascetic of the most dementedly enthusiastic sort, throwing himself in front of cars and immolating his life in a thousand ways in order to atone for an act which can can never be really forgiven.
I:11303;520;the meaning of the movie aside, everything about it is so Kafka.
I:11303;521;"far better than ""Memento"", which I believe it is patterned after somewhat, this is yet another horror masterpiece by Brad Anderson."
I:11303;522;"The ""twist"" is such a let."
I:11303;523;wow, so Christian Bale was grotesquely skinny.
I:11303;524;This is an awesome film.
I:11303;525;The movie portrays his footsteps ingeniously.
I:11303;526;Well because Hollywood says so, that's why!
I:11303;527;come on Hollywood, give us something more.
I:11303;528;You can do better than this.
I:11303;529;Yea, this film is about the oppression of about 8 US million people.
I:11303;530;next time, show the real story and the real suffering that all of us go through every day.
I:11303;531;A lot of us are respectable individuals with a severe chronic incurable mental illness.
I:11303;532;Next time, show the real deal, and then we'll all give you more than 1 star.
I:11303;533;Christian Bale is terrific, as are the other actors in the film.
I:11303;534;The suspenseful mood and heavy atmosphere of this movie is fantastic.
I:11303;535;Thoroughly enjoyed watching this film.
I:11303;536;this is one of those movies you have to follow and then the last five minutes brings it all together.
I:11303;537;I will give Jenifer Jason Leigh a ten for the best tits in Hollywood.
I:11303;538;Anderson's eerie psychological thriller is an intelligent study of guilt and repression featuring a disturbing lead performance by Bale.
I:11303;539;"It is hard to see the hulking star of ""American Psycho"" so gaunt and sickeningly starved, but it serves the character's sympathetic, soul."
I:11303;540;gijon provide excellent support, as does Mr. Clean look.
I:11303;541;All I can say is that you simply must see this!!!
I:11303;542;Christian Bale gives, what I consider to be, his best performance ever.
I:11303;543;This movie is for movie buffs all the way.
I:11303;544;You'll watch this more than once, and find metaphors and symbology and clues that you didn't notice before.
I:11303;545;You will enjoy and appreciate that.
I:11303;546;The story itself is very well written, and almost flawless.
I:11303;547;The special features are pretty nice and informative, so even if you've never seen it, you're in for a treat.
I:11303;548;This is with no doubt, one of the Creepiest , complex and weirdest movies of all the times, Christian Bale's acting is superb,impresive.
I:11303;549;It'll get you hooked on your chair,it's a travel through the human mind's fears and guilts,this movie is intriguing, disturbing to watch,but in fact is one of the best Psycological thrillers in the history of movie makingExcellent!!!
I:11303;550;The music cues, some of the camera work, camera shots, etc are very reminiscent of Hitchcock's work, and that lends a lot to this film.
I:11303;551;"this film combines a lot of things I liked in other films, like ""Fight Club"", ""Jacob's Ladder"", assorted Hitchcock films, etc. we all have seen and heard of actors gaining or losing spectacular amounts of weight for a film role, but JEEZY PEEZY!!"
I:11303;552;This is easily the best movie that I have seen all summer long.
I:11303;553;I first saw him in Reign of Fire, and he didn't really impress me, just sort of the average British actor, but when I saw him in Equilibrium and American Psycho I was stunned.
I:11303;554;I love the way he speakes in an American accent if you want to call it that.
I:11303;555;If you've seen American Psycho, than you know how buff and perfect his body was for the roll of Patrick Bateman.
I:11303;556;He dropped his weight down to 120 something pounds, that is dedication.
I:11303;557;I can't say I knew any of the other actors, but they all did a great job.
I:11303;558;If you enjoyed the likes of Fight Club, Identity, and Psycho, you'll probably enjoy this movie as it sort of combines all three into one awsome film.
I:11303;559;This film shows his incredible range as an actor.
I:11303;560;It is well worth watching but not before bedtime.
I:11303;561;His performance as a deathly thin insomniac machinist is so unerring perfect it's disturbing.
I:11303;562;He is the character in every way.
I:11303;563;The Machinist is an intelligent, clever take on what could have been a predictable, cliche mess.
I:11303;564;Christian Bale stars in this semi.
I:11303;565;When you watch the previews, it seems as if this film is cat and mouse game with the main character hiding a secret.
I:11303;566;the musical score to the film does give it an interesting twist (along with the cinematography of a bleached look similar to Saving Private Ryan ) and that is where the Alfred Hitchcock feeling comes into play.
I:11303;567;This is one of the most gripping movies I have ever watched.
I:11303;568;It is a true charachter study that is so deep you literally feel the pain and sadness of the protagonist oozeing out of the screen.
I:11303;569;unfolds, to a dramatic climax that is better experianced then read.
I:11303;570;From it's sadistically funny opening to it's huge twist of an ending this movie had me on the edge of my seat.
I:11303;571;christian Bale shed 60 pounds to play this role.
I:11303;572;That is a incredible feat for a actor.
I:11303;573;This is a thriller and a mystery.
I:11303;574;The plot was terrific and kept me guessing right up until the end.
I:11303;575;The movie's concept is similar to A Beautiful Mind, Identity, Fight Club, etc.
I:11303;576;De Niro went to Italy to eat and gained a whole bunch of weight to play the role in Raging Bull and won the Oscar.
I:11303;577;Christian Bale looks as if he spent a year of not eating or sleeping to play the role in The Machinist, and he should have won the Oscar.
I:11303;578;He is very convincing as a man who has not slept in a year and who is having some.
I:11303;579;"He is such a wonderful actor
I:11303;580;I hope to see this young man around for years and many more films!
I:11303;581;Christian Bale is such an amazing actor.
I:11303;582;I know he is eccentric, but honestly if he wasn't he would not be so great!
I:11303;583;The actor who portrays him also was in the great movie American Psycho.
I:11303;584;Well this movie is clearly about the spiritual supernatural I thought it was a good movie.
I:11303;585;do your self a favor go and see this instead of that White Noise this is better.
I:11303;586;And the customer service provided was even better!
I:11303;587;I had moved about the time this was ordered and Customer Service worked with me to get the movie delivered to my new home!
I:11303;588;Every day he works as a machinist at a factory, he goes out of his way to eat at the airport's diner just to converse with the waitress that works there, and he has befriended a hooker whom he still pays for sex even though their relationship is more than that.
I:11303;589;This smartly crafted thriller has all the right ingredients and everything connects, but in the end it falls short of making a lasting impact.
I:11303;590;aCTING: Christian Bale gives an amazing performance and once again shows us that he is one of the most talented young actors out there.
I:11303;591;He also shows us that he is a dedicated actor.
I:11303;592;The rest of the cast is composed of mostly unkown actors.
I:11303;593;The movie is tense and very well made.
I:11303;594;The cinematography was excellent and the color tones were very creepy.
I:11303;595;A refreshing movie that is worth the price of admission.
I:11303;596;The Machinist rates as one of the best psychological films I've seen.
I:11303;597;"An excellent story, superb acting, and an awesome conclusion make ""The Machinist"" a great complete package."
I:11303;598;A masterful psychological thriller that shows the range of Bale and his efforts to fit a part.,
I:11303;599;An amazing performance by Christian Bale, a very good one by Jennifer Jason Leigh,and a cool, effective, desaturated look.
I:11303;600;but the ending is so neat, and ties up the loose ends in such an obvious,that it takes a bit away from all that precedes it.
I:11303;601;How much of what I've experienced is real and how much can be attributed to the workings of my lunatic mind.
I:11303;602;"The Machinist and ""Stay"", films with very dissimilar plots, share the same themes and stylistic conventions."
I:11303;603;I have an enormous fear of this type of picture.
I:11303;604;both films share the same deliberate pacing.
I:11303;605;Both films boast great performaces.
I:11303;606;As a man who hasn't slept for a year, he is hauntingingly believable as he struggles to make sense of his surroundings and what is happening to him.
I:11303;607;"In ""Stay"", we've got Ryan Gosling and Ewan McGregor as a psychiatrist and his patient."
I:11303;608;Both are terrific, as each is somehow displaced from the real world.
I:11303;609;And all along, you hope for the payoff.
I:11303;610;that you will ultimately be rewarded for your intellectual effort.
I:11303;611;I let out a huge sigh of relief, empathized and understood the ending.
I:11303;612;"The film by Brad Anderson (director of a great little thriller ""Session 9"") is a rich and emotional journey."
I:11303;613;"but ""The Machinist"" is an intriguing film made by talented people."
I:11303;614;It's worthy of a 4 star rating.
I:11303;615;Stay is, ultimately, an exercise in futility.
I:11303;616;but I'd give it 2 stars for its performances.
I:11303;617;eventually things begin to catch up with Trevor.
I:11303;618;the Machinist presents an intriguing tale where the main character finds himself in a paranoid world and the twilights of insomnia grab his awareness.
I:11303;619;The director Brad Anderson provides a stunning effort framing several of the scenes in wonderful compositions enhanced with the cinematography by Xavi Gim nez and Charlie Jiminez.
I:11303;620;These three filmmakers succeed in a brilliant way to capture the perception of Trevor, as he finds himself in a complicated situation.
I:11303;621;Another captivating facet of the film emerges through the mise.
I:11303;622;scene, which offers much detail to what takes place in the story.
I:11303;623;Lastly, the performance by Christian Bale is tremendous who went through a rough diet to perform the part, as he lost some 60 pounds.
I:11303;624;Altogether, the Machinist will keep the audience in thoughts while the ominous world of Trevor comes into sight, which will leave them thinking for some time after the film.
I:11303;625;There were parts that could have moved along a bit faster but Bale's performance was mesmerizing.
I:11303;626;Not the best movie I have every seen but definitely worth a look.
I:11303;627;"I loved the plot
I:11303;628;watch how, for example, when he meets other people, like his co. worker Miller and Miller's wife, the sky is a lot clearer).
I:11303;629;This is the core of the film.
I:11303;630;Ivan has a severly deformed hand, like that of a thalidomide.
I:11303;631;afflicted person, and a grin that could slice your ear off.
I:11303;632;Bald, thickset, and a Southern accent to boot.
I:11303;633;"trevor's life is grit
I:11303;634;So naturally, that leaves our anti.
I:11303;635;Anyways, as a psychologist I found this movie to be very thrilling and full of surprises.
I:11303;636;While it was personally horrifying seeing Christian Bale in that role, it was a very good movie!
I:11303;637;I really loved this movie.
I:11303;638;It has so many unique aspects to it.
I:11303;639;There isso much more you pick up on that way.
I:11303;640;Its an intriguing story with an interesting outcome.
I:11303;641;i'd definitely recommend this movie, but like I said, watch it first, then the bonus materials, then watch itagain with the director's commentary.
I:11303;642;it was a pretty good movie kinda predictable.
I:11303;643;go watch FIGHT CLUB and see the best double personality movie ever.
I:11303;644;Suspense and intrigue keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:11303;645;strickenness, good and evil, yada.yada.yada.
I:11303;646;"well, ""Memento"" did it a heckuva lot better."
I:11303;647;Christian Bale is one of the greatest actors of his generation.
I:11303;648;That said, the Machinist is a unique psychological thriller in that the protagonist looks like Death warmed over.
I:11303;649;As the viewer is drawn into his world, brief moments of happiness, respite from the fear, do not last long before we are plunged into another waking nightmare.
I:11303;650;recommended, but I recommend the futuristic action film Equilibrium more.
I:11303;651;Bale is his best here, physically (thank God) and of course in acting ability.
I:11303;652;i didnt realize that it was form overseas.
I:11303;653;the service was excellent .
I:11303;654;This is undoubtedly a great thriller movie!!
I:11303;655;The Bale's performance is outstanding!!
I:11303;656;The movie presents a thriller a history involving madness and hallucination.
I:11303;657;Christian Bale is an excellent actor who deserves much more credit that he receives from both the critics and views alike.
I:11303;658;"I mean he started as a boy in Speilberg's ""Empire Under the Sun"" (watch it and be amazed at his acting skills even then) and starred in such groundbreaking roles as ""American Pyscho"", and yet he is often overlooked when great actors are mentioned."
I:11303;659;This movie should move him up to the top of the list.
I:11303;660;Here he delineates a character to such a powerful degree that sometimes I simply stared at the screen in disbelief.
I:11303;661;please let that be the product of some Hollywood magic?
I:11303;662;The storyline is eerie and compelling and recounted so many times here that I will leave it alone.
I:11303;663;The dialogue is smart and every character is well played (even if Jennifer Jason Leigh has the downtrodden prostitute role down to a science).
I:11303;664;Although I loved this movie and gave it 5 stars, I do have one complaint.
I:11303;665;This is definitely a movie that you will talk about with your friends.
I:11303;666;And it goes and goes for Trevor Reznick.
I:11303;667;I'm sure other reviews mention it as well so there you have it.
I:11303;668;Figuring out what's up with Trevor Reznick is part of the viewing process as you enter into his world of sleep deprivation and minimal food consumption.
I:11303;669;much is made of Christian Bale's weight loss for this film and it is amazing, creepy, and scary, all at once.
I:11303;670;It fits since clearly this guy is on the Krakow diet plan.
I:11303;671;it's this point of view that gives Bale's sacrifice meaning.
I:11303;672;If you haven't seen him in this yet, it's pretty startling.
I:11303;673;The visual representation of all this does come across in a more visceral way when you see what this guy looks like.
I:11303;674;The film is shot at a languid pace and with a sort of bilious green color pallette.
I:11303;675;Operating heavy machinery and driving a car both figure into this tale prominently.
I:11303;676;but is the journey into Reznick's mind worth taking?
I:11303;677;The pace is purposeful and part of the storytelling device.
I:11303;678;That it is staying with me is a testement to Director Brad Anderson's attempt to create a dreamlike landscape and a haunted character study.
I:11303;679;I could have used a bit more meat to the plot, but irregardless any movie that manages to get under the skin and stick around for a bit is a worthwhile see and gets my approval.
I:11303;680;just thought I'd clear that up for anyone who has seen or will seethis movie.
I:11303;681;Great story, great direction, great acting.
I:11303;682;Awesome performances all the way 'round.
I:11303;683;It was an amazing film.
I:11303;684;I bought this movie for two reasons, Christian Bale is an amazing actor and the subject of insomnia strikes a chord in me because of my struggle with it personally.
I:11303;685;As you watch this movie, it will keep you wondering .
I:11303;686;I see a number of essay.
I:11303;687;length reviews of this movie, which makes sense, as the movie is indeed deep and complex .
I:11303;688;yet for the sake of those simply seeking a concise review, I will keep it brief.
I:11303;689;The given circumstances are extreme, but the consistency of the story and the performance are fantastic.
I:11303;690;If movies were acclaimed for their actors strict discipline then Christian Bale would win best actor for this movie and the movie would win best picture!
I:11303;691;And Bale's acting (as always) is solid in this film.
I:11303;692;But the story is one that has been played out as of recent.
I:11303;693;The writing in this film is phenomenal, as Trevor(played perfectly by a 120 pound Christian Bale) leads two lives, and both seem completely real.
I:11303;694;This film ends perfectly, as everything is wrapped up nicely, and it seems as though the writer had it planned out for months in advance.
I:11303;695;The Machinist is not an easy film to watch, but it is a very good one.
I:11303;696;has literally eaten away at him, body and soul.
I:11303;697;trevor is a machinist, a particularly astute one who knows every rule and keeps them all punctiliously.
I:11303;698;"The job and his associates hold little in the way of comfort or pleasure
I:11303;699;"but their connection is more emotional than physical
I:11303;700;Jennifer Jason Leigh gives a subtle and touching performance here, conveying sympathy without condescension and kindness without treacle.
I:11303;701;gijn, a virtual unknown in the States but deservingly respected elsewhere, gives another of the film's outstanding performances, as a woman kind.
I:11303;702;hearted but always just slightly intangible.
I:11303;703;"there are several layers of metaphor at work in the film, particularly in the emphasis on ""left,"" which carries with it implications of the sinister and ominous."
I:11303;704;It is a small but lovely touch on the part of director Brad Anderson that only the third and final time Trevor is faced with such a choice does he choose the Right.
I:11303;705;These elements are interesting the first time through, and gain even more meaning the second, when the reason for Trevor's disintegration is understood.
I:11303;706;"It is made believable by his cadaverous appearance, ghastly skin, eerily bright eyes
I:11303;707;He not only looks the part but inhabits it, bringing all the weight of his impressive talent to bear.
I:11303;708;minded dedication to the character, and his virtuoso performance, that elevates an otherwise engaging but not mind.
I:11303;709;blowing psychodrama to a gloomy but impressive work of art.
I:11303;710;There are a lot of really detailed reviews on here so I'm not going to make one of those.
I:11303;711;I'm just going to say that Christian Bale is a good actor and despite being a very unlikeable protagonist he still delivers a good performance here.
I:11303;712;That being said, if you've seen all four of those movies, and are a fan of Christian Bale, then you could give this one a try but if any of those conditions hasn't been met then I can't honestly recommend this film.
I:11303;713;"The four movies I mentioned previously are works which are very cohesive and engaging, I don't think that ""The Machinist"" is either: Christian Bale is the glue that holds the work together, without him it would've been so abrasive and contrived it would've fallen apart."
I:11303;714;Awesome acting on behalf of Christian Bale.
I:11303;715;I got it and then some with this cleverly haunting film that is unforgettable.
I:11303;716;but nobody knows who this guy is.
I:11303;717;watch after you see it all.
I:11303;718;It made sense, and it made even more sense on the second viewing.
I:11303;719;Christian Bale is fantastic in this.
I:11303;720;I think the movie was very well written and directed.
I:11303;721;"i really enjoyed ""The Machinist."""
I:11303;722;It surprised me and kept me hooked from beginning to end.
I:11303;723;"wutesy"" movies for the family, so it's good to see something so brutal, so raw and so in your face like this."
I:11303;724;I'm ready to see it again.
I:11303;725;the acting in this movie is outstanding.
I:11303;726;"Just seeing how much weight Christian Bale was willing to loose in order to play the role of Trevor is phenomenal, and is a crucial factor in allowing the movie to be perceived as ""real""."
I:11303;727;the plot on the other hand, is completely novel in my opinion.
I:11303;728;One is definitely keeps thinking throughout the movie, and is awarded at the end with a superb ending that wraps everything up.
I:11303;729;This reminded me of an Alfred Hitchcock movie.
I:11303;730;The entire way it was shot with stark imagery and symbolism made it very interesting.
I:11303;731;It was not a feel good, or comfortable movie, still it was very moving.
I:11303;732;The second time I watched it, it made more sense.
I:11303;733;Certainly worth a viewing if you can take some downside imagery of life.
I:11303;734;This movie was good, not because i hold Christian Bale as an extremely desirable actor, but because he IS A DESIRABLE actor!
I:11303;735;He transforms his physical appearance dramatically for his role and it is amazing how in depth he gets into his roles.
I:11303;736;"The Machinist is a visually striking mystery/psychological thriller in the vein of 1999's ""Fight Club"", in which insomnia produces a psychosis in the protagonist."
I:11303;737;It's an interesting premise, and Trevor is an interesting character.
I:11303;738;Christian Bale's appearance is shocking.
I:11303;739;With the help of director Brad Anderson's dark visuals, Bale creates an intense impression of decay and uncertainty.
I:11303;740;"In these things ""The Machinist"" succeeds."
I:11303;741;Christian Bale's performance is one of the most interesting of 2004, so have a look if you enjoy thespian virtuosity.
I:11303;742;The Machinist: Breaking the Rules (25 minutes) features interviews with director Brad Anderson, the cast, screenwriter Scott Kosar, and the film's Spanish producers, as well as some footage of filming in Barcelona, Spain.
I:11303;743;In the audio commentary, director Brad Anderson talks about his vision for the film, characters, story, locations, and his decisions.
I:11303;744;This commentary is reasonably informative and without many lulls.
I:11303;745;Subtitles for the film are available in English.
I:11303;746;Firstly, Christian Bale is on his way to becoming one of this generations best actors, it was incredible watching him work his magic on this film.
I:11303;747;I saw this film last night and it is still very much in my mind.
I:11303;748;I believe he is a kind and good hearted man, but he chose to run away from a situation than to confront it.
I:11303;749;There is a little bit of us all in Reznick, enteralizing our emotions on a daily basis, not only affecting ourselves, but those around us.
I:11303;750;And boy were we in for a treat.
I:11303;751;i dont understand how anyone can watch this movie and convince themselves that its worthy of much praise.
I:11303;752;The Machinist is a movie that is so enthralled and impressed with itself that it refuses to let go of its convoluted story.
I:11303;753;Strange things begin to happen, he sees people unseen by anyone else and the viewer, along with Trevor, is taken along in this psychological thriller with more twists and turns than a python asphyxiating its prey.
I:11303;754;It was excellent, and to see the extent to which he had starved himself for this role, makes the movie all the more exceptional and gut wrenching.
I:11303;755;it looks great and sounds great on blu.
I:11303;756;This is one of the strangest and disturbing movies I've seen in a while.
I:11303;757;Another great performance by Bale!
I:11303;758;MACHINIST is one of those pure art films that the makers must have known would be seen by very few people when they were making it, but they made it out of love of the film media and acting for it's own sake.
I:11303;759;Great acting by the always fantastic Christian Bale.
I:11303;760;Sometimes a little confusing and tough to watch, but satisfying in the end.
I:11303;761;Christian Bale's jaw dropping performance in the Machinist is reason enough to see this film, which is undoubtadly one of the most haunting and unforgettable films to hit mainstream America in quite some time.
I:11303;762;Director Brad Anderson gives the film a gray/blue.
I:11303;763;Bale is masterful in both his performance and getting into his character, and the man well deserves an Oscar nomination.
I:11303;764;All in all, the Machinist is a haunting film that is definitely not for everyone, but for those looking for a mind bending trip, look no further.
I:11303;765;The machinist operates a lathe in a factory and the dark industrial character of his surroundings is really pronounced in the movie.
I:11303;766;The movie is very well done and the ending presents the viewer with a surprise.
I:11303;767;It's always a bit saddening when I take notice of an actor who has dedicated himself to a character that will never be fully appreciated during its time.
I:11303;768;It's frightfully moving in the daunting peculiar sense, which director Brad Anderson accomplishes so mindfully.
I:11303;769;kilter presence to every scene.
I:11303;770;But it's more so the symbolic nature and visual style of this movie that really gives it its value.
I:11303;771;christian Bale gives an openly remarkable performance as a repressed, anorexic, insomniac.
I:11303;772;the film's opening is just as intriguing as its end.
I:11303;773;But the actor's unsightly appearance and intrepid performance is just merely the icing on Anderson's cake.
I:11303;774;If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist, she tells him.
I:11303;775;anderson does a remarkable job at this: keeping the audience focused and motivated to understand the perils of each character while captivating you with desaturated tones of greenish blue and dashes of red.
I:11303;776;The Machinist is undeniably Hitchcock inspired and definitely not for those who enjoy the simplicity of the movie.
I:11303;777;I have become very impressed with Christian of late.
I:11303;778;The movie is a suspenseful psychological drama with some vibrant touches of horror and is directed and acted beautifully.
I:11303;779;One of the best and original films of the years.
I:11303;780;I also thouroughly enjoyed director Brad Anderson's previous film Session 9, I cannot wait to see what he does next, the same goes for Bale.
I:11303;781;the actors all do a fine job and the story is haunting.
I:11303;782;At first I thought it would be kind of funny, as the mother of a newborn, to watch a movie about a man who can't sleep, but Christian Bale puts a whole new spin on the concept of being tired.
I:11303;783;He hasn't been sleeping well and things get more complicated for him once Ivan is introduced into his life.
I:11303;784;Jennifer Jason Leigh as well as Michael Ironside turn in some good performances.
I:11303;785;I also like the score for this movie.
I:11303;786;Its no overbearing and grating: Its haunting and eerie and complements the overall tone to this intriguing and well.
I:11303;787;So if you are in the mood for a great psychological thriller you couldn't go wrong with The Machinist.
I:11303;788;The Bottom Line:The central mystery to the movie is a bit of an old hat, but Bale is terrific, the direction is taut, and the sense of gloom which pervades the film is so oppressive and profound that The Machinist ends up making a deep impression.
I:11303;789;With the release of the new Batman movie I wanted to see how big Christian Bale's acting chops were.
I:11303;790;It is a really interesting story and can be a little hard to follow at times.
I:11303;791;"This film has been promoted as a ""psychological mystery,"" and on one level it is that."
I:11303;792;"These all play into the ""mystery"" element: how much of what Reznik experiences is real, and how much is in his head?"
I:11303;793;All this is resolved in a very satisfying ending, which packs quite an emotional wallop.
I:11303;794;It has a deep moral and philosophical resonance that other films of this type don't have.
I:11303;795;"christian Bale (the new ""Batman"") is excellent as Reznik
I:11303;796;The other cast members are good too, especially John Sharian as a creepy co. worker who seems to know more about Reznik than he should, and Jennifer Jason Leigh as a world.
I:11303;797;Guilt and grace are here, but not in ways you'll expect.
I:11303;798;With threefilms to his credit (please see Session 9 and Happy Accident),we have among us a very talented Writer and Director.
I:11303;799;It is a WORK OF ART that is both disturbingand moving.
I:11303;800;You will not forget this film, and ChristianBale has a great deal to do with the beautifully disturbingidiosyncracies of this film which deals with guilt, retribution and redemption with psychological obssession and decay asa subtext and I won't say more about the plot.
I:11303;801;This mans' life looks like a nightmare, Christian Bales' performance is indeed impressive (and not only because his great loss of weight for this part).
I:11303;802;"The movie makes you ""feel"" because of an sympathetic main character and great actor for the part."
I:11303;803;But nothing amazing, nothing remembarable.
I:11303;804;out damn spot meets sexy dark drama, yes sexy.
I:11303;805;gratifying ending rewards your time deliciously.
I:11303;806;The film was directed in a Hitchcock/De Palma/Lynch sort of style that kept me guessing and intrigued, while offering the classic bizzare and unsettling mood of a David Lynch sort of story.
I:11303;807;If it wasn't enough that Christian Bale starved him self physically to the point that he could have seriously suffered major health issues from it, on top of that he was seriously mesmerizing in this role.
I:11303;808;I call that true dedication to acting.
I:11303;809;I remember once caring little for this actor, but he has won me over over in the past few years with amazing performance after amazing performance.
I:11303;810;So much so that he has become one of my most favorite actors.
I:11303;811;This is an amazing actor.
I:11303;812;The details of Bale's character's recent past are unclear, but the broad picture is handed to you very early.
I:11303;813;hey, explain this to me.
I:11303;814;Worth watching to see Skeletor.
I:11303;815;wise, we think of De Niro, Hanks, maybe Carrey and that gal who played the fat British chick.
I:11303;816;The guy's got his sh.
I:11303;817;together and all that's left is the art and performance in its purest form.
I:11303;818;i also really took to Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance as the good hearted prostitute.
I:11303;819;Very well cast from a standpoint of beauty (can you believe she's in her 40's?
I:11303;820;Very special piece of film making with depth and staying power.
I:11303;821;I thought we were all done with rewarding eating disorders.
I:11303;822;"The closest thing he has to a girlfriend, a sympathetic hooker in the form of Jennifer Jason Leigh, says to him early on ""If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist,"" and it's true ."
I:11303;823;He begins to see things and people who don't seem to actually exist.
I:11303;824;product of the insomnia, or something deeper than that?Bale's performance is incredible, probably the best of his career.
I:11303;825;dimenaional performance at all, as we see that Reznik can be a charming and friendly man, even underneath all the layers of sleeplessness.
I:11303;826;It's a perfect performance and it drives the movie.
I:11303;827;the other essential aspect of the film is the mood it sets.
I:11303;828;The lighting is stark and grainy, and the colors are washed.
I:11303;829;Suffice it to say that this is a film which gets it all right.
I:11303;830;It tells a compelling story, it sets a definite mood, and it cements itself in the brain even when its over.
I:11303;831;That really fits Bale's appearance.
I:11303;832;He's seeing people at machines near him who don't work at his job, someone's breaking in to his apartment and leaving cryptic notes, everywhere he's seeing connections.
I:11303;833;but it truly explained a lot.
I:11303;834;Machinist is one of the best.
I:11303;835;acted films I have seen in a long time.
I:11303;836;It will keep you guessing (although I see some reviewers say they had it figured out all along .
I:11303;837;If you like Rod Serling (I saw a few Serling fans in here) then you will be pleased.
I:11303;838;There are guys wandering around the planet who managed to direct one truly great thriller, and them immediately began a downhill slide.
I:11303;839;But they've traded on that one great thriller for a multi.
I:11303;840;(M. Night Shyamalan, please pick up the white courtesy phone.)
I:11303;841;(There's a Mr. Christopher Nolan calling for you.)
I:11303;842;ladies and gentlemen of the world, Brad Anderson is back with the next film.
I:11303;843;two screens two weeks before Darkness opened on seventeen hundred) and slid back into the obscurity that, in the world of American mainstream film, is reserved only for truly great cinema.
I:11303;844;Here, the whole batch turn in excellent performances.
I:11303;845;Bale's has gotten a great deal of attention for his record.
I:11303;846;handed self, but Ironside has a deft eye for choosing his spots, and like most of the other places he appears, he makes his character work here.
I:11303;847;Jennifer Jason Leigh turned in a performance that should probably have been worth an Oscar nomination.
I:11303;848;there is a great deal more to be said about how brilliant certain aspects of this movie are.
I:11303;849;the cinematography, the sound mix, other technical details that enhance the atmosphere perfectly.
I:11303;850;Bale is a wonderful and amazing actor.
I:11303;851;His character, who is declining in a mysterious way, is at times creepy, charming, and full of potential as a person.
I:11303;852;I will not want to watch this again, but it was well worth it and frighteningly vivid.
I:11303;853;But when we know what Bale has done to bring on inscrutable insomnia, much of the film comes together a bit better.
I:11303;854;"if you are a ""Twilight Zone"" fan, this is definitely a must!!"
I:11303;855;What a performence, what a movie.
I:11303;856;Truely greatness true talent here Bale is in the top 3 of his generation.
I:11303;857;This is a pretty good movie, but I've seen a lot better.
I:11303;858;loosing weight i can see, but geez.
I:11303;859;This is a great darkmovie if you like that kind of thing.
I:11303;860;I do and I say check it out!
I:11303;861;Christian Bale achieved the look all right.
I:11303;862;Marie is warm and friendly.
I:11303;863;She has a son and, a bit inexplicably, a heart for Trevor, who spoils her with big tips.
I:11303;864;but the mood of the film is effective whether the loose ends are all tied up or not.
I:11303;865;Equally comic and macabre, Bale's very appearance is performance.
I:11303;866;Christian Bale is very impressive in this movie.
I:11303;867;The Machinist offers you an intriging story about a factory worker who obviously should be able to be in a way better job than he is now.
I:11303;868;Throughout the movie the answer to this mystery is slowly revealed.
I:11303;869;Bale, as the lead character, carries the movie on his own.
I:11303;870;done piece of work, be ready for an intense, psychological roller coaster ride.
I:11303;871;I love this movie to death!!!!!
I:11303;872;My favorite type of movies are suspense movies and this one reigns supreme.
I:11303;873;It's a masterpiece and I highly recommended to anyone who like to challenge their brain!
I:11303;874;Brad Anderson is a genius.
I:11303;875;If you liked Session 9 and Happy Accidents, this will take you to the moon and back.
I:11303;876;The narrative is very credible even if I didn't much care for the noirish coloration.
I:11303;877;If having the rug pulled out from under you is your thing, by a plot that isn't drunk on its ingenuity, then you'll love it.
I:11303;878;Its surprises spring effortlessly from the story and hook right back without any pretense.
I:11303;879;this movie is great and christian bale is awesome, although some of the other reviews are giving away to many details which will ruin the suspense for you.
I:11303;880;its best to not know what to expect with this movie.
I:11303;881;He looked like a skeleton but he made the movie very realistic.
I:11303;882;I recommend this movie to anyone whom is a fan.
I:11303;883;After watching it a few times, I can appreciate what they were trying to do with this film.
I:11303;884;This movie is a great psychological thriller!
I:11303;885;Christian bale is perfect in this role as Trevor and capture both the mentality and body image of an insomniac!
I:11303;886;Bale's performance is incredible and his method acting is to be highly commended.
I:11303;887;The various relationships (Bale and prostitute, Bale and waitress) are tender and yet slightly edgy, which keeps you engrossed.
I:11303;888;First, allow me to say that Christian Bale's performance in this movie was truly impressive.
I:11303;889;Bale is brilliant in his role as Trevor Reznik, an insomniac tormented by guilt and anxiety.
I:11303;890;What I will tell you, however, is that this movie provides a momentous insight into such powerful emotions as anxiety, shame and guilt.
I:11303;891;This is a powerful story of a man who has found his own unique way to handle his guilt and anxiety.
I:11303;892;Another highly interesting yet controversial topic raised in this movie is that of the faulty memories.
I:11303;893;Will we ever be able to reach a consensus as to which memories are real and which are created?
I:11303;894;A final comment: in my opinion, The Machinist is one of the best psychological thrillers available.
I:11303;895;Christian Bale (Batman Begins) shines in this small underrated gem about a factory worker named Trevor Reznik who is suffering from severe paranoia and a serious case of insomnia and weight loss.
I:11303;896;I will stop right here because the movie holds many secrets and surprises along the way.
I:11303;897;what keeps the movie highly interesting is Bale's incredible performance .
I:11303;898;he actually shed 63 pounds to play the role, something that will make such sophisticated charactor actors as Robert De Niro jealous!Overall, The Machinist is an extraordinary film that will keep your eyes glued to the screen, and keep you on the edge of your seat.
I:11303;899;a top notch psychological thriller!RecommendedA.
I:11303;900;If one allows the film to cast its spell, there is a sense of gratitude for the way it sets up the protagonist's stuggle and eventual victory.
I:11303;901;This is important, because there is little in this nightmarish story to find pleasure in, except the way it is written and lensed.
I:11303;902;His relationships with women, his co. workers (both real and imagined), and daylight are all depicted as threats to his exposure.
I:11303;903;The many gritty details, employed to construct a handful of characters, are thoughtfully woven together to create a picture that is paradoxically both realistic and fantastic.
I:11303;904;won because Trevor's perverse desire to be rid of his body stems from his intimacy with the machine.
I:11303;905;He works with heavy machinery, in spite of sleep deprivation, and at one point choses to be struck by a car.
I:11303;906;or even knows who Christian Bale is.
I:11303;907;A stunning performance from one of the best actors in the business.
I:11303;908;The Machinist is both an exceptional and haunting exploration of the way the mind deals with guilt, and an unforgettable vehicle for the genius of Christian Bale.
I:11303;909;Christian Bale gave an absolutely stunning performance.
I:11303;910;The movie itself was great with awesome visuals, a solid story, and music that will remind you of a Hitchcock film.
I:11303;911;He looks like a flesh.
I:11303;912;i would recommend this film for anyone who likes suspense and or creepy films.
I:11303;913;Making good psychological thrillers is hard.
I:11303;914;But the Machinist was definitely a pleasant surprise and a film that can take its place as one of the best in recent memory.
I:11303;915;Both were about a man going on an inner quest to discover something important about himself and his past.
I:11303;916;Both are very disturbing films that puts the viewer in the place of the protagonist himself, allowing you to feel the same confusion and fear that they feel throughout the film.
I:11303;917;the same also carries through to the lead actors.
I:11303;918;Tim Robbins gave perhaps his best performance of his career in Jacob's Ladder and I can say with full confidence that Christian Bale gives an equally startling and awe inspiring performance here.
I:11303;919;Giving a great performance as Trevor Reznick .
I:11303;920;the people in Trevor's life includes Stevie, a call girl, played beautifully and subtly by Jennifer Jason Leigh, a true friend and confidant to Trevor throughout the film.
I:11303;921;And the people at the machinery where Trevor works including his boss, Tucker, and co. worker Miller.
I:11303;922;the atmosphere the film gives off is wonderful.
I:11303;923;As with Jacob's Ladder, there are those memorable scenes that stay with you long after it's over.
I:11303;924;Both work wonderfully within each film.
I:11303;925;when all is said and done The Machinist was a very good but not perfect film.
I:11303;926;It's also worth seeing just for Bale's performance.
I:11303;927;It's dark and certainly not a happy movie, but sometimes that's what you're in the mood for.
I:11303;928;This film forces the audience to recognize the five W's and the necessity of finding closure to Christian.
I:11303;929;"but this movie is something else
I:11303;930;Regardless, the art director is a genius.
I:11303;931;Christian Bale is fantastic, he touched my heart.
I:11303;932;John Sharian (who played Ivan) was totally unforgettable.
I:11303;933;weary but compassionate prostitute (Jason.
I:11303;934;Christian Bale again delivers another outstanding performance.
I:11303;935;"Jennifer Jason Leigh is so believable, its hard to accept this is just a movie
I:11303;936;And while it adds a lot to his role, and is quite a thing to do, it's his acting as the lost Trevor that makes this movie the excellent noir it is.
I:11303;937;He keeps track of his weight loss as well.
I:11303;938;in fact, what makes this movie work really well is that it's a puzzle.
I:11303;939;Mostly, it's a very clever movie.
I:11303;940;"In fact, I will bet that a good majority of the people watching this movie will catch the first ""twist."""
I:11303;941;Right from the beginning it is hinted at, and not all that subtly.
I:11303;942;and that is the highest praise I can give this movie: it makes sense.
I:11303;943;"It's mysterious and involves ""twists"" but the twists make perfect sense."
I:11303;944;By the end of the movie, you can see why the entire film took place.
I:11303;945;It's realistic in that aspect.
I:11303;946;I very highly recommend this movie.
I:11303;947;It's interesting and can be suspenseful.
I:11303;948;This is a great movie, very well done, and Christian Bale is amazing.
I:11303;949;It is very similar in vibe, and I have a feeling that the director of The Machinist may have seen it more than once.
I:11303;950;If that's your idea of a fun time, then this movie is for you.
I:11303;951;The people that said they liked this movie are the same kind of people who bid on a potato chip who looks like moses.
I:11303;952;we humans create a very effective living hell for ourselves right here on earth when guilt and self.
I:11303;953;as with most hallucinations, there is a grain of truth and reality concealed within each, and it is up to the viewer to assimilate the tangled visual inputs and gradually come to a realization of the true nature of Trevor's plight.
I:11303;954;"i strongly recommend this movie to all who value and enjoy intelligent, challenging, complex stories such as Mulholland Drive, The Jacket, 21 Grams, and Memento.you will not be disappointed
I:11303;955;The acting, direction, music, and cinematography are first class, and the story line is absolutely superb.
I:11303;956;it promises to be a haunting, memorable journey.
I:11303;957;watching it recently, I found out that this film isn't that hard follow, and above all, it is very good.
I:11303;958;Like everyone else who has viewed the film, I was shocked by the looks of Christian Bale.
I:11303;959;"Ha, everyone thinks that Tom Hanks did a great job of losing weight for the role he played in ""Castaway"", well Bale's weight loss blows that right out of the water!"
I:11303;960;"As far as the story, it is very well written, and it keeps you guessing what exactly is going to become of his man who claims he ""hadn't slept in a year""."
I:11303;961;It's a very dark and slow paced film, and the performance by Christian Bale is riveting.
I:11303;962;I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys psychological/thriller/mystery types of films.
I:11303;963;good cinematic thriller with strong writing.
I:11303;964;The incredible directing drew the best of performances out of the actors.
I:11303;965;Bale proved his dedication to his role and also did a stellar performance.
I:11303;966;Ironside did great work in a supporting role.
I:11303;967;The story kept me in suspense to the end.
I:11303;968;THE MACHINIST lifts from all the right styles, borrows from all the right moods, takes its musical cues from all the right films, and the performances hit all the right notes .
I:11303;969;but it does fit in with the style of each film.
I:11303;970;We open in the present and are presented with a mystery that we then work towards backwards.
I:11303;971;And where the plot may fail to ignite debate, visually it helps to sell the point home.
I:11303;972;He's the hardest thing to watch in this film, and yet you can't take your eyes off him.
I:11303;973;But not even his performance and dedication to the part can really pull the film up from just being a modest, often mild, mystery.
I:11303;974;Jennifer Jason Leigh gives her best as well .
I:11303;975;His woes of location shooting are insightful and sometimes funny (listen for and look for two real junkies shooting up in one of the shots that made it into the film).
I:11303;976;Bale gets top honors for selling it .
I:11303;977;He works at a factory, on a machine, making parts for other parts.
I:11303;978;"The Machinist was made long before ""Batman Begins"" and the most striking thing about the film is what Bale did to his body to become Trevor."
I:11303;979;The physical transformation is amazing and painful to watch.
I:11303;980;looking past the physical, Bale has once again created a believable, interesting, three dimensional character.
I:11303;981;"directed by Brad Anderson (""Session 9"", ""Happy Accidents""), the film's cinematography is almost monochromatic."
I:11303;982;As we are watching the film through Trevor's POV, it is necessary for us to see his world as he views it.
I:11303;983;Anderson accomplishes this beautifully through this cinematic style.
I:11303;984;The film is a mystery of sorts, as Trevor works to uncover what this is.
I:11303;985;This element of is interesting and well.
I:11303;986;done, worked throughout to seem believable.
I:11303;987;The Machinist is an interesting, involving, well.
I:11303;988;made film starring one of the better actors working in film today.
I:11303;989;A great psychological thriller but not all that original, you realize early on that he is psychosymatic but still a great story line regardless.
I:11303;990;christian Bales physical change for the role is almost worth the price of the movie itself.
I:11303;991;I was not a Christian Bale fan prior (even knowing he would be in Batman) but this role showed what a great actor he can be.
I:11303;992;a very pleasant surprise for fans of movies like Momento, Barton Fink, Secret Window, and the Gimli Hospital.
I:11303;993;The Machinist is a good film.
I:11303;994;Remarkably , it's the dedicated acting and the excellent directing.
I:11303;995;As with the other reviews , I'll reintereate that Bale's performance was outstanding , by simply underplaying his character.
I:11303;996;His brilliant performance is also highlighted by his appearance.
I:11303;997;After that initial distraction , the film took on unexpected hieghts and emotional depths , that I'm sure I'll remember for years.
I:11303;998;This is a definate film , for Bale fans , to watch.
I:11303;999;And compounded by the casting of Christian Bale , as the new Batman.
I:11303;1000;this makes The Machinist, even more credible and amazing.
I:11303;1001;Haunting and brilliant parable about the ramifications of buried guilt.
I:11303;1002;Christian Bale is astounding and even more charismatic in his painfully gaunt state, and the film's plot nuances and cinematography linger in the memory long after it's finished.
I:11303;1003;Probably the best psychological thriller in YEARS.
I:11303;1004;This is not an easy film to get in to, and it takes a lot of commitment to stay with it to the end.
I:11303;1005;The payoff is worth the wait.
I:11303;1006;Quite possibly the best Bale movie I have ever seen.
I:11303;1007;His dedication to the role and his portrayal of Reznick is mesmerizing.
I:11303;1008;The Machinist is a gem, it's Bale's gripping, beyond.
I:11303;1009;duty performance that makes this movie impressive.
I:11303;1010;The film is actually a Spanish/American product, and this fact reminds me of other thrillers like 'The Others.'
I:11303;1011;The only solace he can get is the worker at airport, compassionate Marie (Aitana Sanchez.
I:11303;1012;the photography (by Xavi Ginemez, equally creepy 'Intacto') captures the protagonist's gradual psychological changes, or Trevor's downward trip towards hell, and the images themselves are often spooky with the metalic gray of the subtle lighting in the factory.
I:11303;1013;This movie is a psychological thriller, and definitely one of Christian Bale's best movies.
I:11303;1014;the movie has a great ending where all of your questions are answered and your jaw will be left hanging there while you try to wrap your mind around what you just saw.
I:11303;1015;This movie will me much more enjoyable going in with a clean slate.
I:11303;1016;I'll give Christian Bale credit for achieving the look of an anorexic released from a holiday in a concentration camp.
I:11303;1017;a friend recommended this movie to me.
I:11303;1018;Great movie, great acting, great suspense, great music.
I:11303;1019;And for what Christian Bale did for the part .
I:11303;1020;deserves to have everyone see it.
I:11303;1021;It is possible to savor a movie for its style and mood more than for what it actually has to say.
I:11303;1022;"In his commentary, director Brad Anderson calls it ""cool and creepy . . . a parable about guilt,"" and no one who sees ""The Machinist"" will argue with that."
I:11303;1023;It holds your interest without engaging your mind or emotions because nothing in it makes sense until the end when some (not all) of the mystery is resolved.
I:11303;1024;For this is one of those movies in which characters, locations, even entire scenes, are figments of the imagination.
I:11303;1025;the Los Angeles locations are rather captivating until you realize that the entire film was shot in Barcelona and Andorra using Spanish and English actors to support Bale and Jennifer Jason Leigh, playing (another!)
I:11303;1026;"bale, always a brave actor, is the real reason to watch ""The Machinist""
I:11303;1027;He fills it with symbols (the Pieta is invoked) and incident that his commentary has to explain, and tells us what a terrific movie he has made.
I:11303;1028;but anyways,christian bale is amazing in it.
I:11303;1029;great acting and i love the grainy background,so depressing which is so right for the storyline.
I:11303;1030;one of the best movies i have ever watched.
I:11303;1031;good storyline,great acting,just love it!!
I:11303;1032;His acting I must say is superb, he truly delivers a wide range of emotions .
I:11303;1033;fury, bewilderment, passive satisfaction, the whole nine yards.
I:11303;1034;the directing is also excellent, the entire movie is shot in soft colors and lighting, which gives it a mellow, yet ominous feel.
I:11303;1035;my only qualm about this flick, is that it reminds me of much of the last decade's hip indie thriller plotlines.
I:11303;1036;It also maintains a Hitchcockian vibe throughout with its desperate, schizoid portrayal of the protagonist.
I:11303;1037;sparing this it is a stylish, engrossing film which hits the mark.
I:11303;1038;I recommend before watching this film to pretend you had never seen the films I previously mentioned, and it will be much more enjoyable.
I:11303;1039;This was one of the most startling movies I have seen in a long time.
I:11303;1040;Christian Bale got his weight down to 120 pounds just to play the part and gives a performance that is worthy of an Academy Award.
I:11303;1041;It makes sense out of most of what came before and wraps it all up in a way that's ultimately revealing, reasonable and almost uplifting.
I:11303;1042;Christian Bale is a tremendous actor.
I:11303;1043;It is incredible that he could/would do that.
I:11303;1044;Christian Bale is a fine actor, and he really did a good job for what this movie was(is).
I:11303;1045;It's a pretty original story and certainly not commercially entertaining like most mainstream films.
I:11303;1046;It was captivating because Christian Bale was incredibly convincing.
I:11303;1047;And how often do we see good.
I:11303;1048;His performance is certainly on my top 10 of the year.
I:11303;1049;along the way, the acting will also keep you emotionally tuned in.
I:11303;1050;dimensional (at least so far) in terms of choosing his roles, but what he does (the intense, brooding type) always turns out excellent.
I:11303;1051;Instead, you'll actually care about the fate of Reznick when all is said and done.
I:11303;1052;I saw this movie a few years ago and I always recommend it to friends.
I:11303;1053;This is a great story with a resolution.
